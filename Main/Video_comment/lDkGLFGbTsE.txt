4:23 yeah it’s called intuition, ever heard?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WERE BEGGING HE DIED??????😭😭😭
4:26 😂
Why is the trainer in a whole purple guy suit?
10:14 dying
11:19 why not Pissadilious de Shitius🤑
Holy shit a sentient egg and a clown, that look like they didn't render. 2:12
Davidson didn't even mention anything about this movie because he knew this movie was PURE ASS MAN
idk why but his fingers really annoy me for no reason,like how his fingures are crooked in every way
Whenever something bad happens to me, or if i ever see something bad happen on the news, imma just cuss out marmadooj
Did you know that this moive is  a remake from 2012
6:14  dukes.. not duces
like a year ago i watched this movie for like 12 hours consecutively and it triggered a manic attack and i ended up overdosing on benadryl and going to the psych ward
cloudy with a chance of meatballs ahh
but what about the ballad of buster scruggs 🥹
Actually at 10:31 you can see one of the cheerleaders girls at the dog show being one of the victims of Marmaduke's toxic gasses. She definitely told her other friends about it and why they were able to make fun of one of Marmaduke's owners.
Marmaduke vore ?
s Netflix Just Making Bad Movies On Purpos
What kind of career-ending blackmail did they have on JK Simmons to get him in this movie
11:35
i swear this movie is ai generated that trophy scene was straight up ai slop
so its a animation version of a bad ripoff of the movie beethoven?(and beethoven also wasnt great)
I don’t think the ai spit marmaduke out. I definitely barfed it out in in 15 different parts of it.
As far as character design goes, I actually don't hate it, it's just terrible execution of pretty much anything else
4:23  >>>>TIDAL>>>>   <<<<<WAVE<<<<<<
Hwadcyh de erg ❤is 😮😂❤🎉😮😅😂❤ but
I wonder if Pete Davidson is just a cat person (jk). He was much more engaging in the Dog Man movie as Petey the Cat. Not world-defining or anything, but he did a great job for a movie that was simple in general, but was a fun time. It just feels like this movie fumbled literally everything it could have, including Pete which honestly shouldn’t surprise me from a Netflix animated movie that has nothing to offer.
"is just a cartoon movie"  The cartoon movie:
The characters look like if I kick their legs they would just snap in half like a stick
Watching a movie on Netflix and seeing the "Netflix Original" logo on screen will forever send chills down my spine.
“I thought he’d be the villain because he’s rich and British.”
marmaduke turned that area into fuckin chernobyl
Bro talk about the animation to💔🥀🥀
thats a kink
After watching Dog-Man, it's not because Pete Davidson's a bad actor - He just didn't care about this role.
Well, I like the movie😅😅😅😅😅😅
Danny needs to cosplay guy, it would be so easy
this movie genuinely makes me feel sick
why did you put the camera under ur desk
We should have a running gag were everything bad that happens in a video or anything bad happens in whatever he’s commenting on we all just blame Marmaduke
Father, when can I leave on my OoOwn
Looks like Netflix wants to destroy Humanity.
9:43 he sucked it in, yeah
How does he keep a straight face
To be fair the animation in this movie is like a mobile game 😅
This is my comfort video ✨
The only good movie on Netflix is invader zim inter the florpus XD
I knew i saw it, i think i liked it, it was just too stupid and bad to not laugh, but man its like a forgotten memory tjat came back
We had to watch this in class during covid and I've never been the same
11:28 the great shame would have been better
As far as I can tell, they intended to release this in theaters, but COVID came along, and Netflix ended up picking it up.  Thanks COVID!
just that clip of pinocchio was the worst movie i’ve ever seen
6:04 fart in em jeans and break yo ankles
How the tables have turned now
I like how this does not even resemble the original live action version 😂
2:17 A-AHHHH-
17:24 Show off
Why is there a dog named after a Greek god Aka a real steel robot claimed to be the "undefeatable" champion until getting the sh*t knocked out of him by Atom?
Pause at 2:08 to see the red lamp
Kpop demon hunters needs to leave
13:45 I watched this movie I forgot abt it and u made me remember it 😭😭😭
im normally pissed off when theres unavailable netflix movies in my country, but im glad that this thing is not in my home screen
Sadly I’m 12 and watched this movie so sad😭😭
Bro I thought this was bad and I watched it when I was 9
You know there is a live action version
2025 gang 👇
😂
I watched this movie 4 years ago and I never noticed it was bad until you reviewed it and I realized it wasn’t as good as I remember
2:45 I thought you said there was no redeeming qualitys
this is a bit ocd ish but can you put a "?" at the end please?
Thats wrong why did atou correct do that i meant to say spell not speed
I love marmaduke im sorry if I speed it wrong but I love this movie
At least kpopdemonhunters is good
you
die
Sometimes we gotta remember it’s a non real cartoon💔😭
As soon as you mentioned the stomach noises I was like oh, "this is some fetish stuff then" and then the movie went on and I was very right. I have been on the internet long enough to know it when I see it.
I remember watching the 2010 Marmaduke movie as a kid. It was bad in a way that ironically grew on me. This one is just bad
6:14 could you say they were putting there marmadukes up?
6:13 they gonna Marma-DUKE IT OUT 🔥🔥
Who’s here after “fixed” was created 😂
Bro why is Pinocchio zesty!💀
Them: how many times have you watched this video  Me: yes
0:28  that’s a little too generous
9:59 wdym again?
wtf is this movie 😭
Maybe they can get Jack Black for the reboot 😂
18:26 BRIAN LOOK OUT
The fact that Pete Davidson sounded ten times more interested playing Petey in the Dog Man movie is crazy 😭
18:49 and credits the end
13:55 my grand ma put it on while i was a kid . i was uncomfortable
0:11 father when can I leave to be on my own💅💅💅
The woo sound effects were funny af
13:35 WHY AM I LAUGHING SO HARD
11:18 “the NOT SO GREAT DANE😢” IM LAYUGHONG SO HARDDDDD
Sigh, APOY would've loved the scene.
Two hated animated dog movies on Netflix, and they happen to have the same-looking dog antagonist. I'm of course referring to this movie, and comparing it to Fixed.
My like maybe 6 or 7 year old brother loved this movie
14:46 I AM THE KING IF THE WORLD I still wanna win the dog show tho 😢
Wait, I thought the family would like him again for making them money so why would he run away?
The trainer barks
9:12 Someone on the team likes inflation 🫩
marmaduke looking like he injected three liters of synthol oil into his body
Didn't mean emoji
8:05 ISHOWSPEED AHHH😊
Ah
Warning: do not try to fall asleep to this unless you want about a 14 minute nap 😂
I think you seriously need to watch the live action marmaduke
Best part of the movie: marmaduke getting beat the shit up and almost dying
3 years later why is no one talking about how JK Simmons is in this lmao  What horrible shit did the producers have against him
10:26 Arkham Knight's cloudburst scene be like
The 2010 live action Marmaduke is so much better
I'm honestly surprised that Danny didn't mention that this movie is based on a long-running comic. Also the part of Marmaduke getting beaten a lot by the trainer is most likely meant to be like a martial arts movie, though it comes in a weird way since he's literally a dog.
first
Danny you probably don’t even have 50 million power on rise of kingdoms
That movie keeps me with no way how to react, in a awful way. 😑
“Father, when can I leave to be on my own. 😩🫦💅”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Why is he so zesty?!?! 😂💀😭🙏
I was listening to my phone in the background when this came on so i wasnt looking at the screen when he mentioned marmaduke so when i heard you mentioned it was poorly recived i was sad because i remeber liking the movie as a kid, and then i looked at the screen when you mentioned the animation b3cause i remeber thinking it wasnt that bad only to realize that you were talking about something new that came out.  Just checked that was poorly recived to but whatever i was a kid obly thing i remeber is the sewers collapising or something along the line of that but it does look a whole hell of a lot better
They released a 2003 animated movie in 2022 😭🙏
4:17 how much water is supposed to be in that pool?!!?
I’m not that grey, what does this really mean?
The live action is good
I never laughed so hard at a dog dying oml
Do you think its worse then plan bee
and then they dropped k pop demon hunters
I keep seeing posts about movies or shows my teacher shows us att school, this is one of them.
5:20 racist (I’m kidding)
Father when can I leave to be on my own 🫦💅
i used to love this movie
This movie needs to go on the Shredder
I know I'm late to the party but... J. K. Simmons was the villain dog..?! Brian Hull was Guy..?! And of all the directors, they chose Mark A. Z. Dippé..? The director of Spawn..?! 😶🫂💙💙💙
I have some advice stick with the live action Marmaduke movie
18:48 yay
0:10 why is dude whining
Love the vid danny
That bulldog could humble Yujiro.
Why do I recognize you but have no idea who u r or what u do
Have you ever seen indonesian movie called “merah putih one for all”?😊
My grandparents and aunt put this movie on for my toddler cousins.
bruh id zeus jk simmons 💀
16:19 Zapped was filmed at my school in 2014
12:04 marmaduke made the next Chernobyl
6:49 My guy, it’s not that important but you showed the same clip of the dog sitting in the sofa chair like 5 times and you’re saying he doesn’t know how to sit! Poor dog 😢. But seriously, good video dude, it made me laugh a lot.
The animated one pissed me off because there's a actually good movie called marmuduke but thats what they based the designs on but changed everything else
0:53  the original marmaduke (not animated) was f**king goated
I laughed more watching this then I laughed at the actual movie
3 years later Pete isn't bad at all of an actor, he was good Mirage in Transformers to be honest!
They dragged Pete Davidson into this?
then: quality cgi immersion  now: profit
10:42 one time as a puppy my dog pooped directly into a guest’s shoe and that was pretty funny tbh 😭 like u have to aim pretty good to do that
not the end credits looking better than the whole ass movie 💀
I’ve met people who actually like this movie
The title aged well.
What the pre production
His face in the thumbnail is filled with disappointment 😂
I’m so mad Zeus is voiced by the same guy who did Stanford Pines and now he’s been PERMANENTLY ruined for me all because of this stupid dog movie >:,[
What about K pop demon hunter's
Hey marmaduke is good and I’m 15
4:56 no way my name is also guy /srs /nj
Wait have I seen this before
Marmaduke shitting himself is Chernobyl 2
Anything Pete Davidson is in I already despise
lol I watched it
Yes Netflix is making it Horrible
"So the dog trainer isnt actually the villain" Also the dog trainer: *Brutally tortures a family dog and charges that same family more money than  the money than the amount of money the family is trying to get, without refunds. Not only that, but he is a famous dog trainer, so who knows how many more times he did this to other dogs and families*
7:58 maybe it’s kind of like how Calvin talks to Hobbes in Calvin and hobbes
3:28 OMG PEARL SU NOSE
I’m Greg😊
I clicked on this video expecting some bad movie I’d never seen before  Then I was greeted with that god forsaken movie I had to watch in class over the course of a few days for a lesson.
The characters look like they r from TD drama
I don't think Netflix makes movies, then again, Netflix is a streaming platform.
I don't think Netflix makes movies, then again, Netflix is a streaming platform.
AGREED
ARMENIA MENTIONED
5:58 is he just avatar now?
This is a remake of a decently okay movie
I watched this movie once when I was at my mimi’s house cause we usually watch random movies she finds on Netflix and this was honestly not one of the favorites lol
The live action one was fine I think.
I was 15 years old when i saw this movie in class. i dont know what year i was in, but the movie was bad. i didn't like how Corey it was or how the ending was the dog blowing ass to save the day.
This guy punched a hole in the wall with ease 🙏🥹 we miss you Danny
Your like the human form of comedy
9:23 Fart is air. I suppose the implication here is that his stomach somehow got extremely full of air.
I was foers to watch this movie in class one time and I'm still scared
Does anyone know im here?
6:02 Yes, thunder is clouds. Thank you, Marmaduke (2022 film).
why are you a grown man complaining about kids movies
18:08 d..did they just run out of frames? Why is that animation so snappy? Ew. Was this animated in MMD??
2:46 GOOOD DAMN, THAT'S A BONUS POINT FOR A MOVIE 🔥🔥🔥 (movie is still negative dogshit (punchline intended))
14:05 he looks like a fucking parmite from odd world when he talks, is this a dog or an alien?
gacha fetish videos in 2018:
He not a loser he a nuclear power force
4:35 "Tidal Wave"?....
My cousin's parents literally threaten them with this movie
18:35  SO GODDAMN CORNY OF A SCENE
10:09 STOP IT THERE GIVING IDEAS FOR DEVIANT ARTISTS!!!!
Apparently there’s a live action movie made in 2010 do with that information what you will
This video holds up so well.. This movie is still A S S, it helps the video hold up so well lol
Fun fact: the daughter is actually played by Erin Fitzgerald, she’s was chie satonaka in Persona 4 and Alkaid in .hack GU
They did live action marmaduke wrong
Wasn’t the live action of Marmaduke really bad too? Why would they think an animated one would be any better?
0:40 subtle forshadowing
This movie only managed to remind me to the 2010 Marmaduke live-action's existance.
marmadukes song had a nice artstyle but the 3d style was just awful to look at
“Ah oh!” — Marmaduker
I’m sorry but the animation and the drawings make me so uncomfortable especially in that one scene where marmaduke eats a lot and and his stomach grows it just makes me so uneasy 😟
Who do you think should’ve played Marmaduke?  Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey?  I personally would choose Adam Sandler.
Bruh what is this movie 💀💀💀
liked this movie the first couple times I saw it like right when it came out…..now I’m seeing how bad it is. What was younger me on
I have watched it and I am 11
A-a what. 4:24
Is the cat’s Marmaduke’s boyfriend?
13:20 "YOU STUPID FUCKING DOG" got me bro 😭
21:01 the angle is crazy
the answer is yes
you don't know how funny this shit is at 3am
i thought that was scooby doo
18:08 the animators got tired at this part
who remembers the old marmaduke? like the live one
I can’t believe this movie wasn’t animated by the same animation studio that made the Addams family- they look too similar😭
My math teacher put this movie on for movie day because we finished our project and she was proud of us. I’m not gonna lie. This shit was so ass.
Yug
13:21
When he said: "diggity dang that dog" I genuinely though he was going to say: "Deputy-Dawg-dog-a-ding-dang-depadepa"
Ah yes, the three body types: slenderman, fatphobia, and A S S
We watched this movie in class in 5th grade. The entire time all I was thinking was “whose idea was this? Why does our teacher hate us? Why else would she make us watch this?”
Bro why the fuck is J. K. SIMMONS IN THIS MOVIE (he’s zeus)
why the dogs hitting a whole domain expansion
Wtf this is so gross is fr
why does this guy remind me of @yikes
"THE SUN IS GONNA EXPLODE IN 0.001 SECONDS" "DIGGITY DANG THAT DOG"
Apparently marmaduke was actually a live action movie that released in the 90s or early 2000s
They butchered the og movies name w this one
Haven't even heard of this movie , and the normal " good " movies are so bad already , it was hard to watch this entire video alone , ofcource won't watch any clip of that movie by myself
A girl and a dog gettingpthis
Boo boo a movie sucks
What a masterpiece of trash Wtf Netflix seriously? Using hide expert vpn to survive this mess
when i first watched this movie, it was absolute torture. its like having your eyes being peeled open for eternity
Now i really wanna see Danny review the live-action Marmaduke movie starring Owen Wilson
Their first mistake was naming him marmaduke
My nephew is obsessed with this movie and I have to babysit him as my job. It’s… it’s not fun having to watch this over and over again
13:51 My little sister came up and saw I was watching this, and went, "You're watching Marmaduke? It's so sad!" 😭🤚
The farting scene was so fun to me   Just because how ridiculous it was
This is something that looks like an AI film.  Why... did it go from Marmaduke being so skinny... into having this huge belly?! 💀 8:57 Like they're not even hiding it, this is just fetish
I have seen this movie
Fr I hated marmaduke I was horrible
Should call this "Marmapuke"
It sure seems that way!
13:03 rewatching this vid made me realize that “food” and “dog food” are two separate things, which implies the dog trainer is billing them almost 50k in his own food bills 😂
I watched it. Not cause it looked good cause I was interested 13:59
flint Lockwood ahh 3:25
i thought that was Scooby-Doo ngl
That's just a rip off Scooby-Doo
“First type of guy” the log ride is over Grug “second type of guy” *marmaduke what a have you done*
Pete Davidson's role in James Gunn's "Suicide Squad" movie explains everything hilarious about that movie.  Can't put it any more simply than that.
4:45 he saw the towers collapse and said “that damn dog…”
Is this a joke? Like what even is this garbage? Using hide expert vpn to survive this mess
the bad movies are so the mediocre movies seem far better by comparison
I saw this movie a while back and it was so unsatisfactory I had to go watch another movie to recover from it to be chill again
Netflix makes the moves ever. Their movies are so I always at them every time I watch them. They have such actors, and such writers, and cinema
3:26 literally me bro
Серьезно они пытаются выиграть награды за худшее? Использую hide expert vpn на всякий случай
Queso story 9:34
6:54 🏃
The f dog 4:37
Curiously, the movie's plot could serve as a Family Guy episode where the Griffin family has to train Brian for a dog show and Brian ends up ruining it
"When can I live on my OWNnNnNnN" Never heard a character that sounded more gay lollll
why a mother fucking dog fart so badly ts pmo 💔🥀
I watched this movie without knowing how bad it was
Netflix has this most useless item in the game too many log in attempts
Something funnier that’s bad for a dog to do is start a fire, my dog did it, she set the boiler on fire
18:38 roll credits
I once watched this movie and I struggled to get the through the movie without cringing out
11:54 crazy to make the sympathetic main character a blue-eyed blonde white girl and the villain bullies all poc
this kind of honestly felt like a lot of poorly hidden kinks from the director all smushed horribly into one nightmare movie
Wtf what nonsense is this… Im watching with hide expert so I don’t lose my mind
4:53 underrated joke
Has not gotten any better.
thank you for your sacrifice Danny
This is Foodfight tier
Danny there is one small problem Marmaduke is also a comic strip from 1954 And a movie from 2010 I don’t think it was Netflix that made this
11:33 that girl on the right was actually AT the show
6:51 that one old guy in Chainsaw Man be like
The was a movie in like 2010 with the same whole concept of some huge silly dog but it was like the Air Buddies movies where all the dogs could talk for some reason and it looked really bad. It was just a super shitty rip-off of Beverly Hills Chihuahua
marmaduke more like...  MARMADOOKIE HAHAHAHAHAH GET IT1!?1??1!1?1 GET IT?1!?1?1?1!1?
This is peak nonsense like they’re trying to fail? Using hide expert vpn to survive this trash
Hey Danny, there’s a live action version of Marmaduke
13:45 very much not innocent
i was born in 8942 on the sun and i hate Netflix in general
2:34 this is the best part of this whole video
18:23 uh oh then gets critically injured
4:24  Is that a geometry dash reference???!?!?
i was actually forced to watch this with my class a few years ago
Why do you look like the kid from spies in disguise? 😂
6:22 "I'm kickin that dog, I'm kickin that do-"      -The Boys
21:16  No
I grew up on the original Marmaduke movie. I'm too scared to even watch the animated one...
this looks like some weird ass kids content from youtube
I think I remember a live action maraduke movie from when I was a kid
This has got to be a joke right? Use hide expert vpn to survive this mess
7:37  WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87?!
I watched this movie with my sister a while back for our friday pizza night and had already seen just about everything on Netflix so we gave it a try. I had so many things to say about it that i’ve NEVER had that many negative comments about a movie. The animation is uncomfortable, acting is horrible, plot is just bad, characters are weird, the list goes on and on. Basically, I agree with you on this.
was marmaduke from this or was it before this? because I keep seeing references to marmaduke and it doesn't make sense to me because why would anyone mention this ever
WHAT YPE OF DOG FOOD WAS THE GUY USING THAT WAS WORTH 1.4 MIL
The fact that I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid yet still kinda agrees with with this video is crazy
17:24 Anyone know the song used here?
"rich and british" what do you mean dawg
I watched this movie as a kid, but it was live action and WAY better 😅
13:46
0:10 “father, when can I love to be on my own?” Sent me lmao
Marmaduke is PEAK
And then the funny thing two years ago I was forced to watch this movie all the time because I went to this daycare camp, and those little kids on it to watch it all the time I swear it was torture🥲💀
im in love with you i think
Pete Davidson should never be cast as the voice actor for a cartoon dog. A cartoon cat, on the other hand…
Danny, why do you keep switching up?  One moment you’re hating on Marmaduke.  The other you’re feeling sympathetic for him.
Who’s here in 2025?
The mom can get it
I watched it and I am a child it sucked
If you think that movie is bad, you should see Leo the lion, specifically the 2005 version.
OH NAH THEY GOT MARMADUKE (there is a better live action version, and they just rebooted Marmaduke)
consider: they're attempting to flood the market with intentionally shitty movies to lower the standard from critics, allowing mediocre movies to gain higher ratings and show a perceived spike on the charts in a few years
13:57 well..Actually in 2nd grade my teacher made our class watch it for Easter…
What are they talking about? We sold one price that said five dollars.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I only clicked on this video to point out Danny photoshopped his face on the thumbnail to make it look worse.  Awesome detail man!
Danny, I feel the need to tell you that there is a live action Marmaduke. I am not saying this to scare you, it is actually really good and not quite like this movie. It has character development, romance, and a good villain. Although, the beginning is about how Marmaduke is not a good listener but it gets way better! Definitely should check out if you want a good watch
i watched this movie while eating my breakfast and to be honest its kinda good! only thing i hate is that mom design.
I watched it at my school 💀
i watched this movie A WHILE back and do NOT remember watching it. At all. on my netflix it was all the way to the end. WHEN DID I WATCH IT?!
My friend said this is her favourite movie but then agin she serports trump is rasist and homaphobic transphobic so that makes sense
I actually watched marmaduke once for a movie night and I didn’t know it had 0 on rotten tomatoes until like a year later
Why is there a cut 5:17
the thin characters have the legs of a praying mantis
you should watch the live action Marmaduke made it 2010. I watched it when I was little and all I can remember is that it is an odd movie and marmaduke almost dies, then he enters a surfing compitition.
I watched this and as soon as I saw the animation I just wanted to vomit and guess what this was at my daycare Curiosity Corner and they wanted us to watch this piece of dog poopoo.
2:39 that is a literal stickman
This movie came out on my birthday
Lol putting the sponsor at the end is respectable
Rewatching this video and the list on the bill has both "food" and "dog food" separately
I've watched this before
13:54 me and my whole entire class watched this
Was watching a video about the Garfield movies then remembered this video existed. Felt like watching it again so obviously I searched for drew gooden.
the villain dog is SO ugly tho. Neck like a giraffe, really thick eyebrows, and just generally is really weird.
I wasn't expecting that you're being too harsh on poor Marmaduke explosion goes off
marmalade is fine😭😭😭
mam this is ten times worst than G,s dollhouse
6:51 Sisyphus prime be like
To be fair Marmaduke is the worst dog in the world in this series of comics and movies. Legitimately a nightmare dog that ruins everything. If he died it would legitimately be a FUNNY ending and a dog DIES lmaoo. That is no small feat to achieve that in a movie. A movie where the worst dog in entertainment dies, the credits roll and the audience is shocked in a way that leaves them amused and genuinely pleased. Worse than Kujo and Kujo had rabies. No idea why the hypnotism dog disnt just hypnotize more to.prevent disqualification.
4:14 daem mini!? And how much is water inside there?
0:08 “father when can I love to be on my OwHn???”😫😩
0:08 “father when can I love to be on my OwHn???”😫😩
So everybody just going to ignore how zesty he sounds 0:09
The small cheerleader can actually be seen at the dog show
This is exactly the kind of garbage movie my sister and I love to watch on tubi. they're all like fake movies riding disney's coattails which were originally in like German or something then dubbed into english. tubi is truly a landfill of unwatchable animated kids movies.
19:55 now here's a pov I'm familiar with.
This is the first ever Danny video I watched, i now rewatch it every year
He seems genuinely disappointed in not only Netflix but also me because of the movie
i feel like there's not enough noise about the fact that the shimmery dog is voiced by J.K. Simmons
Pete Davidson did not give a fuck about this movie and u can tell just comparing the voice acting in Marmaduke to the voice acting in Dog Man 💀
absolutely love how 0% effort was made in this movie. like the horrible animation or writing aside, I love how people think about dog shows and how they work… no conformation (the showing part) competition has obedience as part of it, those are different events entirely. conformation is just all the dogs getting judged on appearance basically. also there is NO money in dog sports lol. anyone who shows or competes with their dogs do it for the passion and it DRAINS your wallet. that being said some trainers really do try to bankrupt people so that’s probably the one part of this that’s realistic

I watch 1 or 2 years ago and it was funny when he kept farting
i saw this movie in school, the only part me and my classmates were interested in was that one really small and cute fluffy dog in that one race
🎵I want that doggy yes, right now. I don't want a cat that goes meow. I don't want a bird or a fat old cow. I want that dog bowwow🎵
17:23 Why is no one talking about this 😂😂😂😂
HOLLYWOOD: Why? Because WE PHUCKENG HATE YOU ALL!
“DAD, THE SOVIETS HAVE THE NUKE BLUEPRINTS!” “Diggity dang that dog!”
I hate this
Pete definitely made up for this horrible dog movie with an amazing dog movie.
original mamarduke is better
So I got an ad for Melanie Martinez' leeches music video. I was invested, didnt skip it, def emotional. When it was over, screen went black, then it instantly cut back to Danny talking about a mini tsunami in the backyard.
I am Greg Greg is me
Yo Danny bring these vids back I’m literally crying 😂😂
13:56 I watched it because it was the only thing I had downloaded on the way to France 😭😭😭
4:45 I’m surprised you didn’t talk about how much water was in there, it was like those infinite water sources in Minecraft.
This is a jack black movie
I SUBBED AND TURNED ON NOTIFS, I'M GREGGGGGGG!!!1!!!!!!!!!!11!1!!
19:25 “Im da biggest bird”
6.9 million.
Make a p2
9:12 I love when the writers barely disguised fetish  I don’t even have an ending to this joke I just have to make it clear that this is absolutely someone’s fetish being put into a movie for kids
Pete Davidson should of been Garfield tell me I’m wrong
The animation in this is offensively bad
The original marmaduke was a live action with CGI for the animals, I loved the original. (btw it came out in 2010) Netflix just ruined it.
guy be like “I can fix him!” bro he caused a tsunami u can’t do dogdung 💀
Omg. I recognized this movie and didn’t know why. Just remembered, in middle school they actually had us watch this on a free day. Yeah I remember thinking how weird it was.
Pete’s acting in this movie compared to Dogman is like night and day oh my god
The live action marmaduke isnt bad, its cringy but its funnt for a kid lol I liked it when I was younger
This guy should make a movie
15:34  DOMAIN EXPANSION, HALF RAP!!!!!!!!!!!!
10:42 IF THEY SHIT ON THE CEILING IT WOULD BE QUITE FUNNY
Atleast netflix gave us nimona as an apology
Zeus is voiced by J. K. Simmons.             How’d they get him into this film?
2:40 so funny😅
This feels weird knowing Greek mythology
Guys…this movie is a fetish for so many people…think hard…inflation, flatulence, degradation, scat…it’s all there…all it’s missing is feet…then we’d just be able to confirm this movie is just fetish content
The fart cloud scene and Marmaduke's expression during it is extremely disturbing and makes me nauseous. I also think it's someone's fetish, on the writing team, not even a joke.
The dog movie, has a similar plot to a MUCH better movie called Runt. It's an Australian movie about a family with not a lot of money, so the little girl gets the idea to earn money by having her dog Runt win dog contests. I haven't seen it in a hot minute so I don't remember every detail, but it was very heartwarming, and I may have cried.
How the hell did they even let Marmaduke go to the next dog show. You would expect them to, you know, ban the dog that caused a whole area to be uninhabitable
Romans 3:23, 6:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord  John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life
movie was so bad he called us gray
Why does everyone have sticks for limbs!? 🤣
This movie actually looks like some fetish thing you would find on deviantart
for some reason my is just wired to like any comedy/animated movie even if its a piece of crap like if i watch something thats equally as bad as marmaduke my brain says "yeah i like this" even though i know its bad
13:53 I had to watch this in summer school I blasted my ears with music instead
The only good thing about it is the Siamese cat
0:38 Foreshadowing.
3:20 "maybe we need to enroll him in obedience scho-" literally dies
4:38 is literally 20 times funnier than the entire movie
Thank goodness Transformers: rise of the beasts and Dog man gave Pete Davidson a redemption arc.
This video marks the one year anniversary of my greghood. July 16th every year is my greg birthday. My birthgreg
I saw this movie in my local movie theatre. They were selling tickets to this movie at lower prises. They called it a special offer for low-income  families.  I'm sad for them. I don't know if dub made the film worse or not.
I watched it like 2 years ago
My teacher made the whole class watch this
0:12 😂
NOOOOO MARMADUKE U WERE IN A FETISH FILM POORLY DESGIUSED AS A CHILDRENS MOVIE NOOOOOOOOOO
lol My cousins and I would always watch this movie whenever we could to annoy our family
18:09 is that JK Simmons?? They put JK Simmons in this garbage fire of a movie??? No no it cant be gim, its just someone who spunds kike him. I looked it up. IT'S  HIM!!!
"It ends with an original song by Pete Davidson-"  ad plays "MY NECK, MY BACK-"
i just need to vent how angry i am MY QUALITY IS SO BAD AND ITS LAGGY UGH
I'm shocked that Pete Davidson apparently CAN voice act via Dog man.   So confirms this was JUST a paycheck.
This movie was based on a comic
13:53 sadly this is untrue. once my younger brothers find a movie they like, they watch it religiously for the next six months. marmaduke was one of their favorites …🤢
How is every character literally so ugly
These are probably for people who have some fetishes
7:52 it could be that there are certain characters able to speak to marmaduke, and it would make sense if the trainer was one of them cuz he's so connected to dogs
To be fair, Marmaduke is one of the dumbest comic strips ever made
the live action marmaduke from the 2000s was the movie i specifically remember being on the Dvds of movies you actually wanted to watch. like when you’d pop the dvd in and it would show you the trailers and adverts for other movies that were out, i for some reason specifically remember marmaduke, specifically that cheesy commercial voice guy saying “Marmaduke” in his iconic dvd voice. am i the only one?
I loved that old comic, but the movie  was a huge disappointment
after hearing pete davidsons amazing voice acting work in DogMan, im convinced he just knew this movie was gonna suck ass and put in no effort
"A One Cool Animation Production" was insane
Maybe Guy actually CAN talk to Marmaduke because he's supposed to be a Ceasar Milan type of guy. Aka, the DOG WHISPERER.  But they forgot to make / cut that joke and just kinda glossed over it.
It's so funny watching this after watching the movie dogman. Pete Davidson voices a character in that and he does (in my opinion) an incredible job, he definitely does a much better job than he did here. It's just funny to see how good he can be at voicing an animated animal when he actually gives a shit.
sadly my 8 yr old little sister has watched this show 😔😔😔
15:35 why did the dog do a domain expansion 💀
ngl this miss the old ass live action Marmaduke
Anyone else here because of dogman
Pete has managed to redeem himself by being in a good dog movie (Dog Man)
The SCP Foundation should contain this dog
12:19- 12:27 Did Danny punch the wall for a bit? Cool.
10:10 “And he farts and he sh!ts” got me rolling
No just no 17:24
This isn’t Ju-jitsu Kaisen 15:36
I have watched this movie but I turned it off because it was gross
3:29 hear me out
21:40
why does your head look like that
Always forgetting that Danny has some next level brows.
Watch the non-cartoon version it’s way better ❤
It was a live-action movie
Cody Hales: I called this white dog an JK simmons because the actor is look the same.   Danny: bro seriously bruh this is the real name dog Zeus - 8:19
I really be going through it in life right now and I'm so tired and fed up with everything, but Danny's videos are part of my "what part of life isn't so horrible because it feels like everything is' routine every night, and for once i'm not mad Youtube keeps suggesting videos that are 2+ years old
Ngl the parts when his belly was huge/ and when he farted remind me of fetish content..
i swear i have seen you somewhere
Why did Guy's outfit change?
“bouncing egg” 😭 the ‘b’ was so aggressive
7:55 I think Marmeduke does understand English but the Trainer knows how to speak dog and is able to have a full conversation with him
The strangest thing is I think this is supposed to be a reboot of the live action version. And I don't remember there being a dog show as part of the plot of the original, but I'm also not wasting time to watch the other version to solidify that claim.
2:15  *despicable me ahh body builds*
fun fact: Marmaduke is also a 2010 live action movie... It... also didn't do... too well, but to me it's microscopically better
Why does the female in marmaduke thick
2:19  Me: *tf is this*
Why is Scooby Doo pregnant, man?😭
Is no-one going to mention the near perfect VFX shot @12:21
16:07 they may make hypnosis look like magic in the movie but in real life hypnosis is a legit thing. Nothing fascinates me  more than the fact that some people can literally be controlled like puppets.  My school had prom for juniors and seniors. We are a small school so this isn’t probably as insane a sit sounds to others with grades with over 100s of students. My senior graduating class had maybe 50 students total.  Each year we had a hypnotist for our after prom. And I have never laughed so hard in my life watching some people in my grade so the absolute most insane shit ever. Like the class clowns volunteered for it, which guarantees entertainment.  You put a naturally hilarious in the control of a hypnotist and you can create beautiful scenarios. My personal favorite was when the hypnosis told one of the boys he was “warning everyone that the British were coming” while she told the other boy “that there was a bee and it wouldn’t leave him alone”. And these two boys were best friend and absolutely ridiculous in real life so it ended with them yelling at each other. The one kept swatting at an invisible  bee and freaking out about it while the other kept grabbing his shoulder and saying very loudly “the British are coming!”  So when Bee guy wouldn’t listen and kept frantically saying “theirs a bee! It just made British boy even more frustrated. Resulting in an argument that I’ll never forget.  And these two have no memory of this happening, I still have a video of it though.
The original marmaduke movie, the real life one, was good. At least it is in my memories from when I was 10 and I don’t want to revisit and realize it’s not 😂 So Im Sticking with my belief it was actually good.
Anyone else remember the live action Marmaduke?
I sware that dog is a bio weapon
Lowkey do the emoji movie I couldn’t even finish it because it was so bad
HELP I WAS FORCED TO WATCH TIS WITH MY SISTERS ONCE AND HATED EVERY SECOND OF IT
do a review on dog town 2
I watched that movie with my mom, i regret
not all are bad
We watched this in our school sadly
Well yes
Like in The Producers, they make bad movies on purpose to get the revenue.
This is straight up a fetish movie like what the FUCK??? Why are children watching this???
7:48 his ear clips through the window
This movie looks like it was made in 2007. And it would've been just as bad received then
Isnt there a live action one
I actually liked this movie
I think I was forced to watch this movie when I was in school-
Even google did the corporate soulless style better than this
Help after watching that
6:05 the guys legs are SO small 😭
they let Pete Davidson voice another cartoon animal 😭😭
just had whiplash hearing pete davidson's name associated with a movie like this so soon after watching the dog man movie- a cat was a much better role for him ig lol
I almost died but IS THERE FOOD
FA(moans) THER wh(moans)en can I leave to be on my o(moans)wn
Don’t sware to god
After watching this video i went and looked at some of the Marmaduke comics and honestly they're really wholesome and sweet. I would've loved an adatotion of it that was just kinda homie and sweet and down to earth. Y'know a cozy film like secret of Nimph or All dogs go to heaven. Missed opportunity tbh.
Jokes on my family then, bc they somehow enjoyed it
They're making em for you and Drew btw. I asked
12:21 i thought that was real… WHY DID I THINK THAT WAS REAL?
i remember watching this one time and never again
This video smells like farts!!!!!!! Dislike!
Ok but if at the end Marmaduke realizes just how overpowered all the other dogs are and decides to lead a revolution against all of their owners  Just saying, with all the powers on display at the show, they would practically be unstoppable
Marmaduke is good
There has been one (and ONLY one) time in my life that dog poo was funny.  My dog ate a pair of my underwear, his poop was like a poop emoji 💩 but there was almost no poop. It was as if he had sculpted 💩 out of underwear.   Real talk though, he must have worked real hard on both ends of that task.
i think marmaduke 2022 is just an animated version of the old one
marmalade duke of a stupid workout dog
19:49 nah bro, AH HELL NAH
Marmaduke was always the worst comic strip anyway
I whacked this movie it was so wired
I watched this movie like 7 times- 5 times in class….
Hold on, I'm pretty sure I saw this movie...
ong ive seen this movie before like a long time ago but I do NOT remember the quality bring this bad
over the headge had better qualitly and story
I think his fanbase name should be GEG.
Nightmare fule at 8:13 bro fully stands up straight at the end slow it to 25% speed
I swear the only good Movie that ever came from Netflix is Invader Zim enter the florpus
marmaduke is actully the one making stealing data legal (my thouths)
The original movie is far superior of that swap
That bulldog is 100% accurate
i'm a greg
2:27 😂😂😂🤣
Why do u look like “guy”?
OWn 😩
"fathurr when can i leave to be on my owwnuh"  -Pinnochio
My teacher made my class watch this movie
That dog show is the Chernobyl exclusion zone 2.0
Pixar? More like Thiccxar, am I right?
I don’t even think the original was good
Bro, what is up with the hypno dog's eyebrows.
a...... Tidal Wave?
the cgi genuinely looks like a 2000s commercial 😭
Stop yelling at the microphone Danny!!!!!
can we mention how ugly the cat is.. it litterally looks like an alien
Guy is so thin
I had watched it like, 2 years ago lol😂
I wonder how many of the film making companies have gone woke.
10:08 TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING!
Netflix has zero value in 2025. Only a brainless NPC would pay for this service in the 2020s.
Inside job ❌ Marmaduke ✅
Danny should post versions of all his videos that’s just an unedited camera angle from the side of him filming
why do they always draw moms as thicc why??
there is a maraduke movie that i watched growing up it was my favourite it wasn’t an animation and i swear for kids it was the best, this one hurts to watch knowing how good the old one is
Watching this after throwing up feels awesome! 🤩🦭
I think Danny saying that he doesn’t know if Pete Davidson knows he’s in this movie is perhaps the funniest thing I’ve heard come out of a human’s mouth for the last year
0:09 Father when can i leave to be on my oWn💅💅
7:58 I choked and almost died while eating a carrot at this part but it was worth it
i can see this movie being ok if it were animated like 19:23 and if all farts were cut out of it. and it was released it the 90s or tried to replicate that style. and marmaduke won the dog show by doing something insane
this movie is just “family suffers from dogs fart problem”
L earther
When i heard Jk Simmons' voice, i was absolutely APPALLED. How on EARTH did they get him on THIS?
The live action Marmaduke that came out long before this crap was actually a really decent movie
5:14 is that William Afton?
This is so funny ha ha ha
20:17 ok but like cant they see your brosing history too?
I love this movie, not gonna lie
Marmaduke is a good movie
Man is I watched this movie but never knew it I’d think it’s good because I don’t know what’s a good movie and what’s a bad movie😭
How does this movie look like it was made in 2010
We all make mistakes in life it’s nothing drastic honestly
Crazy how the bee was the best designed character in this movie
man the "eerily slender" character really is built like Slenderman huh
19:53 👁👁just pretend im not here
The scene where he farts and shits in the cup felt like borderline fetish material 😭😭😭 whoever made this movie needs to get slapped
I remember i was in a after school program and we had to watch this movie and we couldn’t talk or anything and there was these kindergartners in the back just laughing hysterically and it was SOOOOO annoying and the snacks we had there where Scooby snacks and nachos ( Ngl the nachos where pretty good )
My guess would be yes. Because people will still watch them, and then make videos like this to promote them, which will draw in even more people to watch them. Meaning that they can make money with minimal effort. And the fact that this video has over ten million views proves that platform works.
4:17 it not that bad like bro is picking on the movie chill out it just a movie but it is bad I will give it -4/10
Fun Fact: The animator who animated the ending credits made a seal version of the Romeo and Juliet Movie in 2006. I wish you could review that movie.
My teacher made my class watch this since we got a good note from the sub teacher
Yes
The animation looks like something from a foreign dvd in a Dollar General barrel.
13:54 Trust me, there's been kids who watched this movie. When this came out when I was in 7th grade they turned it on in a auditorium full of middle schoolers. i almost cried.
isnt there a live action marmaduke??
Danny.... cartoons today are bad because an adult expect a child to watch it, not us who are mid 20s
Bro I love how when Danny hates something he makes a whole joke out of it. The worst part is that the joke is accurate
Yeehaw
"worst movie you'll see this year" as the first one i'll see this year! perfect
My entire class picked this movie a while ago, safe to say we all hated it
Im the biggest dog around
You're just hating to hate
Is this some sort of ripoff (or adaptation) of the 2010 move also called Marmaduke? It had a somewhat similar plot and the dogs look very alike😭
how is the quality so low omg
This is some wonder of u shit
love that pov in the product placement
I think the last good technically (and shamefully) Netflix movie is Nimona, that movie is so good that Netflix doesn’t deserve to get a single penny from it
3:55
It feels like some one sandpapered my eyes
The pOonocio movie is trying to be sexual
It irks me that Marmaduke makes that.. *face* when farting on the trophy  10:14 10:15
I was forced to watch this movie once and being a big fan of Gravity falls and other stuff with Jk Simmons in it I was so sad when I saw that he was in this movie😭
Danny, Bro, imagine Netflix makes these movies on purpose so that they get attention from you and then your fans go watch it themselves??? Think about it. It worked on me.
This movie makes me wanna eat a dog
7:49 I swear, the dog's left ear clipping through the curtains is pissing me off.
(Glass breaks) 12:12
I bet blockbuster is cheaper than that subscription from netflix
"so mr piccolo what are we gonna learn today? are we gonna learn ki blasts or cool martial arts moves or-" "DODGE!"
this has the video quality of the octonauts. (A video in the series, not even the movie)  I’m not saying octonauts is bad, I’m just saying the animating quality.
19:30 shame on you, Mark Dippiè
4:24 is that a gd refrence??
The 2010 Marmaduke is always going to be one of my favourite movies (because it’s a childhood memory and I have weird taste), and this Marmaduke did it NO JUSTICE and I see NO ONE IN THE COMMENTS TALKING ABOUT IT!! DOES ANYONE REMEMBER IT?! The one with Owen Wilson!!
everytime someone compares my dog to marmaduke i think of this video and a tear slips out of my eye
The music at the end 💀
Moana 2 it looks like they did the whole thing in the dark
DANNY OML I LOVE THE VIOLENT SCREEMING SCENES- ( Why? Idk. )
⁶
I just realized the picture of Danny drinking Milk is him using a inhaler.
This movie’s animation style is atrocious looking
I don’t think I’ve ever seen such bad animation in  movie. Like how did we go from The Mitchells vs. the Machines to this..😭
I watched this at my grandma's house- she somehow low-key liked it and I did too. It was when it frist came out yall-
I rate it -infinity
0:36 they did the mom dirty I only have one word😭 GYATT
i had to watch Marmaduke in school one time. i was bored as hell😭
Can we talk about how the voice actor for zeus if J K Simmons? I thought i was going crazy when i heard the voice but i looked it up and its really him. What
I actually liked marmaduke 😭 Ok edit I saw the realistic version of marmaduke. It was so much better
Pixar mom syndrome 💀
agree dude i sawed the movie once but it's soo bad the characters built and the animations was ackward and stupid i honestly hate that movie.
Wasn’t this a book with a very different plot? I distinctly remember that damn dog
in 6th grade i had a substitute turn this on and it was the most mind numbing thing ever it actually gave me a migrane
At least Pete Davidson will do a better job as a orange cat
The fact that i watched this in 3rd or 4th
Putting their deuces up, I love how white you are😂😂
The angle for the sponsor is kinda insane ngl
They played this movie at my school
My cousin used to talk about how good this movie was and when I was watching it with her because I had nothing to do, i said this movie is bad and she said “because you don’t like it you don’t have to make fun of it”
Why must every child show have some inflation fetish nowadays?
pinocchio sounding gay as hell.. no hate though ⁉️✨
10:11 Shrek tier farts
It just looks like one of the many 1000s of shitty videos on youtube meant to brain rot toddlers
I’ve read the book,seeing it at a local library,getting curious and I don’t know if there’s other books but if there’s not this is nothing like the book,there’s no dog shows,just a dog trying to find friends and getting bullied by a big dog (sorry if my comment was a little yappy)
11:53 LOL RACHELLE LOLOLOL
12:21 I keep coming back to watch this part over and over again.
Im somseleo
12:22 no way u made a hole (edit:nvm u didnt)
Marmaduke? Like the movie from 2010?
“Dad!! The twin towers were hit by airplanes!!” “That damn dog”
Ah yes, the shit-Zu
I'm sorry, was jk simmons the voice of zeus?
Dans 15 ans: "Ho mon dieu j'ai grandi avec ce film! Tu doit etre un nazi ou auelque chose comme ça pour en dire du mal!!!🤬"
I won’t say the same as everybody else just to fit in, I genuinely think this movie is OK it’s not horrible but it’s also not excellent or some shit it’s just OK  I have to agree the scene after he ate 35 billion tons of food was fucking disgusting but the rests fine
Pyrocynical would fucking love this film
Speedy Gonzales
The fact I like this movie😭🙏
How do we get these movies and then we get arcane
G
Wasn't Marmaduke originally a live action dog movie about a brown great Dane I think
I got a dog food ad during this
I’m going to find all the people who wanted this to happen and tell them that their a failure
6:06  this just looks like some random stock videos that someone photoshopped together without any experience
This is just fetish content. 😭
Diggity dang that dog
I have watched this movie and it was GOOD! (sorry Danny)
I swear this movie is someone’s fetish and it’s disgusting😭
worst movie of the year? nah bro you haven't seen gnomeo and Juliet
12:06 bro caused chernobyl
*U H O H famous last words*
Me too brother HOLD UP 😂😂
@Danny-Gonzalez They made a live action version of Marmaduke
How many times have you watches this video? Me: yes.
Did… did Danny actually punch a hole in the wall just to recreate marriage story
i was laughing when i thought he was dead
They laughed when the dog shit.
the parents look like sibblings
Marmaduke, Balu, Balu, Maru, and Harper to savage
how what the fuck is this movie
The only addiction I have is a Danny Gonzalez addiction.
Sir why am I under your desk
I did love this movie 😅
2:04 aint no party like a billy party
I remember watching this movie and doing my absolute best to not point out how bad the characters and the animation was
I find it funny how the trainer went from some thin British guy to a stereotypical trans dude within a month or two.
9:26
2:45 GYATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
8:05 BRO YOU CANT SAY THAT
Good live action tho
1/10, that 1 is for the best part, the ending. like literally when the movie stops.
Bro clearly hasnt watched aladin by dingo pictures
Oh god I paused this at the wrong time- at 8:14 if you pause it right before it cuts to Danny, you’ll see Marmaduke just standing on his hind legs and looking super uncanny- it is so scary and I hate it but it’s also kinda funny depending on what kind of person you are. I personally don’t like when animals are uncanny.
THERE’S A LIVE ACTION MARMADUKE ON HBO MAX ⚠️⚠️
It’s giving ai generated
11:16 i’d call it a kamikaze, cuz it bombed the whole movie
I thought he actually broke his wall. Like that was edited so well!
Average Russian cartoon
Pete Davidson's narration sounds like a **very** tired dad after a long day reading his child a bedtime story when half awake himself
3:29 HE LOOKS LIKE THE JANITOR FROM LITTLE NIGHTMARE LMAO 🤣🤣
8:58 mpreg
12:21 How did you do the effect here is it just some image  you found on google. Thank you!!!!!!!!!
✨Worldussy✨
I love Marmaduke
marmaduke is an illumination movie but worse
$2,904,945.71 is how much money they wouldve paid for Guy's training bill LMAO
MY DAD FORCED ME AND MY 2 LITTLE SISTERS TO MARMADUKE AND I REGRET NOT JUMPING OFF THE 5TH STIRY BALCONY TO ESCAPE IT IT WAS SO BAD💀💀
5:25 wow thats some nice parking
Kinda ironic because Pete Davidson is playing a cat now
My older sister loves the movie😭
Netflix greenlights everything it feels like. Thats how we get both Nimona😁 and Marmaduke🤮.
wtf is this peak cinema - there's a bad dog, he shows how bad he is, trainer time, trainer beats the shit out of him, not helping, dog miserably fails the dog competition, dog bankrupt the family, dog sad, dog no more sad, dog goes to trainer, trainer says no, dog says fuck it, dog goes around the world, dog stronk, dog to the dog competition, these dogs are stronger the guys fucked, dog preforms shit, dog looses, nvm, zeus angry, zeus get brain damage, dog fuckin dies, nvm. 10/would loose some more braincels
yes
11:31  ah yes, the rude bullies. Who are all darker skinned than the white, blond little main character girl. Wait-  Not to pull the racism card but I noticed it and couldn’t stop thinking about it lol
i rly thought the dad said “diggidy dac dac doc” at 4:18 😭
15:25 what this dog does is just phisically imposible
Is there other way to behave dog?
They played this shit at my school💀💀💀
What is J.K. Simmons doing here?! Wtf kind of blackmail did they have on him to get him in this movie? (He voices Zeus.)
To be honest Ferdinand was better than this atleast it had actual action and incredible storyline than marmaduke
October2024
Did he say h HELLO greg???
Just seeing mom and dad next to each other on the couch... Get yourself a girl who will snap your bones like dry kindling when she sits on your lap
Marmaduke? Don’t they already have the live action from years ago
Tbh you should see the other marmaduke movie, the one that came out before this one, it was better
Been months since ive watched dis shi
0:10 voice crack ahh “oWn”
the plot of the story : stick figures and dogs with a wonky ass narratator
"Father, when can I leave to be in my ownnnn." - Said Mr.Oh-so-relatable to every teenager.....NOT! 😂
People are confused about Pete Davidson in this movie, I'm more confused about how they got JK Simmons in it... how the fuck did they get him?
20:02 Dad: gets all his data sold to some company "That damn DOG"
12:21 Did bro really just punch a hole in his wall for a video on a crappy movie💀
Old lady Danny fan here.  My son was born in 2005 and I feel he got to watch the tail end of the best animated shows…SpongeBob, Adventure Time, Regular Show…animated shows/ movies now are just plain ugly and the writers don’t even try to entertain the parents like they used to
The live action death note movie SUCKED and it was from netflix
lol i just remembered how my school camp went to watch this, same critiques tbh. the most memorable moment was how the whole hall (except for me and my friend) was laughing uncontrolably at the big fart part like what
I watched the movie… I wasn’t the same anymore…
18:10 you can see how they just move the model of the the body rigidly and just let the hair physics fling around
A
i dont know how but my little brother loved the movie and i got forced too watch it even if i didnt want too watch...
My favorite Netflix movie is ultra man I really recommend it. :)
This movie made me sad, I watched the live action one (don’t remember when it came out) and like… why. The live action one was amazing, well executed, this one was so painfully bad. I agree, no one would make somethin like this on purpose and go “MY LIFES WWOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRKK!!”
Which is worse? Megamind 2 or Marmaduke
UHH he simmer like gold I'm mean who says that
Actually the most impressive feat out of the entire dog show is by whoever installed the tiny little handle that the whole convention center was lifted by. Forget the dog that did the lifting - that worker deserves a Nobel Prize in physics.
12:19 "MARMADUKE IS A GREAT DANE."
I shouldn’t have made food when I started watching this video….
For the thing about is the dog speaking English or the trainer guy speaking dog I think the dog understands English and the trainer understand dog so basically they are talking in their own language it’s just they understand each other ig
This movie is hilariously dog shit
Marmaduke is based on a book of the same name
The writers barely disguised fetish
That dog trainer started on JoJo's Bizare Adventure
Marmaduke was from 2010, the internet wont gaslight me into thinking this cartoon is something new !!
8:58  oh no he went on deviant art!!
13:54 Unfortunately, i watched this as a kid in school where the library teacher put this movie. Thank god it didn't finish.
as someone born in 400 BC on uranus, i can say it doesn’t matter where or when you were born if the movie is as ass as marmaduke.
Maybe I'm getting old or something, but characters like Marmaduke just piss me the hell off so much lol. I'm glad the trainer beat his ass
Knowing that the va for ford pines plays the fancy dog in this movie,,🙏😭
I had to watch this in school 1 year and I remember talking to my friends the whole time and not paying attention bc it was so boring and cringey
Who’s gonna tell him that there was a 2010 original Marmaduke movie ?
The food at the dog show scene is giving vore fetishes
That trainer looks like a spider. Its very unsettling.
0:00 You look very hot and handsome so smooth😍😜
Where is I'm Zombies 3 ?
I am Titan Trahan and my last name may sound familler, " Ryan Trahan ". I know that you are famous so I came to you, Can you plzzz make a Video saying that Ryan Trahan is not my dad because at school people say that he is my dad. thx,
10:27 the nuclear dog
me too I seen tadc on Netflix now
Your face looks ai generated.
worst part is that there's a different Marmaduke movie made in 2010 that's actually... good. they did my man DIRTY
i am a children and i saw this movie
i used to like marmaduke but now i dont
trying so hard not to laugh at midnight
Nah the shark was the hero in the movie he tried to eat marmaduke so the movie would end faster  Edit: if wanna know where the shark is it’s here 14:29  Edit the second: oh yeah and here 7:22
8:25 zoophiles be like
I am 100% confident Netflix is not capable of making a good movie. No, they dont have some underlying scheme, they also do not KNOW the movies are bad. They just take the approach that if you make a trillion movies, not ALLLLL can be bad right?
Sees an atomic bomb explode:  Marmaduke!
"beat the shit out of your dog" the way he said it is so god damn funny
The voice acting makes me like upset
Dude this might be the absolute worst character design I’ve ever seen in my life.
3:18 IT GOT JIGGLE PHYSICSSS NO WAY
The fact that Pete Davidson put more effort into his performance for the Dog Man Movie then this is crazy
2:39 How every South Park character walks
19:16 are u glorifying death over life
18:40
4:12
GYATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
11:13 Think about it… imagine being the ONLY dog to even be considered a ‘not-so-great Dane’. You’re not great. At worst, OK. No one wants to be called an ok Dane.
15:16 I think the only thing I’m more impressed with than the bull dog is the material the handle and screws are made of and just how good those screws are
nahhh why is the mom built like that😭
Found out that the director of this movie also made Pixel Perfect, Halloweentown High, and did VFX on Jurassic Park! wtf happened
at 11:07 Guy looks like he's losing his goddamn mind like Marmaduke has permanently traumatized him from ever training a dog again
0:10 “father when can I leave to be on my aowhhnnnnna
New Pinocchio is so zesty
hypnosis exists in real life, but that’s nowhere near how it actually works
There's no way youtube didn't read my mind. I was legit just thinking of watching this.
I hated marmaduke
The dog may be a "not-so-great Dane," but you are a great Danny.
4:24 gd reference??
"looks like you didnt get it today we will try again tomorrow." that part KILLS me everytime lmao
why wasd this sagested to me 2 years later
I remember my teacher torturing my class by saying the one painful sentence "Let's watch Marmaduke" Dude my class literally makes the time to sleep during the movie 😭💀
im greg
Love how Pete Davidson just goes from not even interested to voice the dog, to literally a year later giving so many emotions to voicing a Rebellious Big Gay Robot  What is Pete on bro
Went to go see this with my husband and his 5 yo brother, had to leave after 5 minutes cause his brother got scared of the fart noises
I swear marnaduke or whatever its name is, was a real life movie first? like with real actors and a real dog. I remember the poster was a tan Great Dane with sunglasses on and the movie title was in red
ive watched you for years im 100% sober and this is probably the funniest video ive seen you post thank you
The fact that Netflix is failing gives me hope that blockbuster will go back into business someday but having a digital renting option
Help why is Pinnochio sound so zesty like me
why they shoes built like they can get the chicken meat out of my front teeth
I’m convinced that Pete Davidson makes bets with his friends, and he just always loses 😂😂
They have besmirched the Marmaduke name. The original 2010, live action is a cinema masterpiece, shame, shame on them. For shame.
Why does your thumbnail look like your doing an apology video
bro the animation is insane
The marmaduke movie is legit *scarier* than *horror movies*
i watched marmaduke and liked it
It’s not bad (try to change my mind)
Marmaduke isn’t bad. It was one of my favorite movies on Netflix.😢😢😢
I literally hate comedy shows so fucking much because they are so fucking stupid and dumb and boring
I was really hoping this video would be about why Netflix or any studio would make bad movies on purpose. Tax write off? Wtf
A lot of the banquet food has dairy, and dogs are lactose intolerant, maybe that explains the farting and shitting and diarrheaing
im pretty sure its based of a book
I think guy is talking english, but can understand Marmaduke, and Marmaduke fully understands English, it's just that when he talks all humans hear is barking.
you look so much like joey milis its making me unconfortable
This is the type of movie that one younger cousin watches
6:52 Piccolo training Gohan
How the hell did they get JK Simmons to play the shiny dog?
Why do you think he's evil, cus he's British Yes
The credits was better quality than the whole movie😭
Sadly I've seen this 😂
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY BOY MARMADUKE???????? please review the original it came out in like the 2000s i think
My teacher forced my class to watch this movie it sucks
The thing that baffles me the most is how weirdly huge Zeus is for an Afghan Hound.
i watched this and im a child🙃
When i was a kid there was a live action movie with Marmaduke and it was about dog surfing. Good time
This look so s### that the bad movie of 2023
I watched it but only for school because they probably thought oh this looks like a good movie for my class and then did not read the reviews
If they animate characters to look slender or a ball then you know it’s bad
Wait you've gotta be kidding me, this movie wasn't just a fucked up fever induced hallucination of mine?
Bro did sum Kung fu ahh shi
i watched it b4 with my cousin, i fucking hated it
The timing on the thunder and lightning line bothers me so much. It's so stiff and slow
You look like the red head kid from spies in disguise
If someone told me, that the writers asked DeviantArt community for ideas as to how the competition is supposed to go, I wouldn’t be surprised
I would rather be watching Megamind versus the doom syndicate not that I would actually would butterfly word hi
Bouncing egg😂😂😂😂
im not american
4:18 DIGGIDY DANG THAT DOG!1!1!,1
Bro saying that he's not the bad guy and than the dude starts beating the shit out of an animal someone that is not him owns
15:33 the dog got domain expansion
This movie was bad😂
NO MARMADUKE IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER, I may want death on you, idk yet thi
Megamind 2 and our drawings got some competition here
At least sea beast is good
But still, this is somehow better than Megamind 2
17:45 What is that characters existence
Theyre so silly who can even watch these movies when were all too busy watching Red Notice
I dont understand the hate comments this is movie of the year fr
At the time stamp 14:02 when he said “I don’t think any kid has ever watched this” my 8 year old brother just quietly said “I watched it”
furry inflation/weight gain and fart fetishes!! You know! For kids!
I doubt any of this was made by human beings tbh
This video made me laugh so hard, harder than I ever have in the past few months. You’ve just earned 10 subs. Thank you for this.
Imagine actually naming your dog "Marmaduke"
Have you seen the real marmaduke
Bro I like this movie (I think I'm going insane and that's why I like it)
My name is not greg
I was forced to watch it in the middle of school with teachers in the room and I was so embarrassed about the dog shitting I started tearing up 💔
.
Lol why does he keep calling me Greg..?
You cant tell me Netflix didnt commit tax write-off while keep pumping content with trash while cancelling good one
The weapon of mass destruction dame 11:19
I only accept the first marmaduke
6:29 I knew what you were going to say and said it at the same time I’m so proud of myself
This movie just looks AWFUL
Fr fr 6:50
6:31
that animation style reminds me of arpo the robot. Even that show is better than this movie.
Bro just copying other ytbers
4:34 >>TIDAL WAVE<<
I’m having a very bad headache and this cursed movie just made it worse,  no joking. The art style looks like that Addams family animated movie but worse and with a lot of fetishes over there…  Opinion: very gross and disturbing movie, specially in the parts on the dog shitting. It gave me strong Fanboy & Chum Chum vibes (yep, that horrible Nickelodeon show), I think it could be like that movies that are on sale at Walmart or target
To think they used the copyright of a classic newpaper comic is saddening
Is that a Lada 2103  5:27
All I’m gonna say is that the animation is more awful than Garfield Gets Real, and I hate Garfield Gets Real. This animation is so horrendous it circles back into uncanny valley and awakes some kind of ancient, genuine fear inside of me. I’m not joking. Some part of my psyche is recoiling in the idea that something is WRONG with how these characters look.
Marmaduke actually has bowel cancer or some Sh!t
I have this specific sensitivity to 3D animation in the uncanny valley,, I get like vaguely nauseous it’s like body horror to me so this film is literally my worst nightmare
You look AI generated I’m ngl
" dad theres a nuke coming to our house "   "DIGGITY DANG THAT DOHG"
I’m not gonna lie to you, but this movie was really weird and the characters look like if they were created by illumination I’m not gonna lie to you, but I’m giving this a one star 💀
tthis suksis
Marrmiduke actually is a live film and its really good..what ever netfix did is horrible
I remember watching this movie with my friend and her siblings about a year or two ago
My summer school made me watch this and the entire time I was dying inside
Bros yapping about the dads nose LOOK AT YOUR OWN
Garbage movie that openly displays how disgusting dog owners are, a bunch of zoophiles that think fart jokes are funny
I actually enjoyed Marmaduke nd the emoji movie 😭
It's like the art style of Illumination but even worse...
11:23 what really happened in Hiroshima
3:30 Fun Fact: Nose Size supposedly has a Positive Correlation to Penis Size  make of that what you will
bouncing egg
Marmaduke played a minor role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre..
even the EMOJI MOVIE was more enjoyable than this.
10:36 Because it's pretty clear that they hid their fetish in these scenes, under disguise of "funny" joke
2:04 that definitely does not look like a really bad version of Scooby-Doo
I watched this movie when I was a kid because the original live action movie movie is great and I wasn't expecting the animated knock off of the movie will be so horrible
This was based off the live action marmaduke that is not as bad as
Dude I just watched this movie with my little cousin and for some reason he loves it. I think he needs help
dude bad movies are the best  edit: how tf am i not subscribed, there subscribed and all notis, am i greg now?
“did they give pete davidson 40 seconds to write this song?” did pete davidson even write the song? 😂😂
I love Marmaduke 😢
watched this movie on my bday      I hated it
Marmaduke in a nutshell:  Unhealthily skinny people  *E G G* that hops Pixar moms at home Scooby doo ripoff Bad hip hop song for the credits
Danny got 6.66M subs...
9:59 AGAIN?????
im sorry but the dog show was fucking hilarious
Ngl don’t hate me, but I kind of like it👍
Did you expect them to make good movies when they allow a pedophilic show on their app?
One of my friends thought this movie was peak💀 he's 12
Bro has 6.66m subscribers.
Did u know : Dolphins Play with Puffer fish to get drunk and hurt sharks for no reason they’re actually more dangerous the sharks because sharks only bite people to see if they’re food because they can’t see well if a dolphin attacks u it’s Just Doing that for the Shits a giggles
Marmaduke trash but the new ultra man is FIRE OH MY GOD
happy 6.66M subs
That deadpanned “hit it” at the end was fucking hilarious😂
Gonna leave this here: 19:24
10:14 i laugh at this for the rest of the video
apparently, marmaduke is actually a live action movie. i guess theres an animated one
The realistic marmaduke movie is way better
18:06 IS THAT F**KING OMNI-MAN???
You said the rich British guy isn't the bad guy, but then literally everything he does is insanely evil😂
Marmaduke really caused the next Chernobyl at the dog show!
8:05  the bark was actually impressive lol
this movie is so awful it makes me laugh
I like how theres somone named greg who watches you and is like "wow im so important"
12:20 legend says that one can see the crack on the wall even today, if they look close enough…
My grandfather had the marmaduke comics, they’re just these cute little things of a dog being an absolute SHIT STAIN. so this movie is…puzzling.
I have become a member of Greg
She so thick, her back curves 💀
I paused on 3:24 he is pretending to be japan
0:11 “FaHThEHR WEhn CaHn I LeAve TWo Beh Ohn MAh OWnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn 💀💀😫💅💅💅💅
Apparently the queen of England is pure evil
This movie is a case study in the "barely disguised fetish of the animator"
Watch nimoana
Hello Danny future Greg here it only gets worse
This film genuinely left a bad taste in my mouth...
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87'?!?!?!?! 7:37
*marmaduke freaking dies* "WE ARE FAMILY-"
How does bro. Keep composed
That's not mini 4:02
-hello-
lol
4:13 Jesus is this dog like caseoh or something?
i watched this movie before and i had a mental breakdown of cringe watching bro create a tactical nuke of shit
The new movie tarot just released into Netflix, now this was very weird because tarot literally just came out. I searched up reviews about the movie and it did absolutely horrible, the audience score wasn’t bad but the critic score was 18% on rotten tomatoes. Netflix does this a lot with new movies that just came out, I’m not saying all the movies are bad, I’m just saying Netflix needs to change.
Guy’s legs are thinner than my phone’s charger 💀
0:09
The live action is way better
4:14 that moan 💀
I was confused for a hot second bc this was not the marmaduke i remember lmao
10:10 10:15 This might be what you’re looking for 😂
atleast its better than wish💀
My little brothers are actually obsessed with this movie. I can't think of why.
Actually I’m a kid and I watched it your calculations are wrong😂
0:09 pinocchio should not have sounded that zesty😭
This is movie is incredible, what you mean
I was bored and it was before Danny made this video so I was gonna watch this, I couldn’t even get 1 minute in without wanting to rip out my eyes. I have no idea how Danny does it.
i remember watching this in school and i was so confused.  it’s the most unhinged movie ever 😭
Bro I use to like Maramduke when I was a younger and as I look back on it it sucks
Help i remember watching this in my gym class whe i was 9...in my old school 😨😨😨💀
15:35 bro did a domain expansion
My brother forced me to watch this with him the description alone was brought to turn me away but my mom said to watch it I saw the animation and left without hesitation
5:25 The bad guy must be rich and British   The goeata family in helluva.
Cmon we all know who should have played the dog: Blake Roman. Then that disappointed/annoyed moan at the beginning of the movie ie the line: “you can’t ban me from Billy’s party eughhhh” would have been more like: “oh daddy you can’t ban me from Billy’s party, yk I bring the party 😏. 😩😫😩😫😩😫😩😫.” (Edit I was super sick and high while writing this, but my view still stands.)
this movie also has nothing to do with the marmaduke that its based on?? marmaduke is just a dog who farts
I don’t know what your talking about marmaduke is amazing Said no one
0:52 It’s okay but now that you say that… 13:58 Well what counts as a child? I was 10 when I watched this
My younger brother watched this movie and said he liked it so I disowned him
As a shih tzu owner, I can confirm they are very shitty.
for your question of if kids watch this movie- yes, they do. my sister loved this movie when she was 10. XD
my honest reaction to seeing the mom: GYATTTTTTTT
I remember watching this as a kid and thinking it was weird but not terrible but looking back this movie is so ugly and the plot is so weird and I hate it
Idk I’m somewhere in between loll cuz I’ve got like 20 pars of shoes and 5 different glasses pairs but I also don’t like buying more things, I just don’t get rid of shit.
*trump gets shot*  The Dad: Diggity dang that dog!
my parents made me watch this when it came out
18:45 so uhh…ya’ll don’t see the lady in purple? 😨
This movie is when netfilx had 20 bucks in there back pocket, shoved it in a writer’s face and said make a movie with this much money and see how crappy you can make it.
10:28 domain expansion. Poo raid
Im 13 if that counts as a child, and i watch this movie just to trash on it
But I watched this and liked it when I was 5 :(
Rewatching this video for the 298th time.
Marmaduke was some..fuckin.. dog dude i dont care
i thought it was bad
Actually, if a AI was fed a bunch of bad movies, it would make something so, so much better than whatever this was
I can’t believe this video come on two years ago, I remember when this video come out 😢
This vid is 2 years old today
Thank God, they deleted those movies
it’s so funny to think of Pete watching this
13:20
I still can't get over the character design of the mom in this movie. Like... what is happening there? How did that make it to the final cut? I'm so confused.
Negative reviews reminds me of a movie review series I used to watch a few years ago. He would give a bad movie a negative score if he thought it fell in the "so bad it's kind of fun to watch" category. Sort of how he put it: "A 10/10 is a great movie and a fun time to watch. A -10/10 movie is a bad movie but still a fun time to watch. A 0/10 movie is just bad."
Hey, Pete made it big with SNL and transformers, so hey, he bounced back!
11:33 ahahahao hehehahuhahuooooooooo why do they look like 38 year olds stuck in the bodies of random middle scholars? And why does marmadoo look like a sims 4 dog with the sliders mod? Now that i think about it, everyone here looks like they're playing with sliders
farting!
You should watch the original movie of maraduke please see that on I think its better than the cartoon
0:11 father when can I leave to be on my ownnn😫😫😫
That Pete Davidson "song" is particularly egregious.
You know, for a dog that likes to eat a lot, Marmaduke is surprisingly very slim.  Either the animators didn’t know how to draw fat dogs or they just saved it for the disgusting fart scene.
10:36 oh it's obvious that you don't know children and you haven't had much contact with them xd 13:54 yep You dont know children
let me get this straight his name is guy, he has a purple suit and is british?  ... huh...
That marmaduke dog is so cute… kinda makes me want to watch it
i mean    its better than the taylor swift movie
i dont know why but you make me laugh so much everytime I watch your videos
19:32 Wait, Co-Directed by Phil Nibbelink? As in Puss in Boots Phil Nibbelink?
I fond a movie made by wownow and its calld pets 2 and idk
I've seen a movie way worse than that it's called henchmen
I always tried to ride my dog Oy as a child. (It didn’t work, also, Oy is dead)
19:51 i want to say something innapropiate
well, i watched the garfield movie not too long ago, and it was pretty much the same damn movie: -based off of a beloved comic strip -ugly artstyle, mainly the humans -main character is a talking pet who terrorizes his owner(s) and won't stop eating -unclear whether humans can understand the animals -"training sequence" with a mentor who serves almost no relevance to the rest of the movie, where the mc does horribly but still "passes" -multiple villains who are nowhere near fully developed as characters  -near the end, the mc suddenly gains incredible skill that allows them to beat the villain  -fakeout death (this is practically every kids movie now though) -shoddy ending that leaves one feeling dumber than when the movie started.  anything i missed?
I watched it and liked it
U look ai
Is Danny Gonzalez a rich little boy who lives in his parents basement?  Travels around the country. No visible means of support outside of this stupid ass YouTube stuff. Good luck Danny in the future making a career out of this ephemeral crap
I swear Pete Davidson shows up only in moments you never expect him to
To make a movie villain British and rich great job you made a villain😂😂😂lol
There is a live action marmaduke movie
ey- I watched this movie like one year ago and I didn't really have a brain so liked it. I didn't see anything wrong with it then and it was in a other language but now that I look at it I see how it actually is... yea-
I feel like Netflix saw The Producers and took away entirely the wrong lesson.
Did you know that there is a live action film.
that rich british guy lowkey looks like the oncealer from the lorax 💀
I watched this movie as a kid
Rich people: evil. British: VEEEEEEEERY EEEEEVILLLLLL
The original marmaduke is the best but this… this is shit…
i got multiple febreeze and perfume ads on this video. what the hell marmaduke
“Maybe we need to enroll Marmaduke in obedience school” *fucking dies*
I actually loved this movie i dont really know why maybe because I'm under thirteen °-°
There has gotta be a reason for these awful movies. I’m guessing money laundering or tax reasons but idk I don’t make movies.
This video is my guilty pleasure I always rewatch it every 4 months and it never fails to make me laugh
The old Marmaduke movie (live action) was good. At least, my nostalgia remembers it being good. This is just... this isnt even... this is not it.
so maramduke is lightning mcqueen a snarky unlikeable jerkoff got it x3  i love your humor too have a sub
I watched this movie at SCHOOL  when I was younger
I hate to say it, but my sister absolutely loves this movie.
I can’t believe that removed the little prince movie for this 😶
You know Danny is funny when my boyfriend is saying I laugh to much at the jokes
The animation looks so bad, that even the original Snow White movie from the 30's is far better
Bro, I remember when I was in P.E we watched this movie.
G   R    E           G
The live action movie from 2010 was pretty good, this one sucks ass
3:50 you managed to sound a bit like ray william Johnson lol
12:09 is more intense and a better scene than the dinner argument scene in hereditary
8:55 ok, who wanted to put their weird fetish in the movie
Hey this is the first ever one of your videos I’ve ever seen Danny so I just re-watching a bunch because I like it yeah this video was the entire reason I found you drew and Curtis
They were like "it's so bad it's good"
At first, i didnt know what the animation looked like. It looks horrible, i can see they just put a model and hire a person who doesnt know how to animate.
That dog park became a superfund site.
Netflixed replaced pacific rim..a legendary movie… *WITH THIS DOG SH-*
I wouldn't be surprised if the director was a writer for a drama series
4:23 🌊🌊🌊 GEOMETRY DASH REFRENCE 🌊🌊🌊 TIDAL WAVE 🌊🌊🌊 NO WAY 🌊🌊🌊
1995 : i love Toy story so much i can't wait to more 3D animated films later in the future   2022 : what i have just seen I wish this doesn't exist
that one dog said: “domain expansion”
What the hell is a marmaduke
you could have started by saying « hi greg I hope you’re having a great dane » DAMN IT
21:30 XD
i watched this w my mom and my dad was in the kitchen... BRO MY DAD WAS SO UPSET W THE CUSSING N MY MOM WAS CONCERNED
i remember the old marmaduke  the non animated one that was good (i think)
Also character are either fat or skinny. The day kids are show fat they just hop all the time….  That just lazy.
10:16 the way he describes this scene is HILARIOUS!
This movie is fire idk what ur talking abt
Did u know there’s a live action marmaduke from 2010
8:56 pyrocynical
8:57 caseoh
nah the fart that kills the bird is like XD how toxic is that dog
I  liked marmaduke
I just want people to know that this is not what the marmaduke comic strip was like or about at all
Id had my birthday at a cinema as a kid once and saw thr real live take on marmaduke and was actually a pretty good film but now its just weird in this version
Why does this movie sound so familiar to me?
the art style and animation during the ending song is legitimately better than the entire movie which might be the funniest part
The original marmaduke was fire though
4:23 TITAL WAVE GEOMETRY DASH REFERENCEEEEEE
Marma Duke was a good comic strip not a good movie they absolutely massacred my boy
Im far more interested that David Koechner was in this than Pete Davidson. Makes me feel very old at 28.. But I'll watch just about anything David does, and it's exposed me to some insane/fantastic content over the years.
Watch kung food
That mom doesn’t have Pixar hips—she has freakin’ elephantiasis.
14:10 Marmaduke clips into the cat's tail. Was this movie animated in a week?
In the Movie your are fat or skinny
Bro, he could've used his killing fart.
20:31 is ridiculous
Prob was made by an ai. Sadly
This movie makes the 2010 live action look like a cinematic masterpiece
Pyrocinical moment 8:57
I someone else here in this video in 2025
10:00
ngl tho the movie is kinda underrated
Why was was he so monotone 😂
I will never understand why scriptwriters think relying on gross out humour is gonna make people laugh. I avoid stuff like this like the plague. This isn't funny, it just makes me want to bleach myself inside and out so I don't have it stuck in my head. It's straight up embarrassing.
hey check out the new 'woody woodpecker goes to camp' the first movie was good but this one they didnt even try. the animations were bad and it looked fake easily just by looking at it. please watch this and show us your reaction
6:29 Cesar Millan in a nutshell
The fart is actually mustard gas the dog just a world war 1 artillery shell in the form of a dog
8:03 my theory is that Guy understands dogs and Marmaduke understands English.
I love that they are paying 1.4 MILLION for 'dog food' and then another 50k for 'food'
I don’t know to you but I didn’t want to watch marmaduke either but mom told me it was the only good kid movie and I liked it I don’t know why
13:01 Seems like he at least billed for the daughters therapy though! 🤠
Maybe that cartoon wouldn't have been so bad if they'd hired the 2D animator that did the outro to do the entire movie. Seemed like someone had some talent. Shoulda used it.
3:50 then paused
Help this movie is co-directed by Phil nibbelink aka the guy who created Romeo and Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss which is basically Romeo and Juliet with seals😭the whole movie’s on YouTube in case you ever wanna do a commentary on it (please do)
Honestly, just like how some billionaires skip out of taxes with paintings, it might be the same with movies because its still art by technicality.
Better Than The New Megamind Movie
Rich and British? *Must have evil!*
I was born on Phobos in the year
“THEY HIT THE SECOND TOWER!” “Diggity dang that dog!”
I’ve refused to watch this movie since it came out (a year ago wow), and I’m glad I did. Marmaduke was a really good comic, but this kinda ruined it.
You know a movie is terrible when they manage to make you sad because the dog did NOT die at the end
i love marmaduke
I remember my brother watching this movie a few years ago, and he actually liked it quite a lot💀
i have brain rot now ( ^u^)b
God bless Danny for always putting the sponsor at the end
OMG WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT MARMADUKE I THOUGHT IT WAS FROM THE 2000’S PLZ TELL ME IM NOT ALONE
20:06 😂
It makes it so much worse seeing companies churn out slop like this, and shelf projects people were ACTUALLY excited for as tax write offs
when do you review a good movie
i’ve never fucking laughed as hard as i did watching this video😭
U SKIPPED THE PART WHERE THEY SHAKE ASS
I really don't like the artstyle in this movie, they all look like Jack Skellington with none of the charm.
bacon bacon bacon
13:45 what do you mean innocent 😭
I wish I could fart food
Back when I had regularly scheduled movie nights with my friends, we’d put this on whenever we didn’t decide what to watch ahead of time, as punishment.  I might be the person who’s seen this movie the most times.
Hypnotism is very much a real thing in this world and not an element of magic.
Something that I just learned about this movie is that Zeus is voiced by J. K. Simmons aka the person who voices omni man which I think is pretty funny
your video is 100 times than anything on netflix
IM 5
6:21 Joshdubs song called   IM KICKING THAT DOG,IM KICKING THAT DOG, I'M KICKING THAT DOG I'm the ruler I'm the king so I give it a little slap
I've been laughing way too hard over 'bouncing egg'
Its really cool his desktop wallpaper ais the pillars of creation nebula
"Loves to eat and suffer's for it" story of my life.
Short answer: yes.
how do I obtain marmaduke’s build
I thought the thunder and lightning part was edited but no it’s actually in the movie lol
0:49 I think the only thing good about it is Pete (I personally love Pete)
18:08 The dog's movements here make me so uncomfortable. Like, are they okay? Are they about to bluescreen?
They even got jk simons aka j jona jameson and omni man and this movie still failed spectacularly
The original 2010 live action Marmaduke that i grew up with is so much better😭 When i saw the netflix adaption had come out i havent even watched it because i knew that it would just be ruined :,)  I highly recommend the original Marmaduke (released 2010)
I feel mortified for noticing this, but one of the cheerleaders is in the crowd at 10:30 at the dog show. So… there is actually an explanation for the cheerleaders knowing about it. I can’t believe *that’s* what the creators put thought into.
Calling the wave that was made by Marmaduke falling into a pool a "mini tsunami" is a massive understatement.
There's actually a Marmaduke film from years ago that's a real life movies , it's an amazing movie , sad to see they made a horrible animated mess of the movies
All this wailing about a guy beating up a dog, when it's a dog that was attacking him anyway and showed no sign of fear or sorrow at Guy fighting back.
bouncing egg goes hard
I still hate this fucking movie
if your not gregged up then go ahead and smash that greg button
6:06 bro looks like Roblox stickbug
they played it in my middle school inside recess😭😭😭
Get bent! You are so out of touch with the current financial climate.   Unsubscribed!
Ive actually seen the original 2010 Marmaduke which is good
danny glossed over the fact Zeus is is jk simmons
I really like this movie but ok
What kind of coco melon is this
Just realized this is the animated parody of marmaduke the real Marmaduke movie was made 8 years ago. Now this is the animated version which has no similar things. The live action made 8 years ago
😭them legs look like mosquitoe legs
bro they put this in my local cinema and my little sister wanted to see it on big screen....(after that i stoped taking her to cinema)
SIR 19:51 why did you do this shot??😂
This was playing without audio in the dentist and it started at the poop scene to the bill part and now it makes MUCH more sense lol!
How do you get J.K. Simmons to act THAT badly?!
The redeeming quality of the Marmaduke movie is it reminded me of the old Marmaduke comic strips so I went and read those instead.
I read your shirt as shart
I think the craziest thing about this is that Zeus is played by JK Simmons. What the fuck
Tidle wave: you summoned a geometry Dash player
That dog trainer absolutely is evil, he charged the family thousands of dollars to groom a great dane and almost half a million dollar "service fee"
As a British person, I can confirm that all rich and British people are villains.
One time in my class we were allowed to watch a movie while playing games, and my friend got chosen. We had 2 options, and being the TROLL THAT HE IS he chose marmaduke. Bruhhh xd
Apparently this movie is based off a newspaper comic by the same name, there’s also a live action movie based off it, neither of them seemed to nail the vibes of the comic strips from what I can tell  Edit: I also just found out that Zeus is voiced by J.K Simmons?? Like, the same guy who voiced Jonah Jameson, Cave Johnson and Ford pines
the original live action marmaduke was so much better its sad theyve taken it off of netflix
11:54 can we talk about how amazing the lip sync is? I’ve never seen anything better.
This video made me giggle a few times lol Edit: okay more than a few times
Every time I begin to question my artist abilities, I'll watch this video, and know I'm better than this
I'm 100% sure this "movie" was made by someone with a fart fetish lol 😂
“ AW *_FUCK_* HE’S ALIVE 🤡✌️” Help I’m dying 😭💅
Danny’s a furry confirmed
4:27 GEOMETRY DASH REFERENCE?
Some kid at school asked me “have you heard of marmaduke?” And we straight up had an entire conversation in tech class about how awful marmaduke was 😭
Always interesting to see movies with such grotesque character designs have such beautiful backgrounds. The trees in the park and the exterior shots of the family home are particularly nice.
My teacher put this on for movie day😢
Og live action marmaduke:good movie Animated remake:look how they massacred my boy
3:18 in this scene you can see marmaduke clip through the wall 😭😭
Help why does “guy” look like the onceler and William Afton had a child 😭😭😭
Hi
11:30 not be accusatory or anything, but why are the bullied POC while the victim is the only white girl…I’m probably just being picky, but still…
4:04 and they had the audacity to make a clint eastwood look alike in the poster in the background
why did he have to emphasise the fact that guy is Dann- i mean drew goodens biggest fan
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that this movie was animated like it was an Open Season movie?
You not-so-great-dan…
live action marmaduke is better guys
10:10 it looks like Marmaduke cast the spell Cloudkill at 9th level. I think at this point the scp foundation might want to contain him because he obviously represents a risk to the safety of the planet.
i'd rather pass kidney stones than watch this five times
What are you talking about this movie is a fucking masterpiece
The fact this film was shown in some movie theaters is terrifying.
4:24 All my Geometry Dashers
It used to be a good movie when the original wit Owen Wilson was out
Its so annoying seeing Netflix make bad movies because they HAVE made good products before like nimona and shera
yes im a year late. But ive seen a live action marmaduke. what happened to my childhood movie
Dam that mum
Bro if the dog is secretly a kangaroo then I guess that’s another reason why I shouldn’t go to Australia (I’m scared to face both the dogs and kangaroos there) 😂💀
I’ve seen this movie about 4 times now. This movie is terrible ⟟ thought I’d never see it again but here ⟟ am
acterly now i dont
its funny
marmadoke is amazing!?!?!?
The 30 second ad I watched is better then this movie.
This movie is worse than cancer
I could not stop laughing
Yes. The need/want attention and they don't care what it's from, whether it's something good or bad they know people are still going to watch it. The dumpster fire (velma show) did the same thing.
I've rewatched this video so many times because i find it so funny, and now i always dodge the punch on the "how to dodge a punch segment" xD
OH NO! konsome panchi dog vs scooby doo on funny sugar and muai thai shaggy!!!: the movie
10:15 IS HE SMILING- **i wanted to put an emoji here to represent the disgust i feel, but none of them can even compare**
4:21 geomerty dash
9:46 - 9:52 This is what Wario is going to do at the Max and Ruby scary guy
My PE teacher made the class watch this movie
14:26: they forgot the border between North and South Korea, Mongolia doesn’t exist, and most other west Asian countries. Not only is marmaduke stupid, but also inaccurate.
Bruh
I thought that rich dude was Asian
ijk i call the slurpaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I've watched it,it was a not so great  movie
that dog became shernobyl
19:48 POV: secret head
Please watch Bible Town
I watched the whole thing of marmaduke, I regretted it so bad. It's so disgusting and weird 😭
the 3 characters designs of marmaduke:  eerily slender bouncing kinder egg pixar mom
17:20 had me dying on the floor for a good 2 minutes
Almost 10 mil 🥳🥳
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pretty sure “Not So Great Dane” is what everyone calls Dane Cook
i love how not only does danny's bark sound really accurate but he also loses all sense of emotion when he does it 8:05
14:20
Am i the only one who lovea this movie 💀
Ok but this movie has gay rep? 11:10
The fact I liked  it 💀
They nailed that pinnochio video game tho Godamn
tbh I fucking hate this movie purely because it's shiting on the good name of Marmaduke(a genuinely good movie you should go watch that movie instead)
4:24 GD REFERENCE!!! finally it's rated.
the og marmaduke, which is live action and has owen wilson, is good. this qualifies as a crime.
I feel like when you walk into this room you unironically laugh at that photo of you with the inhaler.
There is an older live action version of this movie that is actually a pretty good movie
Im willing to bet 9/10ths of the budget went to pete lmao
Why does the audio in this movie suck EXCEPT the disgusting sounds?
The live action movie was way better
7:55 I really like the way you worded that lol
I was traumatized after watching this movie
I was traumatized after watching this movie
I'm now greg!
Pete Davidson is only in the best Thing's. Marmaduke  Good Mourning  Good Burger 2 and the SNL episod with Elon Musk.
once i watched this movie on a sick day cause i was bored        ...            i also think i blanked out the whole time
6:07 the fuck is this? Mortal Kombat X?
6:51 invincible
Marmaduke turned that first dog competition into cherynoble
Oof this movie is terrible, I'm just going to pretend that the 2010 live-action Marmaduke movie is the only one that exists.
Why is pete Davidson the go to for the famous person with terrible acting even narration
10:11 Why does it look like a rocket taking off
clearly one of the writers have a fart fetish
This movie is the same name as marmaduke which is not animated n is actually a cute kids film i think they tried basing it from that
Woah the under the desk angle is 😍😍
6:53 DANNY MY HEADPHONES💔💔
Dude punched a hole in his wall for a joke on his YouTube video. That caught me so off guard. It's hilarious and I feel like I should be laughing my ass off. But it's so jarring that I'm just sitting here silently respecting it. Just gets up out of nowhere and vandalizes his house for the lulz. Okay I'm laughing now.
Put up their deuces? You mean, put up their “Dukes?”  Wasted opportunity! 🧐
My mum put a cringe ass dog movie and like half the movie is grunts
obey zues
The 3 body types in the movie:   Erily slender: 🫤  Bouncing egg: 😐🤮😐 Mom: 🤨📸 “”pixar mom””
To be fair, Netflix does make a solid amount of good movies. This is definitely not one of them.
when i went out of full screen during the fart scene the area around the screen was green
2:39 Bouncing Egg 💀💀💀
Is Zeus a Borzoi? If so, did they do the obligatory "didn't I do it for you" meme? Or is that meme considered too old? Bring back memes from 15 years ago! They had more panache!  4:54 Is that shirt an homage to Undertale?
There’s also a 2010 movie called marmaduke. It’s a lot better than this.
Hey Danny. Thank you for making me laugh out loud during my depressions. It helps with the sadsies! You remind me of one of my friends who I miss dearly.
The dog training is too intense and nonsense for the actual thing, especially when most breeds don’t need this much confirmation.
There is an uncomfortable amount of fetish in this kids' movie
hol up, did they just never solve the fact that the family is massively in debt? Like, Marmaduke didn't win the competition and even if he had, that still wouldn't have covered their bill, so, are they just still in crippling debt?
This was the funniest vid I’ve seen in a while lol
Fucking dog trainer is Michael vic
I’m gonna watch this movie I’m him
Ngl this would be a great movie with a bunch of high friends
Imagine 3:17-3:23 out of context
well if the dog ranger  himatise Marmaduke 1 it menes this for free and 2 he will be the villan
I think this movie is actually less than a zero Because Marmaduke is an already existing property - a comic strip, and then later on a 2010 movie based on it, which wasn't super horrible. This movie genuinely looks worse than 2010 3D animation. How did they get J.K. god damn Simmons for this???
i think that these days movies are too corparate and sensitive to actually be good because they worry more about offending people then making good movies
what did my boy eat wth 1.4M dolars of dog food💀💀
I mainly tapped on the video because that dog with that unnaturally round belly looked weirdly tempting to jump on top of, possibly resulting in something similar to the Thanksgiving fatality in “Mortal Kombat 1”.
I think this is a very very very very very very very very very very very bad movie.
the marmaduke live action movie from 2010 was so good tho nobody can tell me otherwise
Time out why does he sound like that Pinocchio sound mad weird😢
Bro I can't focus on the video, because his hair is hipnotising me. What the hell.
0:10 fAAhther, WHen can I LEaave to BEEeee OoOn mYyy ooWWWnnwnn?
Sometime I forget how hot Danny is
They really spent all their money on getting Pete Davidson to voice marmaduke and J.K Simons to voice Zeus
Bro's got me tearing up at Firehouse Subs
you make the legs skinny for the character model when there’s a lot of fight choreography, avoid the hard work by animating less
They are shorting the stock.
7:37 the bite of '87!?
why does moose or whatever (was it posidon or hades or smthn?) have eyebrows that are a completely different colour than his fur?
You look like if tiktok was a person
First issue: Pete Davidson.
15:08 I feel like this movie should have been a superhero movie, maybe then the plot and feats of this movie would make sense
pixar mom syndrome had me cackling.
November 10 1975: The Edmund Fiztgerald sinks on lake superior The dad: That dog!
I just got a Grammaly Ad in the middle of Danny's Ad Read
the non animated marmaduke is good
This movie's animation style is so viscerally revolting, WHY was there so many toxic fart clouds
13:54 bro they made us watch it in school 😂
The cutest thing on the internet is this adorable young man holding up his fists and calling dukes "dueces".
Why is Zeus built like a brachiosaurus?
At 10:12 and 10:18 😂😂😂
A 10:12 😂😂😂 and
I have
Watching this beats watching Hazbin Hotel any day.
I watched instead of the move,it was way better. My family and I were going to watch this as movie night and after the first few minutes we immediately stopped watching it.
what i found to be funny is there is an obedience school listed in the final check, the trainer didn't even do their job fully.
Fr got one piece character
Marmaduke: Writer's Poorly Disguised Fetish
well it is time for me to bleach my eyes and go to the moon with vector because I don’t know what I just seen right now😑
The dog caused Chernobyl
I'm stoned right now and hearing you say my name messed with my brain right now.

2:17 lust
Why is he making it so funny😂
My parents set this up for dinner together because my mom thought it might be cute, and we couldn’t stand it.we had to turn it off 20minutes in because it was so horrendous. 💀
I saw it when I was 9
I wish they got JK Simmons as the British guy. He just has a history of acting as great mentors.
Sometimes I think there should be an age limit to movies.
the original film and comics were... fine
17:19 got me😂😂😂😂😂😂
15:35 Domain Expansion
im amazed they got jk simmons to play zeus lmao
I really tought it would be a Analisys and opinion video
THE FACT MY LITTLE BROTHER WATCHED THIS MOVIE THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH WITHOUT DELETING NETFLIX GENUINELY SURPRISES ME
1:15 best part
I have only seen one of the old live action marmadukes as a child. I and my sisters loved it❤. This seems like a movie that I would have hated...even as a child😂
"i made a fart fetish scene in a movie" YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL YOU ARE NOT REAL
Marmaduke had a unique style in comics and it's wonderful to see Hollywood threw it in the trash and pumped out this hot chud of a nothing to represent it in motion picture form.  Truly worthless, commendable!
Musta been made by peta 😂 except they didnt murder the dog
Idk, i know the bulldog picking up the entire building was neat, However.. i think the dog that used an entire fucking domain expansion kinda wins it
0:10 he sounds so zesty💅
The title should’ve been “is Netflix making bad movies on purpose? :3”
I don’t know how you can compete against an opponent that literally mind controls the audience to route for him
I remember our class watched this in 3rd grade and we didn’t hate it, I think we laughed a lot though.
KEEP THIS KID FRIENDLY OR I WILL REPORT YOU!
Don't forget about documentaries
for me, it's weird to call anything other than flowers, decor and clothes or anyone other than people "pretty"
6:05 what the heck happened to his legs, why do they look like repainted sticks. One smack from this dog and this guy won't be able to walk again
Why does he looks ai?
"trophy for the dog competiton and he farts and he shits and he farts so hard I think he might be dying" - danny 2023
Marmaduke......Marmadoo......Doo doo?!? It's all coming together
Greg is love,Greg is happiness,Greg is life.
I watched this in school and everyone in my class was watching it like it was a regular everyday good movie and I was just like, "What the dog doing?" it was so stupid.
this looks like foodfight
the dog is just causing natural disasters wherever he steps
I honestly didn’t think marmaduke was that bad.
It wasnt magic it was holograms come on damny
Joshua and the promised land
I was born on Mars in 3069
6:50 was a legit spit take through the nose
i saw the actual marmaduke movie a long time ago where it was live action and it's 100% better than this animated marmaduke movie that came outta nowhere
I was looking at the moms and realized... We have a bunch of kids, and at a certain time half of them grow extra wide bones, and from that point on, the other ones are hypnotized into trying to get with the wide-bones no matter what! They wear special clothes that feature their support wide bones! Did you see the wide bones in the middle of that person? I'll do ANYTHING to get close to those bones! She walks, and those bones just sweep back and forth, and I'll risk my life to get near that pelvis! Seriously, why is her pelvis WIDE? it's really WIDE MAN! So wife that's there's probably a gap in the middle but enough for a baby's head, and i can't stop thinking about it!
They made a live action Marmaduke movie and it was awful, but this was worse
Use DVDs and the movies are permanently yours. problem solved!  I never had a problem watching bad movies using DVDs.   If it isn't good enough to put on a disc, the movie is bad
From the director of SPAWN.  Yeah ... figures.
No. The bulldog didn't lift the building. Let's get it straight; the bulldog lifted the building he was *inside*  The bulldog was *inside* the building, and he *lifted* it. From the inside
DID YOU JUST PUNCH A FUCKING JOLE IN YOUR WALL
See young one, this was based on a comic strip that used to be in newspapers. Oh crap.. Ok so a newspaper was like a group of webpages printed daily on paper.... Just look it up.
When i saw the first clip i thout it was jimmy neutron from 2009
Im pretty sure I watched this and enjoyed it 😭😭😭😭 Ive improved so much
"he's got bigger fish to fry" Pretty sure the dad was grilling burgers and sausages.
The whole movie is so visually offensive and like, all the other senses, spiritually too
I like the comic better
dude the evil dog is sosexy
If my parentes say that we should watch this movie im going to make them watch Thomas and friends Misty Island rescue.
18:24 so fuccccing cute.
considering marmaduke has the ability to travel across the world, the overseas powerplant explosion was probably him
Hundredth time rewatching this, still disappointed Danny didn't make a "marmadeuces" up at 6:13
Obviously I can't know for certain but I'm pretty sure me as a kid would've hated this movie if I ever saw it
That dog looks like the conspiracy uncle of scooby doo
Okay Jesse looks like luz, but he also looks like Jesse from infinity train
Lmao “he kicks the dog” that’s why Pete Davidson signed up for the role
I watched this with my 28 year old sister a few months before this video, because my family likes watching children's movies 😭 But well, she enjoyed it
YOOOOOOO IM GREG NOW
0:51 there is one redeeming quality you can use the clips to make memes
The character design is just...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤢😡
How the hell did this movie manage to get less percent on rotten tomatoes than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom?💀
Ok, but why is the cat built like Kim Kardashian?
19:24  BRO IS NOT EMINEM 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔈🔈🔈🔥🔥🔥
I LOVED THAT FLIM AS A KID …. Man oh wait its the bad one
This aged well
I know this video was posted a year ago but I wish I could tell this guy that there’s going to be a horror movie on Mickey Mouse 😭
I thought Danny actually punched a hole in the wall at first.
The original live action marmaduke was actually decent but this… like what the heck
How did Danny repair the wall so quickly
It's  2024 for me
OMG Danny!!! You HAVE to review Netflix's "Leo"!!! It's aperfect movie! And I didnt realize I had notifications off. Now that they're on, am I Greg now?
pete davidson is such a whiney, irritating, talentless, twerp. he is a mediocre comedian. he is annoying. the only SNL cast member less entertaining than pete davidson is kyle mooney.
I looked down and looked back up to Drew on my screen 😭😭😭 I was so confused
do kids even care if pete davidson voices a cartoon carachter?? do they know who pete davidson is??
"not so great dane" thats SO FUCKING FUNNY
why is Guy kinda...😳
I have faint memories of watching the live action marmaduke from when I was younger ,with Owen Wilson, and instead of a dog competition it’s a dog surfing competition
The thing about a power plant exploding because the dog is what happens in the sequel
i can hardly even watch this video I can't imagine watching the movie
bru ur nose is 3 times the width of ur arm
I watched the old live action movie and had no clue this existed
Bro shitzue is an actual breed and my dog that really offended her
Marmaduke used to be a comic series in the 50s
That isn’t 1.5 million That’s 1.5 BILLION
The cat sounds like Peter griffin from family guy
Danny are you not in whiplash
Maybe guy called him not-so-great-dane, bc marmaduke is a great dane? Danny, use your brain
i liked this..
99% of netflix movies are so bad
You missed an opportunity to say "they put their dukes up"
I feel bad for Pete honestly 😂😭
15:43 FROM THE INSIDE NO LESS!
"pixar mom syndrome", that killed me
IVE SEEN IT WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND I LOVED IT I REMEMBERED RIGHT AWAY FROM THAT DOG AND FAMILY.
What is the point of this entire video this movie is clearly intended for kids
reminds me of the book showoff by gordon korman
it would be morally okay to fight marmaduke because he's an intelligent being capable of malice and thus is able to give informed consent to the duel
I watched it…need I say more? 😭
I won't even watch a movie on Netflix anymore if it has an "N" (Netflix Produced) on it.
I am an old lady and this is the first time I’ve ever been able to like or comment on any of these 🎉 I think this means that you won the Internet. Because I am dyslexic.
Wtf happened to the talent pool? Question what is pete Davidson's talent🤷🤷🤔🤔someone please help me out because l dont know and lm sure lm right about his talent (lack of)
i dont know why its kinda funny this part 2:36 is one of the most replayed
When I was younger I was obsessed with the old and not cartoon version of this movie and this pains me
I watched Marmaduke last year on new years at a friend’s house, not a good way to start the new year
You look like my ex.
if elsagate was a movie tbh
this is the most horrifying thing i have ever seen. it's udder degeneracy.
Like if you thought any of these are funny Comment if you know what show these are from  “I’m just trying to understand here” “You cant do that” “Are you dumb?” “HE CAN HIT!” “How do we walk ever?” “They said that to me at a dinner” “You said: It’s the cigars you smoke that are gonna give you cancer” “Does that sound boring to you?!” “Nope, he yells” “🎵it was also the night that the skeletons came to life🎵” “Garfield!” “Who took my cigars?” “I DONT KNOW HOW” “Did I mention there is a shirt there that casts 500$ bc the patterns so complicated” “Hes just crying bc he knows I used to be a piece of shit” “It’s not real mom, it’s a gibgab” “Great, i dont have to go to work tomorrow” “Don’t swear!” “It’s illegal for you to ask me that” “I don’t want to be around anymore” “I’m gonna kill this guys dad” “These people were like no one, like they didn’t even exist” “Santa brought it early!” “Tables!” “I’m not a teacher” “My phone looks really cool!” “You don’t wear it was a joke, bc it’s not a joke” “That gorilla just took my hair?!” “I can’t now fight my ex-wife’s new boyfriend” “WHAT YOU DO!!!” Also comment your favorite line from the show
10:15 You're not half wrong. Marmaduke from symptoms I've seen was experiencing GDV (Gastric Dilatation Volvulus) which is condition that is life threatning for dogs if not treated in time. It usually happens to big or deep chested breeds like the great danes. I did a homework project on it and the fact that is potrayed as a joke hurts my feelings.
Damn, the mom's booty is big af. Holy crap, look as those hips.
Ok your hair is so magically wispy I love it!
WHY DID THEY RUIN MARMADUKE (Theres a live action old one and it is just 😍😍😍)
The movie is so bad there is a character Calle guy. Bruh they must have run out of names.
Yes they are - as they are funded by the China (our arch enemy) Film Cooperative - or something named like that - 230ml and we have to put up with this utter rubbish.  I just heard Julia Roberts is in a new movie about the end of the Earth and it is so dark.  TYPICAL DEMOCRAT UNDERHAND TOXIC C R A P
You can’t ban me from the party :( - this weird dog with the weirdest voice actir
I would personally be scared as fuck
Theres a live action movie about this
The animation gives me hoodwinked ptsd
When I watched this, I struggled to keep the vomit in. You know what that means!
Why does Danny's head look weird in the thumbnail?
i mean the mom tho
I think that it would have at least been a 1 out of 10 if it didn’t turn into a deviant art fanfic at the dog show
4:44 imagine the dad watching 9/11 and just screams THAT DAMN DOG!!!
the cgi in this movie has regressed by 27 years.
They ruined the actual marmaduke movie 😔the original was hilarious
I hate this The actual live action marmaduke is such a nice movie and has a lot of thought and emotion put into it while this is just a stinky wannabe cashgrab representation of what marmaduke actually is
I watched this movie on a flight and it is worse than Danny says it is, he was being kind in this vid, Marmaduke was an awful movie, thank you for informing the people Danny
Fact.  99% of what Netflix produces is trash.
Oh, finally someone talked about this movie I was about to call the priest    (For legal reasons that was a joke)
I am Greg now. I Greg.
An asteroid about to hit earth The dad: *DIGIDY DA-*
there is a not animation marmaduke novie and it’s actually pretty good
My teacher placed this as a movie during lunch. It was absolutely terrible we couldn’t express how horrible it was.(not even the teacher)
Pete Davidson's rap is up there with Brian Wilson's "Smart Girls" and Dee Dee Ramone's "Funky Man."
They also copied and pasted the words on the bill 😂Lol I
Crazy how your narrations make these movies 10x better
So funny
the hell thous cheerleaders laughing at? one of them look like her name is gretchen and the other is definitely the token fat girl aka the bottom of the pyramid
What’s worse, they’re doing this deliberately because some people will still watch it (basically the studio equivalent of SSSniperwolf content) OR this is genuinely the best they can do?
19:53
I don't know what they want to achieve by making A.I smarter and making children dumber 😢
Greg tech
You look mad in the thumbnail
an ad perfectly cut you off right after you said tortured
if you could have the O_O face but add a disgusted frown that would be my reaction to this movie
I was tortured to watch this whole cartton in school.
My reaction is e
I'm pretty sure my school showed us this in 4th or 5rh grade
8:33 - ζ ?
I do not feel as if I agree with the fact: "Danny Gonzalez can write a simple sentence such as the title of a YouTube video." due to the facts stated: There is no question mark. (basic thing to know), Every word is capitalized. (It appears as if he is doing it so his grammar checker won't yell at him). Due to the facts previously stated, I think it is fair to say Danny Gonzalez cannot spell.
12:32 How did you fix your wall?
I remember this movie, this was a remake of another movie.
view count for me is 9,282,258
Zeus was voiced by J.K. Simmons. Just think about that
Also, can we also just agree that Pete Davidson is the most unfunny human being alive
19:50 pov you’re giving your boyfriend a under the desk BJ but he starts talking about some random VPN company:
I wonder how long bro spends on his hair.
wtf i trough scoobdy was prgnat
This animation style makes me so uncomfy😬
My whole 6th grade class was forced to watch this after staar testing.
12:11 I seriously got an ad before the vase fell
The animation is HORRENDOUS
this movie made me want to kill myself
diversity hires everywhere.
The credits animation looks better than rest of the movie
O
My little cousins put this on while I was playing KOTOR in the same room   Darth Revan was the least of my problems, I’d say. 15 minutes in I was silently hoping to silently go blind and deaf
you look like youre the knockoff version of someone who doesnt even exist
this movie is unhinged
this made me unreasonably hungry
1:01
4:23
i saw this movie before and it was genuinely so hard to watch that i think the credits were better than the rest of the movie
Why are all of the colors neon? I feel like I’m getting eye cancer…
They ruined Marmaduke, this is nothing like the live action
When I watched it I went out when marmaduke got crushed and made him die
I was forced to watch this at the start I was trying to convince my dad to turn it off cos the thumbnail looked like the part where he sharted in the trophy
you know you hate something a lot when you love it
They just had to go with that eyesore animation style that illumination uses for every movie
_😬_
I think potty humor or eat-a-ton-of-food humor can be kinda funny sometimes even in kids' movies but this movie took it so damn far it's in the like "author's barely disguised fetish" zone, which is egregiously inappropriate for a childrens' movie.
A movie with 0% on rotten tomatoes is something I didn't even know was scientifically possible
I just watched and WTF zigs so trashy I need 9 breaks in the movie WHHHYYY DOES IT EXIST
Kids content is light hearted body horror
Me seeing this after watching the movie and thinking it was good😅
dude i used to read the comic strip. wow, they must have been smoking some strong stuff in the writing department.
It seems to me that Pete Davidson just doesn't care what he's in, only caring a bit too much about making money, even if that means throwing his dignity to a run down Chinese factory with zero regulations. In a way I don't care if a man wants to make some money but dayum this man just does not care. Sounds like he wouldn't mind getting dicked down every man on earth for a quick buck.
No one’s talking about how the original marmaduke was a staple in their childhood? Am I the only one??
I can’t tell if this is poorly disguised fetish content targeted towards kids for reasons I don’t want to think about or just really out of touch writers attempting to be funny
Has no one seen the original live action?
by the way, Zeus is voiced by fucking JK Simmons
this movie would win an academy award if it was released in 1358
How did Zeus lose? I mean he's both a famous podcaster and a Viltrumite!
what
I remember watching this while I was at daycare when I was younger for a activity and our group walked in when the fart scene was on and I remember physically cringing.
As soon as I heard "I actually like pete davidson"...I knew this wasn't the place for me
I HAD TO WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH MY COUSIN AND I KEPT LAUGHING BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT WAS 😭😭
why was I under his desk?
Ngl this would've been a cool idea for a movie about a dog trainer who can talk to dogs (hence explaining why only Guy is able to talk to Marmaduke) if it weren't for the poorly executed animation and weird plotline... At least this is slightly better than the Pixar rip-offs lol
ur like a wayyyyy sexier drew gooden
Maybe they are... Make a bad film, then people tell other people how bad the film is, then those people watch the movie to see how bad it is.
There is another Marmaduke movie it came out 2010 and was my fav movie to watch when I was younger.
I remember when my teacher put this on while we were stuck in class, I was in 6th grade and the 8th graders had their finals so we stayed in class for a few hours, so she put this on and all of my classmates were cringing so hard while it was playing.
I had to watch this movie in school once💀💀
The part where marmaduke gets fat feels like a fetish
Damn that Vore/shat fetish do be hard in the movie
Father when can I leave to be on my own 💅
the rendering in this movie is so bad too it's hard to believe this is even made by netflix
4:17  HAAA HAA HAHA HAHAHAHAH
This is my own personal Shark Tale.
This movie looks like one of those random, unknown movies you find complete on YouTube
I’ve seen the live action of marmaduke and it acc wasn’t that bad 😄😄
2:39 the bouncing egg joke kind of cracked me up
0:09 I swear to god that sounds like somebody I know
This is basically if the writers of Johnny test made a movie   I will not be explaining further
Yes
They sayin "all hail zeus" like its ancient greece
WELCOME BACK TOOOO... "The writer's barely disguised fetish!" FOR KIDS! Zoophillia, Fart/scat fetish, Vore/Fattening, We got EVERYTHING!
Why the fuck does marmaduke look like a kangaroo when he was sitting on the dad
"Chemical weapon"💀 11:19
Bro? 💀💀💀 10:10
That shit had me 💀 9:17
"This movie is just heinous" 💀💀💀
I had to watch it as a kid in 2nd grade
at least the comics were good.
Note to self, don't watch this video while eating
13:55 I watched this movie 😭 before this vid came out I watched it a few years ago💀💀😭
Its like if you showed an AI the live action scooby doo movie and told it to make a prequel based on the garfield movie
4:24 IS THAT A GEOMETRY DASH REFERENCE??
bio weaponry
This movie really only exists because Marmaduke is a mildly popular comic so whoever got the license to it were probably thinking that they could make the next Peanuts movie by drawing in the comic crowd, but with a cheaper budget and without adhering to the original source material or art style in any way shape or form
so the plot of the movie is basically marmaduke being a menace to society
still better than velma
The Pixar mom syndrome hit me laughing
me and my family watched this movie...and they loved it except me-
I feel bad for whoever else is in that house like all the sudden you hear from upstairs “ he’s not a loser Marmaduke is a great Dane”😂😂😂😂
18:32  This shot is gonna give me nightmares; his gumless teeth frighten me
At 2:16 all I thought was VEGGIE TALES
I don't know if I watched this once before or just watched another video about it, because parts of it feel familiar but I can't imagine that I actually bothered to sit through the whole thing?
I got a condom add while watching this
I GOT A FEBREEZ AD FOR THIS
I watched this as a LEGAL child while I was sick and can say I almost projectile vomited when the first dog show happened... Wait no NO I vomited through the entire movie
Omg please do 3 pigs and a baby once your back from paternity leave, it’s just as amazing as it sounds.
6:04 marmaduke just rips out johnny kage's spine mortal kombat style
Father.. When can j leave on my own😫💅
what did they do to scooby😭😭😭
My 4th grade teacher forced my class to watch it💀
Nuh uh
Animator students need to pay their debts, does not matter if they good or not, work gotta be done, hole need to be dug, trees burn, $$$ ??? and just maybe you will have something to eat
this guy is pretty funny. i wonder if he has a second channel.
@ 6:58 no.
Marmaduke is responsible for 9/11
My son watched this. A day later he died of unknown causes. I think this is why.
The old Marmaduke was good
father when i can i leave to be  on my oooooeeewn😫💅🏻
I freaking love this YouTuber, I never seen any of his videos but this one and him criticising the movie hasn’t made me laugh that hard in a while 😭🤚
I watched this and now im a depressed.
are we not gonna talk abt the fact that when he was fighting the trainer and he was abusing him he didn't die but almost died to a camer pole droppinf on him ?
the song at the start of this movie sounds so weird  it literally goes like:  WOWOOOOOAAAAHH WOOOAH!  BAAAW BAAW BAAW BAAW *random mumbling*
Poor marmaduke 😢😢😢
FETISH MOVIE
In german it sounds way better I am german and I like the movie
Marmiduke is a Great Dane and I’m pretty sure Zeus is an afghan hound
Lol this is so funny but in an objective way😂😂
GYAAT
This is truly a movie I know this is unoriginal
I watched the movie a few months ago, and yes, it made no sense. A talking dog, who wants to be ‘loved’, then trying to win a dog competition but then someone cheats… I don’t know at this point.
Good job $9000
Because your entertainment is a necessary evil to get you to watch it. Its like a shitty mother that has to feed her kids and hates her life because of that. If you are that kid that sloppy ass crappy sandwich she made you will also suck like a shitty movie.  They are not movies. They are programs that are designed to  program your subconscious mind and get the masses to reason the way they want them to and have them all not even notice it. The TV screen is the most powerful brainwashing tool the world has ever seen.
me and my best friend Leah watched this as a joke and now it’s our little inside joke 😭
Watch the live-action version of Marmaduke from 2010. It’s THOUSANDS of times better.
i want to die after seeing this. . .
7:38
"At first I thought this guy was gonna be the villain of this movie, because he's like rich and British" -Danny Gonzalez
Netflix mostly buys movies, they don't really make them.
wtf is the woman design
What did they do to my boy marma duke
3:23 6:00
Netflix ruined the original marmaduke movie from 2008 by making this disaster.
“Worst movie you’ll see this year” jokes on you I just got done watching space dogs 3 🐕
I hate the dog’s ears so much.
One day he’s not gonna say “Greg” at the start of his videos and I don’t know if I can take that
There shows are good, there movies suck ass
This video needs to be shown in schools.
I. HATE. THIS. MOVIE.
I think that marmaduke can understand English and guy can understand dog
I watched it.
I realized, if I get a lot of money, then i can immediately become a British pixar supervillain. I now have a life goal.
the funny thing is when i clicked on this video there was an add for a netflix movie that seemed bad
You look like an AI charcter
6:32 my dad about my cats be like
There is actually a deleted scene in Zapped where the protagonist gets a lot of boys to beat up a dog for fun. It aired in the Japan cut, which is a lot more disturbing than the original, there’s swearing and the protagonist is really creepy and unlikable, and this isn’t true, all of what I’m saying is a lie.
2D animation would have suited this movie so much better than 3D
ive seen full cgi movies look better then this
It's beyond me how Pete Davidson played such a huge roll in this movie
You are right indeed. 6:19 6:21
As someone who was on deviantart for years I have the wonderful ability to pinpoint every fetish in this movie
It's actually sad cause the original Marmaduke  movie in 2010 wasn't that bad. This is just "Sad"
I liked the older live action Marmaduke! It was silly and lighthearted. The dogs moved in believably real ways, even with human expressions--they used CGI well
They made us watch this in school... absolutely TRAUMATIZING
Cesar Milan is that trainer
Marmalade should be put in a high security prison
“Father when can I leave to be on my own?😩😩”
Anyone else find this films visuals to be somewhat reminiscent of a MeatCanyon animation?
Bro Netflix has fallen off so bad nowadays
Bad movies are like bad clothing, they only wear or watch them for attention, just like shoes where you can see each toe
Please, I'm begging someone to confirm that I'm not the only one immensly disturbed by the way Marmaduke's mouth/upper lip looks and moves. It looks like outer labia. It upsets me so much I barely got through the video.
That dog is a terrior-ist
I've seen my dogs trained by a few different trainers and they were all incredibly terrible people. They would sometimes take on multiple dogs at once and just throw them in a kennel in their garage. They would put chain collars on the dogs that woud choke them if they misbehaved. Both my dogs had vastly different personalities and their responses were as follows:  The regal spoiled brat would obey, but he would tear up and not look at myself or my parents. The sweet heart who loved food cried loudly. It absolutely broke my heart to watch some of the training and also knowing where they were being kept when we weren't there. They were utterly terrified the entire time. They would often piss themselves and get punished harshly for it. Even my parents had a difficult time convincing themselves that this was for the benefit of our dogs. Eventually however, they realized that the only thing they were doing for our dogs was traumatizing the shit out of them. When the decision was made to bring them home and never trust any trainer ever again, the damage was quite evident. They were prone to aggressive fights with each other, even growling violently at us, and had crying episodes as well as a ton of seperation anxiety. If any of us left the house at all, they would walk to the door and cry loudly. Never trust trainers. Ever.
Marmaduke looks like the test animation they make between storyboarding and actually animating it.
5:42 HES LITERALLY WILLY (William Afton)
10:53 my dog pees inside and always does it at the bottom of the toilet. As mad as it makes me it’s funny asf. How does he understand that.
Is this supposed to be based on those comics with the same name? One kids these days would have no idea what it is.
This is worse than foodfight
The reason why they keep making terrible a*s because their probably lazy as F letting AI do the work while their sitting down drinking their smoothie
I'm pretty sure for pinocchio they literally WERE fucking with us lol. they knew what they were doing.
Your sound effect on the fart lmao
you look ai generated
emolol per nala
I actually had a shih tzu  They love kids with THEIR LIVES
I figured Pete Davidson had committed some crimes, I just didn’t realize they were crimes against humanity.
2:13 I’m pretty damn sure the character designers office was in a potato farm where their only food was French fries cause apparently potato and fries are the only shapes they know. And the mom was based on the farmers wife. (Where else do French fries go? The thighs)
This is my baby cousins favorite movie. Please send prayers.
Once my teacher made us watch this and everyone who was watching it was saying “what?”, I don’t blame them
6:35
The animation in this movie has the same issues as the animated Addams family movies
every time I saw the animation of this video play I felt distress. The character designs deserve to be put into a horror movie and the way everyone and everything moved was just unsettling to watch
Missed opportunity for the joke that he "marmaDUKED" it out with the trainer.
Did bro just punch a hole in his wall because of a terrible movie😂😂😂
Ok, but that tsunami that came from the pool… marmaduke falling from the window did that? Sorry but even for cartoon logic it just came up like a erupting volcanoe
Ughhh… I watched the live action version a few years ago, and it was just as bad. I watched it with my family, and we stopped watching it halfway through, it was that bad. We’ve never stopped watching a movie before. It was that bad.
the fucking credits is better than the god dam movie i would watch paint dry for my entire life instead of watching this movie
How tf was Marmaduke ever supposed to compete with a dog that can lift a convention center, a dog that can mass hypnotize people, and a dog that can create a Reality Marble? No shot.
my brother watched this movie in class and he is traumatized
This movie has 0 connection to thr Original script to the original, plus carlos is a drug addict
watching this i was playing a game about a bee 4:08
6:10 putting their duces up? i thought it was putting their dukes up. putting their MARMAdukes up
This video made me laugh so hard that I sometimes had to pause between jokes because my stomach was hurting too much
Hi
the star wars joke with the long bill was probably the funniest part of the entire movie
“UuUH oOhH” fucking gets crushed into a pancake
wait.. did Marmaduke win or lose? If he won, how?? All the other dogs did way more impressive stuff tf....
There making low budget movies but there fun to roast
I liked Marmaduke:(
19:51 owo
Now do the paw patrol mighty movie, it’s SO good
I wish Netflix woul dossapear because it sucks in every appareance. TV 1000 id better.  Why? Well because TV 1000 is from Viasat Family. TV 1000 makes better classic and hollywood movies. When you watch TV 1000, you feel Premium but when you watch Netflix, you feel UNpremium. TV 1000 IS KING OF MOVIES.
Marmaduke is not a terror to the family he is just punished and he wasn't beating the dad its because Marmaduke wanted to go in the chair SO HES NOT A TERROR TO THE FAMILY.
I have
The only redeeming quality is the mom’s cake
I don't even consider this movie a film, I consider it a torture method for my siblings
Bruh that movie was made in 2013 🤣
They made us watch this in math class 😕
I mean it was made in 2013 but it is still crap
This is the best show every btw im a Roblox kid
Why is this so funny 😭
Dannys vidoes are the only ones that make me laugh
I was also born on earth and I can confirm I hate this movie
The Pinocchio movie gave me Pinocchio being gay vibes “father, when can I leave to be on my owuhnnn..”
YES
I feel like Netflix movies are getting more  stupid every time they make a “animated” movie. RandomToaster, 9/26/23
the reason why is because netflix thinks they can pump out a bad movie but because its made for kids and they will eat it up
8:22 just creepy
Skip to 5:52 if you want crazyness
5:52 😂
Made me laugh so hard I coughed to the hospital 😂
This is the worst YouTuber ever I like marmaduke this is mean -infinite out of 0.1 horibble YouTuber worst ever
I watched 6 minutes im in so much pain
It might just be me but I thought it was ok
yes they are, they made a movie called cuties, look up info, dont watch the movie
The whole movie literally looks like a test render
i watched marmaduke with my friends and it was so bad that is was hilirious
I was 6 years old when i saw the movie What did i watch when i was younger at the end i thought he died
marmaduke oh yeah and the most important thing is marmaduke just typically marmaduke oh no don’t forget to say marmaduke because its just all about marmaduke
The Y in Billy looks like a cock and balls
There goes grandma 12:12
I'm someone who owns TWO great danes, and Marmaduke's design doesn't even look CLOSE to a great dane. You could look at it and say "Damn, that's just a big... Dog." Artstyles still have to make the exaggerated design of a real-world character or object still look like that character or object. For example, great danes have really big paws and big floppy ears, so it'd make sense to put it on a cartoonified great dane. This just looks like they told the designer to fit what they think a great dane looks like in the artstyle of this movie.
Marmaduke is a good movie
I was forced to watch this movie in middle school not only was it bad it was HELL.
Teachers be like: alrightbclass today we are watching a classic (insert bad movie you have never seen)
wait whys guy lowk kinda…
XD this video made me laugh lots of times XD
I watched this at a sleepover we were laughing for the entirety of the movie because it was so disgustingly bad
Bro I’m more interested in the dawn platinum ad than the actual movie
Bro shits then creates Chernobyl  that is not even a fucking joke.
6:25 wait, isn't that just straight up animal abuse!?!? Or even worse 7:20
5:17 i actually thought of that too because the way he looks.
4:16 "please let me in, i will be nice" *also causes a literall tsunami pontentially drowning little kids*
The dog is like "please can i go in, i won't hurt a fly" while literally making the family's life miserable.
I watched marmaduke and i can say i didn't dislike it but i didn't kinda like it either, it's just goofy in a weird way.
The minions is better than marmadook
You know this isn’t even a original movie,it’s a remake of a WAY better movie.
Tidal wave??????!!!!!!! GD
I remembered starting to watch marmadukea me like 20 minutes in i was literally crying and questioning my sanity.
Its called comedy
“ top 10 things dog trainers don’t want to to know! 😉…..They beat the spaghetti out of your dog! “
marmaduke is a horrible movie, but it is surprising to think that the animated was based on a live action version
Bouncing Egg should be Eric Cartman
he said ''hello greyyyy'' at the start my name is grey how does he know help me
I was about to watch this movie when i was bored and watching 5 minutes of this video saved my eyeballs from witnessing this thing of things
Just Want To Say I Love Your Grammar Where Did You Learn To Write Like That  (I am making fun of the lack of a "?" at the end of the title)
One Foul Fart
Just whating it recently, I get where you're coming from, and my FING SISTER!!! MY SISTER OUT OF ALL PEOPLE!!! LIKES this movie.. for fs sakes
Oh dear this movie is awful 🤢🤮
ima torture myself by watching this movie brb in a hour edit im half way in and its god awfull
while the fart scene was going on i got an ad for Febreze
The last movie i made got -100% rotten tomatoes
You know what idc if I’m late the first time I fucking heard about this move was from my damn 1st grade brother and my PreK brother when I watched this move I was like what the actual fuck
I wached the movie
I eached the movie and im a kid
i think netflix just made a furry fat and fart fetish movie
I’ll be honest, I’ve watched this like 10 times and I forget the ending every time because it’s so dumb.
So I'm high sitting on my couch and this video popped up on my suggestion page, and when I clicked on it he said "Hello Greg"  I legitimately thought he was talking to me and thought he could see me🤣
best movie ever not even joking im actually serious
The only thing that caught my eye when I was watching Marmaduke was whenever the damn dog just started running to Canada, Russia, and Egypt, I was just shocked.
It looks Luke off brand cocomelon 💀💀
Are we not gonna talk about how Marmaduke’s ear clipped through the window?
9:14 Marmaduke is really powerdul because he either converted all those other elements in the food to methane or he changed its phase from solid to gas really quick
3:21  omg i GYATT something in my eye right there..😮‍💨🤧
I watched it but i saw worse
OMG Greg backwards is Die
This movie was so STUPID, so UTTERLY BRAIN-NUMBING, and you expect us to be able to still use our BRAINS after that?!
This movie used to be on the TV video on demand section and my sisters use to watch it and rewatcih all the time. I cannot tell you how much I hated it
16:07 Did they really just copy the hypnotoad for this scene lol
HES ALIVE🎉 HES DEAD🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤✌️
Also my grandma made me watch it😭😭
I literally watched marmaduke when i was 8 i didn't realize how bad it was until now. Why the heck did i watch that.
I had to watch this in like 5th grade. Somehow not the worse thing I watched…. 🪦💀
I have watched the first 44 seconds and I feel like Danny is too young to remember how bad the majority of movies from the 80's and 90's were. I will now watch the rest of the video.
6:45 the lesson was you is the top dog
I searched "is danny gonzalez the fastest growing army on youtube" and it actually said yes! i dont know why but it said "Danny Gonzalez is the fastest-growing army on YouTube and has held the title since 2022. He refers to his army singularly as Greg. Danny started content creation on Vine, where he had at least 2.9 million followers. Gonzalez shifted to YouTube after Vine shut down in 2017." so i guess...
a jump to the sky turns to a rider kick
11:41 Actually I think I saw them in the background of the Movie; the Local Cheerleaders were actually at the dog show. 😂most likely was on the news too tho.
"father when can i be on my own😒" they did Pinocchio dirty💀 and he sounds like hes gay💀💀💀 (im nit saying i dont like lgbtq)
Such a weird butchering of the original movie and concept which from what I remember was actually good
ishowmeat
When i have the chance i will go on my phone when i watch it
My school forced me to watch like DANGANRONPA type torcher this movie was ASS 💀💀💀👎👎👎
I remember, I was in summer camp and apparently I wasn’t there, but my friends there were watching Marmaduke, and they asked if I wanted to watch and I was like, “Heck no!” because I watched this exact video (after the movie came out).
Cesar Millan is turning in his grave. Cesar Millan is not dead, but somehow this movie skipped that step.
Marmaduke feels like someone’s stuffing fetish 😭
Marmaduke is an Avenger's level threat
My kid did Watch it he didn't want to but he did
Today on “the writers barely disguised fetish!”
I love how bad the graphics are
4:53 he looks like danny??
They ruined marmaduke 😭😭
i swear to the lord above i watched Marmaduke years before it came out wtf. maybe its just the fact it gives off 1999 animated movie vibes or it was just that bad, idk
"Father when can I leave to be on my ownnn 😩"
My uncle made me watch marmadog 😭
10:02 you.. smell a dog's rear end?
6:35 this is the first video of you that ive seen to this extant but that was enough to know your where going to say word for word "beat the shit out of your dog" or maybe im just mentally instable which is true but still
You know....after discovering this movie.....we need to apologize to the Emoji movie....
12:10 - 12:12, NOT A LOSER, JUST A GROOMER 💀💀
I love marmaduke😡 I need an apology
I've watched this
It's kind of hard to take the third act seriously when its events were triggered by dog poop.
The animation of the end credits was way more aesthetic and stylistically fitting than the animation of the entire movie
my cousins watched this movie
J.K. Simmons was zeus
I once watched this and never saw the end so I thought he just died
I used to watch the live action marmaduke when I was little, it was like my favorite movie. WTH did they do to him😭??? I’ve never even heard of the cartoon
I feel like the person making this had some odd fetish
There's actually an original Marmaduke made in 2019 with owen Wilson as Marmaduke its not that good but it's definitely better than this 2022 version
Dont forget that in the credits, certain things that are worth thousands/ millions, should not even be priced at that amount, like there's dog food worth around like 1 million, and then theres just "food" not dog food, just "food" like, did he go to a restaurant, eat, and then say "you know what? they're gonna pay for my food" and then you notice that they paid for "ear straightening" when the results were unsuccessful.
11:22 bro released mustard gas
i was watching a crispy concords video and now i am here i dont know how danny has magical powers
It is very obvious that the creators have a fart fetish
This is Danny’s best hair era
I can name my favorite movies, Nightmare before Christmas took alot of time and effort and Wallace and gromit was hand made, while I like other movies DreamWorks and Pixar made, the bootleg films you see now tryhard too much and yes this movie does look like garbage. If your gonna make a sequel least put some effort into it and don't over do it. You know. Now if we're talking video game wise ratchet and clank was ok but needed more excitement. I'm on board with a spyro film or crash film or sly cooper film just hope young talent don't destroy it like r and c.
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87?! 7:36
My bother and sister watch this
i miss the old marmaduke with Owen Wilson
now i know how to make a nuke...
ARE YOU NOT GETING THE FACT THAT THE DOG TRAINERS FOOT CAME OFF HIS BODY AT 6:52
This hurt my life...I will never forgive you Danny
Honestly, the general plot the movie was built from could've actually been good if they didn't do anything that they did (with a few tweaks of improvement).  > an unruly dog that lives for destruction - in a logical sense and not causing natural disasters. The family has had enough of the trouble, having lost a lot of money in repairs and almost all of their relatives and friends, and so they hire a well-renowned dog trainer, who IS evil and seeks to train the dog for their own benefits and leave the family in the dust, of whom will never see their dog again. The dog is essentially in prison, with diets, rules, and training that restrict any fun or freedom. The training is actually done properly, with the goal in mind of making a well-mannered and well-groomed pooch. The dog is finally tamed, by way of fear, loneliness, and loss of the things it loves, and it goes on to win many awards. The family finds out on tv, but their efforts to get their dog back are futile. At one particular dog show, at the peak of the dog's career, the family enact this crazy plan to get back their dog, but their dog is stuck in it's tamed ways and refuses to leave the show. After many attempts, Then comes in the youngest family kid, the dog's best friend and the one that actually had fun in all of the chaos, because they're a naive and unresponsible child that the parents believe to have been badly influenced by the dog from a young age. The kid finally breaks the dog out of it's forced state of mind with it's favourite squeaky toy and a some play acting on the kid's part to get the dog riled up. The dog gets all excited, barks, and leaps into the kid's arms to lick their face. The family ends up getting a portion of the dog's earnings in shows and compensation for their troubles while the trainer is found out and sent away for their crimes. The family is now pretty rich and move into a bigger house with a huge yard that they dedicate entirely to their dog, and also a large pool. A happy family that works through their problems.  Boom! There's a story.
Is it me, or did you only just figure out this is also a cartoon? I only knew about the live action one
this guy reminds me of og mrbeast
The original Marmaduke will always be the best
why she move like the people from Marmaduke? ☠️
i made my mother watch marmaduke with me because of you.
More water came outta the pool that there was originally lol
Netflix has people in their basement, they work for their freedom by making crappy movies, the promise of being set free is the only think which makes them even slightly motivated to make these horrible things.
As a British person, i can confirm that we are evil
And yes kids have watched it
0:10 Pinocchio is a little zesty..🏳️‍🌈✨
They spent more money on Pete Davidson than the darn movie
that is not an innocent dog  that is a menace to society that should be killed
Just stick with the original Marmaduke comic strip.
I mean, getting in the news is the best way to advertise without putting any money into it
*
*E*
Please watch the real one made in like the 2000’s I wanna see your reaction on it because still, although he’s a bad dog he just gets in trouble for things that arnt his fault like when a dog starts chasing him, it’s so silly
Zues really got Miku ponytail physics for ears
For once a live action is way better than animated
netflix is known to make the movies ever😔
Why is the animation so ugly, its 2022.
hello greg
Marmaduke was originally a movie from 2010
how does danny not react to the dad literally exploding at 3:22?
The movie be looking like those rip-off clones from another movie
5:25 can we take a moment to look at the drift that he pulled off
I actually watched this, because I didn’t believe that Netflix made movies this bad. Needless to say, it’s 10x worse than how he described
The last time I watched the live action Marmaduke it was during my dentist appointment, and as bad as it was, it was so much better PLUS it has Owen Wilson voicing the dog.
I just wanna say for the record that imo Pete Davidson did a fantastic job as Mirage in Transformers ROTB so I think that's confirmation that he really didn't care for this movie and just half-assed it
No joke kids in my school had to watch this💀💀💀💀(yes I know I'm 1 year late,whatever)
They did Marmaduke so dirty. The original is actually (to me) a good movie.
They made the characters like that so that they cant get copyrighted by real life lol
What horrible things did they do to JK Simmons to get him to voice the villain
Y E S
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO EVER
Did you just forget the question mark at the end of the title on purpose
Yes but no but yes but no but yes but no but yes
I'm 12 (11 at the time), and I watched marmaduke because it was " at the top" in the uk, and I watched it, but every 13.4 seconds, I commented on every thing, it was so bad, and I was 11 and I'm still commenting as much as you
Real Marmaduke is fire tho ngl
okay but this is a remake of a movie that was already only 9% on rotten tomatoes.. like why would you remake a garbage movie?
Who else is waiting for MWS to react to this abomination of a movie 👇
I looked thru your account and saw that i only watched half of this video so i turned it on and happened to have paused on 13:20, now im scared
Whenever you feel like a total failure at something, remember than several people worked together to make movies like this
I would love to see danny watch the live action version.
Like a year ago I watched the first 46 seconds on marmaduke and was like “👁️👄👁️ yeah I’m not watching this”
Total complete disappointment and an abomination of a movie!
I watched this movie with my sister. It sucks so bad. But she loves it for some reason. She watched it with my grandma and I feel so bad to my grandma because it is literally the worst movie I've ever watched before.
8:05 i can’t believe u just barked about my grandma😢
As long as it’s not clone vpn
1:02 I thought it was an ad for it
7:35 my life
My 4th grade teacher put this on for us being so good. It was torture.
Hey a -6 out of 10 is also a 6 out of -10 so…
19:23 They've got their fingers on the pulse. It's the 1980s!
fly high, sugar. 🕊🕊🕊
This movie looks like it was made in sfm, and I feel like that’s overstretching it
I know a money laundering scheme when I see it
There were no bouncing eggs in the og Marmaduke and wheres the dads perfect mustache??
Fun fact:  my teacher made my class watch this for our movie day 💀
hes rich and british, hes gotta be evil
LMAO
After Transformers I think pete davidson is a pretty good voice actor
It's a bad thing the ATF don't exist in that universe, otherwise Marmaduke would've never detonated a chemical weapon.
Danny seems really easy to make in Mii maker
You will eat your words so hard
Yay! We’re not british!
dammy gonsalays
Bro my fucking sister watched this after you made the video, i laughed so hard when i saw her watching it in the living room. That experience was actually fucking hilarious.
Bro why did they build the mom like that???
bruh this was on my recommended really recently, why the actual hell would Netflix think i'd enjoy this flaming hot garbage?? 😳
I thought I was pretty funny but but I’m a child so I guess my mind is kind of different
like one year ago we watched this movie in our school and i fell asleep while watching it
Money laundering schemes I've connected the dots!
Ah yes pinochle and marmalade
Great video greg
13:48 "Innocent dog"
THIS IS A FETISH FILM???????????????????????????????????????? WHY IS IT ANYWHERE NEAR NETFLIX
I disagree the redeeming part of Marmaduke is the credits.
It's so bad that my lil brother had to watch this on a free day for his school
You mentioned the chatacter design and art but the animation is so god awful you can just feel how much the animators hate the project and/or have absolutely no time to finish it
How did they get Pete Davidson, J.K. Simmons, and David Koecher for this horrible movie?
My little brother watched this movie in school he told me that it was so weird for me I watch barely even like 3 minutes I logged out as quick as I could it was not good I tell you that now
Why do I think marmaduke is good?  :edit: I like the irl version better
This is why Marmaduke should’ve stayed in comics.
omg I had a burp stuck in my throat and it’s better now because of you
WHY DO I KEEP LAUGHING EVERY VIDEO I WATCH OF U-
My dog started barking at you when he heard you bark- omg
its so bad its good
netflix ruined marmaduke
My sister watches this movie😢
“Pixar Mom Syndrome” 😂😂
The funniest thing on the list 13:00 is the fact that pooper scooper is worth 4.99, not dollars, just 4.99
Art is subgective, and subgectively this particular art is a hot, smelly garbage can.
I’m a kid, I’ve watched this movie, and I’m never watching it again
Dude my family put it on bc my 5 YEAR OLD BROTHER. WANTED. TO WATCH IT. I left right after I finished but then... Guess what? I WAS CALLED BACK IN BC I HAD TO WATCH IT. I think I hate my family now.☺
The original marmaduke is so good the animated one is so bad
the original marmaduke is good but they made that "shudder" thing as a remake
R we gonna ignore that in his (I think) bedroom there’s just a picture of him drinking milk? 😂
0:10  he sounds gay asf 💅✨😩
lmao
the og marmaduke was way better
netflixxxxxxx
you made it sound like the funniest move yet.
I just know that if I saw this movie as a kid the image of that horrendous dog farting like a beast would be engraved into my mind forever
possible elsagate on Netflix maybe?
My teacher made us either watch this or help my math teacher (she was the best math teacher ever) glue a bunch of paper together for something she was making. More than half the class was helping out and our teacher let us sing to music until the movie was done because we finished early. That was one of my favorite school days ever.
Personally, I think that the trainer is speaking to Marmaduke through his own language, not the other way around. We are talking about a guy who is renown worldwide for his ability to train and discipline dogs. I think he’d have picked up a few tricks to understand and communicate with them along the way.
19:23 IM DA BIGGEST DOG AROUND 🗣🗣🗣🗣
why are american walls so weak
i watched it so i can comfirm this moovie sucks
I swear Netflix sat down like 100 people in a room and told them to slam their heads into the keyboard until they came up with something that even represents a...movie?
I remember watching this movie with my brother… After the whole fart bomb thing. This line perfectly sumed up my feelings about the entire scene: 11:08
Why does evrybody not like it a kinda like it
There is a live action marmaduke and it is a 7.4 out if 10 and it’s not make by Netflix
BE FOR REAL BC MY TEACHER PLAYED THIS
The characters look like the animated addams family movie
I`m a kid
rip the wall
this is my favorite video on YouTube.
Him talking about the movie is more funny than the movie
A bitch ass friend of mine likes marmaduke
The old one is actually good then they made this
this is amazing
damn, danny puts more thought in the movie than the producers themselves
I'm A kid and before u posted this I've watched maradook hundreds of times and the real life version also
Can someone tell me what rotten tomatoes are I don’t get that rating system
nigga whos greg
The version of Marmaduke I saw was actually pretty good, it wasn't animated so maybe real life talking dogs arent everyones cup of tea since not many people liked it but compared to THAT? The change is showing and it is noticiable, I suggest watching the non-animated one.
It's funny because Marmaduke was a movie a long time ago but I think they used real dogs with CGI to make them talk I saw it in theaters sometime in the 2000s
My whole 2nd grade class had to watch this movie
My god, stop looking directly at the camera.
Imagine laura hearing danny shout MARMADUKE IS A GREAT DANE!
Danny Is that hole still in your wall 😂
We had this movie on for out class party that the class VOLUNTARILY voted for
Right after I saw this my teacher played this movie in class.
i never knew deviant art was on Netflix
There is no WAY this movie was made in the 21st century
One time in school one of my classmates begged the teacher for us to watch this movie. We ended up watching it and all I thought was what was going on in his head. We were in 5th grade. 🐶
This show is my best friend's little brother favorite!
A cheer leader was at the show
8:05 8:34 ???🤨📸
My question is how Marmadu ( however you spell his name ) managed to survive getting eaten by a giant shark but not survive a pole falling on him?? Even if he did somehow dodge the shark or something how can can he not dodge a pole?

This video is -6x40(+12) funnier than the movies -6
We watched this movie at…    SCHOOL! I’m not even joking we did I swear
Danny why do u look like that
I been saying this for a while, not just Netflix but here’s why and it’s easy to relate to the why. You know there are always those who say “ I could have done better if given the chance” well, everyone who really sucked was given a chance and now we watch guano movies. Hope that splained it.
There are two traits to a villain: -Rich -British
Hmm I left a comment on this video 2 years ago I hate it even more
This movie was in my local theatre once
Marmaduke should be put down, he is a threat to society.
Bouncing egg looks like cartman from South park
This went from bet do gross
All I have to say is 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I love you putting hard work into this so we could enjoy it 😊I feel honored
Maybe those extremely skinny stick noodle limbs maybe works better on 2D drawings but looks awful on all 3 dimensions.
why do you have a picture of yourself drinking something in the background?
this is probably my favourite video
8:14 pause right here😂 WTF
the dog fart was worst than chernobyl
12:20 the editing was so good that i questioned whether the crack in the wall was real for a sec.
Me who liked the movie 🤡
Fun fact: there is a movie called marma duke and it’s not animated
9:59 AYO U HAVE SNIFFED A DOG BUTT BEFORE?!
I'm watching this naked on the toilet
It’s just a poorly disguised fetish movie
That was 9/10
Why did Pete Davidson do this
Bro marmaduke used to be a live action movie and it was goated but it was never on Netflix it was on cd
You don't like Marmaduke ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Imagine this but your in school,told that its movie day. With the dub of the life time,swedish. We where forced to watch this movie for an hour,with the worst swedish dub I've heard(except disney)
19:17 that "oh fck" was personal 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
It
I have Watched Marmaduke but ti was not animated and it was perfect it was nothing like that movie you watched
But to not so bad that they're good. Just bad.
11:58 chernobyl
e
8/10 movie,if the dog died at the end it would’ve been 10/10
MY YOUNGER BROTHERS ARE WATCHING IT FOR THE 21ST TIME
Is this not a live action movie I swear marmaduke was live action
There simply arent enough people talking about the fetish content in this movie. Its so gross.
The original marmaduke isnt that bad
Looks like video brinquedo has some serious competition
Why is no one talking abt how horrible the animation is
mmmmmm tax write off
That 2d animated part of the credits while Pete Davidson was singing looks better than the actual movie. I know it'd be a bit more work and budget, but it would have been great if they just did the whole thing in that style.
e
“you killed our youngest daughter-“ DAMN-
There’s actually a live action version of this well not a version, but it came out beforehand
Sometimes when I fart 😢
You missed the perfect opportunity to say "putting their Marmadukes up" before the fight scene.
I love being Greg
“Father, when I can I leave to be on my ownnnnahhh- 😩🧔‍♀️💅🏼”
They getting rid of all the actual good and well made movies/shows just so big mouth can get another 16 seasons and a 5th movie
I have the book down marmaduke
MY BROTHERS LOVE THIS FING MOIVE I SAID THEY ARE DUMB AS F
19:55 Your shirt tho 😩
guy has serious tumblr sexyman potential
My sister said you look animated...
i fell tf asleep during this ass movie broooooooo
It’s based off of a live action version
Pete Davidson top-tier I don’t care about anything anyone says Pete Davidson to tear
I've seen the original Marmaduke film, which was really good
Why you look AI generated
zeus got that rizz talent
There is a new version of marmuduke and its a really dog you need to see it
Netflix doesn't make the movies
We are all, we are GREG, we are all, we are GREG🗣️🗣️
As someone who doesn’t like Pete Davidson I don’t care that he ruined his career with this movie  But as someone who LOVE JK Simons, it is devastating to know he is in this movie
As someone with IBD, it’s really nice to finally have representation in media. I too have failed to make it to the bathroom and had to relieve myself in the nearest chalice…
I remember loving the live action marmaduke
that dog show just turned into chernobyl
My math teacher had us watch Marmaduke for the last day of school because we couldn’t pick one. Everyone was screaming throughout it.
19:50 I peed while he was staring at the camera and i've never felt more uncomfortable lmao
Why is this movie absolutely terrifying
I work with a 3rd grade classroom for summer school this year and we watched Marmaduke this past friday and holy shit i wanted to bleach my fucking eyes.
No but Guy is kinda..👀
This movie is just, no.
If the film is animated then its a very similar to how the videogame industry handles bad games. At a certain point in development everybody working on the project knows they are working on a piece of crap. Too much money has likely been sunk into that project to throw it out. So they just release it anyway and hope to survive the 'controversy', 'hate' or what have you. With how 'free for all' Netflix was and probably still is with handing out money to people with a show idea this can happen with quite frequency.
Movie: 6:01   Ad:dawn power wash
4:08 - 4:40 I'm dying!
Marmaduke created fucking Chernobyl
Fun fact: marmaduke was a comic strip like Garfield before this awful movie
I don't know if it was in US but where i live, this movie was in Cinemas
This movie is one of the movies where you know it’s going to be horrible when you look at the poster
i really love this episode. you are so funny<3
You know it's sad when the live action Marmaduke movie is better than this thing.
they might make bad movies so people talk about how bad the movie it is and get people to watch it to see how bad it is
He is not a loser he is a Nuclear weapon ☠️
Ima just listen to this while I’m going to sleep
Pete Davidson is everywhere at this point. He could be in your house right now!! Who KNOWS!!           No hate to the guy but damn I see him on a daily basis.
10:08 this part got me DYING 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Isn’t marmaduke originally a live action movie I loved that thing when I was younger
Old.
Look, the cartoon version is horrible but the realistic marmaduke movie is much better
Marmaduke has a “live action” version with some cgi imported, I watched it and it’s a good movie. The one you watched was definitely a copy.😒
I'm horrified that there could be a universe where people look like this and events like this happens
Not so Great Dane ain’t even a good insult. Shoulda called him a beta bitch 💀.
He never addressed is marmaduke actually won or if they got out of debt I’m just going to assume the worst
i legitimately, unironically believe this may be the single least creative movie on netflix. with the plot of winning a dog show (alongside basically every plot beat being done to death already), guy's lame-ass 'insult', the fake moral of 'believe in yourself', marmaduke's god-awful talent, zeus being disqualified in the most predictable way imaginable, and the shoddy excuse of a last-minute disney death, i don't think even a single aspect of this movie can be described as original in any way, shape, or form, and idk why but that frustrates me way more than any movie has before or since
The character models look like a mutation of character designs alike from Corpse Bride and Open Season.
I would name marmaduke marmapuke
10:11 bro shitted so hard that he became a weapon of mass destruction
Assuming Marmaduke is a movie for kids was a big mistake, it's actually an adaptation of a boomer newspaper comics yer grandparents used to read, and those were never funny
im pretty sure this movie ruined pete davison's career
The awkward second between marmaduke flying into the pool and all the water flying out killed me.  Here lies "Hi im ded inside" 20??-whenever now is o refuse to check the time.
I think guy knows what dog's say and dog's know what people say.
You know those sticky hands that you could get from a plastic round ball that you could get for like a quarter in an arcade? Ya well that’s what the dads arms look like *-*
Did nobody read the comic strip growing up?? It was actually kind of cute. I don’t think it has ever translated well to a movie though
its one of those scenarios where the company interprets all press as good press, therefore making a notable movie, even if its notable for being horrible, the movie is notable nonetheless, and so they will continue in a positive feedback loop until people stop giving them press and attention.
when u make a movie from paint 3d
Tbh the bulldog won the talent competition at the end
13:13 ain’t no one gonna talk abt how big her eyes are compare to her hands???
Crazy to think the dude who acted as the main antagonist in Whiplash also acted in this shit 💀
I bet the company spent all of there budget on hiring pete Davidson lmao
My friends classmate asked the teacher to put on this movie and she texted me about it “dude my classmate js made everyone watch marmaduke”
I swear when he said drew goodens biggest fan I heard Danny gonzalez
its so bad its good
What is the mom in this movie??? Pixar is that you????
I wanna pretend to be all mature and say "there is nothing funny about this movie at all !!" but I know if was back in elementary school, I would've been losing my shit...
I had to watch this movie in class and it was so strange
bro really did use the phrase “blame the dog” 💀🤌
I tried watching Marmaduke..i couldn't even get halfway through without wanting to smack my head on the wall. -100/10
I love Pixar for my love of milfs
Fun fact, marmaduke was the name of a life action movie of a talking dog. It was on dvd in I think 2014
17:24 *Takes out of context*
9:56 wait what 💀
3:16 I just realized the mom has jiggle physics in addition to a dump truck.
The first time I watched this video, I was doing dishes and admittedly, not really watching as much as I was listening. Now rewatching this, lemme just say WHY DOES THE MOVIE LOOK LIKE THAT IT HURTS TO VIEW WHO APPROVED THIS TO BE RELEASED???
I think is a money laundering scheme
Marmaduke was better in the comics
we had to watch this in science last year and the only positive memory i had was when we made a ouija board during it

prpurtionz r garbij
Marmaduke = Crud = Crap = HOT GARBAGE
The original marmaduke movie was so good why would they do this
This movie looks like if the animated Addams family and chicken little had a mange infested monster dog child from the darkest and bloodiest pit of hell. Satan himself does not look this abomination in its cold, lifeless eyes.
Ive watched this movie. Hes not over reacting its literally so bad.. its like something that came off of wish..
How old are you
2:14 greys anatomy wenday
I am still under your Desk, Danny.
aint no way they put a fucking FETISH in this movie.
This movie looks like it was bought off the epic games asset store
I love these dumb videos, they are so funny
Legitimately can't believe this VA is playing Mirage in the transformers movie. This knowledge is painful to me. *Mirage.* The character whose main personality trait is 'old money'.
Marmaduke Cinematic Universe
This movie is so bad that me and my sister that I find it funny and entertaining but I just can't believe it's a Netflix movie it looks like some obscure bargain bin movie you'd find somewhere. MY TRUE QUESTION IS WHY DID THEY JUST NAMED THE DOG TRAINER GUY AND WHY ARE ALL OF THEIR LIMBS SO SMALL AND THIN ?
My only gripe with this video is the lie that Marmaduke is innocent.
This is not Netflix this is 1 easy step to killing your self and hating humanity
im probably the only child who has seen this movie I was 14....and it was only because you talked about it
More like Marmadookie amirite
marmaduke is an insult to film making
Isnt this a remake? Theres a life action marmaduke but i dont remember the plot, same dog though
Marmaduke = Nightmare fuel 💀💀💀
I mean. Those women who get thirsty for the dog ARE white.
I wondered why marmaduke sounded so familiar then I searched it up and found out I watched the original 2010 marmaduke as a kid
The original, a.k.a., the real life version of Marmaduke was actually good
Anyone know there was an original marmaduke movie?
Danny reviews these like a grandpa thats mad kids keep playing on his side of the lawn
Why does the "I gotta eat" line from the credits song sounds exactly like Kurtis's "I gotta eat!" from his video about that Goblin movie?
'Marmaduke, buddy, please wake up' THE END

It actually me sad actually cuz he not trying to be bad. He’s got personality. I have to remind myself it’s a cartoon and not a real dog
This video has more views than the movie trailer of marmaduke
Danny, you’re a not-so-great dane
there is a marmuduke that is live action and it is way better
“Aw F*CK! He’s alive.” -Danny Gonzalez 2022
turned on notifacations, guess i am truly greg
I Wach lt
has anyone ever wondered how cool it would be to actually be called greg, so when watching danny’s videos, you have your name in the background and are repeatedly referred to as your own name? just me?
🐶
i watched this movie up until the first scene becuase it was so bad
Faaaaaather when can I leave to be on my oooooooownnnnnnnnnnn!
welp i geuss am the first ten year old to watch this movie i geuss then lol
11:20 - 11:30 somehow this one bit from Danny made me laugh harder than the entire movie did.
I have a 3 year old. I've watched it about 30 times. Lol
Marmaduke plot armor
But thats just my opinion
I honestly like it
The sponser segment would have been so much better if it went:   "Hello. . . . . . . .Fresh." Edit: hello fresh sucks nvm
315k like
Serious though, the prod values are pretty high because Netflix can afford it and even good actors are used but everything else is low effort. You can tell they are just trying to create content and don't have an actual passion for the movies they're making. They all feel the same.
laney did you watch this? 🤨
This was the only thing on Netflix while on my trip so I had to rewatch it 3 times
ik this comment has nothing to do with the video but i forgot i had chrome open on youtube on this video when playing DOOM (1993)
Marmaduke looked like Scooby-Doo from that one velma animation.
how is no one talking about how good danny looks in this
I do like the joke where he kicks his face with his foot, instead of a full blown attack, but that's it.
How is the live action CG movie better than this one? Come on, Netflix! You made the Cuphead Show! You can do better than this!
I'm sorry that movie sucked
note this movie cost $50,000,000
my little siblings actually like marmaduke
10:28 World War 1, colourised
9:55 The directors barley disguised fetish
“Father when can I leave to be on my ooooown”
I swear, who is Greg?😂
They are both rich and British and purple  😮...GUYS WHAT IF WILLIAM AFTON IS GUY-
I can't believe how bad the animation was. How did they get Pete Davidson for this?
I'm so sad I have YouTube Premium so I can't see the perfect cut with the ad
The shapes of the people in this movie are genuinely so disturbing and nauseating
Fat people bounce, not walk.
This absolutely ruined the original Markmaduke movie. why are producers doing this 😭
Danny putting the camera under the desk looking up at him I am fighting for my life out here gd
Danny the dad looks like you commissioned a fiverr artist to make you if you were from the Despicable Me franchise
This doesn’t look like a Netflix movie it looks like something h would find in Direct Tv cinema
I saw this movie at school and when I saw the cg I thought we’ll this is gonna hurt you can make more convincing cg with a small budget
im the biggest -bird- dog around
I wish I was lying when I say that my English teacher made us watch/study this god awful movie.
Danny called Velma via this video.
The dog dies and then rock music and the title screen shows up.
I swear this video has come up at least 5 times in my recommended it and I've watched it at least 7 it's that good
Also, the dog that lifted up the convention centre must have done so on his very first attempt. I don't see how he could've had any practice at all. I seriously doubt they had a spare convention centre at his owner's house that they could practice on. They banked their entire attempt at this dog competition on their dog being able to lift up the entire convention centre against the laws of physics without any training at all, on his very first attempt.
i was forced to watch this marmiduk in 4th grade
My little sibling was watching this (she is 6) and I just came in and just saw guy kicking the dog and I was just like………… what is this animation? I thought it was some weird bootleg movie from YouTube or something but I had no idea it was from Netflix.  Then the second time i came in it was the dog farting and the animation was so terrible and i was just so confused by the bad animation, voicing and the plot    ……the worst part she watched it more than ones
911 be like airplane clashes into the twin towers  dang that dog
it's okay, it's not animal abuse to kick a dog if your legs have the same diameter as toothpicks
did anyone else see that one of the cheerleaders was at the dog show
Why did they have to do Marmaduke like that
Netflix is removing the goat movies and replacing the cringest movie
"Marmaduke...was a good dog" no the fuck he was not
I fucking hate this movie
I think the reason why we're getting so many movies canceled near release and why so many films are being made bad now, and no one goes to see them,  is because then the studio can write it off as a loss and pay less taxes
Rage baiting is amazing. They try to make you pay for their service to watch that bad movie. Money my man Everything is about money
The bargain skooby doo
I know this sounds crazy but when he said ultimate power it played Mr cleans Magic eraser
Okay but the 2010 movie was my whole childhood
I love this fuckin Movie it is so batshit insane I cant help but love this. The emotional sence they try to tell is funny because nothing is taken  seriously at all, and everything is just over exaggerated with horrible pacing but if it wasnt this way I think I would hate this movie along with you but I cant its too good.😂😂😂
I disregard any ratings from rotten tomatoes, they're nothing but a bunch of blue haired woke extremists that get offended if there aren't any transgender first graders or forced gay scenes.
Marmadukes stomach is horrible at 9:11
10:10 is definitely the WORST scene in the movie
Marmaduke is a live action movie too 😭😂
I watched this with my family and idk what it was because if I’m being honest I wasn’t paying a single bit of attention to the movie and if I did I would’ve cringe so hard
mike tyson is gonna come for scooby poo
how are they gonna cancel the work of art that is i am not okay with this but spend a fortune on fucking marmadook 💀💀
marmaduke is an actual movie, but they animated it😭
No one is talking about how Marmaduke says hes going to use sound to fight (thunder) 6:01
You should review the live action marmaduke
Little did Danny know he was one of the few people who survived watching Marmaduke.
the animation is so stressful ong
This goofy ahh movie shouldn’t exist
8:23 why this dog look like Thranduil
man... i remember the marmaduke comics from the sunday papers my grandparents used to give us. i hated marmaduke then and i hate him now
Ah, I see the writers' and animators' barely disguised fetish takes up a big scene.
for a long time i thought the photo of yourself in the back of your videos was you drinking a glass of milk.
This reminds me of those YouTube cgi  short movies
I love danny
Lol
Did you know that there is a dam live action Marmaduke.
I think the reason why Guy can understand Marmaduke is that since he was training with dogs for years, he was able to slowly understand dogs
Bro I'm not Greg
Marmaduke ligit caused chernobyl 2.0
They did Marmaduke wrong. I LOVE THE OG! But this one is terrible 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
i rate this video 10/10
Me and my friend watched this before Danny made a video about it we asked him Drew and Kurt boy to make a video when we saw Danny did we freaked out (sadly it was not because of us)
the original live action marmaduke is good
Did u actually break ur wall?!?! 12:21
If I had a nickel everytime I've seen a character named guy I would have two nickels witch isnt alot but it's weird it happened twice
I’m in third grade and at the end of the day we always watch a movie and we watched Marmaduke and I had the same reaction in my head.
There’s a live action original Marmaduke
I would rather watch either Paramount Plus or Disney Plus than Netflix.
they now have the live action marmaduke out
ok but why tf does guy look like william afton
Worst part is this is a remake of a live action movie why did they make this?
*B O U N C I N G     E G G*
I’d rather watch the classic series on Boomerang (Cartoon Network) and the live action adaptation than this garbage
3:27 That man DRINKS
Tbh my kid self would have *DIED* to see a movie like dis
I remember there being a live action marmaduke that I really liked as a kid, they could have just remade that movie shot for shot with new actors and it still would have been more understandable of a decision than this movie  I just looked the movie up, it has a 9% on rotten tomatoes, maybe it wasn’t as good as I remember. But also, it’s a kids movie and I doubt anyone who rated it was under the age of 20 so I feel like you can take the rating with a grain of salt. It also stars Owen Wilson so like, how can you not like it
I need a big sip of unsee juice😂
17:23 😂😂 I can’t stop laughing! I’m trying so hard not to My family is in the room and I’m here laughing with my headphones on 😂
I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
8:13 What the f*ck
Did you just break your wall?
dont worry the dad just has the squishy bones
i’ve watched this so many times and every time i think goddamn pete HAS to see this video. i think he’d find it hilarious
Bro dog trainer not the villain 1 sec later proceeds to beat up a dog
He's dating ice spice now
This gotta be a joke, this the cheapest worst quality movie I've seen
Hello greg
*D I G G I T Y D A N G T H A T D O G*
As someone who saw the original Marmaduke, this movie is atrocious in comparison.
The movie probably would've been half decent if they used the 2D animation from the credits for the whole movie, it actually looked good
marmaduke dying would have been the best way to end this children's movie. change my mind.
OH NO HE RATED IT 6%10 THE WORLD WILL EXPO- 😵
my sister is your girl
There 3 Girls that haw seen the mowie me and My 2 sisters
To be "fair" to Netflix, they didn't make this terrible "Marmaduke" movie. They just host it. They need to start hosting better movies, let alone *making* better movies, but that's besides the point! 😅
3:40 No kangaroo Jack is a different bad film!
Marmadukes finger: *touches a body of 7” deep pool of water* The water: Duplicates by a Million and causes a Tsunami so big that they Found WATER ON MARS!!!
My friend and I when watching this movie were rooting for Marmeduke to die
Hi Greg
My little brother was watching this and this was dreadful to sit down to watch with him.
“MINI-TSUNAMI” LMFOA
I went on to Netflix yesterday and there’s a fucking new marmaduke
my brother watches marmalade and
Apologies for the anime shit, but anyone else seein a weird amount of Hunter x Hunter references here?
He Brooke his wall in anger😂 12:22
what the heck is this movie
Still better than Velma
Why am I the only one that likes Marmaduke am I weird?
I miss the original marmaduke:(
w rizz the rizzly bear
If the quality of these movies made available to the public is bad everyone needs to say, or else as consumers we are still given the same bad product, with the seller/provider thinking we were happy.
"THAT FZCKING DOG!!"
A “mini” tsunami yeah sure 4:21
The part where he eats all the food and farts 100% feels like fetishist content and it makes me VERY uncomfortable
hey my name is Guy
Pls do the starving games
12:31 TOE NAIL CLIPPINGSS????
Why the mom got them thighs though 😏😏👍
Someone probably already said this but Guy is literally just Jean Ralphio. Lol.
I remember my sister was scrolling through the Netflix menu and any time she would she the maraduke she would say "EWWW IT'S MARADUKE" cus we saw the trailer we were disgusted also this was the time maraduke was coming out cause we just like look forward to new shows but MARADUKE. was just no.
8:22 Didn’t I do it for you
Guy isn’t the villain but yeah he did beat up a dog and yeah he charged these people millions of dollars and yea he’s rich
Bro, this is an average movie in Ohio, jeez bro don’t judge there stuff.
I went to my parents house for Christmas and they watched this movie, they said it was funny and cool. It is their favourite movie now.
My god just watching one second of Marmaduke just wants me to watch the WNBA even though it's horrible in general
"father, when can I get to live in the world on my owwewn💅🏻💅🏻"
I used to like Marmaduke but hearing your opinion, It was hilarious-
My favorite part is when the dog proves that he is a Sith Lord and he fights with the dog trainer. Really fire movie
I saw better animation on a fucking Video Brinquedo mockbuster
8:40 they're white women, it's in character.
if a meteor hits earth we already know Marmaduke did it..
No one wants to talk about how Zeus is voiced by J.K fucking Simons?
2:38 I swear you could so much as flick this man's limbs and they would snap like a glowstick
No I'm with guy, kick that dogs ass! And they should give him to the pound cuzhell nah
Does,, does he not know that this is based off a Sunday comic strip
So there cant be silly baby movies anymore? Not everything for children has to have insane plot
I’m sorry.. but my cousins LOVE this movie.
Last year when I was in 2 grade at the end of the year they putting this movie
4:20  lmfao
Netflix is apparently learning movie production and tax loopholes from The Producers
The dog could’ve destroyed a whole country and they would still be sad about his death, I really hoped he would die because he’s a really annoying dog.
4:36 to 4:38 lmao every Scooby-Doo villain ever
They've allot of competition for bad movies ever from Disney.
FaThEr WhEn CaN i LeAvE oN mY oWnN i GoT tHe WhOlE wOrlD tO sEe 😔😔😔💅💅💅💅 best line from Pinocchio 😭😭😭😭
this movie had a 50 million dollar budget and they made this
DOG ABUSE- this movie is just on how to abuse a dog bro..
Bruhh they ruined the dog :(((
I think it's a bit of a funny touch that the price of the dog food was 1.4 mil
I have always wondered that why Netflix makes bad movies 🤷🏻‍♂️ Some independent movies there are far better than most of the latter
That Pinocchio voice sounds so annoying
Random cat: “Believe in yourself.” Marmaduke: “Believe I’m a champion? *Yep* ”
Bro where's marmadukes Oscar best acting best animation best uh stuff and other things and um dog
9:11 I think the director had a inflamation  fetish
This is something you’d find in the reject shop for 40 cents
I don't think I have ever seen a zero before on rotten tomatoes
Why do you CUSS
Netflix content is just terrible. I cancelled my subscription and have zero regrets. When there are so many other options such as Disney+ with Marvel and so many good choices for my kids.
Continue watching at 16:05
Harder Marmadaddy
If this was realistic, the dog would be declared a Super Omega Biohazard and dissolved in a vat of hydrochloric acid. At least that's what we all want
Me watching this “ what the -“
I watched marmaduke in school once and I literally wanted to die the entire time
Bro that del toro Pinocchio movie was dope tho
Once, I was at a mental recovery place thingie and THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOVIES WE WATCHED. 💀💀💀 I do not miss that place one bit
pete probably saw snoops cartoon with the dog and thought if he done this movie it would be just as popular
This movie is like if a counterfeit Pixar made a movie using the style of bowling alley animations
Don’t trust a movie with Skete
Marmaduke is on drugs.
Lol the window just vaporized after Marmaduke flies thru it
They cancelled Inside Job and this was okay to green-light?!
This movie came out on my birthday. This is the worst birthday present I’ve ever received
One thing I think should be noted is that Zeus is voiced by J.K Simmons
Nah I watch it trash
Guys Zeus is played by J.Joanah Jameson J.K Simmons
To haliorues
It’s good
Uhm I feel so bad for telling you this , but Netflix is making a live action version of Marmaduke . I'm so sorry for letting you know this.
I want this turned into a real life live action movie without the animal abuse, of course. Drew would play "Guy".
Actually, I have watched it:|
I broke down cry laughing at least three times while watching this
If u watch the movie u would know this British mf say bow wow idk y I think it's goofy ahh
This doesn’t really contribute anything to the video at all but this video has become my comfort video, whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed or like I have to do something again or I’ll get this itchy uncomfortable feeling, I go to this video because I know ever word to it since I’ve watched it like a million times.  edit: ok so it turns out i have ocd
Marmaduke was an abyssmally bad comics strip that was a rip-off of an abyssmally bad comic strip from the 40s. The comic strip was essentially plotless, but at least did not centre around farts.
Marmaduke
ThArThr WhEN cAn I BE On My OwN ✨
OMG I LAUGHED SO HARD ON “bouncing egg” THAT I LITERALLY SOME COKE WENT UP TO MY NOSE AND IT HURTS
Netflix are trying so hard to stay relevant 😂
Marmaduke.
“Nose to Arm Ratio”
This movie is a disgrace to dogs
4:52 is he played by Ryan Reynolds
DANNY YOU SHOULD WATCH THE AMAZING GREAT MAURICE! IT IS BY FAR THE WEIRDEST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN AND IT WOULD BE HILARIOUS IF YOU DID A VIDEO ON IT!!
Apparently there is another movie under the same name but it was released in 2010
11.33 she used the wrong words. She should have said la stinka
This video should be the movie.
Once I saw my little brother watching this😭
0:09 FaWtHEr wHEn CaN I LeAvE tO bE On mY oWn 💅 💅 💅
GUYS I KNOW WHAT THE SEQUAL IS CALLED ITS CALLED “thic boi gets diabetes” SEE I TOLD YA TRUST ME
ZAPPED WAS GOOD NOT TO MUCH NOW
Nice highlights hair
ah yes netflix has the courage to add garbage like this, and remove a masterpiece like bleach
If you showed this movie to the people in the the french revolution, they'd take you to the guillotine
i love animated movies man, but markaduke was weird as hell😭  hated it. it literally made 0 sense and was confusing
If you want a good movie please watch RRR My life changed after watching it
and wasn't there a Marmaduke real life comedy movie that was not even shit? Why remake it into a shitty low budget animation?😂 they're trolling at this point
19:50 hahaha why did you do this angle I feel violated
How many Gregs do you think are actually named Greg?
The Fart Nuclear Blast is like the second Chernobyl.
anybody read the comics because they were better
This is the equivalent of "we have ___ at home!"
I watched marmaduke but not the cartoon dog the real dog
I fell asleep watching this video. Not because it was bad. But because it was 3 am
I was told by my friend that we would be watching this movie in class on Friday.  Instead, we watched an awful Ratatouille upload on YouTube that was sped up and kept switching between scenes.  Seems like a better experience
Imagine this is why Walt becomes Heisenberg
Thank you for putting the sponsor at the end instead of saying "Let's torture our viewers by putting this random sponsor in the middle of this video that they cannot skip or they miss halve the video!"
What do I think of the first characters I see? Disgusting.
It looks like a show on pbs kids on god
is it just me or was there another Marmaduke movie that came out a long time ago. it was live action, but still good.
I HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS WHOLE MOVIE IN 4TH GRADE HELPPP
8:58 dog gets impregnated by food already in the third trimester within seconds and gives birth to gas babies out of his butt
Marmaduke is one of my favourite movies, this is a horrible remake
3:23 Why do they have to make the wife dummy thicc?
The whole Guy and Maraduke speaking thing, I just assumed Maraduke was still barking and Guy just knew what he was saying. It would make sense considering he’s a world famous dog trainer. Probably is a dog whisperer too idk
Danny ks literally on no one's side and I'm all here for it. Lmao
SNOWFLAKE MOUNTAIN?
Zukes is the equivalent of, "leetmeedoitfoooryou." Borzoi dog.
I would watch this 3 time
Don’t you ever compare zapped to marmaduje
He just beat the shit out of the dad Danny 2022
Piccolo: "Dodge!"
There is another Marmaduke movie on Hulu
This movie is so bad that people actually throw rotten tomatoes at the screen
Marmaduke looks to be the first feature film generated entirely by AI?   (the future is cringe)
My theory is that Pete Davidson was blackmailed into voice acting for this movie
It's made worse by the fact that this is a low budget animated remake of a live action movie adaptation of a super popular comic strip. Like I know this wasn't made for the same generation as the comics, but there's still a pre-existing kind of vibe going on there.  The best remakes are the ones made with love for the original media. There was absolutely no love in this version. Like I bet the board room meeting was "we want to make an Illumination style Funny Movie and tack it onto something else to get attention. Any ideas? Marmaduke? Perfect!" lol
My little brother watched it and liked it…💀
I watched this movie with my mom because we ran out of stuff to watch on Netflix, despite knowing all the new movies were crap             We don't watch Netflix anymore
I remember Watching this in class and everyone was so confused  but it was better then doing work.
There is a continuity problem. Danny punches the wall and makes a hole but then it disappears
This looks like something your 2nd grade teacher would put on the tv for the kids who spent money for the pizza party
My conspiracy theory on why movies like this are being made:  There have been many Netflix shows in the past and some current ones that are pretty good and entertaining, however as time passes, those shows start to lose their luster. I think movies like this are being made so that when people watch them and end up hating them they'll look back on the older movies that lost their spark and say "You know what, that one wasn't as bad as whatever the heck this was." Thus Netflix keeps those older but better shows decently popular because bittersweet nostalgia is better than being stuck in your house, bored out of your mind and trying to entertain yourself to no avail with freaking Marmaduke The Living Mustard Gas Bomb.
You forgot the biggest sin this movie made. Tainting the legacy of the otherwise alright 2011 live action Marmaduke movie
Even if an animal character is like monstrously evil I'd still feel sad if it died cuz it's an animal. But this isn't even an animal, and I would just feel so so satisfied if he got hit by a train
I must say, Danny... My three year old niece LOVED the pooping in the trophy scene. She rated the movie two thumbs up 😭😂  Edit: this movie unironically became my niece's favorite movie. Every time I visit, that's what's playing on the television. Thank you, Daniel.
I saw my little brother watching this and thought I was disassociating because it didn’t feel real
I mean, it's probably nowhere close to the dumbest thing in the movie, but Zeus is the closest thing to the main antagonist of the movie, and he is thwarted not by anything the protagonist does, but because his trainer felt a need to cheat at a competition he was likely to legitimately win anyway.  And also, so what if Zeus loses or is disqualified?  There is no way Marmaduke was anywhere close the the 2nd best dog in the competition.  Also, the family still owes the money; the problem Marmaduke was trying to resolve was not resolved by the time credits roll.  I don't know if the people who made this movie forgot, assumed we would forget, or assumed nobody was going to watch the movie long enough to know or care.  Um, I'm going with the last one.
The og movie isn't too bad but this is something else
Look at his nose to arm ratio 3:27
6.9M views. Nice
Don’t mix this movie up with Owen Wilson’s Marmaduke. Which is a cinematic masterpiece
pyrocynical's most favorite movie
The real losers are the ones that watch this crap
Unrelated, why tf is there a picture with a dude using an inhaler on tour wall
I never seen someone wanting a dog to die
i hope u know that ur the reason my brother forced us to watch maramduke recently and made us suffer thru the 1 hr and 27 min of this movie. ur the sole cause
Graduate
I'm not subscribed and it has nothing to do with anything that you're talking about I just wanted to say that elden ring ruined games for me... not because it's bad but because it's that good.
💀💀💀im dead bro my teacher put this on at the end of the year
bru i actually thought he broke his wall lmao
i like the old marmaduke movies
0:09 "Father when can i leave to be on my O0o0O0own"
That 8:52 Dog looks like the can I do it for you meme
The animation looks like it was rendered 29 years ago 💀
netflix only put good movie4s when it gets old
The dog trainer ceaser Milan???
16:00 now we know where the let me do it for you borzoi meme started
Why is this looking like a 2014 cartoon from the France 4 Channel. Oh yeah it's a french Channel
The dad is cheating on the mom with scarlet overkill
theres a live action one to and its even worse
18:33 My wifi buffered just as he finished saying “talk to me” and I had to stare at this genuinely horrifying man with eyes perfectly spherical and emotionless for a solid 60 seconds before I could be free from his soul damning stare.
Danny my little old class made me watch is at Christmas break or Of the last day of school
Rich and British *cough* *cough* Wallace and Gromit *cough* *cough*
3:27 my boys nose is worse than Michael Jackson nose surgery
They showed me this movie in school for like a “fun activity”
My little brothers have in fact watched this movie, MULTIPLE TIMES, and it gets worse every time I have to be in the same room as it. It's just so baddddd.
It was entertaining to some point but not completely the best movie, probably because I had nothing else to watch after watching every single show on Netflix 😂
Shortly after a minute in, it sounds like this family needed a smaller dog or a guinea pig. I can’t tell how old the children are, but the boy is small enough to ride the dog, the sister isn’t much older, and the dad is basically disabled with his spaghetti arms. That sounds like me as a toddler, my brother almost 10, and my disabled mom getting pushed over by a large dog my dad couldn’t be with most of the time (nor did he want to; he’d rather relax). Max ended up with an older couple who adored him and were able to safely care for him. We ended up with a Maltese. A dog that can break through windows and cause a tsunami doesn’t seem to fit this family. It’s not just love that makes an animal and you right for each other. You have to be able to handle and communicate with each other. This garbage movie doesn’t even teach that. And guess what, riding a dog at any age isn’t good for them at any size. I learned that well after Max was gone, and I had done the wrong thing many times. They aren’t built like horses, so get that Arian child off of Marmaduke.
Try fab freeze small spaces
I forgot how bad this art style is 💀💀💀💀
If you're going to swim to the bottom of the ocean, then you have to survive the immense water pressure. It'd probably feel like standing on Jupiter if Jupiter had solid ground. So I'd say that's more impressive than a dog lifting a building.
Where is peta when you need them?
21:13 no >:(
Mhm.... the fart inflation thing feels like a fantasy of the writers.
when will celebrities stop trying to market towards kids this is so ridiculous 💀
Danny, do you think hypnosis is magic and not a real thing?
WTF?
Before I watched this movie my friend said “it’s not a movie ITS A LIFESTYLE.”
One of my teachers has a point system and you can save up enough points to have the class watch a movie. I forced everyone in the class to watch this terrible movie.
Owen Wilson didn't deserve this utter disrespect
Essentially what Danny is talking about here is something that has been going on since at least like the 70's, where a studio while intentionally make a movie that will bomb to make it look like the studio made less money. Essentially when the I.R.S comes knockin' on their door they can say look we didn't make as much money because we lost several million on this movie and then they have to pay less taxes. It's essentially fraud.
I feel like im having a real conversation with someone
It really shows my age that I knew Marmaduke came from a newspaper comic
3:47 ‘’wet spagetti’’
Fun fact: this movie is actually a recreation of (2010) marmaduke (it’s on Hulu btw)
0:09 idk why this voice-over is so insanely funny to me, but it is
wait so can they understand the dog like he can speak
I could not stop laughing at this and it was like 4 am but thank you for making this
Did you actually punch the wall
I did not like the eyebrows of this white dog
My little cousin actually watched this on tv and I was sooo confused by this show
you should watch the old marmaduke movie from 2010! i remember watching it as a kid
The best part about this movie is that if you look on the reviews, most, if not all, the 5-star reviews are purely satire.
I know my humors messed up but the part at 4:18 killed me
"Marmaduke was a good dog…" had me rolling. it was just so unexpected and this movie has been insane enough
Still better than slippin" jimmy
this video hurts me on a personal level cause i've got a great dane
< 18:40 >   No he wasnt
This could be used as a torture device than for entertainment
bouncing egg
10:11  I would poop out my skeleton by then
I watched this in my classroom 💀
*D A N G T H A T D O G*
Bros gonna have a field day with Velma
10:30 Western Front, 1915, colorised
the fact this movie is more exclusive than genshin
My mom thinks this movie is cute 🥲
The original marmaduke was way too good
i cant believe netflix cancelled julie and the phantoms so they could make this bullshit fucking shitty ass movie
The original Marmaduke was golden though
I just have to thank you so much for making this video because a couple months ago I was babysitting my 9 year old niece and she wanted to watch this movie so we put it on and I immediately fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the dog show eating scene and  thought I was losing my fucking mind and then it just kept GOING. I am still horrified this movie exists but I am comforted that I wasn’t the only one subjected to it
6:31 bEaT tHe ShIt OuT oF yOuR dOg
I give this a -100/10
you kinda make this movie interesting
I wish I could get skinny after a big toot
The live action marmaduke was so good, this is bs
I was lucid dreaming about cleaning out potentially haunted things in my family’s house, and I trapped myself into sleep paralysis of Demon Danny’s looking at me through ceiling vents while listening to this. One had glowing red eyes, and I was so scared, and I squeaked when I fully woke up. The second Danny was benign, and I never saw the potentially “good Danny” I heard about
does the blond dog sound like cave johnson to anyone else or is it just me (If you don’t know about portal he’s the guy from the “I’ve been thinking when life gives you lemons don’t make lemonade make life take the lemons back” audio)
My dads name is Guy
The waffle house has found it’s new host
dude this movie feels like a fart fetish movie it's so gross
Marmaduke was accually a movie before this, and during the time i watched this i thought: Look how they massacred my boy
as your friend, yes that’s weird
Is the first movie in the entire history of movies but  it's a little bit good I guess
2:40 bouncing egg I can’t 😭😭
I knew marmaduke sounded familiar. It's that live action dog film from 2010.
8:12 go frame by frame for this one tiny animation, what the fuck
i'm sorry but "hot diggity dang that dog" is unironically hysterical
honestly, the magic in marmaduke might be why Guy can talk to the dog man's a druid
I don't know if you know this, but I found out I think this movie might be based on a live action movie of the same name, it's on hulu and it came out in 2010
Oh the writers were definitely high making this
This movie looks horrible.
I think there’s actually more consistent money in “bad movies”. Like imagine  you spend $300,000 to make each movie and you consistently make $2 million on each one. Do that 50x a year and your annual return on investment is astronomical. Compare that to spending $300 million dollars on a single “good movie” which might not even break even
danny seems to appreciate rapping dogs..? It cant be a coincidence that hes covered 2 different movies with rapping dogs. titanic: the legend goes on, and this
The og Marmaduke was souch better
How on earth did they go with “Scooby Poo” instead of “Scooby Doo Doo”
Why would they make such bad movies they have completely losted Thier minds and Disney is trying to bring back 2D at this point in time
What have they done to Marmaduke 🧍🏼‍♀️
Okay Ik that I'm not the only person who saw the Marmaduke 2010 movie??
did you realize when marmeduke and guy are about to fight marmeduke says *I'll have to unleash thunder and lightning* those 2 things are the same thing.
I hate the animation for this movie
My cousin has a kid that is obsessed with this movie. Praying for her 🙏
This movie is right next to that fucking bee movie copy
10:27  Am I the only one who can hear  superhero music in the background?
even after all this time i still genuinely cannot believe this is an actual official movie
Yoooooo Kakashi 2:13
Bro recreated the Chernobyl exclusion zone💀
The cheerleaders know about Marmaduke shitting himself at the dog show because they were literally there. You can see them in the background. This is what they all do for fun
I watched the first lil bit and then decided I never wanted to touch the movie again.
fuck,yea!
did you ever see the original maarmadukes movie?
i can't with that "father, when can i leave on my owwnn." 🤣
My teacher played this in class. I hated it
Watch out! Its L stinko!!💀💀💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol love this!
this marks the second movie in which jk simmons plays a villain who sabotages the protagonist’s chance at winning a competition. of course, one of those movies is a beautiful, nearly flawless masterpiece, and the other is whiplash
Guy really was the villain. Beat up marmaduke, didn’t train him, charged the family unnecessarily, then just dipped.
There’s a live action version of this movie and, even though I’m sure it’s really not, it was amazing to me as a kid. You should definitely do a movie review of it too. I know the dog had those animated lips to make him talk like a person and that was disturbing asf
The dog I think is not speaking English but can understand English and I think the dog trainer can just understand dog language
NO MORE bad words
This is the kind of movie my 7 year old cousin loves and I never even heard of on an ad or anything and just pretend that I'm okay with watching it
about the pinnochio movie the new one is so much better
Netflix did Marmaduke dirty-
This review was abolutely hillarious, thanks for making this better.
im upset bc i love pete and then he gets roles like this 💀 why do i feel like he was too embarrassed to promote the movie
i think i went to watch this video a couple months ago but i got distracted after a couple minutes bc i wanted to go watch the full Pinocchio clips
The dad is almost the worst looking dad ive seen in any  movie
have u ever wondered what films danny must have in his house and online? i just imagine going into a room he calls his like film library or something and just seeing rows upon rows of the worlds crappiest films. also what are his netflix film recommendations like?
WHY WAS THIS SO FUNNY LOL
🤯
That is the only cartoon death scene I did not shed a tear for
The villain dog is straight up Saruman
me and my cousin watched this when it came out he’s only 4 so he didn’t understand but he loves it and watches it all the time he calls it “stinky dog show@
Live action marmaduke>>>
a child has watched this movie, my little brother
Every character in this movie looks like a stick figure that just ate steak
This movie was originally a comic book
I like this movie :C
Hes family got mad at him *just for being himself*  Himself:
There’s an actually great movie marmiduke that is a real movie and this new marmiduke is terrible
: l
This movie definitely had some fetish-y inspiration
DANNY REACT TO LOVE DEATH AND ROBOTS
The dog park show fart nuke is the equivalent of the Hiroshima bomb dropped towards Japan in 1945
That dog show park is more toxic then Chernobyl in 1986
Dudes legs are like the thinkness of a tooth
i thinkthis is my fav danny gonzalez video now
Missed out on the "you've discovered a new breed of dog, the Great Disdane"
Tbh marmaduke was a kinda decent movie, it was a decent comedy for families and not worse than a lot of movies.
10:29 looks like the storm from call of duty warfare
14:29 bro how can you run to china like it is on a whole different continent with thousands of miles of water between, like he would be dead by now 💀💀💀
9:22 he’s so “toxic” that he vaporized all the food he just ate at the dog competition, and by toxic I mean his fats in side of him
Do people still even use the word roast?
this movie is so stupid that this is honestly funny
Ok not bad
9:59 HOLD UP WHAT THE FUCK
I reget watching this movie
Bruh, I have the actual DVD original Marmaduke movie and it is WAY BETTER than the stupid Netflix remake. 😶
Marmaduke is the only movie i have ever seen that had 0% on rotten tomatos, im impressed
5:25 “✨tHe bAD gUy HaS to Be RiCh aNd briTish✨”
Ever since Obama took over its gone down hill. The worst movie on Netflix is the new Lindsey Lohan Christmas. The actors are so bad that commercials are actually being requested.
Bro we watched this goofy ahh movie and kids in my class where fucking crying`💀
bro that dog farts so bad that he makes places worse than chernobyl 💀
1million foloase Worth of Dog food?!?
marmaduke original movie.
Dude I laughed so freaking hard the entire video keep doing what your doing 😂
My sister and nieces laughed at this.
7:57 to be honest i Just feel like this dude tortured a dog until the dog teached him how to understand dogs
ive seen the comics
The original marmaduke was better
The only marmaduke movie I've watched is the live action adaptation  The animation in this new marmaduke movie is atrocious
Fuck it I'm counting the swears 1 fuck "maramuke was some fucking dog" 1 shit " he beats the shit out the dad" 1 shit "where he beat the shit out of the dad for his chair" 1 fuck "THAT FUCKING DOG" I'm stopping for now:)
Listening, but Danny is so cute
The dog looks like peete himself lol💀💀💀
i want to meet pete davidson and tell him that my favorite work of his is marmaduke
Is Netflix Just Breaking Bad Movies On Purpose
I think the kids in this are adopted, both of their parents are brunettes. Or either that, the wife cheated on the guy because his nose was inhumane, large and red and cheated on him with the mailman or the milkman- yeah, the mail or milkman is blonde. ITS EITHER THAT OR the blonde comes from family stuff, but I doubt it. Anyway, the mom is this is Elastagirl’s cousin and uh- she’s cheating on her husband.
Belive it or not, Marmaduke is a famous comic strip and it was another movie from 2010 this one has a 2 and 1/2 out of 10 but Netflixs has a 2 out of ten
This is still better than Love on a Leash
Strange... Considering how crappy this movie is it's all my sister wants to watch.        I have watched it 11 times now...         Save me.. 😭
i was actually actually so close to buying tickets to this movie but u saw the trailer and oh god
Marmaduke was such a good movie (not the cartoon one)
How did he spend one and a half million dollars on food
He is right , Netflix productions is the worst ever  Honestly 1 of 100  films success
Wtf is going on in this movie
Tomorrow is my last day with my dog so I’m sad
im10yo and i watched marmaduke when i was 9
The fact I watched it 💀
half way through this movie I almost threw up so i stopped
3:39  why I laugh 💀
If Greg is one GUY then what about female viewers?
Hollywood is just shitty
i think how the parents and others cant hear them but the trainer can is like stewie and chris from family guy
I thought man's actually cracked the damn wall my eyes got so big 👁👄👁
19:23
minus several points for not saying they put their Marmadukes up at 6:12
3:19 "HE HAS GONE TOO FAR HONEY" -some random dad
Bro it said 1# RATED KIDS MOVIE  on nextflix
I've been telling people this for years now how it seems like "hollywood" is making bad movies on purpose. I don't know why they'd do it or to what purpose but it's mind boggling how bad it can be.
Okay
Netflix makes terrible movies
10:10 smallest fart in Ohio 💀
Why did “Bouncing egg” make me laugh so hard 💀
Do you have a picture of yourself on the wall?
ok what were the writers smoking, and where can i get some?
to add on the parents look like siblings
marmaduke is the very first bad boy...  i know im sorry i had to
I like the new Marmaduke movie personally but, come on. We all gotta agree that the new Pinocchio movie sucks lol. The animation is weird, and the storyline, BAD.
The most unrealistic thing Danny didn't mention in his video was the family of four, two kids and their parents, living in a two-story house in a suburban neighborhood with a giant dog that probably eats more than all of them put together in a month. I guess what I'm saying is that million dollars wasn't going to pay for training the dog, it was going to get them out of bankruptcy
Guy may be rich and British, but his eyes aren't red, so he's not evil.
Im not kidding i watched this at school and it became a meme in my friend group where we would just randomly say “marmaduke!” In a high piched voice when we were talking
Danny do the live action version from like the early 2010s/late 2000s
Wait until he finds out about the original Marmaduke movie 💀
And we really thought emoji movie was bad
19:46 I didn't, I was playing Factorio and now I'm late for work yesterday
If you want to watch a bad movie you should watch Disaster Movie
It's sad how Marmaduke went from a sweet family nostalgic movie to him being a kick a*s kangaroo giga Chad
I saw some kids watching this 💀
Are we just in this era where Pete Davidson has to be in everything? Smart Water ads, Taco Bell Breakfast ads, Kim Kardashian, Angry Birds, The Suicide Squad, and now Marmaduke? We needed to bring back Marmaduke?
I kinda think its thier way of washing money 🤷
fard
can u review donnie darko next??
Try Dog Gone Trouble
Scooby Doo from Ohio be like :
Oh you were born on earth? I was born on Venus! Nice to meet you.
i actually remember watching a live action movie named Marmaduke with Owen Wilson when I was a kid and I of course liked it but at the same time young me was just thinking "this is a Marley and Me copycat that's not as good". LMAO anyways who the hell thought to make a cartoon out of that movie.
2:27 I genuinely thought he was gonna say "I was born in west Philadelphia, I spent my days on the playground until a kid came to fight and my mom sent me with my aunt and uncle in bel-air"
Danny, I found a movie that you might enjoy roasting. The School For Good And Evil. Sure the people look good but it's all scrambled and I genuinely want to see you rate it💀
YOU ACTUALLY PUNCHED A HOLE IN YOUR WALL
Marmaduke is not a bad movie I watched it and it was hilarious 😂 this movie deserves to be loved more it only has 2 stars😅
why are the people built like that 💀
No idea if it's just me but I remember Marmaduke being a live action movie Wtf is this hell movie?
Tbf where i live, most dog trainers train dogs by beating them up. It's horrible but no one seems to think it's wrong.
The dad knowing Marmaduke did it just has the same energy as "that damn squirrel"
bet this movie was made by a studio that netflix was able to pay jack squat to be able to have the movie. Also the end credit roll had better animation quality and production value than the entire movie
you are so freakin' funny!
The live action Marmaduke was pretty good, but this is just terrible
the stick legs on these characters and the cg physics trigger my fight or flight response
the visuals on this animation makes it feel like a big meme 😭
The Rundown reference actually got me
"Uh oh" - Marmaduke.
If you want a good version of this movie, there's a movie I think that's from the 90's that's also called Marmaduke, it's about the same type of dog with the same name but not the same plot, it's actually a good movie.
Thousand years of evolution for this
That Marmaduke film has the ugliest animation I've ever seen. 🤮
Their legs are so insectoid
u say talent funny
you made this thing entertaining lol
Lol marmaduk is in Israel movies soon😹
Zeus = Thranduil in dog form
Looking at Danny's nose-arm ratio ¬¬
Is this why Kim and Pete broke up
I HAVE A BAD MOVIE FOR YOU: A CHRITMAS KAREN
woah
1990 - 2022 that means hes 32 years old
WHY IS THIS SO REWATCHABLE I WATCHED THIS LIKE 23 TIMES
Netflix and most of Hollywood really does just have a wierd fetish for taking existing ips and making complete garbage out of them
Ok but rather than. Calling him a not so great dane, it would've hit mtch harder if the trainer said " you seem to have found a new. Breed of dog, the Worthless Dane
20:20
wow… every single dog’s mouth movements in this movie are so painful to watch that this surely was intentional
2:26 “for example, i was born in the 1990s **on earth** “ please lmao it’s nearly 3 am i can’t be laughing this loud 😭
NETFLIX WHY JUST GIVE US MOVIES THAT ARNT SUPER OLD AND JUST TERRIBLE
13:54  my son watched this movie and he hated it
Netflix always has too make movies so stupid you HAVE to watch it.
im mr poo just like you and i hate you becusae im a poo heheheehe
Klaus:🤣
the marmaduke movie its so bad it looks bootleg
Idk… the mom looks like a lot of influencers. 😒
I think Aaron Doh’s dog used to shit on the wall
The guy has red eyes!
How did they make an animated movie look like it was greenscreened?!
Honestly the "He is Drew Gooden's biggest fan" joke about Guy isn't getting enough attention, that was fucking hilarious 4:54
I have been watching disturbing, gorey movies for years, and genuinely, this is the only movie that made me gag.
ok, well, there's two redeeming qualities in this abomination: 1) J.K Simmons Foog 2) The Milf
"and he farts and he craps and he farts so hard i thought he might die" my man almost died 10 times in the entire movie and half of those reasons are because of food
graphics remind me of toy story one made in 1995 and this is made in 2022  say no more
I watched this Movie I hate it
There’s an original marmaduke movie it’s live action and bad it’s on Hulu
Why does Pinocchio sound like a gay stereotype
i was just listening to the video in the background, came back at 10 and thought marmaduke was scooby doo hell nah
I didn’t think those were people I thought those were sting beans 🤣🤣😆
Does anyone else remember the HD marmaduke movies?
11:33 Since the person being insulted seems to be a woman, it should be "la stinko", but i guess bullies aren't meant to be bilingual.
Unrelated but appreciated : love the aesthetic of this video!! There’s something about the poster in the back and the Greg couch.. this is the “stride” aesthetic for this channel.. love it 👏🏽
Better than I thought it does not deserve zero I give her one
wasn't this a remake of the 2010 Marmaduke
Danny please make a video about the movie "16 wishes"
I remember watching marmaduke the first one and watching netflix's version of marmaduke made me mad because that movie gave me tons of god memories.
Why does it look like a really shitty Nickelodeon tvshow from the 90s?
This movie's CGI unearths repressed memories of Monster By Mistake. Even knowing it was finished in 2018 it still looks dreadful.
danny: "guy isn't the villain of the movie; he's not even really that bad" guy: beats up pets for a living
most normal dog in Ohio 💀💀💯💯
I legit watched this movie like a day after this came out like I didn't even know this existed and I said "this is the type of movie Danny Gonzalez would make a video out of"
I liked it for some reason  it was funny
dead dog.
You has very good content me and my sister love your content
“Pixar Mom Syndrome”
i feel bad for marmaduke
this movie was in movie theaters in Latvia💀
How fucking dare you Marmaduke is a theatrical master piece. Pete Davidson’s performance of a dog who lived through love, war, imprisonment and heart break is beautiful.
i am perturbed
Bro this movie just makes the og maramaduke look bad, like who remembers that film, the one that had Owen Wilson in it
13:01 nah “telephone””exercise””supervision””manicure”, how would the dog do any of this💀
My cousins made me watch this…
I remember when my teacher put the movie on for the whole class- We never finished watching it
Bro I wanna ask Pete Davidson what his thoughts about doing the voice acting is cause why
“Is your dog pooping in the wrong spot ever that funny….” Wellllllll. My friend just watched my dog while I was out of town recently, and my 12 pound dog pooped on their dining room table.. I couldn’t be mad, only impressed.
Shut up marmaduke is the opposite it is. The best movie 🎥 in 2 years😡🤬🤬🤬👿👎🏿
Wait, that’s how it ends lol
My little cousins forced me to watch this now I have a headache and need bleach
this is the best netflix movie of all time
I like to have more reasons to make fun of Pete Davidson
I tried to watch marmaduke. I stopped before I even made it halfway.
This is the Greatest  BOY WHUT DA HEEEEE- moment of All Time
This film is HILARIOUS! The graphics look like I made it in 5 minutes in Blender and the plot is just trash like wtf. Also none of the things in the film make any sense. How does that dog survive running through HOLE FUCKING ASIA AND EUROPE WITHOUT ANY FOOD. That is like 20.000 meters. I was glad not knowing that film and I won't be seeing forward to watching it
😭its like they tried so hard to remake the actual good marmaduke movie but failed so bad like…. EXCEEDINGLY BAD..
I swear if I go on Netflix to see that they replaced octonauts with a crusty movie like this I would hate everything
lol
6:28 eh. You’d be surprised. Actual trainers basically put a choke chain pinch collar on every single dog to train them not to pull on the leash. Then they start the positive reinforcement.
I actually watched this movie yesterday, my taste is terrible... yes the animation can get very bad at times but the story is for some reason pretty good (even if it is based off of an older of the same name) the fart scene is horrendous though, almost on The little Panda Fighter level.
20:01 - Moral of the story:  If there's a problem and Marmaduke is involved, blame Marmaduke.
Jesus loves you John 3:16 Romans 8:35-39
I watched this movie, and I thought it was okay. The reflections are the best feature
actually 3 kids have watched this
okay im new here and wtf. I knew danny and drew gooden were like similar, but this sounds and feels exactly like im watching a drew video. Its surreal in some way. How did both of these guys and up almost identical.
There was a live action Marmaduke movie in 2010 that was actually good, or at least better than this animated one, I recommend you watch it
I have watched this movie with my brothers last year (I am 20 and they are 11 and 8), this movie made us laugh until the end. We were absolutelly shocked by how HORRENDOUS everything about this movie (animation, character design and story). We lost our minds when the Chinese dog started doing some hip hop out of nowhere.  Our humor is kinda broken. negative10/10 movie for sure.
This is why i dont watch tv (gigachad)
Eh well all quiet on the western front was pretty good
This feels like something even I could have made
My old friend actually enjoyed this movie…
The one with Owen Wilson in 2009 was better.
consistently faster speeds: 72 ping
why are they toothpicks
Here in switzerland they put this movie on top of the kids list 🤣 watched it with my goddaughter 😂
Tbh, it would be a good movie if it had a remake
is this the villain from "Happy!"?
ugli characters
did you know that the company behind ExpressVPN is an ad provider?
i swear, they're making these movies so they can take them out later as a "loss" so they dont pay as much on taxes.
Having read the comics in the Sunday paper when I was younger, I don't understand why they would even make a Marmaduke movie, even moreso after the 2010 one...
This movie is recent?! The CGI is so bad and the animation is so awkward, it looks like it’s from 2005 LMAOOO
Why does the fancy dog have the body structure of old man consequences from fnaf
the animation I don't agree on but the art is pretty good.
I can’t believe marmaduke went from being the main antagonist of dogscape to this
they say if you look into his eyes, you see the devil
That is a very unpleasant art style.
Bad Movies On Purpose
This looks like an illumination movie.
The voice 😆 0:09
Bruh this whole movie looks like a squished picture in ms word 💀
the animation looks like it's from 1980 wtf
oh god the animation is horrible its like we regressed to the 2000's
the way danny fucking describes these scenes is killing me
Short answer: obvious fucking ly 🤣
10:27 live chernobyl accident video.
❤️
U look like Flint Lockwood in the thumbnail
Went woke
Guys I think your forgetting something here. That bulldog that lifted up the building DID IT WELL HE WAS IN THE BUILDING. THE DOG CAN LIFT THINGS HE IS STANDING ON
bruh how come my little sister who is literally four absolutely loved this movie she watched it religiously for like two months
The dad knows marmadouke did 9/11
Ain't no way the most replayed is on the pixar mom syndrome bit
Method acting
Honestly, I thought it was good, sue me.
marmaduke's walking animation looking more akin to that of some spider creature than an actual dog is the most unintentionally funny thing to me i think
In Poland in the summertime, this movie was in theaters and had commercials on TV
I hated Marmaduke. No joke, it was horrible
Why didn't they try to mimic the art style of the comics???  They showed that they were able to during the credits! It would have improved the movie so much if it was in the art style of the comics!
Marmaduke in the comics: unintentionally troublesome but very loving  Marmaduke in this movie: selfish a-hole that has proven that I can, in fact, have negative feelings about a dog
they probably fed bestselling movies to an ai, instead of good ones like they should have. clickbait movies don't profit on subscription services.
Gotta prize this thing for something   It took sad moments seriously, unlike a superhero multibillon dollar company hthta makes millons with the most mediocre product ever
This movie is just so visually unpleasing to look at I had this window behind another tab to listen to Danny like it was a podcast
miss when children movies then were all about creepy/morbidly dark themes, a single courage the cowardly dog episode would immediately go off-air nowadays. what IS THIS..
oh no it "just" came out and it already aged soooooo badly
Netflix is literally just buying anything so that they can make money,even if it sucks
Pixar mom did not save this
The og marmaduke was great but this hits different (badly)
Og Marmaduke was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
While I am sure that you are correct and this is a turd of a movie it definitely seemed like this video was made without knowing that Marmaduke was first a comic strip in 1954, then had some animated stuff in 1980, and then a live action movie in 2010. The live action only rated 3/10 on Rotten xD
My answer: Yes they are making bad movies on purpose
10:18 is like, 80% of what deviantart has become (deviantfart…)
Me who’s already seen Marmaduke: leaves
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh............I'm leaving.
wait hold on, wasnt there still a cameraman on that camera stand? what happened to him?
The characters design in this movie I can’t find very positive even in the main character because they have big heads and big legs and skinny legs I’m sorry but this is true. :(
The bounty commercial that played before this movie with the little liquid dude had better animation than this movie
Well let’s just say there is a movie from Netflix that is made from Guilhermo Del Toro and that is Pinocchio and I don’t think it’s going to be terrible right? It cannot go wrong right? :D
Danny with hair looks weird now. Brain no likey.
10:11 Iwhen he said the dog was farting and turning into a rasien😂😂😂
have you seen riverdance, nah bro i was watching this with my parents and we died WTH WAS THIS SH- SPOILER ALERT::: THERE WERE MOOSE hold up meese? well there were alot of mooses riverdancing.
Danny ngl you look like half the main characters in these cursed Disney films
NAWWWWWWWWWWW, THEY RUINED MARMADUKE, GO WATCH THE OLD ONE PLEASE
The Dad looks like you dude!! They took the exact proportions of YOUR FACE!!! Wake UP!!
what is the point of this
The live action Marmaduke was good though
You could say... It was a pretty shitty film.
Damn the mom in marmaduke though am I right?
"father😘 when can I leave to be on my ownnnuh~~😒😒🙄🙄😩😩"
19:55 why do i like being under his table looking up to him???? 😊😊😊
Netflix makes terrible movies so their good movies look even better
Hello, mommy
my eyes are actually burning from watching this im NOT KIDDING .
In school I watched this movie, and I was thinking in my head:wtf is this
It's a tax break/right off thing but yes they are make bad movies on purpose
My theory is they're trying to make a meme movie, like Shrek or the bee movie
Marmaduke frickin sucks bad do not watch please
I dropped Netflix 3 years ago. Because George Soros gave them financial support. So they would create movies with high phycological impact. You know .. Mind bending crap. Maybe not so much in the cartoons. Why does anyone your age waste time watching this crap anyway. WORK ON A FUTURE!  i do not give my money to anyone who takes money from George Soros. If you do not know who george soros is.  I suggest you look it up.  You young people better wake up! Not everything is funny. Some things can have a negative impact.
This, this is why Kim K and Pete broke up.
best movie
The voice actor of the new Pinocchio movie just sounds so gay it makes me laugh
Last year (5th grade) we watched karma duke for some reason, I guess. Uhm, yeah, lots of fart jokes, really dumb
mpreg dog
The dog looks and sounds sort of like scooby doo
The dog zeus’s voice sounded familiar in that clip of him talking and I checked the cast list and how the hell did they get Jk Simmons to voice the damn dog for this movie???
THE BODY PROPORTIONS ARE SENDING ME TO THE SUN
Is called ... get woke go broke
3:13 i shall never see something more funny and horrid at the same time again
one of my friends watched this and someHOW THOUGHT THIS WAS GOOD! WHY
I lost 10 Braincells
I Watch this in class and I was amazed how stupid it was
Why is the animation quality so bad
Hole in wall
the voice acting is ok as shown in the clips
im exited to actually watch this to see how horrible this is i mean should i explore it?
4:18 lmao i swear i heard diggity tang dang dong
fnaf sfm movie
just wait until you see dia of the dead 💀
17:23 dude you killed me I'm subbing
The only people on this plain of existence that enjoy this movie are the fart/inflation fetish people for that one scene
I saw this movie with my step******* at their cousins house (for thanksgiving) and we made fun of the animation and the plot and the best characters we agreed on were the pug and Juan Pedro
Ok one thing, HOW DOES THAT POOL FROM THE BEGINNING HAVE SO MUCH WATErx
This has to be a joke movie. If they were trying... We should give them to da aliens
The sketch with the producer holding the gun to Pete Dadvidson made me howl laughing. "Time for the ending song!" "What ending song?" *brandishing pistol* "I don't know, you tell us. Hit it." *cue bad hip-hop beat*
Why does the villain look like Jar Jar?
Whoever made this movie prob had 100$ to make it
My kid wanted to watch Marmaduke, and it was so hard to look at. I mean like, my eyes hurt because the animation was so bad
This is just a rant about Marmaduke, not Netflix. . .
It's not just Netflix, all of the platforms are streaming diarrhea and they won't stop until 99% of entertainment is trash. It's 2005 all over again
Crackflix
Well that's why Dani isnt making video on Karlson or thing like that lmao
I remember seeing the trailer for this thing. It was one of those trailers that tell the whole plot of the movie with how they are edited.
I like how even my cousins (who are children) think this is still shit
Lol
Zeus is an Afghan Hound
10:10 “he farts so hard I thought he was dying” unfortunately the movie does not want to give us a happy ending
I actually like this movie so I think your opinion is invalid💅
Have you seen the new “Soccer Football movie”?
Hey  noob  it's  a  good   movie
Netflix supported a child pedofile movie so... Yeah 100%
lol the name of this channel
Watch the original Marmaduke
my name is gray 😂
The Dog on the thumbnail just looked like scooby but fat
Reveiw goncharov 1973
marmaduke was originally a live action movie and was REALLY good but this shit, wtf is this
“I think 0 kids have watched this movie” Pretty sure my friend watched it with his like 5 yr old bro-
the only people who would watch this are schools watching m o v i e s rest in peperonis children bruh
i’m forced to watch marmaduke cause my little cousin likes it so much 🤣
Dude even that live action Marmaduke movie was WAAAAAY more likeable than this .-_.-
This movie looks like that food fight movie
We go from Mitchell and the Machines to this
I watched it and the fart seen almost made me stop watching it, I should have stopped watching it at the beginning
You look like the default character
the line “dog training tips your trainer doesn’t want you to know, beat the [CENSORED] out of your dog” was most likely funnier than the entire movie
Wait is this the same company that made squid game 😳📸
6:32 danny out of context
Why does markidukes artstyle seem like the average youtube kids content. Only in Ohio☠️
The voice of poonochio💀💀😭
al I have to say about his movie is .
Honsestly I think it’s pretty good but that’s  his opinion so  I won’t argue                (Sorry if I have bad gramma I should get grammerly)
my gf thinks ur funny
This dog has a magical digestive system
My little brother was forced to watch this movie as a “Prize”.
the live action version is better
Lol
The movie could've been great... but the writers had a problem
My teacher made us watch marmaduke, she said it was her favorite movie😂
bro why does the cat talk like that
YALL to be fair the alligator had to eat too they aren’t disgusting people just because they did it yeah sure it wasn’t the right thing to do but the alligator had to eat
Is Pete the guy in like 35 taco bell adds
Anne with an e died for this
As someone who liked the live action marmaduke, I wanted to cry when I saw the trailer for this
I’m not complaining because this movie was released on my b day lol
Honestly this movie would probably have been a lot better if the dad just took him outback and put him down within the first 10 minutes.
That park became chernobyl
I hope this is only a one time thing for Pete because I’m praying that he’s good as Mirage in the upcoming Transformers movie  Edit: HE WAS PHENOMENAL
as a 11 year old i agree i vomited on sight after seeing this garbage on netflix, also they removed rick and morty so il cancel that shit :/
I fill bad for you if you wacht this more Then one time
wth
That bulldog should of won.
Stick figures
This man is hilarious. He captures awkwardness beautifully. I have watched him for years and his skits are amazing and his commentary is FN hilarious.
Bro looks like he's about to say "Hey guys Today I'm going to be showing the top 10 youtubers that have almost died but before we begin this video I would like to thank this sponsor"
Is this guy just ugly on purpose??
Dude imagine your just walking through a park and you see a british man barking at and fighting a dog
“I don’t know man look, im dating a kardashian” Bro I’m dead💀
Only thing I know about marmaduke is fart moment and OBEY ZUES
Maybe we need to enroll marmaduke into obedien- *fucking explodes*
6:02 sasuke wonders how he has the chidori
Something about your calm monotone voice as you say "beat the shit out of your dog" has me dead
8:41 looks like that one replacement snail in spongebob (larry i believe)
One BILLION LIKES FOR HIS DEATH
This isn’t a movie, it’s psychological torture.
I remember watching this movie a year ago and thinking: what am I watching? Now I can’t help but laugh at Danny’s comments on the movie
You earned a sub w/ your jokes 😂
It’s funny how the outro song was literally the best animated portion in the entire movie💀
Bro maraduke is over 10years old😂
I kinda found this movie funny, not necessarily because it was good, just the shear ridiculousness of it
the animation and style hurts to watch.
marmaduke would be a fun movie to watch with friends just to make fun of
you look like dani that game dev
12:30 for some unholy reason I did maths and the total adds up to $2,939,290.37
2:46 thats straight up a roblox girl character
My brothers who are in fact children watched this 💀 when i saw it I thought they were watching something from tubing Netflix is going downhill
When i watched the movie first before i watched this video i thought it was meh. BUT then i watched this video and realized how bad this move was…😅
Bro marmaduke is so mad
15:37 Guy literally slapped Marmaduke with his ghost foot from like, 20 feet away, isn't that magic?
When you said "I'm not even sure that Pete Davidson knows he's in this movie", I burst out laughing, despite not knowing who Pete Davidson is. I was having a bad day and needed a good laugh. So  thanks for that.
me i have seen this movie
imagine seeing a giant lovecraftian wave beyond your comprehension, of impossible size, and immediately thinking “oh it was my dog”
yes
i wanna pop the "bouncing eggs" at 2:40 like a balloon bro
The funny thing is they played this at my dentist 💀
This is acually the most creepy and uncanny animation i have ever seen
We watched Marmaduke once in school 🤣
Yes
Ahhhhhhh my rat StAbBeD mE 😭😭
"don't worry, kids find farts funny! fart fart toot toot. Absolutely hilarious. Now where is all the money we were supposed to make?" -eavesdropping on a netflix board meeting.
You that movie is great f*** you. Huh I guess you see the new world.
At my school they watched this
Scooby from Walmart
Excuse me pal, but you're talking about the wrong Pinocchio.
the most unbelievable part of this movie is that the trainer thinks he can make a million dollars off dog shows.
My mom offered to watch this movie with my brother. Glad to know I made the right decision on skipping out, but my sincerest condolences to my brother and mother for watching this movie.
It’s a cartoon… and he’s asking if the dogs speaking English or if the trainer was barking….. I mean was the shark really in the pool? 😂 taken wayyyy too serious
I looked through most comments and nobody is really talking how this is based heavily off of my childhood fav show with the same dog character marmaduke it’s a realistic show made much better than this with irl people instead of full cgi animations I suggest u never show ur eyes this horrid marmaduke ripoff and go find the original!! :)
Add 丂乇乂 to roblox  They need to add 丂乇乂 in roblox so bad I'm so 丂乇乂ㄚ mood i want 丂乇乂 in this game dear roblox I am a 卄ㄖ尺几ㄚ person and I need 丂乇乂 in this game kt fulfill my needs it will be so 卄ㄖㄒ and 几卂Ҝ乇ᗪ and I'll 几ㄩㄒ and 丂乇乂 and it will be HotPls
8:48 one of the writers definitely has a fettish for this part. There's no damn way it wasn't.
it's funny how there is another movie called marmaduke, made in 2010, which doesn't seem like a good movie, but when put next to this 2022 piece of garbage, it's the greatest thing ever.
The only good thing about the movie is how you aren't forced to watch it.
0:39 Netflix did do that. Search up "Netflix's first (Insert genre of movie) written entirely by bots" on youtube. I watched it. Funny beyond words.
my brother told my dad he was bored and my dad put on marmaduke. we ended up leaving the movie on the tv and going outside-
Wait…I’m the moniker name for the entire fan base of this channel?   I’m honored
My mom wanted me to watch it , and luckily I said No
I HAD to see that movie cuz of  my sis .....
Is nobody talking about how disgusting marmaduke design is
But he has the whole worldussy
Why does your room look like a gmod render
I swear I was bored and wanted to watch a weird kids movie and I saw this one, forgot the name because it’s freakishly long, and I watched it. I swear there was a joke that literally was like “Ahh stop arguing arguing makes me gassy.. oh no *and then literally releases literal hell upon everyone.” Disgusting. And the way the character said it- I had to stop my self from puking.
Jesus loves you
We all know that Pinocchio true story is the worst movie
am i the only one who thinks pete is creepy looking
This is the live action Scooby-Doo on 100x more cocaine
ahahahaha 🤣
I’m watching this again because idk I just am but I forget how horrendous the visuals of this movie is. It’s right beside the Animated Adam’s Family in that book. As someone who draws in a cartoon style myself I really wonder what the people making this were thinking- there was no way the artists had control because again- horrendous, I can’t see how anyone would approve of it.
Not only do they do this, but they also delay, and delay, every series that they get their hands on. Sometimes months for like a batch of 7 episodes, sometimes years just for 2 seasons.
Danny is the only person who curses a lot but doesn't feel like he's cursing
BRO BROKE HIS WALL FOR A JOKE fuck all other YouTubers Danny is best
The live action marmaduke is way better
3:22  SHEEE THIICCCC
Bro this man can make me laugh at the most serious movie
the cat at 2:08
Who remembers the real Marmaduke movie with Owen Wilson? Also what movie is worse? This or Doogal?
?
Netflix ripedoff the original movie, and original movie was pretty good
what the fock did they do to marmaduke- i remember watching the live action as a kid and loving it why did they butcher my boyyyy
I would’ve called him a “Lame Dane” 😂
Dont swear to God
my mom and i watched marmaduke and it was a wild ride
Maraduke was a live action movie originally. idk if the plots are the same, but i have a weird memory of watching it as a child.
The nose to arm ratio
Danny: This guy isn’t actually that bad, he’s just a little greedy  That guy a minute later: Literally beating the shit out of a dog
Yes
18:22
Dog Guy-Sensei
It literally looked like a pre-vis render and I was like, wait this is the actual movie???
The sad part about the Marmaduke movie is there is another movie called Marmaduke that isn't that bad.
I am terrified of Danny’s bark. why does it sound so good??????
that movie sounds ROOM TEMPATURE ON MUTE!!🔥
That Pete song is crazy 😂
Funny how Danny gets hung up on the trainer beating up Marmaduke when most people would jump at the chance to throw hands with Pete Davidson
If this movie was more popular, guy would be a tumblr sexy man
One of my younger friends was actually watching this.
ok i blame disny and pixare for my likeing in girls
Bro old school Marmaduke was the ish
Just to know that they deny people that have movies better than this that shows that Netflix should be a little bit smarter next time
He also went to Russia
Bounce eggs made me crack up😂
Yeah, capitalism
Easy way to make kids binge watch Netflix instead of YT and get that admoney
Bro really has a shirt titled “DaddysBoy”.
Father, when can i leave to be on my ownnnnnn
digity dangity dang that dog
Is the new marmaduke a shit version of the old one
*HELP, MY FAMILY WANTS TO WATCH MARMADUKE* 😭
Me and my fam watched like 2 min of marmaduke and never watched it again.
I am pretty sure this is a very bad remake of the live action movie "Marmaduke" from 2010, starring Owen Wilson.
Bro plz take a look a dia of the dead
Danny could you please react to the live action marmaduke I swear it’s a lot better
This belongs on Disney-
As an owner of a very playful dog I can tell you that yelling your dog's name every time someone bumps into you or knocks something over or something like that is pretty common
Isn't this like just a bad rip off/remake of the original marmaduke like the live action movie
17:25
This was one of the best vids I've seen today😂
Cocomelon animators can do better then this 😂
Bad movie.
My dad made me watch this td it was kinda funny..........To my dad
"Beat the shit out ur dog 🤗🤗🤗"
I actually watched about 30 seconds of this with my little sisters. One of them is 7 and one of them is 6 and they watched the entire thing and i say there for 30 seconds intensely wishing I could get those 30 seconds of my life back. There was literally NOTHING remotely good about this movie lol.
i feel like when the dog hurt the dad they would put him down immediatly.
I think that Marmaduke is just 10 chihuahuas trapped in a Great Dane’s body
The teacher had the great idia to watch this movei in 4th grade and in the pool scane we all strated laughing cuz ... HOW CAN A POOL FIT THAT MUCH WATHER XD
My lil cousin watched this shi and died
This is the equivalent of a cocomelon knockoff of dog gone trouble.
Oh my gosh I have not been able to understand what rotten potatoes and all the other stuff means for a long time can anyone explain it to me
I Watched The Netflix Movie With My Classmates-
becomes a Christian today!!
This movie makes the Live Action one look like a Disney film
My son said he watched this in school in Art class ! 😂 he said it was weird
This is by far the worst thing I have seen in my entire life… this movie needs to be taken off Netflix
This is probably the second time in animation history where a rich and british side character beat the shit out of a dog.
17:23
17:19
This is just one of those weird videos for kids turned to netflix movie what the actual fuck
6:32 they went all out with part 2
Am I the only one who actually liked Marmaduke??...😭😭
Netflix cant renew sandman but they can make this
why is the mom kinda fine tho
1:36 me
YOU GUYS YOU WOULD NOT KNOW BRIAN HULL IS CREDITED AND PLAYED MARMADUKE’S TRAINER!!! (Guy Hilton.) 🤯
13:03 the dog food is shown to cost 1.4 million dollars i, uhh, what?
anyone esle tired of the orgon gevenore ads cause im sooo anoyed by them
I got a Petco add at 7:19 😂
ı dıd
I hate the trend of animated movies making their main characters sound as plain and generic as possible but this—this is probably the worst of the worst. Marmaduke sounds so darn emotionless, like even he doesn't believe in this movie. This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to get into voice acting even more so that this doesn't happen
Uh Oh... oof
I watched to see if danny edited some of it but he didn't.
So they can get the budget
oh and BTW it had REAL characters including REAL dogs.
I watched the REAL Marmaduke and it was AMAZING!
illumination is what the characters make me look like
am  I the only one who thinks they butchered the animation to a point where its just awful like how at 7:23, the sharks jaw collapses in on itself to the point  that it just looks like a 90. angles
“This humans not about to hit a dog right? No, he kicks the dog” - Danny
I got a PETA add 2 seconds after Danny said “beat the shit out of your dog” 💀
4:17 LOL
av, the term l*me is ableist
U should see the cgi version
pov u watch the movie and ur a child im prolly the only one...
the live action Marmaduke from 2010 was already bad and Netflix somehow made a worse version of it
Marmaduke from 2010 was actually alright.
i have watch the moive
this animation makes me ill
6:02 i thought thunder and lightning were the little rototiller twin pups in the og live-action movie...
Bro took one shit and recreated Chernobyl
I watched the original that one was good
i still dont understAND  when he said that guy was drew goodens biggest fan
Marmaduke is good what do you mean
One time I watched marmaduke in school and it’s so cringe
Dude did you really break your wall?
"father, when can i leave to be on my own" has got to be the worst clip ive EVER heard ever to exist, is has no strive, no enthusasum, and they KEPT IT
I was born in 86 and raised in the 90's you were raised in the 2000's.
my little brother watched it
It’s the fact that my 4 year old niece love marmaduke but she’s 4
Its so bad its good it’s bad its good
The people are just flat out jellybeans .
If they made bad movies, people will talk about it more than if they made a good movie, also making a bad movie is much easier It may sound dumb but think about it, it's true
“Be good little princess or we’re bringing back the dog trainer to beat you till you mind”
Get a load of this blender defult lightning
Pete Davidson in a mood for being in all the bad movies Danny reviews. I feel like at this point lets just deep dive, track all Pete Davidson movies.
the mom's character design is making me VIOLENT they took the toothpick shape of the rest of the characters on top and gave her Human Shaped Legs and just said fuck it for the torso it feels so wrong
I mean it’s kind of good
This film needs a Pitch Meeting. But I couldn't ask Ryan to torture himself with this.
I’m a child and I watched it
I can't stop watching this video , it's so good.
I'm 10 and I HATE MARMADUKE OR WTF HIS NAME IS
Actually my brother has watched this movie so many times I think he obsessed with it
i wachted it
imagine being good.
This was what they did on bring your kid to work day...
ok ngl i laughed at how bad this movie was. it was confusing,dumb and didn't even make sense to me at all. plus you can tell the voice actors didn't even feel interested.  it felt like they just came up with the movie in a hour and said yep this is good.   this movie is what i call✨L A Z Y✨
Don't Talk about my lord and savior Marmaduke like that
This is my favourite Danny gonzalez video
Fun littebitty thing MY TEACHER PLAYED THIS...
I was actually thinking that he died
There's also the live action Marmaduke made many years ago, that was pretty good.
why are all these people so fkin skinny oh my god
Bro, my sister was watching this and I started crying of how hilarious it was. (And not in a good way)
The live action  marmaduke is pretty good tho tbh
I watched it😂😂
14:02 is this sonic adventure 2 or am I tripping from these mouth talking movements… Also 18:08 with the dog’s jarring head movements. I can see why he had to scroll down for this movie.
It kind of gives me Food Fight vibes, like how they just didn’t finish the lighting or the shadows and how the models themselves look fucking horrifying
can you  review  some assembly required  tv  show  it is a  bad   live action tv show film toronto
I went to my grandparents house today, and rediscovered a bunch of the dvds I use to watch all the time as a young kid. Until I came across this movie with a Great Dane on the cover, which I had very vague memories of. (for reference it was a live action movie, not an animation) As I read the back of the cover to try to remember what the story was about, I stared at the front and noticed… The title was Marmaduke! That’s when I made the realization that the very badly animated movie covered in this video, was in fact just a really shitty attempt at a sequel for what seem to be a series of stories about Maraduke the Great Dane.
Marmaduke is jacked
Bruh that trainer's almost 2D XD
Maraduke turned the park into chernobel
MARMADUKE FUCKING DIES L L L L BOZO
One time my teacher put this on in class and me and my friend called the movie big nose show
I'm sorry but the "Father when can I be on my ownn 💅" kills me every time
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life I wanna watch it on repeat it's just so good and funny that he left his house and his family
The stomach noises are actually Guy trying not to throw up.
The original live action version was so much better
To be honest if you can hypnotise the judges you deserve to win
Bro your sarcasm is the best 😂😂
Dislike
ryan trahan with swear words:
👍
Ok can we talk about the fact that the parents look like siblings....
Yeah I hate that movie -8/10
The original marmaduke on dvd was pretty good
Fun Fact: This movie is a rip off of the 2019 "Marmaduke" movie. But this "Marmaduke" movie is a live action (I don't really know what's called) Srry for bad grammar, english isn't my first language =)
My 7 year old sister and 41 year old dad loved this movie. Why the fuck am I in this family- Edit: she’s 8 and he’s 42 now. AND MY DAD DOESNT GET WHY I HATE THE MOVIE?? I’m 14
Mamraduke is a good movie😡😡
Father, when can I leave to be on my ownnnn 💅💅💅
What door
Personal movie it sucks I fell sleep watching it so bad
not gonna lie i'd watch this movie lol and i'm 19 turning 20 ha
I love marmaduke
the first minute of this video is so intense it’s so funny how hard he’s ripping into this movie
took off that 70s show for this shit
i have sadly
Look what they did to Scooby Doo.
Lazy writers. I'm so sick of the remakes!
I’m a Greg notifications on and I’m subbed
This animation is so bad there are parts that are literally sticking out of walls. at 7:49 the dog's ear just noclips through the curtain on the window.
My siblings watched it
Danny is insane😂 He NEEDS to become a stand-up Comedian
I was watching this with someone because I had literally nothing else to do, and if you haven't seen it, please don't watch.I thought it was.. Ok at first but,  The whole trophy scene thing literally made me turn the tv off and I almost threw something at the tv. Honestly just grossed out and I don't know if its just me or everyone.
On a related note, I read an article about how Netflix may have realized they can no longer afford to stay woke. They canceled Megan Markle’s animated series about an African-American girl who travels through time to learn about history before it began because they finally realized that no child would watch that lol.  And yes, they are the ones who originally greenlit it.
You should retitle this video to say, “My Review of Pete Davidson’s Marmaduke. Oh, and 30 seconds of Why Does Netflix suck?”
i hated this movie but ur reactions made it funnier
😄😄😄😄😄😄
The og Marmaduke is better😅
I’m a kid and I Watched it😂😊
My sister watched this movie they hated it
hey did anyone notice how the window broke in to pieces and there probably going into people and maybe even killing people?
I've seen that Marmaduke Movie and   It's worse than you think
MaramAduku I watched that one in the fart scene was just embarrassing
Yo mama so thic
noooo there was a live action (ish, with a little cgi ofc) movie called marmaduke and i think this is a remake of it??? </3 it was so nostalgic for me
Bruh “Father when can I leave to be on my ownnnnnn.”
This looks like this was made in the early 2000’s
3:54 stop you're so cute help
9:55 I swear the first time I saw this I burst out laughing💀
My mom almost had us as a family watch this movie. Thankfully she forgot.
Top ten tips to train a misbehaved dog: number one: animal abuse
Danny crawling on floor had me dying,my man decided to become an actor
Im sorry, I know its weird but I know for a FACT that I was not the only one breaking down in tears of laughter when marmaduke “died”. Like come on!
Same production quality as Goat story
Danny's description  to this movie is so hilarious- 😭
I thought when marmaduke ‘died’ he would just fart and then credits roll
This guy is legit the only person who can make me laugh
The new trailers do look pretty nice though...
Jesus christ this movie looks like a 2 dollar knock off bin movie from Walmart
i love how every character is just a stick man and the mom is just a whole bakery
When he was talking about the dad's nose to arm ratio I laughed so hard I pooted.
i think youtube is falling apart someone tried to copy right strike me for a song they dont own its by powfu
LOL! You said "all THE sudden" like you never learned grade school English! OMG!
BREAKING NEWS: Fog farts so hard he badically sets off a nuclear bomb
Because they’re woke.
I feel like your face is a deep fake 🫣
How about a “Shartzu”
they did marmaduke so dirty with that animation😭 the live action wasn't that bad imo
You should watch the new Clifford movie
Marmaduke should’ve won because at the start when he makes the tsunami there is a bigger water mass then there was in the pool before he did it he also manipulate and multiply masses like weight and other masses
bro the only good netflix show (that is orginal;in my opinion) is babysitters club,oddballs(odd1sout's new show),and ALL THE POKEMON ANIMES EXCEPT ARCUES CHRONICLES
7:50 I think Marmaduke understands people in general. Not just the trainer. The trainer understands dogs. So, they can talk.
Why he like a really bad deepfake of Tom Holland
POV your name is Greg : HOW DOES HE KNOW MY NAME?!
This had me dying of laughter
Did anybody notice this 3:24 pause there
I watched this movie at high school with my friends just to make fun of it.
watch the real life version of marmaduke
2 reason why NetFlix is a Faliure   1 they are deleting Naruto    2 I watch one of the anime show but for some reason there was no season 1    Bonus: Victorious had 4 seasons on Netflix before and now it’s 2 for fuck sakes
I was sitting in class anda few seconds before my period ended this dude sitting next to me says I love marmaduqe I'm. Like: bro that low budget movie is worse than spookly the. Square pumpkin I rate marmaduqe a 5/10
2:39 I’m dying💀💀
Lfmao the antagonist dog looks like Vinny from family guy
Okay but the way he broke his wall😭💀
My little brother is obsessed with this movie. Please, PLEASE, help me. Help me escape this hell.
Netflix has really gone down hill.
What’s the movie called I wanna prank my family by showing them this lol
I kinda liked it
I don't think the movie is bad it's just Goofy. xD  I didn't watch it but it's honestly funny to think about how his bloated belly returned or disappeared. It's so random! Okay I agree that the fart and stomach rumbling noises were disgusting... But I love how they just went wild with random stuff. Sometimes cartoons don't need a story, maybe they just need a way to catch a kid's attention. And the movie being supernatural at some times was pretty good!   The overall performance isn't too good tbh but I enjoyed the potential of this.   As for the design. Well I don't mind a wild design. Not everything should follow the default ideals I think it could have been perfect!  Perhaps it was an attempt to make movies and I very much like it! :D
The only good part of that entire movie was the bulldog lifting a stadium. I’ll admit in any other movie that would be awesome.
5:19 was a jumpscare
Nothing is more weird than Zeus being JK Simmons
British☕☕☕☕☕☕
9:59 wait what
I’m pretty sure this is actually a movie version of a cartoon from the newspaper. I’m not sure if it got printed anywhere but it does show in San Antonio. I was kind of surprised to see that less people didn’t know this but yeah, this isn’t its own thing.
this is fuc*ing gold💀💀💀
The dog show became Chernobyl 😂   It’s impressive how Danny summarises a a whole movie in 21 minutes and explains how bad it is. I understand that this is a bad movie (in your eyes) but this is pretty much with every animation/childish movie. Nothing makes sense if you really think about it. And that’s the point. Children don’t watch movies and think about what they see. They just watch and that’s it. They don’t understand how weird it is that a dog can lift a weight and lift a while building cause it’s an animation. So it’s supposed to not make sense.  Also Marmaduke looks like Scooby-Doo
My cat farts sometimes in my father’s face, it almost seems intentionally but she loves my father the most of us 😂
18:41 Is it okay if I laugh at this part because he just gets back up?
the first movie has no rotten tomatoes because no one bothered to watch it to completion. The day this movie was made, people commiting the unthinkable sky-rocketed.
M staying under the desk
11:24 TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING
Dude, these animations are worse than Shrek that was made in 2009
I hate when my dog farts so hard he makes an exclusion zone the size of a small country that is inhabitable by people because of radiation
This made my week
That shit hit harder than chernobyl
i've seen this like 3 times it's soooooooooooooooooo good

Story of chernobyl be like
the live action version of this movie was pretty good ngl
The animation ruins the original which was really good, for those who haven't seen the original Marmaduke plz go watch it!
OMG I FORGOT THIS MOVIE the original was my favorite movie when I was little☹️
You should watch hoodwinked
You know I pause white here 3:24 and it kind of look like the dad is just blown up.
I saw like 10 seconds of this move then left because it sucked so much😢
marmaduke sitting on the dad is litterally me and my little brother like he beats me the FUCK UP for like a game console or something like “MOM SAYS ITS MY TURN!!!!!” Then he kills me or something
the original marmaduke is 🔥🔥
Danny: This innocent dog.  Marmaduke: *chases the cat, attacks the butcher for bones, beats up the dad for his chair, created a tsunami in the backyard, ate all the food and created a hazard zone, killed a bunch of birds, sent 30 people to the hospital, put his family in crippling debt, caused the kids to get bullied, killed the youngest daughter, blew up a nucular power plant, and stole tons of people's data*  {Edit: I forgot some of Marmaduke's crimes}
I think extraction is the only movie actually keep some standard
I don’t know if any noticed but the guy named guy was probably copied by the guy named guy in croods
"I thought this guy was going to be the villian because he's rich-- and British. And that's kinda the law for villians to rich and British"  Yes Danny--- just....yes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It felt off when you got to the ad. I couldn't figure out why for a few seconds. But... his hand being directly above the camera. And more importantly... an unfavorable camera angle
It genuinely hurt to watch this video because of how bad the movie was
My brother loved this movie and this was one of the only things I’ve watched for a month
the funny thing is i watched this and wondered why the animation was so weird lol
I cannot believe that he watched this willingly
Also the animation looks so terrible
i think that Marmaduke can understand english and the trainer can understand the barking
Of course I get a febreeze ad during this
I feel like they do this on purpose 😂
Stop cussing please and Ty
The animal talking looks like SA1
my goofy ahh uncle marmaduke demarcus the second fell down the elevator after taking perk 92🗿🗿🗿
12:11 I got a swiffer ad right after this
I feel like the art style they're going for in this movie is knock off 3D animation from 2005 🤮🤮🤮
I miss the old marmaduke, it was bad but I miss it
obsessed with the line delivery where marmaduke is like "i'm gonna unleash THUND-... LIGHT-". why does he say those words like that
Pete Davidson being an all-encompassing success (technically- all his content is a joke though) right now is as mind-boggling as when Jake Paul became a superstar.
The fact that there is a live action of this movie that came before this movie
"Father, when can I leave to bee on my oahhhnn..."
You know the bad thing a little kid probably actually liked this movie some how👁👄👁
10:27
Just for context  A) Marmaduke doesn't talk. The joke in the comic is he's big and that's it. B) There was already an awful Marmaduke movie with an uncomfortable dance scene C) somehow despite almost every okay straight to tv children's movie from like the 90s to mid 2000s being about funny animals, they failed twice
The original Marmaduke was actually ok and then you have this shit
how did they get pete davidson to sign off on this movie
The original marmaduke movie was..fine but this.. It’s not fine
Actually Marmaduke is a popular book series of a funny dog they made a funny life action movie of it too
Imagine your internet service Provider sells what your kinks are
Even Coco melon is better than this shit
19:22 this sounds like a dr evil rap cover
The original marmaduke was a funny movie sucks that they go and ruin movies like this
Please, please, ARE YOU FERTILE?
Damn mom is thhhhick
it's not A BAD MOVIE my little cousin loves this movie
It’s really annoying how they portrayed Great Danes in this movie 😢
i like the movie
hopefully
That would be 1.4mil not 1.5
gya
AVE SUSS AVE SUSS!!
not me cackling at Marmaduke's dead body
danny gongy s
skete back at it again as the duke?
Paw patrol is better than this
I'm a kid and I watch a bit in the start and I hate italready
Bro Marmaduke was on last year at my school and it was the worst thing I have ever seen.

Dude for a second I really thought Danny broke his wall
5,2715
if you think thats bad try doing pets untied its a awful movie
I remember watching this movie on 2x speed and it was still taking forever to get through.
When I saw the first shot with humans I just thought: Vegietales
8:48
19:22 this is funnier than the rapping dog in Titanic animated movie
amaze
this movie is offensive to dogs and life itself
The original live action marmaduke was actually so good I would definitely recommend watching it if you haven’t
13:21
6:20 to be fair, the dog started it
"very large and very sad *doggy"* 💀
Fun fact: Marmaduke has been a menace to society for far longer than you thought, as he was a Nazi sympathizer back in the early 1940s and even had partaken in activating the gas chambers 7 times.
I thought there was already a Marmaduke movie. Live action. 2010.
The og Marmaduke was so damn good
marmaduke is god
It's bad cuz I saw it
Why did you spoil the lore , bro?! 😭😭😭
Netflix is not that good with movies and marmaduke is not good. We get it. Why do you have to make a 20 minute video on it?
16:25 because Guy doesn't have the GOLDEN FLEECE OF MY ZEUS!!!
I was born on earth to!
Hehe
bro is getting old😧😧
Lilo and Stitch I'd a better dog training movie.
It was the stupidest movie I ever saw
You were hoping no one saw it and well I saw it because my mom made me and I almost threw up. Because it was the worst
I’ve watched this movie it’s crap
Danny looks like a default sim
why did they make the ending credits actually well animated but the movie is just ugly like they couldve done the whole movie like that
That movie looks horrible
With the bill he probably billed them so much because his reputation in theory was also ruined
Since Riverdale is based of the Archie comics, I’m choosing to believe this is Netflix’s gritty, weirdly kinky, horror-esque reboot of the Marmaduke comics
0:09Father when can i leave to be on my oUwUn
This movie is actually in comes in Poland.. I'm so confused how.
19:23 Phil nibbeling worked on this? Oh boy. .
Why the hell didn’t Zuzse hypnotise the crowd to make him win?

This is by far the worst movie ever made somehow even worse than The Master of disguise
BRO I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY BROKE THE WALL FOR A SECOND ABYUDHJWANBIDANWKNUADJKWLKADW
the way some of the people have fingers thicker than their legs or "thighs" is so awful
I’m sorry but all I think of is carter kench when I see u
2000
This is visually horrifying I literally don't know any other way to put it
20:00 It's because idiots keep voting for local representation who sponsored such an idea, including "Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas, Sen. Tom Cotton from Arkansas, Sen. Rand Paul from Kentucky, Sen. Mike Lee from Utah, and Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida".
Why does the animation of this film make it seem like it came out a decade and a half ago? Heck, why does the story remind me of those dumb animal movies from the late 80s and 90s (y'know, Oliver and Company, T&J the Movie)?
So um me and my brother  (5 years old) were on Netflix just looking for a movie to watch then he picked marmaduke and I’ve never been the same since.🥲
Marmaduke: farts **Logic has left then chat**
:49 FALSE!!!! There is a redeeming quality: the scene where dog trainer guy beats the crap out of marmaduke us glorious
The OG marmaduke is genuinely a good movie please watch that one instead Danny - love your fan mags
I heard Zeus's voice, and I died a little inside because I think I heard J. K. Simmons.  OMG I LOOKED IT UP IT'S ACTUALLY J. K. SIMMONS I THINK I DIED A LITTLE.
i have a feeling the person who designed the marmaduke eating the entire banquet scene has a certain. uh. how do i say this
13:30 tbh I can relate to the dog tho
I can confirm as someone who does sometimes do dog shows that there is a majestic Afghan hound(?) that has better hair than I will ever have who convinces a Great Dane to eat everything.
REACT TO THE SLEEPOVER MOVIE it’s hilariousssss
My sisters kindergarden showed this to my poor little sister
I’m used to movies worse so this was good to me idk lol
this movie helped me get through one of the hardest times of my life. you see, back in 2020, i had been going through a crisis. i was never good enough. everybody around me was surpassing my accomplishments and abilities, and i felt like i was one of the worst, most unskilled, untalented, uncool people ever. every day was misery.  and then i became internet famous for detonating a nuclear weapon. thank you, marmaduck, for inspiring me during these hard times.
Why are kid’s movies so violent tho
When Danny opened with ‘hello!’ so enthusiastically, my dog looked up like she wanted to greet him back
I like how the public can make better stories that actual movie companies
12k
i was lowkey hoping for him to be marmadead
Jesus Christ loves you all repent for your sins before it’s too late.
Its sad cuz i really liked the original marmaduke movie
I was just watching this and omg marmaduke sucks 😢
5:16 Gordon Ramsay: you sure about that
hellooo greg.
I hate how this movie is being shown in the cinemas in this country.
Starts new season with a balance of women and men and colour!! Then season 2 comes along and suddenly only WOMEN in cover and then all men are weak or stupid... oh and if your white you are fucked
e
Wait - has no one seen the OG Marmaduke?? That was the best
Lifting up a building?  Kinda mid in my opinion  Running around?  Now, that's something that excites me.
I'm sure it's your flair for description, but you made this sound infinitely funnier than it probably was.
At the end of the day the people who worked on this was definitely smoking or snorting something
I watched this movie in my 5th grade class and everyone thought it was horrible. If fifth graders think that your movie is horrible, its time for you to find a new career💀
I remember when my mom turned this on for family movie night and made me stay in the room becuase she said we needed family time. I'm the oldest so my younger siblings always get to pick the movie and its always somthing stupid like this.
Pete Davison is the absolute worst...at everything. I never want to see or hear about him ever again.
Netflix is always a hit or a miss. I mean on one hand there’s midnight mass, stranger things, queens gambit, and on the other hand there’s this shit
I am horrified. Is this movie based on the Marmaduke comic strip? The original artist's family must all be deceased or should be deceased for allowing this.
They defiled the name of the Marmaduke comics.
Why is the fart like a neon green 😂😂
The movie Marmaduke is actually a good movie, but only the live action one...
ok i never usually blame the animators in movies, shows, or video games...but yall, what in the ever-living flip flop femur did you do here?
last year, on the last day of school before summer break I was in band and I was chillin with all my friends in band, then my band teacher puts on THIS FUCKING MOVIE and we all just sat there in shock. it was so horrible, he could’ve literally picked ANY other movie and he chose MARMADUKE.
12:11 who else got a toilet paper ad here? edit: Jesus Christ yall still getting ads in this specific timestamp 💀💀💀
Danny what’s your opinion about jojo’s bizarre adventure?
this brings shame to the 2010 marmaduke
You can just HEAR the misery in Danny's voice when he's struggling to describe the bit at 10:10.
Broo the mom is built like a 🍐
Because I like it when people give real opinions about stuff
I love these trips of videos
Broo
I was such a huge fan of the original Marmaduke movie growing up and THIS kills me a little
1:15
I saw this and I litterly  did not pay attention to it at all 😭
Great job on the thumbnail.❤️
What is it with Danny’s videos and rapping dogs?
You’re wrong on this one. Farts are always funny.
i'm better at storys than this movie
Well this is a dogshit movie      Get it?Cause he farts in one sce-
16:33  The flashbacks I just had of two years ago were so vivid...🖤🤍
I love this man
You know what I actually like it. You know why? It is so bad, and so devorced from anything that resembles Marmaduke that it doesn't taint the source material.  It is so devorced from reality that it doesn't make me feel bad. It was just some moving colors that I didn't pay attention to.
The models, the animating, the budget. This movie sucks.
danny is illegaly funny
And no one is going to mention how that steel bar didn’t bend under the weight of a building
Review the movie ozzy
Y’all me and my dad watched this movie after watching this video. I cannot even begin to express how horrible this movie is. I’m honestly amazed that Danny was able to make this movie seem like it had a coherent plot at all. He made this movie seem so much better than it was.
What happend to the "hey Greg's and welcome back to (random thing)" intro ngl I miss it
I hate the animation so much 😟
i burst out laughing when that siamese cat was like “believe in yrself 🥺🥺🥹” LIKE WHY ARE HIS EYES SO SPARKLY LMAOOO
mar a doo burger 🍔🍔🍔🍔
This is like a modern SpongeBob episode I don't like it
My kids watched it. It was weird but they sat through the whole thing but never brought it up again. As we are watching your video, they are asking to watch it again.
fake danny plesse reply to me
9:50 AGAIN?! DANNY!
I'm sorry is supposed to be like Marmaduke the Sunday newspaper cartoon? Because that makes this ten times worse.....
I watched Marmaduke at work, it is so confusing and creepy and weird
Dude this movie was 100% made by someone with a plethora of fetishes. That huge belly/fart shit is straight up EXACTLY the type of shit you'd see on deviant art, complete with the gurgles. It's pretty disgusting to be so blatant espeically when it's supposed to be a childrens movie
Lol, hypnosis exists in this reality 😅
That song gives off Poochie vibes
13:21 you should have made a joke about putting the dog down
Please please please do a review on Mr pickles
Rick and morty Rick and morty Rick and morty Rick and morty Rick and morty
When I watched this movie w my family I actually thought that guy, guy was evil like WHAT?!
How did they even get the rights to the name of the movie, there’s a movie also about a dog called marmadule but it’s actually good
6:12 Missed opportunity to say that they put their “Marma-Dukes Up” 😂😂
I'm laughing so hard oml
Do you think they made him a great dane so they could make the not-so-great dane joke? Probably
Get Danny to 6 million subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was listening to asmr and as soon as I opened my phone to change the video I just  hear "hello Greg!"
Hey Guy!
does anyone else think it's weird that the cheerleader bullies are so diverse
It doesn't feel like Pete Davidson did this willingly, like he owed one of the the directors a favor and it's voicing a dog
Terrorism
Why is this guy not doing standup😭😭😭
Some Netflix movies are really bad, but you haven’t seen anything until you see Plex
Lol I love just watching an angry Danny the first few seconds in the video Danny seems like actually angry about this movie
"small tsunami" yeah right, that thing looks giant.
The original Marmaduke (live action one) was actually good and I loved it as a kid, but this movie here sucks
That one guy named Greg = 👁👄👁
get ebola
The the way they just,,,, layer the effects on top,,,, like they made it with one of those fucjing templates on imovie- I’m- words cannot describe my emotions rn
this movie is pure fetish
7:24 Is this SCP-1128 😂 ?
10:51 the dog paw😭
7:48 the dog's ear clips through the curtain 😶
sorry but my jaw fucking dropped when the mom with pixar mom syndrome appeared.
This movie was playing when I arrived at my literal worst babysitting job ever. Like, I've had some bad jobs but this one took the cake. I don’t think it's a coincidence that this movie was on.
im upset they ruined a good movie with this
Why does this movie remind me of showoff swindle by gordon korman
I feel the same way about marmaduke talking
This movie makes Foodfight! look like Inside Out.
*dukes
foodfight had better animation than this lol
The animation seems like they were trying to go for like a despicable me style but they failed miserably
Not gonna lie the maharmaduke movie feels like a nursery rhyme video
Jesus. H. Christ. 18:31, look at the dads face. It feels like he’s staring into my soul, sucking the life force out of my body until I’m a human shell capable of watching this movie and not feeling like actual death.
THE Pixar mom syndrome
Why are moms getting thicker… getting harder to hold this load
I'm sorry Danny but I can't watch this video. I have been a fan since the mesozoic but after seeing this review, I can't agree. This movie was just a dog messing around and you had the audacity to make fun of it? THIS IS NOT A FUNNY MOVIE. If anything, it is a cinematic masterpiece in its story and deserves to held up on the highest pedestal. Sure, it can be a bit goofy at times, but it is still amazing.
danny gets funnier over time i swear
this video really made my day, thank you!
Been a fan of Danny for years, but this went over the line. Marmaduke is my all time favorite move and this is just plain mean. The dog is trying his best and you insult him. Marmalade is a personal friend of mine and you will be hearing from him.
The dog has the ability to make solid into gas in 2 seconds
I GOT A FUCKING DOG FOOD AD DURING THIS
I feel like I'm going crazy bc I stfg this movie already existed
PIXAR MOMS DONT HAVE DUMPIES BARELY ANY OF THEM DO GRAHHHHHHGHGHH
XD HIGH AND INDIFERENT
the proportions
The re-watchability of this video is crazy, I’ve watched it about 7 times already
This is Netflix!?
My freaking teacher put this on at the end of a year. I wanted to die mentally & physically.
this got to be the worst movie ever but its so funny
Review finding Jesus it’s the best thing you’ll ever see lmao
When will pete Davidson go away? It's not happening fast enough
I miss the 2010 Version of Marmaduke
12:21 why did that actually look so real
Nuclear fart
The fuckin dog
i was hoping marmaduke died
This dog needs to learn to use their power. Like if they wanted to they could kill the whole earth.            Dude came back to life!
my sister is obsessed with this movie and it is really annoying
The fact that both the mom and the father have brown hair yet both of the children have -blonde- yellow hair genuinely concerned me
it’s like they tried to depict autism but just decided to not learn what autism looks like
my 8-year-old sister was watching this movie and I walked in.   she's not my sister anymore.
the original marmaduke wes much better
I loved the original live action movie, I don't know if that's an unpopular thing to say and maybe it's the nostalgia talking but the live action has a special place in my heart, so this new animated version just disappoints me a lot, thank god Danny's humor made it easier to swallow
your videos genuinely never fail to make me laugh omg
danny why were we on our knees in front of you during that ad read
this is actually a dark narration about a dog dealing with his destructive binge eating disorder and the toll it takes on his family…wow 💔
You’re fucking hilarious when you do movie reviews
Why did they make this dog look like one of the fucked up hyena things from the scooby doo live action movie?
did the grill just explode? What the..
You should review paws of fury: the legend of hank next, I haven’t seen it but I know it’s an abomination
The animation sucks💀
MARMADUKE IS A GREAT DANE *Breaks Hand*
omggg... that same fvking movie was in my tv ads
what sucks is that the ending animation for the song is objectively better than the actual movie animation
why they built like heccin spagetti tho
randon thing but i got my phone to goitch so i can see the comments now, yay :)
this legit looks like a 90-minute mobile game ad
8:34 white women
Rich and British hmm yeah I only check one box sadly I'm not rich enough to be evil 🥲
hi Danny you are cool
Cool vid
this like my discomfort video, any time im too comfortable with my life i watch this and realize how bad the world is because of this movie but like yea danny great video keep it going
Literally the most disgusting animation and art style. The worst looking movie I have ever seen. Every movement and facial expression is so unsettling and unnatural.  I actually regret watching this video because it caused me to stain my eyes with this revolting movie.
Watch the original marmaduke, the live action one, I loved that one but I was five when I last saw it sk don’t bully me.
i like how danny says they introduce magic with like 20 minutes left in the movie but did he miss the part when guy’s foot floated across the field and slapped marmaduke???
coming back here bc i am currently babysitting and one of the kids is choosing what we watch and now we are watching this god forsaken movie
My little brother and sister watch this show and they like it
Danny you are so funny I had to pause the video because I was genuinely choking and dying on my pasta
This is my favorite bad movie  :]
I watched this compared to a few movies. Those movies being Sahara (2017) and Tall girl and for some reason this managed to the the most enjoyable of the three. What the fuck.
In the end song when I heard the record scrub and I saw marmaduke start rapping with those sunglasses, it triggered my PTSD…..    *it’s party time…. Party time….*
My question is how the fuck did JK Simmons get roped into this shitshow.  Like the man has such a great voice and a swathe of better shows/movies he's starred in, was he like held at gunpoint to voice the evil dog?!?
I've never subscribed to Netflix, and never will. Even though they pick up series from Amazon Prime.
Bro Pete never talked about it bc all he needed to see was the first minute of the movie to know very well what’s just been done
0:42 I will not tolerate “Zapped” slander that movie was amazing
As someone who works with dogs this movie is horrible and I would like to have a long conversation with whoever came up with this, especially the bill the trainer gave them. Also the dogs behavior in the beginning of the movie is their fault for not getting him trained. It’s like someone who’s never owned a dog wrote this movie and thought “it’s exactly like owning a dog and I would know cause I have a fish”
They’re making bad movies for money so you rent the movie for like five dollars and then it sucks and then that’s a waste of five dollars bam there we go👎👎👎
Marmaduke has only two uses (torcher and teaching people what not to do when doing anything at all ,like even if yore trying to be a dictator allowing this in you’re country to force others in to obedience is a step to far for there personal moral compass.)
i got a febreze ad after the fart scene
i remember having to watch this with my family and i remember thinking it was atrocious i still do like wtf was the ending
I think that the fart scene was definitely a way to lure kids into watching the show because even kids today think it's hilarious to fart.
I made my class wach it
Netflix is the next straight-to-vhs, is what I'm hearing
there was already a movie called marmaduke but it was live action and it was like actually fucking good
6:44
Honestly no one would watch these movies because they’re good, but most likely to see how bad and dumb it is
The concept was actually good...
I almost forgot pete voice over the dog
19:23 “I’m the biggest dog” *ad plays*
✝️💗
i loved the live action marmaduke growing up, this is just offensive
React to “Igor (U.S)” trust me its bad.
Is Netflix Just Making Bad Movies On Purpose yes yes they are
what is the sound effect danny uses in 9:20 ?
I actually watched this in my class and everyone in my class was disgusted and bored af, including me.
I like Pete Davidson. But wtf is this.
Marmaduke really made the dog competition area into Chernobyl 2.0
This movie summed up: What da dog doin'?
ok but like its a kid movie
yo at the end marmaduke went back to the lobby
This movie looks like one of those 1 season nickelodeon shows that had a good premise at heart but completely crashed budget wised and got taken down by the end of season 1
Why is your couch named Greg
Why do they have to keep doing this to things I loved as a kid? Marmaduke was one of my favorite Funnies as a kid. For all you children out there, the Funnies were comic strips in the newspaper.
“Pete Davidson is a funny guy.” This statement makes me sad because he is one of the most unfunny people I’ve ever watched
this was the most hilarious video danny has ever made
my reaction was: “what the helllll oh my god”
my reaction was: “what the helllll oh my god”
my reaction was: “what the helllll oh my god”
My baby brother watching this every day : 😃😃
They played this movie for me at school. We hated it idk why they did that.
They did not do the original movie justice at all if you don’t know this is a spin off movie the original movie is a live action movie from the 2000s
maybe netflix is is making these trash movies so they get attention for these youtubers.  BUT THATS JUST A THEORY A FILM THEORY!!!!!!!!!
4:27 the harmonization~
3:23 the quality of the animation LIKE BRO THIS ISNT DISNEY 😭
idfk when this was made, but the animation seems really bad and the colors incorporated in the film- i can see why rotten tomatoes would give it a zero lmao
You forgot one crucial part where marmaduke almost murdered guy with a shampoo shelf
The animation looks like one of those terrible youtube animations
You should watch the original live action Marmaduke, it's very different from this one
You r so fucking hillarious!
It wouldve been amazing if he died. I get joy from children's sadness.
Marmaduke has Fluoroantimonic acid in his stomach.
19:25
Father ✨When 💅can I leave 😒to be on my own✋😩 I've got the whole world to see ✋😌🌎
Danny Please react to The Mermaid princess!!!! its a knock off movie of the little mermaid
Bro they did the old Marmaduke movie DIRTY! Like shit I thought the 2010 version was a good movie, honestly kinda liked it, but this is just utter TRASH.
I’m guessing most of the money supposed to be used for the animation was used on cocaine and just used their face to animate the movie. The animation is just absolutely ugly and awful.
we know who created chernobyl
3:47 Danny’s fake pout is actually rlly cute 😭
To this day, marmadukes poisonous gas has killed millions across the planet.
The bee was the highest quality animation in the entire movie.
Imagine if he actually just died right there, that would’ve been funny.
Wasn’t there a real life movie about a dog called mar marmaduke?
More water came out of that pool than what we even had in it.
Eating dinner right now and I cannot do it because I keep on cry laughing. If my future bf is not this funny I don’t want it
11:35 can we talk about the traumatized cheerleader in the left?
marmaduke more like marmadookie because he laid a fat one
Did you know there is a live action marmaduke….
These praying mantis people are very frightening to look at
actually - ive paid for netflix to make these shitty movies to keep my indian mom busy because she loves them. so much.
I hope Sundae didn't hear any of your recordings and think you were talking about her ):
LOL pete davidson sad very large doggy meaning he called the person he played a fat dod
Adored the live action marmaduke and this movie makes me feel violated
He should react to the live action Marmaduke
I saw my brothers watching this movie and I was like the fuck is this it looks horrible
The editing, the animation, the voice acting, the story or lack there of, the character design, everything is terrible. And you're telling me it's a Netflix original? Netflix budget? No way
this seriously is his funniest video ever I laughed through the entire thing
Alright Danny, you’ve convinced me, i will partake in watching this masterpiece.   This whole fucking movie has characters that sound like Davidson’s voice pitched at different octaves and i wanna sell my soul now.
Who is Greg?
HOLY FUCK THIS SHI SO FUNNY
This movie genuinely feels like a story that I would tell my 6 year old brother before he goes to bed.
this is why kim broke up with pete
I subbed with notifications I am Greg now
My teacher showed me this show 😭✋
They had a 50 mil budget, I’m starting to think they only spent 100k on the movie and pocketed the rest of it
DANNY SHOULD REVIEW THE ORIGINAL 2010 MARMADUKE
no way, whoever made this movie must have a fart and vore fetish because what the hell
My biggest problem with this movie is the fact that Marmaduke doesn’t even look EVEN close to a Great Dane which is the breed he’s supposed to be.  He looks like a human in a dog suit
I kind of like Marmaduke
Guy is William afton confirmed
So now that he almost died they love him. What kind of fried up university is this??? This dog has ruined our family and public image! But now that he serves as a financial gaining advantage, it's a real inconvenience he's dying!
crying this is so funny
I'm sure that Netflix made a fatal accident they made the worst movie that should never exist
To be honest when everyone thought marmaduke died I actually wished that he died it’s funny like finally someone in a shit kids movie dies or whatever yeah anyways… bakaaaaaa
Cuz of this video I wont watch It and I’m happy that Danny Gonzalez made this video cuz I would be so sick if I watched the movie and it came to that disgusting part where marmaduke farted and murdered birds and to be honest I only liked that cat ppl always make cats adorable I love cats… that’s all
i loved the live action marmaduke show when i was young i watched it so many times cannot believe how downhill it’s got
Pov:netflix lets go another negitive score
naur they’re showing this in the cinemas in estonia 😭😫😫😫
Even tho Netflix make low budget movies except theres one thing you forgot about Netflix’ theres always someone just goin ✨GAY✨
It's kind of smart that the dog trainer said he'd share the 1mil with the family, fully knowing they would need much more then 1mil after he was done training the dog
my sister watched this movie and loved it :'(
Show us your Guinea pigs
Show us your Guinea pigs
Like everyone else is saying….I’m concerned, there seems to be some……interests……..present in these bad movies
how did pete davidson agree to this😭
“I’m dating a Kardashian I don’t need this.” *By God that did not age well* 😳
why is no one talking about the fact that this was originally a live action movie😭😭i watched it sm when i was younger and it was so much better than whatever this is
Dang you roasted marmaduke but I still liked marmaduke tho
This is the movie they chose on the last day of school
It's going to have oddballs witch is made by odd1sout much bigger than you he has 18 subs he's gonna get more now cuz his new show
DANNY WATCH THE MOVIE “Halloween night is grinch night” ITS SO BAD
bro's fart could be compared to Chernobyl
The movie is in the bucket of puke and gross
Bro the live action marmaduke was actually kind of funny.  Then this abomination came out.
Bro do y’all remember the OG marmadoke
seeing danny do the dance to petes song during the credits and then seeing my own name appear was nothing short of magical
Marmaduke, more like Marmadick
danny i WISDH YOU IDEFIRFjkm I WJAHJK WNAT OBRUN YIOU >:((((
at the end during the credits song when he says "I gotta eat" it reminds me of Kurtis's goblin video and it's just the funniest shit to me
Robotech rental was in the list of expenses so did they rent copies of the TV show Robotech or did they rent the actual titular Robotech devices
Watching this video caused me emotional pain from the movie. This has happened 4 times.
The only logical explanation for Jk Simmons and Pete Davison agreeing to this if their family were abducted, and they’d only get them back if they worked on this.
Bro the little boy riding marmaduke at the end like, bro just said “pony up daddy”
dude one time i had a sleepover at my cousins house and her little brother was watching this and when we were about to go out to walk her dog we stopped to watch and then he let out the gigantic fart and we were so disturbed and terrified. then we saw the pile of birds we started bursting into tears it was so scary
Bro why does Guy look and sound like William Afton WTF
The one redeeming quality is that we get a video with Danny in it
When I was at my grandmas in Poland I saw a trailer for it on the TV and it was called dog in size XXL and it’s going to be in the movie theatres
I don't wanna be on the internet anymore. I just saw polish ads for marmeduke coz im polish.
I remember watching and enjoying the original 2010 marmaduke as a kiddo
I love your videos
My dad said this was a good movie so every night I had  to say I want to watch it to be nice                                                                                                      I lied
fun fact: marmaduke had its own non animated movie in 2010 before this shitshow and even though I haven't watched it I can already tell its better in basically every single way possible
When I first saw that movie I thought it  was from 2001 lol bc someone was like " Kids movies no one will remember it
I'm having a fucking seizure right now
1:15 6:32 10:08 18:28 19:04 amen brother
Marmaduke pulled a Goat Story on us
WILD CONSPIRACY TIME: was the ending animation ripped from that shitty Titanic movie?? That scene where the dog randomly raps??  19:22
Rich and British 😂
I am convinced that most movies now a days no matter what studio consist of kidnapped people being forced at gunpoint to act
The best description I can give for the character design is that is screams illumination but like more extreme.
Netflix has become so bad that people are now questioning if it is on purpose lol
i just watched marmaduke.
Why is the thumbnail so goofy 💀
You have to watch asteroid, final Impact
I was thinking about getting Netflix but when I discovered that movies that are on my watchlist ain't there... Well I don't want Netflix that much anymore
Based on the footage I gathered, I believe the Dog Zeus is the God Zeus. I have two reasons for this.  1: It’s an animal that seems to have lustful thoughts.  2: EVERYONE wants to screw him.
My little sister actually watches movie 75 times it was the only other movie that she'd watch besides besides moana
Marmaduke in 2 words: Living Bio-weapon
God I hate this movie you don't know how much I wanted it to end with marmaduke unalive I would have been so happy if that was the actual ending.
Isn't the family still like 300,000 million dollars in dept still
LOL
i used to rent the original live action Marmaduke movie from my local library as a kid💀
knowing the most watched part is 19:53 just makes me wanna say yall need holy water but y'know what...
I’m really concerned that the message this children’s movie is supporting is to be violent to a misbehaving dog
ruh roh
I believe in this universe, dogs are god. Ain't no way that they all got that much power
Man my cousins love this movie 💀💀
this was a nightmare of a movie
the og marmaduke is a amazing movie
at 10:30 you can see one of the cheerleaders at the dog show
It’s bad that I enjoyed the move while you were describing it. Damn.
OMG 5:28 BURN THOSE 2 WITH HOLY FIRE!
just the graphics are good!
i watched this movie with my mother, and we both hated it SO much
Why did they have to make the movie look like a Lilly’s garden add
watch the original marmaduke, with owen wilson and emma stone... it's a whole 9% on rotten tomatoes, so a little bit of a set up
9:48 RobiiiWorld callback to the “I got to go” guy from “The Worst Viral Videos With Drew Gooden”!
Danny: I born on earth 😎 Me: I born in the sun 💀
I wouldn't be surprised if this movie had a negative budget, like the studio was paying netflix for making this movie lmao
Are we sure that dog trainer isn't a Principal in a Langly high school?
Honorable mention to Tall Girl and Tall Girl 2
so true
"please bOy, be oKay"
13:54 i was forced to sit through this by my 5 year old brother, so yes. kids have watched this god awful movie
10th time watching, no regret
Why did netflix make the mom look like every disney mom
Our teacher played 4his movie and we all agree it was stupid and didn't watch it But then one kid said "ANIMAL ABUSE" and everyone was cackling Great day.
I feel like someone has some compromising pictures of Pete
At this point I am convinced that the dog is a higher being or at the very least a weapon of war from the future
I didn't went too far into this but if the dogs actually dead can I please skin it
Danny you have to do a movie review on “The academy of magic”. It’s directors are Mehmet Tanrısever and Jorgen Klubien.
Wait till he finds out ab the live action one
this movie has the graphics of a bowling alley animation
I grew up with the Live Action version, sure that was a bad movie, but this seems insulting even to that
This is proof art can be objectively bad.
18:40 should've actually been how the movie ended
hey wasn't marmaduke originally live action. i remember it from my childhood marmaduke was played by owen wilson
The actual Marmaduke movie was actually good and a great kids movie with an actual story. However this animated version is a disaster, the art style is bad, the story is bad, the voiceover is bad, everything about this is bad.
What a very strange looking kid
"fAtHeR wHEn cAn I LeAVe On mY oWwWnN~~"
I S  M A R M A D U K E  D E A D
We watched this at school
marmaduke is just a 2016 movie in 2022
toward the end when they fake marmaduke's death they say that "marmaduke was a good dog" which completely goes against the fucking plot of the movie
I’m a fan, I’m here for my Tesla.  Seriously ur great man 😂 glad I found your content!!
I liked jungle beat and sea beast, definitely a must watch
hey this guy kinda looks like me
DOG FOOD 1.4 MILLION MY GUY WTF
guy kinda looks like danny
10:11 are u ok dog?
I had to watch this in 4th grade
you look like a dinsney character wait wait wait YOU LOOK LIKE A 3D MODLE 💀
A couple months ago I watch this movie and I stopped watching after 20 seconds
there's also a live action Marmaduke
HELP I NEARLY STARTED CRYING WHEN MARMADUKE NEARLY DIED TF
You should probably watch the original instead of this garbage
13:46 LOL THE DOG NEEDS TO JOIN SQUID GAMES
One of my friends is friends with the guy who voices Pinocchio lol
Write any lyrics in the replies and i will turn it into a song
6:22 *no.. guy would just snap his leg in half.*
2:46 BRO THE MOM LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE SLENDERS FROM ROBLOX
when i saw this first i was like ehh it cant be that bad OH BOY WAS I WROUNG BRO IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE DISNEY MINUS VIDEOS
OH NO HES ALIVE!! π∆π
“Believe in yourself.” Said the cat. “Believe I’m a champion?” Replied Marmaduke. *“No, Marmaduke, BELIEVE YOUR AN EVIL DOG AND KEEP REMEMBERING HOW YOU TORTURED AND KILLED THE ENTIRE HUMAN POPULATION.”* “So- anyway, come back, we miss you!”
my lil brother watches that 16 times a fucking day
1:19 that didn’t age well
Yo my teacher made us watch marmaduke and yeesh :(
How can you get a 0 on rotten tomatoes
And his Russian gf
seems like the kind of movie a crappy daycare would play 😭
So... This movie had to be a fetish thing, right? Like everything was just too much.
Netflix's movies are made so YouTube commentators can tear them up like eels eating shit-
I agree
Watch we met in virtual reality on hbo PLEASE
The live action Marmaduke was so much better it was released in 2010 and Marmaduke was voice acted by it Owen Wilson and that video it may have been bad in some ways but it's much better than this and I prefer it over this animated one
My mom walked past my phone while watching this and thought that Danny was a kid from my high school doing a small YouTube channel
omg apparently marmaduke is like a real movie. it was like a live action that came out years ago. and then they remade this one
.
PLEASE react to facebook's disgustingly long, 20-minute "prank" videos!!! lol
The live action Marmaduke, was actually watchable hell, even genuinely funny at times, but this is a trippy headache
Hi Danny I think you should watch The Academy of Magic (2020) animated movie! It's like Frozen but Harry Potter
10:12
this is something from disney minus
POV: they actually tried
Another good video from drew gooden
why does this look like a low budget youtube animation, poor simmons
1:18 aged well
Bro looks like a tooth pick like before traini g a dog he should train his bones like bro where are they? I dont see bones it looks like every step is breaking your leg
1:18 yeah about that…
The original Marmaduke will always be better.
this comment will probably get buried but does anyone else think that the poster of the dog trainer at 5:02 looks like Spamton from deltarune?
I want to punch the people in the face
Did you here about the movie on Netflix called “chickenhare and the hamster of darkness” I just saw it recently
This movie makes Surfs Up 2 look like Shrek 2
80:08:43   I’m honored to be apart of this program.
Notifications on💅
Honestly if you’re gonna make a shit movie at least make the visuals decent. This movie is almost as ugly as Hoodwinked
Danny: **Barks**  My dog: *WHOMS'T HATH SUMMONED ME*
I gotta be honest, I was doubtful when you said this was the worst movie; it couldn't be that bad right?   I was wrong.  I am uncomfortable. I want to vomit. This isn't even so-bad-its-funny. I want to die. Thanks Danny
My brother watched that shit...ON REPEAT. He also used to watch an alien show where ONE THREW UP POPCORN AND THOSE MFS STILL ATE IT 😐
lol in the intro it sounded like he said “hello grayyy” and it caught me off guard bc thats my name XD
How they gonna say Not So Great Dane when  POO-dle was right there for free? 😂
I liked that movie
I want marmaduke to die again
Yeah... the very old Netflix was better.
Okay, so I can't watch this channel anymore after hearing you say Pete Davidson is a funny guy. No. Just...No.
I think that there is a live action one yah I just check I’m so sorry there is
My sister watched this movie and I saw it during the first dog show scene. WHY.
Netflix is only just being bad cause a new series of giant mechs fighting monsters and it sucks
it’s like a dog version of garfield 😭😭
The characters have worse design than all those others in the Addams Family And that's saying something
Father when can I leave this trash movie hell
"Yes, let's take off The Office and Dark Crystal for this"
This looks like one of those brazillian disney ripoff movies
Imagine if the movie just ended when the family saw the bills that Guy gave them.
the fact that the animation in the credits is better than the actual movie animation-
That dog sounds like the narrator of those random science channels like bright side
i liked this movie
6:21 IT’S FUCKING CESAR MILLAN!
Netflix was probably just minding their own business when they saw some guy looking for an animation opportunity and just ended up making a mistake
og marmaduke bussin tho
I think we know that Marmaduke was originally a comic.
I cried when watching this movie, not because it was emotional because my eyes where bleeding at the terror I was forcing it to see.
The creators have a fart fetish for sure 💀 like the gurgling is so unsettling 😭
I wouldn't say that this is the worst movie in my opinion(plan bee takes that spot) you can actually see effort put in to it such as the story and animation while yes some parts are bad animation that just natural as their is no such thing as perfection (also in one shot it shows that Zeus has 2 people next him in the firsttime you see him WITCH ARE THE AGZACT SAME CHARACTER MODLE since you would think that one of them is the judge in discise while the other is at the award ceremony (is that the right word?)how ever since they are the exact same model it would be impossible to fit that much hair under a wig my reasoning to think its a wig  notice the thick ness of the hair its long and thin the judge's hair cut is thicker and not at the correct length to be in haircut that it is in also notice the certain change in hair color i also have reason to believe that the false judge  has a few more pounds than the other character model(no I am not fat shaming your body not mine) I suspect a fat suit is in use). While some parts are a terrible attempt at something comedic *cough cough nuke in the trophy cough cough* sorry had something caught in my throat you can still see effort (bonus ZUES IS ALMOST AS TALL AS A F#%^&=$ HUMAN US ANYONE ESLE DISTURBED BY THIS.) all of this i my own opinion if I have offended you in any way, shape or form I offer my apologies.(hail greg)
This seems like a low budget movie that’s just a ripoff of a recent successful movie but it’s not based off a recent movie and they somehow got Pete Davidson. This looks like a movie Ted nivison would make a video about.
Marmaduke like a shitty Scooby-Doo
This is just a fetish movie. It’s really strange how they got away with making this
“ I am here for my bones “
I feel like this is supposed to make us excited for a good movie
why the fuck was the credits better than the movie
I think Marmaduke talking is a Stewie situation where certain people can understand him and others can't
Did Danny really punch and break his wall
👸🏼🫣🫡🫥 ( queen ) * vanishes after watching this *
POV : your rich and British watching this
I watched this movie and I commented on Kurtis video and I'm so happy that danny did this because this movie sucks
Is it Gei, Gui, or just Guy?
this movie is rilising in poland in 2022
why does guy look like kurtis conner
The dog show was so unfair.. The shitzu dog, who only dances and fights with his owner, won instead of the bulldog who lifted the entire arena...
I remember once seeing an ad for this movie in cinemas, the plot seemed, fine? BUT HOLY SHIT, THE DESIGN OF THE MOM MADE ME WANT TO THROW UP. HER BUTT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ON THE LEFT, AND THE DESIGN OF E V E R Y T H I N G IN THIS MOVIE JUST LOOKED HORENDOUS. They also decided to use the farting joke in the trailer, and OH GOD, it made me lose all hope that the movie could be somewhat good (not that i had ANY hope to beggin with)    I wish everybody who went to watch this movie, having hope in it, a great life, because im SURE that their body was filled with dissapointment.
Marmaduke is not a bad movie
Way to encourage bad dog-parenting, Netflix. Dog obedience school isn't a punishment, it's basic education and socialising for both dog and owner.
The live action was better
i rember that iwas going to watch it and bored and left but when i came back it ended
I watched this with my little cousin and they were laughing
Aaahhhhh it worked!!   54 year old finally found out how to subscribe...like...and TURN ON notifications...I AM TRULY GREG
I just cancelled netflix last week. 99% of movies just suck nowadays. The 90's will forever be the rennaisance of movies.
I taught a few summer camps a couple weeks ago. We watched marmaduke on the projector during part of our lunches and I believe it was the worst movie I have ever seen.
Pete Davidson is no longer dating a Kardashian. I think Danny caused the breakup
I saw this on Netflix when I was scrolling down for a good movie me and my sis saw this gave each other odd glances and said no
They do it so YouTubers review it that then will cause people to watch it causing them to trash it then everyone watched
no but my teacher put this on one day and just left the fucking room. good thing i left before the movie got worse
They need to stop making old stuff into new stuff that's all some old stuff I would like to see but not like this
That part where he says "it's dukein time"  Then dukes on everyone is a truly wonderful experience
That bulldog had minimum leverage too
The characters in this film look exactly like the gross designs from that Addams Family film that came out 2-3 years ago, that cheerleader girl even looks like that movie's popular mean girl. At least the designs for the main characters in that film looked fine, (really they just looked like their original adaptations), but the background characters in that film and the human characters in this movie look horrible. Who designed these? Why are they making all these weird character designs? Are they just free models they got off of a website or something? Regardless, I seriously pity the animators that had to animate their faces, that can't be good for your mental health.
this movie will never compare to the original marmaduke. the fart stuff did make me laugh though.
“It is the worse movie you’ll see this year” you think imma watch that bull shit?
They can produce a crappy movie every week and it took them three years to film stranger things 💀💀
I feel like someone heard the comment "you could put a saddle on that thing", built a movie around a kid riding his great dane and put 0 other thought into it
As a great Dane owner, this is so stupid. I feel like they just wanted like "big dog" and that one "not so great" joke but...great danes are like NOTORIOUSLY mellow. I will say, though, Pete Davidson would be a fair choice for an actual great dane's personality
i had to watch marmaduke at my cousins cuz i didnt wanna be mean so i just watched. why were ppls hair floating tho in the movie
well if marmaduke went to china swam to some place and got to egipt in ONE DAY he is really fast or has a lot of stamina
it's a comic strip dog from the 1950s ffs (strong _FoodFight!_ vibes)
toe foot,
the character models kinda look like the adams family amimated movie
Okay, another YouTuber Kennie JD half-jokingly mentioned that these awful movies must be a money laundering scheme and I cannot stop thinking about that.
mane what is that animation 💀💀
he just randomlypunched the wall in the middle of talking and it almost broke dang are his walls made mof paper or are his fists made of steel?
12:08 I got an ad right at 12:12 and I have to say, that this may be the absolute peak of modern internet humor.
as a Martian born 50 000 bc I also hate these characters
whats crazy to me is how much content is on netflix and thing seems worthy and also the amount of foreign content. there should be a separate netflix for all the bollywood shit
Yooooo it’s Danny Gonzalez, the internet’s most notorious ripoff of Diggy Gorgonzola
I laughed the whole video.
This movie is so frustrating that I can't even finish THIS video.  Tapping out at 7:44
this is so dogshit compared to the live action movie, idk i havent seen it since i was young but i remember loving it so much
or the guy is such a dog expert to the point where he can actually understand what the dog is saying, and therefor he can communicate with MARMADUKE!!!!! big fan btww:)
Now I know why my dog is so skinny despite how much he eats. He just farts after every meal!
It’s literally a bad cartoon copy of an actual good movie
Them Netflix movies is always heat. Put some respect on they name
0:01
This is same thumbnail as saberspark's
I remember when marmaduke was a 2010 banger and not this catastrophe of an animated film
FATHER, WHEN CAN I LEAVE TO BE ON MY O    W    N   . . . ?
6:08 for future reference, the expression is “putting your dukes up” not “putting your deuces up”
i find it funny how marmaduke gets kicked so hard in the air that he went flying into a tree and bounced off of every crevice inside there and then was tortured by medieval slaughter devices but when something heavy falls on him he shatters into pieces and dies
Ok I keep coming back to this video 1 cuz I like it but 2 I cannot stop thinking about this what is going on with Danny’s face in the thumbnail it’s clearly doctored and it’s fucking with my head can anyone else see it /gen
You think zero children watched this movie? My cousin from Germany  watched this movie while I was on a painful 8 HOUR DRIVE to Berlin while on trip.
Marmaduke is not that bad. But not that good
i had to reverse the vid like 5 times to make sure he didnt actually punch a hole in the wall
I’m now watching the first 5 minutes off marmaduke and I am very scared…….YUP IM WATCHING A DIFFRENT MOVIE
Ngl, I think the credits with the rapping would have been so hilarious if they played it in the ending where Marmaduke just died
Every movie company does this, the tax write offs far out way the actual costs.
I paused it and apparently they had to pay 1 million dollars for dog food lmao
Ireland hasnt forgotten
bro theres already a live action version of this movie that's like a million times better 💀
Isn’t Marmaduke a comic series in the newspaper 😭
I just put on the movie for my sister to watch and ran
I don't know if anyone will know what I'm talking about but the model for the shark that they used when Marmaduke is traveling the world is the same one from the terrible movie The Reef and I felt that I had to point it out
Netfflix increased the prices just because of this
4:14 i know you said tidal wave but i did not expect that. i am sobbinv.
Danny skipped over this in the review , but this movie has some of the weirdest stereotypes. Like the all the bullies are black. And when you watch the dog trainers are terrible stereotypes too, like the single Japanese woman is wearing traditional wear in like the worst way possible, the pattern and the color are hideous. It’s weird. -0/20, fucking hate this  movie and hate I had to watch with my little brothers…
Please watch the outcasts it’s on netflix it’s so bad 😭😭
My cousin's watched this at least ten times while they were here 🤣 and I was like "Why tho"
when he does the sponsoring thing are we giving him a.......
My sister was watching this right before the video came out, and I immediately thought "Danny needs to see this"
I hate Marmaduke.
"Father🥰when😆can😒i😝leave😜to🤪be👹on👺my💅❤OWNNUH ❤💅 i've 😘got😉the😋whole😏 ✨✨WORLDUSSY✨✨"  -pinochio (2022)
The animation looks like something I'd see on adult swim
Am i the only one who waited for danny to move out of his chair right after the scene where he punched a hole in his wall to see if he actually punched a hole in his wall or if it was edited
It would’ve been much better if Marmaduke was a crime show and guy beats him up until he dies
Not to mention That Zeus has the same sound effect as the titan shifters from attack on titan
Why does guy look like a tumblr sexyman
5:14 I'm mean Danny is not wrong look at The Bad Guy the villain is the most famous British actor on animation movie Richard Ayoade
During the tsunami scene i want all of you to look at the small kid with the bucket hat. Look at the legs and the movement they do. That's pure art.
theres no plot, CARLOS IS FOR SOME REASON WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT INSTEAD OF MEXICAN, it doesnt match the original movie, the fart scenes were straight uncalled for, and what the fuck
That animation feels like a 6th grader tried to do an animation movie for a project and rushed it all in one night
this whole movie is a balan wonderworld cutscene
this was definitely the movie ever
"Are you trying to bankrupt your family, Marmaduke?"
bit of a longshot as this video is pretty old but does anyone know where I could find the carhartt tshirt danny is wearing in this
Bruh.
This movie seems to have retconned every growth in the animation industry. I know the movie is bad but I can’t get over the lackluster animation.
19:12 dude the girl in the purple dress is even thicker than the mom holy smokes
You should try BIGFOOT on Netflix it’s pure propaganda about getting rid of oil companies in a time when oil prices are about 200$ a tank. yes it was made in 2022
7:20 heart Easter egg
At 7 minutes I have heard the guy who is beating a dog is not the bad guy??  Omg its a cartoon fetish vid
What's weird is that everyone knows that Pete Davidson isn't struggling for money. he's pretty damn rich and even if he wasnt, he was dating a Kardashian at the time, so you know he didn't take the role for money. So, *why did he?*
There is a movie called marmaduke and it is a live action one that i love. This is bad and stolen    Edit: (look it up bro) 💀💀
To answer your question Danny, Marmaduke is just like the stewie of the movie, nobody knows who can understand him or not, and I definately didn't just write this entire comment because I wanted to mention family guy 1 time
We watched this movie in school most of the class was laughing. But I guess a room full of 13/14 year olds wouldn't have the best sense of humor. The only reason I enjoyed the Movie is because of how stupid it was
I just said WHAT THE- and started crying-
i used to love the live action marmaduke when i was younger 😢😢😢😢
At some point someone wanted me to watch the movie saying it was'' really funny'' glad I never watched it
look how they have massacred my boy marmaduke over the years
scooby doo on sarods
1:18 didnt age so well
Tbh I never watched Marmaduke because the characters looked hella cursed. *Definitely not watching it now, if it has a 0% Tomatometer.*
Marmaduke more like Marmaduce
This movie is so bad that it makes watching paint dry look like the most entertaining thing in existence
so we not gonna talk about how he looks like guy
My class watched it and loved it
They need more interactives battle kitty is the most trash one in the world like bro you only watch vids no decisions
I wil wach the movie
When I first saw this movie I thought it was made in the early 2000s since the animation was so…. Bad   Then I saw it was made in 2022
Why is nobody talking about how Zeus is voiced by JK FUCKING SIMMONS WHAT THE HELL
This movies will soon be in cinemas in my country!
You mentioned all the ugly character models of the ppl but not the scary model that they tried to make look like a dog
This is just an ad for Marmaduke
Marmaduke is literally the pink sauce of movies.
My brain hurts
The mom has a nice.......
I used to love the live action Marmaduke as a kid... they ruined it lol
The writer’s thinly disguised fetish
What if, The guy just wanted money from the poor family. Probably he does this for living, scaming people by beating there dogs LOL
Everytime I've seen people talk about this movie my brain jumps to the live action Marmaduke film from when I was a kid.
Know what? I think this movie is - little unrealistic!
I tried to watch this movie thinking it would be like the non animated one which we own but it was not and I could not stand it
I watched it and it sucks
I can't get past the design of the fucking mom wtf
Great video, Drew, one of your best yet.
Watched it with my nephew and I did not hold back on my criticism commentary
Syfy was number 1 at making terrible movies, but now netflix has taken the lead.
You were more funny than the movie
Pete is trying to hide this movie.
The Willoughby's on Netflix may look garbage but it is really good in my opinion. If you have time then watch it if you could.
The 2D animation actually looks good. Why couldn't the movie look like this.
Ok but the original marmaduke movie slaps
yes
the animation looks like someone payed $10 on fiverr for it
So it's more Pokemon than anything related to dogs
Danny: And now it’s time to talk about our sponsor Me: It’s gonna be Express VPN  Danny: Express VPN Me: I KNEW IT
Pugs voice sound like inosuke from demon slayer the English version
I like how the title isn't even a question - it's more of a definite.
We were forced to watch it in algebra class in 6th grade last year and we begged for it to stop but our teacher forced us to watch it
I watched the movie and I agree the movie sucks
You look like the girl from the bing bang
This makes the owen wilson film look good.
Rumor has it, Kim dumped Pete Davidson over Marmaduke.
I watched the movie and I can say I purchased a grave.
My cousin was watching this and I was flabbergasted to see this monster of a design for a dog voiced by Pete Davidson be the dumbest being of all time.
The dog literally just killed off like 35 species of birds and his punishment is being called the not so Great Dane
2:46 why is the dad hard?
Between Danny acting like a dog and the sponsorship being done from under the table, this is objectively the sexiest Danny Gonzalez video.
I swear to god the animation in this movie reminds me of me of fanboy and chum chum. Were it's just so ugly it makes you laugh.
I went for curiosity. And I liked the show Danny. I can't believe that fight :) I know that the dog is bad but still ! They went too far ??
putting their "deuces" up? im pretty sure it's putting their "dukes" up... their marmadukes lmao
I feel like Pete told his agent - “I’m dating a single mom and I gotta do something to make her kids like me  - are there any kids movies I can do?”
Believe it or not. This is my friend's baby brother's favorite movie!
This isn't a movie. This is what you see in overdose of substances combined with Marmaduke s farts.
10:14
Bro I’ve watched this like 6 times already don’t know why it is so rewatch able but it is. Good video
greg needs you
can you go on tour please soon
this whole movie screams weird fetishes
The real movie is better
This movie looks like it was made in like 2001
The TTS that explains netflix movies that are ass (most commonly live action ones) are *more entertaining than the actual movie itself*
Why is Pete Davison?
I actually have laughed way too hard at my dog pooping in the wrong place.  We had moved to a new house and, long story short, she seemed to be acting out there for awhile.  She was 8 years old, generally well trained, and had never done anything like this in all those years.  Anyway, it slowly escalated over a span of a few months.  But right before the worst of it... we came home one day and she had shredded an entire box of kleenex all over the living room rug.  Then took a dump right in the middle of it all.  It was just such an explicit "f**k you" kind of thing.
We spend more times scrolling for movies on Netflix than actually watching them
Why are they making bad movies on purpose? You ever seen the movie The Producers? A lot of times people will make bad films so they can be used as tax write-offs. Of course, to ensure the movie tanks so it can written up as a loss, they will make it purposely unwatchable. It's actually ingenious if you think about it.
I like how everyone talking about this movie bring up the same points, like “Yeah, everyone sees that this movie is terrible and makes no sense.”
My cuz is 8 and absolutely loves this movie
the fact that i never watched this movie makes me so grateful that i get to live another day without the shame weighing down on me like a pile of boulders on my back
Eerily slim comes with Minecraft cave noise.
Yeah we’re was there youngest she was in the first movie
Well if ya saw that hate watching is a thing uh... yeah :I
Pretty sure this was made to launder money.
Godamn the mommy got thighs
This was literally the funniest fricken video I've ever seen
Yes, it's probably a tax scam, or tax shelter kinda thing🤷‍♂️
He looks like the kid from spy’s in disguise
pete sounds like he’s being held captive
I post funny videos 😆
Because they don't want to put in any effort and can use any number of diversity hires as shields from criticism? I mean, that's not just Netflix, but that's my guess anyway.
Oh yeah marmaduke on Netflix I watched it and the animation was so trash and terrible
“I’m dating a Kardashian, man.” Aged badly
why does this look like food fight, that horrible movie lol
yes
Im all about more shapely character designs, it gives the character an interesting and recognizable look  it adds so much to the character and its nice to see a design that isn't the exact same cookie cutter frame, but this just makes me sad.  They took the worst out of all shape theory and put it into these designs. There is a fine line between unique and impractical that this movie doesn't even bother to see if its crossed.   And don't even get me started on the colors, the actual movies colors are okay at best, if I were watching this as a kid Itd be tolerable, but holy shit the credits. They took the bright most obnoxious colors and paired them with muted greys and browns. In short ass shit poopy dog poopy movie.
I'm literally 3 minutes into this video and (as horrible as this sounds) this feels like a feature length film version of the Grub Hub commercial.
Maybe if the movie was 2d it would be 10000x better the animated look doesn't even look good it's disgusting
They were showing trailers of this movie in polish cinemas
when mramardujke died and came back life I CRIED,so -hard :sob😭:sob.
that food went to the the backrooms and came right back
Danny…I like your videos, but why do you cuss so much? I don’t think it is necessary to get your point across.  Just random f-bombs don’t make the videos better
I'll never forgive Netflix for canceling the critically acclaimed Dark Crystal series. It's a legitimate work of art but they'd rather spend a fortune on garbage.
dear god the animation looks like a bootleg
As a dog trainer actively competing in shows, this is EXACTLY what shows are like.
I could watch Danny videos like this all day!
6:00 this was ripped from The Secret Life of Pets 1
My teacher made me watch for an assignment on voice acting wtf 😬
The relationship between Netflix content quality and their monthly subscription price is similar to the relationship between the Hindenburg altitude and 'the humanity'.
i died laughing when you said the dog died it would have been so much funnier if he just dies
3 weeks and that kim k joke has aged well
I can't believe that during the dog show, Marmaduke said, "It's Marm'in time" and Marbed all over the place
I swear Marmaduke was an early 2000s live action film
Okay so they can cancel I Am Not Okay With This and First Kill but they make this trash? Cool.
The fact that they're ripping off a real movie that I have called Marmaduke is hilarious because the one I have is amazing like it's a family movie I think it's amazing but I also like those stupid almost kid like movies I feel like the Marmaduke in what Danny's watching is completely different than the one I have like the dog is completely different
It looks like a cheap fan film from YouTube 😅
What if rich British Guy has a gift to speak to dogs and that's why he's a famous dog trainer
the character design bro
2:18  My reaction to that information: 💀
Oh my god no. They ruined Marmaduke. It was a 2010 film that focused on a goofy Great Dane. They’ve fucked him. They did him dirty.
I feel like the only reason people have a netflix subscription is because of Breaking Bad
"This world is spinning in reverse, I must have slipped into the nega-verse."  Maybe Miss FD was just a decade early?
10:10 why the hell did I laugh so hard I have the brain of a child
I see this and think of fanboy and chum chum (but worse)
Squid game:)
My favorite part of this movie was when Marmaduke said “it’s Marmin’ time!” and Marmed all over everyone.
Your face looks like selene delgado
did anyone else notice that the dog does have a pp...? in the scene when marmaduke is sitting on the dad for the chair, you can clearly see the area where the pp is supposed to be...it is just not there...
One of the audience reviews of the movie "Marmaduke" was...  "This movie gave me a tingling feeling that only my uncle can give me." WTF...
A negative 6/10 is too generous
The blond dog gives me vibes of the guy in the room who says I did not hit her
wait till he hears they are making a live action marmaduke
"I'm dating a Kardashian"  That didn't age well😬
movie ain't that bad
Why does the mom look weird
8:55 marmaduke ate too much taco bell
this vid was so funny I was dying the whole time lol
Older Marmaduke was better
Me: Mom can we get Guy Sensei?  Mom: We got Guy Sensei at home.  Guy Sensei at home:
Its not that bad bruh, plus, its a kid movie.
My little sis watched this and somehow she loved it!?
"father when can i leave to be on my own 😩😩"
i saw the original marmaduke and this has just ruined me. Its literally been 15yrs,and i hate it
After being high for so long they've lost their sanity and just approved all sorts of projects even after seeing it finished.
Bro I am pretty sure that they broke up yesterday * Kim and Pete *
why does Danny have so much beef with Pete Davidson
Funny how this video is dated now that Pete and Kim broke up (considering their relationship was referenced in this video).
Apparently there's a live action 2010 version of Marmaduke. Would be pretty cool if we got a reaction of that one too.
You should talk about marvel making shit, milking it and focusing more on diveRsItY instead of a good story
This movie is giving me Adams family vibes the voice acting the people the voice acting the everything other than the color at least it’s colorful not grey tan super light blue red green and super dark purple and black
12:07 literally just the movie Hereditary
At least Netflix has Stranger Things and Peaky Blinders
I can tell they put no effort into this movie purely by not thinking of calling Marmaduke a 'Lame Dane'
Marmaduke is a liva action too
I have watched Maraduke before my dad and I thought that it was a cute movie!! I love dogs so much that I watched EVERY DOG SHOW AND HORSE SHOW ON NETFLIX!! Yes I love dogs and horses so much!
One of the main problems with the animation of this movie is that it is clearly more suited to 2D than CG. You can’t just animate anything in CG because the fact that it is 3D inherently chips away at the suspension of disbelief and gets closer to the uncanny valley. Characters with super exaggerated proportions just look weird in CG. It’s like how Fairly Odd Parents characters just didn’t look right when animated in CG for the Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour. I mean just look at how much better the designs of the end credits 2D animations look.
some people do make bad movies purely for money. Uwe Boll is said to exploit a German tax law that let's him make a shit ton of money no matter how bad the movie is. Uwe Boll also challenged his critics to a boxing match and boxed the late Rich "Lowtax" Kyanka of SomethingAwful fame. you can see footage of it on YT still!
My younger brother watched this movie so many freaking times (he’s 3 yrs old) And every time he played it I slowly died inside.💀 Like out of all movies, he picked this one. I suffered hours each day watching this over,over and over again. 💀
This is the one time a live action version of the film is better than the animated version. There’s already been a live action marmaduke.
Im a kid and i watched the whole movie with my little brother
Deuces are what lames cop instead of fighting. Dukes are what you put up to fight.
Netlix is making bad movies and you are making bad videos like this one...come back when you reach puberty
Scooby doo is always been better
Netflix really needs to step up their game, they either bring in old movies from the 2000s or make crappy children animation babba booey bullshit
nice
This movie is the reason Kim broke up with Skeet!
danny kinda looks like the dad
Imagine the dad seeing a literal nuke explosion and his first thought is "It was the damn dog" Edit: I'm shocked Danny didn't notice how shit the animation in this movie is.
is this real movie
This movie is so bad I can't finish the video
2010 Marmaduke is WAYY better man WHT you watching the shifty one
ngl it gives racism
8:28 THEY ARE ZOOPHILES, *WHY!!!*
Marmaduke is also a live action movie and a book series
The og Marmaduke is bomb
Animation is giving ratattoing
The Bulldog should one one
I am 10 and I watch this movie like a month before you you reacted to it is a very real movie also the end like what
putting their *dueces* up  ...like a pair of 2's?
7:48 I think i can see his ear clip through the window too....BAD ANIMATION
Bruh that rich guy is built like spamton
So we all know this is just a weird fetish movie right?
Tbh i avoided watching ur vid till now just cause the movie in art alone looks like a terrible movie. Love u danny ur one of my fave people on the platform but this movie is so ugly
I was dieing of laughter
There was an OLD Marmaduke is was good though but this is horrendous
1986, the Chernobyl Powerplant meltdown happens The dad: "GOD FUCKING DAMNIT, THAT GOD DAMN DOG DETONATED A WHOLE ASS NUCLEAR REACTOR!"
It’s giving word world✨💀
Marmaduke is actually an older movie, that they've just remade
Honestly i’ve seen so many netflix movies i can almost 70% tell how bad it is by just the title and around 99% of the time i can tell correctly by the cover of the movie
i just really wanna know if this is a kids favorite movie 😭😭😭
I thought that The Ice Age of Adventures of Buck Wild was the worst animated movie of 2022. Boy was I wrong...🤢
I'm surprised that people aren't talking about how this was actually a live action movie before it was a cartoon. It wasn't the most popular, but it was around. It was like a less emotional comedy oriented version of marley and me. And yes, for some reason he talks there too. Kind of like a thing for the audience to keep up.
One of my teachers in college was a producer on this movie. This was in development since like late 2018
i like the original movie
bro ur commentary so funny in this
18:22 Ruh Roh!
This video is peak Danny Gonzalez
I just (regrettably) watched the whole movie with my friends and can confirm it deserves the 0% Tomatometer score. We laughed the entire time about how bad it was 😂
At.      B.   B. B.       B
Y b y Bb.
i will not let this movie take the name of the live action 2010 Marmaduke movie, that one will forever be superior
Really sucks that we get stuff like this instead of more good stuff like s2 of the dragon prince
Thanks to the author, great video.
NO PLEASE I JUST WATCHED MARMADUKE AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW YOU NEEDED TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT IT
yo theres some info about your wife on white page its kinda personal you may wanna take it down love you daddy
bro why does marmaduke look have the same animation as whats up
I just came back to inform everyone I had a nightmare that Netflix made a second Marmaduke movie and I couldn’t turn it off.
very good i like thats
I hate that Netflix increased their prices to bring us “amazing content” and this is the content they’ve given to the world
12:22 I like how he punches really politely and the wall just cracks up like crazy
I laughed out loud multiple times, this video is the definition of LOL. 😭
My favourite moments in the video  0:00 to 21:41
My teachers sons watched this-
oh the thumbnail? i watched that movie already, yeah, i didnt know what this was in the first place, the dog and the man in the thumbnail
Guy is a dog whisperer
disney minus is better than this
Have you ever seen chickenhare? It’s crap you gotta react to that.
.
i’m sad that marmaduke didn’t die
It doesn't even show this movie in the list of the movies he's in 💀
80% of the backgrounds in this movie look like stock images.
this genuinely sounds like a copy of penguinz0's video
bro that movie looks like that old mickey mouse series. i forgot the name, but it looks like it was animated in the early early 2000s lmaoooo. i cannot believe danny watched that movie without giving up
I just watched the movie and I can tell you it is shit like actual dog shit
I’m not greg? Who is greg ??
i think if you watch this ironically thats the only way to enjoy it
Netflix hired the russian animators that pump out all that stupid shit for 'kids' on youtube
10:05 says it all
danny you need to watch the last days of disco
i was at the cinema a week ago, that's when i first saw them advertising this. it was horrifying
I greg
If Guy was French he would actually be the bad guy.
Ngl When I watched Marmaduke, it was so bad that I actually started to cry
My little brother watched this movie, and my reaction to the humans was “ewe ewe! What in the…? What’s with they’re legs!?! 🤢”.
i can’t believe they got rid of coraline for movies like this
7:49 his ear is literally sticking out of the curtain
The whole movie could have at least not lit your eyes on fire if they used the 2D style they used in the credits.
this movie is bad for the eyes to look at
Will the Greg shirts be restocked?
2:17 scared
its a shame that this animated mess came from a actully good movie. They took the origanal Marmaduke movie and decided to animate it and change the story, and they made garbage. even my 6 yro brother hated it and he liked the origanal movie.   Hecc you netflix u ruinend Marmuduke
My guy became nazi Germany gassing
bro I watched it to and I agree with you
Alternate Ending:  Zeus ends up winning the competition and gloats to all the other dogs that he is the best dog in the world and the rest of them suck balls, something like that(this is without the rigging).  Marmaduke feels bad that he lost, thinking that he failed his owners. But his family comes up to him and says that winning doesn't matter, and they love him for who he is. Then the film cuts 1 year later the movie shows that Marmaduke is the still the same misbehaving dog but the family seems to have accepted that this is just who he is. Then the credits roll set to an edited version of Pups by A$AP Ferg.
It was a bad decision to eat while watching this.
You made this movie sound pretty funny to watch tho lol I laughed ngl
0:27 NOOOOOOOO THEY DID MARMADUKE DIRTYYYYYYY😭😭
this the type of shit that you see when visiting your young cousins house
This is based off a comic strip that got a film 12 years ago
Maybe it's because I have the sense of humor of an 8 year old boy but that woman shouting "our dog is a loser!" actually really got me
Owen Wilson is the OG and wayyyyy better
iwoththatolthetim
why is the ad segment one of the most replayed
hypnosis *DOES* exist and it *IS*  effective for certain people =/
This is a shame. The original Marmaduke comic is better at being Family Circus than Family Circus is.
looks like a boss bady movie
this animation is horrific. it's just goat story animation but...dogs
Excuse me what. All these movies look shit😭
why do you look like baldi in the thumbnail
🤩
Nah bro what are you on Marmaduke is the best movie he's so strong and cool that he solos Goku
I watched Marmaduke and tried to round it up and be nice but I couldn't even give it 0
Now we have rise of the TMNT hope it goes well
Man, them writers were into some fucked up stuff.
Everytime i watch this video there is a bounty add but I dont think it could clean up that horrible movie
The more I see of this movie, the more I think it's actually surrealist horror
4:53 “he is my biggest fan”
Gmod vibes
We it’s the feminist
The characters in this movie somehow over exaggerate over exaggeration
Ya’know, who the hell is Greg anyways?
The only good thing Pete Davidson has been in was The Suicide Squad, and that was only because we got to see his face explode.
This might be a horrible movie but Danny makes it sound like the funniest thing in existence
Right when I clicked on the movie I had to click off it cuz it looked sooo bad
The animation style of this “movie” is shocking
bruh i look exactly like danny but younger
Guy looks like Tom Holland.
the only redeeming factor is the mom
Marmaduke was actually a live action
I can't believe I liked the movie
You can thank the Obama Entourage for all the fine programming currently on Netflix.   Cancel Netflix and get HBO or Paramount
every movie that Danny reacts to with Pete Davidson, Pete's never interested in his role in a correct answer. Im sorry for u Pete.
IVE GOT THE WHOLE ✨WORLDUSSY✨
Idk why I found this so funny I literally cried laughing like not figuratively literally
I like how at 4:45 Danny stops midway through his sentence to correct himself.
I usally try to say something about about any movie but this i cant
my 5 year old brother watched 20 minutes of it and then refused to watch it. he then instead watched a garfield movie for the 50th time
PLEASE, WATCH YOUR LANGUANGE, KIDS ARE WATCHING, THANK YOU!
I don’t like how he looked at me when he started talking about the sponsors
Ummm zap is one of the best movies ever
Ten dollars was used to animate this.
I think this movie was meant for commentary not to be a movie because this is not even possible to make a movie so weird oh wait it is
the characters look like despicable me characters lowkey
:)
In my opinion, even the designs and the lighting is just horrible to.
Danny gonzales
Making bad movies is easier then making good movies. People watch them anyways, and Netflix still makes money.
Like 52% of the movie is just the dog making weird noises and just really disturbing
I just want to break the characters' limbs they look so breakable
I love marmduk he is God I would do anything for marmduk I love marmduk he is amazing I would destroy the universe for marmduk ☻️☻️☻️☻️☻️☻️☻️☻️☻️🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶😱😱😱😱😱🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🦫🦫🦫🦫🦫🦫🦫👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿☻️☻️☻️☻️☻️🐧🍋🍋🍋🍋🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🧸🦽🦽🦽🦽🦽🪂🪂🪂🪂🪂🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌝🌝🌝🌝🌝🌝🌝🌝🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕🌖🌗🌘🌚🌛🌜🌝🌞🪐🪐🪐🪐🪐🌪🌪🌪🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬
man makes me want to drink bleach and vodka
I’m pretty sure this movie is like a money laundering scheme or something
The original live action marmaduke was actually ok and enjoyable but this is just bad
the dad joke at 4:42 😭
I hate Marmadukes triangular, anatomically disturbing, gravity defining jowls, they make me wanna kill myself
18:37 the boys hair is very clearly clipping through his hat lol, clearly a lot of time and attention went into the animation
11:32 pay attention to this girl how far fak is she standing
I watched this movie multiple times for the moms thick thighs only
Why should the artist movie it really sucks and some of them have skinny skin
My little brother was half way and then I heard him cry over this Like what
“He kicks the dog” “Great Taste”
I haven’t seen the marmaduke Netflix remake, but the original was good
This vid got me screaming lol 😂
"look at his nose to arm ratio."                              -Danny Gonzales
19:51 Danny has you tied in a chest while he tells you about todays sponsor POV
Marmaduke as a character originated from a classic ‘Sunday Funny’ comic strip a la Family Circle, and is genuinely funny. Absolutely fucking did not need to be a movie.
5:18 whys his chair look like it jump cut but danny himself didnt
Paws of fury is better than this garbage 0_0
Guy is teaching the dog how to play catch.   Or at least, how to catch these hands.
Marmaduke to me seemed like the Foodfight of Netflix due to how horrible the animation was but at least it made for a great Danny Gonzalez video
These characters Anatomy does not make sense.
Netflix redeemed themselves with “The Sea Beast”
Is Danny secretly paying Netflix to make bad movies? A business deal so they can both profit 🤔🤔🤔
this is hardly the least believeable thing in the movie but at 4:13 how did that pool contain so much water that you see in th next shot? is the just a portal to the pacific ocean at the bottom of that inflatable pool?
The dog going fat probably awakened someone's fetish.
They put more budget into the end credits than the entire movie itself
What’s worse is that they decided to take off 4 seasons of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic-  THEY EVEN GOT RID OF LOLIROCK  NETFLIX IS ROBBING ME OF MY CHILDHOOD-
My daughter and I started watching Marmaduke.  We made it through about 10 minutes and turned it off.
Why the heck is dog food over 1000000 dollars?
Even though Netflix has some questionable content on their platform, there have been some legendary movies in my opinion such as "The Mitchells and the Machines" for example, "Hustle", or "The Man from Toronto"
id rather watch the ads netflix are gonna put than this movie
this did fhe original maramaduke so dirty bro
Incorrect Pete Davidson is awful at everything he does
stop calling me greg
Bro that’s fax this movie was so boring I forgot it was on
this movie feels like those youtube kids animations that are for kids but make zero sense
The whole reason that the marmaduke comics are funny is that the jokes are short, simple, and witty. This is the opposite of that. That's why most comedies based on funny comic strips are kind of bad(SOME are good, but far from all). The jokes in those strips are specifically made for a short, 3 or 4 (or in marmadukes case, one) panel presentation, and they're good BECAUSE they deliver a nice laugh with only a few sentences. Thats why they flop when you try to draw them out for a whole movie. It's like trying to make a movie out of a knock knock joke or pun.
Yeah
Marmaduke reminds me of my dog!
dawg marmaduke was a newspaper cartoon wasn’t it?
This is why they're losing subscribers 🤦‍♀️
Shit man I wonder why they would make a bad movie on purpose when 70% of Gen Z has a bad movie review channel and half of Youtube is reaction videos to bad movies, damn, it's like ironic purchases cost the same as legit ones, fuck me.
did you really punch your wall!!
Guy had a justin chad moment
LMAO
i watched this in art class half asleep and thought it wasnt that bad but watching this wide awake i now realize this movie is genuinely so bad like what was going through the writers mind
Also about the language problem I think both can understand the others language
13:21 the netflix financial department be like
L L L ratio
You gotta watch the og marmaduke movie
Danny, this was hilarious 😂😂
Why do they keep adapting mundane comic strips about animals into wacky action filled comedies? You think little kids really care about the Marmaduke franchise? They've probably never even heard of him
Broke: Guy is such a good dog trainer he can understand dogs  Woke: Marmaduke only speaks British English so none of the Americans at the party could understand
no this movie is actually very deep, you just don't get it. it is really surprising how much i can relate to the dog and also the movie. they are both a loser and a financial burden. i think this is the best movie personally. 10/-10
i used to read marmaduke in the sunday newspaper
yo Scott Kramer already did this video and title
I love how this movie is now being promoted in my country. Naaaah, not gonna watch it
this movie is fucked up,  the most fucked moment is the farting one oh god
I loved marmaduke so I think I love dogs too much
I found a meme that a ad timed perfect here’s is the clip 11:57
Dogs should be treated as God's if they can run around the world in seconds, lift an entire convention centre, create magic bubbles and hypnotise people
WERE QUESTION MARK!?!?!?!??!!?😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬
suprised how he didnt mention that Guy Hilton was almost oofed in the world dog competition  well thats a Positive one for Danny not to mention it
I like watched it till half way and went because of how bad it is.
Not My Marmaduke. The 2010 film is the only one I acknowledge.
my dogs name is zeus. he was watching with me. every time his name is mentioned by danny or the movie he begins barking at the screen and idk why
I feel like Netflix just make these movies to fill up dead space. Also this is a copy of a live action movie
They couldn’t even make backgrounds they’re pre rendered 😑💀💀💀
Children have watched this movie, since I was at school near the end of school, so it was a movie day. You want to know what the teacher played? Obviously Marmaduke.
i was waiting for u to bring up the og marmaduke 😔
Please watch Monster Family 2 next!!!
Turning an evil animal into a good animal for personal gain…where have I seen that before… Oh yeah! The bad guys movie!
Was... was this movie referencing the rapping dog from the animated Titanic movie?
Lemonade/10 on this vid
5:32 The paintings on the wall in this frame have a better art style then the actual art style of the movie itself 💀
Tbh, I picked Netflix over Cable coz Clone Wars and Phineas and Ferb were still there, but after their removal, I regret picking Netflix instead of Cable.  Nowadays, Netflix is just throwing random movies/series and hope for the best.
My personal favorite Netflix wellt teccnectly shows is stranger things and all of us are dead
Right after he said "he wouldn't really punch a dog he kicks the dog", and I saw one frame before it cut away that looked exactly like the karate ad it cut away to and it was cut PERFECTLY

The original Marmaduke was my favorite movie as a kid but the remake is absolute dog water
6:01 was that the move editing or did you edit that?
2:31 “1994”
marmaduke was a live action movie from like 2010, i remember loving it. wtf is this??
I mean, marmaduke sounds like a pretty bad movie but 0%?! That’s a bit overkill tbh.
Drew making me fantasize about being under his desk between his legs throughout the entire review is certainly one way to make me not want to skip the sponsored segment.
The dog survived a Megladon attack and all the different climates of the globe yet everyone thought that the fallen poll had killed him?
Danny at 8:37: "Bruh why's the lady so attracted to the "pretty" dog out of nowhere? What's so special about him that makes all the girls faint?" Well he is called *ZEUS* for a reason.
Hola
YES someone did it! That stuff is marmadookie
Is it just me or am I the only one who feels like they’ve watched everything on Netflix.
18:08-18:12 For those of you who are curious, yes, that is J.K Simmons. And man, it sounds like he wants to do anything else but be in this movie.  And as someone who's currently interested in the field of animation, this film looks really unpleasant to look at.
😳🧐 plot twist... Danny wrote this movie and this was hit pitch meeting to Pete 😲🙇
“Scooby-Poo” is a low-key roast though lol
Peta wants to know your location
Why does he look like Andy from toy story lol. No offense btw, he's an AMAZING character!!
Its like if they blended up the live action marmaduke movie (Which is actually pretty good ive watched it a few times willingly) and baby-birded it into the movie 'what's up'
bruh as a blender user who has mad 3d characters before. this is lazy character design. and WTF IS THAT GARBAGE RENDERING ENGINE!! IT LOOKS SO BAD!!
father?? when can i leave to be on my oooownnnnn?
That ending credit song sounds like a less racist kid rock track
I hate that netflix pumps put bad animated movies, but it is somehow the same streaming service that delivers thae masterpiece that is Sea Beast, like pick a side 💀
They definitely highlight this movie on kid's Netflix. It was on my homepage a few months ago. I turned it on and instantly regretted it.
i remember watching the live action marmaduke at least once a week when i was little, and i loved it. this is not it.
I fuck with the outro song
Very funny.I liked it
Monopolies🙃
This show is mediocre
what is this animation
They probably are making bad movies on purpose as a marketing tactic the worse they make it the more attention and the more money they get
5:45 Those arent legs, those are literal toothpicks.
Whyyyyy is that movie even allowed  on the show they are showing animal  abuse  0_0
They should pay you to watch this movie
*It's overall hollywood too, not just netflix. The industry hasn't even had a good Horror film in YEARS.....
This marmaduke remake is horrible
damn netflix new movies our worse than our podcast which is saying something
my grandparents put this on for my 5 year old brother while i was in the room and i was just-
I miss the old intros  Hey Greg and welcome back too ( )
I just want to point out that there was a live action movie called marmaduke and, like this movie it's about a great dane that gets in a lot of trouble (voiced by owen wilson), they also have a cat and the father was named phil. Really makes you think🤔
they shouldve just left 2010 live action marmaduke alone.
Monkey ing around
Was I the only one who got a perfectly timed ad at 6:22 when he said “I was right…. He kicks the dog”
just thinking about this movie makes me wanna deploy doom slayer into the movie to spice things up if ya know what I mean :)
Bounty, the quicker picker upper
I got the ad
Danny always look blazed af
DANNY PLEASE REVIEW THE MOVIE “the little ghost” ITS ON HULU AND TUBI PPLEASE I EVEN SUBSCRIBED, TURNED ON THE BELL, IM A TRUE GREG ‼️
Marmaduke??? More like Marmadick
The animated humans look worse than the Addams family humans
Hands of this do- sorry ✨Paws✨ of this dog
You look like the Dad. Lego Eda says you look like the Dad. Everyone says you look like the Dad.
mullvad VPN is $5 a month and doesn't even ask for an email
the credits animation is 10x more appealing than the animation style they actually used
What about Stranger Things
Mom is thicc thoooo
This movie is like Garfield some characters can understand him and some can’t
Quick, the quicker picker upper!
This movie looks like a bad 90s movie, the animation, lighting, and how marmaduke stretches around just looks outdated
i am a child and really liked the movie so much that I saw it with my family          10 out of 10
the dad is actually doofenshmirtz if he had a good childhood
Hey who's the dog played by. Didn't get it
bro the lighting n fast animation makes it look like a bad youtube animation
I had to watch this in 5th grade 😭🤚🏻
Bro rlly used Caustic ult on that trophy bruh
We just not gonna mention that they ripped off the 2010 film marmaduke😂
Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
I swear, Fan Boy and Chum Chum saw success with this art style, and companies still think it’s a good art style to use.
marmaduke = 🤢🤮
The animations clip through walls most of the movie
i ended up laughing more at how bad the movie is than whatever is meant to be funny
There’s a there’s a movie called shitty fighter on Netflix totally I’m not scamming you
The cheerleaders look fat
I thought we were done with the era of needlessly turning every single joke into a 10 second mini sketch … kills the momentum of the vid lmao I knew it was a mistake to give this dude another chance
the dad looks like u danny
Marmaduke was a great movie, then they made this
Dude I literally couldn't even finish this movie that's how bad it it.
You’re from the 1900s
Are we not going to talk about how the kids are blonde and the parents have Brown hair
Danny please you NEED to do a video on the Disney movie Zombies
i have some illnesses and i had a seizure looking at the dog xd
"This is guy, his name is guy, He's Drew Goodens biggest fan" I think this joke is so underrated XD
ur shirt is fire
Damn that one chick got a DUMPY
that movie is disgusting. the live action marmaduke was so much better
The animation design looks terrible lol. Looks like a hello neighbor movie
ngl, the end credits animation is the only thing i find fascinating.
Some things later in the movie are also pretty cultural insensitive, like a Mexican lady’s chihuahua has to resist eating a taco and I’m pretty sure a French guy’s dog has to resist eating a baguette or something
the shih tzu pun had me dying
The quicker picker upper
Ok but the shirt is fire 🔥
Dk why but i would watch this
Vivo is a masterpiece tho
the crowd when they think marmaduke dies. yes finally its over
bro aint no way they ruined marmaduke
I grew up watching the live action 2010(?) Marmaduke film, with Owen Wilson and George Lopez. I’ll never forgive Netflix for tarnishing the good name of the original film and comic strips.
Before I watched this video I had no clue this was a Netflix original, I originally thought it was a ripoff of another movie.
13:09 imagine being so sad that you have to cover the air infront of your eyes
This video probably did better than the movie itself
yall remember the live action marmaduke?
Actually I just saw an animated movie on Netflix that was good. It’s called The Sea Beast. It does have a traditional adventure plot but I was okay with it. What made it awesome was the music and animation. It was so cool. The character design was awesome! I was really impressed 😊😄That and Over the Moon. I liked the animation style in that one as well. It was colorful and fun!
My teacher played this movie for my class-
Marmaduke was a shit comic strip so it makes senses
My humor has came full circle as i find marmaduke taking a shit in the trophy is funny af
Fun fact marmaduke is like a trilogy of live action dog movies
I was born in 1957 ,on earth ! lol  , marmaduke has been around since 1954, and until now was a very funny newspaper comic strip , and this is the worst animated film I`ve ever seen !
2:39
Danny can Make This That Funny
Video molto interessante
danny should have said.. whats up greg i hope you have a great dane. or not so great dane
Why do none of the characters have an upperlip?
I dare u to pin this :)
I don’t like the kids ones as an 11 year old there’s not much context
The best content!
My life is worse for knowing this exists. Thanks Danny!
who else thought it was gonna be  a manscaped sponsor when he looked down the desk
man i had to watch that movie.
Please watch dear dumb diary
I subscribed now i’m truly a GREG
Danny you don’t like a real human. It’s just the way you stare into the camera.
Well Mom got those big buns 😗😗
So goofy 💀
"I don't think any kids have actually watched this movie"-Danny my siblings:well...about that.
Was surprised at the 1.4 million at first but it's dog food so it makes sense
the director also made the movie Pixel perfect pls kill me
12:33 EMOTIONAL SUPPORT 934$ (jesus)
Marmaduke is a biochemical weapon
Dear Danny, After watching this lovely review on the Marmaduke movie I decided to be just like you!  Hence I watched the sequel to the first animated Addams family film, The Addams Family 2. Please watch it and review it.  I’m extremely curious about your intimate thoughts on the movie.  I’m especially excited to see if you like it even more than you enjoyed Marmaduke…! Sincerely,  a fellow “Greg.”
W
Everyone start roasting the dad’s limbs down here.
can you do virli singh again.
Jesus. I did not need to know about this movie, I send my condolences to anyone who sat through those seemingly excruciating 1 hour 30 minutes.
The only good thing about marmaduke is that we can laugh at how bad it is
my sister was watching this and I was dying of cringe and for some ever reason I was getting mad looking at the trainer guy or girl
Also the comment under me is a joke,what I meant to say was that I really do like your videos hope you make more soon too,I also live in Illnios.
Hi Danny Your a great guy,love your videos you probaly don't know me and never will but Im living inside your walls.
3:22 that explosion was uncalled for
It’s most likely the best writers were fired and the worst writers were hired
And getting rid of great shows like "Raising Dion"
Scooby doo got a glow down fr
does anyone else remember the 3D marmaduke or am i getting prophesies
Beautiful
My humour is so broken- this was wayy too funny
Seems like nobody is mentioning this. Marmaduke was a live action movie that released in 2010. I actually love this movie and the plot line is completely different than this movie that Danny is discussing. It seems the only similarities are a dog named Marmaduke. Overall it’s a great movie and I would love if Danny reviewed it in comparison to this one!
It seems like it would have made sense Marmaduke lifted the building since he is the one who ran and swam around the world...
this movie looks like someone opened up a 3d modeling software and then just threw their body at their computer and called it a movie
I have no respect for the comic this movie was ""based on"" but Marmaduke would not have wanted this.
Day 4 of me asking for you to redecorate your room. Where are the other nutcrackers!!
But the mom was thick
Me on Netflix: *sees Lorax* Me:what is this?? Also me:why did universal studios make this?..
As someone who loves horror, this movie has somehow given me even more of a pin-in-my-stomach dread feeling than any horror movie monstrosity ever could!
Kids shows have better quality
Btw watch 5-minutes crafts I’d just like troom troom
Why does he look so familiar?
you should buy a teddy bear hamster and put it in the screen of the vids, and film it yawning
Marmaduke: the only movie where you hope the dog dies
This video is more funny than the movie
The ONLY reason thatt bulldog didnt win was either because its done it before at a previous show, OR because of the property damage from lifting a building off the ground pipes/wires
The final part feels like AGT
Rick and Morty actually mentioned Marmaduke at the end of raising Gazorpazorp
HAAHHAHA NOW I KNOW YOUR TRUE IDENTITY….. KURTIS CONNER!!!
That dad could see Cthulhu rise from the ocean during a visit to the beach and that dad would probably yell "THAT FUCKING DOG"
I can’t stop thinking about the weird dog from the calbee Japanese commercial when I see the villain dog
Danny listen to me very carefully
Ahahhahaa
yo this guy ghosted kevin jonas
Netflix is trash.  All modern is.  They can't be good without saying something, can't be about anything, unless it's about something.  So thus, they fail.  Not on purpose, but by design.
My school played this in my cafeteria expecting us to like it 😭
marmaduke is a -10/10👎
Marvel is putting out way better movies then Netflix is this year :]
Yup Netflix are definitely making bad movies on purpose and it really looks like they are not putting the hard work into the movies they are creating.
Indian movies are better then this
MARMADUKE WAS GOOD 😡
Greg: oh hey Greg Greg 2: oh hey, oh wait isn't that Greg over there Greg 3: oh hey guys Greg Greg and fake Greg(Danny) Danny: hey get back in the basement NOW
Let's put it this way: If you pick up a 100+ movies that no other streaming service would pick up, they can now advertise that they have 100+ moves that no other service has.
I watch this movie in seventh grade in French
I know you dont know who technoblade is but i wish you made a video with him before he died.., even if you dont know who he is i hope you bless him
U should check out Varlis new tik tok its way different now !!! That would be a good reaction from u looking at it
I am truly Greg
Reaction to the entire movie😐
I didn't know what Danny meant by Pixar mom syndrome but then I remembered elastigirl
it's the Adams family animation but worse
The farts remember me of the Germans in WW1....
When will Danny post on his Danny gamezales channel again
Danny, review Santa Hunters.
It’s a movie animation, THEY CAN DO ANYTHING- stop being a stupid idiot, it’s just a movie. People think it’s cool and so do I. And just because it looks bad it has the greatest plot! And don’t get me started with your fans. If you hate a movie so do they- if I try to say something about me loving it they attack me just for loving it while you hate it.
I like what satan makes. I like this
Danny would be excellent at cinemasins.
i really want some candies for cuties rn
I liked the original 2010 marmaduke as a kid. THis one looks like shit
Literally when I went on to Netflix marmaduke was in the top ten
They brought the Garfield Show Animation team to recreate the Live Action Version into 3D  I prefer the Original.
.
What about ratatoing
perfect, ACTUALLY
cool
This movie has been on repeat in my house the last 2 weeks… unfortunately my 6 year old loves it.
He put zapped💀
Did Danny not watch sea beast
So you took of so many good shows and movies for this type of shit Netflix?? 😃✌️
marmarmarmarmarmmarmmardukedukedukedukedukedukedukedukedukedukemamamamamamamamama
Make a vid about varlis tik toks
this shit was actually at my local theatre
That fart scene is totally someones fetish 🥺
React to to old for fairy tales on Netflix
Netflix just want fillers🤷‍♂️
Theres also a movie about a dog named Marmaduke but it isn't animated, the animals still talk though and the plot it kinda different, i mean it's okay compared to this one but its not like it's my favourite movie
They lookin like Sonic 06 NPCs
?                                   Understand the Pinocchio one tho
I once watched this with my 3 yo sister when babysiting her. I fell asleep within 15 minutes of it starting
I watched Marmaduke at a camp for surfers on Viganj, it was all children and they laughed really hard, probably because most of them were 5-9 years old and didn't understand what was happening
It's so bad that when I logon to Netflix as a kid it isn't searchable. I logon as me...There it is.
Guy: Rider kick!
The dog farded
Well at least there was 1 kid that watched it @Spacey Gaming
What’s even more hilarious is that the actor who voices Zeus is J.K Simmons who is also Stanford from Gravity Falls. So whenever Zeus says anything in the movie I immediately think of Stanford Pines.
I randomly found you while playing people playground
I’m watching this at 5am and have no clue what’s going on
Bros dont smile
Marmaduke and Pinocchio....are children movies..... Umm... And I think you're not ...umm...a kid ?
0:5:19 as a British person I am formally offended
/e giffy
Danny I call upon your mighty reviewing skill pls review the naked carpenter
Marmaduke was a famous comic character, in case you wanted context. I think the movie could have been better than this, since he was so well known.
ive actually seen this movie like twice. literally everytime i go to my cousins house this movie is playing in the living room 🤣💀shes 10✋
I like how most replayed is at the pixar mom
Why the hell did they make the mom so thick  Only Pixar has that privilege Back off Marmaduke
So I just got my 9yo son Koury (we call him Sir) addicted to you......he loves you so much. Feel special.
17:25 danny 😭
(6:24)  Little Jimmy: How does a twig beat a great dane  Netflix producers: what you think we know?
Netflix just wants to impress people by how many movies they have
Netflix don't make movies they add them to their site
12:08
The live action Marmaduke from 2000s was my childhood and they remade it into this shit fucking hell
Isn't there a live action version of this movie that came out way before this? I feel like that's a thing but idk
The OG Marmaduke was the shit back in the day
How come the movies that everyone HATES looks fine to me Update: I said looks, I only judged by the picture of the dog, this movie doesnt seem good
Invest in netflix stocks now while it’s low....they’re doing it on purpose when quality movies come out the stock is gonna go up, along if they buy fan favorite titles, but that’s how stocks work and how shareholders are gonna make money, buy the stock low then watch it rise
The animation is… the animation is    FUCKING TERRIBLE HOLY SHIT
12:21 danny, you had me there for a sec.
Mid video
10:10 bro bouta mushroom cloud.
my little brother (he’s 4) went through like a week long phase where he loved this movie…it made me feel a kind of anger i never knew i could feel lol
Wow this dog trainer really applied the Clockwork Orange method of discipline
2:45 damn, if I was 13 again, I'd be bricked up. 👀
These bad movies live by the motto “any attention is good attention”
‘Is marmaduke gonna die’ *ad starts*
If cancer had an animation style this movie is using it
Marmaduke was originally on Netflix but it was a live action film. I honestly don’t remember much as my brothers and I where real young. I just remember in the beginning Marmaduke pisses in someone’s cup and then someone drinks it, which my brothers and I found super funny.
when i saw the thumbnail i thought it was a grubhub video
Have you seen bubble though
We watched it...
Can you watch something worse like g3 my little pony  or g3.5 my little pony because nothing happened in those, at least  there's conflict in marmaduke
Man’s talking about the dads nose and then showing his in the next
Nooo I loved reading Marmaduke as a kid.
you should 100% do a video on netflix brazilian movies. as a brazilian, i would love to see it
Bro you seen hedgehogs
when i saw danny punch that hole in his wall i legitimately thought he did xD
woow
Marmaduke is the greatest movie of this generation idk what your talking about
Belive it or not this movie was the top movie for the kids movie section in uk netflix
If you need a refreshment from bad Netflix movies, search up “The Sea Beast.” In all the scenes without the humans faces, it looks like real life, I swear. Now, go watch-
Pets united is worse
Yet my family still watches them
The really sad thing is that Marmaduke was a fun, daily single panel (6-panel in color in the Sunday funnies) comic by Brad Anderson.  From what you show of the 'film' (by appearances, closer to the CG version of projectile vomiting), not only did they almost completely ignore the art of the original work, but as your review makes clear, they also completely ignored the well-meaning, loving dog that Marmaduke was in the strips. He didn't talk, much of the humor was in comments by the family members to people that had never encountered Marmaduke, or (sometimes strange) events that would happen around Marmaduke, often that he had basically NO responsibility for (one strip I just saw on a Google search, showed Marmaduke and the dogs of the neighborhood all walking around together, and they ALL decide to stop to sniff the local hydrant...that inexplicably -apparently in general offense at all the sniffing- starts to rumble and spit what looks like steam, scaring the dogs away just before the pipe below it apparently bursts with such force that the hydrant is launched into orbit, and is then spotted by what seems like an astronomer [portrayed by a voice bubble from America on the globe of the Earth, as the hydrant is whizzing around the world] who inaccurately -at first- describes it as a UFO, then corrects himself as he recognizes it for a fire hydrant. No explanation, except that Marmaduke was there when it happened)...  Yes, he was rather destructive, but not through malicious mischief, but incidental events (being so enthusiastic that his wagging tail knocks nearly everything down to the floor)...but was he a character to make a movie about? ...much less a BAD movie about...? No, not really. The humor in Marmaduke's strips was the directly-to-the-punchline type, not the build-up/THEN punchline scene type... These guys just wanted a dog character with name recognition they could give the 'Beethoven' treatment in a trash/throwaway 'animated' film, hoping to make a quick buck with parent nostalgia (from the old strip days), and a sad belief that kids think that anything destructive is hilarious, so they'll obviously LOVE THIS!!  I'm glad it got panned. I just hope they never made their money back from ANY source, and it will be used as an excuse to prevent both the 'animation studio' and the 'production staff' from ever making a movie again.
✨bouncing egg✨
0:20 i remember the OG marmaduke... Live action surreal nightmare that I remember watching as a kid time ago
without a doubt this is the most embarrassing thing anyone involved with this movie has ever done.
I'm one of the VAs in this movie and I've been watching your channel for years!!! It was such an honor to be in one of your videos!!! I laughed so much!!!
Netflix TOTALLY REDEMEED themselves with Gray Man
I actually thought that this movie was made in 2006 because it looks like something from the time
Zombies 3 please  danny boi or i will  cry
Why would a grown adult even COMMENT on this movie, much less WATCH it?
The original  cartoon of "Marmaduke" isn't funny either. At all.
Blockbuster closed for this sh*t
The movie: Horrible no, WORSE than horrible  How He explains it: Way better than any movie I've ever seen
2010 Marmaduke wasn’t great (according the rotten tomatoes) but it was way way way way better than this monstrosity
"Look at his nose to arm ratio"
Marmaduke needs a goofy cartoon voice,not a Nick Wild like voice
Danny gonzalez just be putting his big fuckin head in the thumbnail on purpose
Alot of companies have insurance on if their movie flops. They would make more money on a flop than on a good movie. It is a reason why alot of video game movies in the past was made by one guy and always suckdd
Short answer: Yes.
Afghan hounds look weird as fuck and people are over here thristing over one  What the actual fuck is this world coming to
I feel bad for Marmaduke  I feel like he's just a dog who got shoved into a family he doesn't belong in because of his size and activity level and then he basically gets sent to a brutal correction school disguised as a "dog trainer"
when u said Pinocchio’s thought u were talking about the Disney one lol.
Why does the animation look like a china lore video ToT
Jesus is KING!!!
You spelled “films” wrong /j
Their limbs are so thin I can barely see them when they're 10 feet from the camera
i can confidently say this time the live action is better than the animation
Although this movie is pretty shitty, J.K. Simmons actor gave his all for what he was given, and he is the best part of the movie
After seeing the dua lipa dance scene in the Netflix resident evil show. I just don’t understand how they could be trying to make it good? Maybe the strategy is, if it’s SO bad then it trends more and gets watched more?
They are doing this so they can release a good one soon
At first I was miffed that they didn't hire actual voice actors to do this movie. After watching Danny's video, they kidnapped Pete Davidson and the rest of the cast and made them record everything in one take in a basement.
wtf happened to ur chair at 5:18
Marmaduke being trained montage oh sorry Marmaduke being tortured montage
the live action marmaduke was better
i actually saw a trailer for this in a theatre. i shit you not they showed the scene of the dog farting during the competition. it was awful. this film looks so much worse on a big screen. and also the voice actor in my country did do some promotional material, so maybe that was just a pete davidson thing
Danny gets brainwashed by magic poodle (NOT CLICKBAIT): 17:24
Remember original marmaduke
Are you comparing a cartoon for 5-year-olds to something that should be cinematically comprehensible to adults if you are there is a live-action or a Duke you can go complain about this is for children of course it's overly obvious and awful for children to learn and understand 😆
Are class was forced to watch this in Spanish for are Spanish class and we loved it but hated it at the same time
Danny,I think you should make another video about merge mansion!there are so many more lore ads and I think it would make a good video
is suggest that you react to the youtube Channel called Animated Story
This such a movie.
This mOviE is disgusting
Marmaduke face when he farted in the trophy is extremely disturbing... I wish I can delete that memory from my brain
I remember watching that me and my older sister hated it so much we were like "tf is that? "
The swifter add i got was better quality than marmaduke
I need you to react to What’s Up: Balloon to the Rescue!”. I actually owned it as a kid. I can already imagine you reacting to it.
Wait your 32 years old
badads but netflix
I literally watched it🤦‍♀️
it looks like a movie made by surreal entertainment
the fact that my class watched marmaduke 💀
The fact that the plot starts because a dog stepped on a bee
Wow what a surprise! A classic movie remade for no other reason than for money 😄
Thanks for the warm welcome.
Sneakos dissing you Danny
I know for a fact that this movies budget is around 2.3 million dollars. And 2.25 million dollars were spent on Pete Davidson starring in this movie
18:55 damn it marmeduke you were supposed to stay dead so your family could sue the dog show!
This is an insult to the original Marmaduke movie
(▼へ▼メ) fatherｏ(＞^＜)○when can i leave to be on my ownnnn (＃`Д´)i got the whole world to see
I was literally thinking of the 2010 Marmaduke, and then this gets recommended to me
Nah my little sis was watching dis
My dads girlfriend has two kids who watch this on the living room TV everyday.
And there was me thinking Dead Space had disturbing imagery. Those character designs are absolutely terrifying.
I am part of the Greg fam now!!! Notifs on too
Best part of this movie was by far when Walter White came in and said "Marmaduke we have to cook" and then they had the crystal meth arc. Lots of character growth for Marmaduke there and it really solidified this movie as an instant classic in my eyes.
There was a live action marmaduke and it was actually pretty good
i like how at 1:01 it says 'one cool animation production' while the animation looks terrible.
Good video
hi drem
Getting Pete Davidson for a movie like this does not surprise or impress me, but getting David Koechner is definitely unexpected… But how in the living fucking fucking living hell did they get JK Simmons!?!?  They must have some black male because there’s no goddamn way JK Simmons! Would do this shit movie!!
Pixar Moms making me act up man
marmaduke is a dark magic user which is why his fart was so foul
are you pikachu
If Netflix wonders why they are losing subscribers I have this information for them; STOP MAKING MOVIES!!!!! You are a streaming service and that's what people want. You aren't a movie studio and you suck at it. Pay the royalty fees and fill your service with CONTENT, not 10 lists that all contain the same movies. If you only listed your titles once you would have about six movies (sarcasm) and that's not why I subscribed. The money you spend making one movie would pay the royalty fee on about twenty existing ones. Do you think I would rather watch twenty good movies or one half assed one? Fire everyone who makes movies and hire a purchasing agent.
12:08 nice ad placement lmao
unrelated but, You look so much like Sebastian croft
This guy isnt real
4:14 how much water was in that pool tho was it like 10 million miles deep
imma be really real with this character design. everyone’s arms are way too long. they go to their fucking knees.
Sneako owns you lmao
Heh they really baiting us with that 'Pixar Mom's booty' lmao
This is one of my favorite films. I can not believe you would look past such incredible writing and animated ingenuity. You truly just don’t understand and can’t appreciate a good film when you see one. Unsubscribed.
Danny, I now just realized I was never subscribed to you and I’ve been watching you for a while. This is some very sad news.
The body still moves after the head is cut off. Hollywood is bleeding out. It will mine the biggest group of morons on Earth: kids.
DANNY PLEASE ANSWER I SAW A LIVE ACTION MARMADUKE AND I WANT YOU TO REACT TO IT PLEAAAAEEEEEEAAASEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
I hate how the movie goes from  Happy first act  Weird fetish end of first act  To a depressing and sad second act in like a fucking matter of seconds out of nowhere
Bad did not like
You should review Cargo it’s a really bad animated movie
John and Hank Green's childhood dog somehow pooped in their nintendo - and they can't believe the dog was capable of it, so they blame each other
This brings me very sad memories
The drew gooden line was amazing. Def underrated
What about the sea beast? That movie was Freaking awesome!
this was actually a comic in the sunday paper that I read when I was a kid and I literally could not understand what was happening ever
The first Marmaduke movie wasn’t even good, so made them think another Marmaduke movie was gonna work
My 5 year old son begged to watch this movie and I wish I saw this video first. I was baffled by how awful it was. He liked it so I’m not sure if that says more about him or the movie 😂
Base on a comic strip. Wow they cat in hat this one. You won't guess it because only old people read newspaper. I sometimes read them for ads, business, weather, and fishing tips.
Dude why the hell did they not go with the 2d animation it was infinetley better than the 3d
i feel like they gave pete davidson $24.07, a paper clip, and an eighth to make this movie
I don't know, do you make bad videos like this on purpose?
because blackrock 😤
i am now truly greg
Danny you gotta react to Shneako, he's made videos on you and is begging for attention
Ha! It's like Stewie. We still aren't sure who all can understand him. We know Brian can but the others some times respond to him like they understood and other times like they're responding to a baby that's making baby noises.
is your nose enlarged in the thumbnail
when ⏰ you see 👀 a tsunami 🌊 and you say 🗣 “diggity dang 🤬 that dog 🐶!”
😂
dude i remember the old marmaduke movie it was so bad i loved it as a kid
does anyone know if danny has a letterboxd
I can't tell what's worse, the writing of the movie, or the character design
BRO RIGHT WHEN DANNY SAID IS MARMADUKE GONNA DIE AN AMBULANCE SIREN TURNED ON NEAR ME💀
The animals in this movie look worse than the ones in Barbie movies tbh.
Marmaduke is actually a really old live action movie
Mom has a bad case of
He was born in the 1990's??? He looks 12! 😂😂😂
hi
This movie is the opposite of Disney right now. It is a CGI adaptation of a movie that was originally in "live" action.
HOW IS THIS MOVIE RATED TV-Y7
Are you getting old
Hello Danny! Could you watch invisible sister on Disney plus because I loved it when i was younger?
Day 2 of me asking for you to redecorate your room. What happened to the fan art Daniel
The dad of this family's arms look like a measuring tape that was bent to fit into a corner
I found it funny that he almost died
6:44
I can confirm I created the Movie and yes I was fed bad movie scripts, they tasted awful...
This is one of the movies of all time
Bro kids animations have a higher budget
My reaction is:EWWWWW
The fart is like the gas from warzone
Could you react to camp camp season 2 episode 1
The original Marmaduke movie was way better
Hey Danny, this is pretty random, but have you ever thought about doing another video on Varli? One of her videos popped up on my for you page recently and it reminded me of your videos- but I can tell you, that her videos have changed a bit since the last time you reacted to her
The worst sin in this movie is having a character named Guy who isn’t voiced by Ryan Reynolds
19:49 This movie is an absolute disaster.  ...But the real disaster is having your unencrypted data harvested by hackers, corporations and government thieves.
It’s easy to get bored after watching because after you finish watching the new season of a show their is nothing good left.
When you said no kids watch watch this movie I have and it HORRIBLE
This movie is so bad I don't think anybody will play for this until their baby says mommy pweas pweas
bro marmardoks ear clips through the window
There was perfectly good live action marmaduke Netflix just breaks everything it touches
i mean, Netflix...
Just became a proud greg and sold my soul to you. keep it up!!!!!!1
Sues is the name of my dog they stole my dogs name
My reaction is the face on my profile
Why did they fuck with marmaduke
How do you make an animated movie worse than the live action Owen Wilson Marmaduke
Bro my 3 year old brother loves this movie 😭
man, honestly the best fucking part of this movie by far is when it ended.
my little cousin watched it, she had dreams of marmaduke-
I'm gonna throw up
The mom tho😤😤
FathEr!!! when CaN I BE on my Ownnnnnnnnnnnnn?.... And I am also a bouncing egg.
someone better inform danny sneako made a whole video about him and chad chad LOL cringe city…
4:15
Hi
Hi
Hi
Hi
i got really high w a friend and decided to watch this movie. we didn’t know that marmaduke was voiced by pete davidson until we saw the credits and laughed our asses off for about 10 minutes straight
I turned on notifications
There’s gotta be some sort of money laundering going on.
Plz react to dhar man
They made a live action marmaduke
Okay, but the live action Marmaduke I loved as a kid and still do.
I OAUGHED SM OML I CANT MY HEWRT WND CHEST HURTS
This was such a good video
🥒🦵
they could totally make a better movie about the bulldog with super strength
That Pinocchio movie wasn't Netflix. I think it was made in Russia? There are actually 2 other pinocchio movies coming out this year one of which will be made by Netflix. It's going to be stop motion and seems to be a bit of a passion project of Guillermo Del Toro. Pat McHale is Also a writer on it. Hesitated to mention any of this here because idk if anyone will care but it's been my enduring fear that it'll get swept under the rug because of the Russian one. As funny as I found the trailers I think that'd be a shame.
lol
These arent stupid movies there meant to be for kids and marmaduke THATS A GOOD FRICKING MOVIE
Feel like shit just want Owen Wilson's 2010 Marmaduke back
The clown is the only best character from the beginning
Imagine the Guy who voiced “Marmaduke” bangs your Wife.
Netflix is BUYING bad movies because they're CHEAP. Netflix is not listed as a producer for Marmaduke, only its US distributor.  Why these movies are made in the first place, and who's paying for production, is another question. I suspect that money laundering has something to do with at least some of this ... there is a rabbit hole here.
They cancel good shows, and choose to spit out this stuff instead.
Danny, Hollywood is basically a money laundering operation where rich people pay themselves to make dumb shit and reinvest in each other. Netflix made it worse.
You made and my sister laugh so hard that we almost died XD
How bad could be? It’s a cartoon, it’s about a dog… oh… oh no… that doesn’t look good at all…
The thing about Netflix is that they make amazing shows like arcane and kipo but then they shit like fucking “tall girl” I’m pretty sure being tall is fucking good
10:14 I hate it I hate it I hate it HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhh
How did this come out in 2022? It looks like it came out in 2008
@3:17 the dog’s head literally went through the curtain
that whole entire fart scene was definitely purely a fetish thing and I will not be thinking otherwise
Marmaduke or a goats story???
I watched he original Marmaduke a lot of times.
You forgot one of the absolute worst Chinese made movies. *Pets United…*  I’m sorry if you got offended when I said Chinese, but believe me, Chinese English kids movies are bad. Sorry. But this is my opinion… :/
your face looks like the teens titans house with that nose
Marmaduke is a great movie. The live action one from awhile back.
2:14 reminds of the minions
i remember loving the original marmaduke movie when i was younger. seeing how they tried to remake it is really disappointing :/
Has there ever been a successful marmaduke adaptation
Me when I find out marmaduke survived     Stomps on hed
Scoobypoo would be better
Jimmy newtron was better cg and it was on vhs...
This review was funnier than the actual movie.
The marmaduke was good, the one where there were real people
the animations look like they were made by someone who just learned blender
W
Danny respectfully, ur so beautiful
It's "The Producers" in real life.
i’m ngl danny looks like hello neighbour in the thumbnail
I subbed with notifications on, am I truly greg now?
Marmaduke started Chernobyl part 2 by shitting in a trophy
You should reacted to the quins Corgi the movie

I’ve watched the trailer. Not the movie. The animation make me wanna vomit.
BETA MALE !
The fart at the first dog show was a marmaduke massacre
bro this guys a goat most of the time hes right
hm
You should make a video and upload it to Drew's channel and Drew should make a video and upload it to your channel, it would be funny.
most animated movies nowadays are pretty bad but this one is actually disgusting just looking at it is making me feel ill
Disney's   'buzz lightyear"   LESBIAN movie is equally  gross as netflix's softporns. . . . . . . . .  Word Of God in Leviticus 18:22 denounces homosexuality   ( that includes lesbianism ). . . ..  .. . . .  . . . . . .
So tan.
The art style: Noses: huge and large and huge, OR itty bitty lil guy Body: anorexic, fat, or fetishized thick women Voices: bad
“Nose and arm ratio” I DIED
You know a movie is bad then the main character is voiced by a famous person who doesn't tell anyone they're in the movie because they don't want anyone to know.
Maybe they are letting new animators some practice?
what the dog doin
i turned on notifications and subscribed, am i a true greg member now?
The talking animations are 💀
Rodeo

That dog is way into his own pooping and farding. Like what was that face of ecstasy for, good lord
i dare you to react to sir billi i would send the link but i cant
“Because he’s rich and British”
"Is netflix just making bad movies on purpose?"  No no, bad movies are making netflix on purpose
bro i can’t stop laughing 💀
Netflix cancelling actually good shows and then making something like this. I'm not shocked, I'm just disappointed.
Danny Gonzales please review “The Little Mermaid “!!! Please completely DEMOLISH my childhood
Day 1 of me asking for you to redecorate your room. I see the two doors DAN
Is it just me don’t you feel bad for marmaduke
Imagine being the animators
I just don't understand who asked for this movie. I don't recall anyone ever enjoying Marmaduke. So like, why did they decide to make this? No one wanted it.
Pete Davidson must've hated voicing for this movie lmao
I've laughed my ass off during this video god bro your humor is great! 💗
I can't tell you how many times I told myself while watching this movie that Danny would make a video on it.
i feel like im desensitized to this movie after watching Goat Story 😀
Danny I’m coming out to you as pansexual and trans female to male before anyone else so congrats I came out to you before my family
normaduke was so frickin bad i made a new account to watch it i could only stand 30 second sit was so cringe
Why are there so many pr°n profile pics?
Marmaduke got sent to the gulog
Ain’t even watch the video just think it’s dumb u would sit through bad movies but won’t take the time to watch great ones like it’s a cartoon and ur 28 what do u expect it’s for kids not u
It’s crazy u would sit here and watch bad movies but won’t watch the matrix like y u wasting ur time watching bad shit
2:34
The characters look like something from veggietales
ok as an animator this movie looks mid as hell  You know what? I didn't say enough so i'm editing my comment. The voice acting, animation, EVERYTHING- AWFUL. DOGWATER. THIS MOVIE IS DOGWATER
Netflix made a few good movies like “The sea beast”
Gëêt frëÉ rŒbUx HèRë                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   LOL u thought u was getting robux LOL
I joined GREG a year ago today. 💗💗
My art teacher forced my class to watch this, I made fun of it the entire time and got yelled at for it
How come netflix is pumping out amazing shows like dead end but makes garbage movies? I swear to god who the heck at netflix verifys these movies
The whole movie sounds like a literal child wrote it.
Bro the nuke dog
Hey you should review and how you feel about lego friends

Doggo = Hiroshima
Aw sweet, it’s man made horrors beyond my comprehension 😎
Even after the dog gets the crap beat out of him he still has 0% leg muscle
21:41 on just how bad ONE lousy movie is ? Are you serious ? The article was supposed to be about Netflix makeing bad movies on purpose . Not Netflix making ONE bad movie . I think I'll skip subscribing
Hi dreem

I actually watched the whole film and it was so bland and the animation feels a little off sometimes 😂
So your saying im a villain just bc I’m British lol
Og marmaduke is better
Wait until he learns Marmaduke is a remake
the fart scene was the best thing about marmaduke
The problem is this movie WAS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE WITH REAL DOGS THAT WAS FINE AND CUTE. IT WAS ENJOYABLE. THEY DIDNT HAVE TO DO THIS
I turned on all notifications am I truly Greg?
I think it's a joke on dog whisperer. It's implied he understands a dogs barking
Is it just me or whenever danny says "hi greg" I feel like I have to say "hi greg" plz help
they got rid of every non mediocre show and now is releasing this dog shit 💀
i dont get why they even made this movie, after the fail of the live action movie.
Remember when Netflix was good
It’s santa
They went out of the way to make the mom dumb thicc 😂
seems to very, VERY, loosely based on the 2010 film of the same name. they literally had the work done for them, and they still fucked it up
just imagine if this movie have a rip off and you can barely see who is original
I used to watch all your content. But since you started bowing down to the absolute nonsense that is "preferred pronouns," I'll never watch you again and you've lost a subscriber.
3d animation can be so amazing, especially when trying to emulate 2d. BUT WTF IS THIS ANIMATION??? WHO TF WATCHED THIS AND WENT; "ah yes this is good" WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE THIS????
React to a good movie
8:04 what did ypu say about my mother?
i am guy, i love kurtis
dude that ad was just   POV, you’re giving head to Danny but he feels like you need to learn about internet safety
I swear to God every time I hear that Pinocchio voice,it just sounds… like he’s gay..
No they just ran out of ideas
How can they make a movie like this and people sometimes like them 🤨
The “Not So Great Dane” joke is LEGITIMATELY hilarious to me! 😂🤣
Random natural disaster: happens  Dad: “DIGGTY DANG THAT DOG!”
Day like 17 of asking if Danny likes Japanese Spider-Man and the theme song called Kakero! Spider-Man I listen to it almost EVERY DAY DANNY PLEASE ANSER THE QUSTION!!!! anyways I am tired as shit
you should review zenon- girl of the 21st century! its kinda bad LOL
Why does Danny Gonzalez always look so much like he could be a character in a Disney channel movie
My 7th grade teacher would eat this movie up
Correct me if I’m wrong, but…isn’t this also a rip-off?
Marmaduke killed Princess Diana
Look for hammy Look for my hammy Look for ham Look Look look
POV: you watched the sponser at the end just to look at Danny beautiful slightly veiny (in the god way) arms and listen to nothing he is saying.
Danny you should watch Your old Vines
19:09   😂 same here,  my exact thought process
the way i saw this movie on netflix a few days ago and was about tp watch it, only to instead watch something else. then i saw danny made this video about it and i forced myself to finish the actual movie before i watched this video
I think Netflix is making bad movies on purpose to lower their stock price so they can buy back shares at a discount.
Kid like the movie
This animation is so so ugly it's like it's on purpose. Why is everything so oversaturated as well? Very outdated and awful look
I  tried to watch this with my nephew but I couldn't get passed the karate scene in the beginning 😆
Who’s greg
cool
I am crying laughing at this
Marmaduke 1 was actually a 2000's movie that was nothing like this and deserves better ratings than this. not many people have copies of it but i happen to and it was one of my favorite childhood movies.  now this netflix adaptation is closer to the comic strip but the animation is like you just learned blender and you thought you could make a movie but it ends up being shit
6:05 bros built like a grass hopper
My mom started falling asleep to your smarthouse video, she says your voice is very soothing 😭
You see, this is EXACTLY why I don't like Netflix that much anymore. It has some REALLY good shows like Grey's anatomy, etc. But some of the Netflix originals are TRASH. They delete the good stuff, and replace it with THIS. And if they finally get an original right, they either cancel it, or, yeah cancel it RIGHT WHEN PEOPLE R HYPED UP.
there's still 5 months left in the year, don't say the worst movie "this year". Dont provoke them. please.
Why does this look like some YouTube movie
My 7 year old sister actually showed me this movie a while back. She was really excited to show me the movie because she knew I loved big dogs but I honestly I couldn’t watch the whole thing…. She still likes this movie and watches it from time to time…
I dunno what I find more depressing, the bad dog movie - or that this awful youtuber has got 4m views for this shit.
Ah yes, the three genders: Slenderman, Bouncing Egg, and Pixar Mom
Wasn’t marmaduke a live action movie back in the 2000s? This is a remake which is even worse
dawg why does that animation look like it is from a chinese rip off
I hate this movie so much, the live action marmaduke was such a masterpiece and I really loved it and I still do
Danny if you're looking for another Disney Channel Original movie to watch I am begging you to watch Geek Charming it is criminally underrated and honestly a masterpiece and I need you to review it right now
I feel bad for the birds
DANNY! I just realised that Gabriel from the office kind of looks like you... He even got ur nose
Marmadanny 🤗
danny its been 10 days what happened to new videos every second 😡😡
I babysit my neighbors, they are 2 and 5 and for some reason really like this movie, when they made me watch it with them and the dog “died” I actually lost my shit. It would have been a way better movie if he would have actually died.
Why, Netflix. Why
Netflix has been funding random extremely bad movies so they can evade taxes.
The proportions on everyone make me want to fucking die
No, I love Netflix!!!!
As a person who grew up watching the original Marmaduke I have to say this recreation seems like the thing nightmares are made of. The Art style is terrible and setting is horrendous. The original movie was set in Orange County California and now this abomination is set in like some rando american town in the middle of kansas or something? Is this even the same movie?
Remember the original marmaduke
I just hovered over the movie and watched the intro and turned off the tv
guy: *beats the shit out of the dog* also guy: charges family millions of dollars
Marmaduke is actually alright I give it 8/10
Another review of this movie with no mention of the fact that it's based on a comic strip, to which the character designs could have been compared head-to-head.
Irl this dog wouldve been to prison for destroying our eyes
some reason i like marmaduke am i the only one who likes it? i have no idea if im spelling it right
Netflix don’t make movies
WHY ARE YOU WALKING ON ALL FOURS I CANT. the screenshots i just got are fucking gold
dude i literally watched this a month ago and PRAYED that danny would make  a video about it😂
Danny please make a video on Cars life it’s so awful it’s an very low budget rip off of cars
2:14 the clown sus
I literally watched Maramduke for Billy's Mom, I'm not ashamed
My name is greg and it feels like you are talking directly to me!
THEY ARE LOSEING SO MUCH MONEY NEED TO DUMP HARRY AND MEG. IF THEY WANT TO GET SUBCRIBERS BACK
Just don’t get the stupid Netflix adaptation mixed up with the 2010 movie, that one was good.
Is anyone else getting Ratatoing vibes from the animation?
my health teacher played this movie before the school year ended, i was so confused how he thought this was convincing us to be healthy...
My nephew has made me watch this movie with him twice now and it was horrendous
14 seconds in and i hear father when can i leave on my own inthe most sassiest voice ive ever head lol
Wait a second I'm just yelled at Matt wash for having a millions of views and not having comments or anything it's almost like that's not real all right I'm I'm sorry to do this I'm calling shenanigans I'm calling shenanigans on the channel right
It can’t just be me but varleigh has been on my fyp so much lately making a mini movie and a music video ?
not gonna lie, I started watching this movie and then I stopped halfway through because the animation was just so bad
Netflix and Hollywood are not making bad movies on purpose. They just do not have the talent anymore for making good entertainment like way back in the mid last century. Actors rely too much on special effects and stand-ins. Gone are the days when actors learned dozens of scenes at a time. The acting is really gone. Remake and spinoffs one after the other. No imagination for new movies. How many movies have not been made two or more times each with a little twist but exactly the same theme. No imagination. As they say history repeats itself if you do not pay attention to the past. Everything old is new or at least you think it is new.
First reaction burn it all with fire and then after it all burns I porn gasoline on the fire
No joke, when I saw the thumbnail, I thought the movie was about pregnant Scooby-Doo
When i was in 8th grade they showed us this movie. AT SCHOOL the teachers decided 8th graders should watch this movie. It was horrific.
Who animated this movie, edited it, and actually decided to put it on the internet💀
Notifications on
yeah this movie is bad and all but DAM that cartoon mum THICC AF 😫👌🏻
It's like illumination but even worse, it reminds me of them shitty animated movies you saw a lot around the 2000s even now, the bad cliche movies based on a popular (or obscure) character with a celebrity playing the main character (the lorax, the true story of puss in boots and hotel Transylvania) the company who made it didn't care, Pete Davidson didn't care so why should we care?, Remember straight to dvd movies back then? Now it's "netflix original"
The sad things is that the old Marmaduke was me and my brothers favorite movie growing up and this movie just sucks.
Like a good neighbor state farm is there       I'm sorry Nooooo
“He sees Marmaduke, this poorly behaved monster” had no business making me laugh as hard as it did😭😭
Ok but can we talk about how the school bullies are all minorities? Like how in the world did they think that was fine???
DANNY PLEASE REACT TO THE MOONIES
Mom is the only five in the face so her head will get a bag so my time won't get waste
The irl one is better
No way Netflix made this.
No. They made squid game.
i honestly don't know why they'd pick marmaduke to make a movie out of in the first place. it's a single panel comic and it's never been funny once in the history of mankind. it's always like the guy standing over the dog in his chair like, "marmaduke! that's my chair." so much potential for cinematic goofs
I know this is off topic but no one is going to tell Danny that Balkin Gains used him for a thumbnail?
You sound and look like 6 people
It's like pets united... why?
I’m surprised nobody turned Marmaduke into another rendition of the “Morbius/Minions is the greatest movie ever” meme
Bro that’s my favorite movie!1!1!1!1! Na jk
Danny thank you so much For reacting to this for me I was thinking about watching it But then you watched it for me
Have to admit Marmaduke dieing  would have neen the best ending
The only highlight of the movie is that there are persona 4 voice actors in it.
Guy: *kicks Marmaduke*  Me who just watched part 1: Well my God, isn't that a motherf__king Jojo reference?
Omg drew I have been waiting for you to watch this haha
cant expressVPN do the same?
The thumbnail looks like the cover of a scooby doo wattpad mpreg fanfiction
I love Marmaduke (the old movie and the comic strips) this movie tho... needs to die
All the characters look like from a poor youtube poop, which heavily overused liquify tool. I bet you can't see half of them in 480p.
I can’t believe I’m saying this but this movie is worse than The Room
"Look at his nose to arm ratio" killed me on the spot. Never before heard a sentence like that.
14:31 I think I’ve seen that shark model before
I hate Marmaduke to the moon and back.
matu patlu kung fu kings
“born and raised “= race motivated opinions
Wouldn't pass muster for a No Animals were Harmed credit.
I have no sound
Live action marmaduke better
You do be lookin like a muppet
Marmaduke for me is a horrible CGI movie it’s not really the best movie and also the characters are really bad animated
the animation was so bad i just stopped watching it
I didn't laugh at where he pooped, I laughed at the nuke.
Very nich
Netflix doesn't make bad movies on purpose- someone who was definitely fucking lying
I think this is that vine guy
Me and my family watched this after watching wish dragon, big mistake, never again. wish dragon was 100 times better in terms of everything. I actually ended up giving up on marmaduke not even 20 minutes in
I feel like Netflix produces sh!tty movies just so when they produce something good, it really stands out (and dont get me wrong, there are some absolutely amazing Netflix movies and tv shows) and it’s almost like they have never seen a kids movie, and are just guessing on what they think kids would like.
WTH is this movie bro
Bro the sound effects are trash and the animations like thunder and stuff is so bad i know ppl who could probably do better than this a a dirty run down basement
They cancelled the series based on the Bone Graphic novels, but they were okay with stuff like these?!?
A good recommendation for a Disney channel movie is Invisible Sister. I think it’s one of the newer movies, but I remember a bunch of scenes from that movie.
i agree
'We're all losers!' I think that was the screenwriters trying to tell us something...
They made an animated (trashy) Marmaduke???
Why’d they do my boy marmaduke like that?
Greg pillows!
Crying cos I ran to the comments hoping for one ‘ my dog stepped on a bee’ joke from the dog chasing the bee🥲
There is a lot wrong it’s this movie. Mostly the designs, rendering, writing, and the entire animation itself.
lol danny i was looking at movies and saw this absolute dogshit (pun intended) and watched 15 minutes of this movie and instantly left netflix
Nice video
Danny’s just a die hard Kanye fan and I respect that.
Simply put Netflix has a horrible hr department that literally hires the worst people just to be fired. Many SJWs were fired from Netflix but they just keep hiring the same type of people claiming they are cleaning up when they’re not.
The animation is legit from the 2000's like early/ middle. I guess the budget money mostly went to pete. If i said actually is true. You just scammed yourself. He not worth that much of the budget... lord.
My brother is obsessed with this goddamn movie💀
Netflix: Huh, everyone hates our stuff and we're losing a lot of money. How about we sack the whole animation team? Will that help?  Everyone: No that's a terrible idea, stop  Netflix: FINE, her you go, this is the animated content you wanted, right??
"wow my art looks like trash" *Looks at the Marmaduke's animation for 3 seconds* "WOW MY ART IS SO GOOD"
these character designs bring me pain. theres stylization, and then theres.. this
The thing is, Netflix makes some really good stuff, too. They just make so much stuff on the off-chance that a masterpiece will happen, that it makes all these monstrosities.
react to the 2010 marmaduke!!!
when i tell you i have laughed throughout this entire video😭
I was gonna say at first maybe its just animators right out of college but I don't think anything could make up for how much this entire movie sucks
cant believe he actually barked that at 8:05 in the video… wow…
06:13 WTH are Deuces?  Dukes. They put up their dukes...(of York)  Great vid; this point though...gona put my duces up in the air like i just don't care
React to bmbm preschool cartoon
Looking gorgous
when will you stream on twitch again???
I think i can smell the fart from my house…
The thing that bothers me is that one of his eyebrows is higher than the other
The fact that J.K Simmons was in this movie and one of the youtubers i watch makes me die a little inside 💀     J.K Simmons plays Zeus The youtuber i talked about is Shelby Young and she is a professional voice actor btw and she played one of the cheerleaders
There is an old marmaduke movie about another great Dane and the old marmaduke movie was actually good, but this movie just disappointed me in all possible ways
The original marmaduke was SO much better
You should do a video on Junior High School (1978). It is the worst movie ever. You can watch it on YouTube and it's like the plan bee version of Grease. You have to watch it!
Do another collab with Ryan Trahan
hi danny
im hungry
my rabbit is named greg and i used hi paw to subscribe is he truly double greg
This almost makes the minions look good.
I don't like the angle of the sponsor.....
Why is no one talking about Danny basically thrist trapping us for his expressvpn ad 😥
Marmaduke is such a beta
Danny looks like the mayor from cloudy with a chance of meatballs
This movie looks like a warcrime
The original marmaduke is good. But this is S**T
Bruh my siblings have watched that bruh lol
My mom turned this on when my niece was over and we were literally eating pizza and the whole middle part of the movie was just fucking gross like I don't even know why it was needed lmao- (also my niece fell asleep afterwards I think)
Death scene got me giggling
Random thought: stuff like squishy bones and let's together bath are a long standing inside joke for no reason!
The real life marmaduke is much much much better then whatever the new one is
you should watch jem and the hologram
Squid game is like the only good show on Netflix
You should check on Varli
“He’s not going to punch a dog, right?” No, that’s Justin Chad’s job
Gilbert godfred would of been perfect for Marmaduke rip legend
Knock off Scooby Doo
In my opinion Marmaduke was an amazing movie
That song was an absolute BANGER
Honestly I could do better and fuck I dont even do anything related to acting or any of the shit to make a movie
Man movies from the 2000s were better looking
are we gonna talk abt how real the wall looked when danny punched it tho..
He's got the whole  *worldussy*
Marmaduke is also a comic strip, and for those who are unfamiliar with the comic strip: it ALSO sucks ass. It’s terrible. Ugly and unfunny and repetitive
lol all the characters in the movie are minecraft skeletons or the left 4 dead 2 bommer
2:25 my reaction is wtf
Dude this is literally the worst movie ever
You're right
Literally is Puppy Dog Pals the Movie, on god.
Danny you sound like pinocchio from the new pinocchio movie
Joshua and the promised land and ratatoing are prettier than this horrendous movie
Bruh the people in marmaduke looking like henry stickmans family.
Marmaduke doesn't talk or have inner thought bubbles so it's just an everyday family laughing and joking about their dog's odd behavior. When all is said and done, they love their dog.
im sorry but u look like one of those characters😶
Ngl....Danny kinda looks similar to the dad 💀
hello
What’s up has a better story and better animation
you should watch happily n"ever after its very ummmmm good?
Everyone is (rightfully) mad about the art/animation style, but what the everloving f*ck went wrong with the color grading?!   Not only is there no color concept, but it's like they tried to make everything stand out at all times, absolutely destroying any contrast or focal point - not to mention the overdone saturation...  Anyone making it through the entirety of this movie will simultaniously be suffering from mind-numbing boredom as well as sensory overload - really, great stuff for impressionable children 👏👏👏
My recommendation is to just stick with watching the 2010 live-action film of Marmaduke. There’s at least a lot more charm in that movie than this could ever achieve.
Bro, my school play has better acting 💀
Video made me laugh so hard 😂😂
6:02 the part I stopped watching the movie
What if, they make bad movies so that mediocre movies look good and good movies look great (Joke)
Can you collab with Dylan is in Trouble?
they made a more realistic marmaduke it was boring
Danny, after months, maybe even a year, I have finally become ✨TRULY GREG✨
Tbh I kinda like marmaduke is that wrong or weird 0~0
Try sea beast
So we gonna act like they didn’t steal the thunder and lightning bit from the rundown🧐
11:20 i would personally go for great depression or great dissapointment
Does anyone know why we can’t comment on Danny’s video: “unintentionally Terrifying Children's Videos” ? I can’t even add it to a playlist and it’s one of his funniest video
I watched marmaduke and i dont think it was bad...??? 😭
Who the fuck is Pete Davidson?
Whiplash is on Amazon Prime
You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life but this? Everything about it is terrible, who came up with this?
speaking of terrible movies, Danny have you ever heard of House Shark
i turned on notifications like 3 years ago and now i want to be truly greg
"The Pixarmom syndrome." Me: O.o
Danny, myself and all of his other fans are all living in a solipsistic reality that is one mind of a guy named Greg, dreaming up all of these reaction videos as well as the original videos themselves.  Greg doesn't know that his dreams are actually responsible for manifesting the lives of millions, and that his obsession with Danny (who doesn't actually exist) is the reason that I'm even able to post this comment (which doesn't exist either).
Honestly if you watch My sweet monster, you might as well change your mind 😭😭
Wtf is wrong with this audio it’s the same and doesn’t change based on the scenario it’s in 😭😭😭
Bruh
Even 1930 christmas cartoons have better graphics than this 2022 animated movie 💀
Dude I was forced against my will to watch this movie in music class because my music teacher was absent. It sucked.
are we not gonna talk about the way he broke the wall-
I saw a live action Marmaduke when I was younger, and it was actually pretty good, and I remember really enjoying it. But yeah, there is no way a studio can make this many bad movies at a time
i watched this high and i can genuinely say i’ve never laughed so hard
it’s giving me jimmy neutron
Is it only me, or is Danny's hair already turning gray?
They made us watch marmalade in gym class I wanted to freaking run out of that gym building lol
i turned on notifacations i am truly greggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
I’ll never grow up to be a real boy
I think they're buying low budget versions of movies
The original marmaduke was much better
I died
YES, is the answer to this question.
I am sorry, but I love this movie. Its hilarious
3:12 Chad Marmaduke
If you watch The Bread on YouTube, this movies animation looks exactly like it
I'm laughing do hard at how his mouth moves
the dog is ugly no question
I didn’t watch it
now watch the og marmaduke from 2010
The 2010 film marmaduke was liked by 68% of people The 2022 film marmaduke was liked by 4% of people. Just thought I’d let you know
At least there is a better live action one
Pixar when they are on a budget
I literally dont watch netflix anymore
React to monster family
I hated that movie, it was yucky, somehow, my 4 year old niece watched it twice, and tbh, I just couldn’t bare it anymore and told her that the movie was no longer available,ever, in fact it was deleted from the planet earth
the parents look related
Honestly, I watched this movie with my younger brothers. It was the worst thing I've ever seen but they seemed to love it
10:28 I’ve heard that background music used before can someone link it please?
At these very last day of school my teacher put on Marmaduke and let me tell you it is as bad as advertised
to be fair i was just talking to my brother once and my dog just randomly decided to start pooping with no signs of warning and i found that pretty hilarious
I like how with the opening, the text says “A ONE COOL ANIMATION production.” And it turns out the movie isn’t good
L video Sneako and Luke better
You missed the *?* at the end bozo
bro i was waiting for him to make fun of the animation the whole time. personally i think the animation COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE WORSE
The live action garfield movie is better than this crap
CHARISMA MAN   remember this comment if you truly wanna know if God is Real or not. read ALL of it, and hopefully know that JESUS CRHIST is the true God. screenshot it or keep this comment somewhere to read later. this should prove that Jesus is Real. JESUS CHRIST will Not make you take any mark, and He will punish the tyrannical ANTI Christ. The ANTI Christ will get a terrible wound, but cure himself to reinforce his deception to decieve the non-Christians and the lukewarm Christians. (look up lukewarm Christians on Christian websites and/or the Bible.) the AC will be world famous and very popular. he will make people take a mark on r hand or forhead. there will be a severe punishment for not taking it. The ANTI-Christ is a control freak, the opposite of Jesus Christ. Jesus uses His power for GOOD, NOT EVIL. This is BIBLE PROPHECY. Dont trust the false god, his goal is to get people into the lake of fire. he  will go there too, despite all the FALSE MIRACLES HE WILL DO! Repent of your sins to Jesus Christ before its too late, you could die today! if the bigbang was real sat turns ring particles should've moved too fast for ANY gravity. And thats not even taking into account the bigbangs hot temprature which shoulda vaporized anything. also there is too little antimatter in universe. if bigbang was real 99.99999999999999999999999999% of our universe should Not exist because antimatter destroys matter when it make contact with matter. the bang wouldve made much of it touch matter. so we see far less stars n stuff bc the so called bigbang wouldve destroyed nearly all of it.
This movie this movie wanted to be a Dreamworks movie but simply isnt
When Netflix makes animated movies their most likely for kids (Not counting anime) Netflix doesn’t care about the animation they know that the younger audience isn’t gonna understand if the animation is good or bad, they know that if it has bad jokes that are aimed for kids and weird characters, it’s a good movie. So there is a answer, these movies aren’t made for 20 year olds, it’s made for kids. It’s not supposed to be good. Remember my words: it’s made for little kids
I looooooove marmaduke
Fathherr when canni leef to be on my ownnna! I’ve got the whole WORLD tussy😫😫
BOUNTY, THE QUICKER PICKER UPPER
Marmaduke
the character design is so horrendous. like the way marmaduke's mouth moves when he talks makes me writhe in my skin
I think they do intentionally make stupid movies and shows specifically for kids and I think we're raising dumber kids because of it
Danny: this is the worst movie you will see all year  Me: I’ve seen “Killer Doughnuts” with MacDoesIt!! Bring it on 😎😎😎😎
You should react to Wayne. It’s ten episodes on YouTube and it’s something special
The sad part about this movie, which I _may_ never watch, is that it's just another film studio trying to milk a cartoon/comic strip that was loved by other generations. I've read only a handful of strips before, so I went onto the Go Comics website to read some of the earlier funnies. Being a comic established in the mid-1950s, Marmaduke has a lot of the charm that Lil' Folks (later known as Peanuts) had; classic one-liners along with a charming illustration.  I even read a couple of the newer strips, and it seems the comic still holds up to its legacy, even after its original author passed away seven years ago. However, the movie adaptation is horrendous. Disgusting humor, unbearable character design, and bland story telling. Blue Sky _nailed_ it with _the Peanuts Movie_ in 2015. With Craig and Bryan Schulz, son and grandson of Charles Schulz, in charge of the screenplay, every part of the movie was sculpted with care to ensure that it wasn't a soulless reboot, but a love letter to one of the greatest comic strip writers and illustrators of all time.  Getting back to Marmaduke, it's just a gimmick for mimic and cash. Blue Sky didn't incorporate any of today's modern humor, albeit, a few modern songs that felt surprisingly fitting, into _the Peanuts Movie,_ and stayed true to the humor Charles Schulz himself would've used in any of his other cartoons/strips. But _this?_ Brad Anderson wasn't even a _thought!_ It's just a generic, bad kid's movie with the shell of a wholesome comic that didn't deserve to be decimated by a bunch of rookies who animated this movie just to milk that cash cow. Boo. Stinky. Fart. Bad. This is comparable with Season 25 of Thomas the Tank Engine. Barf.
I love how you have a self portrait of yourself right behind you in the corner of your room. Pretentious Much! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Danny you should watch the movie Mars needs Moms
nobody: zeus: IM ⬇ SUPPOSED TO BE ↪ CHAMP⬇ION  ⬆
Art of story telling has gone out of moovies for some time now. Very few movies have a origional story line. Most seen one seen all these days. All bang flash boom run jump fight sex. Most moovies these days are the same plots but diferent acctors or genre.  Just makes them look like new moovi.
Woketardation
This is the second time Danny's talked about a movie with a rapping dog
Yo Danny my bad I accidentally made people think you are racist in my first 3 ever post
I was forced to watch the movie today
I subscribed and notifications on! Whoop whoop
I subscribed and turn on notifications in truly Greg
The characters look like veggie tales characters
I enjoyed the ads more than the excerpts if the movie
This feels like a movie I would leave on for my dogs while I run errands (they have some anxiety and will howl so I turn on PBS or a kids movie 🤣)
I feel like this is giving Ratatoing a run for it's money.
That "unleash thunder/lightning" line was from The Rundown, wtf?
We were forced to watch this movie I class. Everyone just simped for the thic mom
How is Ratatoing better than this
HOW THE FUCK IS THIS A NETFLIX MOVIE? THIS IS UTTER GARBAGE
why does this 2022 movie deadass look like a 2002 student project
i watched this movie recently with a friend and we were laughing at the garbage this  holds
this movie would of been a 100% if it ended when he got crushed
OMG i know im a bit late BUT I JUST REMEMBERED THIS MOVIE, ITS CALLED DINO TIME, youd recognise it with three kids and a pink dinosaur!!!
4:54 Didn’t know the movie likes Drew Gooden
We’re a family. We are an army. We are one guy. Named Greg.
I saw this movie when I was browsing netflix, I watched 30 seconds of the trailer and was like wtf is you going on.
The original Marmaduke had gotten 9% on rotten tomatoes, why did they think this was a good idea
Danny should make a video on Artemis Fowl. The movie is absolute trash.
Fun fact, Pinocchio a true story was made by a Russian studio
i’ve never, ever, seen characters so grotesquely designed and animated. and ive seen joshua and the promised land.
Forgot the question mark in the title of the video!
My mom tried to make me watch marmadude🥲
How the hell did J.K. Simmons get wrapped into this.
Marmaduke,i watched it with my mom i loved it- :(
12:07 sooo can anyone at netflix explain why all of the mean nasty cheerleaders are all black girls?? black girls bullying a ‘poor defenseless’ white girl?? ummm suspicious to say the least 🙄
React to zoom
Lol i kinda like marmaduke xd
Danny has the highest nose to arm ratio of anyone I’ve ever seen
I am Greg’s fallopian tubes
If disney and nickelodeon are going downhill then yes Netflix is just crap at this point.
This is like YouTube Kids but with a slightly higher budget and extended to an hour and a half long.
I watched marmaduke and i regretted it
I looked at Morbius and Marmaduke. Who was better? Morbius. That shows you that Netflix sometimes does not care about their kids' movies.
2:39 bro walks on toothpicks 💀
everything in this movie looks like plastic
Isn’t it a running joke that Marmaduke isn’t funny? Like, I’ve definitelly heard that being said in the Simpsons, and Two and Half Men and other media. So this movie holds up to its name at least.
I think that the dog knows English and the trainer knows woof.
Hey Danny you need to review aliens in the attic it’s bad lol
I will never understand why netflix cancels actually good shows and then decides to make the 25th kissing both movie or a shitty 3D animated movie. Like are they just doing it for the shits n giggles or are they working on a stragedy
“Dog training tips your trainer doesn’t want you to know…Beat the shit out of your dog”  Brooke Houts: write that down, write that down
this is probably the highlight of Peter Davidson's career
You probably won’t see this but your Billion surprise toy video has been marked for kids- Just informing you if you weren’t aware, have a good day! :]
im angry that they cancelled wings of fire, but the keep turning out this utter bullcrap
The Sea Beast was one of the only good MOVIES (not series bcus trinkets and bojack horseman etc) made by netflix lmfao
There is a live action version of this that has been around for years. It’s actually fine. That’s because it’s a completely different movie that also happens to have a large dog named Marmaduke.
Você parece o Cellbit
I am a child who liked this movie, it was actually kinda good.
I love your videos
PLEASE review Paws of Fury, its a 10 on the Whose All That Scale imo
One time my teacher had to leave so we had to go into another teacher’s classroom and they were watching this movie
Dammy Gonzales.
Yooo danny just barked for us... for free
i dont know why but the animation kinda reminds of that one weird johnny johnny video
Gotta blame the woke shit for influencing them. Netflix used to be the best media streaming source, but it just went to shit with the liberal and woke agendas.
They definitely are.
you should do a movie review on Air Buddies. The movie was literally my childhood but i rewatch now as a teenager… that movie is kind of weird
This guy looks like an ai
I can't be the only one who saw the 2d animation and thought how much BETTER IT WAS THEN THE MOVIE ANIMATION PLEASE OMG RE DO THE MOVIE BUT AT LEAST BWTTER LOOKING
Its a tax avoidance scheme. Look up Hollywood accounting. Its some sneaky shit and often why new actors get screwed out of money.
just wanted to let u know that ur auto generated captions r omitting swear words. u can fix that by going into youtube studio i think. small chance u see this but
Omg The Fartening scene wtf. WORSE, I'm laughing so hard their are tears in my eyes, bc I am mentally 12.
IF I SEE ONE MORE “don’t ready my name” IM GOING TO LOSE IT
I am one with the Greg
I watched this movie when it came out. I have to confirm that this movie is atrocious, and really disturbing. I reccomend watching it though, i dont know why. Please watch it. Please
That bulldog beats Goku
You should  make a video about a mouse  tale
no one is talking about the fact that the ending credits animation looks good, i don't understand why they didn't just use that instead of what ever this bs is-😭✋
No one's going to talk about the "dog trainers do it better" hat? aight
Why those the animation look like its from 2009?
I remember in like 2014 buying and watching the original live action Marmaduke and I loved it and I am not even kidding when I say that this made me sad
Imagine spending 4 years in college just to end up animating a dog taking a huge shit
Hey Danny can you watch FoodFight
they dropped k-on for this.
the voice acting looks like it came from a NFT movie
2:05 this is really nit-picky but what the fuck is going on with the dresser in the background?? It’s repeating itself and unaligned? I don’t think it’s a reflection mechanic because we are looking so close into the window. So weird ahhh
Day one asking Danny to do a review on the lion kid
Danny this is your worst video, and it isn’t because of you. It’s because of this movie. This movie made this video the worst one I’ve ever had to watch, and this is coming from someone who rewatched your movie knock offs series on repeat.
Has anyone ever told you you resemble Milo Manheim? He’s a Disney channel actor and I’ve been thinking you were in al these movies and realized that’s not you. Super resemble each other.
let's face it, we are running out of ideas.....for sure
I'm almost positive this is based on the original book and Marmaduke doesn't make it.
One of the biggest issues has been the shift from actual voice actors to any famous person the production can get their hands on
You know what’s funny? Pete Davidson is deadly allergic to dogs. I’m convinced he did this movie to take revenge on the canine population.
guy is literally danny
Kraig teem
Thank you, Danny, for making your analysis of this clearly phoned-in CGI flick utter comedy gold! You know it's phoned in when they couldn't simply Google what the family from the comic strip looked like and rendered those models. Nope, just bouncing eggs and weird straws with cheese wedge noses.
LMAO thats werid as hell
It’s funny
MARMADUKES A GOOD MOVIE
Why does Marmdduke's mouth hang like that? 😂 Like great dane's mouths don't hang that that low? 😂 And how did he do a trip around the world and back by himself? And then join the dog competition if he can't talk and they can't understand him... like did he just show up and his family just happened to be wearing fancy outfits? So many questions and no answers lmfao 😂🤣😂💀
Hu2
This movie is a money laundering scheme
Shhhhhhhhhhhehehehehehheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehehehehehehehehehehehsshshhshshshshshshhs
Das beste Video das ich gerade sehe  Eure Bundesrepublik Deutschland
this was one of the funniest vids ive watched, thanks drew
I used to love the original 2010 Marmaduke
one time my stepdad threw our dog down the stairs. hes not a dog trainer though.
So six minutes in, and he's talked about the dad's wet spaghetti arms, but not the mom's worst pear shaped body in any cartoon ever, and tiny tiny feet that could never support her body?
Not only is the plot horrible but the animation! As a drawer this is very painful to watch it looks like knock-off pics art animation, adn people crushing over dogs 🗿the characters are very disturbing looking and the sound affects make me wanna legit cry and the characters look like they r moaning sometimes to. Sorry for the long opinion but have a good time reading this 🦖🦖🦖
because its all political now. if theres a white character, they need to replace with black. if there is a man who dont fuck alot, they need to replace it with a sexually liberated twat. its very political rather then story specific anymore. i guess this will make many people go outside.
Marmaduke killed princess Diana.
Anything with Pete Davidson is going to be bad
Yo Buzz Lightyear
its 4am where i am and i have a fever therefore i am convinced that this video and this animation is a fever nightmare  im leaving this comment on the off chance that im wrong
Could u rwview food fight its a crappy but funny animation
Somebody needs to powerscale that bulldog
Not only is it bad, but the cgi was worse then I thought
Yeah, that area probably is permanently off-limits. The actual name for contaminated land is “brownfield,” which is exactly on par with the jokes in this film.
this looks like the type of movie my teacher would play on the projector when there are no lessons
The live action marmaduke was way better
The CGI and everything else in the movie is trash it self. Perhaps worster than trash it's self.
I am truly greg
Bro there making stuff like this but they turned down wings of fire. Like heyyy Disney prime multi million dollar companies there’s  huge potential out there!
I love how he just stares into your soul
Dude you NEED to watch the zombies films.
I made my sis watch this
Shame on Danny for disrespecting this cinematic masterpiece. This is the most beautiful thing I have ever laid my eyes upon. The trainer is used to represent greedy tycoons, he views himself as superior to everyone else. Using them to gain money and power, shown in the scene were they get billed. And the scene of the trainer beating up Marmaduke is used to mock movies such as karate kid. the bulldog didn't win because of corrupt judges and racism. Another thing that made this movie great is that Zeus in the end didn't do much wrong. He is another case of nature vs nurture were he was taught to be how he is. This was never how his life would have ended up if it wasn't because of his darn trainer. This movie is a commentary and it tells a story about a dog dealing with abusive owners, trying to win a competition against malnourished dogs who seem to be living a paradise but aren't really and corruption in the dog show department. This truly is the film of a century. Dare I say better than morbius.
Isn't this a remake of a live action movie, could swore I saw something like this with that same dog but not animated
netflix pulled a knockoff forrest gump with the run... i cry to the fact that these two movies have that relation smh
Marmaduke is just a ripped off version of garfield.
The characters remind me of the people from fanboy and chumchum
Any troublemakers here
Skete’s a bum Kanye is better
I’M LAUGHING SO HARD AT “BOUNCING EGG”
U haaaave  To do lamagetton its a alien lama killing  a bunch of college kids And theres a dude who changes shirts every Cut
Drink a mixture of clorox bleach and drain cleaner after watching the movie or before
This dog's fart obsession is very innapproprite for kids. I can't stand these animation sticks arms and legs
100% some sort of fetish show idfk
bad seems to garner more attention. more attention garners more money. people love watching laughably bad things
I’m trying so hard to hold onto hope for Netflix. They had awesome shows/movies and idk wtf happened. It’s like the MCU…
Guy looks like william afton
i’m literally laughing out loud💀💀💀
They made me watch marmaduke in my 7th grade history class and the hole time i was cringing
I searched up if Greg was the fastest army…  -Edit it actually says its u lol
I mean the dog caused a chemical weapon so he deserves to be shamed for all the family’s hardships
When Danny said you “not so Great Dane”I was like WHAT
I genuinely did not have fun watching this video and by the end I was upset and unsatisfied. I hate this movie
Ain’t no way that when the dog farted my room smelled like fart. That must’ve been one nasty fart ew.
They don’t even follow the plot of the original Marmaduke movie
Netflix simply is just not the same as it was back in the day, now we got Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, etc, etc, Netflix simply is not able to compete with these bigger studios
My new catchphrase: *Diggity Dang That Dog!*
sea beast
definitely avoided this movie bc marmaduke was one of my favorite comics to read in the newspaper when i was younger and knew it would ruin my perception of that menace but jfc this movie is horrendous
they should've put marmaduke down years ago tbh
I think the trainer understands the dogs language and so that’s how they talk to each other because the dog understands English
Trash. That’s what I think.
😂😂
I don’t think he realises a shitsu is a actual bred
Guy got in a movie so you know Greg is gonna get in a movie soon
Why am i greg/?
2:13
so this is why my subscription is like $20 a month 🤨
Someone gotta fill the straight to dvd void
*how did i just notice he has a picture of himself drinking water on his wall*
Man really punched a hole in the wall didn’t he
I am now greg
Hey danny, I wanna know how much bank your making with all of your views? Also this movie looks like it was supposed to come out in 2005
This movie looks pretty good   Compared to a bugs life
I’ve seen so many weird Netflix movies. I also Recall seeing a movie on Netflix called pets united. Can’t remember too much from it but I remember it being so weird, as well as the pets looking really scary. Also love your videos!
The ORIGINAL MARMADUKE. GOD. CHILDHOOD MOVIE. man, shit so good
My mom played this for her special ed class...
Not to brag but my kids have watched this movie 😂😩 but most of the bad kids movies you’ve talked about my kids have seen and  they like watching your commentary on them.
2:00 that shit looks like one of hydraulic beanbag's animations
You make me laugh I died because I laughed to hard
3:16
Can he understand Marmaduke because he's a dog whisperer?
Hot diggity dang that dog
My sister is obsessed with this movie
What that dog doing
I trust marmaduke with my data
Can’t waeight till next holloween . Spooky grandpaw
man you're growing fast. last week you had 4M no you have over 5M
Danny check up on varli
I literally never understand why bad movies think farts and eating too much food is like the funniest thing ever. I swear it always matches the same awful quality of animation too, just.. who tf is making these movies I’m genuinely so concerned
The live action marmaduke was meh but better than the animation one.I think he should’ve been left behind to the newspaper comics.
The Marmaduke almost-dying ending is giving Goat Story
Bad movies get talked abt? Ig??? Maybe that's what their after 😑
I have come to ease ur worries young Padawan.  _yes_  _yes they absolutely are_  🤣🤣🤣 Stop questioning it you'll summon the *CAT PEOPLE*
Bruh does no one remember the live action Marmaduke?
istg if you dont review zombies i will eat your FAMILY 😡
Iirc, the villain dog is actually voiced by J.K Simmons. Which is why the voice acting for him is actually pretty good.  Edit: Looked it up, and yes, Zeus is voiced by J.K Simmons.
Nice shirt, Greg
my english teacher played this movie before the end of school
i think we have some The Writer's Barely Disguised Fetish in here. i mean i admit it's kinda hard for me to tell bad toilet humor from that but i feel like at this severity it probably is that
A
He turned that dog show into Chernobyl 2.0
20:48 "the fastest speeds" as lower speeds while connected appear
MarmaDuke is garbage
Danny, you should review Let It Shine, it would be pretty hard to make fun of it because it's an amazing movie
dad's neck is so thin that in the home page of youtube, he's a floating head
Am I i the only person that couldn’t find the movie on Netflix.??
DiGgItY dAnG dAt DoG
These characters are the exact argument for why they have rules you have to follow when drawing people.
the characters make me want to gouge my own eyes out
I don't want to watch this video but I'm here for Danny I thi k he needs some emotional support
3:23 Maybe we need to enroll marmaduke in obedience- *Takes a explosion point blank to the face.*
Marmaduke is terrible
did he fr punch a hole in his wall i genuinely cant tell LOL
The original marmaduke was so much better
Marmaduke will beat the fuck out of you if you don’t stop cussing 🤬
Danny Gonzalez YouTube Channel >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Ratatoing> What’s Up> Square Pumpkin> Panda Fighter>>> Marmaduke >> Zapped> Radio Rebel> Plan Bee>Camp Rock
3:14 are we going to ignore that 💀
Seeing this hideous representation of what the original marmaduke was is painful
okok. But man vs bee is the BEST netflix "movie" of the year.
I like one thing about this movie, it reminds me of old children, pixar type movies from 2000. That's it.
I watched this movie last night. Guy sings a song. God.
Hot diggity that dog
Did the mom have fucking jiggle physics????
Encanto & turning red was better than this…   *and that says a lot*
The most surprising thing about this is that Pete Davidson voices the dog. I still can’t even believe that he would agree to do this.
Unsubscribe from Netflix and find something better. Their shows/ movies are either outdated, repeats or just SUCK!
true
You should review the anime called Edens zero it’s really good anime and I bet you’d love to review it Please do or else the consequences will be untidy
Can you watch big fish and we are family 2016?
Let's put it this way: If you pick up a 100+ movies that no other streaming service would pick up, they can now advertise that they have 100+ moves that no other service has.
I’m sorry, but I get bored with movies with abysmal animation, to where I fall asleep. After watching Saberspark for a while, it kinda helps to know the difference
I Greg yes
My name isn't Greg👁️👄👁️
Why does the dog trainer look like a rejected tumblr sexy man
Bro we are no longer in the 1990's why is the animation quality so bad ? lol
Do you think they had Pete at hun point for this whole thing or what
i just realized that the picture on the wall is Danny using an inhaler, not him drinking milk from a very wide glass.
Danny: the trainer is not that bad, he's a little greedy, but he's not the bad guy. Also Danny: the trainer beats the shit out of Marmaduke.
A
I did not need to learn about the marmaduke exclusion zone today
It's Foodfight all over again
I HATE Marmaduke
Nobody is ever going to see this comment, but if anyone does: I don't think this video is as bad as I've seen people say it is. I saw some people on tiktok saying this was low effort content on Danny's part, but I don't necessarily agree. I thought it was pretty funny.
i jus realized your the guy who made the in love with a creeper song😭😭
I watched this movie dude, there was a crack chihuahua named I don’t even remember. 😭
imagine doing so bad at your job people think you do it on purpose
This is random AF but I liked seeing you as a villain in that PUBG corridor video. You would do well as a villain in a horror movie I think. I can almost see you coming back for the last time at the end of the movie for a jumpscare.
Friendly reminder: this movie has a post credits scene
the animation is so lazy, the lemon that lay on the plate with the chicken clipped through the plate, but I guess that doesn't matter because it's for "dumb kids" or whatever the directors thought
Ig Bad is the new good...i mean if people (specially ytbers & influencers)  are talking about it guess it doing its job
Even if it's a movie for cids it should be somehow intelectually stimulating. As a former child I gotta say that children are not completely stupid and would laugh at anything, they're just uneducated.
Marmaduke is NOT gonna be the worst movie i've seen this year. Because I will not see it.
At this point they are
Mr. Gonzalez, Netflix isn't even making them, they're putting them on the show.
There is *ONE* good thing to say about this movie tho. The narrator is pretty good
Cool
this has to be a fart fetish movie
Netflix shot itself in the foot when they made Marmaduke, then instead of going to the doctor it shot itself in the other foot by making Resident Evil.
This movie looks like every hideous commercial of the past 3 years. Kill it with napalm.
Well, after such a good movie as Morbius, nothing will seem good.
THEY BUTCHERED SUCH A PEAK MOVIE NOOOOOOO
Can you continue playing gta5
Just letting you guys know pete davidson is actually in this and its still on Netflix
Bro the Marmaduke 2010 live action was absolutely my childhood, they did him so dirty with this ong---
Anyone know the name of the shirt Danny’s wearing?
U should do a video on teen beach movie
The way the animate the characters reminds me of the terrible Adam's Family movies
Actually I saw a cheerleader at the dog competition
jesus those characters are so fkin ugly
Most of the good actors are dead, but really the agenda is to just keep you distracted until about 2030....
dog set off a chernobyl fart-
As a dog trainer, you must assert your dominance.
The old live action/CGI Marmaduke was actually pretty ok unlike this one
Marmaduke is a remake of a movie or TV show of the same name from my parents (boomer generation). Kinda like "Lassie". It might have been from his parents generation that was born after WW1. They (Hollywood) are remaking everything from the last 100 years. You could also say that almost of of their stories are a take on Shakespeare, Milton, and Dante.
If I'm not mistaken Marmaduke is the name of another movie about a dog, not to mention the dogs look pretty simular
lowkey sounds like the best movie of all time
My parents forced me and my 3 little siblings to watch it and my stepmom loved it
i feel like the characters are either on high amounts of plutonium, they were exposed to high amounts of radiation but somehow survived and turned into these abominations, they are the spawn of satan manifested from hell itself or there design is based of the "evolved to survive a car crash human" model
Marmaduke is a re-make of a live action film from 2010. Owen Wilson was the original Marmaduke voice .
Bro I swear I thought the dad said dignity ding dat dog
i love that the scene where he slapped the shit out of the dog they just moves a png around the screen
I actually went and watched the movie after I saw this video, and if I'm being honest, I think Danny got a few things wrong: 1. Guy and Marmaduke do not have conversations. Marmaduke says one thing, and then Guy says something entirely unrelated to what Marmaduke said.  2. Not all of the designs are horrible. The clown at the beginning is pretty cool. During the tidal wave, he makes a life jacket out of balloons, which made me laugh. Everyone else looks like if Captain Underpants was a bootleg Microsoft game from 1994. 3. He didn't bring up the reporter I hate the goddamn reporter why does she move like that That aside, I think it's not as bad as he made it out to be. I'd give it a 3/10 because what Danny doesn't tell you is that during Marmaduke's performance, he, the dog and the cat do a small dance number, which is a bit awful, but the shih tzu and the poodle do the Gangnam Style dance and it looks funny as all hell. It's only a 3 though because the rest of it was still horrid and I could have been watching Kung Fu Panda 3, which has Bryan Cranston playing Po's dad, which I found especially cool since I'm going through a Vince Gilligan phase right now. Anyways, the video is pretty funny and I laughed. Thanks Dan
Now that I know it’s on Netflix, you know of one kid who’s seen this movie (and thoroughly suffered through it)
did you not see the sea beast? its an epic movie
Bow I know why people are leaving Netflix
Of course the only not grotesque looking character is a billionaire tumblr sexyman (though that doesn't mean he looks good either)
God loves you, please turn to God and not sin!
The
This movie looks so bad, that it makes the live action one from the 00s look like a masterpiece 😆
The animation genuinely looks like it's from the early 2000s
i  have watched it
Okay but the original marmaduke was amazing please judge that one its about a dog with mental disorders who saves the day by farting if i remember
It's all about Hulu kid
hey danny my girlfriend said she was bored and wanted to tell you to upload so please upload soon
If your dog pulls out "thunder and lightning" then you can kick the dog. Clearly they are not an animal, but a combatant... a  challenger!
Zeus is creepy looking
Hey Greg!
11:59 "Hi welcome to Chernobyl"
I miss peanut.
8:56 "this is what pyrocynical is into"
Why is the animation both good and awful
A few years ago my daughter had us watch Spookly...now she had us watch Marmaduke.. I'm starting to suspect she likes to watch us suffer or something
reminds me of that cryptocurrency movie.
Please watch Kung Pow next. It's cursed
Not pete
Pls do a muvie review pls😢u haven't done this for so long
Danny roasting the dude's nose as if his looks as pointy if not MORE
First seen looks like it’s straight outta veggie tales
Some body needs to make a bunch of ironic movies that look and act a little bit like marmaduke
Why did they animate the beloved Marmaduke the og was fine
It's kind of funny that the character who literally did the "kick the dog" trope isn't even the villain.
React to “charmers” on YouTube
I prefer the one with Owen Willson
the animation on this movie is so bad i cant even watch, let alone the horrid sped up? quality to it all. this feels like a movie made for toddlers who have horrible body expectations
thats cap, they just made the gray man and its amazing
This dude looks like a 9year old
9:15 is my favorite section of the video
i would literally rather watch rat tattooing or whatever that movie was called
This is actually based on a comic strip I believe¿  there was another marmaduke movie in 2010 and it was also bad
I think Netflix also sometimes struggles with making kid sequences, for instance, squid game (adult and great) don’t f with cats (great but adult) maybe 1 or 2 of their kid movies are probably fine but they definitely specialize in adult content.
Movie reaction suggestion: Minutemen
The dad kind of looks like Danny. Wait…Danny has a song about being called Daddy…is Danny Marmaduke’s dad???
tbh with all the sharks marmaduke has to face in the movie, im surprised his talent isn’t beating up a shark…
17:50 bruh what?!!
Why is Guy kinda...
This doesn’t even look like it came from Netflix. I said that the Hype House show looks like something Hulu would do, Marmaduke looks like something Tubi would do
In my opinion, the live action one is better, it may not be the best rated movie to my knowledge but it’s likable
The Live action Marmaduke that came out when I was a kid was awesome. But this virson is just embarrassing.
14:05 who the fuck is this cat??
12:20 that’s such a good edit…i say hoping Danny didn’t abuse his wall
Yes
7:23 IS THAT A SHARK?! 🦈
6:06 im sorry did he just speak to the dog??
3:40 omg no he really does look like a kangaroo 🦘 😭 😂
Ok. So I thought it looked like a good movie by the front cover but it just couldn’t bother watching it.. until I saw this video  😃 Netflix probably makes these bad movies because they know SOMEONE in the world will watch it!
It is funnyly cringey
I just realized ur that guy from vine
The company is headed by wokesters, so of course they're going to produce shitty content.
Nah this movie also copied talking Ben
i almost laughed at the part where he fucking farted and released a poison cloud the size of the dog competition area
These are some of the movies ever. The production crew produces in more ways than 1. Cinematic movies. Most of the movies ever are made out of pictures.
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO DO THIS
I think the first movie was for children
Okay, I just watched this movie and I think this would be right up your alley.  Please react to "A Magical Journey."  Yes, that's the name of the movie. It starts off decently (I guess) but just throws a lot of plot out the window and just throws random idiocy in your face at times. Seems like a good time.  For us subscribers, I mean. For you, it sounds like a terrible time.
Low budget bad movies, but good shows- damn-
4:19 this face says it all lol
marmeduke a movie from the 2010’s, It’s live action, and had a 9% on rotten tomatoes.  So basically these mf’s stole a movie from the 2010’s and made it even shittier, wow!
Each day I am thankful that I ignored it the second I saw that face
e
why is 6:35 kinda a banger
Why the people look like slender mans brothers and sisters
These films are just elaborate money laundering schemes
they made a animated the original movie and it must be really bad
The biggest sin of this movie is having a character named Guy who isn’t voiced/played by Ryan Reynolds
This is kinda random but i think that u should make a new troom troom video about the zombie apocalypse videos that they made. They're pretty bad...
Who did the animation for this? It's just awful, like the voice acting.
My teacher put this movie cause she knew the class would roast it lol
Alright so, I would say I'm fairly good at reading intentions and shit Here's my take on what they were trying to do:  The 3 things the studio thinks kids like: Dogs, potty humour, over-exaggerated fx. On that last note, I have been seeing a lot of movies lately going for a "3D caricature artstyle" approach to body design (that is, over-exaggerated features).  Taking all of this in, this movie is clearly for iPad kids. You know, the ones that watch YouTube kids shit. Similar movies from our childhood (1 big example being Madagascar) have this weird pacing that anyone older than like 7 will notice. Everything happens instantly and there isn't a plot really.  They didn't want to make a good movie, just a movie that will distract kids. We live in dark times where a studio doesn't have to spend extra time thinking up something that can be fun for parents, and only fun for kids so that the parents don't have to watch their kids as they watch the movie.
WHAT IS UP WITH THE MOM CHAR!!! WHY IS SHE OBSURDLY THICC
Pete Davidson? Kanye’s least favorite movie
Netflix isn't the first to fail this way, but they still make bad movies in general. In movie history (not just Netflix), movies based off of newspaper comics have NEVER been successful, with three exceptions: Dick Tracy (1990), Dennis the Menace (1993), and Over the Hedge (2006). Every other adaptation has failed miserably, just like the first Marmaduke (2010), and this Marmaduke, made TWELVE years after the first failure.
how can you ruin Marmaduke? the original was one of the best dog movies ever...
I took one look at the thumbnail...and it looks like same style the animated advertisements use for KingSoopers and Grubhub, it's so appallingly soulless.
Ok but the audience reviews on rotten tomatoes comparing it to morbius make this worth the effort of making
Please keep making these awful movies vids! They're my comfort vids
im glad that movies are still showing the stereotype of the "bad dog" (by the way a great dane is a really smart breed) and has no commentary about how irresponsible these people are if they couldn't actually raise it (since it's an adult) XD and sure its a talking dog, so technically they have a bit more freedom but still they are actually covering some dog "training"
I'll tell you why - putting diversity over talent
Ooohhh I thought marmaduke was a good movie 😵😵
"This movie is just heinous!" Best review I've heard this year!
This movies looks like something from redbox they have awful animated movies that nobody has heard of and I seen some of them. Shouldn't the trainer be arrested by the police for animal abuse? Also why is the dog so skinny?
idk if anyone had said this yet but I think maraduke is just a low budget version of mamaduke ;(   (everyone’s childhood movies becoming worse now lol)
I call Netflix one take movies. They are so cheap the actors do one take and sound like they are reading cue cards.
idk how but they shrink wrapped a rig. honestly impressed in the worst way possible.
I like marmaduke
They are bad
Kicking the dog is less worse than kicking the baby
I am a child that has watched marmaduke
You guys should watch "extraordinary attorney woo young woo". Its really good. Its about an autistic attorney who's mom abandoned them. The beginning might be a bit boring but they will get better! I literally am in love with this
Nice hi
"and luckily I was right. He kicks the dog" then comes a febreeze commercial.
isnt marmaduke a real movie thats good like its my childhood
I subscribed like a week ago after my brother sent me a link to your channel and I can’t stop watching your content now lol. I just now turned on my notifications tho so I’m OFFICIALLY Greg 🤙🏼🤌🏼
My baby sister watched this movie-
Not ALL Netflix movies are bad, tho. Wish Dragon and Duck Duck Goose are masterpieces, but Netflix spent very little work on them and trusted the companies who actually worked on the movies to do most of the work. Netflix usually takes credit for stuff they don't do much work on. Duck Duck Goose is from a studio called "Origin" which is like a design company, but can also make animated movies. Yeah, Marmaduke is a dumb movie but it was Hollywood U.S based, and the creators had no experience.
Hey Danny you know that the new Pinocchio movie was made in Russia and Netflix just dubbed it right?
why is he calling me greg
My siblings watched this.  In the few scenes that I saw, i hated it.
Pete Davidson got famous for literally no reason. Bad actor, ugly, unfunny. If that’s the criteria then I think I might have a shot at fame.
3 out of 10
The thunder and lightning thing is a reference to a actually good and funny movie called the rundown
pls tell me this isnt real
What the dog doi-
Bro why didn’t you put in the Mexican dog named Pedro that had to resist eating a taco that is crazy
Father, when can I leave to be on my oWwWn? I’ve got the whole WOrLD dussy!
PLEASE REACT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL you won’t regret it’s amazing
Bro I was forced to watch this shit in school
I watched the first 10 minutes of this film and just stopped watching. This movie basically sucks and my mom also agrees.
Perhaps we are getting old and kids movies just seem worse?
Nah, the original Marmaduke is live-action and is pretty cute. They had to go and ruin it with whatever this is
I didn't even know this undescribable movie even existed
My ending:marmaduke  gets a funeral and the last moments of the movie is the funeral and the secret credit thing is just a funeral song
danny: this is the worst movie youll watch this year me: is that a challenge?
original marmaduke was ok but this just makes me kinda want to death
I think that these movies are dubbed from another language (the mouth not lining up with words at all) and low budget. Maybe the only reason a pop figure is related at all is because Netflix has the budget to get someone well known to do the voice-over.
This can't be real, the animation looks like a independent children's youtube channel or one of those great value Kung fu panda movies. IT MAKES ME SICK
Danny looks like the sunburned nose movie dad
Idk What Netflix Was Thinking. I feel like they were a bit like LG Trying to throw ideas against the wall for this specific movie. They do have good shows and movies Like Hilda, Paranormal Park, and The Mitchells Vs The Machines but this one? Why Netflix Why?
That fart scene HAS to be the result of the writer’s fetish 🤢 I can’t believe they’d put that in a children’s movie. Ew.
its hard to focus on the video when danny has the freshest haircut ive seen all year
My younger brother watched this a few months ago and I walked in when he was in the rain. This is always going to be the worst movie ever.
I know you won't see this, but other readers could you please help suggest reacting to 'Too old for fairlytales'? Its on netflix.
wasn't marmaduke a movie with owen wilson or something? i remember loving it. it wasn't a cartoon though
Scott made a similar video today and it is just as good (that's a compliment)
The live action is way better sorry
marmaduke is a fucking bio weapon im telling you, the family was forced to take care of this absolute fucking war crime, im telling you how can a dog fucking fart that much, i wouldn’t be surprised if marmadukes flatulence is tear gas,
I know that this isn't related to the video but last night I had a weird nightmare about Danny where he drugged everyone eating at this one unnamed restaurant and after everyone recovered in a random house I've never seen before Danny broke in to kidnap the children in this recovery house but they ended up scaring him away with weapons that literally came out of nowhere... it was very weird and I have no idea where it came from
my little red haired cousins love this movie and they decided to put this on while they were at my house  and i swear to god the fart joke thing the worse part
Wtf is Danny aging!? He can't do that, what the fuck.
danny… we all think your from georgia
they spent a total of three dollars on the animation
Your saying hard work is bad the people made that to entertain others and it took them a lot of work to put it together it's your opinion to think it's bad the more videos you make similar to this the more haters and dislikes you will get because people disagreeing and I disagree too also don't say swear to god that they're doing it on purpose Shame on you!!!! Your mean to a good movie your opinion is horrible and your not funny to me your horrible! You are horrible!!!
This made me laugh so hard.
I’m GREG now!
the real marmaduke from 2010 voiced by owen wilson would beat the shit out of this fake ass marmaduke from 2022 voiced by pete davidson
Wasn’t Marmaduke also a movie about a german shepherd voiced by Dwayne Johnson or something? I remember seeing a preview of it on the dvd for Tooth Fairy (Another movie with Dwayne Johnson)
Animation is pretty much dying and it's impossible to make a hit nowadays
8:13 Somes up the movie
I finally got Nordvpn🤷🏽‍♀️
Jesus loves you
"I'm gonna be honest I don't a single kid has watched this" me, a 12 year old, regretting watching this movie a while a go.
2:38 SLENDERMAN
the girl's voice acting is too genuine for me to not believe they actually tied her in a basement and forced her to act the poor girl  edit: *sigh* yes, my most liked comment comes from a video about the marmaduke animated film
Monster House is an underrated masterpiece
I hate to tell you this but the kid I babysit made me watch this movie with him he's 8. the kid loved it ....
I hate these character designs
I am now a Greg 👍
its so weird, its a new movie but looks like it could be from the early 2000s
There is a new movie called “my sweet Monster” and the guy that played Pinocchio is in it and it so bad
AAAA
I'm concerned about what people are letting there children be exposed to
I watched this movie in a mental hospital not long ago and I was hoping Danny would make fun of it bc I was and the whole unit was laughing except the guy that picked it, he was pretty upset
The character models are if the fat characters from fanboy and chum chum have a kid with the adams family thin characters
Even the Toy story movie was better animated than this thing.
do not wacth bad movies
They put this on my school in a rainy day, i have a friend who is a really big fan of animating, and they were just criticizing the movie the whole way through.
You gave the movie so much free advertisement that Netflix actually posted it first on the main page lol
They've probably produced like, 3 good movies
Daniel, please review Zombies 1, Zombies 2, and Zombies 3 on Disney +. You will find good content in them.
The original Marmaduke movie was amazing for a kids movie
I came downstairs to my little brother watching Marmaduke and it just looked like a shitpost
Netflix's execs throw money at anything these days. Where's the financial responsibility?
Every scene is so empty! They only show exactly what is supposed to be looked at, no background objects at all.
I swear this marmaduke is some sort of god that can manipulate all of reality to his will
I want to have a realistic movie which is going to be much more better than the actual movie cuz you're going to be realistic not what you don't have to worry about drawings
I mean I do like Marmaduke and plus you're going to have a new Marmaduke that's going to be much more better a thousand times better cuz like the other Marmaduke is trash heard about to come up with a new Marmaduke movie which by killer seems nice
I literally watched about 30sec of Marmaduke and immediately understood
I liked it 😐
bro is this dogs fart worse then the Chernobyl disaster
There was a marmaduke before this it was live-action and better.
its amazing how netflix makes stranger things and then this
the original marmaduke from like early 2000’s was one of my favourite movies as a kid. i didnt even know they made this. now people will only know marmaduke as this. sad times
That carhartt shirt tho
I believe Netflix is just getting rid of there back catalogue of bad animated movies and honestly they should just give those movies to tubi or something cuz Jesus Christ
"my dog stepped on a bee"
ok, but the mom... hear me out...
My sister watched Marmaduke and thought it was funny. All i did was silently criticise it. Terrible animation, terrible plot, etc.
Marmaduke is the movie of all time
I tried to get my cousin to watch this movie and the dog scared the hell out of him😂
pinocchio is zesty
There is a different movie called Marmaduke with a Great Dane as the rain character that is clumsy
I completely forgot about the comic that this is based off of.  I think it makes it worse knowing that
The white dog looks like an elf from lotr
imagine the mom throwing it back
this movie is so bad i can’t tell if it’s trying to be the animated version of the original or not
“What’s up Greg, I hope you are having a Great Dane” is what I really wish he said
Why does the main character half to sound gay .it's Pete Davidson what do you expect, he is a terrible actor
QUICK THE QUICKER PICKER UPPER
Pete is terrible but he's nailing Kim, who will nail anyone.
Who at netflix said "Let's make a lower budget, shittier version of an already bad movie from 12 years ago"
Why would they do this to Marmaduke :(   The early 2000s Marmaduke movie is by far my favorite movie, so to see this heineous version of it is appalling. :(
I feel like they are making these just to pad out their kids line up hoping kids won't care about the low quality
8:35 nah bro there all just furrys.
“Everything woke eventually turns to shit” — President Trump, right again
And also wow that fog must be BIG if he created a mini tsunami in a pool
I would rather the old marmaduke then that 💩
I been weak for at least 25 mins, it’s the “YOU STUPID FUCKING DOG!” For me I couldn’t take it 🤣😂
holy fucking shit man looking at this movie just gave me a migraine why does it look so bad
Okay wait is this based on the comic strip character? Or just some other dog with the same name?
Thor love and thunder was terrible
Marmaduke's last words being "uh oh" followed by the lamest eulogy ever would have made this movie a masterpiece.
Shih tzu aren't a bad breed I have a toy poodle x shih tzu he's 10kg and looks like a staffy x golden lab puppy.
markiplier once said: "congratulations, you have weapons-grade flatulence"
im surprised danny didnt know marmaduke is a live action movie, and this is a poor adaptation on i
6:00 Right paw Hospital , Left Paw Cemetary
The actual marmaduke movie was a staple of my childhood and this has completely ruined it. I am genuinely sad now
I watched a few minutes of “Marmaduke” before people started talking about it, i could not stand it it was so bad!
fun fact when you look up pete davidson this movie doesn’t come up
Yes they are making bad movies on purpose. The person who pays for a movie to be made at all is free to decide whether they want to make alot of money from creating an enjoyable experience or instead want to spend alot of money to brainwash people with woke propaganda. They know fully well that these are mutually exclusive goals and decide to go with propaganda anyway. Those are the facts. The speculation is that they must get secret funding and favors to offset the massive box office losses.
The sad thing is that my sister actually enjoyed this movie and this really just tells you about this generation
so good I had to watch it twice     (the video not the movie if didn't get)
There was a live action version of this and honestly, it’s way better.
This video is better than the movie
I have to agree with the marmaduke movie I had to watch it on repeat because of my little cousin and is the reason I don’t spend time watching movies with my family
The animation tho 💀
I LOVED the live-action marmaduke movie as a kid, so I refuse to watch the 2022 version because it'll ruin my childhood
nice
7:23 Did Guy find a megladon? Why does he have a megaladon?
Marmaduke was a good movie😡
This film indeed sucks! Netflix thinks it's cheaper to make bad animated tales rather than good animated tales 😒
My little sister watched this- and I only saw small bits of it.. and even that was like dumping salt in my nose, eyes , and ears! Oh and the cut on my finger 👌👄👌
Daily reminder: You're not useless. You're not a dissapointment. You're not dumb. You're not different. You're not compared to anyone. Because... You're loved. You're strong. You're smart. You're beautiful inside and out. You're the best version of YOU there ever is. and you're human. I know you're going through a lot of stuff right now but it'll be okay. This life is a long journey. In a journey, there are ups and downs. If you ever go down, it doesn't mean you can't go back up. Rest easy and give yourself a treat :) I love you very very much and I just want you to know that.💕And when you go back up, you have that space in your heart that can help others back up, as well
and to think that Netflix are the same guys that produced Klaus. They'll just let anyone make a movie won't they?
you would be good at cinemasins
The 2010 marmaduke movie is actually really good but the one now…
How the fuck did they get Pete Davidson to be the main character. Netflix spent there yearly budget on this nightmare
Danny.... Make another badads... The play store is being overtaken by "play to win money" games...
yes.
I remember the time I accidentally watched that movie. I am now in therapy 😌
That's a smooth cut there Danny. 8:51
Ok but the 2010 Marmaduke was lit it's live action but it's awesome awesome story you should watch it
Express VPN kinda dookie. I personally use TorGuard and the speeds are seriously 4x the speeds of Express
Wait didn’t Marmaduke come out years ago? And it was actually good. Now they’re remaking it and it’s awful?
Marmaduke is a good movie  Why don't you support it? I'm unsubbing Even tho it's a little weird it's pretty cool
Might have needed to make a movie in order to hold onto the character. The trademark or copyright or whatever.
I already have a hate for Marmaduke. I found out my childhood dog died while watching the 2010 one. I never finished it.
not so great dane causes chernobyl 2.0, instantly regrets it.
The original marmaduke was a good movie
Thats the ceasar milan dog training method
Pls play minecraft
Do you have sister
CRACKHEAD CRACKHEAD
Just so everyone knows, IMDB has this movie at 4.7
the og marmaduke was so good. why did they try to remake it ://
this looks exactly like the same studio who made ratatoing 😭😭😭
I feel like that all those scenes about Marmaduke farting, especially the trophy one, we're directed by someone with hyper specific fetishes.
I feel like if this movie was given more effort and a higher budget it would've been like a solid 3    Edit: Wait nevermind
Me and my class had to watch marmaduke with the preschoolers and kindergarteners last year 😭
I'm Greg now!
There was a different live action marmaduke that (from what I remember) was one of my favorite movies  This movie is ass
“ROLL THE CREDITS ROLE T-“ “Ah n2 he’s alive-
literally everything from Netflix is ass thats why i dont use this service
"Marmaduke is a steaming pile of movie. If you step in this movie, you’ll need a stick to scrape squished Marmaduke from the treads of your shoes. As the saying goes, you can’t polish a turd – but it doesn’t seem like anyone here even tried." - Allen Adams, The Maine Edge
13:04 BYEEE "$123.45." "4:99" (no money sign of course 😘🤭
I watched this with my younger cousin and we just died of laughter.
I'm a dog trainer. I have never hated a cartoon character more than I hate Guy.
But have u seen the original movie Danny?
The song killed me. 😭✋
Honestly I wouldn't take that level of disrespect
Danny, quit swearing to God.  Use grown-up language.  You are not 13.
I’d like to see an average person’s recording of Pete Davidson reacting to this review…because we all know just how well Pete Davidson reacts to being recorded by average people.
cool
The only really good movie on Netflix was daddy day care
Danny ! Tu n'as fait qu'effleurer la surface de ces films sur le lecteur de films en ligne ! Regarder plus vous hérétique !
just joined grey on all my devices officially!
I despise the animation style. The models are SO ugly, and they move in weird ways. My biggest gripe is definitely the dog’s weird coochie-lookin lips.
yes
Stuff like this really just makes me think movies like these are embezzlement/money laundering fronts. Dump money into a project like no tomorrow, do the absolute bare minimum to create a plausible "end product" you can show auditors, cash out and pretend it never happened.

sure spent a lot of time giving a play by play of this horrible movie
i laughed more at this video than at thhe movie
Did he actually break his wall? Omg
Imagine being an animator and getting told you have to animate a dog shitting in a trophy cup and releasing a giant fart cloud
Honestly Danny kind of looks like the dad
the fact that I saw my brother watching this once at some point 😭
Danny is so old that his hair is turning gray.
ٴ
The animation looks like a bootleg YouTube video that was made in someone’s basement. And it’s a NETFLIX film.
I’ve never watched this guy and this is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
Dude I’m so glad I found your channel again! Turning on notifications rn!!!
How did they find a way to make this movie look like it was made 10 years ago
Maybe they're just sh*tposting?
someone explain to me the Greg pillows??
You might find this funny but my ginger cat went OUT of his way to climb the mini fridge and shit in a potted plant, try and bury it, act smooth about it but ended up knocking the plant over. He had muddy paws and still tried be coy LMAO like bruh, you ain't smooth haha
Marmaduke was such a good comic strip and Netflix really said "what if we ruined that for you"
The end credit dog animations are so much more appealing than the actual movie why did they not just use that animation style?
Netflix adaptations in a nutshell
bro after being cured of depression, i got depressed by watching this movie for myself
10:24 He should and I don’t know why they didn’t. But what do I expect from a movie condoning dog abuse and neglect.
9:45 In my opinion, he probably has/had a digestive issue (in the moment), and if he keeps having that issue, I find it worrying. It looks creepy when his stomach keeps doing that.
18:30 "murmudur"
Does anyone remember the live action Marmaduke
no cause i was watching this movie with the kids i was babysitting and i just KNEW he would make a video on this 😂😂
Why did they give the dog a name who would fit a demon in paranormal activity
Some movie should actually let the main character die at the end that would be so supeising and an ending that is so suprising
i mean since they released stranger things 4 ive begun to suspect this
The animation and character design  is my main worry when it comes to the Marmaduke movie. (I haven't seen the full movie, but the few clips I've seen says it all for me.) Don't get me wrong, I like it when animations have range when it comes to designing body shapes for their characters, but this movie pretends to do that when really, they only have three body shapes in the entire movie. And yes, unrealistic proportions can look good with certain animations and certain art styles (for example, Tim Burton has some incredibly exaggerated proportions and it worked extremely well with the art style). But when it comes to this movie, they clearly didn't bother trying to make it look good, and it just ended up looking terrible. And that's just the characters themselves - the colour picking is so random and the way the characters move just makes me so uncomfortable. So needless to say, I really hate this lazy animation style (coming from an artist who is considering going into animation) :))
Holy crap the mom 😏😏🤯🤯🤯😟
It's sad because, the original movies where mid or decent but these poopy reincarnations are just bad, I group with the movies, it may not be the best, but this is just boversum
Truly greg forever
I think im actually gonna name my dog mamaduke that name is funny as fuck
I was watching this and the bad animation plus the bad plot made me immediately know Danny would talk about this
POV you are watching Marmaduke 2
the dog looks like pete davidson
Did you actually punch your wall for a bit?
The live action is somewhat better then this lol
Please someone clip that lil Danny dance
The real life movie made years before was one of my favourites as a child now I no longer own a dog thanks netflix :)
Not me thinking you legit punch a hole in your wall for a bit.
12:21
Pyrocynical watching marmaduke like 🫣
I can’t stop laughing
Danny said he hasn’t seen Pete Davidson do any promotion or talk about this movie in any way, but I honestly just think that Pete doesn’t want people to know that he took any part in this garbage heap of a movie. And I don’t blame him. Surely it would do him more harm than good to have this movie on his resume.
Yes
The animation in the ending song actually looked leagues better than the rest of the movie. how do you fuck up that bad.
Bro I saw my cousin watching it and what was I watching 😭💀
No kids have definitely watched this movie. I know because my little sisters won't stop watching it. Which means I also have to watch it. Over and over and over again. 😵
stop looking at the teleprompter broo
Do you still work at corridor digital
Hey Danny I think you should review chicken little. No reason just thought it would be a good movie for you to review.
Disappointed that no one is bringing up how Netflix just stole this movie and completely ruined it.
I liked Marmaduke
Im still laughing at the fact marmaduke contaminated a entire part of his town with just a single fart 💀
plz react to the new Pinocchio
Netflix is DEAD
my name is not greg
fun fact! there is actually already a marmaduke movie about a great dane dog, it was made in the 2000s or something. so this isn’t even an original concept lmao
I was watching Danny’s video pappa has been replaced when an ad came up for a game called ant legion and it showed a kid from behind peeing in an ant hill and it showed the ants just drowning in this kids pee in the ant hill like when he is peeing it’s yellow liquid  but when it zooms in and the ants are drowning in his pee it’s blue liquid for some reason, I skipped the ad but just why, why do companies make these disgusting ads
Marmaduke was an original movie in 2010
Have you watched mako mermaids cuz you look like Chris
The second gregolution is coming...
Does nobody recall the original movie in 2010 being live action? Somehow this remake is so, so much worse. Why would they even remake the film.
my mom came in when i was watching this video she thinks you're good-looking
okay but like Guy is unironically hot
I hate this animation more than the gross 3D Spongebob.
the dog show grounds are now more radioactive than Chernobyl.
DISNEY PUT OUT ZOMBIES 3 AND IT LOOKS EVEN MORE UN ORIGINAL THAN THE LAST
Our school made us watch this at lunch.
The animation and characters look like they were made by NFT bros
10:50 one time me and my bf came home to his dog standing on the table with a pile of 💩 next to her. He wasn’t laughing but I was
This movie is just “I can fix him” gone in a direction that is straight up offensive to all animators and character designers
10:20 yeah marmaduke is definitely a fetish movie
In The original scrapped ending marmaduke brings back hitler
I like you play speed run is cool
Hi dan were greg
Hollywood has run out of ideas. That's why most movies that have come out in the last decade are either superheroes, sequels, or remakes. I would also like to be entertained, not guilted or lectured to for living my life. Shut up about your damn politics. There's a reason movies made during the depression were so good. If people aren't too far gone intellectually, garbage like this wouldn't get the time of day.  If it were up to me, that damn dog would go either to obedience school or back to the shelter.
My sister watched it and well let’s just say she didn’t like it
Can’t believe Champ Kind lived long enough to adopt Marmaduke, now that’s a whammy
I used to read the marmaduke comics all the time as a kid and it’s sad to see this movie turn out so bad
My 3 year old and I watched this movie at random. And even she was roasting it!
That's it! I'm never smelling a dog's rear end AGAIN!!! 9:55
netflix is famos.
marmadook is the apitimy of biting a pb&j sandwich just to find out someone shat in the peanut butter
You look like the ratatouille critic as a child
larry
Suggestion: trying the "success insider VIP" so we don't have to
thank god I don't have a VPN
" his name is guy and is drew goodens biggest fan" lmao
Bro strider
I swear, all of the gross shit in this movie is definitely someone's fetish...
I had to watch the Marmaduke movie five times with four different groups of friends and my girlfriend and my girlfriend, my friends that know her and my friends that don’t know her they all betrayed me she had to watch it with everyone because it’s just that terrible are then my other friends curiosity made me watch it with them.
That fart was practically Chernobyl
0:24 ew a p3d0phile
His face in the thumbnail XD
*Marmaduke= Mama I'm A Criminal*
My niece and nephew are obsessed with this movie, nonstop watching it. I’m so disappointed in them.
I think that it’s intended for young simple toddlers, bruh
When I watch this with my brother We did not know what to say after we're done watching that
Danny please review gem souls it's an mobile app and it's a text style type of game except an ai is disguised as a cartoon or anime character that chat with you the bots are very random at time
ALL FART HUMOR IS HILARIOUS, nobody has ever thought except whoever wrote this sort-of-a-movie.
You should react to 7yr old rapper Lil Ashley, she is from slovakia so you wont understand her but dont worry Im from slovakia and dont understand singe word she sais
Wait the family is still in like 5 million dollar debt it’s just like yay we’re 5 mil in debt and not 6
(Phone rings) Netflix: Hello! You’ve been green lighted! Now tell us who worked on the film and you’ll receive your pay check! (Phone call ends)  - The entire process of movies and shows appearing on Netflix
Dannie: The family blaming their financial struggles on Marmaduce? That’s a little heavy  Also Dannie: Damn bro, do you WANT to bankrupt your family? Keep this up and you will. BAD MARAMEUCE BAD BOI  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There was a good Marmaduke movie that was made in 2010 with Owen Wilson. This shit was not needed. It looks like one of those knock off cartoons that are so off from the original that you have to question it the whole time.
I love that the fact that the dog can speak is just accepted in that world...which adds a whole nother layer to the physical abuse aspect... because he definitely knows what he's doing and can understand what people are saying.
That movie was good
Isn't your hairstyle precious.
what happened to the YouTube shorts video?
16:01 this is just that one scene in futurama where hypno toad herds sheep. It's not original in the slightest
I saw the animation quality and the saturation and my eyes nearly melted out of my skull.
at 20:50 is that not worse?
lol they spent their entire budget getting pete davidson and just forgot to make the movie good
if you like this watch jack and the coo coo clock heart
I am new
the original marmaduke movie was amazing ngl
Movie 3/10 commentary 9.6/10 humor 8.12 video … IT’S OVER 9!
Negative infinity out of positive infinity  Is the the most negative score in existence.
This whole movie came from a book I could read in 5 minutes when I was like 6
Didn't you get in trouble for something I honestly can't remember what it was
Is he knock off scooby doo? 🤔
What the live action marmadook
One time it was raining at school and we watched this movie
pixar mom syndrome 😂
Ofc the cheerleaders are poc bullying the white blonde girl with blue eyes. Took a page from Heathers' book lmfao
i subscribed amd turned on notifications i am truly greg
this is literally the bad version / budget version of secret life of pets
that animation looks straight outta 2005 with a budget of 0.7
Man the live action Marmaduke was actually a good movie why would they ruin my childhood
I swear marmaduke is complete b a d in my opinion. It has poop jokes and marmaduke is fat and gross and this movie is gross and it’s just really bad….and also the mom.
How much did North West begged for Pete to do this
Chrissy wish she didn’t wake up for this movie.
Jacked? looks like a kangaroo? A kangaroo named Jack maybe?
If you think this movie is the worst movie this year watch 365 days :this day
danny you should definitely make  another part of andrew tate since things have happened
Thank you, Danny. You're the best animal rights activist of our time.
My school watches movies in the cafeteria to make up for the fact that they do not allow phones and force us to watch this steaming pile of shit
why does danny kinda look like guy   idk what it is
i've never felt less alone
lmfao
this is some 2000s movie shit
Every character design in this movie is absolutely putrid.
Holllly shit that moms…. She’s… a fucking bowling pin🗿
I didn't think the animation was this bad
Cmon Netflix just give us another great pretender you’ll actually make some kind of profit off of it
Vile
Danny editing the punch in the wall is better than the movie itself
1:14 the  rage music and him getting mad 🤣
0:52 he was held at gunpoit
coulda met this man at my local bar but i was stupid enough to simply go home after the show
They really did pay people to animate that, huh. I now want to learn 3d animation just to make a better animated movie out of spite alone
I am now truly greg
The trainer be like, "DODGE!!!"
I feel like I haven't seen anyone comment on the fact that this past month or so worth of videos it looks like Danny has some baby greys (hair) and idk if I'm seeing things or if he made a video asking not to address it that I didn't see? But the front quaff part looks like it has some silver/grey in it and I personally think it looks really good!!
oh naw🧍🏽‍♀️the characters from freddy frogface look better than whatever tHIS is
I’m a Greg Danny can you comment on my comment pls
OMG MY LIL BROTHER WATCH THIS THEY OTHER DAY
"he's jacked, he looks like a Kangaroo" Is that the first thing you think of when you think of jacked creatures? I was going to say maybe gorilla, or bear, or horse.
that under the desk angle with the "daddyboy" shirt..... ngl that did something to me 😏🤤🥵
I think the producers just wanted to add some INTERESTING kinks into a kids movie
Marmaduke?? Well, Netflix must feel the need to compete with Disney in the race to the bottom.
When Netflix recommended me this monstrosity I closed the app so fast that it’s threatening
I feel so old rn dude... this kid doesn't even know marmaduke was a movie from a while ago, and thinks it's a new movie. 😥
8:05 I wish I knew what laura was thinking when she hears this
I won $50 of stock of Netflix 😭😭😂😭, it is now WORTH $20- something. I need Netflix to do something good , PLEASE LOL. People would keep their subscription if they put the money they dedicated to this horrible movie to things that are cancelled people actually loved like Anne With an E which was left with MANY unfinished questions about the characters stories.... 😭
I wish I could give double likes on this video 🤣
As a hobbyist animator, 19:24 makes me so mad. They literally just took the transform tool on the frame and moved it down and up again.  0 effort lol
Netflix is making mockbuster films
What kind of kinks does the director have to make this monstrosity
The token rich British guy in a suit is still hot, that’s all that matters
Hi Danny. A kid at my that hates me school says you are friends with his grandma. Please tell me if this is true. Im very upset. Are you friends with Owen Schmidt’s grandma. If so, please tell her to tell her son to give me 10$ he owes me. Thank you Danny.
the animation is fucking atrocious
W carhartt tee
*the one child who watched it and saw this/me* W R O N G
What's with the corporate lesbian haircut
why does this movie give like the same vibes as those old bratz movies
Worse then morbius??
I feel deeply uncomfortable when did Danny become attractive
It sounds interesting to watch 😂
That dog is killing me ☠
I love Pete Davidson and the original Marmaduke comics but this movie sounds bad
8:11 I love how it cuts off so it looks like he just got remolded into a human
That marmaduke movie looks like it was made by someone with some...questionable preferences. totally not a "the writer's barely-disguised fetish" type scenario
as someone who has watched marmaduke with my brother     children have watched this movie
They actually are starting to make bad movies on purpose, they worked so hard on making good originals that they no longer profit off of so now they’re just going spit out dog shit and maybe put in ads
Please Danny can you do a review on the original Marmaduke??  And do comparisons to this movie? I grew up with the live action I think it'd be fun, just a thought.
I watched that before
I watched this movie listening when I was at daycare Just talk looks retarded
Is that hit rapper and artist da baby?
Sounds like awsom-o 4000 help out with Netflix
The 2010 Marmaduke was better
I would be surprised if this movie was sponsored by the creators of imodium. It would be understandable as to why these movies even exist,
I couldn't get past the mom's thighs
This isn't related but I accidentally called Pete Davidson "Kim Kardashian's girlfriend"
I literally cannot handle art styles/ animations like this, it makes me so uncomfortable just looking at them
I’m kinda shocked nobody’s talking about how awful this movie looks. Like it’s visually so bad. I could find more quality stuff on 2007 Newgrounds
oh marmaduke my teacher forced us to watch it in class
Why do they always make the characters rap like it’s the late 90s?
You should react to the original Marmaduke movie cause it's better
Okay uh- my mom just said: I’m gonna name my next dog Danny Gonzales-  Do you like mothers? Or just fathers.
Maybe they see how some games go for a less advanced look and try to do it but it only makes movies look bad
Maybe the point is that’s it’s supposed to be bad funny to get attention.
I watched it
nice hair
Hey, lead animator here, we wanted to explore AI in animation, so we animated the whole thing in DALL-E. I’m willing to answer all questions which make me look good.
This movie feels like it was made by a deviantartist with some very specific fetishes. And the fact it wasn't scares me.
You should do a reaction video of zombie 3!
The 1.1k dislikers are weird fetishists
Also, this is my third time watching this video and just noticed you have the hoochie daddy shorts on 🤣🤣🤣
They should’ve called him MarmaDookie when he shit at that competition lmao dumb but better that “not so Great Dane”
Netflix originals fucking suck, unless it’s the Mitchell’s vs the Machines. i swear they fucking suck
You should watch Jurassic shark (yes that’s a real movie)
At the part where the british dude punched the dog I got a peta ad
I just turned on notifications :)
I feel the same as you on marmaduke (only thing worse lately was Clifford movie) .. but my kids love it and watch it everyday 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm very suprized that they actually got the map right when he went on his journey because you would think that the people who made this movie would be dumb enough to not know what the world looked like.
Bro my class literally got mad when we watched marmaduke
It is fact that Marmaduke was the original source of chlorine gas
This is kinda true
Juxt now finally turning on notifacations after watching for a while (multiple months and 2 years). But now im truley Greg
my school played marmadukr in the cafeteria it made me feel glad i was in detention facing away
If I'm not mistaken this movie is based on a comic, so this is likely to preserve the movie rights.
If you think that is the worst, you haven't seen anything.
13:01. So the food was 40 grand. But the dog food was 1 million dollars….Yee. K
I remember Marmaduke was a movie where it was cgi dog voiced by Owen Wilson in 2010
Marmaduke (2010) he dog does die. So I really thought they'd kill him again
I'm not in the mood for this today
There is rule 34 for this movie. Only one image so far, but it is there. Do not be afraid, peer into the abyss.
Bro my teacher made us watch this around the end of the year 💀
I watched this movie and never watched Netflix again. Im traumatized
This video is over now, over now
Sa
I pretty sure that Guy’s just fluent in dog language because otherwise the family would hear Marmaduke speaking English rather than barking
The CGI is so god damn
Either you like them and they meant it or you hate it and you were supposed to. Win win!
MARMADUKE IS FUNNY!!
The reason he can understand the dog is because he's british
I love the fact Netflix removes shows like Icarly, victorious or even the office just to make more room for movies like these
"fah-ther when can i leave to be on my oooooooooooooohwn"
What’s actually funny is that when I heard Danny say I think no kids have watched this movie witch made me think me and my mom,sister,and cousin had watched this movie a week before LMAO
they made an amazing tv show called kung fu panda: the dragon knight
y’all don’t know about the original marmaduke movie???
Makes not any sense since it a movie show thst looks unappealing often get immediately turn off or not watched. Netflix has some good originals, Castlevaina is cool, but good shows are few and far between.
So the answer this whole time to true nightmares was this movie..?
Also Marmaduke is an old cartoon
This is why they lost 1 million subscribers the last quarter lmao
Just noticed Danny’s hair and ???? Omg bro’s hair is fuckin gorgeous 😵 pls never dye it I love the streaks in the front
The milisecond I saw those characters, my faith in humanity just died
Movies like this should actually be censored from children because such levels of stupidity, absurdness and vulgarity are definitely harmful for normal cognitive and social development of a child
Danny Gonzalez looks like the new buzz lightyear.
How was Rainforest Café?
I love Marmaduke
Why is the animation in Marmaduke worse than the YouTube cartoons my kid watches?
Danny making fun of the dad knowing full well he would be cast as him in a live action version   (No hate just going along with the Danny looks like all cartoon men joke)
They have to make the mom dummy thicccc?
danny should watch the amazing bulk lmao..
This movie gave me a tingling feeling that only my uncle can give me. It was so refreshing to watch a beautiful work of art that this movie is after this horrible year so far for cinema. I truly think the only bright spots this year for cinema were this masterpiece and the amazing Morbius.     This movie has some of the quirkiest and goofy jokes i’ve ever heard that had me laghing and giggling all night long. Especially when Marmaduke farted the many times that he did I just couldn’t stop giggling. The animation was so high quality I completely under stand the 6 morbillion bit coin they spent on it.   I applaud Netflix and Pete davidson for making Marmaduke come to life from the screen. I kid you not I could smell the farts from the screen every time he farted and they were so good. I have rewatched this movie 689 time since it’s release and it was amazing every time. 100/10 must watch!  please watch this movie marmaduke is holding my family hostage.
I genuinely don’t understand how they made the character design so horrendous. Like I cannot think of an uglier movie
The first time I watched Marmaduke was pretty embarrassing. I was cringing at every second of it. I think it would be better without the farts, the scripts, and maybe a better acting team?
subed and notifacations on
“Please boyyy”, cries cutely* “BeE oKaAyY” (voice crack😉)
Dude this movie is like an actual movie. This was made years ago as a live action movie. The plot is very different but does no one remember this?
my question is why did they render the entire movie in eevee
The animation is so bad that it looks like it’s from a 90s math 3d animated show
I can't take Pete Davidson seriously because he's so tight cast as emotionless
H8:šč
Close your app you best you tube er pls note me pls I can't I'm crying you good you tub er
Marmaduke <3
When I saw what this movie actually looked like for the first time I, no joke, went to check if the video was still in 1080P.    Like why am I getting Disney movie knock off vibes from something voiced by Pete Davidson. Does he also star in Little Panda Fighter 5 or something?
I watched it bc my mom made me.. so i made my class go through the same pain with me on movie day
There was a Marmaduke before Netflix's Marmaduke, in the Airbud era
its weird because randomly netflix drops gems like big mouth and recently sea monster
It looks so bad
I hope so, because if these are the actual movies they're gonna make, they might as well just give up as a corporation.
I want Justice for the original marmaduke  movie with Owen Wilson
I only realized that my sister watched this when the fart scene came up.
I like it how nobody gives a latterly crap that a dog just detonated a tsar bomb of crap
8:28  That’s how furrys are born.
Wait is this movie supposed to be a spin off of those life action Marmaduke movies 😭😭
Hey Danny!
Great vid, but why did you film the sponsor segment from under your table?XD
Bruv.... that mom is PACCCCCKING
At the fakeout death, I fucking cried. Not because I was emotionally invested in this character at all. No, just because I lost it at how hilarious it would've been to end the movie like that.
Can you react to Stromedy? He was really popular like 2 years ago and would use drones to "spy" on creepy things that are totally real
I swear I remember watching a live-action Marmaduke when I was little it was the same dog breed and the plot was pretty similar too.
You should watch H2O just add water
You look like a chinatown Thimothë Chamalet.
Worst thing is… chris hackney voice acted in this
“ Hit it “
Sad thing is that I grew up with the original life action version of Marmaduke from the early 2000ds. The appeal of the life action movie was to see real life dogs partying.
I watched the first part of this movie with the kids I babysit… they turned it off real quick
The noises are it for me lmao
they definitely know that kids will watch literally anything
I asked my brother of nine if he enjoyed watching “Marmaduke”. He said “Did I like it?! Or did I hike it?!” and proceeded to spin a yo-yo right into his face. The verdict has yet to be released.
klaus was amazing dont @ me
Danny's videos are so random I unironically thought a swifer wet jet ad was a joke he made.
why does no one know this is just the animated version of the original 🧍‍♀️ the original is wayyy better from what i remember
Hey danny gonzalez talk about the minion trend on tiktok
Here's my reaction to those character models: They look like they were ai generated, thrown into blender, thrown into a blender, then got chucked into Netflix's bad movie character casting
A
About the dog trainer beating the dog:  Cesar Millan is arguably the most famous real world dog trainer, and he horribly abuses his own pets.
Brooooo lol I stopped watching new things 🤣 all sucks... Propaganda and woke s**t and god it's boring... Even my marvel movies became dull every end game
I turned on notifications I am truly GREG
wow, i tried that trick on my dog where i beat him up, and he no longer attacks me! only problem is he sleeps 24/7 though, any tips to wake him up?
When I was growing in a poor country, we only had movies like this. Its possible Netflix is trying to get further into Latin America by mimicking the style of the popular bootlegs there.
In Germany is this movie under the top 10. XD
pete is literaly worth 8 mil and he chose this to end his life with
This movie looks like a children's content farm video
I saw it with my family and it was soo bad
I used to read Marmaduke in the newspaper and some people in the comments didn't even know it existed . Am old. 😭😂  Also this movie is an abomination.
Danny, you HAVE to play scary teacher 3D on your phone, it is so bad!!!
I watched it in class by the end of school. Its bad
I made a rhyme... The Greg group i'm in, In Greg you can win. Watch  movies and hear groovies
Netflix has been doing everything they could to make people cancel subscription, it’s seriously so bad, not even talking about canceling popular shows and producing more and more shitty Netflix originals
Sure... A dog that the family thought was bad the whole movie till it reaches near the end...
Great video as always Drew!
Maybe Netflix is secretly working with Apple to make Apple TV+‘s series and movies more respected. I wouldn’t be surprised. (Compare Sing 2 to CODA.)
I turned on notifications and can you please give me a shout out in your next video
It's the children watching YouTube formula. Little kid will watch ANYTHING so long as there are bright colors silly actions and upbeat music. They will listen to the family finger song for an hour straight so long as random colorful characters regularly parade across the screen. And that's why they are animated in some low budget Indian animation studio. And they get millions of views. So Netflix can slap an animated movie together for a couple million dollars and hopefully it will keep kids watching.
My dog took a dump on my phone, its never charged since. It was not very funny
The original Marmaduke was good 🥲
The ending rap reminds me of the of the rapping dog in the crappy titanic movie 😂
I think it's funny when Danny tries to make us feel bad for Marmaduke when I have the exact opposite reaction it's literally all is his fault, like he has human intelligence and actively chose to eat that food he wasn't supposed to then sharted in the trophy
My guy made f*#@ing Chernobyl
All the budget went to j.k Simmons
every human character looks like a fucking insect oh my good 😭😭
DANNY YOU NEED TO SEE THIS COMMENT! MERGE MANSION HAS NEW ADDS! (If I’m wrong about it sorry I just got one on your video while rewatching it) Edit: also lily’s garden has new ones too
I just looked up the IMDb and you didn't mention JK SIMMONS WAS IN THIS WHAT IS HAPPENING   also 19:27
I just can't belive this movie exists... But does it exsists?
I'd rather watch ratatoing
Why does the quality of the animation look worse than 3d animated movies from the 90s?
2022 Jul 20
"Father when can I leave on my oOoOwN?! 🙄🤚"
No, their just rich and they're 'attaching' themselves to random things to stay relevant, there's more streaming services now. Also, it helps them to find out what people actually enjoy since trends are always changing
Netflix made Marmaduke a terro/ist and frankly it’s not the most out-there thing they’ve ever done
When I was little i used to watch this other movie called marmaduke it was liveaction and the dog was voiced by owen wilson i thought this was an animation remake of that its not thank god cause i remember really liking that movie
17:22 - 17:27 GOT ME LAUGHING SO HARD
how tf is dog food worth 1 million dollars?
This movie looks like one of those shitty children youtube videos
The worst movie I’ve ever watched is called 3 ninjas kick back from 1994
my teacher made our entire class watch this. WHY MR. G? WHY???
I walked in on my nephews watching this movie, watched it for five minutes with them, then turned on Scooby doo for them
No cuz as a Pete Stan tell me how I didn't know that was him the whole time I watched this movie with my kid
This looks worse than a cartoon network straight to tv movie
Actually Marmaduke is better on the original version he is not a cartoon on that version and it's really funny
Now Danny is certain they are doing it on purpose  And they might, it works
Who all saw live action marmaduke?  It comes once in a while on tv, n we actually enjoy it, it's absurd
this movie is a disgrace to cinema and art in general and i am disgusted that this even exists in my opinion i would watch ratatoing or whats up instead of this
this movie is literally corporate artstyle: the animation. but the thing is, this movie made the actual corporate artstyle looks good in comparison than this... shit. im impressed
sea beasts is the only good film ive seen in the past few years-
Hey Danny, please react to larva on Netflix, it’s so dumb and stupid.
the british dude is built like a pretzel stick
And to make things worse they took out all the shrek movies, shrek 1, shrek 2, shrek the third, and shrek forever after!
Two words Danny  "tax write off"     also media is very inflated these days I mean with so much to watch I just get overwhelmed with the deciding of what to watch and 3nd up just skipping TV altogether  what was it syndrome from the incredibles said? If everyone has super powers then no one is truly super
9:13 me
Please review paws of fury
I think Marmaduke was entirely set on the Tom and Jerry show, just because of the sheer amount of violence in both of these creations.
18:21 the ‘uh oh’ is so emotionless it’s fucking hilarious
That's why i stopped watching netflix & only watch danny
I read the comic in the newspaper a lot growing up, and lemme tell ya, Marmaduke the comic is not funny either. But mainly, the dog in the movie does not look like the dog in the comic
It literally looks like a disney minus movie
the 2010 live action version with owen wilson was way better
This movie looks like it was made in 2010
😀
Is it better than the 2007 live action movie?
The 2010 marmaduke was waay better than this 😭
netflix did the original marmaduke so dirty
Marmaduke is on cinema, no I'm not lying.. It's on cinemas! Nobody has watched it... The movie trailer has been on the screens like for 2 months sooo yeah. It also has a song!?!?!?
I feel that a lot of movies think that you'll enjoy the movie just because there's a few really well known actors. They don't even have to be good they just have to be known enough to voice or act in the movie. for example the rock, will Ferrell, Nicholas cage, and Christopher Lee. While all these people have good acting skills, they could star in a really bad movie and still make it so it's not enjoyable. Remember movie companies just because you have a famous actor in your movie won't make it good. 😊
Have your sins been forgiven today and forever?  Think about this.   The God of the bible,  the One True God made us to worship him, obey him, and enjoy him forever.   We break His laws daily by not putting Him first, not thanking Him like we should, we lie, we lust, we have sex before marriage, we dishonor our parents, we covet things other people have, we take God's name and use it in vain,  we use it in a low manner,  sometimes as a cuss word,  (God is holy and even His name is holy),  we don't love like we should, etc.  In doing so we're saying He's not a good provider,  He's a liar,  He's untrustworthy,  He's not worthy of praise.   All these things and more are counted against us.   The bible says God is the just judge of the world and one day He will settle the score for all the wrong we've done.  God is holy meaning He is righteous (morally perfect in thought, word,  and deed)  It also means He is set apart and higher than us.  God  being good, must punish all sin or wrong doing in the world.  This means that if you sin one time God will cast you in hell for eternity.   Because He is good and He doesn't turn a blind eye to sin.  But there is good news.  2000 years ago Jesus the Son  of God came into this world and lived a perfect life ( He never sinned once)  and He died on the cross taking the wrath that we deserve and paid the penalty for the sins we committed.   The bible says that if you will repent (confess and forsake your sins)  and trust in what Christ did on the cross (He took the wrath of God that was meant for you and I) then all your sins will be forgiven and when you die you will be in heaven with God and all who believe for eternity.  Jesus died and on the third day He rose from the grave.  Get right with God today don't wait.  Once you die after that comes the judgement.  Hebrews 9:27 It's the most important thing you can do.   You must be born again John 3:7 If you repent and trust in what Christ did on the cross it shows that you've been born again or born spiritually.   Right now you're dead in your sins and you can't see the beauty of Jesus Christ but after you trust in Christ all the things you hate about God like obeying him,  serving Him,  loving Him and others,  reading the bible, praying and going to church you will love to do those things because God changes your heart.   That's how you know you have been born again and forgiven.  Please think long about this and ask me any questions you have as this is the most important thing you can ever think of in your life.   An eternity in hell (darkness and a lake of fire the bible describes it, with weeping and gnashing of teeth)  or an eternity out of that place and into the loving arms of God who is infinitely glorious, has infinite knowledge and has infinite power to do all that He pleases.   You decide.   Have a great day!
Who else wants a collap between Greg and the Dear Leader Jim Pickens?
i did you on anikator any he guessed you as a youtuber in like 13 guesses
The live action was better
The drew joke is the funniest thing ever
PLEASE WATCH FINDING JESUS ON PRIME VIDEO!!! It is a fuckin hilarious low budget movie in the same vein as veggie tails
I think the dog just used his killstreak on the trophy
One reason they do it is because of the "bad taste" theory. If you try something that is absolutely terrible you ask your friend to taste it. The same applies to movies. You tell your friend Oh my , this is like the worst movie ever, you got to see it.
I believe I became trans just to be gay for Danny sometimes
lowkey became uninterested after 8 minutes after you explained how horrible it is
The bulldog is even more impressive because of the fact that he was in the building he was lifting like thats insane
Jesus Christ is king
You're like the knockoff wish copy of drew gooden
Jesus, the animation quality is worse than Pixar in the 90s. This is _bad._ Stylization is severely lacking in modern CGI cartoons these days, but for the love of God, have a little pride.
Can you start reacting to the bad animated movies again?
Did anyone else feel suddenly stimulated when Danny started the ad read and the camera ... changed angles ...
rip wall 12:20
Bruh Marmaduke Literally Explored THE WHOLE OCEAN To Win A Dog Competition 💀💀💀🖐️🖐️🖐️
No you were incorrect Marmaduke is a very good movie just don’t watch the cartoon one there’s a older one that’s better
Dogs hate this guy
Please do another video on Indian Fact Genius I just looked at some of their more recent posts 😂
Just a reminder, some poor, poor soul had to animate this dumpster fire of a movie!
My siblings were watching this movie- I simply left the room it’s so awful
Ok OK hear my out Danny and others. The reason why Marmaduke is so bad is because it's not Owen Wilson. Without the wow factor, the movie's rating goes down 20%. I rest my case.
netflix is just so scared of making anything even slightly controversial
16:34 why that was pretty sus
For the love of God look for cool tool
Damn, the skinny-limb people are so upsetting to watch! I don't know what the limit is for how skinny you can draw limbs before they hit "terrifying" but this movie vaulted over it.   It's like Slenderman dimensions but with weird noodles for limbs. 😱
Marmaduke is the Bee Movie on steroids.
15:04 bro this dog solos goku ez
don't want to defend this heap of crap or nothing but a detail to mention is magic was in fact established as early as 6:38 not just the last 20 minutes of the movie.
Buzz lightyear new movie except smaller chin
Great movie this is why I watch your videos instead of actually going to the movies thank you 🫠
Your initials also mean dollar general
Alright I just noticed something weird in the movie being that the dad of marmadukes family has brown hair and so does the mom but both of the children are blonde like what is the mom hiding something and the dad is just too dumb to notice or he’s too busy dealing with his freaky kangaroo dog that sounds like Pete Davidson
3:28 he looks like you
marmalade or marmaduke or wtv should've said "ruh roh" 🙄
Danny I think it's made for you becasue I didn't even know about it till now
They probably fed that script writing bot all the old Marmaduke cartoon strips. Marmaduke has always been godawful.
Danny needs to watch Freddy Frog Face. Imagine this but your head is being slammed against a block of ice every time the main character says a word.
THE OG MARMADUKE IS SOOO MUCH BETTER
I can't tell what age group this movie was made for  Adults?  Weird teenagers?  Children?  Literal fetuses?
Wasn't Marmaduke already a live action movie or am i mixing up movies
If Danny finds this specific fart/shit joke, then he hasnt seen Sanjay and Craig yet lmao
XDDDDDD
Noti squad
As a positive dog trainer the family isn’t suffering because of the dog the dog is suffering because of the family
Netflix does have some funny short movies made by bots lol
You should watch the 2010 one.
i'm gonna tell my kids this was paw patrol.
The legs on these skinny characters are stupid. If the skinny people weigh 40 kg their legs would break if they even just stand up straight  Their femurs probably have about 1/8 the amount of cross sectional area as normal people, which withstand 4000 newtons. Making 40 kg resist gravity takes about 400 newtons which is almost enough  to break the bones of the skinny people  in half
Wait you guys still have peanut right?
19:53 Hi
You should review bratz
I can't believe you missed the chance at 6:13 to say "...and putting their Marma-dukes up."
i won’t lie, i’m young af and in middle school. We saw this movie in 5th grade and the class retard wanted to see it a second time. So we ended up seeing it a SECOND time the DAY AFTER! The reason why we just watched movies all day is because it was the final days of 5th grade and they did that fun stuff in elementary school. Anyways, this movie is horrible, what else can I say.
Dude when I started the vid I thought it was like 7 years old with the quality of animation in the movies.
Marmaduke nfx can’t replace the original marmaduke
this seems like a pretty good movie honestly i don't know what your saying its that bad it was a pretty enjoyable story.
he said DIGGITY dang that dog danny. do better next time.
Whoever made this movie should step in koolaid with white socks on
My sister loves watching this movie. We watch it so often send help
Marmaduke is good not the cartoon version
My brother was watching this and my mom said “c’mon insert my bros name no way ur likeing this stuff it’s so ugly” (note this was in an another language) and I looked at my mom and said “yes that’s ugly (the cartoon) “ my brother liked it.
6:11 missed opportunity to say they put their marma-dukes up
Literally the only good thing on there is stranger things
The SECOND after Marmaduke sung his first line at 19:26 an anti-animal abuse ad from PETA showed up and it was really jarring
One of the movies to exist
This doesn't even look like a Netflix movie, this just looks like something you'd find in a Walmart's Bargin Bin or some Direct to DVD store.
Crazy to thing the guy who directed this also directed the 90s Spawn movie lmao
Great Dane? More like mediocre Dane
The 2D animation in the end credits actually looks neat… they could’ve went with that for the whole movie but instead went for over saturated clumps
Nah that sucks because the original marmaduke was my SHIT
"They put their deuces up" ... how did you miss the opportunity to say "They put their dukes up"
the indepth analysis of the entire first dog show scene has me rolling
these characters unlocked a new visceral fear inside me
Studios are realizing that people will go to your movie if it’s bad enough. The main selling point isn’t some celebrity, or that it’s nostalgia bait, it’s just bad so you go see how bad it really is. All you need is around 55 minutes of pure garbage, and people will still see your movie.
the original marmaduke with owen wilson has just been ruined for me because of this
The people who made this weren't ON dugs, they ARE the drugs.
Your eyes are perfectly spaced, its stupidly perfect
Oh that’s very simple they just don’t care and they all want that green green stash of cash
Straight up im not sure how the people in Marmaduke walk their bones must be the size of strands of hair and, it just sucks.
Why’d they rip off the og Marmaduke
Please review the movie Status Update ☺️
How’s it going
Marmaduke was a live action movie and comics and it so much better fr. U should check those out.
Woah! This movie is definitely the —- movie
this the kinda movie you can't watch sober 💀💀💀
LETS GO I AM THE ONLY ELDER DEMON TO WATCH THIS MOVIE
Marmaduke was a live action movie about a dog, so they got that, but the live action is about a Great Dane who saves a person. Not whatever THIS is.
In a strange way, you kinda look like the dad from the movie
This is the ugliest movie ive ever seen, its actually worse then rhapsitty street kids
This movie is a masterpiece. I dont know what you mean
I have the old 2010 Marmaduke and it's wayyyyyy better than this new shit
Rip the 2010 marmaduke loved that movie as a kid
The old live action marmaduke is great
Omg, right after the dog kickings scene I got an ad to save dogs being used for dog meat in China 😭
I was at a local basketball game and saw some kid watching this vid   A man of culture.
Should've hired Emma Stone 😀
Ok but what kills me the most about this movie is that they have the perfect setup for a "Marmaduke plays dead because it's a funny dog trick, haha" RIGHT THERE, it could've at least been the one joke this movie would have. Maybe it, idk, could wrap up the plot by convincing the judges to award Marmaduke for his acting talent, and the reward money covers the training costs and then some, tying up several plot threads, but no the movie ends with "dog like food" 🤦
Why are the character models like the monsters in the night before Christmas
7:22 jurassic world reference?
the animation looks like early 2000s bratz movies but its 2022 and they MUST have had a solid bidget given its Netflix with pete davidson
in the "hit" film popstar: never stop popping theres a scene where he is reading reviews and one is a "shit emoji" out of ten and i wish that was an option on like letterboxd or smthn
3:40:03
the original marmaduke was literally so much of my childhood. this just ruined it.
Damn they didn't even skim the Marmaduke comic strip before making this,  huh?
Daniel, young man, you had better use punctuation in your titles, young man! 😤😤😤😡🤬
Jane the Virgin has more seasons now you should react to it.
“who’s voiced by pete davidson”  Me: *oh it’s already terrible*
You should watch the original marmaduke about the surfing dog
The ruined marmaduke
2:17 my reaction was fear
I know this has nothing to do with this specific video, but we need a collab for Laura and Amanda
That dad could look up and see the moon explode and say ”DAMN THAT DOG!”😂😂
I need you to see the movie Leo the Lion. I watched it on Netflix a few years ago but now it’s free on Prime. It’s from 2005 so not necessarily recent but I feel like I’ve never seen anyone talk about it and it’s the most…shocking movie I think I’ve ever watched
Yeah, they are making cheap movies relying on name recognition to make them still sell. I guess they haven't heard about the video game crash that was caused by an oversaturation of Atari  shovelware licensed games.
What kind of happy ending is that? The family still owes several million dollars to the trainer. They didn't resolve that, did the writers just forget that was a thing? Lol
Seeing this video I can see why movie is horrible. The anatomy and animation is so atrocious it hurts to look at. I felt so uncomfortable seeing marmadukes belly after eating loads of food and farting it out since it looked like a disgusting fetish seen in deviantart. Netflix canceled various animation projects yet they kept Boss baby and Big mouth.
wait....that one newspaper article?
Hi Danny I have been subscribed to you for over 3 years but I really need your help a girl from my school recently died I’m only in 8th grade but she was too… can you give her a shoutout I think she would really like it her name is Becca.  She passed from another boy shooting her in the eye with a pellet gun on purpose. Please danny from one Greg to another can you please give her a shoutout!
Putting their deuces up
this is actually a spin-off of a great live action movie from the early 2000's. I recommend you watch the original and not this (literal) dog s***. (btw the plot is completely different besides the bad dog part)
You should watch Strawinsky and the Mysterious House, its a low budget movie based off narnia
NO WAY NOT MARMADUKE. THE 2010 ONE WILL FOREVER BE CLOSE TO MY HEART
aa
Lol my friend has a white dog named Zeus.
The real ploy is that guy is a schizophrenic pyshc ward patient that hallucinate about the nurses stuffed animal. All the places they go to are just different places in the mental hospital. The park is the back yard, the city is the cafeteria, Marmaduke house is just the medical exam room, etc. His car is a wheelchair he goes in to to go from place to place. The village dog is just his doctor. All of the other dogs are just other patients and their owners are other nurses. When Marmaduke runs into the rain guy just loses his toy dog.
Netflix out here with the "no such thing as bad publicity" mentality 🤣🤣🤣
Well the sea beast was super good
my teacher made us watch this movie and its like an inside joke for all of us now lol
This movie is animated like those knock off versions of Pixar films you find in the clearance bin
danny never show another clip of this movie on your channel this was so nasty visually, sometimes audio wise, and script wise
when i was growing up, i grew up with this movie called Marmaduke, it was like cgi, dog talks and this netflix thinig. Gives that old movie some bad cred ;-; justice for marmaduke!\  looking back now, that old movie, there was a dog swimming competition. the old marmaduke was afraid of everything aand especially water so in the end he did great. id love danny react. to the original marmaduke!!! thatd be great
nice shirt 👍
i subscribed and turned on the bell am i truly greg
The animation is a sin to god.
11:58 The dog recreated Chernobyl that easily. Magic? Super strength dogs? My guy can recreate the radioactivity from a nuclear bomb.
This movie looks amazing
I need that shirt
is no one gonna talk about how none of the bullies are white? like all three of them are different races? i could be looking into i too much but i just find it a little weird
I remember being bored cuz there was nothing to watch so my lil bro took over the TV and saw Marmaduke on the new movies list. We had nothing to do so we watched a couple of minutes. The animation was horrible we were surprised they even released it, even pubg mobile has better graphics. The environment was so boring, dead and empty, definitely a 0/10
How did they manage to reproduce with those almost non existent limbs?
netflix has been making a lot of terrible decisions lately
Okay to be clear, I am no means a good artist, but I think I could make better characters then these guys.
i tried to watch this movie with my brother.. we got 15 minutes in and had to shut it off. and in that whole time i had no idea that was pete davidson. How did they get him to do this terrible movie?
Hey Danny could you do a video on nellabearggg
why the hell is the mom shaped like that
The way it kept getting worse 🚶‍♀️
Marmaduke… I watched it.  And the fact that I was watching with my therapist sense we where snowed in and trying to find “ good “ movies to watch git me an early session:3
PLEASE react to the “After” movies. I know they’re a bit old but they are so horrendous, your commentary is the only thing that can save it
I was on that slideshow thing that plays if you wait for too long, and when marmaduke’s one came up, it felt like a jumpscare
we aren't a bad movie.  we are good tv show. - beebo and Bunkle
marmaduke is horrible
What I don't understand is how they made DOGS so ugly and unlikable. The only sort of cute one was the bulldog but that's because they didn't exaggerate the proportions to make him look so skinny and weird.
I am 99% sure whoever wrote the script for this movie is 1. a furry, 2. into scat and gas and 3. probably into stuffing and maybe vore. ew. don't look up any of those.
I am on my knees pleading for you to make a video on the daddyofive youtube channel. Please Danny
The fact that Danny can bark is one thing. The fact that nobody else brings it up is another thing
He punch his wall
Right before school ended, the after school program put this movie on and it haunts me to this day that tiny kindergarteners had to witness this movie
You should also watch simba the king lion the final battle
The dog is so damn skinny like dude needs to go to a vet like his stomach is so thin :_:
Ngl, I saw the Guy (or dad?) character in the thumbnail and thought it was an animated version of Danny...the hair, head and nose looks so like him-
I like the part when he said, "marmaduke"
According to google, Greg is the fastest growing army on YouTube. Danny usually says not to look this up, but he doesn’t actually have to worry about that because if you do look it up, you will see that Greg is in fact the fastest growing army on YouTube.
Can you react to one of the three Z-O-M-B-I-E-S movies? They are a trilogy of musicals made my Disney. They are disney channel original movies.
A lot of it is because of the company black rock making companies try to be “woke”
best movie ever
This is THE MOST low budget animation I've ever seen from a big company. This is like a crappy YouTube kids animation that you shove in front of your kid to keep them quiet. I can not explain how much I hate it, it hurts my eyes, my eyes are bleeding, I need help.
18:10 wtf is that
ily danny
Marmaduke already had a movie don't need this bad remake. I don't think he would die. It's baced off a comic strip that was made by a kid in the family that grow up with a Dane named Marmaduke years ago. The comic followed actual things that happen so this doesn't go with that at all
I recommend watching Sea Beast! It's a Netflix original that is actually amazing! I watched it two days ago and it was genuinely so well written and beautiful.
Watched this when it came out on Netflix, thought the same thing. It was the WORST thing my eyes laid upon on. Never even finished watching it.
netflix fr dying
I think you should upload a Roblox cringe compilation reaction video. If you do, be prepared... 🤢🤮
I watched this movie 2 months ago in german it’s so much better in a different language
Thumbs up and an additional comment to beat the algorithm. Thanks for the video! 👍🔥👍
The old Marmaduke movie was better🥱
I really feel like Pete Davidson only had words to say, not a full script of what’s happening, because I doubt he would have tied his name to this if he knew what it was.
I was wondering if you could review the movie "Afterlife of the Party" on Netflix! It's about as bad as Addison Rae's movie, so I thought you would like to review it.
You can't expect Netflix to voluntarily relinquish its very profitable "production values." Nor can you expect traditional Hollywood moguls to willingly give up the very lucrative practices they've been practicing for more than a century, man. Plus, all these execrable movies serve the added purpose of further dumbing down millions of eager dumbshits.
I WAS LAUGHING SO HAAARDD
Crazy to think Pete Davidson is in this shitty movie lmao.
speaking of movies, are you sure you’re not  buzz from “Lightyear”?
Who else knows the live action and *better* marmaduke? Wtf did they do to my fukn boy dude T>T
CGI marmaduke from 2000 is better
Is it just me or does the dad look like cartoon Danny- 😶
How was this made in 2022 by netflix and not in 2004 by asylum?
I was born in Ireland in 2001 and prefer the live action marmaduke from 2010
Marmaduke without Heathcliff? I'm pretty sure this is a hate crime.
Why does the animation look like that "telling lies?" "No papa" video
Yasss Slay queen 👸 👏👏
it looks like a 2000s movie
yes, but the live action marmaduke is great😫
my brother loved this movie. he watched it for a solid month, over and over. so once, i came out of my room just to see the fart scene. it was an odd day.
Marmaduke was also a live action movie about a dog made in 2010, you should wach it
“I thought this guy would be the villain because he’s rich… and British…” I couldn’t agree more Danny all British people have some messed up view on things.
My little brother was watching this 😭😭😭😭😭
My little brother watched it twice
I watched this movie with 7 year olds and they hated it. After they said "I was hoping it would get better but I think it got worse" Even kids don't like it
Pls pls pls make another Reddit video
Wow they made something worse than the emoji movie
19:27 gettin sturdy like Phineas and Ferb
Danny in the thumbnail looks like a single dad who decided to get a twitter account on his brand new samsung making himself a profile picture and the only phone he ever used is a flip phone he got at 16
Honestly thank god Danny made this video. As a kid, I was obsessed with the live action Marmaduke movie. Recently I've been getting a whole bunch of tik toks on my fyp where someone edits themselves to look like a character from the new version of Marmaduke, and I was so genuinely confused because as far as I knew, the only characters in a movie called Marmaduke were played live action. Thank you for clearing this up for me Danny boy
I could animate better than this and I've never touched a computer.
Bouncing egg
I WAS SO MAD WHEN THEY MADE MARMADUKE INTO CARTOON ITS NOTHING LIKE THE IRL ONE 😭😭
Why does the dad kinda look like Danny..
These days I feel like cartoons are enjoyable by both kids and adults, they are well written and genuine funny. This shit of a cartoon is just lazy jokes and emotional trauma, Netflix  is just shitting up bad movie and being like “we’re killing it!” No Netflix, no
The funny thing is that I’ve watched this before. I watched it a few weeks ago and my mom showed it to me and she thought it was good and I just couldn’t handle it-
Man this is worse dog abuse and then in courage the cowardly dog
Is 0% rotten tomatoes good
Marmaduke is a remake of the 2010 movie of the same name...it got 9% on rotten tomatoes so they really have given up and are remaking flops
I love Netflix's bad movies, I watch them while grinding on games or out of pure boredom. Somehow they're interesting in their own ways lol
The other marmaduke wasn’t even good what made them think this needs to exist
HEY GREGINE HERE …. YEESS INDEED NETFLIX MAKES NONSENSE DRAGGING IT - EVERYTHING THEY MAKE OUT TO ETERNITY .. JUST STOP AFTER 1 SEASON 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 PLEASA NETFLIX 🫵🏼💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏🙏
5:26 he's not the bad guy. 6:23 *Punches and kicks the dog*
This movie feels like it was released before all the textures finished rendering.
Marmadue be like: I AM MARMAFURJHRHRHRHEHAHHAHA
Maybe the funniest yt video I’ve ever seen
11:29 insults to shin tzus man 😭
Kids have watched this movie. My math teacher put it on back during the school year. I hated every second.
10:08 I'm dead bro 💀💀
The tone of this movie is shot to hell oh my god
These movies are what remind me that ceebs are actually dealing with the same issues as the real world... They are stupid enough to make movies like this... These movies actually get made by some idiot green lighting it. The celeb is dumb enough to hear a pitch and not realize it is being made by half ass people. WHO ALLOWED THIS! What I mean by normal issues.. In life we run into scams, People can be naive and stupid and fall for gigs that suck... This seems like everyone involved in allowing this movie to happen was suckered into it by a kid with money and he was totally feel the vibes man.
if they wanted someone good at voicing cartoon dogs the should have gotten John DiMaggio
You should review the urban rescue ranch
i remember this movie existing but i thought it was old. maybe theres a live-action version and thats what i'm thinking about, that one didnt look enticing either.
Good god, this makes the Owen Wilson Marmaduke look like Citizen Kane.
13:54 actually unfortunately this is my 8yr old sisters favorite movie. im geniuenly and oddly thrilled that danny reviewed it 😭
Danny's bark is oddly on point.
when I was younger I absolutely adored the original Marmaduke movie and the comic strips. I really am disappointed by this movie and how awful it is.
I'm sorry but the part where marmadyke makes a huge fart just makes me die laughing
Dude when I was watching my brothers in the living room I fell asleep and when I woke up my brothers where watching this and let me tell u something waking up to this movie is traumatizing😕
stupid dog eating for his own good.
The animation is really choppy. When Marmalade the Dog says “it won’t be a party without me” he looks rather choppy. Also when Zeus says “I’m supposed to be champion,” he looks quite strange as well.
Let's ta lk about King Tweety for a sec, that is in fact the wors t. They ruined a classic.
"What song?"  "Idk, you tell me." *holds up gun*  Holy shit why is that so funny
The only people that have seen this movie are Kim Kardashian's kids and it was definitely against their will
i also have a dog named zeus
I love Netflix given they make absolute banger sometimes but then this shit and they’re shitty 3d animated kid shows gives me pain
They defo have 💰 to waste. Serious question; HOW DOES THIS DUDE NOT AGE??? What's the secret?
OMG this movie is literally a rip off of another movie called Marmaduke!!! It was released in 2010 June 4th! Directed by Tom Dey and produced by John Davis!!
Why do the parents both have brown hair but the kids are blonde???
Actually, Marmaduke is a old comic that they made into a movie. Never read the comics, but my dad did when he was a kid
can't believe there's not a single comment about the fact that the Dad looks like Danny smh
Finally someone is talking about this. On our last days of school are math teacher put that Marmaduke movie on and everyone was feeling uncomfortable the entire time.
“Which is actually a very nice thing for a rich British man to do in a cartoon.” 🤣🤣🤣  Gotta love Danny
How can Netflix go from making a series like bojack horseman to THAT💀
Marmaduke is based on a comic lol
Did you know there is a live action version of this with a different plot (no biohazardous farts)
lol the dog trainer looks like tiger king in the competition scenes
Danny gonzilla was a senior when me beats was a fresh men wonder if they knew each other at YouTube school
the original marmaduke movie was one of my favorite movies as a kid the new movie is awful
did anyone else watch the live action version with emma stone?!? like obsessively watch it and love it
skete davidson
the animation is atrocious makes me feel sick tbh
how tf is this movie singlehandedly worse than every single bad movie danny has ever made a video about combined
Netflix’s new slogan burning brain cells
12:17
I’m garg!
The only reason Netflix makes such movies is to maintain their subscribers numbers. Just watching these movies for couple of mins will put that in their Top 10 list.
Funnily enough, my little brother came over to me, saw some of the clips, and then told me “Oh, I’ve seen that movie. It was kinda disturbing.” And then walked away. It’s nice to know that even the target demographic couldn’t stomach this, but it unfortunately does disprove the running theory that there are no children watching these. I just wish my brother could have used more of his critical thinking skills before it was too late.
I love when you review movies 👍
Marmaduke is actually a live action movie from 2010, this seems like a cartoon version, same dog breed name, and almost everything, the movie is very similar. its kind of a low budget rip off
I cancelled my Netflix subscription 2 months ago and just bought crunchyroll instead. Now I watch what I actually enjoy
5:14 "At first I thought this guy was gonna be the villain of the movie because he's like rich...and british"  nahh im dead 😭😭😭
the og marmaduke movie was amazing, i grew up watching it, but this one is absolutely horrendous
Im dying of laughter my throat hurts now😂😂
Guy is Alex Turner
8:05 ishowspeed
The part where you expressed how funny it would be if he was just dead and then the movie ends was literally the most hilarious thing ever
the og marmaduke movie was goated out of its mind
At 19:51 we get to see what your mom’s view is all day
Geg
Danny, you can't be going grey!
My little brother watched it. I was like "this is so ugly and it sounds stupid" and he was like "nOoOoO"
Yeah, the only people watching this are zoophiles and zoosadists.
Is this a prequal to the Superdog film coming out? I mean we see a bunch of canine supervillains attacking a talent show here.
Just so everyone understands, Pete Davidson is not and was never funny. He just talks about suicide and depression and honestly it’s just sad to watch him. He’s the only person to have been on SNL who didn’t have any talent. So not surprised his movie and everything else he does sucks ass lol. His only redeeming quality is that anaconda in his pants.
...if anyone remembers the absolute mess that was Inspector Gadget 2015, with its insane new level of bad, this reminds me suspiciously of it so, so much. The weirdly lanky character designs, the bad characterization, the lack of any actual humour, the... weird nature of everything really, and the terrible animation. Man.  Funnily enough IG2015 was _also_ a Netflix premiere...
No it's ESG. Advertisers swear by it but it has backfired. Look at Netflix stock price. Amazon prime is a joke too and I'll never go to a theater.
what horrible 3d character models. when i look at those spaghetti-looking legs and hands i just want to snap them like a low-quality glow stick
18:31 the dude looks like danny
Check it out Danny never misses leg day 19:28
I feel like he’s losing his charm he’s not funny anymore he only post once a blue moon
Are you gonna look me in my eyes and tell me you watched and are judging a baby movie
Please review Shadow in the cloud, worse film ever!
It's,actually a adaptation  of another movie with the same title
My day gets 10 times better when Danny posts a new video
I like Netflix
Hey we didn't ask to be here under your desk it just kinda happened ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
redeeming quality: pete davidson
Danny hears not so great dane  I hears not so great dan
Can you react to the Pinocchio movie please
this... is... this HAS to be a fetish film, it just has to. please, that'd make it LESS horrible.
yeah i somewhay agree, just today i watched an hour and a hallf of boring useless things, nothung happened
Notifications on
16:05 Zeus really getting clout for doing nothing and looking pretty, a true tiktok girl
why does the quality of the movie look like toy story 1
7:41 maybe it's like Detective Pikachu stuff
That Afghan hound (Beautiful dog) is scary and Marmaduke is Scoopy Doo.
Scooby don’t
yeyeyeyeeeeeeeeee
Cha-ching! 💰
As a chubby person, I can confirm I do bounce like a rubber bowling bin when I try to get anywhere
Is it a Mandela effect that i could have sworn that picture behind Danny was him drinking milk? I think I'm going crazy
Bro holy shit that mom 😳😳
My kids watched this and thought it was hilarious. I was less enthusiastic about it.
why are they in the baby boss house though??
I subscribed am I Greg now?
Danny! Papa is back! My kid is watching Billion Surprise Toys (yes, that is my life) and they brought back the old dad character.
Pinnochio kinda sounds like danny
I thought Marmaduke was like a good dog why did they just completely make him basically a sadist who used to lead a thug life
Its concerning how i hesitate before clicking on every one of your videos ._.
THIS IS ALL MY SISTER WATCHES ITS SO ANNOYED SHE WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!
I laughed so hard during this video
i love the original marmaduke
danny is really the cure for my depression and suicidal urges. plz post more often i dont know how mutch time i can handle without danny in my life
my favorite part of this movie was when marmaduke said "it's marmin' time" and then he marmed all over the bad guys
i remember the original live action marmaduke. idk if it was good but i remember liking it as a child. and i say it again, i dont remember the movie but i remember watching it. i might be wron but what ever.
I should watch it 😃 No I’m not gonna watch it nevermind
the rich british dog trainer has tumblr sexyman vibes
my dog killed a be 😫
Marmadookie
That is the worst fight scene man has ever created
BRO IM LITTERALY CRYING TEARS OF LAUGHTER, WHEN HE SAYS HE KICKED THE DOG I GOT A PETA AD ABOUT A DOG 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Weird-ass animation styles can work so well but they did it oh so very wrong
Bruh I thought this was on Disney minus.
P
I'm fairly certain these movies are tax write offs lol
17:21 and 19:23 <333333
This video is probably more higher on trending than the movie
how did you allway look the same for more than 3 yeah??? (i'm suck at english i better tyes at QWERTY)​
y e s
I can’t stop staring at that one hair in Danny’s fringe that’s jiggling throughout the video
Movie bad
I started laughing at the fake death scene
I’m going back to DVDs, nothing good is coming from streaming except whatever Disney+ is churning up.
bro marmaduke lookin lika a dam horse 💀💀💀
that was a truly fvcking abysmal movie. gah damn.
WTH  18:41
Watch the live action marmaduke it is way better
IM DYING LMAO
the characters look like spoons without a dip 💀
Marmaduke gets put down
Never did I root for marmaduke, the characters are just… not it Istg. Maybe if they got us to like the dog then maybe? but no
Yes     I'm Greg
11:32 does it bother anyone else that the bully cheerleaders are the only darker skinned people in this movie?
i was forced to watch this movie with my friend and i was like what the helll is this movie
Why do they look like hello neighbor art
Great video, Drew!
You need a counter for every time you say Marmaduke
haha good one danny. please never do that under-the-desk angle ever again.
"At the hands sorry paws of this dog" 😂
too bad Danny, I live under your desk now
did they just take the plot of the movie already named marmaduke from the early 2000s?
how did that dog lift the building from inside of the building
i dont know why but ive always had an ick or weird anxiety when it comes to animated movies/shows like this. like the animation looks so crusty, or grimy. like i feel like i could see this stuff in my fever dreams and whenever i see animations with such a gross looking style it makes me really anxious😭
You need to be careful with this territory Danny. If your videos trash bagging movies get too popular, your entire career could become hours a day of watching bad movies. You don't wanna be the next Ralph Sepe. That man hates life. So don't forget to switch it up.
could you please make a video on the show called BarRescue, they have many clips on youtube!
Not just movies, but series also.
Danny please say ur planning on reacting the Pauly Shore Pinocchio sequal where he weirdly hits on the teenage princess and he's a mailman who for some reason ends up having to marry her
So there is actually a different movie called maramaduke I used to watch as a kid, and it was pretty much the same plot, but the og movie is so much better. This is a ripoff
Holy fuck this is one of your funniest videos. I was watching this while working out and had to stop biking because I kept laughing so much
starting from 17:20 his whole speech😂
These videos keep me sane.
I subscribed and turned on notifications, time to be Greg
i think with pinocchio, they acquired the right to what ended up being a terrible russian animated movie and decided to just cut their losses and try to make it “so bad it’s good”
The fact that Netflix made sure this movie got made while canceling the show Boons and Curses is honestly criminal
My nephew loved this movie and watched it at-least once a day for a week
12:20 possibly the funniest part of the video.
I am glad I get to watch the ad section from my fantasy POV
😂😂
If I watched this as a really small kid, I’d get nightmares.
markaduke is my brothers favorite movie… he’s 3.
The 2010 film was better
I was up late with a stomach ache watching this, trying to watch something that would distract me from throwing up. It did not help my stomach ache
its *HIM* ITS _GUY_
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HOW DANNY LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DAD?!?
Surely potty breaks for dogs are allowed. They can’t speak English or be told to go potty before
17:37
Reset 0:00
Lmfao
I saw this a few months ago when my little brother was watching it and my family all started making fun of it 💀
I'm dyslexic, and a few days ago (right before this vid came out) I was laughing to my partner about how I read "Max and Duke" from a fic as Marmaduke
The actual Marmaduke movie was awesome. A staple of my childhood. Magical. Abysmal. Mystical. Magical. Magical.  Actually, listen. My drunken state has me feeling some kinda way about this. Marmaduke was a great fuckin movie. I remember watching marmadukenon multiple occasions with my family as a kid. Why would they do this. How could they do this. O know you guys all watched the actual Marmaduke movie. I k ow you you n ow how good it is. Who did this.
Well the movie implies that in-universe the dogs have human-level intelligence so he can be held accountable for fucking everything up 💁
gosh... the name Marmaduke has gone down, the original was weirdly better
The fact that the mom can even keep herself balanced with that anatomy is just marvelous
the original marmaduke movie was great and was my childhooddddddd
I personally am offended that nobody has mentioned that Marmaduke was in fact a live action movie made in 2010 that I was absolutely obsessed with
Man they really butchered this. The original movie was so good.
i feel so bad that pete davidson had to work in this movie. he better have been paid good.
Isn’t this movie just an animated copy of the 2010 marmaduke
You know a movie's bad when you not only aren't attached to the MAIN CHARACTER, but also be upset that he isn't dead. You have to TRY to fuck up that badly
Damn, it's so clear that they were trying to make stylized character designs but it lacks any care or passion, and just feels so flat.
As a dog trainer, this was extra hard to watch. But also I think the trainer was talking to Marmaduke. It's actually pretty easy to speak dog and no, it's not barking. It's body language. Dogs communicate through their body positions. Verbalizing is more like punctuation: if they bark/whine/etc they are yelling at you and you have to look at them to see what they're yelling.  And you can speak back to them with your own body language and the limited vocabulary you taught them (through use of association with body language). So the movie definitely took some liberties with this concept (if they even knew about it) but also considering that it seems like only the trainer could talk to him, that's what I think is happening.  Also, what kind of stupid ass dog trainer takes a dog to a competition he's clearly not ready for and doesn't even keep him contained (away from food)? Those deaths are on his hands, imo
I literally have to watch Marmaduke 5 times a day because my niece loves it lol (Btw she’s 2 years old)
*Carson*  Usually tall with brown f-boy hair and blue eyes. He makes girls fall for him but they can never let go because he’s ‘perfect’. His personality is distinctive and he’s usually really funny. He makes most people laugh. He plays baseball but isn’t good at most sports. Once you fall for him, you can never let go.
Yo Billion Surprise Toys made a movie
Oooooo the kick from  Kong pow!!
Did anyone else grow up watching the live action Marmaduke movie?
I was in a second grade classroom during indoor recess and the teacher put this on for the kids and they all immediately started asking her to change it💀 they were appalled (rightly so)
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
Danny PLEASE do a video where you check out knock off Minecraft games because there’s A LOT and they’re all bad.
"i think 0 children has watched this movie" my sister: O MY GOD THIS IS MY FAVOURITE MOVIE
Well they aren't making them by accident
How's this movie got 0% with THAT mom 😏
11:50 but then again, why would cheerleaders be watching the news
the skinny people remind me of spiders, and it terrifies me
no offense danny but I couldn't even watch this video cuz I was so disturbed by the movie Marmaduke. 😳🤢
I can’t believe they cancelled Wings of Fire and Bone to put out shit like this
That upwards shot during the ad read 🥵 🔥
They should’ve gotten someone like maybe Jim Carrey who has a background of being in wacky movies to play a character like marmaduke.
yes, kids love this movie. i’m a nanny and have seen this movie 9 TIMES WITH THE SAME FAMILY
This movie feels like it was written by a fucking ai and its maddening
Honestly I’ve stepped on so many pointy things that it doesn’t bother me anymore. Yeah I’ve had glass in my foot for about 4 days, yes I’ve had many splinters, yes I’ve stepped on legos, but I’m gonna still walk inside and outside barefoot. Sometimes when it’s hot I like washing my car and I purposely get my socks soaking wet to help me cool down. I don’t mind wet socks, I DO mind wet sleeves 🍑🍑🍑
I love spaghetti
I wish everyone who clicked on this video the most love, peace and abundance. You’re so much closer than you realize. I love you 😆😆😆
i would give this movie if i could a straight up 16million / 10 of cringeeeeeeeeeeeee edit: i replaced "for" to "of" after 2 weeks
this movie was the worst thing i’ve ever had to sit through with my siblings
goofy 5:02
the dog pooping in random places and “being funny” reminded me of that one episode of jersey shore where mike congratulated jwowws dog to shit everywhere and left it there all over the house
Why does the song at the end sound like every clean version of a song ever
mosarof gaming 999+
love the implication that hypnosis isnt real
18:09 that animation reminds me of those cursed critikal animations with the movements, like its so trash 😭
Fun fact marmaduke is actually a comic strip
Danny, you look like Guy.
Guy didn’t hypnotize Marmaduke because he never actually cared about training him. He just wanted to financially exploit the family and bring reproach on Marmaduke’s good name.
this movie is literally about a dog with a crippling eating disorder that pushes his family into poverty and suffering.   9/10.
My mom chose this movie for movie night, my 5yr old  sister seemed to enjoy it (I think), but I put in ear buds after I saw the pool tsunami. I’m traumatized 😟
So my niece and nephew were watching this when I came home from work and I tore it apart and let my inner Greg spill out. I am no longer allowed to watch the movie with them lol.
It's not only weird to me that j.k. Simmons and David koechner did this movie when they really didn't have to, but it's bummer that Brian hull also did this movie when I personally believe he's too talented for it
DADDY DANNY 😩😩😩😩🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
DADDY DANNY 😩😩😩😩🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
DADDY DANNY 😩😩😩😩🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Now danny legally has to cover the live action Marmaduke movie.
So y’all telling me the dog that lifted up the entire convention center wasn’t iggy from jojo? 🧍🏽‍♀️
I don’t wanna say it Danny, I don’t….but you and the husband in this movie look the same 😂
Maybe they were just making their version of Walter the Farting Dog
Wait, is nobody going to comment on how Danny literally just punched a hole In the wall for a video?
EVERYONE HERE SHOULD RATE THIS MOVIE A 5/5
guy is LITERALLY wearing the oncelers suit from the lorax
stuff like this makes me wonder if there are contracts that need to be honored, and this is cheaper than breaking them.
yo we hit trending lets go bro
Ok I know it was just a brief mention in the ad read but HUGE TRIGGER WARNING FOR WHIPLASH!!!!!! It literally centers an abusive, homophobic teacher. The f slur is needlessly thrown around a lot and it is a very intense viewing experience imo. 😬
I used to read Marmaduke in the Sat/Sunday comics in the newspaper when I was a kid ... I just dated myself. Anyway, it was a cute, 4-panel comic. Netflix getting their hands on it _guarantees_ it will *suck.*
Remember the other Marmaduke movie from the 2000s that was infinitely better? Yea me neither
The fact that the mom can even keep herself balanced with that anatomy is just marvelous
Congrats on 31 on trending
I swear that this was the plot of the 007-American Dad spoof episode. The movies are filled with bad ones ones the only one worth watching is so emotional the viewers cry themselves to death.
Yeah, what's up with dat
Nose to arm ratio had me dead💀
“Humanity is evolving, just backwards.”
Yeah my mom let my nieces watch this 🤦🏼‍♀️
im not gonna say it
Actually my little brothers watched this. They are 6 and 7 years old lol
How can you like genuinely animate a bulldog lifting a convention center and see nothing wrong with it
Jojo reference
The range of netflix from artistic wonders like she ra to this movie and 70% of its other content is just one of the things that makes Netflix a little funky
the 2010 marmaduke was my favorite movie at one point of my life and i’m surprised no one’s talking about
Luckily we are also getting quality animated content from Netflix as well. Sea Beast is honestly the best animated film of the year so far.
I some how just watched a review of this dumb ass movie 🐎shit
This was a great video
But I like marmaduke
why is this movie a thing help
Yes! since people will buy anything. Look at Hallmark channel
Danny — totally unrelated, but I keep getting a “badad “ pop up from Evony basically making fun of apps that advertise as something they’re not.  Basically an ‘anti-badad” haha!  You’ll have to check it out!
This movies just looks like a quick and easy check for Pete Davidson. Aside from money, I can’t imagine what would possess someone to be a part of this.
5:16 Bro look at heez tees, yo'h, ai no wai'ee zats a Bri'isch humanoid creature
danny: he should be rushed to the hospital me: you mean vet? 10:20
When I was a kid I didn't watch movies with dogs bc they would always get hurt and I would cry, and now I'm watching this
Why does Danny look like the dad
this movie is the worst thing to happen to dogs since I told my puppy she could not, in fact, eat my entire steak dinner.
As an artist who mostly focuses on character design, I commend the animators for their sheer commitment to making every single character look as grotesquely unpleasant as possible. I'm not even being sarcastic: genuinely impressed. Didn't think I'd find a less appealing animating style than the Adam's Family movie from a few years back, but damn...Marmaduke's mouth movements when he talks made me want to close out of this video entirely
I walked in on my little sister watching this movie and I was flabbergasted.
Unpopular opinion. I kinda like the movie. Also list more Netflix movies
Pete left snl for this
The original Marmaduke movie slaps though
You don’t have enough life experience to determine anything in life.
I didn't think I'd see Scooby-Doo if he was on drugs in a Netflix movie
And no mention that Zeus is voiced by the legendary J. K. Simmons?
1:22 untrue
I just graduated 8th grade two months ago (ages 13-14 for reference 💀💀💀). On the last day of school my history teacher played Marmaduke for us expecting us to like it. We spent the entirety of the class period bodyshaming the triangular characters and making fun of the dogs lmao. BTW I would never bodyshame any real person, but those body types were definitely not realistic.
At 4:58 I’m sure Drew would be overwhelmed to have his biggest fan in an amazing movie
I think that everyone in this universe has a unique power. Zeus can hypnotize people, Guy can talk to dogs and summon sharks (7:23), and Marmaduke can transport food that he just ate to a void dimension. If he were learn how to transport things that he *didn't* eat to that void and keep them there, he could solve the US's issue with milk. However, it takes a lot of energy to keep the food in the void, so that's why it all came back after exercising a tiny bit. The trainer should have focused on strengthening Marmaduke's magical ability so that he could learn to hold the portal closed and insrease the capacity of the void. Imagine a world without landfills. It would be so good.
It seems like they deliberately make these low-budget movies in order to make a profit. If they do happen to get a descent original series then it will most likely get canceled.
I AM GREG
Let's not forget that the pitbull lifted the building WHILE HE WAS IN IT
Considering that nothing was achieved the whole movie, I guess it is OBJECTIVELY the worst movie ever. They were not even trying to tell a story
At least the 2010 marmaduke isnt as awful as well.... whatever this is
So I watched a utube post of that one guy who can make u famous? It be funny if u became famous but from a person in your comments section faster!
Just liked and subbed. I am Greg 😎😎
I love your vids
Marmaduke comics>marmaduke movie
They are making propaganda movies that doesn't have to make money as they are being paid by the people that control ALL! As long as the MESSAGE is in the movie or TV show viewers and money making are secondary.
to be fair, Marmaduke in Spanish was so so so much better
"why are movie studios making bad movies on purpose??" you, that's why
Did he actually put a hole in the wall 😭
No joke, after the Pinocchio clip, my sibling and I went "I've got the whole world to see!"
It was proven that Pixar Mom syndrome isn’t a thing. Most Pixar moms are creatures and animals.
I’m not new here. I’m old there.
Danny should make a movie comparing this shit show to the original marmaduke movie from like the 00s
Is it worse then morbius
I watched this movie with my family and after within 5 seconds I just already know it was going to be a terrible movie, and I already regretted watching it
I can't believe Justin Chad is in this movie and they didn't even credit you and Drew
You’re feeding, you’re literally feeding
I had so much fun watching the original marmaduke (the live action) that watching this was just.....painful
Netflix is just too big for the need to make any decent shit
surprised to see all the comments are about Netflix making cheap movies  and none about how Danny looks like the dad
This was worse than Ratatoing
the movies are so bad its funny thats what i love abt netflix
My last day of school: My science teacher turns this crap on to keep us quiet: I’m going into High School:
The original live action Marmaduke is way better
Very true
oh my goddd! but live action marmaduke was soooo good!! please watch the live action one
Im still sad that the Dragon Prince didn't get another season
Bro I watched this movie in my school I therapy
I don't know how they blackmailed JK Simmons into being a voice in that movie.
Children will watch anything and love it. Netflix knows this.
God that character design is so gross lol
I liked the part where halfway through the movie kanye west broke into the studio and started strangling pete davidson
I figured out that the dog training trick works on kids to
No cause I was just watching this with my little cousins 😩🤢
It's YOUR fault...all YOU people, for sharing your NF accounts and MAKING THEM make this drivel.
Marmaduke straight up Scooby-Doo - jack skeleton lookin slim jim
I am genuinely so upset that these other incredibly talented voice actors' voices were wasted on this movie.
It has to be about money laundering, it just has to
Marmaduke makes water boarding look relaxing
It makes me fucking uncomfy that the blonde dog has eyebrows 😭😭
Note that while the Dad is against the Dog the Mom is vouching for Marmaduke despite all he’s done, this leads me to believe that Marmaduke on top of doing all the stuff he’s done is sleeping with the Mom.
I was just thinking “You know, this doesn’t seem too bad. Like yes it’s ugly, kind of weird, and disrespectful to the original source material. But at least it’s being somewhat unique, and doesn’t have that gummy 3D look, I could see why a small child might like it,”………..and then we got to that dog show scene
so cool that Guy is the biggest fan of Danny’s!!
the family is still in a ton of depts btw
But Marmaduke should be the easiest thing to adapt to film!!!
i cannot believe how atrocious the animation is.  it’s seriously like a mobile game ad even though that’s an overdone joke lately. that’s literally exactly what it looks like
Did anyone get an ad for pee pee before this? I am not joking.
most underated youtuber
Does anyone remember the live action Marmaduke movie? It was so much better than this.
why are we sitting under your table while you frame marmaduke for selling our online data?
"his name is Guy, he is drew goodens biggest fan" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I mean, I shouldn’t really care at this point, but I still always feel really bad for the original source materials for the awful reboots or mediums that they become. Marmaduke was never a comic panel that really appealed too much to me, but it was still a big figure in the American comic industry, and could be genuinely heartfelt and funny. Even that awful live-action movie from the 2000s was atleast enjoyable for some kids. But this is just soulless, and I feel so bad for anyone who experiences it as their first introduction to the property, as well as anyone in the original creators family (since I think he’s dead?) that has to see it
There already IS A MOVIE named "Marmaduke" and the main character is the SAME breed. Definitely 100x better.
The original marmaduke is 100% better
I subscribed I am Greg
danny why are you ignoring the fact that the father looks like you… just accept your fate of having every brown haired cartoon man be your twin, it’s okay i promise
does danny like only look in the viewfinder lol
convinced this movie was just made by someone with a fart kink
One of the biggest issues has been the shift from actual voice actors to any famous person the production can get their hands on
This movie is 2004 powered by Source.
Do you seriously thnk that Netflix would waste money if they had quality ideas to produce?  Hell no.  The talent from where new ideas should be coming from never developed because it was glued to a phone all day.  Unless some boomer comes up with a great idea I don't see anything worth watching coming out of this country at all.  Britain maybe, America - defintely no way.
This is why Netflix is raising the prices
The art style for this movie looks godawful. Marmaduke's eyes are too small, his jowls are too angular, his body proportions look wonky, and he doesn't emote enough for a cartoon dog (a good reason to not use CGI if you didn't have the budget for stylized 3D animation).
Its sad really. I don't know what's worse this or the live action movie they did a few years ago. Why.. why are they so ugly.. Why would you do this?
Not to be confused with the live action adaptation in 2010, “Marmaduke”.
The kids in that movie are one piece character’s🤣
Sea monster wasnt that bad
dear god i just watched this before even seeing he made this video
Yes, yes they are. Very few worth watching.
I remember seeing the movie Marmaduke throughout my childhood (the original, not this abomination), and lemme tell you, early 2000s talking dog CGI is still much better than whatever this is
Damn guy took a page straight out of Cesar Millans book
2:44 I noticed this. It’s a very inaccurate depiction of bigger body types as “inflated”. Actual fat people do not move like that.
And also!  That hypnotic win by Zeus the villain-dog is straight up Hypno-Toad from old Futurama.  Way to rip off a much better piece of entertainment, Netsux.  All hail the Hypno-Toad!
This film feels very fetishy 😭
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The animation is about as good as toy story one
If the movie was actually realistic then the fart scene would have been worse because in real life as we all know farts are invisible
18:08
It's been said a thousand and more times already, but it really can't be stressed enough just how TRASH Netflix's 3D animation is. From the non-stop stream of garbage Netflix original "anime" made with this 3D animation tech, to dumpster fires like this movie, it's only getting worse.
OK BUT THE LIVE ACTION WAS IS TOP TIER
Does anyone else remember that live action movie marmaduke from 2010? I honestly don’t remember all that much about it but I do remember it absolutely slapped
You should review, “The Duff”
uh summa-lumma dumma-lumma u assumin im a human  what i gotta do to get it through to you that im superhuman
it looks like its from the 2000s oh my god 💀💀💀
At 7:49 his ear goes in the window
I’m cringing so hard😭 I love Pete Davidson but this was the worst things my ears and eyes have seen/heard.
6:32
Why the fuck would this ever exist.
its giving garfield 😭
That animation is just... *chef's kiss*       Really seals the 'looks like a crappy middle school 3d madelling class project' look.
If I was Pete Davidson, I'd be ashamed of this movie too
plot twist.... netflix made this movie and paid danny to review it and are profiting off this video
Danny I'm begging you to react to the new Zombies 3 movie its so... interesting.. and frustrating.
I think Danny needs to watch Wiener Dog Nationals now
I’m not rich, or a man, but I am British. I would love to be the bad guy. I volunteer.
this movie sounds like one of my horrible last minute fictional story essays
this is genuinely some of the most hideous and disgusting character design i’ve ever seen oh my god
Bro I saw this movie at my local cinema they had a poster of the movie💀 I also saw the trailer on the screen before my movie came on and I could just tell it was horrible like the animation is so bad and it just looked goofy and when I see you now reacting to it I am not surprised by how bad it is
the animation in this movie causes me physical pain. i cannot even look at it. how did this get released………
dan dan bam bam
Me and my Lil sister watch your videos together. She hasn't watched that movie but she didn't seem to like it she said it was disgusting even to her.
The dog trainer character is based on Cesar Millan. Whenever the dog is not cooperating just kick him
I took a look a that shit on netflix, and decided not to look at it
Didn't even mention that J.K. friggin SIMMONS is Zeus in this movie!
looking for the srquel with mpreg marmaduke
bruh Netflix is throwing so Sony can buy their cartoon/anime division
throwing their duces up? It's throwing their dukes up.
You said no redeeming qualities but Pete Davidson
19:23 a poorly animated rapping dog.. Hey, I've seen this one!
This has to be created by the same people that made Plan Bee
Thank you for barking, good sir.
Guy spent so much time with dogs he became a dog whisperer, and I think that's why Guy can speak to Marmaduke and listen to Marmaduke be a bad boy.
Whoever made this movie should make mobile game ads-
THIS IS ALMOST THE SAME AS THE REAL LIFE MARMADUKE AND ACTED BY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!
I was really hoping he’d talk about the 2010 marmaduke at least once 😭
ok but why does danny look like that on the thumbnail he looks silly hehe
This hurts me a little. Marmaduke was a big part of my childhood and it’s still my favorite movie still. Netflix get it together please-
2:20 Artistically speaking, it is refreshing to see different interpretations of the human body. Bodies built to reseamble humans, but odd to stand out ...but realistically speaking it has to be one of the ugliest shit ever and if my eyes would vomit they could
8:05
the original live action marmeduke was my childhood. This is blasphemous
I missed the movie review videos
This movie is actually based on a bad live action movie from 2010 that wasn't even received so well anyways,  so I have no idea why this was made
Thanks for all the laughs Danny! I really need it, two of my dogs passed away earlier this week. One of my dogs attacked the other one and then she passed away, and we had to put down the one that attacked her. I love the video!
So your opinion is the only one that matters? If you say a movie is bad, then it's bad? I don't think your opinion matters at all.
Zues looks like Moist Critical lol
At the start where you gave your rating on the movie I thought to myself "no way its that bad" I was very wrong. I give this movie a Rather drink Bleach / 10
Bro they took the shape of the veggie tales characters and put them in this movie💀
Is it just me or does the dad in this movie look really similar to that one head elf in 'The Happy Elf' who despised Eubie.
He the dog whisperer, of course he can talk to marmaduke  🙄
Man, they ruined the live action movie. It was so much better and it was my childhood. The fact they did this to it is just not okay. They touched on great topics in the live action film. Such as feeling depressed and unwanted. It was an amazing film to grow up on. But then they made this and it broke my heart to see what they turned it into.
No because the original Marmaduke is a good movie, this is awful
Please review the new Jurassic world. It is one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen
I can't tell you the number of Netflix cartoon movies my little kids have literally said "I hate this, can we please watch something else" like 5 minutes in.
who remembers the og marmaduke movie?? noone is talking about it
3:27 the dad is Chet holmgren
"And how did your dog escape?" "My dog stepped on a bee"
there are good movies and yes there are some bad ones to lol
Why are all the cheerleader bullies poc...
*📷🇵🇭 Keep it up🎙* 🇵🇭
Danny, hypnosis is real in our universe
Dude if a dog with the vocabulary and intellect of a human tried to beat *me* ofc I'd swing back. 🤣 That trainer did good, or did we forget how the dog beat up the dad in the beginning of the movie?
You in the thumbnail looks like you but also doesn’t
U disgust me Danny Marmaduke is a masterpiece. Expertly crafted to be a gut wrenching, thought provoking masterpiece combining the social pressure put on by society with some fucking dog. Disgraceful that you would insult its integrity like this.
I don't know who this is but he's unfortunately correct.  Netflix has been sucking this year when you compare the quality of content they used to put out :/
The fact that the original Marmaduke is a classic movie makes this even worse
7:50 maybe it's supposed to be portrayal of the trainer being a literal "dog whisperer" in that he just understands dogs like it was another person, there are a lot of professionals in the dog field who claim to be so in tune with dogs that they know exactly what they think, and I think that's why the trainer is "on his level" as far as communication while everyone else just sees a dog who doesn't understand anything and there's n o point trying to understand him. Which is kinda sad tbh, you don't need to be a "dog whisperer" to pay attention to any animal's needs, you just need to take the time and care with them to learn their needs. The movie would be better if it focused on this point more openly because that's something that should be talked about, but it's something that probably very few of us even noticed.  And as for "is marmaduke speaking English or is he barking" I think it's probably neither, I feel like when this is portrayed in most movies (except for Dr. DoLttle where they clearly show that he is speaking the animal's noises back to them) if it's not explained, we can infer that the person is understanding the dog through being in tune with animals so deeply, or through a superpower like telepathy, hearing the dog's thoughts, not spoken words, or feeling like they know the dog's thoughts through empathy and reading its body language. Adversely the person is only speaking in normal human language, but the dog actually understands them, in fact they understand all the other people who aren't talking to them too, this makes sense because dogs have more concern with understanding what we're saying, than we do, we are their whole world, take them into our homes and we're all they know, they are desperate to understand what we're saying, it's why they learn what "good boy" means and "no" because they want to please their parent(s) who they dote on unconditionally. I'm sure a lot of writers do intend it to be telephatic, or that the person understands barking or the dog is speaking English but only to that person, however if it's not explained, I always just assume the person's speaking normally and dogs already know what we're saying, they're just not as capable of expressing their responses in our language, but in this case the character in question understands the dog through experience and a true empathy (even though in real life I feel like a lot  - not all but a lot - of people who claim to understand dogs are full of it).
you should do a video on ad minigames
6:20 and then his twig leg snaps because it's a fully grown great dane XD
"This dog has gone too far! We never trained him or taught him anything but he should know how to behave!" Classic trophy dog owners lol they want a purebred dog that was literally bred to assist with hunting lions, and then they expect it to sit in a little round pillow and look cute all day and not move, without even teaching it that's what they expect XD cartoons are getting too real man.
This like at 2:51 is one of the funniest things I have ever heard 😂😂😂 “I guess they decided to take a page out of Pixar’s book on how to make a mom…then they ignored all the other pages about how to make a movie”
Bruh these movies are from the people who made stranger things and cobra Kai
This feels like a bad Norm of the North rip-off which is like saying I pissed on a piece of elephant dung
Well, that was one of the movies ever made
I'm actually shocked by how BAD the animation is in the year of our Lord 2022.  The character design, the settings, the effects- everything is so poorly done. This isn't even stylized, it's just lazy
ah yes the three genders: eerily slender, bouncy egg and mom
the fart scene where marmaduke (or whatever the hell his name is) makes the weird ass face covered in green fart clouds (cringing rn) is literally just "gacha fart" videos. i wish i was joking tbh </3
My sisters literal fave film is Marmaduke, I'm questioning her sanity
Marmaduke had an original that was wayyyy better
I remember the live action Marmaduke that movie was actually good to me. I don’t care how cringe it was it was good. The cartoon is worse…
Didn’t they make a live version with George Lopez
“Why don’t they just put Marmaduke to sleep?!” -Jake Morgandorfer (Daria’s father)
I’ve seen worse movies like rock dog 2. Also the Star Wars part was pretty funny.
Danny keeps getting more and more handsome
omg the kids at billys party look like iv veggietales characters had humansonas or something
What makes a movie like this terrible, while something like T&J is a cult classic. Like how is things making no sense here weird af, but in T&J it is just funny. No  bash on the video. I agree. Just genuinely curious what makes the difference.
Wow.
I feel like I'm the end the studios make money so they don't care about quality.
why does every shitty movie start with a narrator. you're a visual medium. utilize it
I think the trainer and marmaduke have, what I call, the scooby doo effect. Nobody else can talk to scooby but the 4 main characters.
One thing the writers didn't get about the Marmaduke comics is that it's charm comes from the humans being confused and amused by their dog's antics. Marmaduke doesn't talk or have inner thought bubbles so it's just an everyday family laughing and joking about their dog's odd behavior. When all is said and done, they love their dog. The problem with how this was written is that Marmaduke is given a terrible personality and the plot revolves around fart jokes and other dumb gags.
Danny has the best slappable face ever.
My 3 year old sister watched this movie everyday and loves it idk why
I stg this was a live action movie that was released in like the 2000s/2010s
THE ORIGINAL MARMEDUKE IS SO GOOD. NOT THIS CARTOON ONE
Why did the ending animation remind me of that bad Titanic animated movie where there was a dog randomly rapping(which Danny also reviewed) 😔
Danny, this video sent both me and my roommate passively listening into hysteria. Great work, dane.
This movie looks like it was made by the people who made Rhapsody Street Kids
Ironically a P Davidson commercial came up while I was playing this video  Confirmed he is not afraid to do promotions or ads
Yooo it’s number 6 on trending
I never even want to watch this garbage. It looks terrible.
React to d billions music videos please
My moms friend made marmaduke lmao
Netflix glory days are behind us, their stock is dropping and their viewing list as well. Last couple time I went on there there is simply nothing worth watching........maybe I'm just geting old.
Just pointing out that Pete Davidson has IBS or something and he's playing a dog with gastrointestinal problems.
Anyone else read the dog diary books, this gives me mad dog diary vibes
*Mahmut*  A man who has vast knowledge and wants to share it with you. He is extremely intelligent but never arrogant about it! He wants to be easily understood. He has this way of making you laugh when he tells the nerdiest jokes and his laugh is also funny! :) He is genuine and kind. He has this adorable way of being awkwardly shy, but making you blush even more! He has compassion and will look out for the underdog. He is generally interested in science, history, literature and religion. You will cherish him because he is unforgettable!
mamarduke
i lost it when danny punched the wall LMFAOOO
WAKE UP BABE DANNY POSTED
This gives me a Garfield show kinda vibe accept Garfield show is way better
You should review the movie ground hog Dave one and ground hog Dave two
I saw a picture of it and thought it was just a dumb Scooby Doo rip off lol
This guy keeps calling me greg idk why, my names daniel im starting to have an existential crisis
Remember when we were our parents reading the Marmaduke comics in the newspaper? And then Owen Wilson made a movie… and now apparently some lunatics from Illumination made a movie for Netflix, and OH MY GOD J.K. SIMMONS WAS IN THIS MOVIE?! There are tears stinging my eyes. Who kidnapped J.K. Simmons? Help him. Let him go.    I blame Illumination for the body types and everything wrong with the movie industry. I don’t even know if they had a hand in this, but those weird bodies are giving off Illumination “artistry”   I miss the days when we just had Gru.
“For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. “Go and sin no more”-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you…because He loves you.
I actually dm Danny on Twitter about this movie, bc my middle school reading teacher made us all watch this on the last day of school. It was horrible and we all looked like we were high after that.
You got 12 on the trending page 🔥🔥🔥
lol your rant about a bad movie is about as long as the bad movie
short answer, YES
I cannot accept this, what the heck is this. I grew up on the live action Marmaduke and I'll be honest, I havent seen it in awhile but its way better then this.
THANK GOD IVE BEEN WANTING HIM TO TALK ABT MARMADUKE
14:22 wtf why was THIS not the plot of the movie?
This movie is one of my younger brothers favourite movies and he has watched is so many times so its really funny to see danny make a full video on how bad it is
I watched the live action marmaduke,its easily way better than this horse shite
guy looks like danny
G r e g
There’s a much better marmaduke movie with a cgi dog and cat soooooo plus it’s a 2000s movie
I swear to god every single bad animated movie has "bouncing egg" as SEVERAL characters
This looks like a disguised fart fetish video???? The animation and all have exactly the same feel as those weird things on DeviantArt
Maybe a new version with Kim kardashian in it ?
dear god its starting  run danny or they will come for you  next run get out
maybe we need to send him to obedience sc- BOOM - the dad 2022
Why isn’t there porn on this list
Review Car Go, the horrible Cars copy cat!!! Please
why does this looks like something straight out of video brinquedo
ain't no way they straight up put william afton in that movie 💀💀
They trying to make it memeable like morbius and despicable me
Was thus movie made in 2022
this feels like a direct to dvd movie that i would have picked out at blockbuster as a kid and be weirdly nostalgic for
It's frustrating that Netflix canceled the Bone cartoon series and made this instead.
7:55 I said do you speak eh my language.... he just smiled and gave me a veggiemite sandwich
I blame Kim...she voiced one dog in paw patrol and now she's like I did it ...so u have to do it
מי יודע
It just hurts me that Marmaduke is on the same platform as Arcane.  *Marmaduke. ARCANE.*  Make it make sense.
this somehow looks worse than Ratatoing
I'm convinced they're just laundering money at this point
Whats that thumbnail
When I watched this movie with mu little brother who forced me in it, my mind was already telling me that someday Danny would react to this and male fun of it.
Oh no it looks like corporate animation
Danny I subscribed with the bell am i truly greg
And then Netflix wonders why they are'nt getting any new subscribers.
this video must be at least as bad as the movie
19:50 that angle with a shirt saying "daddyboy" may have not been the best choice lmao
There was a live action Marmaduke movie in 2010 featuring Owen Wilson AND Emma Stone that wasn’t as bad as this bs but it was still pretty bad, you should do a video on that
It feels like Netflix saw the low budget Armageddon movies from Studio Universal being ripped apart online and ironically gaining success and thought if we do enough terrible animations it'll get the same reaction.
I love you and I love your videos
This movie most likely was made when someone was high. The other older movie Marmaduke, is actually good. Idk if it’s like the comics bc I never read them. But the movie is like how marmaduke is always doing troubles but tries to stop bc he falls in love with a collie who is dating a rich Doberman, so they do a dog contest and tries to win her over but his friend, actually likes him and when he realizes he likes her too they get together? And marmaduke and the collie stay friends instead
-6/10 is way too generous
i was waiting for this video to come out as soon as i watched this movie
I WATCHED A MARMADUKE NAMED MOVIE BEFORE AND I WAS ANGERED WHY THERES AN ANIMATED MOVIE NAMED LIKE THAT TOO
5 minutes in and I can’t stop laughing 😭 Danny you make such good content!
This is Scooby Doo's descendant
Why is the ad that I got after this video Pete Davidson talking about shaving his pubes.
My brothers loves this movie😭😭😭😭   ''
pete sounds like kim promised he'd smash if he put the kids to sleep and that's what he's attempting to do now
Danny needs someone to make his thumbnails
Pretty much the only Netflix original show I really like is jurassic world camp cretaceous, I can't wait for season 5, its coming out in 3 days.
Im officially a greg. Look at me now, dad! I did it! Anways, I gotta go blackmail him into being a greg.
Damn.. Dannys hair is diesel af
I think the movie was mid
Dog : ruins family and makes them broke       The Family: bad dog!     Dog: wins dog competition.   Family: he is a very good boy and the best dog alive.    -excuse me what?
Why is no one talking about the name of the dog.
Damn his nose big as hell
are we just going to ignore the fact that it was J.K Simmons voicing the Zeus dog??
The CGI movie was miles better
13:25 "We're paw now" nice
Turns out, Netflix acquired this show from Legacy Classics (despite it looking like utter garbage), it actually did quite well for Netlfix (with over 15m viewing hours by its second week).
Short Answer: Yes, they are looking for a profit so they create these cheap movies intentionally.  They have been reinforcing the idea of quantity over quality because most will still watch these awful movies and see them as a variety of things to watch while browsing through their platform. Over the recent years, people have noticed and it looks like they're trying to bring in some award-winning shows and movies meanwhile as they try to stay ahead of their other streaming competitors.
so they made an animated version of an already shit movie
💙
This was an absolute atrocity to behold. I feel insulted having to look at this monstrosity of a “”””””””””movie”””””””””
Marmaduke is a notoriously shitty old comic strip that literally nobody cares about, let alone knew existed at this point. Why they made 2 movies about it in my lifetime is beyond me
cool video
one time my moms dog shit inside my shoe and that was the only time i wasn’t mad because i wear size 5, so he managed to perfectly stand over my shoe and shit inside it without it getting on the carpet. he got me good
I think the "dog trainer speaking with the dog" thing happens all the time in shows/movies with just as little explanation, I don't think it needs that much dissection; same with a lot of points he's making, trying to argue the realism of a children's animated movie is just a complete reach
I'll give the movie this, I've definately seen a lot worse animation. At least it's smooth and the colours are really nice.
Hypnosis does exist in this world as well lol
The thumbnail dosent look like danny??? Like i cant explain it it looks nothing like him i dont know why please help me he looks so different and it makes him look so old
the dad looks like danny
sadly that i have too suffer watching this abomination of a movie with my siblings 😭
I really think they should make more big budget actually good animations like Arcane. It makes them really memorable so people re-watch it and recommend it to everyone they knos
There should have been a warning at the start of the video to avoid any food during watching it XDD I made a mistake by having breakfast now. The video is great, the movie is sooo groooss

16:20 guy who Guy who has only seen The Disney channel original movie zapped, watching his second movie: “Getting a lot of 'zapped' vibes from this...”
I grew up to 2010 marmaduke as a kid... This reboot is just sad
DANNY IM asking u very nicely PLZZZZZZ do the donkey king jus look it up PLZZZZZZ
Oh yeah and the trainer is definitely the bad guy
The Star Wars title crawl joke actually is pretty funny
This isn't as bad as Rapsittie Kids but am I the only one who for some reason get the same energy from Marmaduke that I did from Rapsittie Kids? I can't quite put my finger on why even. It's just a vibe.
DANNY DANNY I FOUND SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU GREG LETTER PILLOWS
guys i think the movie isn't good, just a feeling
*Interstellar was the last TRULY GOOD movie- TIRED OF SUPERHERO MOVIES!*
Damn Netflix did marmaduke sooooo dirty 2010 version of marmaduke was far superior
Live action Marmaduke >>> Pete Davidson Marmaduke
Did they hire the people from the little panda fighter?
I almost watched that the other day but now I don't have to
the older marmaduke is pretty awesome, the one with live action dogs, i wish the one with pete davidson would have a different name so it wouldn’t show up on google as the leg davidson one
I just found out he’s 28…. Straight up thought hes been 23 for the last 3 years
I want to legally change my name to Greg and nobody has the power to stop me
You should review the live action Marmaduke from 2010. I remember it being a lot better but then again I was a lot younger
They cancelled the New wings of fire show for this-
The animation style is giving goat story
the movie is so bad that i even get bored from watching you talking about how bad it is.
My dad had my 4 siblings, my mom, and me watch this saying that it was the classic tale of Marmaduke and everyone was scarred for life after...
I was going to watch this entire movie as a joke because it seemed like something I could have a good laugh at, I only got through 5 minutes.
why does danny look so off in the thumbnail 😭
THIS IS WORSE THAN RATATÖING 😭😭😭😭
3:23 PLEASE THE EXPLOSION MADE ME LAIGH SO HARD
when i saw the cover for this video i thought it was a kangaroo that was a dog?
The original marmaduke is better
so they’re taking quality content like Criminal Minds off the platform to make space for movies like this. Don’t know bout y’all, but I’m livid.
Netflix knows it's only a matter of time before Disney takes them or causes them to go bankrupt, they've given up at this point.
netflix will drop 100 of the worst movies, and *one*  MINDBENDINGLY INCREDIBLE MOVIE
Lionsgate made the pinnochio one
For the art style they copied the new Addams Family duology's homework but finished writing everything down mere seconds before the teacher came to collect it
DANNY POSTED
watch the live action marmaduke. trust me, it’s nightmare fuel.
I like how the trainer and the dad both look like Danny. It’s amazing that Danny gets to have his own representation in media
What if they're making bad movies on purpose since they get free PR from all the YouTubers trashing on it? It's basically a competition at this point!
Why you blaming Netflix?
I am now a Greg because of this video
My siblings watched that movie, and when they said they had watched it, I thought they were talking about the live action movie that came out when I was a child, but I was so wrong!!!
Netflix canceled a lot of shows for this- They canceled the Wings of fire series (A Series about dragons, with the author helping) It's really disappointing-
This is the plot of an episode of the Cartoon Network show “The Garfield Show”
No cuse I watched this
whys the mom kinda...
Okay but you forgot to mention that Marmaduke is one with the elements. When he fights Guy he is summoning lightning and thunder. At the same time, Guy seems to use some type of holy and or matrix power that gives him a blue aura. And I believe THAT to be the reason why Marmaduke would listen to Guy
15:36 bro straight up made a Reality Marble
marmaduke was a movie in 2010! i used to love it lol i had a pirated version bc i was poor
The stream of milk on this one is strong
Even the vinyl scratching in the theme song is horrible AF
It looks like they took normal humans, then put a Wario/Waluigi filter on them x5. Also, threw in a Pixar mom to get people to watch it for its plot.
god i hate the death fakeout ending trope in animated movies so much, it's so so overdone. it's not a fucking gotcha if everyone knows it's not happening. at this point id be more surprise if the movie really DID end in a death.
There's a different Marmaduke movie, made in 2010, with a similar plot (bad great dane, family troubles, feline sidekick, big contest end, etc.). I think it'd be cool if you did a compare/contrast or review of that one as well, or if you even just watched it since this movie is basically just a cashgrab remake of a movie (of a comic) that was preexisting.
dooo doooo
This movie makes the new resident evil show look good in comparison
8:55 ah, seems as if hollywood, in their desperation for content, have started sourcing concepts from deviantart.
Uh so, my YouTube glitched and this entire time, the video was Steve Harvey's head, just felt like sharing
Bro your Channel is poppin
i just threw up all over my room watching this i dont think its related but it happened when u said fart tzu
This is a disgrace to the live action marmaduke
I remember when he used to to be funny. Unwatchable. Danny is worse than the movies he reviews now
Bruhhhhhhhh..... it's a no match for the marmaduke movie on prime .... it's real good .... but netflix really messed up trying to replicate the og...
I laughed my ass off when I saw those character designs.
This movie is genuinely the funniest thing I've ever seen. How is it real. Every time there's a clip, I assume there's a comedic edit. That is just what it looks like. God bless
i worked at a daycare and we watched this. the kids absolutely loved it.
The dad looks like a clean shaven Shane Madej
theres an unanimated marmaduke movie and its actually pretty good, but my brother watched this movie and said it was one of the worst movies he had ever seen
Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
I laughed the whole way through this
I think they make them bad just so people watch them to see how bad they are. I think its pretty smart.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.   .
how did they make effects in an animated movie look green screened
I didnt know this horrible movie was made by Netflix, but genuinely not surprised that it was
honestly all of netflix’s budget goes to stranger things
Okay but did anyone notice that his ear went through the curtain in 7:50? 💀
has danny never heard of the marmaduke comics
did danny punch a hole in the wall
hey Danny I don’t know if it means anything but I’m having a bad night and often times when I can’t sleep I find myself listening to one of your videos. They seem to be the cure if you’re sad :)💖
the original is better one of my favorite movies
The actual Marmaduke comics style is like a mix of the peanuts and scooby doo not whatever the hell that is and even if they wanted to do 3d models both the Scooby-Doo and peanuts have 3d movies sOoOoO
The real part of marmaduk’s talent show was to resuscitate
Dude😠 I thought you be talking about the different movies on Netflix. Is your video made for babies only.
Oh no I don’t want MarmaDUKE to gather my internet data 😔
I am sorry to say that my sibling, a child, likes this movie. I have failed as a role model.
How accurate is the AirPods tracker thing like the center is where they are because it’s on top the neighbors car and I’m bouta commit a crime in this bitch
Their animated movies are bad live action decent and sometimes good
Who is Greg? Also Pete Davidson is the most unfunny person I can think of.
i would comit war crimes for the daddyboy shirt
DANNY PLS REACT TO NEVER BACKDOWN
How the hell did I watch this whole movie and not know Pete Davidson voiced in it
This movie is one of the movies of all time.
Jsyshsssj
While I was watching this video my little cousin came in and said; "Oh, that's Marmaduke I like that movie!!!" 💀
the way this movie looks is just bad
11:05 wym that is the best scene in the entire movie.
They did Marmaduke dirty. That was a good comic. Very mad
I love your movie reviews. You find the weirdest stuff to review lol
Wait the trainer guy kinda looks like Danny tho
Watch RRR  Thank me later🇮🇳🔥❤️
i fucking love how you express so much that the rich guy is british
I liked the original Marmaduke voiced by Owen Wilson
Y'ALL THERE'S A LIVE ACTION ONE?!
I chose this for my kids to watch and I threw up 5minutes into it ☠️☠️☠️
Please do cloud with a chance of meatballs it is on Netflix
Dude Im dying laughing at this
I think this is supposed to be a remake of a 2010 movie where marmaduke is voiced by owen wilson  Wtf have they done to this movie lmfaoo
I keep saying people are running out of movie ideas 😳
This the most funny danny gonzalez video ive ever seen , good job danny!
dammit dude I forgot how funny you are.
Dude. This is very funny content. Keep it up!
This is so hilarious to watch
Netflix movies are somehow getting worse 💀
Is it just me or does dan remind you of chandler bing from friends 💀
As someone in the arts, this movie is so ugly. like even if it had a compelling, groundbreaking story it would still be horrible just because of the animation style
Putting their deuces up? 😂
This is some Cocomelon graphics
that one old guy to courage 13:22 -13:34
I feel like the new Pinocchio is intentionally bad in a different way that Marmaduke is.  Marmaduke is intentionally bad in the sense that the point of it was 100% just to make money and not a single person cared about making it good, but Pinocchio almost feels like the people working on the adaptation (the movie was originally Russian for those who don't know) were aware of how bad the movie was and just wanted to have fun with it.  It felt more like it could've been a self-aware troll movie whereas Marmaduke just feels like nobody cared.
As a massive fan of the live action marmaduke movie starring Owen Wilson as the voice of marmaduke, this movie is a disgrace.
Having Pauly Shore voice Pinocchio was the best decision ever.
Marmaduke 2010 was a fucking banger. I can’t believe they’ve brought disgrace to the name in this way.
yes
Hey! It’s content. Yep. Content.   Back in the 70’s when the tv networks needed to fill their prime time schedules with something—anything—they pumped out a bunch of low-budget TV movies with aging stars, amateurish direction, and low production values. Some good stuff came out of those years, but it was a minority. Most was really lame and totally forgettable.
Where does batman go to the bathroom?      The batroom.
Danny my dude! Congrats on trending! :D Im proud of you, this video is really funny :)
Danny you need to do one of these on The Even Stevens Movie.
I don't know how this dog is still alive, like the doggo runs from his home to China, then to Egypt and then go swimming in the ocean and finally after being chased by a shark, decided to go home. Like how?
Chistoso.
I don't think Netflix bosses knows anything about movie's they all are bunch of idiots losing money and if the company goes bankrupt a lot jobs will be on the line
Where is your shirt from Danny please I need to know
make a chicken little video
Danny: “Guy’s not the villain”           *Guy: Beats the living sh*tout of a dog*
Lionsgate made another animated movie with the same voice actor from Pinocchio. I kid you not. They are so doing this on purpose.
12:30 the irony here is it costs more than 4.99 for a pooper scooper and 1.99 for a nail clipper.
why are we writing paragraphs on how much we hate netflix
Bro just watch the good marma duke movie from 2010 instead of making a horrible one
why does this entire movie feel like it just has mobile game graphics
I almost spat my almond milk across the kitchen counter when I looked up and saw you holding a BB gun at the end  Todays had some big ups and downs. I didn’t think I’d smile again today, let alone chuckle. But you made me laugh, really hard. Thank you for what you do. You make a difference.
After enlightenment my thoughts were no more. No longer did I hear that voice of condescendence, of judgement. And that was the greatest relief of all. You are enlightened. You are integrated and complete. You are just having fun remembering this. And there are so many ways to have fun!
My teacher made us watch this and my thoughts were just like " what the hell is this 😰"
what in the billions of surprise toys is this
This movie reminds me of hoodwinked and open season. They should have made this in the early 2000s, it would fit in with all the other weird movies with bad and creepy animation.
"Zeus is like a bad evil dog"  This is true both for the dog and the god
My little brother watched that movie and he liked it I thought it was dumb as hell
1.8 million views and this was only uploaded a day ago?? Must be a good video so I’ll watch it now.
Bad movie, bad series, Netflix fails a lot
Wh3n you actually liked the mivie :D
I will not be allowing this adaptation to take away from my childhood love for Owen Wilson’s version of Marmaduke🙅‍♀️
the "guy being drew gooden's biggest fan" joke is so underrated oh my god
I have subbed and turned notifications on. Don't make me beta for you without mentioning me, kid. Yeah that's right, I'm like 3 years older than you so I'm calling you KID. (If you read that in your "I'm a cool guy" voice, that should be funny... FUCKIN' MENTION ME)
the only marmaduke i know is 2010 one voiced by Owen Wilson.  Mothafockin dumbass moviiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  Edit: I LOVED the one with Owen Wilson
u missed an opportunity to say put thei marmadukes up
I cancelled my Netflix account yesterday lmao they’re a MESS watching YouTube commentary videos are more entertaining than the shows and movies themselves
At around 5:30 you can see some family photos on the wall, and honestly, I like that art style! I think this movie would have been a lot more appealing visually in 2D, like it's clear there was art potential somewhere in the studio. (I'm speaking as a 3D artist lol, I'm not just talking out my ass) My guess is they were like 'holy shit, we got Pete Davidson on the production! Quick, write a script!' and that's how we ended up with this.
The first movie I saw of marmaduke was good tho
This is for kids?? Animal cruelty more like it!
I wonder if Danny knows that Marmaduke was a comic strip & that a movie came out in 2010 and that this isn't Netflix's original idea
Subscribed, Alerts on, Truly Greg \m/
8:23 That fucking dog got more game than i will ever have
Netflix took one look at Morbius and thought "we could make a bad movie and people will love it!"
This guy acts in the pubg skit!
10:50 actually, my dog positioned himself to shit directly on top of our x-box once, and ngl looking back that was pretty damn funny
There was a live action that I loved when I was younger but it was a ride but i would like you to review the live action one
Yet they canceled the wings of fire the perfectly good well made series that totally should’ve been made
holy shit i was so sure you had actually punched your wall open i jumped
I don't think a single artist worked on this. Literally just 'I fed a bunch of bootlegs to an AI and got this.'
Do animated shows/movies that look like this scare anyone else? Like why do they look like that??
Bro u need to do zombies 3
I went to a family friends house and one of the toddlers there watched Marmaduke, and I thought it was an early 2000s movie.
in less then a day this vedio took 5 on trending and got 18million views danny off a perk
my dog once pooped in my sister's shoe, that was kind of funny
Should’ve left marmaduke with the Owen Wilson version and been done with it 😭😭
shosuke komi does not approve
No this should be called wishing marmaduke’s death
They are doing this on purpose because they know that kids will watch it and like it. They make a profit of these horrible movies. I watched one on Prime Video and it was horrible Easter movie. Lion of Judah and it sucked. The animation is crap and the plot had nothing to do with Easter. It was just a freaking lamb that ran away. Big whup
pete davidson literally sounds like kim just secretly recorded him in casual conversations, sold it to netflix, then netflix edited it together bringing us ✨marmaduke✨ kim's a true entrepreneur... i could see her doing this🤣💀
10:48 Idk why I laughed so hard (the reaction part)
Younger cousins watched this and did not enjoy it. I came in to watch certain parts and then bought eye bleach.
That how my dad trained my dog when I was little. He wasn’t with us very long 😞
Oh man, I know what you need to watch. There’s this weird as all hell Beowulf movie that involves Beowulf banging Grendel’s mom, if I remember correctly. It’s in this very uncanny-valley animation style, which is what reminded me about it. I watched it a couple years ago because I didn’t want to actually read Beowulf for my high school summer reading, and you can imagine my surprise when I actually got around to reading it and I found out that Beowulf does not, in fact, bang Grendel’s mom  Edit: I’m like 95% sure it’s the 2007 one, which actually has Angelina Jolie in it, which I did not remember at all? It actually seems to have done surprisingly ok, and its Rotten Tomatoes rating is also surprisingly decent, but I thought it was weird and bad so idk
honestly it's so bad & ridiculous that it's hilarious. what makes it even funnier is that netflix doesn't look at it like that probably thinking it was a decent animated movie
why do they keep making Marmaduke movies 😭 like they have perfectly fine ones this bad one was so weird
This probably wasn’t the best thing to watch after I just lost my dog an hour ago.
oof i put this on to try and watch with my daughter. i turned it off after maybe 10 minutes. so creepy, she didn't like it either.
Why does everyone think Zeus is gorgeous, that is a terrifying dog, would not be surprised if that thing was an actual demon.
Zeus needs to pluck his eyebrows-
Guys i had to suffer through watching this on the last day of school
How fucking dare you give marmaduke a negative score! You can’t do that, that’s not how eating systems work! Do you know who I am?! I’M GREG! That’s right the Greg! You do whatever the fuck I tell you, nothing more nothing less!
The og movies was wayyyyy better
i'm all for stylized animation but the animation in this movie is heinous. i don't think i could see anyone, not even a 5 year old, enjoying this movie :/  i also hate how animation projects with actual effort put into it get paid dirt by studios but production companies can pump out all the cheap shit they want.
Bro I’m too drunk to understand anything I’m this video 🤪
Marmaduke is good Edit: the original one
the live action version of marmaduke is so much better. yeah its kinda cringey and awkward but its still good (imo)
my childhood was the 2010 marmaduke movie but what atrocity is this shit
I feel like both marmaduke (or however you spell it idc) and the pinocchio (think i spelled that wrong too) movie has so much meme potential. Espessially when pinocchio says "ive got the whole world to see" and sounds like hes saying "i got the whole wordussy"
I'm sharing the Word of God for the youth and children. Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. There's clip videos from a Children's bible app and I'm sharing scriptures and extra things to do for the Lord. God bless you. Jesus loves you. Matthew 18:3-5 And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me. Matthew 19 :14 Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” Matthew 4:17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” (We are in the end of times. Repent and be baptized. Turn to God.) Isaiah 45:22 Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other. Acts 2:38 Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Pray and fast) Philippians 4:6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Joel 2:12 “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.” (Turn to Jesus while there is still time.) John 14:6-7 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.” John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. John 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed Luke 18:20 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” (Follow the Two Greatest Commandments) Matthew 22:36-40 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” (These will NOT inherit the Kingdom of God) 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (The absolute truth of God's Word) Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Romans 10:17Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.  (Present Signs) Luke 21:20 When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 2 Timothy 3:1-5 But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. Matthew 24:4-5 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. Matthew 24:6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Luke 21:10 -11Then He said "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, then the end will come. 1 Timothy 4:1-2 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. (God's anger through weather) Psalms 18:7-12 The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him— the dark rain clouds of the sky. Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning. (Deny yourself to be a follower of Christ) Mark 8:34-35 Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. (Confess Christ) Matthew 10:32-33 “Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven. (God demonstrated His Own Love for us) Romans 5:8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Help others in need) Romans 12:13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.  Make disciples of ALL nations.Spread the gospel. Matthew 28:19-20 I suggest to download the audio Youversion Bible app & have it playing day & night when you sleep to learn & stay in tune of God's Word. Stay in prayer and repent.

No South America and Central America and Australia orjapanese movies to speak of .quantity tons,quality BAH HUMBUG!!!!!
these companies just make horrible kids movies just to make a quick buck. kids just watch it and eat it up because they're stupid fucking kids and the parents get a break from there shiteater kids because it shuts them. the worst of this is on tubi which half the movies on there are horribly animated not funny kids movies because its cheap. they went after marmaduke because he is a  somewhat recognizable character and there is a bit more of a chance parents put this movie on instead of ooger boogers farty day out. its just seen as a way for the studio to make money off of tired parents with a netflix subscription. it doesnt matter how good or even how long it is if its bright and colorful a kid will probably watch it.
I’m pretty sure Marmaduke is based off of this old live action one that came out in 2010, it had Emma Stone and Owen Wilson in it, it was a great movie far better than the new one
It’s not even so bad it’s good, it’s boringly awful!
The OG Marmaduke is so good as I remember it but I grew up on it lmao
Marmaduke is a flawless masterpeice
this cannot be a real movie
The end is basically a repeat of the rapping dog from the animated Titanic. I couldn't stop laughing from the sheer badness of this film, though it would have been harder to bear without commentary. Also I have an OC named Zeus, who is the opposite of that bad guy dog- up until the end where he goes berserk over a petty slight. That's 150% my son.
A few weeks ago, my mother told me that the girl she babysits saw this movie and loved it. I never heard of the movie and the premise sounded weird, but I was like "yeah, sure, maybe it's good"... some time later and everyone is talking about how shitty it is. Really proves the point that kids will watch everything, and companies that make this garbage knows that.
these movies are a test for a movie making ai
pete davidson deepfake voice
this movie was an absolute abomination and disgrace also the rapping was …. certainly a choice BUT! ur hair looks rly good danny 🫡
daniel
Wait so what about all the money the family owed from Marmaduke eating everything at the banquet?
the animation is like if someone watched scary godmother in june whilst on crack
that mom got me actin up
is this the "Hi, my name is charmander." guy?
Yeah. They are.     Idky, money laundering? That's a motive at least...
drew wasn't talking to us when he says hey guy, he's talking to this dog trainer and only him
I love marmaduke
the animation….. its giving headache
record breaking shark attacks along the east coast that diggity dang dog at it again!!!!!!!
Go to show how bad Pete d is so so ass
when marmaduke fake died i got goat story flashbacks
I remember the original marmaduke being great but I think that’s cause the dog could surf and I was 6
So... over all this movie is about beating the living shit out of a dog and putting it on the verge of death? got it.
Ok but Pinocchio's voice is kinda 💅
😢
Pls don’t cusse
this is the ugliest animation i have ever seen
This is so bad but the bulldog lifting up the center was SO funny for some reason
Not only does it have Pete Davidson it also has freaking JK Simmons and David koechner?! Damn
i fuck with the shirt danny
im really upset that pete davidson was a part of this
It feels like they are trying to aim their content at gen z but most wont even be able to buy Netflix
7:53 my guess is that since the trainer is a highly experienced dog trainer he most likely translates Marmaduke’s tone/pitch to English
This movie looks like it was made in 1996 on the CRAY supercomputer but the producers could only rent it from Kirtland Air Force Base for 8 minutes
The animation style reminds me of a cross between despicable me and hoodwinked
THE OG MARMADUKE WAS MY CHILDHOOD HOW DARE THEY RUIN IT
I’ve had my notifs on for a while now. Am I truly Greg?
Is it just me or does he look like the younger version of Airrack
Look deep bro. Better life choices. Become your own self. Stop being someone you’re not.
I think theyve run out of money. This movie will do fine for its target audience. Kids.
LMAOO. I was playing this on my TV and my dog freaked tf out when Danny went, “YOU STUPID FUCKING DOG!!“
theres a wayyy better marmaduke movie 2010 version is really good i recommend that one
2:07 that star is looking kibda sussy
theres apparently a live action marmaduke from 2010
Animal abuse simulator
the nerdy big nosed dad getting the mom w an ungodly thicc dump truck of a cake is the one redeeming quality of the movie
Marmaduke looks like someone made a parody of DreamWorks, I hate it
Danny! You messed up the express vpn link in the description
Why did they make the bullies black bruh
The bullies are the only black people in the movie
Why does he look younger every video. Sometimes I click on a new video and have to check if I didn’t click on an older one, what potion’s this man drinking?
Wasn't this already a live action movie why do we need an animated one😭😭
Entra  en esta cuenta de otro panorama m.s y luego me confirmas que te pareció por este chat
I never thought Danny would've ever wanted a dog in a movie to die until Marmaduke 💀💀
you need to try the new kung fu panda show on netflix. it’s absolutely atrocious
Yes.
welp at least we have, like, Stranger Things
Who else hates the trope where they make the main character like really well intentioned so all the stupid stuff they do is supposed to make them funny and likeable but you just end up annoyed by them
The real villain was Marmaduke all along
Don’t know what’s the agenda of Netflix.
i was eating while watching this... not anymore
Nah there has to be a fart fetish involved w this💀
stop looking away from me
how dare danny call zapped a bad movie ;-;
Marmaduke officially created Chernobyl
i think i lost about 10 years of my lifespan after watching danny describe a scene in which a dog shits in a trophy while doing an ahegao face
theory: they saw reaction and commentary youtubers commenting on bad movies, so they decided to make money by making bad movies so youtubers would react and then they could take ad money off the youtubers 0:
Only mentioning it because the animation is similar but I recommend the Willoughby's it's a kids film on Netflix it's about some neglected children trying to become orphans and I genuinely find the parents hilarious
This is kind of sad actually. It's hard to imagine this movie belongs to the service as the Sea Beast, which is a much better movie than this.
make a video about the movie wish dragon
THE QUESTION WE'VE ALL BEEN ASKING
1:54 I wouldn’t be surprised if Pete Davidson was forced into the role.
How did this movie get approved?
Yet another movie that’s just awful to look at
Mr. Gonzalez why did you have to do the sponsor ad from that angle
10:50 it’s because your dog can’t produce mushroom clouds of ass gas
The fact that my little siblings actually love this movie and watch it over and over and over again.
The scene where the dog farts and shits so much that it becomes shriveled like a raisin is so incredibly strange and gross that I cannot stop laughing. What the fuck is this movie
DID YOU KNOW Marmaduke (2022) Is Actually A Remake Of The Original Marmaduke (2010)
everyone watch the live action movie it's eons better
the 2d animation at the end looks 10x better than the rest of the movie
you think this is bad? go watch the fucking Maranda sings show on netflix. that shit scarred me
marmadukes fart is giving scary movie 1 energy
This movie looks like the cheap foreign knock-off of a good American movie.
Love how the credits are better animated than the entire movie
I got a Pete Davidson ad for manscaped on this video and he seemed far more alive in the ad about ball hair than this movie 5 Marmadukes out of 5
I was about to lose my shit if he would actually die, but nah
I died laughing while watching this entire video
this animation  looks like an upgraded version of Ratatoings animation.
Why is this the visually ugliest movie I've seen in years
The way this movie looks is making me sick
ComPete Davidson
the way this is animated genuinely makes me feel ill
OMG IM AT THE START OF THE VID BUT MY SCHOOL FORSED US TO WATCH IT AND HE LIKE FARTED INTO THE BEYOND
I like your shirt daniel gonzalez
Being a voice actor has always sounded really cool to me, but they don’t usually start on animation till after the voice work is over so I would just be terrified that it might turn out as disturbing as this.
theres a live action marmaduke that is accually good.
you should watch the other Marmaduke movie that was made in 2010 lmao i used to watch the movie so much when i was younger lmao
I was keeping it together until the random magical dog using a domain expansion technique 🐕 ✨️ 😂🤣
faaather when can i leeeave to be on my ooooooooooooown
PETE, my man..... what happened 😭😭😭😭😭
The dad has Danny's nose
This honestly feels like a fetish film, I mean, the proportions, the whole eating and farting business... It's just weird
omg it’s the greg pillows from that tik tok
The old irl marmaduke movie was better than this,,,
Continue watching at 14:36
Has anyone seen Sea Beast? It's so good!
Imagining someone going to a dog show and ending up on their hands and knees crying is a really funny visual
Grey hair?
the marmaduke mom is actually quite redeeming
"it is the worst movie you'll see this year" wrong I have no interest in seeing it
Some weird vore shit in this movie for sure
10:40 yeah actually my dog peed on my math homework i thought it was hilarious
The animals talking is really horrific especially when the cat tells Maramduke he's a champion and when Zeus says the trophy is his. I hate looking at them
That ending song is very reminiscent of the dog's rap from the titanic movie.
I love your videos but I feel like the thumbnail and some of the content are kinda you copying Scott cramers video of when he did “are they making bad shows on purpose” and did Netflix. I know a lot of people do it but it’s just surprising coming from you.
14:02 I love how Marmaduke is so depressed but then this cat says "just believe in yourself lol" and then he's just over it. The way they wrote him to say "yep" and how he says it is just baffling to me.
You are now Noah schnapps older brother, k?
Danny should watch Doogal, a 2006 gem with a whopping 4% on rotten tomatoes. It has a ton of celebrities (Jimmy Fallon, Jon Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Hader, Ian McKellan) yet it is a catastrophically bad movie
watch more barbie movies, but like the really old ones
No one's making you watch Netflix...whiner.
What's really sad is the famous dog trainer just beating dogs/punishing them for existing really tracks given Cesar Milan and other popular trainers.
How did I get a Pete Davidson manscaped commercial right after you shat on Pete's acting range
IM SO GLAD im not the only one who thinks it would be fucking hilarious if more movies just ended with the main character dying. people dont appreciate the HUMOR. final space did it well with literally (spoiler you could probably watch before reading)         ENDING WITH EVERYONE DYING AND THE UNIVERSE BEING DESTROYED. I just sat there in disbelief laughing
Pretty sure the Pinocchio movie was a foreign film that got shoehorned into an American release. Either way still pretty bad
The characters remind me of despicable me for some reason…
I mean sea beasts is good
I can’t believe Danny didn’t make a titanic reference to the ending song with the dog rapping
What you don’t know is that I’m still under Danny’s desk 🤫
This is what that line "remember that funny movie where the dog dies?" in Inside Out was talking about
Why does the new Pinocchio sound like Danny if he was born gay
Hi Danny
Dude that dog farts muster gas
all OF A SUDDEN all the sudden is not a phrase
the animation in this movie is like FoodFight tier garbage
Noooo as someone who watched the live action movie when i was younger this new movie made me cry
Love this
Cool
My sister had to watch this at school
why does it look like it came from the same studio as the knockoff up movie
slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I keep hearing the line from "Daria": "why don't they just put Marmaduke to sleep!?"
There’s a gold mine of low budget netflix animation danny could make a video on bobbleheads the movie,extinct,dog gone trouble, gnome alone and magic control agency some aren’t that terrible but there’s something odd about all of them the worst one was the mariah carey christmas but netflix took it off i think
Marmaduke (2010) aka the live action was one of my FAVVV GROWING UP!!! its genuinely amazing everyonw pls refresh your eyes with it!  the characters and cgi(?) definately hold up to the point where i thought he was real keke~~
J. K. Simmons as Zeus 😭😭
I just want a nice 2D animated movie please that’s all I ask
I love this movie reaction! Jesus so fuckin goofy ah
Yoooo Danny should react to the movie 16 wishes 😈
I remember i was on Netflix with my little sister and she wanted to watch Marmaduke. she got bored in the first 5 minutes of the movie. I'm glad i didn't have to sit through this lol
Magic was foreshadowed when the trainer used a magic fighting kick to beat the shit out of a dog.
so danny when do you plan on watching sequals like camp rock 2 :}
how tf was this movie in cinemas
notificate
i subscribed and turned on notifications am i Greg yet??
Yet here they are cancelling Mindhunter after two seasons. 😭Makes no sense to me.
Danny rocking the hoochie daddy shorts hell yeah
"And then they ignored all the other pages in the book about like how to make a movie" LOL SO SAVAGE. SO BITCHY. See, this is why I love Danny he's such a mean girl 🤣🤣
I watched that movie when it first came out ( Marmaduke) & omg bro it’s so terrible it’s funny ! Lmao I was waiting for Danny to talk about it . But Wsp Greg ❤️
Netflix knew you were going to react to this
There’s a live action version (2010) with Owen Wilson and George Lopez, THAT would be considered the pallet cleanser to whatever this monstrosity is
Dude. Go work out. You have 10 year old boy frame😔
I feel like this was a P.S.A about animal abuse/dog training tips
The newspaper comic Marmaduke's jokes are pretty much just "this dog is huge but is trying to sit in my lap!", what the fuck is this movie doing?
I can unfortunately confirm children have watched this movie
Hey Daniel you made a typo in the description, your sponsor link is messed up or maybe... its been "Danny Gonzalezand" the whole time...
What a horrible movie plot. Cartoons are supposed to have positive messaging for kids and adults who like to watch animated movies. The whole idea of “if your dog is not listening, physical violence will make them listen” is an absolute disgrace to all animated movies. Not surprised Pete did no advertising, he’s probably embarrassed by the movie and rightfully so. Great video though!
I know guy is gonna be oncelerified
Netflix Laundering money
nah cuz we releasin shit like this in the year of our lord Two Thousand and Twenty Two
i've just realised marmaduke is like a blatant copy of "my fair lady". Is no one else seeing it?
Really enjoying the new ad portion where Danny talks to us, his peni
Why is the dog trainer guy literally William Afton
It is pretty cool that Drew’s biggest fan is in the movie. Big plus
#4 on trending!
I think Marmaduke just sucked in his gut rather than farted all the food out, I feel like that's not the only conclusion to draw from that scenario
i literally had the live action one in the 2010s, that one was bad, but gave me some good moments with my dad. this one had nothing..
5:18 if Tom Holland watches your videos he's gonna be so offended by this
❤️❤️
Little kids don't care and new talent need projects to practice on to get better.  These aren't movies for people who are looking for something to watch.  These are movies for the little kids who aren't really paying attention anyway as Netflix just goes through a random selection.
Short Answer: Yes, they are looking for a profit so they create these cheap movies intentionally.  They have been reinforcing the idea of quantity over quality because most will still watch these awful movies and see them as a variety of things to watch while browsing through their platform. Over the recent years, people have noticed and it looks like they're trying to bring in some award-winning shows and movies meanwhile as they try to stay ahead of their other streaming competitors.
How is Netflix the same streaming service that released the masterpiece Arcane but also this?
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing ✝️
Danny: "Is Netflix Just making bad movies on purpose?" Also Danny: is in a netflix show
My kids refused to watch this lol
Funny thing is my 4 year old niece loves marmaduke lol
First Pixar and Disney made tall and slender characters, all looking elegant and satisfying to watch move. Great!  Then Illumination came with very slender characters. They walked kinda weird, their legs and arms bent in weird flexibility and they didn’t seem to have a lot of weight and muscle, but still passable at a certain point.  Now this.  I’m convinced someday we’ll have 2D slender characters in 3D movies. They’re so thin, they only have width and height but no depth.
You should review zombies 3 next
danny danny danny!!!!! i watched arthur and the invisibles for the first time in a decade and i think you should indulge perhaps
This makes me worried because Pete Davidson is going to be playing Joey Ramone in the netflix movie I Slept with Joey Ramone and netflix is the one making it so i really don't want them to mess it up because the Ramones are my favorite band
Check out Blank Kanvas podcast
I remember at school they were playing this movie at lunch…. and i walked in at the first dog show and i started throwing up it was disgusting and traumatizing to watch these badly made characters go through such horrible situations and i couldn’t handle it now i am forever scarred.
Ada Hazard
The pinochio movie looks like something Scott Cawthon would make idk I got Scott vibes
What I find hilarious is that this movie is somehow way worse than the live-action movie
this does not deserve to have the same name as the 2010 marmaduke
7:50 love how you can see his ear clip through the window when he barks 🤣😅
I was listening to an audiobook and forgot  to turn off the 2x playback speed, so I opened this video and just burst out laughing because Danny was talking faster than the speed of light.
I got a Pete Davidson manscaped commercial during this which I had never seen before... interesting
Nice job for being on the trending list
Danny is hitting his stride again. I laughed the whole way through this!
I’m sorry but did you not see Sea Beast?
Not y'all hating on the 2010 live action Marmaduke movie that was my favorite movie as a kid
How to be a villain  1:Be rich  2:Be British
i’m fairly sure this is based off an actual movie, about a dog called marmaduke who misbehaves. it’s actually a good movie, awful cgi, but i much prefer it over this mess
I think it's so people are more incentivized to steal it instead, and then they can sue for more than they would've gotten from a subscription or a ticket
Love the actual movie of marmaduke, grew up watching it
I can assure you that my 5 year old daughter has watched this several times per week since release.
Please see the paws of fury movie it looks TERRIBLE
alternative video title: Is Danny Gonzalez Just Making Bad Movies On Purpose
Netflix is not the producer.. they're the distributor. They buy dhitty movies, cus they're cheap, and then they can say;"we have 9078 movies subscribe" no one said they were all good.. they were cheap
We love a trending king 🔥
Hey guys. Believe in Jesus. He's coming soon
why does the guy kinda look like the fuckin onceler
MY TEACHER MADE ME WATCH MARMADUKE ON THE LAST WEEK OF SCHOOL
Just from the clips in this.. the screenplay itself is lacking... I don't want to discount the animation crew etc..
Why does the dad look like Shane Madej? Also Zues’s character design makes my skin crawl
I didn’t know that the phrase was actually “one _fell_ swoop” until I was like 20….
atleast that mom is bad
when has pete davidson ever been funny
greg, absolutely loved this video.
Not all the Danny's new vdos trending as soon as they're released-
i love the movie tbh
Okay so here is the thing. This animation film failed in one of the main rules of animation: APPEAL. Your characters must look appealing to the audience. There are guidelines to this rule that I cannot remember right now but just know that this movie failed at every single one  And it also failed most of the other rules as well.
My six year old god daughter watched this at my house over Memorial Day weekend and now I feel like I need to call her mom and apologize
12:31 $947.41 for emotional support 💀
When the YouTube video review is better than the actual movie 😂
Cool video and all, but who won the competition after the original winnner got disqualified?
When I first saw this I was like uhhh 😬 this is such a bad movie like wth then I was like I gonna give it a chance and when I’m like halfway the movie it keeps getting worse the art is disturbing
It sounds like pete davidson recorded his lines on his phone one afternoon and didn’t look back
THis was like your funniest video, idk what but fuck i was laughing so hard
W
Did everyone just forget about the original live action Marmaduke movie or did I imagine it
Is no one gonna comment on the hole that Danny just punched into his wall? 😭😂
I have the real live action on marmaduke they arent even the same thing NOT EVEN DAM CLOSE IT LOOKS LIKE A REBOOT
Your bream
this movie is some furry's kink
This shit actually made my laugh cuz it was so fckin retarded 🤣
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
They got rid of the office and criminal minds just to make room for movies like marmaduke
I think what they're trying to do is find the perfect balance of "So bad it's good" meme content. It's a lot easier to make 20 bad movies vs 1 good one, so they just inflate their numbers and hope one falls into the SBIG category.
2:34 tag yourself, i'm bouncing egg
I like how Danny looks so concerned in the thumbnail
You should review the live action marmaduke movie now
PETE DAVIDSON?!
cool shirt
i just noticed at 7:49 the dogs ear clips out of the window lol
the animation is so bad it’s insane 🫤 2002 cgi animation seems ok compared to this.
there is also a live action movie and it is much more enjoyable
Dang me and the rich British dude have so much in common  We both beat the shit out of dogs
That bill was from an American hospital
i like your shirt danny
NICE
this reminded me of pets united. except that movie at least so guy just randomly dies
Yaaayyy a movie review video, I love these
Danny could you react to the new movie called “Zombie 3” it makes no sense to me at all to me
we had to watch marmarduke on the last day of school- and it was a mess no one liked it (one kid cat-called the poodle)
the way the dog’s ears clip the curtains when he’s upstairs during the bbq, like holy shit that’s poor quality control and a complete lack of care.
my friend's kid loves the "farting doggy movie" and I definitely lost a few braincells watching it with her
This looks like those bad quality movies that just have different names from the real movie like the bee movie ripoff
It really appears to be a confirmed life cycle for old comic strips, storybooks, or cartoons to be adapted into surreal-looking live-action movies before they're made into (often on lower-budget) CGI animated movies or TV series. The Grinch, Stuart Little, Garfield, The Smurfs and then this.
its giving furry k*nk
He’s the dog whisperer of the century
as a dog training student i can confirm we do karate kick the dogs we train
12:08 You should be made fun of with that haircut
The animation seems too jagged and fast, almost like the animators were mostly used to fast scenes or something. I'm not really a fan of the design or movements of the characters, I bet it could look a lot better if they took some time to figure out natural movement instead of whatever the hell this is.
Danny im obsess with you
What one would you say is better, marmaduke 2010 or this marmaduke moive 2022?
I thought u were talking about the original marmaduke that shit was class
I also think when you stop making animation with adults in mind the animation becomes stupid because stuff for kids is just dumbed down to the point where I won’t let kids watch it.
I asked my kids if they wanted to watch it when it first came out & they changed it within the first ten minutes. The next time I asked if they wanted to watch it, they very abruptly, very emphatically said "NO!"  My 8yo says "mom, that movie is so terrible" 🤣
“Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha”
We have a place in Syracuse that makes teen sex comedies and I hate to say it. I don’t think teens watch it. Also marmaduke is older so it may really only resonate with older people
Marmadukes rap was giving the same energy as the detective dogs rap in that awful animated titanic movie
The animation reminds me of a Christian propaganda video.
#2 on trending Danny lets goo!!!
Bro u hot 1,5 mili in a day🎉
It's a ratio game. Netflix realized that due to binge and hype culture they can make cheap, badly written projects and still make multi millions as long as they release 2 things that are actually great every year or so. What? You think "Red Notice" is a boring nothing burger film that totally miss uses the talent of their 3 A-list celebraty leads? Well here's SQUID GAME! What? You think "Insatiable" is hot garbage? Here's another season of STRANGER THINGS! And that's what Netflix does all the way to the bank because everyone knows that the internet only has enough cognitive function to focus on ONE piece of good media at a time
i loved the live action marmaduke (apparently? i watched it when i was very young so i don’t know) and the first five minutes of the movie were insufferable already. the animation is horrible and the stylistic choices are almost worse than the animated addam’s family. and then the fart scene? even though i was just watching it with my parents i felt so humiliated. i didn’t even choose to watch the movie but i felt embarrassed like i had caused this. it almost brought me to tears. the whole thing with the shih-tzu (or maltese?) with literal powers was really weird and then zeus just hypnotizing everyone? i really liked zeus though, he was the only likable character and he was a villain. also if guy was from a better movie he’d probably qualify as a tumblr sexyman
This is an excellent example of what happens when average people (or even moderately rich people) are suddenly living life at a Kardashian-sized “fuck you money” level
isnt there a real life version?
The animation looks like it was made in 2005
The mom just don’t look right
What's this
bro WHAT are these comments 😭😭😭😭
As a dog trainer, this movie physically hurts me💀😭
Awful movies!
My grandfather's name is guy and he is in fact Drew's biggest fan because my name is Drew lol
The budget was obviously whatever change was sitting in an executives couch and a tube of Pringle’s
this movie was made as a tax write off
You wouldn't make a video about a Oscar-worthy movie, Danny. This video about a bad movie has 1,5M views. Now 1,5M people know about this bad  movie and might be curious to watch. So yes, they make bad movies on purpose because all publicity is good publicity, even when people watch it just to make fun of it
Not So Great Daney, nah jk you are great Dan Dan  ANYWAYS you do know that you used to be able to watch Standing Ovation for free until your video made it so popular that they now charge for that absolute shitshow  So I guess we're stuck in a loop now hm
Danny why do you look photoshopped in the Thumbnail?
I maybe chose the wrong video to watch on my lunch break 💀
I am so uncomfortable with the way the characters are shaped, it feels bad to look at
My younger siblings love this movie lmao
holy fuck it looks like a bootleg
The tiny dried spaghetti limbs they've decided to give so many of the human characters are... horrifying. Miserable. There's no artistic merit  in these designs, and the mom's disproportionally thick lower body is the worst thing I've seen in a while.
The kid I nanny wanted to watch this movie and the whole time I was trying not to cry
Dream's "Mask" music video was animated better than Marmaduke
i had an itch for danny so i came to gonzales channel to watch drew. :) great choice on my end.
I think they are trying to lower everyone's standards as far as possible.
To be fair it was made 12 years ago
did anyone see the jump cut at 5:20 when he says “it’s the law” his chair like, teleports. im on to you danny, i can’t believe youtube creators edit their videos this is sick
Danny looks like the dad 🫶🏻
Isn’t Marmaduke already a film? This must be a remake.
i thought this couldn’t be THAT bad because i loved the live action one when i was young but damn… if they’re even related or if plagiarism is another issue with this movie
This movie gave me a tingling feeling that only my uncle can give me. It was so refreshing to watch a beautiful work of art that this movie is after this horrible year so far for cinema. I truly think the only bright spots this year for cinema were this masterpiece and the amazing Morbius.     This movie has some of the quirkiest and goofy jokes i’ve ever heard that had me laghing and giggling all night long. Especially when Marmaduke farted the many times that he did I just couldn’t stop giggling. The animation was so high quality I completely under stand the 6 morbillion bit coin they spent on it.   I applaud Netflix and Pete davidson for making Marmaduke come to life from the screen. I kid you not I could smell the farts from the screen every time he farted and they were so good. I have rewatched this movie 689 time since it’s release and it was amazing every time. 100/10 must watch!
shit like this is why children growing up rn are all gonna be fucking braindead
Marmaduke is a MENACE / A bad Boy😈😡
Putting their deuces up When DUKES was right there 😂
5:06 bro beats his owners for fun💀🤚
NUMBER 4 ON TRENDING LETS GO GREG
I'm pretty sure pete Davidson owed someone
Danny hasn't even seen the worst yet
You know the movie is bad when Danny has grown more gray hairs.
It's pretty impressive how awful this film is because the Marmaduke comics are...fine. Like yeah maybe not great or anything, but like.....they're fine. Especially since Marmaduke is usually terrorizing the neighbor, from what I remember, not the family that owns him...
Woops accidentally added this to my baking playlist
How can I smell the dogs fart
bruh
Just stumbled across your channel, great content! really funny
The og Marmaduke movie was actually okay, the cartoon one makes garbage look appealing.
All I can pay attention to is how thiccc mommy is
Can someone clip Danny crawling on the floor like that lmao
18:30 the close-ups of the humans’ faces are genuinely terrifying what in the fresh hell
Pete Davidson sucks honestly he's the most overrated comedian
Damn, I didn't know the camerawork would get 18+ near the end of this video
For the Can Marmaduke speak question. I think Guy is just barking at him because if Marmaduke wanted to get his parents or anyones attention he would speak. How could anyone ignore a dog screaming in English
the 1.4 million dollars... was spent... on DOG FOOD ..... dog food ..............  WAIT AND THEN IT SAYS 49K FOR FOOD WHATTT
Oh myyy, everything about this movie was horrible😂 I have also had a bad experience with Netflix in the past
Danny need to try the new cherry blossom la croix. Legit taste like chocolate!
Danny there's a live action Marmaduke movie with an entirely different plot that's like some dog romance story that's about as cringey as this movie. Please look into it 😂
That artstyle, awful that plot, horrid the characters, abominations
True. I watched it for less than 5 minutes and immediately switched to something else.
at least the dog didn't step on the bee...
please review zombies 3 i watched it the day it came out and it's so bad omg XD
Why does the thumbnail not look like danny
This movie is just fetish porn, like they didn't even *try* to hide it
WHERE IS THE GRAAAASSSSSS
This is the stupidest but funniest video I’ve seen
It sounds like Pete Davidson is being held at gunpoint
Why does Danny have such good legs???
I am also Guy and Drew Gooden's greatest best most fan
The irl version of the movie is better
FaTHEr wheN caN I LeAve Too BeeeEeEeeeE oON. mYY OwOnNnnNnN
in a better world the credits rolled after marmaduke died
this is actually the story of kim k taking on the societal mantle of taking care of pete davison that ariana, even while trying her hardest, just couldn't handle
The sea beast wasn’t bad ?
The scene with the fuckin huge fart cloud was sorta disturbing for me not gonna lie, only because of the character designs.
You pretending to be Marmaduke was the best part of the movie.
netflix has been such a dissappintment lately. dear netflix- u dont know how to make kdramas, dont try. the teen rom coms are getting problematic. u shouldnt make low budget movies. not like the high budget ones are that great. uk what? just dont make stuff. let people make stuff and just get it on ur platform. pls.
Danny you have #1 Trending :D
The kids' animation industry is chock full of adult fart fetishists and they can't keep getting away with it
Ok whoa, actually!? That "POV: you're hearing about this video's sponsor from underneath Danny's desk where you were .... previously...um...yakno" angle ess really innovative (or at least I've personally never seen it employed before). Top shelf
Damn Danny #2 on trending
The fart gas is like viper’s ult, vipers nest tehe
Just watching this video made me lose brain cells.  Not because of Danny, but because of the fuckin movie
This seems fun when you’re high, otherwise it’s just ass
Between this and that one Titanic cartoon, what's up with bad animation's fixation on rapping dogs?
Not just movies their series are a pile of shit as well
This was so goofy
I can't believe it was made in 2022
It's so weird that this is a Netflix movie. It felt like those rip-off movies Danny reviewed in the past with the weird character designs
Pls I want a “daddy boy” shirt so bad why is this the first time I’m seeing it
If you wanna coach a winner for a million dollars Pick the the most difficult person to train and least likely to win
2:28 - Same.
The whole dog show scene made me uncomfortable…actually the whole movie made me uncomfortable…
i'm so glad you made a video on this "movie" because i watched it with my little brother and was actually mind boggled with how bad it was 💀 the moms proportions were the funniest in the whole thing
There's a live action version of Marmaduke which is actually really good, it came out a lot longer that this Marmaduke movie though
Wtf does Guy look like a stock Tumblr sexyman
i had to watch marmaduke in my class cause our teacher thought it would be good 😭
What's up Greg i hope you're all having a great dane
Netflix provide a large variety of content each of which appeals to a particular niche audiences. Hence, they will inevitably have movies that will seem bad to viewers outside of these niches.  Personally, I think Netflix has a lot of good movies, but it takes effort to find the content that is good for you.
You only gave it a -6 out of 10 because Pete Davidson dad died 👿
My man got gray hairs oh no😫
I like stylized animations but this is just an abomination.
i went on a road trip with my toddler nephews and we watched marmaduke probably five times. i wanted to die. why would they ever allow this movie past the brainstorming step, let alone actually releasing it???
Thank you for ruining my life by watching this movie.
Wait a minute, your whole video about Netflix is only one review about one silly dog movie? Lame 😑
I think these movies just exist because darn it the Nostalgia Critic has to keep going somehow! All he reviews now is stuff like this. I kept thinking about how much I prefer watching Danny than watching Doug during this video.
#1 on trending… such a king
For money?
Thanks drew gooden
My niece would love this movie… she’s four
They're making bad movies for the same reason they're making bad games you'll consume it
This movie is literally the definition of the word foul. Shit you could pull out a dictionary from 1995, look up the word foul, and still find this movie in that section.
This video makes me think you’ve never heard of the Marmaduke cartoon. Like everything you’ve said is very much like you think Netflix came up with the idea of Marmaduke.
As someone who actually shows dogs it’s so funny to me how movies always make dog shows seem so wild and pretentious 💀 Like.. real dog shows are just a bunch of people who love their dogs trotting them around in a circle for a minute and then giving them cookies for doing a good job. Sometimes you get a ribbon for having a cool dog. Sometimes dogs make little mistakes and everyone laughs it off bc dogs are just like that. It’s a fun time, definitely recommend.
ive seen a few of the Marmaduke comics and they didnt seem this bad so im not sure what went wrong
Honestly it’s hard to tell if big companies like Netflix is making bad movies on purpose or if they’re that ignorant. It’s legit hard to tell.
I watched a different one and it’s way better
To be fair that's what that famous dog trainer/ whisperer Caesar does. He abuses the dogs into obeying him and fearing humans.
It says the director is a visual effects guy who worked on a James Cameron movie. That cannot be right
No one talking about the fact that the dogs have eyebrows
the ads i got during this video were weirdly on theme. like i got a manscaped ad with pete davidson then i got two swiffer pet ads
Danny, they just want to get your Attention, of course
Great vid, just commenting to boost your analytics
5:46 did he just do a fucking debby ryan
Pixar with moms: WE NEED THA BIG BOOTY
I’d like everyone to know my only exposure from this movie before is seeing a video called “Marmaduke 2022 - Marmaduke belches after eating a whole buffet [Belching, Gas]” in my recommended feed.   It had 1.9k views. Why was it recommended to me. I was so shocked and laughing I took a screenshot and then asked YouTube to never recommend me that ever again.
I am convinced that this was someone's fetish thing disguised as a children's movie for some god awful reason and that's why there's so much farting and inflation
I got my phone taken up and came back to a new video from Danny. All is well again
#1 on trending?!?!?!?
“My private information and ip address is leaked on the Internet, damn that Marmaduke!”
The cartoon one looks bad, but who knows about the live action Marmaduke. That movie was pretty good in my opinion
why is the animation so damn bad
A 0%?!?!?
Heyy, #1 on trending, nice job Danny!!
Danny, did you break your wall?
It is based off a 2000s movie
Netflix refused Mr Beast does the new Squid Game series. Probably will be not good.
That mom Is a Pixar mom
4:52 did you call me?
#1 on trending good shit Danny sheesh even above YouTube’s holy fathers dude perfect lmao
Homeslice, your #1 trending
this animation weirdly reminds me of those Jehovah's Witness cartoons for little kids i dont know why
At least 1 kid has seen this movie LMAO my 7 year old niece just told me about it
One day my class was voting to watch a movie and somebody picked Marmaduke because they didn't know what to choose and the hadn't watch it before, but we watched home instead.
This unironically looks like it was made in 2002
For some reason YouTube is saying I watched this full video. NO I DIDINT YOUTUBE.
Blatent Scooby Doo rip off lol

Netflix is making movies for Netflix and chill not to actually watch
i feel so terrible for the animators, dude. not just for netflix downsizing the animation department, but them having to make do and turn out shit like this. they must feel terrible about this work, and it probably wasn't even their choice to make. there's nothing i hate more than working with bad designs and bad prompts and being able to do nothing about it, and im positive these animators feel the same. i just hope that they can get hired at better studios because of the name, and i hope that they can at least feel a little proud of their work. 100%!
Obama hate America. Since they joined Netflix, movies started have strange effect on viewers. The suicidal rate among young viewers increased.
Seeing Netflix closing down their animation department, and then seeing them put out stuff like Marmaduke, a Big Mouth spinoff, and a second Boss Baby TV show just comes to show how incompetent and apathetic they seem to be around animation nowadays. I understand they do have the occasional hidden gems here and there (The House, The Cuphead Show!, and The Sea Beast lead this year's animation catalogue), but aside from that, nothing doesn't seem right at all
Ironically, I found this movie interesting... Only because of Danny overview/reaction to it  Danny add spices that the movie severely lack of
definition of 💀
Pete Davidson is  sooooo wrong for this part. Just because someone is great at a couple styles of humor doesn’t mean they’re gonna be Jack of all trades. And I agree the writers clearly don’t know how to write a story for kids
Father, when can I leave to be on my ownnnn 😩
It is not a great movie
i love how this video is #1 on trending like youtube is trying to say "yes, netflix bad, so come watch us. we got liza on demand". keep up the good work danny
I'm so sick of Hollywood giving us this recycled garbage that's meant to give them a quick buck. These are *billion dollar* studios, where are all of the masterfully written films that actually _add_ something to our culture??
I can’t breathe over Danny trying to convince us he doesn’t find Zeus the dog hot 💀💀
In the thumbnail you look like Mr moon knight
Whoever is reading my comment at this time, We are all strangers to each other, yet I pray to God, That if there is any tension going on in your life, You should always be happy..🔥 🔥
Congrats on being #1 on trending!
I think they’re making bad movies bc they know that people will watch it anyway. Bad=funny and interesting
Congrats on #1 trending
Bad art is purposefully mad to dumb down society.
The fart scene actually made me so nauseous that I was afraid I was going to throw up all over my sofa
I'd like to think that magic isn't a normal thing in this movie universe and that just those few dogs are able to perform it
THE GAMING SIMP
Now you must review the live action Marmaduke with Owen Wilson 😂
I had a friend who thought the song waterloo from abba was actually marmaduke, cause there is a Marmaduke movie from 2010
It makes me smile thinking about Drew watching this and giggling.
Number 2 on trending? Hot damn. Almost doing better than Netflix itself at this point, thanks to their history of pushing awful content...
Nice Whiplash shoutout, very niiiiiiiiiice

DID YOU EDIT IN A PUNCH HOLE? How? What did you use to edit that in?🧐
Hardly any gud movies these days
Number 1 on trending baby!!!!
SCOOBY DOODOO WAS RIGHT THERE!
Honestly it would have been better if Marmaduke just fucking died like you mentioned
Marmaduke is a stinky dog and the this shitzu dog joke is hilarious but yorkiepoo and cockapoo is right in front of you bro
Why does the animation for Marmaduke remind me of that kungfu panda knock off that I forgot the name of
Did anyone else get a Pete Davidson manscape ad before this video? Cringe
Hey! #1 on trending Danny!!! Good job dude! I am surprised that the #1 trending video is about Danny talking about how bad a movie is. Nothin wrong with it tho!
ok well the 3 and 5 year olds i babysit love marmaduke so clearly you don’t know what your talking about
greggo my eggo
At this point these bad movies are just funny cus it needs help- like nobody is convincing me the writers were not high or drunk while writing the script
these movies are all made by AI they just need semi human voices and a quick grammar check read before being pumped out, same with their live action movies. can't tell me that new Chris Hemsworth crap wasn't written by a machine
damn danny.... them legs are TONED!
clearly marmaduke is british thats why they understand each other
19:24 How the fuck is this the best animation that was used in the movie? This 2d isn't that bad while all the 3d is fucking horrendous
its marmadukin time
I turned on notifications. I am Greg now
#1 on trending rn, keep it goin danny :)
my kid asked me to watch this with him and i was so excited cause i love pete and i shut it off at the grill explosion
They put their deuces up? ✌🏻 lol
my neices and nephews thought this was the funniest movie to ever exist...
They make bad movies and shows because they get rid of the good ones mostly the shows.
marmapoop
2D is not inherently better than 3D but with a lot of 3d movies, I notice the 2d design--which is typically cool--gets lost in translation or abandoned entirely for uncanny stuff like this. I wonder what the 2d tests (if there were any) and the sketches/pre-production looked like for this movie  EDIT: Ok so the end credits seem to imply there WAS some cool 2d somewhere in the process. I know Kung Fu Panda wasn't the 1st to do it, but I feel like the trend took off after KFP1's interwoven 2d scenes and end credits. But what movies like this miss is that the rest of the animation also should be the same quality. Not blaming animators; in things like this, it's budget, ambition or lack of heart from higher ups that tank production.
Just listening to the few first words of Marmaduke made me turn it off
I cannot finish this video the animation and character designs are so unbelievably unpleasant
guy can understand the dog because the dog barks in an english accent
This is the kind of film the parents would put on to distract their kid for an hour or two
Holy sh*t #1 on trending?! Great job!
Ur trending no.1
So is no one going to mention how that "Guy" character is yet another animated version of Danny?
Well Marmaduke was made so the license could be kept
We could’ve gotten another season of Glitch Techs or something much better instead of this film that ALMOST makes the CGI Addams Family films look bearable in comparison.
Wait....did i miss something? Who won the competition?
they are making shite films as your generation demands woke shite
I am wondering if you can just pay someone for their vocal rights versus having them actually show up and do it.
#2 ON TRENDING
I don’t know why but I found the gas bomb scene immensely funny😂
This movie feels like a univeristy project made in the firsts years. Awesome for a newbie, but you're telling me NETFLIX DID THIS? It sounds like it was recorded on cellphones
The trainer is Danny with glasses
Danny’s hair is a paid actor. Just a theory.
6 year olds wacthing this are gonna turn dark
!])
At 6:01 that's fucking stock image clouds  and animated lightning holy shit Netflix you have money for good images that aren't that.
Ayy
ya buddie you do a great job and i bet you are a google kid too ,wait untill you have kids when you actually become an adult and then you can redo your rant lol to funny
I was born in 2001 in another planet & let’s just say I don’t claim this as an international animation horror. This is too far to call cringe ! Netflix should just name this disaster “Every Red Flag” in a toxic relationship
This just in: Marmaduke is a secret nazi invention that was tested in a dog show
Where is the pinned comment that's why  I watch these videos
Daddy gongzolez
Would putting a question mark in the title of the video make it do worse statistically?
I think Marmaduke is actually a really funny movie, or at least I remember it being funny. But I was like 12 when I first saw it. Owen Wilson was a good doggy.
I HAD TO WATCH THIS IN SCHOOL
You know I did like the realistic Marmaduke movie came out like a long time ago I think it was around 2005 I don't know but this Netflix Marmaduke sucks the limbs are too scandily they don't look like they can walk and they look just ugly the Marmaduke that's on Netflix should be deleted in I don't know the sound of light have a good day
Marmaduke should have just became a God
G.R.E.G. - Group of Really Evolved Guys
I assume this film was made to meet some kind of contractual obligation
This is like a dog version of garfield but without any of the charm of the original
Ew the animation is so ugly
Yo #1 on trending good job
great video Drew!
Ratatoing was better. :)
Big props on getting #1 on trending
realisticly this dog woulda been put down after the birthday party thing
6:13 missed opportunity to say putting their Dukes up, Marmadukes that is-ok I’m done
I thought this was one of those straight to dvd movies from 2007 lmao
That is true
The characters look like something out of a early 2000 Barbie movie
That is true
I imagine Marmaduke can understand humans talking, so it's reasonable to assume the trainer is just speaking english to Marmaduke and since he's a dog trainer, he can understand dogs barking
I’ve looked for it on Netflix but it looks like it was taken down..? :(
Wait when did we loose the “what's up Greg I hope you're having a grate day welcome back to_____” this feels like the end song all over again O-O

GOT AN AD WITH PETE DAVIDSON IN IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
My little sister watched this movie the other day and I thought it was from the early 2000’s It looked that awful.
The marmaduke comics had some LW bangers tho
No one’s going to mention the wall punch? Lol
The character design is beyond upsetting to look at.
Just because you think it is terrible doesn’t mean everyone feels the same. I bet you can name a ton of Netflix bangers too.  This means that Netflix has content that applies to every demographic.
Sheeesh #1 on trending
6:21 i got a dog sitting ad after this 💀
Hole in the wall looked pretty real ngl.
The fact that this is on Netflix feels SO disrespectful. As an animation fan, I hear about animated shows, GOOD animation shows, may I add, get cancelled all the time. What the fuck is that character design? That robotic ass animation? Even the underwhelming voice acting, HOW IS THAT ON NETFLIX??? Is the bar in hell as long as there's a single celebrity?
Umm...when Marmaduke ate all the food...there was chocolate in there. That dog's gonna die
arent you a little old to be watching childrens movies anyway?
Not-so-Great-Danny :(
My sister loves Marmaduke
Netflix is a total rip off of bad movies and continues to decline from the leadership, good for customers position they once held. Today it's still 1970 and 80's clunkers and the same movies they had on for 30 years. Not worth anything like the subscription  that was worth it years ago.
good god, that might be the ugliest professionally produced animated film I have ever seen.
OMG #1 ON TRENDING THAT FAST
I didn’t realize how bad this movie was until this video lol because It’s the only thing that will get my little brother to calm down and relax
congrats on #1 trending
To be fair, I don’t think kids are critically examining these shit cartoons.
original marmaduke w owen wilson will never be outdone :/
I honestly thought that the pillows spelt grey
Just saying there was an original marmaduke film made in like the 90s and it was way better
Danny barking is going to end up in out of context compilations.
Bro why is the moms back broken from being so thick Jesus Christ 😭
They're so inconsistent lol.
money laundering
good
There's bad animation and then there's stuff like this that is actively harmful for children to watch
Danny, I hope your reading a script on the other screen n not just looking at the recording of yourself on the other screen... are you?
This is such a stupid fucking movie. Even the few clips that I saw made me angry. It’s so stupid. The voice acting is awful. The visuals are awful. It’s so fucking horrible!!!
#1 on trending!!’n
🤣
I started laughing when Danny started in on the dog fart scene and I haven't stopped since.
Safe to say the best part of the movie is when the dog fucking died
The quality of CG animation is regressing back to Ratatoing, Ap Bokto level. This and that Kevin Hart NFT show on Roku makes me regret studying animation.
I agree, that is not a pretty dog.
It’s the fact my momma had me n my siblings sit down n watch this with her😭😭
Danny... Why did you make me watch it? I was so excited about the new vid... Why must you torture me...
Netflix after cancelling great show but releasing shit like this: 🥰🥰🤣😂🤣😄😻
I’d like to see Danny review the live action version after this
The second this video ended a Manscaped ad with Pete Davidson came up
i can’t believe drew just barked at me
this is why disney plus is da wae...netflix only has a select few shows that are average at best
It’s not the end of the year yet, we still have the time for a worse movie
I don't remember any of this being in the comic...
Danny is currently number 1 on trending 😈😈
why does the dogs owners kid kinda look like danny 😭
The funniest thing is when Danny mentions Pete's emotional range, which I'm not disagreeing with, but also Pete has BPD, which is characterised by a wild emotional range and all emotions are on a tonne of blow
wow so that trainer is just Cesar Millan
Gregg
Why does the evil dog look like Kim Kardashian with her long platinum blonde hair lol
Also what is this?? they were l like, yeah let's make a big dog, and make him very poorly educated and managed, and then let's make  people torture him. so everything will be more fun. I mean.... What the fuck is this.
Netflix is making bad movies because their out of gas
Danny on the floor is sending me ☠️
I hate to say it but the ending song sounds like it was written by Danny
I'm convinced this only got onto Netflix as a favour because somebody is related to a higher up.
my dog's name is zeus and i do NOT approve of his name being appropriated for this trash fire
This looks cheap for animation if it was made in 2000 -
9:50 I laughed inexplicably hard at this
The name if the movie should've been suicidal dog
Noodle arms
Netflix has always been garbage and they keep raising their prices while they compete with other streaming services that offer way more. Their budget is obviously dwindling.
the mom’s design literally like disgusts me visually LOL
Bruh I think they were like, okey, we have ST, so we are just giving up.
Why didn't they just put the old irl marmaduke film on there
Well this just proves netflix is the new "straight to VHS"
this is so fucked up you should look into live action Marmaduke
jesus the legs.. they look like spiders
But this was already a movie, they made a live action one in 2010..
Maybe this movie was made at the start of Pete Davidson's career
*#1 on trending!? congrats danny!*

Animal Abuse: The Movie! Starring Pete Davidson!
Dude... Pete Davidson is not funny. Like, at all.  His "jokes" consist of sex with women and diddling babies. 🤮🤮🤮
This is currently #1 on trending as I'm watching this  good job
The wokeness is busy destroying Netflix, Lets hope......so.
In the last part for the sponsorship , the angle that Danny uses is just straight up every thirst trap tiktok angle
Netflix really canceled a dragon fantasy series based off a book series for things like this.
I’m dying from the sarcasm 🤣
Danny: "The dog trainer actually isn't the villain!" Danny 2 seconds later: "So the dog trainer beats the daylights out of Marmaduke and then tortures him"
It surprises me this was made tbh, the movie is just *so bad,* was there really *no one* out of all those people that worked on this that said this is just awful??
New favourite film I love marmaduke
my little sister love the movie XwX
The ad read felt a little... spicy
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
Ah #1 on trending. Congratulations Danny 😊😊😊😊
That movie, actually, was a life action movie first, and I loved it as a kid. And they basically only took the name and the race of the dog, nothing else is the same as the original  (The original is loads better btw and no, I do not take criticism on that because dog movies like that were my whole childhood) Netflix basically just steals movies or takes franchises, and makes bad series or movies off em. I even saw the winx series they made and it was horrid.
For Netflix and similar streaming services, it's better to have tons of garbage content available rather than fewer select quality pieces. A huge selection looks better on paper and they know that people generally just keep Netflix on in the background while doing something else.
Pete davidson was in that!?! I watched a review of that movie awhile back and never would have guessed. 😂
if you want another, even more insane fucked up dog movie, check out Bingo (1991). you will not be disappointed.
Pin me if you love your fans
Sooo soooo true I don't have nothing to watch on Netflix
Children love this movie. I can't understand why but, at least here in Brazil, children are hypnotized by bad movies like this and actually talk about these movies.
Marmaduke is already a character from a live action movie made in the 2010s, I think they tried "reviving" the franchise for more profit?
Hi
Number 1 on trending lets goooo!!!!
Oh so Zeus’ evil plan was to convince Marmaduke to eat food. Uh oh
*Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bombed* That dang dog!!
Brad Anderson (Marmaduke's creator) died in 2015 but even if he was alive and completely dementia ridden I think he would hate this movie
17:23 Danny looks like he's in so much pain while pretending to be a dog. I love it.
I thought your pillows said "Peg". I was extremely confused and worried for you
Not a fan of the mardussy mouth animation
Missed you Danny!!! :)
I don't think Marmaduke is from Netflix, just because I've seen the movie in the cinema
One time I left a bowl of gram crackers out on the counter in the middle of making a cheesecake and my cat took a shit in it. Tiny bowl, two cups of gram, five clean litter boxes, he chose the bowl. That was a little bit funny not gonna lie.
# 1 ON TRENDING BABY LETS GOOOOOOO
I went to the zoo and was excited to see all the animals, but they only had one small dog. It was a shih tzu.
I have a new proposal for bad movie night with my friends.
i really really like the like action maramduke from like ten years ago it was my FAVORITE MOVIE but this puts the name to shame …. SHAME .
Oh my gosh the audio, this sounds like a fan redub
Gonzalez ? like Speedy Gonzales ?
I grew up in a really rural area and we didn't have high speed internet until I was about 13. What I always looked forward to other than watching cable TV was on Sunday, which was when the in color funny papers came. I remember reading Marmaduke and other comic strips and it's what inspired me to be an artist. Brad Anderson died in 2015 and I think even if he was alive and completely senile he would still hate this movie.
I think you should react to “gnomeo and Juliet” I started watching it last night and was like this is perfect Danny content   (Edit also good job for getting #1 on trending
The ad I went through to watch this video made me borderline s**cidal.
Somehow Netflix figured out how to film a cartoon using the same shitty camera they use to film everything else.
I actually witnessed my younger brother ( he is a young child) watching this movie. I saw some of the scenes in the movie and asked him why he was watching it.  This movie is horrible and I’m kinda surprised you ended up talking about it lol.
My favorite part was when he backed the dad into a corner and said “It’s marmin’ time”
There was a Marmaduke live-action movie back in 2010, and it was far better than this. It wasn't GOOD, just not this terrible.
did you know all us british people can understand all dogs
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
To answer your question: yes, they are making a bad movie on purpose. Movies like this are money laundering schemes to get profits from other movies by the tax man. They inflate the budget using creative accounting then write off the imaginary loss so they don't pay taxes on it.
Hey big Danny Boi, pin this comment if you're not not sure about not being certain of your actual birthday. Who knows! Could your parents have lied to you??
Thank you Pete.
4:38 Reindeer paws and dog hands
Hi Danny sorry I can’t watch this whole video cuz the movie is so ass
I'm pretty sure I've seen Pete Davidson in a YouTube ad and he sounded a lot more interested in it than in this movie lol
Father when can I leave to be on my ownnn I’ve got the whole worldussy 💅💅💅💅
Greatest movie ever forget avatar
Imo the worst bit of this movie was having to hear Kim K moan in the background of every scene Pete was in
Just an odd note, but it sounds like they mastered the vocal audio for the movie on an old cell phone. All of the voices have a slightly compressed, robotic sound to them.
We want to know what your dog thinks about the movie though, maybe it's a nice movie for them? smh
i find the funeral fakeout in a kids show a tad tasteless
Is it just me that thinks Danny’s pic in the thumbnail makes him look older or more mature? Maybe it’s so he doesn’t look like a 22 year old anymore, sincerely, Greg
all the comments are so long
#1 on trending!!! Go danny!! Absolutely killing it!!! Sometimes I catch myself singing “this video is over now” so catchy its constantly stuck in my head!!
drew come get your guy, he’s beating up a dog
he gave him that dont mess with the zohan foot slap lol
Marmaduke, the 2010 version, was good. This.. This is shit.
Danny in The thumbnail is literally the "😐" emoji 😭😭😭
it still baffles me that danny uses instrumental from house of say 😭😭still makes my day every time
you dancing to that rap at the end had my dying 😂
This definitely feels like someone blackmailed Pete Davidson into their tax fraud film.
Hey number 1 on trending
the live action marmaduke wss (and still is) one of my favourite movies of all time, this one is...not.
Ratatoing has some real tough competition now
*Talking dogs* Danny: I didn't know there was any magic in this movie
Theres this 2010 comdey movie about s dog named marmaduke but its a real life adaption and THAT is based on a comic i think? Can’t remember if its a parallel to this movie tho
Their movies are terrible. Thanks k you for remarking. I hope they go bankrupt
this is the first time i've ever heard pete davidson's voice. for some reason i thought he'd sound like steve-o not like just some guy.
terrified to press play on this because the thumbnail pic made me think of mpreg scooby
i wanna puke
This movie is so boring I can barely watch this video
the dad looks like Danny
Why does this look like it was made in 2003
Are you making shitty clickbait thumbnails on purpose?
I had to watch the dog movie one, my little brother picked it and He says, “never mind I dont wanna watch this daddy” my dads like: “no”
why do they care about the damn dog so much he was nothing but trouble
WILLIAM AFTON 😰
This is solid 1994-2002 sorta animition change my mind
HEY THAT MOVIE KS GOOD ,
19:33 I GOTTA EAT (stolen line from another garbage movie with some green guy)
Yesss! I saw this movie and I was like please tell me he has to react to it. It’s so bad it’s funny
My guy hit #1 on trending
As a hobbyist animator I can’t imagine the pure torture animating this movie, tbh after this Netflix should die.
Engagement trumps quality for these companies. As long as people are talking about it, people will watch it out of curiosity about how bad it could be, if nothing else. Bad movies are easier to make than good movies, and can be produced faster, which makes up for fewer people watching. So yes indeed, Danny Boy: Netflix is making bad movies on purpose.
3:25   ummmm.... the dad looks just like YOU !!!
Lulz.
I can’t tell if the animation is good or bad it’s both and neither all at the same time
Just remember the Netflix took off Coraline and replaced the "space" it took up with this
i remember the live action marmaduke i really liked it as a kid. wasnt great but beter then this
The original Marmaduke is so much better TwT my childhood is ruined now TwT
me: *half way through the video* my dad with my sister: “oh marmaduqe, what’s that?” me: *runs out of my room* “NO PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THAT-“  based on true events 😭
the original marmaduke slaps 💪🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
I have to admit the animation in the end credits of the movie looked better than the actual movie itself or at least more visually appealing
Is Netflix just making bad movies on porpoise?
petition for danny to make more ad reels from obscure places like under the table, behind the sofa, from inside the cupboard bcuz that was funny asl
*fart*
Yo I’m a great entertainer as well with great energy I do hilarious entertaining reactions feel free to check me out!
Just watch top gun Maverick instead
yes
Nowadays "original" doesn't mean good. these streaming platforms our creating their own content half the time rushing it out. original is not what it used to be.
Dog movie for people with fart fetish
the rich british guy looks like william afton
Yes yes they r with a huge side of propaganda
New Danny lore just dropped: he was born on earth 😍
Congrats for #1 on trending
Yoooo #1 on trending fuck yea dude
One thing Netflix did get right with this is that dogs do in fact fart vast quantities of mustard gas. WW1 troops would feed dogs excessively and point them at the enemy lines. Several battles were won this way.
I just realized why does marmaduke have autotune?
danny: Guy isn't so bad, he's just a little greedy but he's ok Guy, 5 seconds later: *beating a dog*
there’s a live action of this movie that’s from like 2010 and i actually really enjoyed it as a child there were some parts that were funny bad but still 100% better than this.
8 on trending good boy!
Marmaduke is directed by the same director as the awful superhero movie of 1997: Spawn.
Some parts of this seem like a meat canyon Scetch
That's  y i don't  have  netflix at  all  they  suck  😅😅😅how  many  times  can  u say pet davison😆
"The animation doesn't look so...oh what the shit"
5:19 how did his chair just teleport

wait holy shit I can smell the fart from here?
forget netflix, what about youtube? they're doing everything they can to make youtube worse
No Danny, I have decided to live under your desk and  that's what I have decided.
I've watched that movie 1 month ago  it hurt me to watch it
I watched this and stop in the middle BECAUSE its that BAD
i want that dog at my wedding.

Ep HOBE YT
I want to know how Danny’s hair defies gravity like that. My flat long hair needs to know
There's a different better Marmaduke
Yooo danny is number one on trending 😎😎
I'm so happy to see, Danny hasn't cut his hair yet. I know it's going to happen and the cloudy mystery of fluff his hair is right now will be replaced.
7 minutes into the video and I’m still laughing that Pete Davidson got this role LOL
I think Pete Davidson might have drawn and wrote the movie too.
ok but danny is glowing here✨
I suggest you take a look at “Titanic 666” if you want a movie to trash on
Even as a kid, I remember just hating movies where the whole joke was "horrible untrained dog causes endless misery." It's so irritating and they always play it like the dad or parents are the bad guys for getting fed up with being injured and having their property destroyed, instead of a single person training the dog.
hey heads up i’m getting a page not found when i click on your express vpn link in bio. i always try to click on sponsored links for creators i like to boost their engagement
The face in the thumbnail 💀
My siblings keep watching this over and over, their probably the only ones
You should make your own bad animated movie
6:11 "so they start like backing up and putting their deuces up"  What a waste of an opportunity for a Danny joke.   Coulda said "So they started backing up and putting their Dukes up....their....their Marma-Dukes"
Can I just say. I have feelings about being read an ad while under Danny's desk.
More like Great Dany Gonzalez, amirite?
And yall will keep giving them money. Wonder why they do it?
Danny’s number One
I seriously thought this was made in 2004 to 2007.
im sure pete davidson might have been funny in 1996.
Ausitm
Damn man made it #1 on trending with a normal ass vid
Omg I'm so glad I'm not the only one . My 4 yr old LOVED this movie amd everytime I put on Netflix & she sees the thumbnail for Marmaduke she begs me to put it on. We won't be watching it for the rest of eternity if i have anything to say about it lol it was actual, real life torture
the kids i babysit made me watch marmaduke its their favorite movie
I'm so so sorry to say but yes. Kids watch this movie. And I was there to see it.. I'm not okay anymore.
the writers of this movie need medicine.
Pyro would love this movie, might have to mention it on stream!
i watched this on the last day of school
From now on, always talk to me like im under your desk
Honestly Im surprised Pete didn't nail this role. I feel like he couldve just gotten really high and then just went completely over the top with it
I hate everything about this 1. The misleading and clickbaiting title. You can't blame the whole Netflix for a movie you don't like!  2. Looks like someone has never seen Tom and Jerry! It's just a cartoon. It might not be the best thing ever, but only because he doesn't understand cartoons, doesn't mean it's bad! It's obvious how he doesn't get it. And the obnoxious way he's trying to make a point... It's just disgusting. 3. The fact that this f* video made it no.1 on trending! Why? How? WTF is wrong with people...
Nice vid
I literally saw marmaduke on Netflix and I watched the clip it shows and just didn’t watch it because of how bad it looked
first time clicking a random vid from one of the dudes im subbed to and it's #1 on trending.
why is the animation so... bad...
HOLY SHIT THIS IS #1 ON TRENDING GOOD JOB DREW!!!
The shimmery dog kinda looks like Jeffree Star
I miss the 2010 marmaduke
The actual movie Marmaduke is good but this this is crap

There is no way that anyone who worked on this movie was proud of their work. It looks like a straight to dvd movie from 2006
why does Marmaduke's ending song remind me of the beat boxing dog from titanic: the legend goes on??
Oh the irony that Farzar comes out the day after this is uploaded; it's horrendously unfunny and without any charm whatsoever.
I feel like netflix makes bad movies so their good movies are recieved better
It almost looks like Netflix stopped caring about their customers a while ago and started focusing 100% on profit!
"AW FUCK HES ALIVE"
I think the main problem with this movie is that you can’t replace Owen Wilson
Good job getting #1 on trending Danny daddy
Well they accepted Cuties, after that - we gotta expect them to be doing bad movies and shows on purpose
Marmaduke the original is such a good film I'm so upset by this
My younger siblings were watching this movie a few nights ago and I remember looking up multiple times and thinking they were watching completely different movies. I am so confused still what this movie is about
Wow Danny number 1 on trending
OMG Danny Marmaduke it's just a f* cartoon! What do you expect? ****
There actually was a movie called maramaduke that wasnt cartoon that came out ages ago that I watched as a kid. This movie is clearly based on it but just did a terrible job
maybe they are trying to set the bar low so that amazon can be competitive ? :)
Hello, I am Pete Davidsons Supervisor and I can confirm that he is a dog.
Pixar mum = pears
marmaduke is an old comic strip about a great dane that most cartoonists at the time hated. not surprised the movie based on it sucked as well tbh
The only thing that makes this funny. Is you
Yo #1 trending let's go Danny
He actually made the Greg pillows he was talking about in his live I can’t wait to see the video where he’s making them hahah
oh god i remember watching the live action version when i was a kid, i'd love to see danny's reaction to it
3:22 he fucking exploded
Marmaduke always had that monotone boring voice. It's not Pete Davidson's fault, they definetely cast him on purpose.
8:05 as an expert on the dog language that was very offensive to the greek shepherds
Its been multiple videos without the ending song what happened
I wonder if Danny would ever do a video on the live action Marmaduke movie with George Lopez as the voice of some cat
lol, when did this even came out?
This is literally just the kids book Walter the Farting Dog lmao
Danny looks so different in the thumbnail holy shit
YES HE POSTED
i really thought you fucked your wall when you punched it
3:21 literally spat on my screen wtf was that that was so unexpected lol
AWW NOOO I WANTED THE SHITTY EVIL SATAN SPAWN SCAT FETISH DOG TO DIE
Ah yes, the three body types of the world: Long, Round, and Mom.
A rare occasion where the live-action movie is better than the cartoon. EVEN THO THE LIVE ACTION WAS TERRIBLE TO
the mom's dumptruck makes me incredibly uncomfortable
Executives are realizing that making enough low-budget movies offers a chance that one of them can be swept up in Meme culture, which is a very powerful and volatile culture nowadays, and thrive off of the avid attention of the media. Movies unfortunately aren’t the only area in the entertainment industry that’ll catch on to this strategy.
yo congrats on #1 on trending <3
Anyone realize that the Pinocchio one is is voiced by Pauly shore
Literally the moment I saw the character designs I dreaded the fact I had to watch this awful god forsaken abomination of a movie. I had to watch this with my family and my little brother was just laughing. I was just sitting there on the couch rotting because of how fucking awful and terrible it was. Me and my sister were literally just dying seeing this movie. If you want to know how to torture someone, put this movie on repeat. Literally so fucking bad.
Netflix cares about quantity over quality they know that people watch their movies half asleep so they don't really care about quality unless it's an Oscar bait movie like The Irishman or Marriage Story. Theatrical movies tend to at least have more quality or entertainment in them since people have to pay for each individual movie rather than just adding countless forgettable movies to pad out their libraries
whoever made this movie definitely has vore, furry and fart fetishes or some shit
You almost made me want to watch this. Almost. I’m not going to 😂
“Who says I can’t give a negative score? -6/10” Danny you are scalding in this video 😂💀
Have you people ever read marmaduke lmao? They aren't exactly disgracing high level source material.
Congrats on trending :)
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
I agree it would have been funnier if he just died and that was the end
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, and others.  I thought there couldn't be a movie worse than He's All That Man was I wrong
incredible that they managed to make a movie where you actively root for the dog to die
i didn't really care about the movie and writing the only thing i really cared about was the comedy i laughed so hard i couldn't breathe when i saw the fart scene
Bleach your brain from this mess by watching Underdog 😂
Isn’t this a remake?
This is like Scooby-Doo but bad.
comically shitful trophy
omg i was literaly dieing
Is this the same streaming service that made Klaus?😟
Bruh number number one in trending man's is right about fastest growing channed
I watched this movie, I......enjoyed it....so much..yep
I’m genuinely in shock over how that *one scene* is legit straight out of a furry fetish animation. It’s even worse when you actually look it up (I saw the clip in another video and it is BAD.)  Edit: For clarity, I’m referring to the scene where Marmaduke is at the dog show and eats all the food, then gets fat and farts a lot.
To be fair, now I wanna watch that movie lol. Danny made it seem like a funny cartoon.
“At ThE hAndS oF tHiS Do-…soRRy, pAws oF THis doG” 🤪 💅

They are totally doing it!! Even the Addison Rae movie they have another show with two people watch Netflix shows on Netflix and they literally shit on it the whole time it's so obvious they know it's bad
When in doubt, fart joke

Let's goooo!! Birthday upload!!
این سس شرا چیه این همه ویوو هم خورده
I think...  I think theyre relying on us, the content creators, and the viewers, to make videos and watch said videos about their bad movies, instead of just making successful good movies that people actually wanna watch
So what is Pete Davidson’s appeal? I’ve never seen him commit to a sketch or successfully pull off a character… Seems like he gets away with a lot. But other comedians like him? Is it a counter-culture thing?? Pete doesn’t care and that’s hilarious?!?!
why does guy look like an off brand once-ler from lorax
this should be a try not to laugh
Glad i dont use Netflix since they took out Hetalia.
wow I did not expect to cry when marmaduke died...
guy is a tumblr sexyman
It’s wild to think shit like Klaus is made on the same platform as this movie. Netflix is really desperate for anything to work, and they aren’t keeping track of what does.
#1 trending congrats Danny, now  you are just like troom troom
this video was tbh one of the funniest ones of yours I’ve watched in a while. I can’t stop laughing. I think it’d be funny, maybe on your second channel, to react to roblox tiktoks?
danny: "this guy isnt that bad he's not the villain" guy one minute later: **beats up dog**
what they should've done, was never say Marmaduke, just have each family member call him something different like boy. and then at the end have the dad say "are you ok" and then flash up Marmaduke on the screen and then roll credits (like invincible)
Why are Netflix movies so bad but Netflix series so good 😭
I think this was based on the live action marmaduke ehich was decent but they completely changed everything aswell? Idk i think it was loosely based not to mention the same cat species
marmaduke? more like marmadukey

Got a big bad dumper drop it low
At least Netflix made The Sea Beast, which I haven’t actually watched yet, 😅 but I heard it’s one of the best movies of the year
i havent watched this yet and im already turned on
And yet they made Klaus, which is one of the best Christmas movies I’ve seen in ages.
19:51 Danny wtf was that
i’m crying why does he say petes full name everytime😭😭
The animations so freaking ugly. It's so 'disney sequel level' animation.
That 2D sequence for the credits seemed better than the movie
Why are you watching movies aimed at young children and explaining why they don't appeal to you its aimed to be liked by  young children the video title is misleading and you not liking it is irrelevant. You are a pretty strange guy.
i dont know what this movie has to do with the 1954 comic strip by brad anderson
1. i was baffled by how long the movie feels/is 2. how tf did they get pete to do it???
I think the bigger question and mystery is how do you lift up the object you’re lifting when your standing on top of it…..
12:13 love the special effects
I’m trying to look at this from a positive lens and give these overworked, underpaid animators some credit but jesus christ the way the people look is so jarring. They look like goddamned daddy long leg spiders it creeps me out
yo danny andrew tate responded
Danny I have to say I laughed very hard at this video at 3am. Good video👍
that awkward moment when you're depressed and work with kids so you watched this movie three times in one week 🤡
this movies plot is a little too close to wanted's (2008) for my liking
hey guy
why is disney animation from 2001 infinetely better than this, made 2 whole decades later
I think the animation style gave me an aneurysm. My brain is bleeding out. Please send an ambulance.
Danny please explain how your #1 on trending

Why does the Art style remind me of Sausage party😟
The ONLY dog you hope dies in a movie. Ever. Good job.
he uploaded this before being able to see the Resident Evil series. he did not suspect that it could become even worse.
His ears are flying😂😂🤣😂18:08
How are you so good at barking??? There's no way the part about him being so fat he can barely move isn't someone's fetish. I'm gonna go and bet the farting is too.
i agree completely that it would've been funnier if he died. it would've taken a lot of audacity and i would've loved it lol
I can't believe The Producers escaped into the real world and still make money off terrible movies
There is a live action Marmaduke that came out before this one and it's actually kindof decent, maybe check that one out lol
10:09 Nickocado Avocado be like
I swear this is copying the sims movie about a dog that gets losts and travels the entire world to get back to their owner. THEY EVEN WENT TO EGYPT!

When I clicked this video, I didn't realize I signed up for hearing the phrase "Look at his nose to arm ratio" and now I can't stop laughing.
11:21 "50,000 people used to live here, now its a ghost town"
Ok but why does Danny look hot from every angle 😦
I think the trainer would be a dog whisperer so cartoon logic would make sense if he understands the dog
I COULD SNAP THE DADS BONES LIKE A DRY SPHAGETTI NOODLE
Listen, the horrible camera transitions show all of this. It went from trainers FOOT to him talking IMMEDIATELY 🥲
The mom got me tweaking
I'm such an emotional person I cried when it looked like marmaduke was dead
16:26 Forget the dog competition, Zeus belongs to the Umbrella Academy! His mass hypnosis is a fucking superpower! Actually the previous dog who lifted the stadium should go too.
I can’t believe this movie was made this year. The animation is the worst I’ve ever seen

"Run Marmaduke run."
apparently this movie is based on the marmaduke comics?? and they made a "live action" version in 2010 with owen wilson lmao. what a strange franchise
"Run Forrest Run" Marmaduke pulled a Forrest Gump he just ran.
My name is Gabriel but that’s just long for Greg
Literally 3 seconds into the movie and the color palette of the animation looks like some random little kid scarfed down a whole bag of skittles and threw it up all over his front yard. How could anyone think this was okay to put out as a final product?
Guy is Guy? I thought I was Guy
all I remember is that a dog lifts a stadium and he destroys a pool
I just uploaded my first vlog fellas, if you could check it out I would appreciate it a lot; blessings from Canada
Doesn’t he actually die in the live action movie?
The movie sucks but Netflix didn't make it. They just distributed it. Doesn't make it less bad, but I feel like Netflix's role in this shitty movie has been mischaracterized. Also the clip of the Pinocchio movie that was shown isn't from Netflix's Pinocchio. It's a completely different crappy Pinocchio that came out in 2021. Netflix's Pinocchio is a Gillermo Del Torro project, and I don't think anyone would say that betting money on Gillermo Del Torro is a dumb move. Marmaduke is a terrible movie, and Netflix does make some pretty bad and confusing decisions, but the premise of the video seems confused also.
The mum is the directors answer to the question "tits or ass"
Lol, I felt bad for Danny for a minute, I thought he actually put a hole in his wall. Awesome VFX Danny, looked legit.
The character design is truly so upsetting
This is what should be on trending😂
Oh great, another animated rapping dog that doesn't fit with the entire movie. What a titanic amount of cringe.
Look up money laundering through movies.
Danny Gonzalez goofing on a character for having skinny arms and a big nose is peak 2022 irony

why do these character and environment designs and animations look like a mix between YT kids at 3 am and bad mobile game ads??

On the bright side The Sea Beast is absolutely amazing

To be honest, I don't hate the designs, they just really shouldn't be 3D lol. If this was a "Rhapsody In Blue Fantasia 2000" it could be really charming, maybe. And do not get me wrong, I LOVE weird exaggerated overly impractical surreal designs done in 3D. Igor, 2008, one of my favorite animated movies of all time specifically for the exaggerated art style. But y'know, you have to have an understanding of what you're making. The animation in this looks like it wants to be a Dr. Seuss CGI knockoff, but even those movies knew you could only go so far with surrealism. Anyway, my best memories of Marmaduke are of the episode about an older movie from The Flop House Podcast LOL.
10:28 **auf der heinde intensifies**

Missed ya Danny ❤️❤️
Why Netflix- why did you have to ruin the movie I loved as a kid :(((((
Ur nUMBER ONE ON TRENDING BRO
“Our dog is a loser” killed me lmao
Fellow Gregs, we did it. We got Danny to the top of the trending page.
I'd rather watch Cats for 12 hours straight than watch Netflix marmaduke a second time.
Dang. I know it’s dumb to like kids shoes as an adult. But. She-Ra, Kipo, and this new one called dead end park are all amazing. I hope Netflix stops with this idea of making awful movies. Because we all know they can make great things. Omg even Hilda. that was enjoyable. And wholesome.
Welp. I hated that.
We played this at work for the kids. None of them liked the movie. Usually 1-2 will even with the worst movie but they were all grossed out lol
How is this the same company that made Stranger Things
lmao the mom character even has boob physics
Why is the thumbnail just Danny staring into my soul…
I KNEW IT! THERE'S A MOVIE FROM 2010 BY THE SAME NAME! I loved it when i was younger, this _ABOMINATION_ is just an animated version!
Can you do a video on stupid channels there is legit an account called greyson Smith for example I just saw who has 84.4k subscribers and he just posts the same short of saying "I bet bet you $900 dollars I'll subscribe back to you in 30 seconds" and there'd easily the same exact short posted 50 times or something it's mad funny and ridiculous
drew gooden is the world's best barker which we know obviously from his vine so its pretty clear his biggest fan 'guy' would also be quite fluent in the language of dog
Bro, you can get away with this
I think heartstopper and Stranger things are the only shows that keep Netflix alive.
The farting thing has to be a fetish thing
I think this movie looks pretty good, am I crazy? Maybe if I actually watched it I'd change my mind but I liked the jokes, animation was fine, and Pixar mom bod is always good
whty is the 2d animated end credits genuinely more well animated then the rest of the movie
I have a deep philosophical belief that if a dog talks, you can kick it. For training purposes, of course.
I actually loved the live action Marmaduke as a kid it was so good
something about the way this movie looks/sounds reminds me of goat story,, it's very off-putting 👌
The ad read makes me feel like I'm laying my head in your lap while you read me a discount code. thank you <3
I thought that he WAS dead so I was laughing and then he was alive and I was like. Why? The movie would have actually made sense if he died! It would be just because it's trash.
daddy got #1 trending
Yes egg, slender, and thiccccccc hip mom
W Directors for that mom design
Cannot believe they ruined the Marmaduke brand. Maybe just pumped out a movie to keep the brand in house? Like movie companies do to keep the brand.   Or maybe it was just a money laundering scheme. Sliding money into peoples pockets and claiming it required 10s of millions to make 🤷‍♂️
As someone who grew up with the original Marmaduke I'm severely disappointed
#1 on trending. Disgusting
fr tho
U just made this movie popular, anti effect
have you seen the movie snow queen? it’s a ripoff of frozen it’s free with ads on youtube
AND THEY TAKE CRIMINAL MINDS OFF OF NETFLIX FOR THESE.
ayo i watched 2010 marmaduke all the time cause it was the only dvd my friend had this is so sad
i feel so terrible for the animators, dude. not just for netflix downsizing the animation department, but them having to make do and turn out shit like this. they must feel terrible about this work, and it probably wasn't even their choice to make. there's nothing i hate more than working with bad designs and bad prompts and being able to do nothing about it, and im positive these animators feel the same. i just hope that they can get hired at better studios because of the name, and i hope that they can at least feel a little proud of their work.
i thought about watching it but now i can just watch this video and i don’t have to put myself through that on my own
NOT MY BOY MARMADUKE! WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS TO HIM 😭
My little brother and my mom were watching this in my living room one day, and I stoped by while I was eating my dinner and was horrified. I came in around the end and it was so bad I couldnt even watch it.
Have you ever heard of The Producers? Because that's the only answer I can fathom for why they're doing this.
that guy guy looks like danny
#1 ON DRENDING???? GOOD FOR YOU DANNY :))))
I like max
Sea beast was actually a pretty good movie
the og marmaduke movie did not deserve this

I like Pete, he’s funny & tbh I wish I were him on SNL. Plus he somehow went out with A LOT of hot women in Hollywood while looking like a methhead, HOW?!? One of his exes said it’s bc he listens but other men in relationships listen….? I think it’s kinda bc he’s rich even tho they are too & the media loves him bc he’s open about stuff.
I used to love Marmaduke comics as a kid.  Wtf is this?  I hate this. Why'd you have to show me this, Danny?

Danny just so you know your eyebrows ALWAYS turn me on
Imagine working your ass off for YEARS  to become an animator, and then ending up working for one of the biggest streaming networks ever, only for them to tell you to make this😐
yes. its a money washing front
gentle giant
Omg, the live action Marmaduke (2010) wasn’t that great, but it was still entertaining. This redo has to die. They took the most minute things from the original and added a bunch of shit and fart jokes. Not to mention Carlos the cat was just written out.
Why are these comments all so long?
trending wow
Maybe all these bad movies are building up to something. Think about it, the End Times are coming (maybe)! And what is something all people love with no exceptions? Well, other than dog food, movies!  So, before Gandalf can make his Second Cameo and rise against the dark forces of Michael Bay, humans need something nice; something that will leave a good taste in our mouths. I can't promise it will be a sequel to Morbius, but rest assured, it will be something grand and it will boost our morale so we can fight alongside the last remaining Hot Dog Angels  Then maybe, just maybe, we WILL ascend to the heavens and sit at the right hand side of Antonio Vivaldi. His beautiful music will play as we drink chocolate milk and eat veggie burgers, just like the great Sir Shaggeth Rogers wanted for the future of humanity...   Or maybe, Hollywood is just dumb
why does no one remember the original marmaduke movie fromdisney channel? :(
To answer the question; yes, they do it on purpose. They know that people will watch it either way, either because they're kids and don't know any better, they're loyal to the brand and will uncritically accept anything that's put in front of them, or just out of bile fascination. Doesn't matter what the quality of the movie is, it'll be found and it'll be watched and that's all they need. So why make one good movie that takes a year and $70m to make when you could make 100 bad movies that each cost a fraction of the price and make the same amount of money (if not more) all put together?
i think its hilarious how laura is prolly just in the house listening to danny yell at his camera
kind of a side note but the pog music at 14:14 makes me miss his minecraft series
actually Marmaduke is also available on Amazon Prime and it's much better
Danny can you fix the link in the description and put a space before the and on the link?
Pete Davidson is not funny
Honestly this movie looks like it was made 15 years ago.
The art department must’ve made this film in a week.
I think the social environment we live in now makes criticism seem as if it's always bad and anyone who gives criticism is a asshole. Which is ass backwards and detrimental to growth and positive change on a whole. It blows my mind sometimes talking to people. There of course could be other factors but to me this makes the most sense
This shit was anime like an early 2010s TV show
Wait👁️👄👁️wut happened to peanut? 👁️👄👁️He had a dog named peanut right? 👁️👄👁️

#2 On trending, be here to see it
I’m sure someone else has already said this, but I think a lot of the entertainment industry realized that when they get to a certain point of success, they don’t need to try to make good or even decent movies/shows anymore, because they know that their fans (especially kids) will watch anything. It really sucks cause nowadays our expectations for new movies have gone down by a lot because half of the movies coming out are so mediocre or just straight up terrible.
Danny looks so genuinely sad in the thumbnail I think this is the movie that finally broke him. 💀 Stay strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 on trending 🎉🎉
What she sees: 19:50
They couldent just take ques from the live action marmiduke movie, atleast that was half good
I know this is concern trolly or whatever but I really wish they wouldn't show kids animal abvse in cartoons, especially if they're going to act like it's legit training
danny should review the netflix series “sexy beasts” . let’s just say it’s nothing short of atrocious.
THEY RUINED MARMADUKE?????
I can't imagine when these people where discussing this movie.
Zeus looks like John Travolta…
Ah yes my two least favorite movie categories, Netflix original and overdone remakes/adaptations 🙃
The bad guy is Marmaduke
This looks awful bruh Pete couldn't give em some money for budget I feel like 30 bucks would've changed this movie for the better
The A.I. theory is exactly what I think happened with that awful Red Notice movie. I'm a fan of Dwayne and Ryan and man it was bad. It was every action trope rolled into one and the twist was obviously coming.
I love who the dad just flipping explodes as soon as he touches the grill and danny ignores it and starts talking about how thick his nose it like yeah the dads been through the ringer the dog keeps screwing with him and know some youtuber is making fun of his body and calling his wife thick then he just flipen explodes
Me and my friends watched this to joke around. We nicknamed him “Rooby Scoo.”
Wait. They made a Marmaduke movie? O.o
Scooby Poo was a solid joke
My sister put this movie on the other day and I hoped Danny would make a video on it 😭
Not even the art style but just the way it’s animated is reminiscent of like 2002ish low budget 3D animation movie, not something coming from a multibillion dollar company
Lmfao marmaduke was some fkn dog man
This reminds me of the Dc superhero pet movie is feels like a bad movie cash grab just famous pepper voice actor trying to get money
Review 2010 Marmaduke now. It's leagues better than this one. 9% on Rotten Tomatoes.
I think the thing with a lot of bad Netflix animation nowadays is that the animation is 3D when it could very well look better in 2D. I feel like whenever artists create sketches of characters, it doesn't always translate right in 3D. Like I know that 3D is technically faster and cheaper, but idk I feel like the integrity of whatever movie they make declines heavily just because the movie's executives want to do 3D since it's so trendy rn. Like it's been proven time and time again for years by companies like Laika and Studio Ghibli that a movie doesn't have to be made in a 3D software for it to become successful.
We have the same name… are we the same person?
3:21 The mom can't even stand up straight the pixar body is giving her scoliosis
my girlfriend and i tried to watch this movie...3 minutes in and we're like nope we're out 💀💀 ITS SO BAD, and mind you my gf LOVES every cartoon movie regardless, but this the only one she cant stand. its tellin' sumn
WHY IS IT ANIMATED LIKE VEGGIE TALES
Bad, ew, no, Have a great day!
Danny ur thumbnail got me 💀💀💀
6:14 you had the perfect chance to say “they started putting their maradukes up” I’m disappointed Danny
the trainer just wants to bring him harm-aduke

why would u look down at us like that during the ad
pls- i watched this movie w my lil sister not too long ago, i miss who i was before i saw the stupid dog show scene 😭😭
Yeah cause the one voice I always pictured when reading a Marmaduke comic strip was Pete Davidson
I can smell you through the screen
Donda
I've seen my fair share of fetish scenes but this takes the cake
danny please tell me you’ve seen the live action version of this movie, with Owen Wilson
DANNY I SAW YOU AT THE UNITED CENTER! You looked at me from the front entry and I was so surprised to see you. I flew from Aus to see John so I was super excited to get a double wammy of legends in one night!! Hope you had fun!! 🎉
i watched marmaduke (the one made in 2010) constantly as a kid but cannot tell you the plot lmao
The worst part is they couldn't even make a original idea. Marmaduke is already a movie
e
"This movie quite literally caused depression"
Mom I wanna go home
From a movie nobody asked to a cartoon that I don't even know why was made
Marmaduke.. I remember when that was popular. It was a bad movie then too.
Shut up about the dog we want mom
999k views, and 99k likes. What's going on
This movie is so ratshit that it’s hardly even worth noting that this movie is an absolute rip of the 2010 movie by the same title. They are both about Great Danes named marmaduke who cause a lot of trouble. What the fuck is even this shit man.
Nobody is going to see this so ill say it now. . . My lil soldier is small
My 6 year old brother watched this movie and liked it. He rarely watches movies too bc YouTube made his attention span so short.
For years, I have felt like Marmaduke at around 13 minutes into this video.
I watched this while fried and it was captivating
This was the movie I’ve ever seen
I genuinely think one of two things: 1) the owner has more stake in a different streaming service 2) the owner is about to lose majority stake in the business and is trying to tank the stock to secure their majority share
marmaduke belongs in the "disgustingly annoying and unloveable animal characters" along with gooby
see the problem with this is that the disobedient dog is sapient. when he goes back to guy to ask for training, he chose to do that. he can just choose to be obedient, nothing's actually inhibiting that
Hey Danny my names Iseia (Isaiah),it’s my 18th bday thanks for the vid sir captain man
dose Danny have red hair???!
Wait so did the Bulldog end up winning?
Oh god a new Pinocchio movie
This movie is disguised for those people that have that weird HUGE stomach fetish
Not Danny Boy trending 🥰
Zues kinda looks like saruman the white
I work at a summer camp and I was forced to watch this monstrosity
Its giving Ratatoottoot
Netflix made a really good movie, “The Sea Beast” it’s awesome and I highly recommend it
Marmoduke is actually a really good movie in my i opinion
this is an insult to the Marmaduke comics
Hiiiii
This show puts shame to the og marmaduke movie.... That was my fav dog movie growing up
“Sorry babe I can’t watch your stream Danny Gonzales just posted a video after 80 years”
Danny why did you edit your face on the thumbnail? Just why?
god the poor dog in this absolutely feels like my childhood, like fuck if id've seen this as a kid I would've lost my shit and cried bc its so unfair. (don't want sympathy btw, I think a lot of people have nasty upbringings and it's not ok, but not the internet's job to fix either). Dogs (and kids obvi) are never ever responsible for their own care, they are to be cared for and safe and not worried about the hardships of those caring for them.
did you actually punch a hole in your wall while defending marmalade or whatever? maybe you see more of yourself in him than you'd like to admit😔💔
Holy shit Danny 12:21
When Marmaduke “died” why was the dad saying he was such an amazing dog? And that he loved him? No you didn’t. You DESPISED that dog.
brad anderson im so sorry they turned your comic into... this 😭😭😭
Who named this dog the fuck???
Tomorrow entreteinment lawsuit No problem the whole world we wanna see your employment documents contract everything
man, I love pete davidson, but this is... why did they do this.
At the end of my school year we watched Marmaduke and it was horrible…idk how some of the other kids actually enjoyed it 😬
Jesus loves y’all ❤️
Aah fuck, he's alive!       -Danny Gonzalez, 2022
Idk who's idea it was to make them all so frickin skinny but it's so disturbing
Good thing they bought a Saddle Up Doggy from Amazon for the talent show.
Netflix makes such movies bro their movies are some of the ever
7:53 you got it all wrong, Guy understands dog and Marmaduke can understand English. So Marmaduke is barking, Guy is understanding and translating, then he responds in English, and Marmaduke understands and translates that.
2:05 AuGHhHahah
when marmaduke kept saying *I gotta go!*  I thought of *ROB!! GOTTA GO.*
I died at “detonated a chemical weapon at the dog show.” How can he say that without laughing 😂😂😂
Danny keeps saying foul/fowl swoop Danny doesn't know the phrase is "fell swoop"
6:33 that’s what Cesar Millan does
Netflix is outsourcing it's animation to BillionSurpriseToys
I think this movie is based on a live action film of the same name. It stars Owen Wilson and Emma Stone
These "bad" movies kids love. There's a bunch of tv shows and movies from when I was a kid that my parents hate. So not a surprise we don't like kid movies that come out these days
somebody in that writers room absolultely had some sort of weird kink
Honestly with this and that wired paws of furry movie it just feels like corporation’s are seeing how little money, time and energy they can put into a project before it becomes unacceptable.
danny is #2 on trending :D ♥  Edit: WOAH #1 NOW IT'S ONLY BEEN AN HOUR AFTER I MADE THIS COMMENT

THE GREG PILLOWSSS
ae
Danny you should try watching the marmaduke from 2010 it’s definitely better than this mess.
For as much as I hear about him, I have never seen Pete Davidson in anything.
Your little skits are literally always bangers Danny. Idk how you're so funny every time 😅
there are three genders:  eerily slender bouncing egg Mom
Netflix 5 Years Ago: Releases a Few Good Movies Netflix Now: All Horrible Talking Animal Movies.
The fart scene literally traumatized me also Pete Davidson should be bullied for doing this movie
This movie has the same vibe as movies like nanny McPhee where you never know what insane crap they’re going to throw at you
danny thinking hypnosis is magic and not real is genuinely so funny
"is your dog pooping in the wrong spot ever that funny?" like no not really but markipliers roomba story 👀👀👀👀
If I was a writer on this movie instead of copypasting the same short list of things on the dog trainer invoice I would have filled it with random things, like stuff from my grocery list maybe, and then I 100% would have made “Netflix” the $1.4M item
The redeeming thing about the movie is the dog,
My little cousins watch this and love 13:55
Marmaduke looks like a glitched sims dog when he stand up 😭
This animation makes me very uncomfortable
so this is the "guy" drew gooden has been talking to all this time
my lil bro watched this
I am scared
The animation in the credits was better than the rest of the whole movie 💀
the fact this movie’s r based on smth
I watched this movie 12-15 feet away without my glasses and it was alright
We need a girl defined reaction
whenever danny reacts to movies its really just him overthinking every movie but not complaining cause its funny
He dates kim for a year and he thinks he’s kanye
I have been watching this channel for ages and I just realized this for the first time: egregious means to stand out from/be outside the flock, aka the "greg". Gregarious means to be social and kind of flock-oriented; you love interacting with the "greg" and seek them out. That makes Greg, like, the single funniest randomly selected name for a fandom you could pick. Why did it take me so long to put this together. Am I the last one to notice this haha
6:34 I mean that’s how it goes sometimes so-
This is the funniest video evee
Marmaduke is a pretty good comic strip but WHY MUST YOU DO THIS TO MY BOY!!!!!
Zeus looks like Gerald from “Finding Dory”

Awesome videos sorry I’m so late
Funny vid danny
Is this movie AI generated?
Pete is coming after you now 😂😤
#2 on trending??? Let’s goooo
Danny, in my personal opinion this is your funniet video and I KNOW YOU CARE WHAT I THINK BECAUSE i like like you tehe
I’m hoping the people who relied on Marmaduke for pay were paid well. Sometimes, you have to do jobs you don’t love because bills and housing must be paid, food must be bought. It’s just how it is.
Danny do you seriously not know who marmaduke is? Seriously?
this is one of the funniest videos ive ever seen
Omg marmaduke is a GREAT Dane 😢😢😢😢 that JOKE I suffocated
Does anyone remember the old live action marmaduke? That was better than this hunk of sh!t
my best friends dads name is guy
#2 on trending. Damn Daniel
this sounds like every other low budget dog movie ever. "bad dog gets reformed"
isnt that the pharmaceutical worker from that one trippie redd song
i will not take thjs marmaduke slander
bruh the british dog trainer is literally william afton. brown hair purple suit yellow pocket and super skinny wayy too simular lmao
DOPE 🔥 U CAN HAVE MY BABY MAMA IF I HAVEN’T THE HARDEST MUSIC OUT NOW NO 🧢
this seems like a movie from the 2000s
this dude is really trying to find reason to a kids movie 🤨😭
Lol I watched marmaduke and I liked it because they captured the Great Dane personality perfectly
I hate that these are the models that were chosen for this movie. They don’t resemble the original comic strip at all. The art style for this movie should’ve been closer to that of Calvin and Hobbes than this shit. It would be like making a Garfield movie but in the art style used in the Mars Needs Moms movie. What the hell
I don't think I've seen character designs that make me as uncomfortable as these ones. Like, every character could be replaced by a titan from AoT and I'd be less creeped out. AND THE ANIMATION IS SO WEIRD.
my mom forced me and my younger siblings to watch this :,)
yet again confirming the fact that kanye is better than pete
thumbnail danny doesnt look like real danny. where is he.
everytime he looked at the camera and blamed marmaduke for his family’s financial ruin I LOST IT
why is the ad in bj pov
The live action Marmaduke from 2010 will always be a staple in my childhood. Why did they have to ruin it?
Pete Davidson in this movie is the epitome of how i've always felt about him.  He's not funny, like at all.  I get thats subjective, and people probably disagree, but his role in SNL and other things he's been in have just seemed to be "he's here, might as well film him.".
theres a old marmaduke movies there better i think
The best animation in the entire movie was the 2D segment at the credits, I wonder how it would’ve looked if it was entirely 2D
So we just not gonna talk about that sponsor pov????
At this pont they're going to make an irl Spongebob movie where people just dress up as a sponge and starfish and go on an boring adventure with ass storyline
IMHO….Kris got this movie made fast for Pete so the kids had something to recognize him from 👀
“He had bigger fish to fry” yeah on the grill he just blew up 💀
#2 on trending, congrats Danny!
I was watching this in class 💀💀
This was a reward for  The class
So many quotes from this video need to be clipped
I love movie commentaries!! Siempre me muero de risa ❤️
i have a fear of insects (specifically the legs) and i literally can’t watch this video because the stupid character designs are too similar to insects 😭😭
I can’t take it seriously
My science teacher played this in class I almost died
All the scenes are funny even when marmaduke almost dies
Do the owners feed Marmaduke at all during the movie. Maybe they're neglecting their dog and that's why he's so hungry.
Greg
For a second I thought the ponnochio clip was Danny voicing over then I realized it’s the actual voice
Marmaduke shitting in the trophy reminds me of the death animation for soul master and lost kin from Hollow Knight
i refuse to believe this movie was made recently it fucking looks like jimmy neutron
What the f did they do to the original marmaduok the original live action one was not bad but the is new thing is completely shat.
nobody is going to see my comment but i just had to put it out there, that dog near the end definitely wasn't a bulldog. it was an American Bully
no outro?1!1!1
Netflix is interesting because they have been releasing great things like ozark and stranger things but at the same they have been losing subscribers
I feel like Guy, the British guy, has tumblr sexyman potential. The suit, the quriky glasses, the accent, the morally questionable behaviour -- it's all there.
The trainer is Justin Chad in real life. Praise the started of World War One.
The song Pete Davidson does at the end has heavy "Show Me Your G*nitals" vibes to me
I remember the comic. The only joke of Marmaduke is “big dog is big”
the budget: 60% Pete Davidson 5% antidepressants 5% the animating 7th graders paycheck 10% therapy  20% the lsd the creators were taking
oh my god, marmaduke. I’ve neen traumatized by this movie. So, there’s a movie room in this aftercare area for summer camps (which I assist for, I’m a volunteer) and they run the WORST movies in there. Well, one kid asked me to play a board game in there with them so I agreed and went in with them. I look at the screen, and it’s marmaduke. I had never heard of, seen, knew anything about it, etc. In the 30 minutes I was trapped in that god awful room, the scene where marmaduke takes a massive shit in the trophie and releases a bioweapon everywhere, oh my god, I was pleading every second of my life in that room to be able to leave, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE THIS MOVIE WHILE I SAT THERE. IMPOSSIBLE.
Wait… wasn’t there a live action marmaduke? That was actually good? Ummmmm was this a copy?
Varly is back
4:02 my dog stepped on a bee
danny why do you look like you photoshopped your features in the thumbnail
my brother was watching this movie and i came at the ending dog competition and i was like who tf made this 😬
That hole in the wall animation you did, who is better than any of the animations in this movie
Im sure this movie is based on the real marmaduke movie voiced acted by owen wilson back in 2010 which is again very unnecessary
The real question is Hollywood making bad movies on purpose ..I can't tell you the last movie I was actually looking forward to seeing and was actually good.
My school was showing this movie at the end of school and i think watching it gave me a migraine
I give this movie an 11               Out of 100..
Dude look like Charlie puth
Jeeze. Never realized what a whiny b**ch Pinocchio was.
at this point nothing on netflix matters to me. the only exception is stranger things
This movie feels the same as the weird knock off movies but it’s made by Netflix and has Pete Davidson. So surreal.
I hate how low quality some will make...what I assume is a film...for children *because* it's meant for children
i feel like this movie is some weird fetish shit--
as a nanny, all i can say is that i pray to any higher power that exists that my kids never stumble upon this movie
the worst movie i'll see is this spanish movie called little eggs: an african rescue, about russians taking american eggs (eggs are the babies of the chickens, with faces, arms and legs, everything) and they take them to africa for...some reason
They spent their entire budget on Pete
My freaking siblings wanted to watch this and I said NO
"Putting your DUCES up" ?!?  🤔 like shitting in your hands and unveiling your palms with a mischievous smile like an asshole toddler that's owned you?
the animation and ratios of the characters’ bodies hurts my eyes and makes my brain feel like a car battery.
The Sea Beast was good everything else ass
Imagen in like 5 years Netflix loses lots of buyers and your kids ask whats netflix then you show them this video:
3:34 I find it rude how your making mean comments about the characters bodies, it dosent matter. its art. you can't see the art because you have no vision. artist who are creative see vision and see beauty even in the ugly that is creativity and if you don't see the beauty of it that's because your not creative and you have no vision. the design of the body is not bad but the design of the animation is bad!!
The new marmaduke is a slap to the face to anyone who watched the original. The original is a banger and I will fight anyone who disagrees
it’s weird how they made this movie with the same name and almost similar concept of the original marmaduke but somehow made it SO different
My younger brother was watching the movie Marmaduke and I was dying, I don’t know how I survived
12:21 that sh*t looks so real i gasp.
I think it's impressive how they recreated basic stick figure characters in 3d /s
Bro I watched this in school and it was hilarious
I'll have you know that I was drinking during your shit-zu/fart-zu joke and nearly choked to death.
Did you actually put a hole in your wall?
"he's not that bad" guy proceeds to repeatedly beat up a dog
With the negative 6 score, this implies the existence of a negative 10. I wonder what something this score will be given to.
6:52: Batman training Robin
I watched the review of Goat Story 1 and 2 from Kurtis yesterday and this is just perfect for today!
yeah its probably to make you make a video about it
spent the entire video waiting for danny to mention the original marmaduke starring owen wilson but now i feel like i just invented that one in my head
I feel like this would be one of the movies your teacher would put on during a free day...
yes
Was the live action version better?
Why is Marmaduke's design super fugly??
17:22 is def going on twitter
Damn this small YouTuber is pretty funny! You should scubscribe!
Putting their deuces up?? I mean, I don’t mean to brag, but I happen to be an aficionado in the ways of language, and I believe the terms is ‘to put one’s dukes up’. Ohoho
Marmaduke duke of marmalade
I’m pretty sure the original Marmaduke is a live action from 2010. It was way better.
Marmaduke for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars 😩
Marmaduke was also a live action from 2010 that flopped so it failed twice now lol
Nothing to do with the movie, but its kinda strange to see a 12 year old boy with grey hair. Like, how do you manage that, Danny?
Are we just gonna ignore mom's uhhh package?
Marmaduke breaks the law of conservation and then proceeds to gas innocent civilians (5 dead 19 injured).
I thought it was gonna be about the old Marmaduke movie at first and sure it wasn't great but it wasn't that bad right? Or am I just making it better in my memories?
they canceled the wings of fire animation for this.... let that sink in
Owen Wilson did it better.
I'm sorry, that ad intro was the funniest shit
Nooooooooo marmaduke
wye
Pay trashy people, get trashy returns. And stop getting vasectomies to get points with wrong headed broads. Get your reality straight, this last ten years of culture out of this company is meant to warp you.
i rarely feel ill and nauseous watching something especially animated but this was an exception   10/10 movie i hope to never see it again and forget it ever existed
Whenever I hear the word heinous I also hear the Law and Order *Dun Dun*
the answer to "why would they purposefully make bad movies": first, making a bad movie is easier and cheaper than making a good movie. Secondly, this vid is #2 on trending.
this is the funniest video ive ever seen
If you feel like torturing yourself more you should watch the 2019 movie a world away, it is so hilariously bad
10:50 Ever heard Markiplier's story about how Chica pooped and then the Roomba ran over it?... And then kept going...
the dogs name was cracking me up the whole time
He’s Drew Gooden’s biggest fan 😂😂👍 Love it
Danny Gonzales showing extreme restraint by not making a White Girls Fuck Dogs joke around the 8:20 mark.
me and my friend watch this and we just couldn’t take it seriously
i’m a nanny, and one day the kids wanted watch this. i’ve never been more disappointed in their movie taste, it was such an uncomfortable experience 😂
Danny I love your videos. But this movie is so bad that I can’t even watch you talk about it… still give the video a like tho
You killed are youngest daughter 🤣
well this was well-timed given that i just watched a bad netflix movie
Good to know that it was not just paranoia
My husband and I watched this with our kids, they checked out on it after about 8 minutes, then liked the dog competition at the end lol
Danny you’re cute hehe😘
Why did the man run around his bed?      Because he was trying to catch up on his sleep!
19:51 THE WAY HE SAID HELLO THO- 😳😵‍💫
no one has mentioned it's a comic strip. please look it up omg omg it was in the newspaper my entire childhood
real ones remember live action maramduke
these studios are just making terrible movies just for the sake of danny's content
i watch these videos and then say i’ve seen the movie. this is all i wanted to see
The 2D ending credit has better animation than the whole movie
We lost the Bone animated series for this
You shouldn’t have given certain people access to that angle in the sponsor.
A lot of the best animated shows/movies these days are all aimed towards the preteen to adult demographic, while a lot of the great animated stuff aimed towards younger audiences are far and few between. I guess they figure that younger kids will watch anything, so cheap 3d remake it is!
ur express vpn link isnt working jsyk
I need Drew Good to comment “oh theres my guy”
The worse thing is that Marmaduke's designs is not even comparable to the comics, which went for a more realistic approach. Not only is this a bad movie, this is also a bad adaptation
This animation just, something reminds me of like old animation movies or shows, like jimmy neutron. Something it just off? And I feel bad for the animators because they cant say anything about it.
Animators just keep making animation worse and worse, and Netflix is one of those people.
Marmaduke actually dies in a different older Marmaduke movie
No-one:  Danny: T *an* nt
i think danny really likes saying marmaduke
I feel like theres maybe a handful of good movies and shows on netflix
And they ignored all the rest of the pages in the book on how to make a movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:48 marmaduke's ears clipped through the curtain
The weirdest part was that the 2D animation at the end with the Marmaduke rap is so appealing in comparison to what we've all witnessed
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
Honestly, they probably got a Pete Davidson impersonator to do the voice acting, and then illegally said Pete Davidson was in the movie
The fact that the kid I used to babysit asked me to play this movie.  It wasn’t my first time having to watch it.
Go woke go broke 🧮🧐
6:34 shi made me spit out my drink even tho I knew it was coming 💀
I preffer rattatolile
“Put their deuces up” loool
The one thing in this movie that is slightly less terrible than the rest is that at 8:53 his ears and at 7:20 his tail form a heart.
Omg i watched the trailer for this and said to myself this looks so bad and was wondering when you would make a video about this apawling movie so thanks Danny
The movie literally fan-service for zoophile furries
danny’s hair gets better and better every video
bro how did they get the skinny peoples body types and movements from potato knishes
this makes me very upset not because it sucked, but because of the potential it had ! this seriously was an interesting story line for a kids movie, and wouldve introduced Marmaduke to the new generation, but no. they made whatever that was
It looks like the animators saw the memes about thicc pixar moms and then drunkenly challenged themselves to outdo them
this movie sucks ass my cousins mad me watch it and every two seconds i was on the verge of throwing myself into the tub with a toaster
What's really upsetting is that the coach said "not so Great Dane" instead of "The Great Pain". Such a missed opportunity for a solid dog breed roast.
Netflix’s content is truly starting to look like a 3rd tier cable channel from 2006, I’d be surprised if they dont lose all of their subscribers if they keep going like this
danny stares into my soul
🦑🐙The Sea Beast on Netflix was actually one of the best animated movies this year definitely recommend it! Also, must watch Bastard Heavy Metal Dark Fantasy anime on Netflix of course!🐲🐉
Today was my birthday, and honestly one of the worst birthdays of my life. I won’t go into detail, but I think the best part of this shitty day was you uploading :) thank you Danny 💖💖
why was that ad read at the end so sexy like whats up with that angle
＼(^o^)／
i cant get over how gray dannys hair is its crazy
I think pete davidson is a nice person but he has NEVER made me  laugh. He must have done some sexual favours in Hollywood or something.
I have a theory that Netflix is in fact making bad movies on purpose so people talk about and hate watch them.
Oh my god that end song is so bad dude
zesty Pinocchio
bro i bet some kid watched this movie and beat the crap outta their dog tryna make it sit 💀
sub to banana pop tarts
the animation in this is diabolical
I love how I got an ad for Manscaped with Pete Davidson in it
I'm not seeing anyone acknowledge that half of the bits here are kinks. One or two, whatever, but the amount of them and the way they're animated is 100% a kink thing. Furry artists draw shit like this all the time; stomach inflation, instantaneous inflation, hypnotizing, gas/foul body odors, in the gas part he was LITERALLY doing multiple ahegao expressions. I'm so sorry to drop this on y'all but this is just like Butch Hartman's mpreg and hyper-muscle fetish he threw into everything, but Marmaduke
i will not stand for pete slander in these comments yall
This looks like a knockoff illumination movie, so you know it’s really that bad  Also, marmaduke created the new Chernobyl at that park
So you're telling me that jojo part 6 is being delayed for this?
the character design feels like there trying really hard to be illumination (aka the people who made the minions) which is…. a choice
Why is Danny’s barking so realistic?
these characters remind me of those singing vegetables
2 on trending :D
Like there's already a live action Marmaduke before this I swear.
I am not Drew's biggest fan but I appreciate the mention thanks
11:15 ouch
Ugh so sad because as a Great Dane owner I was excited to hear you say Marmaduke but they did him SO dirty lol
congrats getting #2 on trending danny
At least The Sea Beast was good...
is it just me or does danny look weird in the thumbnail 😭 his nose just looks off
Have you seen the original live action marmaduke it’s my favorite movie
This movie sounds like some poor writers nightmare acid trip😭😭🤣🤣🤣
netflix likes to tease us with good shows and then cancel them immediately while they shit out the worst movies i have ever seen every day🥰
I cannot concentrate on anything after punching the wall. Is...that a real hole? Probably not but I'm so distracted trying to figure it out
This is #2 on trending, behind DudePerfect
This is the funniest shit I’ve seen in so long, like I actually laughed out loud continuously. Good work, bro.
Is anyone going to mention that this movie is also a remake of an old live action film?
I want to see Danny dissect a Disney movie- like ong watch Tangled or sum💀
I felt like I shouldn’t be breathing while watching this video lmao
If kids wanted to watch marmaduke they should have watched the older live action because that was a lot of fun as a kid!
As a kid I never really liked talking dog movies (probably because of what happenned in the fifth Warrior Cats book) so if I had seen this I probably would have burned the nonexistent dvd.
The end song with Marmaduke 'rapping' reminds me of the hip-hop dog from "Titanic The legend goes on"💀
Isn’t Marmaduke also a live action/CGI movie already?
They are always really good or really terrible, those damn netflix originals.   Every thought i had whilst sitting through the torture of that movie has been said in this video, so .... Good video lmao
Theres a live action marmaduke from 2010 that was a million times better than this, granted the last time I watched it was when I was around 6 or 7 so it might be worse than I thought 😭
OMG DANNY BOY YOU’RE #2 TRENDING!!
i’m super sick right now and i’m so out of it every time danny says “marmaduke” i end up laughing so hard my body aches even more
i once came home and my semi-small dog had shit about 3 feet up the wall and i have no idea how to this day and it was and is funny as hell
my favorite part of marmaduke is when marma told duke "it's marmin' time" and marmed all over him  i have not seen the video nor have i watched the movie
I had a substitute teacher who played this for us and no one was actually watching it lol
He’s realy giving us videos left and right now huh?
"Please roll credits, please roll credits. It would be so funny if Marmaduke dies- Oh f*ck he's alive" a pretty good Danny Gonzalez quote to take out of context.
That movie does sound terrible
The dog trainer in this movie was played by Cesar Milan, iykwim!
OG marmaduke is so much better.
Netflix  and their kite/bike/nickle owned/ran studios.
This ending with Marmaduke dying remembered me a Simpsons episode where the comic book guy show a comic book called "The Death of Marmaduke"
#2 on trending!
my life is worse now that i know about this movie
I think one of the worse animation choices here is that when marmaduke talks his lips turn into little pincers and i hate it
my favorite thing is to watch random animated movies in Netflix, usually they're just shit but at least funny.
First off Netflix had all the good movies  +then now they took away everything   :(
6:13 their MarmaDUKES up 😅
the punch in the wall had me fooled ngl
Why do I feel like this is someone's fetish? Im very tired of directors making children's film into just fart and shit jokes. Some of em are so fowl i wonder if it's actually theim sneaking their fetish into these films/shows. Yms has a video highlight where he went through a LOT of children's shows that has disturbing fart jokes.
letss goooo danny got on #2 trending
6:20 POV: Dio in the first episode of Jojo Bizarre Adventures.
Wasn’t this a remake of a live action movie?
No. Next question
God I love it when danny reviews bad movies he always makes me laugh to the point where I can't breathe
When you realize we could have gotten an animated Wings of Fire tv series and instead Netflix chooses to churn out shit like this
my 4 yr old brother loves marmaduke so i know he will be a social reject when he gets older
Marmaduke did not need a new movie
I was trying to think of why the name sounded so familair and its cause there was a 2010 film with the same name, so it's also a remake that's bad lmao
i quite liked it actually
The character designs are awful but what really makes it uncanny is how often they’ll just freeze like a statue in between their actions, just hideous. Also that whole fart gas scene feels like fetish shit lmao
Did you know in marmaduke when guy was driving in the car in the background there’s a Disney lightning McQueen car
Danny is in his good hair arc😫
why didn't they just do a "karate dog" route cuz that sounds like potential
This video is more funny than the entire movie 🤣😂🤣
Now I can’t stop thinking about nose to arm ratio tbh
I absolutely agree with them making bad movies!!!
Nose👃to arm ratio
Danny ur not looking in the lens/at me, u are looking v slightly to the left and we haven’t made eye contact this whole vid man
Great vid, Danny and currently #2 on trending! Killin' it, king.
Netflix came to me and said " We need a kids movie in an hour " had I been given more time it might have been better. Now they want me to crap out Stranger Things 5. I wish I never quit the car wash.
I guess you could say the dads bones are getting squishy
i just recently watched this movie, i think this might have been the best take on it i have seen.
If I Were A Movie Maker, I Wouldn't Make Bad Movies On Purpose, I'd Make Good Movies On Purpose.
I’m genuinely interested what Danny’s favorite movie is?
8:21
oh my god i thought you really punched through your wall lmaoo
Danny just overlook Marmaduke after running 25,000 + Miles, swimming two giant oceans, climbing Mt. Everest, and surviving the entire African deserts in a week or so simply because one bulldog moved a building one foot. No disrespect to the bulldog, but Marmaduke is a f*cking menace.
What about Netflix pushing the animators to make a movie to fulfill peoples demands , we live in a reality where we want things instantly and good things take time, we can not force a baby to born at 3 moths , neither to bake a cake in 6 min, forcing an author musician to create before the inspiration gets them. I feel bad for the people who made the movies  are just doing what they been asked to do :/
That's not a good transition.
“This cartoon dog just really screams Pete Davidson!”
Congratulations on getting number 2 on trending
My little brother(8) actually watched this and I was in there from the tsunami to him eating out the banquet and them during the eating montages we all just kinda- got up and left
hey danny, why come your hairs is white?
Yall remember the original Marmaduke tho😌nothing can top the 2010 one
Wasn’t Marmaduke already an existing property
I’m convinced the engorged belly and fart sequences were animated by fetishists.
Danny looks weird in the thumbnail...
god this movie is so ugly
next Danny should review the live action Marmaduke movie from 2010. I loved it as a kid but rotten tomatoes gave it a 9% >:(
Guy sensei
Hey you were born on Earth? I was born on mars and I also hate it. The nightmares will never stop.
Everything after 17:22 is so unhinged
I stopped watching Netflix a   while ago
In 2011 my family adopted a Great Dane who we decided to name duke, and after watching this movie I'm scared of the similarities this movie has to what happened after we adopted Duke. Duke actually caused all the power in our neighbourhood to go out due to causing a tidal wave after diving into our pool, and our neighbourhood had to go into lockdown because of the sheer power and toxicity from his farts and shits.
I watched this movie in Spanish and it was our final.. let’s just say I wish we had an actual test instead of watching this
I guarantee you this: more people are gonna watch Danny’s video talking about this movie than there are people who actually watched this movie or even knew it existed
Karma crap is what they should call it
This movie looks like a GameCube game
The fart scene felt like a sc*t fet!$h thing...
I didn't know Pete Davidson sound like such a...loser
FINALLY A NEW VID FROM MY BOY DREW
they could have given pete davidson three years to write the ending song and it would have been the same low-effort crap pete davidson always churns out.
I did not think they could do worse than the live action Marmaduke. I was mistaken.
Completely honest I literally said ew 3 times when I saw the humans
2:18 "The Addams Family Animated Movie"
"our dog is a loser" it's a dog, did you expect it to send cars into space like Elon Musk and solve Rubik's cubes with it's nipples?
damby gombalez
i know weve all had concerns about dannys intellegence since that recent video about bad mobile games...... but hearing him say "all of the sudden" was the final nail of the coffin. ✊✊danny gonzales doing the work by acting as a personified indictment of the us school system
yes. yes they are.
"You...not so great Dane" 😂
i can’t believe they wasted a movie about a talking dog voiced by pete davidson on this.
subscribed with notifs on please i just want to be greg danny PLEASE god
PLEASEEEEE watch the live action version of marmaduke
i gotta ask again when connected to the VPN there is a higher ping lower download speed and lower upload which is all worse than when not being connected is there something I'm missing
The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.  Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby. Strategy Offensive  He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a "Hog Rider Rush", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, Giant Bombs, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, deploy them in front of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most value out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base. Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps. Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time. Defensive  Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders. Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses. You can place Spring Traps and Giant Bombs in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps and Giant Bombs can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush. Hog Riders can be easily killed using "forced pathing". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time. Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders. In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings. Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them. Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants. Upgrade Differences The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands. At level 3, his hammer increases in size and turns black. The brass bands on the hammer's head disappear, and the hammerhead goes further down onto the stick, creating a button looking object on the top of the hammerhead. At level 5, his mohawk turns from black to orange, making it similar to that of a level 5 Goblin. At level 6, his hammer gains three large, golden spikes and a bronze plating. At level 7, the edges of his hammer start to glow red, and he gains a brown headband but reverts to a black mohawk. At level 8, his hammer is now mostly golden. His hog also gains a headband. At level 9, the gold on his hammer is much thicker. His headband also lightens in color. At level 10, his hammer turns a bright light blue color that resembles the look of ice. This matches the theme of Town Hall 13. It also gains a small same-colored glow. At level 11, his hammer turns a light greenish color. This matches the theme of Town Hall 14. His hog gains gold armour on its face and muzzle.
Why does it somehow feel like the same plot as the emoji movie?
Danny I have a suggestion for a video, if you didn’t already, you should react to tall girl 2 I watched it and it has a kinda silly plot 😕
OMGGG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR U TO TALK ABOUT MARMALADE I COULDNT LAST 20 MINUTES IN IT-
i think marmaduke decided to get trained so he could learn to kill
this is a fetish movie
This is an totally random comment but Danny I want you to know that your music is so upbeat and funny and it made me stop crying when I was balling my eyes out. It helped me a lot.
"rich British man" ...... George not found-
Danny, I think I should report you. Like this movie is a hate crime. I hated it.
To make it even worse... this is technically a weird reboot.
I hope Pete got paid more than enough for this role 💀😂😂
lmao this isnt a netflix production(and neither is that weird pinnochio), they just have exclusive rights to distribute in a streaming platform. you guys can't even do a 5 minute search
bro i wish they didn't ruin one of my favorite childhood movies
no no no listen to me rn Marmaduke was this movie in the early 2010’s?? maybe? bur i watched it as a kid and it was live action and CGI. this is awful idk why they ever rebooted it
Danny, whose jawline did you steal for that thumbnail
Charlie(moist critical) made the same ai analogy
If you want to watch a bad movie watch zombies 3 🤡
cant wait for the danny memes of him on his hands n knees pretending to be a dog
i kinda liked being under the desk at the end...thanks
Bro who wrote this movie like why💀💀💀💀💀💀
ppl watch bc its bad lol money
now you have to review the non-animated movie danny!!!!
19:50 does he know what this does to us? <3
Had to watch this while babysitting and it physically hurt to not make fun of it in front of the kid
I recommend you go watch Top Gun Maverick to help you rid your mind of Netflix’s rotting garbage
Are you sure that Guy isn’t the villain? He literally just beats the shit out of this dog, not for discipline, but just to beat the shit out of him. After FAILING to train this dog, he bills the family far more than the dog competition would’ve paid, at least 3 million, this Guy tried to literally bankrupt a family after beating the shit out of their dog. He’s the real villain, not the ugly dog.
Your hair is getting more and more wild by the video...i approve
Danny’s talking about the dad as if he doesn’t look just like him ( ur the best, Danny!)
The thing that's going under everybody's radar is that this movie is an animated version of the 70 year old Marmaduke cartoon strip AND there was also a live action version in 2010, which is also terrible
I sadly had to watch this because of my 5yr cousin
Mantapp
I SAW THIS LAST NIGHT AND I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU OR KURTIS MAKING A COMMENTARY ON IT
This whole movie is the only argument kanye needs
I Can't even begin to fathom just how much force the bulldog put into lifting the entire convention, this includes: seats, tables, people, god knows how much water (seriously water is heavy when contained in one place), and a shit ton of metal, like I'd assume the amount of force it would take is beyond 10M+ newtons, and remember he's also tanking said force in his teeth, yeah no shit Marmaduke and the others are outclassed
I will say the heart detail in the dogs tail is pretty cute
Finally a dog movie written by dogs for dogs
A mini?
Its legal to sell your personal browsing data because of Trump, and Ajit Pai....  Trump worked to empower those who could remove net neutrality, because he and other republicans were being lobbied hundreds of millions.  So they made the move remove privacy rights in the internet
This is worse than I ever imagined. I can sense all the inappropriate boners from the gross scenes.
looks like the weird kid animation on youtube,it's just bad,only kid will have a good time watching this weird syit
Im not seeing anyone here mentioning that there was a live action Marmaduke movie with Owen Wilson that came out years ago and is not quite as bad, but still not great either. I would like to see Danny react to the OG one, he probably would get a kick out of it, though I dont remember it being as cartoony with its stunts like green fart bombs and glitter dogs.
ok.
I will ignore all the negatives of this film and focus on the absolute THICKNESS of the mom character's thighs.  Dumptruck? Nah, that's the whole LANDFILL BABY.
These animators, jesus christ. Should be locked away on an island and never let near another animation studio. This is what they decided to put out into the world and they felt proud enough with THAT. NAh lock em up. Don't feel bad for them at all. The writers as well, jail them. Throw away the key.
He caused fartnobyl
At 18:12 that dog looks like he might go full on dumbo and flap away with those floppy ears lol
I would like to point out that this isn’t even an original idea from Netflix, Marmaduke was live action movie YEARS ago   P.S. Love the “Greg” couch Danny✨
I swear when I saw the thumbnail I thought that was a screenshot of a GrubHub ad
#2 ON TRENDING!!!
looking for a comment saying how the dad looks like danny but i can’t so i’m making me myself
Honestly the show dog industry is known for being pretty shitty to dogs but i seriously doubt THATS what this movie is trying to say
danny my little sister and all her friends watched this movie and thought it was so funny and they love it. i can’t understand how.
If you like this comment you join the effort to force Danny to make Marmaduke's score a positive one.
My German teacher thought this was the greatest movie of all time and made us watch this. This is the worst movie I’ve ever watched.
I literally asked you to make this video thank you 😭😭🙏🙏
marmaduke is an older movie from 2010 they made it so much worse by making it animated 😭💀
Why are the cheerleader bullies black
Thanks, Danny 😊
Requesting a video with Danny’s dog
That's Not Guy! It's Justin Chad
100% Wolf on Hulu.
YouTube unsubscribed me!!!! I have fixed this issue, but I now realized why I hadn’t seen your content in the past 6 months.
Yah this movie is bad AF
.    but also good video 👍
But I like being under your desk
9:15 right when you said that my dog farted :/
My little siblings tried to get me to watch this they are the only ones who like this movie😭
i found your son, how far do you live from pa on a scale of in to somewhere else
Just want to point out there's already a non animated film named marmaduke made in 2010, kinda feels like this is the worse version of that movie
Marmaduke was originally a old newspaper comic, so there's your first problem: Nextflix ran out of ideas to the point they're using something that no body alive remembers.  So short answer of why all their movies are bad: they keep trying to make remakes/reinterpretations of old properties instead of making new ones. Seriously, get someone to pitch something new instead of trying to ride on the glory of something past its prime.
I feel SO bad for these Netflix animators. They really deserve so much more. It’s obvious that they’re been trying to work as hard as they can, but not every decision is theirs. At the very least, they deserve more recognition, respect and praise. I just hope they can work at better studios in the near future!
wanna see Danny react to the live action Marmaduke after seeing this
the movie looks like ew
It's easier to make the majority of people agree that you suck by making bad content, instead of trying to please the minority by making good content because art is subjective.
You look like the guy in the thumbnail
At least they made up for it by releasing Sea Beast a few days ago cause that movie was absolutely stunning 😭
You have to be the worst critic ever. You and that movie fit together in such a superboring way. Both at the really bad on the entertainment scale.
Did you legit punch a hole into the wall? Like is your hand good?
I SWEAR TO GOD IS THIS WHAT THEY REMOVED CORPSE BRIDE FOR 😭😭
I used to love the original marmaduke when i was a kid
This movie is so ugly
Nice #2 oñ treading
8:20 Zeus looks like someone commissioned a furry to draw Saruman Edit: 16:20 oh my god he IS dog Saruman
Honestly for a couple seconds I thought Danny actually broke the wall
Wait what? Where have i seen this plot before??
I'm genuinely concerned about how the having is going to pay for Marmaduke's training if he didn't win lol
i swear there was a marmaduke movie before this, and if there was i remember a better movie. might've just been a normal generic dog movie with a name on it.
Classic money laundering. Nothing new. 💰
0:08 ahaha   new?
Nah but I remember watching the original Marmaduke in cinemas when I was little and even as a kid I hated it 😭😭😭😭
7:49 Marmaduke's ear glitches through the blinds
sounds like my dog
Wait but the original marmaduke is so good
17:24 Marmaduke up, daddy!
You should review birds like us I mean look at the birds
i can’t believe pete agreed to this 😭
My cousin thought you were 13 Yeah
there is a live action version of this movie, and i used to love it so much as a kid. idk why they would remake it
i saw the live action movie at the cinema when it came out and i lost my favourite teddy and ever since i have refused to watch anything to do with marmaduke
Danny, I hate to break it to you, but kids have watched this movie. Both the kids my mom babysits have witnessed this disaster.
This is an insult to the original
what happened to the thumbnail
That cartoon moms back is broken
I laughed the entire way through
Skeet is terrible
Danny i love your videos so much when you post im like YES DAY IS AUTOMATICALLY BETTER and like when it gets to the ad read im not even ready to finish the video i watch the whole fkn ad read which i NEVER do. Danny u are my favourite youtuber thank u for existing youre so funny.
If I had to guess, I'd say the trainer is speaking English, but understands the barks coming out of Marmaduke. So from a third person perspective, it'd sound like a human speaking to a dog and the dog barking back in rhythm with the conversation
My little brother asked my parents if he could watch this movie. They of course agreed, and when he first saw the trainer, my little brother thought he was a praying mantis 💀 We now call the trainer mantis man
Yes
Hate to tell you this Danny, but I babysat a preschooler recently and this is the movie they demanded we watch first. They had already seen it.
😭😭😭🙃🤣
That mom though 🤤
WORST YOUTUBER
they always remove / cancel the actually good shows for shitty movies. truly an epidemic.
Didn't they do a Marmaduke movie in like 2009 with Owen Wilson as Marmaduke? Who decided we needed another one?
Ok but the live action marmaduke is actually good tho.
Let me tell you when I say my 6 year old sister has seen this. She for some reason loves this stupid movie. She acted INSANE when I asked her if she had seen this movie. She kept trying to peek over my shoulder when watching this video.
What the fuck
Lol Marmaduke
It was probably part of his contract with Netflix, that to get his standup special, he also had to make a certain number of films with them (like Tom hiddleston’s multi movie contract was the reason he was in that awful Kong movie that doesn’t at all suit the kinds of films he normally chooses) and agreeing to do some quick shitty voice work for a quick shitty cartoon was easier than committing to a proper film.
this video was as bad as the movie
You forgot the question mark at the end of the title
they did marmaduke so dirty, the older movie was so much better that or i am remembering through a veil of childhood memories
isn't this just an animated version of the movie with the same name that used a real dog 💀
do you ever watch these shows with laura?
i really shouldn't have watched this while eating. on another note, is this really madd by netflix? wouldn't be surprised if this was made by one of those animators that created the ratatouille or bee movie knock offs.
Doesn't look that bad
So there was another Marmaduke movie that came out in 2009 that’s leagues above this movie (I don’t know if that says a lot but I really loved it as a kid and haven’t watched it since) so if you want to watch a movie that’ll slightly be better, watch Marmaduke (2009)
Why does Danny in the thumbnail look so strange
10:27 marmaduke becomes German
If Marmaduke had actually died, this would've been the only time a dog dying in movie wouldn't have been really sad XD
I remember being at my grandparents house earlier this year with my cousins and this was playing on the TV. It was just terrible, during the whole thing we were just making fun of it 💀
This has got to be some sort of money laundering scheme.
I feel like ive seen this title before 🤨 scott cramer made sumn kinda like this
Such an awful film, and you touched on a lot of the awfulness... but I think it's really worth mentioning the massive and incredibly lazy racism of the portrayals of the opposing dogs. Juan the chihuahua just exists for the sake of an exaggerated  Mexican accent and a few weird references. Zhi's magical combat sequence is probably the most interesting animation in this trash-fire, but it's still just an extremely lazy Asian martial arts trope. Zhi also repeatedly sort of acts as this Asian mystic deus ex machina, swooping in with some hackney vaguely philosophical quote that somehow rectifies the situation. Much like Juan, but far more prominent, that's Zhi's whole thing - just a fluffy pile of stereotypes. Those are the worst, being from still-marginalized ethnicities, but even the remaining dogs like the German Hansel devise their entire characters from incredibly lazy ethnic typing ("Hey, Hansel... better cut back on the strudel!"). The entire third act felt racist in like... a '90s way. Not that it would've been justified then, but even within the realm of lazy racism... it feels dated. Miserable film.
Dammit, Keaton Patti, making all the Netflix movies.
Anyone else realize that Guy looks like Elton John trying to be the Joker?
Unhealthy body standards ong
But could y’all imagine how good that fart/poop would’ve felt for Marmaduke? Like imagine being so bloated, you’re literally a bowling ball and then you release all that pressure. That would feel amazing.
Yes Danny. Also I saw you and Ted at that rainforest cafe!! Definitely a top ten anime moments
Yeah the Cesar Milan method is pretty much beating the shit outta your dog…so they aren’t pretty far off with the ‘famous dog trainer’ tactics 🤯😐🥺
Weirdest shit is the fuckin name. "Marmaduke"??!?? wtf.
We gotta get this to number 1
I remember the 2010 Marmaduke and it is a lot better than the animated one. I even remember that Burger King had a Marmaduke toy in the kids meal
Yes
is this supposed to be a remake of the live action marmaduke??
Nobody talking abt his shirt? Ok ig 😒
this is genuinely so terrible but kind of lovely in a way. like ya know how some books are just awful and mediocre? it’s because someone decided to publish it! and someone was able to be a writer!! and seeing terrible published books out there makes me feel better about my personal writing. sure its not the “biggest hit” lol but the fact that awful movies exist like this just kind of gives me hope that one day people who want to direct, or do voice acting etc will ALSO be able to make something and maybe, with a little luck, it will be better than this.
👀👀👀
i was eating dinner while watching this and had to stop because the animation was making me physically ill
this looks like a low budget movie made by a fuckin cocomelon twin
all the belly bulging/farting stuff HAS to be a fetish thing the writers snuck in... especially with the sound effects and facial expressions!! 🤢🤢
That dog song... Reminds me of the animated titanic knock off
My sister (6) heard me watching the video and asked "Is that Marmaduke?"  I replied "Yes" and asked if it was good. She nodded her head and said "really good!"   I am disappointed
Hi Im a greg.
5:26 Guy needs to stop training dogs and train himself on defensive driving smh
guy needs to be the next tumblr sexyman so this movie finally has something going for it (apart from it just being absolutely horrible)
sometimes I wonder, like it almost feels like the dave chapelle special right after cuties was a inside job
Why does the 2d animation in the end credits look better than the 3d animation in the movie
guy is drew goodens biggest fan 😂😂
Ok video. Very nostalgia critic.
Greg is actually the robot from how to build a better boy. We are the army and a singular person.
-6/10 😭😭😭 beyond accurate
I love the $947 in emotional support cost
I’m sorry but this movie sounds awesome actually
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
If you look up if GREG is the fastest growing army on youtube it says yes so congrats Danny!!!
the dog trainer was obviously a warlock, he literally summoned a mage hand. the magic was in front of you all along
My dog once pooped in my ex-girlfriend's shoe. None of it hit the floor. I thought it was hilarious.
CO-DIRECTED BY PHIL NIBBELINK?? THE "ROMEO AND JULIET BUT WITH SEALS" GUY???
I'm starting to think we need to go back to the early 90s to prevent Toy Story from getting made so CGi movies never go down this path. /j
I love how serious Danny is in this report. I mean, I’m with ya. Marmaduke kinda does lack many of the supernatural qualities the other dogs exhibited.  I love ya Danny. Always makin my day brighter!
Haven’t you heard of the dog whisperer? (who is a total jerk by the way, if you don’t know, look up illuminaughti’s video) Guy is a dog whisperer. They can speak dog, Danny! They are absolutely talking in barks.
I think they're trying to make this to cater to people with bad fetishes, and to give people bad fetishes. I don't even want to mention how many other movies netflix seems to do this in...
Ngl I got a Pete ad for this
“It makes me very uncomfortable how aroused the humans are by this dog”  So it’s an accurate representation of dog shows. Got it.
19:56 POV: you're sucking Danny
2001 cgi in 2022
Kanye is gonna star in an animated movie now just to fuck with Skete
They barely even followed the comic-
this reminds me that I grew up watching the live action 2010 marmaduke movie which I remember being decent tho I might have to go back and watch to see if thats still true
I always look forward to Danny's Videos. He's hilarious 🤣🤣
No fucking way they ruined Marmaduke. I remember watching the live action when I was younger.
O
Netflix’s plan is working. Because of how bad it is, now people are going to watch it to criticize it, giving them money
My science teacher forced us to watch it when it first came out
Dog with snorkel? 10/10.
Loved the live action marmaduke as a kid, but girl what is THIS
A new generation of marketing execs have risen to power that are purposfully trying to create movies based around their meme potential rather than actual quality. I'm reminded of the romance movie that KFC made for instance. I also suspect that the first Sonic movie may have been going for this but they chickened out. I guess they think that it doesn't matter if the film is good as long as it goes viral because any press is good press, just ask Sony with Morbius!
There is one redeeming quality. Guy is hot.
is this a remake of that live action one??
WHY IS THE TRAINER DRESSED LIKE AUSTIN POWERS
marmadoop💗
the funniest things about this video:  - danny implying that hypnosis is a solely magical thing that doesn’t actually exist  - the ad read being under the table   - the little dance to the pete davidson song
but Marmaduke is a good show what are you talking about
i think that its the law in cartoons that the law has to be rich and british -danny gonzales 2022
The animation is that not that bad yall are reaching
The animation is somehow even worse than Ratatoing 💀💀💀
The original comic strip is bad, but also uncomfortable. It is implied that the mom is cheating on her husband... with Marmaduke 😬
Literally watched that movie in my Spanish class
Blew up on corridor
nose to arm ratio 💀
How many subs can I get?😳
I thought I was tripping. Netflix, Amazon, AMC, Hulu. They all suck.
chernobyl moment
I just watch Netflix for KDramas and anime 😂
The dad: sees a nuclear war starting Also the dad: Dammit what is with that dog??? Always starting shit.
Everything is junk today
the og marmaduke was so good when i was younger, this remake hurt my soul
what did they do to my boy marmaduke? 😭
I think they are, at least 25% of em gotta be intentionally bad!!!
As an animator, this hurts to watch. there’s nothing wrong with the animation, it’s just the poor performances and overall lack of passion in this movie
#2 on trending!! Congrats 👏🏼
Bro seeing him with like 2 strands of grey hair makes me feel old
Who else searched marmaduke on Netflix?
Marmaduke was a film made in 2010 it was live action and now they’ve made an animated version. growing up, i watched marmaduke 24/7 i love the movie so so much and now seeing that there is a new one and it being bad, not living up to my childhood wants on the first one is honestly upsetting. this movie wasn’t very know or at least whenever i talked about it as a kid no one knew it which upset me but whatever. it’s dumb to write a paragraph about a movie but i have such an emotional attachment to this stupid kids movie it’s insane
My cousin and I stayed up late and we were finding a movie to watch and she was like “oh let’s watch marmaduke! It’s awesome! You haven’t seen it? Omg we have to watch it” and I said it looks boring and we watched for five minutes, then I stole the remote and changed it.
The Marmaduke Rap Written by Phil Nibbelink and Kaden Dippé  Not Pete Davidson.
They must of put the entire budget into that one shot of the bulldogs paw
8:03 and 17:23 danny is a furry?!?
The dad looks like Neil Cicierega 😍
this feels like a fetish movie 😬
Watch the live action one made in the early 2000's it was my childhood movie
“And thank you all for watching this video.  Now Please get out from under my desk.”
He so adorable not the movie is u
On the plus side there's "The Sea Beast", which is basically if you mashed together Treasure Planet and How to Train Your Dragon together. Great stuff worth a look.
This movie doesn’t look fully rendered
Facts
2:20 that animation man. Is this 2002
I would have put that dog down within the first 5 min.
hi gregstie          (besties in greg)
that should be "-6/ ±10"
Bruh this is a shame to the Marmaduke name the 2010 live-action Marmaduke was much better it was acc my favorite movie growing up im so dissapointed
cool
Marmaduke is a remake. The original was pretty bad too, I don't know why that movie was chosen for a remake.
4:15 "my dog stepped on a bee"
Keep in mind, season 2 of the society got canceled, but this got greenlit
I was born in 2078 and on Keplar 22B!
hello its your favorite youtube friend when u going live?
so is nobody gonna talk bout the end?
Wait, does Danny just not know about the Marmaduke comic strip?
Why are movie studios making great movies on purpose* There so bad there good
this is what they cancelled wings of fire for. I feel so bad for the animators
ngl guy has style i mean look at those fits man
I always thought he was drinking a glass of milk in the portrait on the wall, after years of watching his videos I realized what it really is
this was dumber than the wilbobhys or however tf u spell it another originally animated movie on netflix make sure to watch it
This animation sucks
Me: heh, worst film this year hey? I dunno I’ve seen some pretty awful stuff.  Me but 21 minutes later:…I would like to retract my statement please…
the movie kinda reminded me the style of the ‘Despicable Me’ movies 🤨
This is actually based off of a comic strip
I dont think i would ever see a movie with worse character designs then the adams family remake trash but here we are
The art in the credits was more appealing than any of the design choices in the entire movie. those poor animators
Damn. The og marmaduke was so good
You’re laughing. That bulldog has killed four people and you’re laughing. Give him a good medal!
Even as a kid, I remember just hating movies where the whole joke was "horrible untrained dog causes endless misery." It's so irritating and they always play it like the dad or parents are the bad guys for getting fed up with being injured and having their property destroyed, instead of a single person training the dog.
They removed all the grinch movies in like 2020 two weeks before Christmas
itss meeeeeeeeee 😉
The production value of this show has dropped. When he punched the wall, he used CGI to fix it after and the wall looked normal.
They not only produce bad movies but I love how they have now 4 Robert the doll movies, Utah cabin murders and etc. all of these movies have less then 20% on rotten not to mention the ACTORS ARE THE SAME
Hi Dannyyyyyyyyyyyyy i LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuUuuuuuuuUUUuUuUUUuuuUUUuUUU😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
99% of the money for this movie was for the moms plastic surgery
ZAMN! The mom be kinda bad tho🤑 would 10/10 cuck the soy father lol
They missed the opportunity to call him Marmadookie.
I feel bad for Pete ngl
bad movies receive press, people make memes about it, it causes people to be aware of it and that causes people to watch it “ironically” which gives the studio money, it is 100% on purpose because all press is good press 😂
The original marmaduke is great tho
The guy in the thumbnail looks like you
It's pretty simple. Netflix is using their internal data to generate movies that are essentially guaranteed return on investment for them. these are movies they know will get watched by a certain amount of people who are subscribed and will generate a known amount of new subscriptions. as for who is watching, its kids. or more accurately, its parents putting on netflix kids, which has these trash movies. And the production is so bad because netflix has a very specific target they need to hit to make it a "non-risk" investment. Then they can turn around and show investors how they cranked out some dog shit direct to DVD quality crap and made X amount of dollars back. That's also why the casting is bottom of the barrel along with animation and all other aspects of production.   They are making money, not a movie.
I actually watched this movie during English class and when I tell you I was traumatized I was actually quite traumatized, the movie made no sense and was overall weird and just kinda scary lol. I've never seen anyone talk about it so this video was definitely something to enjoy.
Lol have you seen the Resident Evil one? Oh my loorrrrd.
3:46 wet…. spaghetti…??
if i were asked the last person on earth that I wanted to hear voice acting it would be pete davidson
The Marmaduke I loved as a kid was nothing like this abomination.  That's all.
I like how Guy is supposed to be English when it's a French name and it's really fucking confusing in the English language to just address somebody as "guy" Like, how many other names are there in the universe that you could've called a rich British guy? Cornelius? William? Greg? and you had to pick Guy?
im gonna edit this movie to where marmaduke dies and then the credits roll
Is it just me or dose Zeus kinda sounds like cave Johnson
Answer: Yes
and here i thought drew was always greeting me whenever he said hey guy. but no 4:54
I love how the mom and dad have bodies like Kim and Pete…..
Subbed and notifications baby
That is the movie my brother is watching-
POV your an egg
HES VOICED BY PETE DAVIDSON????
I don’t know who that is in the thumbnail, but that is NOT Danny!!!!
Can we just appreciate how hard work he puts in for each of his videos for us....🤗.....
tbh movies just keep being remade. it feels like there’s no originality anymore :(
This looks almost worse than freddy frogface
Please stop cussing so we can watch with our parents thanks!
seems like this is a fetish
If anyone is looking for a good movie, check out Brian and Charles! If you like funny mockumentaries about loneliness, love, and robots set in the Welsh countryside, you'll like this.
Marmaduke created another Chernobyl incident and all he is “Not so Great Dane” he should be a war criminal shepherd
Danny needs to watch The Queen's Corgi. I actually enjoyed it, but oh, so many people didn't. 😂
I need to go take a marmaduke.
Ngl but the dawg just makes the movie a little cringey 😐
Netflix really cancelled the Bone series but went thru with THIS.
This movie looks terrible. Not just in the story sense, but physically just seeing the clips on this video, I think my eyes would start bleeding
drew, stop making videos about tv
My dad put this on for my 7 year old sister and I came out of my room and I was like 'wtf are you watching' it was traumatic
PMS- Pixar Mom Syndrome
I feel similarly about Abbi Jacobson's voice acting. She's funny, just not when she's animated.
OMG I SUGGESTED THIS MOVIW TO YOU
I just noticed the Greg pillows in the back, love them!
Danny: Hands of this-  *pause* Paws of this dog
Dude just farted and expunged like 40kg
i wonder if marmaduke and gooby would get along
I genuinely thought this was a dub to begin with
The first Marmaduke movie is so much better. I use to watch it on my DVD player every week because I only had barbie movies and Marmaduke. Sad to see them ruin such a legend :,(
The most amazing thing here is, that Danny.... DANNY thinks Pete Davison is funny.
I think the strategy is to lover our exception of a "good" movie. So when mediocre movie come out it will be epic!😂
Youtube used to be about good content up until 2017 when the adpocolypse and the viner invasion happened and then it became about "who can exploit the views of children the fastest" Video games used to be about playability and quality until mobile games took over the world and shitty mobile games I've never even heard of with the shelf life of like 2 months, if that, are making more money than the Avengers franchise. This movie is just another example of how everything good dies when money is added to it. Remember how good YouTube was in 2016? Maybe I'm just old. I was 10 when I signed up for YouTube in 2013 and I just watched TobyGames every minute of every day it was great, now he gets like 10k views a video while Cocomelon is making Disney numbers on a daily basis.
I SAW THIS AND I KNEW YOUD DO THIS YES IM SO EXCITED.
I remember watching this in class and nobody liking it
This is actually my favorite kind of terrible movie, the kind that brings up countless existential world building questions that it has absolutely no interest in answering. Like, the only thing I can come up with for why the trainer can understand the dog is there must just be people in this world with the inherent ability to speak to animals, and it's just a well known, implied fact about this world. I also can only assume that dogs are the only ones capable of performing various types of magic, since that's what was being shown off for dogs specifically. And like, those two facts together actually make for a very VERY interesting setting that just will never get explored
The major thing I hate about this is that, from this video, it doesn't seem like any character in the movie expresses the fact "training" Marmaduke through violent and opressive ways is wrong, it's almost like it's promoting it >:(
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAGSHSGAHAAGAHAAGAHAAAAA
Why, this is so true Netflix for kids has the most weirdest movies
I really wanted you to talk about how terrible the animation is. Like the art is bad but the way its animated is just atrocious. You could tell where animation cycles ended and restarted, I havent seen it this bad since Foodfight...
My brain will not accept the fact that this is an actual movie that exists. I'm seeing these clips and the whole time I'm just thinking to myself, "There is no way this is on Netflix. I literally do not believe you."
Yesss, I love the movie videos! When I saw the dog die (and the farting) I immediately said "Are they TRYING to make bad movies??" So I think you are correct
Seeing the news about this movie made me so upset but..and I rarely ever say this but-- The original was way better than whatever acid trip this is
Making an animated movie out of one of the oldest and worst Sunday comic strips in existence in 2022 is...a choice. Also, the rapping dog in the animated Titanic movie was better than that credit song.
The commics is bad but probably better then the movie
Make a video on the original 2010 Marmaduke featuring Owen Wilson please! I don't remember much about it but it has 0.1 lower score on IMDB than this one.
Not a single pyrocynical joke?? Not one?
The original Marmaduke was really good, but I saw this on Netflix and I wanted to vomit lmao
As someone who competes in dog sports, it’s NOT THAT LUCRATIVE
You make every shit movie infinitely better
based on art style alone im convinced marmaduke and fanboy and chum chum are in the same universe
one of th writers said "scooby-poo" and they wrote this whole script for that joke.
love the greg pillows
Help
will we never be free of the fart jokes in animated movies?
Pete Davidson has got to be one of the laziest motherfuckers I have ever seen. I have never seen any of Pete’s work and actually gone “wow, this look like it took forever to plan, he must’ve worked so hard on it”
At least Danny has great dance moves.
nice shirt
Wasn't this dog from newspaper comics??
3D animation can be so cheap and easy to get into now with all of the tools available, and even the garbage has proven time and time again that it can still sell like hotcakes. The same principle applies to live action too, so we aren't going to see any shortage of shovelware (or whatever the equivalent term would be for films) on the market anytime soon. But In the case of real passion projects, almost all of them aren't given enough time or funding from Netflix. I feel bad for all of the creators and animators of such projects that figured getting picked up by Netflix could've been their big ticket.
The art style actually makes me angry
Irrelevant thought but, isn't the strong dog a pitbull not a bulldog?   (This says a lot about my priorities)
I'm surprised no one has talked about how ExpressVPN has been exposed for mining crypto on people's computers- I know Danny and other YouTubers need sponsorships but I think this is something really important for people to know before signing up with them
10:40 I’m really thinking there are people with a severe fart fetish forcing it into kid’s media.
Exactly what I said about the mom thing
I feel like minus six out of ten is somewhat generous even.
Why do they make this crap and then don’t renew bojack horseman for season 7
the gun skit at the end had me laughing hard lmaooo
Oh shit the rapping dog from the cartoon "Titanic: the legend goes on" is back
THE ORIGINAL MARMADUKE IS GOOD
Is it supposed to be based off of the 2010 live action Marmaduke? You should honestly review that too.
Why did they call him Marmaduke? This has nothing to do with the old cartoon so why did they use that name? All right because it’s 2022 and instead of making actually decent movies they make sequels and interpretations that have absolutely nothing to do with the original work. Fuck anyone who worked on this project! From the CEOs at Netflix down to the tiniest animators!
Old Marmaduke movies were decent 😭
Marmaduke was a live action in like the early 2010's and that was actually a cute movie but they should have never re-done it
Marmaduke was the reason why Chernobyl happened. No fart could be as toxic as Chernobyl.
This movie looks like inide scandinavian 3D animated movies, but with no excuse for budget or having any actual charm or humor
why did 12:20 actually horrify me
The cgi of this movie looks worse than cgi that I watched in the mid 2000’s
I wonder if they ever had an agreement to pay before working with the trainer. Cause he can't bill for services he never said they would be charged for.
this is just scary..  Edit: the movie , the movie is scary , not danny.
my brother watches marmaduke and i wanna punch him in the mouth sometimes
Netflix seriously goes out and makes an incredible series like Bojack and then just... this?
Pete Davidson left SNL for this?
Live action marmaduke solos
I forgot that JK Simmons voiced the ugly blonde dog. That was wild.
The movie is so incredibly disgusting and ugly it should be considered an art piece
I was having such a shit day . This video just made feel so much better
The animation in this movie gave me a stroke
Ive watched this movie more than 10 times due to my younger siblings not knowing how bad marmaduke is.
this is the funniest video i have ever seen i at Greg now fr fr
You look mad in the thumbnail
I cant believe what they did to the original movie it was so good but now this exists
Petition for drew to steal this exact video just to replace the line “it’s Drew’s favorite character” with “its my favorite character”
I watched that movie a month ago😭😭😭😭
I feel like the fart scene is gross to me not only because it i visually gross, but this sounds a little bit like a fetish to me, look a his fucking face when he's shitting in the trophy, do y'all remember that fart fairy episode on that show? That gave me kind of that vibes 😷😷😷🤢🤢🤢 gross
Danny I found ur channel abt a month ago and I love ur humor! I don’t wanna sound like s desperate 5 year old but yk I jus like wanna tell u how much u have made me laugh  - a loyal greg
Owen Wilson Marmaduke is better
Shitty movies get memed to all hell. Maybe it earns them money somehow?
Danny’s face looks photoshopped onto itself on the thumbnail
The only good movie on there is Shrek the Musical. The new stuff like stranger things is so garbage.
the dog song at the end reminds me of the dog singing in the titanic animated movie u did a video on😭
I understand this is a bad movie but its not the worst like you said it was Why are everyone making fun of the owners of the dog should they not make fun of how the trainer failed, the family was not responsible for what happened and how do all of them know its they're dog they did not entered in to the competition the trainer did?  Did the dog seriously ran around the world in minutes   He clearly performed not just run around, the Bulldog is clearly the winner
21:14 no.
Nice, inspiration from Scott cramer
"loves to eat yet suffers greatly" mood
I regret watching this while eating holy shit
The thumbnail made the dog look pregnant and giving birth in a human way so I thought this movie was going to be about struggles from a pregnant dog or something     Oh wait..
Farts? Food inflation? Hypnosis? I dunno guys, to me this feels like a writer planting a very specific fetish in a kids movie.
I'm only watched it because pete😐 this movie gave me the same feeling as kung fu panda(the rip off version) and other low budget animation.  The plot is eh😐 The quality is nah🌚
3:23 Roll credits
This movie is for kids I know you keep acknowledging that but I don't think you really get that it's FOR kids
"His name is guy; he's Drew Gooden's biggest fan..." 😂
Danny has just discovered the fact that a huge number of movies have always been made to basically launder money, and all the  producers, directors and actors know about it
Guy’s legs jump scared me actually
Danny why would you say something like that my dog is crying right now
what the dog doin
I thought this was gonna be about Resident Evil new netflix show
Netflix cancels good programs, funds trash (and/or forces their animators to make trash), and then wonders why Netflix subs are going down. It’s almost like if you rely on the subscription model to make money where popularity and quality don’t matter since they’ll be paying regardless, and instead of just advertising the things you have so ppl know programs exist and watch it, ppl won’t want to buy.
3:40 the way the dog sits on the dad is nightmare fuel
the cat is SCARY
I worked for the company that produced marmaduke…they showed us the first preview of it years ago—around 2019. We were so confused by the animation and truthfully never thought it would actually be released 😭 to be fair, this movie was created by a studio and THEN pitched to streaming, of which Netflix picked it up.
Pete Davidson’s rap at the end has nothing on that dog from Titanic: The Legend Goes On
can you please do a movie review on mummy im a zombie? i think it will be one of the funniest reviews you have ever done. there are teens that look like they are 80!!!
This movie is so ugly
his last words wouldve been “oh no 🥸” as well 💀
I got some young cousins who watch marmaduke and I had to sit there and watch it until they (thankfully) had to leave like 3/4ths through  I’ll never forget what I’ve seen
Please tell me I’m not the only one freaking out about the way Danny looks in the thumbnail
I am a child and I have never heard of this movie also this is the absolute worst movie 🎥 ever!
There's a live action Marmaduke I watched at least 10 times as a kid
right now the likes are at 69k nice
Uhh-buh BYE
Hard rock nick has a tik tok
You should watch the live-action Marmaduke.
14:00 believe, I know it sounds like a gross cgi cat, buts it’s true!
It’s their fault for naming their dog marmaduke, it sounds like a type of Vegemite
Thank you
10:27 “the cloud from his fart gas like envelopes the entire crowd, people are screaming, I think he might have killed people actually,”

Is he not gonna mention that not only did the bull dog lift the building, but he lifted it while STANDING IN IT??
99% of big budget productions in the last several years are just money laundering schemes and you will never convince me otherwise.
12:21 i can't believe you punched a hole in your wall. we love the commitment to the bit.
Anyone else having issues figuring what's happening on screen? The way the characters are designed makes it so hard to understand what's happening, not to mention how quick the shots are
The characters look they they outta ratatoing
I like how fascinated Danny is with an animated bull dog that lifted an entire building
help me daniel
I feel bad for the children who get stuck watching this dog sh1t because their parents don't know any better because it looks almost as abysmal as the not-so-great Addams Family movie, that SOMEHOW got a theatrical release and a sequel.
Can we love you
I watched Marmaduke with a friend and it was no cap, bussin
Bruh my class watched this movie we were all on the floor laughing 😂
uhh, i think brooke houts already tried that method with her dog, didnt end very well.
Yayyyy  danny posted
I saw the Sea Beast (another Netflix animated film) the other day, and it was actually pretty good. They forgot to tie up a really big loose end, but other than that I thought it was decent.
This movie looks like it came out in the early 2000s. So if this is actually new I’m gonna cry
My first impressions of the first scene with the characters is I would think that's some sort of shitpost
Yah
Marmaduke be a superhero. Basically the flash.
The only live action movie we need, just remake the original please:( I mean last time I watched it I was 8 but it slapped
Let’s make a Petition so Danny can give movies a negative score
They took a fart/shit joke and multiplied by 10. Moms screaming at her daughter that their dogs a loser. Animals dying.
On some level this has to be money laundering
Every time I see you you look younger and I don’t really like it
So that's the guy Drew always say hi to in all of his videos
You the man
some super sayain level moves on a dog.  Imagine you go looking to learn to defend yourself just to get beat up.
Ayo wait wasn’t marmaduke a live action movie where the dog would talk? Like not that people could understand him but he would talk. Idk I’m sure I used to watch that movie as a kid also edit: sorry if he says this at some point in the video, I’m just an idiot lol
How about zombies 3
When I thought it was actually going to end with him dying right then and there I was bursting with laughter and I was so disappointed when he was still alive.
You should have seen what Netflix did to death note with that 2017 movie. Anime/manga live action movies should never be made by Netflix
I remember the original live action movie which is actually great, has a cute message and was like my fav movie when I was little. So someone tell me WHY did they DO THIS TO MARMADUKE?? WHAT THE ACTUAL FCK
Damnn that mom not only has no organs but the smallest skull and hoes her neck holding andything up. She’s all bottom no top. Scary 😭
You can’t convince me that this movie wasn’t made by someone with a secret DeviantArt account
Am I the only one who thinks Guy kinda looks like Tom Holland
I'm going to download Express VPN so I can connect to a country that doesn't have marmaduke for Netflix
Danny looks more like guy
Those characters look like grown up children from the Cocomalon itself
I don’t particularly like Pete but I feel bad they just took voice clips and pasted it into ts, but mean he’s dating a kardashian so I’m sure he’s on a different plain of existence rn.
No I don’t think so
Fun fact: this movie is actually based on another live action movie of the same name. I've seen the animated one, but I have no idea what the live action one is like, or if it has a remotely similar plot to the animated one. But one thing to note is that the live action version has a whopping 9% on rotten tomatoes, which means that people liked the reboot LESS than the original movie. Why they decided to animate a movie that was already terrible in the first place is beyond my understanding.  Also, everything from 8:57 - 10:35 is easily the worst part of this entire movie.
I feel like either this was made for hate watching or some rich kid who wants to be a movie producer has a dad who got him this connection or something lmao
Another bad Netflix movie is Pets United. I know its supposed to be a kids movie, but to me, the voice acting is an absolute trainwreck. Plus, its not really talked about that much.
I can't wait for the day Danny talks about Greg being one guy and photoshops 5.49 million people into one giant Power Ranger Greg.
0:50 “I’m my own entity I don’t have a boss saying I have to give it a positive score…  -6/10”  WHEEZE
Good video Drew
My 8 year old brother actually really liked this movie- I walked in on him watching it towards the talent show half and I did not know wtf to think.                           Its the most confusing thing to walk in on a dancing disco poodle.
I think it's time for danny to watch the live action movie Marmaduke now.
Marmaduke did it!
Danny gets hotter every new video. I wonder if we could graph this correlation.
Look at how they   massacred my boy 😭
Your funny af keep it up Danny
Tbh my dude needs to watch the "horror" movie Frogs. Honestly it's so funny how bad it is.
dude WHY does the mom have such a DUMPYYY
This reminds me of that concrete soccer ball chinese animation
Ur hair should have its own channel
is2g this was either made by one of pete's friends and he was trying to help out. otherwise he either agreed to do this despite how bad it is, OR, even WORSE.....he likes it.
If I had a dime for every time that Danny talked about a rapping dog in an animated kids movie, I would have two dimes. Which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice.
We watched this in my class room on a Friday one time and the class made up a song that goes “this Great Dane is causing me great pain” something like that
Danny took an L here. Marmaduke is the best movie
when they were about to square up you missed the chance to say, 'they put up their MarmaDUKES'
At 0:10-0:12 He sounds whiny but makes it hilarious 🤣. I enjoyed laughing at that.
i liked the video the second you said drew gooden
If art truly was subjective, this movie wouldn't be universally loathed.
this movie looks like a bootleg movie
Surly I am not the only man over 40 that enjoys this content
i love this video LMAO
That mom shape of horrific She can be placed in horror game  Same for that dad
My edible kicked in at the right time for sure. Dying 🤣
The Marmaduke show gives me knock offs like ratatoing and that bad make of kung fu panda. Also at least the Owen Wilson’s live action Marmaduke is way better
Am I the only one noticing the quality in movies like this decreasing? It looks like they're all low in budget and in response to it they're cranking out cheap cliche poor quality movies to regain a better budget it's obviously not working though. I've seen stuff on kids YouTube better quality then this.
sad thing is I kinda liked the live action marmaduke as a kid, although it wasn't the best at least it was better than this and had a way different plot.  also Idk man maybe guy saw marmaduke beat the shit out of his owner and came prepared. doesn't make it right but marmaduke isn't likeable enough for me to feel bad for him.
Oh NOW Danny knows what paws are and wants to be exactly correct about a creatures end of leg appendages.
so i see netflix fired the entire lighting department
The artstyle makes me want to vomit. How do you make characters that are even worse and less imaginative than Illumination
Dannyyyyyyyyyyy
Netflix hired Kanye to hold a gun to Pete’s head for this
The actual movie was really good. The cartoon one sucks.
another favorite thing about this movie is that JK Simmons plays the villain dog, for some reason
I can't believe Netflix ruined a classic comic strip series... oh wait... (lasagna noises intensify)
Why are movie studios doing bad live action series out of gaming ip's without acknowledging any source material and disregarding it and its fans.
Tbh I’d also beat the crap out of that dog
Whatch ice roads
why the dog trainer kinda… 😏
Idk if this is a hot take or what but i really dont find Pete Davidson funny at all. I dont dislike him, i just find him not entertaining, and considering that's his job...
The animation is giving Veggie Tells
This movie was nothing but an exscuse for everyone involved to get a paycheck and then never think about their time on this movie again, lest the shame consume them
This is like The Last Airbender of animated movies.
Yo heads up your Nord VPN link is broken (you kept the "and" glued to the url at the end there)
It looks like they animated this in Source Film Maker.
I challenge you, Danny, to write your own Marmaduke ending credit song. 🎼
drinking game: take a shot when marmaduke
I used to have an old dog and one time he pooped on top of a big rock, that was pretty funny I think
marmaduke must be the most effective living being of all time. He is able to digest that amount of food to the point that he doesn't even leave solid waste, in literally no time. And probably is a biological weapon
my little sister was watching this downstairs this morning and when I came downstairs she had like 15 minutes left. I think the show ruined the og Marmaduke for that I watched as a kid. she tried to convince me that the show was really good, but it is not and I only managed 15 minutes of it. Most Netflix animated shows suck, it's just my opinion.
Lazy movie work, start to finish
"When can I leave on my owhnn?~" -Pinocchio
The original marmaduke movie had Owen Wilson 👀
o m gee
hi
Nanny of a 6 year old here - kids watched it. and liked it. and it sucked. kids have horrible taste.
They really saw Addams Family and said "I know how we can make this worse"
odd thumbnail danny…
favorite part of the movie was when Marmaduke said “its marmaduking time” and totally marmaduked everyone.
Solution for Marmaduke: Put the bastard to sleep. Problem solved.
FATHER. WheN can I leave to be on my oWNnUuh
I love how everyone everywhere has been talking about this (bad films/shows in general) for SO long and they still haven’t done a single thing to improve or take the feedback constructively 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I was unfortunate enough to see my litter sister watching this and enjoying and the time i saw it was during the fucking "Marmaduke drops a hydrogen bomb of a shit in the trophy during the dog show." Scene.
But imagine north watching this and roasting the shit outta Pete😭
Once at my school it was wet weather (it’s where we go inside and so things if it’s raining heavily) and sometimes they play movies, not good ones though, and pretty much half of the kids there were watching marmaduke- I dodged a bullet by not walking in there it seems-
Zeus hypnotizing the crowd is just a ripoff of Hypnotoad in Futurama.
Wow…this is an ugly movie.
I didn't ask to see a fart humiliation furry porn thanks Danny
what happened to the good marmaduke (2010)?
My twin 4 year olds absolutely loves this movie, non stop laughs.   But yes I agree with everything you said in this video.
"5 hours ago" 3.9k comments  Greg is legion.
Yes. That’s the answer to the video.
LOL
Actually there was a real life movie called Marmaduke, which literally was my childhood. I’ve rewatched it recently, it was bad, but seeing this weird cartoon thing still hurts my inner child…
Marmaduke was good when Owen Wilson voiced him and it was live action.
“I got the woorld daseeeeee” 0:11
"Is Netflix Just Making Bad Movies On Purpose"? the easy answer is yes. the long answer is they have too many projects to have to make to be able to put love in to each one. the budget was so small and they were struggling to get more money to pay the animators to work longer. its just a simple fact of getting too big. and the fact that it doesnt even have to be good, to get kids to watch it, so their metrics are telling them these type of movies are successes :)
How did JK Simmons and Pete Davidson get on this
Showing animal abuse as an ideal in a cartoon doesn't really seems to be the best idea...
Danny is the only one that can make this movie humorous 💀 omg
Its the fact that they took a classic movie from my childhood and remade it like this!!
As someone with a Marmaduke-esque Great Dane (fawn coloration), I find this cartoon offensive.   (the original comic and the live action were so cute)
Oh My God it’s Guy!
You should watch the movie Buba Hotep - watched it the other day and feel like you’d have some interesting views on it. Great vid btw.
Praise God 🙏🙏
Honestly I was disappointed when he didn't actually die at the end. Most annoying dog to ever exist, in the most annoying movie to ever exist. Marmaduke dying would have been the only possible redeeming factor, and still only by a negative difference.
I hade to watch it at school
Pure lack of self awareness. It's always existed. They truly think this shit is good. Literally always been a thing.
Wait till you find about the marmaduke live action movie from 2010
i feel that this movie is in the same universe as woobledogs because the stupid limbs
This movie is so ugly I want to cry
imagine seeing this in theaters
this is an injustice to the live action version of marmaduke and a direct attack at george lopez and owen wilson
Ok it’s not a movie but if you want a GOOD Netflix show watch Arcane (animation: AMAZING, characters: LIKABLE + DEVELOPMENT, plot: ENTERTAINING
this is easily one of the movies of the year
When i saw the trailer i was sooo confused!
Okay but JK Simmons being in this movie was the biggest shocker to me.
Dude why is the hand animation at the credits better then the real movie
Netflix is just mid in general
The narration at the start 😭😭☠️
Zeus looks like the equivalent of Professor Snape from Harry Potter
This movie is about to be trending 🍿
I work with kids and one weekend we put this on because I remembered the human-actor version from my own childhood... We got to the noxious gas scene and the kids asked to change the movie so we watched Paddington 2 instead.
Please your commentary is making the movie a lil too enjoyable 😂
Gregs I’m still under Danny’s desk. At first I was staying under there to be a rebel, but now I’m stuck with no way of escaping Danny’s rage. Please help me, Greg Army
I was sadly forced to watch this movie by my cousin and I think Danny explained this movie better than the movie
The other day me and my friends decided to watch this movie for shits and giggles, but we had to stop like 25 minutes into it we just couldn’t handle it
The animation in this movie reminds me of the knock off “Up movie” probably the way they move but still it’s so weird
8:05
I prefer the 2010 live-action movie of Marmaduke. At least it tried.
Danny and his Carhartt Tshirt. I always knew he was a blue collar man
greg. greg? greg.
The movie looks like it was made by an alien that made the movie in only 2 weeks and he was high off shrooms
My siblings watched this movie and got mad at me when I insulted the character design
If the dog died that would be so depressing and funny. A dog is getting abused by his angry trainer just to go for a dog talent show and he accidentally farts in a trophy, killing hundreds of birds and causing everyone to hate him and his family, his family goes bankrupt and the dog deals with depression but at the talent show just when he thinks he’s about to win he gets crushed by a tower. That’s really depressing
In really happy you did another animated movie review!
7:53 i didn't know kurtis was in this ❤️❤️
The look of these models and the way they move make me feel sick. Its so ugly, i want to punch everything in this movie😭
i love daddy gonzalez
People make bad movies on purpose in order to make money, they put in less effort, spend less money, and they don't have to make as much in order to turn a profit. The profit enables them to make more low-effort crap.
You should react to zombies next
thanks for talking about this shitty ass movie
why is this movie like the china lore video
Tbh I thought this movie would be great from the trailer until I watched it and realized how bootleg it looked😂
I don’t think I’ve ever noticed before that your “Hello Greg” intro with the unblinking eye contact and almost robotic tone is kinda creepy 🤣
i’m convinced that they booked pete davidson for one singular hour of recording and then ran out of money for the rest of the movie. pete then completely forgot it even happened
I feel like Pete Davidson was just given the script cold read so he didn't even know he was a part of this movie, and they just took the audio and rolled with it
I don't recall Marmaduke being a bizarro Scooby-Doo. He was a pretty accurate Great Dane lol. We had one when I was a kid and she'd back up on to our laps with her front paws still on the floor because she desperately wanted to be a tiny lap dog. When our parents weren't around, my sister, grandma and I used to hold her leash together while we walked her. She chewed the brick fireplace. When the alarm went off one night and the cops came they asked if we had a dog and we said a Dane. They looked nervous and asked where she was. Turns out, hiding in the basement. When we gave her treats, especially liver, she'd wag her tail so hard if you were too close she'd whip you and leave a mark. That's what Marmaduke was like lol. The jokes were just how insane owning a Great Dane who had somewhat lax training is.
companies are trying to make memes, not movies imo
Dude this movie is just a poor ripoff of the live action weird movie called..Marmaduke lol
Why does Danny's face look wider than usual in this thumbnail
I turned on notifications. I’m now a sigma Greg
how tf did they get pete davidson on this garbage lmaooo
I know it's a cartoon but no dog is big enough to cause a tidal wave
6:16 did u just miss the opportunity to say putting their dukes up hahha 😭
Danny your old high school beat mine in the football state playoffs. I now hold that grudge against you and expect full compensation please and thank you
This looks like the grubhub commercials were made into a movie
Marmaduke looking like an emaciated scooby doo.
Comment for the algorithm! 🤟🙃
I'd say they thought Pete Davidsons likeability would just carry this thing.  But knowing he did this makes me like him a bit less
I’m pretty sure the writers logic behind the dog getting fat and then farting a lot to just shrink up again and then get fat once more was an overplay on the fact that dogs and cats are actually lactose intolerant. I’m assuming the joke was a line up for him eating all the pastries at the event; which could have had dairy in them. The problem is that most people don’t know dogs and cats are actually that lactose intolerant. It’s just not causally discussed and who would have thought so especially past their pup age. So when their body attempts to break down the sugars in milk. They don’t have the proper amount of enzymes which is lactase so that leaves their gutt biota to break down the sugars themselves so all the bacteria munching on the sugar causes an huge expel of gas which makes the individual feel boated as fuckkk and you gotta toot it out. I think they just wanted to make a funny scene that wasn’t your stereotypical the dog got distracted by a squirrel skit and landed somewhere along dog farts. I’m assuming the fact that their choice for the main characters species dawned on them halfway through the writing process and had to draw straws at what they could slap together to provide some form of plot because at the end of a day a dog that is confined within normal  basic dog shit is only met with a minimal range in joke potential like yeah he just physically assaults his trainer and harassed the town eating shit but he’s not gonna go and shoot laser berms out of his eyes to save the earth from an rouge asteroid so dog farts it is
I had thought JK Simmons was above things like this, but I guess he'll take any role if you pay him =/.
Zeus is giving the crowd acid
is the movie fucking fetish material?! idk seems like it. >:(
The craziest thing is, this movie isn’t original either. There was a movie with the same title a long ass time ago with a Great Dane and it wasn’t animated
The original marmaduke only had a like, 30%. WHY did they remake it but worse LMAO
the title isnt even a question
This looks good for a 2001 doller story movie
plese dany i wanr to feel your skin :sad:
I thought the appeal was that it’s just so bad you can’t look away. You won’t unsubscribe because then you can’t be part of the cringe fest. With that being said, I didn’t even get 10 mins into Marmaduke and I started watching it with the intention of laughing at it and finding it cringey. The pacing, animation and story were awful. It wasn’t even bad funny, like “The Room” or the video Buinquedo movies
🐶👎🏽: 🐶🦵: 🐶👍🏽
Their arms and legs look like dry spaghetti, it could break from a little pressure.
The first time I heard of the Marmaduke movie was when the reporter was featured on the tumblr blog “Lesser-Known Waifus”. Idk what kind of sign that is, but probably not a good one
who was like “let’s bring back marmaduke! … you know who would be perfect for that role? pete fucking davidson 😎” like dudes got the enthusiasm of garfield try him there if u want him to be some sunday comics quirky animal character LMAO
News story: DOG ABSOLUTELY SHARTS HIS PANTS AT LOCAL DOG SHOW, KILLS 31 CIVILIANS
I was born in 1980 I also hate these characters
i live in poland, i was in the cinema today, and they always play ads for other movies before the actual film and i swear to god, one of the ads i saw was FOR THIS EXACT MOVIE but like in polish. i'm concerned for local kids' sanity lmao
It’s put your dukes up, not deuces. Putting your deuces up just means you’re throwing up peace signs, not your fist.
There literally already was a Marmaduke movie like 10 years ago based on the comic or book or something so I really don’t see why they needed to make this one
Just me or the dad looks like danny 💀
This isnt Klaus level of anatomical exaggeration, this motherfucker is billion surpise toy level
danny im so sorry but children have seen this movie... i once went into my living room and my little brother was voluntarily watching this
not only does this look like garbage (literally some scenes were giving ratatoing energy with a slightly better budget), but it's continuing the long line of horrible reboots. Justice for the original Marmaduke, I never watched it but I'm positive it was leagues better than this
tysm for making videos danny i was having a terrible day and watching your video made me feel so much better sooooo much better!!!! tysm tysm <33333
i kept thinking why does the name marmaduke sound so familiar. turns out there was a live action marmaduke in 2010 with owen wilson as the voice for marmaduke and it only has 9% on rotten tomatoes, so it's just as bad as this one
Pls review spy kids 2, it suks
I think this movie is horrible because the conflict is retarded all because they didn’t take care of their dog then they blame the dog
looks like a rip of
Why on Earth did they want Pete Davidson to voice Marmaduke instead of an actual va?😭It doesn’t sound right
12:01 I love the idea that that dog park is like this Chernobyl wasteland now for the next couple of decades
Netflix has gotta be a front for laundering money. I cannot think of any other explanation for how something so god awful came to exist.
2:28 look at that mouth. MmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
okay BUT not every recent netflix animation has sucked, imo.  prime three examples: 1. sahara 2. back to the outback 3. the sea beast  i've had quite a bit of free time lately, and i'm not too snobbish to say that all kids movies are just for kids, so i've been going through a couple of the newer netflix kids' selections and calling up my sister to give her reviews so she has new APPROPRIATE stuff to show her kids.   the sea beast is the one that came out most recently, and holy shit - it's way better than any recent disney movies i've seen. it's got some really talented writers and voice actors, the animation is objectively amazing, and it has a heartfelt message that i can really get behind as someone who's worked with animals - every single one of which is a little smarter than most humans give them credit for. solid 10/10 movie. if it helps to convince you, the creators of moana and big hero 6 worked on the movie, and boy, does it show. if pirates, giant sea monsters, evil monarchy, and found family are things you're into, even better.  sahara is the first out of the three that i watched, and i'd give it at least a 7/10. the story isn't super original, very romeo and juliet vibes, and the whole falling in love at first sight trope, but i think they did it decently. the voice acting is a little goofy sometimes, but it's a kids' movie so i don't really take points off for that as the lines and animation are still perfectly synced. animation is, again, top notch, and the movie has some pretty adult jokes that don't cross any lines, so it kept me entertained.  back to the outback, like sahara, focuses on a snake as the main character - and they both shed their skin at the ends of the movies, an interesting parallel that's definitely obvious symbolism but that works really well. this one is heartfelt, has a good message about what it means to be a family and accepting yourself as you are, and i'd highly recommend it at an 8/10. similar animation to sahara, and definitely a few gross scenes but nothing i'd deem inappropriate; one that i both laughed and cringed at is where the main characters (all animals) have to blend in, so they're all being rolled around by some dung beetle allies in, you know, dung. that's not the grossest part, either, but it's still a really sweet movie.   danny, if you happen to see this, PLEASE watch the sea beast, these are all great movies but that one is by far and away the best.
WTF MARMADUKE IS A LIVE ACTION MOVIE THAT I LOVED AS A KID I STILL HAVE THAT MOVIE NO WHY
Danny’s bad movie reviews are my favourite, especially the animated ones.
I was eating a delicious dinner and had to fight to keep my appetite up after I saw this nightmarish animation.
As an owner of two fully-grown Great Danes, I can confirm that they've also beaten the absolute shit out of me, shat in my comically large trophy, caused multiple natural disasters and sat on my shriveled up body multiple times.
I swear if the trainer isn't the next tumblr sexyman i'm going to scream
“dang that dog” is giving major “dinkleberg” energy
You should review Encinoman… it’s like a Disney Channel Original before there was a Disney Channel Original…
Maybe this was made to keep the movie rights
12:21 maybe im just too high but i thought he punched the wall fr at first bruh 💀
It’s really sad when OWEN WILSON IS A BETTER MARMADUKE THAN YOU
As someone who works with dogs, seeing the show dog instantly be evil made me know enough about this movie
I think in the marmaduke Movie my reaction of a 3-D models looks like the 3-D Addams family movie to be honest it just looks like the Addams family directors from the 3-D movie as just worked on it
damn I can’t believe they turned the childrens book, Walter the farting dog, into a movie
m8 this movie was on the netflix top 10 in sweden for like 2 weeks
Maybe the Reason why Pete Davidson didn’t promote the movie was probably bc it wasn’t actually him. It was some dude name Peter Davidson
I loved the Drew Gooden reference LOL
Danny please watch the 2010 live action version
How thin the characters are is so unbelievably uncomfortable, like it's not even uncanny it's fucking horrific
PLEASE swap the upper and lowercase G's
I watched this movie with my cousins and i was saying how bad it was everything wrong with it. I am glad you did this movie
It's sad because  the Og one was really good.
did vivziepop design these characters?
Marmaduke pulled a trynoble
I saw the 2010 live action Marmaduke long before this one, and I'm surprised to say it's somehow BETTER than the animated version.
do yall not know about the original marmaduke?
I think Netflix is just making weird movies for drunk people
Ain't it a weird coincidence that the mean cheerleaders are all poc (& their harassed victim a white girl)??
GREG PILLOW
Oh thank you our lord danny, king of greg. You have saved my night thank you
danny did you make this video so there would be a barking meme of u or what
What's with Drew and Danny throwing out all these foul swoops lately
you should watch spycat its really good ;)
The bad Pinocchio movie is actually not a Netflix movie, the Netflix Pinocchio movie hasn’t been released yet. The heavily memed on Pinocchio movie you mentioned (Pinocchio: A True Story) is just a straight to dvd release that can be rented through Amazon’s streaming service for a few dollars (and likely also from Redbox) in the US. I believe Pinocchio: A True Story is a foreign animated film (Russian?) that got dubbed for English to release in North America and probably English speaking countries outside of North America.
Is Guy Drew's biggest fan or is Drew Guy's biggest fan?
Danny wtf 😒
9:48 I GOT to GO.... but rob....
lets appreciate danny for watching bad movies for us
Animated moms have to have that body shape to show off their big child bearing hips of course /j
Ik Kanye was giggling when he heard Pete rap 💀💀
As someone with a dog that was taught that way, nah beating the shit outta your dog ain’t the way to go
Is it just me or does Thumbnail Danny look weirdly off?
i looked at the thumbnail for the video and thought the dog was pregnant or sum 💀
Do a video on inside job, one of the only good shows on Netflix
10:30 is just caustic from apex legends
I feel like they were shooting for "Willfred" with Marmaduke, that’s why they chose Pete.
I don’t see anyone pointing this out, but the Marmaduke character is based on a newspaper comic strip that ran for over 50 years. This feels like a huge slap in the face to Brad Anderson’s (the author’s) legacy, and it’s sad that no one even recognizes the source material. I saw some people point out the live action movie which is nice. That too was of course based on the comic.
I think they're following the same formula of morbius and the minions 2 {It's so bad that it's good, or just get people to watch it ironically} but minions 2 is fine
I hate that children now will associate this movie with Marmaduke instead of the live action Marmaduke movie - it was so cute and was a pretty nice family movie. This on the other hand...
Dude the hypnosis scene reminds me of that story of the people who got hypnotized through their tv
the Marmaduke animated movie physically pains me to look at cause the original Marmaduke (2010) was my childhood.
there’s an original marmaduke movie that i grew up on, and it was really good… or at least younger me thought so. i’m honestly offended that they butchered marmaduke in such a grotesque way.
Marmaduke not dying at the end will go down as one of the greatest missed opportunities in cinematic history
I like the bulldog lifting the building part ha
Hey Greg’s, I’m eating alone at a nice restaurant watching this video. 🤫 just pretend I’m typing something important so they don’t see 🫡
Pretty sure the only thing good on netflix is "Lost In Space", amazing show, good characters and writting. I know its more of a remake but its still good.  Edit: grammar
ok the mom genuinely caught me off guard its like the animator (or artist who designed the character) started drawing a "realistic" looking person but then just gave up at the ass bc he/she drew it too fat OR it looks like when in gmod you make someone's limb fat by accident and you try to fix it but you can't so you just get stuck with a weirdly shaped human
your hair looks great
18:08 i cant believe you went this entire video NOT mentioning that that dog is _Jk simmons._ i already felt bad for pete davidson, a man who is not really a voice actor, for getting roped into this clearly not knowing what he was a part of, and then you reveal - WITHOUT MENTION - one of my favorite actors/voice actors of all time was in this. i cant _believe._ HOW DID THEY GET HIM
At first, I thought it was some kind of animated remake of the 2010 movie called Marmaduke, but after watching this review, I don't think it is...
Danny should Film every video from under his desk now
16:35 Maybe only dogs can use magic
Is guy Justin chad
It's giving Ratatoing and Goat Movie vibes
The dog's fart irradiated the area and caused multiple deaths, most viewers died of radiation poisoning and leukemia. Luckily there were some survivors, although the radiation resulted in cancer in some viewers of the show. I truly tragic event...
This video is better than the actual movie
4i4s so bad it funny
god i cant stand the toilet and body humor in this movie it grosses me tf out
Yes
"no redeeming qualities" bruh what about that mommy dumpy🥵
4:41 2018 Danny would've said hooves
Wings of Fire was canceled in favor of this? Time to commit Yo Ho Ho
Nah, Guy looks like the villain cus he is queercoded and the way he dresses is so fucking cool
I went to the cinema to watch "minions rise of gru" for fun, and before the movie there was of course a lot of other movie trailers and i can say with confidence that all of them had at least one fart joke in it  Then the trailer for this movie came around and my day got runied
8:13 what in the hell
I love how Danny said “Look at his nose to arm ratio” as if that means anything
Honestly Danny if you cant find the comedy in a dog pooping in a trophy idk if i can be your Greg
I'm in a movie theater rn got here hella early
The only time our dog shitting in the wrong spot was funny was when our dog Erik managed to shit on the ceiling. And that's only been funny in hindsight(not a pun)
I don’t know why but Marmaduke looks awfully like Scooby Doo, in a way..
Lol. This is nothing like the Comic strip
I feel like if Netflix is making bad movies on purpose, then you're doing what they want by giving it visibility
My teacher made us watch that dog movie and I hated it every one else loved it i am in the 6th grade I hate my schoole
The Pinocchio kid from the movie sounds like he’s being held at gunpoint and told to act stressed.
The only good movie they’ve made is the Adam Project
theres an old live action Marmaduke movie i have the dvd of it somewhere
Can’t forget the live action marmaduke
Omg Zeus is JK Simmons no way
not me actually thinking danny punched through his wall for a moment
this movie is the definition of a goofy ahh production
God, I'm so tired of animated movies hiring random celebrities instead of actual voice actors. Rarely do you ever get the same quality of performance.  Also the character design here is so ugly. I get that it's supposed to be stylized or something but it just looks bad.
This movie is so good because of how unbelievably bad it is
They took my childhood favorite movie and ruined it :(
As someone who hates great danes because I was bit in the face by one. This movie is accurate.
2:05 i expected the animation, quality of the backgrounds etc, characters, designs, to be at least somewhat decent but holy shit that is satan
this is how you gain a fart fetish
i subscribed and turned on notifications am i greg yet
I think this is an awful remake of an older live action movie with the same name. Netflix likes to ruin established series/movies :') what's going on with them????
They make characters with Pixar mom bods just for guys like me
Not the emotional support being $947.41 on the bill 😭😭😭
Bro I swear they put Pete Davidson just because of that new drama
Help why does Danny kinda KINDA look like that British guy
Did you see netflix was making live action one piece-
I like the Greg scatter cushions... 10/10 decor
Im very upset because Im watching this video zooted and I actually thought Danny punched a hole in the wall 😭
is Greg your boyfriend?
Wait so how did they pay for the bull
the "fun" of the original marmaduke was that the dogs were real so it was kinda cute, this though...
sea beast was ahead of the curve
am i the only one confused because he uploaded twice in a month
He looks so disappointed in the thumbnail  Me: oh no it must be serious. - turns out it is lol
Danny why did you think it was okay to show us this ?? /lh
Yes, yes they are making bad movies on purpose.
The funny thing is there’s a 2D animated version of all the dogs in the credits and they look INFINITELY better than the 3D models they actually chose
this is definitely a fetish movie…
His name is hilarious marmaduke lol
Resident Evil is pretty good 🥺
Movie bad Not good
Hearing Davidson's voice coming out of that dog as he says, "it's All my fault" made me fuckin lose it. The only good part of the movie. Hollywood can only be cleansed with holy fire
I forgot for a second that this wasn't a movie from the same people who brought us Ratatoing 😬 wtf is going on
And you have to do martial art to beat the shit out of your dog Learn tips for more 😁
I really don't understand how this can be made but good, well received shows are cancelled all the time. Netflix.... you're doing capitalism wrong.... or maybe this is actually good business and im too socialist to get it lmao
not pete davidson PLEASE HAHAH
The terrible thing is… my siblings watched this and liked it         I’m horrified by them.
This is definitely one of the movies of all time.
marmaduke was originally a live action film, so netflix just took the basic idea of the movie and just animated it and made it worse. in my opinion the live action marmaduke is amazing. i used to watch it all the time when i was little
"He's gone too far, dottie." He's about to fucking murder that dog 😭
*?
The Sea Beast is a great movie from Netflix, but I think the main reason they did well is because they got an ex-disney director
10:09 Bro imagine animating this scene 💀💀 nah the creators of this movie should be arrested dawg 😭😂
three thousand and ninety second!!
This is like Totally Spies but with a weird dog. And bad animation
My mom was like: oo let's watch that, it'll be good, it's Marmaduke   Me: that's a bad off-hand remake it sucks
danny your bark is a little too good. who you been barking for huh?
it looks like food fight (2012)
Hey guy
i think they may be just not bothering with budget and thinking they can get away with it. also, there are some very terrible tv series from netflix as well
i’m the alpha greg 🐺 *growls alphally*
MY FRIEND FORCED ME TO WATCH THAT 💀💀💀💀😭
maybe danny has a deal with netflix. netflix puts little to no effort in their productions and maybe even makes them purposefly... more unique (in the way your kindergardiner childs art is unique) and danny gets paid the rest of the movie budget to talk about it, thus more people watch it because danny said all this terrible stuff about it, making netflix's roi go up. in summary, netflix makes bad movies, danny reviews bad movies for the movie promotion, danny gets paid, netflix gets paid, the, end.
Netflix doesnt make the movies, they just somehow green light it to be on their service as original content
This is one of the movies ever
it's a live-action Marmaduke movie from  2010  and it's way better
👀👀👀
bro monster house looks better than marmaduke
Lol I liked it cause it had dog
Why do we need a Marmaduke movie in gd 2022
8:05, thanks for making my dogs bark Danny 🧡
From what I understand about why Netflix is doing low quality content like this may be part of their push for more of the type of content that is "garbage but you can put on in the background to fill the noise", it doesn't make sense why they would go with this approach with something that is animated as compared to something live action, or why they would compete with one of the less interesting aspects of cable television, but that is just my speculation of why they are putting out movies with less budget besides noteworthy cast (even if it is just Pete Davidson in a movie, it was enough to be brought up in videos complaining about it). Netflix is definitely pushing out literally anything to try and save the company as it is currently drowning amidst the streaming wars, but making low quality pieces of media to be forgotten immediately after inception is a weird approach considering that some of their originals are some of the most well produced and highly regarded pieces of media in recent memory.
19:50 pov: you’ve been hiding under danny’s desk for a while and he suddenly noticed you and started promoting express vpn
Did you see the clip about Andrew Tate talking about you
make a movie about the live action/original marmaduke its like highschool for dogs
man i loved the artstyle of marmaduke the old comics. just that very unique penmanship was so interesting to look at
When I first saw this(not even watching it, still haven’t) I was just like          “ew”
i was excited for this movie (kind of) bc i like the live action marmaduke but it was the worst thing i ever watched (btw make a video about the normal marmaduke movie plz. it is so good)
the sad part is that there was a comic strip called marmaduke about a great dane that i'm pretty sure this movie was based off of? the comic was never my favorite but i at least liked it, there were no giant farting scenes at least
Poor original marmaduke being slandered by this movie
Good lord! They did not need to give the mom the ass of Aunt Fanny from Robots.
The Marmaduke rapping at the end reminded me of the dog from that animated titanic video that raps
I’m sorry I can’t stop laughing at the body portions  Other movies I saw had good body portions
Pinochio sounds like That dude with blue tips of his black hair who’s gay
My little sisters put this movie on and we hated it. Our favorite part was when the dog died and we turned it off before they could ruin the movie by bringing him back alive.
?
Why would you put fetish scenes in a DOG MOVIE
marmadook sounds like babadook’s drunk cousin
Marmaduke Is based off an old newspaper comic stripe
We cancelled three more shows to bring you this.
Guy is Drew Gooden’s biggest fan 😭😂
There is like a movie reviewer on YouTube I love that does Negative ratings but differently than you do
I physically can’t watch this video. I grew up with the Marmaduke comics and don’t want to have them ruined for me
Its a kids movie...
not just animated shit being bad. the resident evil show is a travesty.
15:40 is like saying talking to dogs and astral projecting your foot isn't magic and i'm not sure if you've left the world of Marmaduke yet
I watched the first 12 minutes and lost my shit. I would rather shit in my hand and do the Macarena
The whole fart thing is giving deviant art fetish content. Same energy as Dan Schnieder's foot thing 🤢🤢🤢
They got... j.k Simmons for this movie...
I cat has past away today and danny this was the only video that many me smile and laugh today so tysm!
That shirt is so masc
What is one thing that all of the worst movies share.
can't believe drew gooden's biggest fan made a special appearance in this film!!
watch the live action Marmaduke
The hot dog tsunami comment was supposed to show his shock aka swearing in between saying hot dog. It was a double entendre.
I liked the new movie Sea Beast but then there is stuff like this that ruins it
Watched this with my little sis and I almost never criticize movies and even I was seeing how bad this movie is
ive been waiting for one of you commentary bros to be sponsored by ExpressVPN so I can use your discount
i like the thumbnail
11:40 a weezer reference!
the thing that sucks is that actual Marmaduke comic series are actually pretty good.
The baby I nanny loves this movie and also smiles when other kids cry so should I be worried?
Seems like the dog trainer learned from Ceaser Milan
seeing you destroying movies is so fun
0:29.  Well, I watched _The Room_ this year, but I’ll still take your word for it.
are we not going to talk about danny's shirt which says 'daddyboy' 🥰
It's like a scobby doo like dog but he was very dumb and goofy.
Thumbnail Danny looks like he got my report card and is about to take my phone away.
Seriously though WHAT IS THIS ANIMATION?! THIS IS JUST AS BAD AS NORM OF NORTH WHAT THE FU- THE DOG LOOKS LIKE A MINECRAFT SKELETON
Oh wow, Netflix is the sole creator of the straight to DVD films now!
NEW VIDEO!
Wow
Pete Davidson's Marmaduke rap has nothing on "Party Time" by the dog in the animated Titanic movie.
I am still convinced Marmaduke is the same dog that ate everything then eventually died from eating a laptop or some dumb shit like that.   I still cried in theaters though. Dead dog do be sad.
The live action Marmaduke was so entertaining and such a nostalgia trip, seeing it animated like this is just heartbreaking…
My nieces still liked it x-x
So Netflix cancelled countless great animation projects, fun and interesting shows like Daybreak and still saw it fit to release this Foodfight level piece of shit
It's so bad that it makes it hilarious 😂
Oh my god, this was your funniest video.
Omg I think I saw a commercial of this and actually wanted to see it 😬
valid video
3:41 as a aussie i can confirm that kangaroos are jacked, Buutt that dog would look like a back scratcher compared to a male kangaroo
A gay Pinocchio hmm 😒
This movie’s the most _excruciatingly_ boring movie i have *ever* come across. So boring that I can’t even sit thru the commentatory despite loving danny’s vids 😭☠️
Danny is so pretty 😍
Omg already 3k comments in only 3 hours just gos to show you how good dany is
Marmaduke? more like Marmadookie
pete. wtf
I’m turned up notifications. I love you Danny
Marmaduke the Terrorist
Well, the most famous "trainer" or abuser kicks and punches dogs daily. Still popular and rich though.
The funniest thing about the movie has to be the dad looking just like Danny
i can totally see danny sitting in his living room watching this on his tv and his wife walks in
These days, bad movies = views
this movie is so ugly holy shit
Holy shit I really wish marmadook had died that’d be so funny- especially after all the whole “magical get up scene” where everyone is begging him to be alive, if he just died- thats so funny, 10/10 would’ve saved the movie
16:24 the way that siren effect reflected realistically off the photos on the wall was a subtle, but effective flex
barking for free for us
Homie said “put their dueces up” instead of dukes
the ending song kinda sounded like u sang it
What da dog doing 💀
10:34
Denny where’s the toot button?!?
This is the favorite film of the four year old I babysit. We watch it. Every time I come over. 🙃
6:00 Marmaduke has to unleash "Thunder & Lightning"?? that Rundown reference
Dave Peterson should just stay away from acting. Stick to comedy.
there’s a live action marmaduke and it was and probably still is my favorite movie☹️
Why would they even attempt to remake marmaduke. Just leave the live action version alone.
i remember seeing this video on netflix and thinking "the video on this will be really good" and here we are
This is how Netflix dies and Blockbuster comes back
danny
No not Marmaduke, they can't kill his legacy like that.
This must be the work of an enemy stand user!!
Yo Danny your quads are insane!
Oh my god why did they remake maraduke the first was good
I feel like the live action marmaduke is so much better (came out in 2010) maybe you should review that one aswell?
Danny I legitimately, honestly, almost gave this video a dislike just based on having to experience that movie. I know it's not your fault but why did you have to cover THIS
Danny, why does your nose look so weird in the thumbnail?
Finally a video
ok but can i say this movie is absolutely atrocious but its so bad that its hilarious 💀
So are your thumbnails. Terribke dongalez
Now watch the live action 2010 version. It's way way better 😅 the Beethoven films were my favourite when I was a kid
Marmaduke pulled a Chernobyl
I'm 10 and we had to watch this movie in class
was expecting this to be an exaggeration but no this is the most vile shit i’ve ever seen
I'm only 4 minutes in this video and I'm gonna piss my pants and the gym 😭 I'm gonna finish watching later. Love you Danny ❤️
I hated that movie so much my sisters friend LOVED Marmaduke but I hated it but I couldn’t leave. The dog shitting and The credits scene fucking ssuuucckkkk
I can say at least 3 kids have watched this movie, aka my siblings, and I was sat there like 'what is this shit'
i am screaming crying hooting and hollering
The live action one is wayyyy better
I was literally watching this with my older sister the other day and I was like "Danny should make a video about this movie"
Netflix trying to ruin movies and shows because it makes money 🥲
Express vpn link broken Danny.
Netflix is becoming the Blockbuster of streaming services, and honestly Pete Davidson deserves better lmao🤣
Why are some people saying that Netflix is dying? I’ve seen a few comments like that.. I don’t understand. Nothing could replace Netflix except maybe Amazon Prime
The CREDITS look better than the WHOLE DAMN MOVIE  Did they pay these poor animators in peanuts??
Bro I don’t get why Netflix is so insistent on releasing such hot garbage so constantly
this animation is horrid, i feel like Netflix just locked a group of animators and gave them a script and they were supposed to make it in like 4 hours
the animation makes me feel (negative)
Fun fact: The creator of this movie is the director of Pixel Perfect. The fact that somehow Disney hired this guy once upon a time is *something*
how did you go through the entire movie without mentioning the 2010 marmaduke movie
express vpn nord vpn battle
it feels as if u are staring into my soul in the thumbnail
Yo my brother legitimately loves this movie
I’m just praying that Netflix doesn’t shut down cause I need to watch better call Saul season 6
god dam whatd they do to marmaduke, man used to have just run away from home and now hes ugly
I can confirm my little sister watched this movie
i used to love the original Marmaduke, when it was live action and everything. 10/10 movie, literally offended they did that amazing movie like this 😭
Not-so-great-Danny
6:36 worked on me 🤷‍♀
danny you don’t look 13 in the thumbnail what happened 🙁
IM GOING TO GO INSANE WATCHING THIS MOVIE BUT ILL DO IT FOR DANNY'S CONTENT
Every time I see anything about Marmaduke I just think of that scene in Daria, where her dad out of no where just goes, "why don't they just put Marmaduke down?" as he's reading the newspaper in the middle of all the other characters talking to each other about something completely different
I was forced to watch marmaduke on repeat because my baby cousin loves it
My daughter (5yo) picked this movie one day and she didn't even want to finish it
the dog trainer is just cesar milan abusing dogs
I feel like everything is just money laundering at this point
15:51
Guy:  Danny's thoughts: rich & bri'ish My thoughts: he so looks like the dude from Superjail
This feels like another episode of The Animators Barely Disguised Fetish.
2.9k
Resident Evil was also a huge steaming pile
danny why can you bark so realistically… i’m concerned
They make it bad so people meme about it and end up watching it
5:18 why the cut
12:22 I though you actually broke your wall when I first saw that lol
Sure this movie is bad like really bad. But Netflix has even worse shows. My sister who is 6 watches these horrible shows. Especially a really bad Spanish one. If you have time please make a video on it. The show is called “Go, live your life”
Call me crazy but I think Netflix are putting out these bad movies so popular YouTubers react to them, it’s a genius marketing strategy
"When life gives you lemons make life take the lemons back."
I actually had to watch marmaduke when it was my fitfh grade ceramony thing, and it was cringe as all hell. And the animation was horrribleeeee- ESPECIALLY THE MODELS-
What do I love about this movie? That it's bad
the short answer is "yes" bc bored ppl will watch anything
This animation has a very specific low quality style. I once watched a children's cartoon with a similar style while high, and since then I am absolutely convinced that a lot of kids will grow up fucked up in the head from watching these.
8:04 danny please explain why that dog bark was so accurate. I'm getting suspicious...
Aye but the movie Sea beast was pretty good
Something that I find amazingly, ironic with all of this is the fact that Pete Davidson is like SEVERELY allergic to dogs.
Some of them are good like Sea Beasts
wait, how many pinocchios are coming out this year?
The Room, widely considered the best worst movie ever made, became a hit because of how enjoyably bad it was… when a movie doesn’t have that much money or enough of a guaranteed audience, I think they purposely lean into making it worse so more people check it out
DANNY DANNY DANNY!!!! There is a movie on Disney+ called Strange Magic and you have to do a review about it!!!
They're making bad movies so that Danny Gonzalez can give them a bigger platform than Netflix ever could.  But seriously... the character design in that Marmaduke film is nightmare toast.
eeeee
Is that a nuke well uh oh
how is this animation this bad
13:54 actually my class watched it and by the end we all agreed it was 🐶💩 :)
thanks for making a video on my bday :)
Whenever Pete Davidson is mentioned, for a split second I think Peter Davison is being referred to (bcse I'm a really big Doctor Who fan lmao) but then a moment later I remember Pete Davidson exists and he's the one being referred to and feel disappointed
Netflix sucks but for some reason you guys still think it’s better than Hulu but Netflix’s model is take a show make a horrible version
I unironically prefer the animation of the animated movie ripoffs then this... at least those films's animation is so awful it's good. This film just makes me uncomfortable when I look at it.
I'm really hoping someone adds 17:23 to an "Out of context Danny" video.
I can’t believe the Marmaduke IP is worth so little that this trash can exist.  This is embarrassing.
imo the movie wasn't good but it's not the worst thing of all time I think the pacing of the movie was terrible
I'm so fucking sick of Pete Davidson dude. He's the Staten Island Machine Gun Kelly; two sides of the same coin.
Danny’s nose is also 3x thicker than his arms
I was like "how bad can it be? " then Petes mutter hacked my phone and canceled my Netflix subscription. Be careful out there 🙏
6:23 Trainer used KICK, it’s very effective!
This movie had a cinema release in spain
danny:)
The dad's nose still has nothing on Danny's
i honestly think the new Jurassic Park was a scam/money laundering situation. The trailers were so much better than the actual movie. Some parts of the trailers weren't even in the movie
yo
12:20 Danny should get a sticker of that punch, and keep it in the same spot on the wall
this movie looks so bad it could be an NFT. (NetFlixTrash?)
3:20 Is that Todd Packer? 😂
I wonder if one of the reasons that studios want to make bad movies is because they know online creators and influencers will talk about it, which would therefore increase internet searches and interest and, hopefully for them, increase more revenue for them.
I actually kinda dig the ending credits song. Lmao I am also stoned asf tho.
mom🤤🤤
This movie made me put up my marma-dukes
Netflix is shooting itself in the foot. Canceling good shows and making bad ones 😭😭😭
Dabby you loook difererent.. what happended
Apparently I was also born in the 1990s and on earth.
Love the Greg pillow set 🥰
Wtf is that carhartt shirt
This is a movie a substitute teacher would put on to pass time
Pay people dirt cheep to make hundreds of movies a season and you'll make a profit even if the bulk of the movies are terrible. It's not that bad scripts keep getting greenlit, it's that producers have quotas that guarantee bad scripts will be greenlit.
Hii
My teacher made us watch this movie and I straight up was thinking this would be perfect for Danny/Drew
Earlyish
ok but old marmaduke 🔥🔥🔥
Sometimes you can tell how bad a movie will be just based on the sound effects
You should review my friend Bernard  the kangaroo scared me as a kid ( it’s on tubi for free and the app is free and you don’t need a subscription and it’s legal pls :)
GOD! I SIMP FOR yOU MY UWU KING HUSBANDO! haha... Thanks for being so cute and funny. I love whe your upload.
notifs are on. my name is now greg.
This hurts me because my favorite childhood movie is marmaduke (2010), it's so much better than the 2022 marmaduke and it makes me sad knowing that I can't mention the movie anywhere now without people thinking about this crap
What I think ?what I think is that The writer of the movie tought he might get an Reverse Oscar or he’s on drugs that’s the only way I can explain myself how this happened (oh and btw forgot to say turned on notifications I’m Greg now ,we’re Greg now )
this movie is abhorrent. it looks like it was made by a bootleg studio in 2005 with a budget of two thousand dollars. i'm sad that it exists
Why does the animation sometimes remind me of kids learning games from the early 2000s? That's rough to look at
I love watching a video about Danny discovering Marmaduke from a bad Netflix movie, because when I was in 3rd grade I discovered Marmaduke from the bad books.
Hey Danny!
I like this movie lol
once you notice he only watches himself in the display it’s impossible to notice anything else 😓😅
Sea Beast is a solid movie
This animation is literally just veggie tales, but not respectable
pls watch the live action maramduke with owen wilson
i love how in 0:41 he put hes all that as in worst movies bc its true
why is nobody talking about the trophy scene, that was probably the worst part
Watch the original marmaduke
I teach kindergarten and played this for my students near the end of the school year. They all found the giant fart absolutely hilarious but half of them did fall asleep about 3/4 of the way through the movie
Watching the ad as well Becuase I know Danny won't upload for another while, and I need to hold onto this high for as long as I can.
7:05 so that dog trainer really pulled a Pokémon on him
you should have kept the hole in the wall persistent for the remainder of the episode just to fuck with your viewers.
I think they could be doing it to try and capitalize on meme culture
Did Danny actually break his walll
The original live action Marmaduke was way better one of my top 10 favorite childhood movies
Does he ever realize that this is just is a ripoff from the oreginel
These poor Netflix animators, they deserve so much better😭I guarantee if there had been more lively acting and enthusiasm this could’ve  been a decent children’s movie that you’d watch as a kid and just vibe with. But 😭 they managed to cast the most bland sounding man on earth to voice a DOG?? The most upbeat vocal animals 😭 honestly Netflix is now nothing other than bad decisions
i had to make a fake parent teacher conference list for class and i put more effort into making 30 fake families than this movie did on their payment list
I feel like Netflix is trying to destroy their site
ok but the dog trainer tho...kinda fine.
yo in the expressvpn link you forgot to put a spacebar so it says "dannygonzalezand"
Why does the credit animation looks better then the whole movie?
lol my sister watched this movie alot
Yknow what lol that's what pete gets for getting involved in the Kardashians
RIP Marmaduke. You will always be dead in our hearts
Marmaduke could have won the dogs show if he died. It would have been posthumorlessly.
250556th
Am I the only one who thinks guy looks like Danny?
damn.. that umm..angle..for the ad read. was.. umm. good. keep us there.. under the desk... yeah. good.  . . . first time i actually payed attention to your ad read  😏 .
Maybe the reason guy didn’t actually train the dog was because he wanted him to fail so the family wouldn’t get the money AND he could bill them to get extra. He must have known the dog was so repulsive that not only would he get the money from the family, he would also get to beat the dog
Would’ve been a decent ending if when he almost die and woke up he could talk to people in actual English and that is what wins him the contest.
My teacher played that thing if you can call it I hate it
The models look weird and the shading's also pretty bad, like the "asset flip for $1 on Steam" kind of bad
what the fuck did they do to my boy marmaduke
This was not a good video to watch while eating. Blegh.
when I was on netflix one day I say this that was newly added and I was like " There is no way netflix added this" and when I watched the trailer or a clip of the film I just thought to myself why and I have been waiting for danny to talk about this
looks like that dog trainer was trained by Cesar Milan himself, only the finest kicks
That mom is way too thicc
19:32  Phil Nibbelink?! The former Disney animator who made his own flash animated films singel handly ( "Puss In Boots" with Michael York, "Leif Eriksson" as a kid and "Romeo & Juliet" with seals ), really?  This honestly makes his own films feel like actual Disney films in comparison.
my two little sisters and little brother watched this so that's three (3) kids who have watched it and i think they enjoyed it...? from what i saw, the movie is extremely highlighted on netflix kids i remember walking in when they were halfway through it, saw the animation style and immediately walked out of the room
I visited my brother and he put this on for his kids because Blippy was driving him crazy. The mom comes on screen and he immediately turns the TV off.
Epic video
Speaking of Pinocchio can you do a review on it?
The kids I babysit put it on and I was convinced I was getting duped.
9:12  This whole..THING.. gives me serious DeviantArt vibes
not the black cheerleaders bullying the white girl 😭
Netflix couldn't resist making that Cocomelon dollar, so they copied their exact format...
Dude Marmaduke looks like the live action monsters from Scooby-Doo monster island
Idk
This is giving me strong rata-toing vibes
The original live action Marmaduke slapped so fuckin hard
Uhhhh… that banquet eating scene was just non-nude vore out there for kids. I’m disturbed.
love how the trainer has a stand that's his foot
Danny I like your shirt
How did he get to china from America how can he burn weight so fast yet survive the harsh cold
holy shit they re-wrote marmaduke (2010) and turned it into an animated movie or something idk i havent seen the original i just remember seeing the stupid trailer for it everytime i would put in my DVDs for whatever movie i was watching, probably ramona and beasus or one of those movies
This is such a movie
Bring back the title intro
i’m glad we finally found out who this “guy” danny always says hi to is
I think it's a shame that Netflix is doing this. Netflix itself is a multi-million dollar company that could use a high budget. The movies themselves are bad or ruined because they didn't want to use too much money (I think).
19:32 Wait... Phil Nibbelink? As in director of We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story, Phil Nibbelink? As in animation director for Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Phil Nibbelink? Oh, Phil, what have you done to yourself?
So you're teeling me they made a movide about a guy who trains a dog by using violence and it portrays it as badass and cool and kids saw it
Danny you look like Flint Lockwood in the thumbnail
YE
"uh oh" and then fucking dies by getting all of his bones crushed by a camera crane. Also, im pretty sure there was a camera guy up there, so he is probably either dead or has multiple broken bones
Hey, that "dad" character kind of looks like Danny!
This is the first movie where my eyes struggle to adjust everything moves so quickly and in a jilted manner I.e. not many frames and the colour palet soft lines make it hard to discern what is happening. Heck the trees in the background has more detail than the foreground, how am I meant to focus on the characters
He compressed the food to gas and shot it out his ass
I like your hair.
"putting their deuces up"
The thing is that Netflix , as every other streaming service , wants to have the biggest number of content to attract subscribers, so they want quantity not quality , sometimes they make a good show or movie but thats after making 50 bad ones
Yay another Danny video!!!!
Is this movie not just an animated rip-off of the 2010 movie Marmaduke? They are both great Danes, there is both simese cats, when the animals talk the people only hear the animal sounds they make, both the dogs get in trouble and run away, and much more? The original movie was 100% better than this and this just kinda gives Marmaduke a bad name :/
this movie looks like it was animated in 2008. they just drudged it out of the content swamp and had pete davidson record all the lines in an afternoon
Netflix put their entire budget into stranger things then forgot about everything else 😭
That’s why I buy physical movies to have in a collection, You never know when streaming services are going to make their selection worse 🤷🏽‍♂️
I chuckled for a good minute after Danny said Guy was Drew Gooden's biggest fan
Okay but like watch Sea Beasts because that movie is amazing and I was surprised when I saw it was made by Netflix. It reminds me of all the love that went into Over the Moon!❤️✨
Why does this give Ratatoing vibes tho? 😂😂
As a dog trainer… I’m horrified 😂
the face in the thumbnail is ever so slightly off
Im not even 10 mins in this review and I can't watch this animation no more. Caracters are boring looking and ugly, even for toddlers standards. What is this movie?!
When’s the next Disney channel movie video coming out? 🤨
My teacher almost 😅 put it up in the classroom but instead every one voted against it and we watched  something else.  Ps: the teachers 👩‍🏫 29 years
Beating the shit out of dogs to train them and somehow being famous as a result is actually cesar millans whole thing so i guess marmaduke isnt THAT unbelievable
My shih tzu mad af when Danny made that roast
so.... movies like these get money to get made... and I.. a poor student, barely knowing how to animate, gets NOTHING!?    rude
Guy looks like Tom Holland. And no I will not apologize for saying this
Even the live action maraduke was so much better than this 💀💀💀
still, I'd rather watch this than Cuties.
I saw the ad for the movie on the thumbnail when i was watching Minions the rise of gru
I saw this movie two times in a row when it first came out a bit ago. I babysit two boys, one is 5 and the other is 7, and they lost their fucking minds over this movie, especially the youngest. They laughed when the dog shit, they hated zeus with so much passion, and they cried when they thought Marmaduke was dead. The second the movie ended they had me restart it and we watched it again. It was torture. I've been trying to forget this movie ever since, and I thought I was going to make it to the grave without ever seeing this nightmare ever again, but no. Here I am. Thank you Danny
The quality of this animation is like acid to my eyes….
why do you look so constipated in the thumbnail? are you okay?
10:10 stranger things season 5 be like
bro it feels like yesterday he posted his mobile game vid
This… was an experience 😅 This seems like Tom and jerry but just like horribly done 💀 did yk there is a m’arma dyke live action movie that came out way before this. And if you’re looking for interesting movies, I reccommend watching the willoghbees lmao
Short answer "yes"
If lifting convention centres and minor reality bending is a small town level what the hell goes on in the worldwide championships? How is this just a hobby in a world where dogs are magical creatures on the level of dragons
Eh I watched American Pyscho 2 : All American Girl.
watch once upon a mattress please danny !!! please.
netflix will only have my comedians uncensored showsbringing me back to it, and thats about it. networks are streaming so its upto netflix to stop the blind approval of all shows.
The original movie was amazing
Between this, Pets United, and Dog Gone Trouble, I feel like they just have to hit a production quota
great video just to let you know your expressvpn link dosent work
2 hours gang
Marmaduke was also an early 2000's movie that was also really bad. Owen Wilson is voicing marmaduke
Babe wake up,Danny Gonzalez posted!
I thin love like yo 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🥳🥳
It's like 1991 cgi animation got knocked up by a 2014 $1.99 mobile game
I saw 5 year olds watch this movie and they started laughing at the grossest part,i lost 10000 brain cells
My history teacher put this movie on after finals and good lord was it horrible. We could not make it through. We had to turn it off. Thank you bringing this issue up
"keep dickin' around on the ground like that with no talent and you're gonna destroy thier lives."   IM CRYING 😭😂
My class was eating lunch in class and we had to pick between Marmaduke and Coraline. Marmaduke won
This movie is *so* terrible oh God, where are you? Please return to us. YOOOOO THEY MURDERED THE DOG IN THE FINAL ACT.   CHRIST
The character design makes me want to puke
wait they got the studio behind ratatoing To make this one
See Netflix? This would never happen if you didn't cancel daybreak
I can see so many clips from this video going into a Danny Gonzalez without context video
The dad's way too weak marmalade definitely cucked the dad
5:33 the trainer behind the slaughter.... O.O
This might be an Israeli movie.  Guys called guy only come from Israel (like me)  Although I am tall
I feel like Guy, the British guy, has tumblr sexyman potential. The suit, the quriky glasses, the accent, the morally questionable behaviour -- it's all there.
shoutout to David Koechner for giving that tearful eulogy in the fucking Marmaduke movie
very funny laughed much
i’m surprised more people haven’t noticed how much of this movie is weird writer’s fetishes….
I can’t believe Justin Chad was cast as Guy!!! This is an outrage!
Every time he cuts back to the movie I get irrationally mad. There's no excuse for a Netflix production to look worse than those ripoff animated movies to trick oblivious parents into renting them for a very unlucky child. The animators aren't at fault cause they probably worked for pennies, but the producers and money men behind this movie are going to a deeper circle of hell than ever before for this shit. Sucks that this is now viewed as acceptable children's entertainment by large media companies    :^ (
I feel like Pete told his agent - “I’m dating a single mom and I gotta do something to make her kids like me  - are there any kids movies I can do?”
I feel like for the past couple of years hollywood in general has been making intentionally bad movies, because they know people will hate-watch them and making them go viral.
Bro I watched this movie in class and we stopped watching it after like two minutes because we realized how bad it was
6:22 I guess the trainer is gonna get ten smackaroos from Swagbucks.
I can’t believe he spent his time watching this
15:33 did that dog just fucking expand its domain
Everytime Danny posts my life gets a little better
it feels like the person that made that movie was drunk while making it
I was babysitting some kids and they turned this on and they loved it and I had to sit there like wtaf is this. So yeah, ig kids actually watch this
my sister is actually addicted to this movie she will not stop watching
I just wanted say that Morgz and Chad & Ivy made a game.The studio's name is BBTV.Its a studio which collabs with youtubers to make games.
God this movie is so ugly. The 2D drawings at the end are the best looking parts of the whole thing.
The "renowned dog trainer beating the shit out of dogs" is funnily/tragically accurate, because that's basically Cesar Milan.
Pinoccio is a russian movie made by a russian studio, just saying a fact. Great job with the video though!
for some reason i thought danny’s computer background would be cursed
4:30 that reminds of when I was chilling in my room and we had a mini earthquake and my sister and I both thought to ourselves "What did the cats do?" (We have two cats)
2[21 Johnny Johnny but more shit
Hi, Greg
3 seconds in and the audio mixing was already a great indicator of how much they truly cared about this movie.
That dog should have died.
“who thought this was gonna be funny” danny i’m so sorry but that’s just someone’s f3tish they got to put into a movie :/ like the scene with the rabbit and the pancakes in wreck it ralph 2
He dies, they sue the company, and his death saves them all
i worked at a place that boarded dogs and one time there was this huge chunky lab named jack 3 and one day i took him outside for a walk so he could use the bathroom, alright. he peed all over the yard but he hadn’t pooped yet, so i let him off his leash in this side yard. he runs around for a few minutes, but then he finally started to pop a squat in front of the chain link fence. HOWEVER. he was not just ‘in front of the fence’ or ‘backed up against the fence’, no. this dog could not even assume the correct squatting position because his ass was pressed against the fence. there was a precious few seconds where i wondered what the hell he was doing, and then…  jack 3 shit through the fence.   i’m just standing there in shock as this big monster of a dog deftly fires a turd through the chain link fence without it even touching the fence and lands in the parking lot on the other side. after a moment i turned to my coworkers in the other part of the yard. “did y’all see that?!” “see what?” “he… jack 3 just shit through the fence!!!” “oh yeah he does that for some reason”  so yes danny sometimes a dog pooping in a weird place actually IS hilarious. this movie looks like garbage though
Unlikeable protagonist meets unlikeable designs feat. apathetic voice actors. Somehow, Little Panda Fighter has more consistent characters, and that's... that's not a good thing
i think marmaduke is speaking british, and thats why his owners cant understand him
2:30 I was born in the early 2000s and I hate everything in this shot alone
This movie looks like it was made in 2009
I opened youtube and was hoping danny had uploaded a video so i can eat dinner to it😆🤣
It's tru tho dogs are dick eds...and unfortunately most dog walkers are dick ed dog walkers... and rhats usually the root of their problem 🙄
My kid would fight you for saying these things about his favorite movie “brown dog”   He’s 2 sooo maybe that says all you need to know about the target audience… 🧐
we watched this at the summer camp i worked at and i lost my mind but the kids actually liked it i was trying not to cry and throw up
I don't want to say this but the part with him eating the food and bloating up and then farting and bloating again smells suspiciously like someone on the team has an inflation fetish
I think they saw how big of a meme morbius or Pinocchio was and how popular it became because of that and that’s why people now make bad movies on purpose
Just wait till he finds the live action version of marmaduke
i am an aspiring screenwriter and one day i hope to write the worst tv show in history on purpose
Honestly videos like this one about how bad these movies are get millions of views, which probably ironically gets enough people to know about the film that marketing isn't really needed enmasse and the hate watches bc of these videos likely end up making the bad movies profitable.   Same with YouTube, videos about drama & why media is bad get way more views than singing the praises of great media or nice videos without drama. Netflix are basically making YouTube videos at this point
I haven’t heard the term put your deuces up since the 90s and I was born in 2000
The dog rapping at the end reminded me of the dog rapping in “The Legend of the Titanic.” What’s with dogs and rapping going hand in hand with bad movies?
Danny should do a video with Laura it's been ages...
Marmaduke the 2010 one was a childhood movie of mine, it wasn't good in the slightest but Netflix needs to at least get some originality then remaking an already half animated film..
Danny ages like a cartoon character, having his hair whiten and, maybe some slightly noticeable lines under his eyes appear
TWO HOURS AGO LETSS GOOOOOO
I remember enjoying reading the Marmaduke comic strip in the newspaper. why would they do this to Marmaduke.
I remember watching the original Marmaduke in cinema's, not like it is an achievement or anything. But at least that movie had some redeeming qualities.
Danny, please review the movie "Food Boy"
as someone who watched the OTHER movie Marmaduke when I was younger, this makes me..unnaturally upset
PLEASE REACT TO STAR STRUCK
this is a disgrace to the orignal marmaduke
I hate when the villain is rich but not British
19:25  “Y’know there’s something you should know so I’m gonna tell you so, don’t sweat it, forget it, enjoy the show! Working all day now it’s time to unwind sit back relax take a load off your mind!”
Oh my God, his face at 10:10... Today's Episode is "The Writer's Barely Disguised Fetish"
A whole nation dies due to one shart. The dad: DIGGITY DANG THAT DOG!
I like the angle of his ad read it made me hehe fantasize
2.6kth
Cuz  the charickters look weird
Wow youtube removed my comment- I had said, at least in the new Pinocchio we at least have the true hero of the film. The cat who shoots Pinocchio TWICE and then tries to burn down the tent Pinnochio is in to finally destroy him and end the nightmare of a film. Sadly he does not succeed. Sadly.
Yayyyy new video
I like this movie
great stuff
Wtf is this. the Marmaduke I know is the one with real life dogs made in 2010 which wad my fav movie when I was little but okay.
Is Netflix YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES
Lmao
I thought it was “fel” and not “foul”
I never skip the sponsored bit because you are so wholesome and i dont want to be mean at you
I won’t stand for this marmaduke hate the movie was fire on goodness gracious💯
Hey guy
I was with my teacher at their house and while we were making dinner ( they played it in the background)  and I agree this movie is awful in my opinion
No I’m keeping the original uncensored ending
Netflix makes makes bad movies to boost their esg rating score for there biggest investor Blackrock
“I GOT TO GO” the dog watches danny and drew huh
Netflix not only is charging more also making more Netflix originals so I guess they don’t have to pay royalties to have great options.
Movie bad for me
Danny please bring back the “this video is over now” song at the end of the videos
tbh, at this stage I feel like we are all in the vocal minority at this point. Like honestly, in the grand scheme of things, despite how right we are.....everyone else with different opinions outnumber us. Like when you think about how many families are out there in the US; how many parents out there really think so little of the animation medium or how many people out there don't care about the integrity of live action stuff (my dad being one of them). The type of parents that want to have their kids be quiet and know so little about good media, so they just flip on random cartoons for them to watch so they have some free time.....yeah....honestly I think that those type of people are the ones mainly supporting these videos with views. Like no matter how many critics or audience scores we try to fail something with....there will always be a greater amount of dumb parents out there that literally couldn't care less about the integrity of things and just want to put their kid in front of a tablet or TV.
love the new greg pillows ❤️
I was born on 2500, on Mars and I hated the animation. At first glance the characters seems standard, not too good, not too bad.   Until they moved and you just have this dread in your heart, its like watching an AI or an alien impersonating humans, with their stiff movements, eerie expression, and it just feels so off.  Edit : You cant convince me this is not a cartoon made for those fetished animals or something?
Marmaduke is based off of the comics, from I think the 80s
im sorry but is no one gonna talk about the brand deal angle
Lol
this is like he's all that but gooby
uh-oh *splat*
i need a "daddyboy" tshirt like yesterday
17:22 must be my new favorite out of context danny scene i think.
It's because Netflix is buying from the European and South American animation studios for super cheap. These teams tend to have a lesser budget than American studios so they have no choice but to sell to the biggest market they can which is currently the American and Chinese market, but since China won't buy these it's America by default.
Marmaduke is the cause of every bad thing ever.
I think the entire movie would be worth it if he did die at the end
The original Marmaduke movie is so much better. It starts out with the family leaving on vacation, but Marmaduke stays home and throws a party that destroys the house. The dad/owner is also a surfer, and decides that to make Marmaduke worth keeping, he’d have to have the dog win a surfing competition to cover the costs of the house being destroyed. Marmaduke doesn’t win the competition, but in the end he saves his owner/dad from drowning in a typhoon. The family realizes that the dog doesn’t have to be perfect as long as they have a mutual love for eachother. It’s a nice lesson that this new movie absolutely screwed up.
hypnosis isn't magic lmaoo
Art is subjective, so it’s only my opinion, but to me the end credits animation so much easier on the eyes than the whole dang movie, those designs and then the stretchy-ness of their movements and mouths??? Terrifying.  Also I realize the animators also probably hated the designs too, just throwing that out there
dude my mom LOVED this movie. 💀
In some countries (and I imagine some states too) film studios can use bad movies as tax write offs to pay less corporation tax. In some circumstances a loss can result in a profit for the business
Danny I’m sorry but you are being way to sarcastic in your videos recently
Probably cause they want you to react to it I have not watched full vide only like a few seconds of it
This shits disgusting omg 😭 (No pun intended)
The only reason marmaduke is being watched is the poor kids in the classrooms being forced to watch it by the teachers
We had to watch this movie at school ….and we came in to the fart scene….. with no context😳
what I would give to see Danny’s letterboxd…
Cant believe Netflix made and spent money on this abomination but I am not okay with this season 2 was still cancelled.
Lol
Ah, the age of low budget movies is back. The reason studios are doing this are, sadly, because studios are hoping to appeal to meme culture and the clout chasing generation. Look at how much attention Morbius and the new Minions movie got because of memes; movie reviews on youtube that poke fun at bad movies also bring attention to movies, which means more people go to watch them. Add on top of that, Netflix loves to overinflate their watch numbers by counting a movie as "watched" by watching the first 5 minutes (I think it's 5), so, there's that too...
The Mid Dane
okay but why did they allow pete to voiceover the dog..
Netflix isn't "making" anything. They're just obtaining streaming rights for random garbage movies being made by shitty studios. It's all to snap up relatively cheap films to just fill out their backlog of garbage shovelware content so that young children or old people or some shit will just let movies autoplay forever.
What if the reason this movie looks like dog shit is because that silly little goofball Marmaduke shat on it o:
8:03   Danny is a furry now there's no going back.
The trainer is a dog whisperer my guy
It’s the spider arms that really get me….
I love how they blame the literal dog, rather than about anyone else, like perhaps the abusive trainer for not doing a good job
I'm not even disappointed by the humans in this movie as much as I'm baffled by the atrocity that is Marmaduke. Half the time I couldn't figure out what were his front legs and what were his back legs. He looks like a blob. Marmaduke the blob
Did they commission a fiver animator to make this movie? It's animated like a budget kids YouTube channel
Somehow this is both the original production and the cheap knock off at the same time
Yes this movie is bad but it was so nice of them to put Drew’s biggest fan in the movie!! 🥰🥰❤️
the two little boys (2 & 5) that i babysit watched this movie while i was there and genuinely liked it, i was in shock for the second half of the movie
I love marmalade
That dog had a pretty fowl fart. Because he ate a bird.
Damn, Pete Davidson is in need of money that bad?
this GODDAMN movie is the ONLY THING that keeps the kids i babysit calm when they’re upset. i hate it so much
When I was babysitting, I saw a kid actually watching Marmaduke.  I wanted to change the movie so bad, but instead, I cringed the entire time
So Danny watched Scott Cramer’s video about Netflix making bad shows on purpose and just decided to do the same exact thing huh
Real ones remember the live action marmaduke. That was a really funny and good movie
Hey Guy
I FORGOT IT WAS PETE DAVIDSON BY THE END HAHAHAHA
Marmaduke is just an ElderFCard remakeboot
Netflix: drops Marmaduke like it's a hot potato and they want nothing to do with it. Also Netflix: gives us the glorious beauty of The Sea Beast.
"putting their duces up"? um..... what? you mean their "dukes"?
live action Marmaduke >>
Why does Danny look so serious and mature in the thumbnail? Who's that grown business boy?
"Ababay"
Chernobyl part poo
i had to watch this shitty movie at work i work at a daycare
Pete Davidson really got no respect for himself whatsoever
I had to watch marmaduke one time and i wondered why it existed
19:28 that lil dance lol
Yaaaaaaa dog dead
I’m pissed because live action Marmaduke is AMAZING
im not entirely sure why but i had an old teacher who whenever she forgot our names would just call students marmaduke. in our first lesson she was like hey guys something you gotta know about me is i will call you marmaduke. and we all kinda thought that was a bad and unfunny joke then she did it and we were all kinda like ok this bit of yours isnt funny anymore but she never stopped.
LOL I started watching marmaduke with my 7 and 5 year old. 10 mins in THEY asked to stop it
this movie would have been improved so much if marmaduke fucking died at the end. it would have been so fucking funny.
So basically the moral of this movie is literally telling people to beat up their dog in order for them to obey, and that they should start making money out of them??? netflix what
7:49  The dogs ear just goes through the curtain, they really put 0% effort into this movie
If anyone replies to this comment, they are a bot.
i liked the live action version of this in 2010.
the original marmaduke is untouchable 😞
Never expected a hit piece on Marmaduke
the mom is badddd bro
As an unofficial, unauthorised spokesperson for Netflix, I can confirm: we’re absolutely making terrible movies intentionally. In fact, we’re doing it just to fuck with you, Danny.
Guys... Just pretend I said something funny
sometimes i kept thinking "did danny edit the movie to look like that why is it so bad?" AND I KEPT REALIZING IT DOES SUCK
The sad part is that I watch this whole movie 😭
That mom's design was 100% an attempt to go viral on twitter
Should have made it a -100 out of 10
I was trying to come up with a funny parody of the Marriage Story breakdown for this movie but found it was too sad to continue. It's infinitely more sad when someone wishes a big stinky dog was dead than Scarlett Johansson
Danny short answer yes, yes they are bad movies make bad movies just so people talk about them and be skeptical and people watch to make fun of it.
Suddenly ratatoing is NOT the worst movie I’ve ever seen
I know I should focus on the poor animators and stuff, but honestly  Why does Danny actually look like an adult man in the thumbnail?
The original marmaduke was amazing I watched it a lot for some reason when I was younger and I am so mad at this version, I would send the new marmaduke to an animal shelter at any chance I had.
Danny please review the Wildebees on Netflix it’s absolutely atrocious and possibly the worst thing I have ever had to sit through
Deuces (up) - Peace out, like bye Dukes up - Raised fists, as if to fight
marmaduke more like marmadoodoo
I think the artists didn’t pay attention when they learned about shape theory and just heard it was important and made all their characters look like basic geometric shapes
this woman is built like a centaur
My dad made me watch this movie and oh *B O Y*
Get stick bugged the movie, lol
12:21 holy shit I thought he really punched his wall that effect is nuts
The sole entry on this movie's IMDb trivia section: "Martin Scorsese once called this 'somehow even better than Shark Tale (2004)'"
Ever since me and my family watched this atrociousity, I've been waiting for this video
i'm so disappointed you didn't say "putting their marmadukes up"
Netflix likes dog abuse, got it
There's supposed to be Guillermo Del Toro Pinocchio coming out later this year
My teacher put on Marmaduke and as soon as the mom came up we laughed so hard she had to turn it off 😭 specifically 3:21
Good job
fyi the orgianal marmaduke is fire
ok but PLEASE check out “The Sea Beast” ITS AMAZING LIKE AAAAA THE REPRESENTATION, THE PLOT, THE ANTI-CAPITALISTIC MESSAGE it’s amazing please
Getting looked down at while being told about the sponsor as I'm apparently under the desk and Danny's wearing "Daddyboy" on his shirt... A POV experience I wasn't expecting to have.
you need to see the zombies movies on disney+ there are 3 movies
I watched this movie when it first came onto Netflix and I immediately knew you were going to talk about it because it’s stinky garbage.
Billionsuprisetoys is better at animating  than this
“Dog training tricks your dog trainer doesnt want u to know: *beat the shit out of your dog* :)” -Danny Gonzales, 2022
"this guy is guy, his name is guy, he's drew goodens biggest fan" best line
all the comments = paragraphs
Netflix the streaming service that has good  shows they didn’t make and terrible movies that they made
Daney gonsles just punch a hole in wall
I wonder who the shameless kinklord was that made marmaduke pregnant/vore and then fart everywhere
father. when can i leave to be on my AoOwNnN?
18:23  BRIAN, LOOK OUT! Brian: oh, uh!
I have only seen one comment on here actually talking about the original live action Marmaduke, man I miss 90s and 2000s live action talking animal films, they were the best! Shout out to Space buddies and cats Vs dogs
“one fowl swoop” is an incorrect representation of the saying. It’s “one fell swoop,” it’s a Shakespearean term. Although it was a pun, the context does make it seem like he thought the former was true. But who knows
something about the animation in this movie makes it look like it’s one of those fake copies that just look like the movie to trick you into buying it
They want to tank so bad that they can claim bankruptcy.
My step sister was watching this and I hear the farts from the kitchen and started internally crying at the thought that this is what entertainment has come to for children
My teacher forced us to watch this on the last day of summer in 7th and we all wanted to die during it.....
They're trying to make us snap and flip shit.   Covid and the lockdowns created such horrible mental health and other things.   People look up to their show's and movies and games for an escape. So many of everything has let people down.   It's the straw that broke the camel's back.
Please please please bring back the “this video is over now” song
Am I the only one who thinks it’s like a gross fetish thing. I really hope I’m wrong about it, but the whole big belly things and all the jokes and everything just felt almost icky.
As a dog trainer I can say that throwing dogs into trees is the best tactic.
netflix is becoming a really big in the animation industry, it’s helping to keep the art form alive but i’m not sure i like where it’s going. I heard some interview with the ceo about their new techniques for ‘efficiency’ or whatever. without all the fluff it sounded suspiciously like a tactic to pay their animators less for more work and sadly this seems like a product of that
ayo why was express vpn supporting danny under the desk :(
It’s like in movies when they make fun of actors for being in unimaginably bad movies or music videos in the past, but movies like that never existed…. Until now.
True
Marmaduke 2010 was better, obviously
YES…. There… I just saved you 21 minutes
I like how you’re badly cropped into the thumbnail it’s truly beautiful
True story, my dog actually cost me so much money few years ago and I’m still struggling since.
The fact that you didn't mention the live action version that's like the best movie ever [/j] is so disappointing [/j]
hi dan
Original live action marmaduke far superior tbh
When the new monster high live action movie comes out I need you too watch it
My Reaction😐😑😴
The Marmaduke Comics are actually good
Marmaduke 2010 is objectively better
the style of the characters actually physically hurts to look at
marmaduke is such a bad name
So this was at the end of the school year so since it was the end of the school year we’re just watching a bunch of movies in my special ed class and then One of the younger kids picked the movie Marmaduke so we watched it and the whole time we were watching the movie in my head I was like what in the fuck am I watching
My little brother saw maraduke when it came out and he just watched like 15 mins and got bored 💀
Nobody’s gonna say anything ab the angle of the ad portion?? Why does Danny looking down at me make me feel like I can’t click off the ad.
Also wtf is that picture of you in the thumbnail
It's Marmin' time.
When I watched this movie I just knew someone would make a video about it and I was hoping it'd be danny, the day has finally come
Scott Cramer is all I’m gonna say
The animation in where the dead go to die is less unpleasant to look at than this
Good..ah... Good video... Yep
I remember a few weeks ago seeing my younger siblings watching this movie, and the dog terrified me
Danny, your minecraft streams were always amazing, entertaining and fabulous. I would love if you would do more.
My kid came home from summer day camp saying they watched Marmaduke…luckily I have confirmed it was the live action version which I think is slightly better than whatever this is
I remember when getting my hair done the hairdresser put this movie on for her kids so I was forced to experience this visual torture while also experiencing the physical torture of her pulling at my hair
The original Marmaduke was such a gem why does Netflix ruin everything💔💔
I’ve seen all 86 Netflix exclusive animated movies and this isn’t even the worst one, Beat Bugs: All Together Now, Horrid Henry’s Gross Day Out, and The Larva Island Movie wish they were as good as Marmaduke.  (I already commented this but I edited it to add a link to my ranking of all of them on Letterboxd, not realising that Danny had it set so that comments with links in automatically got deleted. Just making it clear that I’m not stealing someone’s else’s comment)
Him: Punches wall. Me:  trying to see if he actually punched his wall for the rest of the video and finds out he didn't at the very end
The live action marmaduke had infinitely more family fun than this shit
Wait Danny are you really not going to talk about the real ending 😂 how Marmaduke is fine and Zues' owners TAKE HIM TO THE POUND 😂
I hate how a lot of kid movies nowadays are just plain stupid. Kids are smarter than we think and they pick up things quickly, we don’t have to write dumb characters and little to no effort plots in order to keep their attention. Sure, keeping things silly and light hearted is ideal for kid shows/movies but it wouldn’t hurt to actually put real effort and time into making it a good show and not dumb everything down. Encanto and Turning red is a great example of kid movies that aren’t only silly/fun, but also teach a lesson, has a relatable plot to lots of people, and doesn’t underestimate the intelligence of it’s target audience.
… 😳Wait did you really just put a hole in your wall fer views, dude😂?  C00L!!😅LoL..
I love Danny so much
This might be the worst artstyle for an animated movie I've ever seen.
i wachd this movie in shool this yera
Man that was a bad movie
I like how Danny talks about Marmaduke like he’s a new character concept
"...this family has suffered so much as the hands of this... sorry, at the "paws" of this dog..." I don't know why this made me fully cackle like a cartoon witch but here we are. 👌
The “bouncing egg” walks EXACTLY like Nikocado and I’m wheezing
Can't believe no one made the joke "Marma-dukey"
I don't know why it feels like they were trying so hard to make the dog act like Scooby-Doo.
dude guy is a world class trainer of course he speaks dog
marmadude commits a war crime and dies
As soon as it came out, I watched it and after I finished watching it, I am mediately looked up Marmaduke reviews.
do the amazing bulk
All I could focus on was how great Danny’s hair is omg
I like how this movie acts like it's the dog's fault for being bad behaved while it's the family's fault for not putting enough effort, patience and time into his dog training.
How did danny not talk more about the thick mom like I (a master of  the art of the Pixar moms) will not accept this like she's a honey mommy r2depresso espresso mommy but looks like a mbl2 honey mommy ⁶espresso (for you people that's a morgz's mom tried to draw herself thicc) which is so unimpressive my god-
marmaduke is already a live action film... why animate it?????
This movie is like if the background characters in despicable me had their own B plot
Not sure if danny's gonna notice but I think the link in the description for expressvpn is wrong
When marmaduke died I just turned of the tv when I saw there was more time. That is now my canon ending
It’s giving Goat Story
Me who thought this was a spin-off or sequel to babadook: 🤡
3:23 the barbecue just fucking explodes and I haven’t seen anyone say anything about it
danny accidentally putting "and" in the expressvpn url instead of after it
marmaduke more like marmaduck the way pete davidson got a big bill for this movie haha get it?
the trampoline scene genuinely bothers me
The new king fu panda movie or whatever it is looks different from the original three movies
they make bad movies because they'll still earn good money from them. people will watch, they get money, people talk about them online prompting others to watch it, they get money. these producers will make the smallest budget possible yet still make big bucks.
I actually screamed nooooo!! When marmaduke didnt die
4:04  Seriously? This shit movie has the AUDACITY to put in a subtle reference to the man with no name movies? Funny how those came out over 60 fucking years ago yet theyre better than this piece of shit movie lmao
love the greg pillows
this is the kind of film that would be playing in the showcase TV's.
at the competition he made a new chernobyl
my 6 year old brother insisted on watching this movie so my mom put it on.. it was just about the worst movie I've ever seen, and that says a lot considering how much this kid watches that makes no sense
I think marmaduke was already a movie but it was live action and pretty good, this on the other hand….
😭
Nice video drew!
some of the characters remind me of betty spaghetti. some of the other characters remind me of horrors beyond man’s comprehension. there is no in between.
You can’t watch a movie named “Marmaduke” and expect it to be good
I just paused at 18:10…
I just googled it and marmaduke was actually a live action movie in 2010 the movie covered is a animated version
They’ve adopted “The Producers” business model, next up on Netflix, _Springtime For Putin!_
why is this even a question
Maybe google how being gassy works. But also this movie sucks.
The animation style is so eerie and bad. Like all of the characters look boarderline horror game-ish, and all of the textures and lighting look like something from a video game that hasn't finished rendering
I actually did laugh bc my dog pooped a single nugget on the couch next to my head while I was asleep the other day. Like wtf pup
Hello fello Greg’s ✋
My four year old would find this absolutely hilarious...funny enough kids think shit and farts are hilarious xD
marmaduke is already a contender for worst movie of the millennia
Words cannot describe how much I don't like the trophy scene. It feels SO fetishy and I can't believe it was actually animated by professional animators
danny's hair is perfection, love the waves & highlights
Philadelphia
another bad rap song starring a dog
okay this is down atrocious, butttt the real life Marmaduke us actually good
this is the best video danny has ever made
netflix has become the direct to DVD of this generation 😅
Marmaduke was a weird cg live action kinda movie I think. I remember watching it as a kid!
i watched the first 10 minutes of this movie, and opted out before my mental health deteriorated.
Short answer: Yeah probably
Great Danes live an average of 8-10 years.   That's all. Great video, Danny.
Marmaduke live action is honestly the best movie ever I watched it so much bc we always went on road trips and stuff as well as glee
I loved it when Marmaduke said "it's marmin' time!"
So I walked up to my brothers while they we’re watching this movie, saw the talent show disaster scene, and immediately turned on something that isn’t as terrifying, like Coraline.
I actually don't think its too farfetched to say a lot of these movies are trying to be the next morbius, or end up in a Danny Gonzalez video to get their traction. Almost all netflix movies aren't going to be large commercial successes regardless of how good the movies are, so netflix and the studios are just banking on social media virality.
I put this movie on for my little sister because she loved the original Marmaduke, I will apologize for my crimes
0% on rotten tomatoes is insane 😭
That’s a very scooby doo looking dog
anyone who bullies a dog is whack. like its a dog
I think u must watch The Beast it's 👁️👄👁️
I'm sorry, I have to disagree with Danny that there's nothing good about this movie cus "Scooby Poo" made me chuckle 😆
7:45
He got the Greg pillows
Netflix doesn’t make the movies they just fund them.
Marmaduke could have won the talent competition if he incorporated the daddy drawn carriage 🙄
watching this while eating was the worst decision of my day
Danny you kinda look like the dad
The fact that my mom made me watch it with her
*bowling alley ass graphics*
I watched this while eating pasta salad and I thought the movie would end when he farted in the trophy 💀
Scooby-Doo, what the FUCK happened to you
My 6 year old watched this for 20 minutes. And came in my room to tell me some cartoon was freaking him out.
THE ENDING AND THE OH OH I'M DEAD
Woof
Spread the gospel god loves you so as jesus love you all and goodnight and I have a great day today and I pray that you Spread the word of God amen to that God bless you and repent for your sins and prayers for Ukraine and don't let temptation ever overcome you be strong against temptation guys love you all and goodnight and repent asap 💖 😘......
daniel knew exactly what he was doing putting us under his desk during the sponsor bit. i have never been so focused in my life.
I had to watch this movie while babysitting so I can confirm at least two children have watched this film and they were enjoying tf out of it while i sat there like 👁👁
I was eating this during lunch… I’m glad I finished before the… incident with the green cloud
I remember seeing the live action Marmaduke in cinemas over a decade ago and for some reason I always mix up Marmaduke and Marley & Me so whenever one is mentioned I always think this comedic movie about this wacky dog ends with him being put down (spoilers for Marley & Me I guess sorry)
Wait until he sees morbius
my dog is better.
Danny? Ik u probably  won't see this comment but can y do a review  on the movie snow queen? On yt there's a VERY bad but funny snow queen if u go on a TV and look  in "movies" you can find it its very funny pls do that
not gonna lie, the really skinny thin character designs are kinda fun to me? i love overexaggerated body types its very interesting. the rest of the movie sucks (except for the fact that there is a clown. i love clowns) but i do like those silly proportions!
13:21 justin chad flashbacks
can we all just talk about how absolutely stunninglygorgeous Danny's hair look 😩
clips from the new pinnocio movie? danny the movie isnt that new anymore
the bulldog stole the show
This is a crappy weirdly plotted rip-off of the OG Marmaduke. Was their budget that low to create this movie, or did they spend it all to get Pete Davidson...
Did you lose weight or did your nose get bigger?
Jesus, the dog looks like it will snap in half any moment.
I have a theory, it might be the same thing like Uwe Boll's tax trick with videogame movies. He purposely made them bad, so he could write off taxes. Netflix's production associates might be the same
Kurtis would love that fart scene 😷
"This guy named guy who is drew goodens biggest fan" do you mean your biggest fan
14:28 I have spotted two errors with that map  1. Sri Lanka is way to triangular 2. Egypt has the Bir Tawil triangle (which is a part of the Sahara between Egypt and Sudan that neither of them claim).
You should watch the live action Marmaduke it came out before the Netflix version
Man. The original Marmaduke was my favourite movie! This just feels wrong
pete davidson being cast as a dog is interesting
Why the humans built like that?
i think netflix knows that the movies are gonna be horrible but they release them anyway just for us to cringe at.
This movie does not feel real and its honestly instilled me with intense existential dread
Netflix literally fired over half of they’re animators and continue to feed us absolute garbage and when they actually release an animated movie they screw it up and only release something good like once in a while
I think it's just for getting it to be a meme and get attention
This movie is so bad that I didn't even hear jack about it. No trailer, no promotion. Nothing. And when we want a sequel to shows we actually LIKE, Netflix goes "Oh shit, this did well. Let's end it here😊"
Marmaduke was a "sequel" or like a remake of a early 2000 movie wich I loved as a kid
This movie looks like a cut scene out of a GameCube game.
This movie is a good example on why we  should make better kids content rather than any sleazy movie.
watching this movie in class was an acid trip
My siblings watched it✋ I was emotionally scarred, they liked it though
The ai idea might just true
I am convinced that this is actually some grand hazing ritual done by comics/actors, you have to be in at least one terribly shitty movie to move on.
U should totally react to the Zombies 3 movie i can already see u making fun of Disney's latest😂
The Pinocchio movie had to be a joke 1000%
That repeat $1.5 milli is Marmaduke’s monthly drug habit.
Hear me out 17:25
This movie is the animated equivalent to that lady man yelling at the trumpet player who's yelling NO TALENT in the blue button up 🤣🤣
It’s based off a live action dog movie it slaps
Comic strip turned live action movie turned animated movie. We should just let Marmaduke rest 😭
the dog's song looked so familiar to me and then i realized its like the same thing as the titanic rip off one
That was a pretty realistic hole in the wall
i remember loving the 2010 Marmaduke
the mom def went to Dr. Miami
makes me so sad, they totally ruined Marmaduke. watch the 2010 one lol it's so nostalgic. its not very good but its a hell of a lot better than whatever this is
I love your movie reviews they never get old! And I've even seen the poster or thumbnail on Netflix and I like it looks kind of cool. But my theory is with making these bad movies Danny has fallen into a trap which is people now I want to see said movie and buy a subscription or event/buy that movie. For themselves so it might be a marketing ploy. 😏😆
Marmaduke dying would upgrade this movie to a postmodern masterpiece
Apparently this movie had been in production since 2017 and I guarantee that VO was done during lockdown so people didn’t lose memberships or had to pay to get out of contracts. Given this has been in the works since 2017, I bet it was Dragon Ball Evolution type deal where people signed into contracts and then couldn’t get out of it once they realized what a clusterfuck it was.
The age demographic....
marmaduke is completely responsible for the virus on your computer.
Yeah...my 4yo nephew refused to watch Marmaduke
This is the greatest movie of All Time
That animation is so ugly
where’s the… what’s up greg?
"I'm dating a kardashian you think i need this?" I'm rolling on the ground
I was a counselor for a camp and they washed this movie the kids where laughing I am concerned for the next generation
My little sister watched this movie and i had the displeasure of seeing parts of it when passing the living room
I hate that moviiieeee. I told my cousin my opinion and he said he LIKED IT. I am a sucker for movies with animals, especially dogs, but this movie is dogwater. Pun intended.
Netflix is becoming the next CW in producing garbage content, absolutely gross
Jesus this video was hilarious thanks Danny needed this
Danny, I can't believe you actually punched a hole in your wall for a bit...
I don't know if there's a book that came before this that they based the movie off of but if there is, then the book is better. I don't even need to read it. It's better.
This is probably the worst case of pixar mom syndrome I have ever seen lol. Also does she even have a spine??
When I grow up I want to work in the department at Netflix where people come up with the craziest plot points that make as little sense as the reviews those shows and movies then get on IMDB. I don’t know it just sounds kinda fun
I wish you would check out this movie 1Up that Buzzfeed made that on Prime. They try to advertise it as Pitch Perfect with video games. I need someone else to see this. lol
I prefer the 2000s version of marmaduke because it was actually interesting
Still not as ugly animation as Goat Story
My little brother watched this 4 times in a row. It made me want to die.
@5:19 That was unsettling.
I actually thought Danny punched a hole in his wall for a second
week two of trying to be acknowledged as truly greg
The characters look like they’re built like the ants from a Bugs life Like I legitimately could snap their limbs
If the dog actually died at the end it would just confirm the theory that he is absolutley a villain of a dog ( very bad boy). Basically that would mean that after he was beat up and tortured both fizically and mentally  (when he was trained and later blamed for the family's bankruptcy) he made up his mind to take revenge on the familly by running away ( I suppose they were worried) , and then letting them get filled up with hope when he comes back and competes , just to put an end to it all in the most dramatic way posible. Yes. It was his plan all along. The only way to make his owners feel the same pain as him.    So I guess just don't beat your dog    ( english is not my native language so I am very sorry  for any mistakes, I did not mean to butcher your beautifull language)
notifications onnn! am i truly greg yet??
The fact that Zeus is voiced by JK Simmons is just insane to me
Can we please talk about the daddyboy shirt
imagine finding out your favorite sunday funny is a movie and it’s this
Too bad this came out when it did when Netflix just made the worst Resident Evil show imaginable, would have been good to mention
I’m the words of MM “shit’s baffling”
6:12 - DUKES, Danny, not deuces!  I think you're mixing it up with throwing up deuces, two fingers, giving the peace sign.  (Not that it really matters, lol)
no danny i'm not leaving your desk. this is where i live now
It sucks because Marmaduke is a good comic from a small creator with a bad movie.
Just like u were wishing to roll credits, i was wishing for u not to make a dog song of ur own, but my wish was granted
'Kick the dog' is actually a writing term. It's the opposite of 'save the cat' which translates to 'do something to make the audience/reader like you'.  So guy just did the exact opposite of what he was supposed to do.
:/ someone had a kink making this movie...      And I'm all for it >:)  :,( jk I'm mentally broken now.
my brother has watched this movie probably over 100 times :')
9:59 wait what?! 👀👀👀
8:57 When you're so bored making your movie that you have to put your fetish into it and don't even bother trying to hide it
Danny I went 2 months without knowing this movie existed.
Gotta show some dogs who's boss fam
“He is drew gooden’s biggest fan.”
The live action marmaduke is better
Day 1 of telling Danny to watch the absolute most hideous animated movie FoodFight that has its release in 2012
Danny, your hair is gorgeous
Æœlbørt
Did not think I'd live long enough to see danny gonzalez bark at me
i cant believe they remade marmaduke but made it way worse 👨🏿‍🦲
I played this movie for the kids i babysit and we got 15 minutes into this it and i was like “man this movie is really bad” and turned it off
no bc there is a god version of marmaduke and it was amazing :[[[[ it was like 2001 - 2004 or smth
Commenting for the algorithm. Nice video Danny!
My teacher put this on 😃. The  best part is that I had popcorn with it, the movie? No.
this whole movie looks like a 2000s gif
That editing was so good I genuinely thought Danny put a hole in his wall 💀💀💀
Cool
the original movie was actually one of my favorites as a child and like was genuinely very funny at certain points looking back on it still but the fact that this exists makes me so sad
Not gonna lie, the absolute worst part of this movie was the ending song by Pete Davidson. I hate that man.
A timeline… I could make a timeline showing where it all went wrong. Or was it all wrong to being with. Perhaps this was their plan all along. Perhaps they are failing and want to make it seem as if they are failing on purpose. Questions. I have many questions.
Clicked this faster then when my girlfriend texts me
i am greg.
I blame these sort of movies on the financial problems Netflix has been having lately. Glad Danny is here for them though.
Clicked so fast
i’m proud of u, you tried your best and the video turned out great. good job danny 🫶🏾
Guys i found random comment who gave 5/5 star rating to marmaduke movie its not me This movie gave me a tingling feeling that only my uncle can give me. It was so refreshing to watch a beautiful work of art that this movie is after this horrible year so far for cinema. I truly think the only bright spots this year for cinema were this masterpiece and the amazing Morbius.     This movie has some of the quirkiest and goofy jokes i’ve ever heard that had me laghing and giggling all night long. Especially when Marmaduke farted the many times that he did I just couldn’t stop giggling. The animation was so high quality I completely under stand the 6 morbillion bit coin they spent on it.   I applaud Netflix and Pete davidson for making Marmaduke come to life from the screen. I kid you not I could smell the farts from the screen every time he farted and they were so good. I have rewatched this movie 689 time since it’s release and it was amazing every time. 100/10 must watch! (What kind of moron like this movie?)
In such stark contrast to this, I would like to highlight an absolutely gorgeous Netflix original movie; The Sea Beast! I watched it the other night with my family and it’s so heartfelt and wonderful, the character designs are diverse and stunning, the animation style and rendering is beautiful and the plot is refreshingly solid for a family-friendly movie! It’s directed by a Disney veteran who was at the company for 25 years I believe and I 100% recommend it, it’s just a really good movie!! I need to watch it again to catch all the details the characters and the environment have. GO WATCH THE SEA BEAST
Lmaooo I watched this a while ago it’s foul to say the least
I don't know what Danny is talking about, this is the best movie ever. There's a person named Guy in this movie. That is the pinnacle of comedy.
I was having such a bad time but thank you for just posting when I needed to see you the most Danny. Love you!
Yes they are
had to watch the first 20 minutes.. my cat enjoyed it and then got distracted and walked off.. first time i was happy she stopped cuddling me and walked off :,)
Me watching this video to see if Danny mentions that Marmaduke was a fucking comic strip that was in the newspaper, back when people still read those 🤣
they dont care
That movie was hot garbage
The character models looked like they tried to Despicable Me or other Illumination films, but then just gave up so it looks like one of those off brand rip offs.  I miss the original live action Marmaduke movie. I loved dog movies as a kid regardless of their quality and that was my favorite for a while. It made me want a Great Dane so bad :) I still love Great Danes a lot to this day.
Actual dog trainer here. I’m science based and use positive only (no shock collars, intimidation, lock in a kennel for ‘punishment’ and more I don’t want to explain.)   when you said ‘what thrill did the trainer get out of kicking the dog?’ I sad laughed because a lot of well known trainers that don’t get taken seriously in our world use Alpha Theory that was disproven 30 years ago (cough cough Cesar Milan. 🙄)   they don’t know what they’re actually doing and don’t fully understand the how’s and why’s so they refer to tactics like this. Do they work? Technically. But I mean if you bully your child to stop doing something enough they’ll stop doing it. Or you know… you could teach them what you want them to do. Just an idea. Are these outdated methods correct or fair or respectful or necessary? Absolutely not.   I guess what I’m getting at is that the aggression towards the dog seemed like a metaphor for what actually happens unfortunately even if it’s not literal dog kicking. It’s still a reference too ‘I’m better than you dog so you better listen to me no matter what. I don’t care about your history or background or personality because me human, me right.’   Also going to tell you a very important concept from science based dog training, ‘never blame the learner.’   If they aren’t understanding something we don’t think they are stubborn or dumb. we pause and check what we are doing and adjust that. Full respect for the animal at all times.   Oh and most importantly, according to Broad City dogs that look like Zeus are called Judith Light.
Hey i watch this movie like last month i did not like it that much but my sister loved it 1:02 also they are 5 and 7 so they are kids and they watched it(no hate btw)
Kanye and Pete Davidson Collab coming soon with those bars he spitting
To be fair, once, my friend got a ticket for her dog being off leash when she dropped it to grab the leash of her boyfriends dog. A few moments later as we were walking away, along the sidewalk, her dog took a fat shit right in front of the police station. And I thought that was a good one. Only positive poop story I think I have.
You want to see a bad movie? Sneakerella on Disney plus. It’s a male Cinderella sneaker story 😂
Your bark caught my dog's attention from across the room so good job.
I prefer the live-action version :/
The teachers made me and my class watch this in school and some people said it was good but I was cringing the whole time
so is no one gonna mention that this is not an original story? i remember marmaduke being a movie in the early 2010s about a wacky dog. it was a live action tho
Isn't there a comedy ish movie called Marmaduke with a real dog? I didn't watch it but seems they took that whole movie and animated it badly. Idk though lol
My name is literally Greg
The 2d drawings are the best parts of the movie.
Damn, Pete sounds so uninterested, I wouldn't have known it was even him.
i saw your name in the credits of thor whats that all about
The poor animators 😭
I feel like this is what a cocomelon movie would look like.
The idea that Guy is BARKING at Marmaduke to communicate in public is hilarious 😭
More like marmadookie
WERE YOU INVOLCED WITH THOR
WHY WERE YOU CREDITIED ON THOR
Marmaduke was already a movie...and it was live action it was cool
Well they make bad comedy specials on purpose... 👀
the most movie ever
Isn’t marmaduke an old comic?
I saw Marmaduke when I was a kid and this is just....I have nothing to say it's bad
iconic
Slayed
ToyStory out here looking photoreal while this movie looks worse than Shrek 1! Someone made this whole movie in Blender 2.9 using a Thinkpad
wait that was a really good bark danny
Who wants to see Danny watch a good movie like an actual Pixar movie
How does Danny swear without sounding like he’s swearing ??!?
Marmaduke was a funny long standing comic about a goofy Great Dane. How dare they
Marmaduke is based on a comic I think. As someone who has an extremely naughty dog, (he's a bit violent too) this movie is very annoying.
The animation of this movie is painful to watch
Yeah... But is it better than Morbius? Hell yeah!
Bro made that dog show more radioactive than Chernobyl.
Idk
And they just made resident evil too which is pretty bad
Mild conspiracy theory: Marmaduke was a newspaper comic in the 50s. They only made the movie to hold onto the copyright for this dog despite no one caring about this character in the slightest
Man I perfer the original movie, it was so much better.
imagine animating a dog farting so big its deadly
couldnt it just be that they are making money off of people paying to check it out on netflix?
Tbh this is the kind of role Pete Davidson deserves
i actually found my baby brother watching this movie and i was just disgusted
Marmaduke can communicate just with the dog trainer because he's the only one who's British. I guess in this cartoon British people are not only real, but have this special power as well.
I like how Danny pretends like guy isn't his own biggest fan. He's so humble 😍
This is so  boring
The absolute SLANDER this movie is to the og Marmaduke
the market is saturated with garbage, reboots, live-action copies and gross sequels. It's like they know that as long as they get a big-name actor nothing else matters. Like they what you will about them, but Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Twilight, etc. had a totally different feel to them, and I think it's because the people making them actually cared. It was about creating art, a legacy and a fan base. now they just pump out trash movies with no real value and hope that they break even.
Bouncing egg 😭
ealtuytre
Bro they ruined marmaduke. They even kept the bee thing so this is def like a rip off by the same conpany
I think the real tragedy here is the absolute trashing of a classic American cartoon character. Marmaduke was a daily cartoon strip that ran nationwide in the biggest newspapers for decades...It's like if they did a Peanuts movie were Charlie Brown was a mean lil' Asshole who shot and ate Snoopy or something....Atrocious, I'm pissed!
Man shout-out to the comic strips on the news papers when Marmaduke was in his prime
this is so strange because there was already a live-action rendition of marmaduke that was much more successful and beloved by all. what possessed them to make this movie? why ruin the legacy
7:07 masochism
Hello Danny and fellow Gregs how was everyone’s day today
me and my class watched this on the last day of school and nobody liked it 😂
I saw the thumbnail and thought this was one of those low-budget bootleg movies, but no, this was made by a big company and starred a fairly big celebrity
Zeus the fnaf animatronic dog. look at the jaw
I started watching Marmaduke a while ago and I couldn't finish it. It's truly a horrible movie.
"Pixar mom Syndrome" 😂😂😂
This is the movie of all time.
No way this wasn’t made in the early 2000s by a nobody studio
did my man just say "put their deuces up"?
Marmaduke is definitely THE movie of all time. I truly felt it when Marmaduke said “It’s Marmaduking time!” And marmaduked into his final form. Zeus’ backstory and his epic duel with Marmaduke before Marmaduke fucking dies was heartwarming and touching, and the plot twists showing Marmaduke was actually responsible for Chernobyl and the 2011 Japan Earthquake had me shriveling up into a raisin just like Marmaduke.
XD
this movie looks like a knockoff that came out in 2008
I remember watching the original Marmaduke when I was younger… oh how the mighty have fallen
Why does Cocomelon have higher production quality than Netflix?
I just had bet with myself if my friend comes to movie with me i will watch your video and now i am 😭🤝🏻✨ you are lucky
those characters look like human veggietales
They're literally making the stupidest shit ever and somehow it keeps getting worse with each one. Also my brothers love this movie for some damn reason
Hello, Danny. I couldn't help but notice the title of this video. The answer is yes.
The song marmaduke raps at the end still got nothing on the dog from titanic
Ok so I haven’t gone through the comments because im lazy and dont feel like doing it but if anyone here has seen marmaduke like the actual one its actually a good movie
There’s no way they aren’t setting out to make bad movies. If anyone on that team thought at any moment that they were making quality content, they should find other means of employment.
I want to remind you that the Bone Animated Series on Netflix died for this.
YES
the live action marmaduke was funny 😔😔😔
Why does the thumbnail look off? It looks...lifeless
A -6 is very generous tbh
I have serious issues with Pete Davidson. Anything with him in it is an immediate no from me. He ruins everything he touches.
DID YOU ACTUALLY PUNCH A HOLE THROUGH YOUR WALL???????
Bam nice video
Oh my god even the animation was horrible
I feel like they realized how much popularity Riverdale got for being terrible that they decided that that was the way to go instead of just... making enjoyable shows people want to see. Like they've just been putting out the worst garbage that you honestly need to see to believe so they've still got a subscriber base, but it's just such a shame that they've valuing clout for being terrible over making actual media art that people would want to see and enjoy.
This is how I imagined Pete Davidson before the double Ks
Hello cloudy with a chance of meatball dad
Bro my younger cousin has marmaduke downloaded on his iPad on Netflix 💀
My parents made me watched that 😭
Ive seen it. My teacher put it on in English class.
I get so damn excited when I see you posted
The original marmaduke is a lapdog who just wants to love on his humans and eat, ya know, dog stuff. He isn't trying to win or beat anyone up. He's a big marshmellow who thinks he is a Pomeranian.
there was a film called marmaduke with a real dog in it and it was actually kinda good this pains me to see such a bad film
There an live action movie which is better than the cartoon one it was made before the cartoon one
why was pete davidson in this fucking movie lmao
@Danny the sponsor link in the bottom is messed up I think it’s cuz there is no space between the link and the word and
I hate this movie but I love when the dogs tail shapes into a heart 😭
God, it's like the animation is caught halfway between Despicable Me and Food Fight.
I watched the live action Marmaduke as a little kid (at my older brother's friend's sleepover, cause it was the 2000s) and I loved it, but in hiendsight it was at least this bad
Congratulations marmaduke u just made mustard gas
Marmaduke is definitely a member of Craig (for the uninitiated Craig is the rival family to our family, GREG. The strongest, and fastest growing army on youtube-don’t look it up though cus Craig hacked every browser and put a bunch of lies on the internet!!)
i’m so earlyyyy
Dearest Danny Gonzalez, I’ve been subscribed to your YouTube for about a year now and I am always excited to see you post because it always makes my day better. PS, where did you get that shirt?
Badoovies?!
Danny is the perfect youtuber to have on in the backround
I'm absolutely cackling at how absurdly disgusting and nonsensical this movie is
“And it is in fact the worst movie you’ll see this year.” It won’t be, because I will definitely not watch it.
All of the characters look like they need a few dates. Their bodies are so messed up
Why the hell would they pin everything Marmaduke does wrong on him? The family clearly never trained him and then the moment he does something he doesn’t understand is bad, they punish him and PAY someone to abuse him instead of teach him. I know it’s just a dumb kids movie that very few people are going to see but it makes me so angry that this movie is perpetuating the belief that yelling at or hitting your dog for doing something bad is going to teach them good behavior.
Yes. Bad movies dont mean unsuccessful movies. Even I see some trash from time to time just to clear my mind. This was the destiny of Netflix anyway, and honestly of all streaming services, D+ is already there, there is a lot of trash that the acquired through Fox for example.
I've watched this new marmaduke but the original is absolutely WAY better
They managed to make the live-action Marmaduke with Owel Wilson look *good* by comparison.
Apparently in greek mythology zeus was really into orgys or something similar
17:23 Another clip for "Danny Gonzalez without any context"
As an English bulldog owner, there's no way that bulldog would lift up that building, let alone go to a dog competition. Bulldogs are so lazy, mine won't even get on the couch without me having to lift her up and my couch isn't that high off the ground. I have a couch cover since I have two dogs who love getting up there. She barely gets up to go to the bathroom! She is such a couch potato! She will get up to go for car rides though but when we get back home She is huffing and puffing and then sleeps heavily like she ran a marathon! She's such a baby but I love her! My other dog is a black lab I rescue when I saw him tied up in an empty lot. He was huge and got excited seeing me which made me leary at first but his demeanor looked friendly so I approached and he dragged me back home! I was on a long walk. He's my big handsome boy now. It was meant to be!
Danny can you wish me a happy birthday
Great video! Never fails to make me laugh
whach the original marmaduke
FIRST
This movie really destroys the Marmaduke lore established in the 2010 film. How will the MCU (Marmaduke Cinematic Universe) ever survive?
Fun Fact: Marmaduke is actually based off of a comic strip by Brad Anderson. It's widely considered one of the worst comic strips ever. So I guess the film adaptation doesn't fall far from the tree
Why does Zeus look like Thrandruil from lord of the rings lol
The thing is Netflix doesn’t have money like Disney and Amazon to make/buy good shows so they just buy cheap stuff to feel up there library
You know you failed when the live action movie is better than you
That dog looks like Scooby Doo
18:23 CEASAAAAAAR
Animated talkin Animals with human teeth Eww 😬
dannie boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
This dog is a menace. No sympathy at all ✋🏻
The Sad thing is, there is a Live action movie that is also Called Marmaduke, which came before this Animated Verson, and I actually liked the Live action Marmaduke, I thought it was decently Funny and it had a good message behind it and it had good actors, it even had George Lopaz in it, Idk how well the Original movie actually did but I actually kinda Enjoyed the Original movie, this Animated verson is a Complete Abomination  Edit: In the Original Movie when Marmaduke Spoke the Human characters would only hear barking tho other animals would actually understand Marmaduke
Hello dannnn                           yyyy
Wait wasnt there like a live action film that came out waayyyy before this film?
I've watched marmaduke before and it was a live action movie not an animation. And it was definitely not like this 😐
Me: *needs to be productive * Also me: wait a new danny gonzalez video?!?!
Hello Dan man
Hi Danny! 👋
The villian dog is a rip off from the villian bird from Rio.
all i know about pete davidson is that they shill smart water even tho i got a tap at home
Questions- why are their legs so skinny, they are literally walking toothpicks.
All I know about Marmaduke is that my dad said it was like a comic strip in the newspaper. I know that he watched it with my younger siblings and my younger siblings said they liked it. but they’re also ages range from 3 to 5 so they literally like everything and hate everything that’s where they are but I haven’t heard what my dad says about it
Heads up Danny Boi, the URL in the description is wrong  It's a pretty obvious fix, but some very non-tech-savvy and extremely impatient people might immediately give up when it doesn't work on the first try.
You should watch better movies Like RRR Unironically best movie on Netflix
fat marmaduke makes me so upset
I watched this movie a month ago while babysitting my 4 year old nephew and this helps explain to his parents why he is traumatized and scared of dogs
My sister loves this movie (she’s not 3, she’s 10) And I’ve watched this terrible movie multiple times, I keep telling her that this movie sucks and she always says “that’s your opinion” and I say “but this movie is bad, that’s not an opinion, it’s literally a fact that it’s bad, the animation is bad and the jokes are bad and everything else is bad.” But she won’t listen to me after I say that lol, I can’t wait to show her this movie in a year or 2 and she’ll see how bad it is
help, why's this so funny though
Danny, your subreddit has devolved into a cesspool. Pls send help. r/dannygonzalez has fallen
We got to watch this in class and we laughed our asses off the whole time
This movie is a ripoff of live action Marmaduke which was a good movie
Der käse🧀💅👁👄👁
YAY
I watched this movie with my little brother and he genuinely almost cried in the middle of the movie. We had to turn it off
I enjoyed the original marmaduke, it’s not amazing or anything but still decent. I was a little excited for the remake until I saw the trailer. I must say, I am glad it got 0% on rotten tomatoes
Netflix remade an already bad movie to a worse movie
How would I know about all these bad movies if Danny doesn’t watch them for me 🥺🙏
That’s a shame that the creators of Marmaduke can’t catch a break. The comic strip isn’t that bad but they have two awful movies added to their belt.
On top of all this the animation is awful 🤮
Marmaduke? More like Marmadoo-doo hahaha!
I don't think I've laughed at hard at anything as I have your videos the last few days.  I'm outside your normal demographic probably but my teens showed me your videos and I've been laughing for days.  A new Greg for life here.
Daddy boy?
Capitalism. That’s why Netflix is doing this
we watched this as a family night movie (my siblings are like, 6 and 8) and even they thought some details in this were bad. but they kind of enjoyed it but this is a worse remake of an already bad live action movie so idk
Marmaduke's character design and animation looks like one of those YouTube videos for kids to learn their colors.
A little bit ironic that you’re bullying a man for his nose proportions :)
Great points here Drew
Netflix is like cantaloupe it's not good, unless you can't taste.
I hate this , the original marmaduke wasn't the best but I liked it and it's way better than this shit.   The OG marmaduke was live action and honestly it wasn't like buddy level but it was good, please go watch the original its so much better
the image of pete davidson standing in a recording booth going "i gOtTa gOO!!!" is just....disappointing for humanity
I’ve never laughed as hard at a YouTube video
only people who like marmaduke are caustic mains
imagine if they played "champion by kanye" in a skete Davidson movie
Okay but the clips you showed of marmaduke getting beat up made me laugh out loud
the angle of the ad read is making me feel some typa way
0:11 I feel like this is the only good part...
I'm pretty sure they are making bad movies on purpose. They know they will profit no matter what they make, so they'd rather put out a bunch of garbage then put an effort on a few good movies
I'm pretty sure that these movies are being made on purpose, because people on the internet like talking about bad movies, almost as much as very good movies. So I'm sure there is some money in the negative attention.
"Sees mom from Marmaduke" Everyone: here comes in the fan art!
oh
Rich British guys, am I right?
Danny about the trainer: he's actually not that bad. Literally 2 minutes later the trainer's committing animal abuse.
Am I the only one who actually liked Marmaduke? Like I know it's bad but it's so bad it's good.
im greg
M
this is why you should watch the sea beast !
It’s not just the animated movies. Netflix’s adaptations of Cowboy Bebop and Resident Evil are trash fire too. I have zero hope for their One Piece series they have planned.   I’m convinced their goal is to just burn through all their money by making literally every script that comes across the executive’s desks.
5:20, something funny is that my favorite animated show on Netflix has a rich, British villain
I think Netflix just mass produce movies at random, I heard the Sea Beast isn't that bad
This is actually based off of a live action movie that I loved when I was little… don’t know if it holds up tho lol
"clips from the new Pinocchio movie" probably will hold up well, since Disney is busy again with their remakes.
why did we not question the name marmaduke
Did they actually do a movie worst then Foodfight?!  Looks like they used same team to animate it.
Can you do a video about cobra
Aint no way no one else noticed what the clown was making 2:14
Bruh a few days ago I watched a movie on Netflix called like Prince Charming, and it is so weird. Literally one of the scenes was so horrifically just cursed it’s ingrained into my memory. Highly recommend if you wanna rethink your entire life decisions 10/10
You ever see The Producers?
I got in trouble in my freshman year of highschool for downloading the script of the marmaduke movie from back then, they called me into the office and read excerpts of marmaduke to me with blank stares waiting expectantly for me to explain why I had something so inappropriate but it was just a kids movie without visual context
Probably a money laundering/tax write-off/other kind of financial fraud/scheme. A platform like Netflix guarantees at least a return on their investment and they can pump out shitty movies for next to nothing, write off all their expenses, and basically make free money.
why do people design dogs with labia lips? then add giggle physics to them?
the art style is worse than those fake cocomelon channels
I dont know if you how the internet works, but a VPN will hide literally nothing from your ISP
Why is this the second movie Danny has talked about that has a a scene of a bipedal dog rapping?
Marmaduke was the villain
After seeing the photo for the yuyu Hakusho I'm certain this video title to be accurate
I'd like to imagine this whole movie is a very abstract SNL skit with Pete Davidson
There is this kung fu panda rip off coming to theaters and it looks like a B movie rip off that you would make a vid on
The concept that Guy is just standing there intermittently barking at Marmaduke is too much for me, I love it
Companies in general just seem to think consumers are ignorant lately, it's pretty insulting. They do the bare minimum just to make money. Capitalism is destroying art, truly. And everything else
i hate when companies get in on making fun of themselves to make money. i am laughing AT you not WITH you
Danny, why didn't you shout out Kurtis when talking about Pinocchio. He's your friend, no? He put a lot of effort into his video.
The new pixars movie i think the name İs magic academy rocks
I’ve been waiting for someone to talk bout marmaduke it was such a weird movie so bad it made me laugh
The 2010 Marmaduke was decent though (from what I recall as a preteen)
We just got a puppy, this is the training video I didn't know I needed! Turns out I simply didn't have enough pools with sharks 🦈
The dead blue birds were a coded message. Marmaduke is gonna destroy twitter and save us all for it's venomous grasp.
danny stop please wake up you arent a youtuber you are in bank rupcy please daniel i miss you you arent a super hero stop saying stuff you are mine you are my dog you arent greg you didnt watch this marmadude movie your going crazy
Your baby face is slowly fading away. Finally looking like an adult.
I remember the live action Marmaduke. Daycare played it too many times. The "BEE!!!!" and dog party scene lives rent free in my head
These reviews are everything 😂
has anyone noticed that thw both of the kids have blonde hair but the parents have brown hair
This movie looks like a movie that would be made outside of the united states in 2005 that has a large celebrity cast in its english dub and then becomes lost media
Why would they keep the trainer, he wasn’t helping why pay him?
Bro what kind of dog is this-
i love how disappointed danny looks in the thumbnail
mistakeinsociety : the movie
My class had actually watched this whole movie. Everyone’s eyes were glued to the screen. We were all forced to watch it because she thought it was amazing 😕
if you want a rare good netflix movie outlier i recommend the sea beast
You see, unfortunately, my 4-5 year old niece was watching this and we got to the scene where he starts shitting in the golden cup before we turned it off
PLEASEE MY MOM WORKS AT AMU (company behind the movie) AND SHE MADE ME WATCH IT AND SHE WAS SO HAPPY ABOUT IT AND LAUGHING AND I WAS JUST. I WAS JUST SITTING THERE LIKE "that's nice dear"
Man I understand not using the comic's ugly-ass art style but why did they have to make an equally ugly new art style
shitty doo wouldve been funnier and more accurate to middle schoolers
Cinematic History Fact! They did this exact same thing in the mid 1900's Where major studios would throw out low budget movies, "B Movies " at an incredible rate in order to gain a steady stream of income. I'm talking about Studios vomiting out around 50-ish movies a year, (which roughly amounted to 7,500 movies in the span of 15 years during Hollywood's golden age). In terms of storyline, they were almost reduced to a formula; in essence, all of these movies are basically the same, which allowed them to be thrown out. ("Mr Smith Goes to Washington" Is a prime example of the whole 'hero's journey' plot structure that's still used today)            [Edit: Legit feel bad for the Animator homies that have to work on stuff like this, I would rather do anything else than rig or animate "Pixar mom-ass" for any amount of time]
This movie scares me…
The fact that  good animation projects get cancelled instead of movies like these is super upsetting. Netflix really needs to do better.
Everything about this movie is really uncomfortable to look at.
Marmaduke was made by the studio WonderWorld Studios it only streamed on Netflix. Its not made by Netflix. The Sea Beast was made by Netflix.
Danny please react to Juan Canada Pictures!!!
Omg, I watched this a while ago with my sister, couldn’t get past 1 minute. I absolutely hated it and it’s an insult to the 2010 Marmaduke. I remember thinking Danny needs to make a video on this… Danny… are you a mind reader?
when he doesn’t die “😔☹☹☹😢”
Danny is just jealous that the bulldog is stronger than him
That movie was dogwater ngl
6:00 thunder.. and..lightning. all I can think of is the NSP song
There was a live action marmaduke made ages ago which I remember being pretty decent
Is it just me or did the writers at some point just say "this movie is so bad the only way to make anyone watch it is to throw some fetishes in here"
Wait, the guy who directed this directed Pixel Perfect
I actually liked Marmaduke.... because it was bad
7:35  “She suffered greatly for deceiving the prince” vibes.
thought the dad said the diggied dogs
I feel like their strategy has been like buzzfeed’s business model, where they just make the most garbage content imanginable just to get people’s attention. No wonder they have lost so many subscribers.
Notifications on.......waiting on the birth certificate fam. 🖤
2010 marmaduke >>>>>> new marmaduke
Oml I remember watching marmaduke when I was younger
i know they didn’t have money to make this shit but they could have at least made a few aesthetically pleasing design choices
One of the worst things about this movie is the voice of the villain, because he has been in a lot of good stuff, you might have heard of him, his name is J.K. SIMMONS      I want to know how he's in this
daddyboy
"farting food" is just shitting
>uwu<
Bad movies
They should have gotten Chet Holmgren to play the dad
yes
Marmaduke more like Marmadookie
guys they yassified pinnochio
Bros gata react to zombies 3
Why does this movie just look like a cutscene out of a really shitty game based on a animated movie from the early 2000s?
Money laundering. 100%
The reason that the fart scene exists in this movie is because one of the writers had a thing for farts. Either that or they must be smoking cocaine or marijuana.
’youre the most famous dog trainer in the world and your secret is you beat up dogs?’ literally caesar milan, hes had actual dog trainers train dogs after him to fix the trauma he gave them iilluminaughtii has a great indepth video on his bullshit
his hair is like perfect???
This movie looks so hideous, I don't even care about fart jokes or dumb plot, the way characters are drawn is so ugly, it's food fight level character design
There is a live action version of Marmaduke
I actually know why they do this. companies have a thing called "esg rating" and so netflix has to make movies to higher their score and good movies don't really help.  (this is a lot more complicated and  this is only kinda what I know of the top of my head, you can make your own research.)
They just keep wasting money, they got rid of some of the laugh tracks but just throw famous people in there to get people to pay attention.
ratatoing is 10x better then this movie
can somebody tell me Danny’s uplet schedule? literally been binge watching all his videos
Netflix is collapsing so they don’t give a shit anymore
my niece and nephew watched it but they'll watch any garbage
This one's a banger
splendid
I am freaking out about the "Daddyboy" shirt. Where do I get that??
Netflix is a fan of you and this is their only way to get your attention
I sincerely hope Guy is barking. If the movie addressed that, it would redeem it completely.
The rap at the end of this movie is literally the same thing as the one in the Titanic movie where there was also a dog rapping, but this time about it being “party time”
watch velocopastor
why would they make a cartoon Marmaduke like the original was so much better🙄🙄🙄🙄
Have you seen Marmadukes legs? I think his owners are neglecting him.
fun fact: the director for this movie also directed everyone's favorite disney movie, pixel perfect
I mean Marmaduke was a pre-existing character tHey could’ve animated but they totally abandoned the aesthetic from the comic in favor so this overstimulating ugly hellscape
Great video Danny
SIR DANIEL HAS CREATED A NEW MOTION PICTURE FOR THE MASSES
Zeus is jk Simmons how did nobody notice...and then mentioning whiplash in the ad read, I think Danny is playing with us
A few of the proportions are actually similar to the comics, also the antics.
This entire movie looks like a bad mobile game ad
Movies, art, music, human style has all gotten more "ugly" and superficial.. nothing beneath the surface.
I think the dad character carried the whole movie
I think they are just 5 year olds
The animation is fugly mugly suggly tuggly
at 13:21 i had to start telling my dog you weren't talking about her, thank you for making her feel like she ruined our family
I hope your wall is okay Danny
Helllooo? What has gotten into you Drew. You didn’t ask what’s up. So now you don’t even care for your fans? That’s it, I’m going to watch danny instead now. U just loser a subscrpber!!!
A new Greg video? Time to procrastinate for the duration of this new upload.
wait this is netflix- it’s literally so ugly what the fuck
As a kid I watched the live action marmaduke religiously. Why did they have to ruin it.
Wow erglail
Danny, I know you have made fun of guava juice before but he came out with a show that I keep getting advertisements for. You should comment about it.
"what ending song???" "idk man you tell us. hit it."💀💀💀
I don’t like Netflix.
Danny stop acting like you’re not okay with guy beating up marmaduke. We all remember what happened in GTA… those poor cats.
Claim your here within an hour here
In a better movie he cared more about, Pete Davidson would be a great choice for marmadule imo
i used to watch marmaduke as a kid, i had no idea there was an animated one now 💀💀
The original was sooo good
Hi guy
My phone is at 3% on a two hour charter bus and I'm watching danny gonzales
aw i loved the marmaduke comic strip as a kid. they butchered my boy!
Danny you silly goose! You missed the one redeeming quality of this movie, it ends.
i don’t want to dunk on the animal animation since it’s probably not their overworked wand underpaid animators’ fault that the movie looks like… that. but jesus fucking christ
Ur mom
My lil sis thought this was a good movie 💀
Two moments there that I legit though was Danny's edit, but turned out being the show's original edit.
i hate the way the movie looks. everything about it. i love danny's shirt tho. it's cute
“Its the worse movie you’ll see this year” EVEN WORSE THAN MOR BUS
These dogs are super powered
Mashed Potatoes
I feel like Netflix flip flops every so often between having some of the best movies of the year and some of the worst movies of the decade
THIS MOVIE THE LIVE ACTION IS WAYYY BETTER DANNY
I just realized Danny’s shirt says Carhartt I have a Carhartt sweater on right now
Marmaduke is an allegory of greed
Honestly living for the fact that Pete is clowned on for so many reasons that he’s just making the most outrageous creative decisions just to troll people. And honestly who cares if he makes good stuff or not, at this point? The ones who hate him hate him, and the ones who don’t don’t.
I am truly greg
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮this movie is absolutely Marmaduke shit 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Hypnosis exists irl, but you can't make someone do something they truly don't want to do.
They make these movies so they can write them off as Failures for tax reasons.
The first, live action Marmaduke, is so much better. But I might be a bit biased since that movie is so nostalgic for me. I used to watch that shit on repeat, every day. I have no idea why I liked it so much.
It's making bad movies so you can have content
52 min late🥲
Funny. I was just thinking this same thing about Danny’s videos
It's always a good day when Danny posts 🤠
im fat and i confirm, we do be practically just bouncing around
Wow, I saw the face of British guy and the second he showed up I was absolutely sure he was the villain.
I hate this movie. Dogs being treated horribly just hurts my heart even if it's fictional and a cartoon.
istg it's Paramount n some of their ugly ass animated movies like leave the rugrats n spongebob alone
I live laugh love Greg
OK BUT THE ORIGINAL MARMADUKE IS SO GOOOOOD
Nice to know THIS is what the budget goes on, not funding actually good shows
the scenes of Marmaduke "training" and the one before he is convinced to do it strike me as a very poor rendition of the ones in Kung Fu Panda.
this movie is so disgusting and ugly it's making me angry LOL
5:17 sometimes in bad movies the villains will be portrayed as fat and ugly, for instance: "bold eagles" "ozzy: the fast and the furriest", "the nut job"
20:56 It's a mac computer but an LG screen? why?
Is it just me or does it look nothing like Danny in the thumbnail? Am I dumb lol
"the main selling point of this movie is that its good" -Danny Gonzalez
Just waiting for the edits of Danny acting like a dog
It's funny cz a guy in "the croods" movie is also named "guy" lmao
This is a remake of one of my favorite movies and im pissed they did this
Most of these types of movies tend to budget like 60% named actor, 30% overhead costs, and then like 10% for animators and script. And then its a tax right off because it makes nothing
WHY pete davidson whyy ur better than this
My son liked this movie but he’s 4 and also liked spookley so the bar was low for me
netflix is so rich they just want the money
This is so funny 😂
Are you going to react to zombies 3?
a couple months ago i tried watching marmaduke with my cousins but it was so garbage that we ended up quitting halfway through LOL
Watching this movie compared to the original Marmaduke just hurt
i..... regret eating dinner while watching this.
what omg im early
the thing is this movie was made with real people in 2010 and i loved marmaduke. old marmaduke  was my shit.
8:53 WTF IS THAT FACE
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm
You are so funny, you always crack me up?
Why am I under Danny's desk, looking up to him...? :)
Marmaduke is an scp
i genuinely remember watching the trailer for this movie and going "huh. danny should review this"
Marmaduke rapping at the end has the same energy of the dog from titanic the legend goes on, rapping
bout time Danny uploaded again
You should have just cut it towards the end. We didn’t need to know that he survived. Why make us suffer
it’s so crazy that this movie went through so many editors and still got somehow passed
It's been years
convinced that you pay them to make awful movies so you don't run out of content..
After watching this video I got an ad from Pete Davidson telling me to shave my dick.
That Pinocchio movie with Pauly Shore isn't actually a Netflix movie. It's a Russian movie released in the US by Lionsgate. The Netflix one is directed by Guillermo del Toro and comes out in December.
My nephew did watch this movie. He's 5 years old. His favourite passtime is pressing buttons on toys, not even playing with them. This movie still bored him enough to turn it off halfway.
the broken toothpick limbs upset me in ways i cannot begin to articulate
Danny’s video on the movie is better then the whole movie
Netflix trying to capitalize off of that youtube lvl childrens content like cocomelon.
A normal sane person: I hope he's not dead Danny: Please roll credits please roll credits please roll credits
Finally, someone who also thinks Marmaduke terrible. My dad made me watch it and I cringed so hard. I cannot believe my family liked this movie, this movie is the definition of a heart attack.
youre so funny 😂 this video was great! /pos
No one talking about this being a comic strip?
Hi Netflix can you green light my movie where it's a movie and then there's a part that is a film and then I'm radio rebel
I threw up on the floor
Drew Gooden Among Us
is it just me, or does Danny look older on the thumbnail? now instead of 14 he looks 16
wait why did danny actually look old during his sponsorship-
oh look denny gorgonzola posted *clicks*
This feels like a college student's film
Can’t wait to see the lil nutcracker guy Netflix movie!
This is a real movie?
Netflix just loves to ruin og movies
Thank you finally you make another vid
AAAA IM SLIGHTLY EARLY. LOVE YOUR CONTENT. THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO ^^
I watched with my boyfriend and fell asleep 20 minutes in couldn’t tell you a single hung that happened in those first 20 minutes
Genuinely this movie is so ugly
hallo
There is actually a live action movie of Marmaduke. I don't remember if it was actually good, but I sure know it's better than this.
Why are there legs like string? There so thin
Since when did Tobey Maguire have a youtube channel?
I feel like they know these movies suck, hence they release them. They know that YouTubers are gonna make videos about the movies to get more attraction, e.g. you just made a video about the movie which gives it more popularity
POV: this is your first time watching danny and your name is greg. Watches the intro: Wait, how does he know my name?
When Marmaduke had that fight with the trainer I thought he would go all avatar with the fire, air, water, earth because he has 4 paws but no: it’s just thunder and lightning
Netflix went from making the amazing willoughbys movie to making this. Also glad to know the modelers of the Adams family 2019 movies still have jobs.
Jesus as soon as I heard the dogs name was Marmaduke(?) i knew this was gonna be a train wreck
All Propaganda to indoctrinate our kids.
Bro- dat mom tho- 🥵
Marmaduke is actually a live action movie that I watched when I was a kid. I haven watched it in a bit but it was certainly better then this version!
They changed their philosophy to making "watchable" content meaning something you can just throw on in the background or binge. They realized that the high budget critically acclaimed content just doesn't turn a profit.
They all look like human VeggieTales
Short answer: yes
The end song reminds me of that one dog song from the titanic rip off.
I clicked on this so fast. Also is this the same team that did titanic?
On the flip side marmaduke (2010) is the best movie ever made
What’s up Danny! I just wanted to let you know that I am Greg. The original Greg. The only Greg. The first and last Greg. So thank you for dedicating this entire channel to me, I greatly appreciate it
Yo Danny, you should read the reviews on this movie. I am pretty sure most of them are fake but it's freaking hilarious. Also interesting fact J.K. Simmons plays Zeus.
reragerghrh
Ideas of movie review  Tall girl James and the giant peach The parent trap  Enchanto  Senior year  Aladdin  Jessie
Bro why these characters built like stick bugs
Why does the screenshot used in the thumbnail look like something I'd find on the cursed Tumblr tag
There is actually a live action Marmaduke form 2010 and it's sooo much better
This is just if you gave the makers of Ratatoing a Netflix budget
I AM NOT GREG
I watched this movie with my niece the other day and I had to resist the urge to like... send it to you. I'm so glad you were already onboard lol
The sad part is this is based off an old comic strip, and the comic is actually pretty good
Dannys Second Channel: "Unlike the main channel, we like to get a little silly on this channel."  Danny's Main Channel:
pretty sure this is just a cartoon version of the 2010 movie with owen wilson, but like very shitty and thrown on the ground then shat on and then put through the sewers and then taken back out
Is this meant to be an animated sequel to the original Marmaduke film or something?
Hey, are you saying the studio who made 2 tall girl movies and that movie with Addison Rae is bad???
Netflix's business model is quantity over quaility.
I would have put down Marmaduke years ago
Marmaduke is another movie and it’s not animated and I used to watch it all the time
I think Netflix is going for quantity over quality right now. Just churn this crap out, who cares if it's any good.
The art on the family paintings on the walls of the house looks better than anything from the rest of the movie
have not laughed this hard over farts ever i think 👍🏼
You have to admit that while this movie had it's flaws, Marmaduke is still the biggest dog around, the greatest dame in the whole darn town. But his family just doesn't understand and he HAS to eat, it's his command!
I ated a bee
Honestly wouldn't put it past a British person to bark at a dog and understand what the dog says back at them
Hi Danny :)
"Marmaduke is the worst movie you'll see this year" Thor Love and Thunder: You underestimate my power!
the movie was so boring that  I literally want to do anything else to entertain myself
100k views in an hour is insane when you really think about it
I think Netflix is committing suicide
Wasn't this already a movie? It's live-action and not that great but it's way better by comparison
comment for the algorithm
when i was younger, there was a movie called marmaduke and it was a live action video and it was amazing, this is a disgrace to the movie of my childhood.
Doomnny johnflowrez
Thanks for another video Danny! Just hours ago I was thinking, it's been way too long since Danny uploaded. Now I see another video!
i love how Danny's hair looks like a tree top
Why are their limbs like toothpick?
Yes they are
Don’t go to the suspense category of Netflix. Suspense movies have the exact same plot and stupid names.
I’m surprised no one’s brought this up but this movie is based off of a live action movie also called marmaduke, it’s much better and I suggest looking it up on YouTube!
THEY BUTCHERED ANOTHER MOVIE??? THE ORIGIONAL MARMADUKE IS WAY BETTER
They are making movies to appease black rock not their consumers.
here early
this video was really funny danny edit i feel like this sounded sarcastic but i’m being genuine
i remember watching the original marmaduke videos as a kid, why would they do this to me and ruin it like this
Do they even try 😃
My Spanish teacher put this movie on thinking we would like this, side note we did not and so did nobody else 🥲
also i hate everything about how this looks. like objectively the character design is awful and the movements are uncanny
guy gives me vector vibes
as an artist, this movie makes me feel truly disgusted, and i have nothing but pity for the animation team. surely no one who knows anything about art or movement thought this was remotely good.
My 4 year old cousin is obsessed with marmaduke and when he came he visit, he watched that movie 24/7, and I was just like, “what the hell is this movie”
oh my god when phil nibbilink showed up in the credits i lost my mind. that guy did an absolutely insane rendition of puss in boots on its own and his direction really shows in this
you really caught me off guard with that camera angle at the end
i had the audio of the video running without the visuals, so when Danny brought up Marmaduke, I WAS SO OFFENDED but then i realized it was a remake and was vv sad
As I always say, diggidy dang that dog
The character designs remind me of Fanboy and Chumchum.
There’s actually no way people write these movies and produce these movies and think “yeah i think people will absolutely love this movie”
Ikr.
the dumpy on the wife drastically exceeds pixar mom standards
i remember i watched this on Netflix and it sucked so much, i got a literal headache, ruined my whole day, hated it
Danny you need to watch thumb wars. It is the best movie ever
Netflix has not had good stuff that is original in a long time, not counting stranger things
86,000eth
petition for danny to review a movie with a main character named greg
I was born in the 1990s on Proxima Centauri b and I hate the character designs too!
WATCH "FREE BIRDS" PLS
My 5 year old sister watched the dog movie. She liked it a lot. I think they know their demographic
The original Marmaduke is infinitely better than whatever animation murder this was
If I get my ass beat like hardcore and then make a movie with Netflix, I'd say Netflix would be more painful.
I MISSED YOU SM OMG
I cried more when marmaduke died compared to tony starks death in endgame
This is actually an animated reboot/remake of a live action movie of the same title
oml i thought i was early!!!! but good video danny i love ur content
i live in the uk and by the beggining of may The adverts for this movie were popping off  And the movie itself is shitty af
Am early
Okay. Watching this while eating was a mistake...
Can't wait to pirate- oh I meant legally watch this!!!
Hi danny
I do kinda like the style but it's only bcuz I like janky, ugly shit. It's oddly more interesting than anything that looks good, like why tf did they make it that ugly. Entire books could be written about a good artist's decisions they made in their art, but none of them would match the reams of questions bad/ugly art can raise... That being said, the writing sucks
This makes the live action Marmaduke look like a Martin Scorsese picture
Is nobody going to address how Danny punched an actual hole into his wall 🧍
WTF is that alpha and omegeagraphics though
Im one of the 80,000 people who have watched this
Why is the mom so thick?? At first when I saw her with that chest and up angle I thought she would be slimmer but damn
63,385th
DID HE ACTUALLY PUT A HOLE IN THE WALL?! IS HE GONNA ADDRESS THIS ON 2 DANNY 2 FURIOUS?
ive been a greg for years and fr this is the first time ive gotten to a video before and hour ago
You should watch The Sea Beast! It's actually really really wonderful, maybe a good palate cleanser?
Claim your here before an hour ticket here 🥶 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟 🎫 🎟
Danny, I was hoping you were gonna die in the end of the video. Not marmaduke
honestly seems like a horror movie where a dog is terrorizing an innocent family
I mean Netflix just kinda makes movies even if their garbage or not bad Kinda just like that 🤨
im here
19:35 was the peak of dancing skill.
Algo comment
Absolute dump truck on the mom lol
was here early i usually watch these videos whenever i find them but was actively searching for it and was early :)
Ngl the dad kinda looks like danny…..
hi BIG D
Bro I watched this with my little siblings and it’s horrifying
Hi danny
I’m pretty sure some writer for Netflix ripped off the plot of one of my works that was successful a few years back. They’ve changed enough that it’s not super similar, but boy is it way worse.
wow these comments saying their experience with j kild wiggie eating their socks makes me feel so bad for you all :( i hope everything goes well ❤😪
Jfc this art style🤮
I was waiting for this one
A french fry of a dog drops into the pool and it causes a tidal wave
that one scene will never escape my psyche
36 minutes ago 😯😯
You should go and watch moons video on this he explained the reason why Netflix is so bad very well
Netflix is intense, but Takis are SERIOUSLY intense!
This is the movie ever. I watched this and it was such a movie.
Weirdly enough I loved the og movie when I was a kid!
This was made 34 mins ago and already 1.4k comments? DAMNNNNNNNN😳
who is dannu?
There's a live action version of this movie that came out years ago and I used to watch it was my favourite movie and way better than this
HE SAID HELLO GREG INSTEAD OF "WHATS UP" I FEEL CHEATED ON
im actually early????
all this time, drew was talking to a dog trainer and not Guy Fieri?! *I'm living a lie.*
I feel like their universe is the same as the addams family's judging from what they look like
The design of the mom has me in tears
wait did danny break his bloody wall????
Yes
They need as much content as possible to fill every nook and cranny that the algorithm can possibly cover. They need every section of the population to have a reason to pay for Netflix and keep tuning in. They can’t afford for you to lose interest in their service.
are we honestly surprised that pete davidson playing a dog turned out to not be good
IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY OMFG
early
Ah yes, finally we can see Guy, I've always wondered who Drew's one fan was
Even Netflix in India is failing it's so bad hardly anyone watches Netflix originals made for India
The movie is really terrible 😕
danny x greg wattpad fanfic release date?? im waiting
Why just why
So fun fact; Netflix pretty much singled out The Irishman (arguably the best original on their site) and stated that they would never make another movie like it again (despite the fact that it was one of their very best performing movies). They said they would rather try for another red notice (an unwatchable fucking mess of a movie) instead. The company's nosediving.
My Spanish teacher made us watch marmaduke twice in one week
ive never laughed so hard loved the vid.
The Marmaduke comics were usually pretty wholesome and innocuous. Not much happened in them, but they were cute enough. It's insulting to see the character turned into a bunch of gross fart jokes, and I'm not even really a fan.
The fact that animators, writers, editors and so many other people actually worked hard and wasted their time on shit movies like this 💀
Marmaduke chases a bee. M to the B.
Short answer:yes
This is why Pete was fired from SNL
My 1 year old nephew apparently likes this movie and my sister played it for him at my house and dear lord it was awful
claim you 'here within an hour' ticket here
Epic
they are just trying to milk out money out of these movies with no effort
i kinda like this movie and i hate that i do
BOUNCING EGG AWWW
you look so sad in the thumbnail
Hi Danny I’ve been following you for 4 years but please stop now I’m tired of walking
Ok
why does your door move like that?
is this title a reference to the scott cramer cake video
man that ending credit song gave me a stomach ulcer
the beginning is so trippy omg, i actually fell for it
My dog actully did make my family poor because he kept breaking our fence, everytime we fixed it he would break it again, so honestly this movie hits slightly close to home.
Danny barking is now in my nightmares. good job.
It's incredible how they have so much experience managing a streaming service and making series and movies themselves and yet shit like this always happens
I am thoroughly fatigued by this movie
21:00
Yes obviously its more money to make fun of stuff we are on YouTube discussing that lol
this is like the taming of the shrew
The fact is that my mom made me watch it and another fact is the animation looks like it's from Dollar tree and they had 100 budget
Marmaduke already had a movie ( a live action I think), there's no need to make another one
Why do I have to get out from under the desk. Its dark and I like it
Danny + Greg = dreg
Marmaduke is the movei ever made shut up you don't know how to do the talk 🤬
danny looking kinda good in these thumbnails recently
To be fair, if a movie has Pete Davidson you can save your time knowing it will be hot garbage.
Notifications are onnn 🙌🏻😉
normally these bad movies just make me laugh but all the fart stuff reeks (pun intended) of like...totally-not-intentional-but-maybe-a-little-bit fetish material like look at marmaduke's goddamn facial expression while he's letting out that huge green cloud. he looks way too "relieved" just eeeuuuughghh
21:40 "🅰️🅱️🅰️🅱️🅰️" ©Danny, 2022
Pin me daddy.........  I mean Danny.
I saw this ob my way to summer camp we started driving at 7 am and its now 1 32 and we have like 3 more hours to go.  Edit: on the car ride back after a week, it was fun.
I feel like netflix when it does occasionally release great stuff, they don’t continue or really represent themselves as it. Then when they make garbage, Netflix gets famous voice actors to make it seem like their movies are good. Then they continue making garbage stuff.
The animation on this movie thoroughly upsets me. It is so ugly.
Yes
The song sounds like something Pete would make 😂
This was honestly one of your funniest videos ever. I couldn't stop laughing because of how many great jokes there were. The ad read was also very fun. Someone under the desk, just filming you, is just so amusing to me. Thank you for this! I can't wait for the next video.  Have a good day everyone!
Danny Gonzalez has to make the revolution to take over PETA and make this place a better world
Pete Davidson = Rotten
Netflix and cringe
Damn, i know why the dad married the mom now
19:52 im not sure I like this angle very much
Marmaduke is like if SNL wrote Marmaduke.
Guy can understand Marmaduke because he's Bri'ish. Yup, that's the only reason.
THANK GOD IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE
Greg!
Theyre taking the plot of The Producers a bit too seriously
peak graphic design.
Bro me and my brother watched the movie and he said he can just break the characters arm because there literally twigs
I have to say if they did the movie in the animation they did for the end credits I think it would look slightly better.
Danny: 17:23 Laura: Keep dicking around on the ground like that with no talent, and you're gonna destroy our lives. It's happened before, it will happen again
I bought The Pinocchio movie and watched it with my brother, it’s a great movie to watch just to make fun of it with friends
hey uh! this isnt even a "writers barely disguised fetish" this is definitely a fetish movie. theres way too much emphasis on stuffing/scat/fart shit for it to be completely normal lol. and ive seen enough as a furry to know this for a fact
Greetings and salutations to all Gregs!
17:23 ngl, that was pretty goofy for the main channel
“It’s the worst movie you’ll see this year.” Jokes on you, Danny. I saw Morbius in the theaters on opening night on purpose (I beg of you, never watch Morbius. Don’t even watch it as a joke.)
it sounds like Pete Davidson had to voice this as part of some community service for his unpaid parking tickets
8:55 This entire movie makes sense now. That's just a fetish scene. This entire movie was dreamed up and financed by someone with a fart fetish, how could we have been so blind
Marmaduke just fucking dies
oof zero percent?
Some people say Netflix is about to tank anyway. I think they've given up, doing the bare minimum, and just rolling over to die
im watching this on the toilet and not to be graphic but i strongly relate to marmaduke rn
Danny don’t you know Netflix is a simp for you and makes these bad movies specifically just for you to review? Netflix is definitely Greg lol
I laughed once at where my dog pooped. Have a pile of dogbags near the door so it's easy to grab some when taking him for a walk, well one day I came home from work to find them in the living room torn to pieces and poop all over them. It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh(and then I had to clean it up and it stopped being funny).
Aloha danny-o
Netflix is the platform ever.
Bad movie but so happy to finally see Drew Goodens biggest fan
These movies make me believe that their purpose is money laundering
Marmaduke can understand English and guy can understand dog
marmaduke seems sociopathically evil actually if he is meant to have the comprehension of a human but still does all of these terrible things. the reason real dogs that misbehave aren’t bad is because they don’t know any better. but this dog can talk, reason, will. he has no excuse.
All these character designs look like they were one step away from "passable" but then ran right past it at full speed into the "uncanny and unappealing". It hurts to look at them
Am I the only one wondering if he actually break the wall 😭
Marmaduke use to be a classic
Danny!
Pete decided to do the movie bc the mom reminds him of Kim
Marmaduke sounds like the name of a German and british
im baby sitting my aunt’s baby kitty he’s so precious this doesn’t have to do with the video but i love him im so happy rn
The evil dog just loos like zero from the Nightmare Before Christmas.
This does the 2010 Marmaduke dirty.  Actually I have no idea, I was eight when that movie came out and I saw it like twice
L m a o
I can't even tell anymore whether these types of movies want us to be on the animal's side or the human's...
The bulldog lifting the building is even more impressive since he lifted it up FROM THE INSIDE
Basically a remake of the live action Garfield movie   ...but worse
As soon as my siblings turned on this film, I immediately left the room, came back later and saw that it broke my TV 😂
No one has finished this video yet.
= )
13:40 "An innocent dog reaching the end of his rope" - Danny A what now? Marmaduke spent the first half of this review being the villain of the movie.
danny make a movie
Damn Marmadukes always trying to steal my data
You should Make a short movie just for fun
"Diggidy dang that dog!" _Drowns_
This movie looks like it was made in 1998, which feels like a Choice
My laptop turned off when I was watching this video I think it tried saving me
The way Danny describes this movie makes it actually seem funny  😄😂😂
I bought this movie at the dollar tree called WET BUM and I honestly think you should definitely review it because it was crap but in an amazing way.  Edit: for a sneak peek, the first scene has nothing to do with the movie, it’s just 3 characters (the main character, this old guy, and someone else) just standing. And then after probably 45 seconds, they begin to rise, and then are floating in a back bend shape. Has nothing to do with the movie, is just there, starts it off, nothing to do with the plot. Just supernatural. Just because. The movie is about a 14 year old girl going through teen drama.
11:36 she doesnt quite have the... lets say body type, for cheer leading.
the way i choked on my laughter and legitimately thought i was going to die because of danny gonzalez reviewing 2022's marmaduke and flashed forward to my family explaining at my funeral that i died at the idea of a dad cursing his dog upon seeing a tidal wave
The animation reminds me of the Sims
Danny perfect timing! I was endlessly scrolling through YouTube like when you check the fridge again for new food but this time it actually worked! A new video for my consumption 😌
The Pinnochio movie is actually a foregin movie (I believe it was originally in Russian.) Lionsgate didn't write the script or animate the movie, they just published an English Dub.
Funny story: pretty much no one I know watches the Raving Rabbids TV show. But I do because when I was little, Rabbids were so nostalgic for me and I loved them, so for like 4 years I watched the Rabbids TV show (they have season 4 on Netflix, why not 1-3 too? I don’t know) and I watched it obsessively. And recently (I think) Netflix made a Netflix original Rabbids movie. And because I know like no one else who watched Rabbids as excessively, part of me wonders, was that because of me? (I know it’s not because of only me, there have to be other people who like it or they were trying to revive Rabbids) the movie was pretty cool ngl and was definitely fitting for the Rabbids franchise. Plus the cup head show is pretty good. Otherwise… Netflix hasn’t made very good content
We watched it in class and it was the worst movie to show a bunch of teenagers
The animation looks like a early 2000’s cartoon but animation have came far for it too look horrible isn’t good literally Netflix’s should be disappointed
live action marmaduke was way better than this dog pile of dog fart and dookie in a dog championship trophy
The guy who made this movie 100% have a fetish
no way you just called zapped with zendaya bad
I don't know what to write to get likes, but here's a comment.
I think the trainers a parody of victoria stillwell
18:42 The dog quite literally forever made their family in debt, the father probably wanted him actually dead even before that, and the movie has the BALLS to act like the father would be sad that the dog who endlessly tortured his life was out of his life
The mom tho SHSEEESEESH
Yes
man i cant believe that me (Guy) is in this movie and drews biggest fan
Netflix should pay you because you know at least 100 people will watch this now
Danny you and drew are youtube treasures.
well, this is definitely a movie that was made
12:17 Forget the whole awful movie review. Danny not only punched a hole in drywall right over a doorframe stud with very little effort but also had it repaired and filled before he sat back down.  We might not see any Danny videos in the near future because the government will be experimenting to figure out the source of his power (don't tell them its the nutcracker guy)
I don't even think 1st graders will enjoy this animation that looks like it was made by a high 7th grader.
my two little sisters absolutely love this movie and watched it multiple times
I think I speak for everyone here but that was the most movie ever.
Dan Dan the bad movie Man😂
PETS UNITED
i put this movie on for my dog 10 now
"you know this dog is bad when the dad turns around an sees a tidal wave coming towards him"
omg so i was out at a brewery and i saw another greg he was wearing a greg shirts and now we are best friends, to the guy i saw if u see this i miss you
i was obsessed with the original marmaduke movie why did they remake it
Llllllllppp
Movies like those, I always wonder which is more likely if the actors (voice and otherwise) either: owed someone a favor, had a massive pile of debt, or was sent only a tiny portion of the script before agreeing to the project.
I think they make these movies just so people appreciate ones they put effort into, haha
Danny I love your videos, but I could not watch all of this. It's too horrendous, as soon as I saw the pool tsunami I knew it was over. I'm sorry but no.
The worst part about the new marmaduke is that the older one with Owen Wilson is already peak cinema
This isn’t the first marmaduke movie either. It’s based off a comic strip and there was a live action one that came out in the 2010
rtx 3090
Netflix on a roll fr.... Down a hill
HONEY WAKE UP NEW DANNY GONZALEZ UPLOAD
I believe he said DIGGITY dang, Danny.   DIGGITY!
pov danny does an ad read to you while you give him the shloppiest jaw-splitting swirly-sloshy-spitty whirlwind top
I watched marmaduke before and the effects are just.... do you ever just put a 2d pic over a 3d background? Yeah they’re like that
I should sit my great dane puppy down and make her watch this and say "don't be this" and traumatize her for life...
good video. yes. I think it was wonderful. not the movie though. that. was. bad. please. why. did. you. make. us. watch. that?
The dad is Danny
4:15 how is that even possible? Its not. HOW DID THAT SPLASH SO MUCH WATER!?
Lol my friend put this on it was horrible
Incredible movie, would never watch, but absolutely stunning
quantity over quality.
Ngl the animations looked like they came out of my graduation reel, they're really bad
Danny you are so amazing every time I see you upload I cry tears of joy you’re content is so beautiful and that luscious hair looks amazing I am so happy
I morb a feeling...
Netflix just still has the whole worldussy
I kinda wish marmaduke had died for the sake of his family so they could sue the dog show and not be bankrupt.
The bit starting 17:24 where he cuts back to Danny doing the goofy dog moves from like 15 seconds earlier got me so bad I had to rewatch it like four times bc I kept laughing. If they had replaced all the marmaduke parts with Danny on all fours they might have gotten a rating higher than 0% and saved on hiring pete
remember when netflix was like the pinnacle of new, original fresh content where their creators had a ton of creative control? and we had a huge boom of incredible film and tv? good times. what went wrong 😔
19:50 did he just give us a BJ POV
The mom is sooooo thick ohhh mah goodness!!
I think the reason is because they know intentionally making it bad will cause people to talk about it and basically give them free advertising. Why make a good movie to minimal success when you can make bad movies and get people to talk about it and watch it. Movies like Morbius and the Emoji Movie are the perfect examples of these.
Huh ok.
Original Marmaduke way better. What a shameful attempt by Netflix to try and match the pure glory of the old Marmaduke voiced by Owen Wilson. what has this world gone to???
I'm dying
Why does the animation kind of look like ratatoing?
It's 11 pm for me-
Father when can I leav to be on my owyennnnn
This animated version of Marmaduke is... just a little bit worse than the og live action movie.
the dad looks like danny
Netflix gets rid of the good movies and keeps the terrible ones
DUDE I LITERALLY TOLD MY BROTHER YESTERDAY THAT I WISHED YOU HAD MADE A VIDEO ON THIS! ARE YOU A MIND READER DANNY?
I WAS WAITING FOR U TO UPLOAD EVERYTIME IM LIKE HOPEFULLY DANNH POSTS SOON AND U DO THE NEXT DAY LMAO 😭😭😭😭
Poo fart
The dog trainer had to break Marmaduke's will in order to train him
18:24 you’d be surprised how many cartoon characters say “uh oh” or the likes in the face of death. pretty much every amphibia character has done that
actually i think this movie was made to upset ME, personally, as a person who loved the live action marmaduke as a child....
God i love pete davidsons song that has to be the funniest part of the movie
Is it just me or does his face look a little off in the thumbnail?
They’re made entirely for Danny to talk about them
Speaking of bad Netflix content, that new Resident Evil show is awful and nothing like Resident Evil.
Why does that ending song remind me of the dog rap from that knock-off titanic? 😭😭
Waiting for Netflix to combust into flames
Danny looks legit disappointed with Netflix on the thumbnail.
It's animated like an early 2000s cartoon it's just scary-
okay you have to admit the ending song goes hard as hell
earlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
The dog detonated a dirty bomb at the dog show basically
marmaduke more like marmapoop
not even the bee movie ripoff was this bad...
agreed
Dennys goregano
Bad movies more like, *"BOOVIES!"*  _I'm sorry I'll shut up..._
A guy named Brian Hull voiced one of the characters and Brian is a YouTuber. (Edit: Pete Davidson actually broke up with Kim Kardashian 😭)
Omg I'm low-key early te amo
hatewatching also plays a huge part in the success of shitty movies like these, like addison rae getting more movies after hes all that was like the number one movie for ages everywhere
so this one time, my mum's friend's son (around the age of my younger brother) came over to my apartment and my mum put the show marmaduke on for him. the thing was she put it on my account so whenever i go to my netflix account and look at the continue watching section i have to come face to face with "mArMaDuKe"
Oh, so when Drew says “Hey Guy” he’s talking about Guy from the movie.
Aaah yes, the mother has the dumpies.
I feel like Pyrocynical would enjoy this movie
10/10 movie
hi Greg
The characters look like something out from a low budget movie you can watch free on YouTube
Luv u Danny
Just like Marmaduke I get skinny when I fart, tee-hee 😇💅
God the animation is so ugly
Netflix when they see a good movie with strong representation and a good plot: :(  Netflix when they see a movie with the same 4 bad jokes: :)
Why you ourple
Well, I know which sleep paralysis demon I'm seeing tonight.
Im pretty sure this was a "remake" of a family live action film from the early 2010's that was similar to the beatoven movies and the studio just completely defaced the character on purpose to make the movie horrible
kurtis conner would love the fart scenes ngl
It's like if that sims baby glitch became a movie....y...yk....
Idk what it is, but something about the dad reminds me of Danny 🤔
A decade ago when I was 2 or 3 I found a old marmaduke comic collection book. It was my childhood. How dare you Netflix.
SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE I CAN GET DANNYS SHIRT BRAJ
At least the new Pinocchio has the true hero in it. That cat. He shoots damn Pinocchio TWICE and tries to just burn down the building he's in to kill his ass and end the film.
i can’t believe these movies went through hundreds of people (editors, producers, etc.) and was still decided to go public💀
why, god why, does zeus sound like j.k. simmons?  edit: it is.
I really hate this art style. Super skinny, massive heads, exaggerated features like noses. It just looks so unappealing. It wouldn't matter if it was in a few movies but it seems like it's every single movie now. Even pixar movies to an extent! I thought the whole appeal of CGI was that it was supposed to be more 'impressive' or realistic,  but they look like they were taken out of a 2d cartoon and it's so weird. Why do they insist on making people look as grotesque as possible??
hi danyy
I really don't like the animation style in Marmaduke either. It feels like it's only one step above the uncanny valley b movies everyone makes fun of.
finally someone talks about this god damn movie I watched this with some friends when we’re hanging out and holy shit all of us were getting secondhand embarrassment istg we all talking shit about it by the end at some point we almost turned it off but we didn’t to see if it would redeem it self no it did not I’m glad someone talk about
Maybe they are making bad videos so that you will react to them 😏
Netflix animation movies are… dubious
Whats his face on the thumbnail!?
Netflix tv show : 8/10 Netflix Movies : 2/10 Netflix anime adaptions : -9000 / 10
and i thought the original marmaduke wasn't that great
Marmanuke
holy im early
I loved the original Marmaduke
you couldnt of said it any better drew
Their stick legs make me wheeze bro. Then the moms legs are legit sofa’s. Great job 👏
This makes me wanna watch the 2010 Marmaduke
What in the secret life of pets mixed with toy story is this-
i don’t get why guy would specifically want to train marmaduke for dog shows if he had a reputation for being a bad dog like couldn’t he train any other dog for them
Pretty sure only YouTubers have watched this movie
OK WHATS UP WITH ALL THESE NASTY MOVIES MAKING THEIR STUFF IN THE ADAMS FAMILY CARTOON STYLE. ITS NOT GOOD, THE STYLE NEVER LOOKED NICE, ITS ACTUALLY DEVASTATINGLY BAD, PLEASE STOP.
Animal abuse is so fun and quirky
more like marmalade 😎
The horrible thing is that my 4 year old and 2 year old cousins *actually* watched this movie when they where here a few weeks ago 😰
cant believe he really punched his wall
yes. yes they are.
If the animation movie isn’t made by Pixar or Illumination, it will most likely have the shittiest graphics on earth
I love the fact that Pete Davidson has no emotion in his voice.
THIS is the exact reason why Netflix is putting ads on their platform. They throw money at any project, don't advertise it, and they don't care about profiting from it outside the platform.
The animation for this movie is giving me like 2004 vibes it’s literally so awful
How tf do people comment and see these videos so fast?
Danny: “I think it’s necessary for villains to be rich and British” That’s a funny way to say gay (or, queer coded) Danny lol
They make crap movies so they can lose money on it and count it as a loss so they don’t have to pay as much corporate taxes.
never been this early
Once The Mitchells Vs. The Machines released everyone realized that they couldn't handle making anything better
I want to see a list of all the cruddy knockoff films Danny has reviewed.
FIRST COMMENT! Sigh… no. I’m here in the first 17 minutes, but I’m already 1,000 comments deep. >_<;; Someday I’ll be first!
Netflix made this movie so someone else could make rule34 of the mom for them
Danny whenever I was younger, I would watch a show that is called "Mai & me" and I think it would be hilarious to see you just completely tear this show apart because it is just so weird If you were to do this, this entire experience would not hurt me because I know it's a weird show. It was on Netflix whenever it came out, and whenever I watched it. I don't know if it's on there anymore, but it was, whenever I watched it.
I’m an old Greg, It’s putting your Dukes up not deuces.
Marmaduke has always been such a pushed character that no one wants, to quote mean girls "stop trying to make Marmaduke happen, it's not going to happen".
Dang that dog
I feel like almost everyone should agree with the title. If you don't, GTFO
-10 / 10 fuck skete
Danny: Marmaduke is a terror to the family  Also Drew: This poor innocent dog
lmfao
I cant believe a dog recreated Chernobyl with a single fart
it's so sad how a lot of animated films phone it in because they wanna save money, or just don't put as much effort into making a kid's film actually enjoyable for the whole family anymore
HI GREG YOU JUST POSTED THIS SO I HOPE YOU READ MY COMMENT , I want you to REALIZE , not acknowledge, REALIZE that you have fans worldwide ( cuz apparently Americans tend to forget that they aren’t alone on this planet) , and I’m one of them , SENDING GREGIES FROM MOROCCO 🇲🇦 <3
You know when It's a Netflix movie it's guaranteed to be bad.
Marmaduke? More like Marma-puke! 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
rich, british and wears a purple suit? man is 100% purple guy
This is so bad!!!!!!
Im fucking traumatized
Probably because it’ll get just as much if not more publicity.
animation THIS bad honestly baffles me, because i know there are creators who want to make good stuff. i understand animation is hard and needs a big budget to be done great but there's no excuses for bad writing.
this is one of the movies i have never seen
scoob doo more like shitty poo
The animation makes it Look like it was made in the early 2000s
There was a live action marmaduke film that came out in 2010 that was actually really good kind of the same story
A dog being a jerk is fine and cute only so long as he is a dog and doesn't know better. Marmaduke being sentient means he isn't just a rowdy dog but an asshole
“Dog training tips your trainer doesn’t want you to know.. beat the shit out of your dog”   -Danny Gonzalez, 2022  Thank you, Danny, very cool
it feels like Netflix is trying to speedrun the death of their service at this point
they just don't care cause people are gonna watch it anyways. this is what we've become
Wonderful🙂👍
This movie looks looked one of those terribly drawn/ animated mobile game ads
I'M FINALLY EARLY!
i think danny enjoys saying marmaduke
3:22 They have a bomb inside a griller bro 💀
6:05 Wait... how can those stick legs keep him up? Where are the physics here? Wtaf?
I’m literally in love with Danny and his content  🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
My cousin watched this movie about 15 times it’s so bad
I turned notifications on. Am I truly Greg?
Marmaduke is bad, but Doogle is evil
Day 5 of asking Danny to react to life lessons with Louis
Truly greg
I’m actually cracking up at the thought of Pete Davidson sitting down to netflix&chill and being like “wait… was i in a movie??”
"Pete Davidson" and "funny guy" don't really go well together.
did they get animatedjames on the team for this movie
Lmao you just keep making my day
Should have hired Chris Pratt for the main character, or for every character
why did they make a weezer reference
IT HAS BOOB PHYSICS ????????
I think making bad movies might be a tactic for them so people can say “ This movie is soo bad!” And then make videos about it and then other people watch it so I think the point is they know that they don’t have to put much effort in for people to watch
I love the idea of a negative score meaning "the world is a worse place with this movie being made"
not just movies, netflix has terrible shows too :(( and it doesn’t make sense when they cancel the good ones wtf
this is the most video ever.
your hair looks really good today
I legit thought you punched a hole in the wall 🤣
Yoooooo greg pillows! :0
No one barks better than drew
I actually watched this movie a while ago I’m glad Danny said something about it
Netflix just throws money at anything
not gonna lie, im leggit scared of the character design in this movie, why someone aprove this, my eyes are bleeding
I browsed on uk netflix for the first time in months and all the just added stuff was the most random Swedish movies and it happens every so often just really poorly rated foreign film ? Is it just filler movies ? Or?
Our school literally made us watch this.
danny gonzalez
I don’t know what you are talking about, the mom… I mean the movie was great
i have literally never been this early to one of dannys videos lol this is so cool
if you think movies on Netflix are bad try prime video 💀
hi dnny
why does this movie, released in 2022, have the same animation as food fight
Hi Daniel gorgonzalaz
5:46 why does he move like a car dealerships inflatable tube man
every human character in this universe looks like it was based off of the bully girl from the animated addams family
I thought that was Scooby 😭
First
FAtHeR, WhEn cAn I lEaVe tO bE oN mY oWnnnn~😩? I gOt tHe wHoLe Ussy To sEe😩🤤!
There is literally no movie role pete davidson will not take 😭 hes collecting them
Remember the live action Marmaduke? I loved it as a kid.
the writers and directors  for these movies must have been daydreaming or just had dementia and forgot they were writing a good movie
Posted 13 minutes ago, this is the earliest I have ever been to a Danny video
Marmaduke looks like Buff Doge kinda lol
There’s only two things I like in Netflix at the min are Arcane and the Umbrella academy
NOICE VIDEO!
oh god, im early again
"Netflix is a joke"
why is danny my comfort youtuber
12:21 I legitimately thought Danny punched a hole in his wall 😭 omfg
Bro why you look like the guy in the thumbnail lol 😂
i hate this because marmaduke (2010) was a good movie, from my memory.
They need to make some new movies I’m on life support I need more stuff to watch 🙁💔
I have to say, this movie may be the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen.
Wow I’m slightly early
Just finished bojack rewatch, Danny is perfect to watch after it
the best thing about this movie was the cool lightning effect on marmadukes paw like 6 minutes in
There's a live action version of this that came first and to be honest the live action one was actually not bad but this is just horrible and quite disappointing
This is the first time I'm actually "early" to a video lol
Why does this movie feel like it was made for fetish reasons
Danny also has “Pixar mom syndrome”
Danny you need to react to a free movie on YouTube called goat story. It is very bad and is classified as a kids movie
I definitely know Netflix are pushing  woke feminism, LGBTQ, race, and political messages with all those garbage Tv shows they keep making and tanking!
Wtf are the proportions of the mom 😭 how is it both the most and least sexy character design at the same time
3:32 Friendly Fire 💀💀💀💀
IM GREG!!!!HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHA
E
i love bad movies so netflix works on me lmaoo
"at a regional level" 😆👌
Danny always has me freaking cackling.
Marmaduke's elemental powers look badly photoshopped 😭
bro danny is just CRANKING OUT new videos holy shit love it bro
“Well,I guess it’s time we put the dog down hunny those prices and how much we have to pay for the damages we just can’t keep any more pets”
I don't know what to put, hello everyone I hope you're staying hydrated and healthy.
Daniel

I don't think Pete Davidson has ever sounded interested in anything
Title: Is Netflix making bad movies on purpose? I thought the general consensus was “yes, yes they are”  Edit: Wait Netflix didn’t make the Pinocchio movie, though. Wasn’t that a European company? Netflix just bought the rights to the English release
Idk how anyone likes ugly character design like this, it was the same complaint for the new addams family movies as well.   It can’t be all that hard to make semi realistic looking people.
Mmm...
1:01 I thought I was watching ratatoing
OMG it's Drew!
So now they've ruined Marmaduke.
My Fair Lady vibes.
Netflix is pumping out as many movies as they can too can a profit because they have been in dept by about 14 billion USD. The only reason Netflix has not hit rock bottom is due to shows such as Stranger Things Squid Game and Breaking Bad.
It's obvious that these movies are just made bc every little child has a phone or tablet w parents preferring Netflix over youtube bc of the weird things that kids stumble upon on here, so they just quickly need to pump out garbage animated moving pictures with sound for kids to infinitely have playing so their parents don't have to care about nor interact with them ever
I hate it when Danny’s boss won’t let him give movies a negative score out of 10 😢 hope the boss learns to give him a little more range, maybe up to the amount of the range of Pete Davidson’s acting abilities 😔🙏
I love your channel keep up the great stuff!
5 min ago🤨
Beauty standards have gone wild
i swear netflix movies are made by AI at this point, and these AI dont take popular things from the algorithim, they take what tiktok has edit: wait fuck just started watching and danny basically said this
Marmaduke is actually a famous cartoon strip that comes out in the newspaper I remember my mom collecting and when I was a little kid she used to draw pictures of Marmaduke
I love how this movie is just a “how to” video about animal abuse
earliest i've ever been to a danny video
"palms sweaty, arms wet spaghetti"
Uh oh he called Pete Davidson funny now Kanye’s gonna add him to his blacklist
hi dannt
ngl i like marmadoke i loved it but thats just me opinion              and i think the main audience were kids so there is no reason to hate my younger siblings loved it
That fact that the dog is a direct ripoff of Scooby-doo, is killing me. 💀
If Danny Answers my comment I'm gonna watch the whole movie
Bro this movie sucks
The animation team really said lemme make this the worst shit ever
the animations looks like something I’d make in my 3D animation class. like so stiff and just so weird 😭 and why are the legs SO THIN like legit a strand of hair??
My siblings and i tried watching the movie and none of us could take the painful torture that is this movie for more than 20 minutes, so kudos to you Danny for watching the entirety of this and going through that hellish experience for us
i'm wondering who this movie is for after seeing the mom
no one can convince me that an inflation fetishist didnt work on marmaduke.
So this is what Netflix is making when they cancel the good shows
3:20 look out cinder block
as soon as i saw this movie i knew it would end up in a danny video
The Mom's ass is getting to me. I fucking love it!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
im sorry for the parents of the children that watch this when their young and grow up with it
I liked the movie.
a 0% on rotten tomatoes they were like, “no”
early
bruh didn't they already have a marmaduke movie? why are studios just remaking shit and making it 3d?
Marmaduke looks like one of those movies on hbo that ur mom would “reward” you and your siblings with after cleaning the entire house on a weekday
greg.
The fact that they give Adam Sandler how many millions to pump out the same cookie cutter dog shit that he does just because of his name says it all.
Ummm, a brand new MAIN CHANNEL DANNY G JOINT?!?? THAT'S AN INSTANT CLICK FOR ME DAWG... gonna be a good day.
“This is Guy. His name is Guy. He is Drew Gooden’s biggest fan”
We've come full circle, Netflix made a terrible animated version of a live action film
MAN IN HOME IN WORLD IN PLACE OF HOME AND MAN IN HOME IN WORLD IN PLACE OF HOME AND
Bro i swear i wanted to tell you to watch marmaduke but i knew u wouldn’t reply so i just didn’t. What a coincidence
Yes
I really want to hear Danny talk about the Netflix tour-de-force Man vs. Bee
YOOO ANDREW TATE DISSED U I THINK HES GOT BEEF, MAKE A VID ON IT ASAP
the mom body type caught me so off guard GAHHHHH DAYUMMMMMM AWOOGA
This is the earliest I’ve been to a Danny video I feel blessed
Hello Danny
Off brand Garfield
imagine it Dtew wasnt eben when the movie id when the
It's because a bad movie can be more profitable than a sucessful movie. In some states in the US you can list a failed business endeavor as a tax write off, with the amount of money you expected to make being how much is deducted. So if you make a $1mil budget movie, it only makes $500k, and you expected it to make $10mil, you deduct $9.5mil. Do this across several bad movies and you eventually get out of taxes all together.
Paws of Fury is somehow gonna be a worse movie
Yo
u know how some youtubers don’t care abt what kinda attention they’re getting, cuz they just want money. i think netflix noticed that, applied it to their stuff and are hoping to get their revenue back up :/ (cuz didn’t they lose like 70% of…their money i guess, idk finance shit, i’m 15)
I think they make these movies purposely obscene so people will talk about it for being bad, and then more people will want to watch it. So Danny talking about it is them succeeding
omg daddy gonzalez posted a video!
I’m so sad right now but your videos help me forget
Danny Gonzales
Knowing that they keep canceling good shows it really feels like they want to fail.
this looks like fanboy and chumchum
looks like I have another banger for my greg playlist 😌
its not
i am convinced pete davidson was forced to act in this movie
yes
🚶
the dad, narrowing his eyes and doing the josh peck ‘megan’ voice whenever anything bad happens: …marmaduke
why is it so ugly like whats the point
all i could think about this entire video is the fact that danny grew a little facial hair
2 danny gonzalez videos in 2 weeks? What a treat
Does no one know about the original marmaduke?
grag
Netflix makes bad movies more often than they have good movies on thwrw
Nah 300 comments in 3 minutes, 100 to 1 minute
"its the law that the bad guy has to be rich and british" -danny 2022
Netflix could say this was made by an ai and people would believe it lmao
Dannyyyyyyyyy😸
The original Marmaduke movie was good...but what is thiS?!?
looks like children's channels on youtube......
I cannot believe the Peanuts movie is so good, but they went to make Marmaduke and went "what if we make a movie worse than Garfield?" Why are comic strips the *most* mixed bag.
I feel like somebody made Marmaduke's character based on what people assume and stereotype Pete Davidson to be. Troubling, isolated, disobedient. Then they were like "Let's just get the man himself to voice this soab"
4:53 Oh man, INCEPTION!!!
spent the morning throwing up but hey new danny gonzalez video so ya win some ya lose some
I PRAYED FOR DANNY TO UPLOAD AND HE DID
i think its because people hate-watch things. thats why awful shit like tall girl gets sequels and GOOD shows like "i am not okay with this" gets canceled
yes they probably are
Yes.
Danny: This rich british dude actually isn't a bad guy Rich British guy: *Kicks a dog and sends it flying into a tree and charges the family millions of dollars for it*
yes
THOSE ARMS
netflix is trying to create “background content” so yes essentialy
ITS MY BIRTHDAY DANNY
blockbuster moment
I had no idea you could make literal and figurative 2D characters in a 3D movie
The fact that the mom can even keep herself balanced with that anatomy is just marvelous
Danny, I like your shirt
“5 mins ago” wholy shiza, anyways..I agree to a large level
Boop
The animation is so bad that 3D cartoons from the late 90s looked better (ex: Rolie Polie Olie was so good in comparison)
damn I've never been this early
I’m sorta early and officially GREG🥳
Ah yes, the patented Pixar mom birthing hips. Just what this movie needed.
6:12 putting their duces up 😆
I thought at first that  he stole from Scott Cramer then a realized that no Danny would never do such o7
I can't explain it but every scene in marmaduke feels like there should be a sped up version of it with that one remix of somebody that I used to know playing in the background
Pete Davidson’s narration sounds like he’s a begrudging father of two reading a bedtime story he doesn’t care about to the kids he didn’t want just so he can put them to bed and brush by his wife on the way out the door to go hang out with all his other friends who peaked in high school and drink cheap beer in the woods by a bonfire fueled by old magazines, gasoline, and regret
I was have a regular day going on with my sad everyday depressed life yk the normal but know I know this movie exists I’m having yet another crisis
0:00-21:41
I always wondered who drew gooden’s biggest fan was, never expected a dog trainer
How dare you include Zapped on the bad movie list you’re lying to yourself
I’m fungry.
pete definitely did not want to do this movie i genuinely don’t know who forced him to do this 😭😭 if he cannot make a joke about his dead dad he doesn’t want it
amogus
As the 4.kth like, it was very satisfying to like this video
Netflix is a website where movies happen to be.
Just wait until you watch the Kissing Booth movies
Maybe Netflix should just go back to being a DVD rental service if they keep this shit up.
great video that i have fully watched
Bro I'm so early first time
greg
My uncle’s name is Greg, please love me Danny I starve for attention 😔😔😔
The animation- 😭😭
Quantity over quality is Netflix’ MO these days
7 minutes lol
Pov: your early but don't know what to say...
you could say Guy really pulled a justin chad there
you should react to the Disney channel movie Starstruck
First Netflix cancels Jatp and other good shows and then they make another show about ghost a complete slap to Jatp and now they make this disaster piece. What is Netflix doing
Marmaduke looks like a terrible knockoff of another bad movie
no but seriously WHO SIGNED OFF ON THE MOM???!!!!!
they're making the movies for you to react to duh
pretty sure marmaduke was a live action movie before i think i have it on dvd and i loved it
Netflix whole thing is making 1 good thing and then loads of crappy shows and movies 💀
Marmaduke sounds like a type of juke a classmate would name
I think the Netflix writers got drunk and puked out 20 movies
dawg fr
I woke up to watch this. I didnt, but it would be sweet if i did.
e
Look at the greg behind him😳
Omg how do you get 0 😔
Confirmed: as a British person, I declare all rich and British people are evil. We all are. We secretly plot murders and dunk custard creams in tea.
marmaduke is actually a live action movie way before this why did they have to redo it. it was fine.
the answer is yes
I can’t believe Netflix would remake(??) such a classic talking animal movie like this, this is the 11th time my childhood has been ruined this month
Yes
I am truly Greg 😎
I have seen marmaduke unfortunately  My sisters watched it so many times  Idk what it’s about all I know is that this dog eats food and shits and then his owners gets mad and he runs away
The animation style kinda reminds me of ratatoing
lol
Danny should own Netflix!
Hello Danny
pov: you’re early and you dont know what to comment so you comment “pov: you’re early and you dont know what to comment”
netflix originals are either really really good, or the worst movies/ tv shows to watch imaginable, no in between.
Netflix is like the movie platform equivalent of Buzzfeed videos. Quantity over quality, but some of the older ones are absolute bangers.
A film which looks worse than ratatoing? I thought it was impossible, but alas, here it si
was literally looking through the netflix catalog and looked at this movie and then compared it to other animations that netflix has made
I love the old Marmaduke, I sent this on Netflix and refused to click it. Reboots like this are bound to be bad.
The answer is a resounding yes
Early 😎
Him funny me go laugh laugh
DANNY
“his dad’s arms are made out of at spaghetti” -Danny 2022  its so accurate tho- 😬😬
Marmaduke (2022) is one of the best movie’s I’ve ever watched
I would rather watch ratatoing then either of these.
I hate how this animation looks  I want to bleach out my eyes    Then burn my eyes
First
netflix is
I need to comment
BRO I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD REVIEW THIS I SAW MY SISTERS WATCHING IT AND OMG ITS SO SHIT
Oh my damn. I never heard about the Marmaduke movie with Pete, but I've never seen a rotten tomato score that low before. 0% is a shame.
the other day i went 3 minutes into the movie and couldn't do it anymore
Bouncing egg body type is the representation I needed 😍😍
danny gonzalez
this looks like the most pete davidson movie EVER and you cant tell me otherwise
I can't believe they did this to Marmaduke in my opinion the original Marmaduke was amazing a lot better then whatever this show was
this being uploaded as i finished making breakfast… thank you for fulfilling my inner ipad kid
This movie seems to be a pretty interesting case because while the other movies Danny's reviewed look horrendous, this one looks... Well also horrendous but slightly less so
how does one accept this
Why does it look worse than some of the knock off cartoons Danny reacted to
Yo
Heh nice
I’m sorry but a cartoon dog named Marmaduke voiced by Pete Davidson is one of the funniest things I’ve heard
I think Netflix is making bad movies on purpose because YouTubers will talk about how bad it is, and the viewer will be like "no way it's that bad," and so they watch it, which in the end gives Netflix more revenue and more money  bad publicity is good publicity
Yass
Bad is the new standard danny, good is so last season.
2:38 what the hell is that
I miss quiby
how DARE danny put zapped on the list of bad movies, that movie is a masterpiece 😤
hiii danny finally early!
yes
Guys don't worry, Netflix will make a good show in about every 5 years so we'll just have to wait for a masterpiece like a movie starring Noah Centineo again.
Love u Dan Dan
Pinocchio sounds whiny as hell.
Their movies are straight up mid and boring
first 6 mins
Netflix is smarter then we think
When’s the “GREG” official feature film coming out?
Marmaduke dose not have zero redeeming qualities pete is the greatest actor of our generation
I was NOT expecting the mom's body. 💀 Stop trying to make moms sexy!
726th comment
Any youtuber:uploads This “RLM” mf: I mAkE bEtTeR vIdS
Yes
Anyone could make better movies with MSP than Netflix does with professional teams and stuff
wow danny are you really dating a kardashian?! 🌝❤️
They saw how bad the live action Marmaduke was and decided it was a challenge.
Thank goodness, Danny! Been waiting for either you or Kurt to upload to your main channels, but I just sat through the entire Resident Evil show on Netflix and I cannot express my distaste for everything now. Awful. I have no faith in media anymore
I love Pete Davidson so much but dude what the hell is this 🤣🤣
Bro who has that much water in their pool 🤣
I LOVE YA DANNNYYYYY
Never been this early
I susbcribed and notifications on Im truly greg now?
why do they all look like insects
only the real ones remember the live action marmaduke
0:25 voiced by Pete Davidson 😭😭
im her wothon 5 min
Have you recently checked out what “content” snap chat has to offer? Its interesting…
have the animators ever seen a real person with normal proportions
Netflix is literally like Netflix💀
Notifications on, absolutely dripping in Comfy Greg clothes. Life is good
i literally predicted danny was gonna upload today and i just see a video that was uploaded 4 minutes ago   *i must be a genius*
When I first saw marmaduke show up on my Netflix I immediately turned my tv off
I think this is a sign to cancel our subscriptions from Netflix
hey ive never been this early and im so excited i could cry wjdjksjdjf i love your videos so much and they got me through some really dark shjt and i know that sounds super cliche but its true and i use my critical thinking skills all the time thank you so much for continuing to have such a safe and supportive presence for me not for me specifically but yano<333333333
Waitwait wait that is so ugly no joke  why would netflix allow this on their platform .. omll
A
Honestly you could convince me you made up marmaduke
They made a live action Marmaduke movie in like the early 2000s or something and I remember liking it bc it was fucking wild
hi drew!!!
hey danny 😩😩
You look stressed with the white tints in your hair
they got those Fanboy and Chum Chum proportions
are you slowly turning into Link Neal from GMM
this movie is definitely a movie and that’s really all i can say about it
we all know its for the outraged reviews
Here in 3 minutes
Nothing that makes me feel better than a new Drew vid!
They don't realize they can make good childrens movies
Pete Davidson in this movie just shows the dominance of films picking a name over an actual voice actor
new danny content is literally the only highlight of my life
10/10 would watch again
Cool
I feel like Danny last few videos have been a dramatic increase in quality. The Disneyworld video and this one are on my repeat playlist because WOW they’re just? So funny. Greg is stronger every minute.
OHMYGOD I NEVER CATCHED DANNY SO EARLY! JUST 4 MINS IN!
4 mins in
Me and my family wanted to wach a horror film on netflix and we picked "robert the doll" there was like 5 robert the doll. We wached the nazie one and it was the worst god damn movie i have ever seen!
Hello greg????
Is Danny also a Greg or his he just like the king of Greg's?
Did Danney get a chair with a headrest in such a height so as to make sure GREG could be read on the couch?
yo
Marmaduke is for little kids like 2 3 4 5 year olds
hello greg😛
Petition for Danny to talk about the Nickelodeon movie "Swindled"
I lobe you mr greg
I feel like Netflix just has their own department solely dedicated to making horrible low budget movies on the off chance that it will become an ironic hit and be torn apart by commentary YouTubers
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
It’s weird to think that no one has seen the full video yet 🤔🤔
why does the mom look like rhat😞💀
YouTube is better than FetNlix at this point. Anything in the top 10 is absolute garbage and they keep taking the good movies off because they don't want us to have the good stuff.
3 minutes since posted and already 500 comments.woah
I can’t tell if movies when I was little were just actually good, or if I was a dumb kid that thought everything was good
I wanna know how much money Pete got from this
omg everyone stop; Danny just posted
3 minutes 👁👄👁
The real reason they do this is because it is so cheep that they can add it to the statistic if we have these many numbers of movies and shows
Your the funniest guy i know dude you always make me belly laugh 😎
Early gang
Danny should be a netflix show
More like Marmadookie
“it feels like netflix just fed an ai a bunch of bad movies until I spat out marmaduke”  *shows he’s all that, zapped… movies he’s done videos on*💀
MARMADUKE WAS MY CHILDHOOD?!?! oh the animated one oh yeah fuck that
THE PILLOWS wait have they been there?
I started watching Marmaduke with my parents and less than halfway through, both were asleep, and the next day my mom asked “Hey, do you want to watch Marmalade?” She’s not even that forgetful, Marmaduke was just not important enough to be remembered lmao
Danny's back with the best hair I've ever seen on a human.
Danny is Danny
DANNY RAH 👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👺👹👺👹👺👺👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👺👺👺👺👺👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
I just finished watching a 2 Danny video wtf
the dogs kinda cute tho just me ?
For some reason danny in the thumbnail  just doesn't look like himself.
I should start making bad movies on purpose too. This may be the only way for me to get on Danny’s videos 💀
The new pinnochio is 100% fruity
I agree that studios must be making bad movies on purpose. Netflix saw the reaction to Tall Girl, and yet they still made a sequel!
early!
Epic
Danny>>>>>>>
has anyone else noticed in the past few years that media quality has gotten way worse or is that just me
The best part of this movie is Pete Davidson
They don’t care about the movies they just care about money and views
do kids even know who marmaduke is
As a 90s kid, I don't know why they would make a movie out of Marmaduke. Wow lol.
this sure is a movie. definitely very a movie.
thank you for posting on my birthday, really crazy that you posted just for me!!!
DANNY
My sister's saw you at the Kurtis Connor show yesterday, and that you looked like you weren't in the mood for a selfie 🤭
Y’all I’m finally this early! And he never disappoints us with his amazing content !! 😁
Netflix has had a lot less people watching and subscribing recently, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is some type of marketing thing. Ya know "so bad I had to see it"
A new video from drew, this is an amazing day 😍
i was watching the hard rock nick video feat. drew when i got this notification let’s goooo
Anyone else grow up on the original Marmaduke?
HERE WITHIN THE HOUR
How bad do you want these movies to be?  Netflix: YES
tea
Took 3 minutes to YouTube to give the notification smh,
I was just rewatching your old videos. It can't be a coincidence. Universe is telling me something 🤔
Once my little cousin turned on a movie about a dog it had a sausage in his mouth and winked in the first 5 minutes of the movie…
eggs
Every time Danny makes a movie review I drop everything to watch it
Netflix  mad jojo part 6 bad the thing is why?
I saw that movie, absolutely awful tbh. 🙂
i’ve been looking for something to watch while i eat for 15 minutes- thank you-
Holy shit I never been 3 minutes early  Also it sounds like the writers have a fart and fat fetish
“I’m my own entity I’m not limited” slay
i think we should all feel bad for the animators who get handed the script and have to go “holy f*** i cant believe we have to try and make this look okay.” then fail miserably anyways💀
Netflix srsly sucked starting in like 2020 when “Tall Girl” came out 💀
I am truly greg
Claim your here before 10 min ticket🔖
Early
Why does Danny always make a video five months later after everyone talked about it
Why r people commenting as if they finished the entire 21 minute video when it just came out 4 minutes ago. Liars.
It it’s making bad movies on
Hey Drew, you should do more collaborations with Danny and Kurtis. The last time you did it, it was really good.
Just what i needed another vid from our master greg DANNY
Hi dannyyyyyyy
I got a notification that Danny uploaded this video while I was watching his life of luxury video from like 3 years ago
We need a free for all, The panda, Ratitounge, and this
aaa slay im early
bro u have to watch doogal literally
Based on the Pinocchio example I'd say yes, but hey, what do I nose?
at this point, netflix and disney are making an agreement to see who can make the worst movies
Danny I'm begging you please don't cut your hair 😭
I needed this content today, thanks Danny! Stay safe and stay hydrated everyone. <3
Pin me Danny the daddy
No mum I don’t care that it’s 2am I’m watching Danny Gonzalez!
Danny could make a really bad movie and it could get a better rating that all of these movies
Here because I’m a true Greg 💪💪💪
I saw only the last few minutes of this movie and wtf
Funny how people like the vid when it's only been out for 3 mins
You probably won’t see this but I met you last night at Champaign (my name is Ellie) and I was a little star struck at the time but I wanted to thank you again for all that you do. I’m really happy I got to see you :)
Marmaduke is a relatable masterpiece  I am marmaduke Marmaduke is me Rotten tomatoes is a sham and obviously was hired by the CIA to give a low review  Wake up, Sheeple
bwaHAHAHAHAHAH
Marmaduke? More like Marmadont 🥳🥳🥳
hello danny
when did netflix start producing your videos
Why is Danny looking into my soul in the thumbnail.
FATHER, WHEN CAN I LEAVE TO BE ON MY OWNNNNNN

netflix makes movies, albeit not good ones
why does the dog sound like a pickmeeee
Even reused hallmark Christmas movie plots are better than most Netflix Original Movies
Pinnoccio was yassified
500 views. 874 likes. YouTube is having a brain fart rn.
Danny to many adds
Pete Davidson being the narrator is an....interesting casting choice
i dislocated my knee thank you for uploading
Hello 👹
Shart
Early 😁
Ok
Good video but a weird amount of Drew Gooden on screen
Danny I smell you from here take a shower
There is a muffin in the microwave and I don't know what to do can someone please tell me what a large dog is doing flying into the void of space I just want someone to explain what quantum physics is and why a black hope makes spaghetti
these are the reason i rewatch my favourite shows :’)
danny deserves 100 subscribers <3333 i love him
Greg is short for Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz
Eeeeeeetu
To understand garbage you must first become garbage.
2 minutes ago YESS
to be fair I don't think Pete Davidson knows when he's in anything
yoooooo! i was just rewatching a ton of other danny videos! what up ggerge!
I OFFICIALLY BECAME A GREG I JUST GOT MY FIRST UPLOAD NOTFICATION 😎
Hi Greg! Sorry to break this to you but Movie Studios are making bad movies from the 1980s
heyo greggies love you all xx
I will claim my here within and hour
e
DANKY
literally danny is the bes person on this planet
Wow
having pete davidson as the main character is probably the weirdest person to cast 😭
The real Marmaduke is a GREAT movie. It’s a live action movie, and the dog is not in terrible cgi. This movie is crap
WE HAD TO WATCH THIS IS IN SCHOOL-😭😭
Bad movies > good movies
I feel like the creators definitely has something for farts.
Dood people need to make better movies
netflix knows its dying so its trying to come back to life but in the process its killing itself more
DAMNy i'm early for once
You’re making bad YT vids on purpose 🤌🏽
when can i leave to me on my ownnnn 😩
theyre making bad movies to convert the viewers to Craig's 😔
oh
the “hello greg” instead of “what’s up greg” was jarring
I feel like the original maraduke was better. Then again, most of these movies make me wanna jump off a cliff
Danny should watch the live action  Marmaduke and compare
Hi Danny
I feel like the new selling point of movies is having really strange voice acting choices...
danny’s def my comfort person
Pete Davidson, interesting choice
Notice how this has been up for less than a minute and there's already more than 300 comments.
-7/10
I’m honestly convinced 😓
I’m pretty sure they are making them on purpose at this point 💀
Nobody knows what it’s like, to feel hated.
Who else lives men
0:00 welcome to the start
Oh hey are
Holy shit I remember watching this movie when I was sick a while back   That farting scene man, just why
i am robert downey jr
Movie bad
Danny's videos hit hard when it's an hour before an exam

hey danny
Hi danny

yes.yes they are
i love to refresh youtube and see a brand new danny video fresh out the oven
I’m so eaArly
I have a feeling that Netflix held all of its animators hostage to put out this garbage then continue to shit in their desk and fire them afterwards.
farrther wen can eye leev 2 bee on mu oown
300 comments in two minutes upon uploading? amazing
I love Greg!
heloooo
Pin me
You should watch "Who killed captain Alex" by Wakaliwood. Production budget was $85 USD and it is the best worst movie I have ever seen.
No because I watched this movie with my sister and stuff and we bullied the movie the entire time and there's so many plot holes
Netflix is doing it for fun at this point
danny i. just cliced. on this and you look so , good today
Hello Greg this is the comment section there are alot of bots here.
Great video drew
We Gregs here gather to watch Papa Greg's new content.
Yes. Yes they are. You need to change the title, it shouldn't be a question.
People really just click on a vid notification to try to be the “first comment” like what do you expect me to do envy you?
I was just scoring through YouTube cuz I was bored
This is the earliest I've been to a YouTube video wtf
i love your videos! im truly greg now cuz i rung that bell😈
Netflix is definitely known to make the movies ever. Their movies have actors who act, the writers write, the producers produce and so fourth. Cinematic marvels
"1 min ago" yeasss, good notification, good youtube.
King 💅
Uwu
I love you Danny DeVito😍♥️ !!

It's frustrating that they cancelled so many great shows like Centaurworld and The Midnight Gospel, just to pump out trash after trash after trash 😒
Lol
Hello there
.
Canr wait to watch this 🥰🥰😋😋
Hello
I’ve seen Marmaduke be advertised and refused to watch it. Glad that I wasn’t alone in thinking that this movie looked like literal dogshit!
Make a video on gacha kids, they made r@pê a trend 😀
WASSUPPP EARLY AF
Netflix keeps employing good actors and make crap movies
hey Danny 👋
Hello greg👋👋👋
alot of bots here
Sometimes i wonder how people manage to comment something relevant to the video 1 minute after the release of it🪦
yo
My family watched Marmeduke and I complained for 10 minutes straight, and then left.
8:48 what was the animator on
there is only one movie that i’m excited to see and that’s the school for good and evil 🙏 everything looks good so far and if netflix screwed it up i’m gonna be so upset

Very good, also Pinocchio kinda fruity
Hello Danny! Lol
I think the whole point is they know that these movies won’t succeed anyway, so they throw everything out the window and bank on the movie getting traction - especially on social media - for how bad it is. Also, the fact this came out after Netflix fired/cut funding from its animation departments DID NOT help this movie’s case.
I have one question for netflix. WHY?
Netflix is out of it.
Hi
🔥use this as a here in the first 10 mins button🔥
Answer: To get money I don’t think Netflix cares what films are on there, they just want money.
yay new video 👹
im greg
Danny is the type of guy to not give af when the world ends
Netflix puts so much shit out these days that I just don’t feel like watching any of it.
*runs all over the walls and lands on everyones heads in the world* YOURE RIGHT
i was just thinking: “yk what? it would be cool if danny uploaded today. could use some positivity rn…”  thanks danny 👍
Whananananna

Netflix is very good at being so bad that it gets in the news. People forget that they have like 3 good shows on there because everything they actually make is terrible
bad movie is good
my bathroom smells like beef jerky
i need danny to review paws of fury tbh
hi danny
i was literally just binge watching your older videos!
