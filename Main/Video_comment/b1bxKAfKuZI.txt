Can’t believe where we came from
Hhhhhhh
God cob ARSENAL
So, surrey's talking to the 2rm bits,  the q is,  who's convincing who to go which way?
Even with a horseman wearing long,  Tierney still thinks he's an a summer holiday (i mean weather wise not work wise)
We playing 12 men on field including referees
7:35 that's how you know they are going to stay,trust me
arsenal will never be champion for life it is the prayer of ozil fans
Glad to see Odegaarde can do in training what Ozil and Giroud did in real matches.
Willian looks crap even in training. He’s clearly just there for the paycheck.
Bringing in Willian has greatly limited Nelson's chances. It's not cool
COYG 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Happy to see the boys in training
How's willian getting game time and we have Nelson
Chambers at RB needed
Everyone looks a fanny compared to Kieran Tierney😂
Odegaard has skillz
William out
give armband to holding or tierney
ESR will be Arsenal's Foden.. So there is no chance Odegaard gonna replace him in the team. Actually ESR and Foden was on the same team when England won the u17 World Cup.. But the coach did not give ESR the chances he deserved. Arteta giving ESR what he deserved.
Even in training Willians isn't giving all
Some of the touches by the players were really poor. They need to kill the ball with their 1st touch, just like Dennis Bergkamp.
How about play him maybe we could have got a win vs ManU with a back heal assist in a game. Practice session means nothing
✅🛎🛎
Harika olmuş ellerine sağlık 🎁🎁🛎🛎🛎🛎
Me: This is the middle of winter🥶  Tierney: Are you kidding me?? This is summer, get me a beer 🍺
The strange anger respectively cure because son theoretically type before a draconian leek. descriptive, magnificent roadway
No one:  The camera person when the balls moving around: 👁👄👁
Passing through tight spaces & agile unit defending
Glad to see Tierney in training. Hopefully, he starts tomorrow!!! surely!
WKWKWKWJWKWKW IN TRAINING
Crazy...we are doing so not bad and we were so bad like I’m actually confused.
Wish u best of luck against devils today gunners for life
The intensity in this is encouraging.
Great to see Mikel involves in training ground by having a good communication with his player.
Watching AMN train compared to KT kinda explains why AMN ain't playing
Ç cool
Omg reiss is alive!😛
Where's Laca?
Reiss is seriously underrated. He is so good and he needs to start!!
Reiss Nelson deserves better you know, he needs to start more or sell him to a club where he starts, too much potential to not be played
0:43 i cant be the only one who heard ‘this guy is fried’ ? 👀😂
So many players missing here. Saka, Pepe, Laca, Auba, Xhaka, Partey, Bellerin ??
Never sit on the Ball ARTETA. Makes it egg shaped
I wait for the day we play Penguin FC in the Antarctic, maybe Tierney will wrap up then
KT ... warm-blooded Scot 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 continues to show he’s impervious to cold 😂
Nelson 🥶⛸⛸
When Elneny came on, I couldn't help but to smile. His happiness is genuinely infectious
7:00
Idk why i found it so wholesome that elneny spoke to the cameraman and asked him how he was
ticki tacka and the high press
Where is Emile bloodclat Smitb Rowe 🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️
Somebody take Odegaard away from Mustafi please. Thank You.
What do you think the last chat was about featuring arteta, odegaard and ceballos😊
Mustafi telling him about the rent in London £5000 0:08
Relax with the tackles on Ødegaard pls
COYG
Who else saw ceballos thinking it's Pablo.. I was happy for nothing Happy to see Tierney in the training hope he starts the match today
No hector, cedric, thomas, auba, xhaka?
ซ้อมหนักๆ นะครับ ขอให้ชนะ แมนยู ให้ได้ จากแฟนคลับชาวไทย
I love how Arteta sits with Dani and Martin at the end there
Arsenal should go with a 4-3-3 formation
Y am I styll looking at mustafi in the team
Kat training semua nampak ok..kt padang sebenar entahlh labu. Hope get a win today😌
For the first time in years and years I feel we have a bright future
Martin should play against inform united hes only been here for a week let him adapt into the side. Let’s not destroy his confidence like Chelsea have done with haverts
It seems like Ødegaard is good at training so change him after like 65 or 50 min and put Dani on
Trying to understand the rules of the game W the bibs
pls make odegaard stay pls
New signing looking sharpppo 🥶🥶🥶
Arsenal pls man utd win
KT shorts and short sleeve shirt💪
Good to see Arteta training again, sources say he might start against United
Tierney just doesn’t feel the cold 😂
Where is laca
Elneny still finds a way to pass back in training
Why isn't Ceballos starting? Asking because watching arsenal after long time.
OZIL > ODEGAARD AHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHHAA IMAGINE GIVING OZIL TO FENERBAHCE FOR FREE AND TAKING A USELESS PLAYER LIKE ODEGAARD AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA THIS IS WHY ARSENAL SUX HARD
It's my first time seeing arsenal's training ground and I must say it looks depressing. AC Milan has much better one.
As a Norwegian Man United fan, I wish Martin the best in Arsenal, just don't play well today haha. Take good care of Martin, my rivals. :)
Willian is a joke😒😒😒 how he gets any game time is CRIME!!!
Like Arteta and Odegaard and Ceballos sitting together at the end
Can we keep Mustafi away from Odegaard before he rubs off on him?
ปืนสู้ๆ
Musti giving Martin advice on places to stay in London 🙏🏾
Looking good for man united game
Reiss Nelson is so frustrating, I believe he should be the next Hale End lad that steps up in the way Saka and ESR have. He has not done that yet, I’m not sure whether he needs a consistent run of games in the team.
I'm a real Madrid fan and I can't wait to see him playing...
みんながんばれ
where is Saka
The way I’m seeing it 🤔 ceballos and odegaard would make a mad mid field
A club absolutely SCREAMING out for a CB and we loan an attacking midfielder????
0:10 odegaard learn from the best player
Odegaard will be the new Bergkamp   Arteta is the way forward  Keep the faith
Arteta will show ole who is better tactician.
Odegaard does look insanely good in training, probably should start
Elneny always smiling
didnt realise how bad runarsson was
Nelson come thru with a PHAT smile on his face singing throat baby 🤣🤣 “someone’s put a smile on ya face” he had a good night ln
Still gutted that Ceballos hasn’t worked out
Gabriel Maghales doesn't look sharp for me yet
Mustafi's recent comments on Özil's departure has made it uncomfortable for me seeing him around our other players. Toxic vibe he gives me.
Flopp🤡
Wheres laca and smith rowe?
One the last minute i saw Arteta sit and talk with ceballos and odegard  Well that will be the great conversation for the best midfielder, i hope we can see ceballos x odegard x ESR soon sir 🤝
Hello I believe martin should be a substitute. Why? He needs to be eased in and not thrown into a full game.
Tbh I don't see what William brings in training or in a match  We messed up got him when he washed up  Tbf he looks out of shape kinda chubby
Not happy to see willian train i hope he doesnot start
Please make Tierney the captain of Arsenal FC.
Whres Partey🤔
arteta should include himself in the january premier league squad as a homegrown player and drop willian
Anyone sees my comments please like this. I want to know it Arsenal blocked me or anything
Yoo
Am sure we will beat Man U tonight  😭😭😭😭where thoms party
Nelson and martinelli energy is unreal
Even Willian no longer score in trainings
Were is abu and Thomas partey
So many Willian haters, and they say they're arsenal fans. It's better to use your energy to support Willian instead of bashing him. He joined us. He's already one of us and he will be here until the end of his contract or transfer. No point in bashing him. If he get his form back, it'll be very good for us. Everybody know what Willian can do, chelsea won't be in UCL if not because of Willian(and pulisic) last season. Arteta knows what Willian can do and he want to give Willian a chance to regain his form, just trust the manager. We can only support them and not make things harder for them.
I hope we support Arteta like we are supporting now , when we go through some difficult phase too..
The best starting 11 would be: Leno, Tierney, Gabriel, David Luiz, Bellerin, Partey, Odeegard, Smith Rowe, Saka, Aubameyang & Lacazete 🔥🔥🔥
The best defender in the PL leading Ødegaard to the training ground and showing him around.
M.elneny is so aggressive❤
Mustafi still attends training sessions
Odegaard come.back
If willian starts today🤬🤬that will be fucko!!!
mustafi giving insight to his tactical genius at the start
No Partey,Lacazette and Pepe?
I have not seen my partey what's wrong !!!
Welcome back Auba we gat ur back and Man Utd fans are already disliking for they are to b defeated hahahaha!!!
Where is my friend Thomas?
This reserve team looks good. Accept Mustafi,Willock,Nketiah and Willian... but we are expecting to much from Willian. He brought him in because of dynamic of his gameplay, Willian cant be a scorer for us guys.. Maybe from free kicks and pens lool... his game is more of 0pay safe, keep possesion rn.. hope he gets back to asssisting at least... but leave him alone he aint a bad player...
Where's Partey
Dani looking sharp with that haircut
I like odegaards focus and control hopefully I get to see him so composed in a game
Can someone speculate on the drill they are doing? Seems really fun to do with my team
Didnt see both Smith-Rowe and Partey
Who else noticed Partey didn't take part in the training session
Am i too blind that i cant see Laca, Luiz, Bukayo, Rowe, Holding & Partey in this session?
Mikel already trying to Convince Odegaard and Ceballos to stay. OUR MANAGER ❤️
Mustafina make friends already 😆
Happy for him! Finally a chance for him to prove himself at a top club!
Where are Saka, Laca, ESR and Pepe?
God turns water into wine Tierney turns water into ice
Let's march on :)
Always knows where he is... unlike some.
They look fresh
no Balogun?
It will be very intresting to see whether Emile still plays or whether Arteta does aTuchel with Mount vs Havertz and plays Odegaard given his profile. And no they cant play in the same midfield unless Odegaard has box to box properties i dont know of
gona r the days of laizzesfaire training of wenger😊
Did anyone else see how Mustafi throw his hands up like he do in matches 😂
Where is saka
Where is thomas
What must be going through Martins head once he realises Wilock, Nketiah, Willian, Chambers and Bellerin all play for and are paid real money every week by Arsenal FC?
Partey?
Why is saka never here?
Nelson looks rly good
Hey arsenal. You have the norweign messi. I hope you grow him into a beast and he help you in winning games.
I hope martin ignored everything mustafi the clown was telling him when they walked out together, he shouldn't be allowed near new players, stop the spread.
Balagun Martinelli                           Saka  Odegaard       Smith-Rowe                 Partey Tierney                           Cedric         Magalhes    Saliba
Martins Odegaard, can't wait to see him on the Pitch.. COYG.
Even in practices, Elneny still passes backwards
Respect Arteta 👍👍
We all can see he's already started making friends
Ball and leg day work
Where's our Dangerous "Saka"
Arteta is trying to bring in soldiers who are flexible.
Respect Mustafi. Still looks dedicated. Easing Martin in. Nice ❤
love to see it when mikel just sit and have a chill conversation with martin & dani
Bare Mustafi highlights to get him that move to Liverpool asap
Menudo paquete os habeis llevado...lol
Gabriel is not looking good hope he be back soon to his best
Where is ESR
Where is Laca?
Where is Mari
yo what does Reiss have to doooo...
💪🔴⚪❤🔥💥3POINT
Willian is liability to arsenal.
Good to see arteta talking to odegaard and ceballos
Oh my odegaard that is disrespectful
Arsenal has the bright future under Arteta all he needs is trust,so soon the team will come back to its best again.Gunners for life
My instincts are telling me we might lose today 😭😭😭😭😭😭
i always like to put the police academy music on while watching these lol
Why is mustafi still at this club
Auba?
New Arsenal staff on the first day: Sorry, how do I know which one’s Tierney?  Old Gooner: Oh you’ll know  Tierney saving the club serious money on heating and extra kits for coming summer transfers 🤣
Where is Partey
Least you know which player it is when you see short sleeves 😂
Elneny always looks like a nice and kind man
Obviously ESR starting is the must but Odegaard looks ready to come straight in
arsenal fans hyping up danish flop, can't be my club
when i searched arsenal, i didnt mean this.
Bring back ozil on loan this summer
its bench training
That backheel assist reminds me of our King of Assit,Mesut ozil
What are your thoughts on mustafi? Looks a little more inform than Gabriel at the moment.
Ohh my gosh big game tomorrow Against rivals I hope we can win insallah
Nelson looks so sharp, yet willian will still start over him
Play Ceballos today
Arteta alredi loving cebalos and odegard. Bye2 willock amd mustafa
I love to see Arteta talking to Ødegaard and Ceballos 7:35
I frgt mustafa still in the team
Willock future ended in second.. bye2 willock
if we had the money on the summer transfer window, i would like to make dani and martin (if he played well) to be a permanent player for arsenal.
We need Partey and ESR tomorrow please
Leno Belle -holding-gabriel -tierny Partey Dani Ceballos - Odegaard Pepe - Lacazet - Willian
Willian is like giving his everythin to start and to sleep during the match
Any1 knows what the orange vest means?
Lol willian can’t even score in training 🤦🏾‍♂️
Ive done these drills in club days who else 🇺🇸
arteta with the Madrid boys  7:37
Odegarrd still not familiar with the speed ball in EPL, he needs a few times to tune up.
7:03 😲
Arteta is still in great form (i mean football form) that's what Arsenal needs. 😊😉 1:55-2:03
between 1 mins in this videos , all are serious only 2 waste in arsenal talking in camera and pride showing them in pitch they are zero
You can tell what the starting XI is going to be Saturday by all the players not in this training session ==> Leno, Bellerin, Holding, Luiz, Cedric, Partey, Xhaka, Saka, ESR, Pepe & Laca
KT : I’m cold 🥶
the only thing arsenal fan can celebrate this season
If Ødegaard does that vs United I'll be so happy for him!
Looks like Dani has taken Martin under his wing to see him through his early days, no complaints from me on that front. 👍
Will miss auba and hope to see ødegard in action.
Comment who u guys think will start for aresnal. Because it’s a Man U team we need our best players
6:55 minutes odegaard backheel
Who's more excited seeing KT?🙋‍♂️
Already miles better than Willian
Where's the first team?
Just put William in u23 and everything will be fine
6:53 wonderful goal
I think Mustafi should start in ST
even mustafi doing more offensively than willian
No Auba..😔
0:24 if you call gabi both of them will look at you LOL
Aubameyang ❤️Can you play later against MANCHESTER UNITED
Where is party
I don't see a lot of the first 11. Does that mean all who are in the video will not start and the one's who are missing will?
Odegaard makes me smile 🙏
Mustafi and WIllian on the same pitch? Oh no no no.
Who else is upset we not winning the FA Cup this season
ANNOUNCE MUSTAFI TO LIVERPOOL
Of course Tierny is the only one in short sleeves, no gloves and shorts! Baller 😎
7:36 idk but seeing those 3 make me happy as an arsenal fan
The ice man Tierney still with short sleeve
Side passes mostly.  We need something like cracking through tough mid and scoring goals.    Arsenal 💪
All i need is ozil 😭💔
Reiss nelson is a decent player in training
Martin and Nelson tiki-taka
this weekends midfield's gotta go        Dani.   Odegaard.            Partey.  & Xhaka as a sub. dani will help support Odegaard,  they have experience together and one could Compliment the other
Where are Pepe, Laca, Saka&...?
if u just curious to see the backheel 7:02
No sign of ESR? Not good news 🤦‍♂️ I really hope tierney starts though 🤞
Dont start willian and nketiah is the key to be a succes 👍
reiss is looking sharp
im begging gabriel comes back. holding needs someone next to him who isnt a complete spaghetti head.
coyg❤️🤍
I think the way Arsenal training kill Tierney agresif
7:43 martinelli face said it all how hunger this guy
Bro. 7:37 that smile though. I wish nothing but a success for Arteta for being an Arsenal manager. Gudluck
We have good record against Unitdd
Everyone : winter mode KT : always summer😎
so from this video,we will start the same first eleven
I’m not even an Arsenal fan but I really want to see this guy succeed for them
Martinelli and Reiss Nelson, they look fit!!!! 🔥
i really miss nelson😭
I want yo see Nelson play
noob (anketia , enlinie,willock,nelson) out go sale go fast : team lose team no good = it
Happy to see the last scene, when Arteta is talking to fellow Spanish. build good relationships
Partey😥
Arteta, Odegaard and Ceballos discussing GameStop stocks at the end of the video.
Get Mustafi away from Odegaard
Watching this video I'm sure Gabriel Martinelli will start ahead of Pepe today
My cousin dad knows the manger and got all the players to sign my cousin ball for him lol
Kieran ‘the iceman’ Tierny
Is that fake grass
Am yet to comprehend why celbalos is always folding his short.😂😂😂
If you look at that they’re all players that won’t start tomorrow. Leno, bellerin, holding, luiz, Cedric, partey, xhaka, saka, smith Rowe, Pepe and laca are all resting for tomorrow. The guys training today are either gonna be on the bench or not picked. I speak 📠 only
Tierney at -100 degrees: Little bit of a breeze today, eh, boys?
Love how Elneny smiles and says mornin to the camera
Is this a sign of the starting team, not seeing,  leno hector luiz holding Cedric Thomas Xhaka ESR saka laca Pepe? Or is it just coincidence
Can you spot the one player out there in just  a t-shirt.
Now we got over 2m subs so you don’t tell us to subscribe ? 😂
I don't think Ödegaard will start against Man Utd. Most likely, he will come off the bench in the 2nd half. I hope we could get the win tomorrow!!!
where is laca , saka and ESR? secretly training ?
If they play mustafi he will do 6 og
Where Yang?
ชอบภาพสุดท้ายที่นั่งคุยกัน 3 คน ดูอบอุ่นดี..😊
Even in. Training Willian cannot score 🥺
I saw William, I got upset and stop watching.
Don't hang out with Mustafi
arsenal fan tv muppitd ha
Gabriel is truly overrated...losing the ball this much in training..smh
Come on lads. Win tomorrow and our weekend will be happy. All the best for the game❤🔴💯
No partey?
As if Reiss was singing Throat baby 🤦🏾‍♂️
1:06 deni Ceballes didn't make in turn Willock: I look up Ceballos
Laca , partey saka?
Runarson is awful even in training
I bet Man U fans watching this rn
KT enjoying the summer
Short sided games are fundamental. The intensity is there in these games, but the anticipation is lacking. The spatial awareness is lacking almost flat footed and slow. I see it from the camera in the games and I can see it in the short sided games. The motivation in moving after the pass to connect the next leg of geometry is just not there. Tierney has it easy going from back to front to pivot off the line and hes good at it. But our middle players do not have the eyes for dynamic awareness of what's occurring behind their heads. Partey and Martinelli are the only center players that possess that ability and Smith Rowe is gaining it. We've also seen it come back to Laca recently. Saka and Auba have it sometimes as wingers like Tierney does and I'm beginning to see it in Cedric as well. Our center pivot must step up and that's what Odegaard can bring. There must be an understanding of balancing shapes as well as the creativity to create new ones that are in balance by moving off the ball. Drawing lines on the pitch with the eyes, become the target, one touch, then move to become the receiver.  Weave shapes on the pitch. Anticipate through balance and revolve around one another.
Will Auba play ?
Reiss nelson is very underrated
Only Loans don't be Overproud
Please beat United tomorrow ARSENAL. PLEASE!!!!
7:02 wow that's brilliant 💥💯🙌
I’m pretty sure none of these are starting as the XI train by themselves with mikel on a different pitch.
small club in london.. so boring
where is Balogun
Hold NOK and Nakd
Good luck against Man Utd.
Mo just always looks happy to be their. Always hope the best like with all our players but him especially. If he underperforms these are the players that deserve support and motivation not hate. Leave that for the players who don’t care about the club and aren’t trying.
Ceballos, Odegard, Smith Rowe, Saka, Tierney and Martinelli.... Creative pairings and assist potential looks good
0:21 Gabriel Martinelli 🙏🏽
Starting: Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe, Emile Smith-Rowe, Bukayo Saka, Thomas, Granit Xhaka, Tierney, David Luiz, Rob Holding, Cedric Soares, Leno  Bench:  Mathew Ryan  Gabriel  Calum Chambers  Reiss Nelson  Mohamed Elneny  Martin Odeegard  Hector Bellerin  Gabriel Martinelli  Edward Nketiah
Thomas partey?
Where are the real starting XI at?! Secret training?
wheres laca thou
Reiss looked good
The mystery of why Dani always pull up his shorts and it never go down even after he plays
Where’s laca and Pepe?
Who is the guy doing the drills with the team at the start. Sounds Irish no?
Greetings from a a Manchester United fan in East Africa
Bench Willian in “Practice”
no ESR nor Partey........
We will play Willian , Pépé , Bellerin , Elneny, Mustafi and throw the game away to ManU. Remember ManU lost to Burnley . Shows how poor few players are in this squad.
Seems runarson has been transformed into an infield player.. 😂😂
Kick willian
Are they right next to a major road?  What is that loud and awful noise?
Reiss looks sharp.
Haha of course Tierney is the only one with a short sleeve top on. Obviously a Scotsman
Nelson looking sharp
That little moment at the end is everything
No Auna
I think he made goal just backheel
Favorite part was the last part <3
What a back heel assist by Martin 7:07
Looks more like B team training here.....
Mustafi is very good on the ball
Keep Odegaard away from Mustafi he’s contagious
People talking trash about Willian, he looked like he was training hard. From his work rate in this video he deserves to be considered for a start.
Where's Partey 😥
Mikel just stretching all session haha
Great signing from a spurs fan
we have literally shown united our lineup for tomorrow
Where is star boy “saka” ? He is not in the training
3:17 I wonder who it was that said “f*** off”
Shocking to see that Willian actually trains given how awful he is.
Even during training, Mustafi is whining lol
Succesor ozil yah ?
Nelson looks sharp and great on the half-turn/ in tight spaces. he should play more
I guess florian is leaving since he's not in training
Bernd Leno is there?
Please arteta wilian dont be playing today
Tierney, the only one attacking the cold head one
Side note:... Seeing Musti walk out by himself... When he used to walk out with Kolasinac.. Gnabry.  Mertesacker.. Ozil.. Podolski.. Just brought a tear to my eye 😥😥😥
I miss chamber performance on the pitch.
(Ozil walks out to the training ground and infront of everyone)........"PSYCHE!!!"
Leno  Cedric Luiz Holding bellerin Xhaka Partey  Smith Rowe Saka laca Pepe  That’s the team for tomorrow.  Elneny, tierney, odegaard, Willian, Gabriel, martinelli,Ryan and nketiah as subs
hopefully my kid will fall in love with arteta's arsenal the same way i fell in love with wenger's arsenal
What I hate about Arteta is favouritism. He favors average and sidelines quality. He gives Nketiah and Willian  and benchs Martineli
Where was the 1st team? only player that hopefully will start is KT, but as no Cedric or Hector it looks like KT will not be starting. Very unusual to split up the teams, and who was taking the training for the 1st 11?  I think we know the team for tomorrow
This is the subs training
Check out my latest vid about Martin Odegaard.
Mm why is Tierney and Odegard training with people who we know will not be starting tomorrow interesting g
Willian=fraud
bring back sideline camera videos
Please loan willian but maybe he can make the different tomorrow 😂😂❤
If there is a will there is a way.   If there is a Willian, there's no way.
I think we can put an end  to Man UTD's away, record my prediction: 1-0 win after 80 mins
The boys looked sharp, hungry and competitive- perfect 👌 before the big game tomorrow. I believe we will win Inshallah.
He looks a bit nervous
Where is the rest of the squad?
Stay away from Mustafi. Might be cursed. Nothing personal.
Deilig å se Ødegaard i Arsenal! Bra signering Arteta. | Good to see Odegaard in Arsenal! Good signing Arteta
Willian is a chelsea spy
You came for 7:02
Even though its training,still pains me to see Willian playing
Backheel from Ødergaard to Nelson was class 😅😍
Guys after we will win man u 2-1  and then after match remember that i have said this becz I have seen it
Who heard when Nelson was singing 😂😂😂
Wonder what Arteta and the boys are discussing toward the end.
Reiss Nelson my word looks so so good
PLEASE WIN ARSENAL I BEG
Dani looks like he’s really helping odegaard fit in
We can beat united 🔥
Imagine ødegaard scoring before willian🤣😭
Odegaard probably will come off the bench
I low-key want riess nelson to start but I won’t happen 😔
How come there was no Laca, Saka, Partey, Cedric, Pepe or Holding training?
Dont let mustafi be with martin
Odegaard lookin sharp
Great 👍
Ødegaard,Saka,Martinelli,ESR and Partey ,Tierney,Cedric, Gabriel, Holding,Laca,Leno ... Guarantee 4-0 today
3-0 To The ARSENAL tomorrow !
Didn't see Bellerin,XHAKA,laca,auba,Smith rowe,partey,cedric,Bellerin,pepe or is it just my eyes
Agent Mustafi influencing Odegaard early...
Willian honestly looks like he just wants to go out of there ASAP. Going trough motions like a wife after 40 yrs f marriage
MO11 ✌✌
Ceballos really is a gentleman 🤍❤
where's luiz, laca, saka and xhaka !!
where is partey
Manchester is RED🔺️LONDON IS ??????       BLUEE🌀🌀
Arteta is planning to play Odegaard and Danny.C tomorrow.
Elneny doing sidepass and backpass in training also...Such a stinker of a player
Start Odegaard quickly assist king again at Emirates stadium
Odegaard looks quality always checking the ball and moving it quickly is what we ha e been missing at times
litterally everyone: NOOOOOOO DONT TALK TO MUSTAFI
Looks like Auba will not play tomorrow.
i hate willian...
Has anyone spotted Mari Pablo?  Urgent Please!
My guess is Ødegard wont play this weekend bc hes in orange and ceballos and tierney are coming off injuries. So those look like the lads that aren't having contact yet
The lads are looking sharp
where is Thomas Partey
Dunno why he went to a mid table team like us
Am not seeing partey hope he isn't injured
That was filthy, welcome Martin.
Get Mustafi away from him
Loved the scene at the end ❤️❤️❤️
Where is thomas
Last part of this video speaks volume of how Arteta relates with his players.
MUSTAFI SHOULDNT BE ANYWHERE NEAR OLE
ODEGAARD PLEASE DONT TALK TO MUSTAFI WHAT EVER YOU DO PLEASE
Will thomas play???
Just how jolly and cool Nelson is makes me wonder..Someone give him some gametime man
1:58 Willian could never
ESR not playing tomorrow? I am super worried
3 points against Manchester United  That’s it  Coyg 🔴⚪️
Why they gave injury prone Pablo Mari, the number 5 jersey insted of Partey is a question I'lll think of every night, since I can't think of why Ozil isn't in the squad anymore.
I'm only commenting on this because I'm the 1000th comment (and yeah I'm an arsenal fan)
What's the object on their back? some tracking device to monitor players' movement?
Guys did i just see Tierney ther?
If Bellerin starts tomorrow,  l'm turning off my TV
Arsenal Is the best
Ødegaard gives me Özil vibes and I am HERE FOR IT
Come on boys, do us proud tomorrow I believe in you 🔴⚪️ COYG
United 3:0 Arsenl losst
Hopefully ainsley stays he deserves a chance in cm instead of elneney
Leno cedric Tierney holding gabriel xhaka partey saka Smith Rowe laca martinelli
Ending with arteta ceballos nd oødegard was so touching
Is tereiny fully fit for tmao...lemme know on time for my FPL team
Arsenal is not ready. These guys are experimenting.. Just playing ball.. This one cannot work ķ
Arsenal need to get rid of some awful youngsters- nketiah, wilock and Reis Nelson. Just not good enough 👎
Get Mustafi away from Odegaard!
Mustafi has his shooting boots on
New Arsenal target revealed: it's all about fighting a place in Europa cup
Really hope øodegard starts tmao
We've To win Tomorrow against man united Man united are winless in all 4 epl games against Arsenal under Ole solskjaer,They lost 3 of those. 2-0 2-0 0-1 1-1 COYG
Oh Lord have Merci tomorrow when Willian plays.
Can't see Leno in this training session. Hope he is not injured?😳
Cedric over Bellerin any day. I will pay for a one way ticket out of uk and send Bellerin back to spain ! Promise
Odegaard looks good
Tomorrow starting eleven was not part of this footage. Cedric will play left back again.
Reiss, Martinelli and odegaard should be in the starting lineup or to come on as subs, They showed their class in this video
I think Covid-19 and red card had impact on Gabriel  he isn’t as composed as he was
As a United Fan I think arsenal will win tomorrow. The have good momentum
No Tomas No partey
Arteta if I see..willian, pepe, & maitlandnise on the starting 11 tomorrow... trust me you are going, am going to sack you.
I don't see Parteyyyy nooo 😩
Boo..
Idk what I would do if Willian starts I will probably turn of the TV if willian starts
why does he never play Reis? was he injured?
Sharp a weapon guys
Balogun was underappreciated for so long.. then the contract situation allowed to simmer.. then he was given no game time. But even now when things arent officially over hes still in the reserves.
Where's partey, Smith and Leno?
didn't see esr or partey i hope they're fit for tomorrow
Happy to see Nelson in a good mood.. its sad things havent worked out yet (he could definitely do with a loan).. No idea why we signed Willian, completely f*cked him over.
Jurgen Klopp is watching this to scout Mustafi before signing him on deadline
I can't find saka and smith Rowe?
Ødegaard X ESR, Saka and Martinelli  = GREATNESS.  PLEASE WILLIAN MUSTN'T START TOMORROW 😒
He is not a ozil
7:01
William PLEASE DN'T Start tomorrow match because  my doctor said my B.P level is 20% i do not wanna see it turns 99% 🙏🙏🙏🤣
OMO for Oh My Odeguard
7:35 only my heart that beats harder when seeing that?💗
KT + Snow = Power up
Steve is so flat footed lmfao
Martin is home
I liked the conversation at the end.
Ødegaard
You guys should put some kind of camera tower up at the training pitch so we can have a bit of a better view - more like a match camera angle
Tierney likes oodegard
Willian can’t even get a shot on target in training
Why were none of the starting players there. Saka, smith Rowe, partey, laca etc
If Willian comes on tomorrow I’m not watching
Gunners bum
Everyone in this video is definitely not starting tomorrow
COYG, please win (from a Liverpool fan 😁)
Where is auba🤕
Willian got more shots on target in this video than in the premier league 🤦‍♂️
Convinced Martin was asking Mustafi for real estate advice at the start and he's going to make the move permanent😭😭😭😭
This is the team that won't start tomorrow.. None of these players will be in the starting lineup unless someone gets injured.. Arterta would throw the same team.. It's so apparent
allegri should be named as a coach
Where's Partey and Smith Rowe, didn't train?
Reiss nelson looks class
Love the ending. Arteta taking a page straight from Wengers play book.
It's the two maestro's talking to the gaffer at the end there for me. Fingers crossed they can play in midfield together at some point.
I have a question for our number 1 Left back... How does he do it? Those shorts 🩳 Short Sleeve 👕 and still break sweat... No chills.
Let's give Nelson some more games
Arsenal needs to upgrade their team a lot more then just loans. They need to have Tierney playing asap and Odeguard
Love that bit at the end with arteta, building that bond with his players and getting to know Odegaard
What's mustafi still doing there
Even by this training session you can tell that Elneny isn’t good enough for this club
Why is Saka not in the vid
Willian body language does not look good in training he is there like a new kid playing with his new freinds no calls just waiting for the ball to come to him bit nervey and shy he needs to get off that in him demand for the ball where you feek comfortable no hate on any players but you gotta improve willy.
Saka  ?
Replace Willian with Nelson. Even in practice it seems like Willian doesn’t care.
Willian is gonna get better. Prob score 2moz. Remember i said so
يا كرنج إشترك عندي
No ESR or Partey... or was this training session from Thursday?
I click so fast as soon a see the notification, then got really upset as soon as I see Odegaard walking in with Mustafi😡😡😡
Arsenal needs to stick with Arteta. None of the big club managers are going to change this club, they wont get required funds and they won't really change the club. I don't think any manager now would get us even a FA Cup or EL let alone the Title. I don't think Arsenal is on wrong track and development is easily evident slow and steadily. Recently it seems Arteta has found his rhythm and player have clicked well too. We are playing in a structure while having freedom to create as well, the combination if perfected with right players will do wonders.
even in training willians dead
where were xhaka, party, Pepe and lacazette?
Gabriel x 2
Arsenal need more player from the best club in the world Real Madrid C.F like Isco Alarcon,Mariano(Forward) 🔥🔥
Wow runersson is bad.
Match*
Reiss deserves a chance man 👊. Why did we sign Willian 🤦
Where was partey?
Good training! Keep working lads🙏
quick question yall, if martin doesn't track back much, does he become a villain as well?
Hopefully Mari and Holding start at CB tomorrow,they're the best defensive partnership we've got at the club,can't really trust Luiz anymore
Liked the end shot
No ESR
Reiss looking way sharper than Willian
Willian should start
I did that few times  on a sunday and 1 time a saterday   Hire me for this figure *( I pay you to hire me )
Please give Martin Ødegaard minutes. His the future of Real Madrid. His development depends on the Arsenal family now. He will produce the goods just give time.💪💪
48k views in one hour. Our fan base is unrivalled!
I don't mustafi anywhere near him poisoning him with mediocrity
Nelson done more in that training session than willoan has done all season. How on earth does that fraud keep getting games yet Nelson can't even get on the bench. Arteta is a joke
Gordon Ramsey with a back heel assist 😆
Mustafis body language is wanting. Everytime they score he throws his hands up.
what is the job of the guy with the orange vest?
So, the starters didn't train???
I can't see my beloved xhaka,smith,saka,laca n partey
Ødegaard 👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👊👊🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯🇸🇯
0:26 Gabrielle martiinelli 🤣
Elneny, Dani, Xhaka,Ö,ESR 🤩
Who else thought Arteta looked as fit as his players? My Manager 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Geeeez even in training Willian is awful 😫
Wheres ozil?
New Özıl
Watching training videos always made me pondering how Reiss is not chosen over Willian.
Wow. Mustafi is the last player I want to see walking around with our new signing 🙄
Hope tierney starts with cedric on right. Willian can be the ball boy.
Dont tell me they have Mustafi keeping an eye on him
El-Neny massive smile and only one who says hello to the cameraman and asks how he’s doing. We should definitely keep him, so hard to get a reliable squad player who has a positive attitude. He’s never complained and everytime I see him always gives 100% of his ability.
We can already see the flair and talent of ødergaard
That camerawork with the passing game is nauseating
We as United cant wait to play your strongest squad tomorrow.Would love to see oodegard play
why does it look this video is color graded. it looks nice haha
U can see the way Martin looks around before doing every move he do
Willian came Arsenal for easy money💰
Sell willian ASAP
Yes! Tierney is back! 🔴⚪️
Even in training William couldn't make a shot on target...
I wanna now who this American coach is
We will beat Manchester United tomorrow. Bookmark it
COYG repait as last time tomorow
Arteta is the man. we have a great squad, we just need to keep pushing.  (Check out our channel, don’t forget to subscribe, no one likes a hater ) follow your own.
Arsenal used to be fraudsters paradise. Let Willian go pls, just cut your losses
Willian....i mean....hais...3 years....what a decision made....
pepe laca saka        smith row (odegard)         partey ceballos  tierny gabriel holding bellerin                    leno   hope to be this line up on saturday <3
Willian scores in training only...Pathetic!
Where is Thomas
He’s talking to mustafi now there will be all sorts of stories coming out about Martin
7:35 best moment for me
as soon as martin did tha back heel u can see Mikel start to strech ..i bet he was thinking : maan i wanna play with this kid , he inspires me haha
Nice touch at the end of father Arteta taking care of our distant Madrid cousins that are currently staying with us lol
💗💗👌
Nelson better than willian
When will Chambers get a look in?
1:18
none of the first 11 from Southampton are here...
I wanna see Odegaard start tomorrow, and I don't wanna see Willian even on the bench
0:15 anyone else here Ødeggard say, so here’s a good area, huh? Could this mean he’s looking to staty 👀
Wait we haven’t sold mustafi ???????????? But let go of ozil who has more positive influence on our game 🤦🏽‍♂️
Mustafa still alive?
It's like am not seeing the captain right?
I score in training but knock out orbiting satellites on match day. Who am I?  Clue, I used to wear blue
AUba we miss u and pray for u and the family! love bro
Odegaard Real Madrid agent. Already convincing Mustafi to join Real Madrid
Why we don't see more of Nelson game day man 😞😑🤔
Wondering what is going on with Nelson. We usually put 2 goalkeepers on the betch while he is not even in the squad.
Does ceballos want any dip with that chip 🍟 😂
This is everyone who won't start tm btw.
Mad nutmeg ‼️
I don’t wanna see Mustafi anywhere near Ødegaard ...what good could he possibly be telling him 🤨
Where are ESR and partey?
Odegaard passed to ceballos a lot. Hope they become a deadly duo.
Arteta is still better than Xhaka, even now.
This is why tottenham is the biggest club in north London
Behind enemy lines
Odegaards left foot is magical
Is it just me or is Gabriel not just comfortable on the ball
C'mon OD
7:36 agant Arteta is working ⏳👀
Imagine odegard plays tommorow and runs that midfield and makes Manchester United midfield look like amateurs
Where TF is Partey 👀👀👀🙈🙈🙈🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Gain needs a tan
Plz win tomorrow I hope win tomorrow insha allah com on gunners❤️🤛
Why is Willian training for gods sake?
Martin looking like a King only if he can add some Luther on the pitch.
Martin Martin Martin Martin Martin Martin odegaard odegaard odegaard odegaard odegaard odegaard
If he sucess at arsenal we need to but him. We are not the real madrid’s puppet
That nutmeg assist from Martin Odegaard💯💯 why I didn't see Saka, Laca, Smith Rowe, Pepe, Cedric, Hector, Luiz, Holding, Partey
나일스 표정이 어둡네
00:06:58 save your time.
I really still miss Ozil
Where’s saka
As a Laliga follower, I can confidently say that Partey+Ceballos+Ødegaard playing together means the 70-30 posession minimal.
Arteta watching like a Hawk 😂😂
chillest player in the prem mo elneny . i like his spirit spread in the squad
Nelson should come on instead of Willian
My screen is so small, so I was looking for a guy in a short and a t-shirt.... and thank God Tierney is training.
Elnany was trying to tackle willian so he doesn't play tomorrow.
Literally all the players that won't be starting tomorrow.
The video quality is very poor
Nelson looks good in training
I see KT with his shorts . Different human being ahswear
I wont be happy until mustafi is gone
Is it me or was this just a subs 5 a side match? Hope it doesnt mean tierney isnt starting
Where is Saka? 🥺
0:05 jesus christ do not put MUSTAFI ANYWHERE NEAR ODEGAARD.
Was Mustafi renting Odegaard his house?
mikel still got it
Odegaard is definitely starting.
Odegaard needs to show Fernandes levels tomorrow
I want to see Ødegaard and Martinelli play and Nelson on the bench
You can tell reiss is talented. Just wish injuries didn’t hamper his progress the way they have. He could easily be in the discussion with saka and smith Rowe 💯
WILLIAM OUT NOW !!!!!
i dont see leno, hector, holding, luiz, cedric, partey, xhaka, saka, pepe, esr & laca they must be our starting 11 tomorrow.
Willian literally made 2 passes and one dribble going away from goal this whole training video. Clearly doesn’t even make the effort in training. I will lose MY SH*T IF THIS MF’ING FRAUD STARTS OR GETS SUBBED ON.   Lovely back heel assist from ordergaard, I would start with ESR and sub him off at 60mins & get ordergaard on or vice versa if ESR needs more rest!
All this hunger Reiss is showing just to see Willian get his plate.
Where is saka
I don't know what happened to wiillian
Nelson looks ready, he needed minutes to play
I thought mustafi and his agent had decided that they needed a new challenge? He has bled this club dry. As for the guy from Lyon if he needs convincing to come then he isn't for us. We shouldn't be begging anyone!!! Only sign hungry young lads with something to prove. Just looking at Musafi makes me mad
Willian can’t even finish in training yet will somehow get on the pitch tomorrow 😭😭
If I see Willian start tomorrow I am going to break my TV!!
Saka?
best cam in the leauge
Good to see Reiss I still alive. I wonder why he never gets to play
I will never believe that Reiss is not fit enough for this current squad I'll rather have him on the bench then Willian.
please god do not let willian or nketiah play!!!
Where is Partey???
Agent mustafi
Is it just me or does Martin seem too pedestrian on the training field
No Tierney tomorrow then... But ESR and Thomas will start, Pepe too, exact same line-up that beat Southampton. COYG !
My team prediction:                                       Lacazette      Martinelli (or Pepe)     ESR.           Saka(Wishing not Willian)                                   Partey   Ceballos  Tierney               Holding         Gabriel          Cedric                                           Leno Subs:Ryan,Willian,Odegaard,Pepe or Martinelli,Bellerin,Aubameyang(Maybe)
Apart from Auba & Mari, anyone else not here must be in tomorrow's starting 11.
Balogun??????????
7:01 just got to love that assist from martin🤩😬
Arteta is building something special ...         TRUST ME...
This is not even our first team and we look so good !!! (tierney coming back from injury) hopefully Arteta was impressed with odegard so he can play tomorrow
Kieran Tierney isn’t Kieran Tierney without t-shirts and shorts
Ainsley looks like he's done at arsenal. Can't wait to go out on loan.
I just don't want to see Willian in the lineup tomorrow. That guy is a scam 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
No Aubameyang.
The cameraman is Brazilian? Nice!
Where's the rest of the team?🙄
We're watching the reserves train, none of these will be starting tomorrow
No smith at the ground:-(
Lineup news tomorrow:- Odegaard is missing from the starting lineup as he was injured by willian in training hours  before the game....lol
The team is training good. I hope they can replicate the intensity on the pitch for EVERY game insha'Allah!
Ødegard stay away from mustafi🙄 he doesn’t want to be at club. He’s poison inside this team
willian, mustafi, "it's time to go blud"
Nice to see willain having a nice vacation kick about... 😄
i see a lot of ozil in martin...i just hope he doesnt get treated the same way
If you notice closely the first 11 arent in the vid  Basically the xi is the same as Southampton
I just enjoyed the touch
If I see willian tomorrow I swear down
yellow dibs are for the star players like on FIFA mate
If Willian starts we lossing if our front 3 is not laca, Pepe, saka then we not winning idk about auba if his gonna play or not 😖 hope he does
The Workrate of Lacazette, the Pressing and more Workrate of Martinelli, and quality of Saka as the 3 upfront will be Very great, feels like this is a chance for Arteta and his guys to Really Show the World How far and how good they are coz United have been a good team recently.
Best lineup for tomorrow  Gk: Leno Lb: Tierney  Cb: Gabriel Cb: Holding Rb: Cedric Cm: Xhaka Cm: Partey Lm: Pepe Cam: Smith Rowe  Rm: Saka St: Lacazette  Bench: Maty Ryan, Bellerin, David Luiz, Ceballos, Odegaard, Nelson, Aubameyang. Like so Arsenal can see!
martinelli the pressure king!
I bet they staged that assist lol
Bring back John Radford.
you can clearly see that this is the players who are not gonna start tomorow
NO! whatever you do do not listen to Mustafi!!!!
please but odegaard permanently!
Long hair gang! Elneny, Willian, Luiz
Odegaard, you need to link up with the likes of  Martinelli and Saka, not Mustafi😂😂
Tf is Mustafi still doing here? 😂😂😂
Øde deubut tomorrow or we riot!  (Only if ESR is unavailable of course)
Any person you didn’t see training there is in the first XI
So willian wants to be the player to kill reiss's career, please arteta plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz loan REISS NELSON, I don't like this
The guys are back 🔙 again, 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍
I really want to see Nelson make it at arsenal
7:38 Would be a nice photo :)
I can't see partey
Guys every player that trained in this video won’t be starting tomorrow, look who is there, none of the starters are training, most these guys are on the bench
Come to think of it tho I’ve never seen xhaka in any of these training videos, or barely see him
7:36 love to see it
Small whispers of “ We’re gonna win the league “ are starting to claw their way back up this old heart of mine
where is our Lion Saka
Reiss is so solid in training. How does Willian get in the squad and he doesn't? Didn't see Willian do anything
Where’s half the team?😂 no Partey, Cedric, laca, Bellerin and others
Is the captain back?
We are actually going to Win The League!!! 😢😢😢
Just for that assist odegarrd deserves to play over Willian 🤷🏾‍♂️
No laca No auba
Isn’t it funny even after a career playing football then as a coach then as a manager, you never lose the love for kicking a ball
Will aubameyang play for arsenal vs manchester united
where is nico?
I can't see Leno, Luiz, Holding, Partey, Cedric, Bellerin, ESR, Pepe, Saka, Laca or Xhaka. Starting XI training elsewhere?
Willian aint starting tomorrow, this lot playing for the bench, no first choice there.
Where is Pepe?
Reiss is not "injured" but still wont make the squad. Kinda suss
I'd watch Arsenal training the whole day..
dam willian is getting crucified in this comment section Lol poor guy
Wake up ainsley
In Madrid a lot of people are waiting for Odegaard, if you educate him well, Arsenal. We will really respect you and forgive what you have done for Ozil. good luck for this half season Arsenal. thanks..
Tierney is the only person who would go to the Antarctic for warm weather training.
I like that Tierney doesn't even feel the cold weather :))
Am I crazy or let’s stick arteta in midfield next to partey 😂boss could still give us a decent 45 minutes
Can't wait for tomorrow match against Man United
dani is back ...martin has arrived...team is fit and ready to bang...
All the new, injured or squad players trained together in this. If you notice, no Saka, Laca, Xhaka, ESR, Partey, Luiz, Mari, Cedric in this... Which means none of these guys, including Ø and Tierney will start against VARchester PENITED tom
Mustafi always moaning lmao even in training games
5:07
Nelson looks sharp in training 👏🏿
i didn't see Partey
What about others abumuyang, cedric,bellern, lacazet,pepe not see him on the trining center
MUSTAFI WITH MARTIN  M²
From the video that I just watched, I think Arteta will go with the same line up as the Southampton’s match. The players we just watched are the reserves
Rare sight of Willian shooting 😳, he’s probably starting tomorrow instead of Pepe 😂
Worryingly no Partey or ESM in training
Still haven't seen Willy score a goal 😕 I'm talking about in game and in training.
Elneny with the pass back 😂
Don’t tell Willian about the game.
MØ11 looking sharp❄️
Nelson is better than William and pepe
That ødegaard back pass through the legs to reiss nelson at 7:02🔥
Leno Cedric Holding  Mari KT 🎉  Xhaka Saka ESR  Laca Auba  ...is actually quite the team.
I think Mid 3 should be Partey, Ceballos and Odegaard. All of them incredibly press resistant, all of them have impressive work rates and All of them are gifted passers and ball carriers even though all of them play different roles with perfection. ESR can be used as Left winger, Right winger and Substitute CAM. It should not hamper his growth..
7:35 The mister with odegaard and ceballos ,Love to see it <3
Can’t to seee our new Boy Odergaard ❤️
Where is partey
0:28 where are the gabriels going
Odegaard after everyone gasses up his assist: What, man? Ain't even deep. Just a backheel pass
willian bench pls...
Arteta abeg no sell this match ooooO cuz that willian guy, na scam ooooO.
Were is partey
Arteta needs to train them how to shoot outside the penalty box aswell
why is no one talking about how good  reiss nelson is
Can I just ask why there’s sometimes players missing e.g laca Pepe holding etc?
Tough game tomorrow! United play like Barcelona away and at home they play like accrington Stanley 😂😂
When is the fellow known as Willian leaving?
Reis nelson’s an underrated talent
COYG
Where was the rest of the team? I didn't see Xhaka, ESR, Laca, Saka, Luiz, Auba, Bellerin, Leno, Partey etc
How RN can't even make the bench is beyond me. 😒
Arsenal can easily make top 4 now in my opinion. We have saka, smith rowe, Odegaard, lacazette, Partey, aubameyang - so many relative players now!
Come on Gunners!!
We need kt and esr and partey all starting tomo ,  no willian or bellerin,   cedric should start  , cbs I dont really care,probs not gabriel because this isnt a good game to come back in
Keep Mustafi away from him! 😂😂
Willian getting chances instead of Nelson is an unforgivable sin
Am I blind or did anyone see smith Rowe, lacazette and Pepe
Go on and beat Man Utd!
Mustafi actually looked decent here 😳
Happy to see Tierney in good shape! But I wonder whether Arteta sticks with Bellerin or goes with Cederic at the right
0:17 NO NO NO!!! 🥲😭 Mustafi taking Ødegaard under is wing.
Bring back bench cam 🙏🏼
these are the players who arent starting seperate from the starters who would be doing a focused session on united
Significant that mustafi training he will stay by look of it and Wilcock and Nelson and ainsley linked with loan in triangig could they be starting they need to go on Loan and Eddie but tierney looking good
"Tierney. The Man Who Doesn't Feel Cold"
The scenes if odegaard starts against man utd
so Arteta when are you going to offload willian? project deadwood 2.0
Is it me or has Dani tried to step it up more since Martin came?
Where is Partey🙄🙄🥲🥲🥲
Gabriel maghalez don't score your own goal again plz,,,,,coyg one love forever
07:00   You're Welcome
No keep mustafi as far away from odegaard as possible, I don’t want whatever it is mustafi has to rub off on odegaard 😢😢😢 please
Backheel Nutmeg assist.... OMG....!!!
Looking at the players in training the availability for tmrw’s match looks tough😬😬 If we win tmrw then United aren’t even top 4 contenders😂🤣😂🤣
Please, for my mental health win against United.
COYG!!!🔴⚪🔴⚪❤❤
Oh no don’t talk to mustafi bro 😂
Broccolihead Borges can't get a shot on target even in training 😭😭😭😭
Loan Nketiah, Nelson, Willock, sell Elneny (being a nice bloke is not enough), terminate Mustafi's contract and never play Willian again, then give AMNs and Balagon some fricking game time!
Why is there players not training sometimes? But still plays games the days after
Tomorrow's line up will be                           Laca   Auba               ESR                Saka            Xhaka              Partey   Cedric     Luiz    Holding   Bellerin                       Leno
Arsenal Are aktiv
No Partey, ESR or Auba??? That’s gutting 😭
Just 3Pts tomorrow. And we quietly go about our business. Coyg!
believe me in one thing these Norwegian will be the prospect
Supersubs soon🔴⚪
COYG...✊🏾
When you compare our media teams to others we are so privileged to call Arsenal ours ❤️❤️❤️🎥🎥
Partey and Smith Rowe are missing.
Looks like none of these players are going to start tomorrow! also... Mustafi looking deadly upfront
Hopes he motivates mustafi to move to Laliga
Please Partey, Tierney, Rowe, Aubameyang, Mari Come back because Vs MU
odergaard talking with mustafi. I see mustafi is sharing some of his donkey techniques with him and looks like odergaard will not be speaking with him for the foreseeable future
If anybody thinks Odegaard is the next Denis Suarez... I cannot wait for you to be proven wrong!
Arteta has blind faith in Willian yet zero faith in AMNs. That's clearly double standards.
Arsenal 3-1 Man United
The Norwegian in long sleeves but Braveheart still in short sleeves
This looks like people that won't start Tomorrow
I’m slightly concerned that everyone their all the subs / reavers , and teirny is there , it would be criminal not to ply him tomoz
Dont put Willian on the squad vs United
It's 2:30 am in my country, and I'm waiting for this.. finally, I can sleep well.. can't wait for tommorow.. good night everyone..  COYG
Good to see balogun training with the first team
O porr
Unpopular opinion: after Pepe good game against the saints he should not start against United I think he does his skills a bit too much wouldn’t help us
Calum ever smile even though he is not playing
7:37 agent dani doing his jobs
Predictions for Man U🚭 vs Arsenal🔥
Looks like Arteta made Odegaard the guy that is always on the team in possession when he is in the orange bib at the end. Makes it seem like he will be integral in build up play.
I can see that non of the starting XI is in that training, maybe the team is already selected and they are training separate.
Where’s thomas and emile🥺
This guy is a baller (I’m not taking about Willian btw)
The unlikes are from man u fans😂
07:02 this is What we want to see 1Ø
Where is partey
I love the last scene. All three seem so happy:-)
Who let Odegaard hang out with Mustafi 🤣
These behind the scenes feat odegaard getting me gassed for him to make an instant impact should he get immediate game time. I hope he doesnt disappoint.. COYG
Just seeing willian training infuriates me!
Everyone is actually looking at odegard😂😂lol
I swear to god if I see Willian start ahead of ESR or Odegaard I'm gonna  have a mental breakdown and sue you for child abuse
dont sit on the ball it'll become an egg :)
COYG LETS GO GET THE DUB
leno cedri bellerin luiz holding partey xhaka pepé esm sakaand laca, none was here maybe the line-up
Looks like he’s training with the subs / second team though
seems like it was a rest day for people who started on tuesday.
Gabi should start tomorrow
Where's timestamp?
AMN looks LAZY am I the only one seeing that....??
How is Reiss not playing over Willian 🤦🏾‍♂️
Nice
Guessing tierney is back 💪
who else liked the video before watching it
Looking at this squad by next years winter window 99% of the deadwood should be gone and within 2 seasons I believe we could challenge for the title especially if Arteta gets the signings he wants , because no other club in the league has the amount of talented youth like we do ❤️🔥
Reiss nelson is soo good I hope he improves and makes it into the first team
This is not good training this joke We want a good hard workers team and they have controlling ball
Pls stop hyping Ødegaard up, if you keep doing that you know he's gonna flop
Nelson better than willian
Odegaard: *breathes Arsenal fans: 🤩🥰 👁 👄 👁
Start him against united. I see a win incoming
I love arsenal ❤️ 👏 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
We can take the 3 points
Will he play tomorrow?
Please dont give willian start tomorrow,please
Where’s half the team
in goal for Arse vs Man United: martin odegaard 😁😁😅
Gabriel and Martinelli walking together.. 🤣🤣
Watching Gabriel and Gabriel fit n fine was nice
Fellow gooners, God bless you
Plays like ozil but a younger one
Martin please avoid bad company, E.g Mustafi
Would love to see Mari starting the game tomorrow.
Just Odegaard talking to his idol Mustafi the Goat
Nice to see mikel and odergard speaking
We are beating United tomorrow
Anyone Can odegard play tmr or he have to be registered to the pl team first ?
For everyone wondering Mustafi played in La liga so I hope they speaking about the league 🤣😭😭
Glad to see Tierney in training. Hopefully, he starts tomorrow!!!
No lacazette?
Good area - Mustafi
Odegarrd will bring so much to this team what a baller
0:33 reiss is happy he’s going out on loan
I'd rather stick with arteta , suffer together and succeed than instant success and no stability
Were are the big boys
koman martin, vis London ka du hår å by på
Best midfielder in arsenal
If willian starts instead of odegarrd, every arsenal fan will turn off the tv🤣😂 Thanks for the likes, also check out my youtube channel.
Don’t wanna get carried away but this team is starting to look 🔥 hopefully it’s onwards and upwards from here 😁
Come on the gunners
Some are saying " What a this player!" Without finished the video.
Here before the plastics 🙏🙏🙏
No thomas no partey
Auba not in training no thomas no smith😭😭😭
We can beat United this weekend COYG!
Odegaard Smith Rowe and Partey Don't need show United's Midfield the Levels, Mohammed Elgoat Will do it himself 💀😭
Ooh
COYG, let's try and get a good result against United tomorrow. Odegaard might not be ready to start, but hopefully he's at least ready to come off the bench. Hopefully Partey and Smith Rowe are fit too. Then we'll have a fighting chance of winning.
COYG
Did Odie walk in with MUSTAFI?  No mate, STAY AWAY.  Lest anything rub off.
Love Arsenal ,,

If you believe Odegaard will be a hit.. Hit the like button
So good that Ødegaard had his first full training session, but what’s even better is that Tierney, Partey, ESR all look fit for the game, let’s do this lads, a draw would be good COYG
Fighting, everyone loves and always cheers for Arsenal.
I see if we change Willock and Nikitah with players in the academy like Balogan and Aziz
I hope Ødegaard gets subbed on tomorrow. I can’t wait to watch him play for 6 months in an Arsenal shirt.  Edit: Thanks for 254 likes, I didn’t even except anyone to see this comment
