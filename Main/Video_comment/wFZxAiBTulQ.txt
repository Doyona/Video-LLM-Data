Dlo how tf he fall off so fast bra
What a game man... classic!!
One of my favorite recent Laker games. That half court shot at the end of regulation was actually crazy asf live
cant wait for playoffs again man... this time we're going for it ALL... 🏆🏆🏆
Good times man..
SVG’s voice sounds so raspy
Lakers block party between 2:21-2:48
If that clock had 1 second left after that blocked shot by ad and lbj making that way past halfcourt CRYPTO ARENA WOULD NEED A NEW ROOF
Will surely gonna miss schroder wearing lakers jersey 😢
I HOPE GRIZZLIES WILL WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP.
I LOVE THE NBA
Clutch buckets as well as OT buckets….Lebron James
3:36 this play should’ve been and one for Ja Morant! 😢
0:43 should have been a foul called on Vanderbilt! Bro hit Jaren Jackson straight up!! Refs trippin!! 😢
“you shake the tree, a leopard gon fall out” - kobe bryant
the final sequence where davis blocks the shot right to lebron and the heave goes in is wild and its also fun how they through the ball to brooks as the time expired in ot
I love LeBron James
Brooks just left the very millasecond  the game ended 😂😂😂😂😂
Ja got played by vandavel😂😂😂
Loved the clutch layup and 3-quarter shot by lebron, sad he lost to jokic in the WSF wish he would have won the championship
"James drives..." I had chills.
Lakers need to get rid off Schroeder. This guy is worst nba player.  Russ was 1000000 times better than this  new lakers players
LAKERS putting on a SHOW!!! https://youtu.be/xW8-qMjYmHY
9:43 bitch ass brooks running to locker room to gather his shit and duck the interviewers .. coward !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
James can play until he is 45.  🎉🎉🎉
That final bucket by James gives me chills. I love this sport.
This is the Lebron I like
nobody talking about that shot lebron hit at the end of the 4th😳😳 if only it wasn’t late
9:24 LeKing James
I was watching this in my university’s library and that day, I was sporting my Laker cap and ballers, and when Bane made that three to put them up 97-90 I was about to give up until D-Lo made 3 straight 3 pointers. LeBron later made that layup to force OT and I was so hyped that I couldn’t just stay quiet. Later I had to watch OT from my phone since break time was about to end. Saw LBJ nail that and-one on Brooks and everything was history, what a lovely day that was.
Lakers
Morant is carrying his team.
Ja: I'm finished in the West🤣🤣🤣
LEBRON THE GOAT
juicer
The Great Lebron James #6
Nice game
Wanna a wake up call and why people never get equality or color this that. Because every comment on here is about Lebron, nobody giving the Griz any clout whatsoever. And then y'all wake up tomorrow and cry supremacy.  If lebron has that, how you think kings, colors, rulers have it as well? I'm serious, jock riding comments all the way down, nothing bout poor ole Memphis TN grinding and fighting like geos not backing down for nobody. Congrats Griz, you the real
How are you guys gunna do a highlight reel and NOT recognize that the absolute juicer gaming warlord is sitting right there courtside?? Please do better to take care of our celebrities. xqcL
Why do the Lakers play the 6th seeded warriors next round . Shouldn't the lowest seed play the highest Denver  I swear the league doing everything in there power to get Lakers to finals
They’ve been putting Bane in his place all series 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
The Grizzlies are not the same team they were last year. They let these Laker/ Fakers load up pretty good on them.
So nobody is gonna talk about how Lebron casually shot that shot behind the Halfline 8:30
They cheat for those lakers
Xqc and the shrimp Posture 🍤
Ex Twolves shining in LA
Awesome game
LOOK ITS XQC
How much ja have
Is hitting somebody’s hand while they got the ball a foul?
Ham pinahirap mo mga prayer mo laging naghahabol gamitin  iba tanbakan
clearly a control game...99. 99 at 3min33. then the last shot after regulation . nothing but net...fake competition.
Brook do u call labron.wait.Labron can answer he is to big.or he is to old.brook went u go to bed.anwser that thing yo your self.😅
Will someone tell darvin hamhead to use more of the damn bench already
Lebron ain’t done yet..💪🏾
The Lake Show
Lakers got so lucky man .  With Stevo this number would be flipped. Maybe even sweep
I don’t like Lebron but the guy is playing like he’s in his prime.🔥💀
Lakers in 5
Get that shit out of here
go lakers
Bane looking drained
LeDontGetOld
That face when lebron got the and one at the end shows why he is Great the dude is greatness 38 years old still unstoppable 1v1
Ja Morant thinking he can jump over Lebron has me dying of laughter
Bro ad with that block i felt like ja would’ve made that good clutch by ad
Lakers 👉🏀
MEM, talking all that dynasty mess...haven't been past thebsecond round with a likely first round exist this year. LOL.
Dillon Brooks in regret rn 😭😭😭😭
The trashtalkers team😭😭😂😂
Lebron put that RAT in his place at the end of the game. Couldn’t even talk to the press after.
Great game by xQc tonight
LeBron is the Goat IDC
I don't think the Grizzlies are fine in the west like Temetrius Morant said.
Make Grizzlies getting bodied by Austin Reeves this series
Absolutely incredible Laker’s VS Grizzlies game!  Wow!!!  LeBron James is the “King of the Jungle!”! He truly “Got Game”!  There were so many “Fast Breaks”.  Even though there wasn’t enough “Hustle” from the offense, the Laker’s continued on just “Like Mike”.  When he threw that last possession ball from full court & made it, that was like a “Space Jam”.  LeBron is the “New Legacy”.  Too bad the buzzer caught him.  😥  When they went into overtime, we all knew the Lakers were on “The Way Back” to another win!  The shot LeBron made was almost “Above the Rim”.  That was a truly defining moment.  The team was well on a path to “The Glory Road”.  This game will definitely be in “Basketball Diaries” the world over!  There was “Love in Basketball “ last night!
LeBron is still that n*gga 👍🏽🏀💪🏾💯❤️🔥
Haven’t seen a nba game this good this actioned pack in a minute. Very little calls actual physicality and time for tries as well as errors and crazy shots just a great game to watch. Shivering
AD has been a defensive unit really is what helping the Lakers in this series and LeBron with the defense and D Lo is clutch
8:51 Did Jaren Jackson get SHOVED by a guy in the crowd ?????😲
Grizzlies talked all that trash after getting one win and and about to get dropped from the playoffs by the least talented team LeBron has had since his first play off run with Cleveland. maybe they will learn from this and shut the fuck up.
Ad stay hurt
I see yhe thing
Mane if they let the lakers in the final it’s over with
James a beast
Screw China James
Remember when Brooks said you "have to make LeBron go left"  Well, he did! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:25 to 7:28 lebron tried to end ja career
great game, very intense!
fuck ya what a good game. Lakers all the way.
Morant is such a female. I’ll point my Glock at his head see how he feels. Wannabe
Peso pluma @9:37
And that is why you don’t disrespect Lebron James. Dylan Brooks I am speaking directly to you when I say that, you moron. There’s maybe 3-5 players in NBA history who could rightfully call out Lebron. You are not, and never will be one of them.
Wow Great Game Guys. D'Angelo was on 🔥 and LeBron playing like this at his age is just remarkable. I am inspired, as usual by my favorite player GOAT James.❤️🏀⭐️
Grbe talaga the kings James.
Yes sir love it
👍
One of the best plays to end a quarter ever 😮😅 5:40
Love seeing the Lakers and Lebron put in such a strong run
I’m on the east coast and had to stay up till 1 in the morning for this game and honestly was gonna turn off the game if they went down like 12 in the 4th but as tired as I was I had to keep watching
AR15 IS THE NEXT FACE OF THE LAKERS 2025
Nice to hear Marty Funkhauser is back in the broadcast booth calling nba games!
I replay 9:25 like 100 times
😊❤
9:34 Lebron's stare down at AD was so intimidating that even AD had to blink and look away.  Alpha dog showing who's the boss.
Lit 🔥
4th Quarter 2:25 mins. Was the best moments between  JA and LE
Lebron is soo clutch that layup at the last minute was bitter sweet!
Lakers deserved to win that game!
The best NBA gameplay ever 2023
Go lebron 🎉
I want to see Tristian Thompson get into the rotation. He would be good for 2nd chance rebounds and size when Memphis has Tillman and Jackson on the floor
the Suns gonna take the west
Playoff atmosphere💯
That halfcourt shot by Lebron, damn it was like his sliders were on
Now what did we learn children?  "Don't poke the bear"
HI FELLOW JUICERS
I see xQc
One king James, one Lakers ❤🙏🇯🇲💯👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Stop playing with bron
What a game holy shit
https://youtube.com/shorts/ZQpIOC7tLHo?feature=share
Watch out for Dillon Honey Badger Brooks he likes to go straight for the balls just like a Honey Badger😂
Lakers in 5 😤😤😤
Dillion done poked the bear tonight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bron got the last laugh
Bane and brooks, having nightmare inside lakers paint.
Im just here to see xqc
One of the most exciting games in the playoffs so far! Excited to see this upcoming game 🔥
Brooke thinking he’s the main character by walking off like that hahah.
Go for win this 2023gogogo lajers team
8:30 WtF Lebron 😳 🐐
REJECTED BY ANTHONY DAVIS!!! 8:29
A young team must learn how to win and close out games. Only through experience you learn this.
defense 101, make your opponent go to his weak side. The Grizzlies obviously missed the first day of defense and let Lebron go twice in a row to his right with the game on the line, those are stupid mistakes.
Goat James
👋LAKERS HAVE TO CLOSE OUT WEDNESDAY FOR SURE NOW.
Lebron goat
LeGOAT 🐐
It really pissed me off that Ham didn't play Vando more - he was shooting very well and also hustling and blocking shots. Especially since AD and Rui were shooting poorly.
The end of the 4th!!!! 🔥 🔥 🔥 #weback #lakeshow
🐐🏆
I know hockey and basketball are two different sports, but the Kings should take notes from the Lakers by keeping up the pressure and avoid fouling if you want to preserve a lead. Oilers will probably destroy them still.
That boy Lebron a gorilla 🦍
Lebron is a scary man
I have nvr been this confident in lakers role players in awhile but when Reaves Rui or DLo shoots it’s goin in. Lakers are so deep
The BASKETBALL GODS WERE THERE TONIGHT🙏🏻
This game was crazy
I’m grateful that being a Laker fan I have been blessed to see one of the greatest if not the greatest to play the game be part of our team. Bron the Great. Legendary performance given his age and still making the difference.
People may call him Lebum or LeGm or whatever slang to disrespect this man. When it comes to the playoffs and clutch moments never count out LEBRON JAMES
That’s gotta be a travel the dunk by morant end of third quarter bro took more steps than Michael Jackson dancing
Love to see the grizzlies lose
All these Bron and Russell shoutouts. Don't forget my man Austin Reaves definitely contributed to this win. What's more, is the point spread for betting was Lakers -4.5. At 2 secs left in game, they were up by 4, so if u bet the spread for Lakers, u woulda lost. But they fouled Reaves with .3 left for no reason. He sunk 2 FTs to make final win by 6. Austin Reaves won everyone who bet the spread on Lakers this game. God bless this man!
strong
Brooks is got bullied by james
Love seeing the Grizzlies lose
Wow, what an intense game between the Grizzlies and Lakers! The highlights had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's amazing to see the talent and skill on display from both teams. I can't wait to see how the rest of the season unfolds. Go Grizzlies! 🐻🏀
i’m just here for xqc
Yo let's go Lakers get your head in the game no miss shots ,no turn overs and team work will get you guys that championship win 💪👏👏👏👍
xqcL
Was at this game. An absolute surreal & amazing experience the crowd was off the charts!
XqcL❤
The man definitely has a lot of haters but, when he retires even the haters will definitely miss Lebron James entertaining them on the court!
Im just glad Brooks walked away looking like the fool that he is. 😂
How many blocks did the lakers get? My goodness that was a good game.
LEGOAT
7 game series
Every grizzles fans this for you        Have fun in Cancun bitches 😂😂😂
All i got to say is ja morant is very impulsive in his decision making like when he drives to the rim his forcing his shots forcing contacts he becames predictable and suceptible to charge like westbrook. Often of his layup  are like a scary prone to career ending injuries he must develop a floater game to make use of his bounciness. Adams apparently affects morant ability to drive because none of memphis center now could set a good screen that leaves him wide room to lay it in. I think its fair to say that lakers are lucky because Memphis lacks adams
Does Dillon Brooks respect LBJ after being scored on in that last bucket?
I see him xqcL
#4trending that's pretty crazy for a 1st round series
Anybody who says *LeBron* isn't the greatest to do it is just indenial and needs to be checked in somewhere for help."
I was there and these highlights don’t do Justice to how loud it was at Crypto
desmond bane 🔥
3-1 doesn’t mean the series is over, my guys need one more.
☝️👍👍👍👍👍
Super!
You are a true juicer if you focus on xQc instead of the game
gotta love lebron when he plays defense and is hustling like this game.
Ja Morant is really special.
Because none of you guys in any comment would say it. Ja Morant is amazingly amazing…. They really don’t have their best bigs in Steven Adams or Clarke and are play at an extremely high level. Ja Morant is an extra special gifted individual. For two playoffs in two years they don’t have Steven Adams. Wow!
HELLO XQC MY JUICER
Grizzlies' a joke, struggling on the first round. Dynasty what? 😂
Ngl that Lebron shot at 8:30 made my eye brows touch my neck back ....On my Birthday too just seeing this now I missed it getting too litty 🎉🥳
Lebron old?  Sure he is.
The way the lakers is trying to kill Ja morant during these plays with no calls from the refs I don’t respect it so I don’t respect the win. Trying to purposely injured Ja morant.
xQcL
I bet he keep his trap shut from now on🤣🤣🤣🤣
If ja keeps doing what he's doing he will end up like westbrook
my juicer
He wanted James he gets em...What a call on the Dillon Brooks-Lebron play 😂
For the high pride grizzlies as matt monro / frank sinatra r sang "AND NOW THE END IS NEAR" the music played
Byebye brooks 😅
Lebron is like a 🐂 bull
3 CORNER SHOT AWESOME EVEN THOUGH ITS OUT OF TIME ♥
The Lakers now have the grizzlies cornered and in major hole, what a game! hope we can finish them off on Wednesday.
Man it felt like the lakers had a million blocks this game

A.d and Beasley #TRASH😅
Once again LeBron gets the superstar foul at the end of the game, somehow Ja needs to do more passing than shooting, he's great and all, but if any chance of comeback they gotta play hard for 2 games
Lol Morant and Brooks refused to talk to the media after this game. Pussies
Did you catch the latest Grizzlies vs. Lakers game highlights? It was an intense matchup between the #2 and #7 teams, with both sides giving it their all.

Bron got that dawg in him
Block city!! Team defense #Lakers  What a game!! Got to love NBA playoffs
Ja said that the west is already been taken cared of and that they have no problems with any of the team. Right now on the brink of elimination, where are the barkers? Too bad, Grizzlies' ego when off to the stratosphere.
My juicer
Great gameplay by both teams! Lakers did not come to play!
Still setting personal record at 38, what an athlete.
NBA fans there's hope here's the answer. God so loved the world He gave His son Jesus that whoever believes will have everlasting life. John 3:16 Jesus died for you believe & repent.
D Angelo =X-factor
Now this is a playoffs. Edge of my sit the entire time. Go Lakers.
Lebron still doing this at 38 is nothing short of remarkable! Great game!
XQC!!!
Damn ima miss James when he retire / 20 years later 😂
A Hell of a Good Game! Bane was feeling it. Congratulations Lakers!
The no no finger!
Ja Morant is 100% gonna have a short career if he don't learn. There's fearless then there's reckless.
Yea sir
Dillon couldn't stop that old man? 😂 Better get in the weight room.
🐐
Dilllon Brooks is a clown of clowns. He had 5 rebounds vs „old” Lebron’s 20 😂
xQc!
That's my idol LeBron James The GOAT 🐐👑💪🏽
D-Lo needs to feel good moving forward. He has to play his own game and forget everything. Think about what he can do when he find his true game with the Lakers.
A repost of something I read - THE STATS. Lebron James leads both Jordan and Kobe Bryant in games, minutes, playoff games, wins, points, assists, steals, rebounds, blocks, FG attempted and made, FG percentage, three pointers attempted and made, free throws attempted and made, post-season points, clutch points in a season, selections as All NBA, selections as first team All NBA. Most Player Of the Week awards, two to one over the next guy. Even today he has the highest points-per-game average for the Heat, and the Cavaliers, and the Lakers – higher than Magic, Wilt, Kareem.   THE SKILLS. Lebron plays all 5 positions and defends all 5, and adds new tools every year. Lebron has no single signature move that defenders can focus on stopping: he attacks from everywhere on the court. Lebron has about twice as many assists as MJ because he’s the best passer. And Lebron gets absolutely no help from the refs. At 38 he was putting up more points and rebounds than he did in his MVP season ten years earlier.  MJ got protection from the refs his entire career for his charging, pushing off, travelling, palming. Joe Dumars says that Jordan opened the door for a whole generation of players travelling to the basket. Really, travelling was Jordan’s entire strategy. But Jordan still complained about the officiating and his opponents – oh how I hate Isaiah and Laimbeer! They’re so mean! It was Jordan, not Lebron, who complained to the NBA commissioner about people fouling him, despite all the free passes he was getting from the refs. When Jordan wasn’t whining to the refs, he was whining to the media that the mean old Pistons wanted to hurt him. Even though MJ’s whole gig was going to the rim, MJ actually had a lower FG percentage than Lebron. MJ tried to move from guard to forward and looked like a wounded moose. And he never had to face a zone defense either.  And remember that Jordan was feasting on weak expansion teams in Charlotte, Miami, Orlando and Toronto, and then veering west to play Minnesota and Vancouver.  People forget the regularity with which Isaiah Thomas and Larry Bird spanked Jordan whenever he met them.  Jordan does have one major NBA record: he leads in number of personal fouls in a quarter.
The Lakers are not going to win the championship and Labron James doesn't have anything else to prove he has a family at home  time for him to retire it's a shame go home😮
number 17 at 7:25 definitely collided with ja to knock him out of sprint before lebron got t-bagged
5:22 that's illegal box out by lebron. using elbows n shit
"He's old." Famous Last words from Dillon Bricks 😂😂😂
Memphis 😂 All that talk.
ITS A PARADE INSIDE LA YEHHHHH
Dillon  didn't  feel  king's balls  this  time 🙄 😂
lebron owns the grizzlies
Who's old, huh?!
Brooks at church. So quiet.
this felt like the old days 🥲
LeGoat
LbJ AD AR dlo vandebilt schroder hatchimura lets go and all team of L.A.
Wr're going to hear grizzlies in 7 in Memphis as well as the song that steph and klay were laughing at last year. Forgot what it was called
Brooks: I am young and I win. LBJ: I am old and I still WIN!
What a game?  Lebron went insane! Nice to see them cocky Grizzlies lose.
jee
How can u beat those two Hulk shooters man?!
Nail it down. Go LAKERS
Adam Sandler high as hell 8:24 😂
YES ❤
boobs in the buss they pump
xqcL
I gonna praise Davis for his savior block
Thats my juicer
Let’s go all the way Lakers!
Let me see if I can guess. Guy dribbles down court, shoots ball at hoop, ball goes in. Next guy dribbles back the other way and he shoots ball, misses. Wow, so exciting.
Everyone counted my squad out before the year started. Ppl said we weren’t making the playoffs. Stay on that side. & just enjoy the LAKESHOW take over the rest of the year for another championship run. It’s coming. This year will make up from the COVID pandemic .
This game was phenomenal excellent basketball by the Lakers 🔥🔥
XQC
After watching the previous games for Lakers vs. Grizzlies, this one really got me for Game 4, and the Final OT win, as a wild ending.  Congratulations to Team LA Lakers 🏀🟡🟣
Go Lakers 4 1
2:45 HOW TF is that not a foul
Lebron is blowing my mind with his effort, it deosnt make sense at his age but dude is a monster even now.
Who is old now 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Goosebumps is the only way i can describe my experience.
clippers getting eliminated, lakers advancing......
This mane Morant is a Dawg!!!
Call me crazy but Ima see my guys in June watch this age..
Imagine being on that court in Grizzlies Jersey and witnessing this 9:30 😵‍💫 dagger forsure
Fuck them Lakers and lebron.
d angelo russell 🔥
Memphis still fine in the West 😂
9:20 watched 24 times🥃🕶🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruh dis lakers team is scary wit dat D fr true team effort no cap lol stay safe RIP Hagrid Takeoff Pele pray for our world BLM God bless checkout the band The Main Squeeze 🙏
"Old" LeBron just made you put your tails between your legs and now you suddenly realize you poked the wrong bear. Then you think .. Bron is retired maybe we have a chance!.. and then comes Bronny. Give Dillon Brooks a nice long hug and better luck next time.. Call me a Lebron Stan all you want. At 38 years old he made you realize you aren't as hard as you thought you were. I love Ja's game and he is electrifying and will be an all time great. Just maybe stop talking shit to the GOAT. Be a little more humble. Yall wanted LeBron, and you got him. Grizzlies most delusional annoying collective of people i have ever seen.
Ja out there playing Leap Frog instead of basketball man...stop jumping over people!
With 20boards
wheres that shit talkin dylan brooks at when the games on the line? Brooks guarding reeves in OT then gives up a bucket and one to bron to ice!!!!!!! Dylan Brooks go back to waxing cars at the car wash homie your game is trash and youre a bitch!! His game revolves around talking shit and being a tramp stamp. Bron owns you homie! Its Showtime baby!
Why does the announcer sound like Bob Epstein from Curb 😂
Great game
Morant is such a rookie in front of LBJ.
so sad how the nba has allowed certain players the freedom to control the game with fouls.  lets have a fair game
Morant crying for And 1's. What a clown. Take the bucket and get back on D son....
Brooks outplayed by the old guy again!
Lebron and Ad look🥶
Brooks made a big mistake by calling Lebron old when he should've called him an old goat so next time put some respect on goat James  name
This was a block party! 🥳 🎉 🪅 🎊
Ja should go get his dick sucked somewhere.
8:32 lol xqc
Lebron the Ronaldo of basketball
Hard but exciting game
Well kudos to JA MORANT
ITS A PARADE IN HIS CITY
Yabang ni kingkong. Kung wala si dangelo olats ka guk
Wtf nigga! Lebron is the fucking goat!  Bro called out homie at the end and still got doubled at the rim to finish. Basically Memphis is done!   Ja need needa trade that creole hating mf lol
Damn what an awesome game!! The NBA seems alive with Lakers like this!!
Love watching J. Morant play but I always find myself cringing and hoping he does not sustain an injury.
Grizzlies got their cheeks clapped. 👏 👏 👏
Uu j o
Y'all should be able to become  the New Number 2  after This
That was an awesome game. Russel brought the heat check. And, hate on LeBron all you want, he is still the King.
I love how Ms Faye is the new "Ann Landers" of YouTube 😊, thanks for sharing your wisdom!!!
Wow
This game reminds me of those days when Lebron was dominating the east and laying the beat down on my raptors that were at the time led by DeMar and Lowry.
They  make it look like  the close out games  be the hardest...  But  it's the same old job...  Put the work in  from start to finish...   make it simple
Can’t help but cheer for bron especially that last take on brooks 😂😂
Now thats a ball game
Lebron with a flop at 7:27
Usually a team that has won a championship gets  this much hate but they haven't won anything
This is what Memphis gets for being cocky B@stards
Ja, you ain’t looking too fine in the West right now
That was incredible
yea im gonna get married with luis manuel
AD is so messed up it hurts to watch, Lakers are really going to need him to get better if they have any shot at beating the Celtics
Rule number one never talk ish to the king
f
8:23 my man Adam looking baked.😅😅
Stop putting letrash face on thumbnail bruh, Austin reaves gotta be on thumbnail now, letrash is garbage now
Lakers go win da championship..
the lakers defense gave me a boner
I’m fine in the WEST. LOL. 😂😂😂
Dillon Brooks, averaging 6-7pts, 4-5fouls, 1-2 groin slap, 26 claps, and 27 "YESSIR" per game.  What a stat, from a self-proclaimed, and a young youth contender against the GOAT.  😂😂😂
Witness the greatness ❤
Witness the greatness ❤
Looya sa mga borit ui😭😭😭
Dat old man jus done Dillion up real nice
Can you imagine if that shot by LeBron at the end of regulation counted?
What a fuckin game
Good job lakers, eliminate grizzlies!!!
Memphis Grizzlies 😆😅😂🤣
Lebron still going hard 💪
A healthy lakers team is dangerous
playoffs great this year
It was a great game❤
I’m a warriors fan and yet I’m cheering on Lebron and the Lakers Huge this season, especially with the Dillion Brooks beef many teams have had, ever since he slammed CP2 in the head and he broke his elbow, I’m enjoying the heck outta this, plus Lebron is killing it at 38, gotta give props where deserved. Would be crazy to see Golden State play against the Lakers haha
These playoffs have been lit
Let’s go Lakers
LAKERS IN 5 RIPBOZO GRIZZPACK HITTIN ALL DAY BROOKS BETTER LEARN CHINESE QUICK NI HAO
Do I got to say it? Ok I'll say it  this was the perfect ending . Let me take you for a ride Young Buck!,😂✅💨✌️🔥 PS . WALK AWAY! 😭
"He's old"  Lebron: and I took that personally....   The look he gave after, mj and kobe approve
LeBron James.🐐👑
Peso pluma
Im a Fan of Bron more than the league but i care about the laegue a little. and because of that little bit of care i have lmao i need Ja to lock in on floaters/middies. crafty layups lol please dont make the same mistake as westbrook relying on being the best ath on the court in your 20s lol
Wish i stayed up to watch this game i had work at 5am and im on the east coast 😢
No matter what!!am happy am seeing this .
I was at this game and it was to dam good everyone was having a good time crowd was on point game was on point if ur a lakers fan I’m telling u buy that ticket nd get there !
Lakers are battle tested!! I think this Grizzlies team, is the best they’ve ever had!!
Lebron Fuckin James man. Cleveland misses you. (Fellow clevelander)
How are the grizzlies down 3-1 to lakers who they beat a couple seasons ago … they really devolved
DeLo!!! DeLo!!! DeLo!!!
I don’t why ja was shooting at the 3 , RUN TO BASKET RUN TO BASKET WORK THE INSIDE FUCK EM UP thats his specialty
DLOOOOOOO
If I said that LeBron James has a nice manicure, somebody would surely chime in and say, "Don't kid yourself ..... it's the EPO/steroids that allows him to have those finely-tuned nails."
Let’s go Bron let’s get you one more
Hell yeah LaL baby 💪🏾💪🏾💯💯💯
Please sit AD and Schroeder for game 5.  They will be fresh for game 6 if necessary.  Start Mo Bamba and play Walker & Harrison!!!
When this happened 8:28 I knew we were going to Win
Warriors will feast on either team
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
What a lucky shot by LeBron! The Fakers didn't deserve to win that game!!!
The Gospel:  (I am not a bot, I'm just someone who enjoys spreading the gospel. Much love to you all!)  The gospel is the good news that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins and rose again, eternally triumphant over His enemies, so that there is now no condemnation for those who believe, but only everlasting joy.  Peter says in 1 Peter 2:24, “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  So Christ died not only to forgive sin, but also that it might die in the lives of His people.  ~Quoting John Piper~  ALSO My friend put together a great PowerPoint about the Gospel and Jesus being the prophesied Messiah.

Oh, yeah!
LakeShow family never ceases to amaze me when it comes to giving the support to our laker team. The energy in the arena is always 110%. Love the laker fam and im glad to be apart of it. ❤
A +20 point and +20 rebounds in a playoff game at age 38. All hail the King! He's a specimen!
Ja Morant is full of niggativity. And, he got cooked
Nice game 😊
Pura doble p
I swear that this Lakers team is so deep that they have a different hero every night.  Any one of them can turn it on all of sudden and save the game.
LeBron at 38 looking 30 😅🔥🔥🔥
7:27 bro was on something
That 🦁 roar from the 👑 😤😤💪🏽💪🏽  LFG LakeShow !!!
Block party 😮🎉
What a great game.Lakers all the way respect to this lakers team👍🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.I love the energy
That block was nasty
iM FiNe iN tHe WeSt 🤡🤡
LeGREATNESS!!!!
Grizzles suck
Dlo is like that
Great job Lakers
Upset😢
Brooks prides himself on his defense? 😂 But the team out someone else on Lebron at the end of the 4th! 😂 But he didn't drop 40 though? 😂 Can't believe he said that.
Get ready to learn Chinese Dillon Brooks
man if there was one more second on lebrons full court shot that woulda been the most legendary game winner in playoffs history
I'm proud as a Lakers Nation Fan💜💛💜💛💯
xqc in the front i can see the pants and hair!!!
That last sec shot to tie for overtime was some 6th man shit man #blackmamba👆🏽
AD was not going to pass up the opportunity to block Dillon Brooks
Okay why is this trending more than the Heat game?!?!
GGs
DLO 🥶🥶🥶
I got like 20 ads during this 9 minute video. I think it might be bugged or sum lmao
Lebron been clutch for a long time 🐐
Game ain't a game no more. It's a battle
Go lakers! I know we got this
nba getting they money. hell i done got 5 ads my first 5 minutes in
Dumbest GM move Lakers made was getting rid of D-Lo in the first place. Kid seems to come up big in big moments.
Whether it's Shooting, Blocks, Steals, Fast Breaks, Getting Fouled, or Passes, Austin Reaves is the master of the "Angle". He is exactly where he should be to carry out any effective move.
This team loves playing with one another.... You people are witnessing something special.. I have not seen a Laker team that loves one another the way this team does besides the Showtime Lakers
Grizzlies running out of tricks to whoop.
Stg Desmond Bane was giving me heart attacks all game😭💯
Congrats to the lakers, but I saw the whole game and the officiating was the main factor for the game in favor of LA.
"I'm fine in the west"
0:05 I see xqc on the top right
I hope the lakers sweep them they talk to much
Adam Sandler over there really trying to be seen. Man these “celebrities” need validation 24/7.  Adam: “look at me, look at me! Can you see me with this highlighter hoody, I am a celebrity”
XqcL
Man that dunk Ja had at the end of the 3 quarter was crazy imagine if this game was a home game for them and he did that place would go nuts
Games like this is why Lebron still plays..
James, super clutch
ja just lowers the shoulder and steamrolls a legal defender in the post. no whistle. ridiculous.
xqcL juicers
Who else noticed the guy in the black hoodie😂😂.Funny asf
The Grizzlies ain't shitt let's go Lakers
Well... after cycling through like 100 combinations of players, overhauling every single squad since 2018, LeBron May finally have something with this crew
This is real playoff basketball!! Great game!!💪🏽🏀
Bron kant go left doe
"i'm fine in the west"  proceeds to fall 3-1 down to a 7th seed
Respect to bane🔥🔥. That dude can hoop!
Look at X lookin like a goblin
I’ll give it to James, the guy is the best blocker I have ever seen, far none.
Labron is so clearly the goat it ain’t even close…. Sorry MJ
Bro y’all gotta stop doing that needle injection after a 3 pointer. Not only is that super cringe, but y’all look like a bunch of drug addicts.
WOOOO!! YEAHHH! We had a few critical stupid turnovers at the end but we held it together
Asta la vista Memphis. Y’all are cursed or something. Y’all can’t even beat a 7th seed.
Refs swallowed their whistle at the end of regulation.
Fantastic game. Lebron didn't look old. He looked like the King.
It should have been over the back at the end on Morant and should have been free throws...game over. Still good game
LeBron was still moving on the offensive charge call
Even though that full court shot didn't count it turned up the crowd going into OT 😂
No but the way my heart was beating watching this😭😭😭
Is that xqc on the bench watching lmao
Damn lets give some credit to DeLo 🎉 he keeps lakers hopes high with that 3 consecutive shots
I love how LeBron is doing all this shit and the only thing people who dislike him can use now is "He'S oN RoIDs". Fuck outta here if he's doing them the whole fucking league is and if thats the case it dosen't matter.
So done with the refs. NBA is rigged for sure.
THATS HOW U DO THAT SHIT BOYS‼️‼️‼️‼️🐐🐐🐐Bron is 4ever great
"I'm fine in the West" 😂
Who said lebron wasn’t clutch and I’m a Kobe fan
Dylan Dynasty Brooks
And 1!!!!!!! Let’s goooo lebrón 😂
Ohh my gosh, what a game! Way to get the job done LAKERS! 1 more win and the griz are goners. 🇺🇸 😊
Dem dukes ,dem dukes😆😆🔥🔥
Ja Marant is still a rookie these games prove it the grizzles are nothing but hype
Pangit mo kala mo binuhat un laro makaarte
Lebrons a beast man this guy is from another planet 💪
haven't WATCH a LAker game like that since KOBE R.I.P . lets GOOO LA ALL DAY..
If that 3 point shot had been one second earlier I would have lost my mind! Lebron is a living legend
At 9:31 Bron on beast mode 💪
Peso Pluma 9:36
DLO WITH THE 3 3'S!!! CLUTCH
One of the best #7 seeds I've ever "witnessed"
In " My Opinion " GOAT " Overall Basketball Player " is Kareem Abdul Jabbar  The GOAT NBA Basketball Player is LeBron James.
Whole game felt lethargic.. that stupid play by Ja 7:30 .. should of passed it to an open man .. he decided to take it in on the king .. bad decision
morant thought that wasnt a charge 😂
First of all Dillon brooks is wannabe Draymond green,bane gets lucky on those shots bastard he sucks ass, ja Morant too gets lucky & thinks he's all that cause he owns a gun nigger please...r.t.
LECLUTCH
dlo idk wtf that beard is but its working
AD block on morant at the end of regulation was tuff 😤😤😤👌🏾
Gotta love the Playoffs. Goosebumps!
“Old” but you still can’t stop him from driving to the hole and for clutch buckets on top of that
Business is booming
Forget about the regular season Lakers defense is 🏀💪🔥🔥🔥🔥
They need to bench Dillon brooks. Shit talker, dirty player, overall negative on the court
Morant blocked by Davis! 🎉  Great game
Maybe ja should start to get worried about the west
JaMeS ThE GoAt🔥🏀
Hey, Brooks. LeBron had twice as many points than you. Not bad for an old man.
That boy Dillion went off in this game😂
7:27 all I see watching this series
1st of all, I just wanna say Let’s go Lakers! Second of all, let’s go Lakers!!
Ja still fine in the west?
Get ‘em out!
Delonte West was one proud Stepfather tonight. 😂
How tf do a 38 year old grab 20 rebounds against niggas who decades younger than him?
These playoffs have been crazy. No super team and no clear winner thus far.
Wow! What an exciting yet stressful game. The fans in attendance surely got their money's worth. Let's go Lakers!
The game didn't start until OT. Can't believe this is the current state of basketball.
9:30! His face though!!!😂😂😂
grizzlies r in fact, not fine in the west
From 2-10, to the Westbrook fiasco, to the under the radar trades , to making the play in and winning, to up 3-1. This team has to be exhausted mentally and yet......... WE UP 3-1. GO LAKE-SHOW with all that. We have a legitimate shot. Battle tested, grit, grinding. No, not the Grizzlies, The Lakers!
Good
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised.
0:47 oh hell nah he made ja look like a fool
Reaves is a straight bucket
Morant is the best player out there. sensational!!!!!!
@ 7:25 Bane literally looks back and hits Austin in the throat/neck area for no reason (at the top of the screen). That is ridiculous. The NBA should do something about that.
All praise to DLo for giving the team a chance to stay in the game. We don’t win without those HUGE 3s
LAKERS IN 5 XQCL LAKERS IN 5 XQCL LAKERS IN 5 XQCL
That doesn't look like a foul at all at the end with Bron's layup.. Sick game though 🔥
Good game Lakers keep going
No matter if James is the 8th seed or play in.. he gonna show why he is the king
The way Messi won the World Cup, Lebron is not my favorite but he a legend I want him to win the championship he deserves it
DLo Russell won the game for the Lakers
We fine in the west
Excellent effort by both teams!!!
my juicer xqcL ❤❤
Those Memphis Grizzlies have quite the Dynasty eh?
Just a note to say I hate the NBA promoting obesity foods to kids and putting the product names in courts. Vile.
thhe lakers are ruined  they are barely a team just a bunch of random players
Grizzlies #2 in the west. Lakers might 4-1 them. I really think the Lakers aren't consistent enough, but could they be a contender? :\
Even if lakers don’t make it to the western finals, rob pelinka did an amazing job with giving them another lifeline and deserves a lot of credit. I honestly think lakers have a chance as long as they work on their consistency in the fourth quarter. Nuggets will eat them alive if they get too complacent in crucial moments.
KNEELERS
Ha...MFs still call him LeChoke. Dude is still clutch at 38.
this and the heat/bucks game were insane
someon pls make a complition of DB pushing people
Dilon Brooks is not him😂😂😂😂😂
Where are the Memphis Grizzles, all I see is cocaine bear the day after.
2:46 NAAH BRUH REFS TRASH DB PUSHED LEBRON
those 3 threes from DLO saved the Lakers this game.
Nice travel by Reeves at the end lol
BROOKS GOT WHAT HE WANTED! ALL THE SMOKE!💨
9:20 this what you wanted right Brooks? & Yo ass folded, talked all that shit but where is his defense now?🤣🤣
👑 King James! 👑
lebronn had nothing to do with that win lol straught up
This TEAM is coming together before our eyes. Led by LeBron 👑 AD, Austin, DLo, Rui, Vando and Dennis. If Malik and Troy can start knocking down 3s with the way this TEAM can defend....man Larry O'Brian, you might as well get ready to come on home.
3:10 Dlo put ya fuckin hand down, remind me on that one nerd in school who never puts his hand down cause he know every answer wit his nerd ass 🤣
Now that was a game, wit the way the Lakers & Grizzlies play defense, you would swear they in a ghetto ass hood cause every time it's a block party 🤣
One hell of a game. Thank you to both teams for laying it all out there.   That doggone LeBron sure has some fancy tricks to fearlessly flaunt and fool the other fellows. Some of my friends noticed how he was flinging his arms around and laughing like a crazy man. That was very silly of him. Some of the fans in the front row were amazed. Nothing personal, but none of those fans who were amazed are my friend. We've never even met. I don't live in L.A., but I sure do like fancy tricks. Always have.    Heavens to Betsy!
AD save this game making that block in last moment of 4th 🎉
You just know it's a Lakers game by the amount of cardiac arrest you'll get to experience
Let's go Lakers
We need to give David Stern a credit to adjusting the league and make team more balanced, the era of playoff mismatches and sweeps are now uncommon.
OK Laker fans... I am a fair man. I have spent the last year laughing at your tears... and now I will let you see mine. 😢😢😢This sucks. Your success hurts my soul.   I'll see you when you hit the wall.
The ice mamba!🥶🐍
peso pluma in the back 9:35
Why is this recorded in 720p only?
Ja's suicidal attacks will catch up to him someday. He needs to be careful
Such horse shit.
The fact that Taylor Jenkins, the Grizzlies head coach, is only 3 months older than LBJ just blows my mind
People actually still watch this woke trash??
22 points 20 rebounds. Dillon got his 40. Now stfu.
I get POKED by bears 🐻 DB......😅
Ja morant really needs to stop flying to the rim like that before he kills his self his hand fucked up and he still doing the shit 😂
Lebron's feet were not planted and he fouled Morant and that foul was to endanger the Ja kid. Like end his life type shit. That's Lebrone. Kill his own black brother. Check the music he's listening to, bet 100 that it's kill black music.
These refs are earning how much?
Vanderbilt set the tone early, this guy was SUCH a steal and they got all those other guys as well. Thanks Timberwolves 😂😂😂
LeBron was already obviously an NBA great. Last night he cemented himself as an all time Lakers great as well. Hell of a game LeBron! Go get ring #5 champ!
I just wanted Lebron to start poking people after that last shot
When I tell you that this game had me so stressed. I feel better watching the highlights because watching it in real time was too much
U lose young punks d doodoo brooks and studio g ja
Honestly Lakers had all the momentum after all the 3s D Lo hit in the 4th but it slowly went away once he got fouled out. Luckily Lebron turned the fuck up at the end! Lakers in 5
Dillon brooks a pussy @ me
Wao 😂😂😂😂😂
xqcL
Say what you about his off court antics lol    that kid Ja Morant is Fearless 💯
its already rigged in the west for the Lakers to win
Reptar gonna have to drop another 36 points to stay in this series.
That’s why he’s the goat -edp voice-
Great game moving forward I really think Darvin ham Should consider Lonnie walker stepping in because we are practically getting zero contribution from Malik Beasley
Lebronathon brought it to OT but it was D Lo's 3 straight triples that did the deal.
Let's go Lakers, and Brooks can't hold James even at 38.
I know every Lakers fan's heart had to pause for a sec when AD when to block Ja's shot at the end of regulation.
Jkrew Better than you
5:30 - Lebron was like "dang"
“He is not clutch” yea okay
🐐🐐🐐 💯 Lakers in 5
9:34 The testosterone in that chest bump could kill.
LeBron, thank you for your service king.
this nigga ja stay tryna dunk on bron like nigga sit tf down
A winner always finds a way to win!
Grizzlies 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a game
That Jordan Lebron debate ain’t looking like a debate anymore
Dang nice job lake show.   DLo hitting those 3’s (3in a row) was a low key huge deal.     Of course in the moment in that game is was a huge swing, but just two games ago he was saying he wasn’t sure what his role was on the team anymore..   the fact that he can put up a good number, and the team played a great game… that’s good for the lakers all the way around.  Bron doing his thing of course, Reeves showing out, AD staying healthy, and Rui playing big boy ball. The Lakers look good. Offensively and defensively
Lebron exerted himself  Russel as well They will lose the next game to recover. But win in 6
I’ve never been a Lebron fan. But him bullying Dillon Bricks for the win was utmost satisfying.
Best part was Dillon brooks first one out the door
Davis’ block on Ja was too much lol
part 2 https://youtube.com/shorts/RAMwQrrhoug?feature=share
Got humbled in the west. Hahahaha! Let's go Lakers!
W
Good job lakers team
Who’s the cute femboy court side?
F Dillion Brooks. I hope he gets sent home and traded to the hornets or pacers
This lakers defense is the reason they will be champs again
That’s why never let you mouth get ahead of you…. The results will speak your greatness…. Or your failure.
magnetic ball for james in the last minutes
All that talkin lmao
Dude Austin Reaves is truly inspiring fr
Dlo is better than lebron james... lebron had a lucky game
I was hoping JA would of DUNKED on the king but this was a great ass game
Meeeeee🤣🤣🐐
If Brooks is my teammate i’m jumping him in the locker room. He did this 😂
Brooks shoulda stfu 😭😭😭 now look what he made the BEAR 🐻 do
LBJ sent that boy Brooks walking off with his head down 😂😂  #trashtalk #trashball
Aside from the Warriors and Kings, this match up is superb. I love this game of basketball. #Lakers baby!
If Russ didn’t set up in the 4th lakers lose that game
Who else had lakers -4.5? Sickest cover of my life. Lebron is 👑
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  I prayed to the Lord Jesus and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and get baptized under water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and obey what Jesus wants you to do with your life or if you don’t then when you die you will go to hell.  Jesus loves you dearly and He never gave up on you so please don’t give up on the Lord Jesus.
This is the team that started 0-5 and was slandered the whole season for not being able to make the playoffs. Now look at them
That's my juicer
LAKESHOWWWWW🔥🔥
First half of the lakers was in a block PARTY!! ✋🔥🔥🔥🤣
Just wondering if Morant is still fine in the west
Bron: Someone said I am old?!😂😂😂
Craziest part of all is the contribution Reeves is making night after night in full temp playoff basketball. LeBron running the show and the bench showing real character when AD can't get it done on the offensive end.
Shoutout to Dillon Brooks and Ja Morant! I hope y'all two and the rest of the Grizzlies have fun being at home after this series is over! Brooks really said he was helping build a fucking dynasty! LOL and SMH! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭💀💀💀
Not easy to go from the bottom of the bracket to the top...
Thug life, zero class blm nonsense. No thanks.
@ 7:30 ja morants dad first one out his seat to make sure his son is okay. Love that.
Morant going for the highlight dunk through lebron instead of utilizing the wide open teammate in a 2 v 1 situation in a tied playoff game with 2 and a half minutes left, not only stupid dangerous but stupid dumb. @7:24
"HEY!!!! CMON MAAAAN, ITS TOO EASY!!!!" @9:24
Anyone else remember when Ja said "We good in the west" 😂😂 Lmfao he eating those words now
I’m a sixers fan but playoff Lakers are hittin different this year
This game was off the charts. The skills being shown by both teams players was incredible. What's that saying,When you come for the king you better not miss? Enjoy the greatness that is Lebron James. There'll never be another player like him.
Uruididdudyudkduktukdydydiduiudkydidyudduydfitufyfuffufufifftufifyfkdkdyiddydhjudyyfcucyf
This team looks alot better than those defending Champion Warriors!
LETS GO LAKERS!!!!!!!!
This is why I continue to watch Lakers games because of heart pounding endings, win or lose, whether against best teams or underdog, it's always a thriller!
As a Lakers fan, I want to give thanks to Dillon Brooks!! Keep that same energy up.
I want a Lebron vs KD in the West finals
i was a LeBron hater,but maann this guy is a beast! he still performs like an 18 year old LeBron, one of the greatest ever!
such a good game
Wow the lakers might be back didn’t see this coming
Still fine in west I see. 👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻
Now let Lonnie get some time and ima stop relying on AD frfr smh glad they got the win but next round play gotta be better
Brons last bucket on brooks was extremely satisfying to watch after what brooks said about him😂
From 8:09, I'm so happy it was a very satisfying clutch playoffs performance/lakeshow.
what a game
Grizzlies are to little
Schroder almost lost them the game, played with no sense of urgency threw the ball away 3 times in the 4th and OT
Ja "blocked by Davis" Morant.
AR and Russ won that game for them.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💪💪💪🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆👑👑👑👑👑
Omg what is the power of LeBron and Anthony Davis blocks
Poking bears have consequences.
"I'm fine in the west"
definitely the second best game of the playoffs this year
replayed this for the 7th time❤ Can't stop believing😊
asawa q sige na mahal talaga kta asawa q hindi Oo na talaga🎉 maniwala walangmangyari sab 4:12 wala lord ito nk ti hindi sige bantay ok lang
Memphis is the most exciting team in the NBA rn because they got the whole world somehow rooting for the lakers.
Le’Buckets
Wow, what a game! That was some 90s defense right there
What a great series for the Lake show this far. Lets go!!!!
Similarly to the heat, all the Lakers needed was to get to the playoffs, 2 dangerous teams.
morant travels 3 times in one touch and they dont call it
hndi ako galit 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
let's see,i promise LA gonna win this series
The Lakers end this series in 5
They weren’t ready for the Lake Show baby!!!!
alam mo kahit hindi kona antyin ang sinasabi ok lang sakin
9-42 from three land, that’s so bad
They need to make sure they call defense foul next time cuz bron moved his feet on that foul with Morant y’all gave the lakers that game 😂😂😂
9:30 When the spirit of Kobe entered Bron. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let's go Lakers!
*Who that said this era doesn't play defense? omg*
I had money on this game , at 5:14 seconds of the 4th quarter is the exact moment I started sweating 😂
run that three 6ix mafia
Don't poke the bear, I guess. 🤷‍♂️😂
Why did Ja even thing he would get that call. Lebron gets that call all day everyday. 😂
#7 seed showing out, Kobe would be proud
WILD GAME!!! LEZ GO PLAYOFFS 🔥🔥🔥
If that end of regulation shot would’ve counted, that would’ve been the greatest shot in playoff history
Lebron is the goat…
Russell put them on his back in the end of the 4th
Ja was one step away from the free throw line and Lebron was one foul away from being in the most iconic nba poster ever.
Giving bron back shots rn
One of the most exciting games in the playoffs so far! Excited to see this upcoming game  right
DLO been cold last couple of games but when it mattered most he sunk those three 3's!
Ja Morant: “I’m fine In the west” 🤡
The Grizzlies really blew one here. Yes they are down 3-1 but 2 of the next 3 games are in Memphis, so if they can force a game 7 it will be wild!
They way LeBron looked at AD after that chest bump though...Ad felt that in his soul for sure!!!..
How do you even question Lebron's evident greatness. To even still play at this level and be the spark and leader in itself aside from the Accolades. Definitely a GOAT in his own Reich. The new era hasn't left him behind. He still showing his greatness at an elite level. One of one.
Nobody touch Lebron in that OT and they said it was foul 😂😂😂😂
Lebron is obviously the GOAT. And I’m a MFFL. Dirk and Luka are my favorite players forever and that will never change.   But Lebron is the GOAT. He’s Karl Malone on crack.
Dillion who?
(watching L.A. Lakers)
…
Trade Morant, he is getting in the way like Monte Ellis did on the Warriors. Got rid of him, picked Dray and Klay in the draft and y'all know the rest
xqcL I see my juicer
Lebron took over.
Reaves and Bron CARRIED. DLo with those 3 hits in a row as wel
jarred vandervilt is the heart of this team 💪
I just peeped UNC Shay down below 😂
Wow that game was just wow
The blocks killed Memphis
NBA Executive of the Year - Rob Pelinka
AMAZING GAME!
I’ll say this as someone who really doesn’t care about this “debate”: If LeBron wins a chip with this team, the goat debate is over.
did morant really not learn from the last time he tried to jump over somebody lmfao bro need to sit down somewere lmfao
Sincerely, Lebron is incomprehensible. He is truly the King. undisputable argument. His very reliable, consistent, dependable, and trustworthy.   What more can I say🙄
all u meat muncherrs in the comments dont notice bron pushing ja mid air at 7:27, lakers dont get that call they lose in reg
whatta dogfight!! sheesh
LEBRON JAMES!!! IM SO HAPPY I GO INTO BASCKETBALL THIS YEAR
Lakers had that mamba mentality 🐍
One of the greatest games I've Ever seen in my life
🎉🎉🎉
Bro the Grizzlies are choking so HARD
Glad to see the wolves coming back and winning, let's go!
9:19 - LEBRON HAS BEEN PLAYING FOR 2 DECADES: THIS IS ONE OF HIS ABSOLUTE GREATEST PLAYS! DILLION BROOKES:  PUST SOME RESPECT ON LEBRON JAMES' NAME!
Buddha and XQC court side…nice!
we not going to act like ja didnt just try to jump over lebron james
LeBron is not clutch - haters
Being there after DLO hitting those 3 trays was ear popping noise level. I'm still having ringing in the ears this morning but it's all good since we got the W.
James is still the king!
Ja Morant is pretty. Like a girl. He should never get even close to prison.
Brooks going to China if Memphis losses this play off
Memphis crashing out 🤣🤣🤣 to old man James. They gon learn not to play w that man
The whole state of Tennessee can suck my balls.
That gorilla 🦍 look Lebron gave to the crowd at the final for the And1 during over time is pure entertainment. A True Barbarian Lebron is!
This game was so exciting I swear..  Lebron James makes the NBA so exciting, that you want to watch. When he leaves I don't know how to deal with that. Such a good player. Lebron James is the Greatest👋👋👋 hands down. People weren't you entertained?
I was there live 🎉🎉🎉 man LA ITS A PARADE INSIDE MY CITY YEAAAAA
After all year of talking smack about the west. Love seeing Memphis eat crow. They brought this on themselves, nothing but humble pie for all of them 🤣🤣🤣
Dillon Brooks  YOUNG AND RESTLESS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO PLAYERS WHO Taunted MJ. . Be careful what you ask for cuz now you got it. LBJ🏀
😢😢
Wow
Lehim
What a game 🔥🔥🦾🦾
LeBron wants his 5th ring 💍 .
8:16 - LOL LOOK AT SHANNON ON TOP OF THE SCORE
Memphis lost because of Jaren Jackson. Watch his defense 2nd half. His defense was bad this game.
Bron has the infinity stones in his back pocket. He performing crazy at this age!
Playing like a championship team, gotta love it! Everyone pulling they own weight ✊🏼
LeGoat
xQc really knows how to sit courtside at a Lakers game
7:25 - WOW!!!!! THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST NOTHING PLAY EVER! THIS IS THE PLAYOFFS
I see xqc
LBJ > MJJ
Dillion is so trash it’s insane
Bro the lakers just rejecting everything the grizzlies put up😂
They just blocking they st!t
Curb stomp
They need AD to score 30+ to seal the series or it will be a blowout for Grizzlies for game 5
Clutch play for Lebron
These guys know how to throw a ball through a ring!!!
Lebron James.  Clutch discussion?  Anybody talking anymore?
go Lakers!
❤
I fw lbj after this that’s that dog I like
Whos fine in the west?
Memphis has no one to worry about in the West...ok
4:26 - boy Morant look like a mortar blew his hand off
YEAAAH FVCK MEMPHIS!!  TALKS TOO MUCH & NEEDS TO GET HUMBLED DOWN
Wow what a game
Lets go lakerssssssssss
And they said Lebron ain't clutch😂😂
how is the other team not demoralized by this I mean the man is 40 years old and he’s the best player on the court is that just not absolutely shocking taking charge making the play of the night LeBron is absolutely crazy special I don’t even think it’s close he is the absolute goat he looks like he can go another 5to 10 years. Crazy We are so lucky to be able to watch him play
So glad I bet of OT I won $52 off of $5
where is Lebron's haters at? 😂
Thought lebron was old😂😴he the reason y’all lost this game😂😤
If All Bark No Bite Was A Team It’d Be Memphis💀😭All Dat Woofin Bron Said Whadddup 💪🏾
Morant dumb af
Exciting game
making sad seeing grizzlies lose
@7:50 clear travel by reeves at a critical moment in the game, it's as if there are no refs in these NBA games.
Lakers Knicks finale confirmed
7:26 no one gonna beetch about this?  Was this not the same play that got him injured in this series?  Great Def play and for Nick Wright to say this def play should be banned cause it gets players injured.....dude needs to go polish his participation trophies.  Ja did not need to jump from the free throw line.....try euro stepping or change angles and lay it off the back board instead of trying to dunk over a 6'8" 250 person.  Not gonna end well for you.
I don't see Grizzlie players doing no dancing these playoffs I wonder why o must be because they getting they ass humbled all the arrogant shit the grizz been doing and they never won anything to even have that energy look at them now 😂
Too many commercials NBA
LeGoatJames!!!👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gutsy win for the lakers
This 1st round of the NBA playoffs has been amazing. Some of the best games and individual performances I've ever seen
also very clutch layup from reaves 😧 7:50
It was a block party!🎉
That's the LeBron I always want to see!
That OLD man drop a 20-20 game bomb in the head of stupid Brooks!😂
👏👏👏😂 this is an awesome game. 😍👏👏💪 Good job LAKERS!!! 📢📢
Memphis "We good in the West" Grizzlies.
I wanna punch the kid with the black bored ape sweatshirt right in the face
The Clippers been promising us a post season battle. They still haven't kept up they're part of the bargain...
You wanna poke bears huh
Dang it feels nostalgia when Lebron James hit that clutch basket against Dillon Brooks and it reminds on his game winner lay up against Indiana when he was on Miami Heat Jersey🤩🤩🤩
You can hate LeBron all you want BUT he is the ultimate leader ! Look how much calm and better they played with him in the game … when he was on bench they couldn’t even hold on to the ball
That 9 point stretch from Dlo probably was the series-changer. I don't see the Lakers winning if the series were tied 2-2.
Lebronnnn with the clutch shot again
LeBron and team!  Let's go!
They locked up Ja the final stretch
havent been this exited for the lakers since the bubble season
I mean sometimes ja should learn to give up the ball. Why must u sacrifice your body like that. He just can't get the hold of the playoffs. And lets not forget about his injury last year
To all the fans that doubted the Lakers you don't deserve this
I bet Memphis smokes them in game 5, then LA finishes them in game 6.
The dangerous Lakers will win this series! When they beat the timberwolves in the play in tournament, grizzlies were already put into the situation that they did not expect it to happened.  Lebron and AD will hold this opportunity very very very tight so as their team mates!!!
Took care of things for the win
Ggz
This was NOT a good game. Yall must have only watched highlights. Way too many mistakes. Dennis getting turnover after turnover , and we got 30 balled by Desmond Bane.
Once upon a time Ja Morant said I am fine in the West .He is not worried about ANY team in the West.Well well well...
I love it james playing it safe with the drive ins instead of shooting 3s , since he knows he can’t shoot.
Wow, what a storied win for the Lakers. They barely got any calls going their way with their aggressive play at the basket, but made it up for their defensive intensity through each quarter. LeBron clutch as expected when he attacks the basket instead of the assisting. What a matchup, love Ja but he needs to relax a bit before he shortens his own career!
8:35 after lebron made the half court shot, look where the ball landed to LOL
that is the Anthony Davis that I know you can see the impact on the game
The athleticism, speed, and playmaking ability on both sides of the ball in this game was pretty amazing.
d lo clutch
LBJ > MJ
Yeah. The ads on this video are absolutely outrageous. It's like you could tell this person's broke cuz this video has more than 15 f****** ads on it
cant replace a lane presence like Anthony Davis man. Effects SO many more plays than show up on stat sheet
Morant tryna jump over or through lebron shows their youth lol should’ve went around or passed it….they’re not ready yet
Grizzlies dumb 10 seconds just run the clock out
The crow is so hype
That’s the most pumped I think I’ve ever seen Lebron. Unreal game!
James full effort just for ja lol
Lakas m talaga idol
James always needs a teammate with iq🤣🤣🤣
Anyone know if nba tests for EPO?
@7:01 the IQ of Lebron to know that Russell was hot , instead of giving him the ball for him to dribble into a three he gives it to Reaves who also knows the deal 🔥🔥🔥 that’s a team play , high IQ and that 3 after the buzzer 😰
Lebron did what Lebron does shoutout to russel for laying down the 3s to keep them in the game in a late game streth
Lebron act like beast then goes home an put on dress an purse😂😂😂
Big ups to Dillon Brooks, you earned this L bruh
That last bucket by bron was crazy I felt all that emotion when and AD started flexing 😭 Good Sh*t Lakers ‼️
The Lakers need to wrap this up in game 5 to give Lebron extra few days of rest time for a potential long series against the Kings or Warriors.
Playoffs lebron is coming at 38 years old !
This was a great game! I just hope moving forward that Lakers fix their frequent offense drought. There were a lot of times in the 3rd and 4th quarter that the shot clock winds without any offense play at all. All in all, respect for Bron and Ja too the young man has talent. IT was really a team effort what a game!
Experience is eating the grizzlies alive, you can tell the Lakers have switched gears to playoff mode since game 1 and the grizzlies still look like a regular season team
Lakers in 5
Lakers brought a tear to my eyes last night, crowd sounded like the World Cup
#Lakers_Nation  💪 🇵🇭
The Was Wangeles Wakers 🥹
Get yo weight up Dillon Brooks. For all yall Lebron haters. Eat a 🍆🤣
THAT WAS CRAZY
That was a classic
Brooks talking bout poking the bear and now he got ran over to end the game😂😂😂🤣
why bane has a t rex wingspan??
Wow. What a game
LeBron looks hungry for more this year. Wouldn’t be surprised if they make it deep in the playoffs
Legoat 💪🏾🔥🔥
brooks wanting to guard Lebron is so funny to me
I'm confined in the west -ja morant
test
Memphis one of the weakest #2 seeds in the last few years
Bane had a hell of a night but king James has a vendetta against Dillon brooks that was not gonna be denied or sidelined.
Davis Block!!!
Chumps vs Champs! Now we truly see the difference... 💜💛
LET’S GOOOOOO LAKERS, I’M SOOOOOO OF MY TEAM THE LAKERS. IT’S TIME FOR LEBRON 5TH RING 💍 🏆💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛
Lakas talaga ng Lakers pag ganito ka hustle defense nila
xQc and Buddha blessed up Lakers!!!
Lakers baby
Man that D Lo 3 that rattled out at the end of regulation tho .. luckily the Lakers still took the W.   You know what they say,... Can't spell Grizzlies without the L
Russell's big two threes
9:26 this Lebron play was the dagger
Ja mordant needs to cut his hair. Got the swag of a high school chick.
7:26 2 v 1 on the fast break could’ve gave it up and got it back or just give it up to his teammate , Jalmost decides to take off from the line. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Go Lakers
LeGoat
There going to choke grizzlies will come back from being down 3-1
LeBron the GOAT!!! *Lets END the debate...
broken brooks 😭
Bron is the most clutch player of all time , look it up
God damn what a game.
xQcL
The Lakers really need to fix their perimeter defense - WAY too many easy looks for Memphis.  Where is AD?   Also, too many turnovers.  Thank goodness DLo stepped up in the 4th quarter to help LBJ.
One of the most clutch players in history of the sport
And I do not want to hear anything about bron not being clutch
AD already gets a pass...this only made it worst. The Lakers will not win the championshio if AD isn't the MVP. AD can't keep putting that load on Lebron ⏸️💀
Brooks is never going to live down giving LeBron bulletin board material that has backfired horribly on the Grizzlies.
So AD the only center we got ? Where Mo and Tristain Thompson ?? We gone burn AD out dude
Yessir 👑
Let’s go Lakers
Reaves be breaking ankles out there #lakerforlife
Hold up we act like Lebron is suppose to do this at that age, that shits crazy 20 20 game in year 20
This grizzle losing cause no Steven adams anthony Davis be having problems with strength he great bt when it’s a body on him shit be different     Also nobody running through and adams screen  They thought they was on warriors level y’all couldn’t take down old man James  and 65-81% AD
This is by far the deepest and most complete team that Lebron has ever been on.  I hope they win it all.
GOO LAKERS
dillon brooks's jumpshot is so ugly 🤮
I can't tell if its the coach or a psychologist, but someone has certainly been telling the lakers how to snap AD out of that injury mindset! He still falls and screams constantly but the lakers seem to ignore it now! Either that or they help him up and just keep playing! Dennis did that last night. It happened the game before as well. AD eventually just gets up and goes back to focusing on the game.  I'm not saying all his injuries are fake or exaggerated by the way. It's just, he's kinda in the hypochondriac category. Now that he's being ignored, it doesn't take him or the game over. He just gets up, shakes it off, and goes back to playing allstar caliber! I love it! Whoever taught the players to do that, has saved them from letting that negative mindset take over. Will power at it's finest! Lakers did not have this last year!
Wow.  Lebron still has it.  No one should want to play LAL right now.  AD had a shit game and still made winning plays at the end too.
Just soo many clutch plays on the lakers side. They just kept finding ways to stay in the game and to win.  #LetsGoLakers
Being there live was an experience I'll never forget. We were on our feet the whole game. I've been to a bunch of regular season games but none compared to the atmosphere of a playoff game. Go Lakers!
Who's saying that Lebron's OLD?
Legacy game for LeThanos
What a game by the LAKERS!!!! 💪
Enough of this “The teams nowadays couldn’t handle 90s D” lol
LAKERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRS!!!
Killers on the rise!
1 more game and we will see how The West is not Fine With Him....🤣🤣 wanna see this Bubble head Muscle Men Cry like a Baby😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 #LakersWin
This series is over,  no way Lakers lose 3 straight,  so much for ja saying he doesn't worry about anyone in the west 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Better respect, LeBron while he still playing 😮‍💨📌
Vanderbilt is an underrated pickup for the lakers especially since he could play well on both sides of the ball as he showed in this game
Last time Lakers had the best lineup for a title shot was in  20-21 season, when AD got injured in first round. But anything could happen, as long as they play and defend like this, they're still a contender.
Why all the ref baiting and complaining, ive never seen every single person on the court complain to the refs. Just play basketball dummies, ja is out there jumping around and personally fouling dennis schroder like 40 times off ball and it was never called, yet hes mad he cant dunk on lebron cause he was set in the paint before ja got there. Obvious charge ja, just like most of your dunks, how about you work on your 3 ball and win games you fuckin bunny rabbit. This isnt 2k, play fucking basketball, or go assault more children whatever it is ja is doin these days, we all know its not winning basketball games as the 2 seed.
Vanderbilt and Hachimura are the best snatch out of that trade deadline.
Awesome FN Game. I was outside the building cheering on my Lakers. The struggle is real! I'll be there again on Wednesday, can't wait!!!
(Maury) When it comes to baby grizzly Dillon Brooks, LeBron, U R THE FATHER!!!
If darvin ham knew how to use his players lakers would blow teams out.  His still not playing Lonnie Walker or bamba. Also ham is only playing Vanderbilt 20 mins a game. I really hope they let him go after the season. He’s not a head coach
Lebron can still get you a bucket when needed!  Teaches the grizz to stop talking so much like they have accomplished anything! I know they have adams and Clarke out but if that is why you can’t beat the 7 seed….
First Jimmy Buckets has a classic to upset the Bucks and put them on the brink, now the King has settled down this young Grizz team to put them against it as well. Great night for hoops
Are we about to see a #1 seed and a #2 seed lose in the opening round in the same playoffs?
the hell this memphis dynasty doing
So much love and hate for LA this year alone who were hating should be ashamed now
I see my juicer in the crowd!
Both of these fools getting knocked out, but exciting play GG fellas--both of y'all.
Mf done poked the wrong bear...
Last name every, first name greatest
Shoutout to DLO hitting those late three balls i was wandering what happened to bro!
Thank you d lo 💯
Both teams shot terrible from 3. But lakers just got more efficient shots in the paint. Bane was keeping Grizzlies in the game though, they just need to pick up the intensity and attack the rim as well and just relying on jump shots.
That last second block by AD in regulation  isn't getting NEAR the play it deserves.
Dillon Brooks asked for it and then he got it, and then he didn’t know what to do when he got what he asked for.
People need to stop acting like having Clarke and Adam’s just automatically makes the grizzlies sweep the lakers. The grizzlies have there 3 best players of course they would be better but I think both teams would have a chance either way
Nah when LeBron made that half court shot u know it was over
Wow im so proud of lebron and the lakers stepping up like that theyve been playing trash all season
james vs morant
Don't really like LeBron but I dislike this soft genteration even more so I hope he do his thing against them grizzs
First time I've ever seen  a NBA highlight video where they favored one team over another. I've never seen bloopers or bad plays before. Have you? Like LA much mr editor?????
Its a parade inside my city yeahhhhh! 😂
King James 👑 I will never doubt that man’s ability ever again after last nights performance. There will never be another LBJ.  S/o J.butler he is an all time great.
folks put a home depot black friday ad on this shit … bruh it’s april 😂
DEANGELO RUSSELL saved The LAKERS @$$£$.
Hey Brooks.! 🤣
Looks like Dillion *Dynasty* Brooks is gonna lose to an old man
xqcL
👑💪
No one's gonna talk about xQc just enjoying the game? Okay.
Go Lakers y'all beat all odds all that trash talk what ya got to say now Dillion Brooks you ain't ever  been as good as lebron and never will
Dillon brooks this is for you!! Go home and play mobile legends
Dillon Brooks eatin a big pile of dog sh*t. A Grizzly poked the bear.  😂
Why is the video quality trash on this one?
Rob Pelinka TOTALLY redeemed himself with the mid-season trades he made. Who knew the chemistry would be this dangerous?
This series is 🔥🔥🔥
Legrizzly
Finally Killer Instinct. Lebron is showing it
I'm a curry and Bill Russell fan.  I'm sorry but lebron is the goat..    lost for words
Lebron don’t fail to deliver in her bad nights
The Grizzlies just aren't ready to take it to the next level. Great game and great win for LA.
So nobody's going to talk about the shot that LeBron made essentially across the entire court 🤣🤣🤣 lol. That was amazing.
The best laker game of the year ….. yes ?
Long live the king!!
lol very exciting to see the Lakers evenly matched against one of the worst playoff teams in the NBA. Cant wait for the Lakers to get to round 2 and get stomped by the Warriors or the Kings
Im a LeGm fan but this win doesn't sit well. The Lakers have two other players that they have to get involved of they want to win. That's rui and Beasley. Tonight, they got the job done without either but that's because they inserted Vanderbilt in the starting lineup to guard ja. Ja only scored 19. That could be from his injury though. Something just seemed off.
Are all refs either blind or extremely sensitive? too much missed fouls on both sides.
Brooks getting pressed by a 38 year old LeBron XD
He’s 38
Where is Dillon Bricks??😂,so quiet now
The lakers is looking dangerous for their next round opponent
Incredible game by both teams
Awesome win by my Lakers! When #6 plays defense the chances of winning go up substantially. And that block by Anthony just forced it into OT. What a huge comeback to destroy the brown bears. #2 is just so good at shutting them down=scoreless brown bears.
Lebron is almost 40 btw !
Anyone notice XQC in the first row?
quality games this season in NBA
Who said Lebron not clutch 🤫
Waiting for yaboiyikes to comment
ja should have waited to take last shot
Flopping and rolling on the floor sometimes helps... hahahaa
Lakers looking dangerous! I hope they don't play the Warriors though!
hanes
awesome game!
terry                  bbbbbbbbbbbb                 fozzy                  bvd
One thing for sure this GRIZZLIES TEAM is a trash team... much trash talking but can't finish a game.
Fuck the grizzlies
I've been hating on my Lakers for a while now, mostly because I don't like LeBron, but they are playing incredible right now. This is exciting!
Ledaddy owns brooks
That boy Austin Reaves is smooth. He definite grew into me. Good game Lakers, see you Memphis at Game 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MR COW
Good to see my lakers doin work on the defensive end, Dlo hitting 3 3s in a row was cool too
Watched this bc of Mr. Cow
Ja still fine in the west now 😅
Lets go lakeshow
Ja cant take Vandervilt without a pick. Vandervilt plays big D.
And they say Bron not clutch
Dillon Brooks who old now
great night for basketball apparently lol HYPE ass game
7:27 had be crying 😂
Poor Dillon. He just wanted to flex on the king 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A minute 2:06 look how jersey #21 sticks his legs up to trip RH dude. dirty plays!
Wow super galing talaga na akong idol Lakers congratssss
grizzlies a bunch of soft ass wanna be thugs. they're literally a joke of a basketball team.
Lakers crowd has been excellent these past two games
Where ps that big badass Brooks at? Getting owned by daddy!
For all you A-HOLES who keep saying Bron can't play with out dominating the ball...how many times in key moments did you see someone other than Bron with the ball in their hands...?  Bron doesn't NEED to run the offense. He DEFAULTS to run the offense UNLESS there is someone with a high IQ he can fall back to. Remember Bron played with Rondo and won and it was Rondo who ran the offense late  Bron has been blocking shots and playing more defense and rebounding like a monster BECAUSE HE CAN REST MORE if he's not running the offense. He is allowing others to DO THEM and ya said he doesn't
The goat in the zone🎉
Damn I’m getting so “OLD”I  fell asleep during the third quarter. These ten o’clock Lebron games be the worst IMO. Still young enough Brooks was tripping 😂😂😂
Did he say “…the switch, now with Edney on him?”  Mixing up those Tyus  boys I see
Lebron James & Austin Reaves I’d like him & the new Wade a Little.
Lets go lakers
Saan c Mr fine
Man DLo hit some big boy shots down the stretch!!
yyooowooo nga kabaw...
Memphis talked all that sh@t😂😂 LA looks tough!
#15  is the best white boy in the nba 😂
IM FINE IN THE WEST hahaha..GO LAKESHOW❤
7:25 Ja morant still dreaming to posterize Lebron James but he can't lol😂
I think the most impressive thing about this game is that LeBron made the 3/4 court shot at 8:30 and make it look so easy! If only there was just 1sec more!
Lebron smiling away at the grizzly player that called him old 😂
This team is so much more complete
Man I m watching the 4th and overtime and before I even mention Bron, I gotta say...Reaves and DLo!!!! f they were big man. THIS IS WHAT HELP LOOKS LIKE.  Great shot by Bron to tie the game and great and 1 to seal it. Brooks tried to put pressure on the "old man" and the old man got by him and treated him like a child for that AND1  "Haters need a new campaign"  "13th seed" "No playoffs" "1st round exit"  Haven't aged well. They are about to have to switch to "Warriors/ King in 5" or "2nd round exit" next lol
lebron is to bug to be getting changes😂 tell that big as man ti get up😂
Desmond Bane, Ja Morant, and Jaren Jackson…if they can keep the core group together. Memphis may someday get a chip
That shot of bron flexing in OT I Guarantee you ! That’s gonna be a MYTEAM card picture soon Brody #2k 😂 🚫🧢 🃏
Pp
Ja is so bad🤣🤣🤣 Lebron ruining these guys at 40
Hilomon man brooks
9:20 Barbeque Chicken
What a comeback  I just order tnt when the lakers tie the game and going to ot  That’s the lakers same of 2010 Kobe and gasol
The way LeBron has turned up the intensity for the playoffs is insane. He's like a totally different player. He truly does play at 70% effort during the regular season.
I feel sorry for the Griz, they played so well all season long, but ran into resurgent Lakers in the 1st around.
So intense Im lovin it!!!
I KNEW MY INSTINCTS WERE RIGHT! I’ve been saying this since they traded for Russell, the lakers could stay healthy, they would be SCARYYY. This simply proves if LAL win Game 5, they gonna give their next team a run for their money
I’ll be the one to say it BANE YO ARMS SHORT ASF THEM SHITS LOWKEY ANNOYING ME BAAAAADDDD😂😂😂😡
Lakers 💯💯🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽. James 👑 defines clutch. Reaves is money. Lakers vs Heat finals again.
One of the great games in the magnificent career of Lebron James.
I've never been a LeBron James fan but that was spectacular. Put the ball on the floor and take it to the hoop. Dominate. That's what LeBron needs to do if the Lakers are gonna win this series.
All I can do is 🙃🙃🙃
Thanks Dillion.
bruh has there ever been a big man with lateral defensive ability like V8? Bro straight up is guarding a PG and clamping will being a 6'9" powerfoward on the offensive end lol
Yeah!!!! LBJ!!!!
If only Adams can play in memphis it's different result though good game for both team lakers is lucky this round1
Peso pluma 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Still that dude
another year of people being surprised by lebrons greatness
That was a GAME
I saw a lot of energy and passion in that 4th and OT and that's all I care about. So proud of the LakeShow this game.
The boy Reeves playing well and making great plays.. The man did get away with a travel on that lay up at 7:48
Giannis hurt, kings will beat warriors and nuggets will beat suns. This will be the easiest championship Boston has ever won
Morals is a championship player. But you have to play as a TEAM
Like I said the Grizzlies are garbage the only reason they stay second in the west is because the West was fuck up this year. let's see how they do next year when you get eliminated from the playoffs this year not saying the Lakers are going to go all the way😂😂😂😂 but it's possible
Bron a goon .. shout out all the lakers but damn bron they can’t guard you
Dillon brooks hiding near the bench at the end of OT. Bron cooked his ass, first one back to the locker room LMAO
Bro this is the best game i ever seen.  Lebron back to back blocks.  AD Blocked game winner  Dlo with 3 straight threes  Lebron with the and 1 dagger to win the game
Lebron taking Brooks off the dribble for the and 1 to seal the game was just beautiful.
Ja "We're good in the WEST" Good at getting stomped.
❤
Someone once said that how do you beat a champion? You have to study a champion. If he click 2 you have to click 5. Work harder, faster, quicker. Lakers been there done that and they know that their in a battle with a hungry team 🏀🏆
This is like watching AI against the Lakers in 2001 cmon Ja
Announcer all over Morants nuts 😂
Who the hell cares? Get a fucking life losers. These niggs should be waiting tables down at the interstate
Memphis always have bad luck in the playoffs, last year Ja was hurt, this year Adams and Clark is hurt.
EVERYBODY SLEEPING ON THE LAKERS!!!!!!!!!!
LOL!
Russell !!!!  3 - 3s.  Dagger after dagger.  He plays like that every game we will be in the finals.
Wow lol.
Ion fw Ja really, but he was getting fouled like a mf all game 😂😂
Reeves to LeBron: “Okay, I’m not him anymore, you him” 😂
All Dillon Brooks had to do was stfu now look at Memphis down 3-1 smh
Old Man did his thing
4th quarter takeover by d-lo and lbj. 🔥
Grizzlies or should I say the Fizzlies or Flousies.  Like Ja said " I'm not worried about the west!."  Grizzlies can't be called a dynasty unless you do something great like make it to the championship and actually win at least 3!  Dine nastly, cuz they eatin shit!
Somebody check on the smoker.
wow 🔥
bron is so great .... all lakers team congrats for mimphis team bye just go home and sleep well.
Lmao AD saved his career on that block 😂then lebron with the half court shot lol shot out to brooks for that floating dunk
NEVER EVER EVER DISRESPECT THE KING .. THE BEST PLAYER YOU'LL EVER SEE IN THIS LIFE TIME ..
Lebron still doing this at 38 is nothing short of remarkable! Great game!
Damn NBA chill with the Ads
😁King James, and Lakers are getting close to closing out the series. It was a nailbiter in regulation, and OT. Lakers won 117-111.
I don't respect no old man till he give me 40.....Will 22 and 20 do? 😅 😅😅
What a game... Bron did his thing obviously but I think Russell might get the game ball, without those back-to-back-to-back 3s might well have been ova
Who says Legoat is mot clutch???? At his age performing such level of basketball is truly unbelievable... Lucky to witness his greatness👏👏👏👏👏
Dillon Brooks needs to be harassed by the media until they get a statement out of him.
THE JAMES GANG
This game 4 is all about defense daamm!! I suddenly remembered the blocked party in 2019-20 Regular season of Lakers
LeBron & AD will win there 2nd ring together this year! 2023 NBA Champs L.A Lakers
AD is so inconsistent. He needs to step up in Game 5
Brooks nothing but a big ass mouth! King James teaches him a lesson every game 👑
Yo these playoffs are tense!!!
Bias...every Memphis missed the shot it shows but Lakers not😢😢😢
"I'm fine in the west"
Shout out to Dillon Brooks mann so inspirational.... i mean wow jus wow the motivation this man has been for the Lakers 🔥💯
"I'm fine in the west"
People that know me know I'm not a Laker fan by any stretch. But why didn't they play like this throughout the regular season? They seemed completely out of sync. Round 1, they've been a joy to watch. Their intensity, team work, and general cohesiveness has been great.
LOLOL typical Memphis…ALL TALK 🤣🤡
Ja Morant is the only player the grizzlies has!!  maybe Jackson he’s a good center but that’s it everyone else is trash😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
I'm just happy these teddy bears are 1 game away from being out.
The refs are blowing the whistle at all the wrong times.
All that shit these young bitches talked you’re leaving around one😂😂😂😂😂
Bit Lebrun James Thor 📌
What a game! All around team win. AD had a horrible game but still made plays, Reaves was consistent in scoring, DLo came thru huge in the 4th, and Lebron closed it. Vando had a fantastic game also
Don't forget about AR. He's been great too with those clutch shots and brillant passes!
Daumn dude this playoffs lebron is really something else , dude just took the ball in the OT and manhandled the opposition
8:28
Love how that trans and rainbow crap is leaking into that Hip Hop culture. Ja wih the sweet rainbow hair strands. You go they/them!
8:24 Coach Stanley 😅
Them lil niggas going home
Who would have guessed waking up this morning that Lakers and Heat would be up 3-1 on top seeds. But it's true....Go Lakers. Dillion your family calling you CRICKETS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Man Skip Bayless has a point, LeBron should be driving like this in crunch time, fucking unstoppable.
Them boys deserved that game like them or not. And if anyone says LeBron is not the goat then watch this game again
Dillon Brooks- LeBron is old  LeBron- so you've chosen death?
Yes Lakers
Idk Y so many hate Lebron LIKE!!! Be fr!
“I’m fine in the west”
That last second shot kept me from 957 off a 5 dollar bet, absolutely bullshit
They shouldn't have called LeBron an old man
A great game ever. Go Lakers👊💛
He's Old. Dillon Brooks to LBJ
I told y’all lakers in 6
You gotta talk to that man with respect.. Mr. LeBron “King” James
Lebron trash AF
Dillon 🧱
What a game!!
Morant is a bogus player hahaha.....
"We're fine in the west"
Ja “Im fine in the west.” after game 4 “No comment.”
Such a shame that this game is at 10 PM eastern.
Travel james hahha
Go lakers
These fuvking ads suck!!
“I don’t care he’s old” - Dillon brooks
These highlights don’t do it justice this was one of those games you just had to see live!
Best game of the playoffs so far and the King came thru in the clutch.
I just want to say. March madness was nothing but madness this year, and now we have these ridiculous playoffs it’s crazy. 2023 is a great year for basketball
Lakerss 😤🔥🏆We odw
This game was basketball at its finest. Playoffs looking good this year 🔥
As a Lakers and Cavaliers fan, I’m so happy that the Lakers won again last night and are now up Three games to one in the series and I hope that the Lakers win tomorrow night so that way they can have more than three days off waiting for their opponent to see if they’re going to play the Sacramento Kings or the Golden State Warriors In the second round!!
Just being you yelled out Ayy doesn’t fucking mean it’s a foul nigga 😂
Yeah! Woo! Go Lakers! Go Lebron, go Davis, go Reeves, go Russel! Yeah kick grizzlies ass! Haha woo 😂
At 7:27  the king was almost dethroned
Nah they poked the bear and the whole lakers team came to defend him they r playing like true contenders
Imagine if LeBrons half court shot counted
Ja travels and carries every time he touches the ball.... SMH
I live on the east coast, I wish these games came on earlier. I’d loved to watch this one in real time. Damn
This is the type of lakers I miss. Felt like a Kobe game
"Grizz" talk so much "chit"....  Teams gonna wanna beat your @$$ no matter what when you do that.
Lesson: Never poke bears
Dillion said he likes to poke bears 😂well ok
Really wish this game didn't come on at 10pm Eastern. Us east coast dads gotta stay up till damn 3 am to finish this game
Hey brooks put ur mouth where your money is
I’m not a huge lebron fan but that’s the best laker game he’s had.
Lakers really goin to pull this series out. Aren't they?!?!?!
You really couldn’t look away from this one!! Sheeeesh!!
No.2 upset by no.7
Vintage King James..
That crowd like being at a fifa game insane 🤣
Sending energy and love to all laker nation.Proud of my lakers and brotherhood of the purple and gold.#mambamentality
LeBron clutch king 👑 - high layup off the glass knowing JJJ was coming to block him and then OT. Haters 😢😢
Gotta respect Shcroder he tried his best to throw the game🤣
My god tonight’s games were just immaculate
Hey Dillon brooks, still want lakers? Hahahaha
one of the unexpected things in the lakers is you will not know who's the one who gonna step up sometimes it's reeves schroder rui vanderbilt russell brown davis or lebron. you know you're team is screwed if just the 3 of them step up.
You lebron haters were fucking sick when he made that clutch lay up ahahhahaha
What a game ...!!!holly s......t go lakers
Grizzlies exposed
2 of the best playoff games in years happened last night. Appreciate stuff like that 🙏
Still......after 20 years...when the game is on the line....the ball is in the King's hands.
Heh they gone 😂
Lebron and 1 screaming or Jimmy Butler screaming this my shit ?
The grizzlies fall off has been disgusting 😂😂😂 I love it. Haven’t heard a bum ass grizzly fan in a loonnggg time.
Their effort on defense is the best I have seen on any team in a long time.
LeGOAT
Thats what i am talking about .Go Lakers.
lakeshow 💛💜
Brooks became a witness tonight
Never ever disrespect your elders.
That's dynsty of loosers
Look like they are carrying the ball
Whoever crying over LJ 20/20 gotta understand he is the oldest2do it and the 1st2do it at his age 🤣🤣🤣🤣 i see he still rent free In some of yall heads 🤣🤣🤣 let's go LA good game 2 Memphis 2 Yall lebron haters have a good day2..
Lebron is really in the Playoffs mode
One of the best basketball games I’ve ever seen
I love this laker team how they compete and how they play d this team can win a championship
Cry now broonks hahaha
08:09 Le Bron layup must be #1 most difficult clutch play ever made in NBA history he scored over not 1 defender not over 2 defenders but over 3 defenders. Super dope 👍 then he virtually repeats drive 09:23 Super dope Super dope 👍
I'm fine in the west.....
I'm no fan of neither team But Grizzlies taking this series in the end....
Desmond Bane had me tearing my face off lol. He put on a clinic
What pisses me off about YouTube is that there was an ad before I watched this. And 1:15 seconds into the video they’re is another fuckimg ad. YouTube is a damn joke with these ads 💯
Is this where I become a lebron fan?😅
Goat
Beating your chest because of a lay up Lebron....ok....lol
08:05 Morant behind the back pass was must be the #1 most creative and most difficult performed pass in history he is going for layup defender challenges him and at last minute he throws ball behind his back with left hand to teammate perfection 👍
that old man as dillon brooks stated took on five grizzlies and still beat them,22 points and 20 rebounds😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
man austin reaves is gonna be special
So do carries not exist in the NBA anymore?
Vanderbilt is an absolute BEAST
Memphis’ body language is atrocious.
Dlo got ice in his veins for the 3 straight threes to bring ‘em back
Lakers in 6
that first points by Vanderbilt 🔥🔥🔥
Grizzlies are trash la in town
The script is already set. Lakers-Celtics finals. This nonsense is too obvious now, they don’t even try to hide it anymore.
Natahimik ang kayabangan ni brooks at Morant 🤣🤣🤣
Wanna be lance Stephenson should be crying now 😂
Why are they pressing Lebron in the 4th yk that Nigga don’t want the ball🤦🏽
Can y'all please stop showing Bron's highlights. no one cares. He's "Old".😂😂 Brooks looks Soo dumb right now.
DLo finally got some 3's to fall, just when we needed them! 🔥
I bet dillon brooks wish he could score 10 15 pts a game...if you look at dude reaction everytime he make a shot he be actin like the crowd suppose to explode for him...99% of his shots are always wide open... nobody expects him to get the ball and even on offense he gets out the way
Hell ya! I never root for LBJ but F Ja and the grizzlies!
The Man Lebron is structured he's to smart 🤓 literally
kyrie: LeBron ain't clutch😂
I swear LeBron and Tillman look like long lost brothers. I think they got the same dad
being on the east coast sucks
Feel the goat mask coming this am
Where all you clipper fans at? Talking trash while you’re about to be bounced and the lakers move on to the next round. Enjoy your regular season wins lmao
"Keep building this dyansty" and getting knocked out on the first round
Lakers ain’t no joke now. Don’t get it twisted.
Lebron's first ever 20+ rebound game.
🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣 🐐🐐🐐
Great job LBJ way to grab the rebounds and get your team involved. Definitely shouldn’t took a half court shot before halftime. Stay away from the three and attack inside and pass the ball to outside shooters
If the lakers had aquired these roster at the beginning of the season, they would've been #1 in the west. Great team effort. 👌
7:25  Morant just do the same shit everytime. You can't do risky shit and always expect defenders to have regards to your safety. Damn one of these days, we'll have another Paul George typa shit.
"He old" 😂🤡
Those aren’t her real teeth- please tell me know. Those can’t be real- I’ve never seen that before. No one would allow that- please. 😢😢😢😢
Although I ain't saying that one call decides the game, that last foul call on Brooks was BS. You let them play the whole game and then call that ish.
Im glad lerbon knew to stand there and not give ja that free lane...if he doesnt do that ja attacks anybody standin there in the future
somehow feels like lakers and heat rematch
The monkeyy🔥🔥🔥
What a block by ad 😂😂😂
Gotta give it to Pelinka with those trades.
Skip is gonna be Happy.  Undisputed will be good today.
If lebron wins a ring at 38 then there's no denying that he's far better than jordan.
👍👍👍👍
Lebron Is Doing God Mode IN His Playoffs Damn What A effort of his team LETS GO LAKERS 💜💛😁
Man.  Respect To James and company.  Good win.  James showed he could come up big when needed.
Ok they had a block party and I wasn’t invited that crazy
INSTANT CLASSIC
Bron is in damn near every highlight 👑
Why all a sudden Dillion Brooks don’t wanna talk to media??? He loved it all year especially when he was straightening his hair dancing like an idiot   Guess now everyone sees him for the shit player he is and now he’s in his feelings 😢
No one in basketball history can stop playoff lebron, unless your name is J.R. Smith.
Lakers don't play with them end it
Ja Morant go beat some more kids hahahaha keep dreamin dude 😂😂😂😂😂😂
All this live for russel and lebron, and while it is fully deserved, let’s not forget that Reeves was the highest scorer (for the Lakers) this game. He played exceptionally well too.  Just a great performance all around by both teams really.
❤
F brooks 🎉😂
8:15 recklessly jumping on ppl same way he did when tried to dunk on Bron in this game. JA had to brace himself on the person below putting himself and others at risk. Same way he did when he got hurt in game 1 recklessly jumped up came down on AD and his own wrist 🤦‍♂️
Wahahaha. Gg Memphis.
Ja bouncing off of LeBron like a small child, heh.
This game deserves 20k likes! What a game! 🔥🔥
Gentlemen's we might get a gentleman (sweep) which is 4-1
Somebody better tell Dillon Brooks that the playoff started, he's been too busy talking to even notice
It’s a block party
im fine in the west😂😂😂
But the king ain't clutch?!?! GTFOH
All that talk Lakers ain't going no where now we here 💯
LAKE SHOW
Man that was exciting! An Amazing team effort by the Lakers and great display by, Ja also.
Lebron
“Nah, IM good in the west” lmaoooo
Never forget “WE ALL GOOD IN THE WEST”, “He’s old” , “DYNASTY” never forget this
Im still devastated about allowing the layup to force overtime but respect to lebron for showing no quit 🥲🤝
8:17 LeGOAT mode, LBJ is clutch, period! at 38 y/o still playing like a god!!!
"Your team Lakers is only 13th seed" (before all star), such an eye sore to haters using this argument.
That almost Bron buzzer beater though! 👑
All props to Russell, those 3s were crucial
Imagine you have a dramatic slam dunk on a guy's head as a buzzer beater and your pops is right under the rim to chest bump you 🎉🎉🎉🎉 dam that has to be an incredible feeling for both men. I'm glad my Lakers won though 😂
For how many years AD and brin play basketball and the fire is off, I think this is the time the fire is on 🔥
What a match
Lakers looking like a Championship team tonight.
Memphis played so soft they better tighten next game no 🧢
Lakers vs warriors will be the best  series we will ever see
I said this after lakers beat minnesota for a play in spot..if lebron play jus a little bit of defense no team can beat the lakers ...well we seein wat happens when lebron gives a little effort
bro that face 9:31
Ja thinks he can dunk on everyone.  That's why ya hand fck up now.
This is why you don’t poke bears
I surely they will play this well on Wednesday.  Great job, LaBron and Anothony did a great job, and so did Delo Russell.
After watching these highlights, Let's talk about GOAT level
I fuck with Ja hard but my only problem with him is when it’s going their way he’s the loudest one in the room but if there’s conflict he can’t be found
THANKS FOR SHOWING BLOCKS
@9:30 the king!!! 😤
One thing I’ve always respected about Bron is his willingness to draw Charges on defense
This series going 7, I don't see the Lakers winning in gm 6
Lakers don't want to see lebron crying in there homecourt
Lakers to the chip!!!
Congrats! Hope they finish it in game 5.
We good in the west
08:15 OVER THE BACK FOUL ON JA MORANT. GAME OVER😂😂😂😂
full game pero wala ung OT bobo
JA IS TRASHHHHHHHHHHHH, DILLON DYNASTY BROOKS NEEDS TO BE IN THE G LEAGUE
Lakers ❤👊🏼
Don't worry guys Ja's not worried about the west 😂
Peso pluma front row 😂😂
"Bron isn't clutch" Lol
That game was amazing !!!
This man is unbelievable i mean come straight out of high school.....you have nba players saying he wont make it....look what he is doing....got  drafted first round pick....the players on the team he got drafted to said he might as well jump on the bandwagon....took the weakest team to the playoffs and finals....yes he lost but left  won back to back championships and went back to his home and one a championship for them...left and one another one.....and after that missed the playoffs and now he is in the playoffs dominating at the age of 38 and stil going......the number one all time leading scorer....im glad to witness this man doing the game he loves..on and off the court thats inspiration....keep going king James dont worry no hater says about you
End Of 3rd Quarter Is On Fire 🔥
So many clutch shots from different players. The trust that they have in each other to make the clutch shots is amazing to watch.
Lebron just a old man.😅😅😅
Yesterday was a block party in L.A, then boys were sending everything.
bro lbj with those blocks. He's such a great player. unstoppable. I love curry and the warriors, but lbj is taking it this year.
Griz coach failed these young players, you have to make James shoot the jump shot don’t let him drive zone and let shoot jump shots when the game is on the line. Great win by James and the lakers.
Hahahaha the Grizzlies are trash always making noise in regular season, come playoffs they always lose? A 2 seed playing a 7 seed cmon! Bye Memphis
The commentary is boring asf they not even excited this the mf playoffs
Where are you no brooks?
Just wondering what happened to the so called "Brooks" Dynasty???🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
One more
go Lakers!
The NBA Refs during the playoffs have been so embarrassing. Not even one-sided but just so inconsistent and constantly missing basically everything (out of bounds, obvious fouls, one million moving screens, etc). It just honestly takes away from some of these awesome games with such poor officiating.
LeBron 👑 I thank you
Just one more win, really hope Lakers wins the series... So that Kings or Warriors would slaughter them. Exciting days ahead
Fine in the west
Old man where 😂
wow
This series and warriors are best series in this playoff
James rocked the House, with His supportive LA Lakers team mates. 4.24.23
I can't believe that Vanderbuilt actually got into double figures.  He had zero points in game 3.
People need to understand that the common factor in 2 years of amazing series is the Grizzlies. They are forcing teams to play out of their skins to beat them. Their time will come
Kobe would be proud fam.
Don't talk to Bron again..
"Dillon Brooks picks up James" "He wanted James, he gets it." "James drives, James is foouuuUUULLLED! AND ONE! LEBRON!"  in an Overtime, in the closing moments.  that must have put a dagger into Brooks' heart. Cold blooded.
Ion care he old 😭😭😭😅😅😅
AD has to play better
That damn Reeves always hitting timely shots.
Congratulations Lakers your all the best awesome 💪🙌👏💜💛👑  Game 1 win Lakers Game 2 win Memphis Game 3 win Lakers  Game 4 win Lakers  1 Memphis - 3 Lakers
Respect your elders or “Fuck around and find out”
Respect your elders or “Fuck around and find out”
What a game
Davis blocking ja at the end! 😬😬😬
Ja Morant’s hair flops more than anyone in the NBA.
8:50 Follow Jaren Jackson Jr, Some guy pushes him
AD having a bad game. Hachimura didn't pop off too and they still won. Grizzlies are cooked.
I LOVE TO SEE LEBRON BLOCK SHOTS IN THE PLAYOFFS
What a game!! The Grizzlies would be feeling like WTF?!? They wouldn’t have expected to be in this position the first round.
DLO NASTY
D’Lo been pretty terrible but props he stepped up big time in that 4th
Don’t poke the bear
I love that moment 9:30
play-off Lebron wow!
And that’s why he was crowned the king he makes everyone around him better.
Dillon Brooks said he don’t respect anybody that doesn’t give him 40, Lebron had 22 and 20, that’s 42 for him! 😂😂
Lakers aint beating the warriors or kings next round
Vando should of gave his jersey to that white boy on Memphis bench that waved his firsr 3 off...
AD was really off this game, but he showed up when it really mattered.
Folks this just end when lebron dont gotta carry the load on offense his defense intensity is on another level. 20-20 and a clutch shot with great defense 🐐. great team win
1 more to go let’s go Lakers
Hachimura be looking like Yungeen Ace sometimes 😂😂
Great game🎉
Dillion talking all that and wanting lebron on the last possession just to get scored on as usual 🤦🏽‍♂️
Yeasss get rid  of them damn Memphis Cubs
These niggas might mess around and win it all if they keep this up.
wow a year 20 guy, vs year something guys .... I read somewhere memphis has a dynasty.
LeBron, not playing around… This was an absolute amazing game
Bye Grizzlies.. bet their fans are crying like babies.. them been humbled badly that they'd be eliminated in the 1st round
ja burat dance in the floor!😂😂😂
Yall remember when Jah said the only team he had to worry about in the playoffs were the Celtics?
8:31 UNBELIEVABLE
Released Payment's Money u.s.a Loan's
I wish Schroeder and D'Angelo would get a tech for flopping so much trying to fish for fouls. I don't know how refs can call a flop a foul but then miss when there is actually one. They are so inconsistent when making calls. Memphis got shafted when they didn't call the foul on Bane going to the basket, then the ball goes out of bounds and Lebron touched it but LA got the ball. Memphis could have gone up 9 at that point. The game was good but you can see the refs being biased, plus they are always looking to kick people out of the game. AD was great on defense but awful offense. Jackson was great protecting the rim also. Ja messed up getting those 2 offensive fouls going to the rim.
Lebron dropped a 42 On Legendary Dillon Brooks 22pts 20reb
Ja Morant hands down way better than LeBron James
Lmao turned on the TV to see the 4th qtr . Only to see trash laker flopping to get calls since they can't beat Grizzlies without any help. Can't wait until warriors get rid of them
GO LEBBBBROOOONNNN
Hate LA
Ayos team go lakers
rooting for lakers in the finals
"Morant tried to jump OVER Lebron James"
Man lebron needs to retire he looks and moves old liability on defense
Bron defense has been excellent!! People say Bron hasn’t played defense in long time! Then your not true fan of bron…. He does it when it matters most!….. playoffs is when it matters most!
And people say lebron not clutch. HOW!?!?
This game got DLo written Al over it 🧊
@ 7:35 😂😂 Ja Don't care who's under the goal LeBron just didn't wanna get dunked on lol
Let’s go Lebron
only lechock fans will talk about rebounds when it's only for lechock while they make fun of kobe in the finals game 7 lmao gotta love lechock fan base.
AD needs to play with some purpose that was pathetic.  Can't have LeBron or Reaves bailing him out
Lebron tied the game . He did not pass up the ball. Amazing!
What happens when an old bear sh*t in the woods??? He wipes his a*s with Dillion brooks
Nice game .very intense😮😮
Every basketball move Brooks does looks nasty af 😂
The block party is here🎉🎉🎉
Lmaooo what a great win for lakers. Memphis had no bigs..no adam..no Clarke.  This gotta be the easiest series yet. .
Yep. Unfortunately brooks poked the bear.....
LeBron is HIM
If russell did not made that 3 consecutive 3points i think lakers lose this games.and thank you to the goat who save and win the game. Solid lakers
Lany pasok nyo
🐐 performance from Bron! Tough buckets and plays down the stretch. I love the fire and intensity from the Lakers. Great Job AD, keep up the effort and tenacity!
Goodbye dillon ' the clown'!
LECLUTCH
Ja should add a floater to his game. He needs it fr fr.
Twas all DLO with the 3 3s straight to put the lead down to 1 and lakers back to life in the game.
This is so entertaining 😂
Dynasty boys😂
Its not really fine in the west 😂
From 15th spot now wiping grizzlies
LeBron is a freak of nature. How can he be this good for so long?
Feeling like the bubble year LGI NBA MOTIVATION 101
Mama😢 there goes that man 🔥
Nawala angas ni Brooks 🤣
omg lebronnn!!!
that 4th quarter was craaaaazy
Dilon Brooks punching the air right now
Grizzlies showed up with 3 ballers (ja,bane,jjj) and a ham sandwich(brooks) vs a whole squad and lethal bench. LeBron put his stamp on this series after a tumultuous year, signed it and delivered. Gonna miss that man when he retires
BROWNS MEXICANS NATIVE AMERICANS 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE TRUE HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE EARTH

I got goosebumps
LETS GO LAKERS💜💛SUPER INTENSE🔥🔥🔥🏀🏀🏀SUPPORT FROM🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
LEBRON GREATEST OF ALL TIME JAMES !!!!
Lakers play off experience
i see my juicer
“We not worried about nobody in the west” yea and now you bout to get bounced in the first round by a 7 seed🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Any Juicers?
Don’t like either team but man what a game🔥🔥🔥🔥
We up
NBA keep the vlogs coming let's go Los Angeles Lakers 💯💯💯👍👍👍
Mr George you are paying that guy too much money. Too small Mmmm salute King James 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Morant ready to sacrifice his life to score the ball hahaha😂
LBJ is not human❤❤❤salute to MR.KING of basketball❤❤❤
Fine in the west
we're not so fine in the west
Love it
LA Lakers leads 3/1   Boston Celtics leads 3/1 Miami heat leads 3/1 Denver Nuggets leads 3/1 🔥
2:41 hahahahaha
They not gonna win the championship but I can make a case for best team or most confident team lebron ever played on. Please don’t say Mike miler but has lebron ever had a confident role player to take and make those three consecutive threes like d Russ did? Has lebron ever had a teammate that can come off the bench like rui to give you 20?  Has lebron ever had multiple teammates who can create their own shot like Dennis AR and Druss??? Has lebron ever had a shot blocker who can also give you 20 points like AD? I don’t see them winning the ring but at least consider the points I’ve made
LEBRON STILL THE MAN IN LAKERS, GO GO NBA BROOKS, MORRANT DELIVERS FOR MEMPHIS WHAT A GAME
Dillon poke the Bear 🐻
The King👑 at 38 greatness
Lakers jersey
What a game 🔥 Lakers 💪👏
Lakers literally threw a block party 😂😂😂😂
LeGoat
Vintage lebron in playoff mode is something else 💯
I bet you Skip wild find something bad to say about Lebron smh.
Dapak this boy Ja, that is dangerous play man. hope he will play unhindered though.
Nice game
Keep poking the 🐻 brooks lol
Lakers really doin the ting. I hope for the last game LeBron actually drops 40 on Brooks to send him home.
Dayum lebron you was been supposed to do shit like that all season fr BULLY BALL
I will take old and experienced over young and naive any day. Bron is NBA with wisdom.  He deserves respect.
What a game it's like 90's more on physical that's why I LOVE THIS GAME!
Man these refs just want the Lakers going to the finals with Ledumbass's lanky jumpshot
I'm not a Lakers fan but go Lakers! shut those grizzlies up.😂
D Lo with three in a row clutch !!
This game is on fireee🔥
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED MAMBA MENTALLY SOLID LAKERS NATION 💪 LBJ 6 23 PURPLE N GOLD
Dylan dynasty Brooks taking hot L’s again
that half court shot from james tho
Brooks pinching air right now after getting scored on at the end
The refs didn't help either team Desmond bane is fr and that dunk by Ja before halftime is what we live for lebron with the game tying shot off a short window is greatness personified. Dillion brooks finally bringing his game and not just his mouth this is a memorable game. We beat them at there best. Let's go Lakers no doubt in my mind we would've been in trouble if Steven Adams was in the paint not our fault lol that Lebron shot probably don't go. Memphis  team is going to be scary when they get a bench scorer. And shout out to Dlo for coming back to LA and showing us what this team needed consecutive 3's made with the game on the line.
putang ina nyo mga hambog na Memphis grizzlies, lalo ka na brooks at morant... mga ulol!
Both games yesterday were crazy good.. and it’s only the first round ✅
but where tf was the foul at that last play? lol
How old is lebron Dillon? As Klay said Fucking bum.
Best game I’ve seen in years! LAKERS!!!👑
I keep forgetting how old LeBron is 😂
My man
Warriors, Leakers and heat have the best first round games.
Great game!
I will be there Wednesday…I love it!! Total team effort!
MORANt is so overrated is just a clown jumping on everybody
Let's not forget that lebron james is 38 years old, playing 45+ minutes in the playoffs and putting up 20 points and 20 rebounds. I am speechless. How is he human?
I hope Dillon respect Lebron now that he finally get the 40 he asked for. 20 pts and 20 assists 🔥🔥
Desmond bane is a top 5 2 guard I think he may be better overall player that impacts winning than Zach and brad respectively he a dog
I aint gonna lie, I spent the entire game watching Buddha and xqc courtside reactions
It's beyond ridiculous how bad traveling has gotten in the NBA!!!!!!! And the stupid three pointer celebration is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Young bloods now days celebrate everytime you make any jump shot. I was a big 3 point shooter back in my day and I never even thought about doing a dumb celebration after a 3 pointer I made. OMG!! What's next?
King James
Poke this, lil bitch..
Still think you fine in the west Ja?
damn. Really good team effort there by the lakers. Hope to see them in the finals once again
Crazy, la up 3-1 and Miami too, could be another we believe moment 😮
Honestly, Dillon Brooks is a child. I love this series.
I grew up in the Jordan times I'm 59 years old my children convince me you the goat it took time today you the goat 🐐  you the king
Of course the NBA wants queen James to win!! The Lakers shot 10 more free throws than Memphis did!!!! Live it up now Laker fans.. Suns going to give you a beat down next round!!!!!
Lebron the Goat but the older he get the more cocky and floppy he get … time to retire
Again lakers gave a panic attack
Done great 👍
Another very lucky W. First team to string together some decisive play will advance
I was wondering when D'Angelo what's going to go off 🔥
They need to pay bane he’s the one, scoring for the team and with defense morant gunna be a player who hurts himself long term because he wants every dunk to be a highlight
XQC near the grizzlies' bench is funny.
Bullshit
The league told ja we'll try again next year if you're behavior is better
Fine in the west yo mama
bron isnt human
DLo was clutch...Austin Reeves played like a  seasoned veteran, both teams played Defense really well, Desmond Bayne had an All Star performance. A fantastic game overall 👌
lakers will win championship because lulbron is the covid...
Lebron looked like Miami Heat Lebron.. Driving to the basket like a bulldozer. Hope he gets his 5 ring and retire happy.
“We good in the west” 🤡🤡🤡
Lets just hope anthony davis paper mache body holds up this off season 🤞....man hit ground like 3 times last night and was slow as hell to get up
Wish I was there…
Memphis cmon man down 3 to 1 after u spank em up all season They are a different team but still a beatable team
I gotta get my weight up more so I can experience this live! I know there's nothing like playoff basketball! 🔥 🔥 🔥
That was a great game
Now you don't underestimate Play-in teams.
I'm a Lebron hater but I hate brooks more so I am rooting for the lakers on this game 😂😂😂😂
It's over for the Grizzlies.  One and done
C lbj p rn ang hari ng NBA.
Where brooks now 😢
And everyone said that Bron isn’t clutch, that the Lakers are done… Lakers fooled everyone y’all, they were cooking all this time
FKN lit had me like 🤳😂💯
These commentators are so dry unlike the LAKESHOW . .
He's old, 🤣and fucking Great!!!!
Why does Ja think he can fly over players?🤣🤣🤣 Lakers more win to shut Memphis up for the rest of the postseason, after all, he’s fine in the West-NOT!🤫
Respect the greatest💪🏾
4:34 the dime to rule all dimes

This series and the warriors-kings series been fun to watch for me personally. Not one was boring
I'm find in the west 😂😂
Calling lebron the goat, Michael jirdan would never let it go to game 6 or 7.
At this point Ja is asking for a season ending injury. Trying to dunk on everyone for highlights is going to end his career early.
Im fine in the beach
Both lakers and Miami up 3-1 the heck is going on aren't Milwaukee 1st seed and Memphis 2nd seed?
That’s not Bron been clutch??
After the Lakers win this series I hope Dillon Brooks is man enough to apologize to Lebron for his foolish remarks that Brooks made about him earlier in this series.
Lebron sucks
Iss a parade inside my cityyy yeaaahh. Lakers nation stand up!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 let's go we going back to 2020😮
Both teams make me SICK 😝😝😝!!!
LeClutch with the game tying layup to end the regulation👑💛💜
I wonder if Ja is still good in the west😒
Best game all year. Magical
jjkk
Bron is a fuccin dog bruh
LB the best
DLo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
As usual cooking show
Time to close it out next game don't let them get up
Gandang laban solid talaga
bron be clutch
It's good to FINALLY to see LeBron doing what Jordan ALWAYS did in clutch PLAYOFF moments. What you saw last night Jordan was doing every night.
Incredible basketball being played in this game, and the last one too!
don't poke the bear.
Dlo was the unsung hero for this game.
This is classic vet team that's battle tested up against an up and coming talented young team. So far experience is helping the lakers this series
standing nila?
That offensive call the ref did on Morant when James was guarding him was crucial. Grizz would have won by an inch.
"Mr. I poke balls" has been quiet.
🙌🙌🙌
✊🏾 Lakeshow!
Lebron ain't clutch tho 😏
LeBron said this ja kid and Brooks have to go at all cost nobody ever thought to take a charge from ja the wild jumping ain't good land wrong it's over I wish that on nobody I watched Derick Rose get hurt love and Paul George leg live and it hurt to say glade they are all right but damn be careful
Lebron 👑
Iba talaga laruan sa play in
38💪
Now that's how you drive😂
Bru Shurder grab on the floor pass to AD was crazy! After Ja bumpd him stole the ball turned around to fast n lost it. I was like OMFG best play of the playoffs yet 😲🤯😵
King James 🔥🔥
We fine in the west my ass 😂😂😂
Didn't see the game live, but just from these highlights, sooo many blocks/rejections inside the paint on both sides, wowzer; defense wins championships
This game was 🔥...had to watch 2x!
i see my juicer xqc right there xqcL
For upset gogo Lakers and gsw
Ladies and gentlemen......Le🐐.
That quote by ja about not worried about the west didnt age well at all
As 31 year lakers fan  This game felt like  Showtime lakers
Dillon brooks: i poked the bears 🐻 😂
@9:20 he's old in not worried.....
I'm fine in the west
I gotta say, OLD man lebron is like wrecking ball in this game.
@9:24 Lebron really getting old man 😞 7 years ago he would’ve exploded past DBrooks and dunked over Tillman
The house that Vander built
🤝📈
Ja is still fine in the west with dynasty brooks
Thank God Wendy Gabriel hasn't played this series...
First the heat now the lakers taking down overated media hyped teams . Ja take your ball and go home and hold hands with your prison boyfriend Dillon brooks since you want to play gangster and see where you will end up
Dillon brooks literally gave the lakers motivation for no reason 😂 I hope the "clout" was worth it bro.
i love basketball so much i get giddy over shit like this😭
Yo?? Quick drops off one at 9:06 for all my 2k players 😂😂
galing nu lebron
I know the series isn't over yet, but didn't Ja say they were fine in the west 🤷
Russel,reeves and AD was carrying the team but lebron gets all the credit abd he is acting like it too lol
Thats a god damn great game
This was a block party game 🔥🔥
Laker fan here, but Desmone Bane might be a superstar.
I like how d Angelo plays great here but played like trash in Minnesota
Greatttt game!!
De-Low just shook a lot of people. He basically admitted this is all a simulation. Guys…I think we are in 2k ☹️
That was a really exciting game!
Boooooooo
Russell 3points made the tempo different
Great game man
Dillon Brooks gonna be serving sandwiches at my food truck this summer 🥪
Clearly D’Angelo Russell was in a “flow state”. Idk why but ever since game 3 I’ve honestly had some serious confidence in the lakers to go all the way which mind you I thought they were gonna be one of the bottom 3 teams. But now look at em. So much talent and chemistry. This is by far one of the best Lebron led teams. Top 3-2 for sure. Only thing stopping this from being 100% is injuries and Lebrons aging body. He is till the best player on the team just not as effective.
Hahahaha tanggal yabang ni dillon baog at ja burat hahaha
Exciting game!
LakeShow in 🖐️
monster james hahhaha
Idc if I had to sit in the rafters man this is one of them games you wish you was there 😳🔥
You want to King 👑 so bad Welp you got Him 😂
shout out Lakers haters 👋🤣
holy moly that 3 in a row by dlo and lebron scoring on dbrooks on ot 🔥 this lakers is so fun to watch they play gritty defense and working together as a unit !
what a team Lakers block!!!!!!!!!
Lakas ng Lakers 🎉
Labas mga lakers haters...in yours face...
I like how the officials just made them play and not call every move a foul. Let the boys fight to the end, like old basketball
Lebron🎉
2:01 Lebron so fast video looked speed up. goat
I wonder if ha is worried about the west anymore
Lakers Defense 💪🏻
That’s the dynasty, wow
I’m mad I fell asleep on this one😂
Wonder if Dillion brooks still thinks lebron dont got it😂
Wow it's happening just 1 more W and Lakers will advance to 2nd rd.  Great team W once again.  Tale of 2 halves for dlo.  I think he should start his offense inside out to overcome these slow starts.  Take more layups, floaters and even mid-range to get into a better rythem.  We r definitely in good shape.  But please don't let down ur guards, Lakers!
LeBron with a killer instinct is insane 😂😂
Bron showed the tenacity he had back in his first stint in Cleveland 👑
I'm not the biggest LeBron fan. Especially after he became a mouthpiece and useful idiot for the radical left agenda. I will admit. I like this Lakers squad.
#LakeShow Baby....
Lbj made that half court wow amazing game 🎉❤
Frfr LAL baby let's go 4-1 finish them boy's
Nice Lakers gogogo 4 the champion
Tanggal angas ng Memphis
Leplayoff
Never doubt the veterans' experience. There is a different atmosphere in the playoffs
Is Ja still not worried about the west?
All I can say is " LeOld" strikes again!
Dillon Brooks was like the 2023 version of when Klay was like "He got his feelings hurt" 😂😂😂 Ain't win a game since
love watching the Memphis trash get taken out. we good in the west alright.
Grizzlies: We are good in the West!!!😂
Still fine in the west?🤭
This shit rigged and AD and LeBron played hurt all season just so they could do this (Weak)
#2 gonna get bounced by a #7 lol. They are fine in the west alright
Brooks: "I poke bears".   LeBron: 👀
Man what a game.. Come on Lakers out these clowns out their misery
8:18 that dude with the black hoodie, below the court, had so much energy
Is no one gonna talk about how Desmond Bane looked back and intentionally hit Austin Reeves in the face? it happened during 99-99 tie score on the last 2:34 second in the 4th when Austin Reeves airballed a 3 point shot, then Ja Morant clashed with LeBron.  Grizzlies is a team with a bunch of dirty shtty players. They deserved to lose
Memphis Cubs are done done
So nobody gonna talk bout Brooks leaving and not shaking hands?😂  Y’all got a lot to say when Bron do it😂 NCAA right?
Holy shit that was some good basketball
come on now lebron clearly was on demon time he tied the game and nearly won the game with a half court shot
The king James made it look easy for a old man.
Goat James and Lakers... Pilon brooks shouldnt of poked the beargoat beast !
Morant is the truth better than I thought
That offensive fould Bron drew on Morant. That's just IQ. Knowing Morant was going to try leaping over him, thinking he could just jump over him from anywhere in the paint.
Yan ang tunay na the goat sa NBA 38 years old pero malakas parin hindi yung the goat nyo na 30 yearsold palang hindi na malakas
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... I CAN IMAGINE MANY BETTORS BETS HAVE BEEN SUPER FUCKED OVER. Gotta love sports and entertainment. The scripts are nice. Sandler couldn't have wrote it better.
damn giannis and ja got to come back 3-1
I'm fine in the west 😂
I was 12 when he got drafted. I'm 32 now. He's as old as some wars we're currently in. Think about that. He's like the Iraq or Afghanistan of the NBA.
Y’all can’t forget dlo he hit like 3 3s back to back
Old but Goat LBJ & LAKERS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lakers and lebron haters are crying rn😂😂😂
Hey said he was old then he got fried by lebron
if Kings and Grizzlies both lose it shows standings dont matter and to just coast through the regular season this puts the NBA in a bad situation. The suns are legit only up because PG and Kawhi were hurt but if they're healthy they likely beat the Suns.
sheeesh
"Ice in my veins!"
The Dillon brooks effect
Go Lakers
It's crazy to hear the Lebron haters criticize him as if he was still in his 20s. Talking about how he gets tired, or doesn't play tip top defense and etc. Yet dude is damn near 40 and  giving you 22p points and 20 rebounds. I mean come on, GOAT or not you have to marvel at what he is accomplishing at this age.
I'm fine in the west 😂😂😂
Amazing game for the black eagle...Morant just like Tora Tora plane.i think I watch a  NATO vs Russia fight a lot of explosions and gameness
HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER CALLED LEBRON OLD.  that added motivation of lebron may cost them the series.
That last play with Hachimura was a foul, got smacked by Tillman.
David is the  hero of this game, he blocked Morant in the last seconds
Nice game..m
Memphis Grizzlies fought hard. Don’t give up guys. Fight till the end.✊🏾✌🏾
What a performance of LBJ remember his 38 ❤❤❤❤
That fan in the black hoodie deserves season tickets he was goin wild the whole game 😂😂
Lol the d though
Let go laker
Old is Gold is real nigga
Old huh. The bum Dillon couldn’t stop the dagger
Memphis is that team now which everyone wishes to lose. They have to be grounded
LeBron getting blasted in the head and arguing the foul, then Morant on the other end falling on his hand shaking off the pain made me laugh 😂
Wow. Oldest player to have 20 points 20 rebounds. 💪💪💪💪 age is just a number
In the pabor of ref lol
As a fan of neither team and someone who has enjoyed mostly all the games this post season. This game was ass in the 3rd and early 4th. Poor refs killing momentum for both teams with inconsistent calls.. A point in time 20 minutes irl went by and only 3 minutes off the game clock.
This is the best defense all season 🔥🔥
This is the only way we gonna win
LETS GOOOOO LAKERS ❤️
Don't poke the Goat🐐
I always wonder why Lebron James got this huge amount of haters with his incredible performances. Specially on this particular game.
Wooooooh! 🔥
Amazing game!
hahahahhahaha goodbye memphis😢😢😢😢
Morant is not ok with in the west he had a fever
Western conference on fire 🔥 one of the most exciting games in NBA History by far
He should’ve kept his mouth shut!!!!
🦾🫶
LAKERS PICKING UP MOMENTUM, AND I CAN WHERE THIS IS GOING ,,,LAKER FUNS,  GET READY FOR IT,,,😊
Bitches gettin blocked again
You suck
These are the games that show how much heart this team has. If they beat the Grizzlies next game they move to favorite to win to me. 7 beating the 2 is unheard of. If it wasn't the Lakers they'd be losing their minds over this series. Go Lakers, yeah I think we're back.
Dynasty Brooks! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
8:29 that shot by LeBron holy shit that would've been crazy if it counted
Very frustrating that Memphis can’t win a single game. I think it’s because I want them to so they’re tossing so that I don’t get what I want.. loo
Lebron didn't to turn back the clock, he have the clock ⌚
somebody, I beg of you, please teach ja how to dribble w/o carrying every time
Dlo should have played ot but hey
I'm not used to seeing defensive plays on highlights but since it's the Lakers it all make sense smh what makes them so different 😡
Apparently someone's not fine in the west.
Nothing beats playoff basketball truly but damn Lakers fans , another heart attack ?  This might go down as one of the best 2-7 playoff matchups in a long time but like dang that’s insane
I'm lakers fan but the ref are always  on favor for lakers
Can’t believe I fell asleep. I missed a classic!!!! 😢
Let’s end it wed so we can get the rest we need for Golden State or Sac
the aqcuisition of Reeves,Vanderbilt, D'angelo, and Hachimura really made Lakers really strong..
Ja "Blow Job" Morant ain't fine in the west no more!
Ja "mr. Highlights" morant 😂🤣
Fans sitting courtside who insist on standing are complete asshats. 7:39
No hating shit but how did brooks really make the league
Dillon brooks no call at 2:46 smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
Yeah they are good in the west
Dude Ja might need to get seriously injured to learn his lesson. I hope he never gets hurt but man he just keeps doing the most tard things
Schroeder was ass tonight
*PLAY OFF MODE BRON*
L a k e r s  I n  5
I'm fine in the west🎉
Lakers d best
Dude they blew the whistle before LeBron James even went up and got touch. this b******* this is why I didn't watch the game cuz I know they're going to cheat for him the whole time he don't deserve the win they cheat for his ass the whole time it's not entertaining them dudes deserve to win they are better than the Lakers
Great GAME🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
It’s hilarious to see Al positive comments all the loser haters must have d in their mouths right about now
If only LBJ had a few more seconds to that beyond half court shot. Would have been the funniest and best way to end the game.
One of the most intense playoffs well played both team. LBJ👑🔥
Ja monster 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hilak brook
Great comback hard win.., great team effort.. the old man shows why he's the GOAT.
It will be interesting to witness Jah's development if he stays in the league for a longer period of time, but if he keeps jumping like that, he may be done sooner or later.
I'm fine in the west
Now where's the Haters? Why are they not Barking Right now? C'mon Do your Daily Jobs 😂 #patheticlife
LBJ Lebron "Burdagol" James
That and1 of bron makes brooks silent 🤣
no one talks.about de angelo russel. for back to.back 3's.
If the Grizzlies get gentleman swept, they have no right to talk anymore. Not only that, but they have to leave Memphis and relocate 🤣
Lakers got the best defense.
Impressive defence from Vanderbilt 💪🏼
Brooks : don't respect anybody until they give 40  bron: I'll give you 20+ pnts and 20 ribs that's 40
Crazy 38 yr old Lebron still way better than these dudes in their prime. Brooks has to sleep knowing he nobody compared to Lebron
Lebron the goat ya heard 😂
The block by Anthony Davis might not be the best block of all time but it def looks like the most satisfying😂
When AD & LBJ together go off & are both healthy together just forget it.
8:12 Lebron doing LeBron things
What a Game... 😍😍😍
NBA is rigged point blank period
Thank you Lakers -5.5  LBJ solidfan
Im surprised noone commented "Im fine in the West."
man I love watching grizzlies get crushed!!!!
Great game by Dlo finally hit some big shots Let’s Go Lakers
Let 'em play...🏀
looks like LL will take this series.... man MG were playing better last year compared to this year. if JM would get his act together and stop displaying weapons in videos and acting immature... then MG could probably win this series!
The king zone activated😮😮💪
Grizzlies’ Loser’s dynasty continues
3 back to back 3s from Russell 😂..
Cardio game till the end.
9:28 😈😈😉
LeBron is incredible. 20 rebounds. He may lead the league in every all-time stat before he retires.
It’s a miracle win by lakers as underdog as the analyst said ❤
Let's be honest. Russell was the reason...
This playoffs is really on another level lakers , heat and warriors/kings. Who will win it all?
ELECTRIC game. May just be the first round but the vibes are it. Lakers and Bron killing it, I just hope it keeps up till the later rounds.
KING doesn't look old to me...
Who really thought Bron was gonna lose in the 1st round
You have great players and then there is LeBron James. 20 years of dominance is not something any NBA player has ever done. When I first started watching the NBA T-Mac was my favorite player. I saw a rookie LeBron James go at that man like no other 18 year old could, to seeing a rookie LeBron battle it out with the Detroit pistons who were champions that year to Dropping 22 points grabbing 20 rebounds 7 assist 2 blocks and 2 charges in year mother effing 20.... amazing
Ja said he good in the west 😂😂
my juicer Pepega
Brooks really regretting calling lebron old 😂😂😂  Brooks is a total dbag.
Y’all think 38 is the end of the world when Lebron takes care of himself and most young Americans are plain ass fat ass. 😂 each some vegetables once in a while.
Lebron even on his walker can't be stopped by brooks.  lmao
The Lakers get a double digit free throw advantage almost every game....Memphis had more points in the paint than LA..NBA is rigged
What a fking game 🔥🔥🔥 don't sleep on those Lakers
I felt pity for the grizzlies, they’d a lot of shot blocks from lebron and AD. 😂😂😂
wow.lebron playoffs gaming
Great game Lakers...champ
I am a gsw curry fan but a part of me is rooting for lebron's ring before he retire ❤️ he deserve it
Fine If gaykers win against grizzlies, they cant stand against gsw lol Gsw will sweep gaykers since gsw have home court advantage than gaykers
Where is that dillon brooks saying they want the lakers so they can sweep them or something
That dlo 3 straight 3 pointers
Dillon Brooks to Dillon Broke real quick!
That boy Brooks poked the wrong bear  and now he can't help his team with his game
One hell of a block party the lakers put out for the gummies
Dillion Brooks runs lips so much he runs his lips more than he even plays also my defense is better than his, dudes defense is dog shit same with Ja once again all offense, not a single bit of solid or even tough defense that's why Memphis will never win a Chip they bums asf. King James is owning them.
Marlboro man over here
Dam actual blocks in a NBA game ...holy sht!
Not gonna lie I went to sleep when score was 97-90 thinking it was over for my Lakers... I woke up to take a leak checked the score and was shocked! 🤣😂👑
Thumbs up to the crowd out there in Los Angeles,California that attended that Los Angeles Lakers Home Game you all were totally awesome last night.
As much as I despise the *akers, I think the Grizz suck even more.
Contact before the Morant charge call could have been a momentum swinger in before OT. Referees swallowed the whistle.  On the other hand, Ja could Euro-stepped around James instead of making a highlight reel dunk.
“Fine in the west” my ass
Wow LBJ taking hard charges.  When ur leader is that unselfish, rest of team feeds off his leadership.
Dillon Brooks talking all that hot shit, LAKERS IN 5!!!!!!!!!!!! Lebron was cooking his ass.
Chill with all the lbj dih riding . Get of your knees n go shower fellas . Y’all seriously gay for lecap. Great job lakers , lbj just retire already , overrated fr and all these cringe ass comments praising a bald headed no hairline havin ass old man . All people 25 yrs and under just stfu
Labas kna
I personally liked all that noise of the crowd that was awesome to motivate the Los Angeles Lakers.
BIG buckets by Bron and D Lo late.
3:34 Lol. Ja contemplated his future on that play. Edit: I take that back. Can't believe he just went at it again on 7:23. Haha!
Morant is overacting trying to take over in results turnover and wasted position.. chill bro chill..
Dillion brooks is to blame for them bout to go home   Sometimes you just gotta stfu 😂😂😂
the petty clap by diangelo at the end was good for my heart
The NBA Playoffs are must see T.V. these games are great!  NBA is Amazing
DLO WITH SOME CLUTCH 4THQ B2B2B 3's!!
That’s that good Defense!
Lebron like old man my azz😂 watch this! Lol
as usual the Lakers got the benefits of the calls and the grizzlies got hosed
Lebron further solidifying himself as one of the best playoff performers. What a bucket at the end of regulation
I'll say it, this is turning out some of the best basketball I have ever seen, and I have been watching since '77. These Lakers look awfully Good, so do the Grizzlies! Ja needs to stop jumping so high, he's going to end his career as we know it, just ask D-Rose(who still is in the league)even after all these years & one of my all-time favorites). The Lakers Show has returned!!!
That was so exhilirating! Everyone had clutch defense & game deciding shots! DLO with 3 big 3's, Schruder with crucial steal, AD blocks, Austin Reaves with clutch drives and 3's, James with the similar Jordan 4Q clutch layup vs Utah '96 finals except that it was more clutch because of the ball spin. Whoo!
Cardiac game!!!
Lebron has entered BEAST MODE
They were letting them play till the end . Like always
LEBRON IS BETTER THAN #KINGMORANTGOAT
Remember when Klay made the "got his feelings hurt"  statement. Lebron went on god mode, so you already know what to expect vs the Grizzlies lol
That was a hell of a game! Lebron is a such a legend man, the guy can straight up ball and bring the intensity
Memphis they are just a good Dancer not a good Player hahahaha.....
when overtime is coming LAKE SHOW is dominating
7:44 Austin Reeves really want the ball. Like fr fr. Big stage. First playoffs. This guy is fearless.
yo XQC!!
Can someone tell Le pink skirt and pocketbook that he has to win 4 games before celebrating
Ja saying he wasn't worried about any other team in his division and now they are 1 lost away from getting eliminated in the first round 😂
Where the Juicers at
If beasly,  dlo and brown are consistent and coach ham using Walker and other bigs to get their confidence. I think this lakeshow will be deep and scary
Lebron really built different
It’s funny how lakers play this aggressive on teams who they know they can beat but when it’s comes to teams like clippers with Paul George & Kawhi Leonard they NEVER play like this… keep that same energy when you play skilled teams too 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Say what you want but the Western Playoffs (specifically Lakers/Griz & Kings/Warriors) has been amazing! The east has been boring outside of NY finally being good again.
Dillion Brooks should’ve never said Lebron is old 😂
One knows when one is "witnessing" greatness! Any further questions?
where is the dynasty in the making lol😅😅😅
Man I knew the grizzlies wouldn't beat the Lakers because of how matchups work. Nothing against the grizzlies. But if the Lakers lose the next 3 games it will be the greatest stain on LeBrons legacy
Brooks wanted the king, he got the King
I thought LBJ is old but Dillon can't keep up
👑
I'm fine in the west tho 😂
I'm LMAO at the Ja Morant Butt Fumble near the end. Essentially depicting his clown of a season.
Apparently the top teams ain't the top teams 🤔
AR15 With a pinoy steps
🔥🔥🔥
Lebron may not be the best player ever....there are quiet a few ahead of him. But, he is the fittest player and no one comes close. The man is built with dedication and focus.
im fine in the west
how was that not a foul at 2:47
Yessssss💜💛
Bro the grizzlies were getting away with so many calls and the lakers still won! Good shit guys!
I wonder what Brooks has to say after this game
Grizz look lost whenever it’s clutch time 🤣🤣🤣embarrassing
And they hate on Lebron dumb as ppl
Big respect to ja morant. He did his very best
The king👑
respect what bron is doin but wondering what would happen if brandon clarke and steven adams was healthy
Party block hhahha
That’s what happens when you’re soo young and fools
The Lakers had me worried, once again. They played well in the 1st half, but then they  seemed to get the jitters and made costly mistakes. They missed two layups. They kept bricking 3 pointers instead of just shooting mid-range shots. AD couldn't score any points for quite a while. And refs didn't help the situation with their fishy calls. I'm glad they won, but they're gonna have to play much, much better if they want to win the West. I expect AD to score at least 20 points per game.
Vanderbilt is a life-changer!!
Remember this article ”Ja Morant Says Memphis Grizzlies Have No Competition In Western Conference"?
What now Dillon Dynasty brooks? Still fine in the west Ja?
Hahaha.. kawawa bojong Morant.. 😂
Ja Morant is starting to look ridiculous
Whoa Ang lakas ni King LBG
💜💛💪🏾💪🏾💯😬😲 we really might can make a run.   As long as AD & Bron can stay 🤫🤞🏽🙏🏾
Despite turnovers huge win
Morant  almost injured himself  again
I thought they said lebron wasn’t clutch tho 🤔 😂
Dillon got the bear And the bear won 🐻
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡
Mmm Memphis is ass.  😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who wants a miami lakers rematch
LeBron making that crazy contested layup to tie the game was nuts.
Never fails with the NBA. Lakers have been bad all year yet towards the end of the season they start to get more free throws then their opponents all over sudden they became good. The Only League where they can fix their outcomes the Mavs ,Lakers.
He wanted james he gets him!
9:27 Dillon Brooks: "Lebron is old"
am i surprised? no cuz the grizzlies suck and with out there big man they suck even more should’ve swept that garbage none of these games should’ve been any type of close
Lebron😈😈😈😈
Lebron bullied brooks
Goat shit damn 🪫🔋 old man can play
Reason why grizzlies doesnt have a chance against lakers coz the offense circles around morant only Look how ballhog he is.
Everyone Who's Not A Lebron Fan: - You know, that guy is pretty good. Also everyone: Wait... he's almost 40?
Lebron dialed in his inner Dirk Nowitzki with that lay-up to force OT.
Sorry youngins
LeBron redeemed himself with that last second bucket. The goat does what the goat wants
5:39 was three steps after the gather step he literally went from 3 to the hoop without dribbling
It’s a block party at L.A 🔥🔥
just barely pulled it off to bad lebron didnt get it again in groin he s   ks   and davis even worse paper i mean shaun may paper  soft sissy somebody please
Guy in the black hoodie in front seat!!😂😂
The king!!!!
Gotta give it to the Lakers, man. If you had told me mid-season that they would be playing this well leading up to, and during, the playoffs, I never would have believed you. Absolutely wild.
xqc just chilling courtside is so funny to me love that guy
What happen to rui and Ad they didn't make a lot of points... again coach didn't try to put thompson in the game
vando after scoring 10 points in first quarter then limit his time for 20 minutes 😂?
Mama, there goes that ("old") man!
I guess trash talk ain't working so well for the Grizzlies.
whoo another no show from ad
lakas tlaga ng lakers sobra💪
LeBron be like Whos Old now?
still gets career high stats at year 20...what the actual freak
Lebron is a beast at 38
Ja Morant still fine in the west.. 😢😅😂
Ring 5 otw 🐐
how is Morant shaking his " injured hand " after falling  .. so ridiculous..
YEAR 20 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 🔥🔥🔥
Lecap owns brooks 😂
Morant is an idiot. With a broken hand he's still jumping over people like nothing, and miserably falling down. He's gonna regret this immature attitude towards his body one day.
dillon brooks no where to be found
7:30 LeBron was like you dumbass 😂😂
You can tell bron isn’t the same player he used to be even 4 years ago but he can still tap into that spartan rage from god of war and will the team
Yt @R3drum2x
Ano na mga yabang?
A play-in team. Won the play-in tournament. 7th in the ranking. About to eliminate 2nd ranking team.  Insane. 🤯💀
Regular season basketball sucks but the playoffs are great
2:21. Worth a second look.
And Dillon Brooks' mouth shuts down . . 😂
Lebron almost end up in the blue bird app
What a great start by JV and clutch threes by D'Lo
Now Memphis has to play like 2016 cavs to come back that 3-1 lead. But i doubt it 😂
Spot the juicer speedrun
XQC L
They had to Get this win for my birthday 💯let’s Gooo lakers in 5🤧
I don't know how but I love the Lakers team ....great game☝️🤣
D’Angelo needs to get started in the 1st quarter and this team is damn near unbeatable. Kept us in the game at the end.
travel in the last 48 sec at the regulation
Thank you DLO
Both lower seeds up 3-1, I feel like the bucks could force game 7, where I don’t think Memphis will. But we shall see
Something is telling me Ja isn’t safe in the West😂
Lbj played tremendously
So.... he slows down @9:03 to try and get the recovery block, but Brooks dunks it...why does James look at Riu like it's his fault. He shouldn't have slowed down to try and get the spectacular block...  He should've run in front and stopped the ball...but that's the "goat" blaming his teammate for his lack of defense? 🙂🙂
One of LeBron's best games
THE KING 👑 THE GOAT 🐐 THE CHOSEN ONE THE MVP THE CHAMPIONS THE BEST PLAYER OF THE IN NBA LEBRON JAMES LOS ANGELES LAKERS FOR THE CHAMPIONS THE SCORING MACHINE LEADERS!!!!! 🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
Mutombo finger wag okay now lake show 😂😂🎉
20+20 you got your 40 Brooks
Like I said if these lakers keep showing up ain’t nobody beating these lakers
Ja Morant sentence is LIE, he's not okay at WEST 😅
Why did they bench D'Angelo in OT tho? I think D'Angelo is much better than Schroder.
Ja was so lucky that Lebron was under him when he took that flight late in the 4th quarter, it could've been a season ending injury on the hips for him. He gotta control himself when he plays or he'll end up like the great Derrick Rose 2.0.
Missing you in Cleveland right now LBJ😢
Brooks:"...he's too old" The universe: 9:20
With 23 points, Austin Reaves was the leading scorer for the Lakers, but these highlights only showed three of Austin's buckets.  Fucking insane.  Give some love to this white boy.  Jesus!  When Reaves (or anyone on the Lakers) scores, it's like Lebron doesn't even give-a-damn.  I know that Lebron is great, but he seems to shit-on his teammates.  James has always seemed like a basketball-snob to me, even when he was an 18-year-old-rookie with the Cavs.  Just show your fucking teammates some love when one gives you a good pass.  Is that too difficult to do?  For the record, I want to write that Michael Jordan has the highest PER (Player Efficiency Rating) in the history of the NBA.  That right there statistically proves that MJ is the GOAT.  Lebron has the third highest PER in the history of the NBA.  I'm not here to bash Lebron.  Like I said, Lebron is great!  And, Lebron does a lot for poor folks, especially within the Black Communities of America.  Nevertheless, Lebron's on-court-personality just rubs-me-wrong.  Jordan always encouraged his teammates, even though MJ saw them as sorry asses.  Hey? When you are that great, you do look-down upon others who are no where as great as you are.  However, MJ did not show-up his teammates, at least no during a game when there is a national TV audience.  MJ showed-up his teammates in practice, behind-closed-doors.  Not only does MJ have the highest PER in the history of the NBA, but MJ was so beautiful to watch.  His basketball aesthetics were like watching a basketball god.  Lebron is bulky and moves awkwardly.  Lebron's basketball aesthetics are like watching a machine play.  Who-the-fuck wants to watch Chat GPT play basketball?  For those here who hate me for writing these basketball truths according to my basketball understanding, I apologize in advance, but Lebron on court personality pisses-me-off.  Delbert Blanton.  Kokomo, Indiana.  Old white man, player and lover and watcher of basketball for 50 years.  (Didn't read-over this closely for typos.)  Oh, Austin Reaves Dad is from Kokomo, Indiana.  Maybe our shared Kokomo lineages is why I see Reaves getting disrespected; but my god, he just was the leading scorer in this fucking thrilling NBA playoff game, but no one in the comments seem to even have noticed Reaves' 23 points which were the highest of all the Lakers, including Lebron.  Greatest players from Kokomo, Tico Brown, Jim Ligon, Jimmy Rayl, and now Flory Bidunga.  Go Kats!
I told ppl that no one wants to see a healthy AD and Bron lakers team in the playoffs bruh. Say 7th seed on you want but if not for that 2-10 start lakers would be a 3-5 seed at least. They’ve been playing like a top 5 team in the west since November and I warned ppl this isn’t the same team as last season but hey 😂
Time to collect Baby ❤go Lakers Kobe would be proud
Memphis maybe should foul lebron james on that last possession before ot because he will miss his free throws for sure.
King James is still strong and good, because only a buffalo gets old. 💪❤👑
GOAT
Morant block by Davis....poster blocked😂🎉
Unbelievable at age of 38.
This was absolutely vintage James jfc
Good luck Griz. Bron reached this far in year 20, there's no way he will blow a 3-1 lead which he never did.. The universe just sent the right people to humble the grizz no matter how much we wanted the grizzlies-warriors match up, i think the lakers are the best team to humble them down.
I like the Lakers but as a Suns fan,don't wanna play em,would much rather play them Fake Thugs on the Grizzlies but Ja cursed Memphis thinkin they "fine in the West"🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
Ja -im fine in the west  Brooks - we are a dynasty  Bout to exit the playoffs from the first round ..xd
At 38 still young players have their biggest challenge as LeBron. Dillon Brooks learnt a big lesson. He said he was not as good as he was before.. still ends up with 20-20 game...
Weird seeing xqc in an NBA game. Lmfao
Greatest basketball player ever, he doing it at 38 just blows my mind. Appreciate greatness.
Atleast davis didnt foul morant by the end of regulations
Big Guy-👑
Brooks will soon be eating crow
Lebron had the loudest 22 points I’ve ever seen seriously 😂😂😂
Goat 🐐
go ginebra
In my hometown   We have a saying And we say  The ball don’t lie   So if somthing happens and u get the ball back and get the point then it was meant to be  Bc the ball don’t and doesn’t lie  Idk 🤷🏾‍♂️   It’s just a saying we have in   A.c
Can we start handing out flags for that dirty shit these players been doing lately. How THE HELL can a defensive player establish position at the last possible second right before an offensive player goes up for a layup or dunk, and get an offensive foul????? And also what prompted the terrible reffing this game?? The calls this series haven’t been too bad aside from those charge calls, but all of a sudden y’all are long whistled and are letting the players play on after clear fouls??? But LeBron gets a petty call late in the game on a bump from brooks???? Get out of here!!
I love to watch D' angelo for being consistent in scoring..insane beyond the arc
I'm not even gonna be surprised if Ja will not play next game. Dude literally became the "basket ball" by dribbling himself on the floor.
Grizz about to be eliminated. All because ja said he was fine in the west😂
Did Ja really want to do a Vince Carter on that french dude to LeBron?
I remember Ja said " Im fine with the West 😂😅😊
Kobe MJ fan probs to Lebron for playing like 28 years old in his prime surely he one of the greatest
I thought King James would hit a buzzerbeater 3 but Deym! That clutch lay-up in last 6 seconds to OT was insane!
He's old huh?
Whoohooo at least the Warriors have home court advantage against the Lakers!!! Memphis at the 2 seed bounced!! Hahahaha
Hey Brook how's that 40
PLAYOFFS BRON IS ACTIVATED 🐐🔥🔥😍💪💪💪
Damnnn we must appreciate the hustle of Schröder as always!
Russell is garbage.  He got lucky with the late 3's but he is shot happy and misses more than he makes.
Ahh...is this basketball or volley ball😂❤ purely shot blocks😂💪🏻😱😎🎉 nasty😂❤
Are they still fine in the west?
Y’all be noticing how Dillon brooks always trying to avoid those interviews now 😂😂
Nice Game Thank you lakers Congrats for The  2022/2023 NBA seasons
Shout out to Dillon Brooks mann so inspirational.... i mean wow jus wow the motivation this man has been for the Lakers 🔥💯
Yaaassss! All the best LAKERS! Continue to strive hard to get the Western Conference Finals Champ! 💜💜💜
Better quit calling Bron old. Poking the bear has never worked and Brooks looks like a 🤡 now.
What a game. Well deserved for arrogant memphis boys. Hope lakers get this series done
Great edge of the seat type game. Good performance out of both teams. JA is definitely looking like prime D rose out there!
watch your balls lakers =)
“we are fine in the west”
Good game
Dlo came through BIGGGG Before fouling out.. that boy cold!!
Am I the only one that wants to see bron and Jimmy go at it again In the finals
Lakers 2023 nba champion mark my work
The man is a machine! At this age...come on..get that man tested. 💪🏿
Lakers is back ❤❤
Wat a game...go to champion la Lakers gogo to champ.
Brooks makes look like sad boy hahaha
LeBron James is one of the most Clutch Playoff performers of all time. Only casuals think otherwise that don't know jack shit Oh and all LeBron haters are losers that can't even play IRL so in the end who cares what any of them say or think.
Nice game Lakers
I love the laker. But yo thet little niga JM a beast frfr bc he really playing with a broke hand  I feel as tho it’s broke and they not telling nobody bc he wanna keep playing to win for them. Much respect for little Brah
GOAT King James 🎉🎉
That AD layup at 8:41 was crazy
This is so amazing it brings tears that someone called Lebron old.
When someone is hot, Lebron makes sure he gets the ball, Game 1 was Reevees, tonight was Russell... Legoat! lol
Damn dlo on the Lakers is clutch as hell
That's what they call him King James better be scared a king 🤴 😆
Lebron the real goat
Grizzlies just too small for LA, Steven Adams down low really is a massive part of their identity..they fighting, but it always feel like its LA's game to lose
xqcL
Take the charge away????? Wym ja goes out of control it’s HIS OWN FAULT LOOK AT THE REPLAY HE SEES IT AND TAKES IT ITS HIS FAULT
xqc lookin like a lesbian npc in the crowd
Lebron been doin this since I was 6 bro this ain’t new. He been on this 😂
That was a good game dlo man 🥶
Grandpa LbJ still got it ..nice game by Russell ..solid defense by Lakers..
Too many fouls call this game in favor of leflop king james
AD the alternate talent is non existent in this game. So expect him to ba a beast in Game 5
All day waiting to watch this... Thanks
And class this is why you don’t talk $H1T to Lebron James 😂🤣 that game winner on him was everything
Lakers sakalam..
LET'S GO LBJ!!! 🔥🔥💪
Bron is a goat
goodjob
No one can't beat King James he's the best NBA player right now stop missing with him don't get King James hot you too easy for him thanks hhhh
Ja don’t learn. Keeps driving to the basket like a maniac.
CONGRATULATIONS MGA KA LAKERS
Dawg da lakers got the best defense in the whole league rite now
The ja chest bump with his dad damn near brought a tear to my eye 🔥🔥🔥
what a fn game
Its brook fault. Poking old bear lol.. they should foul james on the last possesion b4 driving the basket & leave it at his freethrows.. maybe just maybe
Bitch ass Memphis such a joke nba team.
XqcL
🤡james.
Hi
Haters: Lebron ain't clutch
Now that’s an fuc*^$n game!
This kids got humbled by an old man
Let's go Lakers
LAKERS ALL THE WAY!!!💜💛
Lebron is the worst thing to ever happen to the NBA.
GoodGame both team ,Congrats my team lakers ,continues workhard for final no to injured for championship❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏
The Lakers size is giving memphis alot of problems. Having AD, Bron and Rui on the floor is a nightmare. Ja morant was 8-24 from the field and only scored 19 pts. Thats not gonna get it done for memphis. Looks like memphis is just very good during regular season. Lakers in 5.
Nothing beats playoff basketball, the intensity, the emotions, the high level of play, top teams duking it out like their lives depend on it, doesn't get any better than this 😊
Yeah he definitely getting traded
just wow
Bron Bron baby let’s gooooooooo
I was 10 yrs old when lebron enter the  NBA and now im 31 , i cant believe at his age he can dominating the game . Salute
Lakers should have lost the game if the referee called a blocking foul by a moving lebron instead of an offensive foul on Ja Morant before the end of regulation. Lebron should be thankful to the referee
When i saw brooks guarding lebron in OT i knee it wasnt gonna end well for him..and 1
36 points on bane all goes in vain..lebron cooks the crook brook..
Dunk @ 5:41 was too nasty 😤💪
The "old" man KICKS THEIR AZZ AGAIN!!!
Embarrassing for the grizzlies. 2 seed for what??
DILLION BROOKS GOT THAT 40 PIECE HE WAS ASKING FOR 😮‍💨
🐐
dillon brooks on james. haha! what a joke
Aye Ja fine in the west 😂
U got what u wished for brooks
id walk james down all day
Block party
Damn, these Playoffs have been mad exciting🔥 I can't believe LeBron is playing this dominant at his age. Like it or not, he is the GOAT🐐
8:29 xqc in the front row near "playoffs" jumping up and down   ANY JUICERS
My god they played bully ball on a cocky injured morant.  this is over lebron has that look
Brooks "I wouldn't mind playing LeBron (James) in a seven-game series,"
Adam Sandler ❤
Why lebron always the thumbnail for all the laker games
5th ring 💍 on da way
LeBron and Russell 🙌
Lakers ain't finna lose 3 straight Grizzlies season is approaching it's end
lebron is done. grizz in 7
It's that L.A LIFE...... GO LAKERS 💪👍💯💥🏀🗑️🙏🏆🥇
Dillon : I don't respect no one until they come and give me 40.  Lebron: 20 pts + 20 rebounds = 40  plus winning the game😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the OLD is dominating
Laker Fan In The House:"First Off I Owe Everyone An Apology About My Last Comment On The Last Game Thinking Grizzlies Were Gonna Make A Come Back, and Tbh From The Looks Of It This Game Was Extremely Scary And As I've Said Before It Doesn't Really Matter Who Has The Best Winning Record Or Seed Number The Main Key To Advance In Championship Is Defense."
JA trippin so much they lose the game
8:45 bro what? Love this
brooks really said that man is old. 😭
Brook, need yo talk to Media 😂😂😂
Imagine there was more time on the clock when ad blocked mordant and Lebron’s shot counted. That would be the best ever.
Wow what a great performance for LAL .. this is good in 2nd round
D russ saved the day shooter
That's what the hell I'm talking about Lebron stop settling for the stanking ass 3& drive ur butt to the rim at the END of regulation
Thank you 👑   What a classic finishing
Bane dont need to force inside, his a good shooter
Lbj the goat!!!! Playoff mode.😊
memphis on a brink of elimination, clearly no 7 is greater than  2
D-Loading was cooking with that hat-trick from beyond the arc…  That basket by LeBron, with 6 seconds on the clock… insane!
Ja: I'm fine in the west 🤣🤣🤣
The NBA should be worried about these dudes  SHEESH!
There are certain players that you should avoid provoking.
Dillon Brooks, you really ain't that guy
good game
the game play by play comentator sounds like hes on his last leg ; lol
Look at what dilion did bro the entire lakers team started clicking immediately after he started talking
That game was absolutely fantastic
Bout time! Lebron took it in with game on the like in critical game .
Man what a game
Goat James still playing like he’s in his prime at 38. Amazing!
LeBum is LeBitch. End of story.
What a fucking game.
Ja’ really the first nba player who wants to be out of the league in his early career 😂😂😂😂
getting cooked by a senior citizen
Lol xqc
When LeBron take it hole he should yell, "YALL TOO YOUNG"!!
Why is no one talking about how horrible ja played in the clutch and just in general in this game?
I was seeing a block party at the first half. Good win by the Lakers. Let's get it on game 5 🔥
This is the reason why lebron james known for clutch in every single games !!!
Lebron is the goat after this one did y’all see the shot he made at the end of the 4th quarter it ain’t count but damn
GSW FANS !!!! WHERE COMING HAHAHHAA!
jarred blocks are insane man
Bricks to Lebron: he's old. Lakers: 3-1 😂😂
I'm fine in d west......by ja Morant
who tf you calling old mr brooks? haha
Lol brooks not talking no more and dlo made those great 2 3s that the lakers really needed badly ! Let’s goooo lakers ! And if bron didn’t make that layup off the glass then the lakers would have lost and Dennis got that saved ball and Davisgot the bucket and the lakers just need to cut the turnovers! Davis didn’t have that much impact the whole 3 quarters but the 4th he stepped up! And Dillion wanted brooks grizzlie fans yall trash team all talk 🗑️🗑️have fun when y’all are eliminated!
anganda nang laban
Dillon brooks is an idiot, he reignited Lebron hahahaha
For the first time , I seen the MAMBA MENTALITY in Lebron on that last And 1 💯 if he plays with that mindset he’s unstoppable
Lakers is fine in the west.😁Where dillon at? he too quiet.
That 1v1 with brooks was crazy he really got outplayed by an old man 🤣 can’t be that old
9:34 EPIC
Brookkss where are you now? You want Lakers? Ok this is for you., Morant im not fine in the west😅
Man the lakers played pretty good in the last 2 minutes of the game, in OT the lakers played way better and The starters scored important shoots to win the game the grizzlies are done they to small and they play no defense ...a play in T was a good therapy for the lakers in 1st round and 1 more game to advance to the SF and grizzlies are fading away I think lakers will seal the deal in memphis or At the staple center in game 6..
No one gonna talk about lebron shot lol goat
I'm Done with the west, He's in the East nxt yr hahaha
Strength in numbers 😂
same as miami and bucks hahahaha
Not bad for an old guy huh
wow wow woowwww amazing Lakers 🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏🙏
Morant Once said He's not worried about nobody on the West & Dillon Once said Bring on the Lakers
Wow another deserving loss for the imaginary die-nasty of brooks hahaha rejoice rejoice!!!
Im fine in the West.
Dynasty my ass
Lakers should bring in George Mumford to work with Davis.
Lebron is doing it
I see the 2203 playoffs are already decided by the Jews.
Salute to ja. What an absolute effort on the court, James the kings showdown at 38 is insane!!!
Lelethimcook❤
Low seeds are tough against high seeds Mia up 3-1 against bucks Lakers 3-1 against grizzlies Nyk 3-1 against cavs
Awesome game💪🏿LAKERS IN 6
Ja Morant is okay in the West and is ready for early vacay.
Jabron Lames!!!  In my coolest Dave Chappell/  Rick James voice ☘🖕☘ Shit was a good game though.
No doubt about it!  This game solidifies LBJ's GREATNESS, ABOVE ALL OTHERS!  Truly the GOAT!  HAIL TO THE ZEUS OF BASKETBALL!
this is still the FIRST round of the playoffs!
Just remember everyone. Skip will say this man ain’t clutch 😂
Straight to the rim lil kid lmfao 🤣 😂 38 years old just moving mfs out the way
Morant makes some stupid decisions. Why try to jump over James when you have player open  next to you for easy flush.
Lebron is the best,.
It's funny that Grizz wins games without Ja Morant 🤣
Them boys hoopinnnn 😮‍💨
Kudos to the LA team. It's a collective effort for their homestand💜💛
He's fine in the West though.
That’s a lot of 2nd chance points from MEM tho.  LAL needs to grab those.
The moment that bron gets the half court shot makes me shout "ALL HAIL TO THE KING!!"
Trade Morant! He's just a role player, useless...
Shouldn’t have poked LeBear 🐻
💜💛LAKER FAN UNTIL THE COFFIN CLOSES!👉LET'S GO LAKERS!☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️
Jimmy Butler and Lebron James with their playoff mode activated. Wish they could face each other again. It's been a long time.
i dont think brooks should mention how old lebron is again
Do yall remember when le'crybaby said the play in was stupid? Funny how the Lakers would not be in the playoffs without the play in tournament
All that talking just to be out in the 1st round.😂😂😂
“I’m fine in the west “
what a game
Lebron was fouled way b4 the shot wtf is going on 🧐
LoL,!! jah wants to fulfill his dream to dunk on lebron's face😅😅 too early my guy👌👌 that is playoff lebron hail to the 👑👑👑
imma die hard laker fan.....but at 99/99......i feel like lebron knew ja could have got really hurt on the offensive foul.....both were out for blood but i think lebron being older should have been more careful with the youngin
xqcL
9:35 peso pluma
LeBilliGOAT clutch
I’m a huge ass LeBron hater but god do I hate Memphis 20x more
Lebron a savage
What a game, was truly an honor to witness this live
Wow
nice the king is back👑👑👑
that right there is the greatest player of all time
Refs really let them play 🙏🏾
Don’t fuk wit da goat
LeBron is Him 🐐
He getting another ring
When Lebron scores in 9:20 , the way he celebrates it with Davis in 9:30 is just pure badass. 🔥
WOW!!!....
"Dynasty"  Ok bud...
87 heart attacks lakers in 5 tho
20 Rebound 😂 wtf
Dillon Brooks had Lebron one on one and got bullied in OT😅😅😅
Who else nba players can play that level at the age of 38? Dont tell me your 90's goat can do that.
Thst block by davis on ja at the end of regulation was just filthy. Get thst weak stuff outta here lol. Straight rejected.
where is my brooks? what happened dude to his memphs dynasty? or it had become die nasty...when too much ego and pride go above the head; often, the resulting end will catch you like a wave rushing the sea shore and washes away any trace of previous marking. the grizzly vicissitudes...ouchh!! 1 more, game is over. is memphs like okc during kd/rw/jh....young talents but in vain???
Of course most clutch playoff player Lebron gonna go crazy at crunch time. Goat.
AD told Ja eat that shi 🗿
Lebron and Kobe in 1. Mamba mentality unleashed!
But i thought Ja said the grizzlies were fine in the west? 😂🤡
This game was so good I saw it live and I still wanna see the highlights
how tf is brooks gonna sleep tonight
What a game!!
JA MORANT SAID  IF FINE IN THE WEST 😆
The Lakers played so will
Woody absolute team effort by the Los Angeles Lakers they defeated the Memphis grizzlies and overtime the defense by Anthony Davis and LeBron James was phenomenal fans love those blocks shot and Jarred Vanderbilt did a absolutely amazing job on containing ja Morant and D'Angelo Russell with the three straight 3-pointers in the end of regulation was mind-bending what a great basketball game and kudos to the Los Angeles Lakers for a absolutely amazing victory 💯🤔💡🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀💯✔️👍👍👍👍👍💯
It's pain seeing LeBron perform as a Jordan fan 😅 guy breaking all the stats
Was it just me, or did this game feel different? The excitement and tense in this game was at an all time high.
There goes the old man 👍
LeGoat👀🔥🐐👏🏿
So many blocks
Is Dynasty Brooks talking now?
PARADE INSIDE MY CITY 🎉
Do you guys genuinely believe they are going to move on from Dillion brooks after this playoff series if they lose..? Do you think that the grizzly’s actually don’t like him anymore..?
What happened to “WE FINE IN THE WEST”?
memphis is gonna win at home.  We all know that now, because they almos stoled this game... both teams was getting lucky plays.  I mean this the playoffs... but i just personally feel that the Lakers 💫 needs to control the ball more. Because they could easily won this game better if they would  had not committed to many turnovers
An aggressive downhill lebron I will be very very concerned right now if I was the grizzlies.
LeGOAT
Laker fans are gleeful today!
🐻 Stop playin wit Bron Top ☠️
xQc was biting his nailssssss
Haters or not, you have to respect how LeBron is still performing as such a high level let alone playoffs at that age. Even Kobe (R.I.P) only had reached age 34 at being consistent.
Those PED's are keeping James in top condition.
im expecting druss to made a great show every game, and i love to see play in team in the finals... miami vs lakers🤭🤑🤑🤑
We fine in the west
Vando has a good 1st quarter run. D.lo catching fire in the 4th. And of course LBJ finally taking over after letting his team run the show. #LBJnotendofera
Took me 2hr watching highlights tonight.
8:09 LeBron 🐐💛💜
Brooks silence since game 1
I'm glad we got the W!! But an anthony Davis sighting late in the 4th into o.t. is unacceptable. Shay sharpe " ad will give me 35 and 17, then turn around and give me 12 and 11". D lo was clutch!! If he doesn't hit those, Lakers were done
everytime AD fallen to the floor , everyone heart stopped for couple seconds, but it's been a mircle he hasn't got hurt . that was a very excited game, hopefully the lakers keep pedal to the metal.
Russell won the Game on those 3 three point shots down 7 points & if James doesn't go down the court as he didn't go back to play offense he is the only reason as he slid over Ja.Morant was fixing to go over LeBron he can explode off the floor like a Deer 🦌 This is Going 7 Games take it to the Bank even the Grizzlies without Adams or Clark to help Jaren Jackson Junior & Tillman would normally come off the Bench.Lebron would never have 20 rebounds with Adams at Center & Jaren Jackson Junior at Forward with Tillman coming off the Bench with high flying Forward Clark they miss him rebounding it's putting to much stress on Jaren Jackson Junior,but Memphis is going to run the hell out of the court next game & they pretty much are going to let Ja.& Bane & Jaren Jackson Junior shoot the Basketball not Brooks Ja. I believe hurt his hand on,that fall during the 2nd quarter it affected his outside shooting,but he is a Damn quick as a cheetah 🐆 & can like a 🦌 deer explosive. Russell Won the Game,for the Lakers,but very late when Ja.Morant made one of 2 free throws with less than a minute in the Game that allowed LeBron to get the Gane tying high bank shot to send it to OT cost the Grizzlies Big Time Ja.in Game 3 was making every 3 point shot & all his FT'S but that fall to the Court when he got up shaking his right hand it's also his right wrist & fingers. LeBron didn't ever go down the court to play offense when Ja.came hauling ass with the steal & LeBron was still under the goal of the Grizzlies when Ja.was going to go over him they need to move the circle out in the NBA,so for the injuries won't happen as much with like on the Greek Freak or Ja.Morant or any high flying NBA Player.
LeBron James becomes the oldest player (38 years, 115 days old) in NBA history to record 20+ points and 20+ rebounds in a Playoff Game.    Wilt Chamberlain (36 years, 262 days old) set the previous record on May 10, 1973.
Lets gooooooo
Dlow is smooth as a Cadillac
My TV cut off before overtime. I thought Memphis had it. Good comeback LA.
Davis block on morant is like blocking a kid in the park 😅 helpless kid
What separates a Fox from a Morant is yeah he's fast and a crazy athlete but he's way out of control a lot of the time and depends solely on his athleticism with no IQ or feel for the court. Morant is another Westbrook.
LA HOPE 😂
Now we're is the defense
DS is fast 😂😂😂
Leave James alone. He’s 38 and still a beast.
Intense!!!!
Im fine in the west wahahahahahaha 🤣
cool to see adam sandler there
That's why good teams ND  players always gotta remain humble  don't underestimate other teams they thought Lakers was gonna be ah piece of cake now they struggle ND down 3 to 1 praying for ah miracle 😅
Since Ja Morant play agains the lakers the memphis never win😅
Now this is how the Lakers should play
when is the random drug test for LeBron?
Walkers are idiots on all good times episodes.
Surprised AD DIDNT FOUL  Morat at the end 😂
Dam I heard king James ain't clutch what happened my goat 80 baby
Not so fine in the west now anymore eh.
This is an ugly game in general, but glad to witness the Lakers pull this off again
🎣….It’s OvA 😂😂😂😂😂.. JA Got Couple More 🎣 Expeditions.. ☠️
Brilliant match eh
Too small dillon.
Defense for the win for lakers wow the defense was unconscious
Kobe was in the building watching 4 sure
i'm not LA fans but I want Brooks to get eliminated in playoffs hahaha
Common on Lakers defense pls.
i'm not really an nba fan. only when its playoffs and my home team is in playoffs i watch the highlights or games with fam.   but just from skipping thru a few minutes of the vid, i can tell lakers is pretty good and I think they might go to finals
Kobe is so proud right now of the lakers may he rest in peace .amen
Morant needs to stop trying to posterize the Lakers' star players, making a fool out of himself
Why everyone think 38 yrs old is "old"  lol what universe i am?
The king James 🔥🔥
22 Points 20 rebounds 7 assists ,  several blocked shots  , 3-1 lead  and  taking Brooks to the hoop to end it.   I'd say King 👑 GOAT 🐐 JAMES  got his revenge on Brooks for his comments.   Brooks played like an old man.  LOL 😂
Turning point of the game was when Russel hit 3 three pointers
🤴🏾
I used to like ja, but after everything he’s been into lately I ain’t feeling him that much. He still amazing to watch but not rooting for him. I hope he can turn everything around for himself and family
Yeah, LeBron is too old.  Should have kept his mouth shut.  He's woken up the beast in him.  :)
DLO 3 STRAIGHT 3POINTS 👌🏻 LEBRON'S AGGRESIVE CLUTCH SHOT 🔥 DAVIS BLOCK TO MORANT 💪🏻  ESPECIALLY ALL LAKERS PLAYERS MADE THERE BEST TO WIN 💜💛
the debate should not have been existed!!! LeBron been the goat since he step on the court!!!!!! carry on
WHOS OLD NOW !?!? Ohhh okay 🤫🤫🤫🤫 bet you Dillon gone keep that mouth SHUT
From Gsw, to miami to lakers this is the best playoffs so far!
who's old?
What can Skip Bayless say about this
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Lake show!
ONEe OF THE BEST LA Lakers 💪💪💪
Naaaahhhh! We're fine in the west😂😂😂 LOL🤣😂😅
Mygosh,I dont know why they still give minutes to beasley.Let looney replace him instead.
I had a glimpse of the 2018 lebron at the end of regulation in the 4th and OT. I hope they come back much more stronger in the game 5 and finish the job so that they could prepare for the warriors or kings.. Go lakeshow! Let's get it done on wednesday!!
Looks like Ja is not fine in the west anymore🥺
Dillion Brooks Who??
Playoff Bron is back
Now this is a game! Both teams looking good, looking like champions. Love it.
Lakers swing the ball LeBron run point and they play hard defense and AD and Bron play long.....they going very deep to the point they will say can the Lakers make the finals...don't believe me just watch 👀
Let’s go lakers
Wow.  Just wow.  Lebron!
Wow crazy gg lakers
Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!! Never Old, LEBRON is on🔥👑📛
Wow. Congrats lakers👌🏿👌🏿 West playoffs now is the best series.💪💪👌🏿👌🏿😂
Old man James with the 20-20, that looks like 40 to me 👀
i believe both teams played aggressively.  No complaints from either side
My man ja really just throwing himself on people and trying to get that shooting foul🤦‍♂️
I’m fine in the west
Lakers are so boring to watch,. All they do is go to the line and shoot free throws.
Ja “I’m fine in the west” lol 😂
Without Steven Adams they really didn't have a real chance from the beginning imo😂
7:24 SMDH
LET'S GO, LAKERS!!! 💜💛💪🔥
i knew it was over when vandy started his 3s, lakers in 5
Allowing LeBron to simply drive to his strong hand and lay the ball up with .8 sec in the game was probably Memphis' last chance this series and they choked. I certainly can't see them doing much moving forward with Morant playing with one hand. It'll be nice to have some peace and quiet next year without the Grizzlies constant disrespectful trash-talking after this humiliating 1st round exit.
goat
Thank god lebrons not clutch
Goodbye Memphis! Goodbye boastful Dillon Brooks and overrated Ja Morant... See you next season Grizzlies....
Ja ain't bron and bane ain't kyrie. Am I right or are we going to see 2016 come back? Grizz fans please enlighten me because I want to believe west is easy
My only knock on Lebron is have the same energy in all situations, winning, losing, up down show complete confidence at all times not just when it’s 30 seconds left and you got a 9 point lead ijs. He becomes a killer when knows it’s it the bag but we need that killer all game Good game lakers
I poke bears. 😭
In regulation up 2pts I would have put Bron on the line
I think the DLo trade really worked out for the Lakers. they went from not getting in the playoffs, to LeBron getting healed miraculously, to now getting to the semis.
LA padding the sh!t out them shots😂
Lebron made the half-court shot before OT, Not counted but incredible
I’m a Jordan guy but I’d take Lebron any day of the week
refs love the lakers it seems
7:25 so smart by bron.  he knew ja only saw a poster the second he crossed half court
Yoooo @xQc I see you
4:24 diva lebrona
At 9:30 King Lebron and AD  With  Reaction Made me GOOOOOOO Crazy. I had gooooo Crazy. WOWOWOW. I love it.
LeClutch 😏
This game is a battle of energy bursts, the team with the most energy wins!
This is some bull shit, Memphis would lose to a team that has veterans and plus Lebron. NBA had this planned from the start. Why not let them play?! We are talking about a team that barely made the playoffs that beat an unhealthy team this is BS. This type of shit doesn’t make me want to watch the game. The NBA is controlling all of it. It’s going to be LA and Boston. The two teams with the most rings in the NBA History. That shit is boring. I personally want to see a small marketing team win something. They doing them all wrong.
Step on the line referee don't you see that Infront of your side come on....
Every game in the last 24hrs has been insane…
Probably the worst #2 seeds I ever seen
Who tf are these guys???
ja morant the new westbrook 😂
D Angelo talaga Ang bida nang laro mayon
Let's just take a moment and appreciate the greatness of Lebron James. After his 20th!! NBA season he is STILL playing at a hall of fame level. There is no comparison in basketball history. This team has what championship teams have, the ability to win when one or more of their key players has a bad game. This might have been the worst game of ADs career, but the leadership and heart of LBJ lead this team to a key victory.
Brooks comments never age well. 😁🌆
HE IS HIM
Take that Brooks, game winner on your face 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂is
dillion brooks crying louder now
How is it the highlights but the refs aren’t in here?
I only watched this game cause my juicer was in attendance courtside. #RallyTheValley
my wish to lebron is that he can thronhouly enjoy every game
dillon bricks
Where was this Laker team during regular season?
if morant will not change his game of style he will be the nxt d.rose.
Old dude out there playing with a bunch of youngins 😅
Sino sinasabihan mong matanda Brooks?😂
I was nervous every time Schröder has the ball. He had a lot of assists to the fans.
Good thing to.. Watch!!!
Lebron and the wily Lakers much like Steph and the grizzled Warriors are proving vets and strong star power gate keeps the Memphis kids from getting deeper into the playoffs.
Baaa baaa baaa 20/20 20 years in last drive on the kid who called him old And oneee    /Ja won’t be satisfied until he gets a real injury, why would you try to jump over Lebron in the restricted area smh
I thought we was about to lose for a sec lebron saved the day this guy has sybaritic energy gotta love it
Heat and lakers are over in the brink of upset and over achieving in the playoff👏👏👏👏
This series is the best in this year's playoffs first round
To all haters how about dem Lakers King and Prince a.d looking good...and the rest of the Lakers are cooking..unc sharp laker nation we out 😊🎉🎉
Now all y'all youngsters, after seeing LeBron tonight, imagine LeBron at Ja's age.
Refs did EVERYTHING to prevent a Grizzly win 🤦‍♂️🤡 overturning good calls, gave the ball to LA when DLo threw it to the fans, took away a AD foul in the 1st half. Grizzlies LOSE they Challenge Lakers WIN theirs immediately after. LeBum clips Ja Morant mid flight and it’s a offensive foul on Morant? Lol rigged them from 13th to 7th in the West while leading the NBA in Free Throws Per Game without Old Man and AD even playing most of the season. Bronsexualz will look right over the cheating as long as it’s in they favor, NBA is terrible these days
What ah game😅😀
I can only imagine the pain that the foul mouthed spammer and the LeBron hater (LeBronater) @yaboyikes is having. He's on a mission to trash talk the Lakers especially LeBron and the teams he dislikes.
These Grizzlies should know when to talk, and when not to. From saying they're fine in the west, to talking 🗑️ to the 👑.
What a clutch performance by the goat 👑
LeGrizzlyKing 👑👑👑
L.A Lakers conducts block party...!!!
THE GOAT. Coming for that 5th ring in year 20🤞🤞🤞✅✅🍀🍀🍀🐐🐐🐐🐐
LEBRON went allllll the way left on his ass🔥🫡
Tremendo juego 🔥🔥🔥
LA 👑
If there was just a little bit more time after Anthony Davis made the block and LeBron shot the half court, probably would’ve been one of the best moments in the NBA
This is the reason why LeBron is light years better than Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan would be Al-Farouq Aminu level without Pippen’s help and Phil Jackson’s coaching.  All other arguments are considered dumb and large volume cap 🧢   It is what it is. End of the freaking story! 🤴🐐🔥
LEGOAT!!!
Russell hasn't been shooting well all series but those 3 straight 3s was huge.  Unbelievable game. Hopefully they can finish in 5 so they can get some rest because Sac and GS going 7
@7:26 Morant is so out of control sometimes. He had no chance of dunking that or even getting to the rim.
D Russ saved LA big time..
Damn, everyone on the Lakers stepped up at crucial moments. Total team effort!
LeBron, clutch plays after clutch plays 🔥 Sheesh
Those TO’s were stupid. They got very lucky.
Lets go Lakers 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎💯
38 years old. with 20+ points ad rebounds!! Just WOW! Goat
Dillon Brooks said LeBron is old LeBron replied, the old man beat you😂😂😂
I'm on the bandwagon Lakers all the way yes I said whip  my ass later😅
Year TWENTY! 👑  Respect greatness 😤
Now y the hell ja try to kill hiself like dat😂😂
Dillion and Ja wanted this? 🥴🥴🥴
Russel save the lakers from this game.
Grizzlies talking shit about warriors and west, now they can’t even get out of first rd most likely…don’t count your egg until it hatches
Why does TNT think it’s a good idea to have a voice like that on your television broadcast holy 💩 man lol smdh
I CANT HATE LEBRON AT THIS POINT. 😂
Number 2 seed who?hahahah And in the east miami 8 seed milwaukee number 1 3 -1 also
A 38 year old getting 20 rebs is insane.
Fun series, can't wait for the next one
Appreciate Bron now because y’all gon miss this when its gone.
At this point Lebron is like Old Man Logan, old and past his prime, but will STILL, F***, YOU, UP!!! 😂🤣✊🏽💪🏽🔥👑🐐
Anthony Davis defense was clutch
Thank you, Dillon Brook for waking up the KING!!
No records being broken, but one of those games you wish you were at in person. Goosebumps!!!
And the grizzlies call themselves a “dynasty”
Very intense game to watch Lebron James at age 38 was still phenomenal,but that boy Russel should get most of the credits of the win his 3 straight threes really put the Lakers back in the game.
The funny thing is that the Lakers are probably the easiest team in the West right now. If the Grizzlies can't beat an old Lakers team, how did they expect to against the Suns or Warriors?
😂😂😂😂😂
lebron cooked Dillion bricks on 33 seconds
Yahooooo... Go lakers gogo.. lbj
Russ you deserve it myb❤❤😅
grizzlies choked on their own vomit!!!
Lebron Half Court shot is unbelievable even though it was late. Amazing 🎉 Congrats Lakers 🎊👏
Grizzlies already got humbled by the Lakers in game 3 but they just brought them straight down to earth while shitting on their ego with this win.
I just remember what Morant said "I'm fine in the west" 😂😂😂 maybe on season, not on playoffs🤣🤣🤣
Good Game! Wow. I saw the lakers slowed it down and played a few key half court plays. LOVE IT! LOVE IT. Trying to blast despi threes, barrel, plow, and jump over people as fast as you can had me shaking my noggin. (Jaaaaaaaaaa) haha This is why i havent seen a full NBA game in 4 years. Just watch highlights now. Lakers showed up. Fun game.
💜💛
Way to go Lakers!  This was a great game to watch with a spectacular finish. If the Lakers can eliminate the No 2 Grizzlies then it's it's very possible for them to win it all. I hate seeing the Grizzlies lose.
I'm fine in the west 😂
BRONNNNNNNN !!!
Brooks: I don’t respect no one until they come and give me 20 rebounds.
🐐James and AD🐐💯‼️‼️‼️‼️
maybe Grizzlies needs to sit Ja on the next game. Only game they won so far was when Ja was out.
Yessir.
Had me shouting at this replay lol. GG Lakeshow!
lebron will blow a 3-1 lead just like the dubs did against him in 2016 lol
Lakers are lucky in having D'Russel. Hes always making spark in crucial situation.
Brooks be taking Lbj boot camps all series long
Yo that scream lebron did Finna be on a t-shirt tomorrow I'm going str8 to the mall
Lebron got another 10 years left
loved seeing the King show it to them! They only talk when they’re up, now they’re down 3-1 to an “old” man
Greatest show on earth long live Lakers dynasty king James the goat
What if James and Davis get hurt? Do you really think this particular Lakers unit will win without them?
Damn 🔥 This playoffs games are on 🔥🚒 Love the energy of both teams and the crowds.
dillon brooks:  i poke goats.  old goats.
witness the greatness!!!!
Historic game wow!
Wheres dillon? Probably crying on locker room.
I love you king 23 for 23 24 for 24 the whole team balled ad game five put a goat on it
D’Angelo 3 consecutive 3s saved the Lakers in the game!
Greatest of all time LBJ🙌🙌🙌
What now Morant and Brooks? Cry like a baby
Nag walk out si brooks haha
Im fine in the West -Ja Morant
Lebron is on drugs 😂😂😂😂 way too strong for his age.
💜💛💜💛💜💛
That game was butt ass naked
Whole city at your head for the boy, I aint even gotta call no one for it -Drake 🤫
Let’s see what SSSSSSSSSSSKEEEEEP Bayless is going to say about Lebron tomorrow morning 😮
🔥🔥🔥🔥
memphis better without ja
7:25 What was ja been thinking jumping over bron from that distance. I can only see this guy ruin his career with injuries by trying to be superman.
Not a lakers fan in the slightest, but that look Lebron gave AD at 9:34 was bone chilling. That's a man I don't wanna see in the western finals.
Billon Drooks 🙃…..clutch defense
Gg
Brooks wanted all that smoke
First Laker with 20 REB and 20 PTS in a playoff game since Shaq in 2004, at the age of 38, 2004, that's almost 2 DECADES!!
Grizzlies the most embarrassing 2 seed ever. Here's a team that talks the talk but can't walk the walk. They talk like they are a dynasty but can't even beat a team whose two best players include a 90 million year old man and the other one who is made of glass. I am not a Laker fan but I enjoy winning money and the Lakers have been winning me money since they got rid of Westbrick and made great trades at the deadline, I hope to see their winning ways continue. Go Lakers lol!
Congrats Lakers 🔥
Lebron still has to win to 2 more chips with no empty visits to the finals to go .500 in them. Still he was great tonight.
Indian NBA fans: Ja Morant ❌ Ja Gharpe ✅
Nice game
Leclutch at da rim 😤😤💯💯
“I’m good in the west” 😭😭💀
Dillon who???👂 🦍💪🏻
BIG MF DISCREPANCY . 7th seed doing all kinds of damage ! xD
What in the hell? The lakers actually had fight😳😳😳😳😳
Bruh ja is suicidal, he gotta chill with the flashy stuff
Good ass game. Mostly everybody was goin off 🔥🔥🔥
Time for the Lakers to gone on and get the Grizzlies on up outta here on Wednesday lol
LEBRON THE GOAT. MAN I HOPE HE GETS HIS 5TH AND 6TH RINGS SOMEHOW
i fuckin h8 the Lakers... i can't lie. but goddamn this game was unreal. Fuck memphis
Whenever the lakers win, I don't see that Yaboiyikes guy commenting here lol goes pretty quiet until they lose again lol
its over, lebron never blows a 2-0 or 3-1 before
LeBron's 1v1 agaisnt Dylan Brooks for the last basket with an and one was tufff af! You can see how fired up Bron was
*Memphis mascot is a Grizzly Bear so what Dillon Brooks meant is that he pokes himself lol. He poked himself tonight.*
AD better get on his knees and thank AR, LBJ and DLo for bailing his ass out again. Dude is the most frustrating player to watch in the league, never been a more inconsistent "superstar" in the league. Great dub for the lakers
Dillon: He old. LJ: Hold my beer, Davis beer, Russell beer and .....this L. Not a lebron fan, but I must admit. I like go see that fire he had when he was younger. Hate to love the guy.  Like Tom Brady 😆
Brooks said lebron can't go left...he went left for 30ft straight and got an and 1 on Dillon brooks for the game sealing layup...priceless
James went past Brooks for the basket and 1 in the lsst seconds of OT.  I wonder how Brooks felt. 😂
Russell 9 points in less than a minute and lbj layup on the entire roster is just crazy. I didn't not see this W for the Lakers at all but I'll take it
i dont think its a parade in ja morant city tonight
Yes
D'lo kept the lakers on the floor and the 👑 do his thing, and that's 👏👏👏
Lebron is playing like Lebron! Incredible
As a grizzlies fan this ending of the season was inevitable. Guys gotta mature and the roster has to improve. The talent is there but the focus is lacking. Hope the holes on the roster are filled with true professionals and vets.
Lebron is still the best, not these other MVP’s that are in their prime and get injured every week and miss 10 games every month
No ! Im fine with the west.. .
This playoff has been the most exciting playoff since the early 2000s. You won't know who will win the finals
I want a hear what Skip has to say now lol
Where’s all that big talk now? Once again they fail to prove themselves. I hope LA takes the next game by a landslide. Memphis needs to be HUMBLED
Great 👍 Win. Now Bron needs to tell A.D its your turn, here go the 🔑  brings us home Wednesday # NO EXCUSES
JA morant need to learn how to fall smh
Grizz are fine in the west tho
Jimmy Butler - Career/Playoff high 56pts - Win Lebron James - 22pts Career/Playoff high 20 rebs - Win  Both had 3-1 series lead, man this is what playoffs all about 😤😤😤
Nice game👍👍👍
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I still would rather Lonnie Walker get Malik Beasley minutes
Eat that L Brooks. Savor it. 😂
What a game!!!
Wilt Kwame davis was lucky the 38 yr old goat was here to the rescue again!
D lo put the lakers back in the game 🔥
Brooks: Lakers won in game 3 because I got ejected 😂. Hahaha.
Mn memphis cant ever get foul calls..but  freight train can....crazy.....he the goat tho 😅..
why the fuck JA always want to end his career for the highlights😅
huwat a night lakers,good game!!!!!!!!!!
I love the physicality!! This how a basketball game should be played. No baby fouls!!
9:21 At this moment Brooks regretted everything he ever said to piss LeBron off... 😂😂😂
Even all the Lebron haters put away their hatred to see Memphis lose.  Ja, Bane, Brooks = Fake Gangsters
Lakers in 5 😜😝😜
Olrayt! 😁 Goody job Lakers!! ☺️☺️
LeBron owns Dillon Brooks
I’m a Laker fan but Ja is a wild man!
The way these games are being officiated in the Lakers favor Lakers winning the championship I'm calling it now watch it seems like the refs are on LeBron payroll
Lebron is an inspiration and dedicated. That's a fact. As factual as 1+1 is 2. You can't tell me any different. I won't ever hear you out. Don't care what the haters say. It's just not up for debate. We need people like Lebron in this world.  I can tell that this man shows up every day behind the scenes to work on himself and his craft. I'm 35 and been feeling my age and my body change for the worst. Lots of drinking, bad eating habits and my depression and selfishness been killing my relationship and I might lose my family because of my choices.   If I had an ounce of consistency, dedication, and discipline this man has displayed throughout his 20 year career, I'd be where I want to be regarding my physical health.  I wanted to be like Mike. And I'm gon be like Lebron too.
Dillon BRICKS too small!!! 👶🏻🧱🤣
What a game!
That’s a scary look lebron had on his face after that and 1
When Mafia call Silver's office...Make some scripts. Injuries, Suspensions, Officiating etc;.
Dillion needs to be careful with mouth next time .. Respect greatness
he pokes bears, huh?
(in movie trailer voice): 2 LEGENDS COLLIDE 7:26
EPO, test E and a growth hormone secretagogue will do a hell of a lot for a man
Not a lebron fan, but sad to say Lakers is going to eliminate this Memphis cubs😂
wow...
I poke bears I thought you was a grizzly
Long live Lakers dynasty king James the goat
Lebron is not a goat; he is a carabao.
Never count the Lakers out.. looked dim in the beginning.. but how you like em now.. go Lakers
Playoff basketball is hitting. Teams giving it their all just clashing head on. Beautiful competition
Game of the Year!
Memphis is Strong team in Regular season 🤣🤣 Ja Burat is not fine in the west
What a battle
I’m getting mad energy from the 2020 Championship run when they beat their opponents 4-1 😂
If you haven't already.... SUBSCRIBE!!
Memphis ego destroyed
Apparently Ja says they fine in the west😂
Dillon Dynasty Brooks 2023 nba 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Grizzlies defense suck so bad without Adams and Clarke
Russel🦸‍♀️
We are fine in the west 😂
It's a parade inside my city yeahhh
DLO saved us tonight
THATS WHY HES THE GOAT! THE GOOOAT
This doest change the fact that Ja is still fine in the west!
Damn 4th quarter to OT was straight 🔥
Hes play back in miami days
Waiting for Dillon 😂
Miami vs Bucks is still the highlights of this day
Old man take over what a shame in the young memphis 😏
This is one of the greatest playoff performances of all time. I believe Kobe is the greatest, just my opinion. If LeBron continues this crazy consistent great play then he will be the GOAT. This shit is nuts
8:10 lol skip will find something to Discredit this play.
My goatttt
Mafias are watching...Come Playoff time.
game is too good
D lo was the catalyst
Lebron said to his interview that without those 3's of Dlo might end for them. Props to Dlo he ain't performing well these past 3 games but you got us in 4.
LEGOAT
Lebron James is the greatest player of all time
Classic!
Lebron hitting clutch shots  - tying lay up - clutch lay up - dagger lay up  Skip: Lebron is noy clutch because those shots are not jump shots
Nice game L. A
NEXT TIME GRIZZLIES DON'T BE COCKY, BE HUMBLE ALSO YOU HAVE NOT PROVED ANYTHING YET JUST GETTING TOP 2 SEED IN WEST AND GETTING KNOCKED OUT BY 7 SEED LAKERS --,--
D-Lo Came I clutch tonight for them Laker Boys Wit Them three 3’s late in the 4th
Go Lakers!
That’s right don’t get cocky kids
I am at a loss for words.  I feel like this might be one of the first times in my life that I am appreciating "the good ol' days" as they actually happen.  I can't believe my eyes when I watch this 38 year old demigod will his team to victories.  We are blessed enough to be alive and witnessing some of the most godlike performances in history by the literal basketball messiah.  I am humbled.
WAHAHAAHAH😅vuldozer James ❤what an epic battle
7:27 😂😂 he tried it
The ball rolled right to uncle shay shay before OT, he put hands on it game 🤧🤷🏾‍♂️
lol xqc and buddha
LEBRON IS MY DAD
LEZZZZ GO PURPLE AND GOLD, SHOW TIME LAKESHOW IS BACK BABY. LEBRON A BEAST LIKE USUAL 🔥🔥🟪🟨
Ja morant yabang now pahiya later🤣🤣🙏
When LeBron ties the game with a CLUTCH basket to send it to overtime, haters will say D-Lo”s 3’s saved the game. Wait I thought LeBron wasn’t clutch?😭😂
Davis fouled Morant at the end show have been fts another bs ending not called by refs
That is why they are in Hollywood. They are the Showtime Lakers.
LeClutch.. 🔥🔥🔥
baka lebron!! yan!!
Who said LeBron is Old?prime performance tonight, amazing performance!!!!
You talked trash,you get crush. Hey Brooks,not so arrogant and cocky today are we?,serves you right JERK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LeBron is just unbelievable at his age. And this whole Lakers team is ready for the west Semifinals. Brooks poked the bear in the balls and will regret it. LET'S GO LAKESHOW 💜💛
LEZGOWWWWW
The Grizzlies lost their season once Dillon Brooks opened his mouth. I guarantee he will never do that again.
Lakers had the second best record after all star break. This team can win the damn championship if they keep playing like this!
0:52 why LeBron just stay there like he was glitching? 😅
They got schooled by an old man lmao that's what they get for doing nothing but talk
Wow
That was one of the craziest games I've ever seen and I've been watching NBA for 22 years
❤❤❤❤
Yeah, Ja is fine in the West
Blame brooks for awakening the beast 😂 wait brook who?
It seems the "dynasty" is in the brink of elimination just in the first round.
Lakeshow Block Party is missin Dwight
Akala ko Volleyball Yung laro Ang daming block hahaha
Skip still gonna hate lbj
D-Lo with da ice
Lebron dropped 40 on Dillion Lol. 20 boards and 20 pts😂
Oh God I know it hurts (Hah!). LAL, #7.. Up on 3-1 on #2 Memphis. Haters DIDN’T believe or heed warnings.. Memphis is a bad matchup for the Lakers..  The Lakers beat Memphis 2 of 3 during season, and now 3 of 4 (3-1 🤣) in playoffs. A phenomenal performance by LeKing James I expect nothing less cone playoffs..
Memphis in 7. Lakers go blow 3-1 lead
Lakers number 2 is awesome defense 🇵🇭😳
Thee LAKERS are AWESOME 🎉
Morant is not gonna last much longer in the league trying to jump over taller guys he needs to slow down make the right play not trying to be hero ball that's not gonna win you championships
Dopest games r the laker games   Laker nation stand up💪🏾💪🏾💯
Well alright my Los Angeles Lakers this was a good NBA Basketball Game between 2 good NBA teams I'm going to have to watch this game again Congratulations Los Angeles Lakers a good team effort.
Morant really wanted to dunk on Lebron to put it on his resume
LeClutch
9:30 Look what this old guy did to dillion brook yall lol clown of the century lol
Is he still fine in the west?😂😂
Im fine in the west
Hell yeah
block party in LA
You asked for 40. Hold that 20-20. 40 piece
Who is old now? Big mouth Brooks will eat his words.
We good in the west!
What skip gonna say now bout that clutch moment to tie the game
See that throw down on LeBron from DB? Damn LeBron don’t play defense 😂😂
Love the defensive highlights!
I'm fine in west
Lebron looked at ja like tf is you doing 😂😂z
Dennis needs to be better with the ball. You can’t be a guard turning over the ball like that.
Po brooks..got his team getn spanked on out the playoffs
Lebron says he doesn't need to prove anything but I think he really enjoys proving all those doubters.
i ain’t seen that look in bron eye since miami 😂😂
some dude fr hit jaren jackson down 8:50 😭😭😭
Ban this Channel   PLEASE!!!  This was not Game 4....
Congrats to the Lakers for going up 3-1 over the Memphis Grizzlies.
Respect dlo
The King had a good game.   Only if AD played better earlier in the game it wouldn't have been such a nail biter.
Little Ja Morant is by himself ou there against these 3 superstars ( Lebron, Davis, Russell )  and potential future stars ... He needs more help ... Lebron's not hard to beat, its his teams. He always has stacked teams with solid role players
Damn! This game made me pee in my underwear 😵‍💫 Go Lakers 💪
Uncle LeBron playing like age of 28yrs old❤
❤
Griz fans crying themselves to sleep tonight.
Amazing game. The Lakers need to keep Reeves!
9:24 perfect way to shut brooks up
Dlo & vando stepped it up
i love you bron
The three point shooting in this game was awful.
Woooo Hahaha !!!! I can feel the Adrenalin Rush coming from the Fans!!! Now who's Old now!!!👑👑👑The King's Stomping out his Class💪💪💪💪💪
Good Game Lakers. Dlo did his thing before fouling out, Austin reaves was good of course & Lebron closed the game out for us. With that being said, Anthony Davis Needs To Be Arrested
It's a bit unfair! Lakers 5 players against Memphis 8 players!! 3 of whom wear striped shirts and have special powers to blow the whistle!! But it didn't matter did it?!?! 😅😂
Brooks the silent dog
Memphis warriors fans are crying now 😂😂😂😂
King king 👑🎉🎉
Ja morant need to chill 😂😂 he think he Spider-Man
Desmond bane is a dog, and I’m a lakers fan. He has the talent brooks thinks he has.
Bron had his wife and fam out Thea yk he had to do it big King James 💎 Always and 4eva the Greatest Big 38 baby
This once one heck of a game lets go
that performance leveled his goat status with mj. also mjs son had a great playoff performance in miami
Morant at 8:44 😂😂😂
Laker for the win 23
Ja Morant went 8-24 from the field tonight. He wasn't as sharp as he could have been given the significance of this game. Yes, he did have seven dimes to go along with four boards, three steals and 1 BLK, but Memphis really needed him to shoot better tonight than he did.
MJ was on the wizards not even making the playoffs at this stage in his career
And juss when I thought dlo was still loading this series he came in clutch. And on another note, now I see why ja morant is always hurt, he have zero balance. Everytime he dunk his body juss look so awkward in the air then he comes down full force on his arms like bro needs to understand he can’t always dunk on everyone😂😂
The looks at the end. Ring 💍 worthy
That was a game!!!
LeBron 👑
Thanks Bron for the reminder that it’s worth fighting the good fight of Bron vs MJ with my brother in laws 😤
"I'm fine in the West."  - Ja Morant
that block from Davis  . dame  and the shot of LBJ, but did not  count. .
LeBron and AD effectively shut down and silence Ja Morant .
LEGOAT❤
the loudest crowds are always in Cali!
"We ain't worried about the west" - Ja Morant
This game was so exciting and frustrating at the same time. Lebron is LeGreat. AD was ass once again. Dlo is a streaky ass player. can be hot and cold in a matter of minutes. AR is solid. dude is a smart player. Dennis played great tonight.   This team will go far IF AD actually shows up to do his part. still waiting on AD to show up in the playoffs.
Dildo Bricks wrote a book on how to awaken The King. Call him OLD and Slow Gm 2, then give him Low Blow Gm 3. The Return of The King Gm 4. See ya later Dildo Bricks Gm 5!
There is a lot of 3-1 lead in this playoffs right now.
AD has to be more consistent for the Lakers to have any real shot at another championship.
If the a Lakers win, Brooks will be a chump, just like when Kobe punked Barnes after that lame ball fake.  Lets go Bron!  Lets go Lakeshow!
We're fine in the west.
The Lakers only shot 27% from 3 in this game, so this win definitely did not come easy. Memphis did an outstanding job of guarding the three point line, but ultimately it wasn't enough for Memphis to get a win.
Defense wins championship. And the Lakers are the best defensive team in the playoffs so far...
I thought Shroder's turnover w/ 1 min left ruined the  Lakers' winning chances, but thanks to AD and LBJ to save the day.
congrats lakers💖💖💖💪💪💪
DILLON BROOKS FUTURE CHINESE ROLE PLAYER
LeGoat !
Damn dlo hitting those 3 clutch buckets!!
James murray, This series ain't over the Lakers got some Breaks and calls to go there way, if anything The Grizzlies best themselves they should,ve could,be Won in regulation  time, The Grizzlies will go home and Win and force a game 6, in Los Angeles, and go in with the Momentum and Ja Morant and Bane and Jarren Jackson Jr. Will step there game up and Win game 6 in Los Angeles then go back home to Memphis and close the Lakers out and win the series in game 7.I will give the Lakers credit they played good and did good to come this far, but--------( NOW IT,S OVER FOR THE LAKERS,) THE GRIZZLIES WIN THE SERIES 4----3.
ive never been a big basketball guy, but i get the greatness of lebron
How will skip Bayless still blame LeBron tomorrow?
The dude at the bottom of the screen at the 8:20 mark😂
This is less about the Lakers and more about Ja Morant playing like a bleeping idiot. He doesn't play team basketball and thinks that turning the energy up to 15 is going to get the job done. I called it at the beginning of the season, I said, if Ja keeps playing stupid and out of control he's going to injure himself and cost his team big games. Guess what? He's doing both. You can't just turn the energy up and turn off your brain. That doesn't work in today's NBA.  I'm glad Ja is not on any team that I like. Grizzlies are never going anywhere with Ja Morant. Get a bunch for him now while you can.
Warriors vs Lakers it is
What a first qr by Vando and 23 pts for reaves. But I hope that 4th qr that DLo did give him confidence on the next game hes been struggling on this past couples of games. that 4th qr by DLo let the lakers get back to the game and AD and Lebron Didnt dissapoint on that OT. GOOD TEAM WIN BY LAKERS 💜💛
Lebron and Jimmy 2 🐐’s
Over little brooks too LOL
King sized performance 👑🐐🔥
Congrats lakers, LBJ💪
The grizzlies need to realize that Lebron is 38 and letting his teammates shine. He’s having fun out there and these young guys like reaves, hachimura, Russell, Vanderbilt are shining. It’s a dangerous team especially when you have AD and Lebron, never know if they’ll give you 40 in a night
Dillon probably regret now for poking the bear ✊🐻
Ja saying the west won’t be a problem only to be down 3-1 in the first round is hilarious
LeBron James: 22pts 20 Rebs 7 Asts 2 BLKs 1 TO (Best thing about his stat line)
I've seen. the most blocks ever made in this series in total
38 years old is nothing...early days people used to live up to 200 years....yep .And some where 12 feet tall.
Anthony Davis blocked the hell out of Ja Morant's shot 😂😂😂😂😂
ow they say bron ain't clutch ha
I’ll take that ugly win Lakers 1 more let’s get it done..I loved Dlo spark he gave even more the team effort of sticking together like glue when nothing went they way..the refs has to be better they literally can’t see anything..Grizzlies are a very dirty team the league needs to start suspending these players for playing so dirty this is a talent game leave the dirty playing back in the 90s
That AD s' block on Ja s' 21 foot jumper & LeBron s' halfcourt heave is crazy even it's not counted 😮
I'm just here for all the Memphis fans who thought this team wouldn't be EASY WORK for Lakers this series, gentlemen sweep coming 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
Let's F'n Go!
Lebron is little not human
First
Memphis are  fine when jah is on the bench... They won when jah is on the sideline.
👐⬇️🐐
Skip and Shannon tomorrow gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
"I'm fine in the West"
Lol Dillon Brooks 🤣
Playoffs like finals.
Hear attack😂💔💔💔
❤LBJ and Jimmy B. Show us tonight what a hall of fame is both Legend🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ja Morant right now:  "we are not fine in the west"😢
The Lakers were lucky that they won this game. LeBron struggled from 3 (1-7 3PM) and AD had a miserable shooting night from the field where he only shot 4-13 from the field.
He’s the  GOAT 🐐
Lebron put brooks to SLEEP!
@7:43 he traveled & made a bucket 🪣 & no one said anything that’s cheating 😅😢
Dillon too small
38 years old still most clutch in the league.  All arguments are over. GOAT.
Players getting hurt or playing through injuries really sucks
Ja NEEDS to learn how to slow down the game for him, play half-court offense. He can't always be doing slam ball stuff off the break or he'll end up on a stretcher
Ja didn’t even dap his own dad up after that buzzer beater dunk 💀 embarrassing 😭🤣
Brooks never said what kind of 40 to be dropped on him. Bron's 20-20 is good enough ;)
xqcL
The fact that these boys keep skipping out on media availability after the game shows what kind of men they are
If am Morant, I'll demand a trade asap. His teamate are all joke🤣
Dillion Brooks can't even guard Old Man Lebron and his mouth is too loud. He should do more job than trash talking.
Fine in the west
Alright LA it’s time to sit Malik Beasley. Lonnie Walker has been more efficient for the year. Got to make a change
Electricfying playoff game
Lakers would beat kings but probably lose to Golden state
We run the west ja morant says from the couch yes 👋👋✌️
#2seeds pala lakers jaja iyak morant
The Lakers appear to be the most championship bound team right now..
LeBron James finished the job on game 4. Time to finish the Grizzlies ASAP.
Either AD is injured or his ankle is in jeopardy and he had to ease up a little because you definitely see that AD wasn't playing at the same level he's been playing throughout this series. You could almost see the energy/life being sucked out of the team after AD went down. Luckily LBJ , Russell, and Reeves helped them in the clutch.
Nice game LAL🎉💪
Hmm, I dunno man, Lebron don't look old to me. What was that Dillion dude talking about?
I’m a die hard Warriors fan and I never really was a big fan of LeBron but holy f*** is he the greatest basketball player alive right now!🔥
lebron james pokes back dillon brooks lolz. and btw brooks is not a bear hes a dog. all bark no bite.hahaha. and  i almost forget, brooks is not as old as lebron but how come he cant score and move like lebron, thats the irony of what he said. just hahahaah brooks
Lakers let's Go 3-1 is real 🤘👑💜💛😋🤩
At some point skip "baseless" will eventually have stop hating and start appreciating the greatness of an overall great player. For LBJ to be playing at such a high level at 38 is none more than amazing. I won't go as far as saying he is the g.o.a.t. But he no doubt is in the conversation. Let's go Lakers.
Memphis clowns
What a MFn game. Let’s Go Lakers!!!
LeBron is a super hero hahaha ❤
D. Schroder really gives the ball automatically to Memphis
Everyone would say they want Steph curry to take the last shot but you already know that lejames is more clutch the steven
Don't poke the king or else this is what happen!   BROOKS AFTER GAME 4: "I AIN'T TALKING AGAIN"😂😂😂
Lakers is in playoffs mode
dillion brooks can't handle all the smoke
Note to  Dillon Brooks , LEBRON gave you not only 40 he gave you 2 extra points. 22 points & 20 Rebounds. Must respect 🫡
I'm a die hard bulls fan but for some Krazy reason I put my money on the Lakers goin alllllll the way . Idk 😂🙃
Who's fine in the west?
JA is fine in west, being down 3-1 must make his Dad proud 😂🤡
Around 2018 NBA TURNED INTO WWE 😅
Ad and lebron at the end got me weak asf😭😭😭😭😭
Gogogo dillon brooks
LAKESHOW!! UNSTOPPABLE
where's the first round exit comments now?😂
Now it's Clear LeBron is the 🐐
Dillion wanted 40 from lebron does 20 points and 20 rebounds count lol
Dlo was the one that kept us in the game 3 in a row
SO ALL THOSE BUBBLE LAKERS HATERS , WHERE U AT
Lebron just showed the world you don’t need 40 points to impact a basketball game.
Lebron James Beast is a beast 38 year old still Dominate 45 minutes 22 points 20 rebounds 7 assists what a monster
Dlo redeemed himself after missing that shot in the 2nd half!
Is it me or Lebron looks more hungry than ever! Let’s go lakers !
The play-in teams destroying #1 and #2 teams is amazing!
LEBRON JAMES
Hahaha whos old man now??? 😂😂
u know shannon gonna bring out the goat mask tm cant wait lol
LEBRON JAMES IS THE GOAT, APPRECIATE HIM WHILE HES HERE HATERS!!!
brooks just touched lebron's crouch
Ad still not injured??! Wow
Yes GO LAKERS
2:37 LMFAOO he’s so trashhhh😂😂😂😂
Brooks feeling allstar 😂
Nasan na Yung mayabang na nagsabing kaya Sila natalo Nung game 3 ay dahil natangal sya sa game.ano masasabe nya sa laro nila Ngayon na panalo na natalo pagkatapos mauwe sa OT
Leclutch!!!
Well don’t poke the bear😢
Ja Morant starts the game with excessive carrying. What is the matter with these refs??
As usual,Lakers didn't fail to give me a mild heart attack
I'm fine in the west hahaha 3 -1
tawang tawa si russel need kna trade
Memphis will always and forever be that of a regular season team. They just vant get over the hump when playoffs hit.
good job lakers 🎉🎉
Heat and Lakers having upset
xqc on the courtside
LeGOAT 😤👑🐐🏀💯🔥
1st Half Block Party by the Lakers Vanderbilt/Lebron and A.Davis 😂❤ What a Defense!
The games today were off the hook
Ja's attempt to jump over LeBron defines this series so far
I'm fine in the West!
Brooks got bullied by james lol

Los Angeles Lakers:3 🟣🟡⚪️ Memphis Grizzlies:1 🔵🟡⚪️Ⓜ️🐻  Game 5 Wednesday 7:30pm on TNT in Memphis
Dillion Brooks should've never spoke. He just unleashed the beast.
This is what playoff basketball is all about!  Such a big win, let's go LAKERS 💜💛💪💪 we can't settle though, let's close it out in Memphis. D-LO low key saved our asses in the 4th. Big plays in OT🔥🔥 Bron with a 20-20 game 💪 at 38 ... Shiiiit 🔥🔥🔥
kudos to JJ, he was one heck of a defender, he was just too good at defending lakers can't score much under the basket
This was a good one 💥💥💥💥
Is Ja still fine in the west ?
The grizzlies are better without Ja...that's weird lol
That one fan in the front row at 7:53 was trying way to hard to get noticed in the 4th quarter 🤣
Leigothisassbackfortalking
But but leBron’S not clutch
And to think Lebron thought the idea of a play in was stupid, at first. Thats why owners do not listen to players when it comes to those type of decisions.
This is exactly why Dlo was traded for Russ.
Had me at the edge of my seat. Job's not done yet though. Let's send these loudmouth Grizzles back home in their own home court. 💜💛
@Yaboiyikes wanna die?
DLO comes in clutch just in the nick of time! Still surprised Walker didn't play at all and take some of Dennis' minutes when he kept turning the ball over.
He fucked around and found out. Learn Chinese Dillon
L
Dillon Brooks: I poke bears LeBear: time to eat
Imagine westbrook shooting 3 bricks on 3 straight possessions😂 d angelo is the best fit for us. No matter how much ppl claim about westbrook he cant shoot a ball which laker needs right now. Lets go lakers.
Them Lebron is not clutch narrative is getting old real fast I wanna see what they’ll say next
brook's defense on james at the last minute of the game is legendary. he live up to what he said😂😂😂#dynasty
1 more W! Staples was rocking tonight  RIP 🐍
D Russ made 3 back to back 3s r u kidding me and nobody wanted DRuss?  Now keep The Flame going
Bron Bron 😂.  Said fuck you haters.  Goat 🐐
Kudos to 3 threes of DAngelo Russel that's big.
These comments fresh as mouth wash
Ja is so juvenile and one dimensional in his offensive strategies. Nothing methodical, nothing cerebral, just "I can fly over you" type of mindless offense game.  Dude we know you can jump. Lol.
That defense was crazy
Ayo! Did someone grab JJJ at @8:49?
LeBron James-Goat
I’m calling it…. LAKERS vs HEAT ….. Finals. (REMEMBER ME WHEN I CALLED IT) 💯💯💯💯
LeBron 🐐🤴👑
“We’re fine in the west” Ja Morant 🥶
🌹
Well Grizz Ain't got swept, they showed up all heart ❣️and balls 🏀 for 1 game..,. smh they lack talent!!!  For a team ▶️⏯️⏯️ playing together for so long and don't have rhythm yet.  I feel they should watch more videos on how the great teams flowed together regardless the other team, to be honest Lakers has some guys that have not. Played together say over 3 years consistently with each other, What's sad is that Lakers gonna give them the impression that they are a great team, they are good but not  Great, Step Curry is really underated, so my guess is that Warriors come from behind 2 games down to  win!!!
Nah!!! We’re fine in the West!!
Damn, really a wild wild west.. From Play IN, now 3-1..
Lakers vs Warriors gonna be lit
Imagine lebron drops 40 on Dillon brooks in an elimination game just to spite him and say “now you’ll remember me as the dude that dropped 40 on you and kicked your team out in the first round as a play in team.”
Fine in the west huh. 😅
These playoffs have been unreal so far.  MOST games this past week have been insanely close
Is Ja still fine in the West?
2:38😂😂😂d lo tryed kicking the ball😂😂
I'm fine in the west😂😢😂😂
We not gonna talk about how the highest quality the “nba” has is 360😒
pre pubescent gangstas 😂😂
So do Laker fans want the Warriors or Kings, or is there no preference?
22 points, 20 rebounds, 46 mins, at 38 years old #HIM 👑
Get these Memphis Thugggggsss outta here
Brooks be shifting career when this series ends
The Haters of Bron now is too quiet Haha😅😂
Get these Thuggggggsssss outtta here!
Na ngangamoy na malapit ng mka pasok sa round 2 playoffs game Ang Lakers. Anu na Yung mga maaangas na si brooks at Morant bago kayo magyabang clarohin nyo Muna na ubos na Yung oras bago kayo magyabang
LBJ sleeping really well tonight.
CRAZY 🔥
Temetrius and Dillon Bricks are getting exposed as frauds 😂
What a game....Damn Ja, you're injured, stop jumping like that😂...damn, dude is special, a true star...great game....lets goooo 💜💜💛💛, just one more W...
If the Grizzlies were smart they would have holed the ball
I’ve been rooting for the lakers but I really don’t know about the whistle at 9:29
Wowwwww
I'm still holding out hope that Memphis can fight back, but it's unlikely considering LA has momentum, experience, and LBJ on their side.
Them Laker Boyz Showed Out Tonight!
Dynasty
"Nah, we good with the west" 😆
So much traveling shit ain't even fun to watch, anybody can score if u take 5 steps without dribble, TRASH
No Griddy for the Grizzlies tonight take that L 🤣😆
11 points in 41 minutes. Dillon Bricks is so good 😂
We fine in the west ~ja tata
Whats that Brooks?? Speak up - we can't hear you!!!
Go Lakers, hopefully you can make it till the finals, rooting🤧😍😍😍
They won cause XQC was there.
It’s official: Dillon Brooks is LeBron’s son.
Shouldn’t have called Lebron old. You will regret that for life. Morant no defense.
D A M N, this game gives you chills in your belly button.
LeAngry
Legoat came in Leclutch
That's how u do it..lebron closed it.. but ad needs to play good every game
Whoop
9:27 🔥
1 2 3 Cancun my grizzlies
xqcL
Lebron might get the credit but the lakers don't win this game without dlo
dillon brookes could not guard an old man
9:23 brooks didn’t even want to guard the king lol 😅
D'Angelo Russel looks like Post Malone😆
Who won it
Dumb ass coaching is fucking Memphis over. Jenkins hit his ceiling time to move on from him. And take Brooks with you
Why didn't Memphis foul Lebron on that drive to the basket at the end of regulation when he had the layup to tie the game?? They let him get all the way to the basket without fouling him? They were up 2. He's not a good free throw shooter. Make him make both free throws to go to OT.
LeBron 👑
There’s the 40 Drillon is asking for
Good team efforts.bravo Lakers.
MAANO NIM DILLON BROOKS BUGOK 😂😅
The LeBron and Reeves connection was highlighted in spectacular fashion.  What a game.
Lakebron
102k views in 20 minutes damn nba 🏀🔥
DLo saved the Lakers in the 4th quarter with thoses 3 straight threes when Memphis was up 97-90 that was the turning point that kept the Lakers in the game and allowed them to win it 😂
The Heat, and the Lakers are play In team that might knock out top seeds this is what the league had in mind when they came up with the play in tournament
Hello semis ❤
AD not impressive again, but the newer Lakers are making contributions to support LeBron, and there's no way the Lakers aren't advancing to the next round.
Ja-“I’m fine in the west” 🤣  Reality: down 3-1 and on the brink of elimination 😩
Hard fought game.
22, 20 and 7 with 2 blocks and ONE TURNOVER?! 2 of the CLUTCHEST shots of the SEASON
Lebron sends it into OT and then gets the AND 1 against Brooks to seal the game, how sweet.
Has Any 7th seed in NBA history ever been up 3-1 on a 2 seed?
Lakers vs warriors yan ,
Imagine this game with Kobe at court side watching. Let’s go Lakers!
JUST GIVE HIM HIS FLOWERS PLEASE. At age 38 to close the game like that. Pls don’t ever say he’s not CLUTCH. LeGoat 👑 #LAKESHOW
for sure Dillon Brooks will decline an interview again after Bron scored a clutch lay up and one on his face while pounding his body hahaha
Would have been insane if that basket LeBron hit at the end of regulation counted!!👑
LBJ THE GOAT
In fine in the westcwhahahha
dlo’s 3 pointers kept us in the game and lebron closed it out for us. 3-1 baby!
Memphis is weak DB didn't want to talk . 🤣. Straight chump . Memphis got weak fans too
If you still find a way to hate on Lebron at 38 after this game  Smh your simply not a fan of the NBA at all      Dlo with ice in his veins  AD with 1 of the worst games I have ever seen came up clutch at the end   Reeves Vanderbilt putting in work  What a win for the Lakers
LECLUTCH
That 1v1 with James and Brooks at the end was HYPE Lebron is always going to be the GOAT no matter what anyone says.
Goat James 🐐  👑
Incredible 😂
🔥
Russel saves the day 🤟
"We good in the West" How's that working out for ya? 🤣
So lebron is not clutch? 🙄
i really thought Lakers were done after Bane hit that 3 pointer to go up 7 even thought there was like 6 minutes left. Lakers' offense just look stuck and no flow no movement but man, DLO really came through back to back to back 3s.
Wala pala itong si morant puro yabang lng pala
Dlo bringing the heat, bron dominating Dillon, ad doing what he does, 1 win away!
LeKing sheeeeeeeesh
Dillon Brooks seen getting his ass beaten in the Memphis locker room for opening his mouth
LBJ really went "and i took that personally" with Brooks talking shit
Awesome the bes't lebron james🎉💪💪
I swear austin Reaves flops more than Marcus smart
where are the Ja defender " i'M FiNe In ThE wEsT" hahahaha
DON’T POKE THE BEAR!!!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Yesss sirrr them 3’s from russell helped out alot…you got 💩 on brooks😂
One of the best playoffs experience hands down. There's always one player that saves the day when everything seems to be impossible. Russell was one of it, combined team effort with LeKing dominates the OT. 1v1 clutch with brooks guarding him was the icing on the cake. :D
My pubic hair now is standing
Memphis 3rd tier city 😂
GOAT JAMES & the squad with another classic! It's amazing there's even REMOTELY a goat debate,this man is the model of consistency. I grew up a BIG mj fan,watched every championship run,the BULLS were mostly unbeatable,jordan not so much.
Mfs need to stop doing that vein thing cuz dlo saved the Lakers
LeGoated
YESSSS LAKERS ONE WIN AWAY
Lakers💪
Clap clap Lebron...
After game 2, Grizzlies fans were saying Lakers are gonna choke the series. Look at the Lakers now with 3-1 lead!🔥
9:04 Bron decided to spare brooks life. And im not sure why we all know he could've sent him to the shadow realm
Man oh man !! You see dillan the villain, you should never poke the bear,this is what happens!!!😂😂😂😂 , lets go lakers!! Let’s close this series out!!!
I'm fine in the west 😁
LeTrash
No surprise really..
What a game! What a win by the Lakers!! LeBron James, at age 38, playing at the highest level,  was incredible. One more win and we are in the second round. Let's go Lakers 💯❤🎉
Dillon the Villain, oh what a sight, LeBron Cook Brooks, you're no match in a fight, Your shots may be hot, but your words are not, On the court, you're no king, just a mere peasant in a pot.  Your game may be strong, but your attitude stinks, Your ego so big, it's hard to miss the clinks, LeBron may cook up some fancy dishes, But you're just a pretender with empty wishes.  So listen up, Dillon, and listen up well, Your bark may be loud, but it's just a mere yell, You may think you're tough, but you're nothing but a crook, LeBron Cook Brooks? More like Dillon Burnt Cook.
Le22and20
THOSE 3 THREES THAT  DLO MAKE WAS THE DIFFERENCE. HE GOT HOT IN THE RIGHT TIME WHEN THE LAKERS NEED SOME POINTS TO STAY IN THE GAME♥️♥️♥️ AND THEN LEBRON DO THE REST
8:20 happy fan
Love that they are doing this with Ja in the lineup. Else we all know what Memphis fanboys would have been crying about.
Yeah the suns would’ve been a bigger problem for la if they having problem with grizzlies cuz Memphis has nobody like KD or Book
Excuse Mr Morant, I was just wondering are y'all still good in the West!!
That last layup with the and one on LeBron James, I kept replaying that moment over and over again
There’s a parade in my city, yeah?
I'm glad LeBron didn't take a 3pointer and went for the layup to forced overtime.
Another Legendary moment by LBJ down 2 layup against the hands of DPOY JJJ
B-E-A-UTIFUL, B-E-A-UTIFUL,  B-E-A-UTIFUL! Great Battle for The Win For Home Court Advantage over The Grizzlies!!!👏👏 Let's Get 1 More Lakers!!!❤❤❤👍👍😃
The Lost Angeles Lakers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (117-111). The latter has blown their chance to tie the series. Adams and Clarke were out indefinitely! The same goes for LaRavia. Do you think this particular Lakers unit would've succeeded without James, Davis, Russell, etc.? The former will win in game number six. Next Game: The Blues Capital of the World, Memphis, Tennesse. BE THERE!!!
Ja IS NOT fine in the west 🔥
Great win Lakers, really thought they were going to lose it at end, LBJ saved them and Lakers took it in OT 😆🤣
give credit to d lo
LeBron going in clutch mode 🐐
Old man is on high af now😂
Morant stop gunning n give the ball up on the fastbreak#itsthaplayoffs
Dillion wanted 40 does 20 points, 20 rebounds count lol
What an intense game.
Leflop trying to be kobe at the end 😂
@2:47 the push was definitely a foul
You right and I can’t find my remote control to save my life to cut the tv on. 😂 😂 so I’m here watching highlights.
I think their fine in the west
Bron turned into Kobe with the boards brooks opened a can of worms he wished he didn’t😂
xqcL to all the juicers
THE KING FROM ACRON
Warriors Lakers about to go fucking crazy
First heat go up 3-1 against the #1 bucks, now lakers go up 3-1 against the #2 grizz 🤯
LeBron smells blood man going for that 5th ring. The East is not solid besides the Celtics.
You wanted me you got me!
Congratulations team lakers good job for game today 😮👍👍👍❤
22/20/7 😱
Bron taking those 2 charges showed you what type of mood he’s in this playoff season
Ja after this game- I don’t think I’m fine in the west.
“He’s doing goat things” stop meat riding. Man literally tampers with the league every year to switch his team up and play with whoever he wants. Lebron should be investigated for league tampering but they won’t because he’s the monkey making them the most money
DLO came in CLUTCH with those 3s... What a game..
Let's goo lakers💛💜
If the lakers play like this, I'm sorry memphis, but the lakers is going to the semifinals.
Morant on death wish when going for a layup 😂
Block party lol #LezgoLakers
That and 1 with Brooks Guarding LBJ is just chef's kiss. Lmao
They seem fine in the west
I'm fine in the west 😂😂
GSW will be scared of it, Kings in 6
Lebron haters RN 🤐🤐🤐
Austin Reeves don't give a fk tho😄 damn, that guy's cocky
Damn.
BOY IS THIS FING 1850, 360P BLUD ????? where ????? NBA ?????
This quality sucks
Taylor Jenkins has one of the best shooters in the entire league and never gave him the ball, instead he kept playing bane way too long
Airheads cryin right now. 😂😂😂
Whoever said King is not GREAT? Do that when your Age is also 38. 20 Rebounds and can finish until OT without catching your Breath.
yaboiyikes, leultrainstinct and sac12 rn: 🤓⌨️
Two superstars during clutch time:  1. Lebron, driving for a crucial layup for the tie to send to overtime.  2. Steph, calling an imaginary timeout
Jarred Vanderbilt is what you can say the role player that you would want in if you are a championship contending team
Im sweating ice cold on you Lakers!!. Glad you got the W. Sheezz.
it is funny that some of the top seeds in both conferences are down 3-1
And that’s another Lakers W 💛💜
That bucket to send it to overtime was crazy just with how locked up they had LeBron most of the night honestly thought he’d miss that shit with .8 left it was insane lmao
Difference between Bron and Kobe. He's a team player, look at the sacrifices in points tonight for his team to succeed. He doesn't need to take every shot, especially at this age, to help his team win.
Yall over here praising LeBron when infact it was Reeves that kept them in the game. Even with DLo threes it was Reeves that set him up twice. Yall witnessing a star in the making with Reeves
King james
👑
Dillon Brooks wanted 40 outta bron. 20 pts 20 reb 💀
When LeBron came into the NBA I wasn’t even born yet. I’m about to finish my first year in college and he’s still dominating the league.  Truly a once in a generation type player
Good job lakers!
It's all brooks fault for trash talkin.
He's fine in the West 😢
One more win baby !! 💯
This was one of my favorite LeBron games ever. Just the GOAT doing a whole lot of GOAT things on an off scoring night including the clutch buckets despite the slow scoring night. Grabbing 20rebs, taking 2 charges, getting the blocks, 7ast and just 1 TOV in 45mins of playtime in an OT win... All in his 20th year at 38yrs old. Incredible...
What a game
ANTHONY SOFT ASS DAVIS THE MOST INCONSISTENT SUPERSTAR IN THE NBA 💯🤦🏿‍♂️
Dillon the dynasty brooks be like 🤡
not good edit.😂
Oh shit dynasty is in danger 😱😱😱
😂  ❤❤❤❤
Lebron is the goat enough said
Anthony "RNG" Davis.
Go Los Angeles
LEBRON JAMES PLAY OFF MODE TURN ON!!! 🔥🔥
all thanks to the juicer Elgoblino @xQcOW
Lakers #1seed somny
LAKERS W BABY
Why is the quality so low
20-20 There’s your forty Dillon 😂
Congratulations lakers team . ❤❤❤😊😊😊 . Go for the semi finals , finals west. Conf. And nba finals . Lakers champs again
im fine next season
Is it Austin Reeves or Awesome Reeves?? 🤔 Baaalliiing!! 🏀
Since he came back from his foot/feet injury bron has shown many chinks in his armor and as someone who was 12 when he entered the league and has has the privilege of watching his entire extraordinary career I can't help but feel a little sad
nah went from banging on heads to finessing the lay thru contact. you GOTTA respect this man game !💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🐐.
Lebron came in clutch 🎉
Shoutout to DLO, he started the rise, Lakers seems like they're dying in the 4th with Memphis running away with all the momentum, those 3 straight threes was huge
Ja played 3 game, they lost 3 game. Damn! Bench Ja already
55k 22min 20.3M subs
Just stating the obvious, that wasnt an offensive foul on Ja Morant, when he drove on James at the end of the game.   But we know who the refs like
"He's old" - Dillon Brooks
Yessir Let's get it Bron Bron 🐐👑
Y Ja try to catch that body 🤦🏾‍♂️ would’ve been bad for LBJ if he would’ve 💯👑💜💛
Who's old now Dillon Bricks?
😂😂 Lakers tryna kill me. 🥴
That's why I love this game❤️🏀🔥
Kobe would be very proud of this year's Lakers team🐍💛💜
Can’t wait until Clark reacts to this
lbj with two clutch baskets and 22 rebounds just goes to show his greatness
Maybe this’ll humble them grizzlies lol doubt it
Jalmost Carry Morant: "nah we fine in the west" Ja: gets blown out 3-1 in the playoffs
Dillon Brooks isn't takling much now is he? Go Lake show!
go Los Angeles Lakers
King James 👑
You see jjj is pretty good so we ain't been able to slow it up playoff style via ad
This Game just made me jump out of my seat! The Lakers had to gave everything they can to win this one. Thanks to D'Angelo Russell's three 3 pointers near the end of the 4th quarter and LeBron's drive to the basket that leads to overtime.  The Lakers took off from there and never look back to seal the Win! Great defensive effort for the rest of the team overall. Just one more win to go! Let's go Lakers!!!
Ja: I’m fine in the west
These playoffs are creating great series. I am not a lakers fan or grizzlies, but man good basketball. Gg lakers . Super suprised they gonna take the series. Idk about beating the nuggets tho
Dillon keep shooting terrible Brooks
Talagang. Mahusay mag laro ang. Lakers. Team   LeBron idol. Lo. Talaga. Si .Leron. James
Very impressive the king !!
To the Lakers Haters we appreciate you😂😂😂😂! Y'all talked about us for 2 years! How do we look now?
LAKERS beating number 2 seed for 3-1 lead.  MIAMI HEAT beating number 1 seed for 3-1 lead.  This is really a BIG DAY for Basketball!   Hoping these teams both win their series. 💪
Very funny that Dillon Brooks could not keep up with "old" Lebron. 20/20 at age 38!! Not sure what Dillon's stats lol
Narrator: He was in fact not fine in the West.
“I’m fine in Cancun” - Ja Morant probably.
Dillon brooks is a pu**y who avoided the media again after the loss
Lakers are winning all go Lakers
Despite the W this didn’t look like a championship team. I want Lakers to go all the way but it won’t happen if AD isn’t showing up in big games. 12 point contributions just won’t cut it if they’re gonna contend. It’s not just a one off, he only had 13 in game 2. They only edged it out tonight because the Griz shooting was abysmal.
playoff jimmy and playoff lebron making the younger opposing superstars look kids in the playoffs lol
Maybe climbing up chimneys is not good for you after all...
LeBald & the El Segundo Fakers are giving old, washed-up people hope that they can still accomplish things in life — and the Tennessee Teddy Ruxpins are reminding everyone that youth, stupidity & immaturity are 3 human characteristics (when combined) that may lead to failure
DLOOOOOOO!! THANK YOUUUUUU!!! 🔥💯
As a Grizz fan. That was a tough game. Gg Lakers. Gg.
7:48 that AR's move was sooooo Manu Ginóbili like
If AD is doing his rotation of monster game for gm 1 and forgets how to shoot the next game, that means AD will have a monster game next for game 5 and Lakers beats Griz 4 to 1 to advance.
Morant is not good in the west😂
Dillon brooks rn 🫠
Brooks sorry asf
Ja Who?????????
Fucking amazing defence by schöder tonight. Locked Ja and Bane up like crazy. He’s gotta play far more aggressively toward the basket though. He has the ability to be a scorer but he’s deferring to AD and Bron too much
When Lakers defense locks in this is a hard team to beat. Reaves and Rui contesting those corner 3’s was huge. And LBJ at damn near 40 taking over on offense and defense. 😤😤😤
Bane came to play. My gosh he wasn't missing anything open til crunchtime....shoutout DLo...yea his defense is horrible, but those 3pointers in 4th is what made OT possible.
Now this is a playoffs. Edge of my sit the entire time. Go Lakers.
Bron!
Jordan better
A 38 year old superstar taking a charge call in clutch? That's unheard of.
desmond bane is a menace. like a klay thompson type player
LEBRON THE GOAT
"mEmpHis in FoUur. mArk my wo.....  STFU
Damn both games tonight were intense endings... Let's gooo the playoffs looking lit so far
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck you Dillon Brooks! Fouling at 0.3 seconds with 4.5 odds!
LeBron James Is A Genetic Freak 🧬
Betcha after the game, Ja points a laser at the ref on his way home.
Dillon "dynasty" Bricks!
Lebron is officially the goat
Memphis youngblood's are clowns
LEBRON IS 38 YEARS OLD PLAYING PRIME PLAYOFF BASKETBALL
Did anybody else hear Bane scream for his life when Lbj block his shii? Lmao 😂
I think Morant is not fine in the west.
Lakers in 5 😆
Let’s F’n Gooooooooo GOAT JAMES, 🐐🔥⛹🏾Great Game Lake Show
LEBRON STILL CLUTCH IN YEAR 20! PUT RESPECT ON THE LAKERS NAME!
That's my uncle LeBron, the 2nd GOAT. 👍😁😁😁✌️
Morant = lol
The expression on Lebron’s face says it all when he scored that final point on Brooks. Shut that guy up!
Play of games was Russell 3 straight threes when lakers were down 97 90 and they took lead and went up 99 97
AD and LBJ really turned it up at the end and Dlo was a huge momentum swing. Reaves played well again per usual but Dennis should be thankful… his turnovers hurt
Lebron at AGE 38 is beyond human! MJ at 38 was busy chucking shots and gambling because he realized he was a FRAUD!
Lakers in 5! 💜💛
I need a Lakers vs Kings semi western finals
Nobody can defeat the Lakers in the West this year! 13 more wins for the 18th title! Unreal game! Unreal LeBron performance at 38!
JA is still fine in the west down 3-1 😅
8:43 Ja running into Tillman after stealing the ball from Bron at the beginning of OT was huge for Lakers momentum at that point of the game.
Terrible upload quality
Brooks should learn that villains in movies will never get the W.
38 old ❤️💪👑
end of a "dynasty" loool These youngin's clowned bron in the regular season, and now are about to be eliminated by them😂😂
Damn Schroder tried his best to give this game away.
Y’all can thank the refs laker nation
I'm so early it's not even in HD yet
Lebron 22 pts 20 reb 7 ast 2 charges that swang moments in the game  8-18 Fg 1-7 3pt not bad for a 57 year old in year 35
Teams going to Cancun Tomorrow to Go is the TWolves.
Memphis in 7
If only there was one more second...
we good in the west LoL i see that part YL LoL 🤔
He is too old... but still too good for Brooks and company
Luke Kennard needed to play a lot more in this game! The Grizzlies couldn't make a three in this game. Really struggled. Kennard led the NBA in three point %. He barely played. Why? Memphis coach stinks.
I’m honestly bias about this game. Both teams look like they were playing with fatigue, but Memphis was getting the best out of the Lakers turnovers. But I’m glad they made a come back.
“I’m fine in the west”
also how tf did lebron make that 3 quarter shot lol
Did not see the Lakers coming! 😮
We Just Witnessed One Of The Greatest NBA Playoffs Match.. Watching Lebron Playing Prime At 38 Is Greatness..  Greatest Of All Time 🐐
Grizzlies should just trade morant, he's way too overrated. The dude just has insane athleticism and that's it. They can get a really good piece to add to this team
No Trash Talk and no Griddies , just the way I like it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lebron owns Grizzlies after his clutch performance tonight 🐐🐐🐐
Desmond Bane look like a goddamn fish
Ja Morant: "I'm fine in the west. LA Lakers: "We took that personally."  Lakers in 5!
"I'm not fine in the West"
One of the most exciting games in the playoffs so far! Excited to see this upcoming game 🔥
career high rebound is biig
Dillon Brooks says one “old man” comment and really unleashes LeCocaine Bear
Dillion regretting his choice lmao
Told y'all The Memphis Cubs didn't want the smoke
Gg
DLO and LeBron saves the game.
9-42 from 3 not beating anybody Grizzlies missed so so so many easy shots
Yes Lakers Won in overtime what a crazy game Go Lakers
Bruh how come the quality is so bad again? This is the second video today (Lauri Markkanen MIP) that has been only 360p… quality check would be nice before publishing
Goat james
Ey Ja! you're not fine in the west😅
Don’t poke the bear 🐻 n thank you dlo for them clutch 3s you saved us
When they doubted us and says it was impossible at the start of the season I always knew it was possible as long as James and Davis were healthy great game by the Lakers a very much needed win
Lebron is the definition of versatility. If you need 30, he will deliver. If you need him to make plays, he will find open guys. If you need extra boards against a strong rebounding Memphis team, he's gonna grab 20 boards. Crunch time, takes over. Forget that he's 38, this shit impressive at any age. 🐐
Ngl I think the nuggets are going down in 5 games to my king
LeBron being the first Laker since Shaq in 2004 to record a 20-20 in the playoffs is insane at 38..
Lakers in 5 these haters real quite They said we won’t make playoffs play ins and now get swept in the first round Ja ain’t fine in the west
Im fine in the west -- black jesus
Y’all trashtalking DLo a while ago. You should thank him for draining 3’s late in the regulation. 😂😂😂
Lebron is the Goat.
Refs did an awful job in this game. Bane's off hand warding deserves an NBA officiating second look. AD should assert posting low and use pivots to finish strong downhill and not settle for jumpers. If they double him let the opposing team fully commit. Lakers coaching staff ought to correct this before Game 5.
38 and still being able to shit on teams👨‍🍳
The 38 year old Bear is the Key to this game even though AD is sloppy all throughout..but that's an important WIN to advance in the second round..Good job Lakers..we trust in you💜💛
They can't handle la lebron they Kno they couldn't handle Cleveland lebron
LFG Lakers. Let’s finish out this series strong 💜💛
BRON IS 38 PLAYING AT AN ELITE LEVEL!! Great game!! Great win!! JOBS NOT FINISHED!! One more to go Lakers!!
Vando saved Lakers in 1st 1st quarter and everyone else had their moments except Davis, the Lakers need to win this next game 2 rest
Man that stadium sounded like an early 2000's playoff game when Kobe was playing, it was very nostalgic, it's going to get tougher here on out, no matter what happens I'll be happy, this team wasn't even suppose to be here right now with how bad we started, absolutely amazing where we are right now and how far we've come with names that people never even heard of.
This game was fucking awesome
Lakers let’s gooooooo
Respect to dlo for putting us back in the game before fouling out
it was not in fact a parade in ja morants city.
AD has to be the most inconsistent person on offense.
I swear rooting for Lakers this season gonna shorten my life span... 🥶.
my glorious king still shitting on ja morcant🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The Grizzlies are down 3-1 to an old man? Bro, how? Ain’t they supposed to be young and in they prime? That’s crazy…
this quality aged me
He's Old.  - Dillon Bricks
I hate lebron but I want him to beat the grizz
Grizzlies all bark but no bite hahahaha
LeClutch still got it🔥🔥
GrizzLies fans crying in the comments 😂
Where’s all my clown and goofy ahh Grizzlies fans at 🤡🤡
Yo Lebron and Jimmy Butler are on one today!!!
Only round 1!!! This series has been exhausting and demanding 😅 both teams
Wow
the 4th quarter was just insane.
Dillion wanted 40, Lebron gave him 40 the hard way! Lol!
Lakers showed up in the 4th and OT...credit LeBron, Russell Reaves,and Ad....great win.
Shaq said “Dillon said he won’t respect nobody unless they give him 40, well Lebron Had 20&20 and that’s 40!” 🤣🤣
🐐🐐🐐
Dillon Brooks might skip another interview
thank you dillon brooks for unleashing playoff Lebron. we laker fans love you brooks!!!! <3
Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Lakers on conference semi and Warriors winning the game on game 5  NBA final between Golden State Warriors & Boston Celtics again with Golden state winning another championship that's my prediction
Ja shooting 8/24 respecting kobe's house. Admirable
There will never be another LeBron James. 1 Like for the king❤
Bane missed like 51 corner threes that wouldve turned game in Grizzlies favor disgraceful real talk should be ashamed of himself ja to with hes 8-25 ass
Let’s get them out of there game 5 LAKE SHOW💜💛
LEBROOOOON
Oh that's gotta hurt
yall needa put better quality on the highlights. acting like yall aint got the money to do so.
Last
Ja seriously needs to stop being so reckless. Like we get it. You're an explosive player, but good lord he needs to learn how to land and also maneuver himself better or else he's going to get washed up faster than Blake Griffin.
How THE FUCK did AD make top 75????
now that's a comeback i say
i was stressing out since they blew that 15 pt lead, DLO and LBJ made a huge diff but AD man something is up
Let's go Lakers..
HONESTLY A SHITTY GAME BY THE REFS FOR BOTH TEAMS BUT LAKERS COME OUT ON TOP. PRE-TRADE LAKERS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE IN THIS GAME. VANDO'S QUICK OFFENSIVE PUSH IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME AND DLO'S 3 CLUTCH 3S. BEASLEY GOTTA STEP UP--HES HOT TRASH. LAKERS IN 5!!!!!!
GOAT SHITTTT🐐
This game freak me, and my father out!
Common W by LeClutch
Meanwhile  Ja Morant is CONFINED to the west 😂
I'M FINE IN THE WEST🥲
"We both know that I have to eliminate you now. You'll just have to imagine the trophy." - Desmond Bane
WILD WILD WILD GAME!Lakers BIG W!Lebron James +20pts +20rebounds!unbelievable...Darvin Ham should continue to use the same formula in Game 3,they almost lost this game. Lakers should start Rui and DS early from the bench. Too much DLo,but credit to his 2 huge 3 pts at the 4th qtr. Reaves is terrific in close out games. Even AD has off night, still his defense makes the difference!LeCLUTCH hunting brooks (where's the OLD now!)
Go Go Go Lakers!
#2 seed of the WEST 🐻, in DANGER (1–3).
No Lakers Game Without Heart Attacks.. But At Least We Had a Great OT Comeback To It..  Let's Go LakeShow 💛💜
Seems like this series playing out the same as Miami’s so let’s hope they win in Milwaukee
We Are All Witnesses 👑  PS. eff Dillon Brooks 🤡
Tell me LeDrugs isn't on drugs without telling me LeDrugs isn't on drugs. 😂😂😂
Am I fine in the west ?
Lbj must have discovered the fountain of youth. 38 and yet most young players cant even keep up with him! Good team effort! Lets get that W in 5!
Good win but it shouldn’t have gone to overtime. They should have tore them up .
Lebron went vintage this game 🔥💯 don’t poke the bear !
LEBRON THEE OLD GUARD OF THE NBA
Who's old now Dillon "Honey" Brooks?
Go king james❤️
It’s a white league Austin Reaves him
What an OT Thriller !!!.. One Of The Greatest Comebacks From Our Team.. A Much Needed Playoffs Energy nd Confidence Is Visible Now nd Specially With ( Playoffs Mode Lebron ) Back..We Are Locked In 🔒   Lets Go LakeShow 💛💜
wow
Shannon will wear goat mask. Dillion brooks - the boy who cried goat 😊
Thank You Drillion Bricks for awakening the King
I’m glad we got the win, but imagine if LeBron’s shot after the buzzer counted…
AD ain't making it to the conference finals in one piece. bubble wrap that muthafucka as soon as the final buzzer goes.
I’d like to report a hit and run on Dillon Brooks by an old vet 🤣👌🏾
Best driver of the basketball ever lebron James
Nice one Lakers 🎊🎊🎉✊🏆
1 🎉
LFG🥳🥳🥳
Lebron with 20 rebs and 22 pts
Dillon brooks tonight. 29 points 10 rebounds 5 assists
Mr.Brook accept The fact that your team will be eliminated by the king James 😂😂😂😂😂😂
LA in 5
Ja Clearly don’t give AF about that wrist the way the playing lol I guess he see a landing pad or something we don’t see lmaoo
Brooks playing in china next year confirmed
Ja “I’m fine in the West…”  Lebron “Hold my crown 👑 “
Leking 👑
Imagine calling someone old then having a hard time locking the 'old guy' down. It's very hard to build a dynasty these days if even an old guy could school you like that after trying to act 'tough'.
Being Grizzlies fan since 2011 is a never ending cycle of heartbreak. I now understand what yall eastern conference fans went through dealing with Lebron for all those years.   Congrats lakers fans. Yall have been alot more better behaved than the GSW fans,and I apologise for Dillon Brooks. Yall have my respect.   I try to have faith but...yeah our season is JOEVER.  See yall next year✌
He may be to old to be THE LeBron James, but he’s still THE LeBron James. Know what I’m saying? 😂
The king!
The west looks good 😂😂😂
He's just fine in the west indeed.🤣
Lekingkong
Ring #5 !!!
Yung tingin ni brooks parang mamimilay nalang sa game 5
“He old I dont care” well he hit the game winner on yo ass how bout that brooks
Sucks that the Grizzles are all injured.  I wanted to see a series.
Lakers fans getting happy about this win like the refs didn’t help them😭😭😭 Memphis in 7
This hurt worse than anything that the Spurs did to us and i'm not even joking.
LFG Lakers!! Let’s finish this Wednesday!! 💜💛
LIKE IF LEBRON THE GOAT OF THE 2010s
BRON WITH THAT 2020 VISION
Lakers please stop giving us heart attacks 🙄
Brooks shouldve never poked the bear
Lebronto vibes 🔥
They said we couldn’t make it out the first round…   God did!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉💜💛
LeKing doing business. Kings or Warriors on 2nd round goodluck Lakers will just crushed you and show you how it is done. 🎉
so is lebron james officially the goat or what?
The fact the Lakers can win a game where AD didn’t show up offensively lets you know how good this Lakers team really is!
i guess they aren’t fine in the west🤷🏽‍♂️
1st
Dillon Brooks is a proven result of messing with the goat JAMES. LEARN TO FEAR HIM!
💯💯💯💯💯
curry better than Lebron only thing Lebron beat curry at is the D. savannah sleeps with other men’s curry wife’s don’t. Curry doesn’t need super teams to beat teams like Lebron
lebron fans like here 🥰🥰❤❤
GOOOOO LAKERS! 💜💛 But, I'm still mad at AD. He better STEP HIS GAME UP! The LAKERS NEED HIM!!
Lebron is the greatest player I’ve ever seen. 22-20-7 in year 20, at 38 years old. First time since shaq in 2004. That’s insane. Up 3-1, LFG LAKERS!
That was a dog fight! Great job Old Man James! 1 more.
Let’s go lakers this is our year💜💛.
1 win away ❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I've been a michael jordan fan for the past 80 years, however this marks it. LeBron is officially the goat, and there is no otherwise! JORDAN IS A FRAUD AND WOULD NEVER CLUTCH LIKE THIS!
Beat the Kardashian Curse   Beat the TNT game Curse   Beat the Chuck “Guarantees” Curse  LeBron James is the greatest basketball player of all time
LeBron at age 38 playing 45 minutes with 22 Points, 20 Rebounds and a clutch basket! Still doing at this level!! Respect greatness
Lebron is him
HE’S 38 YEARS OLD AND STILL DOING GOAT THINGS 👑
Close game
JA MORANT- im fine in west, i mean im fine listening to kenya west
22/20 at 38 is insane 😂🔥
LeBron on top
D’Angelo Russell’s 3-point shooting on 3 straight possessions in regulation kept the Lakers in the game, and then LeBron at his age to perform at such a high level is unbelievable
I’m so early, the video won’t even play
Hurry please!! I gotta get to bed!!🤣🤣💛🏀💜🥳🥳👊🏽
This is Dillion Brooks fault for thinking he was that guy 💀
bruh where the content at?
o7
The Lakers is not making it to the finals I'll say that rn this team just isn't gonna be able to score
Lerebound
