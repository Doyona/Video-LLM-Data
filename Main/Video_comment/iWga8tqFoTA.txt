Cam Green apologising to Crawley after getting him out 😂
can anyone name all the commentator when cawley gets out  on this please ?
Green seems like a sound lad.
Crawley is a bit hit and miss but on his day he is a joy to watch.
The one that got Root was a real grubber
I remember being in Wales and having to go out I came back and saw complete domination
Crawley magic!!
that shot at @2:00 was outrageous btw
this just goes to show how crap travis head is
Really, you don’t have Ali getting his 50?! Are you lot the same people saying cricket isn’t being played in the north soon 👍🏼 jokers
Yea all the headlines Crawly , what Ali did set Clwaly off .
Can’t deny Crawleys 189 .. however !!!!! He made far too many poor shots and got very very lucky on a number of occasions.. again .. 189 is laudable but but but he played a load of rubbish as well as some great shots … anyway it’s well past time he earned his place in the side .. he’s been carried by the old pals act for a long while 😢
Why isn't Mo's 50 shot included?
Moral victory to England
Zak Crawley played a showboater's innings. All firm/flat footed drives and plenty of inside edges. He got lucky. The way  he plays, he will occasionally get lucky. But I find it hard to admire. Opening the batting and doing well consistently requires a skill set and a mindset that Crawley doesn't have and will never acquire. He is not interested in doing so.
Awesome
Let’s just hope the rain doesn’t ruin this match.  The series doesn’t deserve that.
I'm loving the Sky Sports Cricket Highlights. Where did Ricky pointing disappear off to?
Who said test cricket is boring??!! I hope this goes to a decider
The weather is gonna rob us of a victory in this test and of regaining the ashes
Only thing that can save the Aussies is the rain
Roots grubber is bad news for Australia
First England cricket game I have ever watched. Not a bad test to start off with.
Give credit where its due Australia showed zak Crawley respect for his innings even green who bowled him said " wrll played"
Pity for Root, would have put my house on him making a century, but that ball was impossible to play.
Rain on Saturday is making this test even more tasty than it already was! When Duckett went, all us English were fearing the worst, what a turn around
Fantastic batting! Great stuff. What a series. What be great to take the series into a decider.
Love watching Moeen bat at 3
Some brilliant Bazball, but controlled Bazball. Hopefully this will be the way forward now.
Moeen Ali went past 3000 career runs and over 200 wickets, putting him in the same sentence as Andrew Flintoff, Ian Botham, and Stuart Broad. Forever.
Absolutely amazing from the boys
Right thru him is a bit harsh for Roots Wicket 😂😂
England's day  ?
The Aussies have gone full-WOKE... Go Woke, go broke 🙁
Amazing play😁
Well done Crawley. About time.
Great from the Aussies congratulating Crawley as he departed, first class 👏🏼👏🏼
Hope the weekend rain doesn't ruin it all
Best series of all time
It has taken until the fourth test, for either side to dominate a days play. Well done England.
that lack of bounce for the root wicket was outrageous. if the wicket starts doing that the ozzies will be screwed when they bat
Don't think Duckett will be in the team long, I like him but he's been a bit unlucky
England could have won first test match, just a few too many mistakes. Second test they were out played, last two days Australia haven't played well by their high standards but they are good enough to win the Ashes, I hope it goes to the last test match.
It will be such a shame if the rain denies England a chance of levelling what has been probably the greatest Ashes series ever.The "old" England would have been 3 down by now .But what is really so frustrating and disappointing is that,we SHOULD have been 1-0 up,and,if Bairstow hadn't have given Carey the chance to  stump him,we'll never know,but  we COULD have been 2-0 up. Both the Tests which we lost were gifted to Australia,by Stokes and Bairstow ! This is the only way to play.Since we started to play like this,even the Tests we lost,we could have won !
What a wonderful innings by Zack Crawley!
Nice to have commentary without shoehorned female commentators. Especially that hysterical Alison Mitchell - gawd......
Rain on the way to take the ashes away!!
If we had been more careful in the opening two and not made silly mistakes we wouldn't be needing a near impeccable performance in this one. Let's just hope we can take it to the fifth test.
BRILLIANT cricket!!
I know Crawley got a monster score, but Ali at #3 was for me the best, especially after losing the first wicket early.
Unfortunate for Root that he got such a low bounce. He was looking great and fully deserved a century.
Those who read Vithushan Ehantharajah’s piece on Cricinfo on the 17th of July, just two days before this, the Fourth Test, began, will marvel at a comment that he made which has aged well.  He suggested that Crawley had played the Australian quick pretty well whilst crunching the numbers, and saying that he may yet help England to win the Ashes.  Back then it was a brave prediction and he deserves a cigar!  👍👍
Back Zak and don't crack
I sure hope the weather holds, it dosent look good though.
Australia were slapped around all over the place with ease. They've lost their mojo and ever since the Bairstow incident, England have dominated. Cummins is a broken man.
Rain looks as though it will save the Aussies.
should be a 6th day when there's a whole day of rain
Australia are massively missing Lyon. I’m not suggesting he would have stopped Crawley and Root but he would have had certainly had some impact on the game. Not bringing a proper spinner into this test is looking like a very questionable choice now.
We may need to win this match almost entirely tomorrow. Play 15 overs like it's 20/20 pace. Simple as.
Duckett is the worst openeing batsman since Roy..
I really hope the weather don't ruin what is set to be a brilliant test match
One man shows Zak Crawley keep Endland hope alive to win the test match.
ANDERSON needs to go now. Unless its a TOTALLY swinging wicket.
Already had a feeling they wouldn't show Ali's 50. Which is a shame because he batted quite well at number 3.
After the pace bowlers from down under failed and they didn't appear to have a answer for the aggression shown by their opponents, the Australians in the crowd were shouting "give them head for gods sake give them head./
Flippin eck!!
Not good news for the Aussies that we’re starting to see some balls keeping low. Crawley’s kept a bit low but Root’s was a proper grubber and impossible to play.
Ali and Crawly had s many lives it’s unbelievable they both edged and miss hit plenty. As soon as Australia will bat nothing will go for Usman and Warner. In fact it will probably rain tomorrow which may add moisture in to the pitch.
Well done lads
Travis Head wouldn't get a bowl in my village cricket Sunday side.
The bloody weather is gonna save the Aussie's isn't it
How come they didn’t show when Moeen got 50? He played well and some great shots.
There will be no play this weekend. It is a Monsoon coming for Saturday and Sunday so the likelyhood is that it is a draw and the ashes are on a plane to Sydney.
Zac Crawley looked like he was seeing the ball so well. Joe Root got out to a ridiculous grubber when he looked like getting a century too.  Australia are out of ideas and I expect England to pile on the runs and declare after tea tomorrow.
Has Duckett actaully done anything at all?
Looks like it’s going 2-2 hopefully. Despite picking Anderson who’s finished. There’s no room for sentiment in sport
So gutted I'm only watching the highlights. What a game!

Its always nice to see someone who has been criticised so heavily do well.
Last match Ali played a shot was dropped and played the same shot again to get out...this match also he did the same....is he trying to be funny...
Crawley and root done by a ball keeping low
Cricket in england is special
Let's hope we get enough sunshine to take this into the final game! What a series! 󠁧
What a series this is turning out to be. Holding thumbs we go to a decider!
