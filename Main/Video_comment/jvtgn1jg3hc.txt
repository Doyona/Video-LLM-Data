Man I need to go watch this Bob Gurr documentary now! ❤
9:06 he paused at the WORST moment LOL 😂
Dic-tator
Oh my gosh, Scar. While I’m typing this, I’m at the Disney resort in Los Angeles, and when I went into the Disneyland park, I realized how much your build looks like the real thing. To the EXACT DETAIL. It looks awesome.
This is such a great build.
It has been an extremely long time since I laughed as hard as I did at your reaction to Doc's PA system 😂 and to think he actually made it for you.
"we dont accept children in the park." so funny
Yo! The like button got a lil ring around it after he said to like the button a bit after 1:20
For the bank, if you swap out the allays for R. Kellays, you can add a golden shower function.
Doc's announcements are straight out of classic dictatorship it's becoming terrifying.
What if you named the toy shop Tumbletown? (I'm probably too late for this LOL)
So Minecraft wiki has this video tagged under target blocks. Interesting!
i really didn't expect that pause in the middle of dictator 😭
Really loved this one, Scar! Hope you're feeling better--as always--and I'm so excited to see what you do next. You've already blown my mind with what you do. It's so inspiring for me and my Minecraft worlds. Thank you so much!
"I'll thrive you into the ground" LOL 😂
Oh I wish I could work at Scarland! With my potions I would be grate for a little food cart :D
Been binging the series n im almost done! O no
9:10 top 10 almost non-PG hermitcraft moments from scar fr fr
scar mentioning that his inspiration for the park entrance is from like european train stations makes me excited for the day he gets to go to europe and meet his best pals that live there :)
Dock has really became what?
The doc intercom is scary
Did you name the hotel “The Hermitage”? Please, it’s absolutely perfect!
I'd name the toy store "Jellie's Emporium"
& you made it way to close to Grian's land. I love what Grian came up with for you 3 to get back at the Goat man. It was great.  I am do sad we can not see Grian's entrance to his land   because your build is right on top of it.  You did not think of that.
Call the toy shop ‘toying with toys’
A new word has been added to scar’s dictionary: oxidadation (14:30) Another one: discombobbalated (15:25) 😂
Uncle Jim's Toy Store
Ok but why is evil docs loudspeaker voice kinda attractive…
Is it just me pleas don't take this the wrong way
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Nice
The toy store reminds me of Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium! Loved that movie as a kid
Nice video
Good
Doc has really become a dic...   ✨️tator of this server✨️
Hii komal a fast eat something and then you can do it tomorrow morning to all
The toy store reminds me of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium slightly... maybe "Scar's & Jelly's Toys-a-plenty"?
Nice video
The entrance building adds so much to the whole Scarland!
Nice
👍
like a nature beauty
It's not quite disneyland-- but you could go with "GTS Quartz" as a reference to 'FAO Schwarz' in NYC -- the original 'FAO' being the creator's initials and GTS being Goodtimes With Scar?
A moment of silence for Cub.  Poor guy wanted the job so bad.
Can’t wait to get to work!
Idk if the red toy shop was given a name yet but i just thought of “crimson relics” to make it sound kinda mysterious
Very good day of my life is a great time t t shirt and I have to be in the rest of schoolon
The lollypop toy shop!
Solidarity Toys has a nice ring to it
It's an awesome video
Couldn't stop smiling with this.
Scar, x has a agging machine just use it!
"Doc has really become a dic.... tator"
i think something cute for that building would be “Purple’s Emporium” or something. idk, my first thought
name the shop toysRscar
Mr. Magorium's  Wonder Emporiumis what you should name the shop
scar you are amazing! Great builder and even better content creator. thank you
Nicely crafted game.
Esmeralda's Caravan Toy Outpost  For the store name.
Woow it is amazing video. Scenes are extra ordinary
9:02 scar.......
I love how Grians base and the entrance match colors!!!
Nice
I have to really think thank your for making a center point or it would really annoy me :)
Scar always makes me happy, thank you scar! I'm loving your builds.
Toy shop name suggestion; what about “The Treasure Trove” , “Kid at Heart”, “Tiny Toys & Trinkets” 🥰
I think the best name for the crimson building is ScarToys
very nice
Vary nice brooo
Toys scar us!! Cmon can’t beat it
Good
nice task
I can’t help but wonder… do the turnstile employees happen to be rocking horse people, with looking glass ties?
I know this video was a week ago and you probably won't see this but, you could name the toy shop "The Sheriff's Toy Shop" or "The Tumble Town Toy Shop" in reference to when you stayed in Tumble town during the crossover
Store Name: Geek Out
we really gotta name the toy store tumble town toys as a throwback to our favourite toy sheriff :33
Your toy store could be called toys trollies and more
why do people wait for the copper to oxidize just build whatever you going to build with it its going to oxidize anyway better not to wait for it
This might be a bad name, but where I'm from, there's a gameshop called Gamestop, so maybe... Scarland's Gamestop Shop?
Scared toyshop
3:40
3:40
You should add a third allay that throws some for of gold at you. Because gold is also valuable, no other reason!  I'll excuse myself.
you should name the toy store mysteria
Doc is the dic….tator
the toy store looks a bit dark and spooky, some would say.. scary..others would say its a Scar-y. Sure, Scar-ily good toys.
toy store hmm Toys R us lets name it to Scar R Us
Would call the new building “Timmy’s Toy Barn”
The target block got activated by the rocket that's flying wit you while using it to boost your elytra.
Awesome ....
his is incredible. I find theme parks pretty overwhelming irl, but when the world download for this season comes out it’s gonna be so fun to just hang out in scarland with all these cool builds
Call the shop  'The Joy of Toys' Love the episode
Omg scar this is beautiful ❤❤❤😊
You should make a haunted mansion you don’t even have the light up inside just have people run in. I’m sure they’ll have a blast😂
Higher Gemini Tay so the soup crew can work together
not so scar-y toys
Scar land is incredible
I’m having visions of the landscaping shop from season 6. I feel like it would be a fantastic fit.
The reserved seating actually makes me SO happy to see
I might be late but the toy store could by called toy storey
9:05 Scar please this is a kids show. Lol
“GoodTimes with Toys” for the shop
Definitely Scars R Us.
Thanks for your video, Scar.
The crimson jukebox
One possible Toy Store name is Games Galore. 2:55
Good
Idea for the toy store: Jellie's Jollies
I don't know if you've already found a name for your toyshop yet or now, but my thought was 'Cranberry Carnival'. I do love your work, Scar. Thanks for always bringing us along.
9:07 19:50 Left _quite_ the pause on those "dic tators", eh Scar?
👍
I swear docs turning hc9 into 1984
For the toy's house I love the name "The Pink House": simple and efficient
i love that whenever impulse talks about bob, scar gets really emotional. like, you can tell how much it means to scar that impulse researched this thing he loves 🥲
I got Batman Arkham City " Hugo Strange" vibes from Docs daily announcements.
hey scar, make sure the flags are all being blown in the same direction. also, great job on scarland it looks amazing.
grain Scar said a naughty word
Is scar going to add the toy Shariff and The plush hermits
i know im a little late for the shop name but if your still looking for one try jelly toys
The name this building: it looks or reminds me of a candy store like the one in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
The shop could be called toy mania
For the toy store it should be named: Jelly's Toybox or Jelly's Toy Box
The house shuld be named Pinkys Toys
It'd be great if you got some theme park music, and "oh no, it is just a bit too loud".
ToysSCARus
that black speckled horse in the time-lapse was vibin
You should put a welcome sign on the other side of the thank you, so when hermits walk in they see “Welcome”
when you open scarland can you let us join the sever :)
Hope you enjoyed
"Scarland's Mega Toy Emporium"
toy store name...   toy store i  or   toy store e
👍
Nice game play
New sign for the toy store should be the SCARlet outlet.
The toy store should be called "Toon Town Toys"
Scar name the building "The solidarity building"
Awesome
Tycoons Toystore, the colors remind me of the wagon
I was sitting here like doc is a WHAT ? 🤣
the way scar said "dic..tator" is just hahahaha. the pause.
I think the shop should be called ScarzToyz and an idea for another shop can be called scar wars
Nice 👍
You could call the toy store “the Scartastic Toy Store”!
name that building Hermits 'R Us
When think off an European entrance I think of the train station of Antwerp
Is doc a fan of oddworld Abe's Odyssey Cause he really reminds me of the overlord in that game
wouldn't it be cool if the hermits worked together on a huge project like this for a season? imagine all the crazy stuff they could do!
YoungToys #2:40
They shuld clam minecraft days/week for the diamonds. Thats ~2300diamonds/irl week 😂
The toy shop should be named scared for toys
Nice
happy birthday, Scar! 🥳
Imagine "Little Sheriff Toy Store" for Scarland. I hope everyone got that reference
Anyone else have watching Scar as their Happy Place? ♥️
Happy birthday scar and jellie!!!😊
Toy store name: Joys With Jellie (like good times with scar but toys from everyone’s favorite cat! the mystery comes from the way cats love to bring random treasures to their owners :)
The name has to be Jimmy's Toy Shop right?
Scars toy chest
Magen-Toys  Because it's a magenta, and also magical, toy shop :)
Hes a goat tator
it looks like the Washington state history Museum 10/10
I love how scar said "get revenge on our dear leader dock" 😂
did scar ever find the grey glass payne that grian secretly threw at him?
Perfect name Toy’s Joy’s Story
For the toy store - Sheriff Jim's Tiny Toy Factory!
i reeaaally hope im not to late but The Pink Elephant sounds like a cute toy store name! ^^
Am I too late? Did we already choose a name? I was going to say Toy Store-y!
you made the entrance of centre with grin`s arch.
I think the toystore should be called "GoodToysWithScar"
Happy birthday Scar and Jellie
Awesome build but it seems rude to obstruct Grian's entrance with your own
"I want to hear that again." Be careful what you wish for - sometimes you get exactly what you asked, but not what you wanted.
Toy store name:  Jellie's Toy Box
Toys R' Scar's seems like a good toystore name to me
Ur vids inspire me to play and build better in Minecraft
For the toy store call it Scar R u toys
2:32 I hope I am not too late, but I definitely see something to do with checkers. Maybe “Ticket Checkers”, TM for short of course, or if I really wanted to have a brain blast something with the acronym of CiAME, the C for checkers, but the lowercased I is to additionally make that C look like a single G. As it could look like “GAME”
Really good video, I enjoyed every second of it :D Toy store name suggestion: GoodToysWithScar
I am grinning ear to ear 😊 this is great entertainment. It’s the greatest time ever!
When you built the ENTRANCE to Scarland I was just saying, "He's crazy; that roofline is hard enough without all the extra trim detail...wow!" and then you were like, "Guys this was super hard", uhhh, yeah!! Fantastic!!
toy storey
An idea for the toy shop name that I have is “Queen Jellies Toy Land”. It could be like she is the queen of all the toys.
doc reminds me of Hugo Strange from Batman: Arkham City
Building name Andy's ToyBox
I absolutely adore the fact that Impulse really went ahead and did the research, it’s so frikin fun to see people share their intrests and have fun with em
👍
You should call the toy store ‘Timmy’s Toystore’
Mystical magical toytown menagerie
Doc is such a dic....tator
Please add a roller coaster it would look sick
You should see with Grian to turn his portal into a giant entry point for Scarland. Kinda like how Disneyland Paris has a train station that leads to the park. In case hermits/ppl are far away and nether travel.
Scar r use
Funky Fun might be a good name
The shop should be named "The Scarland Puppeteer Panopticon".   Panopticon is another name for a Chamber of Wonders but also a type of prison, so something mysterious and wonderfull with a dark secret....
y'all are elevating the medium beyond belief! builds atop builds, PA systems, dragon egg dragons, by golly gosh
Toy store: Scars 'R' Us
For the bank allays, try putting a note block beneath them with a button that activates the note block. When you press the button they would throw items they're holding onto the note block
Doc has become a Dic-tator 🤣🤣🤣
The dictator joke made my jaw drop! Can’t believe he said that hahaha
How about a tcg area at the shop where you can buy packs and then go to the tcg arena
ScarToypia
9:07 was that intentional? lmao
Jellys emporium
Cub is stealing things from around the world without permission to put in his museum. He is the british museum.
Names for the toy shop:  Toys r scar or scartoys
Rock’s Toy Shop
DIC TATOR
"Scarlands little shop of wonders" is what my brain went to for the toy shop
Good
Imagine the shopping area having a PA system like the perimeter for stuff like new deals, announcements and stuff like that.
Ally jumpscare BOTTOM TEXT
Happy birthday scar! 🎉🎉🎉
Not terrifying at all, doc.  9:02
ToyScar Shop
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCAR!!
Name it Scarlands world of Whimsy 3:00
I love rollercoaster tycoon!!
“Doc has really become a dic……….tator” had me crying 😭
just this entrance if it were 8 years ago would be an absolutely insane mega base, its crazy how far people like you push the limits of building in Minecraft
Oxyzidation lol
There's this nintendo game that I have it's called like lego marvel something and the villian makes announcements and Doc sounds exactaly the same as him. The announcements are litteraly pointless but they add atmosphere.
"Doc has has really become a Dic...    tator"
What about naming the candy store ,  "Jelly's Candy and Sweets Consortium" ?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Thank you for making this Scar! That build looked amazing!
happy bday scar!
You could name the Toy Store "Leo's Toy Store" Like the Author of War and Peace, tho maybe a bit basic lol  Great video!
Happy birthday scar!
You should call the store Jellie Toys or Jimmy’s Toy Shop 😂
Prehaps the toyshop could be a fun pun with scar (as it should be) Something like Build-A-Scar! after Build-A-bear!
Lennys toy store
Thoughts on blasting "Build me up Buttercup" into the perimeter until Doc stops being a dic-tator?
Scar's Toy Barn
My 9 year old son thinks it should be called Jacobi’s Toy Shop  Jacob aged 9 😂. Loves your videos scar
Happy birthday Scar!!
an idea name for the toy shop could be 'The nether land' , like the promise of never land and the shop has a similar colour pallet to the nether.
The shop reminds me of the cheshire cat from Alize in Wonderland so I am proposing Cheshire's Cherishables
2:40 Snaughlent
DOC BECAME WHAT OF THE WHAT??????
17:30 Impulse slowly backing away as Scar follows with his maddened nerd rant 😂
A potential name for the toy shop: Mr Scarface (Or Hotguy) Wonder Emporium, a reference to the 2007 move, Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium
The Cookie-Cade, A doughy experience.
It‘s so funny how Scar gets annoyed by the recorded messages, since he did the very same thing to doc, when he first installed the Scarland opening and closing record system. The way he also never considered it to be the redstone entry for the parks redstone expert makes me laugh. I really am amazed on how far scar came with building this themepark , but seeing the petty squarrel between these neighbours is just so entertaining. XD
You could just paint docs flag that are facing Scarland..
Name the shop woody workshop
I would call the toy store: intertoys 😊
You should call it the Toy Multi-Story
toystore name : scar's select toy emporium.
Swaggons wonder emporium for toy shop
Cub is probably British
Love the entrance! You handsome genius!!!!
CALL IT TOYS SCAR US
The toy store should be called "The Toy Store-y"
I love how doc did the voice 😂❤
Happy birthday SCAR 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤💗🎂🎂💐🍫
The building could be called scars good times
Name for shop : Tickle Toys🐧
The crimson workshop would be a great name for the toy shop
Idea for your toystore: "Good Times with Toys"
2:20 noteblock goes brrrrr with allays
You should name the toy store: The fabulous fun factory!
Someone just has to build Scarland irl that would be so cool!!
Toys R' Scar
the best name for that store is definitely magical mischief
Scar please name the building as "Toys R Us" or Barbie Land o something along those lines! 😊
Maybe a name for toy shop would be something like … “Jellie’s dreams”
The juck box
Scars tinkering toy store
Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes but then in scar form like "scars silliness store"
the shop name Jellys magical toys
Name for the toy store: Toy Story!
9:08 load bearing "tator"
Scar, you are hilarious! You cracked me up so many times while watching this! Scarland looks absolutely amazing! Can't wait to see what you build in phase 2. This whole season of episodes has just been one gem after another! Well done!
Name idea for the toy shop what about Mystoyries? BTW i love your chaotic wholesomeness  and wholesome chaoticness scar
:)
9:06 why was there a 1 second delay😅😅
That was terrific! Scarland looks so beautiful and exciting!❤❤❤
Name for the toy shop, Timmy’s toy barn as a reference to the cross over
Your response to doc's megaphone thing was hilarious, nice save lol
A name for the toy shop could be Sheriff’s Toy Store, or something like that, to add some recognition to Jimmy!
scar... literally such an amazing video, I am loving scar land and can't wait to see where it will go throughout the rest of the season! here are my name suggestions for the toy store: Magenta Marvels Emporium Whimsiwood Toy Haven Scar's Playful Planks MystiMagenta Toy Shoppe Fabled Funland Treasures Scar's Whimsical Woodworks Majestic Magenta Toy Emporium Magenta Dreams Toy Boutique and also if it sounded cool, I feel like you could add like "Co." at the end of them
PURPLE EMPORIUM!
Docs announcements sounds like it came from the hunger games
For the toy store: Sca- Rus?? Like Toy- rus?? (sorry I can't remember how to spell it but the way how Grian can't ur name, the R is sometimes selected)
Timmy's toys store ? could be nice :)
I was chilling watching this video in the background and I hear “doc has really become a dic…. tator” and I literally spit out my drink. At 9:06
you shiould call the toy store "Toy Store - E" the E stands for Excellent        its also The pun on toy story.
I think the toy store should be the Toy Store-E
“Toys Sca’R Us” haha
Jimmy’s Not-A-Toy Store
Toy store name: a slice of life
I think you should name the toystore the Cheshire cat
The small gap between dictator😂😂😂
Toy shop name "Scarmleys" like hamleys but scar. Similar to how Disneyland became scarland
Have the toy store called Coral's Toy Spot. Coral could be the name of the shop owner, while fitting the theme of the shop. :)
The building looks like a Purple Popsicle to me
You should name the pink store Pinktastic Toys
Plum Primrose's Palace of Play
Happy birthday scar🎉🎉🎉🎉🎂🎂(in advance)
Judging from his reaction to Doc’s giant megaphone line, Scar discovered something about himself he didn’t know till then 😂
for your toy store:  Scarpetto's
You could call the toy store The Pink Playhouse
How about Toy Blocks or Buttercup Toys.
Elf Storage is a cute name for a toy store 👀
Doc's megaphone really got that frostpunk vibe in it
Almost forgot to say happy birthday to Jellie! (I think its her birthday today if I recall correctly, right?)
I think that for one of the buildings, you should let another Hermit set up their shop, just like there's a Starbucks in Disney Land
The toy store should totally be called Gurr’s Gizmos.
Toy Store E
Doc is a genius for the PA system  Hermitcraft's dictator indeed
We could always use “Timmy’s Toy Barn” lol.
You Dic-tator 😂😂
Maybe something like Terror-riffic Toys! Because the purple color scheme makes it seem a little spooky :P
Doc has really become a dic… tater  Good save, Scar
Warren's place as a reference to war and Peace by toilstoy
Can you name the toy shop scars r us like toys r us
For a PG show, Hermitcraft is getting edgy and I'm absolutely here for it.
Is there anyway grains arch can be moved in line with the entrance it hurts me that it isn’t in line
For the shop Timmy toy land
A Dic....tator  Scar, your humor never fails
2:53 Scarcade :D
"Thwikets and Things Toy Shop" maybe?
Please do one of the ore showers with gold
Clockwork Closet Toymakers
The purple Palace
For others to get showered, have it with an Elite Park Pass theyll get their own shower inserted into a shop xD
Please name the toy store Timmy’s Toys in honor of @SolidarityGaming 😂
A really fun way to fill scarland would be to offer for hermits to each build a ride for the park ☺️ maybe you could even make it a competition!
Store name:  tiny toys For big and small visitors of Scarland
Anyone else catch Doc's propaganda working at the end? "Our dear leader doc"?
How about Jimmy-jams toys. As a throwback from joining, (not) toy jimmys tumble town? (For the toyshop ofc)
It would be funny if your first roller coaster was in the perimeter... (Amazing job with the base btw!)
The Wumparium
2:44 the good time toy store or story
I would name the toy store  Timmy Toy Centre.  This comment does not intend to say Timmy is a toy.... At all
You should name the building the chester chesser shop
Scar land gify shop
"Jellie's Joys for Hobbyists and Boys"
Name the building after SolidarityGamimg. In memory of Empires S2 😂
Name suggestion: Jelly's Toys
9:10 uhhhhh scar?
How about the Jellie Catdny Shop?
Impulse and Scar are definitely my favorite duo. They don’t have a duo name yet ):
Can we just have a moment to appreciate how amazing all of Scars builds are like they are huge and crazy and so beautiful 13:59
You should name that building "Jellies Cat Toys" because Jellie is the mascot and it's a toy store.
Don't know if said already but. "Toy McToystore"
Shop Ideas: "Jellie's Yarn Stash" (Because of toys but also because the pink coral looks like yarn). "The Maroon Menagerie" "The Plum Promenade Toy Shop" "Dragon's Breath Toys" (because of the color of bottled dragon's breath) "Treats and Treasures"
The Doctator
scarlands wonderous binks ands bobs
Jellie Belly Toy Store
Name for the shop. Scar's tinker and trinkets
Day 78 of letting Scar know he is Absolutely Brilliant!
The toy store should definitely be named Toy Storey
Scar Land’s Toy Emporium
Scar-y Toys and Games
You need a speaker with singing, birds singing, happiness all the time - just as payback.
moon light toys or jelly belly toy store! great vid!
Call the toy store Toys Scar Us  It's probably in there already but ot came to mind (sry if I stole your idea)
Also, idea! Maybe you could have little allays that fly around looking for things people typically empty out of their inventory (dirt, seeds, paper?) Like little park custodians :)
Toy store: Shenanigans
Your toy store is beautiful!  And the castle in the distance looks incredible.
'Nick nack jelly cat' I thought this because some people call toys nick nacks
@GoodTimesWithScar I may be late to the party but the toy store??? Come now, has to be named with a Jelly theme lie Jelly's Play pin or jelly's litter box ;) what ever the name I am sure it will still be good.
The Jellie toy shop of Jellily greatness
Scarland's Toyland, Scars fun shop, fun & toys or Corner store for toys, could be some nice names for the toyshop 8n Scarland.
For the store maybe "Jolly Jelly"
store name: Toy Storieeee
"Doc has really become a dic-... tator!" SCAR
Your new friend - er, employee - seems great! I thought "Scars'R'Us" would be a good name for the toy store
Name it “Toys and Joys”
Loved the build! Is Toytanic too jinxy a name?
"Well hello there!" Hermicraft season 10, Scarbi-One Kenobi
Name the shop "the crimson extravaganza"
“GoodTimes with Toys” could be a good toy store name!!
I love the park entrance gate. Though I'm surprised to see it put so close to Grian's stone arch, since the arch kinda blocks the view of the gate exterior from a distance, and throws off the sense of alignment.
The name "Jellie's Toys and Trinkets" would be a great name for the toy store!
Scarland HC Toys
16:53 I will thrive you into the ground ;D Love you Scar, never change
Doc has become a WHAT
I feel like the name Good Times Toy Store sounds alright
Maybe Scars Spectacular Shop Of Toys? for the shop name
Happy birthday Jellie 🎉✨🌟💖
You know, it’s actually super cool that Doc is being such a tyranical person this season as it allows Scar to imagineer a ride that feature him as the villain. Disney parks have scarier rides themed with the disney’s villains, and Goat Father has effectively made himself an excellent  bad guy. And you know what’s cool? If his music disks play in the section of the park with the ride in it, it becomes SUPER thematic!
Toy store should be called Timmy's Toys
gary. gary the toy store.
9:05 a WHAT?!       OOOOH Dictator!
Fluffy Toy Store
I laugh everytime the GOAT speaks :D I've watched Doc doin it and seeing how the hermits react everytime it is activated is so so funny 😂 missed ur timelapse music Scar :) awesome build as always em also happy dat finally Scarland will come to reality 😁
You know  I haven't seen all your videos yet but I hope you have a candy store  called "Jelly Beans" and have the logo be one of Jelly's cat paws. Just think it would be cute  😻
Rosie’s toy shack, i think the name Rose will fit the color of the building
the toy store should be "GoodToysFromScar"
2 ideas for the toy store: Imagineering Emporium Fantasy Faire Toys
2:30 I think something like the SCARlet toy store
Give grian a job but make him be back builder
toy store... Toys r'us
just to tell you that you spelled slushies wrong I don't mean this in a mean way I am just pointing it out
9:07 What 🤣
When are the rides coming
"Doc has really become a dic.....tator"
2:45 name idea: scars toys and nick-nacks
name for the toy store  jellie+toy  tellie joy store or just j-oy store
9:05 Doc has become a what?!
Time for rides!!!! Roller coasters and dark rides ASAP
Could name the shop "Jellie's Toy box"? It sounds cute
for the toystore i got: scarsareus
You should name it either “Jellie’s Joy” or “Jellie’s Joy Shoppe”
Toy store name: Good Times From Scar
Good toys with scar
The toy store should be called the Jolly Jellie
Once the park is open, can we start peeing behind the flowers.
Good Times with Toy seems like a good choice for a the name
Toy store
Why does it not suprise me that you've played Bioshock. Epic immersive game!
So for the toystore, I've got some ideas:   There's a store I love in Disneyland called Disneyana. I'm thinking you could do something like Scarana?   Or a take on FAO Schwartz? JLY Scarland?
9:05 😏
Suggestion for the toy store, what if you name  it Toy Storey?
For your Ally problem, maybe have a dispenser under the counter, and when someone walks up to it, the dispenser spits out diamonds/emeralds? So it looks like the Ally is the one handing over the valuables, but it's actually the dispenser. You could either put a pressure plate in front of the counter or maybe a sulk sensor? Idk, I haven't messed around with sulk sensors that much.
the museum code of conduct: It belongs in a-
09:05 Scar why did you pause when you said the first half dictator?
Impulse sounded so happy to be the Redstone Handyman. Almost it's like a dream job he's always wanted.
That goat is arrogant.
"all perfectly lined up"  except for grian's arch
The amount of times scar got scared this episode was hilarious 😂
Timmy toys
The Oro Jackson from one piece. Same color. Also I love the videos and can’t wait to get more!!!
Jellie's toy box
Name it "The Toy-Blocks"
Call the toy store: Mr Scar's Wonder Emporium
The name for the toy store i would recommend is "Jellie's Toy Box" or "Scar's Toy re-imagine"
Hey scar, might I suggest that you embed and conceal some lighting under the edges of the pathways so as to prveent mobs spawning.
Name for the toy store: Toy Barn.
Jelly’s Jolly or Joyful toy emporium 2:52
Toys r scar
For the Toy Store: Toy Store E
9:05 the jokes Scar somehow gets away with on this channel istg
name for the shop: Scar's trinkets and shenanigans
Make for toy store:  Toy Store-ee
“Purple Play & Plush Palace”
Scars R us
Timmy's toy store is a good reference for the shop Or Joel's toy barn
It would be so funny if scar banned doc from scarland
I think you should name the toy shop Timmy’s toy store because jimmys a toy so yeah and it will link the the cross over with the empires lot
For the allay shower thing: ask each of the hermits to have one of their loyal allays, making sure they are primed to pick up item you want to shower?
what about "scar or us"?
"Scars magical Fun store" would suite it, concidering the crimson block pallette
For the allay's if you put a note block in front of/underneath them then if someone else hits it the allay will shower the note block, so it could work like an atm, hit the note block, get the cash shower
Scar please I am begging you to light up the park! Maybe its a job for the cleaning lady or maybe you need a security officer but please do something the mobs are stressing me out
9:10 LOOOOOL SCAR I LOVE YOU NEVER CHANGE PLEASE😂😂😂😂
Its shame that the entrance a little blocked by grians giant rock gate
Good times in Scars Wonder Emporium for the toy store 😊
For the shop, you can name it toy store-e like shadyee so it sounds like toy's story
Doc is sounding more and more like General Di Ravello from Just Cause 3
The Shop Name Idea... Scarland Gify Shop
For the toy store "Toys Scar Us"??
Hi Scar I can imagine you have recreated the arch of Ctesiphon , old Persian Capital city . Good stuff keep it flowing . Doc is outright violating your privacy with his announcements put on auto-run
Doc becoming a supervillain.... the next scene might be a powerpuff girls theme fight Hahaha
Wow
Store name idea Jellie Up
Scar pronounces dictator in a way
i got an idea for a wishing fountain sorta like iskalls treasure island a few seasons ago! people could throw in diamonds or emeralds and then get a random item back, could be fun:) Gambling never fails to attract people lmao, and it'd be a project for impulse
The first thing that came to mind... Redwood emporium
Plushy Paradise maybe???
The toystore building should be called the purple paradise, its purple and toystores are paradises no matter your age :)
The toy store could be called The Cat Toy? Kind of poor, but I’m bad with naming things, lol.
WOW Scar, that Entrance is phenomenal, great job, and that Roof is beautiful. 11/10
“Scars-R-Us”
scarland toy heaven
Toys Scar Us?
Toy Stor-E
The Toy Toilet
Name it specks toys
you should name it Mr Scartorium's wonder emporium, base of the 2007 film mr magorium's wonder emporium
For the toy store, I was thinking Scar R Us. Also because it rimes.
"The pink princess" looks like a nice toy shop name.
Name it Toy Stor(e)y 🌚
Scartorium gotta be the name
I never noticed how off-centre Grian’s rock entrance was Scarland until now
What's the Super Fast Build Mode song called, y’all? (at 13:00) I really want to hear more like it!
Beetroot store (you see, its funny because it doesnt sell beets)
Scars scrappy toy store
u should sell some toy jimmys js as a joke
9:07 doc has really become a dik… tator😁
"Miss./Mrs. Jellies' wonder emporium" Might be a cute name for the toy store <3
"do toy with me" is an idea that came to mind for the toy store, I think it sounds welcoming and is a play on a common phrase :)
The toy shop should be called 'Mischief Managed'  you should also put a sign saying 'Become you inner Grian' Nice video as usual, I think Scarland is the best build on the server!
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium
The park is so beautiful, whenever I see it or imagine the rides to come I always imagine the movie "wonder park". Great work as always scar!
Scar, I'm dubbed with notifications on and am not getting notified when you upload. Just thought I'd let you know.
Toy store-i 2:40
Scar you should call the toy store 'Toy scar us' like Toys'R'us
Scar's toy chest! Would be a great name for the toy store
For the toy shop. You could call it the mysterious toys
To name that building, could it be maybe the “Rouge Room” or the “Blush Building”?
How about commissioning other Hermits to build their own roller coaster in the park with whatever theme they want?
Crimson chin
MAKE GRIAN MOVE THAT ARK FEW BLOCKS LEFT PLEASE, IT MAKES ME CRAZY
since you named an area of hermitcraft after your old survival world, i only think it is fair you remake the birch house on the hermitcraft server or the mother tree frame, one of the two
Andy’s As it’s a toy store and Andy owned the animated toys in Toy Story!
I bet Doc is having his villain arc rn frfr
Your right about the first part of what you call doc.
im so happy for scar this is like the mans dream and minecraft made it possible
Retaliation Idea against Doc:  An active aspect of psychological warfare used at the Korean DMZ includes South Korea blasting K-Pop Music across the border with North Korea. Perhaps the Buttercups should set up stereos playing...Hermit-Pop (H-Pop)? Buttercup-Pop (B-Pop)?
9:06 Doc is becoming a what??
GREAT TOY WITH SCAR
Toy store name idea: Twilight Town - I am late but I wanted to say it anywaysss
Scarbie's Main Street Dreamhouse
Hmm.. maybe Good Times Toy Store
This is incredible. I find theme parks pretty overwhelming irl, but when the world download for this season comes out it’s gonna be so fun to just hang out in scarland with all these cool builds
a cool name for the toy story would be "mayor scar's magical emporium" as a nod to mayor scar :)
For the toy shop name, how about - Whiskering Whimsies Wonder Emporium? Or something to that end? It definitely gives me mysterious, Diagon Alley kind of vibes, love how the project's come along!
Couldn't stop smiling with this video, Scar always knows how to brighten the mood!
Scar land of toy's I think would be good
Toy Store name suggestions: "Scarland's Magical Playland:"  "Scaraway Toys - Where imagination meets creation!" "Scarland's Palace of Play"
house of voodoo toystore
Maybe the toy store can be "Good Times from Scar"
the store should be called Leo's Toy Store. This is inspired by the joke made in the Peanuts movie, where a books is called loe's toy store by warren peace, when it was supposed to by war and peace by leo tolstoy
9:05 I literally spat out my drink.. that's super out of context if got clipped.
That store looks like it should be named the Haunted Masion
Potential shop name: Timmy's Treasures Or Timmy's Toys
I think "Toy storey" is a good name for the toy store
"Topsie Turvery Toys" is my suggestion--a delightful tongue twister for that exudes joy! :D
Toy tower
Name it “Jellie’s Jolly Junk”
Man’s didn’t even notice the pane of pain
Home Alone Toys!
Lol what about "Toys scaR's Us"
9:05 Oh, man.  I haven't laughest that ahrd in a while. A little warning would have prevented gingerbeer going the wrong way through my nose.
Jellie Donut Toys should be th re name of the toy store.
thank you
"It's Doc's world, you just live in it"
14:30 oxadadation 🤣🤣
Scars-R-Us
Doc's loudspeaker concept is so cool! Maybe you could have screams play whenever a roller coaster has a drop or a loop?
The toy shop is giving me Wily Wonka vibes. Give it some sort of whimsical name, like "Superlative Scar's Fantastical Toyland"
Hey! The museum stole the purple trolley I suggested when you asked for ideas... as the idea souce please get that one back. Maybe a forgery in its place? Because the museums are pulling some 'brittish museum of history' stuff just taking things like that.
Jellie's Toy Chest! Homage to Jellie (obviously) and to Home Alone
Nice video 👍
9:06 Scar you can;t keep getting away with it at this point you know what you say
God, if this is main street, wait till he makes each theme park. Gotta love it. This season will not end until Scar is done with Scarland. I cannot wait fo the rides
*Big Goat is always watching*
The Maroon Mangrove Menagerie of Magical Misfits and Miscreants
3:37 He is the British. Just going around stealing stuff
with Impulse you just get umpulse.but if you had hires doc you would've gotten the while hive mind. look at what he could've done to your sound system😂😂😂😂😂 Jr love you Impluse
The “Tinker drawer toy store”
The Topsy Turvey Toy Store
You should do something with chromia to pay homage to when smajor97 was staying in Scarland.
OK! Here my out!! I think the name should be called “Funny Wabbit Warren Emporium”. A word play on “silly rabbit” to bring a lightheartedness but also for us older folk who know trick are for kids. So it calls to childish wonder; it’s has a nostalgic reference. And then “Warren emporium” because a rabbits home is called a Warren and emporium is a spectacle of invention and toys! Just a thought!🙏🏽✨
“Andy’s Place” for the Toy Store!
the toy store should be names Scar's R Us! Kinda like toy's R us but Scar!
Please name the toy store Jimmy III
The toy shop should be called “Timmy’s Toy Shop”
Scar's toy barn
for the toy store name, instead of FAO Schwarz(famous toy store in New York), name it GTW Scharz
You guys should put some funny music that drowns out Doc's announcement.
Name the toy store "Jellie's Toy Chest"
Wow very nice
Toy store name ideas: Scars-R-Us Scars toy barn
Name idea: Build-a-Scar Toy Shop
Excellent
Ok ok hear me out “Timmy’s Toy Place”
"Doc has really become a dic                                                                                                                               tator of this perimeter"
You should get a rabbit stew or any stew and rename it goat curry and leave it in the goat's Base.
Toy Store: "Jelli's Amazing Imaginarium"
draginfruit fir the tiy store
good time toys
a spin off of Mr. Magorium's wonder Emporium: Mr. Scarorium Wonder Emporium
love tower for the bulding beacuse its red and pink
what if you name the toy store jimmy toy barn. he he he
You should call the toyshop: "Jimmy's Toyshop" as reference to Sollidarity😂 Great video again Scar, love al the progress. I am a simple man, I see a Scar upload, grab my snacks and drinks and take a break from what I am doing.
sooooo talented!!!
Doc’s speaker sounds like something straight out of the USSR. Horrifying.
The toy store should be called Toys R You
I kind of wanted Doc to be the redstone engineer. He practically made the PA system as his application.
Name it Tango's Toys
Imagenta Toy shop?
Name the toy store "Goodtoyswithscar"
Scar is really going crazy over the doc messages LOL
I would call the toy shop : "We do not have rollercoasters but we do have gift shops $$$"
Its crazy I watched you for many years now, and you just keep impressing with your builds, WOW
This one is for Pokémon fans : Blast Toy's as the name for the toy store. Store where you sell any kind of toys but of course have to sell water typed toys (water guns, water balloons, etc). You could have a Jellie disgused as Blastoise plushie as the main sellpoint of your store!
Pearl build an amazing dragon in the middle of a warzone.   I hope Grian will let u take down the portal thing
That speaker reminded me of bioshock. I miss that game ;-;
Imagine walking through scarland in vr
Scars toys and knick knacks for the toy store name
No way scar actually just called doc that 9:05
The poor allay trying to keep up with scar showing off the enterance
Jellie's Toy Box
Scarland is looking so beautiful..😍😍😍😍i wish i could visit Scarland IRL..
Name it AL’s barn
You should name the hotel.... hotel storage?!?
So excited for stage 2 of Scarland!
You have to call the toy shop. The sheriff's Toytown because of the work you did in the Crossover with empires.
use x's david copperfield...the best copper ager there is
Name idea: Jello’s Toy Box.
Timmy’s Tumble Town Toys for the toy shop and a throwback to the Empire crossover. 2:43
Call the toy store "Two Story"!
The toy shop should be called Scar and Jellie's Wonderful World of Toys (might need multiple signs I'm not sure)
toy shop name: Jellie's Toys & Joys!
Toy store name idea, Playful Purple Palace.
Jellie's Jollies Toy Emporium
"Scarto" is the name.
9:05 doc has really become.... WHAAAT NOW?   ..oh
dic...tator..
9:07 smooth
Doc has realy become a dic               Tator of this parameter
Good Toys With Scar
I vote Scar's Toy Barn
Toy store name: Tinker Central
hey scar, i don't know how far you've planned scarland thus far and i understand if you want your ideas to be entirely original, however i think a pirate ship attraction could look awesome!
15:29 360° no scope
Toys N Scars
"Jellie's Jamboree" for the toy store?
the toy store should be called scoy store
For the toy store - “Scaroo Toys” (pronounced scar-oo)
Some store ideas Good Times with Toys Jelly's Toy Chest
Bobs Toys
The name of the toy store should be “SCAAAARED for toys!”
Milo's Mystic Toyhouse    Also docs announcements gave me shivers down my spine
9:10 a what
you can put a noteblock wit a pressure plate or something where you want someone to stand for the diamonds/emeralds
What about mumbo
9:06 you got me. You got me good. I love you so much :D:D:D:D
The fact that scar can implement dirt to the lining of the entrance and still make it look good baffles me.
The entrance is cool =) Doc's psychological attacks are 100% working, lol
"Doc. is a dic....tator" -GoodTimesWithScar 2023
Diamond shower and emerald shower? What about gold ingets? Lol.
It has to be "Timmy's Toystore" 😂 A reference to Empires SMP
“Fuchsia fun” might be good for the building? Some alliteration
The toy store should be called "Evil Jellie's Imaginarium"
Mr. Scargorium's Wonder Emporium
A potential name for the toy store: The Evil jellies Toy store
9:06 My favourite pg youtuber (I called you silky on tt please forgive me I was putting silly)
Scar seriously called Doc a "dic-tator." So NSFK
The toy store should be Jim's Toy Barn!
dic tator
Doc makes for such a great evil overlord, like that announcement was actually chilling. Love it.
I love all the different angles in superfastbuildmode. The one under the arch was really awesome. The sun perfectly in line? *chefs kiss* perfect!
Might be a fun prank to sabotage Doc's announcements with some of your own, as advertisements for Scarland! And a 50% off deal on Buttercup cookies at the conveniently placed pop-up shop.
Housey McHouseface
2:39 It's a toy store? Then here's a good one. There was a store called KB Toys for many years.  You should name it SJ Toys. (SJ stands for Scar and Jellie.)
Now only Gem as Head of Security is missing from the Soup Group
"Bundles of Joy" (Toy Shop)
I instantly thought of toy store(y)
Scar'R'us? Sca'R'us?
To much phasmo has made scar a little jumpy when stuff floats by
You should make a custom music disc with Gideon’s song: The Buttercups and play it super loud next to the perimeter 😈
You should name it the Purple Power Tower
It honestly feels like Doc is just tricking you guys into building a bunch of beautiful stuff around the perimeter.
Looks like Scar got "scarred for life" when he heard The Great GOAT King over The Perimeter P.A. system.
Name for the shop: Scar's Scar-tastic Toy Emporium
Welcome Doc to Scarland, or was it imp? Anyways, I love the automated announcements in Hermicraft!!!
tots for toy
@13:06 horse dancing to this jam
jellys dreamland
Playstation
You  could name it tim toys just for the laugh
It's gorgeous! I think it'd be fun to name the toy store Jellie's Joyland (alliteration but it also sounds like Toyland!)
Toy store should be “Hot guys secret toy emporium”
Gleeful Things Toy Store
How about the magician’s toy shop? It looks very mysterious and filled with curious memorabilia 🫶
Hearing scar swears quite nice
There's nothing like a creepy German dictator. 🤨
You said Bioshock, I thought Fallout! Ha!
The toy store should be called Scarland Games and Amusements Co. Sounds like a really fun name!
"The dear leader, Doc" Jim Pickens has entered the chat
I had a room on a server. Just filled it up with redstone that functioned like this: You walk in, step directly at a pressure plate, you get pushed out the way you came by a slime block piston, and then from seemingly nowhere you get a baked potato. I had a dispenser/dropper(forgot which) on the inside of the wall (invisible from the outside) and when that popped out an item into a block the item just plopped through
You can ask mumbo about designing a ATM that the hermits can use in the park.
I have the PERFECT name for the toy shop! The ‘Enjoy more, Toy store!’
The Magenta Mansion feels like a nice name for the Toy Store
Scarland makes me so happy, I’m loving the journey and the nostalgia with the Disneyland vibes 😊
Doc is taking after his ancestors💀
Doc's megaphone voice sounds like the puppet on "Saw/Jigsaw" Series
Absolutely incredible I’m so excited, I love the theme park so much!!!!
Toy Storey 3, obviously
call the shop ''mini museum'' - ziur
Why did I get president snow vibes from doc? Should totally do the hermit games and scar can be katniss 😂
I've been thinking of going through the Hermitcraft S6 and 7 world downloads and just wanna say that I'm really excited for the S9 one since I'll actually be able to enter Scarland and have a wander around for myself :)
Hey scar The name could be Jelly’s ToyBox
“THAT STUPID DIC———TATOR” LOL good one scar
I don't know why but the "Thank you" having some upper case letters and some lower case letters makes me shutter!  Otherwise,  Absolutely amazing builds as always.
I like how you rescued the fairy things just to lock them back up to feed you diamonds and emeralds lmao
You should add another floor to the toy shop and call it Toy Storey and maybe put @solidaritygamings head for sale.
new life
head store Very good name
Had a little chuckle when you said about doc being the dic…. Tator 😂
Name: Alice in scarland
I don't have any ideas for what to name the toy shop, but you definitely need to be stocking those shelves with a patented Sheriff Jimmy plush!
Popy play time
Probably too late for a Toy Store name suggestion, but I think it’d be cool to call it “Toys Scar Us” lol
Everybody! Altogether now! A-one, a-two, a-one-two-three-four!  It's a Scar world after all  It's a Scar world after all  It's a Scar world after all  It's a Scar, Scar world!  As Doc has sowed, so shall he reap...
Grand gifts of scarland
Name the toy store timmys toys
Cracked up laughing at your comment on Doc... 'Doc has really become a Dic-tator of this perimeter.' Good one Scar.
for the toy store, if it wasnt copy right: Toy Storey (Toy Story)  just add the "e" for Store :)
Shop name : Scarland’s Kooky Clockworks Toys  Me: ChickenSlave27  Comments: feel that Scarland needs something kinda Kooky or Silly. Thank you for the opportunity to suggest in your artwork. Love the transformations, tragic turns, and funny gags. Keep this series going please.
Name for the toy store something along the lines of "Sheriff Timmy's/Tim's Chest" or "The Sheriff's Toy Chest". Fun little nod to the crossover and would really get under his skin.
Name: scar's magic & joy
Jellie's emporium! ❤
You should call the toy store scarsRus
Toy Store Name: Mr. Scargorium's Wonder Emporium!
14:09 Oh no... The flags... Every building has the wind going in a different direction... Hey, at least it's consistent within each individual building 😅
8:00 why nobody use Xisuma Pixelriffs David Copper Monstrosity?
name one an icecream scarlour
Good toys by Scar :)
You could name the store: Toy'd for life.
Call the toy store "empires emporium" or "Tim's Toys" after Solidarity.
1:00 oh my gods, the armour stands are still messed up! Pearl!!
it shop be the andises toy store Cose u lick Disney refines
Honestly, I'm not trying to armchair diagnosis Scar or anything, but I am autistic and hearing Scar exitedly infodump about the history of theme parks just really makes me happy. As an autistic woman, its like talking to someone in a second language, then they suddenly swap over to my native tongue. The way he talks about theme parks just feels a lot more similar to the conversations I have with my autistic friends & that really makes me happy.
why do't you put a pecs love and plants banner in the goats base?
Build and Play
This is awesome, I can't wait to see the gate in action! <3
9:07 hmmm
You should name the toy store "Timmy's Little Cowboys"
just calling Doc a Dic (tator), typical Scar things
You should call the toy shop jelly’s toy emporium
You could name the toy shop Dr Scargorium's Wonder Emporium
2:16 did he leave those diamonds to despawn
For the chop witchly toy?
Scar! You Could Call The Mysterious Toy Shop; "Super Scar Silly Souvenir Store" Or A Variation Of Something Like That! Love Your Videos, Keep Up The Great Work, And Just Know That You Always Manage To Cheer Me Up No Matter What! ❤❤❤❤
19:51 he saved himself 💀💀
Jellie Toys: Get your slime toys here
FAO Scars!
Name it Leo’s toy store as a reference from Charlie Brown
The allays will drop at note blocks.
Hmm I think the toy store name should have something to do with toy story
Hoooo boy. Scar, I love your content, but I think you and Grian have forgotten that you started all this... ah well, the drama is deeply entertaining. I look forward to your next act of escalation!
For the allays  Pressure plate  to dropper or dispenser, an allay near to simulate experience, ...and a good joke if it's golden ingots
The purple nurple😅
"Doc has really become a DIC-tator" xD
9:06 Im sorry what
Scar, it's still missing attractions...
What an amazing entrance to Scarland!  Great job!  I think the building should be called "The Jellie Jar Toy Shop" because it immediately looked like a jelly jar to me, and it is "Jam packed with gifts and toys to make every kid's playtime even sweeter"!  :)
YIPPEE SCARLAND GIANT ENTRANCE!!! It looks fantastic I want to run around it…also YAY IMPULSE HANDYMAN!!!
The building should be named Pink Palace Toy Store
I can NOT wait for all the Hermits to get together for a screen shot of the fireworks going off around this amazing Castle!!! I love this community and all the amazing builds and bonds that are formed, please do not ever stop doing what ya'll are doing!!!
scar is minecraft's walt disney
I hope scar adds rides
Do you have a copy or by number three on the first Minecraft bill do you ever done when your first purchase Minecraft?
I have a work around for the allays item water fountain:  Items list:  x2 note blocks x4 comparators x2 lecterns x2 written books with 15 pages in them x2 target blocks x2 calibrated skulk sensors x8 wool blocks water bucket (will need to refill at step 9)  1. Dig 2 blocks below the allay and place a note block  2. To the left/right of the note block (depending on the side of the building you are working on. Left of the building builds left, right builds right) place a comparator pointing into the note block  3. Place another comparator to the  back of the building pointing into the comparator from step 2.  4. Place a lectern to the back of the comparator from step 3.  5. In the lectern, place a book with 15 pages. Flip the book to page 2 of 15. If the comparator from step 3 isn't lighting  up, it is pointing the wrong direction.   6. To the left/right of comparator from step 2, place a target block.  7. To the left of the target block, place a calibrated skulk sensor (cal. sensor) with the purple strip pointing into the target block. Waterlog the cal. sensor to prevent the skulk sensor noises.  8. 1 block above the cal. sensor, Place 4 wool blocks around the cal. sensor to the frond, back, left, and right. There should be an air block above the cal. sensor.  9. Repeat steps 1 to 8 for the opposite side of the building   And that's it. To activate the item fountain, simply walk up to them and jump. Unfortunately,  the allays will continuously drop their items at least 9 times (depending on how many times you jump).  If you have the allays on a lead, place the fence below the note block.  Hope this is helpful!
TOY STORE NAME SUGGESTION: They Mystic Nook of Toys
Kitty Tonta
The toy shop should be called "Scars R Us"
Toy Store name idea: "Timmy's Tumble Town"
"Doc has really become a dic... tator-" SIR???????
Having read 1984, I can't keep making the connection between Doc and Big Brother.
How about an homage to Toy Story, of Al's Toy Barn- to Scar's Toy Barn? Or something along those lines? :D
my partner and I agree that you should name the toy store Sophie
Good times with toys
scar if you wouldve investigated docs speaker system more, you couldve very easily located the music discs and removed them from the machine which he built as both a prank and his application for the redstone job for scarland. because it uses range features that can reach the entirety of your base, mumbos base, and grians
you should definitely call the toy store Toy Store-y (a play on words of Toy Story if anyone is confused)
Scar scar!! You can leave the trolley at the Museum and turn it into a butter cup store for passers by. maybe sell other nick knacks too.  Bahahahaha "Thrive you into the ground!!" struck me in a very funny way.
I’m so glad you picked Impulse!  I watched his video and he seemed truly passionate about doing it!
“Jellies Paw-Palooza” or “Jellies Funhouse”? Jellies Cat tree perhaps? And maybe call the restroom the Litterboxes
9:05 Ok, I try to give Scar the benefit of the doubt... But that had to be intentional!
9:06 out of context
The Dragon's Hoard toy store
So happy to see Impulse get the job! At this point, you've got 2/3 of the Soup Group on payroll - you could complete the set with Gem! Maybe as a security officer? :)
Toy store name suggestion: Scar Story
Name the toy store Kids Emporium or treasure trove. And i think you should name the part of scarland where there are rides funtopia. And i think you should build an arcade and name it world of fun(arcade in the Philippines) or gamer's paradise or the den of games or the players hub. Your videos are amazing, entertaining and so funny. Keep up the good work.
Wait i cant remember, is there a medical center in the theme park yet? If not you should totally make one, like half for hermits and the other have for creatures and pets or something, what if something happens to Jellie :( lol
If only the statue of Jelly and you was centered on both of you, not just Jelly. You should shift it half a block to the right.
13:12 that horse in the bottom right was doin' a lil spinny spin lmao
You could call the toy store "Good Times From Scarland"
I think the name of the store should be Timmy's Toy Store
Jellie’s Toy Barn!!!! like Al’s Toy Barn in Toy Story?? What do we think???!
Can’t wait for Scars first rollercoaster. Masterpiece doesn’t quite describe the work done in ScarLand thus far, Amazing work Scar.
You could name your toy shop Scar’s enchanted emporium
9:06 a dic.... 👀 tator
Toy store name: Good Times Toy Store
Scar, you should name the toy store ‘Jimmy’s’ I loved the video btw!!!<3 am super proud of you :]❤❤
I think the toy store should totally be named the Plastic Menagerie,  Mainly because i saw the building and went "thats a place that would be named a Menagerie."
"the park doesn't accept children" says owner of theme park
How did he not realize where the announcements are coming from?? The giant speakers you were standing on!!! There’s even signs!!!!
You should name the toy store, The Mystic Plushies
Name for toy shop, Scars  Scarr-ific stuffys!
The Magenta Mementos in honor of the Memento Mori at Magic Kingdom for the toy shop.
The toy shop should be  Mr.MeScariums Wonder Emporium
jimmys toy barn from empires
Toy Storey
The toy store should be called: Jolly Jelly’s Toystore
THE GOOD TOY STORE🎈🐈
Mystery Misfit Toys!
Would it be going too far to collect enough obsidian to pave over the perimeter completely? Imagine the mobs....lol Or reenact Tango's trick from Season 8 by blowing out part of the bedrock and using the paintings to camouflage the hole.
for the name of the building i was gunna say al’s toy barn because toy story but i want it to be scars toy barn or something similar to that
"Magenta Maelstrom" could be a cool name for the shop! A maelstrom is a powerful whirlpool that could suck in all the customers and it's magenta of course
your repeated references to turnstiles made me think of Napoleon LeRoach from Spy Fox 2: Some Assembly Required and his turnstile obsession.
you should name it "scars toy barn" as a referance to "als toy barn from toy story"
The scale Scar builds on is insane. He even did the back of the entrance just for Grian.
Can I just point out the sign that says emeralds is the one with diamonds and the sign that says diamonds gives emeralds.....
Name the toy store: scarstore come today!
i had a feeling you were going to pick the redstoner that you picked, but i was sort of hoping you would fake us all out and pick Bdubs, master redstoner.
how about Toys Scar Us for the toy store?  it doesn't work as well when it's written down lol
Jellie's wonder emporium
There was an old branch of the toy shop we used to have in South Florida in city place. It used to have a big teddy bear with ABC building toy blocks in the upstairs of the building surrounded by windows so the people outside could see the bear. It might have been a branch of a mega toy shop from New York called (F.A.O. SCHWARZ). You could also use the old (Toys “R” Us) brand for the store or maybe go home alone style with (Duncans toy chest) but maybe replace the name Duncan with scar, it’s just a thought.
my cousin actually works at Disney as an engineer and was on a one day at Disney episode
Comment for the algorithm
Another beautiful build, with a cursed horse.
Honestly love your vids so much, never fail to put a smile on my face, keep doing what your doing as it's amazing and especially keep being you ☺️   Possible name idea for your toy shop in Scarland: Jellies4Us
This entire episode was hilarious! Love the look of the entrance to Scarland! As a suggestion for the toy shop - perhaps “Timmy’s Toy Shop” 👀
Absolutely flabbergasted that Cub has become an honorary Brit
Scar this is insanity you are so amazingly talented. ❤
Colab with AvidMC
Scar: "Doc has really become a dic-" Me: *MY EYES WIDE OPEN IN SHOCK* Scar: "-tator of this world." Me: *phewww*
Me "I need to go to bed." Brush my teeth, go onto the bedroom.  Opens youtube to find a chill podcast to fall asleep to. "oh, a scar video." Guess I'm going to bed in 23 minutes..
The toy store should be Jim’s Jammin’ Toys 😂 for jimmy
"Jimmy's toy store" would be a great name
Don't let Disneyland see this lol 😅😂 are you gonna to add a french quarter and some theme rides?
Scar's Wonder Emporium for the toy store!
You gotta name the toy store JimmyJacks. Tribute to the toy once lost.
jellies jackpot toy shop
Here are some names for the store -Terry’s Toy Box -Happy Hermit Toy Store -Good Toys with Scar
Toy shop oughta be called Mahogany Trains - They make handcrafted wood trains and other toys!
Name the toy store Jellies toy box
"Learnt trigonometry to build that roller coaster" Yeah... sounds like something id do too 😔
Timmy's Toy Trading Post
Hey scar there is this hardworking small youtuber called @AvidMC who would love to collab with you, please make it happen
scarlet toy shop
You should install ticket booths outside the entrance
The shop could be called Jellie's Joy Floor Toy Store
Ik would name it, ScArcade Toys. What do you think? Love your vids man. ❤
Ok, so, dumb idea, but name the toy shop 'Mys-toy-rious', because it's a mysterious toyshop.
“Sherrif Jimmy’s Toy Store” for the toy store seems like a nice name to remember the crossover event
Jimmy's Toy Emporium
Name the toy store Tumble Town, in honor of the Toy Sheriff :D!  9:05 Nice one
Good times with Toyland for a toy store name
I would love to visit Scarland cause it's truly AMAZING!!!! Seriously Scar it's unbelievably good. I'm in awe of all the thought & detail you've put into everything. 💕
Perhaps for the name "Jelly & Jimmy's Jambouree"? I think that would be a cute way to tie some more into scarland?
TreasureTrove Toys or Toy co Would be cool with a pirate theme.
I think the velvet emporium would be a cool name for the toy store. or something with velvet in the name
toy store idea i had on a whim: Griotte, simply because it looks like dark red cherries ("gri- yot")
A potential way to get everyone the diamond and emerald showers, if you don't mind placing a pressure plate where they step to get these, place a noteblock underneath and set up a redstone clock of some sort to keep it playing (thus the allays  attracted to it) and have the pressure plate activate said clock. This way, the allay will throw the diamonds/emeralds at the player standing on the noteblock.   @ImpulseSV, redstone guy, you could totally rig sth up like this
The store should be called "toy stor-e" which can be read as toy store or toy story
The second you mentioned the handicap parade spot and said “for our disabled friends” I started crying🥹  Us disabled people can finally enjoy a parade :D  I’ve never been to a parade since i was little due to them being inaccessible! So this makes me so happy 🥹❤️ I can just picture hearing “Here in Scarland we strive for inclusivity!” Thank you Scar, from the bottom of my heart ❤❤❤ OH AND FOR THE TOY STORE NAME! “Jellie’s Toy House” (btw your off-road wheelchair seems SO FUN!)
doc sounded like a textbook supervillain when he said 'its the goats world, youre just living in it 😈'
The build should be called ken. Why?. 1. It's pink 2. It's a toy store 3. Scar is kenough!
The toy shop should be named after everyone's favourite little Toy.  Timmy's Toy Chest
Scar you should name your toy store The Crimson Carousel
You should put a Hawk guy Themed area in Scarland.
Toy storey cpuld be a good name
I have a name for the toy shop ...... THE CRIMSON CRAFTERS toys for you ....... Also I'm a rlly big fan this was my little sisters name idea she thought of it while watching the video also ty for being an amazing youtuber you along with all the other hermits you save me from boredom every day
I'm so happy you're making your dream build, one of the many things to make this a truly memorable season! So excited for what's to come 🤩
That looks like Jimmy and Timmy's Toy Shop
I can't wait to visit scarland too!
Jellies R us
I'm sure The Goatfather will be thrilled to hear how much you are enjoying his Broadcasts 😁
untamed allays with noteblocks?
"Sheriff Timmy's Toy Store" to honor how much Timmy embraced his toy-hood
tagolin tongue twister toyshop. as a name for the toyshop
Great build Scar! ❤🎉
How about The Toy Stor-y lol.
You should call that building Top Hat Crafts
Are the hermits still gonna build a statue for TFC ??
You should name the toy store. Jimmy's World or Jelly land
On Impulse’s GUI, be sure to uncheck mowing lawns, or else he’ll waste all his time mowing the lawn.
You should definitely refer to ImpulseSV as “Handyman 1” to his face and see how he reacts
Toy shop name idea: Can the toy shop in Scarland be called "Jelppetto's Workshop" like Geppetto's Workshop from Pinocchio combined with Jellie.
Man, I can’t believe doc is being such a dic—tator
I think the toy store should be named “Jimmy’s Toy Store” in honor of the toy man himself
Toy store A... I dunno but gave my best x)
Grian: "No scar it's fine" what he really meant: "No scar please no" (: just the way he said it was absolutely hilarious
Is he gonna add rides to Scarland?
In theme parks there are ALLWAYS a ride that is under maintenance or construction, and it is so irritating, so remember to build something like that. It is a part of any park. 😂
Probably a really bad name but Jellie at Heart Toy Shop. Btw i love your videos scar.
Remember to add lots and lots of parking spaces
Toy store name: Jellies Toy Emporium
Enchanter's Cavern (the pink and purple gives that vibe)
The toy shop should be Timmy toy town or store 😊
Doc has really become a dic -tater... Lol
Scar you cant go wrong with then name "Toys Galore"
Name the toy store GoodTimesWithToys!
Placing a block behind Scarland and Thank You will make them easier to read. Enjoy all of your video's and the style of building and interactions you have. Keep scarring the world. :D
since the park itself is populated, it would be cool if you had Cleo make some employee armor stands Imaginers, custodians and redstone engineers to populate the backstage area.
9:05 that’s definitely going in the next out of context video
Joy store Toy store
I don't understand the dirt method.  Dirt isn't renewable. It should be more valuable than something you can easily farm.  Unless you are in favor of strip-mining huge areas. Especially on a server that allows TNT duping. It also means you'll be switching to an extra tool frequently which is annoying.
Toy Store name. Nethers knickknacks.
I mean F.A.O. Scars comes to mind right away
You should make all of the flags Jellie coloured like the balloons
“Dream-Makers Toyshop”  Where ScarLand makes your dreams come true.
Cub really just pulled a British Museum here
Does anyone else wish Scar had the resources or team to build a real life ScarLand?
Scar, you make me cry of joy and awe when you build! When the world download is released I must make sure to be alone, because the tears will be abundant! You keep giving and we keep receiving, and I am so very grateful. Thank you. <3
This just made me like scar and impulse even more😢❤❤❤
SCAR!!!!!!! YOU CAN'T JUST SAY 'dic' *long pause* 'tator' JUST LIKE THAT!!!! AHHAHJAS IT FEELS SO CURSED. SHOULD'VE GODDAMN EXPECTED IT HAHSASHJH. Also now i understand why you were terrified in Pearl's video. Those audios ARE horrifying. Wow. I feel like I'm in a dystopic movie. Also, now you get how they felt with your park announcements every day AHSASHJHASD And wow..... that entrance...... that entrance is GORGEOUS. really makes it all look much more complete. Ties it all up nicely......... I'm........ Now I think it would look incredible if Grian's portal was bigger and placed so that the Scarland entrance is perfectly in the middle. Would blend the two bases in an amazing way.  I am SO excited for the opening of Scarland! Before this episode, I didn't know what Hermitbuild was my favorite, but just building that entrance has made Scarland my Favorite of them all. Just. Wow. It really elevates EVERYTHING. Congrats Scar!! It looks aMAYzing.
The toy store reminds me of a movie called Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. Haven’t seen it in years; not sure what reminded me of it
Can't believe Cub is the british museum.
Is it just me or does anyone else have a little dance routine for Scar's superfast build mode music XD  I always groove out whenever I hear that music and it is one of the best parts of Scar's videos. Thanks for the funky beats!!!
For the allays have Impulse come up with some redstone device that dispenses diamonds/emeralds when people step close and then triggers a noteblock so the allays throw the diamonds/emeralds to a hopper.
Doc now has a god complex
Call it "Ryan's Toys"
What if the toy store was called “Jimmys Spooky Toystore”? It’s a good call back to our favorite sheriff back in Tumble Town.
Name the toy store after Jimmy. Maybe he’ll finally accept who he is.
sooo are you employing the whole soup group or what :D
Name of the Toy Store: Jelly's Playground
Scar, I’m working on my own superhero base because of you. Thanks for being my superhero.
19:50 scar almost went off PG and I love it (although it was accidental)
Justice for Doc!
Scar: I am going to keep Handyman announcement to the last to keep the suspense.  First comment on video Impulse: Can't wait to get to work
How about Walt’s Toy Store just as a little easter egg
name the toy store „ScarStory“ (ToyStory + Scar … i think you got it)
Wizarding world of Knick knacks
I have to admit I couldn't read the "thank you" message. I think it might need a backdrop 😅
the shop could be called “Andy’s bedroom” as a reference to toy story!
The number of times Scar has said dictator with the pause in between the dic and the stator is proof that however family friendly he is, he is nothing but a cat-lover naughty and mischievous little person
Mystory Inc
1:28 working for signs.
Why do I have the feeling that Cubs museum is becoming very... British? All those Artifacts from across the world, nobody bothered to ask the original owners :D
9:08 Doc has really become a dic tator
Just imagine Scarland in the create mod with moving trams...
Jellie’s Joyful Toys (name)
Treasure Alley Emporium
The Toy Box. Amazing episode, as always, your videos always make my day that much better. Thank you
For the building, here’s a name i though of!  (However many floors there appears to be) Stories Of Toys!  A buildings floors can be called Stories - and it also links to Toy Story! Hahaha
Love the episode as usual, for the unnamed building I’d like to suggest “Jelliecats Toyhouse” ^^
i feel like "scar's shop of magic and mystery" or something along the lines of that could be a cute shop name
21:44  the park does not accept children honestly based off of previous jokes I can see why
I feel like we need a new season soon for a fresh world
Not gonna lie, the thank you sign, is kinda hard to read from the ground.
A cool idea for the name of the toy store could be “Scar’s Toy Chest” like in home alone 2
I recommend hiring Joe to steal your trolley back, he's done one successful museum heist already. And if theft turns out not to be the answer, he's probably also your best lawyer option.
Happy Early Birthday to Jellie
Bob Gurr is the man
“Scardale Galleria” which is based on the Glendale Galleria which was the first Disney store that opened in March 1987
At this point i'm just surprised he hasn't gone minecart crazy with coasters and dark rides and stuff.
name the toy store Scars R us
Daaaaannnnnggggg Scar that entrance looks awesome!!!!
"dic tator"
Made call the shop "scars magicaly malicious toys!"
Please call the toy store Timmy’s Toy Store or something related to SolidarityGaming❤❤❤❤Love the building scar and can’t wait to see the final product😊😊
Rastapopoulos‘ Toy Emporium! Little throwback to Tintin and Snowy for old animation but I does have a certain ring to it? ( even if it is hard to spell)
You should name the toy store Jimmy's Delights since solidarity gaming is a toy
You should litter docs base with cherry blossoms
Name the toy store Scarland’s Bedazzling Bits and Bobs
The Mysterious Toads Game Store
You could name the Toy Store "Toy Tales with Scarland"
Scar, you should make it so every other flag on the entrance building is red wool because it would look even cooler.
It's a shame Pearl wasn't employee number two to match her poop hat!  Love the entrance!  One of my favourite parks here in the UK has a lovely entrance through a retro hotel. It holds so many fond memories to me
I think a good toy store name is Scarlands Peculiar Wonders and Oddities :)
No one talking about scar covering his swear by saying dic—…tactor?
Toy Storey
Shop name : Scar's Shinnigans, or, Scar's Shop of Shinnigans
I honestly thought he was no longer a PG channel  for a seocnd there 😂😂😂
Hell naw a german dictator💀💀
I’m sorry, but the stone arch that connects yours and Grians base is blocking the beautiful entrance ://If you don’t want to destroy it, my suggestion is to at least move it a little bit so it’s centered with the rest of the park!
The store should be called the "toy story" because the film toy story is from Disney/Pixar and your park looks very much like Disney World
The special pronunciation of dictator had me rewinding the video a couple times to make sure I heard it right 😂
Toys-Scar-Us came to mind for the toy store :)
I loved 9:28 . The reaction to Pearl's Dragon by Scar just shows absolutely ridiculous that dragon actually is :O
10:24 Deer Leader? I thought he was a goat... :P
for the name of the toy store why not something that reference the hermitcraft empires crossover like "Tiny Tim's Tiny Toys"
For the toy shop I was thinking: "Jellie's Jigsaws and Jacks" or another one could be "Scarland's small surprizes, a souvenir and toy shop" (or you could replace small with super!) I know their not the most amazing names but I've always enjoyed alliteration when it comes to these kinds of things  :)     But if you're looking for something more simplistic something like the "the magic toy box" or "trinkets and toys" could also work  (^u^)
D0c Kind of has me wanting to record messages like that and have them play automativelly in my house.
Jellie tots   Same name as sweets and tots is another word for kids  Jelly - Jellie   Perfect name for a toy or sweet shop
Jellie tots   Same name as sweets and tots is another word for kids   Perfect name for a toy or sweet shop
Is it odd the theme park is opening with zero rides?
Didn’t pixelriffs build a copper aging machine
Enchanted Hollow Toy Store
HAHAHA THE DICTATOR COMMENT IM CRYING
Name the Store Mystical Memories
"doc has really beacome a dic.....tator" lol HAHAHHA, long pause there
scar successfully bought some friends i see
the name for the store could be wacky witch toys
I have been so exited for the rides!!! I’ve been designing my own rides such as buzz lightyear, Star Wars galaxy’s edge and also jungle crews!! Scar, if you see this please 🙏 make some of these rides!! They are really nostalgic for me
Since you’re now closely working with  the Boatem gang again (Impulse and Pearl as Scarland cast members, Buttercups with the Doc war) I think “Boatem’s Totems” would be a fun toy shop name
I suggest sCar's Curios for the toy store <3
maybe you could have a golden base allay the scarland bank that does gold bars ? next to the emerald shower? 🪙🚿
OMG Scarland is looking so beautiful!  Love how imposing and grand that main entrance looks 😍 Doc keeping everyone on their toes while he's away is hilarious!
You gotta tear down the stone arch on the entrance of scarland. That's such an eye sore.
Idea hire cleo as a head of mascots?
Peculiar Play (kinda bad but I can't think of anything better)
Not Docm77 wanting to turn hermitcraft into 1985 germany
Scar the Tsar toy Store, but every time I say store I say star idk why 😂
doc is really a dic—tator of this world 😂
timis toys
A suggestion for the toy store: Toy Multi-storey (the tallness of the building incorporated with whimsy and wonder, a bit like Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium with hanging toys and demos of flying toys, lost balloons and maybe a "Hidden Jelly" if the Mouse doesn't get too touchy about ideas). We love your vids, Scar. You're an inspiration
Pardon me Scar but what did you just call Doc 9:05
“Buttercups toy shop” could help fund the operation and sounds nice.
For a store name. Mr scars wondrous bizzares. Instead of mr magoriums wonder emporium.
Good Toys with Scar x'D
name for the toy shop: Scarland's Tangy Toy Shop Motto: stop PLAYING around!
Scar its not a big deal but the flags are inconsistent some go the other way and some dont move at all
I’m like so scared of getting jumped scared by the announments now
Mr Goodoriums Wonder Imporium
Hello scar I love your videos and I started watching you from hermitcraft season 7 and SCARLAND is starting to be more epic when you add new things to it
Scar, you should use the BDubs "Shut Up" in response to Doc's announcements. Everytime Doc's message plays, Shut Up is the response.  Get Impulse to do the redstone.
Dic-tator ... Scar knew what he was saying.
I cannot wait to see the park entrance fully finished and the park opening. Just ignore Docs subliminal messages🤣🤣🤣🤣. Or do the same thing he does, Or make a huge flag of the buttercups 🤣🤣. Or both🤣🤣😊
Scar, as well as being psychological warfare, Doc's announcements were also a proof of concept audition tape; the system is designed to get around the issues with daylight sensors for your announcement system. He might not have got the job,  but perhaps if you extend a little olive branch and hire him as a sub-contractor he might still build it for you.
The Scarcanium would be a perfect name for the toy store  I absolutely am blown away by your builds. I cannot wait to explore the world of your imagination.  Cheers
Scar, I think you're overthinking this war with doc. Just walk in the Perimeter and do what scar does best,   Build things and break things.  For example, You and grian could have a fortnite build battle in his giant hole.
❤❤❤
My Idea for the Toyshop name would be: Mr. Mangroves Model Menagerie
Jelly's Toybox <3
i believe its "thank you" on gate in stead of "shany you"
I would name the toy store the mistoyrial shop
Toy Store-y
Getting a diamond shower is the most Disney Executive thing I've ever seen
Name the toy shop after Jimmy/Solidarity gaming.
The name for the toy shop should be The Crimson Magic, or Magical Toybox because its like made of crinsom and looks like a magical, mysterious run down building
Love scar self-cencoring with dictator
Name the toy shop the Imagination Emporium
Lol scar saying "enact revenge on our DEAR LEADER doc"
All the Bob Gurr love!  Love the meeting of the worlds - one of my favourite youtubers is Justin Scarred, who's friends with Bob Gurr and featured him on his channel quite often!
13:33 Did anyone else spot the distraction break!🤣Lmao
The horse at 13:05 doing the club penguin dance is the most distracting thing I've seen in a while
Looks so coollll!
Scar, if you need some ideas for revenge on Doc, you and the Buttercups could try farming some trees for their saplings and planting loads of trees in the perimeter. You can easily get a lot of saplings from farming 1x1 spruce and jungle trees, then plant the saplings in 2x2 plots of dirt to create massive trees that are hard to clean up. The big bubble oak trees are also annoying as ever to cut down, so make sure to grow some of them. These trees would fit the Buttercups nature hippie aesthetic really well, while also being a cost effective and annoying but harmless prank. Also, you could clog Doc's speakers with leaves as well, and disable the jukeboxes to remove those annoying messages before you go insane :)
Toy Store-y! It's a little on the nose but so cool for a theme park I feel!
9:05 .... really scar? XD
3:56 Doc should use this as a thumbnail
Toy stor-y
you should call it the ''The Jimmy store''
Queen Jellie's Plush Shop, I think would be cute name for the Toy store 😁
Jimmy's Toyland or Bean's Toy Barn in honor of the Empire's crossover 😊
honestly i entirely forgot about the scar land announcement system thingy until doc changed the custom music disk
"the mystical magical toy shop"
Toy shop name idea The magenta toy hut
The building should be called the pink extravaganza
For the shower just use a sensor filled with water and surrounded by wool except for above so ehen you junp on the window by the allay it triggers and droppers throw them out
Hear me out:  Toy Store-Y
the name must be, the toy stage
Toys Scar Us😃😃😃😃
Scar not realising doc took over his park announcement system is gold
Scar's Emporium could be a classic idea for the toy store x
Imagine if Scar named the toy shop ToysRScar. That would be hilarious😂
First thought that came to mind for the toy shop is Timmy Toy Story! 😂 sell mini Jimmy toys haha
Scartooy
2:30 Scar's Magical Toys
shop idea name: toys and trinkets! also, congrats on 2 mil subs!!
Scar, i think you should name the toy store as "Scar's cars, toy's and mystery shop" 🤍🤍
Will a giant dome be built over the park to stop non ticket holders?
Everyday I check if scar has posted and you did IM SO HAPPY
I think Jolly Jellie would be a nice name for the toy store
Can't wait what you come up with next. This place is already looking amazing. The rides will be awesome. There is so much cool stuff going on on the server right now!
9:05 Oh scar....
For the toy shop i think “Toys Scar Us” would be quite fun :). Great video aswell🎉
This is slowly turning into one of those 'Neighbor Wars' with the loudspeakers.
@GoodTimesWithScar    Name for the toy shop: Scars Midnight toy shop.
TOY STORE NAME: "Scar's Magical Toy Chest"
Now we just have to wait and see Grian and Mumbo Jumbo's reaction to Scar's broadcasts. That's all that is left to desire at this stage anyways.
13:05 life of a horse 🐴
As a british citizen I can confirm that the entrance is, in fact european. Also the horse in the timelapse is brilliant
Maroon mansion
Please name the shop: Toys "Scar" Us
"Jelly's funland" for the toy store 🗿
Name the building Gregory the 7th
Shop name: the toy store E, (not affiliated with anything at all)
Grian really was scared for life!
Store name scar a rus
I'm sure somebody else came up with this as well, but "Good Toys with Scar" could be a fun name for it
This episode was fantastic. From showing off some of the other hermits work, to your reaction regarding Docs announcements and the new entrance. Chefs kiss!
Scar you better have a grand opening with all the hermits
Why not call the toy shop scars mystical. magic toy shop
when the war with your neighbour has ended please concider to hire him for sound systems and making your park messages go off in perfect sinc and beautifull range. 😊
'Doc has become a real dic   -tator of the perimeter
9:10 Scar is going to be in an out of context video
9:05 -.-"
No way Cub just became a British museum 🤣
Oh that looks amazing!! The roof of the gateway, especially the arch, kinda reminds me of the Helsinki Central Railway Station in Finland, although the rest of the build is not much like it (it lacks the stone men, for one :P )
9:03 alright scar you're taking it too far
Scars Bizzare Bizzar
#13 on trending!   I havent watched a Hermitcraft video since the Caves and Cliffs update. But for some reason earlier today I had Scar on my mind on my mind but never acted out on it and for some reason I randomly side to check the tranding tab which is something I rarely ever do and who do I see? GoodtimeswithScar!   Tbh I'm surprised it's still in season 9 but it's nice to see yall still hanging out 😊
Is the perfect name for the toy stor
Toy story
Docs narrations are great.
"Doc has really become a d***....tator of this perimeter" Made my day
The number one name is "Scarget"
Toy story The building should be named toy story
3:50 you ment to tell me it is already 1,5 year... I am getting old, not good
That building DOES look a lot like a park entrance from Roller Coaster Tycoon 3!!
19:47 are we sure Scar is PG-13??
9:08
witchcraft toy store maybe♥️♥️
hahahaah Doc will love this episode. hahaha
You could name the toy store toy stories
For the toy store name it Mark's Menageries   because your name is Scar, Mark could be a more childish version of your name like instead of a scar you get marked
You could name the toy store: "JELLIE'S TOY EMPORIUM" "TIMMY'S TOY MARKET"  for solidaritygaming ❤❤❤
"Jubilant Jellie's Emporium of Marvel" It incorporates Jellie, as well as paints it as a lively place of happiness and amusement, with the right touch of Scarland™ magic. I would also be lying If the color pallet inside didn't remind me of Mr.Magorium's Wonder Emporium.
Love the vidoes keep up the good work, I got some toy store name ideas- adventurous toy store, the toy barn, and the wacky toy store
Mystery, toys
You should name the toy store scarland scar toys or scarred for life toys two cool names btw keep up the amazing work on your magical and fun land of scarland btw :)
Just that build could be a whole base
Good toys with scar
Mr Magoo’s Magic Emporium!
I love this season so much
Scar here is an idea for a name for the toy store: the HoTtOy (as a reference to HoTgUy) or Jimmy’s paradise (this is more as a reference to the empires x hermitcraft crossover)
i feel like it gives the vibe of Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, loved that movie growing up
(I am so late to this video but oh well) A cool name idea for the toy shop could be something inspired by all our favorite toy sheriff, like a cool nod to the crossover. One idea could be like “Toy Tim’s Treasure Trove” (ah that sounds more like a ride but may as well pitch the idea)
scar shouldn't forget to make a massive parking spot that stretched 1000's of blocks for all the guests.
Jellieworks
Hmmm... Scarland + the Buttercups is literally just Boatem 2.0 Maybe Scar will eventually hire both Grian and Mumbo onto the staff of Scarland and it'll become the Boatem crew with a (more) competent CEO this time. XD
Name the store toy storey
Wizarding Toys
Hi Scar! Some toy shop name suggestions:  Jellie’s Toy Box, Jellie’s Magical Toy Emporium, Jellie’s Toy Empire
you should call the handyman an imaginengineer like they really do at disney!!! 💖
You should name the toy shop "The Toy Barn" as a reference to a certain crossover and sheriff...
Scar, thanks buddy, really needed this pick me up, and nothing does it quite like a new video from Scar! 😊
The toy store should be named “Scar’s Scary Toy Chest”
You should name the toy store Gimmicks Galore!
9:05 thank you for the laughter
Pls sell Jimmy the sheriff toys in your toy store
Scar my man - what would you say for Tower of Terror like build? I'm sure it's doable and you are already hiring redstoner! :)
Toy Store E
Wait that’s step one!?
Omg so excited to see you start building rides!  Can’t wait for the future of scar land :)
Cherry toy shop 🍒
Seriously though. This entire build is so freaking cool. And I love that you’re building a staff!!
This is a fabulous project Scar. But… your shop signage really sucks. 😜
Name it "Jimmy's Good Ol' Roundup Toy Store" and you'll profit out from it.
You can name your toy store, toy-storey
Who loves Scar playing the amazing song during Super Fast Build Mode ❤👇
This announcement system would be great for the park! Perfectly timed, 3 times a day
I’ve got the best name for the toy store The toy stor-y You get it? It’s a play on pixar’s toy story
Tim's toyworld
Toy store-e
Nothing makes me smile more than not just Scar’s enthusiasm, but every other hermit’s for Scarland coming together!
Scars toy chest
You should name the toy store Timmy’s toys
Toy store name: Scars R Us (Toys R Us)
for the toy store I was thinking something like "Jellies Toy Bin" :)
My 13 year old wears her scarland shirt to cons with Jellie ears and a creeper plush.
the entrance is looking absolutely beautiful so far!! and so excited for the grand opening!
The pause in dictator 😂
You should name the toy shop "Timmy's Toys" Because Timmy's action figures on the New Life SMP. P.S Please do more New Life The name and reasoning might be completely wrong so sorry if it is
Doc built the sound system to show he’s the best at red stone for scars job. I love how it became more annoying than the 10,000 chicken prank.
Might I recommend the name “Trinkets and Treaspurrs Toy Shop”
Toys r scar as the name
Scars toy-land
Timmy's Toy Barn!
Maybe the maroon toy tinkerers is a good name for the toy shop?
You should name the toy store "solidarity plays"
"The menagerie of mischief" would be a good name
Docs voice on the pa is amazing lmao. And scars reaction is hilarious.  The shananigans are why i watch hermitcraft. 😊
Toys scaR Us would be a great name for the shop 😁
Good Time Toys
I’ve been waiting for the entrance for what feels like forever! It looks outstanding, and really brings the whole park together imo. If Grian’s stone arch could just be moved a tad bit back, it’d lend itself perfectly as the transition between Scarland and his base. Keep it up Scar!
Please name the Toy Store "Jelly's Jollys"
2:16 if you use a note block that’s powered by a sculk sensor engine that walks buy will get a shower. You can actually use alleys for storage systems I would recommend it if you want more space and it would give you a good reason to fix the storage problem.
Hey scar, I was wondering if you use lightmatica when building to have a schematic of something you built in a creative world? I know you have a creative world where you test your builds out and stuff but I wanna know if you use a schematic of it
I think that the toy shop name should be "Timmy's Toy Store" because he is a toy
the toystore seems like some kind of bodega to me. bodega in the name somehow. bodacious bodega? batty bodega? BODACIOUS bodega?
Possible Toy Store Names: Scarland Treasures Scarland Emporium Scarland Toy Emporium Joy Junction Scarland Whimsy Workshop Scarland Puzzles & Play DazzleDash Toys TinkerTrail Toys ImaginNation Toys WhimsyWonders Toy Emporium
Is there a plan to have the train track go through the entrance building?
The Tumble Toy Store After the Respectful Not-a-Toy Sheriff
He sounds like siren head by the way I would love to see you play the siren head games
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
He should name it little sheriff toys after jimmy the toy sherif from empires s2
Toy Scar Us (toy store name) Credit to my fiancé Annelise
2:35 George. We should name it George.
Gurr’s Games
I a, now going down the Bob Gurr rabbit trail. A-MA-Zing!
How about Isk-All's Toy Barn! (Pronounced like Al's) A little play on words from Al's toy barn from Toy Story!
A funny name would be Jimmy's (Solidarity) Family and Friends
Jellie's Toy Box
You’ve gotta name the toy store Toy’Scar’Us !! Like Toys R Us the old toy store :3
YOu should name ur toy store to TOY Storey like toy story
Pls invite Martyn to make some toys in the toy store

Jellies toys and games
Name the store scarland toy store
So he doesn't even realized it
Incredible!
Toy Store name Idea Scarland's Happy Stop Toy Shop!
I’m so excited for the park to open!!!
toy store idea Jiggumbob's Joy Factory
You should name the toy shop "Gadgets and Gizmos o' Plenty"
I think it would be funny if you made an actual infomercial and tutorial for the scar dirt method. 6:48
scar roller coaster tycoon series?
Amazing video! Can't wait for the park to open, and to see what Impulse does with the redstone!
Toy Tommy’s Tuesday the store not the move
Toy shop should be the dolhouse
You should name the toy shop, “Andy’s Toy Shop”🧸🪁🪀
Toy shop name idea! :reddish toys, then the mascot can be something called reddish. Maby some sort of radish thing or red dragon like the one you want in the cave!
At 9:06 I totally lost it. I thought he had lost all monetization lol
SCAR YOU ALWAYS MAKING ME PEE EVERYTIME YOU BUILD   I FEEL LIKE UR BUILDING OUR SWEET FUTURE😂
Did a little testing @GoodTimesWithScar for the diamond and Emerald Allay, you can use a note block so that anyone can activate the noteblock and get items from the Allay, no matter who "owns" it!  Hope that helps!
The building could have a callback name such as "The magical menagerie"
This is amazing!!! Also, dude, that's a ridiculously huge build you did in one go! Please take care of yourself! I'd rather you spread that out over multiple episodes than burn yourself out!
Should setup a hidden soundbox similar to doc that has a karaoke of buttercup, buttercup song. Give it a 15-30min timer. So it reloads the disc.
That entrance is epic!
3:29 ah see, that's where you're wrong, it's always ethical to steal things back from museums
Scar, you should name the toy shop "Jellie's Joy Toys"
The wonder emporium
The Grand Scarcade
Bruh, Doc's announcements triggers my fight or flight.
I love scar’s reactions to Doc’s announcements! Lol
Toy store name: Jimmy's toy store! Free sheriff's for all! 🤠🐮
It looks amazing Scar so beautiful 💚
9:06 SCAR
Maybe you could name it MrJ's Toys and Games? 1-J can stand for Jack in the box 2-It's lowkey after my dad, who's been watching some of the other hermits channels and has gotten my whole family into playing minecraft.  Twice.
GoodTimes Toys and Games
You should hire doc as an unpaid intern, or junior engineer with “competitive” salary
For the Allays, make a wishing fountain that people can throw diamonds and emeralds in, and have it feed through hoppers that go to the allays that way it replenishes.
Potential Shop Name: Jangler’s Jolly Jests & Japes. It calls back to an earlier series, although it might be better for a prank shop than a toy shop…
Idea for the shop… but will also involve a ride.  In Disneyland, there is Pirates of the Caribbean ride. You play in a pirates SMO. Make a Pirates SMP ride, and have the store sell pirate toys, like hats, eye patches, swords, flintlock pistols, pirate flags, etc.
Scars Mystical Toys for the building name
Store name suggestion.. "Timmy's Toys" 😁 Great episode!! 🔥
Toy store name suggestion: The Scarland Wonder Emporium
My shop name suggestions:  Tumble Toys  Or Tumble Toy Emporium ✨
Scar’s Trinket Tower? Idk lol
9:05 🫢
toy store name idea: Jimmy's Trinkets
Scar: walks up to a third Allay with a gold ingot.. “and this is”   Me: “SCAR NO WAIT!”
Amazing video scar😊
Doc (would never spy blow up and bety you)
Idk but jellies ball of yarn seems like a good name for the toy store
ohmygosh its only phase one im so shook this journey is so wonderful Scar thank you for all that you do in brightening up the world!!!!
1:08 "Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world." -Walt Disney
Well I never thought I'd hear that but I'll be damned if I'm not super glad I did. Well done Scar
It’s official:  Doc’s lost his mind
I would name the toy store “Crimson’s Collectables” since the walls have crimson and the toys are collectables
You could name the toy store Jellie and jam’s toy store jellie because it’s jellie and jam because it’s the seeded version of jellie
Fantastic work.  Now you need an electrician to handle the lighting and mob proofing. Also building name. "Dream Bigger Toy Store"
We gonna talk about 9:07
Doc has become WHAT!!???!? 9:05
Boy Toy! Lol
Name the toy store Scars-R-Us
Mumbo built a Savings account that was literally linked to each players code .. the system was complex but so cool when he finished the building 💝 possible ideas for your next Bank upgrade .. VIP Customer Service 😹😹😹 cool yes Impulse is Redstone Master 🙈 Don't tell Doc
Idea for the Toy Store: Jellie's Jungle of Toys and Trinkets
After seeing Doc's video and application for Scarland, I was genuinely wondering if Scar would hire him for the sake of the chaos or turn him down out out of fear. I think Doc's incessant intercom system worked a little *too* well and annoyed Scar to the point where Doc was definitely turned down XD
The purple tall shop  should be Tommy's toys of torture.
“Jimmy’s Toy Box”
The magenta manor!
It should be named: Scar’s Boutique & Toys
Name the toy store Jellie's Playroom
The magentry toy store
Doc’s megaphone prank is an all-time great moment in Hermitcraft! 😂😂😂
Name it the Wild West and sell jimmy toys in there
Have the toy store be slightly dangerous and the call it SCARS R US
Jimmy’s/Timmy’s/Tommy’s toy store
Beautiful work Scar
In my incredibly corny opinion, the toy store should be named… (drumroll)… Toy Store-y!
Now with the hard hat now, Impulse DEFINITELY looks like a fireman!
I'm always a sucker for alliteration, so I think Timmy's Toys would be a perfect name for the toy store! Jimmy may say he's not a toy, but we know the truth.
2:50 You should name al's toy barn 👍👍
Toy Storey
Toy Store Name Idea: Duncan's Toy Chest. From Home Alone 2.
The toy store could be called "Scar's Toy Barn."
For the toy shop's name, maybe something like "Curio Reef" like coral reef, since curio is a sort of synonym for a trinket and the corals present? :0 Other than that, "Scarland Souvenirs" fit's the rest of the shop names themes
It would be cool to sell Scarland tickets and sell items and services for cheap so the park is like a Costco membership.
"Doc is becoming a 'DIC-tator'. "
▪︎ Thinking of Classic Disney, I'd love to see a toy shop named 'Neverland' as I will Always be a kid at heart.  ▪︎ If can make a skin for an Allay you could have a Tinker Bell flitting thru Neverland with their cute sounds! ▪︎ Would love to see an old-style clackety wooden roller-coaster. ▪︎ Scarland's Entrance is PERFECT.  Love the Grandness of it all, the ornate details, the height, the color palette, it sets you up for Great Ecpectations. 😊
Ideas for the toy store name: * The Imaginerie (play on menagerie) or The Toy Imaginerie * The Toy Box * The Imagination Station or The Imagination Play Station * Jellie's Play Pen * Jellie's Toy Store * Dream Land or Dreamer's Land or Dreamer's Gate
You should probably either employ Cleo or give them some diamonds as a thank you for doing all your statues and stuff like that. I think they’d appreciate it.
Scar Toy
For the toy store, you could name it toy store-y
Name it juken stuf
Toy Store-e =D
Scars "R" Us S.L. ToyStore GTW Scarz World of Jelly Scarporium
We’re starting to delve into the possibility that Doc is taking things out of proportion. Grian and scar accidentally broke a redstone build he easily could’ve rebuilt, as well as Grian and scar profusely apologizing and trying to help, and now he’s made a voice messaging system that’s heard server wide, exploded and griefed multiple bases, would’ve bombed Grian and scars bases had those butterfly machines not been stopped, and it’s gone from endearing and fun to sorta off putting..
How about the toy store name "jellies one stop toy shop" thought the logo could be a little cat paw think it would be cute
scar lands whimsical wonderful toy shop
You should name the toy store fun toys by scar
hrh ok
Awww, it’s so sweet he thinks of us going through his park too ❤
Wow Scar, it just keeps getting better and better. Looooove all you do! And dancing to the timelapse music of course😊
You could name the toy store "Toys Scar Us" as a play on "Toys R Us."
the enterance for scarland looks amazing!
I just wanted to say that I really enjoy the "Super Fast mode"'s music. I think it is a really great pick! Also - Thank you for picking Impulse as the Redstone Handyman. That's way cool (and, was the one that I was rooting for!)
The power has really got to doc's head
I think an adorable name for the toy store would be Trinket Tower/Knickknack Shack or something along those lines. Such magical builds, Scar! Keep it up.
I've seen a few names reference Jimmy and then one for Al's Toy Barn...why not combine em. Jimmy's Toy Barn.
Toy Store name ( 2:30 ) / movie reference "Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium"
Nice entrance scar
Name the building "Larry" because why not lol
Possible store name: Sheriff Jimmy’s Toy Barn
Sherriff Jimmy's Toys
Wonderful work as always Scar! Thinking of suggestions for the toy shop, and my thought was "The Burgundy Babagerie", firstly for the color, but secondly as a nod to one of my favorite moments in all of Hermitcraft. Just don't bring any real charged creepers inside ;)
The shop could be named Memento Mori. Bring back the magic to the Haunted Mansion!
I think the Toy Store should be called Timmy's Toy Chest in honor of the crossover and everyone's favorite toy sheriff.
The store could be called, Toys R Yours
I'm so excited to see your first rides!!
You should call the toy shop the Toy Store-y!
I mentioned it in feedback on discord, but "Tumble Toys" as a callback to Jimmy for the toy store name.
i can't wait to see the haunted mansion. i would love to see how scar will creatively recreate all the optical illusions
For the name of the toy store Scar, I suggest Kitten's Play or Baby Jellie's Play, it's the cat version of child's play :>
The Toy Store should be Timmy’s Toy Barn. Reference to Toy Story and little toy Timmy from the Empire’s event
Woody's Toy Store Cause the store is made out of wood and the Pixar character Woody.
Toy store name: Timmy's Emporium
Have you built the Scarland Haunted Mansion yet? If you haven’t that is what I would build next.
Angry Scar is something I didn't know I needed until today.
Scar, will you be placing the special tree near the castle in honor of Herb Ryman?
Came directly to this video after watching Mumbo’s Hermit Craft Season 1 video, and it just puts into perspective how absolutely astounding Scarland is. It’s actually a masterpiece.
I would also suggest adding rollercoasters to your park of course. You could also add a train ride that goes around the park. I would love to see some roller coaster builds! :D
Walt may have had his body frozen beneath Disneyland but his soul reincarnated into Scar.
how much for the "Scar Dirt Method™" masterclass?
Every time lapse should include a mob 😂
hello scar!!!
call the toy store "GoodToysWithScar"
Jim's Toy Town would be a funny name for the toy store.
You could have a mini arcade at the top of the toy store. hermits could pay diamonds to redeem tickets for arcade games. Hermits could also redeem prizes. These prizes could be exclusive to the arcade, items in all of Scar land, or both.
Surely the toy store should be called Mr Goods Wonder Emporium,  it has the same magical vibes as Mr Magorium
The toy shop should be called Jimmy’s toy store. No context needed.
The toy shop should be called Twilight Toys Emporium
Mr Scarorium’s wonder emporium.  Would be a cool name for the toy store
*sigh* So beautiful, so big, so amazing Scar SCARLAND IS AMAZING! I love the nod to Rollercoaster Tycoon, yes the colours are great. Seeing the castle at one end and the entrance at the other with the fade and the sun behind them is so immersive and wonderful. 🤩🥹
For the name of the shop (2:49)... I propose "Artificer's Toys & Trinkets".  Stylized more like: /￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣\ |          𝔄𝔯𝔦𝔣𝔦𝔠𝔢𝔯'𝔰        | |   𝔗𝔬𝔶𝔰 & 𝔗𝔯𝔦𝔫𝔨𝔢𝔱𝔰   | \__________________/ I chose this name because...  - It leans into the magical theming of much of Disney's parks, while also bearing some reference to the several engineering-adjunct regions, like Tomorrowland and the overall design of several Downtown Disney shops.  - The older-english word choices paired with the ampersand would lend themselves well towards an ornate sign, written in a calligraphy typeset, as is prevalent among shops within the Magic Kingdom at Disney World  - The mental image of a Mage Jellie, with the gown and hood of a stereotypical magic user in fantasy worlds  just seemed really on-brand with the iconography present on the helmets and merchandise already present in the park.
I propose the Idea that since you have that half slab step up, which isnt that wheelchair friendly. You should put some armor standa in the ground with colored leather helmets with the head tilted down slightly to make some wheelchair ramps. Anyways love the content, It fills me with inspiration and joy.
men getting massive arkham knight vibes
It was very easy to tell who it was as soon as he started walking around with the hat, because it had a beard  Also I kept saying iskall out loud when I was thinking impulse, watching both of them makes it so much easier to confuse the two
Doc's thing TOTALLY gave me Bioshock vibes as well and i LOVED it.
The buttercups should cover the top (few blocks) of the perimeter with dirt blending in with surrounding terrain before Doc comes back.
I could never accept a salary for being part of the project brewing inside you for years. You may want to hire a speech therapist for properly pronouncing the word dictator ;) Sorry you couldn't make Phasmo tonight.
9:05 Sus pause on that word lol
The SCARlet building
Hear me out... Get Mumbo to create a number of his potato vending machines around Scarland, each of which is stocked with 'dic-taters'.
Scared toys
scar ‘ r ‘ us that should be the name of your shop
He’s the Doctator
Shop name : Toy store-e (you read it toy story, gosh i feel so embarrassed lol)
Tumble Town Toys, of course! after the legendary toy, the Sheriff
DIC...TATOR. I've never laughed so hard at a Hermitcraft episode.
The shop should be called "The Pic-Scar Store"  Picaxe x Scar x Pixar Its pun
The toy store reminds me of Al's Toy Barn from Toy Story 2, but with a better colour scheme and Scar's perfect design. I propose that it should be called "Scar's Toy Barn"
toy storey.  bc.  toys .  &.  multi-storey building.
I’ve got an idea for the Toy Shop.   What about Scar’s Magic Workshop?
Gloobtopus' Magical Crafts
Toy Store names: Whips & Chains Adam & Eve
Fuzzy toyhouse
You need to hire Gem now, so you can have all the soup group in there. Gem would probably do park security for free, as long as she got to keep any heads.
We'd like to suggest Timmy's Toy Shop for the toy store. - PhantomNoir and family.
The toy shop could be called, "Fun at Fuchsia" based on all the pink blocks?
The shop should be called jimmy’s gify shoppe  Also your builds are absolutely incredible! Love them
"You stupid dic....tator!" 🤣🤣🤣  Am I the only one who loves pg-13 Scar?😂
Naming the candy shop something to do with cotton candy would be amazing! The cotton cloud, the candy cloud, something like that. Thank you for the video! It always brings me comfort
Today on is Doc getting more concerning? The answer is always yes My ideas for the shop would be jellies gifts  or jellies jokes and gifts
Tumble town
where is the parking?
Heya Scar, been having a touch time lately. jsut seeing you builds and hearing your voice always helps me <3 thank you for being you
I going to come after you  “Points at Zeds base
Doc has really become a 🍆 🥔  😂
The toy store should be named: Jimmy’s toys! Or something to do with Jimmy since he’s a toy 😂😌
That toy store interior would look killer with some custom pumpkins designed to look like airplanes hanging from 'rope' and wooden supports
9:06
6:49 so where do we sign up to take the scar dirt method course? 😂😂
I know it’s a weird store name but what about ‘Tiny Timmy’s Toy Store’?
I love Scarland so much cant wait for phase 2!!
I think the building should be Scars R Us
I have been waiting for this all week!!!
Wait.  Wait wait wait....I never noticed until just now but...  Did you....use the Disneyland forced perspective trick from Main Street USA on your buildings?   Oh my God you did.  HOW?!  HOW MAN?!  HOW DID YOU THINK OF ALL OF THIS?!!
Toy Store need to be called “Jimmy Place”
I'd like to give a suggestion for a building you can use as inspiration for when you build the Sci-fi section of the park, is a science museum in France called: Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie
15:36 walks by creeper without a flinch while an ally scares him.
Toys “ScaR” Us, might be a good name :)
Verandah Over The Toy Shop
Name for the toy store: Trinkets and Treasures or Trinkets and Trash.
"Doc has really become a dic... tator of this perimeter" -Scar
The Jellie Emporium would make a nice toy store name! Reminds me of all the times I went looking through Disneyland‘s emporium for a toy keepsake and all the great memories! Awesome video, Scar! Loved every second
Scar you should name the toy store 'Mr. Scargorium's Wonder Emporium, Really recommend Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium  if you haven't seen it.
I'm not a huge commenter, and I'm sorry for that, but I've been really loving this. Your OG Scarland videos are what got me started watching Minecraft YouTube & Hermitcraft YouTube. Seeing a brand new Scarland coming to life has been bringing a smile to my face. Thank you.
I think dominoes toys is a gods name
Sheriff's Empire something that kinda links up Jimmy and remind everyone he is not a toy
Name for the Toy Store: Tim's toy barn in honor of Jimmy
You should name the toy store Read Me A Story. That was the name of the store my family always used to go to for birthday gifts growing up in Washington state (the toy store was in a small town called Anacortes), but it was forced to close a few years ago.
Scar, the entrance is stunning! Cant wait to see it up and working!
Toy shop name idea:butter cup toys and (I'm still working on something that ryemes with toys)
Some ideas for a shop name could be Burgundy Baubles or Scar's Scarlet Souvenirs
2:48 Name suggestion, "Scar's Stories of Fantasy and Fun" slightly taking from Toy Story, just changing a word and turning story plural. Plus it sounds like each toy has a story to it.
toy store name: GoodToysWithScar
9:07  You have no idea how hard I laughed at that.
Toy shop name: Scar's Toyland
I think you should call the toy store 'Mysteries R You'
Not all your FLAGS are being swept in the same direction.
11:38 The funnier thing about the hat is that it makes people less protected, because they can't use a helmet 😅
Toys of life
Your reactions to Doc's announcements are really funny 😂.
A good name would be scar’s menagerie of fun and toys
You could name  the toy store The Tipsy Tophat
2:50min in has to bee a haunted mansion
7:40 If you want to have an easier time aging copper, I recommend you talk to X, he'll probably be happy to lend David to you.
Timmy’s Toy Store
“Doc has really become a” WHAT?! “tator” 🤣🤣 the pause 😂
The shop should be called Jellie’s Toy Box
Name the toy store Babes! As in Babes in Toyland!
Doc's voice is actually amazing on that PA system. He's got the perfect voice for it.
9:06 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Oh Scar😂😂❤
I think the toy store should be called Hermits at Heart or Hermit Happiness
Could see the toy store totally being called Enchanted Collectables. It looks like a very magical store
I think a cool name for the toy store could be "Jellie's toy box"! Have a blessed week :)
I have an idea for the toy store name!! Maybe something like "Scarlands toy shop of wonders!" Or something? :D Also Xisuma saying that the announcements scares him in chat is just truly hilarious!
13:13 forgot to strip one of the birch blocks on the lower half of this side
The toy shop should be named “Goodtimeswithtoys”
The Dedication on Scarland is Insane
you should have named the hotel "the Hermitcraft Tower Hotel" as a reference to Tower of Terror
Name the store Scratoom!
Name the toy store the good times toy emporium
Aaaahhh, I was just yesterday trying to find someone that I watched that had uploaded some hermitcraft because it seems that most people haven’t for a few weeks, and here you are curing my cravings!!
LMAO the doc announcements, so well done
I think the toy store should be called jelly’s bits and bobs! Scar, i hope u see this, but i am a SUPERFAN of everything disneyland and theme parks (ive watched the imagineering story 5 times😂) and seeing u make all of these insanely amazing builds that make scarland look and even feel so cool in a game about blocks!!! i have tried to make cool theme parks in minecraft so many times ( none of them ended well😂 ) and yours just blows my mind away!! thank you for everything scar!!!!!!
"Dic" ... tator  nice one
*Toys & Paws*
I vote you name the toy shop “Good Toys with Scar.”   On a side note, I’m saddened and also annoyed that Doc got Scar to swear twice in this video (and I’m not talking about the dictator thing). My kids got me started watching GTWS specifically because he doesn’t (didn’t?) swear. *sigh*
9:05 Never change scar, love ya dude
Scarland is looking amazing! Next, you should commission a map artist to make a map of Scarland showcasing all the shops and attractions that people can buy after they enter. They can even buy the maps at a special map stand.
Thanks Scar , love from Basildon ,England! you should do a ride competition between the hermits, give them all a plot and winner gets a room in the castle ! Keep up the good work
I think the name should be Scars4Us as an ode to Toys4Us and your own outro!
Toy Store Name idea: Pinkies Playpen (simple name based off two simple things. Its REALLY pink and its full of toys for kids to play with!!)
Toy Store Name Idea: Jelly's Jollies
The toy shop should be called Jellies' Jollies
toy shop idea:  "child's wonder, a wonder full place" "child's play, where dreams are made" "toy for us, a place you and me enjoy"
could call the shop "Tumble Town Toys" as a nod to your home for a month or so
The Toy store should be called ‘Scar’s R US’  (It’s a playful reference to the Toy’s R US toy store.)
Toys  R us because everyone misses it
Scar still did not notice the secret pane of pain.
I hope Scarland is safer for kids than Disneyland.
Jimmy's Toy Land? Timmy's Toy Land?
Scar!!! It's not symmetrical scar!!!!   You should blow up the rocks outside
From: Ria and Choco  We suggest “FAO Scar’s” or “Toys-R-Scar’s” for the toy shop!! <3  We love all your progress on Scarland!! :D
Name the building Fred please
I love how Scars working with the whole boatem crew
Wait I’m confused, on the side that says accepts emeralds it gives Scar diamonds and on the side that says accepts diamonds it gives him emeralds 1:55
Also Doc - showcasing sound system so he could potentially do the same for Scar 😅
You should name the toy store "Jimmy's Toy Barn"
I really didn't expect the entrance to pull the build together that much. From the inside it closes the space off very nicely and really makes scarland feel like it's own little world. The shot of the park at around 14:10 is amazing
Maybe Jellies Jumble of Jubilant Toys could be a cool name for the toy store? Unlikely but who knows
JOYFUL TOYFUL TOY STORE
Why not call it “Toys Scar Us”?
Maybe the store could be scar's toy box
Grian needs to move over his stone ring now
Ah I think docs missage is starting to get to you as you called him your leader towards the end there, otherwise park is looking good and I can't help but want to build something likethis  park in minecraft, keep up the great work!
Idk y but my first thought for the toy store name was Weasley Wizard Wheezes 😅
You should get your employees to help you with your doctator problem.  You should make a super group with the soup group and buttercup group.
Toy store name: Toys R US
Store idea  Name:  Jellie’s ToyBin  Slogan:  Come buy the Purr-fect gift to celebrate the Purrr-fect day
Tippy-Tap Toys
You should name the toy store after Jimmy in some way
Zonkos toy store!
Magic Shop
Timmy's "I'm not a toy" Toy Store
Yay! I've been waiting for a new video
Ideas for Toy Shop names: Playful Paws Toy Shop Jellie's Purrfect Playthings Meow Magic Toy Shop
The fifth employee needs to be Mumbo.  Mumbo Numba Five!
Scar should totally name the toy store after Solidarity...as a reference to the Empires folks.
Lol at 9:15! We have a drinking game called dictator or d*** tak*r
love the colloabs with the park need some more ! Like doc for a haunted house he will do crazy things
Doc just went full 1938. bruh...
Jellie's Jamboree Toy Store would be super cute!
Put a Jimmy head in the toy shop
the toy shop could be called toys scar us
watching these episodes makes me feel so cozy
Jelly’s magical Toy Emporium
9:06 HEY WAIT WHAT I NEARLY CHOKED ON MY OWN SPIT
You should name the toy store Jellie's Jollies!
Shop names: Maroon Miniatures (Mangrove Miniatures), Tiptop Trinkets, Scarland Smiles
Scar even after all these years I’m still amazed by your builds. Keep up the good work :)
How about a name for the toy store that plays off of the dude who was a “toy” from Empires?
I remember on Minecraft Bedrock I designed a keycard reader that in theory could recognize a near infinite number of unique cards using a hoper that fed into an item sorter. It would send it through the line until it found a match then went in. This would allow it to open the door and return it to you. If it doesn't match, it just filters out and then gets returned.
This season really has gotten out of hand, with the war with doc just getting crazy and just Scarland in general is just 👌
For the toy shop, you should name it Toys Scar Us in honor of our fallen childhood.😢7
Great job Scar! With Doc's 1984-like broadcasting I see it happening that you enter Scarland and hear "Welcome to Sc... - Optimize and Gri- ..arland and enj.. -nd and Thrive- ... oy your stay!"
Jellies Toy Chest
I know this probably is copyrighted but Al’s Toy Barn is only thing I can think of for the name for your toy shop lol
Maybe naming the toy store: Mys-Scarius' Toy Corner.  Maybe you can have a "Mys-Scarius" mascot in front of the toy store to lure patrons in to purchase the mysterious toys on sale.  Love your builds!
Does "opening the park" mean end of season? Or is the Tango's declaration that Decked Out is done mean the season is immediately over?
Toy store name: Toy Story
Store names (jelly’s trinkets) (scars scarring collectibles)
You know I saw a comment about boatem and then I thought one good way to prank doc would be get rid of a little bit of the bedrock and make a layer underneath it that will spawn heaps of mobs and ruin the point of having a perimeter then cover up the hole see how long it takes him to find it
Toy Store Name: Purple Nurple. 💜
you could sell jellie plushies
Scar should call his toy shop "The Toy Sheriff" and stock aome of them. Afterall he said there is nothing to be ashamed about being a toy to Jimmy
Scarland looking great!  Small suggestion, to spawn-proof the area you could lay down some glow lichen, it shouldn't be that intrusive.
I suggest FAO Scars for the toy shop. Thanks for the episode. Be well! 0/
Amazing build!! I'm always in awe of the detail in your buildings.
the toy store should be named Live Laugh Love
the second I saw the thumbnail I went is that a train station and why does it look so familiar , after about 5 minutes of looking up every big train station I can remember I still can't shake the feeling that I've been there, but the fact that it immediately reads as a train station is so impressive
The toy store could be called Jellie’s Jimmys
The toy shop could be named "Jimmy's Toy Town" (because of the Crossover, and it's relatively close to tumble town)
Hey Scar! With the school year starting I am feeling really scared and overwhelmed but I saw you lost a video earlier today and had something to look forward to. You are such an inspiration to all who watch you. Keep doing what you’re doing! You really need to light up scarland better so many mobs at night!😂
Jellies jolly toy store
Toy Jimmy's toy shop.
Should sell small toy cars.
The shop should be called Razzmatazz Toys or Good Times Toy Shop
2:33 Mr Scaroriums Wonder Emporium
It should be called " ToyLand" or Scar's Toylandamania
The Toy shop could be called TOY’Scar’Us — TOY’SCAR’US — Love your work Scar !❤😀🥰
Some ideas for the building name are mystical trinket toys, trinkety toys, or Jellie’s knick-knacks!!!
Cub is a theif
Scarland looks so incredible. This is genuine peak Minecraft
Toy store = Jimmy's Shop!
Toy store name A Timmy Story
Toy Storeis could be a nice name for a toy store
The name should literally be Toy Story/ Toy Storie
With most youtubers, when they don't release a video in awhile you can just assume they're putting it off, but when scar doesn't upload for awhile, he's creating the most magnificent build you've ever seen
You should hire doc to do speakers and such holy cow that was amazing
WHATTT the entrance looks insane and yeah pearls dragon is AWESOME
Figured you would pick cubfan, mainly just for concorp.  Maybe Cub can be the security guard? Every park has its own security system.
Welcome impulse
Jellies toy box would be a great name for the toy store
Jelly and friends toy store
what about "Jellie's Toys" for the name of the shop?
Bit jittery after Phasmophobia maybe?
Possible shop name: Good Games with Scar :-)
That long pause in the middle of "dictator" almost got me. 😭
“Doc has really become a dic…tator” 😂😂
2:51 What about Penumbra Toys
I think jellie-toys is a great name, by: RayStone
For the toy store - Toy Stories or Toy Storys
Grian's Arch of Friendship looks so off-center now 🤣
The toy shop should be called Jimmy's jumbo toy jamboree, referencing the toy sheriff from empires!
Hey scar. A name for your toy shop needs to be based of Jimmy some how. Like Solidarity Toys. Or Jimmy's Gameing shop. Also question for whomever may know are you, is he, making any rides for your amusement park?  Amazing video as always scar!.
you  just might become Scarrrrred for life! *crash*   that made me laugh so much
😄 👍👌
Timmy’s Toys!
21:47 “No no, the park doesn’t except children” GoodTimeWithScar, Scarland Park, August 2023
For the toy store, I propose "Crimson Trinkets", I think it rolls off the tongue nicely
Names: toy store-ey, bob, or marooned with toys
“Jellie’s Plush Palace” seems like a nice name for it to integrate Jellie in some way.
I have A great idea to name it Scars Merchandise With your Merch!
« I’ll thrive you into the ground » may be an even better line than « dic…tator. »
Professor Goodtimes Toy Emporium!
Scars shop could be called either “Scar’s whimsies and wonders” or “HotGuy’s Whimsies and Wonders”
Toy Store Name Idea: Scaroys r us
Your cleaning lady would like some cookies... its difficult to work when starved. <3
Jimmy's toy emporium
Timmy's Toy Trove
name the toy store Toys Scar' Us
toy store name idea: Toy Scar Us
I would gladly take the scar dirt method course
Brady Avery and Nora say “Hermitcraft’s Toys and Crafts”!! :D
Scarland Toy Manor
didnt know cubfan was british
the shops design has a very mystical feel so definitely needs a magical name!
The place should be called girls and boys toys
Big fan of the dancing horse during the time-lapse.
You should call the store "scar's bonkers toy boutique"🤩
The toy store has to be called Toys Scar Us😂
Entrance looks amazing as always! And a suggestion for the toy shop could be "Timmys Toys!"
Doc, what in the 1984? 😂😂 I love it, actually 😂 little bit freaky
Simple idea for the game room, but an idea none the less. Poker, or any card game really. Looks like a casino to me
I think Jellies Toy Emporium or something similar to that would be perfect
hey im taking trigonometry now lmao
I’ve never seen someone so scared by an Allay
Hijack thee speaker and   make it say live laugh love and butter cups
The apothecary
9:06 Easily the funniest thing Scar has ever said
“Doc has really became a dic..tator”
i think "jellie's enchanted toyhouse" wouldn't be a bad name for the toy shop. it's got kind of a magical vibe, and i really love the image of a toy store where the theme is that you're literally inside a toyhouse when you go in. all the decorations are scaled up doll toys, and you really feel like you shrunk down and walked into a playset, etc
That toy shop is begging for an aesthetic like the Weasley's shop in Harry Potter.
I toy train track circling around the ceiling would be sick.
Scarp and Toy Manor
you should name the toy store cats r us
I just adore how the entrance sets the tone for Scarland as a whole. I actually gasped a bit when you were standing further back in scarland showing it off. Amazing build!!! Oh and maybe the name for the toy store could be Jelly's toybox?
For the toy shop maybe something about Toy Story
Might i suggest a rollercoaster that goes past miniature versions of all scars previous season bases?
Congrats on 2M subscribers!
The Toy Shop could be called: "Capital  Amazing  Times  's Toy Emporium"  Or "CAT's Toy Emporium" in honor of Jellie :)
2:40 Name it "Timmy Store" PLEASEEE
Scars Elaborate Store of Wonder for the toy store
I'm not sure what is more magnificent:  new fabulous gateway or doc's dic.tator thing... I mean it is horrendous but magnificent.
Idk if anyone has asked but whats some theme lands you have planned
Good Times with Toys!
Shop name idea: Timmy's Toy Store, referencing the sheriff from the crossover, who DEFINETLY (isn't) a toy.
Scar's just over here following his dreams with mind and heart. Sorry, i just really enjoy "There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow." Lol
You should call the toy store,"Scared Toys" and sell jellie and scar plushies. And other plushies of your imagineers! And a rare queen jellie plush can be the center piece
Name idea for toy store: Jellie's Jollies
I feel like "Good Toys w/ Scar" is right there.
hows this for the toy shop name: *The Wonder Emporium* it sounded nice in my head lol
"Build a jellie" like build a ber love the video i hop everyone has a good day
Timmy toy store
Toys-Scar-Us
G.T. toyshop. Like the old kb toyshop
Timmy’s toy store
"Doc is really a dic-tator in his perimeter" LOL
please name the building "the plum drum"
9:06 is one of the funniest things you’ve said 😂😭
Name for the toy store: Jimmy's Toy Emporium
“Jimmy’s habitat” (the ones who know know) for the toy store
For the new shop name "peculiar purchases" or "shack of surprises" might be an idea for the name! :D
For the name of the toy store: Toy Store-y
Amazing! The entrance to Scarland is such a huge build. You have put in so much work on Scarland, I can't wait for the other hermits to come and visit!
first that came to mind for the store name scarlets toys
ive been waiting sooo long for the PA system videos to start poping up! so good doc is a hoot
Can we appreciate the time that Impulse took to learn about Bob Gerr and imagineering? That's some serious dedication
You should call it Jimmy's Toy Store for obvious reasons ;)
ToyScarUs? Maybe? Hopefully?
9:05 LUL "doc has really become a dic-...-tator" breh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Jellie Shack is a cute toy store name I think
I´m so excited to see how it´s coming together. ❤ You did an amazing job, really
Timmy’s Toy Barn…  In honor of our favorite toy Sheriff who’s no longer with us.
The fact that Grians portal and scars entrance isn’t centered is really bugging me
Cub stealing all the stuff like bdubs head and the top of decked out is the most British thing ever
Glad the bank doesn’t dispense gold….
"Jimmy's toy emporium"
I feel like the name "Mischief and Magic" is the perfect name for your toy store
Hi Scar!  First up, I love the new build! I can’t wait for everything to finally work and be put together! It’s going to look o-mazing! ;)  Second up, here are some name ideas for the toy store: Jellie’s Jigsaw’s, Happy Treasure, Purple Pals, Jellies Joyful Toys, Playful Paradise, Toy Emporium, Toy Mania,  Scar’s Happy Toys. You can also mix and match those names too :D  Third up,  I wanted to say how much I love you and all the other hermits channels. You have been an inspiration to my sister and I for the past 2 years. Especially ever since I dislocated one of my knee caps I grew more and more in love with you and your channel, so much that for my birthday this year my sister  took liberty of that and made me a little surprise to remember you and Scarland herself. She hand sewed me my own little Minecraft Jellie. She has this adorable Scarland Jacket on and it can even come off. My family agreed for me that I should try and share it with you, so in twitter I decided I will try and figure out a way for you to see it if you wish. I don’t really do social media so I’ll try my best. Hopefully it will work.  Keep up the great episodes Scar! Say Hi to Jellie for me! <3
The name of the toy store should be Jelly R Us
I wish they could all be engineers! They’re all so good at redstone 😂
Maybe the toy store-y might be a funny name for the toy store? I hope you like it!
How about "Kittening Around" for the toy shop. I wanted to play off kittens since they're baby cats and so I looked up toy shops and saw one called kidding around, so boom, Kittening around!
You should totally make those street style type signs (like on pole with multiple signs pointing as to where to go)
Park looks Amazing!!   Toy shop name idea: Jellie('s) Joy Toys  Suggestion: The park needs things to do (i.e., games/activities)
Scar's close to opening the park Tango's close to opening Decked Out Doc is close to destroying the server The season's about to get crazy
I didnt know about Bob Gurr before this episode, but I enjoy how close his name is to Bob Iger
What will you do about Grian’s floating rock circle? Have you guys coordinated potentially moving it?
Toy Storey
Name for the toy store: fun and fantasy!
You should name the toy store "the Scarland Entertainment Emporium"
I just arrived at Disney and this is the first video I see
“Well hello there.” -Scar every season of hermitcraft
I think the name, Jollie Jellie is cute!
Call the shop Toys scR' us (toys R' us bu scar)
You know you love a creator when you go to like their video and u realise you’ve already liked it. Love ur positive spirit and content Scar!!  Edit: I’ve literally done it three times after writing this comment -  it’s been 8 minutes.
The beautiful purple toy shack needs to be called Whimsy’s Toy Shack
Toy store: Scars-ᴙ-Us
the shop should be called "Jellie's Empawrium" :)
Put glow stone under a slab to keep your ground lit up 💙💙💙
Name for the building: The Mystical watchamacalit Emporium Also you could put cat silhouette banners on the lampposts
Weasley wizards wheezing
When you do the book for cubfan, you should write “Landscaping your mind” from the Grian Audible Ad
Name the Toy Shop after a Prince song: "Purpur Rain" (also fit's with the Jellie theme.)
The gift shop name could be Jellie’s Trading Post, which is not only a nod to Toy Story Land’s main gift shop but could also imply the Jellie character herself has found/collected the trinkets sold :]
In the UK there is a famous toy store called Hamleys  I'd like to suggest calling the toy store Pigleys, and making a pig mascot for the store
I love your video. You are yelling at docs announcements, a beautiful timelapse to match our beautiful new redstoner!! I think Magic Mountain Menagerie would be a great name for your store!!❤
Ngl I thought mumbo was gonna be the redstone engineer lol
9:05 That joke caught me off guard
I have some ideas for the toy shop! 1: Jellie juniors Toys 2: scar works 3. Terrific trinkets 4. Timmytastic toys 5. Cavern castle 6. The jelly jinx 7: to the scars 8. Build a jellie/scar 9. Boatems bears  10. The scar bizarre  11. The witches cap 12. The spike cake  13. The final life ——————————— I also have some ride names for future rides! 1. Jellies jam 2. Tipsy tervy track 3. The scar ship
I absoulutely love your fantastic buildingstyle👏👍✨️. Scarland is so impressive and the entrance is so cool🎉🌞. I really like the cherry bonsai too👏👏. The toystore could be named Scar'let toys and games😁
Ahh Doc was merely showing how you could optimise Scarland announcements. He so desperately wanted the job as redstoner that he even used a Grian quote to end his morning message!
Name for store: the store it’s toys will scar your life … isn’t amazing?
Thought about a ride through the red stone of decked out? Trip through the nether maybe to shorten the distance? It could be cool.
Magic Deco Stuff.
The build is so gorgeous! If you want the true european train station experience, you need more pigeons and bird poop ;)
Jellies Toy Tower!
Toy Tumble Town
Please! Name the toy store  Talisman Toy’s or The Talisman Toy store! It’s so cute!
Scar builds a toy store...  Should name it "Toy' Scar US" XD
'Toys sca"R" Us' obviously with the backwards R
This season is insane on a whole new level.
Dic.......tator 😂😂😂😂😂 that's pause Scar 😂😂😂😂. Ps we love Doc
Timmy's toystore
You always make me smile scar thanks for the new video
Will Scarland or Decked Out open first?
Scarred R us for the toy store
Amazing episode Scar! Super excited about everything going on!
the toy store could be named Madame Mysterie's Toy Shop as it looks very mysterious
Yay! New scar post!! :3
Good Toys With Scar
Doc's demo worked TOO well - application rejected for being over qualified
my son, (Moonshredder12) suggested "Doc M. Goats Fluffy Stuffy Toy Shop and Hospital." gives it a cutesy name and gets docs goat at the same time!
9:05 I got scared there for a second xD
Wow doc is insane the good kind of insane
Hey scar, since you are one of the biggest star wars fans I’ve ever seen, wouldn’t it be amazing to have a star wars section in Scarland? You already have a Razorcrest so why not combine your dream of scarland with the amazing universe that is star wars?
since the building for the toy store is made mostly from crimson stem (and mangrove, which is also red), my suggestion is "Crimson Curio"! or Crimson Curiosities—either works.
At 13:13 he missed and didnt strip one birch log! Can you see it?
name the toy shop should be jelly goods
Toy store should be called Jellie's Mystical Place.
scar your builds are always incredible, love what you do!! <3 <3 <3
So if jelly is the mickey mouse of Scar land, then whos the Oswald the lucky rabbit of Scar land?
sherrif timmys toys
You should call the toy store “Magenta’s Toy Shop” sense the color
A "Disney movie" with Doc as the villain would be awesome, as Scarland is based off of Disneyland
Dic tator hahahahahahahaha. I haven't even watched the whole vid yet, but that made me laugh out loud lol
Name the store the Magical Mabajery after scars mispronunciation of Grians S8 magic store
I can not get over Doc is such a dic...........  tater. I laughed so hard everyone in the breakroom. Stared at me
lol Scar went pretty fast from “I wanna hear that again,” to “I don’t ever want to hear that again.” Well done Doc, perfectly menacing, immaculately terrifying, like something out of a George Orwell novel
I think you should name the toy shop “Scarlands Hippy Toys” or something along those lines
What did you with the pane of pain??? Someone signed up for Hawkeye lessons in Hawkeye HQ like 3 weeks ago by the way.
I was getting worried in 9:03 that Scar was going to become a liiiiitle PG-13... Haha...
Pearl gave scar the pay back to doc with the eggs. Scar can go ham by touching the eggs and the eggs are right by doc's area.
Scar's treasures
doc has become a what?
Store name suggestion: "Playful Scarlet"  it has your name in it and plays well with the red theme of the Bulding
I haven’t been watching hermitcraft for like two weeks and I cried when I heard his beautiful intro
Cub is going to far
Toy Store Name: '*Timmy's Toys*'
❤Scar I am a huge fan and I love ur Chanel one question is that are you going to have roller coasters 🎢 in SCARLAND?
Toys sca"R" Us lol
8:40 joey drew sounding ahh
It is going to be funny to watch Grian agonise over moving the stone arch to become symmetrical with your entrance building.
Name the toy store Wonder Toys!
For the toy store name i was thinking Jellie's Toy Box. Keep up the great work scar, your content always put a smile on my face
name the toy store 'jimmy's wonderland'
Boatem back together Again! And the octagon is the opposing team!
Scars toy store
Jellies toy box or barn
Im not gonna even exaggerate how hard I laughed at 9:06, Scar’s comedic timing is too good.
Hola
You should call it Timmy’s Toys!!
I think the sign needs to be BIGGER scar ngl
2:31 I got a good idea, since it’s a toy store, name it scars R us… ANYONE A AGREE Raise your hand if yes
Timmys Toy House
What about “Sangria Toy Shop”?      Sangria (pronounced sang-gree-uh) is a dark red-ish purple that reminded me of the crimson wood you used to build it. Plus it starts with “s” like “Scarland”!
Maybe if you find a good spot you could add a mountain chain as the backdrop for part of the bark and add an aurora over the mountains. I just really want to see a good builder built such a phenomenal.
With Impulse and Pearl working as employees of Scarland now we only need Gem to show up and the Soup Group will be assembled
The Magical Memorium for the toystore
The shop should be called Jellie Joy's Toys! :D
9:06 this is definitely one of the scar moments of all time
Scar's toys n' stuff i think is good
Please sell jimmy toys in the toy shop lmao. Jimmy's Toy Barn is an amazing name but not originally suggested by me
Just make the allay drop the items at a noteblock
9:06 Certified Scar moment.
2:30  Timmy's (or Jimmy's) Toy store! Maybe you could get a little Sherif hat or badge in a display on the front of the store!
Shop name: scars r us
name for the store: tremendous toyz! great vid btw!
I think the toy shop could be jellie and friends toy shop
You should name the shop Timmy’s toy store
You should call it deep deep depth toys! You said it was a toy shop and there is a bunch of coral! Plus it has a bunch of dark colors so.. ya that’s why you should call it deep depth toys!
Maby Timmy’s Toy Chest?
Scarro’s emporium
ToyLand ❤
Name suggestion for shop woody toys   Like woody in Toy Story
2:15 link the allay to a note block and they will continuously throw their items at it then pick them up again
“Doc has really become a dic…tator”   Good save scar
Doc is such a dic... tator, isn't he?
Is scar no longer PG?
OMG, CUB HAS BECOME THE BRITISH MUSEUM!!!!!!! :0
I suggest "Al's Toy Barn" for the toy store, like the store in the Toy Story Movie. Then you can sell Jimmy's toys there 🤣
Scarland Toy Emporium
I think the shop should be called the Good Times Emporium
Toy storery
You should call the toy store eith scra in the box, Scar's toybox, or Tango-are-you-done-with-decked-out-yet!
Toy store name  -ScarLand Merchandise-
I think Scar may have been brainwashed already by Doc’s announcements.  He called him ‘beloved LEADER’ while contemplating revenge.
Goodtimeswithtoys
I think the toy shop should be called "Duncans Toy Chest", in reference to Home Alone 2. I think it makes sense cause its a toy shop, and also has a bunch of chests in it
2:35 What about?  Jellie's mystic treasures
He has becme a dic... tator. :,)
Jimmy's toy store.  Home of the one and only Jimmy toy
Joel’s Toy Barn.
Toy Store name: Pock O'Pea's. A CPOP Industries Corp.
The purple Tulip Toyshop. That is my suggestion for the shop. Hope you like it. I just love your builds❤, thank you so very much for the great content
Jellies cat toys should be the name of the shop
The toy shop should be called the "mysta-shack, or something like that!
The park doesn't accept children?!?
Jimmy's Toy Barn
For the toy shop: Teddy's toy corner
Toy store name - McAllisters. Gives me Home Alone vibes
9:05 I almost fell of my chair laughing
The thank you sign should have a capital T
Doc has become Glados
Name for shop: Marvelous Mysterious Manifestation
You could maybe name the toy store something like "Andy's Bedroom" or "Woody & Friends" or something like that ^^
For the toy store, it could be The Mangrove Emporium or Jimmy’s Toy Emporium!
Doc has really become a dic....tator lololololol
Toy store should be Jellies Jollies
The toy shop should be called “Good Times with toys”
You should call the toy store "Toy Store-y"
2:45 PURPLE GLOBE!!
🦆
Toystore name: Timmy's Terrific Toys
Docs sound system is his application for scarland btw
The toy store should be called “Tumble Town Toy Store” or “Timmy’s Toy Shop” because everyone knows that Jimmy is a toy
Name the store tom
Toy shop name: Scar's Pinky funs
don't know why but Deep Purple has a nice ring to it you can name it like that
I really think you have figured out the perfect structure for your Hermitcraft videos. They are all so well written with a good combination of progress and funny moments and interactions. Well done Scar.
Timmy’s house or the house of Timmys should be the name of the toy store
You should give the toy store an attic and then you can call it the toy stories
Jellie's Joyful Toy Shoppe
What if you were to give those allays a bunch of gold? What kind of shower would they give you then?
Love your videos! A name idea could be "jellie's timeless toys"!
That entrance is simply mind blowing :O I love it!
“Toymorrow Land” for the toy shop.
I found out i’ll be needing dialysis so is helpful to see you thrive and me not feel like everything i’ve wanted to do will have to be forgotten..
Scar call the toy store  Timmy's Toy Store
As an homage to empires maybe name the toy store 'Jimmys Jamboree' a nice place for toys to hang out
Love how much the park has expanded. I would so love to go to a place like this on a vocation. :) What about "Good Time Games" for a toy shop?
Scary Toys
“Good Time Trinkets” for the shop. Suits the cosy mysterious feel I think
I know we've gotten a lot of Scar and Grain content but I'd love to see Grain steal the trolley from the museum especially after the egg hunt incident....
Hey scar! One idea I had is if you wanted to do a western theme, you could do a western town thats buried underground. It would be a really cool atmosphere and plus it would add more room for the other lands! I also feel like it would even be cool to do in the jungle theme where it could be like ruins or something.
Maybe the cave of wonders for your toy store, after Aladdins cave 😊
The toy store could be called Jimmy’s House
I've been having debilitating pain for the last 4 months, which has made me very aware of lack of accessibility of a lot of places. You including that seating for disabled people made me cry. Thank you so much
I do love how cub has taken the british approach to museum filling, by just stealing other people's stuff to display
2:41 . My idea for the toy shop name is the Emporium of Eccentricities.
I vote we name the toy store - jelly's toybox
You should make a tailor/suit store in Scarland
It is funny how Scarland has no real rides or games when it is close to opening 😂. But that doesn’t matter as it brings happiness with or without those anyway :3
toys'scar'us
Name the toy store 'Tumble Town'
Congrats impulse
who're you gonna get hired on as being the delivery guy for all the supplies that Scarland will end up needing to keep it's shops, stalls, and stands stocked?
Name for the store, “Toy Store-y”
Jellie Joy as a toy store name came to mind!
the dear leader comment sent me XD
How about Jellie bean toy shop? Does that sound good?
You should name the building the jukebox
Dear Scar, my suggestion for the shop name would be Toyscarus 😉 2:55
Since you mentioned Bob Gurr in the video, "Gurrific Toys" came to mind for a cool name for the toy store.
The toy store should be called GoodTimeWithScar's Imagination Emporium.
You should name it something related to Jimmy/Timmy
Grian: puts up portal to clearly demarcate the bounds of his territory  Scar: Maybe I'll just push it back a bit
Doc is literally the server's supervillain at this point lmao. SCARLAND IS AMAZING THO!!!!! IM SO EXCITED FOR PHASE 2!!!
"He knew we would push that button!" Well yes, Scar that's how all of this started
How about Tickle Me Purple Toys?
Toys 'R Mine toystore
I would be nice if you return the favour to Doc by recording your own custom music disk. Perhaps your own rendition of the classic song _It's a Scar World After All_  I'm sure he would _love_ to listen to that every morning
the purple building looks like a “moug”
the toy store should definetly being called Scars R Us as a reference to Toys R Us. That would definetly be very original
toy store-y?
Since the Park is Jellyland after your cat jelly why not call the toy store "Kitten Kaboodle" kitten for baby jelly and kadoodle to cover all the little toys and knick knacks you'll be setting from it.
Toys Scar Us
The Toystore name should be : Jimmy’s Boutique or Bazaar 👌🏼
The pause between “dic” and “Tator” keeps throwing me off… I have problems
Yay! Scarland would have seating for me!
For the Allay issue: is there some way you could attach a calibrated skulk sensor to trigger a note block in the direction of the player? Maybe have it only activate from the sound of a nearby hermit eating a random scar land food product to incentivize sales. Also since the note block noise is kinda gross you could also have the skulk sensor trigger a juke box to play a custom music disc of some sort that I believe will make the Allays dance a bit, although I’m unsure if both mechanics would work at the same time  PS: Silly Goat Themed attraction at scar land poking fun of doc
If you're looking for a catchy name for the toy store, consider TuneTime Toyland. The store's design resembles an old jukebox and the name perfectly captures its playful vibe.
Is there rides?
Toy Shop Name Idea: The Curio Corner
Toy store? Should be “Jimmy’s".
with the coral in the toy store, my thought for the name could be Collector's Cove? or something like that? ✨
For the toy shop in scar land you should name it “Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium” it’s a movie I watched as a kid and it was magical and awesome highly recommend watching
You should name the toy store "Toy Storee"
Toyshop should be called "Timmy's Barn" or similar :P
You should name the toy store “Timmy’s Toys” with a picture of Solidarity on the front.
I think "Toys Scar Us" would be a great name for the toy store
Did not think that Scarland would be open before Decked Out!
Shanky Shak @Angi
HAHASJDH DICTATOR
Jesus! Docs announcements are just creepy and Dystopian!!
Can the toy store be Jimmy’s R Us or Jimmys Toy Round Up
you should name the building jimmy the toy
the toy store should be called something like empire’s mark or jimmy’s guesthouse (or something with jimmy in general)
I was hoping you would hire Grian to write Scarland and thank you in cursive over your entrance/exit
I think the shop could be called 'Boombox Toys', as to me, the front sign really looks like a boombox!
The Timmy toy store
Comment👍
Bypass to allay shower handoff transfer to others: just rehanding by a new master as allays are retameable.  By rehanding and unequiping the handed item as if a saddle to loyalty. Info is via theft in lifesteal smp stories.
Scarland is looking amazing, can't wait to see what you build next. You should call the toy show "Sheriff Jimmie's Toy Corral"
I haven't smiled this broadly at a Hermitcraft episode in months. I'm grinning ear-to-ear all the way through this episode.
a cool name for the toyshop would be "Jellies Toybox"! 19:51 SCAR SWEARED WHAT
You are an absolute mad man. Just when I think Scarland couldn't get any cooler and then BAM! Crazy cool entrance.
One of the stores definitely needs to be called Jellie’s Bellies (like the Jelly Belly candy, but our Jellie)
14:58 add this for scar without context 😂
Dracula comes First to my mind when I See the Building.
The toy store should be called Timmy's Toy Town after Jimmy :)  Also that DICKtator joke was fantastic 😂
I was thinking Toys Scar Us for the toy store! Love your content, Scar!
Toy stories. Name for the shop
Scar you gotta build a rollercoaster in scar land! It would be so epic
docs signals remind me of the arkham games!
Name for the store: Crazy Crimson.
Jimmy's toy shop!
Hey, Scar. I thought it would be really cool to have records of ambient noise in strategic places throughout the park, like kids laughing, people chatting, etc., maybe a barbershop quartet on main street. It would really bring the whole experience as Hermits walk through.
Toy storey is a good name for the store
3:10 gosh my heart dropped when you said that. 😆
"This park doesn't accept children."  *Looks at the child armor stands in disbelief*
The toy shop should be called “Jelly’s mystical toy store!”
Brilliant video scar cheered my day up, me and my family are being evicted because the landlord is in his 90s he wants to retire, our local council has been messing us about and we are in a bad way, yours and other hermits videos are a big help in these trying times.
Call the store the Toy Box!
Scar’s wonderous/wonderful emporium.
You should name it "The SCARlet Toybox"
toy store: Jellies Toys
The building should be named  Scar's toy workshop
Sponge all of doc‘s water
Probably won't be picked but a name for the toy store could be.....  Gigantic jellie jesting store. By the way jesting means fun or entertaining. HOPE I HELPED!!!
I think you need to speak to Grian about that rock behind your entrance. It just takes away from your build. He'd probably move it if you helped him. You should not poke the GOAT!
you should name the toy store “The Raspberry” :3 it sounds like the perfect magicalish name for a perfect magicalish park <3
Toy store name.... "imagination station"
i’ve recently been in a long depressive episode and your episodes have always been a great break from reality. thank you so much for creating a safe and fun place for all of us and truly being yourself 💜💜💜
I kinda want to suggest "Timmy's Taboo Toyshop" for the toy shop or "Timmy's Transcendent Toys" something along the more magical lines
Red Rose
I request you name said Toyshop 'Scar's Toyorium'. It has a nice ring to it.
3:41 Castle in the background 🤌
The good times toy store
If the park is not open yet, is every person enjoying the park there tresspassing?
For toy store maybe:little sheriff toy store
i showed my friend your base, showing them how much detail you put in to all of it (it's so cool!!!!) and they wanted to know if you have included fire exits and i am now wondering as well! saftey first!!!
9:07 out of context clip material right there
I swear scar only uses Howl, because it sounds like it could be from Top Gun.
Amazing builds as usual scar
Scar you pause at the worst time in dictator, what to expect now lol <3
Some ideas for the store name:  Jellies Purr-fect Playhouse Jimmy and Jellie's Whimsy Toy Alley Jimmy's Whimsy Wonderland The Wonderful World of Creation and Imagination Whistlestop Wonder Emporium
20 bucks they outsource it to the lifesteal guys
It was not because you rammed into the target block it was because you set off a firework as you hit the target block it registered the firework.
Tic Tac Toy as a name for the toy store. It was my daughters idea, she loves watching the build Scar, it looks amazing!
you should call it the woody the toy store
Seeing you accomplishing a dream of your lifetime is more than amazing! Keep inspiring others and showing them diligence and patience do make dreams come true! We love you Scar!
9:19 "I want to hear that again"  Scar, don't you know why they say to be careful what you wish for?
Cant wait till the whole perimiter is a lake ... talk about grinding 🤣
Solidarity Statues Store!
Scar, those speakers on the GOAT's flagpole are broadcasting the announcements as a demonstration of his handywork.
That entrance is BEAUTIFUL!! And it so perfectly encapsulates both the rest of Scarland as well as that particular theme park feel, you most certainly nailed it! The park feels so much more complete with every expansion it gets and this is no exception 🥹 My laptop wallpaper is quickly getting outdated I see
Sabotage the PA system! Replace his voice over with something of your own.
Love the video Scar! Keep up the amazing work. And as for a name for the Toy Store, I got this (drum rolls) Scarland Toy Land
What about the crimson cat tower as the name for the toy store?
Ooh, you could name it 'The Sheriff's Little Toy Shop' As a reference to our friend Woody from the Empires crossover!
did scar really just say "doc has just become a dic...tator"? XD
Just call the toy store "Jimmy's"
I think a good name for the toy store would be "Ready Set Toys!"
Jimmy giblets is perfect for the toy store
Scar. That entrance is so beautiful. And it looks amazing in the background at the end of the street, with the cupola framed by the custom trees.
Toyscar us lol 😂😂😂😂
Did he ever figure out Doc build the sound system for him?
Build Name Idea: "The Cherrypicker" as it has the colours of a cherry, and people go there to pick and buy toys.
Scarland don't have any attractions beside the castle and stores
We 100% see how deliberate and specific you are with this insane build!! So much care in everything, its absolutely gorgeous already and so detailed
Cub is the British Museum of hermit craft
Idea for a prank on doc: cover the entire hole he lives (I predicted it)
I hope. I hope that the season finally is a timelaspe of the production of scarland.🙏🏾
Absolutely love your videos scar I literally smile from beginning to the end of every single upload you are a beautiful soul❤
doc a whole Far Cry villain
Ive been binging impulses phasmo streams but impulse in hermitcraft still is a separate "person" from impulse with face cam
You should name the toy store 'Jimy's ToyStore'
Toy story's
Scar, Doc is showing off his PA system. He could do the soundd engineering for Scarland if you make peace and get him to turn off his PA system
i feel like the toy shop gives off a magicians vibe so mystique magic, mystic magic, magicians miniatures or magic miniatures would be fitting imo :)
Toy Emporium?
I don’t have a name for the toy store but you should label the door “free diamonds!” In front of the door with exploding creeper
can you make a pet shop?
Scar should name the toy shop jellie-in-the-box toy shop
You shuld name the toy store toyster store
9:05 took me by surprise there
"doc has really become a dic-tator"  scar why did u pause
Idk, I think Doc is just showing you his resume for making park-wide announcement systems.
Scar threatening Doc but yelling at Zedaph instead nearly made me spit tea all over my screen 😀
The toy shop could be like ScarsRus like ToysRus haha
The toy shop could be called "Toy Storey" or "Toy Store E"     The E can stand for something
Is that MCC Redstone MONSTER IMPULSESV working on SCARLAND?? Oh I’m in!
Scar needs to hire gem as a security guard so he can have the whole soup group work for him 😂
The Buttercups slowly becoming the YA Protagonists of a Dystopian novel fighting against the Evil Goat Corporation was not on my 2023 Hermit Bingo list but I love it!
Good times toy land
"The Tip Top Terrific Scarland Toy Shop" I just like silly alliteration
Make a shop with stuffed animals and merch
Toy store idea: Jellies Toys and Joys
Leo's Toy Store
scar its slushies not slushys
Thanks!
pinkytoy <storename>
Toy store name idea: Timmy & Company for our best toy friend
Lots of great applicants but Impulse deserves it for doing his research
Hay scar the video was a little sideshow on my side
Doc welcomes all of you to 1984, have you made the Goat proud today?  Lol <3 Doc and his reactions/revenge.
2 Thing ! Remove Grian´s Stone Entrance and please at least build one rollercoaster in that EPIC base
name the toy store after the toy man himself, jimmy (the sheriff from empires)
Best I can come up with for the toy store as of now is: 'Andy's Bedroom'. Any reference to Jimmy or Tumble Town would be hilarious
Is there still a head of the sherrif from empires? (I forgot his name) i feel like that would be perfect for the toy store
toy store name idea: Toyscar Us
I think Scarlet Manufacturing or Trouble Town Toys are fun names for a toy store.
scar, pearl, and impulse are working at scarland, and grian and mumbo are their neighbors... are we getting boatem back together? :D
Get revenge on doc by playing "its a small world" in the perimeter
The toy store should be called like Andy’s Chest or something Toy Story themed like that and you should have the Tim toy boxes in there too
Wow. I didn't see that plot twist coming. Scar has been the evil mastermind all season. It all becomes clear once you ask yourself, "Who does Number 2 work for?" lol
You can call the shop “Jelly’s Joyful Toys”
hey scar an Idea for your toy store could be "Scar, and Jellys Toy Barn" because it reminds me of toy story 2
2:45: toy stories
Good Toys with Scar
Timmy's Tinkies could be a good name for the toy shop
That entrance is amazing!!! You are Sutch a talented creator scar❤❤❤
Oooh, the interior of the toy store reminds me of decked out, maybe The Dungeon Master’s Toyshop?
Anybody else is worried that the season would before he finishes the park?
@GoodTimesWithScar PLEASE find a way to change Doc's propaganda to announce the Grand Opening of Scarland!!!
the thank you over the gate adds such a nice and realistic touch
I can't quite come up with one I'm satisfied with but something with "Marvelous" for the toy store!  Scar's Marvelous Toys? Scarvelous Marvelous Bits and Bobs? Marvelous Scar's Land of Toys?
You'll come to love the GOATannoy System. He built it as a demo for a new sound system for Scarland
I'm surprised no one has made a "Toy Store-y" pun yet.  Instead everyone is Jimmy crazy.
Another name idea came to me; what if we called it Scarland (or Jelli's/insert name here) Imaginarium! Then ofc there is also my first idea Jelli's Toy (or Joy, Toy Joy) Emporium
I LOVE the build, but the font makes the exit look like “tHANK yOU” to me.
i think the shop should be called Jellie's Toybox! Or maybe The Toy Empawrium/Jellie's Empawrium.
Roller Coaster Toy Croon for the shop's name
how about "Scar-y Toys" for the toy store?
You should name it Toy storeY (pronounced Toy Story )
2:50 The coral corral!!
You should call the toy store: Scar Story (In reference to the Disney movie: Toy Story)
So scar has hired Pearl and Impulse so far... now only Gem is missing out to complete the soup group! And I know the perfect job for her: anti-goat security XD. Doc has said multiple times that he is terrified by Gem, after all.
Robots
Its not symmetrical with grians arch
As soon as scar announced it inew impy was the right choice.
8:21 Someone pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease take this out of context!!!!
I think the buttercups should swap out the discs from Docs announcements with actual motivational sayings. I just imagine Doc logging in and hearing Grian say, remember to always live, laugh, and love.
The toy shop should be called Jimmy Toys or NotaToy lol.
I’d name the toy store “Scars of Stars”
Scar is just incredible
The name could mybe be similiar to Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes,  it would be fun, something like "Scarslands Strange Source of Fun" or something like that XD
You didn't like doc's admission very much
Scar not realizing that doc took over his own Intercom system was slightly frustrating, but funny too.
Idea for the toy store name,Jimmies jumbo jive! Or,better yet,Timmys Toy track!
I dunno… The building could be Toy Story Store?
The building should be called GoodToysWithScar
The toy store should be called "Talisman Toys"
bruh docs speakers gave me flashbacks to Di Revellos propaganda speakers in Just Cause 3 XD
Boatem 2.0 around Scarland, so excited to see Scarland develop even further!!! Beautiful work <3
The new building should be called the Purple Emporium. Rolls off the tough kinda well.
"Scarland Toy Emporium" sounds good, or "Mr. Scar's Wonder Emporium"
The Scarland Imaginarium
Scar’s Funtime Emporium could be a fun name for the toy store
Toy stor E
name it wheels and deals
Cub pulling the ol' British museum job I see
This building looks like the butter cow house in the Iowa state fair
The toy store should be called  scars wonderful land of toys
Name it a toys story
A dic...tater
Absolutely love Impulse, but on WHAT planet was becoming Doc's boss not the play?!? 😂 Those dystopian announcements were the perfect demo of your speaker system turned up to 11! 😂  I reckon you could hire Doc to be Impulse's assistant..... xD
Jelli's Toy Emporium  OmgIi love the park so much!! <3333
🤣😂🤣😂 Doc is becoming a dic...tator
For the Toy store names: - Woody's Toy Store (Woody from Toy Story) - Jellie's Toys - Play. Toy. Fun - Scar's Childhood Toys - Toying Around Store
welp, i guess there is only 1 solution now for the goat problem: cover up the perimeter, just terraform over it like it was never there
Far cry 5 vibes
Some ideas for the shop. Hope you like them. They are also variable. Toy(land) Adoption Center Funland Friends Mr. Scariums Wonder Emporium Scarland Squeezes 'n' Wheezes Joyful Jelly Jellie in Wonderland or Jellie ('s/in) Joyland Jellie Jollification or Jelliefication PlaypalsPlushparade
The First Thing that came to mind for the toy store was :Scar's Goofs and Gaffs
Please name the toy shop TIMMY'S TOY LAND 😂😂😂
9:05
Toy Store name: Toy Store-y (Toy Story) (very smart joke)
Scarland's Enchanted Corner is a cool name for the toy store
2:30  Scars Secret Serenade
Scarland Park Treasures or Wondercorner toy shop or Scarland Whimsy Wonders
When I was a kid, there was this magical little toy emporium on main street that was easily the best toy shop in town. It was run by a man with the best Donald Duck impression and every time I went in there, I felt a sense of wonder, even as a teen. It was called "Toys for the Fun of It" and I think that name would capture the wonderment you're creating with Scarland.
Tip your top toys!
You truly are building the great big beautiful tomorrow of hermitcraft! I can’t wait to see what’s next!
The interaction between Scar and Impulse had me grinning the whole time 😊
i saw the thumbnail, giggled and did a little clap, it looks so amazingly cool
Doc has become a what?!
very wholesome episode !
I think you should name your toy shop Scar's toy chest like the store from home alone 2
Name it Frankless
Now you just need to hire gem
"Tiny Timmy's Toy Box"  also you may want to have some kind of background walls along the 'Scarland' and 'Thank You' text because it kind of visually merges into the handing lights behind it when looking up at what it says, even something like stained glass might be enough to have it visually separate, but that is just my opinion having only seen it from your video
It'd be really cool if at the end of the season, the server is copied to a public server, with blocks being unbreakable. Then anyone can join and explore and have fun with fellow hermitcraft fans.
9:08 "Doc has really become a dic- _tator_ " XD
you gotta name the toy store ‘Sheriff Jimmy’s Toy Barn’!
Lol. I knew that slip impulse made on his stream was legit. 😂
How about the name: Fun Toys in Scarland
I think there is still something important missing in the park: attractions. Aside the castle and the shops, there is nothing to do in scarland. Can't we have a haunted house, a Ferris Wheel or roller coaster, or at least a few mini-games?
toy store name: Jimmy's wonderland
Tinkering Tony's Toyhouse
You should have the ally’s collect gold so you can have a Golden shower 😂
Did scar just cursed
Imagination .  Motto: Big or Small, Toys 4 All.
there are no words to express how happy i am when scar posts
9:05 Scar, Gigachad on Wheels
Toy-Storey would be a funny name i think!
I hope the toy store will be named Build-A-Scar
The scream of terror when that unsuspecting peaceful little allay flew over to Scar ahahahaa
Maybe you can pay another homage to The Sheriff (aka Woody) and name the shop ‘Tumble Town Toys’?
Name the toys store.  World of scar land. Just like world of Disney
Toy'Scar Us
Maybe for the toy store, you could call it "Jellie's Toy Box"
scar 100% knows what hes doing every time he says DOC YOU STUPID DIC... TATOR he even pauses between the word
Since Jellie is the mascot, what about 'Kitties and Kiddies Toy Store'?
It's surely got to be called "Toy Store-y"
so for a name idea for the toy shop i thought oh scars toy tavern. if this dose get chosen can you shout out griffinjedi10?
'Tri-County toy shop' in reference of where toy story is set :D
Shop name :- Jimmy's toy store I will be disappointed of it is anything else 😅😌😌
9:07 great place to place a cut guys.
If the toy store isnt called "Sheriff Jimmy's Toy Town" i might cry
Scar’s cinematography in his videos is amazing. It is almost like a documentary with a live action narrator.
9:05 doc has really became a dic-tator 😂 Scar please don't mess these type of words They become something else 😂😂😂
"Doc has literally become a dic.. tator in this perimeter"-Scar
Does it bother anyone else that Grian rock entrance is just slightly off from the Scarland entrance now? Not just me right? -Kie
This is amazing scar. Name suggestion for the shop. AquaScar's Toys. It's both a nod to previous seasons and the decorations outside give me aquatic vibes so calm and peaceful.
Yes!  I knew when Scar dropped off the radar, he was working on an amazing, ambitious project :D
"Doc really has become a dic...tator"
Scar you should make some rides
The toy shop should be called Toys, Trolleys, and Trinkets
SCAR! Scarland is laggy because of all the chests under it! It gives Minecraft a hard time 😢
9:05
❌ Being able to complete the job ✅ Knowing facts about Bob
F.A.O Scarz
Great vid scar! Maybe the toy shop could be called Twisted Toys because of its mysterious nature? Have a good one!
Scar said dic tator
scar wants so badly to call doc a d word, but he keepin it family friendly by adding -tator to the end, peak comedy
Scar, you're obscenely talented wow
Scar, you've got to put a SolidarityGaming head in your Toy Store
The toy shop should be Jam & Jellie and sell little Jellie plushies!
Jellie’s Trinket Tower! (Name for toystore?)
‘The Timmy Toy Barn’ hehe!
You should name the Toy Shop Duncan’s Toy Chest as a reference to Home Alone
Some toy shop suggestions for you!  The Lucky Cat’s Paw or Tumble Toys or the Tumble Town Toy Shop
Call the Shop: Jellie's Tinkering Toys
There is one building that is blue and orange. You should make it something to do with Perry the Platypus because it looks exactly like him
You could name the shop "Jesters Joyfull Toys"😃
Since it's red you should do strawberry jelly toy shop
Since you already have Perl for cleaning and Impulse for Redstone, you might as well hire the 3rd, Gem as Security. She is the one person on the server that Doc is actually afraid of.
For some reason Doc’s announcements remind me of Bendy and the Inc Machine 1 where the ink guy with the fake bendy mask (I forgot his name but just before you meet Boris) says similar threatening things in the same way
Toy store name: GoodToysFromScar-land
The toy shop should be timmie’s toys
Love your videos Scar!!! Im a bit of a sap so i would say ,"A gift from Jelly" for the toy store
For the toy shop name, how about: “Scar’s Blocky Toy Bazaar: Crafting Fun in Scar Land”    +Thanks scar for being an amazing person.
9:06 ?????
Doc is such a dic-tator
lest goooooo keep up the good work scar love your build.
It joys me to see how fond and full of childlike awestruck Scar becomes when Impulse talks about Bob Gurr. Such cute enthusiasm.
You should name your toy store, Joyful For Toys!
That might be The lost Alley I know one of the other Hermits lost an Alley I just can't remember who it was but the lead broke and it wondered off you should catch it and let them know that you found their lost little one. A broad announcement should do it they were just talking about it recently.
LMAO  Scar: Doc had really become a dic....tator.
Toy Store'y
Oh, and good call not giving Cub any more access to the park than he already has, man's gone full-on British Museum already. You don't want to wake up one day to find the entire park stol- er, "accessioned."
impulse is probably the hermit who needs the 32 diamonds the least
"Doc has really become a dic-tator of this perimeter"
The stone arch in front of the entrance isn’t lined up.
I'm going to give the laziest name suggestion ever but you should totally call the toy store something like Toy Stor(e)y or some other pixar's toy story reference
I really want the toy shop to be named: The Magenta Menagerie
9:05 made me jump
Hmm. How about for the store: Scarland Toys, Tips and Tricks. (TNT not included).  I don't have ideas but I will return if I have more
"Jellie's Cat Tree" for the toy store? Also, you'd better move fast to depose the Dic-tator, or who knows what he'll unleash next!
The Toy shop should be called "Toys Scar us"
You could name the Toy store Toys and Joys.
9:02 😭
Hire Gem as security at the park
Unloose Toys and Trinkets
Scar Safe Toy Base
As an archeologist, I'm so "happy" to see that the museum guys have included the curation crisis and robbing of people's belongings.
its crazy what you can build in survival!
The Toy store should be called Toys R Scar
19:48 My mind: WOW SCAR oh never mind.   I know he did it earlier too
Love the color palette for the entrance! Didn't know those blocks went together so well. Scar, you are a master builder!
Seeing this project come together over the past year and a half (!!!) has been incredible. I can't wait to see the themed lands in phase 2.
You could call the toy store “Fun Factory”
Hey Scar I know this isn’t the most amazing name but: Scars Toy Vault/Chest. Or something along those lines Maybe but I’m not the best with names though
I think a scum and villainy style Star Wars cantina would go great in the park as you already have the razors edge. You could sell blue milk. Love the content dude.
the arch from grian's build not lining up with scar's building bothered me so much
You should call the shop Jellies toy box!😁
Cant wait to get the world download and do a stroll along Scarvenue to the castle. LOVE IT!
I just thought of something and im gonna call it "HermitScraps" it would basically be people starting a server on the hermit craft world download where they make more progress on the "scraps" that the hermits left for them, i think it would be kinda cool!
I feel one of the themed lands needs to be an avengers campus style land but around a Hot Guy superhero team.
You should definitely call the toy store “Scar’s magical toy emporium”
You should name the toy store Jelly’s toy emporium
all hail our great goat leader
You should build a coaster under the terraformed land!
Name for toy shop- Scar's Toy Chest
I think the store should be called “second chance antiques” like that one shop in Toy Story 4 since it’s kinda a gloomy vibe.
Toy store name: Scars R’ Us Credit: Schwveetz (inside joke with my siblings, would be hilarious to see in hermitcraft❤️)
just need that fair ground music going hope theres no noise complaints lol
The toy story
09:04 Scar is just asking for no context compilations
Honestly, Doc not getting the redstone job makes sense...  he showed his skills by playing propaganda that is polar opposition compared to Scarland's theme. Not the best way to try to get a job.
Good job 🎉
Name the shop Timmy's Toy Store 😂
Twangfastic toys
9:07 okay the pause was intentional, you cant convince me other wise 😂
Jimmy’s Toy Storey
Impulse looks like a firefighter now... 😂😂😂
The Antiquities Emporium!
Scar, you should build a monorail train near your entrance over the Dolphin speed run path.  LMAO with the dictator joke 😂.
dic - tator  LOL
Name the toy store "Tim's Toys'
9:03 ... 🤣
We need a rolllercoaster!!! ❤
Yeah I'd pay for Scar tree building lessons
The toy shop needs to be name Tumble town out post
My brain is hurting over Grains arch that is not aligned with the entrance
You should call it the toy store-y
Is anybody wondering if grian’s arch is centred with scars entrance?
Name suggestion: "Toy Store-y" 😂
You should name the toy shop: Timmy’s toy store 😊
Toy store name: Jellie's Gymboree
Loved the episode! The entrance looks amazing and I love the hats for Impulse and Pearl! Will there be an Employee of the Month competition?? 😂❤
Not so pg Scar strikes again
I love how cubfan is embracing the "british museum" style of just nabbing it 😀
Maybe the shop name: the jolly shop
Doc sure is a tater for sure.
Love the entryway Scar! The only thing it needs(and you even have space for) is a rail line running right in that gap between the entry and the park. The entry building could serve as the station. Besides, there has to be a place for that train in the mechanical workshop to run! 🛤🚅
doc has really become a dic.....tator XD
I know amusement parks dont 100% need it, but i feel like you need at least one attraction. The standard would be a rollercoaster. Maybe you can implement one into the castle and make it look good?
I love seeing you here Scar.  I was thinking of "Scarcraft Creations" for the toy store, or any other building.  Keep up the amazing work Scar, you are awesome!
It should be named “Scars Mystacular Toy Shop”
That  entrance is out of the wold gorgeous! Amazing!
Awesome! Do you have plans for a roller coaster??
The biggest thing Impuls should do is build auto street lights to help make Scarland Scar safe
Sooooooo Pearl and Impulse are working in Scarland. Should hire Gem as security to have the entire soup group to oppose the dictator Doc
"Jimmy's Family and Friends inc." Has a nice ring to it.
Me: Scarland cannot POSSIBLY get any better.  (21:46) Scar: "No, no, no. The park doesn't allow children."  Me: 8D
Shop name suggestion: “Toys Scar Us” or something along those lines
WOAH SCAR, NO PAUSES WHEN SAYING “DICTATOR” YOU SAID “Doc is really a dic… tator of this perimeter”😂 9:07
I think it's important for all the flags to be blowing in the same direction 🤔😬👍✨
Maybe call the toy store timmys toy house
The Jingle jangler toy shop. I think that’s what you should call it
Sca-R-us
That subtle gap in 'dictator' at 9:07 was hilarious 😂
What about the pane of pain?
I like how at 19:50 scar adds the tator in dictator when talking about doc after a considerable pause
Thinking it was the rockets they were flying with that set off the target block, not their heads.
The entrance build is a work of art with a backdrop of works of art. Just amazing. Also, adding a vote for Jimmy’s Toy Barn, I saw that suggested in a couple of spots.
Toy Store Name suggestion:   TIMMY'S WORLD
The curious curio cabinet of curiosities! Or the wizard's curio cabinet. Or curious curios! 😊
I love docs megaphone system it’s so menacing and big brother, makes you want to fight against it 😂
Ello scar, regarding the building u showed 2:14, it really looks lika how a beetroot is. Dark pink interior and brown textured exterior. Just made me remember my grandma's beetroot curry.
Scar! I'm so thrilled for you! This is something you've always wanted to build in Minecraft and now it's only a few months away from being finished! I can hardly wait to see what you work on in the next episode!
Scar try muting music discs to avoid Doc’s announcements.
The toy store should be called Jellie's Joy Chest.
Scar R Us
you should call it Scars toybarn and sell some sherrif plushies!😂
You should name the store scar’s secret toy shop
9:05 Doc has become a WHAT??
Toy Scory
How about 'Jellie's playhouse' for the toystore.
Scar there is really just something so wholesome about your videos. Seeing you big up folks like Pearl, Impulse, Grian, and yes even Doc makes the "friends" part of HermitCraft really shine through.  I also got a big dumb grin on my face after seeing your pic for Park Redstoner.
Toy store idea: Toy Store-y
I love how he realized he cussed and decided to camouflage it by saying dictator
Call the toy store "Scarlett Tower Toy Store"
Tim's toy box
You should name your toy shop scare lands magical shop of fun bits and bobs and I love your videos and you inspire me to make a YouTube channel
I hope you mess with the announcement system to announce your own things, such as rallying support for the Buttercups.
I think you need to make some iron golems for security until you light Scarland up correctly.  As always, great build!
Toy Store: Jellie's Corner of Wonder and Happiness
You should call the toy shop Timmy's toys
For the toy store. I think it would be fun to name it Jimmy's Corner, or Andy is coming. Or something that uses those ideas
Leo toy store
Jelly's Japes
"Doc has really became a dic-(pause)" Scar, that's rude! "-tator." ah.
Name idea!  Showtime Scarland Toystore… Or Scarland Showtime Toystore
Why did he take such a long break whilst saying dic…tator
Yay! I was rooting for Impulse! It made me extra happy that you incorporated his beard into the hat as well!  Super excited for the park to open and to see all the cool rides you build. You may not like Doc's announcements, but I'd say you're doing the most (with the possible exception of Tango on Decked Out) to GOAT with Scarland by far.  If he's employee #2, then why does Pearl have #2 on her helmet? 😂😅
Toy Monster! When I first saw the chests in the back of the toy shop, my mind said "Monster!" so... Toy Monster! :D Plenty of potential for a monster jelly too maybe?
Why is the toy shop sign not tumble toy shop in honer of the best toy scar ever met aka Jimmy
Scarland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world. 🥰
For an American cub is acting suspiciously British with his museum atrifacts
The physiological warfare of those announcements is a great thing, terrible, yes, but great!
Toy store name idea... Like FAO Schwartz... GTW Scar Toy Store
I am missing the logic behind: “I cannot steal this back because of the museum code of conduct…. Sooo I need to hire a thief to steal it back” 😂
scar-let toys :)
Shop name: crazy creations!! :DDD
Can you make cub your theme park guard.
How about the Magical Toy Emporium for the Toy shop
You should create a super bubbly, catchy, and annoying Buttercup jingle and place them around (and inside) the perimeter.
You should name the toy shop scars scadudalerz (with a Z)
I feel like turning back on the Scarland morning and evening messages would be a good start for punishing Doc.
Jelly R US
You should name it Jellies Toystore
The toy store should DEFINITELY reference Jimmy. The Sheriff's Toy Store OR Jimmy's Tumble Toys
How do I make Doc's recording my morning alarm?
9:06 no way scar not PG anymore!?
mumbo has not uploaded in a while
For the toy store. My daughter is suggesting “Jellie’s Purrrrfect Toy Store” love ya Scar!
This name goes against my usual style but: Pinky-Panky Toys and More
Name the toy store "Toy Store E"
Do these work as two possible names for the toy store? Wonder Whims or Magic Trinkets
Toy shop idea; “Lockes and Loons”. Lockes for head-ware. Loons, short for balloons.
I am happy to hear someone else thought Doc's announcements felt like Bioshock. Seriously Doc was giving me Rapture/Columbia  flashbacks when he showed those off.
Impulse list a few of them blue flying things. You could ask him!?
My 3 names are   Mystic toys Magic goods  Mystical mercant   If you pick any of these names put chira on the sign
The toy store should be called Timmy‘s Wonderland
I am so excited to see the other hermits wandering through Scarland
You should call the toy shop "Solidaritoys" as a little nod to Jimmy
Scar works fast yesterday afternoon (well maybe more like 10 or 11 AM his time) on Xisumas stream yesterday he was still only like maybe a quarter of the way done with the entrance exterior if that even, so he built that entire thing did the Impulse Collab and edited the episode all within a day? Just one of those side buildings would've taken me like a week.
Scars”r”us 2:33 for the toy store.
Scarland entrance is looking absolutely amazing!!  Also lucky Mumbo and Doc (and possibly Grian?), being on a break and leaving you to deal with all the goat dictator shenanigans all by yourself.... :'c
I couldn't think of a toy store name, but please tell me there's going to be a secret establishment that serves adult beverages called "Hidden Scar's".
9:06 was the pause really necessary
I'm so excited to see what you do with the themed lands! Every step of this journey has been delightful and I'm so glad there's more to come! Keep up the incredible work
Fun fact: There is a basketball court inside of the Matterhorn ride at Disneyland in California
You should give impulse a small idimpy bar shop
The lowercase t and uppercase H in the "tHank you" sign on the entrance really bug me for some reason, was it intended
bro no wtf you just said 9:05
9:05 the strategic pause
I'm thinkinnnnnnnnnnng Tick-Tock Toys!
People Mover best ride ❤
Amazing!! The entrance looks so so good, I'm so excited for Scarland nearly being open!! And I love your reactions to Doc's messages, lol he made those speakers as his application to be your redstone engineer to upgrade your sound system, but also to be a scary dictator and at least that worked! But Impulse is working for you now, as well as Pearl, and being neighbours with Mumbo and Grian... it's a Boatem reunion!! Impulse wants to join in with the Buttercups vs Doc and Ren war, I hope he does so on your side! (Though it would be funny if he joins Doc while still working for you at Scarland! Also Pearl already made her own third side being against both sides for the dragon egg duping it seems lol.) Maybe since the toy shop has so much crimson planks in its design, it could be called Magical Magenta Mayhem?
Gosh, Scarland is turning out absolutely incredible, Scar. You are a true block artist and I tip my hat to you. :D
9:04 I did a double take when I heard this
The store should be named “Good times with toys”
I love that faithful allay follower. It should have a name to accompany Jellie. Peanut Butter? Toast? Something.
You should call the toy store "Scar's Toy Nook".
DocM77 is the GOAT!
Maybe the toy store should be named Hotguy's ✨Magical World Of Toys✨
For the toy store name at the beginning of the video, all I can think of would be "Krank's Knick Knacks" and you can have a cranky pillager or some other mean-spirited mob inside as the cashier. Hope this helps!🙂
Fine, I will admit it. I’m a 30 year old man from England who has a fiancé and an 8 year old daughter and I get as excited as a 13 year old girl at a Taylor swift concert when I see Scar or Grian upload a hermitcraft episode..
i know its a toy store but to me it looks like a palm reading and tarot cards place
I'm kinda sad you didn't include the interaction with X on his stream but we saw it in the timelapse, it was the funniest thing ever :D
Loved the build, but Grain's gate and the Scarland gate are conflicting each other. Something needs to change.....
Doc expected you to stop the speaker system.  Also I found it funny that you compared it to Bioshock as doc said it was inspired by BioShock. I guess he was successful in achieving what he wanted.   I was worried that you will drown doc with your silliness and he was trying to overengineer everything. But it looks like he can do the little annoying tricks too.
Will there be theme park rides in the park?
For the toy store: how ab world of scar? Bc the name of the big toy store in Disney world is world of Disney!
I know my sign suggestion may be basic but here we go. “Scarland Magical Toys & Gifts”
Doc's motto is great, but this prank war needs to end or we could see a repeat of season 6.
It's always a good day when Scar uploads! Exactly what I needed after a day of being sick at home. For the allay stations, the hermits could come up and activate a noteblock, which will make the allays drop them their items. Also, with the newly added customizable ranges on music discs, there could be tunes or messages played, when somebody enters any shop, in a way that it can only be heard by people in the shop, and not disturb anyone else. I think something like that could go a long way for creating an even more immersive atmosphere in Scarland! Don't worry about the technical stuff, I'm certain redstone genius Impulse will know exactly how to make it happen.
Toystore name: the numb plum
Such an American amusement park. All shops, no rides. :D (Amazing build still, amazing!)
Hot Guy's Gadgeterium
Name it Jimmy's room or Jimmy's toy box in honour of our toy friend from empires.
That toy store kinda reminds me of the Sanctum Sanctorum from Dr. Strange so I wonder if you were to call it "Strange Trinkets" or "The Playtime Sanctorium"
Toy store name idea: “Jellie’s Toy Box”   I needed this episode today. I was smiling the whole time and jammed out to the super fast build mode music. You are such a wonderful creator.   Thank you.
I hope Scar would hide Gem for security so that he can have the whole Soup Group as employees.
You should name the building "Purple Playtime Palace".
The name of the toy store could be "Good Toys With Scar"!
Or mysterious goods -chira
Jimmy's Toy Town ... and prob needs to sell sheriff badges for the kids
the marvelous wonders of scarland!
Mistirius Toys (MT) -Chira
the store looks like a classic duke box to me so i think it should be called jukebox toys
Jimmy's toy store, it has to be.
I think that the name of the toy store should be "Timmy's Toys" in reference to your empire friends and your Partnership with Jimmy over there.
You too can build happy little (or big) trees.
You are such an inspiration! I love that you are getting to live your Imagineering dream in your own way. ❤
“Scars R Us” has a nice ring to it for a toy store.
Before you open the park please fix the lighting
I thubk you and docm should have peace
oh you should DEFINITELY replace the audio in docs speakers with motivational quotes and relaxing music
Scar you should add a few balloons stuck under the entrance gate as if some kids let go of their balloons by accident and the floated up  and got stuck
Have you ever gone to the Efteling in the Nederlands? A lot of it is based on fairy tales, and the overall look of the park is beautiful
9:05 Very interesting choice of emphasis
Scar, you need to look up the entrance of The Efteling. A Dutch Entertainment Park. It is the most beautifull entrance you will ever see for a park!❤  And if you do that, might as well look at the dark ride "Droomvlucht" and "Symbolica" from the same park. The magic is exactly what you love.
That's cool Scar uses dirt for scaffolding I don't feel alone anymore
Good Times Toys
Toy store-ry  😁 great pun from pixar
The entrance to Scarland and Grian's arch don't line up
The toy store should be called “Andy’s Room.”
I think you should name the store Jellie's Terrific Toys
Super cool build for the entrance!  Name idea for the toy shop: Sherriff Jimmy's Toy Land
Loved that you quoted my favorite WDW attraction, the Carousel of Progress :)
My suggestion for the name of the toy store is Timmy's Toys or Timmy's Toy store
I hope you don't forget to make some rides too Scar!
2:38 the shape of the building reminds me of a jukebox, so for toys, i'll tell The Joybox ?
In Denmark we have an amusement park called "Tivoli", your entrance is very reminiscent of that. Very cool to see
Scar, I got goosebumps watching that super fast build mode...what a beautifully done entrance! It's clear how much planning and care you put into your creations, and I appreciate every build and episode because of it. Oh, and my suggestion for the toy store is Andy's Toy Box.
hey scar i got some toy store names for you. hope u like them  Plan B Toys Toys And Laughs Amusing Trinkets Toys From The Stork Knock Knock toys The Enchanted Toy Store Rattle And Roll Tick a Toy Twenty One Toys The Red Balloon The Toyagator Creekside Toys Toy Box Trinkets Toys”R”Us The Creative Carpenter Toys and Hobbies
The toy store should be called Pandora's
The way Scar prnounces dictator makes me nervous😂
I think a great name for the toy store would be Toy Storey
NAME IDEA!: The Misting Toy Shop, Jelly’s Works and Wonder, and The heroes Gifts
The toy store should be named Tim's Toyland
Toy Store: Oh Snap! Half off Toys
Was the pause in the middle of "Dictator" deliberate or not? I guess we'll never know
I need to see scar timelapses with a high exposure so scar has a trail behind him. Would look siiiiiiiick
Amazing stuff scar!
I love how scar is exited about opening the park despite there being no rides
Shop name idea: Jellies Mystical Toys
I'm pretty much sure there is not a single Hermit or fan who does not want to walk into this park and shed tears of joy. Scar, you're an inspiration to all of us. Go absolutely bananas. Live the dream. No.... BRING the dream.
the purple place should be called purple lagoon
Hi Scar! You could name the building "Scar's Toy Chest"
what if you called the toy story terrific trinkets
When I looked at the toy store, the name 'Pinkie's Funzies' came to my mind, as the Pinky from 'Pinky & the Brain' cartoon
Scar, Doc did this not only to drive you crazy but also as showcase what he can do with redstone. You needed to see a sign over on his place, where you landed on the pole. You are going to make him go crazy, if you don't offer him a job😅 I'm sorry, but who else on the server can do so many advanced things than Doc?
For the shop, ask Grian for help and call it Grian’s Goodies
Day 2 of requesting a Scarland marching band 🎺  The theme park is looking so good :DD I look up to you so much Scar
The entrance looks so beautiful!!!  My suggestion for the store: Toy Storey
You should add a fountain at the entrance
Toy store should be called, Toys Sc"R" Us. Also I love how Scarland is turning out!
Dic(k)-tator 😂 I died 😂😂 Scar, what a magnificent episode! New build- massive and great, the whole episode was fun🎉 Exited to see what Impulse will create❤
You can't open the park without a world class roller coaster.  Been waiting a yr for you to build it.  Pls don't disappoint.  hehe j/k
Since most of the merch revolves around Jellie, name suggestion for the toy store - Jellie The Toy Hutt
2:40 You should name the shop "Timmy's Toy Town." It would be hilarious to continue the joke that Timmy's a toy.
I think your shop should be called toys r scar, like toys r us
9:07?
My idea for the toy store is JellieBellies! It's inspired by a real soft toy brand!
I wonder.. if you put wool up around the loud speakers in the perimiter if it would muffle the sound 😂 worth trting out scar 😅
The correct pronunciation is Bob Igor (bob AI-gr)
Scar, we are hoping that you realize that Doc had two goals with his announcement system:  1. To troll the buttercups, But more importantly, 2. To showcase how he can make a unified announcement system for Scarland.   Hire him to make the announcements for scarland because: it will stop the dystopian announcements from the perimeter, he can make general announcements at exact times of day (both standard and randomized), and he can make area specific sounds for the different regions of scarland.  You mentioned hiring redstoners for different projects, and each redstoner that applied has different talents.  They all want to help so let them help in their unique ways.   PS: You don’t have to pay doc as he doesn’t care about diamonds; he cares about interesting redstone.
i think the toy store should be named "Jellie's Jubilee"
9:06 im never eating while watching your videos ever again LOL almost chocked on my dinner
The dic...tator
Can you call one of the buildings   The scarry jelly make ofer   Its a place where little kids can dress like hermitcraft villans (like evel X and .... idk) Based on the binedie bobedie dokay (idk how to spell it)
" *TOYS&CAR* "
Impulse looks like even more of a fireman with the hard hat
2:31 name it "toy mica jam is nifty" - Translation "Jimmy is in fact a toy"😂
Tim’s Toy Treasures
Toy store name: Elven Carved Wooden Toys
*@GoodTimesWithScar* 2:32 The obvious naming would be some variation of: Toy Storey / *Toy Store-y* / Toy Store'y / _Toy Store(y)_ ...
2:10 I think if you put a note block under the allay for the emerald shower, and put a pressure plate near the window, other players will be able to get it when they stand on the pressure plate.
My gosh I love Scar Land. Also, for that shop, you should name it either Jellies Toy Store OR Jimmy's Toy Store (for the crossover 🤣)
Fun fact. You inspired doc for the speakers. Actually he wanna show it off for your park speakers
The Crafty Story can be the name of the building half Minecraft half Toy Story.
Dear Youtube closed Captions, what is "Herbertson Crafting"? 😆 And Cub literally stealing bits out of people's bases. *Insert British Museum joke here*. This park just keeps on getting more and more beautiful and I can't wait to explore it when the world download hits.
Hear me out.  Project Advertisement: you go into the giant speakers on the flagpole, and redo the announcements to be Scarland advertisements.  the best passive aggressive attack on doc ever
Timmy's toy store
The Gen X that I am needs that toy store to be Scar-Bee Toys
Call it Bits n Bobs toystorw
I think a great idea for the toy store is... Build-A-Tim! Named after the best toy in the world. Timmy!
You should name the toy store Ken’s emporium
I went back to admire at the entrance after watching and just noticed the use of pots; very nice.
That entrance is so over the top and beautiful, it could only be the entrance of a theme park. I don't know where Scar finds all his inspiration, but it's so good
I know its not just me who is SOOO excited to see the completed park!
Scar the entrance is EPIC!! Also I thought of a name for the toy store: Toy Store-y
Was so thrilled to see you'd uploaded! I'd been looking forward to it. :)  To answer the question from the video description, Doc's "loudspeakers" are on his flagpole. Scar actually landed on them at 8:51. It's a "demo" for his "Scarland application" (sorry about all the quotes... they just seem warranted in this case :D ), demonstrating how to broadcast a message reliably every morning and night, without the bugs associated with daylight sensors. He actually planned to do a bit more (his video is hilarious), but decided to limit it somewhat.
Call the shop *Jimmy's Toyland!*
I would love to see someone calculate how much a minecraft diamond is worth and how big that salary really is? 😂😅
Everyone is saying the toy store should be "Jimmy's toy barn" or something alike. I think it should be "Jimpettos" as a reference to Gepetto from Pinnochio and Jimmy. A little combination to reference both the inspiration of ScarLand and The Empires crossover!
You could call the building Andy’s room or Timmy’s toy store
An interesting video indeed. In regards to your nameless toy store, I may hold a solution. The store should be called "Wonder". Too many reasons to mention here, but the bottom line is that it is short and sweet.
Shop name: Timmy’s Toy Store.
2:30 you should name it two story toy store_y
Is anyone gonna tell scar that "slushies" are spelled with and "ie"? 1:38
Honestly cannot wait to tour this world download, kinda scared its gonna blow up my PC tbh tho... 😂
Doc is great, Scars reactions were awesome!
I think what would look really cool is if you replaced a part of the roof like say the middle with glass! It’ll also provide light
Mr. Magorium Wonder Emporium
I think the toy store should be called “good times with toys!”
I was thinking on what he should name the toy store and I was thinking scar is basing scarland off of Disney land so I was thinking what are the people who made Disney land and I thought he should mane the toy store  the Imagineer workshop.
The toy shop should be called the best butter cup or  the scar land toys for u Love scar land really like it really details scar 😊😊😊 U make my day 😊
For the love of server safety PLEASE PUT UP STREET LAMPS SO THE MOBS STOP SPAWNING rofl scarland. More like dangerland
YESS! impulse got the job!!!!
Pal's Plush Palace. Like al's toy barn 😂😊
Purpleland.
you should name that building the Crimson Toystore and great video Scar!!!!
I don't know if Scar ever realized that Doc's PA system was his application to be the redstoner for Scarland. 😆
Grian did a tiny announcement
shop name: goodtoyswithscar
Toy store name idea… Jellies Plushies   Also AMAZING episode scar
Toys Scar Us for the toy store maybe??
Name the toy store jimmy xD
The shop shop should be call “scars magical crystals” named after last life.  Also It’s crazy that scar land is going to open!
It would be very neat if the hermits did a charity even in scar land similar to those huge server events with hundreds sometimes thousands of people. Some could have jobs in the park like catching line cutters. If you cut lines you get sent to cleaning duty and pearl makes them do tasks.
Scarland is so beautiful it makes me want to cry
I already know everyone in this comment section is excited for the Hermitcraft 9 Seed to come out. MAN IT WILL BE AWESOME WITH SCARLAND!!!!
Jellie's Jungle could be a cute name for the toy store
Toy's scaR' Us.
Toyshop name - Wish apon a scar - reference to disneys once apon a toy, also because its your dream toys you buy
Does anyone else think that Impulse looks like a firefighter when he puts his hat on?
A good name for the toy shop would be "Jellies Toy Box"!!
I’m gonna need you to name that allay tinkerbell or jiminy cricket.   Also, and I don’t know redstone like you geniuses, but could the method tango used utilizing armor stands to light up his door, be used to animate the turnstile opening/closing mechanic? It seems like a technique is just the kind of scarland magic.
I’m so happy scar land is going to open!!
Anyone else notice the one random unstriped birch block😅
This episode was amazing and the build was really incredible!  Scarland is by far my favourite base on Hermitcraft.    (I hope Grian moves/removes the stone structure at the beginning of Scarland.)
""Toys-Scar-Us"
Doc missed such a big opportunity, his voice band ends on just remember, this is my world. You are just living it, whilst it could've been: remember this is my world, you are just a member
9:05 😂
Scar had the most genuine reaction to Doc new propaganda speakers. It truly is terrifying
Im glad the treasure showers weren't spitting out gold
2:31 Jimmy's house
Revenge plan? Sell merch at scarland featuring the first original villain of scarland, hot guy nemesis, the evil step goat.  He even already has the faerie wings. You could even build a coaster that travels to the perimeter only to be chased away by strange mechanical wonders, before hot guy saves the day (target block don't miss or you loop).
I am sorry, but 11:59 is the most amercican thing scar could have said. train station looks so different. eg. in Crocow (PL) there is the old station building , which is propably more in scars meaning and then there is the new building, where the station actually is. love you scar
I also thought it sounded like Bioshock and in fact Doc mentioned Bioshock in his episode when talking about the loud speaker prank.
The way my heart dropped at you basically swearing, because my sister caught it and forced me into switching the vid off tho lol  Epic video btw - so happy that Scarland's going amazng and I can't wait for the rest of the hermits to react :>
Choked on lunch at “dic-tator”  hahah. Ty.
hot toys
Toy Storey would be a good name I think
You should call it Scared toy shop
You should add a simple dark background to the text on the building so it's easier to read coming into the building but impossible to see from behind.
Opening the park? YOU JUST HAVE FAÇADES, where is the content of those façades?  Sorry but that Grian's Ark is in front of you entrance. Destroi it!  So, you are not a fair guy.  You didnt make the same entrevista to the other candidatos. Not fair.   I realy phot more of you. Sorry.
Scars best toy store
Dic... tator
I don't think that it is healthy for park to be next to the horrifying perimeter🤣When I first heard doc's voice I thought war was about to begin😬
You could name the toy store to a simply: Jimmy's place
that audio stuff that doc did is CREEPY
The more Scar builds, the more torn I am. Torn between wanting to have the season end so I can go explore the map, and most definitly wanting to see the season go on to see what more awesome builds will pop up on the server.
Joy Box or Jimmy's Joy Box as a play on 'toy box' but with more happiness could work...!
Amazing as always Scar, you're truly a building inspiration.  One extremely little nitpick though; at 1:50 how about switching the signs for Emeralds and Diamonds?  The Allay that drops Diamonds is under the Emeralds sign and vice versa.
Hey scar I think you definitely need a rollercoaster called the dicktator. I think it’s a good name
Can this robot perform….other services?
Name the toy store, “Scar Story Toy Store” instead of Toy Story
For the toy store, I was thinking J·S Toy & Hobby (Jimmy and Scar) The idea being a variation of K·B Toys, which was called Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby before.  It was the second largest retail toy company in the US before declaring bankruptcy and being bought out by Toys R Us.
Doc should be a villain in a Call of Duty or Fallout game tbh
Scar should add minigames for the hermits
For the toy store: Jellie’s Toy Box.
Toystore name; Good times with Toys
First order of redstone business turnstiles. Second order of redstone kill doc’s announcements
scarland now feels finished! the entrance looks soo good!!
It’s all coming together, between the Scarland employees and the buttercups… Boatem could be reunited. Now we just need the museum conflict to spill over into the perimeter conflict and it’s go time for Hermit War 2.
9:03 doc has really become a dic...tator. Almost gone wrong
A super fast build mode is exactly what I needed today.  Thanks.
Can't wait to get to work!
I did not expect the dic tator
I smiled a lot :D
Doc has really become a dic----tator of this perimiter ----GoodTimesWithScar 2023
Scar Plushie
2:30 Toys For Boys
I just realized that ScarLand has no roller-coasters
9:06 im sorry doc has become what now?
the toy store should be called Sheriff Jimmy's Not-a-toy Store
The amount of excitment i got in the end when you Said that scarland will Open and you then will start to build atractions is Not able to be Put into words!!!!! WOOOOO
Redstone specialist? Oh no. It's gonna be B-Dubs and his perfect redstone, isn't it. T_T :p
Name the toy store Purple n Pink’s. I think it really fits the Colour scheme of the Building.
Toy Store name... thoughts go to Solidarity/Jimmy. maybe along the lines of Solid(arity) Toys and Plushies.
So excited to get your card.  I could only afford one card  (alas no job and no job prospects atm so money is very tight but had saved just enough to get one auto) and knew that it would have to be Scar.  His videos have brought so much joy and wonder to my life.  While it hurt to not get more of the hermits cards I'm so very happy to know I will have a card featuring Scar and Jelly.  Truly this Christmas will be super magical for me.  Thanks Scar for being such an inspiration and such a sweet soul.  Much love and keep up the amazing content.
Jimmy's Toys!
Toy store should be called Toy'Scar'us or a variation of that haha!
Mumbo-jumbo inventions
13:05 I couldn't stop watching the horse in the corner dancing to the music 😂
I hope Doc goes all Cave Johnson with the recorded messages.
Here is a name idea for the little toy shop Jellie's joyfull toy den
19:46 " You stupid dic tator! " Lmaoo
You getting freaked out by the allay scared me. 😂 I nearly threw my phone.
Call the toy store The Toy Chest! A chest can be the logo.
OK this is by far the best hermit craft episode!! At 17:00 I laughed, so hard😂 Scar is the best. I think for the next episode, maybe you could try to work on one of the themed worlds and for the toy shop, I was thinking, maybe Jellies toy store hope this helps. Have a wonderful day Scar
Jimmy's Royal Coral Toys for the shop name?
First name that come to mind for a toy shop is “Geppetto’s”
I saw it in the comments and I’m gonna say it again, the pink building should be called Jimmy’s Dreamland.
THE ENTRANCE LOOK AMAZING!!! ONE OF MY FAVORITE BUILD IN SCARLAND FROM NOW ON
What better toy to put in the toy shop than a good callback to Jimmy?
Let see how long the buttercups can bear listening to Doc before they become mad since sleeping through the night will reset the announcements, after all the entire server is Doc's world, they are just living in it
Scar, if you want other people to use the mineral shower, use note blocks that activate every so often near the allays and then they'll drop the things at the note blocks, just put wool between the note blocks so that the allays don't hear each other's note blocks
possibly name the store - hokey pokies
9:06 excuse me???? oh
A toy store has to be "Jimmy's World"
Name the building "Deputy Tiny Jimmy's Toy Town"
Scar, you make me smile and feel happy
Scar, PLEASE name the toy store Timmy's R' Us it would be so funny
Super happy for Impulse to join the park crew! I can already tell he is super excited about it :D Also at 9:06 not gonna lie, I laughed so hard I scared my cat XD Finally, how about the Crimson Toybox for the store name?
for the shady toy store: SCARLAND’s MYSTERY SHOP
SOO HAPPY to see a new episode! Binged S9 the last few days and absolutely fell in love with Scarland. Seeing Impulse join the staff is a joy, very excited for the Grand Opening. :)
Congratulations to Impulse, the official fireman of Scarland!
The dystopian soundtrack is Doc's application to give you reliable speaker and light setups.  You can make him do speakers for each ride and give him the records of "Welcome to Scarland!"  "Now time for fireworks"  , etc.  and instead of giving him diamonds- you can give him a hardhat and a VIP ticket.  The sound distance is programmable now, so you can make the announcement for one ride, a couple of buildings, or the whole park.
Hello scar i just wanted to say that i love your video's you always cheer me up.  Love and support from the Netherlands
For a JOKE ima say the  secret operation  is: Fly to Germany and personly blow up doc
That entrance looks STUNNING. Wow.  As for the Game Shop... Jellie's Toy Em-paw-rium? Paws and Play? Whiskers and Whimsy!
The toy shop should be called "Good Times With Toys".
I’ve never been this early before, LETS GOO!!
Good times toy shop.
Tiny Tim’s Toy Emporium!
I love how the allay keeps fallowing Scar around when his near by
2:30  Name the toyshop something to do with Jimmy. Please
SCAR! I came up with some good names for the toy store:             Poppy’s purple play place             SCARS Stupendous shop             Hot Guys Great Games             Mumbos’s Marvelous Miniatures             Dead Goats inc.
I think it would be really cool if Scarland had a monorail system like Disney and have a parking lot to add some more character!
I have a name idea for your new toy store building... jimmy's friends or something referencing that jimmy is a toy. You should also put a sherif jimmy head or him as Ken in the shop that would be so Hilarious LOL!!!
Good Times With Scar, Better Toys
Dock is become “dic”tator 😂
How does one get hired to work at scar land?
Scar you should hire geminitay as security than the whole soup group works at scarland
I'm grateful that Scar didn't have the Allay's give out gold for a shower....
Name the toy store "Jimmy's Toy Barn" as a reference to both Solidarity and Al's Toy Barn from Toy Story.
Toys 'Scar' Us
Prank idea: Build a potato stuffed in the speaker and change the music disc so it sounds really dimmed (Or you just take away the music disc if you want)
Good Times With Jellie's Toys, and I also thought of catnip café if there is another restaurant
For the allays, you can use a noteblock so it will hear that and try to drop the items there, but players can intercept
Love the entrance!! It looks so so great Scar! Just imagine walking around Scarland in VR!! One small lil critique I have personally is maybe you can try putting stained glass blocks or else behind the letters so it’s more readable? The color kinda blends in with the chandeliers now but the dome and arches look magnificent and I don’t think you will wanna block it off entirely…or change the letter color?idk whatever you see fit! #store names Crimondeness toy store (crimson-madness? 😅im bad at creating names) Scar your videos and love about these parks encourage me a lot and thank you very much for that! Im having mental issues this year and it sucks, but I do find a new objective for my life so that’s good news right? I wanna save up money and revisit USA just for a Disney trip again, but hopefully with my parents. Really wish it could happen and I can get the happiness again :D and a large part of this idea is from you so very much appreciated! Wish you have a nice weekend man!
For the toy shop, I would call it ‘Mr Scars tinkerers toy workshop’ ❤
SCAR, IM PRETTY 99% SURE THAT AGING COPPER IS FASTER IN WATER
Are you planning to add rides? One way or another scar land is still amazing
toy shop name: col Angry eyes top secret toy shop
You could call the toy store the "Toy Store-y", as a reference to pixars' movies.
For some reason it took me a full five seconds to realize that Scar inadvertently called Doc a Dic
You could probably pay Doc to change his daily announcements to your "The park is now closing"/"the park is open" announcements
Just got back from taking my family to Disneyland for the first time! This makes me wanna cry, so good! I have a greater appreciation for the work you’ve put in here Scar! After watching your videos I noticed everything you’ve mentioned while there! From the go away green color, to the music and feel of the park! Thanks for making my experience that much better!
For the toy store, " scar's land of fun and dreams", or just "scars land of dreams" for short.
Sir scarland I was kinda hoping you’d force redstone bdubs to make an appearance 😅
That 9:07 Dic....tator had me rolling in laughter! I am applauding that moment Scar.  👏
Name it STRROY
"Jellie's Toy Chest" name for the toy shop 😁
Jimmys toy barn!
“Joking Jellie - Scarland’s Famed Town of Toys!” has a nice ring to it, and we can’t forget about Jellie
<3
The toy store should be called Scar’s Trinkets ™
WHY DID YOU PAUSE BETWEEN SAYING "DICTATOR" LWKJDJSJVS AKJZJ
What a shame you didn't pick Doc as your redstone handyman. He and the hivemind together are so talented.
Wow scar that entrance looks soooo good, thank you for another fun episode❤
The toy store should be called Jimmy’s not a toy store!
You should name the toy store Timmy's Toydarian Toymaker to reference the Toydarian Toymaker in Disneyland and the empires crossover
I think you should vall it little toy timmys store or something like that
Minecraft: Adds scaffolding to the game. Builders: Proceeds to use dirt.
I love that Impulse's armor trim looks like he's wearing a hi-visibility maintenance suit
scar you, grian, and mumbo should temper with doc's  speaker system on his flag pole and change doc's announcements to scarland advertisements
Maybe the store could be called, Toy Store-y, Idk its like Toy Story but adapted for a Disney pun
19:38 carousel of progress reference!
Would Jellie's Toybox be too simple of a name? Maybe Jellie's Funhouse instead.
Scarland mono rail?
"Doc has really become a DIC... tator of this server"
Rides?
the Scarland buildings are magnificent! that entrance is going to be so exciting to walk through when it is finished.  but, grian's horseshoe needs to move far, far away
Timmy's Toys for sure, love it Scar keep it up
What about Scarred/Scard (Scar + card) Games? Maybe the shop could include a couple cards from Beef's game too.
Idea for toy store name: GoodToysWithScar
Boatem is slowly but surely being encorporated into scarland and i am so here for it
Shop name:   Tongue twister toys (all toys can have tongue twister names)  World of scar toy store (node to world of Disney)  The Purple pantheon toys store ( Because the building is purple)
9:07 doc has really become a dic……………Tator
Doc sounds like he's trying to make a dystopia novel in the perimeter. As much as I want to cheer for the buttercups Doc seems scarier.
I think that the shop should be named: BIG RED TOY SHOP
Another fun video from Scar ‼️he entrance look gorgeous :DDD
You should name the toy store after Mr. Magorium’s Magic Emporium. I don’t know what specifically but maybe the replies on this comment will come up with something.
Toy Store names: Scar-Mart, Scars R Us, Scarget
Yay! Welcome, Impulse! The entrance to the park is amazing! It's so inviting 😍
I can’t name things but “scarred toys”? Lol
You could pretend that the toy store is actually the fifth toy store and call it "Timmy's Toy Store: E."
i love you scar
You should name the toy shop  Jimmy's Dream House😂
Jimmy's Toy Emporium
Please make Jellie plushies to sell at the scarland merch store!  Also here are some ideas for the toy store name: Toys of Joy Scarland Action Figures  Also thanks for all the amazing videos they always make my day!
scar you should make a park directory with maps and label where everything is in the park with blocks above the builds.
The toy store should be called Toys sca"R" us
You should name the store Triumphant Toys
I think it the toy store should be named: JIMS TOY BARN… for reasons.
YEEEAAH!!! I am so happy that ********* got the job!
The Emmerald and diamond shower Can be done with a dispenser facing up and redstone
TOY SHOP name from Marianne aged 9yrs  W   elcome H    ermits E    very E    ntertainment L    ovingly  S    elected  "WHEELS DEALS"  ❤xx
The toy store could be called Scars"R"Us
DOC HAS BECOME A DIC- tator  that was a deliberate pause I know it
This is my first comment I've ever commented
"Curio Corner" or "Curiosity Corner" would be a neat name for the toy store.
Toy Store name: Timmy's Toy Shop (lol)
Cub has pulled a full British Museum
I imagine that all setups are traps, but not all traps are setups
Perhaps ask (and pay extra) for your redstone handy man to fashion a dropper that senses players.  I imagine a pufferfish trigger with a dropper under the allay (or at least the window) would work for the player to walk up and the fairies "drop" the goodies. Also, have the allays hold something else if it is diamonds and emeralds they should drop. Or vice versa..  Scarland looks magical, Scar <3
the fact he calls doc his leader already. Oh my...
You should name the toy store "Tiny Tim's Playhouse," as an ode to a small friend.
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! This is AMAZING! I Love the new gate! The detail and attention to umm.... Equality? I dont know... what's the word for same on both sides... ether way it is soo good! I happy impulse got the job, (also when Scar said "A great big beautiful  tomorrow" That is a micky mouse reference and I love it.)
I think the toy store should be called Toys By Scara like threads in season 7
Timmy's Toy Store
The entrance reminds me of the city hall from season 7
9:06 SCAR NOOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was thinking for the toy shop, ‘Jimmys Roundup’ or ‘Jimmy’s Cattle Corner’ would be nice!
Name the building barbenhiemer bc the color scene and the fact that it’s a toy store
Maybe call the toy store "Ths Jukebox"? That's what it looks like to me.
The toy store should be named something along the lines of Jimmy, and should sell Timmy Toys
Cool build Scar!
maybe a fun name for the toy shop is "the magenta marionette"
Will  there be castle interior
The Crimson Emporium
10 toys toy shop
make the trolley a glass fake and make it look like a hologram
Toy store name; Magenta Margert's Marry Toys.
How about naming the toy store Jimmy's Chest.
For the toy store, it should be. 'The Toy Menagerie'
I wonder if ren's precious cranium is in the museum
Great episode as always!! For the toy shop I’d offer “Build a Jellie” as a parody name to Buildabear workshop
scar's dragon sounding giving some north korea communist propaganda vibes
There is no way it should be possible to hear Doc's intercoms from Scarland, I bet he put jukeboxes all under the area just so Scar hears it lol
People put in your theories for how this is going to end
Name for the shop!  "Wondrium Imporium"
Scar, your videos always leave me feeling a bit better, a bit more hopeful, a bit safer. You make the world a better place for me, and I thank you so so much for that <3
I think an interesting name could be the scaring treasurey
Grian's base being square in front of the entryway is a bit of a clash, not gonna lie.
Tinkers toys
The toy store could be named “Twilight Toyshop” or “Twilight Toy store”
Name for the toy store: elfin toy store and i came up with a slogan: try our toys because they will scar your imagination for life
The you store should definitely be called Jimmy's Toy Barn.  As a play on the store from Toy Story, and as a reference to your favorite Sheriff!
Scar: I can't take this back from the museum. I need to hire a thief. *National Treasure music starts playing*
Scar is the Cave Johnson of Hermitcraft
Seeing the storage system in the back made me think something like "Chest Monster Toy Co" would be a fun name :)
Cub's museum is the hermitcraft version of the British Museum
21:45 "No, no, the park doesn't accept children!" 😂😂
Scar: *Is a family friendly YouTuber* Also Scar: “Doc is such a DIC-tator!
Call the toy store "Toy's Scar Us"!
My suggestion: Toys Scar Us
I wonder why u didn't pick doc he can make ur scarland sound system easily
You should name the shop “Jelly’s Toyland”
Love your buildings, Scar!  Scarland is so beautiful with all those glorious buildings! You made the best choice in hiring ImpulseSV as your RedStone employee.
I like everyone naming the toy store based on the Empires crossover, but my take is that it should be the "Big Little Deputy Toys"
You should name the shop slightly scarred candy
:0 yayy
An idea for the toy shop name immediately popped into my head: “Jellie’s Toy Extravaganza” or a second option to replace Jellie with Scarland in the name
9:07 I eat and watch during this videos...i was so close to choking on my snacks for tht hahaha
around my house all morning it's been "Scar upload day! Scar upload day!"  ...then my daughter told me I was being annoying
Toyas toy shop
Hi
I'm sorry Doc really became who? 😊
Scar is right. Doc is such a Dic tator.. 😂😂😂
Just name the store  TSTS Toy Story Toy Store
2:25 Idk if your a fan of Home Alone 2, but what about Duncans Toy Chest?
I hope you make Splash mountain
What I would call the Toystore in ScarLand? „The Secret Mirage“! It's kinda 'stuffed' in the side of the street which gives me the feeling of it being somewhat overseen sometimes. But the contents in it make it special!
Scarveniers!
Jimmy's Toy Barn!   It has to be that for the toy store....
I'd say for the toy shop maybe call it "scarland fantastical toy shop
If you let the hermits take and give back the diamond/emerald the allay is holding, it could maybe make it so it showers for other hermits as well.
The name for the toy shop should be : Toys ScaR Us
Idk why but I think it'd be really funny to steal grian's concept and call the shop "Scar's magical menagerie" as it does work for this specific shop idea as well where you're selling a "strange or diverse collection of things" (Google's second definition of menagerie) that instills good feelings of wonder and magic
Maybe the transcendent toy shop? Transcendent trinkets? I think transcendent sounds cool! Amazing builds as always!
Toy store name idea: Toy Stor(e)y!
i like the name "Good Toys with Scar"
14:55 allay jumpscare
It would be great if Grians "gate" and the entrance of ScarLand would connect. Like that you can walk straight. Not like need to curve around
Toys and trinkets
Scar just called Docm a D*ck-tator
Oh! If you hire a Scarland thief, their title should be something like "Park Security" ooooooooooooorr "Park Goon" Then you can pay them 16 diamonds a week, and get more based on performance based incentives :D
Not the pause when Scar was saying dic…tator 💀
You should name the toy store woodyland  (From toy story)
You should name the toystore "Toys Scar Us" 😂❤
maybe name the store: Tiny Tim's Toy Store (just to further clarify that Jimmy, is in fact, a toy)
How about naming the toy shop “Jellie’s Toy Chest” because you’re on pirates smp
You should name the shop goodtoyswithscar
If it's an amusement park shouldn't have a faris wheel or a rolicoaster I did enjoy the episode it was very creative
Scar if you want every player to get diamonds and emeralds you have to add a note block in front of the allay to tell it where to throw the items , put a note block with a pressure plate on top so that the player can touch it to get the allay to drop the items whenever they need to
You should name the building "toy store" hahaha
What does Decked Out look like now without its top?
I think “Scarland’s fantastic world of wonders” would be a cute name for the toy shop!
I thought this was a PG channel, scar has some explaining to do 😂 9:06
Scar's Knick-Knacks
“YOU STUPID DIC…TATOR”
I feel like you should name the toy store as, Timmy's Toys
Commenting AGAIN asking for a Ferris Wheel. It would do so much for the skyline and really make the park feel like a park!
for a store name how about Jolly Jellie's Toy House
2:30 Tim's Toys 😆
9:05 naahhh the way scar said dictator 😂 I literally can’t. He knew 100% what he was doing 😂
That enterance is gorgeous! You're such an inspiration to aspiring builders everywhere.  For the toy store name, what about The Trinkets and Toys Treasury?  Very excited to see how the Buttercups plan on taking vengeance on Doc!
For the toy store, maybe Jellies Toy Bin or Wagon O' Toys?
Yay! Scar uploaded today!!! 🎉😆
A dic  -tator  😂 nice scar, nice
It's so inspiring seeing everything come together! Can't wait to have a proper, full walk through the Scarland
That entrance is epic Scar! ❤️
Could you name it scar’s super shiny shenanigans
name the building "the jukebox" because it kinda looks like a jukebox
So glad to see you got a new frien- I mean employee at Scarland! Glad to see impulse is the engineer
A possible name for the store: Scar's giggily gadgets
Gotta love when Scar gets startled by the most random things
If Scar ever does a fallout themed build for Hermitcraft 10, his faction would be The Brotherhood of Jellie
Great video as always! Also, you should try playing planet coaster (theme park building game)
JELLIE R US is the best name for a toy store
Scar’s Terrific Toy Emporium
Either Toys 'R' Scar or Lil Jimmy's Toy Barn as names for the store
Good times toy land! That's my vote lol
The toy shops name should be goodtoyswithscar
That entrance is STUNNING Scar!! I can’t believe you hammered it out so quickly (aging copper notwithstanding!)
2:50 the purple T-rain?
Name for the toy shop scars r us
scar you better have noticed the birch you forgot to strip
Name the toyshop "The PlayPen"! Alternatively, The Purple PlayPen
The Mystery Shack? not very original, but i heard “mystery” and immediately thought of gravity falls
Doc’s announcements put Scar on edge so much an allay nearly scared him to death! Doc clearly not only has the power of explosives, but psychological warfare as well.
Namd the toystore: FunToy OhBoy
The toy store should be called Scars toy chest Taking the name from one of my favorite movies home alone 2, of Duncan's toy chest
I'm one of the first
those doc messages 🤣
The sheer scale of scarland is actually insane. I’m always so excited for every update to the base
You could name the store “Timmy’s Toy Barn” in reference to the crossover?
You know its a good day when Scar posts! I'm so excited to see where Scarland goes, its looking so good! Thank you Scar, for doing what your doing, your videos have cheered me up through some of the hardest times.
Maybe you could name the toyshop "Violet Wonderland"
Had a bad night and early morning thanks for uploading today!
The scar playtime store!
9:03   Well, thats going on the outta context -
MR Smith's wondaful and wacky toy shop. for the toy shop name. I put MR Smith for my teacher who wanted his own toy shop he was a grate teacher I do not want a credit with my name as the is for MR Smith
Please name the toy store, "Toy town" to commemorate your time in the empires server.
9:06 a d- what scar?...
Jellies mystical magical house of wonderful beautiful incredible Toys
I think it should be TFCs toy store in memory of TinFoilChef
Toy store remind me of Jimmy
Timmy's Toy World
ToyTastic Toy Tower
Timmy’s Toy Town for the toy store
I have a name for  the toystore: toytopoia
2:54  I've got a name for you, the Toy Storey 😉
A toy store without a sherrif jim isn't a real toy store
Claim Your Before an Hour Tickets Here🏆
was just gonna sleep but i guess im staying up for 23 more minutes now!
Thanks!
I love scarland !❤
My suggestion for the toy store is Jelly's Whimsical Toy Store or The Whimsical Toy Store :D
Fun World toy store
For the shop timmie's toys
Scar with the pausing when pronouncing dictator had me dying
You could call the store “Scarland’s toy trove”
How about “The Toy Tavern”?
Jelle’s Toy Bin or Jelle’s Toy Box?
jellies jolly toy store for the name
I love that scar also instantly thought of bioshock when hearing the doc announcements
2:17 I’m *pretty* sure what you can do is have them throw it to a note block that’s hooked to a sensor or player detector. Maybe there’s a way to hide the note block below the glass but, quite honestly, I don’t know the interaction.
Name the purple building "Lotions and Potions" and would be kinda funny lol
„Doc has really become a dic- dictator of the server“ 😂
Prank ideas (Against Doc): Seal off the perimeter and put a large sign that says, "Unsafe working conditions" Blow up the remains of the tunnelbore to release the wardens freeroaming in the perimeter Turn all the water there into obsidian or cobblestone using lava Dinnerbone doc's ender dragon Name a zombie, "Showing mercy towards the goats" and let it kill one of the buttercups. A message will appear in the chat Make a giant cube with 4 Moustachio Grian faces floating above the perimeter, hagning from giant Scarland baloons
Doc’s an actual super villain. It’s amazing
for the toy store, maybe Wonder Emporium after the movie Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium ?
The toy store could be called "Scar's Magical Toys" Or "Scarland's Magical Toys"
I think the shop should be named: Jellies whisker’s.
Doc became what now?
Btw- Doc's dystopian sound system is actually a demo for his scarland application
You could name the store “Tim’s Toy Barn” in reference to the crossover?
Toy store name: Jimmy's Toy Empire.
"Doc has really become a dic...tator of this perimeter"
Doc's speakers give me goosebumps! TERRIFYING. Sounds like it came out from a horror game
TOY SHOP NAME IDEAS!:  1. The Jelly Jam Toy Shop. (Jelly like your cat and the toy shop is red so it’s like jam 🤗) 2. PeanutButter & Jelly’s toy Shop! (Peanut is my cat, but to make it better I put Butter at the end) 3. Good times with Toys!  4: —————-Will be edited later———-
9:06  Scar…?
"Toys 4u "  Each toy costs 4 diamonds
I like the dancing horse during superfastbuildmode
9:03 very smooth scare.... very smooth
Doc is a dic...tator
The toy shop colors remind me of the Cheshire Cat! you should call it the Cheshire Cat's Grin. You could add a crescent smile to some part of the build, and make it a favorite hangout of Jellie and other scarland cats.
For the toy store you know jack in the boxes well how about you name it jellie in the box?
You could call the toy store Good Toys from Scarland
For the toy shop [ The Jellie's Nest Magic Shop ]
Here’s a good name for the toy place, “Scars mystery toy chest”
This is just main street people, a castle and a storage room
"Toys scar us" for the shop
NOOOO IT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH GRIANS ARCH IM GONNA GO INSANE😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  (great build as always tho)
Wow...  he rly just called doc a DICtator
The name of the store should be Andy’s closet. The make hot guy rip offs off buzz light year and woody
Barbies toy store
Toy Scar Us, obviously ^_^

Scar has really become a dic........tator of this perimeter LOL
For the name of the toy store this what I got toy toy world
anyone else thinking Andy's Toy Store????
"doc has really become a dic.... tator of this perimeter " you cheeky scar
Name this building "jimmy"
9:05 for a second.... ._.
im so glad to see the season go for so long
DocM77: speaks Scar: *ANGER*
„Scar it‘s fiiiine 😂“
The target block doesn't actually get activated by people ramming into them, it's bc Grian clicked a rocket on it which does activate the target block
potential shop name could be “Jellie’s Joyous Toy Emporium”
Scar makes the best builds. This is probably my favorite base in hermitcraft
Toy store? Andy's room
A good name would be Jellie’s Joyful Toys
toy shop should be called "timmy/jimmy's toy store" named after the one and only toy sheriff
I was at school today and spend the entirety of my subjects designing and thinking about Scarland in real life. Now I have three pages full of crazy ideas 😂 I just love you for that Scar, you give us so much inspiration, energy, fantasy and just make our days a little more magical.
Doc has really become what?😂😂😂
Scar that was close 9:07
9:10 "Doc has really become a 'Dic  tator' " I laughed so hard at how funny that was that I ended up spilling my drink. Never change Scar.
Will there be Disney classics refrences, like a little Grian Pan flying out of a window, or a Pearl holding up Simba?
The unnamed store in Scarland should be called Al's Toy Barn
The line about doc being a dic… tator” literally made me choke 😂😂😂😂
9:10 Scar? Scar??? You knew what you were doing there-
DickTator 😂 You did that on perpose scar!
WHY IS THERE A DRAGON MADE OUT OF EGGS?!??!!? THE HERMITS ARE INSANE WHAT
Those announcements from Doc are actually terrifying
“Doc has really become a Dic…tator of this perimeter” -Scar 2023
The thumbnail is insane!!! ❤❤❤  wow this is worth the wait!
Hmmm. 9:01
For the name of the toy store, it will be  toy toy
Toy Storeys, the best toy shop in town
YES, A NEW SCAR EPISODE. also cant wait for my signed TCG card :D
Name the building The Scarland Emporium
Docm84
call it jimmy jollies toy shop! not so subtle reference but very good name
dic-tator
New! Super Toy Store  Should be the name of the toy store and there could be a toy of a little scar guy
9:05 made me spit out my drink.
Scar where are the rides in scar land every theme park needs rides.
love the doc has really become a dic-tator
Happy Scar upload day!!
scar is us for the toy store
9:05 😂😂 Doc is what?
The toy store should be called "Jimmy's Toy Barn", as a reference to what happened on Empires
"Doc has really become a dic... tator"   Good one
@goodtimeswithscar dont age your copper like that, use xishwamibam's copper aging machine and steal some of docms copper from his farm and that will save the grind so you can have more time to build scarland

THE TOY CORRAL
Man, you posted this just in time. Just got home after work sent me home since I'm sick.
Toy store name: The Playful Purple Purrrfect Store.  IDK what I’m doing
Name idea for the Toy Store: Toy Store-E-E's  Homage to both Toy Story and Season 7's Shade-E-E's
I think a good name for the toy shop might be "Jellie Toy Co."
I think you should name the toy shop: The pink pantry
When it comes to the toy store I feel the name “Mini Mystical Toy Store” because it’s kind of out the way and tucked between two larger buildings
Toy store name “Jimmy and Friends”
Name for the toy store: Jimmy's Nook (credit goes to my wife Iris)
In the toy store you need to sell the sherif toys from empires! That would be amazing
Toy for Troy
For the sign in the mangrove room, i vote for the anti chest monster room. Also, the entrance to the park is beautiful, probably my favorite build in scarland
I think "The Violet Dreamland" would be a fitting name for the toystore
Poor X and Pix built that whole copper aging machine and no one uses it lol
You are the only person with the power to turn a boring and depressing tuesday into a magical one for millions of people  Thank you ❤
not sure why, but my first thought for the toy shop name was "jellie's cat tree" lol
Toy store name idea:   • good toys with scar  (a bit generic but simple) • Playful Purple  • The Playful Purple Purrrfect   Store. Idk I have no clue what I’m doing
the shops should be called jellie plays
General WithScar
The title of the Toy Shop, could be Toys For Herms(Like Toys For Us) or FrolicFactory Toys(just thought it would be cool!
The Toy Store needs to be Jimmy's Toy Store!
Toy store name : Scarians Toys

I have a name for the purple building  "lightyear" because its a toy store so i thought of toy story
You never fail to impress- That entrance is phenomenal! I really like the way you did the arches.  I also think you should call the toy store, "Jimmy's Emporium"
“Good Times Toys” for the toy store?
Doc has literally become the villain of some dystopian film
If you ever make a crafts store or experience in Scarland, it could be called ‘Crayon and Clay’ :D
I think 'Toy Storey' is a good name for the shop
“Well hello there” -Scar, 2023
you should call the toy store waluigi's toy store
Name the toy store scars toys and Trinkets  love your videos
Name for the Toy Store : Toy Stor-ee
How about the scartoy store
For the purple toy store, maybe you could call it Magenta Minifigures?
Museums are supposed to follow a rule of ethics and stealing violates these ethics so you could sue or threaten cub with losing his museum status.
Call the new bulding "Mystoyrious Toy Shop"
“The purple play house” or “ purple play store”
The Scarland Emporium :)
Timmy’s toys could be the toy stores name

The name of the build should be story tales or toy storey
WAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You should name it Jimmys toy barn, he would like that😊
The new buttercup HQ Is amazing The toy store should be named Jimmy's Dreamland
I'm so glad to see your video after SOOOOOOO long. When are you going to post Pirates SMP videos?
i've never rushed so fast to my laptop for an upload before (edit as I continue to watch) at 9:05 my jaw dropped because I legitimately thought scar said a bad word... "Doc has really become a Dic----tator of this perimeter" also, I honestly think it's a good idea to do a buttercup version of whatever Doc's evil dictator speech thingy is for the buttercamp!!!
Mom can we go to scarland?
Scar land just keeps getting better wow 😊
Hello scar😊😊😊😊
Heck yeah!! I missed you Scar!!
I dream of being as talented as Scar
Love when Scar swoops in just in time to cure youtube burnout. His videos are always a joy to watch
I haven't been watching Hermitcraft for a long while, and I'm just in awe of the first few seconds. Those builds are gorgeous!
You know its a good day when scar posts
Hey Scar, I am very glad to see you again!
We missed you Scar!
AMAZING episode as always, definitely one of my favorite mega bases from all the seasons of hermitcraft.
I love how scar randomly drops to 7 xp and you can just tell 😂😂
scAHAr
From the title, I can already tell this is going to be a great episode!
hey i'm early! so excited to see this episode lol !! ive been so happy seeing scarland get built :-)  edit: SCAR!!!! oh my GODS!!! the entrance looks amazing! i didn't expect anything less, but WOW. i love it so much! and so happy to see impulse as the redstone engineer (even though i knew it beforehand lol). hopefully you can deal with doc and his dic... tatorship !
I don’t want to be pushy but can we get more new life?
Scar's videos keep me sane
A Scar upload just makes me happy. Positive vibes always make my mood better.
I am still so obbsessed with the Scarland Cafe... Maybe an art project in the future????
The other day I was wondering were the videos were
Yay! Scar!
A few seconds in and I’m SUPER EXITED to watch!!!
I can't wait for the opening! I feel like the lil building could be called maybe the cackling crimson hideout!
