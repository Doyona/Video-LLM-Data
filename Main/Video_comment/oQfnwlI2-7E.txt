When the machine tells you you're good, you're good.   - Bukayo Saka
MY HUSBAND JUDE BELLINGHAM AND MY REAL MADRID 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿♥️♥️♥️💕💕💕
england needs to make legend players like ronaldo zidane cafu 3 or 4 senior legends to win the worldcup and use to play like old school traditional football style like zidane ❤❤❤
Firey Hot foot shufflers
It's the music in the background for me 😂😂
Seems like a fun group
Can I met the team for my birthday
Grealish just showed why he is a lucky lucky lad
Harry Krane. :D
I hope Trent is doing ok :(
All the best to You, England.  You ❤️ are an amazing team under Great 👍 Leadership.  Cape Town.
where can we get the cool bucket hat?!
ahihi
Is Luke Shaw aging backwards or what?
I think the boys can reach the semis this time round...
Rashid Kamara,REMEMBER THE NAME!
Would love to see the reception in a month's time😂
Kane and Rice with the 200 IQ move of looking round the side of the grabbing machine to gauge the depth. They know their stuff.
Jude on the cover but nowhere in the video.
Foden is a baller
The chemistry they have built off the pitch will see them go far in the competition...it like they have been playing together all along. Its more of a club vibe than a national team vibe
I love this team !
That sock machine got alot of the squad didn't it🤣 Great to watch the bonding and seeing the squad just hanging out together as mates and seeing a unity in the squad. It does feel like a propper team and not a bunch of individuals. Credit to all the staff 👏 The players, it's definitely noticeable that England have improved alot and building team spirit is and has gone along way. In the past people put on the England shirt but worked as individuals, held club grudges and ultimately didn't work as a team even though on paper was arguably the best squads. This is the miss piece :)
Trent 😢
What is this machine called, need it for my son badly
hey
最高!
The dream right here
Much love bukayo saka❤❤❤
HI
Can’t find Benny blanco at all why😭
I’m Scottish but hopefully boys do well bring it back to Britain
I hear they told those kids they can have a week off school if they cheered.
ITS COMING HOME!
Is this a scene from Mike Basset England manager 2
Come on lads 🦁 🦁 🦁
Foden is just insane what a talent we've gotten 🤩
c'mon England
One would think they were going to save the world from an impending meteor strike or something the way people come out to sing them off.
First time Tottenham's won something! 😁
Huge England fan here. Welcome to Arabia lads IT'S COMING HOME !!🌍🦁🦁🦁
9:20 .”HE HIGHFIVED ME”
the one who take photo with maguire😂
The last guy taking pictures with Maguire😂😂😂

Glad they're all smiles using facilities built by slaves
Come on England, we’ve got this.
Getting paid to have a laugh n compete in world's biggest sports svent
LIVIN THE DREAM!!!
Foden very reliant on left foot while Jack using both feet, equally comfortable
LOVE THIS
Yes England strong power I'm live Bristol 100persen support England
Foden is unreal
That one kid getting gassed over Southgate 😂
top guy gareth southgate isnt he
Im happy to see Trent having fun! He always looks like a lone wolf with the England team.
Make that I want it is to be myself 😁❤️
Wheres bellingham

Lovely England World Champions under 17, you have the skills long accurate shoots, you are lovely to watch play football, play it like the Lionesses and bring home the Qatar World Cup. 💛💕💞💗🌎💖😀💜💓💙🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍🌍
Only reasonable players you got is Saka, Bellingham, Sterling and Kane the rest passengers. USA beats you easy though🤣🤣🤣🤣

Thanks for  one million Thanks for  one million Thanks for  one million
southgate seems very nervous lol wud make me nervous if i was one of his players
Saka 💓💓💓
See how well they do at the tournament lol
This video made me believe we will win the world cup
Please join madders
Saka needs his own camera man 😂
Nice of Southgate to greet those children and high five them.  The players barely managed a smile and a wave, looked like it was almost below them to do so.  Trent just looks miserable.
Saka is such a vibe!
Harry Kane looks bored
Bring the World Cup home ❤
Harry Maguire being there is a joke.
Southgates speech is one you wouldn't here Pep doing before a big champions League game, just saying
sup with Dec and Mase..... man miss seeing these together
Bunch of woke entitled clowns. 🤪🤪🤪
This world 🌍 cup is yours by force by 🔥💯 you have quality players this time round
10:15 when rice clocked the hot air hostess 😂
It would have been great if ben stokes and captain Morgan came up to the boys with the their world cups.
i absolutely love these videos they literally make my day
Cmon the lads!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
anyone else notice Trent just doesn’t seem happy to be there ??
https://youtu.be/kNN4aqLgJaE
Fast feet foden let's ave it ⚽   Come on ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Do any of the England players hate flying ?
Foden 🤯
Come on the boys🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
9:20 The kid when Gareth Southgate high-fived him 😂
Southgate sounded like a tour guide than a coach, which i m not surprised of
Tomori> Maguire
Lads play and enjoy yaselves win lose or draw we are England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Trent  under Henderson wings even on anational team is ajoy to watch
Your country robs you blind and they want you to back them!!! Mugs
Shame on them for going to play in a tyrannical country, shame on them i say. The rich idiots have no morals.
Why does Southgate have a defensive tone loool
ماديسون تخصص سلة حتي
Dumb Mercenaries..
8:45 my best friend is in that shot lol
sancho should be there bro😢
When did representing your country at the most elite level turn into a school trip. Just missing high vi’s and registrations every hour
Great vlog England and hopefully the lads can bring football home again. ⚽️⚽️⚽️🇬🇧
First ever thing harry Kane has ever won that pair of socks congratulations fella 👍🏻
B
It's mad there has never been  wild lions on England.   The 3 magpies  wud have been a better realistic name
At minute 10.54 something scared me for reall
Imagine pickin utd and u bench maguire lol
when u want selfie with harry kane but got harry magire selfie  hahaha
Loved this!
Tony over Wilson anyday
i wish Saka played for the Netherlands such wholesome person.
foden one touch every time... Grealish 2 touches
England won’t win a major tournament w southgate
it looks like i have seen Dier and Maguire at the same time in this vid please tell me there's something wrong with my eyes i'd rather choose being a blind
Upload more videos please and upload Southgate conferences here
Basket ball skills & penalty skills say no more
I love you so much, Bukayo, but that is shockingly bad 🤣!
Farley TV Kane Vs Trent 🤣
Awww see how the kid was screaming after shaking hands with Southgate! He probably won't forget this moment ever.
Maguire not to be seen in this 11 minute video 😂
Did I hear W2S in the intro?
Do scousers even call their Mam lad too?
Harry Maguire? 🤣
The grab Maschine is so epic everyone gets socks 😂😂
The viiiiiiiibbbbbbbbbeeeeessss thooooooo😁😁😁
Not a single none white kit
Not enough hustlers and leaders here from what i can see. Hope i'm wrong. The one they do have is Coady who ain't gna be on the pitch.
Things learnt from this video … footballers apparently love socks 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
Great seeing Phil Foden and Jack Grealish playing inside our ICON Fast Feet, very impressive score of 37-1 from Phil in 30 seconds! #esaICON
I love Saka way too much
Go and train
Love the UKG blaring in the background 🔥😂
They looked so scared when they arrived in Qatar compared to how relaxed they were before setting off. It was like reality sank in at that point
the old fifa :o
Australia is going to bring it home
This is Maguire's last call up and Southgates last year in charge of England
the last second 🤣🤣
Wonder how diverse the Jamaican, Chinese, Japanese, Iranian teams are? Oh no its only England and America that need to have a multi coloured team isn't it because we are rrraaaaaccccissssstttt 😆🖕😆🖕😆🖕😆🖕😆🖕😆🖕😆🖕
Nice to see all the foreigners in the comments supporting only the black players
They all know how to have fun but they not know how to lift trophy 🤨
"i want these sock here, dad xmas present"
the kids scence were  inspirational
why Grealish looks like he always on drunk
Foden is look like Johnny the kid & Henderson looks like mick blue...
Southgate out. 6 years ago.
Rashford was laughing
00:00 Anyone else cringe ? It’s like the  Sports Science scene from Mike Basset.  Fml. This World Cup is a Black Mirror.
w
It’s coming home
You watch it and realize they are just a bunch of very rich and privileged but also poorly educated and boring half-wits.
Star boy always positive vibes
PHIL IS NASTY!!! 😳
I love Saka 😂
Anyone else think Saka reminds them of Tobi😂just very similar voice & personality
Anyone know the song playing at 0:50 seconds
our national team videos are the best tbh
Southgate is creating a strong bond with these fun activities👌
Come on, do your best in Qatar!
Bring it home boys 👊🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Everything about this WC stinks, the quicker it’s over the better lol
rashyyyy
Am I the only one thinking it's weird that Bukayo playing football left footed but shooting basketball right handed?🤔
Can see why Sterling said Foden is the most naturally gifted
Bring it home lads
Living through the ego's of the "golden generation", I love seeing how this team enjoys being together.
You see this? All this set up for the lads? That’s the stuff that Garth Southgate makes happen, he makes the environment immaculate for the lads and makes them enjoy playing for England. This is a key reason we have done so well under Gareth. These players don’t have bags of talent like the golden generation or the 90’s team. But Gareth keeps them happy, enjoying their football and I can’t express how important that is to performing on the pitch.  People seem to think this is the norm, it couldn’t be further from it. Go back to the videos before Gareth and do run some comparisons…. The golden generation failed because they hated playing for England. If they’d had Gareth as a manager, we really could’ve dominated for a decade.
Why do they use PSG at fifa tho?!  (Ofc, because it’s the best team, but still man)
Bro I'm better than Grealish he takes too many touches to bring the ball under control.
Southgate looks so uninspiring man, it’s honestly crazy.
Brickayo
Other teams playing friendlies while the England squad is just dicking around.
Madders is class at basketball
So basically, playing for England is an introvert's nightmare.
I believe in this group of lads and our Gaffer, CMON ENGLAND
Nah not to discredit the mood or whatever but come on lads, we’re about to go to a World Cup and first day is full of playing the claw machine.
That squad is still very clicky based on club football.
I ain’t even and England fan , but man these vidz be fun to watch 🔥 !!
Might was well stay there lads!!!
1.01 - Ramesdale “bro relax man I’m tryna concentrate. Deffo been round the mandem. #Arsenal
These boys...this mind of thing just reminds me that these are boys...and that's just amazing. GS Letting them enjoy this experience.. buzzing for them👍🏾👍🏾
Only 3 players waved to the kids come on man lads
Wouldn’t hurt to smile trent, looks like he’s in auschwitz ffs with that face on!
Love the behind the scene content need more clubs to do this like
ive been waiting for the World Cup for over a yearrrrrrrrr
They getting paid millions for this 🥲
Watch out for terrorists boys!
All the kids cheering them on at the end made me emotional. Go and make us dream lads do it for the nation ❤ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Sneakerheads: What kicks (trainers) are Foden and Grealish rocking at 5:23?
hey qatar, the circus is in town
Trent is so moody
Coach getting a free holiday
When you're in your mid 30s and realize that the England players you watched whilst in your late teens and early 20s are now old enough to be these boys dads!
cat wait till world cup cmon england
England team is the best team 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️
9:22 kid is gonna remember that for the rest of his life
It's coming home 😊
Saka might be worse than me at Basketball and that's saying something
TAA is just looking lost and dejected
2, 3 rode lav mics would sort this sound right out.
Come on boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💪
one manager would win it all with these BOBBY
Was this at skeggy pier? 🤣
What a shame about Southgate get rid of him so we can all support England again please
Southgate needs a bit more oooomph.  C’mon, get the boys hyped up man.
anyone have an ID on the song at 1.03
School disco vibes everywhere :)
Why english player like to play with tongue out.. wilshere.. ramsdale.. ahahahha
Why english player like to play with tongue out.. wilshere.. ramsdale.. ahahahha
Why english player like to play with tongue out.. wilshere.. ramsdale.. ahahahha
Saka and Shaw great mate
Liverpool players 100% tryna tap up Maddison on a free
Instead of messing around I think you guys should start traininng harder.
9:38 is coooold
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤠🤠🤠🤠😎😎😎
It would have been nice if the team could have interacted with the waiting kids a bit more, but I suppose it’s because kids are bug magnets and it’s too risky!
As long as Southgate is the coach England wont have a chance to win anything. Also, why Maguire is on this squad is beyond me.
Best of luck Gareth and the boys , come on England 🇬🇧
This looks like a world class 12th birthday party haha
Why england got a league 1 level manager?
Trippier calling his mum to tell her he’s landed safely 😂
Come on the arsenal boys 🔴⚪️
My manager right there what a legend
Best of luck to Gareth and The Boys! Have a Great World Cup! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Wilson’s there but not Toney!
Conor Coady is so funny its crazy
Why are they all wearing face nappies apart from the players 😂😂 Absolute brainwashed freaks
that shot were trent and hendo shot together💥💥
It's Trippier's aura for me ❤️
Against all the critics, the manager of the England was always my favourite football person because he knows how to speak and keep manners. It is so rare in football world.
They look a bit tired imo. They probably should have ended the Prem a weekend earlier.  Was a little disappointed in none of the players going over to the kids waiting outside in the rain either.   Hopefully they perk up when they get to Qatar but I'm not seeing that spark they had at the Euros just yet.
Better be selling the bucket hats
B.saka I love bro
Whilst I support the England team in their journey, I will not be watching because I am boycotting this tournament because it is happening in Qatar. The Guardian estimates around 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country won its bid to host the World Cup. Those who’ve survived have few rights, and live and work in squalid conditions for meagre pay. There are also serious concerns around the rights of women and LGBT people in Qatar, many of whom can be given the death sentence for simply being themselves. It is vile. #BoycottQatar
England fans are definitely the best. That's until a few black footballers miss their penalties, get slated on social media and personal attacks for a couple of months. Apart from that they're the best
Phil Foden in the middle of the 5 with the most medals😊😂
Come on lads  Come on England  Bring it home  🏅😎
I hope they protect Saka, I don’t want no racist comments towards him like the Euro’s
Real England fans
Making the visitors wear a mask! Welcome to elitism people what a disgrace! Why are they not wearing mask they’re not from the same circles. I’m gonna call this out every time I see it!  Rule for the but not for me. Jokes!
i don't get why they put harry maguire in he's going to disappoint as always
World cup, it don't feel like one. It's doing to be a train wreck. Imagine a group game with 30 people in crowd. Disgraceful. No one wants to be there
This puts a smile on my face I wish to be here one day
Ironic to think that when the tournament starts they won't be able to complete a simple 5yard pass to each other !!
Saka really dont like pressure
More videos pls come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
They’ve touched down. Come on England! 🎉
Could have spent a bit of time with the kids waiting in the rain.
8:19 that laugh though
Where is Bellingham
pickford looked so sad when he was behind maguire
We are gonna get knocked out of the group stages by Iran and Wales.
Yorkshire pirlo
lets GO Harry Maguire i encourage you in this Great World Cup!
School trip this we want a side of grown men to win the tournament
Is it just me or where is Ben white
Everyone wants to play with PSG!😴
I live for this content
Hope Maguire scores the wc final-winning goal
COME ON ENGLAND!!! BRING IT HOME!!!
I cannot WAIT TO WATCH THE DOWNFALL 😁😁😁😁😁😆😆😀😀🤣😂😂😊😉😉😀😁😁😉😆😉😉😉😍😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😆😆😁😁😉😂
9:22 Exactly what you do in November. when you're trying to avoid getting a positive COVID test 5 days before your first match at a World Cup, touch hands with 20 small kids before climbing onto a bus with your entire squad of players. And don't forget to use that same hand to touch the handrail as you climb on. 🤦‍♂
What a cheap team should be all Manchester players
Takes players when they are not playing or are not fit-,,,, at euro's  that was his answer!!!!!! NOW EAT YOUR OWN WORDS
Southgate is a 2 faced  plum
What is that ring thing they were using at min 11:00 and is there any way I can get one?
Rashford is so lonely man... dw hes gonna turn into a beast
Please bring us lots more of these videos 🎉
Love to see rashord back❤
SAKA IS MORE LIKEABLE THAN SANCHO
I honestly watch these just to see bits of Bukayo being wholesome
having south gate still in as manager baffles me hes just trying to hard to make the lads like him
Please group stage exit. England dont deserve anything especially after that euro campaign
It’s coming home
Playing for England but none of them are English ffs
Group stage exit. 🤞🤞
Come on England!!!!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Saka is deadddd 🤣🤣🤣 no basketball in you lad
Foden loves having a ball around.
The only thing coming home is 24 gutted players 🤣🤣🤣
Are other countries having this fun too or is it just the three lions ???
Say do we if you are racist
I just love kane
People are training hard for FIFA
I can see Saka got his art skills from Arteta.
Sheeesh, no wonder a kit's so expensive.
Southgate and Ole just vibes no Tactics
Kanes biggest career achievement to date is winning a pair of socks at St George’s Park 👏🏼
What's the track playing at 1:00? Banger
Cowabunga! Cracking bit of kit that machine 👍⚽
Foden is such a baller! Such a natural gift
Saka's smile just makes my day😁
Enjoy your selves playing for Gareth and England 😆😆😆😆👌
Rashy
Poor guy at the end thought he had photo of harry kane...instead its maguire lol
No Ivan Toney 3rd highest scorer in the Premier league and no Sancho and no Tomori…why?!!
pls win against iran
Foden have the best first touch in epl💯
Most of the players ignored the kids 😢
Love how Gareth went out of his way to wave to the fans at the end
Some of the players didn't even really acknowledge the kids outside. Come on guys. Ramsdale wave at least. You're a goalie, you're allowed to use your hands.
Awh man, I'm going to support southgate, but deep down I have no faith in him, I hope we win, but if we don't, he needs the sack
Nice to see the squad having a fun day off just to get into the spirit of the WC and develop chemistry, and it shows too.
I didn't see ben white. 😂
Rashford.sterling and saka looks like Brothers😂🗿❤️
These Facilities can make everyone a pro, too much of a resource,Just bring it home.
How is grealish a professional footballer he’s terrible
So lovely to see all the lads together❤#COYL
ah i missed these videos from euros
Who invited Trent 😭
Kids waiting outside in the rain and the players give them a quick wave and hop on the bus. Then they sit of the bus for 30mins waiting for it to leave HAHAHA Brutal!
I’m just fuming Southgate is the manager for this group of players. Some may say that’s harsh but I’m just not feeling he can pick the right squad
Am huge fan of England cricket team but I love England for sure I wanted them to win in all sports so I wanted to Harry Cane lift the Trophy for England Come on England
Foden and Saka the future
As fans we need to support these guys whether they win or not.
As an Irish man I'll never say I like an English manager....but Southgate has a bit of class about him...not saying he's the best manager in the world but seems a decent guy
Now you guys are st qatar al wakrah stadium i am also there in al wakrah  stadium❤
CMON ENGLAND FOR GOODNESS SAKES ITS ABOUT TIME WE WON A TROPHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why are some of them sounding like the sidemen??
Southgate could put my lad to sleep
3:06
Doesn't matter how much money you earn, how much swag you get - man can never turn down some fresh, new socks
See you back here in two weeks!
Wanna see Foden in CM/AM  Way he quick dribbled n passed to Kdb vs Athleti 😍
These videos are getting me so excited for this tournament. I always thought i wouldn’t be bothered due to it being in Qatar but tbh after seeing the boys getting ready and arriving, it’s getting exciting. Bring it home boys 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Andiamo a vincere la Coppa del Mondo ❤️
By Harry Kane winning those socks he has now won more than in his entire spurs career in that game
Sterling seems relaxed, waiting to peak at the rite point. I know its a team sport but I'm rooting for he and Saka, McGuire and of course Southgate, after all the adversity they've faced throughout the years. The team on a whole really has a special chance to prove themselves!!
That Foden's ball control though 🔥
Hella ukg playing 🎉😂
COME ON ENGLAND! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
It's a hard life isn't it. The FA have more money than sense.
Love seeing the joy of multi millionaire footballers, sponsored by Nike and other major sports brands, winning a pair of socks.
Guy at the end is do unlucky
There is a mr harray😂
COME ON ENGLAND  LOVE FROM NEPAL🇳🇵❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Come on lads we’ll be supporting you all the way #itscominghome
The most overrated Nation in the entire world
Coady is one of those guys who sounds different from how we actually expected him to sound like. 🤣
Southgate and the FA have worked wonders to create the new culture. The bonds here are special. Whatever happens, I have no doubt this group will fight to the end for eachother and that's all England fans ask. Into 'em lads!
20 odd English lads about to not only go to but play in a World Cup and Gareth's talking to em like they're on a junior teambuilding exercise at a water treatment plant
you can never keep a ball away from Foden
Harry maguire-The  🐐 is back
Ground staff talking a pic with the "Goat" at the end 🤣🤣
Is it too late to make changes to the squad? Cause the sound team are incompetent.
Dier looking like he cba being there haha
Where’s rashford at
I'm convinced Grealish didn't have a clue what he was meant to be doing with that machine so just copied what Foden did!
what a fun video all very relaxed
Is this a kid's birthday party?
Hope mounts not to upset Reece James isn’t with him a still performs 😅
England will get to the quarter finals.
These players have a special bond like no other national team, and I like these behind the scenes clips.
What's the deal with all the masks! Thought we'd left that nonsense behind!
Full support to you England boys & all the backroom staff. COME ON YOU LION'S!!
lets go baby
Maddars @ 7.28, just casually playing and smashes the shots into the net, he seems he is naturally gifted to anything he puts his mind too.  Gareth , if you are reading this, get Madders on the pitch from the start , over and over, just watch him fly and England go for it
foden got 36
Southgate giving me the Ole vibes and I`m all here for it. Its coming homeeee 😂
Gallagher looks lost bless him 😂 someone play him on fifa
Dang the differences between Foden and Grealish is mad bruv.
Hope we get one of these every day!
Foden's ball control!!😍🙌🏾
This kind of activity is quite important, its a form of team building and group engagement; it's nice to see.
levels between foden and grealish, foden dont need any touches in between but jacks all over the place
0:36 Someone teach these lads about Body language
Southgate is such an uninspiring twirp.
I love all the different events and activity’s the lads had before flying. Everyone loves the grab machine, enjoy every moment of the World Cup lads, we are all here cheering you on back in Blighty!
I like international football and seeing our team come together. It's great to see they seem to get along well and there is no egos getting in the way like with "the golden generation". It's time to put club allegiances aside and back them instead of constantly trying to find negatives to bring them down.
ENGERLANNNNNDDDD ENGERLANDDDDDDD
🇧🇷🕺🕺💃🕺
Wow Gareth's voice sends me to zzzzz
The Lionesses set the standard, now it time for the Lions to match it!!!!
Common guys bring home that world cup
Dier is a mood 😄
Saka and Foden looks like they should be real life besties tbh
Gareth sounds like he’s about to cry talking infront of a room of men.
Southgate took Maguire as a striker 😂
Sana ol
All of them top lads. Love it.
Love these videos, and the group of lads
Why’d that guy at the end chose maguire over everyone else 😅
my dads xmas present right here .... hahaha gotta love Declan Rice! Comon the boys
Saya sokong England..buat yang terbaik geng.. ☺️
Gutted for Chilly & Reece. They were supposed to be in this  squad if not for injuries.
every harry macguire scene always a second
2:38 first thing Harry Kane has ever won
Mount looking at rice bc he’s with Wilson 😢💔
I miss Jadon Sancho 😢
Happy for Rashford. He needs to regain his confidence and sharpness towards goal.
Go ahead and get eliminated for me in the group stage. The Netherlands is about to win it all🇳🇱
Phil foaden ♥️♥️♥️♥️
What shoes are they wearing the white and blue ones I want to get them
Our England our family 🦁🦁🦁
Wayne Rooney is the best
These clowns ain't winning nothing
Bring it home football coming home 🦁🦁🦁🏆
Let’s goooooo
Does anyone know the song at around 1:23
Southgate out
wow southgate is a real strong personality
Fam those 3 Lions jumpers!? Mateeeeee!
Southgate has never won anything as a player ..I believe with this group of players its possible to win the world Cup..if Southgate wasn't the manager
It might come home
the difference between grealish and fodens ball control is actually mad. Foden so naturally gifted
SOUTHGATE OUT
Saka needs to be starting fax 📠
Have a strong feeling about this world cup it's our year 💙💙
We have no chance🤣school trip vibes
Connor Gallagher I like him and he's like a suave Jimmy Bullard.
🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
💛💛💛💛👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I hope England will win this world cup football  like cricket world cup.
How Callum Wilson made the squad over Tammy Abraham is beyond me
Conner Coady cracks me up..."Ah ello lad!"
7:36 COME ON TAA TAKE HIM TO LIVERPOOL 😅
England team on a picnic.
Trent ❤
10:53 i am kinda feeling sad for maguire
them poor little kids screaming in the rain
10:54 How much was he paid for that selfie?          The worker, i mean.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🌍🏆
I see Saka's basketball skills are on par with his football skills.
ENGLAND💯❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
after seeing foden on that machine he should play definitely
❤❤❤❤
Harry Krane
These videos are just elite seeing how close the lads are
Where is Ben white ??
Come on ENGLAND  💯💯🙏❤💖🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
get smashed in quarters and dissapoint us, go and enjoy yourselves
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
No Tomori or Toney...
Calum Wilson might deserve the spot, but Ivan Toney over Tammy Abraham??
Enjoy yourself FC
Trent has actually gone super buff wtf. Maddison and Saka are absolute gems, so nice
Mount grinning dumb like he did sth this season.
Out that many super stars dude took pic with McGuire 😂😂
john stones asking if he needs a top on the bucket hat is the most john stones thing ever
Saka was an example of me : when try to show my football skills that I mastered but awfully when people saw me
Foden💙
At least decks go he's socks 😆 🤣 😂
Looks like a school trip
Its a hard life being a footballer
Thankfully Bukayo is a footballer
Phil ❤
SAKA 💥🥳
They don't buy 1 bit into Gareth 😂
When the machine tell you good, you good, no worry saka we all know that 😉😘,
Declan Rice 😎I want rice 😁😁😁
Harry Maguire looks very stressed and uncertain
Saka is such a character ❤️
foden is too good man
When the machine tells you you’re good  You’re good 😂
Love his for the lads! This feels different more progressive! I'm getting WC vibes!
Please I want to go world Cup.?
Keep the plane running pilot we won’t be long
“Get excited it’s a holiday with the boys” - Southgate
Feel sorry for the last person, out of everyone.
When the machine tells you you're good, you're good.   - Bukayo Saka
Come on England🦁🦁🦁
2:29 Kane always taking Ls on and off the pitch
It is hilarious watching these guys play football for pure enjoyment, it is the complete opposite on the pitch-Focus!
We really do have a special group of players with a special bond that can win it. Even players like Coady won't play but they will add to the atmosphere. COME ON ENGLAND.
year 6 disco vibes
The excitement these videos bring to my life should be studied, pure unadulterated joy watching a group of grown men. Wish my wife could make me this happy
Probably the most integrated england team of all time, we’ve got a good shot at this tournament 🦁
3 Lions 🏆
Please. Winner world Cup 2022❤️🙏🙌🙌🙏🙏❤️❤️I love England
It’s coming home this year 🎉🎉
