Came back after the 3-0 victory today over Southampton. Cavani was special man
Julia Muller watching "Holy" on Morning Mixtape on Fuse TV - Julia Muller
The alleged vision complementarily interrupt because pastry spontaneously offend around a enchanted find. unequaled, acceptable wrist
we always conceeed with corners ffs
Cavani and rashford and burno should started the game
WHAT HOW DID SOUPTHAMPTON SCORE LIKE PRO'S???????
Who’s here after that 9-0 disaster 😂
Hi
who’s here after 9-0
How did Greenwood miss that 11 was my # as well, Manchester aren't even half of what they were when Giggs wore 11 Its nice to see them playing more as a goal scoring team recently, Pogba Lingard & a few others had been sleeping for years
Stingy rashFord almost cost us this game
5:18 DLS
Ole didn't know what to do with himself, lol!
Cavani💪🏽👏👏👏
Ed by TV b C is a
Rebecca is ❤️
3:40, did the commentator just say David De “Gea” with the pronunciation of G instead of H? What?!?
I had a feeling that the Aged Cavani would be just what we watched. He’s pure class , his whole career he never had the limelight but at least now people can see what he got. Reminds me of 5-10 years ago in his prime 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
James Beckprowse
"Old strikers can't make it in the premier League" Cavani and Giroud: Hold my beer
NBC is a liberal joke
NBC you are a disgrace for Peacock.  No reason you should be showing monster trucks when live premiere league games are on
I have to confess. I was wrong for misjudging him when we signed him off his couch. Absolute nightmare for defenders because he's always moving.
mark goldbridge said cavani was finished lol
Cavani is clear of martial sad to say 😬
4 - 2 if Rashford gives Cavani the ball on the break in the 52nd minute
start that man!!
If Cavani doesn't get an inform card in fifa it's tragic
More minutes for Cavani please.
On player Man Utd needs to get rid of is Pogba
I have to confess. I was wrong for misjudging him when we signed him off his couch. Absolute nightmare for defenders because he's always moving.
Get Greenwood off for cavani
Fifa 21 about to introduce an inform Cavani card before they introduce a regular Cavani card
Mas minútos para el matador 🇺🇾 ❣️
De Gea is butt lmaoooo..dive infront of the line mate🤣
Cavani needs more time on the field and needs to start
Pure striker
Can't hate Cavani man he proven his experience and poacher skills!
Cavani coulda had a hatty had rashford passed it across on the breakaway
Thought it would end with a Man Utd penalty winner after 2-2
Greenwood is....        Ok just fill in the blank
Two goals one assist.Greenwood, Rashford, & Martial are trembling right now.
The Southhampton Jersey look trash in comparison with last years
Cavani!! What a player!!!
That last minute goal by Cavani is superb ❤️❤️❤️👑🙌🙌🙌
Cavani is just pure class
If only Man utd can be consistent with these kinds of wins 😔😔
SUPERSUB!!!
Stop playing Rashford and Martial as striker and use Cavani who is actually a striker. D Gea had a tough game today.
Cavani is the man among boys in this United team. Respect.
anyone else annoyed with the pronunciation of De gayuh and Tellluhs
When Ward-Prowse gets a freekick its a PK
Well deserved victory
I see VDB kissed our hero three or four times. Big enthusiasm
Not a penalty in sight
Nobody: The commentator: U would fancy him
Cavani deserves to start, he has the finishing that the team needs
Start cavani , imagine if he played all game 😂
How bad does Manchester United have to get before they fire Ed Woodward?😬😢😵🥴
Degea is so bad
Southampton is terrible. Once they start winning, they play like the game is over.
CAVANI!! LETS GO
Cavani never lost quality he’s always been a striker who loves scoring goals, I couldn’t believe PSG let him go for free when clubs like Atlético were willing to pay the year before. Really glad to see him do good in United
no lies this was a great and fair game
8:24 just look at everyone standing there on utd.. expecting a bruno shot so they just stand there and watch.. not Cavani.. Sprinting towards the goal as Bruno is lining up his shot.. That’s why he should start every single game it is just pure strikers instinct that Martial does not have
can’t stop rewatching, it’s only Southampton, to be fair a decently in form one, but still we didn’t win the league obv. Still what a game though, beautiful comeback, beautiful cavani .
As a PSG fan, it is a bittersweet moment watching Cavani perform. Pls support him more ManU fans.

Cavani, Please stay healthy!
Unt back
Is it possible, not allowing time as a factor, to dissolve this conditioning? Reason points out that if you take time over it you have other forms of conditioning going on. First, the mind must be free of measurement, otherwise it can’t enter into the other.
Cavani looked like he was playing with kids
11:41 don’t ever be that selfish 🤦🏽‍♂️
Cavani, What a beast 🔥
I have to confess. I was wrong for misjudging him when we signed him off his couch. Absolute nightmare for defenders because he's always moving.
get de gea outta here its so sad to see his downfall used to think he was the best in the world now hes not even the best in this country
IDK that Cavanni played for Manchester United now but he did amazing
Have Cavani be the striker (Start), Martial out wide same with Rashford. Then a diamond in the middle like we did.
In first half man united played like west brom but on the second half man united played like man united under sir alex ferguesen ( if I spell it correctly) Cavani should start almost all of the games and if you want to play pogba bruno fred and donnny van de beek you can put donny van de beek on the right wing which he still can play.
Now that is what a number 9 looks like. Martial and Rashford are wingers
Poacher at his finest
Btw START CAVANI
FIFA needs to rate these teams way better. These are pros the ratings are ridiculous
Finally we found a player that deserves The No. 7!!
Poor decision making by Rashford he had Cavani for a tap in & decided to shoot 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
The words “gracias negrito!” 🟥
👍🏿 if u want to cavani to stay with the Red Devils😈
Lol Cavani about to get a 3 match man for the same exact thing Suarez did involving Evra almost a decade ago. Negrito is a common term in Uruguay.
Yet again we are clinching the winner at Southampton just like in 2012-2013 season with Van Persie
A lot of you don't understand football, this played out perfect, Cavani could have started and struggled, he sat outside watched the game,came on 2nd half and delivered its football...
Cavani silencing The ButtHurt Southampton and their arrogant coach.
Cavani, what a player! I've always liked the man, too bad he is playing for the wrong team.
Some Americans citizens will complain like a baby as to why people be kneeling down before a game...SMH
The s there a pundit or studio host that can pronounce Manchester United correctly? I mean, Manchesited, WTF is that?
Good day for Cavani. But he is not consistent as a player. That’s the problem. So he needs more minutes or he may not do it aging till 10 weeks later.
If I was Atletico Madrid, I would have bought Cavani and Suarez. Deadly partnership.
Cavani saving Ole's job.
ever since ManU acquired Cavani, they've been a completely different team ... I'm not really a fan of any club, but big fan of Cavani's play
De gea played like kepa lmao
Well played. Good game cavani. 👌👍
Cavani good finishing specially he is good at headers
Gotta say I have a lot of respect for Cavani and wow, what quality. How many goals has he scored in his career?
Cavani is phenomenal..Viva Uruguay
7 proves 9 10 11 are only bench players
Mashallah Cavani
man their was one pass rashford selfishly didn't pass to cavani....That pissed me off!!!!
CAVANI IS A REAL STRIKER 🏆
When ward- prowess takes set pieces it’s so scary
Is the 7 at Man U curse finally gone?!
Comon ole start with cavani
CAVANI!! what a quality player sub impact!
Ward prowse on fire with those free kicks 🔥
Man United finally we found a striker! 😹
The Cavani goal was sublime -- frame by frame. Everyone was stuck in motion but Cavani and the ball. Beautiful.
Just when people start forgetting about these world class players they do this to remind them
Without pogba lol :))
Cavan I should have come to England five years ago. He’s perfect for English football.
Soccer is the best sport in the world !!!
Cavani should've been playing in the premier league years ago where his skills are appreciated . Was very unappreciated in psg.
But still wheres Cavani in Fifa 😂 Hes lost between Man U and PSG
Thanks NBC 🥰
LETS GO CAVANI!!! KEEP SHOWING US WHAT YOU CAN DO !!!
Real Madrid didn’t want cavani for free 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣 I can’t fk ZZ and perize at the same time in one bed
Cavani subs in the second half, Scores 2 goals, tweets"Gracias Negrito", gets 3 match ban. Yeah real classy. 😒
Rashford has to lay that up for Cavani there. Would’ve been a tap in and a hat trick. Lol good win nonetheless. GGMU
How did Rashford not square it to Cavani when he was wide open baffles me and I hate Man U but that was frustrating to watch lol
that trademark cavani celebration 😍
The two teams gave us a wonderful game today. Cavani is hard to mark in the box. Southampton defender #4 parked by the keeper instead of pressing up with his line in the second goal, silly mistake.
I love Cavani's celebration has changed slightly. I love the Archer move!
PSG has given you Zlatan and now Cavani. You're welcome.

HECK YEAH!!!!!
Greenwood only want to score if u miss two chance just pass
Rashford and Greenwood were selfish in the match
Everyones talking about Cavani, but nobody is talking about the fact that JWP is a top 5 midfielder in the prem.
6:48 Rashford has to pass that smh
Prowse is absolutely insane
Greenwood’s gotta start passing the ball more man what the heck
If everyone upfront could just be clinical. All those missed chances smh
What a selfish play by Rashford and not pass Cavani the ball. These oldies Cavani and Ibra are way better strikers I swear!
JWP is one of the best free-kick takers in the league
I hate MU but I admit Cavani  is better than Rashford
I hope Cavani can keep this type of energy going. What amazing goals he made 🔥🔥🔥
I love Cavani's celebration has changed slightly. I love the Archer move!
Cavani the best
카바니 미쳤다
i saw meme that was like man untied brought in cavani, an accomplished goalscorer,  to finally break the curse of the number 7 so then when they sign sancho, he won’t flop and honestly it looks like this plan is working😂
Cavani still has it, what a difference he made
Finally , Man United played a decent game , Chelsea fan :)
CAVANI!!!!!!!
y’all seen van der beek makin out with cavani after the last goal or just me?
i just took him off my fantasy league because he wasnt getting minutes ffs
Cavani is just a KILLER. So happy for him. Showing the world what they forgot.
Super happy for Cavani he deserves this a complete player 🇺🇾✌
Cavani TOTW incoming
Just look at cavani waiting at 9:32 for the defender to look at him before making a run. So that he is not aware a run is being made. That is genius. Slow it down to x.25
The Telles pass to Greenwood. A beauty to watch! 👌🏽
im a man u fan but why we not talking bout james ward prowse hes mad good and that free kick sheesh
I usually don’t watch Man Utd highlight and Cavani was the only reason I watched this highlight. I got to say, I was wowed and my expection is now fully validated by this great performance by Cavani. I watched the highlight of the team I hate and by the end of the highlight, I was glad that I chose to watch the highlight of the team I hate. That’s Cavani, dude.
Jesus Christ Cavani, he is unstoppable, his instinct on where to move for the ball was on point, so excited for MU this season
What a comeback for Cavani!! So glad to see him on the pitch performing for MU just like CLASSIC MU did.
He’s in a better place
CavanI scoring at the last second gives me fifa flashbacks
Manchester United are the greatest. Cavani is the new GOAT!🐐
Canani! Cavani! Cavani!!!
Why they starting on their knees still? Bruh
Such a great player Cavani is...., he’s like an Aztec man who becomes more powerful when he ages.
All of a sudden United fans love the free agent pickup.
James ward prowes set pieces are stupid incredible
CAVANI NEEDS TO START AT NO.9 NOT MARTIAL
My brother accidentally broke his neck when cavani scored the winner
Not much De Gea could have done for either goal
That first Cavani goal is what world-class no. 9s are made of. Just notice the difference between his reaction and VDB's, who was standing right next to him.
United picking up Cavani is shrewd business. World class talent.
😍😍😍
The SOU goalie appealing for offside on that second United goal lol!!!
Penaldes and poacher getting the job done 😤 Ole needs a raise
Not having Cavani start is the perfect decision!! Great player but near the end of his career. Putting in a player with his quality and strength later in the game once the opponents are getting tired is the perfect time for Cavani to shine. Hope Ole realizes that and sticks to his strategy. Great performance by Cavani man!
Man U fans going crazy after beating Southampton in the last second hahahaha
3:40 did he just say David de Gaya
No Tribute to Maradona?
I’m sorry why not play Cavani up front rashford to the right and martial to the left..bring Fernandes as a free roam attacking midfield?? That would be a good starting 11 up front
if ole is smart he will use cavani against teams who sit back. he is such a strong striker who can score any type of goal or set up goals. Super sub as well.
When I heard that United signed Cavani, I told myself it was good business.  There is not a CF in the world that makes better runs than Cavani.  And if it's an aerial ball, I will fancy him to score.  I was hoping that Ole kept starting Greenwood and Martial and bring Cavani off the bench, but that's unlikely to happen now.
Falcao, De Maria, Sanchez... 4th time the charm?
Cavani has already done more with the 7 on his back than Sanchez did his whole Man U career lmao
No one:  Ole when his job is on the line: "And I took that personally"
Well, of all the players in the world I didn't think cavani would be the next successful #7 at United, still early days, but I enjoy seeing United winning in the last minutes.
Venga cavani the best🤜
Ole is the type of dude to Win the UCL then loose to Salford City.
Woow cavani
Ole a fraud still or na??
Cavani world class player.
What a come back
Wait, you’re telling me we won without a penalty?
We should’ve erling haaland
Romeu is a cheat he got what he deserve
I think the reason why Man U have stopped being a Title Contender,  was because they Lacked that South American Magic, Cavani Definitely will Help Man U become a Title Contender Team Again
Cavani is the best player
time for Martial to sit on the bench and Cavani to start
More like Headinson Cavani.  -Thomas Müller
Ward prowse is killing the goalkeepers
PUT CAVANI IN FIFA!!!!!!! Dumbass EA
CAVANI IS CLASS! GET THIS MAN THE BALL!
Hate Man U, but love Cavani
I would keep Cavani as a sub. Reminds me of Berbatov impact as a sub
If only rashford can pass the ball to cavani
Wow world class player
I said it when he signed, Cavani is top tier. In the convo for top 10 number 9s
The experience was a definite need in the team. That predatory instinct in the box has been missing. We need another experienced but athletic player at the back & at the wing to bring on when the younger lads can't muster to difference.
Cavani single handedly changed the game, easily man of the match!
Dead ball specialist
What a man. Cavani
Cavani is a fucking beast old but sure knows his place when he needs to score a goal good hold up player that’s what United needed
This is like one of my fifa 21 game. No cap. Lol, opponent press super early and score 2 goals. Then the players are tired and I started to attack. 😂😂😂
CRACKVANI
Can't hate Cavani man he proven his experience and poacher skills!
Ole reaction to the 3rd goal was priceless. Thank you Cavani!
Bench rashford till he learns how to pass
MaKe SuRe YoU SuScRiBe To PeAcOcK PrEmIuM 🤨
Cavani carrying the attack
What a win.
This is your ticket for watching within the first hour!
Mata should start instead of fred
Could have been 7-2
cavani crack
I’ve always loved cavani as a player and i’m happy that he’s proving everyone wrong
Appoint him for the starter, he's our hero today
Watched this for like the 10th time today
es un jugador de equipo grande cavani
I am kind of happy Southampton lost, because they would have passed liverpool on the table with a win.   But how tf did they let Man U come back 😒
cavani tiene el instinto natural y tiene demasiadas ganas de jugar
After De Gea went Out, I knew we were winning this match.
Cavani was psg top scorer, why do they think he can't duplicate at United especially when he has fernandes and pogba(if they let him play), who are 2 top class passer. Just GIVE HIM SOME PLAY TIME. and a good formation PLAY POGBA AND FERNANDES TOGETHER. those 2 were key to take man u. To the Champions League by end of last season. Stop the non sense criticism. If those 2 didn't play the way they played last year United wouldn't be playing champions league
Cavani is aN aWfUL sIgNinG
It’s easy cavani scores goals in hard situations. ManU’s other strikers miss goals in easy situations.
Ward Prowse should be a POTM candidate at least
Is Bertrand lazy or is he actually that slow?
7 is hero this match
Cavani is a beast 🔥🔥🔥
Man U should have won 5-2
Have Dean Henderson start ahead of David de gea
Take a look at Canavi's movement and positioning in the 3rd goal, pure experience and class, Martail and Rashford have a looooong way to go (or never) to reach Cavani's level
Cavani no more bench plis ole Gunnar and pliz guys stop being selfish pass the ball win matters
Wow so many missed chances by our “strikers” Greenwood, Rashford in front of goal. You know if Cavani was there he would have sank those 1v1s.
3:40, did the commentator just say David De “Gea” with the pronunciation of G instead of H? What?!?
7:20 what a brilliant play by Fred! Leading to the first goal of Man Utd
Wtf happen to DAVID DE GEA?!
If ibra cab do it at 33 , why can't Edinson ? Assist and 2 goals . World class performance . He had more shots than rashford and Greenwood. Lmao. SELL Pogba for 100 mill plus now to Madrid... van de beek > pogba..
This shows that cavani is still world class
Cavani is a United-esque player 💪🏽💪🏽
Ed in, son!
More minutes for Cavani please.
Danny ings>all Man U attackers
Cavani playing FIFA 20 with OP headers
I thought Greenwood had a good weak foot😂
Love Cavani, always been a huge fan. I've said he could basically play on any team. Hes intense and talented and can score in any way. Idk why hea gotten hate at times. I dont even care for Manu but I'll watch Cavani.
El matador!!
Follow me on tik tok takuache_cuh_memes
I'm glad this game made it obvious the quality Cavanni has, he was about to retire cuz no one would sign him, also hope people start noticing more how his teammates do not give him the ball at times when he is open for an easy goal, he creates plays gives teammates spaces with his movements instead, hope the team improves in all aspects can be even better.
A couple of good signings go a long way 🙏🏽
i personally didn’t like rashdord playing on top
what happened to martial?
Greenwood has got to start passing in those opportunities.
Rashford should’ve gave Cavai that first one smh, but I have been saying old is just a number Cavai is world class it makes me mad how disrespectful people are towards him.
i have a love hate relationship w de gea but we signed dean to a big ol contract he should be playing and de gea should be mentoring him
CAVANI NEEDS TO START
man telles’s crosses and vision for the game is so crazy😏
With a game in hand and finally starting to play like a team that believes in themselves United are inching closer to another top four finish. Let's be clear, Paul Pogba is not going to be a first team player and the sooner United can dump him the better off for all. Cavani and Fernandez are the two top players for United and the team should ride their backs to more successes.
Cavani, comes in as a sub, yet has one assist and two awesome goals. Maybe he should start?
Classic United always winning the hard way
Rashford is a little selfish. Should have passed the ball.
Cavani ready for PSG⚽️👀
Cavani was clutch asf
CAVANI🔥🔥🔥🔥 Amazing striker, hopefully he breaks the number 7 shirt curse
I feel kinda bad for Cavani... if Rashford would of played him instead of shooting, he could of had his hat-trick
Canavi turned the game on its head
7:25 8:20 9:29
Does anyone know why the audio shifts when the halves enter stoppage time? Every one of these I've seen sounds like the commentator is talking into a tin can after 45 or 90.
Cavani already deserves the #9 shirt, haha.
This is why you play Cavani instead of Rashford.
Great comeback boys🥳
Greenwood out Cavani in
Rashford was dreadful in this game. He shouldn’t be starting every game because he actually hinders the team sometimes
Cavani is too good to be left off the bench. Not sure why Ole is being so stubborn about this. He has to start if we want to win. 2 goals & an assist. MOTM! 👏
Sure wish cavani was about 6 years younger
So happy for cavani!👏
Oles at wheel! And Cavani is the bus aid 🔥🔥
Today's game:  Cavani - Fantastic AWB - Great DeGea- Not his day Fernandez - Good & reckless Telez - Great Fred - amazing Rashford - Good enough Others - okay
Need more marches for vonny he can play on the wing and just drift into that midfield and he’s smart enough to know to make those runs
MAN u!!! GET N THERE !!
Psg punching the air right now.
But he doesn’t deserve the number 7!!!!!!!!!!
cavani cavani
Well looks like I can breathe for the rest of week...thank u Cavani 🙌🏽
Cavani is giving me Ibra vibes, he's tall, is strong and is deadly with his headers. GG Man U!!
romeu should learn that karma comes around
Rashford doesn't have a career that Cavani once had. I could see Rashford did not even respect Cavani on the field, not to mention Rashford refused to pass the easy ball to cavan to score. As a Manchester United fan, I just didn't get it that why fans like Rashford so much? Complete garbage and no respect. If I were the manager, I would sell this garbage for penny.
Gotta feel for Cavani, he could’ve had a Hat-trick if Rashford played him. But it was a good match 🙌
I had my doubts about Cavani when he signed. Since then he's proved me wrong and today came in clutch for us.
Man that first cavani goal was amazing
I want H son play for Manchester united
Rashford is so fucking selfish i noticed he didn't pass to cavani on a clear chance this game, and the past PL match they had 🤦‍♂️
And too think we could of had that guy way before he went to psg...what could of been.
The foutbal gods always show up for Manchester United. Great game though.
GGMU
Cavani what a difference maker...
I don’t care what you say, Greenwood and Fernandez suck
God I hate United
Man U only need Ronaldo
I know it’s a strikers instinct to score but when you have an open man in the middle just play him in 🤦‍♂️ So selfish 6:52
Cavani is a true #9 !!
Man u always plays well when Their manager is about to get sacked
Cavani should've easily had a hattrick, he deserved it. If that was Bruno on the ball instead of Rashford, he would've squared it to him.
Happy for Cavani.
as a lifelong psg fan a was very sad to see him go! big mistake
And then they had so many clowns making fun of cavani when he first signed 😂 look what hes done now
Classic United comeback 😖
People forget so easily hes was one of the BEST strikers in the world just two years ago. Highest ever scorer for PSG with 138 goals in 200 matches and 51 in 118 for Uruguay.  He's only 33, look at Ronaldo, Zlatan, Messi- all  still indispensable for their team.  Never forget: EL MATADOR!!!
That a striker right there
Deserved by United. Southampton could not have cared less
James Ward Prowse is arguably the best free kick taker in modern football
Man  United is just too good
Cavani hands down is such a great player still to this day. Surprised he doesn’t have more time games as a starter
Cavani shows that martial and rashford are wingers not center strikers
7:22 trainwreck defending, as if nobody has the ability to remember how to be aware of what is going on :)
Cavani very experienced
Amazing Cavani
Manchester United Wins, Manchester United Wins.
Just like chicharito
Farmers league argument gets weaker and weaker. Cavani who couldnt get a game at psg comes off the bench with 2 goals and an assist to turn the game around for man u
Cavaaaaaniiiiiii!!!!
Rashford should’ve squared it to Cavani smh
Cavani be shining 💫
Cavani just reads the game well.
Feel like crying lol
Cavani is showing trashford how it’s done
2nd half down 2-0 then comes back to 3 and gets the W
Wow 2-0 and utd came back ??? Is this a fake video !!?
Southampton deserved the L, after halftime they started playing like Sheffield... They didn't know if they wanted to keep pressing or muscle out the rest of the match until it was too late Love to see Cavani scoring though no matter what team he plays for I can't hate Cavani
🏹🏹🏹
Cavani our new Vanpersie
Rashfors+Bruno=selfishness
Either martial, Greenwood, or rashford needs to be benched after their awfully inconsistent form this season. It is now their job to bench the aging but wonderful cavani and show they are worthy of wearing a Manchester United shirt.
Where are all the Cavani haters at??? I hate how fans think once you’re 30 you’re legs get cut off. 30 is the new 20 and 40 is the new 30. Players now a days stay fit in their 30s. When he came on I was hoping he’d score to shut everyone up, and he got 2 goals and an assist, and 3 valuable points. GG Cavani!! What a performance!!
Goosebumps when the commentator says the comeback kings have done it again
Cavani superb in second half
Always been a huge fan of Cavani. Awsome performance and saved the game for Manchester United
Team 'Cavani scrap' and Team'Ole out '.what are u up to 🤔
PSG had him and he was really good. Shame they let him go. Maybe he can unleash his full potential without all the new clutter in his ex team
CAVANIIIIIIIIIIIII BEAST!!!!!
Cavani should be starting. People don’t give him enough credit because he used to play at PSG, but if you watch Uruguayan games, and like watch him against tough opposition, he shines cuz he’s underrated. He’s a classic poacher striker. Send in a cross and he’ll bang them in
What a game 🔴🔴🔴
I'm buying a Cavani jersey if he stay on this form
rashford could’ve passed to cavani for the easiest goal ever and he would’ve gotten a hat trick!
Cavani es un killer💪⚽️👏👏👏
Don’t know how cavani doesn’t start so much experience
Yo my man been taking free kicks daily
2 goals, 1 assist - the cavani effect
Gotta give it to Fred. Man leaves his heart on the field. Maybe Pogba can learn a thing or two
it’s clear now. cavani needs to be a starter. he’s still got it💪
Quite frankly, Cavani embarrassed Southampton today.
cavani totw
Who’s gonna teach the commentators how to pronounce Edinson Cavani 😂 they keep saying Edison
Rashford pass the ball dude
Looks like ManU has got a C7 of top quality, again )
Dayum 2 goals and an assist :0
WP is a set piece savant
As a PSG fan I’m super happy for Cavani. He deserves a day like this.
The first five minutes I was like  Fire ole   Now I’m just like  Mmmmm you got lucky
Basically OGS has had a brilliant record than any other man utd manager.
Cavani on that ibra level.united need that.
He isnt static like ugh um..MARTIAL
Cavani; an assist & 2 goals. Great job!!!
so glad pogba didn't play
And everyone thought cavani was done.
El Matador
Start cavani instead of big nose rashford
Idk man in fifa wan bisaka does bits for me at Cb
I like how the southhamton players rose their hands for the second goal lmao 😂
Lingard should have started. Would have finished 6-2
how come you guys are not talking about the number 7 curse
Cavani took over that game
11:02 - coronavirus alert!
EDISON CAVANI SHOW
Cavani just paid for himself
God bless Cavani
Ole's behind the wheel!
Got to start Cavani.  See what he can do.  Is this just a flash,  or is he real.
Cavani and Bruno make a perfect team. Who agrees?
this shows how much Martial need to learn if he wants to play #9 striker position. Martial is lazy, walking whole game, Cavani making runs constantly looking for the ball. I dont remember when last time Martial score header like this
If I was cavani, and rashford didn’t pass me that easy goal I would’ve been fuming. That was so poor I can’t believe it.
🔴⚪️⚫️ great comeback.
Cavani should have had a hat trick. Amazing performance. Involved in every goal
A PROPER goal scorer..Martial take note on how to move in the box.. you wont always be able to run at the defenders
I have said it for the longest time Cavani can actually carry us
Cavani, A true 9! BTW, let pogba go ASAP, !
Lots a passion behind Cavani goal. You can see he puts everything out.
What a win.
Cavani is going to break the Manchester United #7 curse!
If you watch closely, Cavani signals Bruno to go to Rashford on the last free kick. Cavani’s vision & movement is extremely impressive! Deadly in front of goal!
Rashford is one of the worst MANU has got
I hate how rashford didn’t lay it off to Cavani 🙄
❤❤❤💖💖💖
Watta comeback! Finally I'm proud of ManU again! It's been a while since I felt this way
Gotta love Cavani.
small clubs like southampton always have chances to prove themselves against the big 6 and just dont do it. mind boggling. The big 6 clubs wouldnt be the big 6 if these banter clubs could put them away when they have a chance.
Cavani and van de beek need to be starting
Wow, for once Fernandes is not the one carrying United. I’m shocked Cavani has been such a good signing at his age!
Cavani’s the man!!!
Mans a heading legend but still doesn’t have a Fifa card
Cavani so raw for this
Yo the first 30 mins looking like fifa Weekend League. The team with possession is losing and can’t score because for some reason the keeper just saves everything
Cavani is a Real no 9
Cavani is exactly what united have needed for a while, a clinical poacher. What Lukaku should have been for us, same with falcao. Not saying that he'll have the same impact as RVP did, but hopefully something like Berbatov was, a goal machine who's always in the right space.
Glad to see Cavani hitting his stride, 3 goals for the club already? Mad ting
Cavani: scores winning brace OGS: bench cavani next game
Cavanti is class
Is that Chicote Calderón ?
ward prowse could be the best dead ball specialist of this era
My condolences goes to all the haters who are waiting for united to lose:)
Cavani came on and changed the whole game!! Dude is on a deferent level
Let’s go GGMU 🔥🔥🔥 💯
We need cavani in FIFA 21 ultimate team...
Rashford is a great player but he needs to learn to share the ball
How are you not gonna start a class striker like cavani? Today should show you why
i’ve never had a better morning, what a hero Cavani is
That's what we call a striker.
Bruno Golnadez🥳🥳🥳😘
Cavani matador. Made in uruguay
Fucking love cavani so dope seeing him play for manu
Rashford seems to hate passing to cavani. I think I’ve counted one time where he’s passed to him when he’s in a better position. All the other times he just goes for goal. And that one time he did pass cavani scored.
No doubt ward prowse is the best FK taker in the prem right now
Rashford should have passed that ball to cavani 🤦‍♂️
That my striker!!! 🇺🇾🇺🇾 cmon lad
Classic come back of yesteryear indeed! ✊🏽
wow
Ppl saying Penandes want him in their team badly
I have one recommendation for David, stay I little closer to the near post cuz that’s ur only problem with free kicks u cant reach that far. And remember your still my favorite on Man U’s team!
How is ward prowse not playing for a top team in the prem?
Ole has found his Ole now. Cavani is deadly at the end of the matches.
SOU 2 - MU 0 Solskjaer: There goes mi job! Cavani: Hold my Gatorade. SOU 2 - MU 3
Feed the center forwatd Carvani and he scores. United's wall did not do the job.
We were 2 goals behind when I woke up at 7 AM. “Should I go back to sleep?” “No! My boys will fight their way back!” I’m very glad that I didn’t go back to sleep. 😍
Rashford MAD OVERRATED..
Thank you, No.4 of Southampton, you gave Cavani a nice header in your position.
Poor De Gea, his glorious time is gone.
Lol first hour
8:25 it's pretty funny to watch all the defenders' hands go up for offside, and simultaneously they see Vestergaard standing with the goalkeeper and their hands move to their heads, like "oh I wasn't saying offside, I was just lamenting ..."
Cavani ❤️❤️🇺🇾🇺🇾
Cavinidana
Time to buy Cavani for my FM2021!!!
Cavani > Martial
Tf why is nobody talking about cavani
3:41 who the heck is David DeGayuh? He says it repeatedly, pretty sure his job entails knowing how to pronounce the names of players reasonably well.
Ole, ole, ole, ole... Edi! Edi! 🇺🇾❤👏 Cherish him Man U fans. He's pure class!
Stop playing Rashford and Martial as striker and use Cavani who is actually a striker. D Gea had a tough game today.
Cavani has already done more with the 7 on his back than Sanchez did his whole Man U career lmao
greenwood is becoming like salah, greedy and wasteful, and 6:52 rash should just try to learn to pass the ball, if only he was that good as dimaria for cavani he would score more
Cavani shows how to do the job of a goal scorer
Rashford should of squared that ball to Cavani
I guess Pogba is the new bench captain 2 games without him 2 victories. Love to see man u winning without questionable penalties
Fergie time!
Man U Give more time cavani  to play
Heads-It-In Cavani.............Aight Ima Head out
Finally, a game for united without the useless handycap  Martial
PSG gave up on Cavani too easily, such a quality player
Who else loves Cavani's celebration 🥶 🏹🎯
Can't hate Cavani man he proven his experience and poacher skills!
Nice to see Cavani chipping in with the goals. Now he has more PL goals than Rashford, Martial, and Greenwood combined.   Martial and Greenwood need to step it up
I think what united really need is half of their fans sold .  Cavani is the real deal, anyone who has been watching knows, but you guys will turn on him soon enough like i see happening with martial
No one:  That one commenter:  Edit: Thanks for all the likes
I swear I saw a video yesterday that predicted the 3-2 win.
I've been watching more football other than Liverpool, and the two players that need to start are Rodrigo for Leeds and Cavani for man u. Idk what these managers are thinking by subbing them on so late, but they are stupid!!
Can anyone tell me how @4:31 we didn’t score  🤦🏽‍♂️  We need a pure striker like halland cavani is a great super sub and a great poacher that we need all our attackers are selfish Greenwood is a great striker but as a winger he always wants to score instead of giving the driven pass in the box
Cavani was in top form
Cavani deserves to start, he has the finishing that the team needs
Great goal for Edison cavanni. 🇺🇾❤
GOD-vani
Cavani needs to open a school for strikers and center forwards tutorials & major clubs needs to have their strikers on mandatory attendance.
I been saying this since before psg even thought of selling him, why let cavani go?!?????
Cavan I going break the number 7 for Man U
This guy deserves the number 7  Respect ✊
United fans already bashing Martial and hyping up Retired fake Tarzan
The dean Henderson effect
That cavani third goal was handball
as they say, a 2-0 halftime lead is the most dangerous...
😇comeback
Just came to check whether Man U was given penalty again
I think that Dean Henderson did a great job, even though he did not get tested to much. But I would start him over de gea. Still no disrespect to de gea.
Edison cavani is the only reason Manchester United won 1 assist 2 goals 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
We love seeing the older players PSG and the “farmers” league like Silva and Cavani being literal saving graces to these huge Prem teams lol
EL MATADOR!!
Martial has been bad so far but Rashford has also been bad n yet no one talks about him🤷‍♂️ I’d still start cavani as st over both
6:49 why rashford did not square the ball to cavani is beyond my comprehension...
Only here for cavani the rest of the team mate sucks
I have to confess. I was wrong for misjudging him when we signed him off his couch. Absolute nightmare for defenders because he's always moving.
Cavani was great
Southampton literally had to transform after that humiliation by Leicester.
Bruno Fernandez vs Southampton
Cavani bringing back the essence of Man U in this one 👍
Cavani real deal
Loan out greenwood, place the right side for rashford, and centre to cavani. They will win the league
me and my dad were watching the game and he was so mad at halftime but el matador to the rescue
Man United made a comeback without scoring penality. That's impressive
Cavani > Martial
I am always happy for cavani cus coming to ManU is like therapy to him.
Cabana is better than Messi
David dega
Let's goo!! 🔥🔥
I’m just here for Cavani and JWP both were impressive ✅
Cavani had an amazing game passing wise aswell
Man United defense Sucks
Man Utd should’ve been 2-0 up after 15 mins
And people actually doubted Cavani
This defense and Martial and Rashford playing average every other game will get us a mid table finish. We had way too many chances this game.
This is called ST。M U ‘s young guys Have a lesson pls。
Where the heck is Anthony Martial???
This long hair goalscoring guy reminds me of Van Nistelrooy. Simple, classic beauty !
It's really good to see Bruno Fernandes not scoring off a penalties for once and Cavini making an impact
kelas
Funny to see United settle for mediocracy like this
Just keep the same formation and players we had when we played instanbul
Cavani sent a clear massage to the coach
If cavani doesn’t get more time on the field, ole is an idiot.
Now they must  know who to start in upcoming games ❤️
And I thought the Everton-Leeds game was the game of the week.
After this summer we should sell Pogba  and Maguire they arent good
What a come back win!
Cavani bruno fred and Van de beek is the answer mates. GGMU the best team in England
Classic Fergie Time. Come on United, get in there my son. 🎉 🎊
Cavani is still a legend
So Happy for Edson Cavani. Not so much for Man U
Bruno Fernandes and Manchester United are overrated
I love that Cavani's celebration has changed slightly. I love the Archer move!
Glory glory Man Utd
Man United are so good
this reminds me of good old day Fergie times.
Is anybody else kinda weirded out by the stadium track in the background? It literally syncs with every motion of the game (foul, when the ball comes close to goal, when a goal is scored, the team song after the goal). It's amazing but it's almost like they don't need the people in the stands seeing as they have the associated sounds playing in the background. Thoughts?
ohhhhh edison cavaniiiiiii, ohhh edison cavaniii 🗣
I just want to see Cavani win!!! Love his energy much needed in this team.. Cannot WAIT till we have thousands of fans there to celebrate with him
Voice crack 9:34
Deserved win for united, considering the open chances they have missed. Thank you for the wonderful highlights
First, Ole out! Next, United back! ManU fans 😆
That will be sweet revenge for Cavani if he scores against PSG next week  😁
And OGS is gonna still not gonna start Donnie and Cavani cause they arent the players he wanted
This could be a early contender for PL match of the year  Lmao I may have jumped through a hoop but I didn’t say it was match of the season but I merely said a early contender or candidate
If only Man utd can be consistent with these kinds of wins 😔😔
Huge, HUGE win
Cavani showing the team how to properly place a header in the tightest of conditions.
Safe to say, we all know who is the MOTM
Cavani carried us
UT haft to thank PSG lol for C
anyone just wait wait for them to post the highlights after the game
Cavani showing you he is still a top striker.
It’s great having a proper number 9 up front isn’t it. I like martial but don’t think he has the goal scoring instinct that Cavani has.
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
Cavani with 2 nice headers. WOW 💖💖💖😍😍😍
I stoped watching the game when southhampton scored the second goal, I couldn’t believe we won this game.... anyone happy with the win???
Cavani and Rashford are such a great combo to have up front. They move around, confuse and tire out the defenders having to chase them.
this was one that you win by hardwork. Cavani was outstanding
Class Act Cavani 👏
Gotta feel for Cavani, he could’ve had a Hat-trick if Rashford played him. But it was a good match 🙌
GLORY GLORY
Man u always plays well when Their manager is about to get sacked
yes
Those goals by Southampton were impossible to save
MUT come back 😳💪💪💪
What a comeback GG man utd Who needs Sancho when they have Cavani, the next me
Cavani shows the importance of a natural center forward in the current United line-up. Rashford, Martial and Greenwood are good shooters and dribblers but they lack finishing instinct and the willingness to tangle with opposing center backs. Seems Ole is still undecided about whether they should be fixated as wingers.
This game showed United need the striker who move around the pitch. Unfortunately Martial and Greenwood are not the type of player United need at this moment.
Get tim howard off of tv
What was roy kean saying?
What took so long to upload 😂
Southampton deserved the L, after halftime they started playing like Sheffield... They didn't know if they wanted to keep pressing or muscle out the rest of the match until it was too late Love to see Cavani scoring though no matter what team he plays for I can't hate Cavani
3:40 david de what now
Cavani Better than Martial
This game just shows van de beek should start and that cavani should start/get more playing time. Defense will always be shaky cuz of who we have, but attacking looked way better with van de beek-Bruno combo
we finally have a true number 9. we haven’t had one in many years.
I checked the score in the 70th minute and was happy to see Man U losing. Then I checked the score after the game... credit to them for a great comeback tho.
Cavani
Anyone else notice how massive vestergaards hands are
Where are the haters now? 😂 win our game in hand and we'll be back in the top 4. GGMU💪🏾🔥
Cavani has the poacher's instinct. Classic United
Man United have never won their 1st four away games in the Premier League...until now 👏👏🙌👍🔥🔥🔥
Empire strikes back
A free agent 54 days ago.. Not bad!
Where are all the Chelsea and Arsenal fans, who said Cavani came for the money? Meanwhile, Werner and Aubameyang are milking that 275k a week, just to play hide and seek.
Cavani > martial 🤷🏻‍♂️
Where’s pogba?
Psg punching the air right now.
What a comeback
UnITeD cAN OnLy SCoRe WItH peNaLtiES
Cavani bailed Ole out, cause i guarantee had they lost. He was definitely going to get sacked
If anyone has cavani on fpl😂😂
This is your ticket for watching within the first hour!
Cavani Should be starting
United
