I love the song where i can find it ?
Wasn't planning on crying today
@0:51  parol scene
This reminds me of this Titanic Story I am writing which is about these two ten year old cousins who sailed on the Titanic and Survived the nightmare of the shipwreck with their own courage and witts and their broken friendship but with great cost obviously meaning their families from their parents and older siblings did not survive and the sinking of the Titanic brings the two cousins relationship more closer and helps them reconsile.
I love this song it is so beautiful
🥺🥺🥺
Scary but videos sbou stpedad is amazing ❤️
This is like the sequel of the last advert ngl

You are always great Disney no matter what. Merry Christmas Disney! 😊🎁🎁🎁🎄🎄🎄
Congratulations! Wonderful!
I was part of this Disney Advert and I played the boy with the glasses (Max)
I guess this is a Filipino inspired film 😊
What’s the name of the song playing?
So cute 😢
This song literally made my eyes water in a sweet way!
1 year pass already ❤   My  favourite song, to put my baby to bed 🥰❤  November 2- 2023......  we move again by God's grace 😊

Старший брат такой внимательный❤❤❤
How darlin!
Tears...tears everywhere! So beautiful! And the song! Wow. I'm sad this is the final chapter but thank you for delivering it with such brilliance and magic.
Beautiful song…💖
I need more of these
it makes me CRY SO MUCH😢😢😢😭😭😭
According to advertising companies, there are no more White people in the UK.
So emotional and incredible 🥺🥰
they might do new ads if they really wanted to to freshen things up
Can't believe this is the finale of the trilogy.  I still remember being so moved by the first ad after the nightmare that was 2020.  So grateful these are a thing.  Thank you disney.
Box tick
The origin story of La Creatura.
♥️
This piece of song is powerful and emotional to some
Прикольно
I wish this became a movie series
💖💖💖💗
Just make this a series...love the videos
¿porque Disney no puede hacer una buena película como este comercial? Tantos trabajadores y a todos se les ocurre las mismas ideas clichés. No hay que ser muy profesional para crear una historia decente. Un niño de cinco años crea mejores cuentos que los de Disney, ahora solo repiten todo. Pero esto dejó de ser un sueño, y se volvió un amor al dinero. No sé, solo es mi opinión personal.
Didn't even realise that was Jessica Darrow singing! 😱🥰🎄 Hopefully Encanto was the start of many great things for her. 💜
Why can't we just have one advert that isn't mixed race? Just one? Only 7 percent of UK couples are mixed race. 7. You'd be excused for thinking 100 percent of couples are mixed race going by the adverts.
Beautiful song! Soul soothing...fall asleep so peacefully with this song💖
Disney really has become pure poison.
Did anyone see Oswald Lucky rabbit in the window!? 😃
This can’t be the last one Disney, make more of these please!
I can't wait for next year to hear a new song from Disney 😍
LOL
Wow, that baby is so ugly. 😂 I feel sorry for the poor older kids that will now be forgotten in favour of the baby. Glad I never had a younger sibling, but damn are older siblings a blessing. 😅
oh disney you never disappoints
It makes me cry When the baby is cute!
I need this as a show
The name of this Music….???  Please
Disney always in my heart. Full of emotions. Thank you Disney!!❤
Parol
Wow, very beautiful family.
This animation should definitely be made into a full length version!  adventure, action aside, I really like feeling the peace and family warmth in Disney movies. 🎆🏰💟
Christian !
Дисней на последок решили поспекулировать традиционными ценностями) перед тем как добавить в свои мультики 50% ЛГБТ персонажей😏 Лицемеры
Wow 😍😍😍
Cute!
The Best and Most Awaiting Festival of the Year it's Christmas!!!!!!  Only Jesus is the Reason for the season
0:21 here is Oswald 🛐✨✨✨
I’ll miss these
okay. But like, that brother is the number 1 brother of the year! He was a pro handling that situation!👏
Nice demographics, you hoping to move to africa permanently?
✨♥️
Is this the sequel to the stepdad short?
❤️
Very organic comment section, Disney...
w0ke
0:20 ...wait... is that Oswald!?
Disney delivers more emotion, thought and power in this 2 minute ad than it most of its recent feature films.
My do I always cry from this 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
😢It's Beautiful😢
Fair haired dog. What a racist ad. Plenty of black and brown dogs in the world, why a blonde dog?
Great News!  Fourth-quarter results revealed Disney’s streaming services, including Disney+ and Hulu, lost a staggering $1.5 billion. Why? Today's woke Disney is like a fleet of innocent-looking ice cream trucks driven by child predators or pedophiles.
This reminds me of this Titanic Story I am writing  which is about these two ten year old cousins who sailed on the Titanic and Survived the nightmare of the shipwreck with their own courage and witts and their broken friendship but with great cost obviously meaning their families from their parents and older siblings did not survive and the sinking of the Titanic brings the two cousins relationship more closer.
I love this animation! I have been dreaming of being an animator when i was just young😊
The beginning is cute. When Ella dressed as Elsa and skating on the ice
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Why are all commercials interacial nowadays?! This isnt a pornhub advert:/
I wonder why they left out the part afterwards where she pays the toll
Could do without the racial propaganda.
Just a reminder, the UK is 85% white, and however much you wish otherwise, we aren't going anywhere.  #thegreatreplacement #wewereneverasked #groomers
5.5 million views and 2k likes…. They are risking so much money and so much of their company to please 3% of the population..: you have lost so many customers after this. Go woke go broke
More interracial propaganda. .  just fuckoff
What a pile of woke shite!
Burgers?
I love this Blasian family ❤️❤️❤️
White people like and buy Disney too but apparently we are a minority to Disney nowadays. 😢
I can't wait the next chapter of the next year it's Always Magic 😻
왜이렇게 눈물이 나냐
Disney trying to capitalise peoples emotions:
Why isn’t the Father Filipino tho 😒😒🤦🏻‍♂️
Ah love it
I love this! Beautiful story!🥺
This really made me cry 😭 a lot
There are no white people in England.
such a wonderful song😍I really love it.........can I get a lyrics please
Hello everyone i like this advert!
actually crying because this is the first time I’m seeing Disney animate us Filipinos.  Never seen someone actually look like me, not being represented online, but this- this is amazing.  I’m so happy as to how far we’ve come.
I’m crying. This advert is absolutely beautiful!
I think it must be that time of the month already for me as a woman because I’m crying so much this is so beautiful so sad all at the same time I love this Disney advert
oh my god it's november cant u just wait
😟💘😿
Of course it’s a black family
Suspicious pancakes
"LITTLE MICKEY" + "PAROLE" always and forever... such a beautiful advert.
This came on with the smyths toys superstores Ad on YouTube last night
So beautiful ❤
family
actually crying because this is the first time I’m seeing Disney animate us Filipinos.  Never seen someone actually look like me, not being represented online, but this- this is amazing.  I’m so happy as to how far we’ve come.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents keep their babies' cribs free of anything that might block their breathing (e.g., blankets, pillows, quilts, comforters, stuffed animals) for at least the first 12 months.  Simply put, social learning theory is the idea that children learn from observing others.   Sort it out Disney
Ok i'll admit it, even is this is a spot, is amazing, Disney know how to touch people fr.
Disney always know how to create the best Christmas adverts - so heartwarming and just what we need at this time!
Another interracial couple? You would think this was common in the real world, its not. I wonder why every company feels the need to push this as an idea?
What is this song guys
So cute 🥺
What a beautiful advert. This made me cry tears of joy, you never cease to amaze me with these adverts. Well done Disney!
I cried watching this for the first time and I thought my worries are gone and that the holiday spirit came back into my life. bless your heart, Disney!
Nice multicultural family.
Very British Problems: what colour shall mother, father and grandmother be… let’s discuss in Parliament.
This is the best Xmas ad so far.  Sainsbury's is the worst!
What is the name of the song and who sings it 😊
This song is incredible!! So proud of the song writing team on this!!!
Hey, Disney, I am still waiting for The Orville season 4 anouncement. But do not woke it up please.
Perfect ❤️
is this sung by luisa from encanto?
I want lyrics pleassssss
Lovely advert 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
Is the family Half-Filipino? Because they showed the mother tearing a paper x-mas star (parol) which is exclusive to filipino... especially with the design shown.
So cool
It's cool that almost in every scene there is a Disney easter egg 😊
The first one with the lola is still my favorite but love that they're continuing this story.  Disney please sell parols!
Such a beautiful advert. I love it when each Disney Xmas ad has a Mickey Mouse toy 🧸, and the song featured is the perfect fit for this year’s holiday season! Great to hear Jessica Sarrow (encanto) sing this song.
So much representation, more than my heart can take! On our way to diversity city 2022!!!!
After a year of ructions over Roe vs Wade... here we have it... babies, a blessing, not a curse.
🎁🤰🏻 Beautiful advert Well done Disney
This is beautiful especially how it helps Nicole through the process of excepting a new addition to her family the song is a prefect choice
Love this. Well done Disney bringing the Christmas feels 🥹🧡👏🏻🎄
Love this story 🎄 starting to get the Christmas feels 🥰
Disney Christmas ads always makes me cry just beautiful
A sequel to the stepdad and it shows some things can grow better even without being left alone.
Beautiful in everyway! 💗
Happy birthday Mickey mouse?🍁
Beautiful! I get me every year with your commercials 🥺❤️ I knew, I would cry! 😄
Aaawwww, felt that little girl’s anguish 😢
Ah yes propaganda for children my favourite
Coming this Christmas - Disney's Jesus
❤️❤️
THANK YOU DISNEY. YOU NEVER CEASE TO TOUCH MY HEART AND MAKE ME CRY AND SHED TEARS OF JOY
Love
first ad with the old white wife and black husband combo (tick)  *yeh just to clarify. when a mix race couple appears in these ad's especially xmas the male is nearly always black.....
What a happy family 👍
Every year Disney manages to make everyone cry watching these little stories.. Thank you
Boxes ticked. Bosh
Suprise surprise a non white family in an advert
Eyyy this made me cry! Spotted 🇵🇭 elements are here again (the parols)! Salamat Disney! 🎄🌟💙❤️💛🤍
Boring advert but very nice song
Nothing special.
just waiting for the racist comments
As a white person I do not feel that Disney represents me anymore.
🥺🥰
I love Christmas advertsss 🥺
I’m starting to think Disney hate white people. They even used a clip of the flop ‘Lightyear’.
I'm not crying you are
Where’s the Disney characters? I must have been watching the wrong ad
When is Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers movie and all of this year's titles on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc, Disney UK?
🤢
That made me cry
I love how this is a carry on from the family in the advert last year🥹
no white people ?
So white people are pushed aside everywhere, black people in movies, Music, everywhere, racist ad!
so nice i am literally crying right now
Too many white characters
Very nice ad
0:54 The films on the TV is Lightyear
Is that Luisa Madrigal singing?
Nice Video 📷 And Good Job👍 Nice Family Culture. Comment 👩 From Philippines 🇵🇭
