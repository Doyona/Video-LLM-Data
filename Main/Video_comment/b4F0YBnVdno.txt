Bro tyson really should have retired
The way Ngannou started sizing up Fury as soon as he came close to him.😂
Finally they fought and fury lost
Aged well
It's so amazing this fight happened. While we didn't get the hybrid rules, it was still special. I think Tyson Fury should get credit for doing this call out though. It takes two.
Whos here after fury got knocked down? By the guy he underestimated? Francis Ngannou🤣
We do now know that’s Francis nganou is the baddest mother f*icier in this planet 🌎 😮
Hmmm a bit sus how the interviewer said mike Tyson at the end fast forward to now and who's helping with Francis training yep mike tyson 😂😂
I love this Guy fury
And now they gonna  fight 😂😂
boxing and then mma
Skills vs power
Wilder and whyte are garbage fighters… I love futu too but he ain’t no Ali… until he fight another skilled fighter. NGannou isn’t a boxer but he has a punchers chance.. and if he doesn’t stand still like a punching bag I can see things happening
Have you got a big corey lmao 😂 . He went straight to the BBC question 😂 .
I like ferry his so polite talking no f.. word n very smart too respect
A very humorous and respectful fighter Fury is. You gotta love him!
Fury has trained with Tom Aspinal in the past on a few different occasions and is talking about bringing him in for this camp.
Nganou is 190 cm but Tyson is 205cm and if we look to shoulders nganou is taller
either fancis isnt 6'4 or tyson isnt 6'9...
Fury is a warrior, without fighting he cannot survive mentally
Now look 👀👀
Fighting the man whom the whole world wants you to fight❌ Fighting someone in their 1st boxing match✅
Fracice est super
Who's, Nutts Are Bigger: FURY OR NGANNOU. THINK: NGANNOU; WINS IN BOTH: BOXING & UFC. BUT, HURTING: RIGHT SHOULDER, NECK, & RIGHT KNEE.
3:12 it’s legendary 😂😂
Francis Ngannou ... i think is more than 6.4 height
That looks and reaction on Francis's face at the 3:11 mark as Fury Jokes with him LMAO 🤣 SMH TYSONS. Funny fkr ,dude was like WTF REALLY
how is Tyson Fury 6'9" and Francis is 6'4" ?  Standing next to each other it's time to question any and everything Cheat Fury says and does.  LOL
Tyson Fury Vs Francis Ngannou would be a blockbuster match 👏👏👏👏
You only a legend when you fight usyk or Joshua, you ain’t no Floyd man, this is not the time to stop and announce some exhibition fights.. fury talk a lot but he knows
I love Ngannou and hate Fury, but there’s NO way Francis is gonna beat a real technical boxer like Fury. He already survived the HARDEST puncher in history Deontay Wilder three times.
ah Francis l'anglais aussi puis la rage de le dosser big what l'esprit du cam. neglige aucun détails de mimba  sleep well.
Fury is going to get knocked out
Tyson doesnt stand no chance in hell in a MMA fight against francis 😂
Francis is nails wouldn't be surprised if he clipped him hard
LMAO 😂 someones lying about their height ...Tyson fury says hes 6'9 and Francis says hes 6'4. There was NOT 5 inches in that size up. Maybe 0.5 an inch.
Tyson is a legend, also sorry Francis
Mike Tyson😂😂
Enough body shots and Franky will start dropping his hands.Then its lights out
easy payday for Fury, cant blame him
This will be huge
Francis Ngannou  doesn't know what is about to hit him. We stand with you in prayers bro. Courage 💪💪 Fury is such a legend, I love his brilliant skills
Fury: "This is gonna be a very special fight like never before!"  I'm gonna lose it if they reveal they both be battling in a singing contest judged by Simon Cowell.
Big Cory 😂...ofcourse BBC
He said Mike Tyson 🤣🤣 3:54
Have you got a big Corey?!? A big what? A big Corey!!! Reporter: will we see it in the octagon or the ring 😅😅😅
Hehehe what a bunch of savages
Good luck to them. they're both Great fighter and Good persons too.
Fury will dance around the ring and both will be paid very well. Francis makes more in this fight than he did in his ufc career. Both will take no damage. Very smart move. Fury will face usyk wilder can have a shot at usyk too. Wilder could beat usyk and fury 4th fight
After seeing these side by side, I am pretty sure there isn’t a 5 inch height gap 😅
And I'm here because that fight between them is official now lol.
this would be an interesting fight
The comments are gonna change in a year ayy just cuz of eddie hearns spam.
Finally happening. Ngannou secured the bag. Hold that Dana lmao!!
Yes but if its boxing rules surely they are taking away 50% of the MMA fighters arsenal.
finally, 10*28*2023
Well it's happening
...that Fury is done,he's voice coming from hard,he's like a old man around 65 years,he's eat by alcohol and drugs,no any chance for the next fight. Ngannou's happy for good money in the even a match with Fury,those people from UFC doesn't have any more brains...they get it easy anything fight...like a zombies.
Fury feel's like a reporter and reporter feel's like a fighter...??? they still not signed the contract...it's not happen,you will see,Fury will inventing any reason,he's skill for ducking.
6'4 vs 6'9 right there folks 🤣
Ngannou is not Wilder & Wilder is not Ngannou & Francis boxed before MMA Wilder was Predictable the new Wilder will beat Fury
Tyson is scared its obviously.  Hes trying to be friendly and francis is just not having it . Hes serious . Thats why jon and tyson want to fight each other . They both dont wanna face  Ngannou
Fury : you got a big dick?   Francis: You will see on the ring
Fury: Have you got a big Corey? Ngannou: Wait a min broda let me get my dictionary out.  Ngannou: What is Corey broda.  Fury looks down.  Ngannou:  Oh I get it, 😂😂😂
Either Tyson is not 6’9 - 6’10 or Francis is not 6’4
man Tyson Fury looks bigger than Francis to me.
Ngannou kills fury.
Ngannou may be strong but a true boxer can see that coming a mile away Bob n weeve through all of that
Hahaha ngannou really2 believe that shit
He got played
Ngannou 6’4 fury 6’9 one of them lying about they height
Hit the like button if you heard the commentator say " Mike Tyson "😅
2:51 look at Francis sizing up Tyson 😂 he definitely got intimidated by Tyson.  Tyson by 7th round ko/tko
Where’s Francis now guys
Approximately a year later and Francis is still unemployed with Zero fights line up, lol
I’m sorry but no one is surviving a punch from Tyson in a mma glove
it's obvious fury is 6'7 at best, 6'9 my ass ..barely taller than 6'4 francis
This fight needs to happen ASAP. Tyson vs Francis
Jon bones Jones is the baddest fighter in the world he would beat up both  in a real fight MMA
Tyson is big man, he will destroy Ngannou
Tyson Fury IS not a racist am sure
Keep your word. Fight nganou
plot twist : ngannou pull out a big corey anderson from his pants
Big what? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fury- Francis do U have a big dick?  Francis- u gay asf
Francis 6'9?
To be fair they should face each other in a kick boxing match. Fury can surely learn some in 6 months.
Fury normally he would have 3 belts sorry for my English
Lol, Francis is fucking huge
Imagine this fight. MAKE IT HAPPEN
Давайте бой!👍
I like the old Tyson Fury who talked about how drinking ruins lives, and who had wholesome talk, not into this Tyson who claims to represent " Jesus" but talks about going out and getting drunk all night and then asks a black man if he has a " big Cory" definitely not someone I consider a representative of Jesus Christ sorry not sorry
Haha Fury at the end acting like Mike Tyson :D
Tayson tears it to pieces. Black pear
Francis to be outboxed by Fury easier than all Fury's fights. Francis has no stamina to fight more than 3 rounds, lmao.
nganou will knock him out
"This is not ballet dancing, it's heavyweight boxing"
Accent issue
I am the greatest of all time I shook up the world ☺
Let s go
Francisco Nagano
There’s still seats wide open too that’s crazy😮 that place is huge
All I wanna know is how is francis ngannou 6'4 and fury is 6'9
Fury won't last w second with these mma fick yall talking about
Mike Tyson? Huh! Ugh! Tyson Fury!
Wait one is built 6ft4 the other 6ft9
Fury would put him to sleep
عملاقان
There's no way Fury is 5 inches taller then Ngannou
Tyson Fury and Francis Nganno are really nice. As a Cameroonian, I know Ngannou can never beat Fury, but this match can change Ngannou's life...
Francis is a bum with no sense of humor or class can’t help but curse
ngannou 193cm, tyson fury 206 cm, the math does not add up man
lmaooo Whenever its a black dude Tyson always says "I bet youve got a big cock" everytime lmao.
Why would Ngannou sign a restrictive contract with the UFC when he can fight Tyson Fury and make over $20 million ?
Tyson is dwarfing Francis
A true gentleman
Nur noch lächerlich,der Trunkenbold... USYK ist der wahre Champion!
So fury is 6’9” and ngannou is 6’4” ???
"You will sleep" - Francis
Tyson losing if it’s in a cage but in the ring it’s wraps for Francis so just depends really. Each the best at their respected arts
No way is Fury 6’9 and Francis 6’4 they seem a lot closer in height than that. I do not see a 5 inch difference in height
If i got hit by Deontay Wilder and lived id be pretty confident too lol. This dudes great, and even though hes probably gonna mop the floor with ngannou, francis will be able to put his grandkids grandkids through ivy league schools
Tyson Fury is just 6'7", not 6'9."
-"You have a big Corey?" *Demonstrates* - 😟
Im happy that francis will earn good $ that he deserves. Heck maybe he switches sports. He deserves much more than what ufc offers. I wish pride fc japan was still on as it used to. They really knew how to treat the sport and fighters.
I like how Tyson and his dad say "Big Francis Ngannau". "Look at the muscles on him"
I call bs on fury being 6’9
Did he call him Mike Tyson 😂🤣
Dude bout to destroy Francis worse than Wilder..
Ngannou gassing out on 5 MMA Round, I can't see him go the distance with Fury. If nothing happened in 5 rounds, definitely a KO or TKO win for Fury.
Francis was like cmon get that gay shit outta here😂😂
Fury is 6’9 and francis is 6’4 and They look the same height
If wilder can land on fury, with a solid camp behind francis imagine if he lands one on fury, it’s a big risk for mma but even bigger risk for boxing, you can’t compare McGregor and mayweather to what this fight might be, heavyweights are so unpredictable all it takes is one shot.
Who the hell does Francis think he is? Never have I seen a mans ego inflate so quickly.  It's a shame because he had potential but now he will become forgettable.
Francis left UFC, make it happen!
top rank please, can we make it happen now?
Francis vs Fury with MMA gloves but boxing!
FURY WANTED TO SEE THAT BBC
Lol NGannou trying to sound mean, while we all know that he is really polite and a humble guy.
Can't wait to see you that fight. Francis is going to start making some serious money outside of the UFC I think
Francis looks tiny next to him
crazy how big tyson looks compared to francis
WHO HERE AFTER FRANCIS GOT RELEASED 😂😂😂 HE THE NEXT MIKE TYSON😂
Did he call him Mike Tyson at very end? 🤣30 years late
Fury and Ngannou Energy Connected hope they Share the Ring
Fury def noticed when Francis stepped into ring... They both looked nervous to eachother a bit lol 😂🤣
I love Tyson fury he isn't ducking everyone he wanna fight everybody when they're still in prime
Francis needs to land just one punch. Its like getting rammed by a speeding truck.
What a cool guy Tyson is...
Francis is gonna destroy that guy...
he know damn well it wont be in the cage
Fury such a good man. He is making Francis richer.
Lennox  Lewis ,,, would b top 3
I feel like Dana will do everything in his power to make sure that fight doesn’t happen lol
become a legend.... Two titledefences? hahahahahahaha im dying 😂🤣😅 please i ned cpr
Ngannou is awesome but if it’s in a boxing ring with UFC gloves he is getting knocked out.  Fury has some old school old world circus strongman aura around him.  He is invincible currently and impossible to knock out.  Love the sportsmanship and mutual respect between the two though.
Tyson Fury ist der sympathischste Typ im Kampfsport Geschäft,und darüber hinaus, großen Respekt für deine ehrliche Art
Sign the contract big boy sign the contract 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Francis will tier out in 3rd round
Y’all stop jinxing Tyson fury. Y’all better be knocking on wood right now
Ok Not Boxing Not MMA But What About Kickboxing.........
how bigs the cory tho ?
Have you got a big corey? Lol  Cameroonians are built different
Fury will win but im glad Francis will be paid
You duck Joshua to fight a monster ....either way you will fight a real fighter for the belt
Zero chance nganou is just 6’4”
When os this happening man?
ngannou is too strong
don't underestimate ngannou, hes not wilder he has boxing skill not just power.
Even the feather-fisted Fury will knock Ngannou senseless and put him in a wheelchair if they do a proper boxing contest. You don't mess around with heavyweight boxers. And if they don't fight properly, what is the point, it will just be a money making exercise.
The interviewer said Mike Tyson 😂
I’m glad Tyson fury got hisself together, his talent and personality is something we couldn’t let pass us by, he seem like such a amazing person, just let some demons come along to try to destroy him
ngannou is more intimidating when he silent
Why is this channel such shit
It’s gonna be a fight to remember
I thought Ngannou was huge but he looks small standing beside Tyson Fury. Oh My!
with all respect whos Dillian Whyte? is there anybody out there serious left, who can chalange Tyson?
2:56
Fury loves a bbc
I hope it's going to be a Mma  fight  Instead of a boxing fight Would be way more interesting
He's so polite   True legend
If Fury and Ngannou DID fight, the small gloves would certainly make it more interesting. Less shield for Fury to hide behind, but also, more capabilities for dirty boxing, with Fury is great at.
Shit was a disgrace to boxing. I’m sure Whyte was incentivized by some of Fury’s associates to go down in the 6th round. The round Tommy Fury so emphatically predicted it wouldn’t go past🤔. Would love to see the betting slips of those in Fury’s camp.
Wtf?! It always shows that francis is 6 ft 4 that is 1.93cm and tyson fury is 2.06cm, why is francis almost so big as tyson? Ufc lies mannn!!
Francis is not 6'4 💀 he's 6'8 at least
OK...Francis is definitely not 6ft 4
Noticed how Francis looked at him/sized him up. Probably was thinking damn bro taller than i thought.
He won't  fight usyk, Joshua or Ruiz haha says a lot really, definitely not the best of this era.
Boxing rules Tyson Fury MMA rules: Ngannou  Just like what happened to Mayweather and McGregor fight
Francis Nganu walnij go w ten cygański łysy łeb.👌👍😅
They should do kickboxing so it’s half way between mma and boxing
Boxers are jokers they will never dare to challenge any fight in MMA with an MMA fighter . But always an mma fighter would steps in their boxing ring.
Would love to see this 😂😂 we needs this bad wilder let us down
Rooting for wakanda  forever! And surely he will shock the world again!
Dear Tyson, Please I want you to fight ten more matches and win all 10. ❤️🙏
You got a big tory? What did he say to Francis? Wtf is a tory.
Tyson Fury about to get knocked tf out
eh I didn't realise Mike Tyson was in that interview. He must be hanging with John Cena these days
Francis ungannou is only 6'4.....BULLSHIT he's easily over 6'6 atleast
A hybrid fight? That is fook'n stupid. They should sign a contract that each fights the other at their respective sport. Which style first is up to a coin toss. Hybrid fight...Lmfao!
Fury wins that as well.
Tyson fury is 6 9 he's gonna win
Isn’t Fury like 6’9? I thought he would be more taller than Francis
Then tyson should try out kickboxing also with francis
i hope he fights the winner of aj and usyk
how the fuck is francis as big as fury ?
Africa wants the fight tyson fury vs francis 🇳🇬💥🇳🇬🔥🇳🇬💯🇳🇬🦀🇳🇬
Thank you fury for giving our African brother a chance
Francis looked like he had pop't to the shops.
It's kinda funny cause every time someone says a boxer vs an mma fighter you expect the boxer to be black and the mma guy to be white but here it's quite the opposite 😂🤣
Francis is listed at 193cm and Tyson is 206cm but there doesn't seem to be any difference here.
💪💪💪💪💪💪 uganda dandala 32gb
tyson said he is retired and wants to fight Ngannou with mma gloves? he better stay retired because Ngannou may give him brain damage.
Have you got a big Corey
Aw man Francis vs Tyson will be way bigger than McGregor vs Mayweather. Plz world make it happen. Who else is with me!?
hah hah it will be the first real fight he has ever had , and he will get his ass kicked
Why cant he join ufc instead
I can’t believe the announcer says “that is no small thing you just saw out there” after Fury makes fun of this guy’s man-gina
called him mike tyson hrhr
He thought Fury asked him if he has a big D. LOL
Big Whatt ??
Can you imagine the SOUNDS of these two monsters boxing and hitting each other?!  Thunderclap of the gods!!
Have you got a big corey 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wld still want to see it
It’s gta be called a hexagon. With Mma gloves. And fury vs ngannu. 12r. Each 3 mins. End game. Let’s go.
Tyson has this affect the makes his opponents love and hate him at the same time😆
Fury didn’t call out Ngannou 😆 these are thee most humble real fighters who show pure respect to the sport(s) and their competitors. This was excitement from Fury! He basically saying it will happen just doesn’t know when
Francis is probably one of the most powerful fighters ever on earth he’s got knock out punches from the hip doesn’t even need to swing back,this is why tyson respects him enough to want to challenge him because he feels he’s the only one that stands in his way as a top heavyweight champion.
GOAT!!
When was this? Recently?
Fury listed as 6'9.. Francis as 6'4....  We know sports league padding height.. but damn Fury went far on that
Tyson fury is not 6’9 , because Francis is 6’4. One of them is lying
Francis this is money hahahhahha
Francis is smart to want out of the UFC. More money in boxing and the UFC treats the majority of its fighters like shit.v
Let's Go Fk him up Ngannou!!! GOTTA TAKE THE THRONE BACK
Fury  not talented enough fighter  sad see heavyweight boxing go too the graveyard 🤣🤣🤣🤣✌
"Have ye got a big corey?" "Huh?"  Tyson had me rolling with laughter with that one catching the big man off guard
It's gonna be more of a boxing vs MMA fight
So cringeworthy
Fury Will Beat This Guy To A Pulp In Boxing Its Not Fair
I agree with Dana Francis has no businesses in boxing.
These two fighting will literally cement the greatest heavyweight fight of all time. Period. End of story.
good
nice
Francis has a punchers chance.
francis learned a new language
Nice cant wait dana just mad cause hes no getting a peice of the pie
Half the place is empty
Bet Tyson won't get in the octagon
the kindness is a facade for fear telling him he's handsome and asking if he has a big dck wtf
He said that word so funny
He sucks he lucky the heavyweight division is at its very worst.
Go into the octagon stop calling ufc fighters to the ring
How fury fighting in the UK he doesn't have a UK license.. Why because he is a U S.A citizen... Fury only retired because ,Daniel MTK MOB BOSS is on the run it's no coincidence it's facts...
Fury should of fight anthony joshua instead of that bum he hand picked. Fight was trash. Glad his gypsy @55 is done and out of boxing, tbh fury aint all that.
The greatest boxer of his time but I would prefer he box a boxer like Uysk or Joshua rather than a MMA fighter.
Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou should happen 💯 the best fighters should always fight each other 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 Word Heavyweight Champion MMA vs World Heavyweight Champion Boxer 😎 Amazing
*bring it on. fury vs nganno tables ladders and chairs in wwe. lol*
Peoples champions, theres only one tyson fury, enjoy retirement champ
The interviewer called Tyson fury Mike Tyson
Francis gonna kill him...
Man I love tyson for getting this brother paid he is a legend as a person and as a fighter
Fury just getting him paid I ain’t mad don’t embarrass the man tho
Wasn't the height difference at least 5 inches? But it doesn't seem like that here
Ngannou will lose in boxing
It’s just unfair how tall/big n over all body strength they got
3:14 👀 huh 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
This is the fight of all fights
Tyson fury can ko or tko nganoue in boxing ring.  But in mma ring tyson fury can not win over fransic
Both these guys are awesome.  Bc they arent always all fake mad.  But they know they can flip that switch
“Im wanna find out who da baddest muddafukka on da planet iz.”
cringe
Will this fight happen??
You are the real king wooow
Francis just needs to blitz fury. He isn’t winning a decision.
Legends both
Francis N is a Special 1 of a kind BEAST and he's super kind but Tyson Fury would absolutely Humble him no question
He hung out with Tyson at the after party. Tyson is super nice to Francis, he wants him to get paid
Did fury say he’s 170 lol
Francis Ngannou couldn't even defeat Cyril gane in hand combat, how could he even match up to the Gypsy King 👑 in boxing
"DO YOU GOT A BIG CORRY?"  *Points at Francis' groin*
haha that was the most alpha move of all time. Arm around one of the most feared men on the planet like he was an old chum in the pub haha.
I have tromendous respect for you Tyson Fury by Steve Irungu Jermaine
Tyson Fury is really big for 170 lbs 🤔?
Tyson to Francis have ya got a big Corey lmao
I say now fury need to fight usyk,that’s the only person I say have a good chance. Besides usyk I don’t see nobody beating fury,
Why not just start a go fund me account for Francis if that’s what this whole thing is all about? I’ll be glad to pay for these two to quit talking about doing something “different” that probably won’t be done again so Francis can go back to defending his belt and Tyson can enjoy his retirement.
Bare knuckle fight in maccies car park
I want to watch furry jassua game.
Fury is one of the coolest boxers ever.....he is an enrichment for the sport
If Francis catches him with that left uppercut like he did to allerstain Overeem. He's going to sleep. And I believe if he does. It's in the early rounds . After that it's down hill for Francis and uphill for fury
AJ and Usyk aren't decent fighters ? A damn shane to a boxing champion to call out an MMA fighter instead of fighting the best guys on his sport. Dillian Whyte is decent but Usyk and AJ aren't, wtf...  Fury's DUCKING!.......like they usually do.
How tall is Francis because he looks the same height if not taller than Tyson right there.
Ngannou is no McGregor for or even a paddy the baddy!!
Oh god lol that fight will be highly stupid
IMO beating wilder and whyte is not legendary status. Those guys are pure trash. I saw that upper cut before the fight. I was confused why people think this is a big fight.
What a lame calling out someone who’s not even a boxer typical huytes
did fury just say he is 170 pounds ? maybe kg now way he is 170
Fury is just above everyone else nowadays... I know for a fact he wouldn't past an mma round with Francis. Francis would do better in boxing than Fury would in MMA
Big what?
Love them both Tyson, Francis... God Cannot wait for this. I'm gonna be rooting for both of them
Coked out lol
Lessshgooo baby
”Big what?” Lol He should have said I’ve got the biggest African anaconda down there and I’ll smash you pretty face in with it if you dont act right.
SO MAYBE TYSON WANT TO BEAT ufc UC AND AFTER THAT BECOMING BOXING UCHAMP HAHA THAT WOUD BE NICE
Hahahahahahha i was so confused when Fury said “have you got a big….” And Francis was so confused hahahaha
Unlike Mayweather, when Tyson says he'll fight someone, it usually ends up happening. This fight will happen, and it will be one of the greatest fights in the history of combat sports.
Tyson fury is a great personality! Him and Ngannou would be a fun match to watch.
I hope Francis gets his payday.
Tyson is going to starch Francis
This is just a big paycheck for Francis. Francis has no chance. Just like Usman trying to get a fight with Canelo. No chance of winning. Sorry Francis the UFC heavyweight division sucks and you can't pull no ratings. Francis is acting like he's some big champ. He's only defended it once and asking for big money. His PPV's buys are low.  Abel (manager of both) also trying to get paid.
I'm really confused cuz Tyson 6'9 VS Francis 6'4. By the looks of it they both the same height, or maybe Tyson has like an inch on Francis. #ConfusionBoy
fury just asked Francis is he got a big D... that was weird
Francis Ngannou drops the bmf bomb and turns himself into a classless idiot in front of 94,000 people.
Tyson vs Francis it's just exhibition fight all UFC fighters want to switch to boxing there is less damage  and you can make more money i want to see Francis at UFC where's he belong  because Tyson vs Francis that B.S.
Teddy atlas doesn’t think ngannou will be able to even hit him one time and I agree, good luck
When u see them side by side, it becomes even clearer that in a boxing match Fury Will knock Francis the fuck out.
Tyson fury is a symbol of Christianity, I just see Christ in everything he does.
Fury will make Ngannou multimillionaire. Up to now he was in the low pays and will get the multimillion package.
I will say it again Body Builders done make good fighters it boxers. Fury will destroy Francis
Was a boring fight I nearly fell asleep 😴. Yes the uppercut was good but nothing else. The 3 Wilder fights were miles better
What's the story with Tyson's mam I never hear her even get mentioned ?
If Frances hit him everywhere, arms, shoulder, chest and stomach he'll be able to knock him out! He hits way to hard!
https://youtu.be/OxMi9nZDors 5 Minutes of the Funniest UFC Interview and Press Conferences of ALL TIME  I bet you can’t go the whole video without laughing
Hypothetical; Imagine francis wins this bout, blows up 100x what he already is, gets better at boxing through the process, goes back and keeps training wrestling and mma Then goes back and talks to daddy dana about a new ufc contract….that $7mil offer would be looking more like $50mil
Fury ain't much interested on fight against Francis,  but deep down he wants Francis to get paid well which he deserves , i know that Fury saw Francis video with his mom in there home kitchen, so i guess that made Fury think that Francis really deserves a big paycheck for what he has become now.. Fury just wants to help before he retires that's the most humblest thing in the sport❤️
that height difference wasn't really apparent with fury in boxing shoes and im sure francis had boots on but he looks as big as I've ever seen him
Ayo do he got a big what?
Francis is a big man, but he didn't look so big next to fury lol
We apologize for the language lol
NO MORE CLOWN FIGHTS ! PLEASE !
Francis Ngannou is what you get when you cross Tyson Fury with Mike Tyson.
This fury bloke looks like Jewish school teacher I used to know
Mike Tyson vs Tyson Fury, the announcer got it right LOL
😂😀  Mike Tyson  lol
imagine having to fight these two at a bar :D :D
3:50 He accidentally called Tyson Fury, Mike Tyson... 😖 and then he become IRON MIKE!
Do it. This would be so amazing. Tyson and Francis both deserve that check !!
Retire and be like Mayweather fight guys who doesn't box 😆 😂 🤣
Ngannou will destroy Fury if they fight without the rules of puny boxing. Street fight, MMA, kick boxing etc. Ngannou will shred him to pieces.
Fury low key sus for that question! even Francis was like, wtf! hom0!
Tyson is playing with 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,because he don't Know Francis Nganou🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd rather see fury fight Joshua usyk winner...
Tyson is a superior cloth
Dana needs to fire Francis for even thinking he deserves a fury fight
FURY BOXES DIRTY AFTER THE HIGHLIGHT, HE PUSHED THE WHITE In order for Dillan to be injured when he fell down
Have you got a big Kari, it‘s the word for D***, in the albanian Language 🇦🇱🤣
How is Francis the same height as fury
Interviewer calling Tyson fury mike Tyson at the end 😂   Sign the contract big boy sign the contract 🤣💯 Tyson fury is the shit though! Gotta love him! Respect to both Tyson fury and Francis Ngannou
He might be the goat bro. The Tom Brady of boxing.
dam i love it ..... can't wait ..... this is the fight i don't want to miss
"That is no small thing that you saw in there" lol
He can barely do mixed martial arts and thinks he can fight one of the best heavyweights ever. What a joke, can't wait until Dana kicks him to the curb. Then he will be fighting Jake Paul for some paper
If fury wants to make SERIOUS money then he should just fight AJ. That fight alone will probably generate well over 100 million
Why the fook has sugar took his shirt off 🤣
To Dan Oliver: Lmao! You mean Fury doesn't stand a chance against Ngannou in anything else but pure boxing rules lol! MMA is in the name. A bunch of different techniques and styles. Boxing is just that, boxing. Would be great if they fought following One Championship rules.
Fury is gonna break his face too much. 😂
Usky ???? Hmmm
Canelo vs Bivol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YZQdRr-eJ4
I hate these fights with a passion. Here you have a trained professional who’s muscle memory only serves hammer fists and kicks while the other is pure straights and jabs.
This is the best slomo video of Whyte KO, you can literally see his eyes roll back and yet he claims the push made him hit his head on the canvas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmpebP6u6zc
their friends francis an tyson you can tell by the banter between em their the type to go beat the shit out of each other then have a beer an laugh about it
Dana White punching the air right now
"It does not get any better than this"  Uh, how about defending against  someone with a bigger name for your Fairwell fight?
The ' punch ' never landed on the 'chin' open your fkn eyes , it grazed the right side of the jaw in ANOTHER scripted and rigged fight! Look at David Tua uppercut , they never get up
What's a Corey?
Tyson Fury is good and hes humble but Relax Tyson you will get knocked the F**K out by Francis. 🤣🤣💯
Mike tyson!? 😂 The reporter call that to tyson fury 😂
That's a truly sincere man of God. so genuine.  Love you man...
I met Francis on my flight  Such a polite and nice guy  I was skinny and nowhere to be found next to him  I got a picture with him what a nice memory But the gypsy king is the real deal taller bigger he’s such a monster
Tyson should also be very careful of Francis cause that dude can hit very had if he does catch him with a great right hand damn lights will be off
Anche se avesse  7 cinture sulle spalle, Ngannou resterebbe sempre uno scappato di casa. 0 classe.
Fury saying he could be seriously injured if he continued... then goes on to talk up a fight with Francis one of the hardest hitters in the world 😂😂  Fury is no way retiring,  until he fights the winner of Aj vs Usyk
Dana let ‘em fight u greedy mfer
On top of being a great fighter he also supports Palestine. A true warrior.
Ngannou merece essa oportunidade,um grande campea do UFC recebendo migalhas, Sr White  nao seja tao ambicioso vai peder um  grande lutador.
Boxing rules with any type of glove Ngannou doesn't stand a chance.  Sorry.
Mike Tyson he says 😂
Naganou might be the most dangerous human to ever live, but Tyson fury is the greatest boxer alive. That's like saying who'd win in a basketball 1v1 Jordan or Francis ngannou, there's not gonna be a heavy correlation, I'd never give ngannou a 0% chance, he always has a chance to land a lucky blow and take him out
Brock Lesnar walk's in....  Hold my beer boy's!
These two will be great to see. Francis needs to be paid. Dude has been through some craziness in his life. He deserves it.
Hybrid fight? Thats interesting, could be one of those Rodtang vs DJ type of stuff, a traditional boxing or mma fight between these two would be one sided af, a kickboxing or muay thai match would be wayyy more interesting lol
Tyson knows he can tire him down, Francis has got alot of cardio to do before he enters the world of boxing. It will come down to 1 punch K.O power from Francis or Tyson picking tiring him out in the later rounds and perhaps putting Francis away or win by points. My money will be on Fury.
If Wilder couldn’t beat Fury in 3 fights, Francis stands no chance 😂
That mic even on?
Francis will get paid but not the glory. He should only take this fight if he cares about a payday, not building his legacy. He has no chance at winning this under the Boxing rules
We all seem to forget that Deyonte Wilder said he put food on the table for Fury and his family. Maybe this is Fury just giving back...why did nobody praise Deyonte?
Did Tyson ask him about his weaner?
Dana white screaming at the sky right now knowing Francis will be out of contract soon.
You got a big corey?
Don't like that black guy.
This should be a kickboxing fight at least. I love Francis, but there's just no way Fury isn't a much better boxer.
Tyson's obsession with black dude's dongs is hilarious. He's now commented on Joshua and Ngannou having a big one lmao
Hes asked him if he had a big swipe on TV...lmfao I'm 💀
Tyson Fury is hilarious
Furry  going MMA NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR THE BOXING WORLD 😕
" Ave you got a big corey?"
Fury’s so big he makes Francis Ngannou look like Rampage Jackson
“Do you have a big cory” 😂😂😂
do the fans not hear this?
Oh bisping was right, francis does look confused.
Fury's bi sexual why ask a man that especially another fighter?
Everybody doesn't realize if it's a hybrid fight wears with MMA gloves that means when Frances hit you is basically almost hit you with a bare knuckle and bobbing and weaving is in as successful with small gloves because you can get around the gloves and hit somebody but Francis is 6ft 4 265 lb he has an 83 reach and Tyson Fury has a 85-inch reach. But we all do agree that Tyson Fury is the superior boxer but somebody like Francis is a decent boxer in his own right and would come with weird different angles not like a traditional boxer at the end of the day the dude's going to make a truckload of money
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
tell fMayweather to do that hahaha
Fury wins: Boxing, banter, drinking, swearing, having kids, ordering pizza, talking about Jesus and growing high. Ngannou wins: MMA, wrestling, coming from Africa, talking some French and fighting for a couple of rounds.
Tyson Fury is 6’9, Francis is listed at 6’4. I don’t see the height difference whatsoever.
Frannnis Ngannadoodoo
Yoooo there the same height and size tyson acting to friendly
Francis begging for money! Please dont make this fight! Francis doesnt belong in the ring with this man!
it's going to be an mma fight right?
Taking fury out the picture I think Francis would rule the heavyweight division,
Everyone's writing off Francis but it really depends on whatever hybrid boxing/MMA rules they go with. Only boxing: Tyson easily takes it. Boxing w/ leg strikes:  Probably Francis bc he kicks like a mule and knows how to deal with that sort of pain. A boxer getting calf kicked for the first time is going to be in a new world of pain. (Btw I'm rooting for Tyson but there's a lot of variables in play with the rules.)
If he beats nigonnu how ever its spelled. Ufc doesnt belong in boxing. But o think nagonnu can lay him down.
How amazing is it that we have two great, well respected and respectable heavyweight champions In both boxing and Mma. Both extremely humble and kind 🙌🏽
3:49 mike tyson kkkk
I wanna see Francis vs wilder Francis can win that. Then fight Tyson fury
What if Fury gets knocked out tho ? what if Conor beats Usman to become 3 division champion? All these questions and more will be answered on the next exciting episode of DBZ ! 😂
"Have ya got a big cory" 😂😂😂😂 fucking gold. 👌🏽
This guy it is, and will be a legend, he proved that if you have big balls you can beat any anabolic guy. Like we say in Romania he is a "Smardoi"😃
U can sometime forget how big he is when he's always with his family, making ngannou look average
https://youtu.be/5txYzCtU8w8  😆😆😆
Better make sure it’s boxing, he don’t want that smoke in a MMA fight
Fury fights bums🤣 Ruiz, destroys him in 3, Usik in 6 Joshua in 5, facts.
Soo boring. Getting more American  boxing is soo shit.
Dana will not let this happen
He shouldnt fight fury. He should fight wilder
Цыган)
I know Francis would obliterate him, if they were in a street fight (ʘ_ʘ)
@Don Oliver Ngannou will KO Fury once and for all count on it buddy boy
Bruh, Tyson Fury is HUGE, makes Francis look like his little brother and Francis is a monster in his own right.
So will Tyson Fury be known as Mohammed Ali Fury after this?
...make it fair.  Give each man his due.  CONTRACT SHOULD BE FOR 2 FIGHTS. One in boxing ring--and the second in octagon.  For baddest man on earth.  If Fury really wants to prove himself---be man enough to meet Ngannou in Octagon if Nagonnou agrees to take his challenge in boxing ring.  World would be on fire for this... YOU HEARD IT HERE, FIRST...
He’s nothing
Have you got a big CAWRY... Announcer that is no small thing you just saw there...
Ngannouzzzzzzzz........ who gives a fuck.
Must be his last fight up coming fighters scare those on top........
As a recovering addict, I do not understand when Tyson keeps talking about drinking and partying. Wtf is he on about?? Why is he talking about partying, after drinking himself and partying to the point of all time low depression and suicide and now I have heard him talking about drinking and partying?
Does anyone legitimately want to watch Tyson vs Francis?   It wouldn’t even be competitive…
Anyone else doubting Fury’s listed 6”9 height lately? Ngannou is listed as 6”4 and isn’t much shorter here!  He stood next to Dillian Whyte’s brother this weekend too (who is also 6”4) and he wasn’t much taller than him either!
Easy work for Fury
Geezer saying Mike Tyson at the end 🤣 probs right if Ngannou and Fury had a child, it would create the next iron Mike
This is cool Tyson vs Francis. Francis will make 15 times more in boxing win or lose
Ngannou would literally beat him up in anything other than boxing. May it be kickboxing, submissions, wrestling, muay thai or MMA.
Interviewer was so intimidated he said Mike tyson at the end there
Ngannou doesn't looks small next to many people but he looks dwarfed need to Shaq and even here looks small compared to Fury. He's got way more muscle on him that Fury. But Fury could easily him the gym and get to 310 lbs of muscle vs 263 for Ngannou. Fury chooses to stay lighter so he doesn't gas out during fights. He is a beast. Looking forward to the Ngannou superfight
Tyson Fury's head is friggin  huge. True heavyweight
He said retired from boxing not fighting.
I really hope he doesn’t retire until he finishes  off AJ, plus I’ll miss his character
I want to find out who's the baddest motherfucker on the planet, god damn that man is scary
For Tyson Fury to talk stupid have me changed my mind on his values . Tyson Fury now nothing but a fkin Joker , nothing more .enough said.
portrait of the gypsy king https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmu0sFrLDXs
Ngannou is a great puncher. Idk if he is a great boxer? I think mma guys tend to over react in boxing  and they waste a lot of energy. It would be fun to watch though for sure!
Tyson furry much bigger and taller. I can be an easy job.
Wow
Pure racism
thats what im talking about!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fury is trying to get Ngannou PAID. Real recognize real.
Anyone saying Francis doesn’t stand a chance is an idiot
“I wanna find out who’s the baddest mother fucker on the planet” In the presence of these two giants, titans of their divisions and overall gifted athletes that statement holds so much more weight
Sign the contract!!! SIGN THE CONTRACT!!!!
Bali dancing
The best ever
This is beautiful! Can easily see how much love and respect they have for each other!
Fury after pushing Whyte, he announce his retirement, and then calls out Francis and asking him if he has big cock haha he is an i*iot
Tyson Fury is a total disgrace to boxing. Now that he's made his millions, he's retiring from boxing. The only reason this fraud is retiring now is because he's afraid of coming up against a `real' fighter who'll give him a good hiding. Throughout his so-called career, Fury has fought nobody's and unknown's. He's not a fighter at all. Fury is a complete coward and a fraud. He's an embarrassment. Every time I see this guy, I cringe. Even when any of the young guys at the gym praise him, I explain how they obviously know nothing about boxing.
Check out his book: Behind the Mask. (what a struggle but looks like those days are well gone).  What a great example of sporting life. God is inside you. Thats why you can talk with him and become a CHAMPION. Go ask Fury if you dont believe me.
its cool
‘Av ya got a big corey” lmao
I'd pay to see that.
Haha wow.
huge repect on the big Corey joke absolutely killed me ✋🤣
Fury is already with the mind games lol. He's so awesome.
Be good but can't just be geared towards boxing.
making a joke of both sports for money
Tyson Fury is the greatest heavyweight of all times ❤️
Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee. And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.   (Deuteronomy 32:18-20) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
Let's get it! It's like 91% of Francis fight he won with boxing skills.  Let have a stand up Brawl! with Boxing rules + elbows and clinching in a MMA cage with pro MMA gloves. The perfect way to make a hybrid fight between these two great warriors.👊 Hope the fight will take place in Cameroon 🇨🇲 🙏
Oh dear, Ngannou has brought the scum, dreg like mentality of UFC to infect the noble art - what's with the bad language and hyperbole?! Anyone with, even, the slightest knowledge of boxing knows that a fight between the two will go only one way................still, you can't blame Fury for wanting one final and ENORMOUS pay cheque to take the fight. Likewise, for Ngannou it's a chance to make some real dough rather than see it go into that pudgy faced, slope-shouldered sack of guts, Dana White's pocket
It's still going to be a boxing fight!!🤷🏾‍♂️
This is a fight i could tell my grandchildren i got to see 😂
Okay I’m definitely watching that next fight
Good morning Tyson
Jesus theres not many other people that makes francis look small
Tyson gonna help a fellow fighter get a fat payday cause he ain't getting it in the ufc. I'm a huge mma fan and I'd hate for him to leave the sport but I'd be happy to see Francis  get that music million paycheck for all the years he's sacrificed to the sport
I want to fight the winner between Francis and Tyson. I was raised by a tiger and I'm ready to break ribs. By the way, congratutions my champs!
🤣🤣🤣 bruh I love Tyson fury this mfer looked at Francis and asked bro if he had a big dick
This is just silly. I'm glad Ngannous actually gonna get a decent wage tho. Dana's overly evil to his roster and ring girls n something needs doing coz people WILL start dying just to make DANA some money. Find "Surviving Dana" soon yea.
Honestly Dana will never let the fight happen because Ngannou isn't even in same league if it isn't MMA fight. Its a ludicrous fight with no positive outcome for UFC side, plus who really wants to see this shit? Ngannou gassed out in 2 Rds in his last title fight throwing winging punches, poor boxing and cardio. He has power for MMA but honestly hes getting too high on himself, no respect for position UFC has put him by building him up so quick. Also it's not Fury's job to give him a payday. Now it all makes sense why UFC and Ngannou having problems with contract negotiations, Ngannou might as well vacate belt if he thinks he's getting Fury fight. Also without UFC, he has no promotion backing and if he somehow gets fight independently and loses in bad way, then tries to return to UFC, a lot of his star power gone and all his leverage with UFC gone for sure. All this circus shit needs to be put to bed, best for all parties involved.
yeah fury is great and he's probs got a big cory too...hohoho
They should have two fights one in the boxing ring and one in the octagon
Fury will experience the beating of his life.
I’m 🇺🇸 but fury 🇷🇺 will knock that guy up
Talk about helping somebody get the 💰. That would be a mega fight.....
Fury is special but legend no way
Very happy for Francis and Mad mad.. respect for Tyson Fury! Such a good hearted Champ! Can't wait for their upcoming fight!👊
Tyson is a  bumb said his record
RIP tyson..... if thia happed....
I thought Tyson Fury was 6ft9 and would have a major height advantage against Francis Ngannou . Here he looks similar to Francis' height who's 6ft4 . Tyson looks 6ft5 at best standing next to Francis. This is an interesting match up , Francis has a small chance of catching him .
It's nice knowing that the 2 scariest modafukas are also some of the nicest, most respectful men.
U gotta big corey 😂😂😂😂😂😂
MMA fighters can KO boxers just like Mcgregor, Woodley, Muir and Silva. 😅
this guy is a truly great fighter. He's also a breath of fresh air.
Francis was wearing something in his shoes 👞 to be taller. Francis is 6 foot 4 and Tyson is 6 foot 9
Francis don’t have even a punchers chance against Fury. They should do it in the octagon so it will be a little more even. Fury has a better chance in an mma fight than Francis does in a boxing match.
Tyson is the Truth
Francis deserve BIG BUCK!  THANKS TYSON FURY!
Francis trying to talk I like that
Lmao, Francis is going to get hurt. He better demand a good paycheck, cause it may be his last.
Tyson is still just 33 years old. Dudes young but looks to be in his 40s
Love Tyson love Francis, I won't be missing that.....Wow !!!
👽
Mike Tyson 😂😂😂
What’s a big corey?
Have you got a big cory? 🤣🤣🤣
Fury is listed at 6’9. Ngannou is listed at 6’4. But they looked the same height in this video.
Undefeated, what a way to go.
Respect respect respect both love you both
Ngannou win by submission round 9😂
If this is anything short of francis being able to throw kicks it's a tiny chance of francis winning.
https://youtu.be/zhKwfZXXtvM
Oh lord Tyson is gonna slaughter this poor man. Francis will be completely gasses by the 3rd round. Easy $$$ for Tyson
All those you tube experts 😂😂😂😂
It won’t be MMA rules and might not even be an MMA cage, but if Francis has MMA gloves on, make no mistake about it, he can put Tyson Fury out cold with one shot. Same with Fury but Francis hits wayyy harder than Tyson Fury. Unfortunately it won’t be MMA, but even with just boxing, Francis has a chance with those gloves if he can land. Tyson is much more skilled in the hands, but not nearly as powerful.
Let francis use kicks atleast,  more of a kick boxing rule set.  I hate seeing MMA fighters get so heavily handicapped in fights. This fight should be about who the better fighter is,  not whos the better boxer
tyson fury will ko francis in a boxing fight
How awkward was that do you have a big Corey lol wtf
Ngannou already showing his lack of mic skills and inability to sell a fight.
This guys in big with the mob.. allegedly supposedly
mike tyson and tyson fury the most interesting/entertaining legends best to ever do it. Fury's resume most impressive
There are no boxers now a days
Francis looks bigger than I expected next to Fury
That upper cut left Whyte spaced out  well done Tyson  a true legend
Dillian Whyte stood no chance against The Ogre that is Fury. Let's be honest, Ngannou won't fair much better outside of an MMA fight. The fight I want the most is Fury vs. Uysk.
If the fight happens please be a genuine match not a choreographed exhibition we've seen too many of in the past.  MMA gloves in a boxing match with these two could be actually worth watching.
Better ppv off all time
LETS GO RESPECT TO MMA ,IT SHOULD FIGHT WITH MMA GLOVES OR WITHOUT GLOVE ,LETS SEE HOW RESISTANCE FURRY  WHEN GOT HIT BY NGANNOU!!!!
Lets GO BOXING WITH MMA GLOVE!! OR WITHOUT GLOVE LIKE BAR KNUCKLE !!!! NGANNOU VS  TYSONFURY 2022 DEC,31
LOL Tyson is so funny!
i was today years old when i found out what "big cory" means
Lmao “do you got a big corey” lol
How about a match in which alternate rounds will be fought by either MMA or Boxing rules, staring with whoever wins the coin toss. The gloves would be of MMA type but with more padding like the ones that used in MMA training.
Easy fight for Fury, he'll knock Francis clean out especially with MMA gloves on!!!!!!
Essa luta tem que acontecee
Francis is overrated
Mike Tyson 🤣🤣
Have u got a big kory🤣😂😂😂😂
Truth be told, nobody will beat Fury until he is ready to hang it up for good.  I didn’t want that, but it is what it is.
Fair question from Tyson.
Francis looking surprisingly big next to Fury, might even outweigh him. Doesn’t matter though, there’s no way he gets close to hitting him clean, especially if he can’t land on Gane with MMA gloves.
WTF did I just watched? Hahahahahaha
☀️☀️☀️
Fury is the fucking man
Furry and Ngannou would be one heck of a fight !
Two clowns
"Mike Tyson, Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou"
As a black dude, I know exactly what it is to make the same face as Ngannou when a random white dude wants to talk about your bbc. Some shit I'll never understand. Respect to Fury for a great performance tho.
He is a really good guy. God bless him and his family. The best in the division.
Francis wants to get paid. Doesn’t matter mma, kickboxing. Boxing is where he gets money. He doesn’t even wanna fight. He just wants to survive not worrying about paying the bills
Francis said mma gloves lol want to knock out fury with a rush, if drawn out technicality fury will win hands down if it’s boxing gloves. Much harder to KO with boxing gloves
Boxing isn't MMA these are 2 different ball parks get that through your thick heads people.
cringest thing ive seen in years
All the current boxers are trash. That's why a chubby fighter is defeating all of them
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life7
I Love Tyson more and more He is one of the Greatest
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
Tbh i wanna see this match. This will be explosive
Mike tyson.. ugh Tyson fury
is Francis wearing Lifts in his shoes? Tyson is 6'9" and UFC has Francis at 6'4" but they look about close in height here
Ufc fighters should stay away from boxing and about francis lol what he think of himself?🤣 challenging tyson fury for fight like wtf 🤣😂😂
notice he only calls out black people, hes a white supremacist and the blacks he fight gets paid to be knocked out, fake white supremacist garbage.
🛑My RESPECT shorts channel🛑: https://youtube.com/channel/UCYBl3izYjZlqTCk9GZi3ahw
Have u got a big Corey haha
Francis wants big money to change his community in Cameroon. I really don’t think it’s about personal wealth.
Francis looks full of vitality !
Fury and modesty .........🤣
Helping his fellow man, RESPECT.
Mike Tyson looking different these days
Subscribe 45juta
Lmao did he just accidently call Francis "Mike Tyson"?
"We apologize for the language" 🤓 Shutup bro
so is this actually going to happen?
Imagine if is Francis met the same uppercut to Dylan White ?
Fury is a goat so happy for him.
Boxing = Tyson destroys Francis. It would be nice to have one boxing match one mma fight between these two. I also believe fury has the balls to fight Francis in mma without previous mma experience.

Lets go boxing because francis is going to eat hin alive in the octagon
He wouldn't dare fight nganu he's a actually a decent challenger
It will take 1 round for Fury

Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Aight. This guy fury got my unmitigated respect!  Props champ!
2 round boxing 2 round ufc comon .
Tyson is the draw nuff said
Fury is brave by heart respect
If mike Tyson was in his prime and fought Tyson Fury he would knock Fury out in the first round and Francis will knock Fury out for sure
Fury lightly ‘pushed’ a guy and knocked him out. Amazing.
Tyson  Fury is a rare breed of  a Champ.  Masterful tactician w/ a fierce punch coupled w/ being one of the best sportsman of the model era.
He thought tyson was asking about corey anderson.
Yeah, so apparently, this is the new thing boxers have found to save their business, and make it seem that they're still relevant: challenging non boxers in a boxing match, knowing damn well that they have like a 90% chance of winning.  That only proves that MMA fighters are actually bolder than boxers, because they  dare to step out of their comfort zone to test themselves.
😆 He called him Mike Tyson
Why in the hell has sugar got his shirt off 😂
Everyone keeps saying Francis wouldn’t stand a chance… when nobody’s seen him box… Yea, okay.
All beings who have reached the God consciousness identify with the one God and share a oneness of thought. Innumerable beings in the universe share this consciousness which we seek to obtain. With every negative action, and every negative thought and feeling, you untiringly draw a new cataclysm nearer. Try to keep the state of inner peace and harmony during most of the day.
With mma-gloves fury will get detroyed by the predator
Big Corey is Big coke ? Sorry i m french 3:15
Someone's getting knocked out. I'm not sure who though.
Fury is a garbage. He should fight Ben Askren
“Mike Tyso- Tyson fury everyone”
Lets do few rounds boxing and few rounds mma. It be fair to both parties.
im not in favour of these MMA vs boxers anymore. they hype these fights up and they turn out really boring. if this fight happens, i say let them fight with MMA gloves or bareknuckles.
cool
Francis é o cara!!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/KZ7845pOHPA?feature=share
Do you have a big corey?😂😂😂😂
3:17
NGANNOU Não tem gás
Have you got a big tourie haha anyone that doesn't know already a Tourie is a dick haha  Old fury cannot beat his banta  Already in the head of nganou
WHY IS TRAINER SUGAR NAKED? DID HE FOUGHT D.W? NO, HE'S JUST TRYING TO STEAL THE SHINE OFF TYSON.
Why did tyson only want to beat black guys?👀🤣
Please, please, please, if you're reading this, do NOT, I repeat DO NOT, try this at home!
This marks the end of Boxing ,and official recognition of UFC as the biggest promotion in the planet 👏
Intrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreasting 🤔
Ngannou was wearing those shoe lifts in his shoes
3:51 mike tyson?🤔
I never got that like you can't pronounce yourself the best fighter in the world like that's not for you to say it's for the world to say him saying that like oh you saw his son become a legend in the sport and the greatest fighter in blah blah blah and it's like you're not the greatest fighter stop f****** proclaiming it other people the world has to proclaim that not yourself right now you're a self proclaimed the greatest nobody else ever said you are the greatest of all time like not even close Mike tyson would smash you today and prime your literally named after him that right there shows who the greatest is even your dad knows he's the greatest not you and I'm sure I'll get hate saying no Ali is but idk man prime Mike was a different kind of monster different kind of human
Did he just ask Francis if he's got a big wiener?
Tyson Fury best boxer!
Francis' "Huh??" got me lmao 😂
Did fury really just ask francis if he had a big dick like wtf I get his humor but that's a little on the gayer side
Am I the only one wondering how Francis is with in 2 inches of height to furry, casue furry is 6’8 and Francis is 6’4
G.O.A.T
Octagon or ring dude haha don't even ask of course its gonna be ring, Fury is insane but boxing is boxing mma is mma
I feel there is still a few more fights left in Tyson.  Is the AJ fight important?  Two years ago, yes. Today, no.    It be just nice if he defend his title a few more times.
https://youtube.com/shorts/gKfP-x6Bkj8?feature=share
.... A big Cory?
Tyson is a bad man I don’t think he can be beaten right now !!! Haha a big corrie I guess you all figured out what that meant!!! Gypsy king is the best u make us proud Tyson
New seeds
Will be more interesting than a bout with the winner of Usyk vs Joshua because we know what they will bring and we don't know what Francis brings to boxing if he just focuses on boxing, be interesting to see how he goes, would need to work on cardio and avoiding punches or could be a embarrassing night for him it could be over in a few rounds by standing TKO stoppage probably because Francis has never been knocked out.
02:48
I think Francis is going to get paid more by the ufc next fight ,or definitely fight tyson for the bad like mcnugget did.
Mike tyson 😅
Tyson calling out francis???? Neither boxing nor mma is fair for either. Tyson shoud be calling out Joshua, usik, heck even ruiz but not francis.
💪💪💯💯REAL CHAMP
Find a girl who looks at you like Sugar does fury
And yet he won't fight the "middleweight pussy" Usyk lol.
Furry is a great man.. beautiful to see these guys coming against each other
That was weird and both of these guys are champions in their own domain its gonna play out according to rules
why does francis (6 foot 4) look 6 foot 9 in this footage 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this 2 fuking Guys
Interested to see how this "Hybrid" fight turns out. Realistically each would beat the other at their own sport obviously there's a chance when dealing with this level of athlete but it's only a chance. So a "hybrid" depending on how it's done fight could be real interesting I still think the winner will be determined mainly by towards who's sports the rules lean but should be better than most boxer vs mma fighter clashes.
Can't wait!!  Two great champions!
Such a positive man this Fury
Can't do anything but love Tyson Fury.
Hate those clickbait titles, where tf was he disgusted? He just wasn't prepared but he laughed it off.
👊
Don’t play yourself. In MMA there are no breaks when fighters tangle. Your true strength will be tested to the core. You don’t catch breath in MMA. What am I saying? You can’t compare an MMA fighter to one.
Fight Usyk vs Aj 2 winner then call it a day.
This is great but Francis is not beating the King👑
Tyson Fury is definitely not 6'9 lmao
bruh didnt  ngannou is that huge
I'm a big fan of Francis but if it's a pure boxing fight, he's going to get taken apart. Other way round and it's the opposite, Fury would be in a world of pain
3:14 why isn’t that a meme yet? 😂
https://youtu.be/-DJ9ghOro3o
Fury "this is my last fight" Every normal bloke *eyerolls* Fury simps *crying* Fury "I'm going to call out more people a d set up a other fight" 🤣🤣 blokes a good boxer but an absolute dick
Fury vs ngannou on bare knuckle fighting. Make it happen
ESPN has absolutely fallen off with its broadcasting, commentary, and interviews.
I want to see Fury v Usyk/Joshua so bad. Even more than Ngannou v Fury.
That would be a crazy fight 😂😂I saw something that said it might take place in the Cameroon for charity (exhibition fight)
https://youtu.be/iIPfctmReTE
F U Dana White. Love Francis story and have great respect for the man. For Fury, real respects real. Great for giving Francis the chance to get out of these dangerous sports with what he deserves.
In the grand scheme of things Ngannou could defeat Fury in a multitude of ways anywhere from different striking variations to grappling and takedowns he knows how to use Fury just has his extensive knowledge of fighting in one dimension which is good so long as you stay in that lane the problem is boxing alone is an incomplete martial art same as the rest of them if that’s solely all you know and practice it’s like eating a meal with of only white rice and thinking you’re getting all of the proper nutrients from it
Did he just accidentally call francis  Mike Tyson 😂
nah he has to fight usyk, come on big boi it aint top
Not easy against Ngannou!
3:14 Fury: Do you have BIG cock mate!?  Francis: A big what!?  Fury: A BIG cock!?  Francis: A big what!?  Fury: A big cory??
Have you got a big nob lol
Король бокса против короля мма
"Damn right it was !"... Sugar ....😂😂
Image let’s just say the average ticket cost was $200.00 per ticket $200.00 X 95,000 people =19Mil seriously 19Milllon that’s if the per ticket cost was only $200. Per tickets which I seriously doubt but idk maybe it was $400 that would be 38mil and than after you figure PPV buys Jesus those two combine well over 100mil for sure
he never lost his titles technically.  in my mind if he truly is done, he's retired as undisputed champ.
You can’t come over to boxing and call for MMA gloves to be worn
nice video
Can't wait for Francis to shut this giant fucking baby up for good.
Ngannou will destroy him
Fury was 16 pounds lighter in his fight vs whyte. Why did he need to be so heavy for the wilder fight? Fury outweighed wilder by 20-30 pounds already. Then he puts on 20-30 pounds more right before he fights wilder. Why?
2 million plus viewership shows star power of Ngannou. Other videos of fury didn't cross even 1million views.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EILPa0fRvQ
Lmfao Tyson said he was 170 and Francis was 270
I reckon fight ajay for the last one
Yoo Francis is tall you know
Ooooh Tyson Fury! Oooooh Tyson Fury!! Oooooh Tyson Fury!!
THE MARK OF THE BEAST CLEARLY IS AT THE DOOR! A NEW WORLD ORDER AND A DIGITAL FORM OF CURRENCY IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. DON'T TAKE IT! THE MARK WILL BE ON THE RIGHT HAND OR THE FOREHEAD...NOT THE ARM...AND ALTHOUGH IT WON'T BE MANDATED UNTIL HALF WAY THROUGH THE TRIBULATION I BELIEVE THE ANTICHRIST WILL BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT VERY QUICKLY AFTER THE RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH! WE ARE IN THE BIBLICALLY PROPHESED END DAYS AND BIBLE PROPHECY IS CASTING A LONG DARK SHADOW OVER US NOW WITH MANY SIGNS OF THE TIMES CONVERGING IN THE WORLD TODAY! NONE OF THE JUDGMENTS OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION CAN BEGIN THEIR FULFILLMENT UNTIL AFTER THE RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH, AND WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DISAPPEAR IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, IT WILL AFFORD THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A SAFE AND SECURE FORM OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ON THE SCENE...A MARK ON THE RIGHT HAND OR FOREHEAD SO NOONE CAN STEAL YOUR IDENTITY AND EVERYONE CAN BE POSITIVELY ID'D AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SO MANY. DON'T TAKE IT! THE WORD OF GOD SAYS IN REVELATION 14 THOSE WHO DO WILL NO LONGER HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAVED.  NONE. PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO AND OTHER END DAY PROPHECY VIDEOS ON THIS CHANNEL IF YOU ARE NEW TO BIBLE PROPHECY. WE ARE VERY LATE IN THE END DAYS. NORMAL ISN'T COMING BACK. JESUS IS!  AT ANY MOMENT!  THIS VIDEO PROVES ACCORDING TO SCRIPTURE WE ARE THE END DAY GENERATION:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWPvq... THIS VIDEO IS MORE ON THE MARK: https://rumble.com/vxa567-mark-of-the...
Tyson's unorthodox style asking Francis if he's got a big cock... 🤣 Francis taken completely off guard!  Too much fun mixed with a killer instinct is an anomaly his opponents dont know what to do with!  Long live the Gypsy King! 😊👍
Tips to improve my channel??? https://youtu.be/nonoCwoOvcg
Damnn Tyson done fought again?? Damnnnn
chances are Tyson would destroy Francis but its still a nice thing that he's doing cos it gives Francis (a) a huge payday, and (b) a lot of leverage to negotiate better contracts with the UFC etc
Ngannou is the man!
another staged fight .
2:52 ngannou sizing him up lol
https://youtu.be/UwX6yoyIVik
That ' have you got a big Corey?' shout absolutely creased me there 😂. Tyson fury la
The American commentator ! And some British ! "What's a Cory" ? - Never heard that word used since I was a kid in the 50s ! Good on Fury - doesn't give a f**k !
Never seen someone so excited to get hit by Francis, Tyson is truly a legend who’s not afraid of any fight and i bet that payday will be something to remember too
Joe Rogan: "People like him because he has back fat"
Call out Ruiz You coward
Love how he said “Mike Tyson.. umm Tyson fury”
UFC really needs to start pumping up the money to their stars or they will eventually get chewed on by boxers. I mean, I watch MMA since circa '96 and UFC is still leagues behind of events like PRIDE did for MMA. The rules, the way fights are scored and the total focus on ppv shit instead of actually trying to make  MMA more innovative will eventually kill the event.
Tyson is a Nice guy really Big heart!!
2:46 when they size eachother up💯💯
Horrible fight, boring beyond belief with only one significant punch landed by either fighter. One, one punch in the entire fight 😤.  Pathetically weak effort by Whyte.
🤣 Frank Warren at '3:50' looking like 'what's going on? 'Why am I not involved in this money maker?
Make it an mma fight
Shane's hair piece was hanging in there tough eh
J'adore les blagues que fait fury avec francis... Vraiment c'est joli à voir.
Tyson Fury, what a legend?
Fury is just above everyone else nowadays
Sign the contract boy!!! Lol Fury is a God King!! Long live the Gypsy King!!
Deuteronomy 1:1-20,22-46 [1]In this book are the words that Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness east of the River Jordan. They were in the Jordan Valley near Suph, between the town of Paran on one side and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab on the other. [2](It takes eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea by way of the hill country of Edom.) [3]On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after they had left Egypt, Moses told the people everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them. [4]This was after the Lord had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in the town of Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who ruled in the towns of Ashtaroth and Edrei. [5]It was while the people were east of the Jordan in the territory of Moab that Moses began to explain God's laws and teachings.He said, [6]“When we were at Mount Sinai, the Lord our God said to us, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain. [7]Break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the surrounding regions — to the Jordan Valley, to the hill country and the lowlands, to the southern region, and to the Mediterranean coast. Go to the land of Canaan and on beyond the Lebanon Mountains as far as the great River Euphrates. [8]All of this is the land which I, the Lord, promised to give to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants. Go and occupy it.’ ” [9]Moses said to the people, “While we were still at Mount Sinai, I told you, ‘The responsibility for leading you is too much for me. I can't do it alone. [10]The Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky. [11]May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, make you increase a thousand times more and make you prosperous, as he promised! [12]But how can I alone bear the heavy responsibility for settling your disputes? [13]Choose some wise, understanding, and experienced men from each tribe, and I will put them in charge of you.’ [14]And you agreed that this was a good thing to do. [15]So I took the wise and experienced leaders you chose from your tribes, and I placed them in charge of you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten. I also appointed other officials throughout the tribes. [16]“At that time I instructed them, ‘Listen to the disputes that come up among your people. Judge every dispute fairly, whether it concerns only your own people or involves foreigners who live among you. [17]Show no partiality in your decisions; judge everyone on the same basis, no matter who they are. Do not be afraid of anyone, for the decisions you make come from God. If any case is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will decide it.’ [18]At the same time I gave you instructions for everything else you were to do. [19]“We did what the Lord our God commanded us. We left Mount Sinai and went through that vast and fearful desert on the way to the hill country of the Amorites. When we reached Kadesh Barnea, [20](20-21) I said, ‘You have now come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God, the God of our ancestors, is giving us. Look, there it is. Go and occupy it as he commanded. Do not hesitate or be afraid.’ [22]“But you came to me and said, ‘Let's send men ahead of us to spy out the land, so that they can tell us the best route to take and what kind of cities are there.’ [23]“That seemed a good thing to do, so I selected twelve men, one from each tribe. [24]They went into the hill country as far as the Valley of Eshcol and explored it. [25]They brought us back some fruit they found there, and reported that the land which the Lord our God was giving us was very fertile. [26]“But you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God, and you would not enter the land. [27]You grumbled to one another: ‘The Lord hates us. He brought us out of Egypt just to hand us over to these Amorites, so that they could kill us. [28]Why should we go there? We are afraid. The men we sent tell us that the people there are stronger and taller than we are, and that they live in cities with walls that reach the sky. They saw giants there!’ [29]“But I said, ‘Don't be afraid of those people. [30]The Lord your God will lead you, and he will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt [31]and in the desert. You saw how he brought you safely all the way to this place, just as a father would carry his son.’ [32]But in spite of what I said, you still would not trust the Lord, [33]even though he always went ahead of you to find a place for you to camp. To show you the way, he went in front of you in a pillar of fire by night and in a pillar of cloud by day. [34]“The Lord heard your complaints and became angry, and so he solemnly declared, [35]‘Not one of you from this evil generation will enter the fertile land that I promised to give your ancestors. [36]Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will enter it. He has remained faithful to me, and I will give him and his descendants the land that he has explored.’ [37]Because of you the Lord also became angry with me and said, ‘Not even you, Moses, will enter the land. [38]But strengthen the determination of your helper, Joshua son of Nun. He will lead Israel to occupy the land.’ [39]“Then the Lord said to all of us, ‘Your children, who are still too young to know right from wrong, will enter the land — the children you said would be seized by your enemies. I will give the land to them, and they will occupy it. [40]But as for you people, turn round and go back into the desert along the road to the Gulf of Aqaba.’ [41]“You replied, ‘Moses, we have sinned against the Lord. But now we will attack, just as the Lord our God commanded us.’ Then each one of you got ready to fight, thinking it would be easy to invade the hill country. [42]“But the Lord said to me, ‘Warn them not to attack, for I will not be with them, and their enemies will defeat them.’ [43]I told you what the Lord had said, but you paid no attention. You rebelled against him, and in your pride you marched into the hill country. [44]Then the Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you like a swarm of bees. They chased you as far as Hormah and defeated you there in the hill country of Edom. [45]So you cried out to the Lord for help, but he would not listen to you or pay any attention to you. [46]“So then, after we had stayed at Kadesh for a long time,
Shit im pumped!!
Is it me? Or is SugarHill Steward one weird dude!!! Shirtless on the ring??? Sportin’ the belt!?!
He is also great human being. Yesterday I saw  the video; Tyson  with a little boy without arms and legs, his little fan.  Tyson, thanks!
He earn the right to call out anyone now
I like Ngannou, and i like Fury, but I just don't want to see another crossover. What is the point? If its boxing, Fury will win easily. If its MMA, Ngannou will win easily. There is no tension, there is no mystery, there is nothing good about this whatsoever. This isn't Godzilla Vs. King Kong. Its King Kong Vs. Godzilla in a building climbing contest. Fury will mess him in boxing. So boring.
Dana White just had a stroke right now. He's on to his lawyers right this second
America...made...you...a...superstar..😅
I thought tyson would dwarf Francis but damn Francis is huge
That will be an insane fight Tyson with crazy skill and Francis with Predator like power
Tyson Fury is a lovable man.   He continuously prove himself to be the best.
Have u got a big corey 😂😂👌😂
Tyson Fury could of filled up a Nas Car ring like the indy 500
Ngannou  "Gonna be QUOI???" 😅
Much better than toprank highlights
They should bring back Game if Thrones and give Tyson Fury a major role. If he won't box anymore, that would be a sensation
There's only one Tyson Fury!!!!
Dam. Why are you retiring man??? Why???
They asked dalliance after the fight ..did fury hurt you ? Dalliance replied ...nahhh ..only when he hit me ...🤣🤣🤣👊👊👊
Women want children or they will die so be ready for that.
Ngannou isn't 6'4 and fury isn't 6'9, wtf, they are almost the same height
Tyson fury  Amazing Strong and strongest.. And the man funny and loveable too I like it ...
Legend. One of my top fav boxers. Well done gypsy king 👑
Got to say for a heavy weight champion boxer Fury seems to be the nicest guy ever.
Tyson fury vs KING KONG😱😱😱
Holy shit small gloves Francis vs. Tyson that's fucking insane!!!
This man coked out
Who’s the guy with the shirt off with the belt?
Francis looks like little bro next to Tyson :-)))
For if she does not call you Lord, she is not Wife material. Saith Old Testament God of Destruction, who used the flood.
We love you MR TYSON FURY
Fury becarefull ooooohhhhh N'GANNOU 💪🏿 will pepper you... Ayoooo!!!!
Tyson and Francis are are fast friends headed towards a pay day.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Tyson fury has learned from Mayweather on how to make alot of money
I got my money on Francis
Good job by the reporter.  His English has improved lots
Fury needs to chill out and be heavyweight King. The UFC is a different animal
Tyson wants his brother Francis to have a massive pay out! Boxing wise we all know there is a slim chance Francis would ever win that fight. MMA wise Francis would destroy him. But Dana would only pay them max. 10% of what they would gain by boxing each other.
Fighting Tyson Fury wearing 4 Oz gloves is a huge disadvantage.  FN should be demanding 100oz gloves for the fight.  That fight won't last long. Eating bricks from Fury isn't a long lasting affair.  Fury isn't a typical fighter. He is awkward but he has balls and has a huge body to wreck with.   His skill is top level, experience is vast, tested and triumphant, it would be hard for anyone to dethrone him but someone in their first boxing contest?
THATS GONNA AWESOME!
TYSON FURY should NOT retire - it is too soon - too early -- more fighters to beat -- he is too young to retire
A true champion, just gotta love how the man respects the sport
The tyson fury movie is gonna be wild af 🤣
Tyson sucks!
Who's gonna stop Ngannou from boxing with Fury now? Its gonna be great.
I wonder what Dana is thinking while watching this interview. Lol
Tsk tsk tsk Francis! What will daddy Dana say about this. 😂
Ngannou can't box with Fury... no way!!!
Fury will do exactly what Mayweather did to Conor
An UFC heavyweight champ is the baddest man in the plane, nobody in the world can beat him in a fight
Much respect to Francis but Tyson been a top Heavyweight boxer a long time.
I hate Tyson don’t comment under My comment about what I said I don’t know y’all and I won’t get a notification about it so I could careless bout what y’all gotta say
The great White Hope has finally dominated boxing first one since Rocky Marchiano I love Tyson fury he’s an Englishman I know he’s somewhat Irish but it’s the same thing he’s an Englishman and I’m a and im Anglo Italian Marchiano and fury  my two favorite boxers ever
Fury needs to go mma
Tyson Fury is Naturally wired up 👃
El mejor boxeador de la actualidad que no se retire
If Tyson///Fury happens it'll literally break PPV

Shout out to Tyson Fury 💯💯💯💯💯💯
We need more fights in the UK….f u c k the US.
I think people really underestimate what growing up in a salt mine, travrling through numerous deserts, and dealing with the racism in europe can do to a person. I got my money on Francis. Given I love both of the guys
I will pay to see that fight!!
These Crossover Fights are nothing but a quick 💰Grab, nothing more nothing less. Not competitive and for the basic ass fan.
(لاإله إلا أنت سبحانك إني كنت من الظالمين )استغفروا الله العظيم واشكروا نعم الكريم وتوبوا لله العظيم وصلوا على خير البشر سيدنا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Francis is the man...... in mma. He doesn't pose more of a threat to fury than wilder did in boxing tho
By bye  ay...lol
Respect for Fury for helping Francis get paid big.Fury is great human being.
MMA gloves? holy shit that would actually give francis a chance.
Fury giving Ngannou a dream payday opportunity.  Please wear boxing gloves. Dont want to see anyone brain dead
Is he ready though?
Love it!!!
https://youtu.be/qHx7kQGqlSw
Luta boa, vantagem do Tyson no boxe, mas o nnganou é um monstro
I want this fight so bad! Tyson wins all day in boxing rules but Francis puts up a hell of a fight! Two fights get Francis paid he deserves this
Like iron mike vs bob sab contrac 😆 🤣
Sugar Hill really doesn't know when to keep his shirt on
That Francis guy....cringe
lol he had to apologise for the swearing - should have known UFC guys are uncouth and anything goes.
Fury about to retire with a bang if he fights Francis 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Uncivilized MF. Making reference to another mans appendage....televised. Like that shit is normal? Weird as fuck.
belly dancing. thats halarious
Would love to see it
Fury is such a good man and a class act. Great career. Sad that Joshua fight didn't happen but maybe an interesting match up with Ngannou makes it alright. Excited to see the next chapter of Fury saga!
The video was cut 4 seconds short, the presenter cut words were “cory, is longer than my arm”
Really wish Tyson could become undisputed but it's hard to do with all the slog.
Salute to Fury! He just upped Francis stock through the roof, & at a critical time! Even if they don't have any intentions on lining that fight up, it just forced the UFC's hand to play ball & the shot clock just started. #respect
Come on Tyson don't you are going to get knocked back into Sunday school awhole lotta respect for Tyson fury for knocking wilder out but all Francis does is put people to sleep, we are talking about a guy who has a punch equivalent to a truck. I don't think I've ever seen Francis use kicks in UFC all he's he don't do takedowns he just goes for knockouts after knockout whatever Tyson does jus don't try go toe to toe with him jus run that's all you can do maybe get rid of that beer guy while ya at it
Fight a real boxer - enough fighting bum after bum. You been talking shit about Usyk all this time but you wouldn't dare allow him to school you in every aspect. Retire because personally I'm fed up watching you fight bum after bum. Francis now? Another bs spectacle??? You are a joke!
fury aq bunu siker atar
Fury win easily
Dana surely got his panties in a knot over this. Someone else is trying to play with the toy he threw away and like any good spoiled child he’s going to throw a tantrum.
Good job Mike Tyson
why has sugarhill like always got his shirt off haha
Francis engaño looks short next to Tyson
Wow
SO HE RETIRE FRO BOXING AND NOW IS GOING TO MMA? ASKING FOR A FRIEND
Fury earns my respect
the only man i see make francis look small holy!#!# tyson is a big man didnt realize until now how big he was
Tyson Fury have earned my respect here. A fighter that actually want to fight regardless of the rule set. Like the Great Mario Yamasaki once said; Let them be a warrior!
SPORTSMANSHIP. 🙂
Fury, Francis.... holy shiiiit. Box office records
So they going to have ufc gloves on when they fight did I hear that correctly ?
Fury is the current era greatest. AJ can't do shit to Fury. Gypsy King he is.
Let’s also consider how many thugs posted hatred toward the current champion….  😂  Untouchable huh? 🤣
What is a corey??
He takes too many hard shots to the head and has no kind of offensive skills.  He is lucky there are no hard hitters out there with real defensive and offensive skills anymore.  Wider hit him with brain-damaging blows but lucky for him, Wider is no Mike Tyson or George Forman, or Muhammid Ali that would have followed up with killer instincts and summarized him.
This dude has better be glad we no longer have fighters like Mike Tyson or George Forman or Mahammid Ali anymore because he would have not been in any competitions. These fighters these days have not got the skill set of fighting ability as it was back then.   This man is fat and out of shape and this is how he fights.  Fighters don't have stamina or respect for the science of boxing anymore.  The only fighter that has that skill set are the smaller fighters.  The heavy-weight division is just pitiful.   This guy could not even hold the jock straps of these fighters. Fighers like Ray Mercer would and Ken Norton and Shavers, would have knocked his head clean off. He just feel like he can take the blows and get up.  These fighters would have never gave him a chance to get up because if he had, he would have been killed with devastating blows.  These guys fought just with mean intent and to put food on their tables, and they came from the mean streets of boxing at the elite level.  It was sweet science but this guy fights like he has no idea of what he is doing out their.  He has been lucky so far but he may end up being a fatilty in the ring..  He just gets hit way too much.
Francis? Tyson would roast him like a Thanksgiving turkey!
really cool guy Tyon fury!
Fixed
Ngannou can punch harder than Wilder so this would be interesting to see!
Hats off to fury he’s a legend in boxing no doubt!!
Closest thing you’ll get to a bareknuckle in the ring two top men 👏
My love is for Tyson.. I love Francis to the moon
🔱　tyson ngannou 🔱
Tyson is one of the greats,no doubt. Dillian is probably at the level of an 80s or 90s gatekeeper sort of level. Those sorts of guys like Ribalta, Dokes ,Weaver,Bonecrcusher Smith ,Coetzee,Berbick..capable of some good results,win a title even ,but not top tier.
How polite is Tyson.. Real modern day honour. He really is a role model
Legend from 🇳🇬 big up Dana can’t keep you down forever
Francis is bigger
life is boring without Tyson the king fury.
To think Dana's not trying to make this happen that way other fighters don't keep moving to boxing to make a life changing payday. He rather pay in the range of 20,000 in order to make as much profit and be in control.
I would have liked to see Fury vs Usyk because they're both skilled and technical but I'd be super interested in this. Let's hope Dana White doesn't go against this!
That would be insane...Ngannou vs. Fury. Please let it happen sweet baby Jesus.
Fury propelled himself to another level of real with that one. Looked the earnings up on Google and bra... Bane almost made more money than the UFC heavyweight champion and he lost!!! Didn't even make a M I just lost kudos for Dana on that one are you serious? Give Ngannou a retirement fight I see why he said he's not fighting MMA nomore I'm mad for him.
Damn boxing events feel so dead compared to even a UFC Fight night
Fury vs. Ngannou 💪🔥💯👑
" Let's go champ "
I like Tyson Fury. He grows on you because he’s for real.
Tyson was genuinely curious about Frank's BBC
Tbh I see Francis taking this yea fury is still doing work at his age but Francis still works till this day there is no way Francis passes this offer up
sugar hill loves being all in the video, top off lol
Tyson fury said he’s 170 lol
Not sure what they mean by a hybrid fight. Boxing with mma gloves?
Ehhh, already with the "hybrid rules" bs. Stop calling out boxing champions and demanding hybrid rules. You both want to box; neither of you wants to wrestle.
Name 1 punch that has ever affected ngannou, and then continue your arguments
Mma  gloves, he would have a chance
Yhhhhh, he's not retiring 😂
Itd be cool to see a match with lighter gloves maybe
Is that mic even on?
Man! The woke crowd are going to go nuts with this dude! But hey, tell it to his face! 🤭
Tyson Fury, very generous of you to bring Francis Naganno on center ring and promote him. You are a great champ, God bless you!
3:16 Awkward Moment😂😂😂.
In the ring ngannou gets destroyed but in the octagon fury get demolished
Good example for alit of fighters Dana abuses more of them
Fury vs Anthony ruiz
Nigga said he 170. Gtfoh. Aint no way that's even REMOTELY possible. I clock in at 170-175. And you can barely tell i weigh that tbh. Sometimes i even drop to round 165, my metabolism fast ASF fr. I dont gain weight well or keep it on. He's like 7 ft chubby/fat. So that mf lying like shit lmfao
Tyson will send him back to africa like dillion is goin back to rewanda lol 😂
Wow that‘s literally pulling a brother up!  🇨🇲🇬🇧 brotherhood right there! And much love to Fury!
Hahahha have you got a big Cory hahahahaha
Fury has the perspective. He's been through so much. You could just tell he understands a great deal
Typical pos reporter, “America made you a superstar” umm no his skills, hard work and dedication among many other things is what made him a superstar u douche bag!
https://youtu.be/ha9XX9GTBrQ
we all know this figth will happen for money both and there will be no winner anounced like logan mayweather figth.
https://youtu.be/ha9XX9GTBrQ
Tyson will get knocked the F out. Francis is much more athletic and powerful than whyte and much more of a genetic freak and natural puncher than anyone Tyson has ever been in a sport boxing match with.
Ngannon will win Fury only if he takes him down 😁😁
The journalist said we are sorry for the language because of the f word pronounced by francis
Given this guy a shot at Tyson fury is such a con job this is now just tick tock videos and Facebook sports the guy hasn't worked his way up the boxing ranks to give him a shot at the championship belt is an absolute joke I for one have quit watching all of this now if this fight happens I'm not even going to bother it's now just an entertainment just like wec and Harlem Globetrotters basketball
Saw a big black dude and said “mike tyson” 🤣🤣🤣
Boxing only... mma will never happen. Either way.  Their both the GOAT'S of their respective sports.  May God protected them both from now until the end... Namaste mother fuckers
Sugar put yo damn shirt on
94,000 tickets is just insane
these two are class acts

For those thinking you can beat someone up who's boxed for 15 plus years your crazy this man is the Greatest Heavy Weight of all time.
Francis is a shitty fighter why would ya wana fight him
Love both these men, 100% buying this if it happens
You got a big Corry 🤣🤣 asking the man if he has a big c**k 👏🏻👏🏻
🇺🇸 Didn't MAKE FURY.
Lol Tyson asking Francis about his dick🤣
Francis deserves this payday, both of them do just two amazing athletes and human beings…
Love to see this fight, but I dont like seeing them be so comfortable with each other already
Stipe Miocic will beat him in Boxing!
Those 14 months crossing the sea to Europe  including 28 years of struggling in a village are about to pay off for Ngannou. Thanks Tyson Fury because you have no reason to fight but this will help Ngannou and the amazing people of Cameroon

"RUSSIA UKRAINE WAR"? BY PROFESSOR WALTER VEITH AND MARTIN SMITH YOU TUBE POWERFUL POWERFUL UNMISSABLE WATCH FROM SOUTH AFRICA YOU TUBE 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾... TRUTH ALWAYS WINS ❤️🙏🏾❤️
Fury might be the Heavyweight GOAT!
Fish eyes Frank Warren stood there thinking how he much money he'd make if this was tyson next fight. With Francis being ufc champ Dana will want a big cut
no..he called OVER Ngannou..Ngannou was the one who said he wanted to fight..technically..
I like Sugar, But him off to the side just cheesing up the cam with his shirt off for no reason, seems weirdly desperate.
If Francis gets to wear MMA gloves then it is very very interesting.... the plot thickens.
Have ya got a big Corey 🤣🤣🤣
Don't sleep on francis
AJ should fight TF If this match doesn’t happen shame on AJ
Oh yes
The fight would be fun to watch between these guys but what type of rules will it be under, kick to the legs are a MF.
https://youtu.be/G-4AKjj_2Ng
Usyk
Fury stands alone on TOP!
Nice to see Francis ngannou in boxing place but sorry to say I don't want to see you fight Tyson fury because as die hard boxing fan I wanna see fury go for the undisputed and fight usyk and after that he can retire on a high and he can do a exhibition against the Nigerian
Mma gloves in a boxing ring??
https://youtu.be/X57zAQ_dUao full fight
Nganou's and Gane's heights are criminally understated. Both they cant be shorter than 6.7. Look at him standing next absolute giant. Tyson Fury!
Francis is fucking massive
Be a crazy fight especially if it’s hybrid
Camon guys make this fight happen 💪💪💪
Can't wait to see Dana talk shit about this. Only his lover McGregor gets to do these things
This not belly dancing lmao
Dana get crazy
Fury is definitely the best of a bad lot....GOAT?.....hardly.
No abusive language needed, super classy!
Classy as ever! Both of them!
Tyson fury what a man what a story what a life.  Francis ngannou what a man what a story what a life.  Two legends.
3:04 Apologize for language? This is UK not US
Dana cannot deny this fight from happening
If they do a hybrid fight that's boxing but with MMA gloves then Francis has a chance
PAY this man! Francis deserves it and these guys are clearly great friends! They could sell pay-per-view off just their pedigree alone! No need for fake beef. Just two champions colliding.
Nice
Have you got a big Cory... 😆....  Class...
Dont forget this fight https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xpV2ZnXfi9Y&t=13s
Either Fury is not 6'9" or Francis is not 6'4". Wonder which one it is.......
It seems doubtful that Dillian Whyte would want a rematch after that epic ass whooping but then again, Deontay Wilder already had 2 rematches with Fury.
Could not keep his word for 1 minute lol
He's focused on getting Francis paid, that's a good dude right there.
Wow love both guys!
Is it going to be in the octagon...? Fury: ahum..hu...😅
If you know what's in the world, they're all demon possessed.
no one wants to see the boxing Heavyweight King against a NONAME golddigger from mma..why does people give this arrogant 16:3 Amateur that much attention.Only one title defend and asking for millions
This fight should be in mma gloves
3:50 When you think about Mike Tyson, even through that it's another Tyson 😅
i wanna see it
Interviewer: Mike Tyson Tyson fury
Stupid thing to ask Francis has he a big......well whatever
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                 .?>?>?>           ?>/
Nice to see a callout that isn't fake trash talking haha
Tyson will never ever fight Ngannou!!
In street fight francis would murder tyson everyday all day
Tyson Fury: Have you got a big corey?  Commentator: That is no small thing we saw right there, folks...
Tyson vs Ngannou!!
Boxing - no leg training, far back stance, completely different sport.  Any other fighting sport Francis wins. Leg kicks, wrestling, etc.  Boxing sure fury 99 nods out of 100.  But being the best boxer doesn't make you the best fighter on the world.  Fighting ain't throwing hands. If you walk up to someone anywhere in the streets everything goes....
Bald Francis is scary
*6th rd* *6 seconds on the clock* *6 second count out*
Don’t do it Francis he will treat you with the soft gloves u don’t want that bro
For God so love the world he gave his only begotten son Jesus Christ that who so ever believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life commit to Christ ur choice God bless u all and everyone that sees this
Very decent and respectful man he is... A true gentleman. He only fights in the ring, when the time comes. My god, they stopped making humans like that
woooooooooow
Francis sized him up a bit and was like dang
i never understand why the fighters cant say whatever the hell they want. Since when is fighting PG????
That was pretty cool
What a good dude Tyson is.
How fury is 6'9" with franchise 6'4"? Damn they look same
Francis Ko 1 round
Tyson fury is the best heavyweight ever. I can’t see anybody beating him he has everything
What he say when they cut his audio
Well, Francis is about to get sued so hard he will need 20 Tyson Fury fights to pay Dana.   Good luck with the lawsuits Francis.  You should have finished out your UFC contract instead of breaching it.
There’s a reason why boxing pays the best.
Mike Tyson ROFL! It was bound to happen wasn't it?! I hope the real Mike Tyson doesn't punch this reporters face like he did that idiot on the plane.
That was illegal. The Ufc can now claim all the profits if they do fight.
If they do what they did for mighty mouse vs. rodtang. Start boxing rules, 2nd round mma mix rules, round 3 boxing etc. But it most likely be pure boxing, with mma gloves
Thought he was quitting?
"He landed like a peach" 😭🤣😁💀
Why has he not fought a real heavyweight warrior
If anybody thinks this is gonna be a competitive boxing match. You’re in for a rude awakening. Fury picks this dude apart. Easily
Wow… absolutely can’t wait to see that bout!!!
)))
Brah franny looks like he has some gyno going on
' This is not a Belly dance this is a heavy weight Boxing'😂😂
Why don't they use mma rule not boxing
Francis deserves the big pay day.
fk naganoonoon he'll get dropped and finished just like them all. The Gypsy King Is the Greatest!
Fury, please have one last fight with Usyk for the fans(I hope this end in a trilogy) and do MMA or WWE or whatever.
Regardless who wins, I'm a fan of both men. And they both deserve a big paycheck and the respect 💯🙏🏾
Francis is not going to win this fight but happy he is going to get paid
In real life why isn’t he fighting  Usyk🤷🏽‍♂️
Jab night all night right there and permanent damage
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Did he really say Mike Tyson at the end....🙄
The moment Francis takes Tyson to the ground its over
Who can hate Tyson Fury ?!! He is the BEST ! A KING ! a LEGEND !
Heavy weight box looks so boring now so flat footed. I miss the Mike Tyson days.
Unpopular opinion: they should fight in the triad combat triller thing that would be perfect since they can clinch and box
😮
Ngannou practiced for this night as if its his fight.
tyson is the kindest sports athlete to give francis an opportunity like that
Take my money.
170lb furry looks massive 😅
Why not make a pure MMA fight between Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou? These boxers are such a bunch of useless cowards.
What's big Corey
If leg kicks are allowed in tyson vs Francis tyson fury will probably have his leg break
Fury is a monster.  6'9",  260 lbs.   Ngannou is 6'4", 240 lbs.  It will be Goliath vs. Goliath.
The commentator is a sot
They said it’s gonna be in a boxing ring with 4 ounce gloves. Tyson is gonna have to change his defense up
This is not bally dancing
Get yourself a trainer that looks at you like Sugar Hill does Tyson Fury
The commentator at the end still living in the dark ages calling black people 'things'!
He hit him with a good upper cut but the uppercut didn't put him to the floor , he push him down.
lmao francis would clap his cheeks aha
Francis is going to demolish tyson. Its not even a close fight
Dana must be pulling out his .....nevermind 😶
Can we just say thank you for his amazing content
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
tyson fury vs canelo
Shame they didn’t use the English flag instead of the Union flag
Tyson is a legend great great great guy
Amazing video👍👍👍
Tyson Fury  THE BEST 💯
Would’ve loved to see an Ali vs Fury battle.
Fury gonna get fked up 😬
Tyson fury is a Bad mfkn white boy👏🏾 real stand up guy. Proud to see him go out on top
Boxing with mma gloves cant wait
Fury still ducking Usyk
Nganou Has no chance with fury. IF the UFC releases him for this fight. He will retire with a nice payday.  I love how everyone complains about pay these days. From barstool bloggers to professional fighters. Hey dummies ! You signed the contract. Renegotiate or shut up.
fury is good but everyone else is straight trash, big fish in an empty pond
Just sounds like a working class man after a fight Gypsy king hwg
Sugar Hill without a shirt on was interesting!
I thought I was watching a fight from 1920, a fat, tired, unstyled champion bragging about being the best pound for pound champion.
Why does Francis look much taller than dillian although both are 6 feet 4?
Boxers should stop calling out mma fighters unless it’s a different rule. It mks no sense
That's a fight I wanna see. Fury is so good that I think if he had a few years of grappling, he would be UFC champ too
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Tyson Fury is not doing the Ngannou fight for money. He's doing it for Ngannou and his foundation. I can sense that in this planned callout.
Bro I thought Francis was like 6'6" but he is the height of tyson
Fury is the Epitome of Body Positivity .
Watching these two giants kidding around makes my heart melt. No black white bullshit, only humanity.
I think he can knock tyson out cold seriously
Id rather see ngannou vs wilder lol
At least 12 inch, 30 cm Ruler.
francis looked small next to tyson
it was a massive massive anti climax, 95k people and hardly a brawl, saw better fight few weeks ago, burns vs khamzat now imagine that in front of 95k people,
Francis Ngannou just told Dana to kiss his arse!
I LOVE THAT MAN
Yay more exhibition pay days..
Not talking about a staged fighting like Mayweather And Connor
Tyson is pulling a Tom Brady! He will come back and fight!
Special rules match like Rodtang vs Dj
The officiating in this fight was spot on. He could of easily taken points for the holding and shots behind the head but nope, send them to corner and shouted at them like he's their old man and let them get on with the fight.
Did Tyson ask how big Francis was downstairs?  Lmao
Man francis is a lot bigger than I  expected, I thought he would be way shorter than tyson lol
Mike Tyson :D
America made you a super star?
My respect for both fury is just build different to the rest boxers champ fury
I love Tyson one of the best boxers of all time if not the best I definitely fancy him in a boxing match against Francis however a boxing match with 4 oz gloves I feel like Francis probably puts Tyson to sleep that's just my opinion you don't have the protection that you normally have and if you miss calculate blocking one of francis's punches your night is over I don't care who you are
What a nice guy man 👊🏾💪🏾
He's clueless overrated delusional he's nothing without the African American dillian DUNCE Whyte is a complete professional amateur  this is the weakest heavyweight division ever 🇨🇦🇪🇺🇺🇸🇬🇧💯🔥
Fury the Goat
Have you got a big Cory! What a Belta Tyson Is 😂😂😂
With mma gloves? Dayyum 😳 Francis having a good advantage here. You are not heavy hitter like Francis and you cant protect your head because mma gloves are so small. Both fighters are sloppy but Francis is more technical and sharp. In early rounds he can do something.
Lol Francis would kill Fury in a boxing match, fury stands 0% chance and I say this as a ex pro boxer
I’m so happy for Francis to get that money fight
while Francis outsize most UFC HWs, here's Fury almost towering over Francis like he's his big albino brother.
mike tyson
How can you not love Tyson Fury?
I understand people wanting Ngannou to get a payday, but I can't understand people getting hyped for a fight they already know is pointless and uncompetitive.
Tyson already playing mind games😭😂
"America made you a superstar" huh?
Boxing is a thing but mma is everything if fury will fight with francis, he will just throw some good punches but if ngannou hits him a one powerful punch aur if he will take him down fury wont be able to do boxing as well...remember ngannou has the hardest punch record fury is the best boxer but ngannou is the monster
Mike Tyson is that nigga not you
"have you got a big cory?" our man Tyson. never failing to entertain.
OMG  I loved it so fucking much !!!!! Humble and almost Friends
Great Mike Tyson impersonation from fury @3:52 ! 😂
There is no way Francis can beat Tyson in a boxing match and there is no way Tyson can beat Francis in a MMA match, Both are different sports
DONT GIVE THAT BUM NGANOU ANY LIMELIGHT FURY WILL BEAT THE BITCH OUT OF HIM AN KO HIM EASIER THAN HE JUST DID TO A GOOD HEAVYWEIGHT  WHYTE
So they are gonna do what ONE championship is doing, 1 round muay thai 1 round MMA. So much for “never been done”
Dana white would never let this or the canelo fight happen because he only wanted his son conor to get rich of a black men he wouldn't love to see a black men make money of a white men or make money together
Tyson is a nice dude
I think Tyson is up for doing this special fighting event with Frances because of the shit treatment he had with the UFC and Dana white with the shameful payments he got for winning the title. He wants to chuck him a good payday
"America made you a superstar".  FFS!  He made himself a superstar.  What a wanky thing to say.
Landed like a peach
Honestly it's a good pay for francis. He won't win, but at least he'll be respected in boxing by being  paid for his effort. And who knows he may even have a brief career in boxing.
Fury and Francis both deserve the big payday, but I'm not all that thrilled to see them fight. I'd rather see Fury keep going for a few more fights at least to really solidify his legacy.
Frank Warren in the background, thinking WTF...🤨
I’m confused is he retiring or still fighting! Or was talking about cock🐓 fighting?
Dana be like   THATS FUCKING ILLEGAL
il be honest, if anyone from ufc was gonna fight tyson i think francis is the best for it, stipe too small, jones too skinny , tyson would control him easy.
As long as Francis is in the UFC that fight Will Not Happen unless they line Dana White's pockets with money.
It’s funny how these British boxers defend their title 2 or 3  times and they retire as the greatest of all time pathetic
Dana white watching this is fckin illegal !!  😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a personality Tyson has... Apart from his greatness in the ring the guy is a pure showman. This fight will be huge. Very easy predictable Fury win, but let Francis get his check, plus his power is unmatched and if somehow he connect a shot it will be interesting.
Francis will regret that decision for the rest of his life.
Him retiring will be robbing the boxing fans as we will never know who the real guy of this era is. There are a number of guys better than Wilder and Whyte who Fury should fight instead of retiring - Usyk, AJ, Joyce and even his buddy Parker are all guys who will stand a better chance to beat him than Wilder who was on average lighter, than Usyk for the AJ fight, in his 3 fights against Fury or Whyte who has no timing and cardio to harm Fury. Let's see the WBC champ tested by people who are closer matched than these mismatches henhas been fed all his career. Although it was a boring fight his win against Wlad is his most creditable but the division is littered with guys who can test him more than all the guys he has faced.
yeahh men francis it will be an amazing oponent..
Wth. Is he saying speak English Frankenstein fury
I think he just want Francis to get a real pay day. Eight figures style.
I'm not a big fan of these crossover fights but if there's one man that deserves the payday it's Francis Ngannou. The man seems like a genuinely nice guy and we all know UFC/MMA fighters don't get paid like they deserve. Seeing Ngannou get the payday will be nice.
Francis would kill fury in an MMA fight ahaha
Very Kind of Tyson Fury to give my man scary Ngannou an opportunity for a big pay day after the greedy Dana White keeps such great fighters on peanuts and sucks their soul.
A boxer calls out an mma fighter to box…shocking! Why don’t you call him out to actually fight in the octagon, see how that goes 🤣
TYSON FURY MIGHT BE FROM BRITIAN BUT HE HAS IRISH BLOOD......GRANDPA/AND FATHER FROM IRELAND BARE KNUCKLE CHAMPS IN IRELAND
Im sorry but hes gonna get toyed with in boxing.
Top
Lol Francis should just relinquish the UFC title spark out some dude for his last fight then go fight fury and make 50 million $
Guess that's the only way for them to make big money nowadays
I like how people are trying to get each other big paydays now. It's crazy.
GONNA BE THE BIGGEST FIGHT EVER
Hands down the best heavy weight of this era.
Good sports
WOW.He done 6rounds of WORLD CHAMPION BOXING He look more like he been playing with his 6kids n now going to PARTY!
Did Tyson Fury just say he was 170 lbs!? That's absolute *BS!!*
Mike Tyson 🤣
I’ll buy the ppv
Francis is leaving the trenches for good after this fight🥺🥺🥺🥺 payday is going to be massive
I’m sorry but Tyson really is out his mind Francis will fold him the Fuck up Dillian def sold that fight ain’t no way that weak ass upper cut put him out please stop
Francis will decapitate Tyson, despite what everyone says💥
Something tells me Dana has no interest in this.   Will never happen.
132,000 they'll get more then that for boxing the biggest crowd ever in any sport
Wait,... Did Tyson fury say he was 170 pounds? TF!!
That fight should be in North Korea another first
🔥👌
What do you guys think about adding clinches and elbows as options in addition to the 4oz gloves? I think it could  even out the skill sets between Fury and Ngannou but want to have some discourse.
Fury made me love boxing again. TYSON VS FURY
Whyte took a dive. You can clearly see it!!!
Boxing match, with mma gloves?  Heavyweights?😯  could be interesting 🤔.
Same one that hot him years ago
Mike Tyson 😂😂😂😂
Tyson will bake francis but I like to see the fight
Fury jumps from bullshit to bullshit, contradiction to contradiction. Gotta be the easiest liar there is.
Los dos son  unos paquetes
Francis don’t seem to like fury. Fury shouldn’t give this man a payday. Fury likes him too much Francis doesn’t
Francis doesn’t look as short as I thought he would standing next to tyson
Fury can scrap Francis has a slim chance  Very slim.
This fight will never happen. Dana White won’t let Francis fight anywhere else, and if Francis leaves the UFC the fight becomes pointless… everyone knows if they box Tyson will make him look silly
Tell Tyson Fury to RAPPER ROCK-SOLID! Tell him to fight me! Someone mean, aggressive, fast, explosive, with knock out power who wont let him think or breathe. I wont play no games with him.
Hi guys, can anyone tell me what Fury said to Ngannou? It seems Ngannou didn't understood what Fury was saying and neither did i???
If I ca bring back time. I want tyson Fury to fight with iron Mike.
“In the octagon or ring” we all know the answer to that
Fury is a great entertainer with an unusual/unique presence in the ring.  He's definitely an enigma for an opponent,  but fighting Nigannou would be a huge mistake for him. Quit while you're miles ahead lad!
He's already playing mind games with Francis, but putting his arm around him an being buddy buddy, Francis has no chance
"Have ye got a big corey?" "Huh?"  Tyson had me rolling with laughter with that one catching the big man off guard
Francis Ngannou vs. Tyson Fury(Cage Fight=Francis Ngannou) (Boxing match=Tyson Fury). Simple........
Francis can win this fight...
Have got a big Cory WTF. I see some memes coming from that 🤣🤣
Its probably gonna be just punches (from waist- up) but with mma gloves. I think ngannou is going to win because with those gloves its much more similar to ufc than boxe tbh. Close one probably tho
What did Tyson ask Francis, have you got a big what? (Not what I think it is, is it???)
I didn't even hear about Tyson having a fight
Why tyson not fight usyk?
Ngannu doesn't have a chance. None.
If Francis touches once it s over
Fury likes Francis, I'm sure he really wants to help the lad get that huge pay day
Congrats to the Gypsy King! Ngannou'll surprise the world again🥊
🔥
Ngannou said, "2023" at the end. Just in case you didn't hear it. 😎👍
From easy points wins to straight k.os say no more job done
Fury trying to bless Ngannou lmfaooo what a guy
Better be calling out the winner of joshua vs usyk.  Dont bullshit the sport or the fans.
i am tired of gimmick fights.
When Fury is messing around asking about his BBC.....🤣😂
Should fight Ngannu in WWE
Part of the reason boxers don't try to enter the octagon is because they're risking their boxing career if they break a leg or something. If Fury decides to fight in the octagon, it'll make sense since he said he was retiring from boxing
I have no idea what Tyson said either, and English is my first language.
Tyson fury asking Francis if he's got a big dick? Weird
We all love Tyson Fury. He’s charismatic, unabashedly himself, respectful, skilled, well-spoken, and has been through the lowest of lows. How can you not respect that?
It's hilarious. Some boxing grounds get these crowds every week!!!!!
How the fuck wikipedia says francis is 193 cm when hes almost same height as tyson here?
Fury is a class act!
MMA gloves would be awesome between them
Francis is the most juiced fighter u can find... so good luck with that.
This one could be very intriguing.... can't wait 💥
Will A.J have the bottle to  fight Fury....No
Haha awkward moment. You don't ask an African man about his dick hahaha
Shoutout to fury for showing live to Ngannou he deserves it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 pushin 🅿️
I love this gypsy king men absolut inspiration this men all respect for the CHAMP no doubt about it extremely sempatik this mother fucker
“Have you got a big corey?” 🤣😂☠️
You can see Francis trying REALLY HARD to be mean lol
Ngannou would put Fury in his place, I think. Difference in dedication.
"have you got a big Corey " Tyson Fury
They cut the last quote at the end. Went like this “That is no small thing that you just saw there folks, Francis Ngannou… has a giant Cory”
Have you got a big Corey 😂😂😂
I thought you were gonna go sit your ass down!  Boy, money talks.
The battle of the balds… this is gonna be epic.
Dana is not happy of this appearance of francis.
Good stuff at the  end
We just witness greatness..
The two baddest mf’s on the planet
With MMA gloves Francis has better chance but I can see Fury connecting a lot!!
Should do mixed rounds, 1 round boxing, 1 round MMA and keep rotating
Respect
Unless Fury steps into the Octagon, we already know who the baddest mofo is. So... Would be a good match tho.
Not sure what Fury wants to demean himself by doing this, but then again, there is probably a TON of money in it for him and its an easy fight, but why bother?  oh well.....Good luck on this....I won't be paying a dime to watch it.....
What are the odds Mike Tyson and Tyson Fury would both get a win in the same week!
3:50 Well, when he hears the name Tyson, we know who this guy thinks of immediately. Mike Tyson.
Stay in your lane Francis. Unless you just want a payday, then kaching kaching
2023 oh boy
Didn't realise how big that Francis was
Fury trash frfr he’s only on top because the whole heavyweight Division sucks.
He’s really gonna duck Usyk smh
Dan White screaming somewhere. ..."That's fking illegal "
We apologize for the language lol smh
Francis doesn't stand a chance. By round 5 he will be gassed out eating hard stiff jabs.
I love francis but i think he have no chance against fury skills
Wow for once francis ngannou actually looked small near tyson fury.
To be fair, I think Ngannou could put up a better fight than dillian did
Easy money for both
iam happy that francis is getting this fight against Fury.. i am sure dana is in a coma right now/...
Is fury really 6’9??🤔
have  u got a big cory🤣🤣🤣🤣
Red Panty Night for Ngannou is imminent.
Cudnt see the fight ever happen fs its all talk. Its like D.C vs lesner.
I know fury wants him to get him paid what he deserves respect to him was never about the money but always about helping others where he can true LEGEND of the sport 🔥🔥🔥🥊
This is no more about professional boxing it’s all about business
Thought he was retiring? 5 minutes later...in fighting the UFC champion   It's not the same tho, he'll be wearing UFC gloves 🙄 totally not the same thing
What did they edit out at 1:08?
Cringe
Tyson is such a salesman.  Small gloves on Tyson is a problem.
Nooo I want fury to unify all the belts before he retires please furyyy please unify just one more fight please king 👑
Hey DBN looks like Tyson had some doctored gloves again eh?
Dana White was fuming.  He probably was like, "How dare my slaves try and earn legit professional athletes,  what the hell is he thinking!😡🤬😡
😎
hard not to make that fight after this. make it happen
Im watching the fight. But Francis is going to be like punching bag to Fury
Why are we entertaining this cross sport bullshit? Boxing is having the piss taken out of it. One of the best sports in the world will be ruined soon if we keep this madness up. Connor / Floyd was the start of a snowball of havoc
Have you got a big Corey 😭
Tyson Fury makes more money for Francis than Dana White ever do
I am an American but this man is one of the best heavyweight champions we have ever seen, not just because of his skills but his personality and they way  he carries himself! Good job Tyson, you deserve this!🎉🎉🎉
How is francis same height as fury
How on earth can you ask Ngannou to apologise for swearing 🤬 😃
MMA fighter’s taking on boxers inside a boxing ring never goes well for the MMA guy. BUT Ngannou’s power gives him a shot as long as he manages his stamina well.
"Landed like a peach" wtf 😂 😂
Francais ain’t got that banter looooooooooool
Tyson Fury should fight Ngannou by MMA rules, that way Ngannou will have a chance and wont be a dull fight.
Whyte just been ate for breakfast . Easy cash
Well, we know Francis is officially sticking it to the UFC.
Mma gloves in a boxing match cmon now why can’t we just keep some things original smh
Big middle finger to Dana
Should pay Francis 25mil!
LMAO.. buddy could barely understand Fury ,,
Fury dont be foolish put him in any mixed martial arts with this guy he gets destroyed,put on ufc gloves I'm worried he could end furys life,stay retired.
If they're gonna fight it better not be boxing or MMA. Rumble the new middle ground sport is the way to do it. Boxing with elbows, spinning backhands, Superman punches, extended clinches knees,, 6 Oz gloves, and eight 2 minute rounds. Make it happen. Tyson is scared if he isn't willing to fight in a middle ground match.
Congrats tyson Fury. Sakarang eranya tyson Fury. After...  Ali, Iron mike. Tyson Fury number 3. Dia legends baru.
How is Francis that tall !
I want to see that Fury vs Ngannou fight!
Tyson Fury is such a cool dude, bigging up Francis like that. Francis is a boss and needs to get paid, Tyson doesn't need that fight for anything, he's been set for life for years.. good on him for setting this up. Fock Dana White for not making this happen for Francis. You won't pay the guy let him go get paid elsewhere. Cont.
If tyson hits with 4 Oz gloves he is going to put Franny in orbit
https://youtu.be/l0l5nlMy6PI
tyson face when ngannou brought up mma gloves 💀💀 i love both of them but mma gloves or boxing i think tyson will win
Both good fighters but money on Francis
Dana White punchin the air rn
it sad that tyson fury and john ruis called a champions..boxing is gone and dead  after  mike tyson ,holyfield ,lenox lewis..
Graet Tyson Fury
Fury will bounce that little head off the canvas in a boxing match
This goes to show you the type of Chin Wilder has
Great fight Tyson
So we're talking mma gloves in a boxing ring, with no kicks or takedowns. Sounds like another boxing fight with extra steps. I'm sold.
Yeah what a fight lol possibly the greatest heavyweight to ever put on boxing gloves verse a ufc fighter. Tyson doesn’t even need to train but it would be awesome to see another ufc guy get paid. I’m still convinced that Mcgregor and mayweather got together and decided  to created a heated rivalry so they could both get paid. Conner knew he was going to lose but for a 100 million I would fight Tyson fury
Tyson to good man first round ko by fury to franis
He needs too fin aj or usyk nd he resign
He’s a real champ.    Freaking  legend.
What a legend
Nice seeing Francis there. Gypsy King is surely a kind man
If its boxing then francsis won't last 2 rounds with fury
it's gonna be a show not to miss.. Imo
I just have no interest in this fight
Damn nganou is that big?
No way should this guy get a title shot when he hasn't had a single boxing match  SMH.  If they want to do it jist because then do it and call it something else. Just don't call it a title match
espn(disney) apologize for "improper" language, but allows gays kissing in all their tv shows. pathetic
I really want Francis to get that payday, he has struggled so much, he deserves it
Fury don't need to fight mma, its sad at this point
3:13 😂
Sign the contract big boy. -mike tyson to bob   Sign the contract big boy. - Tyson Fury to francis 😂
Tyson Fury is a tool of and being used as a tool to sustain racism....howcome this clown is calling out weak black heavyweight boxers he can manipulate to throw matches and yet he is ducking WORTHIER opponents such as OLEKSANDR USYK AND JOSHUA...
Francis gonna get paid bank if this fight goes through
Fury just put your ass in front of Joshua once and you'll get to know, who the real boss is
Who lol ? all about the ££££££
Fury 6'9, Ngannou 6'4🙃, Ngannou is like 6'6
Huh?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Asking ngannou if he had a big d!ck 🤣🤣 he knows the answer already
lets be honest ,francis will destroy Fury 😅
So…. We won’t have a unified champion on this generation? 😔😔
Francis will be tried in 2nd or 3rd round but at least he will get paid 💰
Wtf does Tyson say at 3:17
Unrelated but this fight is fixed and planned ✌🏾
Dana White hating this video 😂
British boxers speak the best, so articulated
Francis lugana not a boxer but if he hit Tyson fury he knocking his ass out
Fury simple want Ngannou to get paid for what is he. That is why Fury promoting Ngannou.
Fury will carve up Francis.
He’s gonna eats and shits  Tyson 😂
the respect between Ngannou and Fury is great
Creo q no hay competencia contra Fury en reglas de boxeo pero una mano de Francis es como la coz de un caballo
Francis want mma gloves cause he think it would be easier to knockout Fury, but that can go both ways. If this hybrid match happens, It'll be interesting to see who takes it cause of the different gloves.
Francis gonna gas out quick and get embarrassed by Tyson … they still didn’t understand that boxing is a marathon / mma is a sprinting… Francis has heavy weight power punches but doesn’t have the cardio, Tyson has power punches and can throw them for 12 rounds .. and I don’t believe that inside 4 rounds Francis can catch Tyson … after the 4 round is happy hours for Tyson
If you want to know tyson said to Francis he said have u got a big tori meaning have u got a big 🔨
His dad trow a bear over Dylan should never be aloud in anthor boxing match in his life ridiculous behaviour from the old man that should no better
A Son, A Husband, A Father, A Brother, A Champion and what appears to be a man you just want to be around because of what you can learn from him. To be able to hang out in his inner circle would be winning life's lottery. Here! Here! Champ! One of the greatest of all time! You earned it sir!
UK camera screw is too good with the angles
Fury calls out Ngannou while at the same time announcing his retirement, WTF.
Has he got a big Corey!!! HAHA only  romanichals will know that 😂 he's black course he has
This fight will make so much money
It's all been planned so he can get 100mil for the next fight
Dana make it happen
Who leaves undisputed on the table?
Stop fu cking about Fury v Usyk then Fury v AJ
Fury really asked Ngannou about the size of his cock LMFAO
can someone help me, isn't tyson 6.9 and ngannu 6.4? they looked almost the same height
It's time for Usyk vs Fury... not these games Mayweather does
Have you got a big Corey 🤣🤣🤣
Fk Nigannu, he don't deserve a fight with Fury. Gypsy King smashed Whyte but we all knew that would happen
aaaaw he's trying to make the brother some real money. furys a nice bloke lmao
Dana White is yelling at the TV lol
The ONLY reason he's retiring is to avoid being completely and utterly embarressed by Usyk to such a point that he not only loses but the fight turns into a clinic where Usyk actually exposes him for the awkward, slow and uncoordinated fighter that he is. Tell me something, Mr. "I've done everything in boxing", how have you done "EVERYTHING" yet your not (& could never ever be) the undisputed champion of the division. Did he forget he doesn't even have all the major belts!  I mean, in one of the sloppiest performances in recent memory, this wannabe took out a giant idiot who recently lost to a 40+ year old Poverkin only a couple of fights ago. Otherwise, he also twice beat a one shot wonder with absolutely zero boxing skill and slightly more than zero boxing training. Yeah, he's a real all-time great! I can see it now..Hall of Fame, here he comes..yeah right, too bad it'd only be for the WWE's... maybe, if even that.
Tyson wants that celebrity boxing money! Said fuck this super competitive shit with Oleksander Usyk, I'm trying to get paid and leave with my brain.  It's cool I don't blame him.
Ngannou is a different monster
Look at the shoulders of the Tyson Fury sheesh all that power compared to Francis wow
Yeah Francis might be a bigger puncher, but he would never beat fury in a boxing match
Have ya got a big corey
Francis should do it for the payday but Tyson is gonna mop the floor with him
Francis about to get bank!
Sign the contract big boy sign the contract
Legendary Tyson fury
Sign the contract big boy !!!!!!.........Iron mike 😉😉😉😉🤣
That fight is going to be amazing 😩😩😩
Mr PL4Ndemic loves Tyson Fury.
Lmao Torry huh yeah he probably got a good hammer on him haha
Those are two good humans  God bless both
The only person in the world who doesn't like Fury is Wilder.
That's gotta be Tommy Furys real dad, cmon are you kidding me ? Lol
If fury 6’9 Francis  look about 6’7 6’8
This guy is quality
Did the interview just call Fury Mike Tyson lol
FURY: 'Have you got a big Corey?'... HAHAHAHA!
If it's MMA gloves then it's Francis all day!🤷🏽‍♂️
How is Francis and Fury same height, Francis is 6'4 Fury is 6'9
Carl froch will have to make a comeback, there were only 80,000 at Wembley for his fight.
Go for Undisputed
did you see the lowe fight? ref did nothing.
Little Francis will get paid, but he has to get a twice hard Bang for it.  Once from Fury’s glove and then once when lands on the floor….
Tyson will crumbled when Francis connects on the chin with the UFC gloves....it will be power he has never experienced before
Cyril would stand a better chance...
I thought Francis was 6”4 but standing next to Tyson he looks around the same height as him
Hybrid fight? 1 round boxing then MMA and so on? If it's like rodtang and DJ would be sick
Tyson Fury: have you got a big corey 😅🥴
His legacy isn’t finished until he fights Joshua.
Explanation for Francis' look of disgust after Fury asked about his "Corey" in front of millions of people: This kind of question only comes from people who aren't black. To blacks, other cultures' fascination with their genitalia is considered g@y in generall. And white people (in particular) have a very rich history of homosexuality. It made Francis uncomfotable- and understandibly so. 👑
I'm paying for the Francis vs Fury fight.💰
great fight but dont fight Francis with MMA gloves unless your doing  10    3 second rounds.   use some 12 oz gloves. who knows . let these warriors figure it out i suppose lol. gonna be a scary fight if they blend the sport.  francis wanted to be a boxer ,  let him come in with boxing gloves , either way il be watching
Legend ,GOAT,people's champ Tyson Fury
you have too use something brother againts them😅.....
Ngannou stand no chance with light gloves, Fury hit pretty hard with big gloves imagine with light gloves? lol but it will be entertainment to watch
Boxer rules Francis would last 6 rounds with Fury  MMA rules Fury won't last a round with Francis.  MMA is is filled with quick assassins
Fight was rigged
Imagine if fury had muscles how much more he could be dangerous.  Ali vs fury
Boxing u can turn around and the fight stops….Francis would body him in a all out fight let’s be real
What a fucking tube. Undisputed clearly next fight and rthis DOSSER calls out a fat boy from MMA WISE UP !!!
That upper cut Tyson Fury hit on Dillian Whyte was pure class. Whyte didn"t know what happened 😂😂
Great win for Fury but he needs to unify the belts in order to solidify his career
i hope francis didnt break his contract by stepping into that ring and saying what he did
Make your mind up. Is it final fight or you calling this?🤨
Fury:Take them high heels off
Sugar Hill loves taking his shirt off.
Tyson fury is a monster who looks like Humpty Dumpty. 😂
I don't like this boxer v MMA rubbish. It's just cynical to earn money. If Fury stepped into the octagon, he wouldn't last a minute.
Red panty night incoming for both
Fury don't need hybrid fights, if the man wants to test his boxing skills he comes to King's Court, not the other way around.
Tyson 6’9, Francis 6’4. Who’s lying?
Cool
wosh da badast modafoka on da planet
That fight needs to be boxing gloves not mma gloves.  Mma gloves means fight would end really early and ruin the whole thing.
Release Francis today El Cheapo Dana White and let the man make history !  YOU GOT THIS FRANCIS 💯 !
Honestly I hope Tyson fights one more time to get all the belts and then retire.
Fransis wasn’t understanding shit Tyson was saying hahaha that thick accent it’s crazy
He is such a gent for arranging all this cash money for Ngannou, who is super-underpaid by UFC
I did not like GK in the beginning , but the more I know him, the more I like him .
3:51
They should do a stand up mma fight
have u got a big corey ?
He can't retire yet he is only just finding his true knockout power!!! Well done tyson
The still picture of the punch makes it look great. The actual video of the punch isn’t too flattering.
this sport is starting to go WWF .. with the hype and exhibision stuff .. really who wants to watch a pretend fight .. really confusing ..
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What a brilliant perfomance from Tyson Fury he schooled  Dillian Whyte. Congrats Champ on your win victory. You are a great Champion,Fighter,Person,Warrior,Winner. 👏💪🥊🥇🔝😃
100 k. People ?
May God continue to bless Tyson Fury, in the Holy Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Amen
Holy hell all these c**k suckers in here, fury this fury that......🤡😂😂😂😂👍🏻
That interview had me smiling the whole time..
Fury have you got a big Corey Francis be like have I got a big what , nah that’s London talk😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Being the Heavyweight Boxing Champ is way more prestigious than being the UFC Heavyweight Champ! It’s up to the UFC to change it, but Dana White cares more about keeping fights under his thumb
Francis will get destroyed inside four rounds. There’s levels and Tyson is at the top.
Slenderman should call out good and tall Boxers so they can actually fight back
Andy Ruiz is worst matchup for Fury
Fury speaks well and very respectful. Absolute Legend.
The most charismatic heavyweight champion since Ali!
These dumb mma fighters that think keeping mma gloves vs a real boxer in a boxing match is in their favor are dreaming. So Nagano only has a punchers chance to win while fury has every chance to win and also has tiny gloves that Ngano cannot block. Nagano had to quit boxing against his last opponent because he was getting peppered with shots, how does he figure  he will do any better against a real heavy hitter boxer? the only reason the fight gets past the first round is toake it look competitive. ILR tyson KO"s him in the first round. Ngano should call out a Paul.
in a real fight or boxing?
2:52 Ngannou sizes Fury up 🤣🤣
One punch of Fransis connects and Fury goes to sleep. But if he can catch Fury
damn francis looks huge next to fury
Anyone else think this was a fake fight?
big mistake stay away from MMA & Pro Wrestling  & Ngannou
Tyson: Do you have a big Corey? Francis: huh  Tyson: have you got a big Corey? Tyson : starts grabbing his warhammer Francis: smiles and runs
That's how you Make millions out of nothing. Usman wants the same but not getting it
So we're just going to pretend Fury didn't awkwardly ask Ngannou if he has a big d**k? ok
Francis face when he said have u got a big corey 🤣
Who? We want Fury v Usyk
Bruh Fury asked if he’s packin 😭😭 Big PAUSE
Be a awesome clash of the giants, Tyson to good if straight boxing rules, MMA gloves and Triad boxing rules/allows dirty boxing holding and grappling head and neck while striking makes it bit more interesting. Francis would have to be on point with boxing striking and movement and evading/ countering. Should get teddy atlas to help train him for fight .
A fight against Francis would be interesting. Yes Fury would box circles around him but their would always be that one chance Francis lands a shot!
How about a octagon with boxing ropes
Have you got a big corey - Francis don't get our English talk 😂😂😂😭 Tyson the legend
Tyson Fury is the Shaquille O’Neal of boxing
I learnt a new word a big Corey 😆
This was a easy win he lost the same way to Joshua Anthony
When the reporter said Mike Tyson instead of Tyson Fury🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Ave you got a big Corey” 😂
The fact that they even considered letting him continue is ridiculous.   In MMA the fight would have been over the second he hit the mat.
After ngannou gets destroyed he can face wilder for another crazy pay day
Fury is back drinking alcohol,he just said they will go out drinking and partying all night,he said the same thing after his last fight with Wilder and went out partying for several day's. Hes on dangerous ground!
I love it
Did Francis get taller? He didn't look that short compared to Fury at 6'9"!
Tyson is nothing but respectful 👍
Best in Word always Gypsy always..  that's tradición for Gypsy poeple 🥳Viva Gypsy comunity ♤♤♤♤♤
Joshua should move out the way and let Usyk easily out-point Fury for a win.
At 3:15, is Tyson Fury asking Francis if he has a big d##k? I think so, by Francis reaction 🤦🏾 If so, this guy is a weirdo boxer. Dude made the same comment when complimenting Anthony Joshua in one of his interviews.
Can't wait for this to happen. Big money 💰 baby
Big what? 🤔
"have you got a big cory?" LOL. I love Tyson Fury
“Have ya got a big Corey?”💀
Francis want the money 🤑💰💵💸
Did he call him Mike Tyson accidentally? 😂😂😂 3:51
Finally!! Francis can literally retire from the UFC if this fight really happens
Tyson Fury is the most overrated heavyweight in history
have you got a big corey ahhaah
now that's a fight worth paying for. I am afraid it will be fixed because tyson is basically paying Francis. can't get paid and win. Unless the gypsy don't play those games. I think it's beyond tyson and down to his sponsors and promoters
Yes but mma rules are life rules. Fury can only win with hands being exchanged. He would get his power leg chewed up badly in a real fight....no more power punches when can you barely walk.
Two guys just got done beating each other up… but we apologize for the words when they want to collide l
Great to see those two great fighters together. All the best to both!
Have you got a big cory?! 😂
Have you got a big TORAAYY 😂😂😂😂
Hats off to Whyte but… dude was never a threat.  Whyte look like the dude from House Party that was drunk trying to dance against those girls 😂
Haha the look on his face when he said have you got a big corey 🥒
Im here for the shade thrown at Mayweather and Connor😂
Tyson asking him “have you got a big Cory”(big dick) 🤣      Should have said after because your going to need bigger balls!
Fight was rigged.
6 rounds boxing, 3 rounds MMA. let’s do it!
Where does this leave Frank? Furys out of contract
This proposed Ngannou fight is a total nonsense. If Fury is serious about continuing boxing, then fight the winner of Usyk - AJ for the Undisputed World title. As simple as that.
Francis ngannou walked from his country to France, he deserves a good payday big respect to fury for making that happen
The English man did it well ,before you say he is Irishman, he said his capital city of his country, he always said he is Englishman, he just hung around with bad Dublin lads is in that right Daniel, good luck to him 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊what a crouped sport it really is,his next fight is connor McGregor for 2 billion dollars 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁 who watches this crap MMA shit, PS I FLYFISH really misunderstood sport😉😉😆😅😄😃🤣😂😁😀😎🤗😊😆🤩😍😂🤣 just to finish up he is  ENGLISHMAN.  🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮 SIGNING OFF A  IRISHMAN 🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
Tyson is just trying to get his friend paid boxing money instead of that shit UFC money. Seriously fuck off with the boxing  vs MMA fighters, nobody cares . We get it , its a different sport now lets move on.
it's funny how francis could absolutely Maul Tyson with ease irl but will get phucked up by Tyson in the ring
Wtf happened to all the elite American black hvw boxers? I grew up in the 90s, when the top 10 woulda been each been FAR better than this dilyn white dude or whatever
"this is not belly dancing,this is boxing"- Fury 😆😆😆
francis ngannou knocks you out'  he is going to send u to ICU
Won't be watching that shit live anyway.
Tyson Fury and Klitschkos and wilder all looking like photo models after fights what happened here in BOXING
I was about to write that I hope fury will give us a little show by fighting Francis toe to toe a bit... you know a little like Floyd did with Connor Mcgreggor.... then I realised how stupid that would be.
625 Benton Detroit Michigan 48201. Stop threatening me subliminally. If you wanna box come halla at me.😌🥱
Thats a crazy fight, Francis vs Tyson
The fact people think Francis will beat Tyson at all in boxing is like when people believed Conor would beat mayweather 🥴💀
Fury. Do not fight against Francis. Digging long shifts in the trenches at young age can not be replicated.... dangerous power!
I follow MMA and am a big fan of Ngannou, but its just a payday to get hammered. Even Ngannou's boxing in the MMA heavyweight division isn't the crispest so imagine what a good boxer would do, nevermind an elite boxer like Fury.
Why do so many people get in the ring after the fight?
Boxing with MMA gloves, my goodness Tyson is an idiot if he takes the bait, Francis will kill him, you can’t defend with MMA gloves the same way you can with boxing gloves, it will be a very vicious quick KO by Francis and won’t go past 2 rounds. Tyson is a great no doubt, but he won’t be a legend if he retires now, he  hasn’t boxed Parker, Joshua, Usyk, Ruiz, Ortiz, Gassiev etc, he should also rematch Otto Wallin who beat Tyson up real good and was a close match. Tyson is 33, he easily has 3 or 4 more years left in him. Ali fought everyone at the top, no stone left unturned and that is why Ali is a certified legend, this is a premature retirement for Tyson, disappointing if it is the end.
Wow... The Jipsy king indeed.
Francis gets comatosed
have you got a big Corey haha quality
in the word of canelo: "payday... payday..."
He called him mike tyson at the end 😂
"have you got a big corey?" lol proper lad he is tyson
This would have been half the length if they didn't keep repeating the same clips 2 or 3 times
Let’s get Francis paid ! Fury vs Francis for the Galactic world championship!
There’s no way there was 94k people there
Fury should call out AJ, Ruiz and Usyk! But no, he ducks them.
Tyson: I’m retried I’m not going to be fighting anymore I’ve done it all I’ve won every belt there is nothing I haven’t won so why keep fighting    Next Minute: I’m fighting this guy in boxing but with MMA gloves   Ummmmm Ok 👍
Tyson is huge, he's bigger than Ngannou
Tyson is the real deal
Francis won't go beyond R3.
When you order a 'Tyson calls out Francis" on Aliexpress
Fury is Amazing I love Francis Fury will wing this but i will be nice to see Francis in the Ring
Francis Ngannou to Paris Fury: "Hey woman... HEY WOMAN! Listen here, since your old man ain't got no heart, maybe you'd like to see a *REAL* man. I bet you stay up late every night dreaming you had a real man, don't ya? I'll tell you what, bring your pretty little self over to my apartment tonight and I'll show you a real man."
What kind of fight will it be has to be a boxing fight what other rules os either boxing fight or a mma fight 🤔
We don't want see Francis man! How stupid makes no sense, you fight fight aj usk winner
Stop cherry picking fury fight the top guys
Que simpatia e que forma mais correta, alegre e linda de se promover uma luta! Adversários não são inimigos....
either fury is lying about his height or francis is taller, or maybe because of his boots
"Come here Francis, have you got a big Corey" 🤣😂
Stop avoiding AJ and Usyk ffs
That would be like watching a marathon runner compete with a sprinter in a marathon. What is the point of that?
I don’t know. Francis connecting on fury with tiny gloves could knock his head off
IS A GOOD LOOKIN CHAVY IN't HE ?
OMG the comments  ..... you already have Ngannou groupies and combat sports casuals and noobs saying he hits harder than Wilder (Wilder hasn't even used 4oz like Ngannou! He would KILL people!), that Fury knows he will lose to Ngannou and that he never fought someone like Ngannou (only Wilder 3x and ate all his bombs like they were breakfast), and other such nonsense.  LOL the buildup is going to be atrocious .... it's gonna be like May Mac all over again ... people on both sides bickering nonstop over something that is so obvious in terms of the outcome, and the MMA groupies thinking he has a chance just because of his power and 4oz hybrid gloves rules   FFS BEHAVE  Mark my words: Ngannou swings wild and whiffs for 2 rounds, gasses and gets ko'd in the 3rd or 4th by any punch Fury wants to use and land.
Not just a champion legend boxer but I bloody really nice guy, he is nice to everyone he has a really great heart, Congrats Tyson I wish you and your family nothing but greatness thanks for letting us witness history in boxing 🥊 🥊 🥊
Tyson fury vs ngannou in bkfc
So the truth is FURY respects francis.
Whoever is reading this comment I just want to say I wish you luck and I hope you have the best 2022 ever
HAVEYAHHH GOT A BIG CORREY?  Tyson's already started with his mind games.
I can fight fury, usyk, joshua in one nihht. No problem, heeey
This is sport so why do they keep apologising for swearing when you can watch films with words so much worse.
Shit you don't realize just how big Fury is until you see a monster like Francis next to him. Obviously Francis is lean but god damn Tyson's torso is 10 feet wide.
Ayyyyy look at the love! This is what fighting is all about! What a champ. I loved this
The Joshua fight would be the fight Tyson Fury should have before he retires. That fight would solidify him as a Boxing “god” if he should win!
6'9 vs 6'4
Oh why not lol, give Tyson another payday! And how good for Francis to get a real payday!!! Good stuff
Imagine actually wanting to fight Francis Ngannou
Ngannou can only fight 5 rounds - Tyson fights 12 - Ngannou is the same height a Dillian Whyte - Ngannou is worth $4 million, Tyson's net worth is $154 million.   Tyson got $38 million for this fight alone!   Ngannou isn't fit to lace Tysons boots!
Fury is not the Greatest Boxer of All Time but he is 1 of the Greatest Personalities in Boxing of All Time
Tyson would smash ngannou in the ring and vice versa in the cage but yeah nice pay day for ngannou regardless
RESPECT DODE
All respect to Tyson
Woah! Okay Francis is a huge dude! I honestly, was always of the view that Tyson fury would dwarf him in terms of size! But nooo! If they could pull it off, it would be one hell of a fight! Both guys are huge! Whoever lands first wins!
Fury wants to put money on that guys pockets.
Hopefullt Francis get a huge paycheck but it would be an embarrasment competition-wise, Francis doesn´t even know how to throw a jab properly
Look at Francis man, he look so imposing reminds me of brock lesnar
Nganou is apparrantly 6'4 and Tyson 6'9, I knew Tyson was lying about his height
Francis is nearly as Tall as Fury whow
The type of fight tyson and Francis are having with the mma gloves is exactly what I think Connor and mayweather should have been. They should just create it as a crossover sport for both boxers and mma fighters
Bruh Tyson fury is not 6 foot 9, Francis is 6 foot 4 and is at max 2-3 inches shorter
U fools seen Francis fight right .fury is the baddest .but Francis puts him down .u think the fighters in UFC ain't badass .Francis first round knock out .fury goes down .never been hit by a beast like Francis . spoiler alert boys. Sorry
I never realised Ngannou is such a massive animal!
did tyson just ask if ng was packing? hahaha
He called him mike Tyson 😂
Big hustlers
Ngannou didn't like it when Fury asked if he had a big dick 😂
Cmooon fight Usyk or Aj then retire
Tyson Fury is an angel 😇💯
Good.
Dillian was a let down was no wilder fight Tyson schooled him all the way Dillon’s look like he was pissed and just wanted to congrats Tyson the hole fight by putting his arm around him instead of punching him in the face
Dana white really pissed right now
Fury is not undisputed champion, he did not win Usyk, Joshua.
Everytime dillian lost was by an uppercut
Francis is gonna give that money right back to Cameroon ❤️
Francis spent half his fight purse to buy those front row tickets
they say mma gloves in the boxing ring, tyson fury is tyson fury but, flush hits from ngannou is like getting hit by a mac truck each hit lol They each hold a chance of knocking each other out, I give him a better chance than wilder lol
And ur telling me ngannou is 6'4
Fury's dad is supporter of Red Star Belgrade
Tysons face when Francis said it’ll be a hybrid match with mma gloves lol
Ngannou is much stronger chap…
Ahh he's at the calling out the non boxers stage
Francis hits harder than wilder
Wtf did fury ask francis at 3:17 ???
francis physique is fucking crazy and hes not on juice he's bulk like a fucking pro bodybuilder lol its crazy. But tyson would kill him in a boxing fighter
The best performance of the night goes to that microphone 🎤 you can hear him talk so clearly like he was in a studio
Wtf did fury ask him???
Ngannou is no stranger or abecedarian to boxing himself. He was actually a consummate boxer with a decent amateur pedigree before his foray into MMA. This has all the trappings of an explosive fight. Much respect and adulation to both gentlemen...2 worthy sports ambassadors !!!
They must fight in mma
Fury what an epic win, francis vs tyson, it would be logical for it to be a boxing match, fury would not even agree on an  MMA fight he would be mauled twice over..
Ngannou dis not do a good job of selling the fight here
What a class act
no one at heavyweight in MMA, or Boxing who can beat Fury..
3 or 4 rounds boxing, 1 round kick boxing, 1 round mma should be fair
He won’t be good looking by time Tyson’s finished with him! Got to be one of the best of all time! Well done 👍 mate!
Francis won't make it to six rounds
Francis could just pick tyson up and slam him
There's still time after the Joshua vs Usyk match to fight that winner for All the Belts. Then in mid 2023, they could do Tyson vs Francis match. 👀
Have you got a big cory on ya lol tears
Likely he only man currently capable of actually making _Fury_ cautious. _Fury_ still prevails as he will be too smart to allow _Ngannou_ to land telling punches. _Fury_ is the best heavyweight of his generation, at least, and probably has trouble finding ways to motivate himself to continue fighting. *#Boxing** **#TysonFury** **#FrancisNgannou** **#FuryNgannou** **#HybridFight*
Francis is massive !
Have u got a big Cory? Tyson kills me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not only one of the best heavyweights ever but a absolute champion of a bloke.
Finally Francis is gonna get the check he deserves so excited for him.
Now it should have been time for Fury vs Joshua
This is a true sportsman, good luck to you always, and your family
Cool
We all know whos gonna win. But we want to see how tyson school francis
I bet JON " STEROID USING PIECE OF SH*T" JONES  Is fuming right about now Knowing Francis is gonna make more money than any one of his fights!😂
Tyson fury doesn’t need to hate you to fight you, which is scary..
Dana White crapping his pants 😂😂
Francis is a cool guy in his ring but if you jump this ring . Hmm mate you will spit blood 🩸 all over the ring . 🤷
Have u got a big corey tyson fury is 2 funny 😄 😆 🤣
Francis has freakish power, but his technique is poor. His cardio is poor. He won't be able to touch Fury. Big money for both though.
Have you got a big dorry lol
Ain't he retired?
Francis have you got a big corrie lol
Francis wins that one👌💪
Boxing but with MMA GLOVES!? NO CHANCE ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE! BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE IT LIKE THAT! & LOOK AT TYSON GIVING FRANCIS THE BIGGEST PAYDAY HE'LL EVER GET!😇😊 THERE'S ONLY ONE TYSON FURY!   ♥️ 👊G🥊Y🥊P🥊S🥊Y🥊K🥊I🥊N🥊G🥊 #HEAVYWEIGHT#KING
Have you got a big tori,lmfao
Tyson will 100% Outbox Frances as well  in a boxing ring.
sugar never fail me. that shirtless celebration is gold.

I'd have paid good money to see the look on Dana whites face when tyson called over francis 😆
So great job, Tyson dirty ignoring all questions hahaah
Fucking Gentleman .
top top man God bless him 🙌🏿👊🏿💪🏿
tyson fury I said it 8 years ago I'll say it again fury will retire undefeated.  and will bank me alot of $😊
“Modern day history”  in other words not the best all time. Numbers not better than Mohammads stills
Deux grand champions
lmao when Fury asked if Ngannou has a big cock.
Still running from AJ.
"Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved" (Tyson Fury, 2018)
Francis should have said , " its bigger than a bread bin "
“This is not belly dancing” 😂😂😂😂
People really think he's going to retire he's just making his easy money 💰 then fight aj or usyk next year
Ganbatte tyson
What a role model 👏
Fury is listed at 6’9 and Francis at 6’4. They look pretty even here lol
Lmao look at these joker boxing fans 😂 esp this idiot @dan oliver commenting here. The fact is this the only way fury can beat francis is in a sanctioned boxing match 😂 any where and every where else would be a death sentence for tyson fury.
Watt a great sportsman pure gentleman
🤣tyson says it as it is big Cory
He made boxing great again. A fighting machine and a hilarious character
Don't forget that Tyson comes from a gypsy bare knuckle tradition. The little MMA gloves won't be a shock to him. Francis is a tank but in any form of boxing he's just way too far behind to have anything but a puncher's chance.  Now if they include elbows and clinches, or kicks above the waist it's a 50-50 fight. If they include leg kicks I'd favour Francis. Good on Francis for picking up the fight though. Remarkable achievement going from a homeless migrant to UFC champ, and then fighting out his contract against all the odds and UFC pressure. Mentally tough as nails he is.
Fury is 6'9 and Francis is 6'4 according to the ufc but it doesn't seem like Francis is that short ,idk who is lying though.
We love nganou .. but no chance with fury, he s a cardiac machine..    francis is the deadliest heavy puncher but its hard to land a shot in fury’s goose head
Bruh better be careful who he calls out lmao one hit and that's it
Francis is wasting his talent he needs to fight more in UFC and MMA is mix up rules if Tyson fury really wants to fight then fight for real no one is stopping his from boxing in MMA he can use all of his skills and Francis can go all out too
Tyson needs to fight some decent to become a heavyweight great
If he retires after beating dillian whyte he can’t be considered as a great.
Fury asking Francis if he's got a big #### and the last line in the video😂
Lots of yanks are called Cory
Frank Warrens face LMFAO 🤣🤣 "WTF, no one ran this by me!"
And all the deluded AJ fans said he couldn't sell out the stadium and was struggling to sell tickets 🤣🤣🤣🤣 They are the dumbest fans in boxing
Have you got a big cory 😂😂
Francis ngannou appearing to this fight is legendary itself when they realize how strong francis's they are going to see why they delayed with him the strongest punch in the world literally his short punch can knock you dead imagine of Floyd Mayweather starts teaching Francis and gyno had a box at how to be agile with such a big figure you can have all the skills in the world Francis ngannou punches you clean on the chin you're going to sleep it don't matter who you are
Hey Francis...Have you got a big cory ..a big cory (English slang for a cock)  baaaaaahaha 🤣
With mma gloves nganu will murder fury... Dont do this
My love for Tyson Fury has just increased for giving our own Ngannou the privilege of getting paid hugely if the fight is ever going to happen. Love from Nigeria and nuff respect Fury💚🇳🇬
Looks like Tyson actually likes Ngannou
If francis lands a clean shot it's over
Tyson wants a retirement benefits of Ngannou.
Hope he get the fight so he is set for the rest of his life. Let's be honest Francis you gonna get rekt tho. It's boxin amigo. ❤️
Fight ngannou in ufc well see.
Bring on Usyk
Very humble Tyson
I always like to hear his accent 🤣
I remember when we had GREAT BOXERS, now we don’t even have good ones. Sad to see. I hope there will come a day when a higher quality of boxer comes back. This was slow and just unprofessional. Sad, just sad. Waste of time to even watch this video.
Boxing with mma gloves plus legal allowed dirty boxing/grappling is seriously insane but even more so when it's Tyson Fury and Francis Ngannou fighting.  Tyson has the boxing skills but Francis has that serious 1 punch power, especially with mma gloves. The question is can Francis land that punch, if he can Fury goes to sleep and if not Francis gets out boxed and tires out
I'll like to see that fight, crazy man 😎
He's a good looking chavvy! Have you got a big Cory? 😂😂😂😂
I want to see that fight.
Congratulations
If aliens attack, we will send out these two blokes along with Rico Verhoven and Cyril Gane as Earth's champions.
Well I predicted it I predicted round six & I said right from the begging that after 3 fights with Wilder, Whyte would be nothing more than a really good work out for Fury, literally a walk in the park 💯
I could actually see that fight happening because of Francis's legal standing with the UFC, and because Tyson Fury on the boxing side of things will push for it.
'Have you got a big Cory?' - Tyson Fury.  Legend.
Nobody cares about this fight
1once in a lifetime chamion and an man fter gods own heart
Didnt John Fury say he will never see his son boxing again
3:13 I've no idea what he's saying either?..
Tyson go to ufc in fight lol
Mike Tyson's name can never be missed 🤣🤣🤣
Are you scared of aj yeah
Lo key sugar faaaaahbuuuullllooouuuss
Was this at a football stadium?
Bum beating bum
Have you got a big Corry hahah
Have yoiu got a big corey hahaha
Fury vs francis money money money
Fury just want francis to get the biggest PAYDAY!What a great man,God bless FURY
Big what 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sign the contract 😅
as a Mexican pro boxer and trainer I have no choice but to love and respect TF. He is a blessing to our sport. all glory be to God. thank you Tyson
Retiring coz be doesn't want to talk about his pal Dan. I
What a joke fighting bums
Let's gooooooo
Not a fan of Boxing, but Tyson Fury have earned my respect here. A fighter that actually wants to fight regardless of the rule set. Like the Great Mario Yamasaki once said; Let them be a warrior!
Personnally the next fight should be against usyk or joshua for all the belts. I don't want to see tyson wasting his time doing an  exhibition fight against n'gannou.
"... Mike Tyson, Tyson Fury" lmao
Have you got a big Corey? 😂😂
Tyson asking ngannou if he has a big Corey is forever in my mind from now
Is strange look Francis like as a small guy😂
I think dana is right about Francis and the fact that he has a lot of stupid people around him
Froch is crying into his onion rings
if you got guts then fight with mama rule
i love francis but fury is too big wat yall think
Let's go Francis I love both these fighters but my God I hope Ngannou can land a good one, cause he hits alot harder than a Wilder. Cant be losing control with his combos like he did sometimes in the UFC
he looks like drug addict..just the looks.
Frances the bigger D but I reckon Tyson would edge it in the balls 😎
Why give this fcking guy a pay day, what has this nobody done to deserve a payday, besides he will  get completely wrecked by Fury under boxing rules.
Has to be Joshua next it's the fight we want.😀😀😀
I'd say he's the goat but then he's bigger than everyone and he didn't come back from a ban from boxing for standing up against the government like Ali. He also didn't fight guys with a 20 fight record in his debut as a black man in early 1900s America with over 100 fights against every single one of the best like Robinson.  Just wanted to remind people of those two legends. Fury is right up there with them, he's magic, but... Lest we forget.
Big kari .. he hanging with albanians
We love you Tyson Furry and Francis Ngannou
Love Francis but he is a MMA fighter  Boxing is an art  But like mcgregor it can be cool to watch
I think the game plan of Francis against Fury will be the same game plan that was against Rozenstruik :) WINDMILL OF DEATH! https://youtu.be/SOGYnqQkjmc
So yea I'm done, just a little exhibition fight with fucking nganou with small gloves, no danger there.
I can't wait to see Francis knock this clown out 😁
Have you got a big cory. This man is fuckin ace of the pack 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣👌👌👌👌
Like to see the fight everyone has a puncher chance
Have you got a big what ?
Nooooooo!  Don't mix the fighting styles. It proves nothing. I remember Clay/Ali fighting a wrestler, and it was the most ridiculous thing ever.
I'm a big fan of Ngannou but bruh, you gonna gas out by the 5th round, remember what happened to Conor? 🤣
I love both of those guys; they deserve to have some fun and make tons of money.
Fury v Ngannou will be nuts
The best!❤️
Fury stooping to a low hes used to by asking ngannou if hes got a big d##k!! Absolute clown
Have you got a big Corey haha
Man said “have you got a big Corey” 😭😂😂😂😂
they both play it the very smart way. Tyson saiyng that he is done with BOXING, Francis coming out and mentioning some hybrid-rules. So most likely since this will be some sort of bragging rights fight, they just need someone to make it a "floyd-a-like" exhibition match, KO-only, and both will get a niceee paayyyyyyy daaayyyyyy
Fury will smoke him live
Congrats fury
good for francis on the money side of things but jesus unlucky getting in a ring with tyson - that would not be anywhere close to competitive
Francis definitely taller than 6'4" or fury ain't 6'9" or may be both because that wasn't 5 inch difference.
" have you got a big Corey mush"
Tysons in the closet
Mma vs boxing? Now that's actually something special
Stupid interview 🤦🏻‍♂️
3:15 I’m confused like Francis too
See the face on that Frank Warren....he was fuming.....your not fighting this ngannu.....your fighting proper boxers.......n fury was like...fuck you...I'll fight who I want.......
Just fight the joshua usyk winner see whos the best of the ara
3:50 reporter accidentally calls him Mike Tyson and then Fury uses Mikes famous line “sign the contract big boy sign the contract” 😂
You got a big corey
Тайсону с женщинами обниматься только
Dana must be Fuming where he is now 😁😁
Francis has to win by ko otherwise there’s no other way he’s beating tyson
Francis looked like an ordinary, smaller guy next to Fury. Not interested in a fight between them tbh. Too lop-sided.
Tyson Fury. The REAL BIG GENTLEMAN
The face on Frank Warren when Tyson announced fight with Francis 🤢
Have you got a big corey 😄 🤣 😂
Damn! Is francis standing on something 😳😳😳
A right uppercut, again
May Jesus Bless you Tyson Fury. All Christians need to be like Tyson Fury. Always must thank Jesus for all the achievement.
Real recognizes real
They should do a special rules contest like Dj and rodtang on one championship
A Hybrid boxing match with MMA Gloves!? Yes! dream come true for me. For years i wished they created something like "Combat Boxing" with Smaller gloves and you are alowed to use everything on your upper body. Elbows, palmstrikes, spinning backfists, headbutts. It's probably not going to be something like that but it sure as hell sounds exciting.
People need to stop thinking mma “strikers” can box a boxer in the ring. Please just stop.
Have you got a big Corey?
Francis Ngannou in MMA gloves? Would leave Tyson crumpled like an accordion on the floor. Sometimes you gotta know where not to go
Lets Go!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The love and respect what they have..... its next level ❤❤
But he promise to resign why now still want to fight? This next fight he will not make it.
Have you got a big Corey had me creasing, Tyson fury is fucking hilarious. Just went straight over the Americans heads.
All you people saying Francis has no chance are tripping.. neither of these two are jokes. And both can finish in a second
Tyson and nganau should do wat dm n rodtang done in one championship
joshua vs tyson fury
I guess we’re going to skip over the part where Tyson asked Francis did he have a big 😳…Pause
Bah, to me this is a shame over the greatest boxing career. I understand that Fury is bored for the lack of contenders, but why he is searching a fight against a guy that is a weaker version of Wilder?  And with weaker I mean that he is in the overall performance with a worst technique, a worst ring experience, a worst athletic refinement, a worst combo, a worst footwork, a worst 12 round cardio, etc.
"Have you got a big Corey"...love it.
Francis needs Dana's permission
They end up disabled lol
ngannou reaction when he came next to fury ( that madafakaer is big)
Anybody noticed the interviewer calling Francis, Mike Tyson by accident??? 😂😂😂 Racist! 😂😂😂
Only took Povetkin 5 rounds. Povetkin is the real GOAT clearly.
Have you got a big Corey  😆  that's so typical English talk
Tyson Fury Is a legend I love him so so much
Well done Tyson, same way  like Alexander Powietkin
Round 1 boxing round 2 mm they should fight like this
Do we deserve Tyson Fury? What an absolute class act.
Legend 👏
Francis smiling but what about uncle Dana?
HAVE YOU GOT A BIG COREY HAHAHAHAHA
How can ngannou look the same height as Fury when hes only 6"3 inch?
Tyson Fury is huge... Francis looking like a 185er
Mike Tyson 😂😂😂😂
Francis is little boy with Fury 🤣
In my opinion Sugar should be wearing a Fury cap. Sugar seems a little egotistical.
Have you got a big corey 😂😂😂😂😂😂
fury will mount him 😂😂😂😂, its boxing not mma
I'd like to see a fight with the NHL's Zdeno Chara. At least an exhibition. Two of the biggest athletes in pro sports going at it
Hell no, he shouldn't retire until he faces usyk..... that's the big HW fight, usyk has all the other belts.
NGANOUE WILL KNOCK TYSON OUT IN THE 3RD ROUND!  MARK MY WORDS!
Why does it look like they are at the same height?
Je look for money....he need money for do his haire in turkey 🤣🤣🤔.   Francis in boxe Tyson gone kill you bro...back in UFC or go to the one they gone pay you a few more than dana
I love both...fury & nganou very friendly..👍👍👍
Peppermint gloves are a bitch
DO YOU GOTTA BIG TORY SON ?
There's only one Tyson furyyyy... great man!!
Well, Fury will definitely KO Francis in a Boxing Match. But hats up to him, Francis will definitely get the $$$
either Fury is 6'7" or ngannou is 6'7". Noway that's a 6'9" and 6'4" man in the ring
Look at fury promote that fight with ngannou like a true carnie haha what did he say that Francis didn't understand though?
"one more punch and he'd be disabled" idk about that lol MMA guys land multiple, multiple ground and pound strikes on UC opponents that live to fight another day. These cowardly boxers should fight MMA fighters in MMA rules.
Congratulations fury 🤍👍🏼 you're one of the truly box legends
Tyson cohld easily dominate boxing until hes 40. Hes head and shoulders above the rest. Extremely clear. What a story.
Tyson job not done till he fight AJ and USUK, Whyte is a clown and everybody expected he will be buried
Tyson is a bloody top man 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Tyson is beast ,now l admit.
Fucking hilarious
Lol at Fury asking him if he has a big dong haha
If you thought Whytes feet were  slow wait till you see Ngannous.
Fury is just above everyone else nowadays!  I love Francis, but it would/will be a rough night for him…
Why is he black guy topless
Make it happen but with 4 ounce gloves.
Amazing there's no covid problem now? 94,000 !
Let’s see a kickboxing match between fury and ngannou.  Puring boxing - everybody knows Pure MMA - everybody knows Kickboxing? Who knows…
Have you got a big Corey!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Francis gets confused and says "huh"  Tyson - *Pee his pants*
Why’s sugar got his top off?
Tyson Fury is a legend ! love and respect for you Fury for giving Ngannou opportinity to make big money !
Dam right it was 😄😄😄
Who does sugar have his shirt off holding furys belt 🤣
this is amazing…. got a big one???? Aahahhahahaaa
Tyson 94000 people came to see you you are the champ I'd like you to continue but you have earned the right to decide god bless you
Gypsy king we love you
Holy s...! I can't see anybody defeating Fury right now!
Not sure what the rules are going to be. As long as they only allow Ngannou to throw hands, Tyson Fury destroys him. If they give Ngannou kicks however... 4 or 5 hard leg kicks will take away all of Fury's power and footwork, leaving him very vulnerable to shots up top.
He stunned him to fuck with that punch but shoving him to the floor perhaps the referee could have given him time to recover, I'm clutching at straws, i was neutral in this fight but hoped we would see more considering the undercard was terrible
We need this fight
Snore
I truly hope Franics gets to dance w/ Tyson; he has truly earned a big payday.  He hasn't a chance in hell to win, BUT the payday will be nice. Cheers!
3:57 “That is no small thing that you just saw folks” - commentator on Francis Ngannous “Corey”
I hate the british media with their tight ass... i  want to apolagize for the language.... smh. There's only grown ass men watching this.
Make it a kick boxing fight!
Greatest Heavyweight Of All Time!!
Whyte is always out of shape. How can you come in for the biggest fight of your career out of shape? No agility, cardio etc.
Shit show
Tyson is the man
Isn't Francis like 6,4 ? They almost look the same height.
Tyson would definitely beat Ngannou in the ring, but by God Fury should avoid that right hand. Ngannou hits like a fucking freight train.
So nice for Fury to offer a donation to Ngannou.
Props too tyson four giving francis a proper pay day... Lord knows he deserves it
Fury/Ngannou is far more fun than Conor/Floyd, because Conor's power is overrated. Ngannou's lucky punch is a legit danger no matter how large the skill gap is.
Dana pooped 💩 his pants 👖 😳 when he seen that interview lol 😆 😂 🤣
I think it’s probably a kick boxing fight with MMA gloves. I don’t think Tyson will be comfortable with getting taken down and getting ground and pounded, maybe it’s no take downs allowed.
About time!!! Tyson is cured. Let’s make u a billionaire baby!
Make no mistake about it, Tyson can only win in full boxing rules. With smaller gloves Ngannou could probably take his head off.
“This is not belly dancing” 1:32 😂
Good on Fury, he knew that punch finished the fight and didn't need to land any more....
Fury is a kind sportsmanship 👏
"Hey Francis.. Have you got a big Corey?"
i'm an MMA fan but if they fight i hope Fury wins. MMa needs to pay thier fighter fair pay. They are coming for boxers bc of the pay and nothing else.
Look at the views in Top Ranks recent uploads and look at this. Tell me boxing isnt dying with a straight face.
“Have ya got a big Cory” 😂😂😂
“Big what…?” Lol!
Tyson is such a well knowledgeable and spoken person. After a long career, he should be an analyst. The man is humble, funny and loveable.
FRANCIS even didn't congratulate him on  mic, that was very unprofessional. Anyway, it maybe right in some cases. Tyson looks more respectful person  that Francis I think.
Not often the two Baddest Motherfuckers on the planet just so happen to be two of the kindest and most respectful Motherfuckers at the same time.
This fight was boring.
If Francis is 6 5 Tyson looks like 6 7 NOT 6 9 as officially reported
Someone better tell Tyson that it's very hard to slip your hands half out of the MMA gloves. 😂
Tyson fury made us mancs proud last night! Big up Gypsy king 🔥
Francis may not have a chance against Fury. All that muscles makes it hard to go 12 hard rounds. Also, Francis cannot afford to be explosive. Its a plus for Francis that he would have mma gloves. It would be a nice one to see.
Zzzzz. Good to see Francis get paid but it's a pointless fight. Fury gets smothered in mma rules and Francis hasn't a chance under boxing rules.
modify the rules give Fury a 5 min boxing round and give Francis a 5min mma round
Can’t wait to see Mike Tyson vs Francis Ngannou
It landed like a 🍑- Tyson Fury - 2022 Nuff Said! ABSOLUTELY undeniable!
Ngannu is huge.
So the punch was great but then he finishes it with pushing him down......lol then fights stopped lol amazing
That was so hilarious, Fury asking Francis if he has a big "·$%!" and Francis reaction, then the interviewer calling Tyson Fury by mistake  Mike Tyson and Fury's reaction.
It will be a world cup final to watch Tyson vs Francis....
Giant people.
Dana white is red right now
Usyk could stop Fury, but this war fucked it up
I got money on Francis
Don't know why Francis wants to do hybrid rules. Doesn't he want to come to boxing full time and fight the top boxers and be done with MMA forever?
"have ya got a big Corey"  Tyson is dam hilarious, awesome seeing him back on top
Have you got a big coury 🤣🤣🤣
there is no way francis does 8 rounds with those muscles!
Increíblemente a Fury no le faltan músculos por doquier para ganar , tiene una técnica muy pero muy buena y a la vez sus golpes son como de camión , respeto a Francis , pero con ésta pelea más que sigue su WIN , no le veo rival para él
screw the people at the ufc making the fighters fight for chump change and put their bodies on the line for next to nothing.
Triad Combat should jump on this tbh
I hope Dana White gets a stomach ache every time he hears Ngannou's name or  sees  his face on TV😂😂
Two pure-hearted badasses walk in a ring.
great
Fury is kind boxer, he just pushed away Whyte instead of delivering follow punch.
I'm a huge fan of Francis Ngannou and him chewing like this makes me believe he is going to sign the contract against Tyson Fury.
Nganu make the biggest power move on the ufc
https://youtu.be/VmlDOf_Sor8
Well done Tyson keep smashing them down plenty off fights left in you continue you deserve all the glory pal  🥊
So no one is going to mention Tyson's obsession with BBCs? Ain't the first time as well. I hope we won't be having a trans Fury in the next couple of years holding hands with Francis, that would be a major sign of the end of the world
Have you got a big Corey 😂😂  There’s only one Tyson Fury!!!!
It`s all candyfloss - the emperor has no clothes - all boxing fans has been made a fool of - so sad to hear all this fluffy nonsense after the most boring titel fight in history.
MMA gloves... Francis tryna do damage.... I love fury is  one of the greatest champ of all time he wonna put francis in tha big pay check... Congrats champ.
I'm immediate neighbour of Francis Ngannou here in Africa but seeing Tyson Fury getting him paid big (which he deserves) melts my heart, man. Fury is such a kind sportsman.
Francis looked a lot bigger than I thought he would standing next to Fury.
He should meet  Francis Ngannou in Octagon
The best in the west.
Dawty you gotta big cori💀
WTF
That reporter got rattled, what a kook "America made you a superstar" na mate, tyson saved the sport and binned your bronzed bomber.
Neckless JRE fanbros: "Boxing is dead!!" MMA Champs: "PLEASE let me box a boxing champ!!"
Broskis t shirts tighter than an ants pocket
Hats off to fury for recognizing Francis. The UFC needs to take notes
Just an entertaining money maker. Fury would win anything leaning towards boxing and Francis anything towards MMA. Different sport's have different sporting skills. It would take a useless or over the hill boxer to lose to an MMA fighter at boxing likewise the other way around.
Fury Is a legend
Francis doesn't know how to box. He's just wanting to oook for a big pay day. Stop wasting your time on fucking mma fighters who can't box. They need to fucking first prove themselves witg other real professional boxers.
Tyson Fury I never liked his style of boxing, his only serious opponent was Wladir Klitschko. This fight was nothing special for him easy win guaranteed. But the man has got heart in fact the greatest heart in boxing I’d compare him to Ali in this manor. I remember the fight with Wilder where he stood up after a serious knock out and won the fight. I also remember him coming back from depression probably the biggest fight of his life.
I just want somebody to look at me like sugar Hill does at tyson
Lol. In the ring fury murders him😂
The UFC is not going to allow a boxing match between these two and even if they do it in the UFC cage when UFC gloves they're not going to allow just boxing it would have to bring more Revenue than a Conor McGregor fight and that's highly unlikely with Francis,Fury yes but not Francis
What a waste of time. I'd rather Fury chase those other three belts first then call himself the best.
Man Tyson is fucking amazing. He literally giving Francis a payday.
He wouldn't call out  Anthony Joshua  &Joshua Park &Justin Huni how come he not fighting will boxing not ufc bullshit I like Fury just wish that take on boxes for sake of boxing
Tyson “Mike” Fury
One word: PAYDAY
in his final fight, of an unbeaten heavyweight run, theres a moment ....john fury noticed it i bet... he planned it...from the moment little baby tyson fury was in a cot. The interviewer slips up... and calls him "Mike"
Francis will get KOed inside the first and will make more money in 30 seconds than in ten years in the UFC.
needs to fight joyce
Ty looks fresher after the fight than before...what an amazing guy..
How do people think this is real
Francis was no part of Tyson
the respect he showed for dillian whyte , after that  absolutely disgusting boxing on display, just the highlights show two elbows , a huge blow after a break he should have had a point taken for....and no less than 8 deliberate back of the head shots. the ref ran in soon as fury decided he was ging for the back of the head too.... absurd match, whyte shouldnt have been in there...outpaced, outclassed to a level where he literally had to cheat form the frt round to stand any chance.... but for fury o hold his tongue in that momet? show dillian whyte respect that he didnt really deserve on the night. classy. after seeing that desperate , violent nut nut frustration out of whyte? ive lost a lot of respect for him, decent journeyman was revealed to be an arrogant cheating stupid weasel who cant box for shit when the chips are down....just desperately looking for that power god gave him. biggest puncher in boxing couldnt knock him out, how the fk did dillan whyte think he was gonna. its a shame we wont see fury usyk. i reckon fury could get him sparko but it wouldnt be easy.
Ngannou is a humble man didn't appreciate the Big Dick comment  😂
Respect to Tyson Fury for looking to get Francis paid… it’s a good story something different … The two baddest Mfos on the planet I would love it if they went 1 for 1 but a hybrid will do ..
wow so this is what fighting is now lol ......boxers calling out other athletes
I f*** love tyson. Hes so damn funny
DAWTYYYY he rockered da chav about the bora corey
Francis wont make it outta the 5th round. Fury is on another level.
Have you got a big Cory hahaha
Man Fury Is a kind man 👊🙏
The fight world is effing magical
No one was a good boxer, heavyweight boxing looks like it will never be what it was. Fury is beatable in every way with this fight he only used his height to keep his opponent far. Nganou is a different power puncher fury may not escape that.
Yes.. Hybrid rules..,for the Baddest mothafuka on the planet
Have you got a big Cory? 🤣🤣🤣
Shout out. Ka prince tv
2:42 look at those F'ing shoulders.. my god. Wish we didn't age. I would love to see a prime Mike Tyson vs prime Tyson Fury
Fury makes Francis look short but he is still not legit 6.9 probably strong 6.7.
As a man, as a real man that doesn’t like being asked about their piece. He needs to pull him to the side and tell him not to ever do that shit again
Would love to see Mayweather step into the octagon too.  But we all know he doesn't have the sack for that.
Wait I’m sure you just said your retiring?
Wait they fighting in mma rules I’m gonna assume no grappling maybe stand up rules like ufc 4 ?  Interesting honestly now I favor my boy from Africa
Francis will go to sleep, I advise he brings a good pillow!
He's a good 👦
Dumbest fight ever..that's why they have to make up stupid rules.. so they can con all the stupid people into paying $100 for a fake fight..
Ngannou will most likely use the Fury fight as leverage to get a big increase in his UFC contract. Tbh though he isn't really a superstar PPV wise. I could see him signing a one fight deal to fight Jones after Fury.
See this is y I hate Tyson Fury and his fans y is he not trying to fight Usyk!!!!!!
I wish Tyson had his head on straight when it came to his legacy. He is full on in his prime and easily the greatest boxer in the world right now. Another three or so years like this and he’s going down in the greatest of all time conversation. But he keeps talking about retirement, and taking on these freak show type fights. That’s not good for his legacy.
So Tyson ask Francis if he has a BBC and the interviewer calls Tyson Fury "Mike Tyson" wt eff is going on lol
In mma gloves is actually a dope idea. Fury is gonna have his head movement at matrix level to avoid the punches Ngannou throws
Until Tyson’s has all the belts and beats Usyk and Joshua then he hasn’t cemented his place in history.
I love francis and he has become a great fighter in the ufc but if gane can control his striking fury will do it wit ease and it worrys me a bit if the fight happens closely after the leg is healed. Full mma rules be the same fury prolly gettin ragdolled.
Tyson fury is a good dude, He legit made no effort to intimidate Francis only welcome him. I hope they get paid!
Did Tyson ask Francis if he has a big dick?? 😂😂
Francis is an absolute best, but he has no business in a boxing match against Furry!  If you haven't seen Francis documentary, please do. His story is a special one....
I thought he was retiring 😂
Fury is a 💎
Loaded fights in boxing. Top fights every weekend. Next, Valdez/Stevenson and then Canelo/Bivol
Ngannou 6’4, Tyson 6’9 - yet they’re the same height
Do it like what ONE FC did with DJ vs Rodtang. 4 rounds of fight. Round 1 and 3 with boxing rules, round 2 and 3 in MMA rules. I think that should make it so much more interesting.
nice man gj to fury he made that look easy, but he gotta fight usyk or aj :(
Rigged! Boring and all set up!
That black guy wit SUGAR on his hat holdin Tyson’s belt was lookin at Tyson like he wanted to hold more then his belt if u kno wat I’m sayin
Ya this matchup was terribly for whyte, odds for underdog should’ve been +5000, even in 500 matches idk if whyte beats Fury once lol
The look on Frank Warren's face is priceless when he said MMA gloves
francis is taller than i thought, maybe 6'6
Cant wait
Nobodies interested in this foght or the Francis fight.. its just about a payday.
Someone tells Sugar we are tired of seeing that chest of his , if he wants to show us his belly it would be better to pick the gloves and fight.
such a insane fighter.....furys iq is insane.....so fast and just ate him up with the left hook it must have landed clean like 15 times......love it that suga is going shirt less too haha....that's the body of champions rock it!
did he say iam 170 lbs hes 270 lbs lol
Did Fury just ask Francis about his pecker lol!
future undisputed aj or usyk no match on him .the gypsy king 💪💪
Have ya got a big cory ?  lol ........
Wilder king👑👑👑
Have you got a big Cory ? Huh? Lol. He looked so confused haha.
What about joshua fight with fury? Is it possible?
How the hell is Francis almost same height with Fury😂 he looks like he is 6’7
Fury kills francis. It will be like Floyd v Conor. Floyd didnt train and didnt need to.
Lots of casuals saying francis has a chance against Fury. Yes he has a chance, it just wont get past the single digit percentage. Even wilder has more power and better fundamentals than him and fury has a chin of diamond.
You have a big Corey?
Tyson needs to pay sugar Hill a bit more poor bloke can't afford a t shirt.
TYSON FURY IS SCARED OF AJ THAT IS THE REASON WHY HE IS RESIGNING
Mike Tyson ** Lol
Tyson makes Francis look normal sized!
Looks like Fury choose Ngannou as the most worthy UFC fighter to square off after all!!! And Stupid Miocic thought he had a chance 😆
It's a joke, Tyson Fury would light him up.  There's a difference between Connor fighting Floyd, at least the mystic Mac had some boxing skills. Francis you better call Larry Holmes up and spend 6 months in the gym learning how to jab just to make it look interesting.  They need to toss the MMA gloves in the mix, just to have fans buy into the punchers chance push...
Calls out?
This fight is so very predictable and everyone's knows it...what a jokes. At least fight AJ that would be a very good fight...OR Usyk that's the fight that fury will never gonna take cause he knows what Usyk will gives him... period
load of rubbish
Wilder needs to let floyd train him... then fight fury 1 last time.... if not i dont want to see another fury fight
They deserve the success
America didnt make him a super star lets get that right. He was a big name over here long before he beat the dosser wilder 3 times.
🤣🤣😂😂doesn’t answer the question cause if fury said in the cage …he’d be a meme by Monday afternoon 🤣🤣😂
Live on TV " I'm guna find out who's the baddest mother fucker on the planet, '
MMA boxing is not boxing lol
I'm a devoted Fan! FURY IS my Hero
Have you got a big corey 🤣🤣🤣
This whole thing was weird
my God, Francis looks tiny next to this monster of a man
Great guy @Tyson Fury 🤝👍
Tyson fury: 6ft9 Francis ngannou: 6ft4 Me watching the video seeing they are the same height:👁️👄👁️
big cory lol
I thinks its a tragedy that tyson fury never fought at his hometown, Manchester.. I think he deserved one final sending off.. Tyson vs Francis at Manchester would be a fitting end..
why would he call out an mma fighter lol
Tyson fury... just give ngannou a lesson in boxing. And he will understand that boxing not for him.
Everyone else has to pay dana whites fighters… doesn’t dana have any shame?? You’re top world champions have to go around looking for fights in other codes just to get paid what they are worth…
Ngaunu is gonna get paid at least 20x than a UFC fight , win or lose.
Check the champs gloves.  All that cheating straight up caught red HANDED literally and I don't get why Fury's legacy's isn't blemished one bit like he something great. Great at CHEATING!!!!!!🥊😠Did Wilder the great cheat????WTF talk about lame and shame to the whole industry of boxing for forgetting all about that night Fury's GLOVE was far beyond illegal
Get the bag Francis
Fury is the type of guy.. who uppercuts two guys in his life.. Whyte and.. himself also
fine
I love Tyson bringing Francis out...they both know what entertaining IS/CHALLENGE is n that's what we live for🤪😜
Fury by ko 20 sec into round 1
It would have been epic if ngganou and fury did the brock lesnar approach when he wanted to fight cormier. And make a fake beef. But still. Baddest mofos of 2 different sports? Cant get any better than that
Fury,what a good and great guy
This takes Francis to a different level he’ll ko fury watch
This is the most humble I've seen him with his opponent, this was just too easy for him TBH
It won't allow me to give thumb up
They should do one fight in the ring and one fight in the octagon
He said i retire and after that he want to fight francis?
What a joke. I know it was somebody else out there besides Dylan Whyte smh...
Francis will kill fury one punch
That massive uppercut is AJ's signature punch.
One of the take always from this is that Dillian Whyte is probably only 6’1 or 6’2 at most. No way he is 6’4.
Nganu is corny af
Whether you stand a chance against Fury, it doesnt matter. What matters is hes gonna make 25 mil from my guess.
Big Corey hahahhaha
Fury is big that is all
Francis deserves a good payday
Ngannou vs Fury should be in kickboxing
Francis is not a boxer he doesnt know anything he juat through lots of punches with open face he will be get beat up by any boxer out there doesnt need high level boxer
Francis might want to stay with the boxing gloves
he is the next guy to embarrasse UFC with his fans and ego! is he done with ufc soon after won the belt? nothing against him atleast he needs to show he can box with boxer like wilder.
Francis dont stand a chance in boxing against Tyson...
Dana just watched this and destroyed his house over Tysons comments about fighting Francis!? Dana! Get off your wallet Son. Gotta pay Francis 25 million a fight now?
Mike Tyson...mmmmhh...Tyson Fury Francis Ngannou, even the commentator was punched off to see them together at this moment
I will love to see that fight
He is the technical heavy weight boxer of all time
Francis will never be allowed to fight Tyson fury.
Ngannou wouldn’t play wit Tyson fury but his size nd boxing IQ would b what saves him against a beast like Francis
Great show, but that is all it is.
francis KO by 3rd round. Sorry, facts
Tyson will kill Francis in the 1st Round
Fury vs Anthony let's go!! Fury fury fury
I'll like to see that fight
Fury will embarriss franny
He's not getting out of that UFC contract. That's for sure. If he wants this fight the UFC will take at minimum half of his purse. That's the only way this fight happens.
Lame fight,  reminds me of two uncles past their 50s fighting over something that happened in '84🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mike Tyson
NGGANOUUUUU
What about Joshua?
C'mon now let's be real it's Whyte lol been stopped twice prior to this fight there's AJ there's Usyk even Ruiz lol fight one of them Whyte has never been a champion you gonna call your self a legend over this ???? I like Fury but calm down now..
Somewhere in the US Dana White is turning into Dana Red now lolll
Fury’s funny and a cool guy but he’s also already trying to use psychology and play some mind games a bit by trying to embarrass Francis publicly. I don’t think Francis cares about that though because he’s a bad ass of bad asses and just loves to train hard and fight. Fury is the same way. Two absolute monsters of combat sports going to war-It will be an absolute great fight.
tyson is 6ft9 how tall is franics agian ..i thought he was 6ft 3
So these guys are so big they can't find competition in there perspective sports
Francis would do far better than Whyte and he's not even pro
If they use MMA gloves then fury gone have to bring it, I’ve worn both and let me say this, you don’t have to be a boxer to beat a boxer with MMA gloves, one slip up and 💀⚰️
Man
how is Tyson 6'9, he looks slightly taller than Francis?
Trust me, the fight between Ngannou vs Fury won't be the same as Mayweather vs McGregor. There is 0% chance Conor is going to outbox Floyd. Conor can't touch Floyd. Not the same for Fury. At HW you are very hittable. If it turns into a slug fest, Francis definitely has a punchers chance. Even shots to the body from Francis will do damage. Tyson has always outweighed his opponents by a significant amount. This would be the first time he would be fighting someone who actually walks around at a natural 275lbs.
I had no idea Francis was that tall?
They should allow Francis to atleast elbow or something he’s gonna get pieced up even worse by fury with smaller gloves smh
Sugar hill already took his shirt off to party🤣
Bareknuckle Fighting Championship!
I knew it
After usyk if Joshua loses I think it’s time for Joshua to fight whyte again which is incase fight grudge fight to
First Wilder and now Whyte lmao no one can beat Tyson Fury👏
Have you got a big Cory 😂😂😂😂😂
Where is Danna White?
Ummm he didn't call anyone out.
Tyson Fury…the Gypsy King…God Bless you brother 👊🏽🙏🏽✌🏽🦍
I love Francis, it will be hard to watch him take that beating. But at least he'll get a big payday.
Damn. Francis ngannou is fucking huge. He's as big as Tyson fury. Fuck dude
I'm starting to think this might happen !!!! For them to even do what they just did means Uncle Dana is either all in or Francis is done with the Ufc after his current contract
I think Fury has a legit claim to the being the heavyweight goat.
Tyson fury The undisputed boxing heavyweight champion vs Francis ngannou the undisputed ufc heavyweight champion also the human possessing hardest punch in the world definitely very interested to see a boxing match between them!! Fury is 6'9 Francis is 6'4 but Francis looks same size and physically shreeded
He quickly changed his tune about fighting again
Africa is happy with Tyson fury
Such a respectful champion. Worrying about his opponent
GYPSY KING!  That's the champ right there, period.. you don't have to like it but you have to respect it
Kamaru Usman 2.0.
Just glad to see ppl appreciate Tyson Fury here and now...gave Whyte his biggest payday and title shot..now wants to do the same for Ngannou...and the TRUTH is he didn't have to but both he and his opponents deserved it....Love AJ too tbh but Fury is showing how it should and can be done....LEGEND!
biggest cross over fight ever , maybe, revealed  - let's cut away ... because there' s some serious advertisng revenue to be had .... and we are he suckers
I thought it would be a rnd.8 KO,  Tyson was in a rush tonight.
Man! Fury came out of a low vibration in his life going through depression and beat Wilder, the first fight can be up for grabs depend on who you talk too. Changed trainers to the Kronk way. Beat Wilder in those two fights. Now look at him, he standing tall in the light after another fight. It sucks to get old, that’s why I always wish fighters could slow they age down so you can see them over and over in their prime. Unfortunately it’s not how life works. Salute to Tyson Fury.
Tyson should fight usyk so he would be named as legend.
Another ufc champ to get sacrificed too the sport of boxing, lol
He wana knock out every black my man....!
LMFAO Dana white will never let that happen
Someone help me...what did Fury asked Francis?...have u got a big tory???
AJ will demolish Fury
I can't wait.  Francis needs a big payday.  He comes from a really tuff place,  and made it out. I hope he goes back to help his people
This proves clearly fury qint nowjere near 6ft 9, francis is 6ft 4 and proved with the angle tyson is no more than 6ft 7
Dana White just threw his phone against the wall when he saw this. Oh its true, its true!
Did he ask him if he's got a big member?? LOL
Should of been tyson vs Joshua, Dylan wasn't a serious contender
Why don't he fight him in mma, always want to be in your element
Francis doesn't have a chance against fury but it takes only one punch for Francis to knock out fury
I think Jon Jones would be a good puzzle for Tyson to figure out
I WILL BE THERE!
fury can handle power of wilder skills is only chance of francis to win
Make ur money
Mike tyson? 🤣
Damn Tyson is 6'9 and Francis looked almost same height as him. It'll be a good one forsure
What a joke let's put real Fighters against each other for the fact that they want to beat each other up not for the fact that they were just want to get paid I want to see real Fighters fight
Boxing ring- Ngannou gets destroyed, Octagon- Fury gets destroyed.  Why would I watch either one of those.
Tyson Fury is currently my favorite fighter since Canelo is wasting his prime. Can't fault him for wanting to make money but it's at the expense of his legacy.  Meanwhile *Tyson Fury is entertaining before, during, and after his fights* and ALWAYS wants elite competition.  He asked what could top this? Well finally meeting and beating Anthony Joshua to attain all four Heavyweight belts. The nostalgic boxing historian he is, betting that is what he does.  Remember thinking he wasn't that great and beat an aging Klitschko but against all odds continued rapidly improving, even as his career was almost derailed by partying and severe depression which I can relate too. An extremely intelligent fighter with a high boxing IQ and intellect, he worked feverishly into becoming both an unorthodox and fundamentally sound fighter.  Much respect for Fury, all of the adversity he had to deal with and returned stronger than ever and competed with love and passion for the sport and for life itself. Truly inspiring, one of my all time favorite -fighters- athletes regardless of sport.  - A fan from Phoenix, AZ 🇺🇲
In MMA Francis destroys Tyson, in Boxing Tyson destroys Francis…
Tyson vs Usyk bro.. this fight would be insane. If Tyson can beat AJ & Usyk bro.. he’s best heavy weight in history better than Ali
Francis so huge
Fury can not beat Francis in anything close to MMA. Again Francis could break his legs with a few kicks
Have you got a big cord 🤣 tyson a  funny dude.
Can't blame Francis, he want's to get paid
Francis is the heaviest hitter ever, however hitting Tyson clean is going to be harder than hitting MMA guys clean. At least Francis will finally get paid properly, I would expect their fight to end in a TKO, where Francis will get tired and take too many shots and stumble down. Francis does seem to get pretty tired by around the 3rd round in MMA, that would translate in boxing to around the 6th round, he would be super heavy and slow by that round, and Tyson could then finish it. Tyson would just have to be careful in round 1-4, where a single shot from Francis can lead to a massive KO, Francis hits even harder than Deontay.  As I said, I don't care if Francis loses (I am a huge fan), I will just be glad that he will make probably tens of millions of dollars, since the UFC only pays him a few hundred thousand dollars and his life effort is worth more than that, he has risen above everyone, time to get the money he deserves.
Andy Ruiz beat Francis in boxing
Tyson should not enter MMA. His legs would get brutalized by kicks. He would fall like a tree.
Bernardo ... from Friday night fights "Solo Boxeo" on  telefutura to  this
Man, John Fury is terrifying. Tyson is huge. But his dad is enormous as well, and looks like a Mafia hit man out of a movie. Actually, he should be in all the movies!
The thing is when Fury went down from Wilder he was able to take a lot of sting out of the punch - it was never really a snappy clean punch because he moved with it. I don’t think Tyson is a ‘super human’ like what everyone thinks - he’s just a super good boxer who knows what he’s doing. You can’t hurt this guy badly - that’s why no ones able to knock him out
In a real fight Francis kills Fury no questions.
Interviewer slipped up and said Mike Tyson at the end there
I'm a ngannou fan but man Tyson is the Best what a humble fighter, love from NZ.
The next fury vs Joshua 💪💪
I refuse to believe that Fury is satisfied ending his professional boxing career against Dillian Whyte. Dillian did not deserve to be in the ring with him. Tyson needs to unify the belts… I will not rest until Tyson Fury unifies those belts!!! Let gooooo!
Tyson fury is a very good human
Why can't this guy just retire?
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
andy ruiz
Tyson are you sure his punch can end up your career.
Francis is trying not to be intimidated
Have you got big Cory 😂
DANA BIG MAD! 🤣🤣🤣
In your own country? Remeber when you pretened to irish fighting on bernard dunnes undercards?
Literally one power kick to tysons leg from francis and tysons career would be over. And thats not even a gross exaggeration. ONE kick and francis could, and I reckon WOULD shatter tysons leg
I know a lot of casual fans won’t like this but they also thought whyte was a threat lol… without seeing them fight each other you can see how much better fury is than Joshua, usyk is better than Joshua technically but still not like fury and way too small… the experts know and that’s exactly why Joshua’s team have made sure to drag on negotiations any time fury was an option.. they don’t want to expose their cash cow anymore than he’s already been exposed.. it sucks but there’s only 1 way we would ever get Joshua vs fury and that’s if Joshua loses to usyk again then later down the road we could get the fight.. if he somehow wins his titles back no way his team will let him just lose the titles right back
Francis should just get in to shape and get his payday 😉
Francis has a punchers chance
Tyson Fury is not 6'9. Why tf does he and everyone else think he is? He's 6'5 or 6'6. Ngannou is 6'4 and he's basically the same height as fury. Unless Ngannou was wearing some big boy boots
Francis Ngannou boring as everrrrrrrrr. Came with one line prepared. That fight could be fcking huge if more than one of those two knew how to sell a fight.
Francis’ll get his ass whooped better off fighting jones.
"Hybrid rules with mma gloves"  Fury "ummm wtf"
I wouldn't count Francis out. He hits harder than wilder and has better technique. And wilder was the toughest fight in furys career.
Omg. Ngannou was bigger than I thought
it's gonna be modified MMA rules with restrictions so the fight somewhat evens out. I'm sure no takedowns allowed. 4 Ounces gonna be different but depending on rules if Tyson can create distance I think he wins all day unless Francis allowed to kick the shit out Fury's long ass legs
Crazy thing is... Francis probably has a better chance in winning than Whyte ever did against Fury LOL
3:14 what was that all about lol
Francis will be swinging at air. Francis had to resort to wrestling to pull off his last fight. In striking only Francis is fucked lets be honest. Tom Aspinall I believe will beat Francis very soon . Way more well rounded fighter. TWT.
6'9 vs 6'4 but they look similar sized hmm
Tyson vs Francis should be a barn burner with ufc gloves, maybe inside the octagon too! After that, there is literally nothing left for Tyson to do! Sucks to see him retire due to lack of competition, but glad to see a champ go out on top for a change instead of hanging around past their prime and taking the L’s like we usually see!
Rigged..wake up
Tyson made francis look small.........wtf
Huge respect to Fury for possibly giving Francis a huge payday!!
Rumors say that Francis is still trying to land Fury
It will be epic if they box with MMA Gloves! I would really be interested in seeing that happen.
Francis gonna get a reality check Stepping into  a boxing ring.
Is Francis Kamikaze? He want to do a boxing match with fury in ufc gloves? LOL
lol sugarhill with his shirt off in solidarity with Tyson fury always cracks me up, thats some real bro shit. very classy of fury to bring Francis into the interview, that fight would be insane.
Fury will change Francis’s life forever financially if that fight actually happens. Forget making 100-200k in ufc if that, one fight with fury and PPV buys, he will probably make 15-20 mil
Sugar bringing out best for Tyson fury
Tyson Fury stand up Man. ✝️ Who children and young adults should be looking up to as they idolize so many pro athletes.
mma gloves the fight will be too fast! boxing gloves will be better 🥊 can't wait to see UFC CHAMP vs Tyson Fury 🔥🔥
Ummmmm that's what I thought Tyson isn't 6ft9in lmfao clear proof with Jason and now Francis more like 6ft5 maybe a 6ft6... Could be real reason why Anthony Joshua and Tyson have no video together because the height
He should box Ciryl Gane. Gane actually has a solid chance of beating Fury in a boxing ring. If anybody reads this and you don't know who Gane is, I implore you to check him out. You think Fury is fast for a heavyweight? Gane moves like a lightweight.
Francis will have the biggest payday of his life if this happen.
Ngannou has no chance against Tyson fury that is for sure
Fransis on cocaine☺
Ooh scary!! it's ok Jesse Haley ms mum Tomboy girl  it tastes better when you're here. I feel safe with you you want me?
Fury ain’t retired . The thought of it makes sense but he’s in his prime has all the glory and he’s a fighter and entertainer through and through you can’t retire what you are . Just have a long break and come back in your own time champ :)
Francis fight Beyoncé windmill. You would get starched fact. Speed beats power. And noodle legs will cut ring off and starch you.
The heavyweight division is full of bums
Plot Twist: Ngannou has a below average D size and Tyson has been walking on one leg this whole time.
Francis and Tyson friends since when. Did anybody see these giants hanging out ?? Because this has to be new and favorable in both parties
" have you got a big Cory " tyson is fucking hilarous
Francis finally getting paid what he deserves! Thanks Fury!
I like this calling out the ufc champion makes you talk more about boxing that's how big ufc is now and that's crazy.
https://youtu.be/q8izgumaZDk BIG MIKE
Boxing is another level but if it's mma gloves that's scary for any heavyweight . Francis hits like a freight train .
“Have you got a big Cory”? 😂 😂
Francis will get KO’d or fatigue will hamper his path to victory. Tyson is one of the GOATs in the Boxing realm.
What a personality Tyson has... Apart from his greatness in the ring the guy is a pure showman. This fight will be huge. Very easy predictable Fury win, but let Francis get his check, plus his power is unmatched and if somehow he connect a shot it will be interesting.
Ngannou 😂😂😂 not even a punchers chance 🇮🇪
That fight looked so fake
Once in a lifetime fighter and human being!
"mike tyson"
2:20 I thought Fury doesn’t drink anymore? 🤣
Francis cant box period.
WE all wait for unification with Usyk. Period
I guess Ngannou has a small meat stick.
Respect to Tyson Fury for offering Ngannou a big payday - it will be a great Mismatch
Tyson will get hurt and lose!
EASY work for Tyson 🤣
Pretty embarrassing, calling out a slow stiff mma guy that can’t box when Tyson’s till hasn’t fought usyk or AJ
MMA gloves in the cage and 10-15seconds of clinching,will make the fight more interesting anything can happen with those small gloves, but it sure favors Fury but anything can happen especially if there is more time for clinching.
Why is this more interesting then the actual fight
I wanna see David Haye's face..
Francis  Nnganou  the knockout  puncher
SHIT IM MEXICAN I LOVE CANELO BUT...FKING FURY EVERYBODY LOVE HIM !
mike tyson...lol .. the great name slips in at the end by the announcer
Tyson fury asking the ufc champion if he got a big Cory he make he laugh another miss match Tyson cnt be beaten
3:17 got me dead. 🤣🤣 Uhh??
I hope this boxing match does happen. Not because I think Ngannou would win, but so he can finally get paid what he deserves!!!
Re duro tyson
Fury better retire he’s not ready for Francis ✊🏾
for people saying tyson would easily win, i dont give a fuck. its gonna be one hell of a fight either way
If you weren't a fan of fury, something's wrong with u
Big what?😂😂😂
If Francis started boxing like he wanted to in his earlier years then he woulda been a killer in the boxing league. I just don't see Francis winning against Tyson.
First time I'm rooting for boxing over mma
Two Monsters 👍
Today everyone  was screaming Whyte life matters
😮😲
Francis using that language, not long ago words like MF are so bad and prohibited and now, people just follow the main stream media bs, and using it carelessly to hype something. Francis your mother is watching this
this brought a big smile to my face.. ydk why either🤌✨
Lfg
I wonder what Dana thinks of this 🤔
Boxing with 4 Oz gloves... God damn.
IF Fury was the same size as his opponents especially talented opponents HE would be a B class fighter White is not good at all it was a Beautiful uppercut though
Dana white flipping furniture right about now 🤣
The fight nobody wanted to see….  Anthony Joshua would destroy fury
Fury is the man of the moment..
"A BIG WHAT???" 🤣🤣🤣
I want see this I’m big fan of UFC and boxing 🥊
Any man who thought Tyson would loose needs signed in to a mental hospital ffs
WHY WHY do no Champs EVER call out or fight Louis Ortiz and HE is old
MANCUNIAN
Look at this man changing shirts. He plays the game well.
Just sign the contract big boy
Always a punchers chance
*_THIS FIGHT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. MARK MY WORDS. IF IT DOES, I WILL PAYPAL 1 BITCOIN TO WHOEVER RESPONDS TO THIS._*
Dana white mad AF
Damn Tyson knocked out 2 people this week . 1 on a plane another in a ring...
Bloody legend
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😅😅🥲🤣🤣 that question dead me
I was mad at fury for beating Bomb squad but like they say “keep winning and they’ll like you” I respect fury
This was  concert. Tyson wants that $100 Million. Then he,ll retire.
3:11 Tyson asked Ngannou if he had a big "tory".  After a bit of an embarrassing moment where it looked like Francis didn't know how to respond then commentator says will we see it in the octagon or the ring?  WTH?
I don’t want to see this nonsense at all. If it’s not AJ or the draft dodger, leave it. Tyson, don’t ruin your legacy with this foolishness. You’re too good for Ngannou.
Bro Francis is fucking massive like I didn’t realize how big he was and next to fury I was like goddamn this fight is either gonna be amazing or a dud buh like it’s so compelling to see is the freak of nature can go against a legend in heavyweight history
Tyson ain’t 6’9 he at least 6’7
The Gypsy King could beat Khazmat in a regular UFC match.
Fury is the man, congrats champ
what the hell did he mean by big corey?  Seem to freak Ngannou out!
Look at Francis man, dude looking for a big paycheck🤣 why not
Fury absolutely decimates Francis in boxing
I'll take Frances
Azteca andy Ruiz vs fury let's do it
3:14 what did he ask him?
Francis looks really tall... standing next to Fury, I thought he would be much shorter..
Mike Tyson training Francis. Helping out? Would be cool promo
Francis looks taller than 6’4
Would be a nice pay day for Ngannou; but he’d lose terribly against Tyson
Respect to Tyson for giving francis his shine
The look on fury’s face when Francis said it’s going to be mixed rules with mma gloves 🤣 fury’s thinking ahh no it’s not it will be boxing and boxing rules or nothing
That's a good fight for both and for the fans. Hope Francis put his A+++ game when the time comes💪
Im happy Francis Mom will live comfortable in her old age. Izzy and Usman in Francis corner for fight
Av ya got a big Corey 😂
Excellent
Dana announces Zuffa boxing and puts up a boxing ring broadcasted by the UFC. They market it and i'm sure they can pull over 1.5M buys
Francis is 6"3-6'4. Something seems off when he was next to fury
It doesn't get better than this coz u fought a Bum
Frances wins if its MMA, Tyson wins if its boxing. Simple.
Ngannou reminds me.if Whyte except not as good lol
Woah now, their fight sounds ridiculous. The last thing they need is smaller gloves.
Finally someone who might weigh close to Fury’s weight.
IT'S HAPPENING! 🔥
What a bad interviewer
I think very big chance for win to francis. With mma gloves.
No way Tyson is as tall as they say. He is barely taller then Francis.
Imagine being an absolute unit of a man and UFC champion, then realising there is someone bigger than you....
Whyte just got his ass dominated inside 6 rounds. Ngannou will get destroyed inside 3 rounds. Ngannou has no technique or stamina. He'll be gasping for air after round 1 swinging with those wild punches that go nowhere. I'd watch the free stream no way I pay for this novelty fight.
He wants to fight the hardest hitter in UFC 🤣
When he said do you have a big Corey he didn't have a clue 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Whyte and his team never corrected how susceptible he is to uppercuts 👀👀👀👀
The best Flyweight Muay Champion Rodtang and arguably the best MMA Flyweight Champion of all time Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson fought in a mixed rules bout that would alternate Muay Thai and MMA rules rounds. That makes way more sense here and would give a much more even chance.
We throw Fury and Francis in an empty room. Only one can leave alive. How many fools are willing to put money on Fury?
MMA Fighters doesn't have a chance inside a boxing ring. 😂😂
It would be awesome if ngannou fought fury without Dana white and take a good chunck of the purse for himself.... but I'm pretty sure dana has his claws in....
He has to fight Anthony Joshua to rule this era. That's the only other 1 loss boxer out there he hasn't demolished in this era.
Tomorrow news ngannou has been released from the UFC Jones vs stipe official for the undisputed heavyweight title
Fury hit so hard the wind knocked White out 👀
Idk why he doesn’t go for undisputed then retire he can easily do it 🤦‍♂️
Ngannou about to be KOd by a Jon Jones leg kick soon so
Fury is awesome props to the gypsy 👑 !!
Man Fury would dominate Francis. It wouldn’t even be a fair fight.
It’s crazy how big Francis looks even though he’s “only” 6’4 compared to Fury’s 6’9. I think if it’s kickboxing with MMA gloves it’s a good fight.
Make the fiiiiiiiiiight
Ngannou and Fury's height dont look that much different yet Ngannou is billed 6"4 and Fury 6"9
It’d be a shit way to go out of boxing when AJ and Usyk are still out there
Damn!! Wilder vs Ngannou wouldve been a better fight. Tyson will school him.
When he asked him if he had a big dick 🤣🤣🤣🤣
IMPOSSIBLE to find that out in a boxing match.Lmao that nigga ain’t stepping in the cage tho.
Ngannou is about to be paid
Fury lives to KO Adonis type fighters.
I like that a brother could get paid big from this BUT who wants to see "chummy chummy best pals" in the ring/octagon(rintagon??!)methinks they should have played it as if they're antagonistic towards each other and people have to pull em apart,that I think may sell more PPVs. I'm sure ol'  uncle Chael will agree with me.
Francis came over a little bit intimidated by Fury
Mike Tyson 😳
3rd round for tyson but if nganou contact with fury head please i tell you fury going to hospital
Why do the commentators feel the need to apologise for someone swearing ? Violence is ok but my god no swearing lol
Two of the nicest and badest mofos to ever walk the earth, F ya I'd buy this fight!
King of the Gypsies Mitchell' Tyson come on give me Year to train
I hope UFC brings this fight in octegon on a mma card even if this fight has no ground/grappling.  I do not want to watch a bunch of boxing just these two
Fury will find all way to duck usyk n aj
Seria épico !
? Fury is ridiculous. Why the fuck would call out a ufc fighter while your still a pro. Wouldn’t mean shit on your record because he’s not in the sport.
Tyson's good dude bro.  I like that dude. God bless him in everything do. After that fight with Francis they will be friends I know for sure.
How the hell do 6'9 and 6'4 look the same
I’m so hyped for that. Setting their own rules....power...
francis..... learn to take a joke , he has a stick up his ass  , fury is just pure gold
Tyson fury and Francis ngannou both my favorites
Make it happen fury and fancis 1fight in boxing and 1fight in mma
Dude hes high on something
i expect more from francis than dillan white
damn dillian bro...upper cut is ur kryptonite
Tyson will always be a legend bro
Dana wet his pants and is hiding in a corner
Tyson Fury need to just stick with boxing. I think it's only fair for him to give AJ a fight before he retire because if anyone can give Tyson Fury problems, it's AJ because of his power inside and outside.
Francis will get Knocked the fuck out bro.
Fury vs Ngannou would be great but I'd like to see Wilder vs Ngannou to see who's the baddest man on the planet rn
Fury is a good man for that. Everyone knows ufc fighters don't make much.
Haha Tyson fury casually asking Ngannou if he has a big penis.
Hell yeah
Dana white won..complete 3-0...nobody cares for boxing now..LIKE That's a record breaker in boxing,in England..DONT WASTE MONEY ON  THE JOSHUA AND HEARN FARCE.(CIRCUS ACT)..Amateur boxing is better and more deserving of the ticket money.
'have you got a big cory' fucking howling 😂
Francis has NO SHOT
All I will say tonight is “I love and respect Tyson Fury”.
3:15 sus moment
Omg
Dana white is crying somewhere haha
WTF who cares about this. Unification is the real fight.
Why was he asking Francis if he had a big cory (dick) lol?  Even Francis was like wtf??
tyson fury... greatest heavyweight ever...
Fury will end him
He called Frances Mike Tyson
No one cares about Francis.
Did Fury actually ask him if he had a big wanger ?🤔😄😄😄😄😄
The interviewer says “America made you a superstar” Hmmmm no, I don’t think it’s fair to give America credit for his fame, he made his legacy himself!
💯💯💯
94000 stadium but why does it look like only half the stadium is filled??
I Got Francis With The BIG K.O Over Fury!
Have you got a big Cory lol wtf . Why does Francis look taller than Fury
Fury is just trying to get ngannou paid. That shows how a great person curry is.
Called him mike Tyson
Tyson v Francis!!!  ❤️. Class!
Wow fury just retire without getting the other belts or fighting aj. Wow
Betting $1000 that Ngannou is completely gassed by rounds 2-3
Would love to see this in Cameroon, for Francis. Tyson would relish it too
Fury is the greatest, the goat. Mayweather who..
Straight out of Hollywood these characters Francis will kill him
Not even Canelo can get 94,000 people in a stadium.
Ngannou will take what he's givin or else
He got a huge break in the first fight between him n wilder....The ref started to count 3 days later after he got knocked down....Still 32-1 in reality....Bum!
Good man 💯
I think Fury may have beaten Lennox Lewis in his prime. Call it boxing blasphemy!!! I really think Fury is an all time great!!
Omg how can he ko Whyte its the greatest achievement in combat sport history! This puts him at no1 ATG in boxing ever
Fix fight six round  its a joke
If Floyd can make money in a circus 🎪 why can't the best fighter on the planet do it
look at that crowd man he cant retire
Francis closes his eyes way too much when hes fighting... Way too much for  Tyson not to capitalize🤷‍♂️😉
Francis doesn’t have a chance.  He couldn’t out box Gane.
Ok... I Can See By The Comments People Don't Know Boxing Or Been In A fight  *I've Knocced Down Someone Wit A Uppercut Before* *Even Though It Wasn't Underneath The Chin He Still Went Down* *And Got Bacc Up* *The Uppercut Is usually used to left the chin up when there's a tight guard* *I think it's the push that got people so outraged* *I would've called it a slip...*
Wtf same height
Dana White regrew his hair just to start pulling it out after seeing Francis in that ring
Nothing sensentional or brutal about it.. That was horrible fight, two fat lards boxed, one tocuhed the other and the other fell from exhaustion. Nothing great about this fight. The greatness, is long gone, Iron Mike Tyson
Tyson Fury would absolutely obliterate Ngannou. This fight won’t even be fair honestly…
Francis saying ‘with MMA gloves’ like Fury’s gonna be scared or something. I’m scared for Francis if Fury wears them gloves.
Tyson Fury is the best heavyweight boxer of this generation. I think now that nobody can defeat him.
Ngannou would eat him alive
Wow he in the History books for sure . Tyson's record will be always spoken about because this is what legends do .Great fight my Lad .💯💯💯🥊🥊🙏
Whys tyson scared to lose his 0 against the winner of usyk or Joshua?  Stupid duckin and make it happen! Winner of usyk and Joshua vs fury to unify
BFG, BFG, BFG.
DO YA HAVE A BIG COREY?  a big what? HAHAHAHAHAHA  GYPSY FKN KING LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
Fury vs Ngannou... again a fight with no sense.... and the stupid people pay for make this fight... shame on this poor people ... stupid fight... Ngannou have no chance , only for the money... so sad , so pathetic... isn't sport...
Running from usyk
This man is a glorified Logan Paul! Povetkin knocked out Whyte with the same fight one fight ago
Francis knows he'd beat Tyson. Get ready to be surprised
The biggest heavyweight PPV mismatch since Haye vs Harrison.
People love to see people fight, men love to fight. I think eventually the televised fighting game will amalgamate into one, and what a contest it would be. Man v man, woman v woman
The man's a legend
Fuckin A Bro🙏🏻🗣🎯  Sugar Hill Respect to you also Sir Great way to work Fury. Cracked his arse w that uppercut since he like to lean in so much. Dillian whyte's like yo I got half on this uppercut all night with you  6 round Tyson Fury's like time to send it🥊💥⤴️
ngannou was not born to trash talk lmao. his smile refuses to be evil.
6'4" and 6'6"
A joke. Mma fighters are terrible boxers.
Who's the "Sugar" guy trying to hog the camera??
Three seconds is enough to highlight this fight.
Greatest heavyweight since Lennox Lewis
Bro... tyson was playing with that guy... he popped him and then pushed him on the ground almost Discarding him like trash
Wasn't a Tyson fan but i can't deny the goat  hate saying it but  boxing legend
Did Francis just get himself in a bit of legal trouble?… I think so
would have loved to see more of Francis in the UFC but UFC is now at least in some ways bigger than Boxing but the money they pay to their high level fighters is a disgrace to Boxing(which is ridiculous because Boxing is corrupt and UFC bashes them for corruption) and Francis deserves a big pay day to retire on and he was never going to get that in the UFC.
fury will beat francis
Yes make that happen please
Did he ask him “have ya got a big yary?
Fury has just won this fight and is already engaging in mind games with his next opponent, legend
In a boxing math Fury makes Ngannou look stupid. Would be an embarrassment. In a MMA fight well I think I go with  Ngannou.
Accent so thick bet Francis understand half he said 🙏
Ok, who was surprised by this. Usually, i'm rooting for one or another this one was just a payday for both and congrats. AJ took whyte out with the same punch. on to the next.
Who you all got with mma gloves on. - > Fury or Ngannou ?
hell yea. that will be the 2nd biggest ppv in history
I wouldn't say this means the fights getting booked. Both sides have wanted the fight. Gotta talk to daddy dana
Lmfao nobody talking about Tyson asking Francis if he has a big cock 😂😂😂
The Body_snatcher got snatched! 🤔
Francis about to get the bag of a lifetime. A lot of MMA fans who've been shitting on him for going against Dana about to have a meltdown.
He need someone his size to fight
"Have ya got a big torrie?"
I'm a Tyson Fury fan, can't help but rooting for him.   Congratulations!
Fury asking Francis how big his pecker is 😂
Francis owes fury big time for this favour.That’s the honest truth.
Hahahaha. Nice business by both. If there is no kicks or grappling then ngannu is lamb to the slaughter
Ngannou will die in roun 1 with Fury..
The most dangerous thing Francis ngannou  could ever do in his life is box Tyson fury . Please no
He’s pulling the Lennox Lewis if he’s trying to leave the sport without fighting AJ or Usyk. But I’m not surprised.
Ngannou  knows he as zero xhance it would be a humiliation . Do t wanna see it because it's a pure money grab
goat！
You deserve it 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🥊🇬🇧
Same weight opponent and thats fair for francis.
to me ngannou knows he can't beat Tyson in boxing so wants more of a punches chance with mma gloves. he needs an advantage against Tyson which tells me he is scared to box him
Usyk is his biggest challenge
I just want to see who punches harder on a calibrated machine Francis Ngannu or Deontay Wilder.
#GOAT #GYSPY 👑
Have you got a big Cory 🤣fucking love Tyson 👌
Tf did fury ask fracis during the interview? Lmao
Why is the short dude's shirt off?
So happy Francis got out of the UFC, he knew his worth and wasn't about to be bullied. He can retire in a single fight.
2 of the nicest guys on the planet, arent we blessed to live in their era 👊
A kangaroo circus at best 😄
Gotta love Francis and Fury two of the baddest motherfuckers on the planet right now.
tyson crazy man big difference in weight
Don’t apologize for the language tf. Congratulations Tyson fury! Aways good to see two awesome people greeting and meeting.
Whyte knocked out by an uppercut from povetckin, joshua and now fury
America made you a superstar?! And this is your homecoming?! Who is this uninformed, backwards and biased bastard? Unreal.
usyk the only slick boxer who has a chance
3:15 😆
He sold his soul to the devil for his belts lol jk.
For me Tyson should have, could have ended the fight early, Whyte only has his right hand up and dropped that left hand 95% of the time, Tyson should have capitalized on this early and knocked him out.
I’m so glad this is gonna happen francis deserves it and it’s against 2 of the greatest heavyweights of all time
Wow, Anthony who?
Francis will get the big pay innhis life and get knockout by tyson fury. I want to see joshua vs fury instead.
Has he got a big Tory? That’s gotta be an iconic tv moment right there
I wouldn’t be excited to see Usman and canelo Alverez but I would definitely be excited to see fury and Frances Ngannou. Francis literally has a puncher‘s chance. Usman has 0 chance he just wants the payday
I can't wait for that fight holy shit
Our champ
Don't see how wearing mma gloves will help Ngannou, that'll help Tyson.
En plus qu'il est un excellent boxeur il est aussi un excellent parleur ! 💪👍👌👏
Why are people saying there happy for Francis he's going to destroy the heavyweight division just like McGregor with lightweight and featherweight and people shit on McGregor for doing the same damn thing. we all know if he losses to fury which unless you're just delusional you know he will he'll just come back to the ufc and the only change will be people won't take him as seriously this is worst case scenario for everyone except fury because he gets an east fight and I guess Francis because at least he'll make money
Don't apologise for the swearing, nobody cares. We all swear.
Francis is out his got dam mind to think he can fight a pure breed boxer.  I have a feeling we are getting taken here 😶
Big Corey lol
A legend indeed, well done champ
AJ WOULD SLEEP FURY
Apologize for language 🤣
Man Francis better stay outta that ring with Fury! Power means nothing when you have skill. Ask Wilder what power meant when you're facing someone with actual skill and a seasoned trainer!!! Fury and Sugar Hill got a plan and it hasn't failed yet..
One of the most cleanest knockouts I have ever seen
94,000 ..ok I don't ever want to hear another peep out of Carl Froch
Francis is a cry baby..
In all-round MMA fight Francis would knock Fury out anywhere from 60 - 120 seconds !!! In boxing Fury would knock Francis out anywhere from the 5th - 7th round. I like both fellas.
Pussy wont fight the 2 biggest fights out there for him. He can never honestly say he has proved himself in the heavyweight devision unless he fights the top 2 guys
I don't want to watch Francis box Tyson ..whyyy we keep doing this
what a horrible interview fucking amateur hour
Francis is garbage. Nothing to compare to boxing.
Big respect to Fury and massive love for Francis! Let’s go
like Borat hahahaha
Got a big corey have ya 😂😂😂 boxing with mma gloves thats it!
Let's Go Fury!! Another W, Nothin' New!! 💪 You have inspired so many of us man. God Bless!! ✌️💪
This should just be a wwe match. That way nobody has to reflect this bs fight on their record
Damn he’s a fat 170 pounder 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Martyn Ford vs Tyson fury
“He’s in great shape look at the Muscles on him” that says a lot for someone like Fury notice at once. Thank you Fury for making sure a brother finally gets the pay he deserves.
Corey is penis? Wow lol
I'll put my money on Ngannou if they use MMA gloves.  I love seeing bloody fists and faces.
I'm a Wilder fan, but Fury is a badass. Gotta knock out Joshua. Not sure what this thing with Ngannou is, but I'd like to watch it.
Ngannou gonna get his wish "SUPERFIGHT"
Dude is the biggest tuck in the world sure call out your old sparing partner instead of Joshua or the champ
Tyson Fury doin that "red panty night" on Francis.. its all love at the end but first this giants will collide in that ring!!!
Dana white some where piss
They're gonna box with MMA gloves?? Oh, I'm putting my money on Francis!!!
3:50....This mistake...
Dana White shadow boxing in his living room right now.
Best thing is they cut him off in anticipation of Tyson saying something negative about the ref
How is Fury 6’9 and Ngannou 6’4 and they look the same height??
Just when you think you’ve seen everything from Tyson Fury, he produces something new out of nowhere. Whyte probably came in too heavy, he wasn’t very mobile and lacked speed. I expected him to be a lot sharper, but even if he had come in lighter and faster, it wouldn’t have changed the result.
How does anyone actually believe fury is 6'9?🤣
Fight in the octagon or it don’t mean dick
Damn, Tyson is one big 170 pounder.
I would like to see me or one of the many dudes I know that Hike reg at 12000 ft 200+ pounds that fight in railyards get in there bye frauds we all got Iron Mike power c-mon Belly dance on this fux
The two greatest heavyweights in the world right now!
I will only give you my respect if you beat Olexander Usyk
Dana gonna pop his top
3.51 mike tyson, im sorry, Tyson fury
I am starting to like this Tyson Fury dude, white man with them boxing skills ✊🏾💪🏾👍🏾make the sport interesting
And the Brits say Dillans gonna beat Wilder? LMAO. Wilder woulda smoke Dillan Whyte's boots in 2 rounds.
I hope Those don't fight MMA or anything like that.
love the relationship between tyson and sugar hill lmao
Gitan jusqu'à la mort prala🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸❤❤❤❤
Paid off..
respect for fury francis deserve this kind of money
America made you a superstar 😂😂😂 no no, Tyson put america on the map, look at all the bums you have there no good fighters, British boxing will always be better
Isn’t Francis waist smaller???  Wtf he’s 6’8 300+ 😂
Manchester is blue fuck fury
Letsgoo
This could be a start to a big future in sports we need more challenges in mma and boxing !
Boxing gloves and boxing rules no contest. 4 ounce gloves in a boxing match, Frances wins by ko easily.mans got great defense but that man hits different
please fight usyk please lord
I thought he would dwarf Francis ..but no
Can't wait for that 1
Tyson Fury has a very old style way of promoting the fight and Nagannu has a very formal way of promoting the fight.
Damn dillan whyte always getting ko he a gatekeeper forsure
Yeah literally no-one is offended by the swearing. So stop apologising 😤
This guy is truly something else.
“Sign the contracth big boy sign the contracth!” -Mike Tyson Fury
Boxing rules Tyson wins💯.. Mixed rules Francis wins💯 How they gonna balance it🤷🏾‍♂️
Chery pick fight
Tysoe fury is 6.7 feet not 6.8/9
Dana needs to start paying these bums fairly.These guy out here touching their toes for some change!
Terrible opponent.So is the next guy Fury is calling out.Weak heavyweight boxing era too.
The commentator was an idiot.  First of all, Tyson said he wasnt going to fight again, then they hinted at Francis v Fury future fight - but the commentator ran with it to 'hype up' the next thing to come, which is natural to do in every big fight.  But he said the dumbest thing . . . . "Tyson Fury is with ESPN and Francis Ngannou fights on ESPN, so they are both under the disney umbrella, so it could happen!" ... Ummmm....no.  Ngannou is signed with UFC.  UFC and Top Ranked are not owned by ESPN / ABC / Disney.  They have a contract with them.  Ngannou fights for Dana White.  And when you fight for UFC, the contract is so tight, they can't sneeze without UFC approving of it.  UFC will want their BIG cut of the money and there will be a negotiation process in which UFC will demand Francis holds more value (lol, i know right, but its part of the negotiation tactics) and want a bigger piece of pie.  On top of that - Dana White hates Bob Arum (Top Ranked) and I highly doubt he will want to do business with him.  Dana White and Mayweather never had issues and it was easy to get the McGregor-Floyd fight together, because that was UFC and Mayweather Promotions....But Bob Arum and Dana White simply do not like each other and this fight will be nearly impossible to make.  Commentator was hyping something that very likely will not happen and ABC / Disney / ESPN does not hold Ngannou's contract - Uncle Dana does.
What a coward  Baaaaahahahahahahaahahahah.   Running from AJ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I knew it!!!!!!!   What a coward!!!!!     Run Fury Run!!!!!!!  Fighting nom boxers and handicapped boxers who have been defeated already!   Stay running flabby back! 💩🤣🤣🤡
Even heavyweights think they floyd sad
This guy was born to box its in his name
Tyson best boxer/ Francis best mma. Francis never past 5 rounds. No contest if it's a boxing match.
Francis will get starched but it will be by far the biggest pay day of his whole fighting career. Even if he goes the distance with Fury, the amount of hype and influence he will have going back to the UFC for contract negotiations will be phenomenal.
So he’s retiring it’s funny he knows they ran up the money from fake fights
I love how Fury's trainer Sugarhill Steward is in the ring with his shirt off lmao
Is Tyson Really a 6'9??
Can Frances do that well under contract with the UFC
I would pay to see this fight.  Like if you would pay to see this fight too.
Ngannou will put up  a way harder fight than Whyte ..   They should make it boxing rules..  Francis was sizing him up  physically....almost same size.   They would make much better numbers than fury got gor Whyte ..100 million dollars each no problems..
The Floyd Mayweather of the Heavy weight division lol
The moment I saw Dillian's face, I knew he didn't come to fight, I saw fear all over his face, he had no game plan, he didn't show any sign of him being a dangerous or tough mandatory challenger. This was Fury's easiest fight. Funny enough, all Dillian Whyte's three loses came via uppercut. Dillian Whyte should just hang his boxing gloves because there is no way he could ever become a world champion. Who is he going to beat. The only boxer I see in Fury's way is Frank Sanchez. He is the best counter puncher in the heavyweight division right now.
This Only Proves that Wilder isn't as bad As ppl made him out to be. Wilder gave him more of a fight than this.
All three of Dillian's defeats were by uppercuts, so this was an easy game plan going in. Dillian just leaves himself open for uppercuts, he just doesn't know how to not get hit by one. It's beyond ridiculous for someone who is a professional fighter. He needs to work on that it's very annoying to watch! Congrats to Fury on his win.
Tyson Fury 6th round TKO 2:59
Ngannou vs fury in wwe..
He Proved himself to be a boxing legend once again' there's only one Tyson fury✌️🧐🇬🇧🇨🇮
Word up!!!
Finally! a fighter that takes on the UFC and wins. Well done to Tyson and Francis.
Anyone else feel like fury gets one over his next opponent by being so damn casual with them
he needs to fight AJ
Why the hell is Sugar Hill shirtless lmao
Yoooo Nganou was so confused by by Tyson, man asked if he’s got a big Corey 🤣🤣🤣
ngannou asking for mma gloves when tysons punch game is so sharp is asking for trouble, does Ngannou understand mma gloves are there to help grapplers grapple? and they allow more severe punching damage?.
3rd time whyte been done by an uppercut been found out same as wilder
Fury made Francis look normal sized
Fury will beat him easy. Punchers chance but nah….  Stamina is in favour of Tyson.
Ngannou looking jacked as hell, looking forward the fight! Interesting with hybrid rules.
If its with mma gloves and kicks, then Ngannou will murder him
Sugar Hill and Tyson Fury are a superb match
No se si fue solo a mi, pero lo que más me gusto es que por más que pelearan en un futuro se nota el respeto entre ambos y que no se llevan para nada mal, estoy más que contento por Ngannou es casi seguro (será el boxeo pro Ngannou pega con un yunque y no hay que descartar un golpe suyo) de que ganara Fury, pero eso no importa lo que si es que Francis se llevará un buen cheque millonario que es lo que merece 👏👏👏
Ufc gloves with elbows and knees only, obviously fists too
One great fight.
What a treat Fury is man. I enjoy his vibes and glad he's set himself and family up with wealth so that he can continue to have fun.
Love both guys .Two great champions.
Francis would put up a better fight than Whyte because of his build is similar to Fury but pure muscle. I still think Fury wins though because of his fighting IQ and speed. Both of them got power though so you can’t really count Francis out.
Then after undisputed would be next surely against the winner of the rematch Usyk/AJ
i love you fury  incredible man
Anthony Joshua is stupid he could of had the biggest pay day of his life if he didint keep ducking Tyson fury and Deontay wilder now look at him lost his chance he’s going to regret this
Tyson vs usyk
Daddy Fury is happiest fada ind world🤴🤴🤴🤴🤴🤴Hail King Gipsy 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Everybody hated when Floyd was setting up to fight an MMA fighter, but now the white bois wanna do it and there's hardly a complaint.
Let's go!!!!💥
Tyson fury gonna his ass whooped by Francis
3:50 reporter accidentally calls him Mike Tyson and then Fury uses Mikes famous line “sign the contract big boy sign the contract” 😂
Congratulations 👏 to Francis I pray it happens. He needs that payday for sure.
This dude Fury better fight Usyk instead of a UFC fighter who no one wants to see the fight.  Tyson better not duck Usyk.
I believe these black fighters are No where near the black boxers like back in the Day , these guys are just too laid back and not serious enough , because they got money 💰 now  , but go on the streets and find a broke dude  , like me or from the hood , and Tyson fury would get his ass knocked out in the first round period 🆗 💯 percent guaranteed 🥊
Francis getting paid!!!
Nganou looks bigger than fury
Nothing but respect to Fury. You can tell Fury has genuine love for a brother. Just wants to get this underpaid world beast a pay day he’d never get in MMA. That’s Fury promoting an mma champion, not Dana White.
I died when Tyson kept asking him about his dick size hahahaha
It looked like Dillian was just out for his biggest payday ! He looked unfit and unstable and was totally outclassed every minute of that fight. Total lack of sustained aggression… Not the fight I anticipated from Whyte.
It’s sad bc no one will remember this last garbage ass fight.
So proud of Francis. Dana White's head must have been so RED after watching this....LMAO
The best role model ever
I don't care if Fury beats a million people and never lose. I will never like him or respect him or his people. When certain things have been done and said, it just is what it is and that's what it will always be.
It's best if Francis Ngannou accepts this valuable offer because he will get so much money that the amount is many times more than what the UFC paid him
Dana don't fuck this up it will be interesting to see how this might go down.
Bloody oath he's got a big koorie
Why is he so pudgy?
King Tyson Fury the GOAT
This is ridiculous  Ngannou gets absolutely sparked in any “mixed rules” BS that doesn’t allow elbows or kicks. Whatever. Get that $$ I guess.
Terrrrrrrrible interviewer
They should fight in something like that triad combat thing, it would be more fair for ngannou
Interviewer: Mike Tyson! 😆
Are you fighting francis  Yes  Are you fighting USYK  No im retiring 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm done with sports. It's all rigged.
I dont know there’s a ring/cage big enough to handle those mules. And I don’t want to see Fury with 4 ounce gloves. Even if it is Ngannou. Both of those guys are top of the food chain in my eyes, but that uppercut from Fury just looks way deadlier. Who knows. I’ll buy that fight to find out!
Francis will body Tyson
Ngannou is bigger than tyson fury.. wtf.. Yeah fury is dead in a real fight again nagannou
Same height
holy shit even next to fury , nganou still looks huge
just saying that this guy Tyson would never had any chance in the 70 and 80 or 90..a joke of a boxer in these then and now with no quality boxers.. .but he has deserved his time of glory against low quality boxers ..like himself not to compare with the real few
Francis got the hardest hit ever recorded all he needs to do is hit fury with one good hit and its over, this will be a good fight but Francis has harder pinches than fury
At this point I have to admit, he’s one of the greatest boxers I’ve ever seen. I hope he inspires the young elite champions like Tank Davis to be great.
"have you got a big Corey??" Wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thought he said this was the last fight ? These guys can't make up the minds lol
Stadium wasn’t sold out!!!!
What a clown “ I don’t want to be rich or famous” what a W4nker. AJ beats him
"Big what?"
Fury needs to fight aj or usyk for undisputed champion this mma guy is eazy money for tyson ofc in boxing rules
"America made you a superstar". No, Tyson Fury made Tyson Fury a superstar.
The man is a super heavy weight. He is to big for heavy weights. Period
Please Don’t fight this guy Francis in octagon he built different. Maybe in boxing 🤷🏼
‘Have ya got a big Cory’ 😂😂😂
I love fury but I honestly thought white was gonna win he been waiting for a shot for years you think he would of been more prepared then this but Tyson king 👑 good for him one of the greatest heavyweights
Moddorforker
Ngannou has no chance even in a boxing fight with mma gloves. Thats a bad, bad idea.
Carl frotch is going to bed furious tonight.. 90 000
So no one's going to say anything about sugar Hill not having a shirt on? Lmaoooo boi wtf.
Fury thanks his lord and saviour  Then he asks ngannou about the size of his  JUNK....wtf
Im glad to see Ngannuou make money, but I don't want him to fuck up his fighting style in MMA like McGregor did after he came back from fighting Mayweather
I don’t believe anything fury says and this interview is exactly why…. in about 4 min he said he’s retiring to then promoting a fight with ngannou 😂
Neither 1 of these turds are the Baddest man on the planet
Good job fury Aj showed whyte cant handle those uppercuts good move and dont retire yet still some good fights to have for you
Tyson Fury’s the best heavyweight boxer in the world. Ngannou is BADDEST MFER in the world 🌍
Respect.
Fury has had harder sparring with Tommy fury more like a exhibition fight night in Wembley he’s done amazing and takes it all in his stride fair play 🥊🕺🏻
Can someone pls tell me the name Of the dude in furys camp with the glasses on? Right next to him?
America doesn't need a British superstar but thank you
Much Respect and Love to the Gypsy King for bringing The Predator Francis up on stage and sharing his spot light. These 2 men have the most amazing life journeys, and they give the credit to the Almighty. Get Francis the pay he deserves, and making his dreams come true by boxing the undisputed boxing HW Champion of the World vs The Undisputed MMA HW Champion of the world...... Hybrid rules are great, just make sure to take the shoes off of Tyson, so he has to do something never done in his career, fight bare footed...lol... But real talk
And the sad part is call frodge brought 80,000 into Wembley stadium to you dummy
Did Tyson Fury just say he's 170lbs? He was maybe 170lbs when he was 12 years old.
that easy work for tyson fury
Mike Tyson 😂😂😂😂
Doesn't get any better than beating a guy who has been beaten by every other person in the sport of boxing. Tyson fury sure does not how to pat himself on the back for beating bums
Sit back down you clown..
Tyson and Francis look almost the same height here
It won't happen..You'll see
When is the burger king gonna lose the zip code for his back flab
3:13 Someone tell me what was Fury asking him
wow that's is a history UFC champ vs WBC champ fury vs ngannou next sounds like megafight! biggest ppv ever i love it!
That’s not good he said mma gloves in a ring
Francis can’t box for shit ,,got a big hit tho ,that’s bout it
So you are a top ranked boxer and you go against an unranked 0 experience bad boxer. Who are you kidding😏
Fury   /  Ngannou  66% /    34%
Burger king fury should fight a fighter who can actually fight
Boxers are so scared to fight in MMA. Fury wants a special rules fight😂😂🤡
For a guy ppl say he a HOF he don’t have a HOF resume
Francis looks buzzed 😂
Tyson is so light on his feet!
3:41 English is Francis worst enemy 😂...
Ngannou has a lucky punchers chance but other than that Tyson will pulverize Ngannou.
This is a really awkward friendly way to announce call for a fight
Seriously only people with knowledge, who would normally win a street fight? I mean head is thinking Francis, but if he try to grapple Tyson and get that uppercut 🤣light goes out
I understand Francis has crazy knockout power but does he have the stamina to last 10 rounds? We all know mma fighters are notorious for being gassed after 5
The two baddest man on the planet is going to get it on I can't wait to see it they set to at least to make one hundred million dollars a piece... That is a great Payday for both of them
Lol 🔥🏆
Corey is a popular name in USA. Another word for the male member. I have some traveller friends so I have known the meaning of corey for decades. Very funny when I hear people talking to Corey in American media.🤣🤣🤣
Lol Jones would eat both in a fight
Ok ,now i realize how big francis is🤯🤯🤯
Did Francis say we will find out who is the Baddest Mother Butter on the planet or what lol
Nah if you really want to be great you will fight one more fight against Joshua and prove your really the best of the best... only.the best of the best clears out the division And Joshua is still there
As long as tony bellew gets home to his wife ok that’s what matters 👍🏼
"A BIG WHAAT!" 🤪🤯🥊
Usyk is gonna outbox fury and expose him very bad  Fury knows that very well  He said im retiring why promoting francis 😂😂😂😂 He running from USYK  Select anyone who cant box but people are stupid
remove the copyright claim would ya lads
Fury wants payday!
He said Mike Tyson
so don't care.  francis couldn't even stand with ceril g. tyson fury would embarrass francis so bad.  this ish is getting lame.  that's the state of boxing they all call out ufc dudes.
I hope Fury doesn't fight Ngannou with MMA gloves.  Gives Ngannou a serious punchers chance.  His KO power is scary and he's fast (fought injured last fight for people who reference that). Have to fight completely differerent with tiny gloves. In boxing it would be a serious mismatch obviously.
Ngannou will send Fury to the shadow realm with one of those thunderous KO of his. Fury has never faced a fighter as powerful as Ngannou, all it will take is one hit and it will be night night for Fury.
Fracis should call Thor out because  Fury is out of his league.
2023
I want to see him training in mma.  With his hard worker mentality he could learn a lot. Don't think he's too old for that.
Don't do coke guys
:How big is your corey?"  Legend.
Fury asked him a stupid question...good he was checked accordingly. Tyson displays some sus behaviour and his lack of class tends to show through at times.
...that is no small thing... 😂 😂 😂
No one can quite sell a fight like Francis Ngannou
imagine Francis beating fury in queesberry rules...boxing would be in a weird space
whetever it is....it will be epic...
Make it happen top rank !! you get one over on Dana
Ha!Ha! Tyson Fury is the beast 🙏👍
Rather fight Usyk or Josua!!
What’s up Bernardo
For him to be so big that boy fury can go toe to toe with anybody off of strictly boxing
Fury is out here ending other guy’s career.. really!! Francis gotta watch out real bad!!
Ummm that'll be something
In a real fight Francis destroys Fury with ease, but in pure boxing Fury is too skilled with the hands for him.
Furys easiest fight hes had by far
How are these 2 the same height???
Fucking stupid two different sports completely.
Did Tyson really ask Francis does he have a big willy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fight him in Octagon :) or 2 fights, 1 in UFC and 1 in boxing!
The best part is there's nothing that the UFC can do about him fighting Tyson LOL Uncle Dana about to be mad
Everyone wanna be like maywhether let’s be real and fury respect maywhether Connor may can’t be topped
people were calling fury racist and stuff before but he really isnt, he only did this fight for dillian so he can make some money as he never got as much as this fight before, also big stage.
Betting on Francis Ngannou if it is with MMA gloves. Just one swinging punch and it’s over
I would like to see Tyson beat Usky before retiring
If Furry didnt push him, Furry would hit harder, more damage
Fury vs usyk is the biggest fight to make at heavyweight  then Francis for retirement
hybrid fight... if its boxing with mma gloves, ngannou is gonna get beat up. ngannou is a worse version of wilder.
Whytes Tooth will go for thousands on Ebay.
3:47-3:51 ~ Rather intriguing movements by Fury😂Stellar victory by the way
fury is great but i certainly expected more from whyte. this was no competition. waiting 1500 days and didn’t do shit. he would have been ko’d by wilder too
Tyson would absolutely destroy Nganou 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tyson asked Nganou if he has a big dick? After telling him he’s handsome? Wtf
There's only one Tyson Fury the gypsy King the greatest of all the time 👑❤️💪
Why has sugar got his T-shirt off ?
Boxing rules with MMA gloves would be awesome.
They say Adesanya and Ngannou are 6-4 in height, Francis surely must be 6-6 if Tyson is 6-9
Money fight. Fair play. Ko the UFC hw champ then KO winner of AJ v OU. #Nostoneunturned
he scared of Usyk so he would rather fight an MMA fighter He can't claim he is the best until he beats the best and thats Usyk at the moment
One thing I shud probably say, much respect to both fighters en salute to dillian Whyte he gave out his best of the best, but if anyone noticed he was the aggressor though Tyson fury was very intelligent with higher boxing IQ. Used his reach advantage of 6.9inches to out jab dillian and saw all the loaded shots coming from dillian it was just a matter of time fury to end the match en call it day.
Ngannou says 2023 at the end. That gives Fury time to fight the winner of Usyk-Joshua.
2 bum heavyweight fighters. Sad to see a good sport just going to waste all the talent have gone to the UFC.
Fury is all hype and hasn't fought anyone with real skill. What a boring era for Heavyweight Boxing.
He walked him on to it … perfectly timed punch
Another fixed fight for Tyson Fury 👏
No one can beat fury.he is very big in his division
Damn ngannou really about to get ko’d
Francis and Tyson are going to fight in a literal square circle lol
Tyson Vs Francis that will be the greatest fight the world will ever see**** can't wait to see that happen
I'm a huge fan of Francis Ngannou but seeing Tyson Fury getting him paid big (which he deserves) melts my heart, man. Fury is such a kind sportsman.
"Have you got a big Cory?" LMAO Tyson is such a bro
humble Gypsy king!
A hybrid fight boxing odd rounds and MMA even rounds.
No one comes close to Fury. In the sport of boxing or MMA. He is a freak of nature, an absolute monster. No one can touch this man
Ngganou will lose easy against tyson fury in boxing..but he will get alot of money
Have you got a big *corey*???? LMFAO
Definitely enjoyed seeing Francis there I hope he is able to get this fight with fury if Dana allow it😒😒.
Sugar Hill is always trying to get next to Tyson and on TV. Every bloody interview.
Did fury really ask Francis is he had a big 🍆 ?😂😂😂
I love tyson but he ain't close to being a legend.
Puro boxeador CHAFA le ponen a tayson Fury x eso gana. NO es un verdadero peso pesado como lo fue Mike Tayson.
HAVE YOU GOT A BIG COREY???
What did Fury say before Francis said what? I didn't understand as well.
Bang!! He landed like a peach!!🤣🤣
AJ and Usyk fans diminish more and more after each new W for Tyson
Let them box with mma gloves like Fury said...Francis would be sleeping very early.
With mma gloves I honestly think Francis has a good chance of winning
I didn’t know that Tyson Fury and Francis got along and at first I thought that he was calling him out aggressively but I’m glad that he didn’t cus well all know what would’ve happened considering how big they are
Dana White's head must have exploded when he saw that. Ngannou will make more in Tyson Fury fight than he will his entire ufc career past and present combined. I hope he leaves UFC to teach them a lesson about ripping off fighters.
Man he's going to hold those belts for a long time.
2:31 the interviewer saying 'american made you a superstar' what a egoistical thing to say.he made himself a superstar
TYSON FURY WANTS FACE FRANCIS NGANNOU AT MMA NEXT LETS GO THIS FIGHT IS SO HARDCORE BOUT IM THINK SO
Ngannou wants to box just to loose. He has no chance at all.  It's a joke !! and I am a hardcore UFC fan.
But but I thought boxing is a black mans sport 😆
I want to see Tyson fight AJ or Usyk (or both) but in my eyes he's cemented himself as a legend and if he wants to retire then he deserves it
3:19 cringe
I bet AJ is glad he wasn’t in there …would’ve been another defeat
Seeing Fury and Francis stand side by side. All I have to say is, don’t do it Francis. I’d rather see Francis/Wilder. And I’d bet the house on Wilder
That would definitely be a mega fight. Hope it happens Tyson all day.
Tyson Fury knows the Weakness Of Dillian Whyte he watch the last Fight of Dillian Whyte loss Against Anthony Joshua and ALEXANDER POVETKIN 1 by this he easy Beat him Dillian Whyte
SIGN THE CONTRACT BIG BOY SIGN THE CONTRACT.
I wounder was his best mate Daniel watching..
94,000 people. Wtf 😮
He tells the British he's retired Then that.  OK
Why Sugarhill take his shirt off?
This is not belly dancing this is heavy weight boxing , tyson is hilarious.
He’s not gonna retire
he can survived 3 fights with wilder who hits like a sledgehammer, i think be just fine with ngannou
Francis looking confident and a big boy himself.. That will be an awesome fight! Well done Gypsy KING!
Tyson fury is 6’9/6’10. Francis is 6’4. But in this interview he looked about 6’8 😂
Francis hanging around begging to get paid...
Have you got a big Corey lmao, Fury is a mad man.
No no no no no Fury vs Ngannou is absolutely not what anybody wants to see for fuck sake
Tyson horrifically racist ‘have you got a big corey’ (meaning penis)……..
Francis just doesn't give a fuck
TYSON THE GYPSY KING FURY VS OLEXANDR USYK. NEXT FOR UNDISFUTED CHAMPIONSHIP
Man said have u got a big Corey?? . 😂 😂 Mad man
Why do they look so similar in height they're supposed to be 5 inches apart?
Whyte wanted a bigger share of the purse? What a fraud!!
He will slaughter Francis boxing.
Dillian is a horrible boxer bro let’s be honest UK boxers in general are horrible boxers except fury 🤣I seen dillian enough on sky sports for me to make this conclusion he’s so horrible
Typical Tyson asking Nganou about his knob lol
Yeah man what a finish! And now against Ngannou 👊🏻
I ain't feeling he knocking out all these black guys..I'll been and popped his big ass🤣😂 naw he cool tho lol
Dillian payday
Its boxin fury would win
Check Ngannou out, now he knows he's on the big stage, stadiums with the capability of hitting over 100 thousand 😂😂 That shit you chat maybe cute in UFC, but this is England and you will get your face punched right in if you try swim in deep end with Fury, 1 oz, 3oz, or 36 oz, this aint your game fella. Get your big payout, hopefully have all your faculties in check, don't end up with brain damage and live a nice life brother.
Fury asking Francis does he have a big dick 😂 😂
You gotta big Corey In Gypsy slang is you gotta big d!ick ? Lol
This is actually the most competitive fight for Tyson Fury available. With mma gloves Fury's margin for error will be astronomically smaller than he's used to. I'd favor Ngannou if I'm being honest
Dana white - Sean assemble the lawyers
Thats the true baddest mother fucker belt
Fury would annihilate ngannu
A lot of big things in this conversation.
Great Fight
Don't think Whyte will be all that bothered he gets 20% of 41 million. that's $8.2 million not a bad retirement check.
Tyson fury is the goat
LMAO Tyson asking if Ngannou has a big dick live on TV 3:13. This man is outta control ahahahaha. Love this guy!
https://youtu.be/BSOJZ9_KdW8
Whyte done by the uppercut again. Easy fight for Fury, jab and run, Whyte couldn't do anything. Proper shit fight, the uppercut from Fury was the only interesting part of the fight. 🥊  Fury said he is retiring, if that is the case, he will never be the best because he hasn't fought the best. Spent his career ducking the top fighters. Unless he fights AJ or Usyk, he will never be the best.
Ofcourse ducking AJ and Usyk cause they are top fighters and wants another easy fight with Ngannou...typical ducker. Will never be the best.
I don’t mind this cause Francis seems like actually he prefers to stand up with his opponent instead of trying to have gay sex in the ground. “A punchers chance” increases at such a heavy weight
Hope he gets home to he's wife and kids safely
Francis got this
He should get the respect he deserves I know the world treats gypsy people different but tyson fury is a legend❤️
Tyson will never get the credit he deserves. Well done classy act
*I hope they NEVER fight. Francis’s ONLY chance is a lucky punch.* I want to see Fury retire undefeated. He should only return to fight Usyk or AJ. Francis should fight Whyte, Wilder, DuBois or someone else.
Full of shit. he's not retiring. It's all set up for the coaxing him out of alleged retirement for big $$
fury will eat that Francis it will be like wilder vs fury but much easier. fury tactics in the ring and ring I.Q will be too much.
Have you got a big Cory lol
"You got a big tory?" Shit I'm American and I understand straight away lol
Fury should fight Usman since he's also 170
Ok he's gonna make such quick work of francis . Lmao francis isn't even close to a skilled boxer .and so far from.the best even at hw.. and he's gonna fight the best hw boxer ever in boxing rules lol.
Nygannou by knockout r3
I never liked fury’s attitude but he deserves to be who he is. Congratulations to fury and whyte for making it home and I hope fury goes undefeated until retirement
The con changes tongue in a sec
Wrong guy. Should be calling USYk Joshua
Fury wants to fight a MMA fighter but not AJ? I mean he would be favourite to beat AJ but come on.
This is Bob Arum bitch slapping Dana White.
Tim Bradley predicted a right upper cut k.o
On drugs, look at Fury's eyes.
Fury dominates Francis it's too easy
Easy work Fury
Oh so fury is fighting again haha
Francis has no change. boxing is different game than mma. if the fight will happen we gonna see a much easier fight look a like wilder vs fury LoL.
3:50 ''Mike Tyson'' 💀💀😂
Fury will walk through Francis
NGANNOU HAVE NO CHANCE VS FURY
Nobody notice how tyson asks ngannou if he has a big d*ck, what a legend hahahah
no one's talking about Tyson asking has he got a big corey lmao
Fury will absolutely destroy Ngannou.
Nganou lookin for that payday....he aint got no business in boxing....
U know that Ngannoa can maul half of the people who are in the ring 😂💀
The Predator can ko Fury if he manages his cardio well & doesn't waste punches 🥊  Bear in mind there are more break times in boxing than mma . 2ndly each boxing round is 3 mins long as opposed to 5 mins in mma.  Lastly Fury will be wearing mma gloves which could be his downfall . 🤔
BIG MAN  AMAZING CAREER  LEGENDARY END  RESPECT THE GYPSY KING  HE DESERVES EVERY SINGLE PENNY
If Tyson can give Francis a dance thats respect, make some money boyz nothing personal.
Why is suga hill shirtless? Lol
fight usyk u wnker
HE CONTRADICTS HIMSELF SMH TFURY SHOULD FIGHT USYK ATLEAST
Legend     🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was a Sparring session whyte got took to school 📝
Dylan "uppercut" white. fury learns of povetkin.
Get Francis paid 👍 he deserves a shot and the pay day.
Tyson, a humble legend of the art. Inspite of all the glitz and glamor he still knows whats important and that is God, family and friends. The Hall of Famer.THE GYPSY KING.
Fury is about the only heavyweight about, the rest are not even a good 2nd. Its probably the poorest heavyweight division in the last 20 years.
So he decides to avoid aj and usyk but goes straight after Francis what a joke
There is better then this  Alecsander Usik can beat Fury He is even more technical boxer  match smaller then Fury but my money on Alex if this fight will go down , Usik in his Prime fenomenal boxer fransis got no chance if it's a boxing fight Fury should make his last fight against Usik and if he wins he better of retire undefeated... If he will do it and win like that  He will join 2 fighters Mike and Ali  , he has Klichko and Wilder on his hit list but one more hard aponet wiil put him in history for god
THERES ONLYYYYY ONEEEEEEE TYSON FURYYYY
A big what 🤔
Have ya got a big cordy 😂😂
Im a Francis will get startched by Fury guy but i didnt know the were talking about using 4 oz. Gloves. Francis power with those little glove is insane. That could equalize the fight. Fury will get cut or go to sleep if Ngannou touches his face.
Fury is a good man.
Time for Francis to finally eat big. It will be a big pay day should the fight happen in boxing.
Big Cory 🤣🤣🤣
Francis don’t do it. It’s a setup. Fury will Jab ur head of this planet. We love u Francis
Mike Dyson
They need to do special rules Boxing and MMA like ONE championship did for Rodtang and Mighty Mouse DJ
Francis should have said: “yeah and it’s bigger than yours” 😂
Francis is happy cause fighting fury is going to make him a multi millionaire I’d be smiling to.
Why hasn't  Dillon been interviewed.
Lol Jesus what was that ending 😅😅
wtf that was awkward
“Are you done Tyson?” “Yes” “Is this your next fight Tyson?” “Yes”
I didn't think Francis was that tall. Might be an interesting fight if he can get conditioned to fighting in boxing
I have boxed for 20 years and never have we been allowed 'Body Protectors' up to our rib cage. Why are pro's allowed this protections?
Fury just asked ngannou if he had a big 🍆
Fury congratulations  You smashed his face
Quite literally the two baddest men on the planet
Have you got a big Kori 😂😂
and the new chisora ha
“Good lookin’ chavvy” have you got a big corey” lol funny as fuck
Not interested in Nganu, only with Usyk Joshua winner
you got a big corry haha
Huge payday for Francis
A great knockout! a good fighter!
I want Fury to finish AJ once and for all and then finish his career off with an easy win against Usyk and sail off into the sunset.
Francis aren't you injured
Francis can't do any worse than Dillian Whyte tonight. And if they fight with 4 ounce MMA gloves, then I'm sure Ngannou will at least connect a few times.   Bring on Ngannou vs Fury. It's a freakshow fight, but it will be fun. Fury will promote the hell out of it. They should do a media tour in Africa too. The whole planet will be talking about that fight.
Will be the biggest fight in history
Nganou does not stand a chance you can't play boxing
I'm am MMA guy but Francis has no chance against The Gypsie King
Fury just asked Ngannou if he had a big dick 😂😂😂😂
Damn I like Tyson I really think this man will fight Frances in a bar knuckle  type match with ufc gloves the closest thing win lose or draw he will make his predecessor proud being the gypsies love bare knuckle and co.e up fighting  this way
Why did Fury want to know if Francis had a big penis ???
Yeah ok, mma gloves but if its only punching than Francis will be gone in no time...
I think Francis could be a member of the Big Johnson Company...
Happy St George's day 😃
Literally nobody asking for fury vs Francis. We want fury vs aj-usyk winner. We don’t want to see garbage fights!
Pound 4 pound..#1spence#2tyson fury#3canelo#4crawford#5joshtaylor..my top lb/lb
Either Francis is 6'7, or Tyson Fury lies about his height......
A disappointing bout overall. A lot of hype and not much else.
fury and francis lowkey were besties on that ring lmao
Is it me or fury isn’t 6’9 he is probably 6’6
I'll be glad to see Francis get paid for that fight, but he seriously doesn't stand a chance against Fury in anything but full MMA rules.
Only person I wanna see tyson fight is usyk because Joshua and francis would be too easy for him hopefully fury stays for usyk
He wants to help N'gannou get a payday he can't get in the UFC. Good man.
The best heavyweight of the last 10 years..Nobody could beat him right now..He will KO both Usyk and Joshua
In a boxing match it's 75/25 for Fury, in an mma match it's 100/0 for Ngannou imo
Love ya Tyson but we gotta see the Usyk fight after Usyk finishes Joshua
Ohhhh you cheating on UFC, i going to go tell Uncle Dana about this, Francis and you sir going to be in big trouble 😎
I’m a huge Francis fan but I think fury is only man alive that beats him
In a boxing match no matter the gloves fury wins and Francis can retire if it's an MMA match Francis wins easy and still probably retires and sail off into the sunset either way congrats on a excellent career to fury who'll go down as a heavyweight legend
Nobody wants to see this go fight for undisputed
Damn fury makes Francis look small, wtf
Always sugar trying to get in front of the camera
There’s only oneee Tyson furyyy
im just not that interested
Close fight.   Early stoppage after a push.   Run it back.
I still find it hilarious when the interviewer apologises for somebody cursing. People are trying to kill each other in the ring for christ sake!😅
I love this because normally DAna would announce fights before they happen , Francis doing the same to Dana hahaha
Ngannou has had one of the hardest lives you could hear about and the ufc isnt helping him to guarantee his future financially. I think fury is just tryna help him.
still not the fight we all wanted we want fury v AJ
Wait what was Tyson asking Francis lol?
Francis just wants some of that boxing money because hes greedy. Fury would beat him in the ring or the octagon since Fury was a wrestler as well as a boxer. I believe that even a middle weight like Canelo would KO Francis within 6 rounds. Someone that just trains punches all day and night, everyday, is going to be a way better and harder puncher than even your best MMA puncher.
come on mate let’s be real who has fury beat?  the problem is Fury fans blow his win way out of proportion . Povetkin knocked Whyte out cold no push Whyte did not even get back to his feet. Why are people not calling povetkin the Goat? Fury pushes Whyte down and now he’s the greatest it’s just insane.
WWE is More believable
Fury will Kill that MF.  MMA hates seeing all their bad asses come to boxing and get WAXED! 😆
🇨🇲 ♥️🇬🇧
🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆🦆 Usyk.
The guy beside him in glasses was kissing every guy in the ring after the fight. 🤔
I love Ngannou but Tyson beats him everyday outta the week in a boxing ring but with these new crossover rules with mma gloves them body shots & every other punch would hurt like crazy & in the heavyweight division anything can happen all it takes is one punch to end the fight & that evens the fight up by 30% imo!
Tyson big up for putting francais on like that.  He knows Francais worth, and in an effort to get the attention of the ufc to make mega bucks . I hope it happens Francais is under appreciated and under valued by the ufc
LMAO He called him Mike Tyson LMFAO! Mike Tyson said it best he named himself after the best boxer in History
Fury v Klitscko  for i billion for the ukraines.
Dana sitting on the couch with howler head mobling that fu*king illegal.
Tyson has thrown that uppercut like a 154 pounder :), amazing.
Let’s go Dana back Francis vs  Fury
I like francis but no way he wins this
All staged
LoL ok so that wasn't a fight for fury...I love all you MMA buttboys but get used to it boxers are the best true fighters on earth...the lot of you others have cute moves and all that but none of you last half a fight with a real boxer
From what fury displayed tonight, A sound Usyk beats tyson......
What a boring division
your overusage of words 'highlight reel" shows you don't know what the phrase means or are removing any meaning by said overusage. "highlight reel" LOL
Love Ngannou but he gets knocked out without landing a single punch in a boxing match. Too slow and not enough volume
Ngannou's reach is pretty much identical to Fury's  Same weight as well expect he's all muscle
Ngannou will knock fury out
Pointless fight imo. Nganou would get smashed
Fury’s a good dude trying to get Ngannou paid and getting his old friend Whyte a great retirement check
I hope one day my wife looks at me like Sugar looks at Tyson
Holyshit 😲
Awesome can't wait 😉
Tyson class
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4zbNZKxudp4 FULL KO ALL ANGLES
Fury ends Francis
Please do not do a cross over fight! Yiurvthe best boxer, dont tarnish your legacy like Floyd has
2:53 Francis is surprised someone is taller than him
TRIAD COMBAT  FURY  VS.  NGANNOU   💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Tyson is just a great laugh ..and the number 1  hw boxer in the world.
fury the black man destroyer
What a fight I’m so happy with the uppercut shot that’s incredible moment for boxing 🥊 and for British heavyweight championship fight! This one is for the books I’m so happy Tyson let us English fans watch the fight on the uk time! Haha to the rest of the world 🤪😜   Gypsy king 👑
Get that dude with the mic out of there
Francis actually does not look that small compared to Tyson fury
Uh oh.... Francis done did it again! I would have loved to see Uncle Dana's reaction when seeing this! 😤😤😤
Usyk would destroy him 💯
Only threw one uppercut!
FRANCIS NGANNOU WOULD PUT TYSON IN A CLOSED CASKET
His brother beside him is not 100% clear in his head I think 🧐
Go Tyson! We hope you do some more fights. You are an amazing heavyweight champion! It's a pleasure to watch.
Dude just straight-up asked a guy if he has a big cori...
3:49 Frank Warren looking at Francis like - Keep dreaming 🙄
Dildo Whyte sucks.
LMAO could not even tell that was Francis in the background. Would love to see this fight happen.
FRANCIS WOULD MURDERRRRRRR FURY YOU TALKING ABOUT A REAL WARRIOR THE HARDEST HITTER EVER !! NGANNOU WOULD FUCK HIM UP !💯 2 ROUNDS ALL FRANCIS NEEDS IS ONE SHOT AND TEDDY ATLAS WAS TRAINING FRANCIS HE WOULD GIVE TYSON THE WORKS
You got a big Corey like wtf 🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
Everytime Whyte has been dropped it's been to an upercut, Fury's gameplan was always to get him swinging and pick him off.
If it's boxing, Fury takes it easy. He's the most conditioned fighter of his time.
fury is a giant we know,but damn ..ngannou doesn't look small next to him at all,He's a monster of a man.
i don't think Dana Approve this Fight..
I literally kept telling u delusional dillian fans he's an easy fight for Tyson
Tyson Fury v Ngannou is gonna be the biggest fight ever!
Le dan atole con el dedo ala afición
Fury is pretty big for a 170 pounder.
Se los dije es puro circo estas peleas  que son obvias quien va a a ganar
Dana is scared now
francis will leg kick him
Zzz boring
Ngannou has no chance but go get paid son you've earned it
Whyte was lazy not in shape too heavy , pathetic performance
In a boxing match fury wins. But in mma Tyson will br flattened by Ngonnou!
Most incredible uppercut I have ever seen to close a championship fight x
Hybrid fight wat a clown it’s gonna be either boxing or mma, if it happens it’s gonna be boxing no such thing as mixed rules fight
Hahahaha WHYTE Is Done
TBE
Now the Americans have to give our guy credit 🇬🇧
ESPN smart for setting it up
Tyson helping Dillian make some bread, you are a legend mate.
I thought he said he was retiring 😂
He should fight winner of Usyk vs Joshua 2 !
Fury won the fight easily 😂
Obviously tyson doesn't watch the blacked videos
LMAO at Francis sizing up Fury 2:52
Thought he was retiring 😂😂😂😂😂never listen to a word the fury family say ever
Hopefully it's not a boxing match between the two...we all know how that will go, so if I'm honest idk what they should do.
This gonna be great
Francis will make more money from a Fury fight than he would from 1000 UFC fights. Dana White and his mob pocket like 70% of the purse of these guys. That's why Francis left.
"There's not a man born from his moo'vuh can beat me." ~ Tyson Fury
Have you got a big Corey 🤦‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂😂
Im a fan of Boxing but that guy Ngannou is the real Baddest man on the Planet
lmao if this happen ngannou get smoke in 3
Nice that Francis gonna get paid big but no need for 4oz gloves unless it's MMA, just do boxing. Would rather watch Fury fight the winner of Joshua vs Usyk 2...
Ngannou gonna take this. Let’s go!! 🔥
Francis sounds like a lil kid cursing 😂😂😂
Wants to fight a UFC fighter but not the winner of Uysk vs Joshua.
Whyte took a dive lmaoo cmon man wtf was that
Fury may not of been In Whytes head in the build up. But was definitely in his head the whole fight. Whyte's best combo of the night... Elbow, Elbow , Headbutt.... Same way he beat Parker..
Tyson setting easy money for life just like Mayweather did with Connor.
Easy work
NO one can beat him!
Boring ass fight thts why I stick to ufc boxing all hugs
ONE PUNCH KO ABSOLUTELY A MASTERCLASS ! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Whyte was robbed of a fair chance, standing in the freezing cold for 32 minutes, how big was that ring? #FuryWhyte2 needed.
Fury is knocking out all the black guys because the black boxing fanbase are so annoying with race card. You gotta respect it.
HYBRID RULES?? LOL I can see Francis forgetting its hybrid before going for a takedown followed by submission lol
Joshua was there why didn’t he call Joshua out
Francis is only 6'4 how comes he's as tall as furyb6'9
Francis will get knocked out too…. People are delusional.
Makes Francis look small lol
Look at Frank Warren, Always looks like he's got a face like a slapped arse.
Special rules. Boxing is boxing. Training consists of  Boxing all day and night. That's all you do. Mma several aspects of combat. Each one segregated to its own time frame comparative to just boxing. The ratio to discipline is far weaker in mma to just purely boxing. Francis ground game is developing. Still weak. Should be kickboxing. Fight needs to be conducted on fair ground.
Francis you get your jaw rocked and your confidence will be shot once again going into your next Ufc fight
Congratulations to the champ
If he's fighting again it better be the winner of Usyk-Joshua
fury is gonna outbox him, make him tired and knock him out.. all respect to francis but no one can win fury..
Whyte would look like Sugar Ray Robinson.. Against Fury. Against any UFC fighter in a boxing ring. Absolute joke..
the ref had to stop it dillians legs was like a newborn giraffe when he got up
Fury made that look like nothing what a shot, Jesus. Ngannou getting uppercutted to the heaven's too. Fury ending careers, first Wilder, then Whyte.
Francis, you are not a Boxer. Lol. DANA GONNA SUE EVERYONE FOR THIS FAKE CALL OUT LOL
Fury threw the first uppercut of the whole fight and it knocked Shyte out 👊🏻🎇
So disappointed with Dillian, the only way he ever got knocked out was by uppercut. Gotta learn from your mistakes somehow 🤦🏻‍♂️
Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou might not be a competitive fight but it will definitely be a huge PPV... *Hope it truly comes to fruition* 👏
That was too easy for Fury.
First...  bitches
