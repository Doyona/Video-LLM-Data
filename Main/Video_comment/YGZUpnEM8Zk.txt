Up the foxes 🦊
Been 8years since you tried the first FIFA ever😢
Big out 😂
imagine theyve been playing 7 a side there for years
Ngl kinda reminds me of Danny williams🤠😂
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
10/10 ending, retired as a champ
Why don't you have some kind of series like ‘go easy with freezy’ or ‘stay buzy with freezy’ You can do literally anything
SO CORNY NGL
One of the best yet still in the championship
The entire staff seemed lovely - respect to the team!
Bro u built like a skinny version of a giraffe u couldn't even handle one match in the prem yet alone doing this challenge
Why the fk did i get a stand with isreal add??!!!!
Bring back the cook off, vs each sidemen, beta squad, that's a good amount of videos and longer series
the cringe
Intro with the fifa 14 song is class
I’ve been to Seagrave myself and it’s absolutely incredible in person
Cleetus McFarland lookin ahh
The music in the background being banging old fifa tunes 😍
cal bringing all the fifa bangers is so underrated as well
❤️💪🔥⚽ Cool video😊
Just a feel good vid
Theo:"breaking news calcrezy signed for leicester city.😐"
Nice to see my foxes get some recognition again
This is actually a fantastic video. Cheers to Leicester for the full access and being chill on camera.
Frezzy deliverring underrated banger videos recently
U should bring zerkaa for cook off or mm7 or vik that's easy wins
1.48 u  look like a cheap copy of peter crouch lol
I love my club, class from you cal!
so youve become an inbred footballer
are you peter crouch?
Feel bad for frenzy that this video hooned. It’s such a banger, but the views don’t reflect it
HAHA the cursed photo is so good
Big shout out to Leicester for being this open with a Youtuber coming to record a video at their training ground. The staff being on camera didn’t feel as forced as it usually does with these kind of videos which is a big W. Great and entertaining video overall😁
Leicester simply the best apart from last season let's just forget about last season please
what a video!!! really enjoyed it mate, well executed and edited
i drew to u in fifa at westfield
since when did mcburnie play for Leicester
As a Leicester fan all my life, ty so much
Fun fact: my dad is a lorry driver and he delivered sand about a year ago for this place
Big up freezy for doing it with Leicester
Yes cal what a player
All the bone cracking edits wer so unnecessary but brilliant 😂😂
I was working on that site when it was getting built a few year ago. It’s mad to see it finished
huge thanks to harry maguire who paid for most of that training facility
as a leicetser fan that has met kieran this is cool
Leicester fan bro welcome❤
You are literally living my dream being a leicester fan since I was 4
Enzo telling him to get out because he’s a bin dipper. My gaffer 😍😍😍
Ending is soooo cold 🤞🏼😤
Football vids dont get the views they used to back in the day, but I hope yall (Cal, Simon, Tobi, Manny etc.) keep on doing these still. Loved every second of this ❤️
Cmon leicester
As Leicester City fan this guy is the goat now
Can’t lie this video was sh**
The song at the start is amazing. Miss Fifa 14
We want scott
Man goes Matip 😂😂
W freezy video as per usual
Beautiful selection of background music this vid
never would have thought cal would have done this at my club
Love this as a Leicester fan just seeing how it would be like in sea grave what a class video
The little chat with Enzo😂 he seems like a really chill gaffer
I've had the pleasure of meeting KDH on the dome and he was a top bloke I even got the chance to go in goal for a penalty against him 👌🏻👊🏻
How does freezy get clearance for his music. They're fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
as a leicester fan i absolutely loved this
im foxes fan glad to see you there
The fifa song in the beginning of the vid is making me cry of joy
I'm a Leicester fan so this was great to watch 😁
Charles Bronson doing the news?
This was fucking great mate!
as a leicester fan, i would welcome u to the club with open arms freezy. keep up the gd vids :)
Oh god the musicccc, back to my xbox dayss
De gea?  (Joke)

My Club 💙🦊
Harry Winks, Jamie Vardy, KDH and now calfreezy! STRAIGHT BACK UP STRAIGHT BACK UP LEICESTER CITY!!!

The creaks in the medical are killing me 😂😂

As a leicester fan from czech republic I am so happy
Leicester fan since 2015 as I am not from England. W cal
Love this as a Leicester fan
cal doing this video is the same as if vik decided to do this video 😆both have 0 football skills
This vid slapped tbf cal
bros just lived my lifelong dream
So cool 😂
Love me again gives me fucking chills
Loved every moment of this. It was filmed and edited so well
Cal was definitely the water boy for his school team
relegated
That training ground is fucking class
Just an FYI better help has been in a lot of legal issues with breaking HIPAA laws. I know many creators accept it so it seems like a good company but it's not and only does harm to the people who have and will use them. Next time regardless if you think it's a good company please research it before promoting
6:44 I guess you could say Calfreezy got a Calf-freezy ahah
Kdh what a sound lad
eilte video
As a Leicester fan this is just amazing to see Simon come and play for Leicester City <3
Yoooo Leicester City mentioned
Class video
this was quality icl kiers reaction was priceless with your free kicks
This is really cool, life long Leicester fan and I know they’ve been weirdly secretive about the training ground and stuff. Love it
https://youtu.be/gS_dUtkY3U0?si=0wVb-5RkeVRLtfKv
Thought it was Peter Crouch when he had the kit on
coys
is vardy retired
You look like a £1 Cole Palmer. 😂
I have been a massive Leicester fan my whole life and this video is amazing. Come on the foxes. What a dream come true to watch this
Up the lcfc wheyy
Advertising ‘paid’ mental health support… ridiculous
Him meeting Enzo was so uncomfortable to watch 😂
This is a class video...one of my most fav videos you've posted and entertaining evey second
Below average is very good, is below average among professional footballers.
Tbh, Leicester could probably walk the Championship even with Freezy in the team
COYF 🦊
Love this collab. The leicester is going up 🔵🦊
That news reporter is my favourite of all time
Not the video ending like an African movie
Vichai had a dream, He bought a football team, He came from Thailand and now he’s one of our own We play from the back and counter attack Champions of England, You made us sing that!
14:16 didn't win the Champions League, washed and overrated player
Do old fifa songs not get copyright strikes?
I assume they have nets and they don't just have a multi million pound facility where the balls keep getting stuck above the goal on the training pitch haha
FLAMBOYANT ESPIONAGE
W video
Look like a teenager who hasnt hit puberty yet that chest 😂
Another banger
Amazing video, especially with the FIFA anthems aswell playing from time to time.
That intro for a championship club is class
1 hour gang
FIFA tunes are top quality 😍🙏
LCFC
Cramp in the Calf? Call him CalfFreezy
state of the art training facility and cant stay in the premier league
As a Leicester fan this was unexpected but I love it
Leicester spending that Maddison money😎
Freezy videos slap harder than sidemen videos these days and im bloody here for it
Smashed it. What a great video.
The Coach Carter ending hahaha, fucking love it lol
legendary video
title should be "I wasted a football clubs time and annoyed them all , the day before they played a massive cup game"
Leicester till I die 💙🤍
We get it, you liked ur own comment and 1 hour gang…
I recently begun making YouTube videos of my travels. Any advice on how I can improve them would mean a lot!
its crazy thinking this training facility looks 1000 times better compared to united's training facility😂
Its crazy how nuts this facility is but that is pretty much on par if not inferior to most US College facilities for their American football teams 😂
This cal guy looks like he reeks of them sour cream pringles
been a Leicester fan my whole life so absolutely love the collab Freezy keep it up and thank you to Leicester City for making it possible
Leicesters training ground is just mad 🔥
up the foxes
prime Sami Hyypia wit the shirt tucked in
Epic
Leicester signed him cause they saw what he achieved in the QPR career mode
Phenomenal video Cal! Loved it 🔥👏
Your my dewsbury hallllll
How is Freezy 28, man that makes me feel old
cal would be a great signing for us foxes, jamie vardy regen
Leicester getting promoted and winning the premier league again after this marquee signing
28😳 more like mid 30s 😂
Good to see jamie vardy reading out the news headline
Who needs Mbappe when they have Calfreezy 🐐
