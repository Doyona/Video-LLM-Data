On a scale of 1 (quite excited) to 10 (SO EXCITED), how excited are you for this special? 👀
Who here after Sand Job😂
Uwielbiam ich oglądać, są niesamowici, czym będzie amazon gdy ich zabraknie? chcę ich oglądać do końca życia :)
Hell of a soundtrack!
When they did speed runs in the tunnel why didn't they start at the end and drive out? It didn't make sense to me the way they did it.
*The Grand Tour for Actors*  Join Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Chris Pratt and Kristen Bell as they travel across all around the USA on their Grand Tour. A show about adventure, excitement and friendship… as long as you accept that the people you call friends are also the ones you find extremely hilarious. Sometimes it’s even a show about cars, reviewing Italian and British classics, hot hatchbacks, muscle cars, pick-up trucks, luxury vehicles, movie-stars and more.  Cast: *Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Kristen Bell*
One of the best specials they’ve done on the grand tour imo
you guys killed it . good job keep it going!!
Where can i find this variant of this song? 🤔
Because
L😊😅😮😢
Good
live forever never die please.
I live in Kiruna. Kinda crazy seeing those three up here 🤯
The real reason to renew my Amazon Prime Subscription, again. Miss that trio. Can't wait.
After a long time great ep. like once oldays👍
One of the best Special ever😍😍😍
I hope they make more episodes... I need enough episodes of them so I can show my kids one day
SO EXCITED SO VERY EXCITED
ooohhh yeeeeaahh! the best trio in the world is back! 😃👍
Im about to star shilling amazon subsriptions, just so i could see some more of these guys.
I've just finished to watch it and guys I'm gonna be honest, this is one of the best episode I ever seen throughout their career.
Evo just hooked me, i am in!
Why it was over again 😭😭 neeed new Ep
Screw May for killing the Evo!!!
Everytime I wonder when the new special is out there's a new one and this is no different
That was incredible! One of the best episods. Thx u! Its a pity, that i cant pay amazon to see it officially, cos this racist rules "if u r russian, get off"... well, at least i transferred that money for dog shelter )
As an Audi A4 owner who desperately wants an S4 watching Jeremy ruin the OG RS4 just breaks my heart.
Best show as always.... They killed me when pushing Hammond through the red slope....So much laugh...
This was a great special! I've wateched it three times now.
12 out of 10.... I don't understand why Amazon spent billions to drive people mad at them with LOTR, when they can do more like this.
Just finish watching it. Once again they delivered 100%. So funny !! I hope they will continue to make more of these specials. Cheers 🥂
Omg. Did saw the episode and is awesome especially the end omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. You 3 make such a great team.   Wondering if they are going to make episode 2 ?? It can't end there.  👍👍👌👌💪💪
You have to acept they're not so young anymore and they cannot quite do the same stunts they used to. They each have their own individual projects. Still felt happy to see them back togerher altough I felt something was missing. Felt bad for James May accidents, glad he's okay.
This is awesome! I hope they don’t ruin a evo doing it!
Ruddy Nora! Simply brilliant!
It was fantastic, nice job boys.

If you wanna be successful, you most take responsibility for your emotions, not place the blame on others. In addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults, pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability. There's always a risk in every investment, yet people still invest and succeed. You most look outward if you wanna be successful in life.
Just finished it. That scene of Hammond trying to get up that hill has to be the funniest thing I’ve seen this year.
Just finished watching. Absolutely loved it. Nicely done. Just so happen to love all three of the primary vehicles in this as well.
So stoked!!
Is there a new season coming? Idc about these long films as much
Best birthday gift I couldt ask for! 🥳
Shame none of them got a Volvo, it's pretty much the only Scandinavian car left.
10
10/10 excited for more James, Jeremy and Richard!
Love the totally underwhelming title. Thats how you make titles.
Old mans...
This is why I pay for prime, nevermind lord of the rings
What can go wrong?
OHHH Yes !!!!!!
Yes j'espère qui sera meilleur que l episode sor les voitures françaises,  car je m'en fou qu'il parle de mon pays ,mais en toute objectivité il étais nul a chier cette épisode  .  Vous étiez bien en-dessous de vos capacités habituelle.   A bientôt l équipe. 😉😉
Excellent, gentleman's
oh yes please... i'll take one of each car please...
come to iraq again 😂
Теперь можно все воровать из русского ютуба
I appreciate the classic title pun 😂❤️
Of course James has a matching outfit to his EVO, what a fashion icon!
Heck yeah. Keep them coming.
Suomi mainittu!
Can't wait
They looking like a bunch of legends
From Russia with love❤
УРАААА
this episode better be 3 hours long! been waiting ages for this😅
😂😂😂😂👍😎
Beyond Excited!
Love for these trio, comes right after my parents
10
as an avid viewer of Top Gear way back when it was a 'boring' show for anoraks, I do love these three muppets in their latest incarnation that is TGT... now when TF is there gonna be Funko POPs of them all??????
So glad there is more coming
I think i’m speaking for everyone here when i say that we want another series like the first three… we miss you so much guys….
YES!!!!! YES YES YES YES!!!!! It was time!!!
жду с нетерплением!😃
I'm proud I grew up with those guys
Great. In the interim between new films, I just constantly loop through their old stuff. And never get bored.
JEREMY BROUGHT AN AUDI... oh yeah AND THERE BACKKKKK and old...
this is going to be one of the legendary series
with this trailer 0 :))
CROCOP 😁
Жду не дождусь
was fun meeting the gang alittle outside Tromsø    just chillin at a Gas Station xD
Finally.
Buffeting Buffeting....  How hard can it be? to be in Wilderness..... 😍 Eagerly waiting
how old is that photo at the end of the video or have they de-aged the trio using Marvel and ILM movie tricks?
Man I don’t give a FUCK about no “Grand Tour”
С нетерпением жду выпуска,спасибо вам за то что вы есть🥳
ancient fossils are still at it
Oui on vous adore c'est super bien t'inquiète juste avant qu'il se font la gueulej'espère pas tu vas te prendre une voiture que je connais déjà Jérémy Carson j'espère que tu vas pas oh
As a Croat the only thing I can conect this song to is Mirko Cro Cop entry..
Чекаєм!
Welcome back brothers! 🫡
I'VE OVERDONE IT...
It has arrived
OMG this looks amazing, cannot wait :D
I can't  wait.... shove it into my veins right now
Can we stop 🛑 with the rings 💍 of power and make more of these?
Bring it on!
Good to hear James is OK after the crash and I can't wait for this one.
Those three are the embodiment of "there are no bad ideas"
Now I'm EXCITED AF
I love you and this channel and who ever runs them, thank you for the funny shorts you post I respect it
Looks like its time for a monthly prime sub again
You just know this is going to be epic!
My youngest daughter learned her first swear words watching the boys in Top Gear ...  she knows more about cars than most the kids in high school.  I owe them so much.  thank you - can't wait to watch!
thank everything, i could use some great laughs from these geniuses! ❤️
James, Hammond and Clarkson will single handedly save Amazon after they show that horrendous Lord of the Rings garbage.
Can't wait!
I don’t mean to sound rude - but about god damn time I was going through GT withdrawals. This looks like the best yet boys!
Greetings from Kazakhstan 🇰🇿🤚thank you for such an interesting program and I would like to ask, have you thought about coming to Kazakhstan with us?☺️it would be very cool and I would like to shoot a video clip since I do music) I sing and write lyrics and would really like to invite you to my clip, of course not an expensive clip, but still I would be happy to shoot with you you are a legend 👍🔥☺️ come to us 🙏 thank you very much 🙏🙏🙏
The Grand Tour Presents: A Scandi Flick will be released on Amazon Prime Video on 16 September 2022.
yeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaa
100/10 excited 😆
Nooo RIP Evo 8 lol
Missed you guys
Bloody Awesome! These guys are 'IT' They deliver, the humour is awesome, There's a reason they keep going - It bloody works - and they work well together! Obv there's' argument's but they've known each other for so many years they can work it out! - They keep me going on my dark days! I can watch them always! Thank You!
I can't even express how feel good it is any time there's a new Grand Tour trailer coming out, it's the same kind of excitement as Christmas morning, I'm just watching the video with a big smile and just feel good, I can't wait 👍  It's just crazy to think that I grew up watching them, from 6 to 25 these three have always made me laugh
On a scale of 1 to 10? What number is 'I can wait' at.
This is like Jackass but for sophisticated people
Is that James's crash at 1:45 ?
I can’t wait
Didn't really enjoy the French Special. In fact, I can't remember anything about it. This looks like they're back on form.
Can't wait, looks Brilliant 👍 10/10 on the excitement meter.
Can’t wait 🚙💨
yessir finally close to my home!!
Ураааа
I just got through binge watching the first 4 seasons - bring it on!!! Such an incredible show. In addition to all the crazy stunts I REALLY enjoy the automotive documentaries they put together about great racing drivers/vehicle developments of the old days. The one with Jim Clark was riveting.
legends!
Arrgghhh I can't wait!!
I am excited to see the evo!
SOOO PUMPED!!!!
WINLAND MAINITTU,TORILLE!
I’ve spent the last year wandering aimlessly through life wondering what My life is missing.   This. This is what life is missing.   Please never stop!
Can’t wait
ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT LET'S GOOOO
Just ten days before release. Gonna reserve a Friday night, with red wine.
Is it all gonna be in one country ?
YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Still none better. I watch the same 10 specials over and over and over.

Hello from Georgia 🇬🇪✌️
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the cleverness of the title
Finally can you guys release more plz
Can’t wait for this!

yes yes yes

Now this one looks like it is going to be good.  MUCH better than the last one
I NEED A PODCAST OF THEM
10!
Clarkson, May and Hammond. Like a fine wine, getting better with age!.... Unless they're corked?
Wait.... We're at war with Norway?
Mitsubishi, Subaru and Audi?? Jeremy forgots the Ford Cozeh...

„Norway is at war with Holland“ he knows more than i a dutch person does
Well I don’t even need to watch it anymore 😂 it’s all in this bloody trailer
LETS GO!!!!
"i havent got any trousers on" i cant wait for thiss
B7 RS4 GOAT
Finally they're back!! I can't wait!
Let me know when it's up on pirate bay
Only on top gear youll see a drifting sauna trailer
Norway at war with the Netherlands?  not to my knowledge we are... so that's as the English say: poppycock!  Also, I'm Dutch and, part Norwegian!! Surely I would know if we were at war!
Hope its better than the french one😩
J'ai hâte
Please never stop doing this! i can't  wait for this one!
Better than that BBC garbage.
Can we just appreciate that person who chose the soundtrack for it😎💃🏻🕺🏼
100🤷 extremely excited
Give them LOTR budget.
When is the Holland one (ww2)
Can't wait! Also when will be Clarksons farm?? Last year it cane out in June i believe?
The lads are in rare form. You love to see it.
They were careful to choose the supposedly worst versions of Evo and Rex
Sooooooo excited. Damn I've had an CRISIS 😬
FINALLLLLYYY OMG
The gouge on the front of that Evo is brilliant
The gran tour + duran duran = im fuc..exited😱😱
Looks way more entertaining than the previous episode.
James May got injured doing the tunnel challenge.
SO bloody excited for this!
A fantastic simple car show have turned into a reality drama... but m liking it
FINALLY!!!!!!........THE GRAND TOUR.... the only reason i sub to Amazon Prime Video. hahahaha...
And their back. Yay.
Can't wait for this, it's going to be an epic good time.
WOW I Thought you guys are dead. Welcome back.
May these guys, never die!
That evo sliding towards the wall... :O
There isn’t a better birthday gift
Brothers our great uncles are back
I can't wait for these salty old brits to surpass in views Amazon's billion dollar cw version of Tolkien on their own platform
Looks good 😊
Finally they're back!! Can't wait to see this one.
There will never be anyone better on TV
Spoiler alert: James crashes the Impreza and goes to the hospital
About damn time 👌🏻
This is soo much better than the new version of top gear, new oresenters are a load of xxxx
This trio (along with Andy Wilman) build a new way to present cars and motor news, 20 years ago. And they still are, IMHO, at the top of their game. Always have been, (and still been) imitated, copied, criticized and analyzed. I had been follow them for the last 14 years. I never had enough of them, and I do not think I would see a better presenter formula, in the rest of my life (I'm 53). Bad Boys forever! 👍
I prefer the scandi bean flick.
YESSIR THEY ARE BACK!
1000
When I saw a b7 I died
Please don't tell me they sunk an Evo. Please don't tell me they sunk an Evo. Please don't tell me they sunk an Evo. But even if they did, I'm hyped af
I will be starting a revolt in Britain as Jeremy was NOT elected leader of the conservative party and therefor the prime minister. Does anyone have a guillotine I can borrow for a couple of months?
Why does it only show my views?
To be downloaded illegally ☑
I love these guys, but the last couple of specials were, to be quite frank, a bit shit. Hell, I didn't even finish the last one. I hope this is a serious return to form.
I kept thinking Cro Cop will walk in the shot once Wild boys started playing
I just can't get excited for one episode every 2 years
this looks fun
Wild Boys…… just about the perfect song for those three.   Loving it 🙌🏻
Fuck yessss
Drunken + Shrunken
Good, One episode per year🤦‍♂
hass GB brexit offffff
Buffeting
*"You've just stolen a bus shelter"*
I grow with theses guys, they are legend, we are lucky to have theses tree
cant wait
AND THEY ARE BACK!!!!!!!!
its 10*10*10*10 :D
Scandi flick without Volvos? Guys....
Looking forward to it! Great choice of song!👍
So hype. Miss the fellas, glad to se em back at it.
Time to get Prime again. Then immediately cancel it once I've watched this
YESSSSSSS LETS GOOO   MORE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!
Lets goooooo, i cant wait to see this, missed the bruvs soooo much
Funny I’ve been watching all their specials recently and bam I see this!
about fucking time lol
Finally i have waiting for this
my heart is happy :)
Missing Abbie
Hey, Jeremy can now reuse his old catchphrase "I am the God of Hellfire!" 😅🤣
This is awesome!
WHEN?!!!! FOR FERK SAKES
This is coming out on my birthday great present
18
Perfect timing gents, was just about to say they fell asleep while editing the thing.
Yeeeeessssss Sooo good to hear this Grand news!!!!!!!!! Thank the baby Jesus finally!!!!!!!!!!!
Literally can't wait for this !!!!
Looks much better than the last special they did in France,  then again it would as carnage a trois was the biggest load of garbage I have seen. Hopefully they have redeemed themselves with this one. Going by the trailer for this I will definitely be watching.
'businessman car my arse', that reminds of the Top Gear Patagonia Special when Clarkson had the Porsche 928, James and Richard thought that car was for a businessman
What a birthday present
Love seeing Hammond in a blue Subaru again. Is it another Impreza?
Wahey
Super excited!! Need to save up for it though as I don’t have that service. But this is awesome!! My favorite show coming out with another series on my birthday!!! So excited!!!
I met a girl back in 2014, and during one of our dates, i asked her what TV shows she likes to watch,  and she said "it's really dumb, but i like this show called Top Gear on BBC America". We are now married and have two little boys who constantly play with cars.
Can’t wait!
Cant wait. Love these guys
So don't buy Amazon until September and then cancel my subscription after this episode cause it might be years until we get a follow up episode
Wow looks like they Found there Mojo as looks good old days of fun and stupidity 😁🤣😁
10!! Absolutely buzzing
When new season
FINALLY!!!!!
10 can't wait to see it
Legends.
James will be at home in this, he has been having lessons with Mika Häkkinen.
I heard James got pretty hurt from that tunnel stunt, hope he is still doing good.
I’ve never been more excited for a special  I miss them so much
I can't believe Hammond destroys that Evo
The greatest trio ❤️
Yes
Yes! Here it is! How I missed you guys...
Keep em coming please, we miss these instant classics!!
I just had a coworker a couple of weeks ago tell me they were completely done with Grand Tours. I was properly sad to hear the news. But, Bravo Boys! Good to see the trio we all know and love back on the road! So glad that coworker was wrong.
I love thses three guys
OMG CANT WAIT!!! LEZZZGOOO JEREMY
Oh no, 1:49 is the accident that James May had, looks like he hit it at some force!
Oh no, 1:49 is the accident that James May had, looks like he hit it at some force!
So glad to see them back
I absolutely CAN'T WAIT for this to drop!!! More please!
Here because of Wild Boys... niiiiiiiice
I want to write Infinity on the scale comment but it keeps saying resource exhausted check quota.
YES!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Time to put these three out to pasture I'm afraid.
ooooh yes
I am so stoked to see it. I have already seen this trailer several times.
0:55 Didn't James go to hospital because he drove into a wall at like 70mph? Maybe that's the wall then
The 3 Wisemen are back!
Nothing hypes me up more than seeing a new gt trailer come out!!!
I guess Amazon needed something to off set the loses they’ll soon be getting with Rings of Power
They're the only reason I subscribed to Amazon prime...
I’m so excited!!!
YEEEESSSS!!!!! I'm gonna have a few beers, a good pizza and watch this the 16th of September.. Can't wait.. The boys are back.
100 can't wait
They somehow get funnier the older they get
This show looks stupid and the presenters are twits. I can't wait to see it.
I'm so Excited for this.
Ooh, I can't wait!
Can’t wait. Feels like years since the last Grand tour. You’ve been missed guys.
As much as I’m looking forward to this episode, I’m not sure that Duran Duran’s Wild Boys is a good match to three late middle age men acting the fool with some cars. Apart from that it’s a terrible song!
cool
11
YES!
Best 3 cars on the market 👌
OMG 😱, I can't wait 👌🏼🚗💨🚙💨🚐💨.
I can't wait
like
Can’t wait for this. Love these 3. Best on TV!
It’s simple really.   These 3 make a show and I’ll watch it. Doesn’t matter the subject material.
1:48, James May actually close to offing himself.
Endlich
Arctics greatest creatures in the wild have been released 😂
So that's how May got hurt
1:48 BRUUHHH
The joy that those guys bring...
Not what I had in mind ,  thinking more a foreign lady and her bean
Yes they are back!
🤣🤙🏽
Think this is the last show on earth to not go woke....... Hopefully.
It took a long time until this new episode have been announced of Amazon. I miss the old days when they produce their own weekly shows!
Jacked to the tits
I thought Europe's last great wilderness was Grimsby.
Glad I live somewhere else in the Netherlands, I just heard Holland is at war with Norway.
Awesome!
What a waste of a beautiful Evo tho🥲
I'm jelly they got their hands on that Evo
So chuffed to see the boys back together again. This will be a EPIC ride.
How is it, that these men are so old, so British, and so funny?
Heard James crashed with that yellow car 2 weeks ago?
This trailer will have a billion more views then that crap new top gear will ever have.
September the 16th. Great !
this is how every boys want to be when we grow up having fun with friends no matter what
YES FUCKING PLEASE! WE NEED THIS!! yes im shouting it
goodness i have never wanted to watch something so bad!!!
Oh this is splendid news.
The boys are back in town
This isn't top gear no more I'm afraid
They are getting older and older 😔
Cant wait
Awesome!
k belleza mi locoooooooooo
Fuck yeah
so this mean there would be another special for xmas?
Yes!
legit coming out a day after my birthday awesome birth day gift
This is well needed
I cannot wait and please tell me more of these adventures will continue, I know the boys are aging but you're the best trio and bring so much joy to households across the world
Now here is an Amazon show that won't get ratioed!
Real talk: this looks naff.  It looks like the OTT, overly-staged, laboured, heavily-scripted crap they did in the latter days of TG, and early episodes of the GT.  It just looks like a series of overly-engineered, OTT gags where one or all of them fake surprise or shock at wha's happening, when it's so apparently a very carefully choreographed stunt.  It's not convincing.  It's not funny.  And it's not entertaining.
Hammond: "Have we shrunk or is everyone bigger than us here?" ... Sorry to break it to you Hammond but everyone is bigger than you no matter where you are
YES!
YES YES YES BLOODY MARVELLOUS!!👍🏾
At some point James will say 40
I’m actually sad seeing them aged this much. It’s scary. Don’t leave us lads. Entertain us till you break
Can’t wait. I wanna see James talking to the Rozzers
Scandi flicking an RS4 in the snow?  This is my dream activity!  Looks amazing
Yes infact Norawy Is at War whit holland and the score is 0 - 0
Can't wait :)
Oh gees why 16th of September, why not now!?
May in a EVO... my life is complete.
Second chance at football
If May wasn't warning us about retirement before, I think a good concussion & a broken rib or two might do our favorite trio in, lads.  Enjoy it, while it lasts.
The perfect cut at 1:50 is insane. Whoever was driving(probably hammond lol) is gonna feel that crash
Noooooo the Evo
Eeeek!!
I hope they never quit
YES 🙌 IM SO READY FOR THIS THESE 3 are the best !
Don't ever give up. Live free, live long!!
wait "with age comes..." what?
Yes, yes, yes yes yes!! New special, I am so excited, looks awesome.
THEY’RE BACK
wait what !!! i just see this now !!
Thank you GT team! This looks seriously awesome! I can't wai
Fuck yea baby, rally needs more love
I am so happy that they will visit Finland. I am German, but I worked there recently for 2 Months, so I could experience the finish culture, thinking and habit's. And also the black humor, especially if you work in Tikkakoski and your neighboruing country is called "rUsSiaN fEdErAtioN
Nice
Great to see the lads again 👍🏻😅
i cant wait
Oh my word and it is coming out on my birthday! Yay!!!
Also Torille.
Audi RS4 B7 ooo yes
i love these guys
What's with the name? I'm sure there's something to it I just haven't gotten yet
Yes They are back I'm so exited
All the way to 11 baby!
SPEED and POWER
Excited to see the boys!!
Pardon my Finnish, but... fuck fucking yes!!!
Let's face it the last two have been a bit under par but this looks like they knock it out of the park!
i can't wait!!!!!
AT LAST
this trailer paired with duran duran is an absolute masterpiece
Nice! Hopefully they put more effort into it than the last show.
Can't wait. 😁
Im confused, I thought they stopped filming Grand Tour
So glad driving is back. And skilled at that, good news.
Can't wait
I'm an 11 right now! It feels like forever since we've had a proper “special" from the lads. MORE, please.🙏🏼
❤️
Come On 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I still think these 3 are the most entertaining trio since the three stooges. ive tried to like the recent Top Gear presenters... but... sorry guys...
The dream team ❄️❄️❄️
Looks like the best episode in a long time!  Excited for it!
It’s about time 💯
Could not be more excited!
They don't make enough of these Grand Tour episodes anymore, I wish we could get at least 10 episodes per year like we used to have.
Finally!
That’s the price of Evo’s and Impreza’s going up even further then. Probably not that Audi as it’s dull as dishwater though.
yey
Can't wait for mid september!
From what I've seen so far: poor Lancer :<<
oh hell yes!
I’m going to have to come to terms that two of these men are going to retire very soon :(
✌🔰
Would have preferred whatever you were filming in Poland, but I guess this can do.
Nothing or no one beats the Original TopGear cast.......
that better not be a real evo they are destroying
Bring it on!
epic
Reminds me of the legendary North Pole Top Gear special. ❤️
And special from Czech, SK and PL?
Дождался и не помер, КАЙФ
Don't want to wish my life away but come on the 16th sep
Bonjour to Gran tour XD
dirt rally 2.0 new charecters?
do they use rally language for pacenotes or "ummm m8 theres a tricky corner in like a few yards"
I love these guys
my dream car is a subaru impreza and i bet one of them has the STi
a rally special Christmas has really come early can't wait for the Colin McRae chat
yeah boyyy
This is so awesome!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😎
Oooooo yeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh 💥💥💥💥😎😎😎😎
WOOOOOOOOHUUUUUUU give it to me !!!!
I genuinely thought that since they are becoming older, it would be less funny, but this is hilarious!! cant wait!!
That rs4 sound 🙏🏽🥵🥵
Christmas has come early!!!! I cannot wait!
No we’re not at war?
Imagine all the memories they have with each other
These 3 need to pass the torch to 3 new hosts that embrace the team dynamic and the EV transition.  I volunteer.  I'm supremely funny, Clarkson-level smart with cars, and charismatic in the face of plight.
Welcome back we needed this
110
Ive over done it ! lmao
Amazon keep making more grand tour please!
Super exited. If it airs in 🇺🇸
x-mas come early , hell yeaaah
"I have overdone it!" 😂 sums up his entire career
If you were in their shoes what car would you pick?   for example id pick a Celica GT-Four ST205
cant wait. seriously. movie of the year?
Looks like great fun, but it really hurts to see an Evo get destroyed.
I like that shot of Hammond hold a 10mm spanner!
why does Hammond not have any trousers on? has he crashed again?
I got gta sort of vibes can’t wait for this
These are the only three men qualified to represent the human race.
Hands up who has never watched more than 1 episode of the "New" Top Gear, since these 3 legends left? ...
Amazing. Huge smile on
It's always a delight to see these three come out with a new episode.
At 29 sec we first hear the word weight and then we see him talk. First time in my life i have seen an on camera speech manipulation for the sake of the rythm for a trailer. Kudos new age!
Good onya m8
It will be on Amazon Prime Video on September 15th at 7:00pm.
The 3 musketeers back at it!
ABOUT.DAMN.TIME!
Cool.
Can’t wait for this!
So excited
It will be predictable and boring just like all other Grand Tour episodes !   Go on Dopebox and watch classic Top Gear.
I started watching top gear when I was in middle school, grade 5 I believe. I’m now 10 years out of high school and these presenters together still get me pumped for the next adventure. It’s almost a trip down memory lane but totally new at the same time and yet it doesn’t make me feel old. Great series and fantastic specials.
I'm so excited!!!!!
I HAVE MISSED THIS TRIO SOOOO MUCH! This looks like it’s going to be great!
This preview is better than anything coming out of BBC these days.  😂
Finally on my home turf
Finally, prime show make more episodes
This is the only reason I actually get prime again
Will Clarkson say 'imminent arrival of a moron' again?
10 , I really enjoyed their trip to east asia
Stewart Lee
Stop taking 3 years to make 1 video, scamazon
That evo clip ending in the wall just made my heart drop
Can’t wait 😜
Hell yeah. Imagine if amazon gives this 3 old dude the ring of power budget.
Can't wait to watch them destroy two of my dream cars
Love this!!!!!!!If you like car movies be on the lookout for FOUR AMIGOS releasing September 9 on Amazon. You can Pre-Order now!!!
thats a birthday present to me. Thank you!
I can’t wait I watched top gear with these 3 I am still am I thank you for making my child hood James Richard and Jeremy, I still rewatch all of the top gear episodes with you guys in.
Finally! 10 !!!!!
So that’s how James hurt himself
Oh I so can’t wait
Now this looks amazing 10000000
Im not sure why you find it necessary to give us a preview 3 weeks before this comes out. You know da-- well were all going to watch it.
nice cant wait to see it
This is looking like it's going to be the best special in years, even topping the French destruction one. Thank you for releasing it a few days after my birthday!
Hype
I cannot wait
Olen oikein innoissani! Can't wait to get together with my brothers' families to watch!
please, please, please dont destroy that Evo.
I have watched this trailer five times and I am still snorting laughing at it... oh dear this might have to be watch a few times until I can control my myself a bit like Carnage A Trois... sorry but the safety of the propeller car still makes me cry laughing.  My wife that think they are buffoons and are not funny but was in stitches laughing on that episode.
Finally, back to good ole fashion non-woke, politically wrong show!
Thought this was cancelled, thank god there is more
Yes. Bring it on.
This feels good
A return to epic !
Holy shit. Can’t wait for the 16th!
What could possibly go wrong?
Don't know why they even bother anymore. Just scripted crap now
11!! Lets do this!!
a show about three men who love and hate each other deeply. I love it.
At long last. Seriously these come so few and far between it's bordering on abuse!
Repent to Jesus Christ!  Are you a sinner?  Mark 2:17 King James Version 17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Finally!
The main reason I pay for Amazon Prime
About bloody time
OMG im so excited! I miss those three so much! This looks like its going to be a really good and funny one xD
'Norway is at war with Holland' Me as a norwegian: 'Were we?'
Yessss
I love to see the lads back at it!!!
Finally looks like a special similar in quality to the old ones.
I love these guys but the long layoff between episodes makes them look old. If there where more episodes it would be a gradual aging but now it's just shocking
I thought this show was dead.
YUUUUUUUUSSS
12 out of 10 fucking love this bloody good show
At last the boys back together can't wait
Boring (
Very much looking forward to this.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Finally a true special , no more of that history lesson bullshit they did on Caranje a Trois crap 👍
I want to watch this now just so I can know how and why we're supposed to be at war with norway? Because this is the first time i've heard about it...
Can’t wait for this it looks like a classic
8. Let's hope they still have the magic, banter and chemistry.
I saw a Scandi flick once, but didn't involve 3 older english gents and cars.  Can't wait to see it.  😉👍
The REAL Grand Tour. Sweet!
can't wait for it.
Was that the Evo 8 😍
YESSSSSS NEW EPISODE   WOEHOEEEEEEEE
Can someone tell Hammond to shave that beard! It never looked good and it doesn’t suit him.
I'll look forward to this, its Released on the day of my wedding Anniversary.. What could possibly go wrong!
When is this airing?
YES!!
The bois are back!
So are they banned from  Scandinavia now I guess. What a life they must have reminiscing about the places they are no longer allowed to visit.
So excited!
Why is it that all the good things of the past are being revived just to replace what made these shows great in the past with sensationalism and unneeded tomfoolery.  The future sucks
So happy The Grand Tour is back, but I can feel the pain in advance for the EVO VIII damages
Looks like the best one yet
This is gonna be fuckin awesome
What happened to the Russia special?
Please, for the love of motoring and for the crucible of motorsport, let this special be multiple hours long!!
Can't wait.
THEY JUST KEEP COMING BACK LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Just when I think I'd quit Amazon Prime after they upped their price, THEY PULLED ME BACK IN!!!
New content from these 3 always welcome
1:49 umm, alright
It was last night i was wondering why i still had Amazon Prime, thanks for another reason to keep it:)
Amazing
YOOOOOOO
FUCK. YES.
great
10
Holy balls, I’m going to get my fix again. At last it’s back, hello grumpy old friends.
When I hear Scandinavian flick, all I can think of is Richard rolling that small mid engined van on its side
“The lights aren’t coming on”, so it wasn’t just James then
Part of me knew that Richard would bring a Subaru.
ok Grand Tour you made my day!
I hope James is going to be okay, after 1:46.
How old are these guys at this point? I'm worried if their spines can still take driving like that
Cant wait!
Finally another episode! 10000000/10 excited
YouTube is broken, it took them FOUR DAYS to finally suggest me this.
POWWWWEERRRRRR
SO excited the boys are back!
Sisuuuuuuu
That trailer alone is better than anything done or will be done by paddy and freddy on top gear
Hearing James May say "you idiot" it's like shaking hands with an old friend! Finally!
This looks like a 100x better mashup of a 007 and fast and furious movie of them trying to save the world from something
100000 excitement levels.
These guys sparked the interest of machines in so many young viewers. The legacy will always live on.
Jumped the shark because waaaaay tooooooo long between episodes
ABOUT DAMN TIME!
I literally can't wait!
they are baaaackkkkk
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Haha don't spoil the special in the trailer please!
Looking good!
Super stoked!!
Finally!!
YESSSSSSSSSSS
Clarkson, May, and Hammond. The three uncles you know from Alabama who all yell: y’all ain’t gonna believe this, here hold my beer.
these guys produced the best television the planet has ever seen
Oh God! I've had an accident in my trousers.
10  (It wouldn't let me comment on the comment asking for my opinion on how excited I was)
Yeah 🏆👍
How is James ?
YES CANT WAIT !!
Lol at Jeremy's "BRO AFK" plate
poor evo
Super excited! I was driving around in the Lofoten area about a year ago and wished the boys would go to this enchanting bit of planet!
FINALLY, can't wait!!
Looks great but I always expect these specials around the festive season, and they are thus now one of the few reasons I look forward to that pesky time of year. Shall I save it for then, or will there be another one already by then?
It's always the unscripted moments that make me laugh out loud
Sadly this will be hardly scripted again like everything before in GT… Top gear was few level above this
If you are relasing tihs in the UK and not at the exact same time as Australia. Im out prime is useless! almost a year since the last one. Farking ell.
Nothing like sitting through multiple ads while you wait for the trailer to begin...
Is it ok to be fearful for their health and safety? 😅
Ооо нарешті)
10
one special a year, not worth my prime account
Should have used a Celica for one of the cars, at least they didn't ruin one I guess.
I Bradley Warburton born on the year 2000 absolutely love you three gentleman in a non homosexual way
and once again when the world needed them the most... the call has been answered!! Thank you!!!!!
oh ive been waiting for this
Can’t get enough of these guys!!
FINALLY A SUBARU
Carnage a trois was a return to form. Excited to see this
Hopefully we will see James doing the Scandinavian Flick (again)!
This looks wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than the previous crap of a episode already!
You lads absolutely mad. Love it!
Just when you convince yourself to cancel prime. ( ba___ds
sooo they total a Lancer Evo then?
BRING IT ON!!!
The boys are back to their best!
How they doing it? Everytime just having fun)) Thanks for cool content
😍😍😍
Can’t they just release a new one every Sunday like the old days
The Three Wise Men back at it again. Long may they venture
Can’t wait for Season 5. Looking forward to it trio are funny
I love them so much, my childhood and role models
This looks amazing
Goodness have I missed y’all so much!
Ждём!!! 🇺🇦 👍
Jeremy - "Scotland is at war with Holland"  Richard - "Oh, watch out!" 🤣🤣🤣
Nice
Just hope it's not too scripted
Gosh, even Hammond is old now. I love it 😅
omg
Yesssssssss
I feel offended that youtube didn't give me a notification for this masterpiece
Last time a Scandinavian flick was involved Hammond rolled his vehicle are we sure that this is a good idea
I wish this was on TV not prime TV I miss watching top gear UK
*Evos getting rarer and out of reach of meany common peoples dreams*  The grand tour:
i couldn’t give a rats about cars, im here for them and their comedy 😂😂😂
I can only hope when I'm old, my friends will still be there and we're having as much fun as these three.
Seeing that Evo submerged in water genuinely hurt 😭
10 10 10!!!!
Jeez these three look so old it makes me feel so old.
Oh I have waited for this one since you started those adventures already in Top Gear times long ago. This must be epic special!
Whats the name of the song?
I hope its better then the last
Ну где они?😏
on a scale of 1 - 10...  1 hundred million
LET'S GOOOO
I would watch these 3 paint a fence! They are absolutely the most entertaining people that have ever been .
Legends
Can’t wait! These guys are the best trio on TV!
I'm.... I'm just not prepared for the day I can't look forward to these three men cocking about.
When will the simpletons at Amazon understand that this is what people need, instead of spending 1 billion desecrating the Tolkien lore in the name of woke.
Rally cars! I hope they mention or feature the GR Yaris!
This looks fantastic 😍
absolutely fucking incredible choice of cars
"I haven't got any trousers on" - Richard Hammond
Looks like all the old stuff, nowt new, nowt new at all
Aw yeah! I can't wait for this. This trio is the best and nothing could ever replace them.
Good to see old friends back doing what they do best-giving us a laugh while everything is yuk.
Did anyone notice James May absolutely sending it and obviously going to crash terribly towards the end? can’t wait to see that on video
I just love seeing the evo
Quite possibly the greatest team of television presenters to have ever done it. I'm not sad that it will come to an end one day soon, I'm happy that they were able to create so much amazing and hilarious content. Looking forward to this to no end, and I hope they're old decrepit bodies can continue for more.
Holy cow, I thought the show ended. Excited: 7544533 out of ten!  Hope you all live and continue forever. Keep em coming.
Good to know they, and their audience, hasn't moved beyond idiotic teenage hijinks... I'll check back in another 5 years or so.
I hope they still make something when theyre 93 lol  Todaay  Richard uses a straw  James wees himself  Jeremy oversteers his wheelchair 😆
Yaeeeeeeees
😅
my excitement would be 20 if we'd get a full season of GT, with the tent and everything.
I'm excited for this, speaking about Prime, what did you think of Samaritan? I enjoyed it.
Can’t whaitt!!!!
please never stop this series !
fantastic
how my ,,,,,, Hell yeah bother
Please let Yujiro make an appearance in an episode
Duran Duran was a good pick for this trailer.
First tv show my son and I watched together, (he was 2 years old at the time), was Top Gear.. ever since then he has been a fan of fast cars, dry British NON PC humor, crashes and oddly explosions. Next year he will get his first car, I'm excited, he's excited, his mother lives in fear of him being "one of those clowns who can't drive a reliant robin.."  Thanks boys.. you've given so much to the world and we can never return the favour.
I'm looking forward to the episode where they all get fired by Amazon and replaced by Christ Evans, two shouty northeners and a strange little money type character
Hope Mr May is well, looks bloody awesome, again, still.
Can't wait till the  new  season starts
This is going to be epic!!!!!
11
This has potential to be the best special they’ve ever done
NOOOOOOOO, I have to work that night 😱😱
Next stop Poland..!
наконецто ! надеюсь не последний выпуск в этом году!!!
Evo vs Impreza is legendary ..... Audi LOL
poor bastards had to go to Sweden
I'm just happy I saw motor homes
Aah finally some nice Audi’s in the GT
Released on my birthday, couldn't wish for anything better than that 😁
name a more iconic trio i dare you
One day they will no longer be able to entertain the masses with their bollocks....  But that day is not today
The Greatest Show......in the world
TOP Gs of motors
These guys are THE reason to own a television set. I cannot wait for this.
September is to far away... Release it now. Also, start releasing seasons of other shows all at once... Like Netflix. It's better that way.
For the first time ill be rooting for james :D he brought best car on the world
These three almost make me get prime....  ...then i remember what amazon did with the rings of power.
This seems like it will be a great episode 😁👍
Can we go back to the old format please. 2 or 3 shows a year is pitiful
Looks absolutely horrific. These three are well past their sell by date and they ran out of ideas 20 years ago.
this will be absolutely AMAZING !!! CAN'T WAIT
Oh man this looks good! That's a brilliant advert too, really funny.
Cant wait to see the lads again 👍🏻
This is the best news I have heard all month.
This is top gear not that other show
1:11 "I've overdone it"
Oh yes. Must watch!! I've so missed these 3.
It hurt me in the soul watching the yellow Evo drown 😔
HOORAY! GREAT DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN!!
Hey this releases on my birthday, nice birthday present I guess
"With age comes... weight" <- me
Sept 16th! What a birthday present. I can't wait
Jesus saves
whoever put this guy's together should have been awarded a nobel price
I can’t wait😎 i love this show😄
the only reason why I use Amazon prime …
So, no new seasons and just crap 1 and a half hour specials.
I wanna see more clarksons farm 😊
Why does the cabin hitting the snow pile at 1:34 sound like the standard Rocket League goal explosion?
Hell yeah
So much better than paddy Freddie n chris
Finally 😊
Hurray! 👍🏻
You get  a like for the title alone
Love the Jeremy is driving the B7 RS4.
If this is what the season is going to be like... count me out. They're drifted so far from the original premise that the show is becoming a joke. How excited on a scale 1-10? NEGATIVE 10
100
Dear Legends, Never stop.  Never.  I mean it.  Power, cock and gin. The ultimate trio.
been watching old episodes of Top Gear, really missed you fellas..
"Coming in 2024."
YES, I do not want to wait till September though.
"the trio" is a tale I would tell my grand children.
Can't wait
Finally…
Time to subscribe too Amazon once again👌
YEAHHHHHHHH!!!!!! 😍 Even if you guys at the age with walking sticks, do it ❤️ we will celebrate ❤️
OMG, I'm so excited! Our boys!!
Cant get enough of this trio. Much love from INDIA.❤️🤭
100
yepper
About time they came back 🔥🔥🔥
Looks proper. Dare I say reminiscent of TG times…
Best trio aver
Praying it is just an old school A to B type thing with perils along the way, the last few specials have been quite poor (Mongolia was the last great one), and not really felt like specials but OTT normal episodes with too much scripting and too many challenges along the way. This looks promising however
Over 9000
So...how many "main presenter cars" were wrecked during filming? At least one sunk, at least one got cuddled into the tunnel wall, any more?
“I haven’t got any trousers on.”   Oh Richard…
Best trio
TENNN 10 10 :-D
1:48 I'm assuming that's the crash that broke May's rib
Oh man the good ol 4G63t and EJ25t rivalry.
I thought I’d got bored of three middle aged (or are they old yet) men cockney around - but no I shall be chuckling, guffawing, and just laughing out loud all the way through!
10, it's been awhile and this looks like a really good episode!
Fk yeah!
How do they get such slapping music for their trailers?
Very much excited because those rally cars are sick! :o,
Better call Saul has finished, nothing to look forward to until.... Yes, well timed
Great birthday present!
Can someone preserve these men
Grumpy old men 3 needs to happen soon, we have the cast ready in few years xD
I just saw a yellow Evo sinking into the ice and I now want to cry.
Quattro>that japanese junk 😴😴😴
I am so excited, I pay for amazon prime for one month everytime you release a new episode then cancel it ('caus I ain't rich ), all to just say you're worth it, it feels like ages since the lastr release, can't zwait !! love you guys!!
YESSSSSSSS!!
RIP Evo :(
You guys know how to make a man happy XD
Wish they did 1 show exactly like they did in 2001-2003
Ohhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
I seen almost to much.
Perfect timing
😭 I love you guys. 😆
keep doing these instead of that pesky LOTR interpretation amazon
They should do the mongal rally!
Looking as good as ever old timers.
Pumped!
A better love story than Rings of Power.
Yes finally Scandinavia, my favorite countries! Especially Norway!
Can’t wait to watch this
Well this looks amazing
Finally I am done with all those grand tour episodes and reached the present...💪 And also the top gear specials too
WOW this episode looks amazing, cant wait.
Long may it live, the last bastion of anti PC-culture. Hopefully...
Evooooooooo
I’m just here for the comments about Top Gear
can't wait 🙂
Epic
Watching them and the show is like getting together with old friends - very old friends but still ❤️👍
😁👌
Always missing old Top Gear, always waiting for that same moment from different channel. Count me in! P.S I am a Finn
Not seeing a Lancia Delta while the Martini livery is there made me feel mildly infuriated
GREAT NEWS! A NEW GRAND TOUR SPECIAL!
Three of my favorite cars & three idiots, this is going to be epic cant wait.
I’m hurt to see that EVO die. It’s gonna and I’m gonna cry. Welp.
cant wait
subaruuuu <3
3 old man, what could possibly go wrong... (best trio ever)
So happy to see the trio back.
The knights who day say "vroom"
thanks boys. can't wait. great to see you back :)
Wait are we at war with Norway?
Glad they back
Finally. You really do take too long to film.
This is gonna be amazing, cant wait
10 squared plus 10 squared 10
Yer Da and his bootcut denim wearing, UKIP voting pals are well looking forward to this.
We need the return of the classic "CLARKSON" - Shouted by Captain Slow
Great!!! 😃
is that rs4 supercharged
Hypelevel from 0 to 100 in 1 second :-)
Yes! Yes! Yes!
AFT
When is this released ?
When is this released ?
I can’t wait.
Rip to that clean evo
An unscripted episode like Croatia is the special we all need. Non-stop impulsive arguing is them at their very best.
The Grand Tour, Clackson, Hammond and May: thank god at least someone in Amazon making good work.  The Terminal List, you, maybe after half a year this episode airs, I have at least three shows to watch [If Carnival Row stays solid (sorry, James, your man in whatever doesn't do it for me)] on Prime.  Hey, Prime, stop fucking around with Lord of the Rings. It really is the First Fandom (Frodo Lives). It is probably the best World a human being has ever created. Every act of diversion is a mockery. What audacity makes you think you can improve the works of Tolkien? You can't even fix your own life and you think you can improve Tolkien?  Sorry to put that on Grand Tour's video. I am just pissed off of the company you keep.
NOooooo, not the EVO 🤣🤣🤣
I can't wait!!! Thank you Jeremy, Hammond and James May!!!
Can't wait
Hammond in the Subaru WRX again! Africa special nostalgia!
With each new GT episode it seems more and more like a new Jackass Movie 🩼💀🤣
I hope it’s better than the French special they did it was truly awful
Good thing I moved from Germany to Sweden and can enjoy a scandi flick myself 😀
Every time we get another special the more I worry we’re coming to the end
It is high time...
Finally what looks to be a proper rand tour episode......just like the old days..... Cant Wait
This is gonna be fire!🔥
They look like the three grumpy old men😄
Patagonia will never be beaten as the best special they made, but every release from these three muppets is exciting. I love everything  they do together.
Cannot wait for this. Just goes for strength to strength. May the good times roll :)
Excited got a stiffy thinking of the show
I just wish these 3 gentlemen could live eternaly
yes
I’m here for the power and genius
I miss these guys so much 😭
Yay
Love it
this one is gonna be a certified hoot and a holler, can't wait!
10, I have just put a reminder into Alexa. Cant wait for this. Watched them all, never watched Top Gear since these three left. When they left it went down hill Grand Tour is great.  Do miss the weekly shows tho.
There were suppose to be two specials Right?
"with age comes" "weight"  😆
So excited, 10/10👌😎🍿
Please don’t tell me they kill an evo
Talk about living a full life.. Good for them. Don't believe anyone who says they're not jealous of the lives this lot has lived
if they hurt that audi in one way i swear i will shut off the program . (i will not tho but i sure hope they dont hurt the audi)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sadly, this looks like a well-scripted comedy act lacking the sense of adventure and unpredictability of say Bolivia Specia of Africa Special...
Lmaohshit
At one point well get a wheelchair special
Yeeeees🎉❤❤
YESS the legendary crew is back!!!!
“Let’s give it the good old Scandinavian flick” *flips vehicle over*
These 3 can be 93 years old and still make me laugh and anticipate their next film..... man what's the world going to be without them making these pieces of art :(
On September 16 of this year, the second season of the Grand Tour will start. If possible, please upload the new episodes of the second season of the Grand Tour on YouTube.❤️🙏
men have never been so excited, giggling like kids fow what's coming
This is gonna be great!
IAFTFFS  it's about time
Great sound track.
WE’RE BACK!!
‘I am older and with age has come….. weight’🤣🤣💀
May they never stop <3
We really need this more frequently!
3 kids having a adventure. Best show
Can’t be any worse than the last one
The best series on Amazon. Wiping the floor with Top Gear still.
Grumpy Cold men. love it.
I hope they didnt show all jokes in the trailer
IS DAT LANCER EVO VIII OMG OMG OMGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
About time boys. Can't wait for the 16th now 👍
69. Too excited.
I can't wait!!!
The scale (1 to 10) question wouldn't accept my answer so I'll put it here.   Answer: negative 900.
yessssss here we go again! btw trailers look fabolous, music and editing is so on point 👌🧑‍🍳
It is not right to destroy a evo.... there are not to many of them. But i want to see the episode.
Oh god this is gonna be good xD
HAPPY! HAPPY HAPPY!
🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏Another Epic
TONIGHT! on.... not top gear! RICHARD has a beard! JAMES has a beard! and i light a car on fire!
As a Canadian, seeing snow
Can't wait. I can only watch Clarkson's Farm so many times before i need more "SPEEEEEEEED"
A scandi flick ? Then hear that they are in Finland?
Dawg every time I say "scandi flick" people make fun of me for not saying "Scandinavian" and now they're all gonna start saying scandi flick damn. Anyways, hell yeah, can't wait to see it, boys!
Yes, power and speed 👊👊👊
F I N A L L Y
10,000,000 I am so incredibly exited
I L❤️VE THIS 3 GUYS 🥰
Hmmm, delicious 😋
As a Canadian I feel that I will identify strongly with these struggles
The kings of cocking about are back.
Making us wait 3 weeks is cruel.
Yeeeees I need this!!
The boys are back!!
So glad James made out alive from that wall crash he had with that evo
Ill gladly trade the weekly show for these epic specials. Can't wait for this.
I miss the evo =(
lets fucking goo
100 000
Hang on a second, that Lancer was sliding very quickly towards a wall, like an accident quickly. Wasn't that Hammond's car? Did he... have another...?
An evo and an rs4 together wow can’t wait
Here we go!
I am fully aware that these lot are idiots; but it’s that recognition that makes me love them even more.
I honestly thought we would never see another one of these
Cant wait but one episide should be at least 2.5h at least come on this Boya are like gold
I want to watch it so badly but I don't know if my heart can take it watching my dream car, an Evo, get destroyed. I hope it doesn't but in the trailer it looks like it will. :(
this is the real topgear
Every time I see a preview for a new one of these specials it makes me feel like maybe everything will be all right and that we can keep going...
as a norwegian this is going to be knall
Wlc back
OMGOMGOMGOMGOGMAOGMOGMOGMOGMOGGMGOAGM LMAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Yesssssssssssssssss
I’m so excited I’m gunna piss myself. May’s Knowledge, Hammond’s quick wit and Clarkson’s ridiculousness 🥲
been waiting patiently for this, i'll be watching on release day thats for sure
It’s like a breath of fresh air when they release the trailers. Yet again, I can not wait!
is that sposed to be a pun
About bloody time!!! 😄😄😄
The winter episodes are the most boring. Go to unusual places that the media rarely talks about.
:)
20! (A ten from me and my hubby!) 🔥🔥
Whats more wrong is that neither cars are WRC constructors anymore lol
Yes, some of it is (badly) scripted and the jokes can be a bit worn out yet it's mandatory watching Clarkson, Hammond and May's latest fxxxupperies. Looking forward to Clarkson's Farm S2 as well.
Hell yes 🙌  so exited to see the fellas back at it
Holy shitty! Another season of Jeep Grand Cherokee Volkswagen Touareg
Cant wait, very excited 10 over 10 ofcourse👌🏻👍🏻 we missed you guys
Norway is in a war with The Netherlands (Holland)?   I know nothing and I’m dutch😂
The off road stuff is always gold!!
YES!!!!
Can someone invent time travel please!
Well it's about time!
Please more than one episode 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Can you please go through what 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 mean on the excited scale....we have 1 being 'quite' and 10 being 'so'. This will enable me to give a more accurate number for your poll - I would hate to make a mistake. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Looks amazing can't wait!
I shall without doubt re-sub to prime for 1 month, just to see the boys back in action. 👍
11! Date to be set in the diary!
Как же я жду новый выпуск! Любимые дедули)
😍 the boys are back
Thank you so much❤❤❤ 🔥🔥
11
Ok for this I will renew prime
BUUUT FINLAND IS NOT SCANDINAVIAN CIUNTRYYY
ÄNTLIGEN!
Plz never stop making these
Hell yeah, absolutely cannot wait for this! The trio still can’t be beat no matter what. They still have produced the best television in history and I don’t think they will ever be outdone. Good job guys for continuing on and bringing us the best of the best.
Yes I am very much looking forward to the new installment of The Grand Tour but how is the song in the background called?
On a scale of 1 (quite excited) to 10 (SO EXCITED), how excited are you for this special? 👀  9  We weren't able to add your reply. Please try again.
out of scale
I'm so happy to see this! Never ever stop making specials please 🙏🏼
Love you boys! 🖖
Jeremy Clarkson is dying man his on a heart attack guaranteed fat arteries clot. Anyone see him please tell him pack this nonsense shows and hit the diet gym
CAN'T WAIT!!
I can't wait for it❤
They should have chosen a GR Yaris as the 3rd car.
Yeeeeesssssssss
I notice there is no air date listed, again.
EPIC
Litrelly only ever subscribe to prime for grand tour and Jeremy’s farm.
This looks like it's going to be a good one.
I will probably be always excited, when these three release a new show.
This is why I m amazon prime
Of course it came out right after my subscription to Prime Video expired and I didn't renew it...
10
10
These 3 guys are the only people I can watch destroy beautiful cars like that Evo or Subie for a television show and I won't be angry with them for it... Slightly depressed, but not angry
Going to scandinavia - Doesnt use scandinavian cars -dissappointment
Pretty sure you guys could make a film, about anything, anywhere - and we'd all love it.
This just cannot be not funny af 😍 Awesome track for the trailer, btw!
等不及了
Can't wait
Oh god this is fucked. Somebody's gonna get hurt in this. Can't wait!
Ждём с нетерпением!!!
This is gonna be good ! Should be awesome!
on my birthday...cool :D
I almost forgot this show was still going
This is gong to prepare me for winter like nothhing else
Jeremy, James and Richard are the only good things about the modern world.
Grazie Amazon!
As excited as I am about this, you really put way too much into this trailer.
I am extremely hyped!
Made it half way through and turned it off. It's soooooo good I need to experience it properly!
10
Yeeeeeeeees, I need this
I am quite intrigued about Norway being at war with Holland
Welcome back TGT🥹❤️
I can not wait to laught to James May's laught 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Epic
The best trio on earth. No one will be more funny and enjoyable then these people. Been watching Richard Hammond since Richard Hammond blast lab was on and he drove Oliver 😊
Oh dear! They did a special from Syria. Invaded by the Russians. They did a special from Crimea. Invaded by the Russians. Now they’re doing a special from Finland.
This is gonna be absolutely mental
Duran Duran.
Finland isnt part of Scandinavia though, but cant wait for the episode
Yeeeeees, but rip evo8 rs4 and sti 🙈🤣
10
the last special was an absolute stinker so let's hope this is better
So excited for this!
FINALLY
they brought a evo 8 aaahhooooo 😁
"I've over done it"
This looks absolutely amazing, like the opposite of Carnage a trois.
I read that as "A Scandi Fuck"
RIP Evo VIII and STi, your sacrifice will not be in vain...
Well that's a different type of nordic drive to the arctic circle than Teslabjorn and pals do.
This looks epic
Looks awesome!
The Lan Evo ;(
Can’t wait!
Did that evo die is my question
3 middle aged blokes cocking about and being utter tools whilst ripping the piss out of each other. Can't wait for it❤️
Did i just see a B7 Audi RS4.....
Ohh I'm sooooo looking forward to this !
I can't wait to watch this. It's like your favorite 3 uncles are back with their antics. Old stuff, but always funny.
11
THE BOYS ARE BACK!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Yeesss so looking forward to this trio!
Ladies and gentlemen...THE BOYS ARE BACK!!!
10 all the way
God even those cars are old now😭
Grand tour is only reason for me to buy Amazon prime
"Hammond you idiot" ❤️❤️
The creative genius is still that giant orangutan CLARKSON.. and it  show with these 1 plus hour  long specials.. TOP GEAR died the day they all left .
A1. Brilliant
I hope it’s more then an hour long 😭
Right leg hospital, left leg cemetery
It's a 10!
Yes finally!
they are teenagers in an olds man body
I miss you The Grand Tour.  Please make more content :)
The boys are back
Oh thank god it's not a christmas special
I think i died a bit inside when i saw the evo in the water
I can't wait to be mildly underwhelmed
*A Scandi Flick it is.*
Yes!
That poor Lancer Evolution
FINALLY WHAT TOOK SO LONG??
1:46 WTF ?!!??
As a Swede and long time fan of Top Gear and The Grand Tour, i have hoped for years that they would make a Scandinavia special! Finally!
yes, Yes, YES!!!
"Have a Scandinavian flick, Finnish person!"
They just can't retire just yet surely
Can't wait.
This gonna be sooooo amazing and hilarious can't wait so exited missed the best 3 trio <3
wonder if they’ll ever go to Argentina
Better than the LOTR show
The poor Evo getting sunk….
Ok will say it, it’s all so scripted that they are not even funny anymore. (I love old TG by the way). The only thing they do is destroy cars, when it’s crappy cars Ok I don’t mind but its obvious that the Evo will be destroyed and the Audi burned, I guess the Impreza will get frozen or crushed…? (As other cars in the series) just retire already or get new writers please.
Splendid.
Can't wait for another grand tour spectacles! September please come soon 🙏
I don't really like cars that much, but when these three clowns get together it suddenly becomes entertaining.
This actually makes me grateful that my wife has Amazon Prime 😊
This is going to be _sooooooo_ good!
Can't wait chaps.
Jeremy:       May's just crashed in the tunnel  Richard:       Does that mean he's not coming on then?
WTF, WORST MUSIC EVER
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO
1:47 Oh shit so this is where James crashes
Reminds me of Top Gear’s Man With A Van Challenge when Richard gives his van the good ol Scandinavian Flick and flips it over 😭
My body is ready.
Oh nice :D
yessss, finally. I love these three.
I’ve been waiting so long for this! I’m already waiting for the next episode after this! I’ve watched all series over and over since the last episode!
S-o-o-o looking forward to this! Amazon take heed. Your shows with identity politics are doomed to failure, while your shows that focus purely on entertainment are guaranteed success. *please* for the love of god- *learn from your mistakes* 🍄
Another long commercial 😔
Exciting as alwas ❤️ but i feel bad for the Evo 💔
These 3 are hilarious 🤣
Look forward to this. Looks set to be an interesting episode.
Finally
YAY!!! 11
I CANT WAITTTTTY
The bus stop killed me haha
I can’t wait for this
This one looks promising.Either you have a really good producer or your creative team is goated because the last episode was horrible.
Jeremy knew about Audi and f1!  🤯
Hoping for a good one, lets face it, the last 2, Madagascar and French cars were below standard.
Yes, yes, yes AND YEESSSS!!! BOYS ARE BACK!!
I'm so excited to watch this. It has been far too long since we had a Grand Tour film
They are back at it again...There's no stopping them
Yay can't wait.
Good to see Compo, Foggy and Clegg back again, they always get in some hilarious high jinks
Let’s hope there’s a lot of speed and power in this.
Finally ♥
Oh man the theme song, such great vibes
LETS GO
I'm a googolplex excited for this episode! I've watched these blokes most of my life. They are one of the few things I look forward to in life. When they retire from this a significant part of my heart will die and I will most likely fall into a deep depression
How could one go wrong with drifting saunas....it is for relaxing on the go.
Can't wait
Thank God its on soon as we won't be able to afford to watch it after september!!💡💰
Серию раз в год снимать, и не очем, скатились совсем уже
Yes yes yes
10
I've been replaying previous episodes these last few weeks and thought, isn't it about time for a new episode? And o boy this trailer brings my day a bit better. Can't wait!
That evo 👌💪
Calendar marked.
Subie!!!
awesome can´t wait to see it
Oh boy they’re added again!
Ha! Right on my birthday. Good present.....I hope 🤣
These days, it's more like "Mild Boy's".....
I feel like they need to do this so feel young again . It’s part of there being , and I want a lot more please
*YES!!!*
They've still got it!
oh finally
10
Looking forward to it, it will be really fun to see James, Jeremy and Richard back doing what they do best.
Can't wait
Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinally!!!
The best trio of the world is back!!!😁😁😁🤘🔥🔥🤘
This trio is just amazing ✨
Oi !! you lot are waay too old to be running  acting like children!!!        I thank you..
The best TV Show on earth has returned. Finally, eventually we get decent Entertainment. I am German. A victim of 100 years of bad Television before we got Cable TV and now the Internet. 😉👍🏻
I was expecting more 😞  I'm a huge fan of the show but it strikes me that in the last few specials the budget has been hugely reduced and things are getting just a little tired.   I hope I'm wrong about this.
Looking forward to finally a new episode! 😁
Thank goodness Amazon is still good for something.  This will keep Prime members like me happy while Rings of Power becomes the biggest flop in history.
That thumbnail is one of the worst the could of got of Jearmy 😂 love it.
i lost my eggs with clakrsons family to sep 16 :D
Yes they are back
at last...
A bunch of washed up has-beens
The scandi flick  sounds like an automotive porno👍👍👍
I'm so getting prime again just for this
Why the hell do they start advertising this episode so fu***ing far ahead? It's a lifetime'n halv until 16 September.
These three the "OG's" I just can't get enough. I hope they never stop doing these!! I rewatch these all the damn time. Bravo guys Bravo 👏
I’m from Norway, and can’t wait to see the episodes🥳🎉 This looks amazing!!!!  Thank you all for making vids from here🇳🇴
13
GOATED
yes!
That's a nice Subaru.
These three idiots just make life fun. Best trio on Television
yessssss. thank you
I hope these three have whatever Keith Richards has so that  they can keep doing this for decades more.
Hope it is better than the last few pathetic efforts.
f*ck NATO
Les goo
this drug must never end 🤤🤤🤤
someone needs to them that Finland is not part of Scandinavia
Birthday gift for me!
Oh that poor Evo knowing what happened with James...
Can’t wait
10 as usual!
Awesome, cant wait! 😃
can't wait 10
Can't wait
i be bussin
👍♥️💯🔥💪🔔
Yeehaw the good old boys are back!! 😂
You realize how much everyone misses these three on regular basis. At this rate, I'm going to watch them if they make a show about potatoes
i just love those 3 always funny in a good mannerd way i also love the cars they will be driving all classic road legal rally cars i cant wait for the new episode to come out❤
the reason why I have prime
Frozen shenanigans!
They drifted a bus shelter from Kiruna, Sweden. The bus shelter is actually not similar to the ones in Kiruna and the bus schedule inside is just made up.  However, the name Uttervägen is actually a bus stop in Kiruna and the blue name strip is exactly like the ones we have here except bus stop Uttervägen doesn't have a shelter (James, please return it!) 😂
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssss! They’re back!
Man these guys NEVER get old!!
shame too expensive to watch,,,
Omggggg cannot waitttt 😍
HYPE !!!
This Is gonna be so good
Ah, I can't wait for this! Especially as someone who used to own a B7 RS4, class
100
Welcome back to Norway thanks alot for comin although its bloody exspensive here. You guys cheching out the old Norwegian Naval base Olavsvern is really cool.
YESSSS
I'm excited as hell!
So glad to see these guys back, I've been going through Grand Tour withdrawals 😄
Can’t wait! Released on my birthday even!
Can't wait !
10000000000
Oh its time to buy amazon prime again huh..
Thank god they’re back
I live in sweden. They are finally here!!!
They're getting old😭😭😭😭
This has made my year infinitely better.
FINALY!!!
LITERALLY Can’t wait!!!
Clarkson: I am older and with age has come.... Hammond: *WEIGHT!* Me: Snorting coffee all over the laptop - again.
Mika Clarkson, Kimi May and Vallteri Hammond
Im already hype just seeing theres an impreza and an evo in these special would love to see which of these 2 would win
yes finally
Duran Duran and Mirko CRO COP .... what a memory...
I can't wait.  Jeremy, Richard, and James are the reasons Top Gear was so successful and everything they do is superb.  They're like the Monty Python crew with cool cars.  Keep em coming guys!  The only thing I can consistently rely on from the entertainment media is GT.
Finally
Holy Trio is back again
Hell yeah!  I need this video. The Texas summer has been hot and I need some good car fun in the frozen north.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well son of a biscuit they got the band back together but whose was doing what to dig out and dug out that crusty musty Duran Duran album that would of been better left back in the 80’s along with that mirror covered in the devil’s dandruff and Captain Trips bits of blotter paper with funny little pictures of Mickey Mouse on them
I hope there are still many oreilly to come. These three are fantastic.  I live in Wisconsin and have JEZZA as my personal plate on my JAAAG KX8
Y E S !!  J A !!
whoever picked the song for this...   is a great person.   amazing trailer.
Wow that was amazing can't wait!!
Yesssss all is well with the world the boys are back !!!!!!!!!! Yippee 👏
CAN'T WAIT!!! VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS!!! Scale of 100 EXCITEMENT!!!!!! LET's GOOOOOOO!!!!
I think my favourite advert for these three was them sitting in a shed-office discussing what to call something for half a minute. We don't watch them just for the spectacle.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Finally - fresh meat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it will be nice birthday present for me then, thanks guys.
You are the best friends… love you guys… from Russia 🇷🇺
Almost half a million views within 24 hours for a trailer. It might be worth watching.
Will still be better than those newer episodes of top gear with whoever tf hosts it has now 😆
Wold ka bast vodio
Back with some fucking normality.
Finally!
The boys are back in town 🙏🍻
10 Hellou Finland :)
Excellent as always! You can't replace these guys. Forget the fake show they left behind! And Duran Duran are just fantastic!
Yessssss
Yes bad boys is here!!!
looks better than that last Scottish rubbish.
YESSS
Can’t wait to watch it!
Going to be carnage 😂😂😂😂😂😂 can't wait
That rs4 looks good in that livery 👌🏽
Torille!
i miss this trio
Missed this trio 🛐🛐
Oh yes! More silliness to watch 😁
oh boy, here they come. 1000/10!!
bril😀😀😀😀
So excited!! Henningsvær, Sweden - Abisko, lake Torneträsko.... Maybe maybe Sweden Kiruna with LKAB mines tunnels?? 10 10 10 10 :)))
knowing there is a new episode coming for those guys is a pure joy for me , what a sad world will be when they stop doing this...
i wonder how shocked Jeremy was. he was standing right next to what I believe is mays crash
Finaly!
Indians recently learned there is a show called Grand Tour and they are going to descnet here by the millions.
It'll be great to see the mad lads in another humourous adventure.
неплохо, жду
YAAAAAASSSSSSSSS!!!!! 🤘🏻🔥
you have the power release it now please
Evo 9 baby
SAUSAGE!
The inseparable TRIO strike again!  What took you so long?!  ... Wait, don't tell me.  James May was navigating.  🤣😂
🥰
Part of me is hating this because 3 beautiful cars are getting destroyed trying to be funny. Huge part of me knows i am going to like this because the lads are back
I have learned more geography with these three more than i've ever did with any school teacher. I am really happy to see the boys back in action.
There's an RS4, I'm in!
this is going to be a masterpiece again
Scandi flick, just like Richard when he rolled the van on top gear haha
Cant wait.  The ole' team are back!!!
This looks epic i cant wait
yessssssss
YES PLEASE....😁😁😁😁😁
Litterally cannot wait! This looks epic thank you GT! ❤️❤️❤️
Looks great, but I won't hold my breath. The last one was OK, but the three before that were really underwhelming. Will have to wait and see.
Ahh the classic grand tour
so they're caravaning again, on sleds
We are ready for Clarkson's Farm now
Can't wait... my score is 11! This is the best show on earth and the trio the most hilarious presenters ever!
Looks GREAT
Why am I suddenly getting horrible Duran Duran flashbacks?
Gives me something to be really excited for
James said buffeting!!! Damn its been a while
This should be great! Cant come soon enough!
A Scandi Flick  lol
Lancer 😍😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"YES~~~" *in Jeremy's voice*
They never get old.
I'm so ready!
Modern Top Gear simply can’t touch this. Can’t wait to watch the whole show!
COMEEEEEE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Well doesn’t this look perfect. I cannot wait!!!
Looks great, glad they still get to make them
I do get that theres incredible excitement by driving up in the rough terrain, but i was kinda hoping that Denmark would be part of this, as its part of scandinavia (although the climate and enviornment is far from Sweden and Norway)
My level of excitement is an 10
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Omg I can’t wait 🤩
My collies are most definitely wobbled with anticipation.
YUSSSS they are back
The lads are low-key the 8th, 9th and 10th wonders of the world or at very least, global treasures.
Been a long time coming!
Kind of looking forward to this...I just hope it doesn't pander to the lowest browed folk... I love their "less scripted" stuff...
When’s it out?
This looks cracking
It comes out on my birthday.😎🍰 I couldn’t think of a better present
The best part of the trailer was when Clarkson said "Scandi Flick it is" and then Grand Toured all over Scandinavia
Make the most of it, according to the climate change brigade Norway will soon be a deadly inferno
Can't wait!
I've missed ma drive-bois 💙
Noooo not the Evo!
Can't wait!!!
THEIR BACKKKKK!!!!!!!!!
When is CroCop coming out? :D
"And on today's episode: I set a car on fire, James is ready, and Richard has no trousers on."
Can't wait for Richard to talk about how he's from Birmingham
They were seen near Poland a while ago which means there’s another special coming at some point too. Hopefully Christmas time
Gonna be seeing this for sure
and..... they're back. can't wait to see it.
They should come to Africa for a special it will be one hell of an Adventure 💯💯🔥🔥
Definite 10... but only if Hammond put his trousers back on.
New special, Old Top Gear vibes, CANNOT WAIT!!!
AHAHHAHJAJHAIHGAYGHAJKABVGUFYUHJ';O;YILTUOCDFGHIOB cant wait
YESSSSS. FUCKING FINALLY.
i wanna see the crash
Getting more like "Last of the Summer Wine" series than ever!
September i shall resubscribe to amazon prime!
Ooh, a new special gotta watch seasons 1-4
1:49 This is how James May crashed his EVO
HE GOT THE WRONG QUATTRO
I really can't wait 😁
Loving the Duran Duran Wild Boys soundtrack! :) Made for it!
Looks absolutely fantastic! :D
Immortal Legends 🙂... can't wait to see this series 😅😎
Man I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS! Finally a scandinavian special!!
Please let this be better than the Scotland and France specials
Oh excellent….. in these days of rapid inflation and piss poor politics….. what I need is three good old friends cocking about! Thank you GT and welcome back!
WOOOOW!!!!!!😍😍😍😍
Yes! Finally! Speed, power!
This looks fantastic!!
Plese just release these episodes faster. It takes so long between each two episodes
That trailer was Asian Parsnip Navy Strength good!
who's ready for a viewing party?
This looks fckn epic 😍😍😍👌 Can't keep myself calm waiting for it 😘
Yeeeeeees
James is aging like fine wine 😍😅👌
Damn, three more weeks. 🥳🤯
Lfg!!!!
My favourite trio now with some of my favourite cars !!
That reminds me- the three amigos can be silly
Let's Goooooo
best ever 💯
Oh f*ck when i see the evo 8 getting flooded i feel bad it was my dream Evo.... BUT THAT WILL NOT STOP ME ON WATCHING THIS IM SO EXCITED!!
I’m pumped
Ésta parte de mi vida se llama felicidad 😍
Power !!!!!!!!!!!
This trio is better than mayo, ketchup and mustard.  Consider me excited
About time.
I dont wanna see an Evo VIII getting destroyed, it hurts
0:17 The I on the Martini Subaru is blacked out.
Jeremy: "Norway is in war with Holland"  Me a dutch person: "Wait what? Is it?"
I cannot fucking wait for this!!! You Pillock!!!
Aw man I hope that Audi rs4 doesn’t go up in flames
The best present for my birthday. Great music, looks epic. Can't wait. 10/10.
As the old saying goes: "The boys are back in town"
Finally
Watching these is getting harder since the cars they destroy keep getting more rare. Hard to see an Evo and a WRX get absolutely trashed and broken.
I hope James is feeling better.
Seeing them become old can make a grown man cry 😢
They are back They are back They are back Now for sometime the world would be a better place to live
OMG OMG OMG TAKE ME NOW!
100
James with facial hair does make him look better
Can we just all give a special grand return of these three once again for a excitement journey in rally returns... And we get a special remix for this "A scandi flick"?...
This is one of the best trailers I've ever seen.  I don't think I've been so hyped for a show in a long time
Looks like the Evo gets fucked Immediately, sad boys
Utterly psyched🏎
Never thought they would reference that one movie, looking forward to it
2:32 minute trailer and I'm in tears. These 3 together are just gold. Can't wait for this!
yeay yeay yeay!! they back
Yay!!!
1:48 Hammond moment
"There's a gravel trap to stop you" *_That didnt aged well_*
Grand Tour and The Boys are the only things worth having Prime for
letssss gooooooooooooo new GT special we back
Time to reactivate my Prime Video subscription
These three are like your best friends you never met
yesssssss
Thank god for the boys 💪💪💪
16th Sep is too late!  I'll die of anticipation.....OGG!!
Yeeesss!
Guess I gotta renew my prime whenever this comes out for a month and go on another TG/GT spree after finishing this series.
Just the cars they use alone gets me so excited!
pre-emptive thanks – scandi-ly clad, and a ponytail hangin' down
Oh yes, this is should be hilarious
LETS GOOO
Never seen the Amazon show, probably binge someday years from now
Brilliant, can't wait for 16/9.tge boys are back
This is going to be epic.
YAY another special! I’m so excited!!!
Feel sorry for the EVO, getting trashed like that.
Awesome
I hope no evos were harmed in the making
Wild Boys indeed.
About time
Clarkson saying, "I've over done it." The phrase that is also his story, welcome back mates.
I miss the regular episodes.
So that is the infamous yellow Evo~~
FINALLY!!!!
Seeing that RS4 has me tingling
Come on guys we have to start getting more than one show a year to make it worth the Amazon prime subscription
10
I'm so hyped right now that you can extract energy drink from me
Can't wait to see this episode. I know it will be epic!!!
YUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Um... is it me? Or does the Amazon Logo look like a large, erect penis?
YYYYEEEESSSSS
Rally cars here we go!
On my birthday!!!! What a treat! Sep 16
Yes, yes, yes, yes did I say yes
Almost got heart attack when the notifications from The Grand Tour
i was waiting for mirko cro cop to show up 🤣🤣🤣
I'M READY!!!
"...and my ingenious snow measuring tactic didn't go briliantly"
I also want to say that in 45 years of life no other tv show has ever brought me so much fun and joy. I dont even like cars.
So...freaking... excited!!!  These three (and the Stig) confirmed my love of cars, and automotive journalism
I have a feeling we are about to see another big Hammond crash
Oh hell yes. Love you guys, please never stop doing these, please!
I just noticed that Jeremy, among the three, is the only one without facial hair. He looks cool with one when he filmed himself trying to shoot birds.
so there is a new flick there.
NO WAY
Can't wait to watch this with my face
I cannot wait for this! I need my Grand Tour fix
Lmfao this has been too long
Can't wait for this, the trio is back with another special!
Ok now we’re talkin
Hammond is back in his Subaru Impreza (TG Nile Special callback)
Can’t wait for this. So excited!!!!
At least 42
1:47 if that's the James crash, which it looks to be one of many from the state of the Mitsubishi throughout the trailer, OOF.  Wow. That's a full Hammond on the wreckter scale
Hellllllll YEAH
I'm so happy that I was able to grow up with this trio and it makes me happy seeing them still together after all these years. My only wish is that I want to meet them. But hyped for the new special for sure!
Finally, a reason to subscribe Prime again
Excited as always, but I have a feeling this trio’s time together (at least on a car show) is coming to an end. With James getting injured recently, and with them all branching out to do different things, not to mention they’re getting older, I genuinely can’t see them doing these long winded adventures for much longer. They will always be international treasures 👏🏻
Can't wait!
i still remember when i heard the teaser with the pics very excited
Can't wait nice to have the boys back doing what there do best
lets hope this is far better than the previous load of utter shit that they did last time
Lovely looking forward to it
great soundtrack!
If only they could add one extra high profile presenter to the mix The Equally Great Chris Evans, then it would become the Greatest Ever Ultimate Grand Tour Episode, Probably with the highest ever ratings too. What is better than the Holy Trinity of Presenters, The Holy Quaternity....
poor evo0
Oh my god it’s coming out on my birthday!!!!
It will truly be a sad day when this trio retires. But what a send off they will receive
i was genuinely sad when i heard about the crash, and honestly relieved when May got out of hospital with injuries but alive ... this show truly adds to human culture, i wish the came to chile to see the dakar or just to chill at our amazing landscapes... the south cone would be fantastic set up. i wish them so much more to come ✨✨✨
lets go
So hyped for this!
Can't wait for the evo it's gonna be so fun can't wait
Looks like we've got to the bottom of James' crash, looks like he drifts that Evo straight into a wall.
The Grand Tour always giving us the goodies.
As it happens, being in Scandinavia, having no trousers on is entirely appropriate.
I am sure they are tied up with other things, but we need more from the trio. I hope for more specials!
Yes! It's about time!
It's good to see the 3 legends still doing their thing after all these years... Long may they continue
Well this looks glorious
When's the next one coming ?? ;)
This do feel like a proper Special,
This 1's gonna be a good 1, Ford vs Ferrari quote: More of that please. oh man i can't wait.
I always sign up to prime when the grand tour is on with a new episode, can’t wait
So whether in the African heat, or Scandinavian frost, Richard will sink his car
Can not wait for this
They may be getting older (as any of us do), but none are better than the bedrock of Top Gear. I'm looking forward to seeing a new episode of them again. I hope there will be many more episodes to follow 😃
Color me SOOOO ready for another adventure with the BOYs! 10!!!
History won't remember these trio to be one of the greatest entertainers but I am sure the audience will.
Can’t wait!!
This looks REALLY good guys. Looking almost top gear level. Can’t wait.
You know if I where to buy a rally car for this id have to get a ae86
YEEEEEES!
I'ed say I'm at an 11 for Beyond excited!
Epic trailer, action and music!
I am so god damn excited for this!!!
Can’t wait for this one 🤣
Cannot Wait! 😁👏👏
This one is gonna be gooooooooood
Need this and clarksons farm back asap
Never stoppppp!!!
Amazon, send them to the Balkan. Bulgaria. Old folks on crap roads will be great. One of their historic segments is communist cars and there's so much they can do here. Car culture also crazy.
This is a surprise. Love it.
you need to make more episodes
Nice
This looks amazing!
Can't wait for it! 😄
Best show ever.
Im so excited to see this
It should be called a Fennoscandian flick.
This is gonna be so good I cannot wait!!!😁
Three awesome cars. Gonna be shit to see at least one get destroyed
Clarksons Audi Scandinavia is Mays Volvo in Africa
Scandinavian Flick? Hope Hammond doesn't roll his car the last time that was mentioned.
As an evo owner i died inside slightly watching this trailer 😂 looks epic tho
I own a gray RS4 sedan, and a WRX just like these, make us proud!
Yessssss
Grand tour specials will be like top gear specials. This looks much better than the last two though, and while some of the specials from seasons 1-4 were good, like the seamen, Mongolia, and South American one, the top gear specials had something special and focused about them. It's like these days they try to make the specials not about a journey anymore and just about doing as much as they can so you end up with random races, challenges, doing random shit to the cars, etc..I miss the old days of just going 1000 miles in three shit cars and see if they can make it.
1029282738281929293838372920.
Norway!! it's been so long since they did stuff here :D
So much better trio that them on that BBC show which has been trashed for ever.
Time to renew my amazon subscription lol.
Oh dang... Sorry Netherlands, I didn't even know we were at war with you. Terribly sorry!
I can't wait to see May's crash in the  snow tunnel
Between this and the next series of clarksons farm we are in for a good autumn lads
Can't wait!
Can’t wait to se this!!!
Just watching this trailer made me smile with joy.
My favorite trio after the father, son, and Holy Spirit.  These blokes are also eternally rad
Can somebody say is this only 1 episode? Or its more like a season where there are a lot of them?
“tonight, James steals a bus shelter, Hammond makes fun of me, and I bring the wrong car”
So this is the Grand Tour now? One show a year?
The most entertaining show on the planet.
Excitement level over 9000 now.
You lot really chose the "best" time to visit us here in Lofoten, worst winter we've had in a long time and you came filming at the end of a rather nasty string of winter storms. Kudos to the crew and presenters and fun to see the GT crew and presenters showing of the frozen north at its wildest. Exited to see this.
Yeah the real Top Gear is back ;-)
Looking forward to this gents. God knows you kept us waiting long enough!  PS: We'd have no trouble beating Norway in a battle, vikings my ass
Ohh! so thats why Finland was so messed up, you guys went savages here :D
Like the music, reminds me of Mirko Crocop.
I fear for that yellow Evo D:
Very excited for this
Buffeting....
The Grand Tour: Viagra for the motorhead.
on my birthday lets gooo
Meh. Since about 2007.
They are still the best!👍
Finalllyyyy
Can’t wait for it!!!
CANNOT WAIT
They haven't done a great special since Mongolia.
I will die convinced that these 3 are the best things to grace my TV… EVER!  ❤️ these guys.
FINALLY! Been waiting so long for this after i saw them driving in Norway! Omg omg omg!!
I love rally so the thought of this is making me turgid
Now this, this looks wild!
Ah so was that the bit when James went into the wall?
Who will ever do it better than these guys… it’s just not possible… amazing
🤩🤩🤩🤩
I genuinely have NEVER watched a trailer and laughed so hard out loud, until I saw Clarkson saying “I’ve over done it” when he set fire to his car. 🤣😂
I wonder how much Canada Goose paid them??
Where are my finn bros at?
this looks awesome!!
It's been too long
Looks very promising
OH MY GOODNESS
This looks Scandinavias!
Yesssss I can’t wait to watch this I love these 3 morons it’s the best show about cars and being petrolheads
Usual mayhem, brilliant 💪💪😁😁👍👍
That poor Evo 🤣
Looks so funny and cool, as always. How could it be possible to beat these 3? Absolute legends.
I am overflowing with excitement
Yeaaaaassaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I am so hyped for this special. It looks awesome
YES!
YYYYYEEEEEESSSSSS
It's gonna be a sad sad day when these three retire from retirement
YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!
Even though they aged, their humor hasn’t. Long live the trio!
This looks like a solid step up from their somewhat lackluster recent outings.
YESH i dont care how long i have to wait between theese, but as long as they keep making them let them take whatever time it needs. EPIC
A Googolplexianth
YAS!!!
10 all the way
I know he's ok, but that evo crash looks violent, I flinched a bit
LESS GOOOOO
Oh I can't wait!!
Hello Finland!
I can't wait for this video. It's going to be epic.  🇨🇦❤️
10
Can't wait!!!! for it to be on TV, The Grand Tour is much better than the modern Top Gear
There might be some new classic moments spawned from this, and I'm eager to see it
An Evolution, a blobeye WRX and what seems to be an RS4… should be interesting.
A bit of foreshadowing for the coming "dark winter" we keep hearing about. I would guess it's the Sun's cycles. There are dormant states that proceed Ice Ages and we are in the early cooling stages. It's fun watching the jesters dance for the kings people. Bravo
I've been waiting for The Grand Tour and series 2 of Clarkson's Farm and at last we've finally got a date on one of them.
Finally !!
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
About time lol
YAYAAAAASSS
Can’t wait .. we need 2-3 of these a year guys come on
Can’t wait for this !!
Cannot wait bloody so funny 🤣.   What comes with age Weight 😆 🤣 😄 can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😎🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Can’t wait to see that rs4
Cool this looks Good
10
Is Amazon so skint they need an advert in front of one of their trailers?
I’m in.
Does Hammond make it out alive ?
Fabulous. Footage and the scenery  wow all your fans lads willk be watching
Bim is looking more and more like Gandalf every day
The best trio ever for sure.
Finally the boys are back.  I wonder how long the BBC will wait before they bring them back and get the "band" back together on TOP GEAR.  I mean.....come on...that show is barely watchable now without them.
Thank god! Finally something sane to watch and when I say sane I mean  bonkers and actually funny unlike the rest of he modern drivel (had to get the word drivel in there as I thought James would appreciate it)
This 2:32 trailer was better than the recent series of flop gear.
Background music in this trailer is terrible!!
I fully believe in Clarksons choice. Basically a big boy sti. Heated seats, Arctic circle. Makes perfect sense.
WOA FINALLY!!!!
I smile just by hearing about this😄
🤣🤣🥰🥰🥰🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Been binging every episode, this just seems too good to be true 👍 🏁🏎   "CLARKSONNNNNNN!"
I can't wait so excited
can you release it a day early so it comes out on my birthday.
Best trio
OMG I've been looking forward to this for so long!
Yesssssss
This is the threesome everyone wishes for
seeing them so old makes me nervous.
Looking forward to it
Looks far better then the lockdown one. It felt random whilst this one feels like it is just focusing on one thing.
YES!
Ah what a fantastic birthday present this will be!
Are we really at war with Holland? 🤔
LETS GO
To download episodie😎😎😎
Sad shit.
YEES
I'm in pain watching the evo get fucked up 🥺😥😢
Let say that Mitsubishi lancer gonna hit the tunel🫡
Enfin !!!!!
I hate snow I'm a beachboy 😁
"We are here to drive across Europe's last great wilderness" *James looking incredibly excited*
Thank god. Thought September was going to be a depressing month for me!
I believe that this is the first winter themed special since the Top Gear race to the North Pole special, which was 14 years ago.
The best trio! But it's so painful to see them getting older...
Omg I'm so excited 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
The Grand Trip once more!
I actually can’t wait to watch this!
this looks way better than that dumb french one they did
unfortunately, james may hits a wall in that tunnel race. I think he leaves the show to recover.
From a family who is part Norwegian. I couldn't be more excited.
This looks. AMAZING. Again
I was about to say that they should go to Scandinavia some time (they never have)
As a swede i Will enjoy this!
This is going to be epic. Can't wait.
This is going to be fun! Woooooooo
Finally! For god sakes as JAmes would say
What could possibly go wrong? 😁
This is where the fun begins
So excited, I’m from Sweden myself 😍🇸🇪
Simply the best. These three never get old.
Can't wait ! 😀😀
YEEEESSSSSSSSS
FINALLY!!
When ?
i am ready!! woohooo best show tbh
❤️❤️❤️
I miss old Top Gear so bad. They might as well ended the show when they left. I know they're getting older and doing a constant show isn't what they want but damn I miss it. Best show that has ever been made.
I can't wait for Japan. The car culture there is something else!
And May picked the best Car once again
that poor poor evo T-T
this is gonna be really good but that poor evo
Yes yes.
Oh boy, can’t wait!!
That's weird. When they are alone they all look old and tired, but put them back together and it is as if they get 10 years younger.
You got me with the yellow EVO. LEGEND. I hate you Mitsubishi for what you did to the Evolution
James had a crash...
we need more than 1 per year
Superb
i wonder if the tunnel is the one in Kiruna
fuck yes!
I LOVE these three so absolutely much, more than any men in the universe! James...you're ACE!  So are Hammond & Clarkson too ;)
Nice
The boys are back in town 🎶🎶
Am wondering, will Jeremy's genius bring Ice Age this episode? xD
These 3 are like fine wine the older it gets the better they become
Can't wait when is it out
The song adds to the fizz.
Yes!
With age comes what?
Oh man this looks so good!
Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brilliant was always jc and the two apostles 😜
@1.48 is that James's crash ?
Best chemistry of any car show and top 10 of any television.
Good. Just got Amazon Prime for these guys! 🥲👍
yes
These guys are literally the one and only reason I still pay my Amazon Prime! I love them!!!
lovely stuff
I don't know if it's just me but I don't care much about this anymore because of the wait we have had to do.
Seeing the EVO demolished like that breaks my heart 😭
looking excellent
And it airs a few days after my birthday. What a fantastic gift from our boys in britain
Love all three car choices but EVO for the win
WRX STI AND LAN EVO OH YES
The day they make their last show will be a very sad day in my family. I know there are much more important things in life but being able to have something That my boys and I can watch together over and over and still laugh and talk about is priceless !
THEY'RE FREAKING BACK BABY!
So much better than that shite they call Top Gear on the beeb. Am always laughing at these three, they are just brilliant at what they do best, totally messing it up and at the same time laughing at each other. Cracking. Can’t wait.
This just looks like one of the best ever!!!!! So so so excited but kinda confused cause the news says they’d been seen filming in Poland
👍👍👍👍👍
You get more views if you stopped at the end. Letting it play with just the music and a pic of the boys is gonna have people leaving before this is actually over.
Wooooohoooooo!!!
Oh yes
10!!! Finally the lads are back! Thank you Amazon. They are the reason our Family joined Amazon.
This looks epic! Like the old days.
One  episode a year is not gonna cut it ! That's very disappointing .
The only reason I have Amazon Prime is Grand Tour! You guys are the freaking best always will be! I would do anything to be on your show, ull just be a fat lazy Amerucan that eats cheeeeze that you can make fun of. PLEASE!
1:23 .... Is it even GT without Sir Richard Hammond destroying a car? 😂😂
I can't wait, ... Love it!
10!
No one beat this trio, legends.
it'll be released on my birthday :)
damm the scandi flick it in gets me all the time
I was honored to be in the audience in the christmas special back in the day when the tent was in use. Glad to see The GT back in Scandinavia. Can't wait!
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cant wait
Can't wait.
YESS!!! THE GENIUS RETURNS! Let’s hope it’s good!
Wanton destruction by three dinosaurs who smell of P burning a hold in the ozone layer. So glad they are not on the BBC anymore.
thank you grand tour for this birthday present!
Vamoooooooooooo
At work rn and this just made my whole day bettterrr. So hypedddd. Cant wait for the Audi 👀👀
Best news of 2022
Badass.
Much better than Top Gear
😩😭😂😂😂😂YEEESSSS
RS4 😍
The boys are back!!!!
This looks like it's gonna be brilliant. Can't wait!
No way they teased James' accident.
Finally, the bois are back!!!!!
Awesome. Also can't wait for Clarkson Farm 2: Electric boogaloo
Another special? Oh god we're being spoiled..
Yeeeesss !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Right, now its time to buy another month of prime! 👍
Oh man so excited looks like they are going back to their old ways with this one. Can't freaking wait guys 🙌🏼
Yes, finally! They're back!
Oh finally!
Thank you thank you thank you there’s is no other show I love better or miss more when it’s not on.
I have no expectation that this will be better than the Mongolia Special but I'm still looking forward to watching it.
That'll be where May had the crash then
Like an old pair of slippers...ahhhhh
THEYRE BACK BABYYYYY!!!!
Looks great.. we need more of this.. it's the only reason I got Prime.
This is the best trio in the history of Television. I have two boys who have watched every episode of course I have to do some careful editing because of adult content every now and then But when they announced they would not be doing any more of the tent and interviews and discussion anymore both of my boys cried. They have collected every hot wheel of every car that has been in the show. They just saw this video and they are so excited they just spent the last five minutes jumping around the room. I really don’t think Jeremy or Hammond or May realize how much of an impact they have on motorsports in general. I bought a Mustang so the boys and I can work together and we’ve already done some modifications and they just love It. Anything cars they appreciate the true artistic nature that goes into super cars and the technical artistry involved in making them go fast.
Here trio wreck another evo
“Have we shrunk or is everybody here just Bigger than us” said Hammond. James replies “well everybody’s bigger than you”
0:28 cracked me up very well🤣🤣🤣 The Men are again on the track, can't wait to watch it!!!
So happy and excited they back !
Oh yeah you guys did stuff
The boys are back in town!!
Right on.  I love this show.  Anything with the boys in it really....
Mein Leben ist auf einmal wieder geil geworden!
Can't wait to see the same scripted jokes that they ran into the ground years ago! If you're an adult and you're still entertained by these three, you probably spend hours a day on Facebook and wear jeans from Primark.
Thank you Amazon for this
HELL YEAAAAAHHH
It always has been a travel show. Top Gear lost the plot
Let go alreadyyyyyy
oh, did james hit the wall in that yellow car? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?
Nice to see the trio, finally going to Scandinavia. Well, mostly the northern part of it.  Can't wait to hear all their thoughts, of us Scandinavians.
The best equip 😍😍😍😍
While I'm sad that it feels like we only get one episode every two years or so these days, I'm happy another episode is finally just a few weeks away!!
Why destroy a perfectly good Evo?
I can not wate to see this one ,  But that hurt seeing the evo come to meet its maker like that
I’m a human tripod right now!!!!!!
Too much information on this trailer. Better to be frugal sometimes
Love to see this trio again. Thank u prime
Not been much of a fan of recent specials but this however looks great. Two legendary cars and an Audi 🤣
Imagine if he bought a D2 S8
OMG!!! 3 legendary man drive 3 legendary rally car brand.. God bless this trio.
I literally don’t wanna wait that long 😂
OHHHH MYYYYYY GODDDDD YESSSSSSS
Amazon u did us dirty ! Now I wanna pay 7$ just to watch this  !
Oh yes! Although don't let Hammond do the Scandinavian flick... Last time there was a van and a crash, and police stig. it was a whole thing.  But honestly, cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!
They need to do an equally epic trip around Birmingham, Doncaster and Bristol/ Newport / Rotherham. Same epic production values but ye...
Is it out now on prime?
HYPE
A full episode taking place in my homecountry and nordic siblings... FINALLY
Business as usual then fantastic
Endlich geht's weiter
The cure for 2022 is almost here !
I thought Grand tour had slipped off silently into the night not to be seen again. Glad to see the trio back. I'm revved up for the petrol heads return
I LOVE THIS SHOW
Ohoho I can't wait
Oooooooo this is gonna be a good one!!
was holding my breath for a Kimi cameo
Aaaand my sister has just randomly stopped the Prime subscription... Great timing.
Oh my, can’t wait
Yeeeeesssss 👍👍
😎😎😎😎😎👍
Wow. Looks like the best yet!
The legends return
1:47 that poor evo is going into the wall isn't it ?😭
My dream come true
Yeah. This looks good. I was pretty meh on the last couple,  especially the Scotland one. But this... 🤌
Yippee can’t wait !!!!!!
this is peak humour
Ок ждем с нетерпеним
Well that's not gone well.
HYPE!
James crashed
Been looking forward to this ever since i heard they were filming in my country!
Once again The Orangutan, The Hamster and Captain Slow are at the cutting edge of cocking about.
Man, it's been a minute or two since I heard some Duran Duran... whoever picked that song to go with this trailer, well done!
100000. 16 sep man that is close. i am excited. the trio is back
Ha didnt expected a new episode ... best news this week 🥰 !!! And thats the first special - i guess - where they all three have a car, that i really love 😂😍
Looks epic, can't wait!
Ya era hora!!!
Weeks away😃been waiting for a preview for this and my excitement level is off the charts. Only one in my family more excited for this than me is my son
YES !
These guys crack me up. Every adventure is just epic!!
Can't wait for this!
I CAN`T WAIT😍😍😍😍
🤣👍
BRO4 AFK? That's not a coincidence...
Unlike the so called LOTR, this IS going to be GOOOOD! This trio is the only saving grace of Prime Video. It is absolutely useless otherwise.
It will be epic 🤩👍
You know James hated this, he hates being cold, puffy clothing, outdoor pursuits...
AMAZING!
Excited!!
It better be a 3 hour episode or I'm protesting 😂
10!+!!!!0
So looking forward to this
I mean, it’s got to be an 11!
Litterally the only reason I have amazon prime 😁
Hello from Czech republic...
Definitely one of the better trailers so far... Looking forward to it.
This seems like a perfect birthday gift for me! 😌
Finally an Evo!
10
This is happiness
Thank god it isn’t with boats
i can't wait
May they make a special a year till 2100
100 n about time can't freaking wait hopefully the special after this isn't too far away
This has the potential to be one of my favourite GT specials
Can't wait for this I might go ballistic in excitement. On a scale of 1 to 10 you ask? I don't think I can quantify my excitement on any scale with finite numbers.
another banger
Yes
Seeing this is like finding 20 quid next to and abandoned super car with the keys in the door just after your boss has texted saying we owe you a days holiday take tomorrow off! 😁👍
Love this trio 😄❤️
cant wait to see james break his ribs
This is going to be the one of the best Specials. i can already hear jaza going " in tonight's episode james may slides with bus shelter, richard hammond forgets his trouser and i set the car on fire "
Need a episode In Japan with Japanese cars
Thank you
no celica??????
Can't wait. Hope they still are making more of these
10
Thank you chaps!
Feels so weird to see them somewhere so familiar to me especially your own country
Why make us wait even longer! Release it!! Love the show and wish we had some gap filling episodes between these big shows, even if it was just the trio causing havok around the UK
Always right on time 👌🏾
I'm sure they will be great!
Cant wait an nver can,i recieve everyone like it could be the last.....these three have become old friends are yearn to see but have never actually met.....
Another epic adventure then 😎
About time for something epic!
Awesome video, bad music
Thank Jesus our Lord and Savior, the greatest trio on Earth is back with cars, rallying and particularly an Audi Quattro. YES YES YES!
Oh cant wait!!🤪🍻
I am so flippin' exciting.
As they say in Norway: faen så flott.
10....ofcourse!!
*why didn't Jeremy bring the Celica ST205*
Thank god
ahh yessssss
100000000 I love you guys and I have been waiting forever to see another grand tour episode.
Absolute cinema at it's finest, there's none like it
I’m so happy
Finally! Something good happening this year
The Trio is back. Jezza, Captain Slow and Hamster. My favorite car show for past 17 years. Veryyyyyyyyyyyyyy excited for this new adventure. Can’t wait to see it 😎🥳
Possible guest appearance by Kimi Raikkonen or Mika Hakkinen?
Lest's Go!! the boys are back!
they aren’t too old for this?
Cant wait to see this!!!  The tent has to come to Visby tho, you have Ekstakusten, Gotland Ring, Fårö and the rest of Gotland within a 2 hour drive.
Marked my diary.
These trailers are why i'm subscribed. :P That Martini livery seems familiar... G1 Jazz?
Finally some real motoring stuff on amazon prime
“Situation update, bad news for top gear!”
Quick snap of before James' Evo slams into the wall. Is this where he put himself in hospital?
Well it can't be any worse that lochdown...can it?
Hope its better than the last one in scotland, ....
What song is playing in the background?
I was happy to watch the trailer I’m even happier it’s coming out next month. I figured it would be released during Christmas time like the others.
I approve
Well this put a lot more pep in my step today. Can't wait!
Can’t wait! Each episode inspires me to take on my own adventures.
Two of my favorite cars.
This is will be the greatest Canada Goose advert. <3
Yes thank you :D
Brilliant, can't wait 😀
“Grumpy cold men “ 😂😂
Warm fuzzy feeling watching this mate.
Can't wait!
yay
thanks for making my day a little better
2022 might not turn out so bad after all?
I'm excited!
Woot can't wait
A Subie! Yaaas! ❤❤
Why bother with trailers. Just say the next one is out.
Yes finally something scandinavian
THE BOYS ARE BACK
Rs4 is the perfect winter car. Awesome choice, waiting with impatience 😍
Can't Wait..!!
Seems like you're teasing mays wreck and even tho he's fine that's kinda wack
As always, I simply can’t wait to see this awesome series!! Counting down the days!
Need more! We got more!
Yes yes I have been waiting for the new episode for so long, so so so so much excited ❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Damn, Jeremy Clarkson gets drafted
Finally 😍😍😍😍😍
The boys are back baby!!!
James May look like he just stepped out of an old oil painting by one of the dutch masters
1000 this looks soo goood
I'm doing excitement
Having my favourite journalist choosing to drive my dream car! 😍  doesn't  get any better than this!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
YESSS THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
I'm 41 and literally get excited like a child waiting for these 3!
Wait, if this happening, who looking after the farm ?
This looks absolutely amazing and as a fan of Japanese cars I look forward to seeing it, I just feel bad for the  Lancer Evolution
Hold on I thought they were in Poland 🇵🇱 🤔  Edit: buffeting
YYYYEEEEESSSSSSS!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Wooooooooooooo
pls turkish subtitles
Can't wait for this! Looks like the best season yet
Hope they never stop!
Unbeatable trio still.
I've just had a trouser moment 😳
Thank you for keep carrying on folks. Really, just...thank you. <3
So happy to see there's more to come! :D
The original and the best!!
I am Hyped
Can't wait to see this
Fave cars and fave trio! Couldn't be more excited!!!
Should keep it for Christmas
LOVEEEE IT. Can't wait
I missed u guys. FANTASTIC
Even tho I have caught updates & sneak peaks from Fan's I'm EXTREMELY PLEASED to see these boys at it again! If I had my way I want these guys to continue this until they become the old men up on a balcony cracking jokes at others like on the Muppets. 🤭😏
looks so good. but PLEEEEAASE  I want the TENT BACK!
Well it looks like some real effort was put into this one. The Scottish one had a very much " mailed it in ", kind of feel to it.
Lets goooooo! 10 all the way
It was about time...
For the love of god Make it longer than 70 minutes
Awesome, if we can just get the new Clarksons farm over Christmas 🤞🏻🙏🏻
RIP to the yellow Evo.
This looks like a good'un
Typical, Prime waits till my Prime expires to release this
Yay!  More 'rubbish'...in the best possible way!
Love it! Brilliant, mayhem in Scandinavia with the funny old gits who used to present Top Gear now the even better show The Grand Tour! ❄️☃️🤣🤣🚗
Fuck yea!!
1:47 Is this May's crash that was in the news some time ago?
Nice, looking forward to another installment of the three old clowns in action... :P
but I WANT IT NOW
Yeees, salvation is near. Been waiting too long…
12
So excited for this! I literally am rewatching the old episodes before I saw this. Manifesting at its finest! Thank you
This is going to be a good one
There was a video of them recording somewhere, I wonder what that special is for, Hammond had an SSR
The legends are back!!
When will it air?
Nice car selection, love the RS4 B7.👌🏼
Hell it's about Time you come to the North for a special!
YES!!!!!!!!!!!! At last 😁
Let’s gooooo
Finally
10 can’t wait The boys are back
Next special will be even more special, as they're visiting MY country! 🤩Hey, @The Grand Tour, any chance of you releasing location and date of when you're filming in Slovenia??? 🥰
Consider coming in GREECE
Can’t wait especially for the subawoo
Just puts a huge smile on my face seeing these 3 in action
I can't wait for this!!!!
I waited too long for this fuck covid I want more of these 3
The BOIS are back in town....!!!
I can not, fucking wait, to watch this, multiple times, as usual.
Hope this will be available on prime video India as well
Well that means Poland is antother episode! Boys are making it few at one time! Great!
Ah, so it was a massive side-on slam into an ice wall that did for James. That'll leave a bruise or two.
What a great bday present that will be for me. Can’t wait man!
"I am now fully Swedish" is easily my favorite line from this trailer 😆
I love these guys, but if they put one mark on that Evo or Scooby, I'm not going to be happy! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maybe some day these 3 will be as good as the blokes from Car Trek!!
I wish they keep making these till eternity
1000
I do miss these guys.... so much laughter I can't wait.
suomi mainittu
Man the winter gear makes Clarkson look EVEN older!  James rocking that beard tho
Can't wait!
they might have gotten old but they are still great
This one looks extra special, cannot wait for Clarkson’s Farm as well!
Finally another top gear episode
Oh man oh man. I'm already dying laughing. I cant wait😂
This might’ve been the special where James accident happened, hope he’s recovering well!
eeyyy there in Norway
Hhhmmm cartrek with old guys. Nice!
It only took an entire year! Finally!
I never expected I'd hear that song again... this looks great!
god i never want them to stop doing these
came back when we needed them
i am so hyped to see the greatest trio in television history back in action i CANNOT WAIT to see this
oh yes. good cars too
Can’t wait!!!
So glad it looks like the boys are back at their best. The scotish special was bloody awful.
Because the last time Hammond was left in a cold wilderness...it didn't go too well for him...
NooOOoOOOoooOO!!! I wan't it now!!!!!
Ayy
Can’t wait
Saudades
Ooh dude my day just got from worse to awesome
Actually it will be good episod

Looks amazing can’t wait, but I think I will close my eyes when I see the eco getting hurt 😅😂
At least there is one reason to be alive in this world. These assholes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you, thank you!!!
Can't wait!!
Live forever and keep pumping these out
Just keep them coming!!!
Looking forward to every moment!
Dont know why are they even releasing a trailer. im ready to pay to watch a photo slideshow of them. excited!!
All I want is a simple second hand car challenge 😅
"You're a dick!" - Richard Hammond.
Excited!!!
this better be longer than an hour. waited ages for these 3 again 😃
Cant wait!!!
10 super excited cant wait its been sooo looong
Sweet! 😁
I’m so excited for this!
Finally... now keep the other episodes coming quick! At least 4-6 Episodes per year is what Millions of Amazon-Viewers are paying for ('cause TGT is the ONLY reason they've signed a contract with Amazon!).
10
Looks like James had a little slip
This will be better than Carnage a Trois. Can't wait
Jeremy to Hammond in Africa about driving the Bugeye Tubaru:  "It's more like you by having a surprised reaction, A TREEEEE! A HOUSE!"
That's gonna be the biggest birthday present from the Grand tour.  Long live the show.  You are always welcome here in Kenya....
Oh yeah! 🫶🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The best of the best
Thank you!!!!!
I’m so happy they’re still doing it. Please keep going forever.
Great, can't await it👍
1:51 REGAIN CONTROL OF THE COTTAGE - James May
i have maybe never been waiting for something so much. it's been so boring after watching TG and GT multiple times

More excited for Clarksons farm season 2 👍
Yassss! So glad we dont have to wait till christmas for this one! Amazon I will take 1 prime pls
oh，yeah,rally special
I love it! can't wait to see!
*Can't wait!* 😁👍
Its kinda sad seeing these 3 get older, but i wish they never retire and stop giving us this awesome entertainment. The best trio on tv ever
Great trailer. saves me from watching it
I hope it's 4 hours long.
THERE BACK YESS!!!
Hopefuly this will be better than the last one in france. That one was terrible...
16th? Sorted!!
These guys are the best!
Someone call the suicide hotline on the 16th and send them home for the day.
Man we need more of these.
Can't wait.. 🥳
It looks great. I can't wait!!
bloody hell a solid 10 for me! absolut legends
So excited! Always a good time when the trio release a new special!
you guys could make a trailer lasting 4 seconds, just saying "something new coming" and we would still be as hyped as its humanly possible! but yet again another exceptional trailer that makes you crave whats coming <3
Will they be making it into a piss poor playstation title like last time 🤔
YES YES YES YES YES 10X10
Best trio in TV history. cant wait for this!
0:46 "businessman's car, my arse"
LOVE IT
that song is the perfect fit
They should rename the show the grand trio
Yeeeeeessss!!!!!
That music reminded me of a Pierce Brosnan Bond film.
and the Brits are supposedly civilized
wot
Nice! This looks fun.
Heard the Duran Duran music start and already excited
Yall can't be beaten
This reminds me of the van challenge from Top Gear where I distinctly remember Richard saying that he was, "Going to give it the Scandinavian flick", right before he rolled his van
and the goosebumps are back!
To be fair, about twelve hundred years ago, Scandinavians did invade England, so...  This was long overdue.    😑😑
Why does this feel like a Dalton bond movie?
Any chance you can move to September 14? Its my birthday
Why, oh why, can't I register a Like👍 more than just once?!?!  I'M IN! 😊 Scandi ✔️ Subaru✔️ Snow✔️ Wild Boys- Duran Duran still touring✔️ The Lads✔️ Close calls✔️ Stupidity that makes me laugh✔️ Speed✔️ Like I said earlier, I'm in and thank you!!!! 😊
Soooo excited support from como lakr
So Excited!!!!!!!
Looking forward to this! Let's hope they choose better music.
Well, looks like they condensed the entire show down to 2 1/2 minutes so there is no need to watch. I guess the good news is that I'm old enough that with my memory, when this releases, I'll have forgotten most of it.
I don't think the subject material ever really matters with this trio... If they are up to causing chaos, I'll watch.
If Clarkson destroys James' Evo imma send in a very strongly written letter to Amazon
Less than month away I thought we'd be seeing this at Christmas time, what a bonus
ok so long before all the YouTube copy cats do this.
Literally can't wait, an utter 10
Anyone know how to watch it for free
Oh I love this three
This is a massive "Oh cock!"
Let's Goooooooo!!!!!
Can’t wait!!!
If they chose Duran Duran to feature in the trailer you know it’ll be a goodun
10
Clarkson and May are starting to look old.
My body is ready
Suomi ei ole scandinaviassa. Miksi he ovat Suomessa? - Finland is not in Scandinavia. Why are they in Finland?
"and with age comes..." "Weight."  *Uncontrollable laughter*
I miss the super car reviews....
Does The Grand Tour react to any comments?? 🫶🏼🫶🏼
the BBC made a horrible mistake....
Hopefully it’s not like the French 1. Like GT but I’d rather watch series of episodes rather than a big 1. Adventures are the best 1s bits obviously people are getting older and older….. 😂🤷‍♂️
Looks top notch! Can't wait!
This can't come any quicker than the cars they're driving. It got that bad i've been watching all the old Grand Tours🤣 Welcome back.
You realize you're getting old when you remember these 3 reviewing all 3 of those cars when they were new on Top Gear 🥲
Give us more of these three!!
I thought they were filming a special driving old cars around to different nazi and Soviet concentration camps in Lithuania or something?
1:27 that must be the most dangerous stunt I've ever seen. AND I LOVE IT!
Looks like some EVOs are about to get hurt 😅
Yay:)
Holy crap
LETS GOOOOO NEW GRAND TOUR!!! VERY EXCITED!!! TIME TO RENEW MY SUBSCRIPTION LITERALLY JUST TO WATCH THESE GUYS!!!!
Hang on May's not the one in the RS4??
26,372 !!!!!!!!!!!!😀
You can’t beat them the best trio in anything there unbeatable 😂
Aaah at last,,,, they're back,,,, the definition of car show 👍👍💯
Som svensk medborgare välkomnar jag detta med glädje.
А когда история на ночь?
I'm really excited but quite a shame that they didn't go to Denmark : (
Rally cars in Sweden??? I can't wait!!!
Super!
Goooood
01:22
haha, 16th of September, my first day home from my French vacation....and watching Brexshit Brits in the snow!
So thats how james nuked the evo
Duran Duran and Subaru in the same special. this is gonna be a good one
GTA 6 trailer be like:
Yesyesyes finally omg!!! I'm freaking out
RS 4, WRX and Evo and takes place in the Nordic area? This looks amazing, I can't wait to see it
I can now see why James had an accident in that tunnel!
1:29 hahahaha
Oh god! I CAN'T WAIT! This looks like it's going to be one of the BEST specials ever!
Here we go again, Duran Duran had me sold before any of it.. so keen lads
Can't wait!
Oh wow  at  last an actual birthday present I want
Goosebumps as soon as I seen this
Omg I was waiting for some news
These specials keep getting better
I don’t care what anyone says, nobody can convince me that this isn’t T*p G**r
FINALLY!!! SVERIGEEEEE!!!🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪
Ah yes - Sanity is back!
Yes yes yes))))))
Great trailer, can't wait!! Was worried that they were going to show James's crash and they almost did!! ✌️😬
Is this the special that couldn't be filmed in Russia due to covid restrictions?
I can't wait for Polish special,
Why does it feel like this'll either be a 2-parter or a full 2hrs?
Missing a lancia
My body is ready.
Idea, in case by some miracle you see this and care: the inrepid trio have to transport a 1-tonne block of something across (insert location) by any means necessary and reach the finish first.
Denmark is the forgotten child in this situation.
Why ruin the entire film with a bad trailer by spoiling literally everything?
Looks like utter madness....love it!!
So happy the amazing trio are back after so long! 😍
I’m readyyyyyyyyy
Three of my favourite cars in one episode! Joy!!!!!
these 3 never get old
❤❤
what a treat, this is going to be so much fun
1010
Shame May crashed that evo. Good thing he's ok.
This looks even crazier than the rampage in France 😂
I come for the Funny!  Not the cars.
MAN IM SO HYPED!!!!
Im so excited for this but at the same time I feel sad inside seeing how old they are now and will probably stop doing this soon.
Finally!
I love this show.  Can't wait
I am never buying that phone, stop putting unskippable 20 sec before important stuff.
Cannot wait!
Yes can’t wait
LET'S GOOOO
Well, going on basically very little, so far looks like a return to form 👍👍
No one will ever be able to accomplish what these three have  Timeless entertainment 🔥🔥🔥🔥
10
About time we have all been waiting ages for this guys..  So much so we even had to watch JC on the farm just to get by 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's nice to have some respite after the RoP fiasco...
11/10 much excite.
Oh yeah.. Something to look forward to next month.
Finally 😍
YES! BRING IT! Excellent title!
The goats of motor vehicles return can’t wait
God yes. Cant wait!!!
ONGGGGGGG 😍😍😍
Yes to this please,been too long!
can't wait! (to see the episode, not that old man thing...)
Yes!
Can’t wait!!😍
"Wildboys always shine!" 😆
Can’t wait
I flew all the way from Canada and went to Scotland, did the NC500 and Applecross, then down to Croatia and now in Switzerland, drove in all 3 countries in the last 2 weeks because of these 3. A PROPER GRAND TOUR AND IT WAS AMAZING !!!
I just love this show! I hope they make the episodes more often
First!
One show a year It must be a tough life
My friend: How many times have you watched it? Me: YES
This is going to be a good one
This make me so happy
Finally
Gentleman the time has come!!!
Some Swedish action movies are always welcome.
As a Scandinavian (Norwegian) myself, I’m very hyped that this is happening, heard about them filming here earlier this year, releasing far earlier than I expected too.
After seeing the tunnel, I don't think I'm ready to see May crash into the wall.
Yesss ... The boys💪💪
That's great news, the Legends are back! Looks great, can't wait.
The only show that is keeping Prime video alive. Apart from the trio's other specials  obviously.
Love these trio specials, can’t wait to watch this one!
The boys are back!!! It’s about time!  So excited for this special! 😁
I guess now I know when James crashed his EVO
Well the last special was not really all that special, the French one wasn't it? or the Scottish one? either way, I recall it being bland and unmemorable, and wishing they actually did something fun as opposed to following the script verbatim.
Just like the Good Old Days, Love It!
Norway is not at war with Holland .
This looks brilliant I will be counting down the days
ahhhhhhh!
About time 💯👍🏽
We need the trio just to go through the wilderness without too much fancy stuff going on. The episode in Mongolia is still one of my favourites
THAT'S THE 3 REASONS IM STILL BUYING PRIME LETS GO
Yes please?!👌
Release date?
looks like cheese
Hearing James say "Buffeting" is like shaking hands with an old friend after being apart for some time. Welcome back, friend. Good to see you again.
Nice one, literally spoiled the end of the Evo in the trailer.
I haven't any trousers on.  Can't begin to tell you how many times I've had to say that.
Oh man i hope they will never die 🤣😂😂😢
EXCITED !!!!!  10 !!!!!!
Well, sleeping in a museum exhibit without any trousers on certainly sounds a bit more comfortable than sleeping in a train station bush while wearing a dress.
Wow can't wait to watch the Grand Tour.  Please release episodes more often @The Grand Tour
Yes!!!
This looks brilliant
💀it's like they making movie each bloody episode 💀
i am immediately in love with that RS4's livery
Looks action packed as always and what better a location than Scandinavia for the Grand Tour's fantastic film crews. Consider me excited.
Excitement As a dutchy i can confirm we are in war with norway
A tunnel and James May. What could possibly go wrong…
I've over done it.
I love them very much, they're like the favorite uncle's of the family
CANT WAIT!!! Glad to see Captain Slow okay after that crash. Already looks nasty
If this is the highlight of the best bits then the actual episode will probs suck,  when the scripting is this obvious it doesn't work as well as you think it does,  go watch the french and scottish, mongolian specials and make notes they worked.
Hecking yes Sweden
I thinks it's too much work for the editing guys, I say record and then just dump the whole thing.
Ahhhhh so that's how may broke his rib
DURAN DURAN!
yes finally
Cannot Wait!!! 😅
YEESSSSSSS! I am so excited it's ridiculous. Way, way off the scale.
Wild boys are coming back!
Oh nice
I just hope the evo made it out alive
hell yeah
LEEETTTTSSSSSSS GOOOOOO
fizzing
Best trio in the world 😁
Yaaaaassss ❤
At last... Waited for so long..... 😁😁😁
I cant say a word. So excited!
This looks brilliant. Extra excited
Cant wait for it 😍
😃
The boys are back!
Can’t wait…
A 2003 Impreza, an EVO VIII and an AUDI RS4. I remember when Clarkson first reviewed those cars on Top Gear nearly 20 years ago!
This is awesome!
Best trio there is 🤟🤟
This one looks like it's gonna be good!
there we go signing Amazon Prime again
finally
Buffeting Buffeting... Love it.. cant wait.
Come back to argentina again!!! Hahaha
Oh yes, the rally champions
sure  takes f o r e v e r  for new ones..
can't wait :)
The music for Clarkson, Hammond and May is always brilliant. Especially if it's Duran Duran
We are ready.
I was hearing that they wanted to do a special in Russia for the longest time but uh....Yeah....I don't see that happening any time soon...
Jeremy’s gravity-generating genius continues to astound me
Awesome!!! Can’t wait.
Oh go on then i'll give it a look ;-)
Жду с нетерпением!
Yeeeeeeessss
This looks miles - continents better than the last one!
Very very much
*with Jeremy's voice* YESSSS...
Perfect timing I have just finished yet another rewatch of the show
LETS GOOO!! I am so excited!
YOOOOOOO LETS GO BOYS
Can't wait
I was going to cancel prime. I guess I'll keep it a while.
I cannot wait for the return of the 3 idiots   in a New grand tour special
I PREDICTED THE TITLE!!!!!!!!
Looking forward, well looking sideways, to this.
I cant wait!
I thought this was a failed Scandinavian flick compilation but this is much better!!!
Thank you Amazon, Thank you
Well I’m going to enjoy my birthday
James's crash was pretty fast but definitely wasn't 120mph as some news articles were claiming..
*AN scandi flick
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I CANT WAIT
As long as it’s better then the Madagascar and Scotland specials, those were horrificly scripted and badly written.   Looking forward but not hopeful, much prefer the classic formats 😔👍
OH YES
Omg omg omg omg
Can't wait! So excited for these old guys to show us how it's done!
It's gonna release on the 15th of September.
My life was boring till you showed up again. Thanks GT
YESSS !! i've been waiting for this 😭🙌🏻
Can’t wait for this to drop.
Can’t wait any longer
This is gonna be good
This one looks like the best one yet from the grand tour!
good, and Poland 2024?
Awesome news... BUT... Can they make more than 1 episode a year please!!
200 is enough
you are finally back
0:57    🥲
Oh baby!  Woohoo
Is this when May crashed? 1:49
You guys taking so long is affecting my health. Think of the children!!!!!
Did someone say a Subaru? Did someone also say my favourite car is now in the grand tour? I'm soooooo excited
Finally awesome!!
Finally!!!
Oh yeahh
10 for sure!
