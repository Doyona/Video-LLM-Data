The ball was doing
Haaland is incredible. That first touch for the first goal was unbelievable. Not many can do that at all let alone under pressure
what's up with the terrible video quality
With a defence like chelsea & a striker like Haaland, Chelsea are UNSTOPPABLE
He might still end up with a cup with dortmund anyway the german cup i back dortmund to win and give city a good game in the CL but their league form is very worrying could lose out on cl football next season
I'd be the same if I was the only one doing somthing on the pitch week in and week out with nothing but rubbish defending.
That defending 😂😂😂😂
Madrid will come knocking soon
Haaland shouldn’t be pissed of at anyone but himself he didn’t take his chances
Haaland wasn't that great tbh. He missed 3 very opportunities there. With delivery like what he gets any striker could become a super star
Bayern Munich bound for sure after Robert leaves
The defending in this league is so bad
Hummells is finished
Bayern are boring....
Imagine being that good at anything at 20 let alone getting paid thousands a week for it.
Hummels reminds of Maguire terrible
Hardly storms off.... BT Sport over-exaggerating
hoorland
Whoreland
Unhappy with his own performance more than anything but I can't see him staying at Dortmund at the end of the season. He deserves to be at a Champions League winning team
Am I the only one who was getting annoyed at them calling him ‘Horland’?
Why does every British commentator for European football all sound the same? Just shouty.
Yo commentator. STOP. SAYING. HAULAND
Cologne I think they mean koln 😂
The periodic hose unexpectedly mark because beet experimentally bathe below a probable way. important, absorbing icon
Norwegian Torres
I love how he gives his shirt
Haaland won't be playing for Dortmund next season.
Haaland doesn't need a drugs test, he needs a DNA test; I'm not convinced he's human!
haaaland is a monster but the next step is to beat lewandowski for top goal scorer
That penalty shouldn't be given. His arm is by his side.
HORLAND
Imagine Haaland playing in a squad like Real Madrid god almighty
That first touch for first goal was sensational
Haaland: Walks down the tunnel BT Sport: Haaland turns into a nuclear missile and storms down the tunnel destroying 7 medium sized countries!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hardly stormed down the tunnel
Looks like Mike from monster ink
Haaland got pig 🐽 nose
Ordinary people say ''Haaland''.  This commentator says ''Whoreland''.
I always like a selfish striker who just wants to score goals. The way erling is going he will smash most goal scoring records.
most valueable player right now
Could’ve scored 5 or 6 easily today so can only be annoyed at himself
He’s on his way to Chelsea
Yeah if he wants to win... He needs to come to Chelsea. It's so obvious that he is literally the missing piece in the Chelsea team.   In man city he'll just be another player
Basically, he’s tired of mediocre Dortmund and is begging to join the Arsenal 🔴😊
He is the best striker in world football at the moment at 20. This summer will be interesting to see which club will try get him.
Haaland is like young Ronaldo, always hungry to win. Amazing player
Haaland still gave his shirt what a legend
Maybe he needed a poo?
*Haaland gets the ball* Commentator:HORRLAND
Its scary how clinical haaland is even tho he is only 20 years old!  Lol just imagine him in a team like city, he'd be easily scoring 40 + a season
KOLN's number 22 had an awful game, at fault for both goals
Haaland plays like he has sliders on
Come to LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL
Why does the commentator call him Elling Whorelands
Haaland needs to bring one of his cousins to play in defence and then Dortmund would be sorted 😂
HORLAND!
Didn't know the polish president played for köln 😂
Reminds me of Van Nistelrooy
Can someone tell him it’s not Whoreland it’s Haaland
BT Sport commentator needs to learn how to pronounce Haalands name correctly.
He needs to leave
How come first Arsenal's goal counts as own one????
I mean.. Haaland.
Whorelands? Its clearly spelt Haa'land
3:29 What an absolute screamer from Köln why is no one talking about this
This team is shot at defending
Haaland is better than mbappe
Hoarland ? Lool
Media: ERIC HAALAND STORMS DOWN THE TUNNEL ⚡⛈️⛈️⚡  Reality: Walks down the tunnel
Talk Haaland going to English Premiership .The ideal team for Haaland would be Liverpool if they could sell Salah Liverpool way would suit Haaland My opinion over Man City,Chelsea,Man Utd from what I've seen Jurgen landed Haaland it would be like Torres at  Liverpool .Sort money mentioned could be isssue.Harland defenders nightmare. Going to Borussia was very wise footballing move development has increased .Jurgens man management would further enhance Haaland & take him to Ian Rush ,Kenny Dalglish ,Michael Owen ,Robbie Fowler club of true World Class strikers .
Haaland not human
just imagine him for the likes of Man City or Bayern, what a player
Horeland
Haaland is amazing but the Bundesliga is such a one team league..... premier league has only had same team win it in a row once in about 12 years. Bundesliga it's just Bayern.
Haaland-Simply the best
‘Whoreland’. Nice
haaland is very cocky in my opinion. He is a great player but he is just an arrogant greedy boy. Fame and fortune has made him greedy.
Haaland is the best player in the world atm idgaf what anyone says
Haaland is just a beast
Anyone else find it really irritating how he says horeland
Honestly can’t wait to see him being fed by De Bruyne and Mahrez next season.
Yeah city are gonna win against Dortmund they get carried by a 20 year old
feel bad for haaland he was the only one putting effort in
WELCOME TO CHELSEA HAALAND!
Celebration @ 2:44 looked straight out of fifa😂
I don't know who Horrlands is? does the commentator mean Haaland?
Missed the bit where he storms down the tunnel? Even checked back through couldn't find it?
I’ve genuinely never witnessed a team rely on a player more than Dortmund rely on Haaland right now
haaland>mbappe
Why is the commentator calling him "whoreland" ....
As a United fan I'm just raging that our stupid board is not sacked for messing up the Haarland transfer.!!! What plonkers.!!
Was Sancho playing
aw man, man city is going to run over them if they defend like this
Dortmund are so bad 🤣 majority of the game the players make the dumbest decisions. Will get hammered by city
Why is the commentator calling him horland🤦‍♂️
*the yellow wall*
Koln in German = Cologne in English. How is the commentator pronouncing or is he deliberately trying to annoy both Germans and English speaking fans at the same time.
This is why I said dortmund are the weakest team in the ucl last 8 and no one believed me, 2 man team.
i like how the commentator prounounces his name soo nice i mean so stupid
Erling Haaland could easily score 6 goals today
If Dortmund doesn't get at least top 4, then all of their upcoming players are off.
Jesus is the way the truth and the life no one gets to heaven except through Him repent before it’s too late. It’s your choice .. heaven or hell . Change your ways and turn to Him !!!
Storms*
Welcome to Liverpool YNWA
Imagine where Dortmund would be without Haaland
Koln vs haaland should be the title.
just got the hump with himself for missing 4 chances what a player he is a monster.
Hopefully United sign Harland in the summer
Haalang should go to man city
Haland can't stop won't stop
I was disappointed that i couldnt access this on bt sport, anyone the same?
Welcome to Anfield Haaland. YNWA. Good luck Origi at Dortmund.
He reminds me of a young ronaldo
The charming minute intialy apologise because dinner impressively roll throughout a thin ton. green grey grieving, meek rocket
Halaand would benefit a lot from long passes from Bruno and Pogba
He knows he leaving at the end of the season.  Thinks he is better than the club and that should never happen
He chose Dortmund to be first team starter but can’t expect to reach heights of a champion staying there.  Dortmund will always be a feeder club to other teams while making a lot of money
If haaland wasn't at Dortmund they would be in the relegation zone
I see a lot people saying he’s annoyed at carrying his team and wants to leave, but it came across to me that he was angry at himself at the chances he missed. Everyone knows his mentality, he probably heard at half-time that Lewandowski had a hat-trick by then. With his quality he could of easily had 4 goals as well.
Haaland and Inshallah
Haaland HAS to leave Dortmund in the Summer. Its the best move for the sake of his career.
Haaland is incredible aswell as assisted by Sancho. But I don’t think two young men can carry this team to beat Man City over 2 legs in the champions league. Man City along with Bayern are just too good for anyone atm. PSG are close but not at the all round level as those 2 teams
Lol the commentator Horeeeelad 😂, then the secondary commentator saying it correctly.
He might as well just go bayern and win champs league for the next few years at least while barca and real are down.
If Pep doesn't overthink the QTF they are going to breeze past BVB
3:21 omg
Haland is a machine ...
My only issue with Haaland is that, yes he scores a lot of goals, but hes doing it in a league which isnt really strong.  Can he do the same in the Premier League?? Who knows, hopefully one day we will see.  Its not hard to look like a world class player in that team, considering the opposition defence dont even make a tackle. My worry is if he comes to the UK, our teams wont be so easy on him.
He missed about 20 chances
Haaland the best in the world right now
I think where looking at Lewandowski's future replacement
Did the guy just say spelling ham instead of Bellingham
Him say hOlland really annoys me
He’s only stressed cos he knows he should have had 4..
Yeah Håland is leaving this summer
He looks pissed off at himself for missing chances. Which makes him a monster since he manage to put away 2.
He's going to be the next zlatan
Haaland is a great player, but he seems like a bit of a knobhead 🤷‍♂️
I hope haaland comes to premier league
Hit Bellingham’s arm, but he held it in. How’s that a penalty, never mind a yellow?!
Even that tap in goal is amazing. The ball was fast and he was at least 3 yards away from the contact point initially. That's pure 9 instinct right there
He doesn’t exactly storm down the tunnel does he?
He was angry the commentator said his name wrong
No champions league for Haaland unless he moves away from Dortmund next year
What. A fool he deserves a second mention
It’s scary to see how deadly and composed Haaland is already in front of goal for his age.
A young player with that mentality will let him down in the long run
Hope Haaland doesn't go to Munich. Just think playing in the German league. Not going to be the best show of his talent
What a big baby
Get rid of martial and get Halaand. The mentality and attitude and hunger for goals kind of person is what we need. Not martials stinky lazy attitude
Missis to many shots and English prem defenders will deal with him he will not get the room he gets now in this leauge if he comes to the prem he will be a forlan flop
If city sign him its over
Who the hell is Hooorland?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Something else that Haaland
No wonder Haaland stormed off he could have had about 6 goals himself
All of Dortmund's highlights were of haaland
Haaland is ridiculous take him over mbappe every day of the week
United fan but oh my word, this guy is out of this world he could have scored 3/4 he never seems to stop scoring. We need a player like him get the bloody chequebook out Ed.
What happened to Burki?
This guy is so talented strong and a clinical finisher like its gonna be him vs mbappe but I hope he can continue for a long time like Cr7 and Messi
What a play haaland is, proper striker
Where was the storming down the tunnel? The guy literally just walked off
Karen Haaland.
the pen was unfair
I think haaland isn’t pissed at the team. But pissed at himself as he could have scored 4 goals looking at his ability but for unlucky
BVB would genuinely be a bang average top 10 side without Haaland💀
Bro this commentator is terrible
Who is this commentator?
Haaland just carries dortmund swear
My favorite thing about Haaland is that he doesn't over think things, specially in front of goal. He just trains really hard and relies on muscle memory to just smash the ball in the back of the net....keeps it nice and simple. That's effectively why he's so lethal. Obviously the genetics help too.
Embarrassing headline BT Sport.  Sort yourselves out.
His attitude towards football is exactly what the football world needed right now
All the (delusional) Man U fans acting as if this is a sign that he's going to Manchester lol
Hahha trust the other commentator to pronounce haaland as holland !! Great job mate 😂🙏
I support PSG, I like Kylian,  but Erling Haaland is something else man. Maybe the best young player right now
haaland is scoring way more than mbappe
It’s rare these days to have a one man team, but that is Dortmund in a nutshell. Haaland makes the rest look average, and demands that the game be played with him as the focal point. What a player!
Missed goals opportunities
Dortmund are full of potential and top class players, but year after year they've been a massive let down.
They scored two without the penalty
He was late to catch his flight to Stamford Bridge to sign paperwork.
Haaland to retire next season 😂
If Haaland played with some more advanced players around him, we’d understand just how good he is, probably would already become the best in the world.
“Here’s wHoRElAnD”
The way this guy says haalands name pisses me off
Deadest commentary ever 🤦🏾‍♂️ literally said nothing about that pass from emre can.  That pass > the goal
Anyone know why he was pissed
He's on the end of everything 😳
The last 2 players that hit the scene like Haaland was Messi and Ronaldo. In my opinion
His next destination is England. He is ready made for the Premier League. Strong, fast, technically gifted and ruthless in front of goal. He will terrorise defences. It’s just which team will he sign for, he’s capable of playing in any team in the world. What a player
If bayern get haaland I'm not gonna be happy
Haaland should be left Dotmund soon or later, if he want Balad'or...
Defender for Haalands first goal literally didn’t even try
It's not Cologne and it's definitely not Holland ! What is up with that commentator
5:23 Haaland: yeah think I’m ready for the big move
How is Jadon Stencho valued higher than him? They only value Haaland at £100 mil while Stencho is worth £120mil
Haaland will probably win balloon d’or in next years, but would not be so easy for him if he would have played against Maldini, Beckenbauer, Baresi, Cannavaro, Nesta and many more. So rare to see good defender in this years. Ps: Defender in first haaland goal is just a shame.
Who is Horland?
Haaland, sancho and Bellingham carrying this team...
That was not a penalty
Why is this idiot commentator obsessed with saying Horland. It's Haaland ffs 😑
Haaland is ridiculously good
knowing him he probably wasn't pissed at the team he was probably pissed at himself cos he doesn't like missing even only a few chances
Utd need him. Please don’t go to city 🙏🏽
He's a bit arrogant and hot headed.
Welcome to the Bridge, Haaland 🔥
I hate this commentator saying whoreland 😂
Seems a 1 man team that's way below has lands level
He's on the move alrite he shouldn't have went to BVB, should of went to United and United would probably have won the league and still been in the UCL maybe and f.a. cup tomorrow
Where is Roman Bürki
Haaland has to leave at the end of the season, he can't keep carrying the dead wood in this team
No help.
Aslanim emre can fena pas atmis
The guy is a beast
If barca somehow land him (doubt they will) and keep messi (most likely). Messi assists and haalands goals will go📈📈📈📈📈📈
I didn’t even think he stormed 😂 a little click bait BT Sport 😅
To everyone in the comments trying to be smart, this commentator is actually pronouncing his name better than almost everyone else does.
The hungriest player I’ve ever seen!
Just another day at the office for haaland 😎
Title should be "Haaland leaves pitch via the tunnel at full time as team mates sulk on the pitch"
Mia san mia
No way is he staying this summer
Hoping Haaland doesn't lose that winning mentality, so easily swayed by most footballers just trying to look good and get a fat paycheck
Tell me any other striker that would control that pass and convert it to a goal in today's game, literally with 2 touches tamed a wild a pass and then put the ball in place for his natural left foot
That first touch which led to the goal from Haaland at the start was unbelievable! He’s a breathtaking player right now🔥🙌
“WHORELAND”
When Haaland scores 2  Lewandowski scores an hat trick
looks like he's coming to chelsea then
No one: Commentator: WhOReLaNd
No one:  The commentator: “Horland”
I see Haaland leaving Dortmund this summer..🥱
If only refs were like this in the premier league. They actually go look at the screens
Love the passion in Haaland just wish the other Dortumand players would do the same. Definitely a challenge to Bayern Munich in the Bundersleiga
Holeaaaaaand -.-
Most of his anger came from chances he missed, he’s so hungry for goals. What a player he will be, his passion is amazing to watch
Man City are gonna have all kinds of fun with that defence.
Man City will definitely exploit Dortmund's weaknesses, conceding goals.
The way he is going he has the potential to be the greatest forward ever in the game. I said potential. So let's see if he can fulfil it. I think he should not move club ATM. He needs to stay a Dortmund for two more seasons and keep developing. There is no rush to secure the big money move. After that it would be amazing if he comes to Liverpool to link up with Klopp. Imagine that.
i support city and haalands ability to make any chance seem scorable like when he hit the far post from the cross is scary i hope we can beat dortmund
Just at the age of 20, EH already possesses the mentality of Prime Cristiano Ronaldo; who at that stage developed and implemented his "be the best" mentality.  Imagine Haaland in his prime, when he turns into a man (aged 25+), every defender will be scared of the Norwegian and will carry a "alpha male, beast mode" reputation!
Already too big for the big.... I can see him break most of Ronaldo's records....  Sad to say but this man is going for it all
Wouldn't say storms out stop trying to unsettle him. He missed like 6 chances of anything he's mad at himself not his TEAMMATES
I feel bad for Dortmund fans...they have a player to get excited about but their board will never buy a solid squad to back him and will just end up selling him...and the cycle will continue with Bellingham, Sancho, Reyna...
Why's he saying whoreland?
"Hawlaaand".
Halland shifts for such a big fella too. He can move through the gears fast. Want him at Liverpool please Id take him for Salah every day of the week.
Erling reminds me of Micheal Jordan, that winning mentality.
Haaland is just a machine without him Dortmund would be doing so much worse
He'll be at Bayern next year.
Haaland is set to become the most expensive player in the world.
We are witnessing a very special generational player. Miles ahead of anyone with the goals he has at he’s age
He needs to move to a better club he is a one man army here carrying the team without him they would be near the bottom of the league
got that Michael jordan mindset
Why is the video quality so zig zaggy? xD EVERYTIME!
Haaland is already looking like the player Lukaku could’ve been. Similar attributes and styles, but Haaland seems (so far) to be much more clinical.
Why is one of the commentators sound like he’s out of breath. Such a mouth breather 😂
Very understandable when I see footballer all chillin and shaking hands after a lose I don’t get how they do it I get pissed after a 5-a-side game with my mates😂
3:22 Had to see that one a couple of times wow
'storms down tunnel'
This Dortmund team is like Juve right now, passing it to that one guy that can bag a goal from nothing and then making stupid mistakes to throw the game
Haaland is like a cyborg built in a laboratory. 🤯🤯🤯
Two goals and three great attempts - or what Haaland would call a "bad day".
haalands mentality is unmatched
I swear he's already got two goals against Man city
Hall and
Haaland upset because he's missed chances that he thinks he should score. Also Dortmund defence is poor
If Haaland goes to Man City ggs
That first goal was a thing of beauty.
Bye bye Dortmund that’s a sign he’s off !!!
Welcome to Leeds United Haaland !
Look at that fkn touch 0:07
Everyone calls him Haaland...bt idiot Holand...wtf
WHORELAND
I wouldn't say he stormed off. He just left the field straight away. Probably he was just disappointed. I can't seem him saying at Dortmund Beyond the end of this season. He obviously wants more than he can achieve with them.
commentators voice makes me want to kill myself
He's just got the ronaldo's about him is all... it's not a bad attitude, He's obviously pissed off with himself for missing all those chances... I bet that's all it is...   And demanding more from yourself is always a good attribute...   He's going to go down in history this lad..
Big up BT sport for keeping the time up
Can we talk about that Emre Can pass ?
Whoreland?
“WHORELAND”
Haalnd please come to Chelsea
got to love horland
Defo leaving Dortmund
I hope Haaland goes to Bayern Munich then they'll have upamencano as well they'll be unstoppable 😂
Come city yeah erling?
Needs to come play with me at the RED side of London
Bvb is basically a team full of youngsters
I get he has been scoring the goals but for him to storm off  down the tunnel is a bit much it's called a football team bye bye Haaland 👋 bit of a baby 👶
Sad to think what Man City will do to Dortmund in a few weeks. Let’s hope Dortmund at least keep it respectable
He’s leaving this summer and should.
He just threw his shirt to the other guy, be humble haaland
Real madrid will get him
Haaland is a joke
Winning mentality
Nobody: Commentator: Hall-And
He kept plugging away after his missed chances and got the equaliser. It just speaks volumes about his mentality and refusal to be too disheartened.
Haaland is the only chance Dortmund have of beating Man City.
Emre Can long passes 2 Haaland are superb💯💯💯💯💯
He’s better than mbappe idc
Dortmund's defenders ALL need to RETIRE!! They're wasting the attacking talents of their teammates.
WTF is Holland??
I love 🇳🇱holland
Haaland has to go to a better club, he’s wasted at Dortmund
Haaland is world class, needs to come to Man City. Their defence makes me happy for the quarter final draw
Haaland looks like lana rhoades
Halaand will soon collect some haters, but I think he shows signs of a future superstar in terms of mentality.  Only the best score two goals and rescue a point for their team and then leave the pitch pissed off. He knows the game should've been won.  What a player!
Haaland is getting a ticket to a big prem club at this rate
Will easily become the best striker on the planet for the next 10-12 years. What a talent!
Why's the commentator calling him whoreland? I hate when they just randomly change the player's names.
Haaland is literally carrying dortmund along he's way above everyone in the team and looks certain to leave at the end of this season!!
cmon🙄, from the title i thought he started punching the walls of the tunnel or smt. he just walked off frustrated as he should it’s not that deep🤷‍♂️
Whoreland
Dormund would fight for relegation if halaand wasn't playing for them
Haaland can't stop scoring
Hopefully Arsenal buy Haaland in the summer
Haaland is fed up of the farmers around him
Packing his bags ready for man city
Real need to buy him
Was I the only one that heard whoreland at first
They are missing Sancho.
Haaland is a hungry beast
Commentator: Haaland - “Whoreland” Bellingham - “Spellingham” FC Koln - “Efftsayy Kerrn” Meunier - Mernier
That pen decision is woeful
Why on earth is the commentator calling him Erling Whoreland
Commentator keeps saying horland? 🤔
this guy will rip the prem apart
I always find it funny when commentators will pronounce Cologne in Germanic 'koln', but won't pronounce Bayern Munich as Bayern Munchen- just a little observation I noticed
Its shows he cares for this club even if he is leaving in the summer. Respect 🙌
Storming down the tunnel too see his chiropractor after carrying Dortmund all season
He b a UTD player nxt season ⚽️🥅
Dortmund better fix that defence ASAP, or else Man City are going do a lot damage to them
storming all the way to stamford bridge. my guy.
Its pronounced Ho-land now??
Haaaaaaalannnndddd the DON
He ran to the physio. His backs killing him from carrying the team..
What a performance from horeland
"Dad get me to City"
Come to citty erlllinnng. We will win everything
its not hall-and, its haaa-lund idiot
Haaland has just an elite mentality. Will recieve the ball in unnatural situations and make a chance. Passionate on the pitch and looking for a win. Can see why he was upset after his team being poor defensively. It must be frustrating carrying a team on your back at a young age.
3:51 PODOLSKI REGEN WITH THE LEFT-FOOT FINISH
Man City called Haaland, that's why he ran away. 📞
That first touch and pass oh lord 😂 made it look so easy
Benzemas a better striker than he will ever be!!!
Imagine if he came to Leeds!
come to man utd we need a proper striker
Haaland should go to PSG and they'll be invincible!!
Hore-land
Haaland is too good for dortmund
We’ve had Horland, haaland and now horLAND
The commentator is pissing me off it’s not Holland ffs 🤦‍♂️
Zlatan + Ronaldo = haaland
Harland need too hurry up and sigh for city
Haaland please come to Milan
At this point, Haaland is carrying Dortmund.
Why do they keep calling him whoreland, like jeez
Erling Whoreland - according to this commentary
anyone else annoyed by the interlaced frames?
He wont be there next season .best striker in the world at the moment
Needs to come to the best league in the world to become world class, the premier league. Could become a legend. Any other league not so much in these current times. Will be for 10+ years aswell. Look at the state of all the other leagues. Pretty embarrassing. Come to the prem Halland
Bloody hell this guy is CLASS!  every week. Is he this good or is the bundesliga just that poor? Whoever signs him in the summer dominates domestically and in Europe for years to come
Haaland is better than Mbappe
Plot twist: He really needed to use the toilet
MUNIER OUTT
If only martial had the same mentality
Dortmund such money grabbing fools. Won’t even invest in their defence. Just want the next up and coming youngsters to sell on and make a profit. Used to love them but it’s so clear where their intentions lay
Haaland: I scored a brace Borussia Dortmund's defence: Not if I can help it
I didn't realise Dortmund's defence was this bad
Haaland best striker in the world
City are gonna absolutely destroy this dortmound defence 😭😭😭... i feel bad for them already
Bruh that awful defence is gonna get destroyed by Man City
It pisses me off the commentator saying horland like bro where u see a o in his name
He is either City or Barca type of player.
Look at BT pushing the narrative that Haaland isn’t happy at Dortmund 😂
Haaland will definitely be off this summer. Question is will it be PSG, Real Madrid, Juventus, United, Chelsea or Man City
Halaands back is hurting can’t blame Him
He needs to leave with Sancho
Storming to his new united contract.
Haaland seems to get better by the game. It's like maxing out a player on Fifa!
Erling Haaland - welcome to Manchester United.
3:23 Jesus, he murdered him
He’s turning into a great striker, but there’s something about his attitude that I don’t like
He's well outta there in the summer
“Horlaaand”
Your looking at Chelsea's NEW Didia DROGBA!
“Storms down tunnel” he just goes down the tunnel to the dressing room what else is he supposed to do?
He’s probably pissed at himself aswell cause he missed countless opportunities
People just gonna disregard that ball played to Haaland?
Unstoppable haaland
Erling Whoreland.
Bo Duda nam się udał .....ole⛷
Lool at that first touch, being pressured aswell🔥 what a goat
So Haaland clearly gets his shirt pulled in the box and no one bats an eyelid, then at the other end Koln kick the ball at an arm tucked in to the players side and it's a penalty...
Haaland has told us how we pronounce his name yet this guy trying to be edgy pronouncing it different, what a plum
Halland is the best 👌
The Gods were against him today plain and simple.
I think it's 'Haaland' not "Holand"
In what world is that a penalty
Why does the commentater say earling hoorlaand
His movement in the box is exceptional, he's obsessed with scoring. Whoever gets this young man is going to purchase an elite level player and is only 20 years of age!
Haaland is a absolute machine
Come to City!
Haland is too good for Dortmund there’s so many games he’s scores 2,3 goals and Dortmund draw or lose
Haaland is 100% leaving in the summer
Haaland is 100% leaving in the summer
Why the hell is the commentator calling him whoreland?
Will he leave if they don’t make champions league? That’s the question.
Relentless goal scorer. Actually making people tune into a league full of bums, fair play. Whoever signs him after his Dortmund spell wins the champions league it’s that simple.
We need him at United. Bruno and Haaland. Would be causing havoc every game
This guys pronunciation of everything pisses me off
Whats that think on Jude Bellingham's neck
Not a handball tho is it?
Haaland not Holland
Angry at himself for only scoring 2 goals!! He's a monster!! Next most expensive player in the world. The question is who is going to pay the most for him?
If dortmund did have sancho and haaland and Bellingham
okay but why is no one talking about cans ball to haland?
He's defo on the move next season
Him storming off deffo shows his winning mentality. However it frustrates me because if he was a young black player he would be seen as ‘unprofessional’ SMH
Hawlaand
Only haaland could walk off pissed af after scoring a brace to equalise the game 😂😂
I'm pretty sure it isn't pronounced whoreland
5-3 city with a hatrick from haaland
Come on! Watching the Harland goals, not sure he will survive the premiership! Way better defenders.
Wtf is holand?
Who’s horland the commentator kept mentioning
Why is the commentator calling him whoreland tho?😂
City will rip this bvb defense apart but one thing is that Dortmund can score
Join barca we won't do this
Players asking for your shirt at the age of 20. If he moves to Man City the EPL is a one horse race for years to come.
2nd best form in the world right now (Lewa)
Dortmund is nothing without haaland ... Smh they're so poor defensively they couldn't defend their lead against Bayern when haaland did all the work at the start. Imagine if he went to atletico with such a strong defence. Cuz the reason why atletico hasn't won la Liga yet is they don't score enough and their atk is nowhere near their lvl of defence.
Dortund's defence are such a constant let down.
5:22 Instead of shaking hands with the opposition and swapping shirts gracefully Haaland chucked his shirt at the player, never took his and walked off lol
What is it with the commentator and “horelands”
commentator over does it
But yet Mark from the United Stand says it would be a mistake if we get this guy before getting a CM and CB lol. I mean the utter🐎💩
This Dortmund team letting Haaland down time and time again
Haaland reminds me of Sid from Toy Story
Farmers league
Bundesliga defending is awful. First goal the guy just gives up.
He should be careful this is what happened to Alexis Sanchez Alway meaning about the team, and wanted a move then look what happened. He was Class at Arsenal. Meaning about always  winning and wanted to win is good. But if he turning on he team mates then that's a problem.
Haaland storming down the tunnel is symbolic. Big indication that he’ll be leaving this summer. He must be sick of this Dortmund squad, constantly letting him down.
What's on Bellingham's neck?
If haaland comes to the prem he better be prepared for the absolute units that will shoulder to shoulder him aggressively and tackle him hard asf lol. German defenders are not physical really.
Dortmund are going to get rattled by man city with that defence
HALAND IS WAY WAY TOO GOOD
The way things are going Dortmund might end up losing both Sancho and Haaland unless they win the Championship League
Come to Chelsea
Meunier is actaully awful the downgrade from hakimi to him is actually insane
“Here is Spellingham”
Haalands far to good to be at dortmund , the rest of the team are weak especially at the bk , everyone team in the world will want him this summer hes a different class
Why the hell Liverpool ignore him
Haaland needs to play at a better club, Bayern maybe AHAHHA
come and join man utd erling
Welcome to Manchester United.
No doubt haaland is quality but wtf is that defender doing on the first goal , the bundesliga is a farmers league dont even come at me only bayern are strong enough to compete with other teams every other team in this league would get relegated from the Premier league FARMERS LEAGUE
Horeland!
Haaland's best quality is his desire to win. The desire to score by any means. Thats a rare quality now days with strikers
What's on Bellinghams neck???
Commentator be talking about a place where all my exes go...
Without Sancho’s brilliance and brain bvb will struggle even with Haaland, he’s doing soo much already, with Sancho they just both work brilliantly
BELL-ENDINGHAM
why does all of your footage have garbage scanlines
He needs to not get so frustrated during the game. If he misses a shot, getting pissed off doesn't make the next one easier
Storm down? The editor need to use a dictionary or a thesaurus
Dortmund don’t deserve Haaland and Sancho man
ridiculous penalty
Haaland deserves better
“Whoreland” horrible pronunciation
Haaland: I scored a brace again  Lewandowski: Hold my beer.
This new horland fella seems decent!!
Sowing the seeds for the big move in the summer
Clickbait in 2021 ffs
ddddd
I dont think I've seen Halaand not finish so many chances in one game before.
Hes like a Zlatan Ibrahimovic with pace.
What a player this erling horland seems to be
Haaland is the reason Dortmund aren’t getting relegated, let alone trying to carry them to top 4
Probably getting fed up of carrying Dortmund, also no Sancho.
HAALAND WAS TOO UNLUCKY! COULD OF BEEN 5  GOALS
With this defending City will school Dortmund. One player carrying this team. Must be frustrating for him.
haaland's clearly just running to stamford bridge
He is too good for Dortmund.
Haaland is just zlatans irl regen
Haaland seems like the only pro from Borussia. He gives it 110% every game.
Haaland to Man City mark my words
Halands power is so elite his shot is slow motion is faster than most other peoples shots in real time
Good old click bait titles.
Lol
H-oh-land, H-ah-land... To-may-to, To-mah-to.  He’s the bees knees!
They’re finished. 5th best team in Bundesliga. Monchengladbach 10th. City got blessed with the run in to the semi final
Did the koln player ask to swap shirts?
Dortmund tactics = Pass the ball to Haaland.
Erling don’t stress yourself, Just back your bags n come to Utd 😏
Jude Bellingham is the most overrated play I’ve ever watched in my life
This is why Man City will beat Dortmund to face Bayern
Guys take a dead breath and realise.              Halaand is soooooooo good
Haaland reminds me of a young hybrid of Ibra, Drogba and Costa 🔥  Would love to see him at the bridge next season 😏
Only Haaland could turn that first ball into a goal somehow. What a player. He's cArrying Dortmund so badly. If only they could defend well.
The first goal was very poor defending and goal keeping no need to suck haaland off for everything imo
Lewandowski is clear...
As a Leeds fan, Dortmund have always been my second favourite team for some reason. Then found out Dortmund as officially twinned with Leeds and then, of course, Leeds Legend Erling Haaland started playing for them.
Again Haaland 2 goals and Lewandowski 3 🔥🔥🔥🔥👑👑
lol "hawland"
Lethal, precise, strong, visionary and quick. All the striker role qualities combined in a player 🏆
I think haaland will be a better fit for city rather than utd
One thing about Haaland that always stands out is his winning mentality which is a great attribute for a young footballer
Doesn’t look like a storm to me
His a beast every time he misses he wants to kill someone 😊
Does the commentator have asthma or what
He's going to real madrid next season
If he didn't miss 8 sitters they would have won
Noone:  Absolutely noone: BT Bundesliga Commentators: *ElLinG hOrLAnD*
first
Future Chelsea striker
How they exaggerate the title
The question is... What's its next for haaland??
just doesn’t miss does he
Storms off down the tunnel at full time... He walked down the tunnel a bit fast 😂😂😂
I'd be pissed too trying to carry a team that are so poor defensively at times at the age of just 20
Unless Dortmund win the Champions League this season then Haaland will be playing for a new club in the Champions League next season because at this rate their not going to even qualify for European football next season.
Haland=🤖
Erling Haaland. More like Erling storm down the tunnel and full time Haaland
Haaland will probably leave Dortmund in the summer
Haaland has the potential to be the best striker in the world over the next decade easily! 🤧😎
9th #
Lolololollol
Haaland is actually class though, hope we’ll see him in the prem one day 🤞
Haaland is a mad man
Needs a new team
Haaland to Chelsea💙💙💙💙
