dirty little cheat
Trennis McCann
Needles and pins
Mccann eating trenbolone sandwiches the cheat
Just heard he got caught on 💉
Just seen he failed a vada drug test just before his big fight in 24 Dec. Smh what was he thinking he has youth cardio and fitness
No chances for Casimero
Casimero will beat this guy easily if they fight  ...styles make fight and McCann is taylor made for Casimero . McCann chin is questionable i dont think he can take Take Casimero power left hook😊
Whos here for McCann vs Casimero Fight next year 🤗
Lovely boxing fair play to both sides 💯💯🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
This lads a beast 💪 👌 👏
Got a future.Strand back to the drawing board
Great boxer Is Denis mc cann and hopefully better future will get to the top 🥊
Chill
Go on Dennis all the way great boxer ❤
Dennis schooled him and he was right.
Love Denis, looked like he gassed-out by Round 8 though? I only saw the highlights.
Like to see Dennis vs Lara
How is this a domination , he got caught way too much to call it domination  He moves a lot without doing much , lis be worried if I was his team because the minute he fights anyone that can punch and move he’s finished .
Why isn’t Dennis having that re match???
I love this mccan
brilliant boxer but i’m not much of a fan of
Mcann fights another tin can😅
Denis is that skilled it doesn’t ever seem like his corner are talking to him as he’s doing everything right
Didnt even know that was happening ..
Macann is overrated ffs stevie wonder can see it !
Everybody in comments hating are just jealous bums . Dennis is young and fighting his way up and doing it properly he is a class act and a brilliant boxer he will go all the way . Yall just like to hate gtfoh
Liam Davies will destroy him any round he sees fit
Lee eaton proper tool
Dennis is amazing on a different level.  Doing what he dose best 🥊🥊
They give belts away by beating up.eggs ?? Wow
Brad with a few more rounds wd of beat him
I will give a homeless person a DOLLAR for every like I get
Followed this lad from the beginning he’s a class act gunna go far in the game I reckon
Good boxer strand.
McCans very flat footed and wide. Be interesting to see how he deals with a good mover. Exciting prospect without a doubt. My 8 year old will KO him in 12 years time.
Dennis is dedicated and always gives 110% and he's a genuine gentleman he definitely has got what it takes to be a world champion 💯💪and I forgot to mention he definitely earns his haribo treats every time hands down 😂
Atleast he beat someone decent for once instead off some washed up fighter but ide say its the first time really that dennis mccann has fought someone with a winning record
The commentary is a joke as usual ye mccan winning easy but the boy strand hadcsome succes just overlooked, embarrassing
Good fight from Dennis, he Took a load of shots though, from a white collar boxer at best.. I feel when this lad steps up he will get rinsed at world level. Loads still to improve on
Well done Mccann, only 23 years old
To be fair ,,, Dennis , is a whole other class , but ide expect him to deal with this guy within 12.
Dennis has a good stance
If hes only the one lung thats the first ive heard…
Fairplay sublick 🇮🇪👍
Not to hate, but this is basically his level. Once he faces someone who hits back and shows a threat, Mcann will be found out (like in his last fight). Credit to the lad though, seems a solid pro.
McCann v Ball
Very fast slick switch by McCann from southpaw to orthodox to catch strand with the 1-2
Wanna see these guys move up the levels in terms of opposition, no offence and hats of to him but Brad isn’t British level, McCann needs serious opposition now
True boxing. ❤
Dennis is overrated
class act . 🥊
This was actually a great fight domestically, both good fighters 👌  I think Mccann would struggle with a bigger puncher, someone who will sit and defend as he goes in with his shots, then trade back.  Strand just didn’t seem to get going, moment he started putting it on him more he was getting success, but what do I know?! I’m just a fan 🤣 good luck to both lads
Gave that man a LGBTQ belt 😂
Needed that after getting lucky in the last fight.
Overated
DOMESTIC  FIGHTERS   ONLY.
Is that MiMi from shameless shouting her head off?
Stylish boxer that’s it no punching power to go to the very top !! He should be knocking these boxers out for an early night !! Tap boxing points scored that’s it
Was I only one watching this on fast motion?
Dedication GETS Results - Dennis Is A SUPER Athelete.  TOP LAD.
Meh
McCann no where near as good as he thinks,he was beaten in his last fight aswell European level at best,
Dennis McCann is a star 🔥. Where’s the O’Leary highlights ?
Going to the top 💯
Thanks Brad wasn’t Mexican 😂
Never going all the way.
He gets absolutely rinsed against first puncher he faces, spoon fed so far.
He said he was in the best shape of his life and it looks like he wasn't messin.
Forget world level McCann
Any chance of us seeing mcann in against somebody decent or is he going the Billy Joe path?
Glad I never watched it live.
12 rounds against a punch bag 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Commentators make me laugh sometimes its like they haven’t got a clue about boxing lol
No doubt the menace would deliver
Most disciplined I've seen mccan
🔥🔥
McCann is a decent British level fighter he has zero world class attributes, being completely honest he will never be anywhere near world level.
Getting better
Good boxer .but not elite.
Good boxing head but lacks powers. The Mexican hitters will leave him a write off .
Followed this lad from the beginning he’s a class act gunna go far in the game I reckon
Let’s go
Dennis is a hard working boxer. Congratulations
Mcannr getting the omally treatment and only allowed to fight these.....strand was undefeated but look who against 😂jheeze like a journey's man journey, they molly coddlin mcann in case he looses, struggled bad in last fight so promotions giving a win instead of rematch...boxers are literally brasses these days
🎯
Good boxing from Dennis well done
Looking good Dennis...💯💥💥💥
Looks impressive in this Joe is great trainer and was a great boxer to mixed it with good fighters James degale being one in his time . For me Joe and Ben Davison two of the best in the UK
Get boxing from Dennis !
The first to view this 😅
2nd
Go on Dennis!
