Tom is so upbeat and happy in these vlogs that it almost cures my depression.
Prob the 3rd time I’ve said this, but I’m so glad you and Lydia are enjoying your time together again.
It’s been years since i’ve watched a video from you and just hearing your voice brings back so many memories, will be sure to start watching again man, glad you still make content bro 🙏🏽
Congratulations Uncle Syndicate
That's awesome, really cool to see you and Lydia blooming.
Ok Tom I only want you to do what you want to do but why you gotta get our hopes up with the Minecraft stuff man…
6 years ago since Alec passed away Tom’s make a wish. Hope youre still up there young dude
"teamwork makes the dream work" *Tom stands filming Alice doing it all*
Welcome to Canada?
Pls look at Colin furze and how he built a tunnel, and do it between your houses
Where’s the minecraft video Tom
Aw. Happy Birthday Lydia!!
Wasn’t much of a surprise😂 Reddit knew you was together
Tom you should take Lydia on a camping holiday
I haven't watched you for quite a while but I do pop back in every now and again, it is nice seeing how you are doing as I grew up watching you back at the release of black ops when I enjoyed playing the cod games!  Keep at it Tom!
If I took anything from this video, I now own an air compressor 👀👀
tom get a starlink internet system,  its pricey but worth it for the international insane speeds. i watch truck campers who use it in the middle of no where
This video made me smile so much, nothing is better than seeing Tom and Lydia laughing and enjoying life, I'm so happy to see you two together. Lots of love Tom, to you and Lydia.
Canada at last Tom? And happy birthday R Lyd
God damn I love this man. With all my heart, it makes me so happy to see you 2 love birds enjoy each other’s time.
I started watching you from the OG Lonely Island Series, I watched the heck out of it... I must admit I haven't watched much of your content in the last few years, but to see this vlog pop up, and to be able to see the happiness and joy you bring to everyone around you and to yourself is really inspiring. It's great to see how far you've come and to see how many people have grown with you no matter when they started watching your content from. You have always been one of my favorite content creators, even through your ups and down. Don't ever stop being the light for some people, you've brought me countless hours of joy and I'm sure you will bring many more hours to myself and everyone who supports you in what you do. Thank you Tom!!!   PS, Happy Belated Bday Lydia!!!!
4:06 my gf after a night out
When are we gonna see Ron again?
I don’t believe right now this is gunna be the best adventure, the New Zealand trip was awesome to watch
Colorado?
I’m sure I saw your Audi in stalybridge there was a blonde haired woman driving it
I’ve been subscribed for 8 years of my life. I’ve grown up watching you man. I am now twenty.. time sure does fly
Tom I started watching you when I was 14. Now I`m 65 and I still watch your vlogs. You are a huge inspiration.
What a lovely vlog! 😍
I havent watched Syndicate in a few years, just saw the vlog pop up on my recommended so I popped in. But just watching and seeing Ken and Lidia reminds how much Tom was part of growing up for me. Tom, if you see this mate, thanks for making so many people happy for so many years, and keeping on. You 10 years ago would have been speechless watching this vlog, enjoy every bit of life man, you deserve every bit.
I literally sell does exact teepee
It’s a good video while drunk. I say 10/10
What a hateful excuse for a human
If you and Lydia are in the same place in Canada Land. and find your way over to Alberta for whatever reason. I know its a high chance in hell. But I offer a free couples shoot for you guys as a birthday gift to her, and general gift for you as you were the reason I got into content creation. If by chance you see this, it would be an honour.
i wish you made car magnets
Much love Tom! Glad to see you still living it up and making the best of each day!
glad you and Lydia are back together you two are such a beautiful couple
Ur very cute talking about Lydia haha
Fucking love you bro
Only legends know he changed the thumbnail
Crazy how long you’ve been going for on yt mate remember watching your zombies videos when i was like 13 and now I’m 24 😂 feels like I’ve grown up with y hahahaha keep up the good work
Yesssss! KENNETHHHG
Love Ken
What a legend you are Tom
the eyes she gave you when you wished her a happy birthday and she was getting her food >>> so happy for you both

Thanks Tom for another cracking video as they make me laugh so much and can't wait for the big adventure.
Gosh wish I had a birthday like this. Noone remembered including my family. Was never bothered about the gifts just wanted the effort of calling me x
So happy for you and Lydia. Over the past few vlogs with you two going on holidays has made all of us wonder if there's anything going on so thank you for sharing and confirming.

Filmed at the summer solstice… tom did it take u a whole month to edit this?? 🤣🤣 jk all the love <3 this party turned out amazing, glad to see you so motivated and happy ❤ (the birthday cake is a lie)

These are the best type of vlogs!!
the baked Alaska cake !
Such a wholesome vlog, so happy you guys are back together ❤️
“I don’t think we’re gonna need to do our sit-ups tonight” god damnit Tom 🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Lydia's sister is a hotty
"The only people who survived" list's off half the squad 🤣🤣
KENITH i lovr u tom happy birthday lidia
Happy birthday Lydia hope you have a great time I’m sure Tom will make that happen 🎉🌹🎈🎈
Deserves a like& a comment just for the ‘that’s what she said’ because even if it wasn’t there… we’d of all thought it😂 us men just stay children I’m sure of it😂
hey, 👋🏻🖤
Started off with a Ken (would ya just look at it) and had Tom MC by as well? It's gonna be a great day 😁👍
Where’s the minecraft videos gone😭😭
Bet Lydia goes absolutely nuts for those crocs Tom 😂
God I've gotta do more with my life instead of working and gaming
Boss lad
Awesome video,  didn't you get a mini projector with built-in speaker for Christmas?
What happens to the projector you had for Christmas, built in speakers
Bro how you not using your cinema room 😧
what can i say ?? LIFE TOO SHORT MAKE THE MOST OF IT ,  love it mr syndicate
MASSIVE Boyfriend points to youuuuu!
All I can say is this was birthday goals! Right down to the food of choice. GG for getting it all set up in time!
Why does man say dating, when he is British .
ALL OF THE FRIENDS, what an amazing group of "family" you guys have
Oh yeah! Epic birthday for Lydia vlog! Can't wait for the next one! 😁
Hope you enjoy your adventure in Canada! Most of my family live over there and we just came back a few weeks ago from staying with them in Montréal for a few weeks - it's a truly stunning country!
If only he had a nebula projector....
Tom, you’re looking fit in this video. Have you been hitting the weights?
Cross Canada tour confirmed?
ken is genuinely my hero😂 the man is as gorgeous as ever and as funny as ever!!
AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! I can't wait for this adventure!!! This video was amazing!!!!!
I find it ironic that Lydia hasn’t ever been camping while I’ve been spending the last two and a half months camping and am currently in my tent watching this.
Lovely introduction to the video Ken 🖕🤣
You look like a piece of feta cheese next to your dad 🤣 So happy to see you and Lydia enjoying life together! For many years to come I hope 💙 Off to the Canadian adventure vlogs with your adventure buddy!!! 💜💜
Should have watch Harry Potter and the goblet of fire and hooked up the projector in the pool room. Could have been floating in the pool like you were on the lake
Gunna be trying to pick up some merc this week if it's still available x
"This smell like jeff" tom george cassell 2k17
cant wait for these new adventure vlogs, it feels like just yesterday that you were in Iceland with the boys
He really does love Lydia   glad ur happy Tom x
You're looking well Tom, happy birthday to her mate!
Looks like he is back in Canada especially with the bear comment
goated birthday planner
The selfish content side of me said “why didn’t you record her reaction” but then that new “maturing” side said CAUSE HE DIDNT WANT TO SO HE DIDNT - small steps are sometimes the biggest steps to bare.
What's up with the audio
"so now that everyone knows Lydia and I are dating" oh we knew Tom... We knew. 😂❤️
Love the vlogs
Seeing that food got me hungry! Happy bday miss! 👍🏽👍🏽  looked like a time

Has he revealed why he opened the bottle yet?
Who’s the guy sitting next to Karen when they are watching a movie?
Tom: "Lydia has never been camping"  Proceeds to setup brand new tents in million dollar mansions back yard with projector and speakers. Lol. Just because you're in a tent dosent make it camping... Maybe that's "UK Camping" lol
The genuine happiness in this vlog is the best ✌🏻
