"if you get any bigger I'll leave you" with pleasure
Noel to ex: you do realize your optional the gym is required
jokes on you i have no friends😂😂😂😢
Those latts were popping out pretty good honestly dude was probably jealous.
"Get any bigger, I'll leave you!" Noel: "bet"
Nah because does anyone else agree with this ex?
I dont have any friends does it mean I don't have a future?
What is the name of the music?
Ngl i feel like having diverse people as friends is also just as good, kinda gives you new experiences
Same with fishing
I have a question is chicken tacos good for u
u r an inspiration
I don’t know the context, but one thing is obvious: saying you’ll leave someone because they’re too muscular is a really shitty thing to do. One the other hand, maybe she was worried about the effects of steroid usage and didn’t want to commit to someone who could potentially die early? I don’t know, like I said I don’t know the context. Either way, I love Noel’s content.  Very wholesome, funny, and informative. I also appreciate how open and transparent he is. Honestly, sounds like her loss more than anything.
It's my Family and everyone around me that doesn't want me to continue my Gym Goals. And I'm still in school without their money I can't go to the gym, or eat.
An ex told me you have time to go to a shitty gym but you don't have time to clean your house....
It's ok you can be with me if so... 😂❤
If I could like a video twice, I would do it for this video
I can see that happening.. its not pretty when shrek is crushing fiona in human form 😂😂
Lgbtv people should not watch this video
What if I have no friends and it’s just the gym 😢😢😢
I think noel maxed out
He left her before she could leave him.  **EMOTIONAL DAMAGE**
You can’t tell him to not get bigger, like telling the sun to not shine 🧐🧐🧐
Putting your addiction before relationships with real people. Sounds healthy.
My girl that thinks my favorite hat (it’s a Russian ushanka) is an ick, how much should I care about this?
😂🎉❤
Masculinity over everything
Bro left faster then my dad😂😂
It's ok, you're ok.
Bro peaced out faster than my dad
isnt he gay
Maybe it’s because steroids shrink your junk
😘💪😌
Bro never hesitated 😂😂😂
Its my mom...help me
*_" This is the best motivation I would ever have in my life! "_*
I mean i kinda understand for the women you will look extremely cross if you are too big
Noel, you needed to hear this even though the phrasing was shit. What you are doing to yourself will kill you and will cripple you, you can’t always sit inside echo chambers… Sometimes some harsh truth is the thing you need to hear, even though you don’t want to.
Shes just scared a more pretty better chick will steal u away bc shes not good enough 🙄 happens every time a chick gives ultimatums.. never give in to them. Ever. If u do, now she onows what to do to get her way and forget how YOU FEEL. they'll just threaten to leave if u don't do what she wants. Never give in. Ever. Csnt say it enough. Never fear being alone or fear of the 🍑 walking out the door. There's BETTER ones out there and she knows it. Thats why shes giving u the ultimatum in the first place. To scare u into staying LOW so shes emotionally safe and doesnt worry about u attracting another woman 🙄
Originally my partner said If I ever got jacked she thought she'd be grossed out. A little while after that she started in the gym With me we both lost alot of weight I look great and she feels better about it
adios, baby
Can you get bigger than him?
Yes but also don't align yourself with people that you wouldn't want to be because you are the product of who you surround yourself with
Who on their right mind would leave you ?
Absolutely agree surround yourself with people who uplift you
Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.. damn son.
This is happening to me right now but damn I can't leave her I love her but anyways am getting big I Don't care
My honest reaction
He’s a goat
'If it gets any bigger, I'll leave you' 🍆
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you!" *Evaporates completely,to get rid of misunderstandings*
Bro became my dad
Bro really said "say less" in 200 language
I'll sub you if you keep talking this good 🥺❤️
I mean I’m not a girl. And if I’m a guy and my girl gets overweight. I honestly don’t know what I would say. But if ur a girl telling a guy about this subject (which I say if ur a girl because it’s less sensitive to talk about for men usually) I feel like u should be more nicer if ur gonna bring that up. Definitely don’t threaten to leave. Any time a human hears a threat about a loved one leaving, or getting fired, stuff like that. It don’t make the other person inspired to wanna stay. They just wanna leave u now that u said that
FREE PALISTINE
What's the song 🎵
Bro escaped faster than me running for my life💀
My wife hates the bodybuilder look, but she loves me and knows how much bodybuilding means to me so she still makes sure I have the food and supplements I need to reach my goals and is still in my corner no matter how big I get
Impossible. A perfect human being
doing it for them, does it for you
*gets massive*
Dad I only have 2 friends 😅
I imagine she probably left you because you were willing to prioritize getting big over your long term health by using steroids.
Cute turn to teh camera. U adorboteddybear
Well I have no friends so I guess no future for me💀
💅
No friends… no future
What if i have no friends to show lmao
Noel unlocked a new ability: He got so buff now he can teleport
I've got no friends. What's my future? 🙂
He isn't a Simp he is a Gimp 💪😎👍 G = Gym
But my situation is different, if you get any thinner, I'll leave you
I love your content but with your situation simply getting bigger was probably not the reason.
Friends ah friends if I even had some
"IF YOU GET ANY BIGGER I'LL LEAVE YOU" We do not care
I have a girlfriend and I'm not into men. But i would date this man any day. You're so nice Joel. (Maybe i just have daddy issues sorry)
Bruh more muscle bigger hugs tf
Those ✌️ sign hide all the muscle😂
Bro just maked baki the grappler in real life
THE WAY HE DID THE GIRL VOICE WITH THOSE MUSLE LOL
Jokes on you, I don’t have friends 😂
He had the guts to reject "Mommy Noel" 😮
Bro just said “Charge it biatch i’m gone.” and just *vanished out the door,gym bag in hand* 🗿
Not necessarily likeminded, but supporting and correcting when you do wrong is whats essential.
Real question,  can you get bigger then your current body state and by how much would you want to if you can? I mean you seem about as big as a human body can legitly be
That mindset never made sense to me. Its fun supporting gym friends when they have goals
Ive been in a deficit and started running 3x week. Now I've added weights 3x week.  I will be focusing more weights the colder it gets. 💪 all my husband wants is for me to not lose my butt 😂
What dose it mean like get buff or fat
Bro left like his that 💀💀💀
I got the same pre work out 💪
Why leave you ??? 😅
What's the music?
Bro why would that be an issue!!! 😂😂😂 the bigger the better 😁 big muscle!!!
Cara, seus vídeos são sensacionais.
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
Bet
Bro left faster then my dad ☠️
Girl told me This too but I didn’t listen no wonder she got split In half
Show you my friends ok? 🫥
You're such an Angel. Thank you for everything. ❤
That was All u had to say say bet
Sigma male detected 😂
Bro is the gentle giant
Not everyone likes freakishly big steroid users I guess 😂 your body at the end of the day !
All daddy noel needs is protein
To be fair, getting that big isn’t healthy.
Hi
If somebody likes you for who you are they stay no matter what. Gain muscle, gain weight, lose weight, whatever the case may be. If they don't wanna be with you if your physical appearance changes, it's best to lose them!
Like father like son 💀💀💀
The only disagreement here is the part about likeminded. They don't have to share your ideas to support and respect you and your choices
Cannot imagine him to be small 😂😂😂
Problem: there are no likeminded people for me 😅
Me who have no friends 🙂
song name
Like father like son
i have no friend that interest in gymning,and ill do myself. Getting strong is my goal
CHAD
Daddy, have you seen a natural person your size?  Love from Dominican republic!!❤
“If she won’t tolerate you out of the sheets then you my friend have got yourself a girl for the streets”                    -Me rn
If she says that, I'll leave in a second
this is actually the reason that noel is gay, so he can date bro's who dont tell him to get smaller
Id say same thing. well..bye
I can't stop thinking of the reading your calories in the food video on the part of milk😭
Hello
how to correctly use preworkout, how long does it last etc
I don't have any friends 🫤
If you were my bf, no problem on my side if you wanna get bigger😂
And what if I don't have any friends?
Dad went to get the mil...  Pre-work out
Bruh she is as big as him like wtf wym y'all the same size just grow with him like fr
Yeah my ex was like this 👎🏻
Dead 💀
What if your family doesn't support you? 😢
You age ?
I am just impressed he can get his voice that high.
I have no friends 🥸
In her defense, Daddy Noel probably wrecking her privates, she is just scared
The sentence "Do you promise" Have you forgotten about me
I’ve got no friends.
My friends don’t really include me in things, it’s almost always been a one sided friendship for me.
Noel, how do i get like minded friends?
Noel u need to lean
He didn't just walk out. He popped out of existence. Comic gold.
Blud dissappeired like my father
I wouldn’t leave you ❤😊
To be fair though Noel is absolutely massive. If some girls find it to be a turn off it’s just a preference thing
Not if I do it first
Honestly my friends are really negative all the time and keep trying to push me down, I can’t really find ways to avoid them since they follow me everywhere. I’m really depressed honestly and not because of them but because of life in general, don’t feel like living.
it not right at all you never see my comments😔 NOEL.
If you DONT get any bigger, I'll leave you
Jesus loves you
So, if I don’t have friends, I don’t have a future? 🙁 damn
maybe she didn't mean "big" as in body size... 😉
Isn't you g@y?
No Friends .....
Honestly, i really dont wanna get *TOO* big like you Deyzel, but just a nice sixpacked figure would fit for me
than leave to beach ass mother father
Now I know he’s truly my dad 💀💀
"start packing!"
I could never.... how.....like.... why would they miss out on.....huuuuuhhhhh!?
bro left faster than my dad
Heck, I don't blame her!  Just because he's mostly muscle doesn't mean he is isn't heavy as hell. Who wants all that weight laying on top of them 😂.  Women are allowed to have a physique preference just like men express every chance they get. I don't like big bulky men.
“If you get any bigger, I’ll leave you!” Already left 🍷🗿
Don't worry I can be your new girlfriend
starts snorting protein powder
İf my gf say this i would’ve start my first cycle and get twice as big as before💉
How much bigger you gonna get bro.. don't explode
Bro grabbed his drink, packed his bags, and became my father
so, i have no future?
Everyone would like a friend like daddy noel ❤
Gf: Stop taking such high doses of roids, eating this much food, gaining so much unnatural weight. It can't be healthy.   Him: I can't handle this negativity.
I love you
Don’t you hate it when you get confronted by your dishrag double and he tells you he’ll leave you if you get any bigger?
Wait, ain’t you gay? I thought I saw you say that.  Not doubting, just wondering
That's a really nice gym bag where can I get one
Adolf H: gotchu fam
I have no friends so I have no future 😐
WHAT! I would LOVE someone who is bigger than me and that aspires to get big.
This is tough. a lot of women wouldnt be cool dating a steriod user, to be completely fair to the other side. Not to disrespect Noel's decisions about his own body.
Gym dad 😅
Mommy noel
What if my friends are crips , will i become as successful as snoop dogg ?
Bro left his girl before the girl even left him. True sigma 💪😼
Bro went to get the protein
How big did she want you to be?
In that form, you can get bigger Dad?  Wow ...
"If you get any bigger i will leave you"  *Becomes the Incredible Hulk
Girl- if you get any bigger I'll leave you Me- (injects 5000iu of GH immediately)
God is king he loves all if you woke up today it’s because god has a plan for you amen 🙏
Blud really said “fuck it then”
Ok, so I just need to change my parents, got it. P.S. They broke their promise and now they don't even let me go to yhe gym.
"You're the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with" - Wise and intelligent men of the world... (heard it from Andrew Tate btw)
What if I don't have any friends?
he said "fine i'll do it myself"
I mean it's understandable why she wants to leave💀
What if u don’t have friends tho?
The guy who told him that is missing out rn
I would say surround yourself with good people that want to make you better. Not necessarily likeminded people, I would say that’s just as dangerous as unsupportive people.
How tall are you
This has  "But Tien, the doctor said if your shoulders get any bigger-" "That's why we don't see him anymore" energy lol
It’s just someone type don’t get mad
Nothing wrong with getting bigger and stronger you’re improving yourself in strength and health
Isn’t Noel gay? Or maybe bi/pan/no label man liker?
his honest reaction:
I mean let's be honest, you are the more extreme side of  body building even if you are humble about it. I can understand the concern (especially with all the health complications the hobby can create)...
Final Fantasy?
I ain't laughing. This actually does happen...
Bro, he is LITERALLY too buff for a girl 😂
Women 🗿☕️
I don't think she was talking about Daddy Noel's body to be honest.
So was she afraid that you would stand out too much?  Smells like insecurity.
I took “If you get any bigger I’ll leave you” the whole wrong way 💀💀💀
Smash
I agree but there is a limit with how like minded they get before its just yes men
If a woman can’t except me for working out she can walk on back to her ex
I am friends with John Cena
My soon-to-be husband always wanted to be good at singing but struggled with hitting correct notes. Once he heard my voice he almost gave up on learning, but I didn't let him. Instead, I offered to help him to learn to sing, and how to draw better and more.  Dont be a dick. Don't hog talents. Teach instead.
I love you noel but "surround yourself with likeminded people" is the most obvious recipe for disaster.
Daddy Noel said later ✌️
Wait a minute..  What happens if I have NO friends? 😢
I mean maybe you should listen bro, what’s the goal here, competing with SUV’s?
Bro was like: "u wont, imma leave u for not letting me chase my goal, peace"
Imagine that ex watching this 💀💀💀
I mean isn't Daddy Noel gay so a guy did this to him? 😳
If I have no friends, does that mean I have no fut… ☠️
when he was preparing his drink i heard a sussus amogus sound😳
Soo does that mean the cute babe at the start there is single now? 👀
"if you get any bigger i leave you" *didnt you said you like big ones?*
Noel should really attend a body building competition 🔥
Bro is already the hulk
I had that happen befpre she said if my chest gpt any bigger she was gone....she gone lol😊
Day one of saying this man is a gigachad
I’ve never thought extra muscular men were attractive but i tell you this man is such a cutie ☺️ for me it must be the sense of humor that attracts me . I really enjoy watching him and learning from him especially since I’ve just started my fitness journey. Handsome man😊
So i have no friends… meaning I have no future 🥹
That line is insane. But preferences are still that, preferences. My mom's all like "I don't like em big." So Dad just stopped. Which to me sounds like good communication. "If you keep doing what you enjoy, I'll leave you." on the other hand is just stupid.
Ik stay even closer if you get even bigger daddy Noel
The guy with no friends ☠️
I really appreciate how wholesome you and your videos are man please keep it up
Suffering from success
Happened to me
He immediately saw the red flag, and got tf out there, respect. Actual respect, not the "he did a flip" respect
Today's trend: show me your phone i will show your future
One of the key tips in life is to make sure you have good friends - quality over quantity.
I got no friends I got no future baby keep her ahahaha
That's why I have no friends; Friends disappoint me one way or another.   That's why I look for Family.
a 5"4 miget that is never mature around me a guy that watches porn and shits himself a 7 year old a bisexual
Daddy Noel just told us to surround ourselves with an echo chamber of yes-men...
If my mrs threatened/promised me that then I’d get on the juice asap!
Best start ever
Went to get the protein shake-
That's my secret, I don't have any friend
Love this dude, but it was probably:   Partner: Steroids are affecting our sex life, and I'm worried about your long-term organ health.   Him: ✌🏻
What
What if you stay alone all the time?
Does anyone know if he’s single?
Bro really said “I like it big”
He means his gay partner
Not all men have ever objected to a big woman, why should a woman have a problem with muscular blokes, Noel you did the right thing you left her. Big men equates big boys turning into big men.  My son is 6ft and 2 ft wide,I am 5"9 and 1.5 ft wide; how was that possible, my wife is proud of him, but I always butt in and say " The boy is like his Dad"
😂😂😂
Tell us the story about how and when It happens to you
Remember: when you’re so big, you have to like girls even bigger. Moto Moto is my spirit animal
Pov:all my friends are toxic 😂 So u have no friends 😂😂😂 I need friends
Me personally I like em big
Bro went to get the gym
I have no friends.. does that mean I have no future..
My goal in life is to marry a bro who has the issue of getting to massive. But at this rate Ill die alone.
That face he made with victory sign- cute and funny at the same time.
Body dysmorphia is real, find someone to support you transitioning to a bigger you, if that’s what you want.
I have No friends, so I'll have no future 😂😂
The girl that left Noel is an idiot for sure.   I mean even us boys thrist over Noel.
surrounding yourself with only likeminded people is never healthy. It’s good to have somebody to challenge your ideas and making you think a different way instead of just thinking one way and agreeing or having people agree with you all the time
I don’t mind if he will get bigger. I mean if he happy I’m happy too 🥰
Or: Don't lose any more weight... you will look _____"  (ill/ugly/older)
Precisely!
If my partner is going to use steroids to get bigger. I would also leave lol 😂. Peeps of steroids r abusive many times.
I have no future.
How do I gain weight when i have a high metabolism
Stop 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂
"alright, bet"
Noel returns as a 9'8 monster who weighs 700 pounds💀
"I miss the part where that's my problem"
sorry babe, I can't make any promises 😔   (enter gym for new pr)
"Show me youre friends" mhmm failing at step one here. 😂
He was like: Double it and give it to the next person
What if you don't have any friends!
Never stay with someone that doesn’t love you for who you are.
why would somebody even say that? I dont get it
yes
true, because of that i dont have friends anymore. im waiting for the right friends...
Sheeeeeesh
Le me chilling with almost 0 friends 😌😌
Goated
Sike I'll leave you
Hello Everyone I'm here to remind you that God loves you and it is written in John 3:16 which states that "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that who shall ever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life" Jesus died for our sins and He wants you to accept that free gift,He saved you because he doesn't want you to go to hell because of our sins and he is the only way through Heaven." I am the Way,The Truth, And the life and no one comes to my Father in heaven except through me John 14:6" Accept him for tomorrow is not promised.
A pun no one can lift you
Noel is bi? Love it
That’s awful. What an ungrateful bi**** . I’m 5’9 and always struggling to find a guy whose taller and bigger than me physically so he looks good next to me. Nothing wrong with Short guys or skinny guys but I don’t wanna look like the bigger one in the couple. I want a guy who can lift me and hold me and hug me like a bear 🥲💖
If you don't get bigger I'm leaving you 🤨
"If you get any bigger I'll leave" Him: honey I'm going for milk
"If you get any bigger i'll leave you" "Let me get the door for you. Mind the step won't you. Best of luck." 😂
That's exactly my reaction. Any woman says 'do this or i'll do this crappy thing to you' i will A-Continue to live how i want to in the way i choose, and B-get rid of the threatening nutcase. 😂
So calm respect man❤
If they don’t support your body goals, they’re not the one. End of story.
Huh.....  Then I guess I don't have any future
just like when my dad left me
And that's probably happening to me, but I'm losing weight first and doesn't seem to get my support
he looks like drax from guardians of the galaxy
"show me a friend" *Whats a friend?*
True, but remember, good friends are the ones who support you, but try to advice/stop you when you're doing something stupid.
Bro took "you wont if i do it first" to a whole new level.
I'll like you Noel. You are good
Two of my exes told me they wouldn't like it if their gf was visibly strong. I was depressed-ish and unmotivated at the time and we broke up before I could make significant progress but thinking about their "kind words" motivates me everyday ☺️🙏
Instantly without thinking 2 times, if it's a noel video it deserves a like
It's understandable that someone who chose to be in a relationship with someone prefers them the way they look at that point. I know plenty of guys and girls who would leave their partner if they gained weight, lost a leg, or their looks faded. Lesson is don't expect someone who chose you because of your looks to stay with you when these looks change. If you want someone who will accept you for who you are and not what you look like, then be that person.
ill never leave you Daddy noel
Song??😂
He reminds me a bit of Tom Hardy
Now even daddy noel went to get the milk😭😭😭😭
but fr tho the huge muscles looks wierd and catches too much attention
Meanwhile me: “Youre great as you are baby, but if you want to get bigger lets do this! Lets get you larger! Oh wait, you wanted some more protein shakes?” Support circles matter!
I disgust bulk people
Ngl i don't want to be big i want to be big enough then start boxing or kick boxing
That sort of comment always makes me grind even harder. 😂
Snnddj
"thank you so much babyyy. I've been trying to find an exucse to workout on my rest days. haha." * finger guns *
I don’t know why, but that compilation of him getting ready was satisfying
Wow her wig was stunning.
I’ll never leave you daddy Noel! 😏
Isn't she as big as him?
Il be worse if she say get bigger now or i would leave you as a skinny guy like me
Don't worry "honey"  *Grips protein shake firmly*
I have no friends tell me my future
Lol 😂 it’s the if you get any thinner I will leave you because I like big chest and thin body 😂 and guess what I lost lot of weight after that and I was finally free like 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That ✌ was super cute 😶
… peace out ✌️
Does no friends = no future?
What’s the song boys?
Maybe she's fed up  sleeping on the edge of the bed.😂
I was skinny as hell when i was with my ex, now i'm twice the size, she would run a mile today.
No man, not that kind of big
No better pre-workout than heartbreak 😅
we need to get noel a muscle mommy (particurally paryss???? unless she has a boyfriend 😔)
Song name?
Tell me what you eat and I tell you what you are...
she's got a point there, you have to think about other parts also 🤣🤣
As long as it’s not your heart getting bigger 😅
Man f this logic if she is not supportive see is not the right one
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future" Me with no friends: 🫥
What song is that in the background
Bro's wife is buff af
"happened to me one"- I bet it was a south african haha. Love Noel
Bro left faster than my dad..😭
That was rude 🥲🥲🥲
Okay but why would someone want to be built like a balloon just to make life harder ??
bro turned from a body builder to a man telling wisdom
I don't have any friends..................Ahhhh😑
the bigger the better... imagine getting hugged by that body
I think she did that cuz body builders are known for having a very small dick💀💀
Bro left faster than my dad 💀
Idk about that but I dated a guy who couldnt even scratch his own back and I just don't see the point of it all. This has to be some body dysmorphia of you push yourself into a disability.
"surround yourself with likeminded people" is another way of saying don't take any criticism from anyone and surround yourself with a bunch of yes men
If you get any bigger, we'll need to buy a bigger bed. I don't see a problem.
I don't have any friends..... Well that means either:- 1- I don't have any future or 2- I can create my own future
Actually I got a fat friend who doesn't want to do workout with me.who always asks me "why are you working out it's not going to help you"
My asian mom:
Why do you even care about getting bigger. Most females hate bodies like that in a relationship, they like actual usable bodies, not that for show garbage
Where's the quick police siren at the end
Bro didn't pack his bags he packed his protein
Almost as fast as my dad
Happened to me as well. I just questioned the whole basis of relationship when she asked that
Dude disappeared faster than my dad
She: If U get any bigger i leave U He :  my dad Mode aktivated
My bestfriend always tells me "if I see you get buff ill act like I don't know you at school" im a 16 year old female and I want to build my body. And she's the reason I am motivated. She always tells me what kind of wrong things I'm doing and I fix them. She SOMETIMES comments negatively about my goals and plans and i get even more motivated. Because I know that she's just joking around ( she actually is lmao )
R u on steroids(just a question)
When he put in the bag it sounded like the imposter killing someone
No gains. No GF
One of the first things i told my girlfriend. Give me an ultimatum and ill never pick you
"If you get any bigger ill leave you" - "alright, cya"
No one should tell anyone how their body should be (unless youre a doctor) just be healthy and look how you want to look, my biggest thing with weight lost was that i wanted to be skinny but when it wasnt working the way i wanted it to i traded being healthy yeah i got a bit of fat on me but im at a healthy weight for my height, i got good blood pressure and im happier. People will call you fat tell you to be leaner, stronger, taller, shorter, whatever just be you, but healthy stay healthy be on this earth long enough to enjoy being happy😊😊
ngl being TOO big is surely not attractive, i'd never choose one of those bodybuiders that look like they're high on steroids all the time. someone ur size is fine, a little bog but still good
Not likeminded people, echochambers are scary and very harmful, but yes, surround yourself with people who support you
Noel I just got that pre workout it tastes great
As long as youre healthy and safe, not hurting anyone else you get those gains
Bro my best friend got a surgery last😢
Oh they're just jealous
Stay sigma kings, not ligma
It's all about preference. But, do what is right and be happy.
no friends 👍
The grind is my main. You're just on the side.
I would never say that to you 😉🤣
I guess a have no future
Does anybody know the name of the song?
I mean she didn't leave, because he did first 😂
This has never happened to me but I could relate tho
I also do what people tell me not to do😂
You forget the dose of roids
😂😂😂
Dude beeing strong and have muscels is good but you have to much and at some point is geting ugly, is just not so attractiv
I love your videos of yourself😂
Noel - you're one of the best person in the world! We all love you. And we cannot say like about Tate or somebody else - "top G". You're above it 😊❤
What about those who actually support you but most of the time are sick?
🧍🏻‍♀️: If you get any bigger I’ll leave you!” ✅ 🧍🏻‍♂️: “If you get any bigger I’ll leave you!” ❌
Have no friends. No future
My guy. You huge. 💪🏼💪🏼
That’s the body I want but I’m 6 2 and weigh 150 pounds | u could call me a stick.
Him:- Show me your friends I'll show your future  Me (having no friends):- So I don't have any future ? 😢
So does no friends means no future 😢
"If you get any bigger im gonna leave you" *Immediately goes to the gym faster than my dad getting milk*
She was probably worried about your health, Noel
Maybe she meant down there 😂
She left me, then I got bigger!
your best friend is the one who calls you at 7am to go running
Friends?
This story feels like he left out a lot. It was probably more like: "If you keep increasing the amount of PEDs you are taking I'll leave you"
Man was gonna get milk even before the kids.
Yeah but there’s something between looking athletic and buff and looking like 99% muscle. I’d honestly hate to be too muscular.
My friends like if you dont get any bigger i will leave you
He just left faster than my dad left me…
My man's turned into John cena
Just curious, where are you from mate?
Bigger the body or bigger the pack of steroids ?
Bro that girl was voice was so funny 😂😂😂😂
Daddy, what if I don't have no friends?
You natty??
That's what my girlfriend said once, well now it's my ex for obvious reasons 👌🏻💯
This guy needs a Grammy for his acting
I recently got out of a toxic relationship and it's funny because she would always tell me to not workout because she "liked the way I was" but then she went on to find someone else who was "more active" 😂 ☠️ Fuck that shit focus on yourself and be better for yourself 🦍
U r a gym bro
Love you man
Nah mate, you gotta pack her bags
So sexy big hunk guy
Hey, that’s a real dick move from the girl. There’s a stigma about muscly guys, sometimes they are true, but just on your vids you seem so wholesome, and they really bring a smile to my face. The fact that I girl left you because you were getting bigger, as part of your journey on staying healthy (and getting maximum shopping bag carrying skills) is pretty pathetic. Keep up the good work king!
I've no friends 🙃
But I don't have friends
But also keep it balanced don’t be friends with someone who agrees with you on every single thing in the world you don’t want to be in an echo chamber
Why would the girl even say that
"Show me your friends, and ill show you your future"  Ha! Then you will never be able to see my future.
Wadda faq  You guys have experienced a lot of abusive control behavior. Damn I wish I was there to protect you
If it makes any difference,  my pepe still be the same babes.....
I'm saddened because I was told by my fiance that she'd be scared of me if I got super big . And said she wouldn't like that. She even said that she wouldn't like me shaving my head anymore cause I look like a convict. It's all be super stressful and I've gained alot of belly fat so now I'm skinny fat trying to teach myself to cook cause everyone in the house has been eating out and suddenly stopped cooking every night. I am very stressed this month.
Noel is a gigachad in every aspect
J
I do nothing but harm other people which is why I must be as social as possible
Except it was show me your emotions and I’ll leave you. Peace ✌️
If daddy is getting girls like these....what hope do we have.
Yet maybe only take that into mind when you are at the gym... people with problematically radical political orientations should probably rather not all hurdle up to find validation in their opinions and thus build up a filter bubble. Far right and far left likewise....
Bro left faster than my dad
Women: I want a fit and strong guy Also women: you’re too muscular  ☕️.
I'm sorry but for some reason i  can't comprehend that you are human and you exist on the same planet as everyone else
LOL, mixed his shake before he left, because even if he's moving, he's not going without his muscle syntheser   *Definitely* a "double-scoop" kind of situation (buy yourself a few more hours to find a place without withering)
"Get any bigger and I'll leave you"?  Lol, get any smaller (minded) and I'll leave you xD
Mf did a naruto disapereance
me: thanks I could use the motivation
Song?
I keep changing my future💀
Won't have any complaint if it's the lower part.
Ain't no way bro spawned himself away after getting the 🥛😂💀
To be fair, if it’s growth caused by steroids, I could see this being valid. IMO it would be like telling a woman you would leave her if you she gets another lip injection or something. Maybe it matches a standard of beauty they appreciate, but it is unnatural and might get in the way of you getting to appreciate them as they are.
Ive got three friends to show, long johnny and the twins
my dad:
My current gf doesn’t like the idea of me getting shredded, I told her I wanted to possibly be a body builder and she said and I quote “please for the love of god don’t be a body builder, I’ll let you get as fit as you want but not that” and honestly I’m still gonna try doing it my way
In father's steps
I hate when bodybuilders spill their supplement powder .. I always try to slowly add scoops to not lose any.
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future" But I don't have any friends Wai-

Don’t only surround yourself with likeminded people, they can be nice but sometimes you need that friend who can pat you in the shoulder look you in the eyes and call you an idiot when you need it
Brainwash topical from internet to big of of a body isn't good for your blood circulation too much muscle mass isnt good where intended as men to be slightly built lean and agile as men not this big this is not "health" stop listening to the internet there lying left and right
I’ll never leave you even tho it means my parents disowning me ❤❤❤❤
Legend has it that he never returned
That was actually body dysmorphia under the towel syke theyre married now!
These type of bs comments always motivate me even more than anything else. Sure go ahead and leave me then I'd say
This is how you know your getting big
When you go to buy milk 😂
Jokes on you I’m leaving first
Didn’t have quite that but I did recently get dumped because I started going to the gym and though she never said a word to me about it when she packed her shit and left she said it’s because all I ever did was go to the gym. I was never gone for more than about an hour. At least now I can focus on my training and my training alone.
Yeah that’s why I have no future !! Lol
If you get any bigger I’ll marry you lol
Funny but true
If anyone threatens to leave you for who you are they are the ones not worth staying with :)
wow i can't believe someone would say that to you, what a BISH lolbody shaming much
I wonder if zyzz's girlfriend told him to get off roids
Imagine being big enough to hear that, goals
Yknow, I don't think girls really mean it literally 😂 but I think being obsessed w the gym can definitely be a sign of insecurity, and if your gf really likes you they don't want you to feel insecure and will tell you things like you don't have to keep going to the gym to be attractive 🙂 or maybe they're scared of you attracting other girls idk😂
Get bigger kings. I'll be proud of you
Not if I do first
ye thouse girls likes fat man lazy ones who just dont have future NO THATS NOT OK
Excuse me please someone tell what is best gym schedule for woman's 😅
Show me your friends  And i tell you who you are
I would never say that
4000th comment.🎉
No friends ,no future?🤠
Pretty sure his next gf is under 4'11
Is this why we never see a Mommy Noelle 😔
the word you said at the end sounded similiar
The problem is finding the likeminded friends.
I have no friends....does that mean I have no future 😢
I'm a lifter myself....6'1 and 110kg...but I admit that sometimes being much bigger just looks stupid
Ok but noel your just crazy big 😂
Mine was: if you get any skinner I dont know if i can love you.   So i did the rational thing and become hyper lean
I don't have any
If I have no friends will I have no future?
Man this happened to me, she said that I spend all my time working out that she wants me to spend time to her, BUT HECKS NAH I AIN'T SKIPPING LEGS FOR YOU!
No friends. No future.
Uhhh i dont have friends
Ida flipped out too
Bro only took the essentials
Double it and give it to the next
One: are we ignoring his girlfriend evidently wore bonnets   Two: are we ignoring the fact he's wearing/owns a bonnet  Three: are we ignoring the fact that he gets Metal Gear Solid references
Noel instant transmissioned right out of there. 😂
Women☕️   Note: this is not for all women, some are gold and some are bold, pick the gold and you shall be trolled…. Damn i just made that up lol i gatta go to bed what am i doin🤣
I don't have friends, I think I don't have a future
yeh the father of 2, thats juicing the F out, choking on gainer, doing powerlift, not profiting any $ from that.  sometimes its the otherway around
I mean a woman can only handle so much man don’t break her lol .
idk maybe reasonable because you use steroids
The ultimatum is alwaystoxic. Its okay to have preferences but if you love someone, their body changing wont make you lose love for them even if you find them less attractive. And if so sometimes honesty is actually not the best policy, and its probably healthier to find some other way to express your desires or end the relationship
I want my Wife to be very muscular so this should not be a problem for me
I mean maybe she just wanted you to stop taking steroids
He's absolutely right but I also hate that we're having this conversation yet people STILL believe that big and bulky is what women want. No, it's what men want.
Don't fall for this.
My girl says "I don't want you to get big. You already take up too much bed"😅
i don't have any friends..which means i don't have any future...oh shit
real, a year ago i was sureounded with a bunch of fucking losers that were hating on me, i eventually cut them off and made sum lasting friends
That partner was missing out more beef = better cuddles
What’s the song??
i thought girls liked when you get big😏
Song name tho?
i think all the gfs tell this phrase constantly if their bfs wants to go gym or get heavier in the gym. the phrase "you are ok with the excercise you actually do, you dont need to do more" is popular too. to all women, please, if you think we will be more atractive to other woman, just dont blame to us for being fitness, instead of that make efforts to look prettier yourselves 🥰
If my family says this what should I do?😢
Gf: If you get any bigger I'll leave You Daddy: proceed to transform himself into a walking mountain
If you cant become more bigger we will leave you .❤
Noel be like : "Look at me I am a big boy" 😂
He left her now he is with men 🥰🤤
What if she was just worried for you because you use drugs?
Daddy noel becoming a real dad
Well said💯🙏
idk how much bigger you want to get bro, you are literally at the max
I can relate to this. Before I met my girlfriend I was always at the gym, we got together and covid hit. She has always said I should get back to the gym and a few weeks ago I stared back. Ever since she has done nothing but complain. That 6 hours a week i spend at the gym could be spent with her......
Noel: You thought 300lb was the end goal? Im pushing for a lean 500lb I'm making hulk gains.
PEACE, BIH‼️
Oh my god. Why would anybody say something like this to anyone...  You are so inspiring.
Nowadays it's hard to find diamonds but finding real friends is "harder"
No friends = no future?
This actually happened to me aswell. At the time I was REALLY into this girl. Ended up losing all my gains and she left me 😢
You can get as big as you want … still look good !
Glad you dodged a bullet. But that gf of yours looked hella fine.
Imma get super huge bra
What friends?
Maybe she was more worried about the steroids?
Me: no friends  So long future
What the phuck is wrong with women nowadays, seriously if they can’t be happy with his body whats the actual point
What the phuck is wrong with women nowadays, seriously if they can’t be happy with his body whats the actual point
If you get bigger I’ll leave you   *No* 🗿
Time to go on a bulk
I have no friends…
My only friend is my home gym, my only comfort, the gains made upon that alter. 💪 welcome to the church of Iron.
GF: I don't care how you look! I'm just happy the way you are!!  Bros what should I do? Should I leave her?
Music?
Daddy neol vanished
I always keep a super negative but respectfull friend near just so i can get his opinion and usually ignore it.
Show me your friends. Me: Error 404 💀
Boss playing mgs
Hehe i got motivation and i got gym friends problem is i also got shoulder pain problems 😭
This happened to me  I cheated on her because I love gym
I guess it can be scary in a way to have such a huge lad dating you. But if you're scared you can't go to the Forrest am I right
Damn.. He Pulled the "Looks like we don´t  have any milk left" Trick
✌️
Except it wasn’t a woman.
Or maybe she was concerned about your heart & overall health on steroids...🙄🤦‍♀️  if you say to a skinny person they are skinny enough so they shouldn't starve themselves to death, tell me guys is this body shaming or care?? Body dismorphia is hidden most of the time and complex & you are the ones that support it!!  And don't start with the bullshit of " supplements" doesn't make you any harm..bro, even the simple whey protein has done so much harm on my stomach and bile💀 recently my neighbour had a heart attack at the gym💀
Bye 304. Welcome passport bro life.
😂😂😂 I love it omggg. If I were I guy I’d do the same thing
😂😂😂😂😂
Just found out she cheated yesterday, two years and probably a thousand dollars in her. Planning on gym tho
I get her though.
I don't have any problem with this tbh. Just as I would leave my girl if she let herself get so big I lose all attraction to her, and refuses to lose weight, I can see how a girl would leave a guy if he gets too big and she's no longer attracted to his physique, and he refuses to stop  So yeah noone is the bad guy really. It just means you're no longer compatible
Plot Twist : she was worried about his steroid addiction 😳
I have this itching feeling that this happened when Noel was a third of what he is now.
I have no friends 😢
Dude I can't  imagine, that how will you look when you get more bigger. You are already in crossed hulk form. But excited for it. 💪🏿💪🏿
But you’re gay bro
Bro it's funny how he's a buff huge guy pretending to be a girl 😂
go pump
Happens to me cause I'm not a dude and they think it's bad that I'm trying to get shredded lol. Love your content
Who needs friends
My ex hated me going to the gym all the time
Sorry but how a girl can take your strong heavy muscle body, they are tiny soft and small 😅
The metal gear solid sound so funny
Hahahahaahha
What if I don’t have friends?
Female psychology expert here. Don't worry guys, if your girl ever say such nonsense like that "if you get bigger i leave you, if you buy another car i leave you" that's just a shit-test, she wants you to say No, she wants you to be dominant and stay in your Man frame, if you submit to her and obey her she will leave 100%, why she does that?  That's a hard wired anti slut defense,   girls aren't logical at all they are emotional, don't try to logic with them because that's very wrong, instead talk their emotions girls are submissive they are never leaders, unless you are femenine and she's a lesbian
Jokes in you, I dont have any Friends.
"sure babe! imma go to the gym for a while
My friends are the type of ppl to say damn das crazy and move on with their day even in super serious situations like suicide i get and understand being online or spending time with your friends means you already have as much problems as it is so why bring to the table but i digress     So whats my future?
Noel casually dropping the best content with wholesome advices and great cooking recipes. Father Noel is truly something special.
“if you get any bigger ill leave you” him: say less
Bro went: 🍷🗿
So I have no future?!?!

I don’t have any friends now what’s my future broooo
Brother left faster than my dad
Him: show me your friends, and I'll show your future Me who doesn't have friends: uh about that!
Bro turned to My dad
You cant show me my future because I dont have any friends
Her loss.
i have no friends.   does this mean i have no future?
What kind of wench would leave daddy noel
Is that Mommy Noel I see💀
Similar thing happened to me, I used to have an ED which meant I was severely underweight, at first my partner was supportive of it but when I began building muscle he was suddenly really pissed because he struggled with building muscle, I was barely 50kg so I wasn't really that muscular, o was just healthy. Depending if your building muscle, gaining fat or losing weight if someone isn't going to supportive of your journey ditch them, but if you gaining or losing weight be careful to not mix concerns with if what your doing is healthy and people who are just not supportive
What if it’s your family 😳
i wanna start going to the gym and building muscle, and most people around me are like "ew thats not feminine, that looks bad on woman" like shut up im doing it for myself💀
Influencers after putting a towel on their heads: "I've achieved feminine"
😂
I’m happy my close friend group are super supportive
My boy said deuces✌🏽😂
Interesting, I always thought women wanted guys to be an inch or two larger.
Noel did what my dad did
bro left faster than mine dad 💀
Sounds just as toxic as the one who said you had small calves.
Noel you look perfect
woman ☕️
Bro she was probably depressed after that cuz DAM she’s missing out
"I don't have friends,  I have family"  -Dominic Toretto
Don't forget to mention "but it's not good to involve yourself in an echo chamber"
Maybe she just worry that getting any bigger might harm you. Sometimes being in like minded people can be toxic. You don't know you getting good feedback or getting cope feedback.
noel went full american dad mode
One of my exes told me the same thing. I told her to GTFO since she was getting fat. That night I slept like a baby 👍
That's sucks man
No friends No future?
My gf said if I even get a six pack shell leave me I'm really clsoe idk what will happen
The problem is some of those people are my family.
Aim strength over size
Is Noel natural? No hate I dont know too much about natty or not but he is literally as big as a bodybuilder but he a legend
Show me ur friends Me: here u go Noel: there is no one  Me: exactly
This what this girl I was sort of dating said to me. Now I’m at my then weight goal and still skinny. Thanks daddy Noel
Get bigger, and we'll both feel what heaven feels like in a moment..
DADDY NOELLL! Train me, 😭 please
If you dont get any bigger, I’ll leave you! (Takes pants off)
How toxic do you have to be to leave someone because they're improving themselves?
Bro done dematerialized
😂 happened to me too
Not if he leaves you first
Heehee the piece sign at the end ⚰️
Imagine if roles were reversed 💀
'' If u get any bigger, i'll leave you! '' Me: let's see if u can leave me once i get even bigger
LMAOOOO
Who tf get mad about their boyfriend’s gains? Be glad you even have a bf! 😂😢
What if I got no friends
Glad you left her.
No hate daddy but you are already too big im genuinely worried how much peds you use 😭
Bruh that’s called an echo chamber
Show me your friends will show you your future.  My friends: 💂🧑‍🍳🧑‍🔧🥷🦸🧙🕴️🦍🪖🏋️🪂🤺🏂👮
It's show me your friends and Il tell you your future, first time I ever heard this was from. A friends dad about 15 years ago.
Depending on what she means by that  If she meant being fat and out of shape, then yeah she's got a point  If she's talking about strength and muscle mass then it sounds like she wants someone that she can control
All complexes and insecurities  aside. There is a thing called '' too much''
Ha ha… women ☕️
“Show me your friends and I’ll show you your future”   So no future?
My friends fr be like: YES GET THEM GAINS FINALLY
Someone plays mgs!
Well, not everyone you talk to should be like minded
If she leaves you for another,you shall go for her mother
MAJOR L girl
i was in a relationship that lasted two years. that was the thing i heard when started going to the gym. broke up with her, moved on and so now i've found another gf who supports me on my will. don't let your girlfriend manipulate you, live your life the way you want to live it.
You do want to get bigger?
No need for pre-workout when she says that
Will you be my friend?
Bro Go get the milk
I'LL SAY, WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?
The bigorexia is real.
My friends consists of enlisted mfs in Marine Corps.
If anyone says something like that to you about anything that isn't destructive, that's a big yikes, big red flag.
any manipulations are bad
that was my girlfriend she's my ex now 💀
Comment section don't have girlfriends.. If she says I'm starting to get too big, I listen, maybe she is right, they don't like extra muscular guys.
Sigma
I don’t have any friends what’s my future
Dang what’s the song 😎
Thats why i married my fysio   and still am 20years later 5 kids and still goin strong💪
What's her @?
Man used a quote from the bible
I told my last girlfriend that I was interested in becoming a helicopter pilot. She said if I did that she wouldn’t be with me, because she was expecting me to become this heroic firefighter that I was working hard at pursuing (extremely competitive) but it wasn’t really for me. No longer with her as it was not a happy relationship.  Anyways, finished flight school last August, now a licensed heli pilot.
Surround yourself with people who won't call you out on your steroid drug addiction i guess
my father after I hop into my car
Happy Women is a myth #lol
😅😂😂😂😂
So one of my freind is fat and has a girlfriend and I was concerned no hate for him ok
😂😂😂😂
You should have put the naniii, *laser sound* once with the realisation one
Daddy Noel disappeared just like my dad
My goals: take over Europe
If you take any more Tren I’ll leave you
If she was looking for small she probably shouldn’t have gone after Daddy Noel
Her: Please stop taking steroids. it's bad for you. What he hears:
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you" *Finally*
well she probably didnt support ped usage and cared for your health. ( i can be wrong tho) not trying to hate
i wouldn't agree with surrounding yourself with like minded people, but i definitely agree that you should ignore what others think of you and pursue your goals.
umm...i agree with most of his content but there is a healthy limit. No one else in the comments seem to have a similar view though...
She said I am getting bigger🗿
My wife asks me to go to gym and get healthy and love myself but i would give everything to her for loving me and being with me
Jokes on you I don’t have any friends
Bros: hey bro why your muscles small, get bigger
You should create a new channel where you share your thoughts about people during their ups and downs. You are doing a good job here also

What if I have no friends!?
i agree with this but also try not to be around a lot of yes men as well because it will give you a distorted reality of life
I love this guy!
its hard to find like-minded people though
If u get any bigger I'll leave you GYM BRO GRINDSET: ACTIVATED ✅
*"Straight like that"*
not going to lie, having support in your environment and hobby is good yes. but taking it too far where you scare off people that used to support you isn't good either. knowing who support you and who limit you isn't easy. but sometimes people on either way of the spectrum can still have your best interests in mind? don't rush these decisions. just do your best without pushing it.
Noel packed his shit and said “peace”
She was just jealous of you chest😢
“show me your friends and i’ll show you your future”  me in my early 30s w no friends 👍✌️
Just don't start a cult please.
Soooo, i have no future 😀
I don’t completely agree… if you want to turn your body into something that your partner doesn’t like, you can’t expect your partner will support anyway… what if she wants to get obese? Would you support her anyway? Plus, getting steroids is also a risk for your health so you can’t even support your idea cause of the healthy purpose…
With my ex, she just kept constantly doubting me and played into my own doubts. Every time I said I was gonna do something she was like “that’s contradicting what you said earlier”. I didn’t think it was, but she just HAD to be right about everything 🙄
I don't have friends they are not trust worth
ahh not sure. maybe one of the things she was against was the steroids
My friends are motivational but they are my only friends but it definetly does the job 👍
the waffle house has found its new host
Words I would NEVER say! 😂 chick was out her damn mind
Sigma male
This also happened to me. She doesn't like muscles. I don't plan on getting bigger but its still an option. I don't want someone getting in my way of my plans and dreams.
Her: If you get any bigger, I’ll leave you Me: Where’s the nearest gym
My ex said she’d leave if my traps got any bigger, well nobody is gonna stop me now :)
The waffle house has found it's new host.
Doesn't he need an apnea machine? I get the goal, but at some point it becomes unhealthy, or atleast becomes perceived as unhealthy, and people showing concern might actually be a good thing.
And there is me, making my husband rice with chicken 5 times at day ❤
Attention: Sorrounding yourself with likeminded people is good, but never go to the extreme as creating a hive mind or an echo chamber
I think a lot of times girls say things they think are flattering universally but don't understand that in certain circumstances it's horrible to hear.   If a girl said, "If you got any bigger I'd leave you" I'd assume she's trying to let you know that you're great as you are to the point you don't need to get any bigger, you've already made it build-wise.  That being said, I'd imagine that being the WORST thing to say to a body builder.  xD
she's scared that daddy noel will crush her in the bed
Ah don hav frens
Show me your friends I'll show you your future..  Me with no friend : 😢
“If you keep displaying dedication and determination and looking after your body I’ll leave you” wtf don’t let the door hit your ass on the way out
I don't have friends 😎
This isn't great advice. relationships require compromise
That’s probably the most muscular women I seen
✨"aH!"✨
This is the wrong place to admit this, but I do think you can be too big and muscular
Im 14 and me and my freind Wales up a 6 am to train before School so we dont have to do it after i also Got work and i also just started going to football and i get good grades so i feel like its going good but i just know somethings gonna come and ruin it for me
Noel your ex looks kinda swole
If you dont get bigger ill unsubscribe
I agree with this when there is legit negative influence and toxic people in your life. But this can have the opposite effect where some people will ostracize themselves from others with differing opinions. This can lead to major self entitlement and social echo chambers.
I would say I have these muscles because I need armor and you need a protector unless you know how to whoops ass too
But I got no friends
Dan Peña quote. Show me your friends I’ll show you your future. Great quote
I’m on savage mode I’m on savage mode on these hoes 21 21
Noel: alright bet ✌️
Bro went to buy pre-workout.
It’s a kind of weird but I have a similar situation 😢
I don’t think being that big is healthy. And being on roids is definitely not healthy. She had a point.
gf : if u get a dog there's a 50 % chance I'll leave u  Bf : if I get 1 dog there's a 50% chance she'll leave me, so i guess I need to get 2 dogs, just to be on the safer side of the equation.
I just want to be lean
Bro said 🤷🏾💨
Gains in your glutes before pain's in your ass.
That’s right king
“Hey it’s no problem. I’m not for everyone and everyone ain’t for me” that should be the response
So my girl said she'll leave me if I do drugs  Now have have friends that are like minded and uplift me with my decision 😂😂
can I be your friend tho @noeldeyzel?
This happened to me as well. I didn’t get that big yet but she made it clear  I kept growing and she kept liking my body and me as I grew
No friends no future 😂😢
Oh she meant down there
my dad when i tell him i wont be a doctor
Top G Noel
One of my ex's were like this lmfao
*NoelDeyzel left the game*
My mother says dont get bigger so we can't find a wife for you😂
I get why she would want you to not get bigger, everyone has his one preferences and at least she was clear about what she wanted, and she didn’t wait like a year to break up with you🙂
Noel is a jem. 🤣
im absolutely in love with someone but if she tells me this im out
Daddy noel went to get milk
No joke saw a dude in a lizard costume in my gym doing reps on tricep pushdowns for Tiktok
That's why my ex-wife is my ex-wife. My fiancee now is pretty supportive, just likes to tempt me with food that I try to avoid. Having a woman that likes to bake, and trying to stay within your macros can be difficult
whats the song in the background?
If you imagine his traps are his shoulders he looks like a skinny guy
Homeboy went to buy some whey protein
i only have one friend. i dont talk to any one

Only "good" people or you'll become radicalized
Surround yourself with people who challenge the way you think, but support the decisions you make.

"Get any bigger and I'll leave you"  There's the door babygirl  ➡️🚪⬅️
what if it is the family we're talking about
Love the metal gear solid sound effect that was thrown in there haha.
Legit had a girl threaten to stop talking to me if I didn’t stop working on my body. It made her feel insecure about herself and about her ownership of me. Which made no sense to me, but an ultimatum is an ultimatum. Never talked to her again since that day and then I fked all of her friends. Guess she was right.
The other person can have a point if your partner got with you and you was smaller and you keep getting bigger due to steroid use why shouldn’t they  be able to leave, I wouldn’t stay with a someone who kept getting fatter
Dady knows best 😂
Hey does your penis get bigger though?
i just realized that, he just did the uno reverse card on her instead
"If you get any bigger, i leave you!" Him: **leaves first like a chad**
To be honest man, being genetically big in a geographical setup where being big isn't considered aesthetic is kind of a problem. Here in India, men are 5½ feet tall on an average with their average weight being around 60-65 kg. For women here, that is a standard.  I'm 1.81 m and 103 kg with around 20% body fat and man I get ignored a lot. 😂
Bro grabbed his protein and left
Oh so gangsta🥶
bro i wouldnt leave a greek god💀💀
Bro on steroids
Steroids
Everyone here can agree Dad Noel can get as big as he wants
"I have no friends" , Does that mean I HAVE NO FUTURE?
Honestly if i were to get in the situation of dating a bodybuilder the only thing i would need to make clear is that i do not have the same goals as them.  I would accompany them to the gym of course, but i would just try to get in shape myself while trying my best to encourage and help my partner.  Bodybuilders are one of the most iron willed people so i think having that compromise works out
Bro this shit is real
well dont get surround yourself with ppl who always agrees with you lol you need ppl that can shut you down when your getting to big for your pants(not physicality)   aka true friends
your steroid infested goals lol
I personally don’t want to be huge like a body builder but I have my own goals and your videos are inspirational and don’t just apply to the gym
What future do I have if I don’t have friends😢
I sent this to my girl 😭
Man you really have motivated me alot actually i used to be sad cuz of i was pretty bad at football (i mean soccer but i like to call it football more) you notivated me into believing in myself and made me give myself positve thoughts and now i’m training alot and i have become alot better, thank you thank you for everything man!😁
You do steroids
Too many times us guys stay with a girl and cling on to her just because she's willing to touch our wiener. Look past that and life opens up.
Women:"if you dont get any bigger ill leave you!" Also women:"if you get any bigger ill leave you!"
who would want someone to _not_ gain muscle?? free pillows to rest my head on yes please
Your literally gigachad
Bro is built like a jojo character (pt1-3)
Was told to "drop the knight play if you wanna date me" by a coworker I wasn't interested in nor liked. She thought she was hot shit and kept teasing me about size and my virginity till I reported her for sexual harassment.
The girl:BUFF
"If she doesnt want a bigger you, The energy drinks you should pack too"                                          -wise student
But, I, dont have... friends... *Disappears*
Is jy afrikaans
"Time to get Protein."
How long did it take you to get that gain? I know it is not the best clip to ask that but i been wanting to know.
I mean, in this case if it's not health threatening it's ok to put distance to the other person. BUT you should try to understand why they are telling this to you, sometimes they may be seeing something you don't. Be surrounded by only "likeminded" people it's not a good thing, that will only create a echo chamber in your life
"if you get bigger, I'll leave you!" "why are you packing? are you leaving?" *"no. I'm packing for you."*
The bigger the better 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Song name?
Bro said not if I leave you first 🤣
Are you natty
She wasn't talking about those pecks. 😏
Friends? What friends your the only one I got 😂😢😇
Anyone who try to change u to their liking🚩🚩🚩
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I mean… Noelle, you’ve had a lot of good messages but I’m not sure this is one of them.  A partner isn’t toxic for wanting to date someone who isn’t on the juice.   That said, it’s not toxic to want to be on the juice.  It’s a matter of simply agreeing that you aren’t meant for each other since you have different goals.
I don’t have any friends 🥲
If you get any bigger you'll be leaving everyone.
Just know that the vast majority of the time people get upset by your accomplishments is because of jealousy. STAY HARD
Yeah, it happened to you, most of us don't have that concern :D
She should be happy he's getting bigger I'm Right guys 🙂👍
Your huge man
Can he fit in the barber's chair comfortably?
As a women i can tell you that I'll support the man i love no matter what his body goals are (as long and they are healthy) find someone who will not only support ur goals but motivate you to achieve them!
Why some people don’t like buff dudes?
If anyone said this to me it would be my motivation to 2x my size
what's that song ?
My friend support me working out my mom thinks it good but also dangerous
POV: my dad
He is a real life super saiyan.
What if I don't have friend 😂
Glad now my gf dumped me. She was so freakin lazy jesus, and also not interested in anything I do. Somethimes... it's for the better
Was once in a relationship for two days because as soon as we made it official she started getting mad at me about my swimming for the stupidest reason ever so I pretty much did an exact recreation of what he just did
No, no please GET THEM AS BIGGER AS YOU CAN DA-, Ahem I mean sure keep stacking up those muscle bro.
Its not cute tho ......it's becomes a dangerous obsession and strays from health
Ok
👩🏻 : Bodybuilding man is so scary Bodybuilding man :
this guy deserves a place in the baki universe
If the people close to you support some very unhealthy habits of yours, like steroid use, they don't truly love you...
What if you got no friends
The bigger you get just means more of you to love! ♥
" If someone slows you down , leave them behind " .  - Me
If you get any bigger ill leave you Him: ✌
No I’ll leave u😊
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻jim first, jim second, jim always
Sorta like: A guy telling her: “If you can’t drop the weight I’ll leave you”.
Me and my friend talk about self improvement and how we will be gym bros in the future i think I’m in the clear
this is why we always need a gym bro
that's the best compliment you can receive
"sorround yourself with likeminded people" thats the worst advice you could give lol
"I'll lea-  Goodbue
Tell her the same thing😂
Please help find the song
Ayo Noel, she was talking about your huge whipper, not your muscles...
I want a man like you
Skinny af legs bro pls just up your leg game
I have little to know friends mostly shitty so im a lone wolf
Later b*tch!
Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.  Me who got no friends💀
What if you have no friends?
Muscle density is the key
In a strong relationship you’re a team; either you share the same goals and work towards them, or they’re different and you support each other anyway. My gf and I have this down, and it’s honestly amazing.
Or maybe they just loved you and wanted you to not abuse substances that will fuck you up and it was their last try.  I really enjoy your videos and understand it's more about the meme and because it happened to you also about the emotional manipulation but some people use it because rational arguments don't work and they will do whatever is going to keep their loved ones alive or healthy.  Good for you that you could continue your passion without feeling guilty and for her that she could continue loving without a fear for her partner.
no friends= no fulture ?
Except it was a guy🗿
He went to go buy milk 💀
*"Bro pulled a dad move"* 😂😆😅🥲😐😔🥺😭😭
I have no future
Hey noel how tall r u? Cause you look like ur around 2 metres. Im not saying u arent just want to know
Translation: if you keep doing steroids I’ll leave you
Danko 🙏
Yeah buddy
Lol. His lady voice is on point
"You know what i'm gonna start getting bigger even harder"                                           — Daddy Noel
to be fair, getting too big is a health concern and puts stress on the heart. Its why many massive bodybuilders die in their 50's, so its understandable that not everyone would want a partner with that mindset
The bigger, the better!
All my friends are doing the same thing I am chilling at home and grinding at work and GYM   Reject modernity embrace masculinity my comrades
Support yourself with fellow roidrage losers like this guy. 🤣
“Mom Where is daddy? He said he was going to go to get the milk, but he never came back when I was seven years old.
bruh I love this one😂❤️
HELLPPPPPPP!!!      I eat alot 4 plates but I dont gain weight     I'm eating a lot cause I'm skinny not that skinny just normal
“You know I had to double it
That Man Went instant transmission on her ass
Honestly sometimes us who workout cant see much difference and may feel like we are still small, sometimes its not the case and people around us see a huge change and they can be a good bulk check for you, i advise listening to them some time too not just ignore them because your goals may look ok to you but it could be very ridiculous from a different perspective.
I had 4 ppl fat shame me and call me names today let’s see how I go…  Ight see me in 1 year
Most of my friends don’t work out or don’t train to the same extent that I do. However they are extremely supportive of me. My ex however was not. I started lifting a few weeks before I started dating her and then after a few more weeks she sent me a photo of Dwayne Johnson, and told me she didn’t want me to get that big. So I made the biggest mistake ever and stopped lifting for the entire year and a half I was with her. (I was 15 and very new to lifting and having done no research I didn’t know what was naturally possible) and then she left me for a skinny kid after an entire year and a half. Moral of the story. Never date your crush. And If she tries to tell you how your body should be you should ditch her.
I wouldn't leave, I would kick her out
That's what she said!! Jk it's the opposite
This could also be said in a supportive way if they see body dismorphia and steroid addiction is taking its toll on you. Some partners just want their loved one to be healthy and extreme body dismorphia can be as much of an addiction as anything else.
Her: "If you get any bigger I'll leave you"  Noel: "and I never saw her again"💀
Never understood the point of getting this big. It doesn't look good, makes you slower in a fight and has no real added value.
Bro is getting good with edits
If I have few close to no friends does this mean I have no future 😐
i have no friends
The saddest thing in that scenario is that it most likely wasn't a problem with how big you are, but more of a problem they had with themselves.
I don’t know if I agree with “ surround yourself with like minded people” but I see what your saying
Love this!!😂
On that day, Noel's nuts grew 3x as large
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you" Noel: Sounds like a big load of not my problem
I mean she was probably just looking out for your physical and mental health. Pretty sure steroids and body dysmorphia are real issues.
Kind of similar to what my grandpa said show me your friends and I’ll tell you who you are
Man left faster than my dad 💀
“Bigger”🤔
This man is a king
If you get any bigger, I will stick with you even longer, probably forever.
Can't even gym anymore in Ohio..
As someone once said - "I forgot the part where that's my problem"
Yea I have this problem a lot 🤣
I know its serious but the girl voice is so funny
“Get any bigger and I’ll leave you!” Noel: *turns into a dad*
Daddy Noel I got no friends what’s my feature
Friends?
When it's too small they leave you and when it's too big they leave you  Why am I not perfect enough
I surround myself with like minded and people who have some different viewpoints so I can improve myself better
Bro  you said you were gay and now your talking about having a girl in the past.  I’m so confused 😅
You look like the hulk
Well it is an extreme body type he has. That stands out of question. But having the audacity to try and stop him from what he wants and loves bcs he dient fit your Standards anymore by threatening to end the relationship is just toxic af. Well it always is when a Person is threatening to leave you.
Gigachads brother
Song name?
I have a lot of trouble making friends. It's why I still hang with my tiny group of friends from grade school. Unfortunately they're all pretty doomer-esque type dudes and when I tell them about my ideas of moving forward in my workout plan, career goals, financial situation, etc., I always receive a unanimous "meh".  I don't want to leave them behind (mostly because I'll be friendless) and hope to help them shift from doomer to bloomer, but it's been years and they're only going deeper. I got the message, but I don't think I can take the action.
I Thought Girls Like It Bigger😑😑
Well its her right to say so, if she got to like you with how you were at the time, its her right to leave you if you decide to become something else.
😍
Yea yea… **pulls out phone** so when you get the fck out of my house would you like a large or small suitcase? I’m looking on Amazon right now
Yo is that  the backrooms in the back
Him: *"Seems like you have a mindless head."*
brooo my dad did the same
Have you ever gotten a paper cut
There are my friends :         No money No house No bitches No friends No family No milk No water No live
This guy would be an amazing father...
No she meant big under there not ur body
Can you lift 405
He left faster than his girlfriends dad💀
If you get any bigger I KEEP YOU ♥️😂
😃✌️
I would rather have big friends because they can protect me  (correct my grammar if in wrong)
Wyd, this guy literally gives out life advice least you can do is like the videos.
If my wife or gf threatens to leave me because I'm exercising then I'm just gonna leave her on the spot
isn't the bigger you are the more testerone you can have, no idea why'd you leave that.
She means the other one because its too big😏
Him :- Show me your friends   Me :- Sorry , friends.exe file is not found in this pc
Ha
Strong work. Dropping dead weight is one of the fastest ways to make gains
" If you get ant bigger,I will leave you. " " Alright then, Goodbye✌ "
HIS SMILE IN THE INTRO HAD ME ROLLING
“And thats why my dad went to buy milk”
leave her instead 💪 💯
If get any b- *Proceeds to disappear*
Damn bro used some arab wisdom
Peace
Skill issue **leaves the Sentient chair**
Bro said no problem 💀
It's called a preference. She doesn't like muscle heads. You don't like fat women. She doesn't like muscle head men.
Me:  Has no friends
Dang i though in a releationship we supposed try to find the best to your partner not, U WANT TO LOOK BETTER AND BE STRONGER???  Ah hell naw il leave you,  U will lose me such a girlfriend material.
him: oh shit we out of milk
Noel the ultra mega chad
It’s so wholesomeeeeee
Love that face when you leave the door lol :D
Go get the milk is all what was running in my head
“i missed the part where that’s my problem”
Don’t get yourself a woman that limits you, increase your stats, become the best person you can be, ignore all limits
Show me your friends and ill show you your future. Love that.
Is this Creatin?
This is starting to sound like an unhealthy addiction, please don't overdo it
Noel cold as hell
The way he mimics a girl😂🙌
Man makes a protein shake first then leaves 🤣
nice intro
*"I'll leave you if you become a ni-"*
Lmaooooo
Bro used the dad technique
Meanwhile  GAMERS  Artists Dancers: oH YeAh
"show me ur friend I'll show ur future"
He took "i aint no simp" to the next level💀
Only mi father wants me to work aut
https://www.youtube.com/@Phantoplayz
This is true for everything in life. Friends that you argue with whenever you see them aren’t worth it, spend the time finding true friends.
"I'll leave you instead"
You should cut
Friends?
-get threatened  -pack his gym stuff -refuses to elaborate  -leaves  That was gigachad move right here
Get any bigger i’ll leave you  *I missed the part where that’s my problem*
I dont want to near people are huge is make me nervous and scared
Sir, I thought you were gay
Personally i like his voice. So sexy. ❤ i dont know why.
I disagree being too big ain't looking good a bit muscles is awesome
He straight up put a towel on his head as a wig 😂😅
women ☕
“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future”. The truest thing ever
"show me your friends, I show you your future" dudes with no friends : 😐😐😐
brilliant
Someone actually left noel? Wtf
They mean that you should stop taking steroids .
I won't... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should do mr Olympia rn
If you get any bigger I'll leave you      If your brain doesn't get bigger I'll leave you
this is to cool
I wish i had access to a gym
if it's a man to say it💀
I need the full story
Had this happen with a ex girlfriend,  she like the fact that I was going to the gym but soon she started to get annoy that I spend 2 hours in there everyday. And she's the type that wanted you texting her at all times. When I workout I focus on my workout so no I don't text people. So fucking glad I left that relationship
Me when i see her standing up and peeing
I got one of my friends to work out
Thank you for these words of truth, Mr. Deyzel.
æ ¿
Noel is beautiful, but there is such thing as too big.
Dam i have no future
I adore huge musclemen who want to grow bigger and I want to also become a huge muscleman who wants to grow big.
Nice *Daddy went to find some protein shakes*
I mean it’s the same thing as someone getting fat or skinny. Some people are not into too muscular guys. To each their own, but nobody should be toxic. Don’t like the person for who they are, get out.
Plot twist: she wasn’t talking about muscles 😏
But why?🤔
He literally turned into my dad real quick
I can't imagine a guy saying this to his male partner.
"this is how your dad disappeared" "The fu-"
Cosplay as a baki player
Random question, but if your  buff can you stop working out? Will you become skinny or you become fat?
No B*tches no problem!
It’s why I stopped training for, my ex didn’t like how big I was getting 😢
Was seeing a woman for two weeks and she said I didn’t need to go to the gym anymore because I looked good the way I was , the only reason I look the way I do is because I go to the gym🤪 Two minutes later it was bye bye 👋 😂
I dont go to the gym. My parents told me that i should go to gym. But i dont love or care about my body. Please give me some advice.
My friends group consists of  A gamer A gamer A gamer A gamer A gamer A gamer
Never date anyone with a tea towel on their head they always turn out to be totally wack.
Noel is a Legend.
Bro you woman voice! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That's crazy dude! Made me laugh for like 5 minute, and I watched it over and over again!
Nice 😎
the fucking disapearo act on the peace sign 💀
Show me your friends and ill show you your future Me: 😣
I think the question is why you want to get bigger than what you are. You’re already the size of a fridge.
Women that give u that ultimatum are nuts
Man vanished like my friends dad
the way he just blinked, disappeared was too cool to me
Base on true story 😅
Hey! Same Couch
He made a quick shake for the trip then left, lmfao!
oh daddy noooo
He left faster then my da-
I mean if she meant "if you use steroids i'll leave you" it makes more sense.
“If you get any bigger I’ll leave you”  *tosses her out the window*
This man is the chadest of chads
I dont have friends
People are very unpredictable. Jesus is the only one who is consistent to who and what He is.  Only opinion that matters to me is His.
so i have to take my dog shit mom in the dump
I showed my gf a pic of Cbum and asked her if she would still love me if i get this big, she said she will always love no matter how big or small i'm since i love myself, she will support my goals, i think i won guys 😫gotta marry this girl fr
It is understandable. Not everyone is going to be willing to stay in a relationship when the person they started dating decides to completely change their lifestyle in order to transform themselves into a chemically enhanced gorilla who probably shits like 14 times a day. People, even women, are allowed to decide who they are going to be in a relationship with. 🤷 I know some of you have a huge problem with that though.
What pre workout do you use noel
Too handsome !
She probably said if you don't stop using steroids I'm leaving you
It wasnt a girl who told u that tho.. 👀🤐
also women, who say men disrespect their clothing style:
Her lose i like muscular men 😂 also did i say it right? ;-; is it her loose or lose?
Well, yes and no, you should surround yourself with like-minded and supportive people but they also have to be able to disagree and criticize you. Your previous gf could be worried about PEDs impacting your health and just poorly worded her concerns (but I agree, there is no way to be with person that is able to say things like this). It's important that we do not close ourselves in bubble.
That skit 😂😂
When your shoulder is bigger than your head could be a sign
Amen
I have no friend show my future
I don't have friends for this reason
A guy said that to you😑😑
-"Hey babe I forgot the protein powder" ~"But I told you not to get any bigger" -"I know"
The gus is like you wouldn't leave if I leave you first lol
"Show me your friends and I show you your future".. damn I got no future
He left a women and never touched a women again.
women discouahe us men to eork out bc they want to be our main priority and to leave all our goals for them only weak men leave their goals for women
So...i have no friends... 🤔🤔🤔
Don't worry Noel my friends support my goals
His future kid: "Mommy where is daddy?"  Mom:"My love your daddy went out to get protein powder and never came back."
Sounds like not my problem
Jokes on you, i got no friends
That's why I have v limited friends & they don't even go in double figures 😎
Sexy!
I will never leave you daddy
"if you get any bigger I'll leave you!"  "Idgaf🖕"
Hard to think of a bigger red flag. More than enough reason to end the relationship for that alone.
Its toxic but she kept it 💯 Were like never satisfied. She wasnt satisfied with ur chaffing thighs and being at the gym everyday. U werent satisfied with her honesty.
She might not be a horrible person.. they could just have no sexual interest in muscles, I dont actually
No simp
Wisdom right here <3
Yeah one of my friends started working out and getting big and I told him he should stop or he’ll look weird then a few hours later I realized he should do whatever he wants and apologized to him.
If thats my girlfriend ill do anything for her
Jokes on you I have no friends
My boy
My friends tried to stop me but having me cheat on my diet and h treated to leave me if I kept blowing on them for workouts now I have no friends but I am shonger without them
I mean to gotta feel for her 💀
Where are the steroid tablets 😂😂
“If you get any bigger, ill leave you” Noel: *reverse card*
NEVER. NO. JUST NO.  If your circle tries to hold you back, they arent your circle, they're your cage.
No friends
Man just disappeared like my dad
Man just disappeared like my dad
I’m still here for you daddy❤
A girl won't say this unless you're blasting PED's. I've had girls who told me that they wouldn't support me running PED's and rightfully so.
Yes , get bigger!
I've got no friends, I've got no one
You sound German. Why should we support you or anyone when you care about yourself?
“Fck this sht I’m out”
Show me your friends. What if i got no friends? That means no future for me ?
I got into the gym and that inspired a good chunk of my friends to join too, nothing beats going to the gym on Thursday with the boys
Dude you are my inspiration to lift weights and get bigger, I've been skinny and suffered from depression my entire life and I've always hated it, I've never felt comfortable in my body, my temple. I tried doing all these workouts and watching other people but they haven't given me that inspiration that you have, when I was 17 I was 130 pounds and could only squat about 150 pounds, I'm now 18 and I'm 150 pounds and can lift squat 250 regularly. Thank you so much dude.
if you dont get any bigger i leave you ; she did. A month later i was moving forniture from my house to my truck , she was  at the window looking at me lifting a washer machine over my head(im still 70kg still 180cm).i lift 10tons a day . big guys are detrimental ahahah.

Daddy noel went to buy protein shake
I keep telling my girlfriend this but she's still getting fatter
It happened with me , she left me but m certainly bigger .
*if you get any bigger I'll leave you* Him: Addios
😂🤣🤣
This my favorite video by you!!!
Who wouldnt want to live with a body building giant that will incorage you to become a body builder
This lifestyle is definitely not for everyone. I cannot imagine being that big that i lose my flexibility and cannot ride bikes and fit in cars.
This is the type of guy who get bigger everytime her mother says son you need to stop 😂😂😂
what if you have no friends
He be like : imma go grab some milk
was she really refering to the volume of your muscle or about your growing obsession? and if you were already really buff, maybe she hinted at substance abuse? i would leave my partner too if he abused substances or went to the gym 7 days a week. maybe you misinterpreted her.
I have a bad physique, but your physique is atrocious. Pure steroids.
That's why I love you 😂😄👏
Tf, what could be sexier than a huge man
King 🦾🦾🦾
I’ve never met a chick that actually enjoys training and I sure as chick haven’t meant a chick that does anything else I do. Not sure how you surround yourself with likeminded people when you are hyper competitive and build shit when women just want to sit at home or go be hoes at bars.
I feel like there is a little more nuance to this story, especially with his steroid usage.
Bloke disappeared like my dad
But at age of 17 i naturally having chest 80 cm and height 6'3" i look big as hell for my frnds what i do??? My genetics usually having height and musceles lol
If you can’t please her, leave her
If your abusing steroids its a genuine concern for a loving partner though
Noel I dont have friends, what's my Future 👩
Bro left just like my father
Imma head out no more bad gf
I love Noel but I disagree with him on this. There is too muscular, just like there is too skinny and too fat. If you are any of the three I won’t be with you for very long
Get BIGGERRRRR (or whatever you want)
Dude I think she is a tight one 💀
This is so true, you can be with people thats not exactly like you obviously, but in case of a couple, well it could get complicated
That happened to me. My girlfriend said that when she first saw my knob
I dont have any friends
Yeah, two days ago my GF said this to me!
noel looks hilarious meming a girl lmao
Daddy noel, just look at a blank sheet of paper for me and let me know...
Does anybody know a alternative brand to ryze protin in 15 and its quite expensive.
gym boomers
Umm, wow. Sounds like they were in that relationship for the looks and not for the human within
my gf told this to me sometime I really miss gym go with her
"Get any bigger, ill leave you" bro i wish i got bigger
Song title plizz
So funny :-)😂
I go by that same saying.
i once heard this story of a man with a respectable beard on tinder who match with some girl the conversation went “i dont like beards” “why did you match then” “because you could shave it” “im not shaving my beard for any girl” “guess youll miss out on me tomorrow night 😉” “if you shave a beard for pussy you deserve neither the beard or the pussy -Benjamin Franklin probably” wise words.
Bro who wouldn't want to walk next to this titan,she goofy for dat💪🏾💯
Maybe i will adopt a gorila
That voice at the start 😂
Bigger doze incomming.....
Now I understand why people call him "Daddy Noel"
"Show me your friends, and I show you your future" Me with no friends, so also with no future 😅
Man, I never met a girl that don t want you to get bigger. That must  be terrible
I have no friends. So what is my future like? From that analogy
That’s why he’s gay
I don't understand.. you can work hard to improve yourself, be your best self, and someone will still not be happy about it. I discovered this recently, but having yourself with like-minded and genuine people was worth the heartbreak.
Imagine his ex watching this lmao 💀
His girlfriend: If you get any bigger, i'll leave you Him: Alright i'm out peace
I mean considering you are not natural mayby it was just a concern for your health. Ofc I don't know I wasn't there.
“ Show me your friends “  Don’t have none what’s my future???
“ Show me your friends “  Don’t have none what’s my future???
Noel didn't went to get the milk. He went to get the protein powder
Keep going guys You are doing great
We go Jim
My dad be like
The only thing i want to hear in this Situation „IF YOU GET ANY BIGGER, ILL LEAVE YOU!… if you overdue yourself“  [take breaks people, resting is important]
Honestly, I agree. But what I would like to mention is that everyone is entitled to their own preference. If you aren’t attracted to extremely muscular people, that’s okay. Just like not being attracted to fat people, or any other body type. But don’t let others stop you from doing what makes you happy and therefore a better person!
Women rather be with a Fat dude than with a Big Muscular Buff Dude
ı left all my frends cus they were talking behind my back one of the bros whispired a bit to loud :d
That disappearing peace sign reference tho🤣🤣
Lol
I only surrounded myself with friends i can destroy or at least someone we can fight to the death like captain Kirk and the awkward lizard man Gorn.
I love how he makes his shake before leaving too
What I can do if I can't find like-minded people that supoort me? :(
sheesh
This is my body
U made that meme where the kid signs peace out and then disappeared   I just noticed it
Whatsup. God is real and Jesus is real.  Please call on the game of Jesus and he will answer you and please confess and forsake your sins.  Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus for your eternal salvation.  Please don't risk eternity for the pleasures of the world. We cannot be saved by good works or religion.  We can only be saved by God's grace and He showed us his loving grace through the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus.
Him: Great, I was trying to find a way to break up with you without breaking your heart to much
The amount of [idiotic] people that think that giving your partner a reasonable ultimatum is “emotional manipulation” is a mindfuck, really.  “If you keep drinking, I’m going to leave you.” “If you keep doing those drugs, I’m going to leave you.” “If you keep getting into trouble with the law, I’m going to leave you.”  That sounds so much like manipulation, doesn’t it? The damn woman has every right to not want to be in with somebody she’s not attracted to. That was a warning, not an “ultimatum”.
Man I stg if a girl said that to me I'd probably say, so you want gain or pain?
Me: *shows my friends*  "Where are they?"  Me: Don't have any really 😎✌️
😆
A more reasonable statement would be "If you keep taking steroids, I'll leave you!"
He left just like her dad 💀
"Show me your friends, and I will show you your future"  Umm..... I only have the gym as a friend, does that count? haha
To be honest you should play "Bane" the batman villain
My bro unlock Chad mode
Love❤❤❤ from India 🇮🇳 sir. You are big brother to us thank you🙏.
What song is this?!?!?
There is an old Turkish saying that goes: "Show me your friend, and I show you who you are" kind of relatable.
Dude, if u DO any bigger I willl stop watching your vids....
Your voice ❤️❤️
🗿
Yo he kinda disappeared like my sister's friend father
He was like my dad
The thing that you said " show me your friends and i'll show your future, in Italian we have a similarity saying: "dimmi con chi vai ti dirò chi sei " which translates to:  "tell me who you go with and I'll tell you who you are"
Pov:my dad when we have no milk
😂👍🔥
I just love how men portray women by plopping a towel or shirt on their head and everyone knows it's supposed to be woman. 🙈😂
Bro was waiting for the moment ☠️☠️
NANI?!?!
My response: the Uber is outside waiting
Andrew Tate's rival
My man is op
"finish the rhyme" - 🧓
If I was her I would be like ... dude ..  train me plz 😩
When he peaced out of the house the music hits
“If you get any bigger I’ll leave you!” *GIGACHAD MODE: ACTIVATED*
Ok so.. i speak to my friends once per week, sometimes once per month or even longer but if i'm lucky i can even speak with them 2 or 3 times per week, impressive ik
I have no friends therfore no future
No one knows what I originally said
DID HE JSUT TELEPORT LIKE HE GOING FULL SPEED CUZ HE THINKING HER GF SAYING HER D!#K IS SMALL Ayo that kinda sus tho😳🤨
So what if the man's goal is to get fat?
Show me your friends and I will tell who you are.
My friend is you noel damn
🙄💅
My mom:
I mean, normally I wouldn't go for a guy so jacked, but if I already was with him and then he started to grow muscles, that's no reason to leave someone
Show me your friends Me: whoa i will stop you right there
HaSta La PrOxImAa
Plot twist: she wasn’t talking about muscle
Daddy
So are you suggesting that I should Leave my parents? Cuz they are against me getting bigger and muscular from the get go.
What I dont understand about this video is isnt that his house why is he leaving his own house
Ahahahha that intro. I don't even lift and your shit is so funny sometimes
To play Devil's Advocate I would feel a bit self-conscious if my boyfriend had bigger tits than me
bro fr just said *not if i do first*
I could understand not liking big guys but something tells me he wasn’t scrawny when she started dating him, so she obviously thought it was a good thing. So why tf did she suddenly decide “yk what nvm”??
Guys literally a walking Meatball
Man really said 🙂✌️
I have no friends so its all my fault if i fuck up
"show me your friends, and I'll show your future"  All of my friends are online because I don't trust enough to make friends irl, the people who I see at the gym are far larger than me and seem to be in their 30s (I'm 17(
In a different context, damn...
What if i don't have any friends daddy noel.
Noel is way 2 big
Never give up on your dreams and goals
Bro took pre at night 💀
Dude has the biggest waist in the history of tik tok
This guy looks horrible
LOL!
I personally don't like the big muscle look, but if you didn't want it so bad that you were willing to leave them, why did you get in the relationship in the first place
Giga chad VS him who will win       👇
Not sure if i'd like GF who take testo
What if she wasn’t talking about his muscles
He disappeared just like my dad
She mean your D!
My wife told me this once (not seriously) and I am half of your size lol
That's how my dad left me 🥲
“If you get any bigger I’ll leave you”  Daddy Noel: *becomes sigma and leaves first*
I dont think you should be sorrounded by mindliked people but ones who support you
I mean you are pretty big though lol
Oh no I run out of creatine gotta go irl
*She wasn't talking about his muscles.*
showed alex eubank to her and she said “ew” …
Bye Have A Great Time!
Bro went to giga chad realm to get bigger
She couldn't take it anymore if he got bigger....
I love guys with big muscles, so if a woman says that crap, just know there are women out there who would love to have you 💕
Imagine what an absolute dumbass you have to be to break up with THE DADDY Noel 😫
But I mean surrounding yourself only w/ that think like you and support you avoids criticism no? I think you meant to get rid of toxic people that don't give real criticism and try to take you down
This actually happened to me literally  And I'm the one who left her
The basic tip is if your "friend" tells you - *blank blank* - then I'll leave you. Leave them immediately trust me.
My Friend is pushing 400kg on leg press and doin the L dance on my me when i go and try my 200kg PR @_@  What's my future?
welp guess I've gotta find new parents then
Happened to me
That’s the thing i don’t have friends and I don’t have a girlfriend .
i left that girl
Do you use a lot of Ryse products?
Him : show me your friends  Me:
My man went living in the gym.
Nice
If she doesn't respect your grind shes not the one you are trying to find
but not too likeminded bc then you will become closedminded
I can't believe it! Who doesn't want to ride a big muscular guy. The size difference by itself is driving me crazy
The problem is  I was in Indonesia   Everyone could be a traitor and i have quite a passion that maybe an entire school dont even like
Actually my mom dad are like this🥲
I've become such a big fan of Noel, I found his channel recently while going through a breakup and he really speaks alot of knowledge
He said: PEACE ✌
dude you are healthy and strong enough you can take a break and eat as many unhealthy food
Steroid man
Women ☕
Sooo... no friends = no future?
When I think he won't make me laugh he does.
lmao tbh no matter what your body type is either fat skinny or muscular if you're satisfied with your body then thats all that matters somebody that truly cares about you will love you no matter what dont forget that kings
Isnt Noel gay tho? Ive heard rumours that he isnt straight, honestly i dont give a single fuck wheter that sentence to him was told by a woman or man, but im curious for no reason because i like drama like everyone else. Fml
menace
This guy he is so funny yet very intellectual 🤣
I mean if ur taking steroids, she has a point
You became like my dad
No friends bro
whats the bg music?
Gg he teleported
Women☕
If i was a girl and had a big strong bf i would try to f him -
surround yourself with yesmen so youll never have any self awareness
Bro left faster than your dad skull
But... I dont have any friends... Does that mean i dont have future at all?
Metal Gear Solid is universal lol
Ayo he said hold let get some pre workout  and the disappeared
What about family? What to do when your family don't support you?
yesss, if someone is blocking me from my goals I just enjoy doing the opposite and be more stubborn and determined.
Here are my friends:
Are you sure the conversation wasn’t a little more like   “if you don’t stop taking steroids I will leave you?”
I was thinking better leave her ass after she said to stop
why is it when people want to portray a woman character they put a towel over their head
I feel like it might be OK if they say "get off steroids"
He said peace out
What if my friends are just not good friends at all
Like my dad. 🥺
Fu*k them hoes! 💪💪💪
"if u get any bigger,i will leave you" Ma'am but you are as a big as him
Really the ex is just jealous as Noel was making them look tiny and stealing their attention
Hey man, my legs aren’t the size I want them to be mostly my gluts and calf’s is there anyway to stimulate growth ,thanks man keep up the good work 💪
You're so beautiful to meeeee, can you see?
Guess i dont have a future
I'm short, if I get any bigger I would like like a cartoon.
Good point on how to react in that situation or any other time someone gives you an ultimatum. You could give into them, and they may still leave anyway.
"thanks for the boost of self esteem!"
who would ever leave daddy noel 😩
Good luck
"If you get any bigger, I'll leave you" "Ok."
I need to get some friends first lmfao
"If you get any bigger, ill leave you!" Oh no no no, ILL leave you first
What if I have no friends?  Do I have no future?
Daddy Noel is slowly but surely taking over youtubw shorts
I love this man
Bro disappeared at the end 😭
Daddy noel Never came back with the Milk!
Why would you not want a giga-chad at you every day like if you’re at a club and a guy walks up to you he can just glare and him and bro will evaporate like thanos just snapped his fingers
“If you get any bigger, I’ll leave you!”   See ya bitch
Step one: get a girlfriend
but daddy i dont have any friends
😂😂
"Ayo that's exactly how my dad left me for milk 🥛 😂"   Edit:Bruh wtf 1k likes !!! Jeez y'all be tripping over daddy noel hard 😳🥴😏
Bro has biceps larger than my head
Her: “if you get any bigger I’ll leave you”  Society: that’s fine  Him: says the same thing  Society: YOU ABSOLUTE PIECE OF SH-
W
I mean, personal preference and physical attraction is a thing. Whether it's a guy or a girl, you're entitled to leave a person if they're no longer physically attractive to you. Now, is that saying he's in the wrong for getting jacked. No, if he wants to look that way all the power to him, he's impressive.
The girlfriend just as big as him
To be fair I’m sure she didn’t always wanna be on top 😂
Hey there! I've been working out for like 2-3 months can you tell me how to flex my chest muscles
That would  just make me want to get 5x bigger
What if I have no friends
🙏❤️🙏❤️
The question is for you. Weights or Dates?
Based
It's sad you have to pretend to be straight
Mega chad
Don’t let anyone stop your grind
She belong to the streets   MY girlfriend is nothing like that she wants me to stay healthy and safe
I have no close friends what’s the future
“But, Tien, the doctor says if your shoulders get any bigger…”
Happened to me too and IM UNDER WEIGHT
What if don't have friends
Is it ok for me to say: "if you dress like this I'll leave you" ?
*THEN LEAVE*
I usually work out with friends and their very supportive but they sometimes feel anxious about tearing muscles: what’s the big deal and how can I help?
"say you'll get bigger then quit and I'll leave you!"
Show me your friends and I’ll show you your future. Me, has no friends
It's because she didn't want him getting bigger than her. 💪
i just want to say that you are probably my most favorite creator on social media. such a good guy and a great influence.
Remember guys, girls are temporary but gym will last forever
Change you name to Neal daddy
Based on a true story
YEAHHH Gym bros before hoes
He left just like my dad
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future"  Me with my imaginary friends:
Here’s my friends ☹️:
Honestly that's her choice... Just tell me in advance
“If she’s been with eight guys it might not be pretty in between her thighs” -master oogway
You disapeared just like my dad
"if you get any bigger I'll leave you!" Says the girl who's shredded
Song?
You so funny and adorable
Bro should make an asmr channel
Your ex looked like she's just jealous about your gains.
Sad part I don't have friends ☹️ but it's probably cuz they don't understand the discipline to train and train hard... both my daughters do and I got a son on the way
But I don’t have any friends???
You can’t leave me if I leave you first!
Daddy noel left faster than my dad left me for the milk
Why did him disappearing from the doorway seem familiar.... Oh right my dad
Don’t have friends
"If you'll keep getting bigger I'll leave you"  Daddy noel:Leave me now I'm already big.
I dont have any friends 😎
DADDY NOEL 🥵🥵🥵
What's song
Ur a chad
"Get any bigger, I'll leave you" "Peace out"
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future."   Bruh. Shit.
Bro disapeard like my dad💀💀💀
Noel didn’t leave to get milk, he left to be a healthy father figure to someone
going gym only for girls? dam bro
Think you mean the opposite
this man is the best i was unknowingly following his advice before i saw his vids i now watch him to get more knowledge
🤣
I don’t have friends
Bro the way he disappeared had me dying
He went for milk
I don't fully agree, having friends of a different mind can keep you from making terrible mistakes with your life. Overdoing likemindedness can end up leaving you surrounded with yes-men
Ok but whay was he so cute at the door just look at that smile
"show me your friends" : ___  here, and now tell me my future, please. ☻
If my girl said that I'd train even harder
Bro literally is a based chad
I think it is very understanable if your partner looses her attraction to you when you drastically change your looks. I don't aggree with the uppity attitude in this video
WE GO JIMMMMMMMM!!!!
Say the exact same to a woman and watch your entire life get destroyed
Commits mitosis just to commit nothingness.
Hitting that peace at the door and then disappearing was GOLD🤣😭👍🔥
😂😂
How about we don't give a fuck about what they think or want?
My man turned into the rock
The first one had a muscle fetish, but she was hot af.....and we all know how that usually goes.
Who would you like to train with for a day... Me: Noel .D
Yasis , your videos are the best bro im bust....
Dont worry he just left to grab some milk he'll be back soon
I though it was a bad thing to surround yourself with likeminded people
I don't have friends
Thank you for your videos
Step 1: Find 24 hour gym Step 2: live at the gym Step 3: become a GOD
Anyone else think he looked like a hella buff Toby Maguire in the peace out scene
I was thinking sm💀💀
That was so funny 😂
"If you get any bigger i'll leave you" *Bigger what?*
Well what if i have no Friends because everyone thinks im „Cringe“
Sadly this is kinda my mother…
🙃
My dad must've been really big 😃
That's no problem for me since I can't get bigger 😎😎😔.
🤣🤣🤣
Love the dan pena quote
He really said "Adiós"
she probably knew about his steroid use and wanted him to become healthier but u know u go king
I would never leave you daddy
Awe poor daddy Noel
To be honest tho a lot of girls don’t like that body type it’s just too big
The way he yeeted off the main door just killed me. 🤣🤣
my friends actually exercise with me
I won't ❤️
Who would like to leave daddy noel
And that's when Noel started the huge quest
Girls like the Justin Bieber or Brad pitt slanky abs figure. But if you love getting big forget what girls want do what you like.
She's not leave him but he's leave her
The towel on the head killed me😂
Maybe they dont want you to get twice as big because idk maybe you upping the doses on your roids and your cholesterol is all fucked up.
Song?
Noel was like : F* off Bozo I’ll get twice as bigger (starts playing ZYZZ beat in his mind💀)
Noel, I have a question for you. Why do you take steroids?
the only way this makes sense is if you are getting fatter. Then that is helping you
If my girl told me this i'd leave faster than my dad left for milk
not to be rude but is this an actual genuine problem? cause i thought most girls would rather have a bigger and stronger guy?
If someone says that to me I'ma just send them this video
Only daddy Noel would get left for being to big :O
gains over hoes
that's a man,I like it
I personally don’t want to be as buff as you but that’s just because I don’t think it would look good on my body it looks great on you though. I can understand when people say that since whenever I draw and look at muscled men for references there is a certain amount of proportion in terms of muscle mass that is optimally appealing to most people even myself, but looking at you it’s a lot but it’s not too much in terms of proportion compared to other body builders who just look jacked beyond all else. Not saying they shouldn’t be that buff since they chose to be that way and  worked hard for it much like yourself, shame she couldn’t see that in you.
My guy in backrooms xd
This man is a legend !!
I'm totally into mommy Noel
He was like:"I'll go get the milk"
😂😂😂😂
A woman can say that to a man, but let a man try to say that to a woman. He'll be shamed into oblivion on Tik Tok.
bc her hole cant handle it    it goes downright horrendous ik
D-daddy how much you p-packing
where can i buy those steroids damn
Honey, we can always get a bigger bed
the "Bye" was on another level
what if my aspirarions are drug smuggling or an ethnostate? joining a circlejerk doesnt sound like the best to me. i know youre limited by the short format and of course someone who threates to break up over something like that deserves to be dumped but sorrounding yourself by likeminded people is a recipe for disaster
I’m just saying, i don’t like the muscle look. I mean it looks dope and it’s functional, but it just seems like it would be a hassle and I feel bad for people sometimes. But it is 100 percent personal opinion. Keep doing what you’re doing.
too big for her
Daddy Noel went to get milk.
If anyone ever tries to strip you away from your passions in life, tell them you'll help pack their bags.
"Getting bigger" or any other "aesthetic" shit is gay as hell. Getting stupid strong is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
Ngl I get why people go to the gym and stuff but I don't know why people just try to get as big as possible like doesn't that have any negative effects can some1 explain
Yeah right, said no woman ever😄
Sounds like my wife she said she would leave me if I followed Jesus Christ glad Jesus died for me because my wife won't
Happened to my buddy Eric once
u give  me escanor vibes
People has said that saying to me many times
"You get any bigger and ill leave you!"  "Are you threatening me with a good time?"
Im still wondering how can you scratch your back with that body
makes sense. Getting that big isn't exactly healthy and doesn't necessarily show good priorities for a family. Plus of course the steroids and the health.
Man, how bigger can you even get
She’s jealous of your chest
but you see, sir noel...  uhh....  the one that said that is not other than my mother :( even she can notice my half centimeter growth on my shoulders (no kidding)  i'm absolutely want to get bigger, but at the same time i don't want to make her hates me... what should i do?
him: procced to be escanor at high noon
Other dads: *left to buy milk* Daddy Noel: *left to buy protein powder*
In my country we say something along the lines of: "tell me who you hang out with and I will tell you who you really are" kinda similar :p
According to this video, she didn't want him being bigger than her.
Actual giga chad
Leave her before she can leave you
Having people with different opinions is good but having people who'll leave you over doing what you personally like isn't
so if i have no friends i have no future?
If she is in the way Then she shall not be your bae
Bro vanished
”Show me your friends, and ill show you your future” Me knowing i dont have a future because i dont have any friends: 🤧
What the future if you have no friends?
Bro he left faster than my dad with the milk
While I agree with the sentiment, is it so unreasonable given the PEDs you have to take and the strain on your body to have so much muscle? (He's even admitted to being hospitalized over this)
Bro does so much cardio he vanishes in 1 frame. I don't want to hop on the treadmill but that's fucking goals right there.
Man just said bye lmao 💀
When you want introduce me  And some of maa dues to your lovely friends    Common be open about spreading love  You know we should make  New bondz Freind ship bondz common you know warram mean aren’t you
"show me your friends" me:
Is he assuming i have friends?
Heartbreak is the greatest motivation for lifting. Don't recommend taking it daily like your pre-workout though 🤣
Anybody knows what song that is?
Ha jokes on her a part of me can't get bigger them 2
Man really pulled out the uno reverse
wham
Imagine the girl who said this to him... Oh girl, You don't know what you've done... You said this to Daddy noel....
"The gym he enlarges his muscles, so in bed it's more fun to tussle" - Master Oogway
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future" Me: surrounded by great supportive people. Brain: "Are we the baddies?"
What if I have no friends
"show me your friends and i'll show you your future"  i-i- have no future?
It's extremely funny how a towel in the head can completely transform a person now 😂
Ultra giga buffed guy are kinda "scary" to see
The towel really brought out his feminine side
hro his ex as big as daddy noel😳
Noel really pulled a My Homie Jerome lmao
Love how he just starts making a preworkout bottle and leaves lmao
This happened similarly but it was with work hours. She cmoplained how 'You're always at work, you never find time with me' mean while I'm doing 50-60 hour weeks and come home to a woman who despices that. I kicked her out faster than she had time to pack her things.
Its very hard to find ppl like ur mind or personality or humor these dayz
I love how daddy Noel with a towel on his head transformed into mommy Noelina
I have no friends... nor future
So this guy taking roids or what
Same to her if you get bigger I will leave (pregnant/Fat) 🤣
I know this guy who has no friends, what is his future?
A: Tell me who your friends are and I tell you how your future will be. B: Who your friends are. A: How your future will be.
Good video
"nani" sound is the only sound that's  missing here
sigma
That female voice..
lovin the godzilla pre workout💪💪
This edit is 🔥
Tell the story
Ex GF:If you get any bigger I'll leave you!!!! Me: Say less!!! *quickly puts gym bag together* Me: ight get out, got gains to chase😁😁
That's the biggest woman I've ever seen
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Noel: say less
Agreed sir 😊
"show me your frnd and i will show u your future" me : i dont have any frnds so i dont have any future???
Tell them they can leave
That's a good argument but I want to be the devil's advocate: Surrounding yourself with like minded people might eventually make you unable to respond or react to people who aren't that unfortunately you have to face, there for having a chance of being countered.   Besides I personally find more satisfying convincing someone who doesn't agree with you or obtain the respect of someone who disagree with you more than just being with people who always say yes.   Negativity is occasionally required to become stronger like you need more heavy weights to gain muscles    Devil's advocate out
That's true the people around you should help you with your goals but also leaving a girlfriend/boyfriend because they change the way the look is ok.
Me who has 0 friends
What about when your mom acts like this toward u ..
Jokes on u I don't have anyone
I love how chill this guy actually is.
Cut the others loose
She already left me, even before i could get bigger. Fck em focus on doing you. Bro spittin facts ✊🏾💯   PS: love the voice 🤣 lmfao
That fkn women impersonation 💀🤦🏻
Needs to train his neck
I have smart friends but I'm dumb😭😂
damn his girlfriend is as big as him, she must not want him to be bigger than her 😳
Dale Carnegie babyy!!!! 💪💪💪
ya i doubt anyone ever said that
Anyone know the name of the song?
I thought she said "if u can't get any bigger ill leave u"
Boss sigma
Bro vanished into molecule particles.
That girl sounded like a beast to 😅🤣
So you meet a woman want to spend your life with them, then you bulk up to the point that you are no longer recognisable as the person they fell for then you condemn them that they don’t feel the same way. That makes no sense 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why is this titan blessing my timeline all of a sudden
Bro looks like bane
I'd never leave Daddy Noel. He's far too much of a wholesome, honest, kind person. Anyone would be lucky af to have him
Me: has no friends No future for me I guess
I wouldn't mind if my man got bigger, but only in a natural way. Just a preference
And that was the day Daddy Noel left to get the m- Pre workout
bro i like how he dissapeared like in that meme
It’s hard finding like-minded people. Most pretend to be like you because of jealousy.
If you get any bigah I’ll LeAVE you
Lol
His smile when he's at his door, yoo maaan.                *ADORABLE*
mfs acting like bigger=better
In her defence, this mountain of a man must take the whole bed.
Joke on you, I got no friends.
Dang why is the outside lookin like the backrooms tho?
>show me your friends and i will show you your future >me who has no friends : yeah about that...
His girl probably: If you get any bigger, I’ll leave you Him yelling at his gym brother: DON’T RACK THE WEIGHT!!!!
My family was like this to my dad when he started working out. They were upset because he would always work out and not spend time with us, and when he does he would be sweaty and smell like the shit Amber left on Johnny Depps bed. It has gotten to the point of where he is working out with a broken foot and might need to have surgery because of it
«Then I am definitly going to get bigger. Thanks for the tip»
I mean like you can not like the way muscles look but if you love someone truly not just based on their looks you would love them no matter what especially if it’s good for their health.
Obtain the dream physique However big you want kings
I’d just get down do 1 push-up
I used to be the fuck-up dragging everyone else down, but I made some savvy investments in my early 20s and now I'm pretty wealthy but still don't have a career.
I broke up with my girlfriend because she stopped believing in me and the things that I can do.  I remember one time I decided not to attend my awarding and by that I didn't receive my medal (first honor) in science, because she was sick so I came to her house and make her feel better, but things went sour so I decided to leave her and made my peace. She went nuts. You're right man, goals first and surrounding ourselves with the ones who truly appreciates us.
*I AM DYING!!!* 💀💀💀
The outside looks like the backrooms for some reason.
This man aint no simp
Noel: "Welp, gotta double my size to deal with this heartbreak"
Dudeeee he’s just like my dad….he disappeared
Pump n dump baby
man im bout to take me some protein rn
She wasn’t talkin about muscles 😩😩😩
“If you get any bigger ill leave you!” In muscles or in thicc thighs? I’ll like both.
Ok so basically, I want to be a stick
Why be a bf when you can be Daddy?
Guess I've got no future either.
O
If you get any bigger.....without me *Good ending*
bro why would you not want somone big, good pillow and protecter
Is It Just Me Or Why Is There Two Of Him And How?!
bro's hitting every pr possible that same night!
😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣 my man just up and left "se ya "
I mean you don’t wanna be any bigger if you plan on living long
Good for her. What you're doing now isn't healthy. Peace be with you.
Continue leaving and I'll continue growing
I fear this man
Bruh the way he left the house, it got me 😂
Wow, I can't imagine anyone saying that to daddy Noel, he's got a great physique. He did the right thing by disappearing so fast, she must've thought he was a figment of her imagination.
At this point he's not just giving gym advice, he's the Father figure of the internet
Oh no he's gonna be a ballon
She couldn’t handle the neutron style
Dude this happened to me to, now I'm with someone who wants me to just be happy.
WAHT WHAT!? Who would be Unhappy about That?? What women Wouldn't appreciate that?? or friends!? TF  Fuck em
"Adios"- noel sensei.
btw I’m too lazy to workout but u could beat my a$$ if I tried to smoke wit u bro
damn I seriously want to get big but got no time
Daddy please tell me about low testosterone hair over body can i achieve nice physique
Peace out
Chad
My dad getting milk:
ok but my man's built like a Jojo character
I bet this guy has a theme song It plays when he enters a room
Ok daddy noal
Im usually not a fan of alot of muscle but i respect the grind, though cause of All Might from My Hero and Noel here my mind is getting all these confused feelings! Haha
Noel’s sister?!!!
Her: stop getting bigger i leave u *looks down* So no good time
Is it me or is he gonna be like PEACE OUT then dissapears
Bro went to get the milk
CHAD
Man if I was his girl i'd stay   Wait wait wait PAUSE NO HOMO
He doesn't even fit in frame
King mindset.
If i were to be his lover i would leave,my 3 Non existent holes cant handle somthing that big💀💀💀
Noel : **Keep the change**
How tall are you
My mother told me to stop doing this kkk thing. So now, i join a like minded people.
Bro became my dad when he gonna get milk💀
Guys he actually cloned himself for this video, were not sure how he broke into our clone facility but he did.
I mean I don’t really blame her bruh
What a Chad just like me.
Ima get the milk.
The sigma male grindset don't stop improving, have people supporting you supporting yourself.
My reaction: Do it. You can leave me now. I don't care
Noel is the book based definition of Giga Chad
I switch my phone to my left hand immediately when I saw you
You can't listen to them- you just gotta be the one who leaves.
adios
Bro I was enjoying the vid as usual and then I realized  I wasn’t subscribed. Had to change that, keep up the great work!
Stop taking drugs my guy
Here's the thing: I get both sides of the coin. Some people don't want to be with people that have extreme body types (and yes, daddy Noel's body is fucking extreme) and, since he was getting more and more muscular, she probably started to feel less and less attracted. Whether he decided to stay in the relationship or just break up with her, it's nobody's fault. At the end, Noel's goal was to be ripped (and maybe doing youtube to help people be better physically and mentally) and that overcomes everything: you don't want to be cuffed with someone that wants/needs you to sacrifice your goals for the relationship (unless there's some big responsibilities to take on like children and even then, there are probable alternatives). Choose your partner wisely so that you can support eachother instead of dragging eachother down to satisfy eachother's social and sexual needs (or any of the basic needs in the Maslow pyramid).
Are you South African south 🇿🇦
the bigger the smaller
His smile while leaving is priceless
I want someone as big as you. I would faint if I had a boyfriend that could bench me.
He ain't a simp 💀
Daddy: I'm asking you to leave then
I have no friends, what does that say about me?
The words are “if you go to the gym again I’ll leave you” cause I assume she doesn’t want u since u won’t give her the time in ur relationship
This has also happened to me a lot of times i was like imma grab that milk 💀
What if i dont have friends
I have a very buff internet friend and I mention his strength ever time I can since I find it nice
Wow, he left faster than my dad
Why wood you leave daddy Noel
“I’ll leave you” *disappears*
Too bad we can't get bigger down in between
hime show me your friend i show you your future me i dont have friends
It’s nice having muscle but if you get too big you can’t even wipe your own arse explain to me why you would like that 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.”  Looks like I got no future
Who in their right mind would even say that, if it was out of worry for your health sure, but if not then you have no right to even date someone.  Just my thought.
Haha soon as the lady said that I knew where this was headed
Noel was like: YOU WILL!?
"Surround yourself with like-minded people" how hitler rose to power...
"Show me your friends " Failed at step 1
Plot twist: that person cared about him and didn't want him shooting gear anymore
Basically, he got shit tested and passed with flying colors
She talkin about something else 😏
Wait, was that his actual fingers that he used to throw the peace sign? Why do they look like they're attached to a skinny person's body?
She wants something else bigger
If you get any bigger I’ll leave you: puts on some stilts
girlfriends are temporary, discipline is forever
Anyone notice his hair falling out
find a big Babay 😊
😂😂😂
Daddy's smile at last 🌝😂
"Honey please stop taking steroids, you're tearing the family apart"  Gym bro: "later babe. I don't stay with people who don't support me being healthy"
he seems like a nice guy ngl
Surround yourself that are cool but aren’t you  like minded groups lead to close minded people
This man is more horrifying than looking at furries ruling the world (just look how jacked he is)
This is why I don't have friends. I can do bad by myself
But really this is kinda fair. If someone becomes unattractive or unhealthy maybe you don’t want them anymore. I really wonder why Noel wants to get bigger than he currently is? His body is amazing as it is! Could be some dysphoria?
I mean...what he is doing is extremely unhealthy ...man will probably have heart failure coming up , and you can't expect a future with somebody who's probably going to die.
Unless you work online then leave me alone I'll succeed better
Honestly happened to me with my "friends" best way to look at it is it's just trash taking itself out in a sense because they were all negative.
Not fair If it’s the moon when you the inflated earth xx
That feel when no friends
A girl I used to date told me that she wanted me to stop working out. And that she liked dad bods. Reality: she was very insecure and didn’t want to date someone who was better looking than her and didn’t want the attention to be on her partner rather than her.
Of course Noel is a Metal Gear Solid fan 💪✊😎 Solid Noel 😎😂
This made me realize i need new friends
the editing is 👩‍🍳💋
Wouldn't say that if you made more money?
ONG NOEL. ON GOD.
"If you get bigger, I'll leave you!" "Not if I do first. Bye, have a great time." "Wait wha-"
I don't think she was talking about your biceps. Some girls just can't handle it
can i have some of those muscles... im skinny af
Noel just did. dad-no jutsu
Fission Mailed.
I have no friends. I have no future?
I wonder how there are two Noels at the same time moving
My friends dontt care abt me and ignore me what is my future
Let’s just talk about the economics and stuff about the world man
If she's willing to leave you when you're big she'll definitely depart from you when you're small....
That's deep
Get any bigger and I'll subscribe.
This also happens to me once as well but it was my dad who disappeared
Is it just me or his head looks small for his body
If you get any bigger you’re not human
I keep no friends  Tell me my future
I don't workout or anything but I really enjoy watching this guy's videos.  That one at the door got me crying 🤣
Yeah we're only getting one side of the story. He's not telling us how he was roided out nonstop and constantly raging on his girlfriend. She was saying if you keep juicing I'm leaving. She didn't care about how big he was. And he knows that.
Bruh bigger than that? he is a giant titan🤯
Song?
No friends no future ?🥺🥲
How is that a threat? That sounds like a challenge!
What if it’s my dad who is blocking me
Imagine when this dude becomes a grandpa
It hurts more when it’s your family members bro, not just about getting big, it always sucks when you don’t get the support
I thought you were gay
Sigma mindset💪💪
🐐 mentality
What is that song 😭
Da-Daddy
Man bought a milk and never came back
Just found a new friend actually, we hit it off running. Didn't really know her before but by chance we talked and now we support each other through thick and thin. Never thought I'd have a girl bff b4
Him: I’m gonna get the milk
Her:if you get anymore bigger i will you Also her:just as big as him
To be fair she wasn’t that pretty anyhow…
bro i dont think humans get more massive... yousa rhino
No friends No future
"Show me your friends"  First i need to get some 🙂
What if you have no friends
So i have asthma and started with a little light running (2 miles out.) Mixed between running walk but not matter what its the 4 miles. And my parents found out and weren't very encouraging about it.
This dudes muscle mass must weigh so much, he gets stronger by holding himself up
That's why you gotta start dating your bros.
damn bruh youre giant
Giga chad
"If you get any bigger, i'll leave you!"  Man decided to leave her lmfao. Cannot be threatening someone tryna achieve their goals smh.
"Aight imma head out"
Motivation 😎
He literally IS THE COUCH which hes sitting on
Man's wasted no time 🤣
What if I have no friends, then can you show me my future?
“In a parelleuniverse”
"Show me your friends, and I'll show you your future."  Me who doesn't have friends: (fades from existence)
That was a mighty kawaii way of dipping. 🤣👍
Man disappeared so fast Than My father.
Girls have said this to me and left sadly. They couldn't handle the extra few inches. Made them walk funny afterwards
His smile tho 😂
sigma GRIND set
Dam he left himself for himself. . . . Those gains must be that important.
IRL gigachad
She wasn't talking about his muscles
If you don't do (insert unreasonable request here). I'll leave.  Catch ya later then.
No way, I think all girls love Bigger men lol.  And if they can get even bigger (muscle wise not fat lol) then that's better.
I don't have any friends...what does that mean?
His body physique is like Jonathan Joestar
"Get any bigger, ill leave you" "Sounds like a you problem."
This guy's neck  Could survive a meteor
My man turned into my dad
Okay so noel i have a question I'm a 18y/o and I'm dating a 19 y/o he's like a gym freak and i support that, and by supporting i mean gifting him creatine and all but he suddenly chooses to take up steroids and I'm not in support of that because it will affect his health, it's not like I'll leave him but it's affecting me..am i being toxic? Please i need some real advice
Shes not talking about your muscles 🤣 shes talking about 🍆
Is this giga chad 2.0?
She left one of the holy kings of the round table
Respond with "If YOU get any bigger I'm leaving you!".
Tbf I think it’s your responsibility to look your best for your partner, but ultimatums are never the best way to go about anything.
Mans built like a max out video game character
I have a one question what protean you use because i.m confused in mass and whey protein
"Not if i leave you first"
So you’re saying I have no future?
"Pump and dump , baby"
idk bro you need friends that tell you when something is a dumb idea Likeminded people are cool but don't have  yes-men
Ultimate Mega Giga-Chad.
He looks like he'd pop if you poked him with a pin
My dad:
You know what we just ran out of milk. I'm gonna go get some. I will definitely come back soon.
I have no friends nor a future
She's right, whats the point ? Just because you have goals doesn't male them right.
u faster than my dad when he left me
He is huge tho
God loves you all and you can all be saved (if not already) by just putting faith in Jesus Christ and repenting of sins (turning to God from sin and changing your ways for God) And you should ask for forgiveness of your sins (this can be anywhere) have a nice day  Jesus is my lord! And the solution to hell!  And dressing sexually/posing sexually is a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be and the same applies for listening to music with sin in the lyrics and the same applies for insulting people even when they insult you and being toxic and all types of lying is a sin and using Gods name in vain is a sin and doing homosexual things is a sin/being homosexual    And show mercy to be shown mercy by God And good deeds are kind acts that the person doing it has no cost for it.  And I'm not a bot  . .
I thought ... I thought someone would like buff, or sign of power, smth like that- yea everyone has different choices, taste
His reaction: I have been waiting for those words
O agelitty
so if i have no friends i have no future?
Bruh went to get protein powder
If you get any bigger ill faint at how hot you look without those gym clothes.....omg just the thought.....
I get the premise of this video, but that’s also how you get surrounded by yes men that’ll never hold you accountable
They probably just wanted to see you more but yeah
never personally had this problem😢
I would never leave you
personally i find it a bit gross when people are SUUUUPER buff, but i would never LEAVE someone over it....
This guy is like my dad...
What if he fought the rock. Who would win?
I got the same thing going on rn now but i wont stop the grind 💪
normally they say  that when u start the roids
She was right, your no different from a morbidly obese person or a drug addict. You are addicted to working out the same way they are. Being as big as you are is not healthy in any way shape or form. Its bad for your heart, and longevity. Exercise like all things should be done with balance, and based on the size of your biceps you clearly have none.
Op🔥🔥
Ryse pre workout 💪
She’s pretty jacked herself.
Bro disappear ed faster than my dad, except he created the milk, bet he was just gonna go get some more materials to make more milk
You should hire a real woman next time. Cause, she looks more bigger than you at that angle.
He looked so cute when leaving ngl :)))))
Like, it's okay to stay healthy and stuff but soon you won't be able to walk because of these muscles
I think she just can't handle it.
Got no friends got no problems 💪💪
Goals are always above love
He ain't no simp
Your video production is amazing!
Only dopey women think like that, you'll get smaller with age anyway, more muscle now dose'nt mean exponential growth
I have a work out friend that is suportive but he is very negative when we are not inn the gym, pls help
Beat?
Clean as heck edit
This man is a megachad
✌🏼
likeminded people who support your distorted image of yourself; if you look this way and you think you should get bigger, you are deluded and you are no longer able to properly assess your appearance and proportions; men are supposed to work out in order to be healthy and look attractive, at this point you look unnatural and, to me, decisively unattractive; anything more would be verging on the monstrous
Man doing his sigma male grindset
"This actually happened to me once" *Anyways this video is sponsored by GFUEL*
: "Show me your friends and i'll show you your future. Me: Ha! Jokes on you i don't have any friends
Bruh if this happened to me it wouldn't cause I'll be gone yesterday. She will be talking to my afterimage.
I am 12 and I work out a lot I have abs and pretty decent size arms I use protein powder and protein bars what do you advise for me to do
Kings aren't simps lol
ms. Torgue and mr. Torgue arguments be like:
His girlfriend is just as big as him though
Show me your friend & I'll show you your future. Me with no friends 😐 I have no future? 😞
*Keeps a gun collection * Girl: you buy one more gun and I'll leave you  Guy: * watches Noel's video* *surround yourself with like-minded people* . . . Joins ISIS the next day 🌚
Would love it if it gets bigger 😩
But the people who surround me are my parents
#sigmagrindset
Damm! he left the house faster than my dad
*mario mushroom sound*
Where at tho
Where at tho
Nonono, not like-minded people, supportive people would be the best way to say it. Like-minded may end you up in a so-called echo chamber of opinions. We need some diversity in our relationships.
Lol who says that though? I wish to get a big man like duh?😂
yeah but steroid abuse damages health and looking so buff just looks abnormal
Its simple really, just get into a relationship with your gym bro so you can motivate eachother
daddy noel
I mean, if you don’t like muscular guys, noel might not be your type, which means that you shouldn’t have gone with him at all… and trying to stop someone’s dreams is plain bad
Shit...my mom said that to me 🤥
Wowowow
Now he has more motivation than ever 😈
But I don't hve any friends  Tht means I hve no future???😥😥😥
https://youtube.com/shorts/KC8UGtOFSZo?feature=share
The way he disappear was like how my father buy milk 14 years ago.
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you"  She's the same big as him
Tbf, nothing wrong with knowing what you like lol
Its the towel hat for the female character for me lmao
*What if she wasn't taking about muscle* 😳
Why would any girl not want a man who can defend her LMAO
😲😲😲😲😲😲
Music??
Who don't like jjba looks, cmon
Yeahhhhhhhh more money to spend on Ryse🤣
I thought she said if you don’t get bigger then me leave you
Probably the most humorous ripped guy I have ever seen
This man looks like he could move whole trucks and planes
Bro why you look like if you pressed shifted on the first word with caps lock on 💀
Dude one paper cut on your arm and you are dead
No one in the history of the world has said this 🤣🤣
My gym dad after finding out I’m not fit:
Gets with body builder  Builds body  Hey hey !
It's funny it's when I left I got to the gym never been happier
0:04 dude did the same thing my dad did
Are there actually ppl Like this ?
Yeah, better be a roided incel
I mean, can you blame people for having a type? 😅
Well... I understand her view point, unless she has said with 100% confidence that she finds it unattractive then assume she has been abused in the past or has very bad experience with men especially built men. I get it from your point of view too, idk why ya lift but it's an important thing no? Keep up the good work playa! 🙏🏾💜. It's VERY fucking unfortunate that lots of women have mostly experienced the men juiced up with ego problems throwing their weight around, I'm truth sorry, really I am, but its not even scary at a certain point, it becomes a survival instinct more than anything so. 😐 Happy days tho! ♥
he left like my dad
Nice
What if I’ve no friends?
Dj khalid suffering from success
“If u get any bigger I’ll leave u”  *Takes viagra
I miss her sometimes 😂
roid rage
The voice got me lmao
That's actually bad advice don't surround yourself with like-minded people on all aspects of life that's how you get close minded and unwilling to learn new things
He probably didn't want noel to do steroids anymore
Bro you A real life giggachad
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you"   If only that's what she really said🥲
Her : if you get any bigger I'll leave you Daddy Noel: comes back twice as big* Look at little Karen Jr. Gonna cry?
JESUS MAN CAN SNAP ME IN HALF!
This is hilarious
This is semi-good advice, good for a gym bro and bad for a pizza bro.
Roids ☠️
Jokes on you I don't have friends
"IF YOU GET ANY BIGGER I'LL LEAVE YOU!"  *_doesn't see anything wrong with it_*  *_leaves_*
Mom where is dad?  Mom : Son he went to buy some protein powder but haven't returned  Son : Mom it's bin 20 years 😕
How could anyone want to leave him
I slightly disagree. I don't think the people around you should be like minded but i do think they should support you if your goals are good.
I wanna see what that pre workout is I wanna be like him
What do you mean by bigger…
Dont lie, every guy wants to cuddle this dude
😂😂Damn that was fast
Well yes, but don't exaggerate in the opposite direction. Don't surround yourself with Yes men who either agree with you or are out of the group, allow people you deeply cafe about to challenge your ideas
Well yes, but don't exaggerate in the opposite direction. Don't surround yourself with Yes men who either agree with you or are out of the group, allow people you deeply cafe about to challenge your ideas
Maybe she was just concered about his health
“Tell me your friend and i will tell you who you are.” -Mevlana
Noel is slowly becoming a Baki character
Time for some gear then 😂😂
When my mom said I need to stop working out or I'll look like a boy. NEVER WOMAN. I'll work my ass off till I DIE
Little did she know, she just motivated him
I imagine she wanted to date an actual man, not an inflatable balloon, so I don’t blame her
Literal chad sigma male
Bitch I’m underweight af and I hate it I’m so unfit, I try to eat tons of shit to get bigger, nothing works
Doom slayer but irl
L woman w noel
Crown never fell 👑
Bro didn’t even have to get the milk
very funny😂                 i have no friends
This is a real Chad here who needs a girlfriend when you can become a beast Chad😤😤
Is this the real life Gigachad?
And if you don't have friends? Cuz I'm feeling kinda fucked here bud...
Me:  But I have no friends.  Wait...
Got too big it couldn't fit
no girl has ever said that
That guy regrets losing Noel now
What is ur best recommended protein powder for extreme weight gain
I wonder why. You’ll destroy her cervix u god damn beast of a Chad
“I don’t like men with too many muscles”   “I didn’t get them for you”
Men's really just disappeared like you was getting some milk 🥛💀
Yeah protein shake. right. like you roid dudes actually give a crap about shakes. Right
It seems like something else was getting bigger that's what offended her
The girl : if you get any bigger i will leave you  Meanwhile the girl who is big as his bf
Eyyyyy So Amazing
Lol
Bro leaving Noel would be the stupidest decision ever
whats the song name
Is L-Glutamine good for u
Is fat: *"LOSE WEIGHT"* Is skinny: *"GAIN WEIGHT"* Is muscular: *"GET SMALLER"*
Not cool unless part of this ultimatum involved the intake of growth hormones
This man is pro at push up
Who's edited your video, shout out to your editor yo
Just don’t go on steroids
Ok I’ll show you my friends: “    “
"Daddy went to get the milk, he'll surely return.."        He'll return right?
i have a friend this mf always pushin me we both relatively new to lifting he got mad vein genes
I would love to have muscles but I think after a certain size it starts to look gross imo
POV my dad
Bro don't leave, just don't get bigger........   GET MASSIVE
I have no friends , so no future then ?
Woah, that is one very muscular girl
U motivate me to workout ur the best👍
I thought his leg was a robotic piece??? 😱🤔💀
Sigma male rule 911: do not give up your goal for a hole
Fun and sad fact : I don't have friends
"Oh no,The protein is all gone,imma go get some more *i'll be back soon* "
Why do people want to get that big?? your life is shortened, youre less mobile, you cant scratch your back as good, unnaturally walking around with that much mass just has to be taking a crazy toll on your body
Brro you are a beast
"Show me Your Friends" Bold of You to assume i have Friends
Ny dad leaving to get the milk:
Bye then. Lol
Song name?
If i dont have friends, do i still have a future?
Boner:im about to end this man's whole relationship
Bruh what is that song 💥💥
Humongous strongus giga chadungus 🤯
Bro left in seconds
W
Props to you man for this lifestyle, it's definitely not for me but I have used alot of what you have said to help me with my own goals, thank you
Bruh I'd love a boyfriend who works on his body. That sh!ts hot as hell
Lol! 😂🤣
Jajajaja, he acting like a girl is somethimg else🤣, with how big he is (What's wrong with that girl?!)
Bro ain't no simp
Bro my teacher keeps saying that to my class that saying kinda hits hard for me tho
Bro if I were that girl, I would want to be huge like you (I'm a girl too) I think these huge looks look good in both genders This is my dream
Surround yourself with like minded people, sure, but don't forget to be around people who may disagree with you. Polite disagreements/debates can lead to growth, for either party. Of course when talking about someone threatening to leave you because of something harmless that you enjoy doing, then they can gtfo.
Jesus is coming soon it could be today could be tomorrow if you are not born again you are going to hell a place of eternal suffering and pain but don't be mad I'm just trying to warn to you of whats ahead and what your heading to I'm not trying to force my religion on you God wants relationship not religion not going to church on Sunday will get u to heaven but by doing God's will and having faith, just trying to save your soul Praying for you.Jesus loves you.   love your videos 👋❤
He literally left for buying some milk
She was prolly afraid you would break her
Yes!
Ok but you’re getting so damn big it’s scary. You could crush my skull with one hand.
No matter how big you get Barbella will always be with you
Pov my dad
What if someone don't have any friends 😅
If this man get's dumped he will turn into the incredible hulk
All I've seen are fake friends. Who just care about themselves when one is suffering from depression. Or make him more depressed. And these things are currently taking place in my life.
I know this might be a personal question but. What are your goals?
Bruh one paper cut and u will explode
More like if you take any more crank I’ll leave you
Yeah!! I'm a ghost fool!
It's odd how a girl could actually have something to complain about that XD I am a girl myself and I cannot see the reason for her to do that
Learn to be alone, not everyone will stay forever
Well maybe some people in your life don't want you to get dependent on anabolic steroids and die at 47 but who am I to judge
I don't think this dude can get bigger he's huge!
Him : “Show me ur friends and I’ll show you ur future  Me : shows him nothin Also me : “here r my friends
The girl must be dope to leave for this petty reason ,
Daddy noel went to get the dumbbell   Haven't seen him since
I don’t believe you no one would leave daddy noel
todays rich piana kids who want to be men take massive health destroying steroids. dont do this
enjoy heart failure from roid abuse
take anadrol 50 too meathead
Song?
Why would you leave him. From my extremely introverted perspective i did my analysis and came to the conclusion that this man can give bomb huggs max cuddle area plus he looks very supportive i like that.
Åååh
I love this short SOOOO much.
What's the name of song?It's dope af Plus i support the thought and such life moment,Noel told us in this video Stay strong mentally and get better everybody :)
Disappeared as fast as my dad
Me going through the comments: 😂
N9 disrespect bro but have you taken steriods
If you get any bigger you are gonna get a stand.
Rather be big and lonely? Thats kinda of sad
He ain’t even a Chad— he the full Chadwick
The protein powder mess made me mad and I don’t even lift
What if I don't have friends? @_@
Imagine if he had to hit his kids (if he has any)💀
I LOVE BIG MEN
Wtf is wrong with getting bigger 😭? You get to hug a bear!!!!
You don’t leave Noel, Noel leaves you
Surrounding yourself with like minded people is also a way to become toxic
Bruh that girl that said that needs a reality check
Im all for your self improvement in any direction. I want to be bigger myself, but I dont want to hit the gym or bother worrying constantly about what diet I have. However, I do eat big, exercise sometime, and I drink my fair share of beer. Gut, guns, and relaxation.   The same for anyone body building, you set a goal for what you personally like and if people don't like it, they're not worth your time, move them aside, share that they're concerned but press that it is  your body you are in control of. No one elses.
"Opposites attract"
One of many Adios moments
Love u Noel
you’ve seen a true sigma male movement
his head looks super small.   for shaaaammeee
Show me your friends, and I'll show you your future.... but I don't have any friends. So...
You are the people you hang around with. Facts. I love this guys honesty!
She was just upset because you occupy most of the bed
Yesss bro
I bet this dude is bigger than the Rock
I mean the research states the more ripped you are the more women stay away because it implies conceit
Damn this man left like my dad went to get milk from the grocery store
“If you get any bigger, I won’t have any bed room.”
Yo what the fuck this man could probs lift himself up
Well I have nothing against building muscle and training but I also wouldn't date someone that big if I was a girl it just seems to much at some point
i'm now in thos situation
I u get bigger I leave thanks for the motivation
Bro hit her with the UNO reverse so that HE can be the one to leave her.
😳
based noel
Daddy Noel has spoken
I'm sure I needn't say this but take what Noel says with a pinch of salt.  Being surrounded by like minded people can be great for support but can also make you close minded and unable to introspectively critique yourself properly. As with all things, moderation is key.
Anybody know the background song?
Imagine leaving this absolute artwork of a man.
He's like: Not if I leave You before!
The way he disappears from the door reminds me of my dad
My guy🔥🔥😎😎
XD
He like u cant leave when I leave first
Peace ✌️
Real gigachad
Man dipped like my dad 🤣
*appears back*  "Ohh!forgot this is my house .GET OUT!!"
Bigger in what size?
I had a girlfriend who told if I get any hotter she would leave me. Then my alarm went off and she disappeared. Guess I'm hot as hell
Well, was she concerned about the steroid use?
You are wrong but right. The advice: Surround yourself with like-minded people can be very harmful and stupid. People can get hurt or killed.
“That support you”   Boi you supported my nut bustin
Man just turned into my dad
I have no friends so I have no future ?
Mmmmmm
"And that there kids, is how I murdered someone"
He left faster than my dad for the milk
"Bet"
Daddy?
I hang out with the boys and we fruity
chad
Did she mention body? 😳 Or did she mean something else?😏
He looks like a big guy that ate a small guy and the small guy is trying to escape
my guy left faster then my dad getting milk
me with zero friends am i good ?
When she wants you to stop shortening your lifespan by abusing drugs 🙄
Daddy i don't have any friends
I’m not someone who’s attracted to muscly people, but I agree, be surrounded by supporters not haters
Women: “I want a big strong man that can protect me when I need help and make me feel safe” Also women: “If you get any bigger or stronger I’ll leave you”
Has happened, it was awful but chose gym lmaooo
Get out my king nobody deserves to have their dreams shit on.
You had me at the start, we outta here boys🦸
My friends? Oh no nono I don't think you can handle those pricks, they are literally the pinnacle of stupidity, weirdness and being an asshole, they are all absolutely racist, sexist and many more, those guys literally have every single bad thing you could ever think of inside of them BUT and it's a big BUT they're pretty supportive and cool nonetheless
He ain’t a simp
I don't have friends now show me my nonexistent future
Fair play ur big af man that serious dedication welldone
Yo,  that's your house.
If any one’s wondering , the last phrase about showing your friends and I’ll show you your future, it’s from the Bible 🤗
Man was like:I am gonna need 2 beds just for me after this
Idk man that bottle shake was very sus.    Amogus
If i had friends
Bro left faster than my dad
My boy said :bet
Need no friends.
He went looking for milk, but for real man I respect
Personally I believe if this actually happened it would be okay she is just saying she prefers someone who isn't huge and would likely prefer someone smaller, so if they don't want you to do something about your body that they may not like don't be mad respect that they personally would rather not date someone like that because they may not be attracted to it though I may not know much about it  Edit:basically I'm saying if they don't like it then you don't have to stay but don't be mad at them for out unless they are super adamant and rude about it yknow
What's the songgggg
“If you get any bigger I’ll leave you” triples in size
This also happened to me
Do you have any good workouts for new people
Dayum dat woman couldn’t handle chadness
Bro the more to hug 🫂
I don’t get why people would want you to not get bigger I’m surprised they didn’t want a big muscled guy
"If you get bigger,I will leave you"  B@tch, 2 can play that game
Imagining noel as any smaller than he is now is, for lack of a better term, weird
my friends all fat or Hella slim while I'm the only one tryna get buff and they all support me .
this guy got testosterone
That was so funny that impression
My friend was like:- Oh Hell Naw
Trying to relate
I got no friends
justice for targeted individuals
Look at all those bigs man. I bet you can camping on top of that 🥺
leave them before they leave you
to be honest my girlfriend is like this except with my wrestling career. she doesn’t quite say she’ll leave me but she always brings me down because i put so much effort and my passion into wrestling
This guy admitted to using steroids. That’s gonna catch up with him eventually
The hair mascara is top notch!!
thank god im 60kg
Don’t blame her
Real sigma move
Seeeeeee ya🙃
I would love to swing on his arms
How could someone leave daddy noel tho?
So she made him gay?
Song name?
If i see you crush like that Am better leave man 💀 Look at that Muscle
you disappeared like my dad
When anyone gives you an ultimatum, always do the opposite just by principle alone.  Giving in would be the worst possible course of action, because it encourages future ultimatums.
Noel: Show your friends and i'll show your future Me with literally any friend whatsoever: 🙂
To be honest, I dont want to be too big but what can i say when i hv big bone😅
They were probably just worried about your health taking all that gear
Holy shit I had a coach that said that and I’ve never heard it anywhere else until now.
M8 can u get bigger?
Damn this reminded me of my dad
If I ever start working out it will be to stay fit cause it would suck to become skinny after building muscle and having stretched skin
"Fvck this bi**h im out
Your making me bigger 😩
Slackers don't like to see other people making progress. It makes them self-evaluate.
wow
Translation: I don’t think all these steroids are good for you
Imagine how long the man's neck would be if he didn't have those traps.
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future" I would....if I had friends
Happened to me which is why I quit becasue my parents were intentionally nky buying meat just to make sure I aoudnt increase my wheight despite telling them that I need to because of my fast metabolism
What are u getting bigger..
Getting bigger
Ain’t no point of getting that big tho
Bro I could fit between his shoulders
Literally my mom doesn't want me taller i m 6ft right now and in India its very tall but my mom starts yelling when i do pull ups
I just bought a gym membership and kinda need some tips, i weigh 125 and have never worked out a gym before but i work out at home. if anyone has any tips thanks.
I mean… can you blame her? Who wants to be crushed by their partners gigantic muscles during sex? You know what…
Backstory of my dad
I’d honestly like a tall muscular bf like that. The bigger they are, the better there hugs are.
Honestly good on you.
This man's comedy is on point. 😂
If folks don't like you for who you are to hell with em
I want to hug this man
well, it was her choice, good for her that she didnt want to be with person she dont like look of bruh, and good for you too
When her name is Felicia 😂
Can’t let women bring you down. Ben with this girl 5 years and my work is hard and time consuming but I do it so we always have $ and she doesn’t like that I work so she broke up with me. Oh well, she even admitted it’s going to be hard to find a good man. Good on you.
Like my father
LOL 10/10 background story
Why would anyone want to hinder that kind of progress? It's not up to them to decide how you live your life.
Bozo : if you get any bigger *i’ll leave you* Bozo : *gets left*
Adios
"If you get any bigger ill leave you" Noel : understandable , have a great life.
Keep up the grind bro
Do what U want but why aren't girls allowed to speak their mind about it
Me who doesnt have friends
Thats way too funny. Peace sign I'm out BIOOOTCH!😂
She was just worried you'll get bigger muscles but smaller where it actually matters to her lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Guess i have not future.
He just pulled my dads move.
What self respecting gay man gets with Noel Deyzel and says "Nah, I actually don't like bara daddies?" What did he think he was getting into?
That's such a vain and petty thing to end a relationship over though
I don’t know why but for some reason he sounds like billy from adventure time this is a complement btw
"If you'll get any big I'll leave you" Herself, being an absolute beast.
I don't have any friends, actually. Does that mean, I got no future😂💀
Oh shot
You forgot the milk, daddy
Don't need to be that big my man.
Shows Noel my friends Noel: But there’s nothing. Me: I know
Challenge accepted!
I am surrounded by murderers.
We aint simps
*gets bigger and leaves without any hesitations
damn no friends no future
Now imagine being this big and abusive
I have no friends I guess no future
GF : IF U GET ANY BIGGER I WILL LEAVE U ALSO HIS GF : ALREADY BIG
Day 2 of asking about tips on loosing weight
Imagine leaving someone like Noel, literally 0 IQ
WHAT’D SHE SAY!!!!
i love you
Why tho what's wrong with being an absolute unit
"show me your friends and I tell you your future" I have no friends. What is my future?
idk much about noel but i thought i saw something about him being gay,wasn’t it a man that warned him of that?Why got a chick in the video. I hope i wasn’t wrong about the gay thing i just remember seeing something.
I’m not one who’s super into fitness, I try to be healthy in general but seeing ur channel and how much you educate and inform such things as body positivity to all people no matter what makes me smile :)
I mean she has a point. Imagine trying to climb that mountain of a man every day for a good by kiss
she should of known you wante dto get bigger id leave you the first day you went to the gym ..some females are too much
Also, be open with each other from the beginning.  This sort of thing doesn’t happen out of the blue…
Why people like you always hold their arms like that? Bigorexia?
"If you get any bigger, I'll leave you"  NOEL: FRANKLY, MY DEAR, I DON'T GIVE DAMN.
Male detected.Opinion accepted
I'm sorry, but please be more clear with your previous situation. Did they leave you because you were taking steroids to progress yourself, or was it straight up she didn't want you to go to the gym so much and/or didn't like you getting bigger? This feels to be in poor raste without further explanation.
Is that why you gotta pretend your own girl to make the video?
Noel, I got no friends.. What's my future?
Your life is your life, not someone else's, if you wanna be big, get big
I dont have any friends. So  imma be lonely in future😥😥
“Surround yourself with likeminded people” Me looking at my family, how much friends i have and my mental state: is it that easy?
If I put tape in the high middle of your back Will you be able to move it 🤔
But what if you dont have friends? That means i have no future?   Thanks
I would probably say the same your so big it doesn’t look natural and it looks bad lol

Dude. You ex was buff af
Well he can fking lift a buss
Gigachad
Show me your frends ill show you your future  This is quiet true
This mf has everyones respect on the internet, including me brother
"Don't worry kid, you'll grow into it".  You sure did, really inspirational >:)
True, a woman that doesnt want to support her Boyfriend/ Husband because she feels intimidated by his goals and focus, is a woman that wants to have you small so she can control you. This surely doesnt go for all woman, but for many who act like this.
Girls that don't like substance abusers will go, girls that also inject fillers and Botox will stay. You gotta know what kind of girls do you prefer in the first place, or no girls at all.
Maybe in reality she was aware of the steroid use and was trying to make him stop
God bless...
Good God this guy is jacked
Zyzz moment
Daddy Noel W
The reason females will say because they dont want their man to be too attractive ... The reason is because she will get insecure and know that there will be better options u will attract..
😳what if I don’t have any friends…?
Sorry to say this, but he reminded me of Austin Wolf 👀👀
Noel: Show me yo friends, I show you your future Me: but i have no friendz Noel: Exactly
what if i dont have friends? does it mean i have no future?
He pulled a John Cena
My friends are my right and left hand. How's my future looking like? 😏
Finally a big guy who doesn't skip leg day
Never had a problem with men getting bigger, just smaller.😏
I'm scared he could smash my head with his hands ;-;
“Show me your friends and I’ll show you your future”   My dad always said this as a kid and it’s the single most important piece of advice I have ever followed
Sigma male grindset#37902  If she says you're getting too big, disregard the females, do steroids and bulk out until you're competing in Mr gay south Africa.
Damn the MGS alert sound really did remain relevant even nowadays
Not gonna lie but he kinda look like Broly from  DBZ (no offense if any taken )
Damm he ain't no simp
Anybody that threatens you away from the things you like to do because THEY don't like, is nobody you need in you life.
Ok dady 😊😊😊
my bjj partner once told me that he would leave me if I did not show any progress or any effort, that literally pushed me a lot and now Im one of the best trainee at the camp
Had the reverse happen. I said this to last exgf and she left me too when she died from complications due to morbid obesity. She really showed me.
i have no friends
That's such a flex of an issue to have
He so goddamn chaddy that a partner has to leave him because he is such a chad
if you get someone as big as noel, you can literally put tv remote on his chest so it wont get lost
Yeah noel has a clone I'm sure of it
The literal biggest mistake of her life
Yo this song slaps what’s the name?
honestly if i woman and have bf as big as noel i'll leave too
the bigger a man becomes , the smaller his pp. can't blame her tho
They didnt support his steroid usage lmao
Man disppared just like my dad
Song?
But she’s big as him. 😭
Said nobody lol  Get SWOLE
Lol
I mean, it's not her fault anyways, both have the right to live with a partner with similar goals. That's why some things should be said before dating
Yeahhh
Lol
You look like a jojo character
Bro pls be a Wrestler I wanna see you in da wwe
Someone who don't have friends 👀
It's hard to find likeminded people
1
Did she actually leave you?
Lol I bet he calls this one your dad
What friends?
✌
I’ve only gotten more compliments since I’ve decided to eat more and get more muscle instead of trying to cut.
Her: "If YoU gEt AnY bIggeR I'lL leAvE YoU!" Steve: Now I'll get bigger even harder
Never have I every heard that type of attitude...
Must be taking about getting bigger down there and frankly i cant blame her.
Noel do your normal voice bruh
💀
as if getting bigger is so so healthy
but you’ll also die of heart failure at an unreasonably early age so… maybe it was just care?
When your so *swole* that you gf is gonna leave you:  "I have won, but at what cost?"
Hes like hulk but being green man takes years
well, I dont have friends
What she means is...if you get any more atrophy she'll leave you....HCG my friends...  Oh wait.....
That 🙍🏻‍♂️✌️ got me weak😂
As a woman am confused.
Sigma move
That’s the best motivation
Did you get the milk went you go out?
Dude chairs break the bed bends the wallets suffer
That's funny....on the flip side, men seem to do this all the time to women. When she puts on weight, they disappear or cheat 🤦
Why is it universally accepted now for the females in skits like these to wear a towel? lol!!!
She said i would leave you  So the question is NOEL why are you going out of your house
What song is playin??
Chiaotzu: But, Tien, the doctor said if your shoulders get any bigger...  Tien: That's why we don't see him anymore.
Legend
You know what I even gonna try harder
C H A D
My gf also tells me as such
his reaction: Oh my time has come, see ya!
Luckily I have a boyfriend we’re we both want to get bigger the support is real💪🏾
"Ill just stop taking asteroids" -some guy who used to use asteroids
and if she gets "bigger" you wont leave hm?
She was probbaly talking about the steroids but eh
I ain’t got no friends 😳😳😳
This dude is IRL Giga Chad
I entirely support what he's saying but "surround yourself with like-minded people" is _exactly_ what pyramid schemes say 😂
him: already there bud
Bro did the dad trend
I completely understand not wanting your partner to have a certain physique just like I understand not wanting yourself to have a certain physique, but there are much better ways to handle that than ultimatums.
Tell me who your FRIENDS r And I'll TELL you who you are 🤝
I love this
She was hot 🔥
Happened to me as well but im fat
Hate when this happens… their loss…
The guy just say, im sorry i cant be your man she a fcking fan
Him: if you get even bigger I'll leave you! What i heard: you can't get it bigger I'll leave you 💀
I don't have friends. Don't care for them. Just do me.
Noel i dont have friends because mr bean taught me a life lesson that you dont need friends for your life to be fun
I don’t get why girls think it’s okay to make threats about leaving to get what they want lol, it’s toxic manipulative behavior 101.
she meant the D bro lol
Shity attitude but the facts is a lot a woman don't like overly muscular men. Food for thought
Why would anybody leave this Greek God is beyond me!
When he said show me your freinds show me your future that is from Dan pena
What woman in her right mind would want to leave such a fun, wise and hardworking man based on muscle mass? Noel, you'll find the right woman who'll appreciate you and all the good your capable of if you haven't already 😊❤️
Noels Girl is fiiine tho who is she😳
My idol's smile is all I need to keep up with my goals as a martial artist fighter
A breakup is the best pre workout  in the world
Babe, I think we ran out of milk
Dude😂... that was dayummm!!!!
Girls taste changes so much they either want buff men , or skinny ass men like a toothpick
This guys heart isnt gonna thank him later lol
Love your Channell!
She missed out lol
Bros before hoes even in the bedroom 😎
Yeah, reverse the roles. If he says it to her, she’d lose her effin mind.
Was expecting daddy Noel to hit the griddy for a sec there
I love how women assume we get big to impress them... that was sarcasm
👌
Sus friends. Does that mean im a pxrnstar?
Based
“If you get any bigger, I’ll leave you”  My Mind: “just the Motivation I need💪🏿”
I thought he was gay?
Surround yourself with yes men?
BUT NOELL I DONT HAVE FRIENDS:c
You left faster than my dad.
Or not. I don't 100% disagree but I don't agree either. I'm strongly convinced you don't need to stay with likeminded people only, if they care and you care you'll come to an understanding and that's fine. If you sorround yourself with people who thinks just like you do, you'll eventually become stagnant or convinced that your way is the only one. This is also a point to take into consideration.
Your girl telling you she’ll leave you if you get any bigger is like your math teacher telling you he’ll give you an f if you get any smarter. It’s just not fair to punish hard work.
I dont have  friends so that means i will have no future to?
I mean she wont leave if a certain part get bigger
Her friends asking her "Are you disabled?"
My man pulled out the fastest drink-making in human's history
WTF
People should stop getting motivated by shame
Wow Noel I don't know you were also a magician! You just turned yourself into my dad!
I love all your videos
Man i love the piece sign hahaha
Was it undertoning your steroid use or was it literally just an objection to muscle size?
Lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i mean if your goal is to get big to the detriment of your girlfriend or wife is your ultimate goal than yeah but if not I'd sacrifice getting bigger or any other thing. to me a partner is not something I can just dump for another one that likes a bigger me   also surrounding yourself (only) with likeminded people is not wise in my opinion
Surround yourself with likeminded people, but don’t surround yourself with people who positively reinforce bad habits/practices.
how can this chad be so serious and memeful at the same time..
Whats the Song?
danggggggg
I agree with the sentiment, but also not every "goal"  should be "supported."
what a sigma male
They were just telling you the truth though. Which is fine.
Cant blame the partner who doesn't want bigger partner It takes 2 to make the relationship If both of u r not willing to sacrifice your goal or likings,its probably not even love Better to break up and find a person who doesnt care or has a common goal Love is when u cant leave the person even if u see so many flaws or toxic behaviour,yet u cant leave knowing its wrong.Its like an addiction Not an ultimatum
I support you and will uplift you towards your goals 💜
Me on my way to get bigger :
Lmao.
Emotional blackmail and shaming you for your hobby and your goals. That's a nope for me.
What need to be bigger
I dont need friends who always tell me i am right
But make sure you don’t surround yourself with yes-men, and you’ll be set for good.
Girls dont want you to be small but be bigger now they dont want you to be bigger like bruh? 🤨🤨
Bro, I finally found my gym bro 😎
So either we stay together: that's good Or you leave me: this means I got bigger which is even better
If she will stop you from going to the gym she will stop you from doing anything enjoyable.  She don't want a man, she wants a slave to control
Imagine his ex watching this lmao 💀
Me : **exist** My dad :
Why wouldn’t someone want an absolute mountain 😂😂😂
How did he show up twice in the same frame? When his gf was taking to him
No, YOU'RE gonna leave her
Gay
Girls: "i won't date anyone under 6 foot" Also girls: "you're too big, i'm taking the kids"
"Show me your friends and I show you your future." Me: *has no friends*
If a feemale says this, it's because of competition anxiety. She finds you attractive, but she doesn't want you to become more attractive because, in her head, that means more vvomen will be all over you. And she doesn't want to, or thinks she can't compete with those vvomen. So, she breaks it off first so she can have that sense of power and control that comes with that.
It's just that your partner gets tired easily with just a few pumps from you. If you get any bigger your partner would be dead.
Song name?
Bro what’s ya body fat sitting at rn?
BORA TOMA UM PÓ
guys here's the truth and the bad side of working out, don't get bigger get stronger 💪
Can you share a picture of yours before you start gym???
He was like : " alright, have a good time"😂
Just one question? How much was the speeding ticket on the way outttt 😎✌️
That's why I walk on this journey alone and I am ok with that.
Ty this helped
I actually just got out of a relationship Where my gf kept telling me not to get too big. Lol
Yes, i found another Giga Chad's     Dont act me wrong, i know gigchad doesn't exist but Giga Chad's exist bruh
This man scares me but also inspires me.
“Get bigger and I’ll leave you”  Noel be like  “Do you think I give a shit?”
jokes on you, i like them big.
My wife is the polar opposite, she doesn't care of its fat or muscle as long as I'm big, I'm over here trying to keep it in line and not gain anymore weight and I'm stuck at fuckin 270 because of the way I lift lol
"surround yourself with like-minded people" is not a good statement, especially on the internet. If someone is trying to hold you back with their views, that's when it's too much.
Ok there's 2 types of getting bigger.. Which are you talking about? 🤔
I'm the strongest in a group of 10..
But,, the bigger the muscle the better the hug??? I love big and bulky guys and girls. I'm 5 feet and trying to bulk up too but for now I just like admiring those around me.
that smile before the disappear😫😂
Are you from South Africa
Does that mean no friends = no future?😥
Leave her she's been using to much test.
Goes both ways. Lol
His reaction: im outta her
I have no friends...
Sigma noel
This guy looks like he could throw me through a metal wall
Rather experience real love than this shallow bullshit anyday
🤩🔥
man, man.
Damn bruh went to go get the muscle milk
I'd say surround yourself with good people with similar values. But I also love hanging out with people who are different than me.
These are how circlejerks are created. Terrible advice
Name of the song?
Sorry I can’t show you things that don’t exist
well depends how ppl put it. My ex said I was that girl. But in truth I told him to stop exercising until the doctor gives him the clear because he trained on a injury and got injured twice. The doctor said a nother injury might be fatal. because he already at that point had permanent damage to the shoulder.  Btw he can't lift anything anymore with his left arm, like not even a pen withoutbeing in pain. Listen to doctors and loved ones. We don't mean any harm.
You telling me there's a man out there that didn't want daddy Noel (😩) to get bigger?
Your face has me dead daddy Noel🤣🤣
Omg so cute!! That smile!
So if I've got no friends, I've got no future?  Thanks Noel!
“Show me your friends and i will show you your future” He has friends?
Damn  Noel that girl is shredded.
Jokes on you i don't have friends...
To be fair, you were taking steroids. Its a drug, and maybe your 'goal' was seen as unhealthy from your female friends. Too much of anything is bad. For example, you have a great muscular physique. Everyone would want that. Bit tje doenside of the physique is, it will be hard to find clothes that fit you. Jeans won't fit you. Certain winter jackets won't either.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCFpqDwZvHNz_n8RrniTtTIQ
I agree with everything apart from like-minded people. Best lessons I've learned are from people with different thinking patterns and abilities than mine
Where do you get friends like that :/
Interestingly no one is talking about when the tables are turned. I, a woman, was also also told this by an ex boyfriend and everyone agreed with him.
*Don't worry guys,Daddy Noel just gonna buy some protein milk*
I kind of disagree with not listening to their partner's wishes. In a relationship, it is 2 people. Two opinions and two different wishes. I'm not saying you should be manipulated, but you should not block your partner's wishes either. Especially if you are the man in the relationship.In today's society, one is told that one should always take one's wishes and needs first, this is going to ruin many relationships. The truth is, if you are going to have a long term partner, you must be willing to adapt to your partner's desires. Take it from someone who has been married for a long time.
She indirectly wants him to stop steroids
Ultimatums. Literally blackmail. Do what i want or else.
My girl actually said that😂😂
What is the protein powder you use I want to know
Every last one that brought up steroids from a simple fucking message is a certified clown. The fat acceptance club is somewhere else 👉🏼 🚪
This is correct 👌
How are you so ripped
Get bigger man
Bro, u have my attitude. Ultimatums r a reason to leave, or make them. Never, ever, ever fold. U will be washing her boyfriends car soon
Me who has no friends... So I have no future
What girl doesnt want a man with muscles?!
Next time do the griddy in the end please?????
What about if you have no friends lol asking for a friend
The packing beat montage at 00:02is lit.
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you" I think he maxed out his stats already
zyzz: thats ma boy, brah
ig now you're a daddy in multiple ways :c
"if you get any bigger i'll leave you"  thanks for the motivation  *works out even more*
what is your goal? to be big?
Lol well.. maybe she was about QUALITY over quantity.  I mean.. we all know a big butt on a gal doesn't always mean a NICE butt right?  Unless you know, you're into CELLULITES, I don't judge.
Noel for President
I would never leave you daddy Noel, please notice me senpai
ill go get some milk brb
noel gives good advice, but i respectfully disagree this time. Do not surround yourself with like-minded people. You will create a safe circle and never know if what you're doing could be wrong since they always support you. Have a mixed group, always see other perspectives instead of closing yourself up. But of course in this case of toxicity, its best to leave them.
"If you get bigger I'll leave you" * Turns bigger than a Jojo character *
she said it to me and actually left a few months later
question, how big is too big for you? Because there is a limit for sure (?)
'if get any bigger I'll leave you'  Noel: EAT BIG TO GET BIG BABY
Why are we like this?…I just don’t understand
You look like escanor
I dont have friends
Song name
Dady noel
My friends tell me "Get a bit thinner". What's my future?
bro forgot the syringe
Woman only care that 1 thing is big on you      Its your wallet
I would never leave you daddy 😍😍😍
So become a crackhead and become friends with them
I love you too
I'll get so big that you won't be able to leave my gravitational pull.
This guy looks really lean.
I mean it's the same idea as a guy not wanting to be with a fat woman no?
I have no friends  I can't speak with people
He just went to buy milk after she said that
Its ok for people to leave you, but its not ok for you to leave what you're doing in order to achieve something u wanted to
Jokes on him, I got no friends
He ain't missing that opportunity
what about yes men
cute girl
Dont worry brah; there are many other bearded 300 Pound towel-on-the-head-wearing Bodybuilder Chicks out there!
Tbf everyone is entitled to their own preferences. Also when you're unnaturally big this can become a health problem, so I kind of understand that point of view
Shes dumb  Daddy noel is the best 😳
Goals and dreams . .this is what steroid users call goals...?
Lmfao took me around x 8 times to see your cosplay is a small towel on your head 🤣🤣🤣
I mean she got a point Noel, steroids have long lasting impact to your health,
"If you get any big I'll leave you " Daddy Noel- NANNII??!!
I can understand if it's about being obsessive about the gym and your personality changing but if it's just physique then that's just cruel.
Song in background?
You have to understand there are different cases. Sometimes people mean well especially when your on gear In a relationship.
Man left his girl faster than my dad
Last girlfriend I dated said it was her or the gym. The gym and I are getting married.
I've No friends So No future ?
I don’t see anything wrong with this, people just have preferences. I’m not saying you need to tolerate it, if you don’t like it then fuck it and go, but I just think that kinda stuff is a preference. I actually had to break off a relationship with a girl once because she was the same way with me boxing
Bigger where, exactly??? She wasn't specific enough 🙄
0:02 the look 😩😂😂😂😂😂😂
'Show me your friends I'll saw you your future'  Me with No friends - You cant predict my future I am in a another league
“If you get any bigger i’ll leave you” I’m pretty sure it had to do more with the gear you were doing but ok man
i don’t get why people think like that its very toxic.  Making people choose between them (your girlfriend/boyfriend/partner/friend) and your interests/hobbies/pets. It doesn’t make any sense. If it was me in this situation I wouldn’t be anti bigger muscles id be hella pro bigger muscles like noel looks so great and cool with big muscles and if they got bigger? even better 😳
Now try this exactly same phrase with a woman and see the world burn.
His GF prbly didn't like the PEDs lol. Can't blame her.
I really thought he was going to show his weenie for no reason 🤣
Nice
The song choice is top notch Noel 🔥💯🦵🏾💪🏾🙏🏾
My ex husband used to tell me if you keep drinking that pre-workout  im. gonna leave you!!!! 😆  best thing ever happened  to me.
How big is Noel?
"This actually happened to me once." Okay but wasn't it a dude who said that?
well, what if i have absolutly zero friends
Ummm I said this to my last two girlfriends. They said the same thing you did and now I watch them on the 600 pound club.
For the streets 🤷🏻‍♂️
This guy at the beginning! 🤣
Man the thing is having that much muscle isnt good for your body. If you aint making your money out of it why to do it?? You are talking about 1 side and not the other...
My ex once told me that.
It depends if they worry about your health and steroid use please take that seriously
"Show me your friends and i will show you your future''....hmm i guess i have no future then..
😂
Background song?
im genuinely surprised his voice can go that high when he sounds like testosterone incarnate naturally
Somehow he looks smaller when playing the girl
Noel living up to the "Daddy" title, he event went out to buy some milk! Wonder when he'll come back.
I mean, if i am a woman and my husband wants to be much muscular, i wouldn't mind and definitely wants that curvy muscle in my husband body. (Just me sharing my mind tho)
"You don't leave the sigma, the sigma leaves you"
Her: get any bigger and I'll leave u Him: I'm glad we can come to a mutual understanding.
Later dude, lmao
I have no friends like actually.
Bye Felicia!
Um wat? Lol. Who would say that?
Brah imagine losing someone like daddy noel.
Girls only want skinny guys and can’t respect a dude who can protect her 😭😭
i mean if my wife is as big as noel then i dont mind leaving
"Show me your friend's and I'll show you your future"💯💯💯
This is pretty logic. You don’t livr for others
Have friends who stop u from taking steroids
Steroid addict Lmao
This is true but you know what use her game back to her. Tell her she can't do this and that or it will go against what she's been trying to control you with. If she can't do what you enforce then do exactly what she doesn't like you to do if she bitch about it just tell her she is a hypocrite and can't even do what she promise she will do. It's a win win if both can keep what they're trying to enforce on each other
Yeah surround yourself with people who tell you to inject more steroids into your body.. that's ought to do it right?
Big is good😆
Dumb women a man that big can select a women easily
My ex compared me with her partner before me behind my back and said he had a more attractive body. So I pump now for 3 months and already got my first achievements. Now I feel better and hope to see her never again
He left so fucking fast-
She then realised she was pregnant.
0:05 me after knocking my wife up
I'm grateful she didn't stick around. Mentally I'd be very unstable to have called her mommy Noel after hearing this.
while this is a good mindset, the risk of getting into an echo chamber should be something to be even more afraid of
I didnt tell this to my dad but he did the same thing at the door
https://youtu.be/Eq1MTa9zi-Y At 2:07, What I Think When I See You
He left like my dad but not sooner
Except I have no friends
Daddy Noel went to get that milk for the unborn son
You forgot to double scoop
Me with no friends: Well, fuck.
If only she knew...
Same happened to my dad, never came back.
If you get any bigger I'll leave you  Baby, you're bigger than me, that just can't be
What size shirt do you wear?
Nope never happened to me And my fiance really loves that  i workout and support me in everything
Jesus loves you
The only appropriate response
Yeha too big you look deformed and I don’t want to sleep with a brick
I don’t think someone’s bad for saying they don’t want their partner to be huge and jacked, I reckon most guys watching this would tell their gf’s they’d leave them if they started getting super fat it’s just what you want in your partner and most girls don’t really fancy hulks even if other gym bros fancy you for being huge
"If you get any bigger, ill leave you" Daddy Noel: "That a promise?"
She actually meant if you don't get any bigger i'll leave you thefore motivating him to become bigger so he doesn't get abandoned
You're the reason why I started bodybuilding.
"Show me your friends, and I'll show you your future."  Me who has no friends: ...
That was pretty much my reaction when my ex said that 🤣
I am just confused
**finnaly an opportunity**
Say that to a woman and see what happens
I felt this. I have no friends thus no future.
my goal is to pull eren but not just 80%
I guess she likes em small 😔✊🏽
so that means having no friends mean no future
what if i dont have friends
you have no future. All body builders like you are dead by the time they're 50.
based noel
Be the big king you wanna be. That's what I say.
No wonder his pump addiction make him sigma male
I don’t have any friends
Bro do the "im pregnant " move
Her: if you get any bigger I leave you Daddy Noel: sayonara bitch
Dan Peña is the ultimate godfather of NO BULLSHIT! 👍
Peace ✌️
Based Noel
Sounds like complement
My wife doesn't even look at me or want me  what ever size I am I was 18+ stone obese  and she wouldn't  look at me or want me felt like I didn't excist and now I've lost 6 stone got healthier she still won't look at me or want me sometime I wonder what I've done to wrong to be constantly ignored and neglected or is this just  normal in a relationship
my friend with absolute beast powerlifter genetic like he deadlift 120kg in his third month and geuss what he want to be a runner btw he weigh 90kg
Show this to my friend who said this was the shortest and most motivational video he ever seen.
Daddy
Song name ?
Daddy Noel you're such an inspiration
Bro built like part 1>3 jojo charechter
It doesn’t matter what friends you pick they all just use you and are going to die eventually
Confirmed a nonsimp
At the end of the day you can be married to a wife or the gym.  Guess you chose gym.  Gotta say, it's pretty telling how many of your fans are like "I have no friends."  Maybe your lifestyle isn't the best option for finding actual love and happiness?
and thats how millions of obese people got divorced for getting big
That is good advice but also make sure you don't surround yourself with an echo chamber(people who only have the same opinions as you), as that can be bad for you.
Friends equals future? I’ve got friends that are into all kinds of different stuff from hockey to dungeons and dragons so I don’t even know what my future is then.
U look to gross I imagine she wouldn’t be attracted to you anymore if you got any bigger which is totally valid
People ain’t obligated to stay with you if you start to become unattractive to them when this type of stuff starts to happen it’s best to call it a day If a girl I’m with suddenly turns into a whale I’m not staying nor will i care if that hurts her feelings my preferences are my preferences it’s the same way for everyone
No friends. 😭 No future. 🤡
Is that powder the new Ryse Godzilla pre workout? Mine arrives the 29th:)
Noel: Show me your friends. Me: Ok...
He left her like how her dad did
Wait, y’all have friends?
Peace out!! Ha lol
Hey man.   I’m a pretty big guy, I’m not massively overweight but I’m getting there. I want to start building muscle etc but I really don’t know where to begin in getting motivated. What do you recommend? I don’t enjoy my size and I’m relatively strong I’d just like to ‘show’ it. Cheers.
Nothing wrong with that.  Most girls find it unattractive so can't expect them to stay.
i tought ur gay. How could that happen with a girl?
Your ex girl arms crazy
So this is what cardio is for
Surround yourself with people who outlift your goals. So you can always strive to beat them
yeah keep growing ... your heart will  get there one day, then it will fail because it cant deal with that mass, and you probably never do ANY cardio. Good luck broski
This is dumb. Stay with her till she leaves, that way you know you got bigger.
Song? :x
i need to know the song playing in the background
What if its your heart telling you that? ATTACK
Honestly it sounds like something someone would say put of care rather than disrespect,There is from what iv gathered quite few complications to use juice and one mutiple of these complications are heart related.but i wasnt there so i couldnt tell you
Answer me a VERY serious question: Are you a metal gear fan?
"If you get any bigger, I'll leave you" "Well I guess it's goodbye then"
Girl: if you get any bigger I’ll leave you  Also girl:  Is exactly as big as Noel
i’m the type of friend who says your looking small when your trying to get bigger
"Show me your friends..."  Me: [insert John travolta looking around meme]
Lol later babe
I would not mind having sexy muscle man as my lover, I'll stand by him no matter what. <3
Daddy Noel can actually start a religion
“If you get any bigger, I’ll leave you!” *Understandable, have a nice day* ✌️
Glad to know I'm  not the only one that leaves the gym floor covered in Pre-workout powder 🤣
I have no friends i always like to life with my family and think always for bunch of money 🤣🤣
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you!" Should just reply with "same"
but make sure they arent too like minded. if you and your friends think in almost the same way, you can easily get detached from reality and alienate other people
Disgusting. I'm so happy for her.
i asked my girlfriend if she liked me with abs or not, she responded with ill support you with whatever decision you decide on
Toxic Friends 🙄. They envy at you. They Drag you Down . #crabmentality.
Impressive, very nice! Now let see paul Allen's reaction
Hard 🔥
*starts doing tren*
I mean if its fat then yeah OK but muscle?
I always loved your motivations but this is just 100% bullcrap. This thinking leads to lone, trust me cause i used to think like this. If you want to be a desirable individual then you should consider other's feelings and try to talk thing out and come to an agreement instead of just going "you dont like my choice therefore i dont like you". In this situation just try to make them understand why you want to get bigger and talk instead of immediately cutting them off
Was it that dude hating on side tricep?
It's cool that you read your comments and reply to them i remember you replying to the comment with everything that happened in this video keep it up
Me at lunchtime: ✌🏻😊
"if you get bigger I will leave you" What's the catch?
Lol she lost daddy noel
The amount of zyzz mentality in the first 5 seconds
The voice you did 🤣🤣💯💯
This happened to me but the other way round I was overweight and lost 6 stone and she dipped never looked back.
a lot of people think going to gym is just building muscle so they dont care and misjudge you. for me its being healthy, physically & mentally. its like my meditation. it relieve stress & help u stay positive
Maybe she said: stop doing All the Steroids or your heart shuts up before 40, this makes you an inkompetible Partner for me
Can you possibly get any bigger? XD
ma boi really said if u cant handle it, i'll find someone else that will 😂😂
What if i say i like kids
Daddy noel on the grind 24/7 now thats an idol😩😃👌
If your head gets any smaller ill unsubscribe to your channel and leave you!
"I'll leave you!"  Sure. Leave your sister on the table before going.
Father Noel with another life tip
sir can i ask, how to use dianabol for 1 month?
The fact that rhis big serious looking guy is the funniest on the shorts is so ironic😂😂
Plot twist it wasnt about the muscles
this is like reverse anorexia promotion for men.
Would be funnier if he slowly faded away
If you are a natural bodybuilder literally no girl will say if you get any bigger I'll leave you
Wait what? Bro. Wait. I'm trying to wrap my head around that woman.
Zyzz would be proud
Nothing is larger than your compassion hombre. Cheesy, but you lift the spirits of a lot of people. If someone cant sit behind that, move along.
Don't have friends.
Show you my friends? Okay. Me: I present to you, my friends:
"If you get any bigger ill leave you"  Cool more time and money for getting even bigger
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you!" *starts furiously preparing pre-workout*
I Mean Who want to marry a HULK.
thats what she said.
Please, for the love of God, leave someone who doesn't support you. If your girl wants you to be careful with PEDs, that's one thing, though.
I have none, so it means I have no future ?
Someone told me once, you are the sum of the five people closest to you
Our goal ? Get so big that bitches complain.
Daddy speaks the truth 🙏
No friends... No future.
Noel : show me your friends and I'll show you your future Me : <looks around at my non-existent friends> FUCK!!!
If getting "bigger" involves storing and injecting thousands of dollars in drugs then yeah leaving wouldn't be a bad idea.
I’ve got no friends. I was surrounded by mediocre losers and cut them all off. 💪
Man’s left like my dad
"If you get any bigger, I'll leave you!" Noel: "Not if I do it first"
How it actually went: "Please stop using illegal drugs to fuel your vain addiction, I have to leave you if you don't stop 😭" Him: NO I NEED WINNERS SURROUNDING ME!!!!!!!!!! 10 X IT!!!!!!!!
Dan Pena!
Can't believe Noel's boyfriend would actually say that, this usually heard from girls but never gays, gays love strongmen.
we have tuna tavus. he eats earth
I don't work out regularly, Youtube just started recommending this channel. BUT DAMN my brain gets enough exercise from your motivational speeches alone. Appreciate you!
It seems like people forgot what true love means these days
idk man i think thats a somewhat reasonable thing to say. after all many of us men wouldnt approve if their girlfriends do a breast-shrinking operation or cut their hair off, etc. If your girl loses any attraction towards you because you become ugly big, its kinda understandable. Its your choice to see this as an ultimatum to pressure you, or simply as a "ok then i guess my goals are not compatible with you. goodbye"
My girlfriend is complaining that I don't have sex with her enough and prioritise the gym more lol
I mean even though you try to be healthful you’re still destroying your heart and kidneys by putting on so much mass, maybe they just cared about what the future held for the relationship with you.
Its healthier to surround yourself with people who has differing ideas. That way it will get you to debate and discuss beliefs and ideas instead of building the frame work to a cult like delusion
they probably were trying to help you lol, how big do you need to be?
Okay but who doesn’t want a hunk who is also kind and supportive?
Don't understand these types of people  If it would be their body then ok but if it's not them cmon man
The real problem is when parents stop kind of stop u from getting big, and say things like that, u just can't go away from them, at least until u are 18
Makes sense she doesn't understand nor appreciate hard work put in to improve yourself, she only cares how attractive you look.
Find the person that will tell you If you don't. Get bigger I l leave you,motivation 💪🤪
Ahah the swag pose with fingers before to leave XD
Their child: my dad left for some protein
A wise cowboy once said, "well.......................bye." -Tombstone reference-
Real question is, why haven't we seen Noel hit the griddy??
based
My girlfriend left my after working out everyday.... And losing 100 lbs... She said I'm not giving her enough time... So I can relate to this
That’s why noel is gay, all his men want him bigger.
« If u take more steroids i will leave you » 🙂
May be she was concerned about tiny peepee syndrome due to steroid abuse?
😂😂😂
wait, u can grow bigger than this??
Imagine saying dad to such an unit, baby you can have me anytime you want.
0:11 - Jokes on you! I don have any friends! Owned!
I would’ve started 5x5 compound lifts and a caloric surplus that night.
Well if sombody tells you that, that person might be concerned about your health. Getting to big has some serieus negative sideeffects for you heart and other organs etc. You might want to concider nog getting bigger anymore and be happy ith your body
Guess she doesn't like it big ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
GF:If you get bigger I will leave Me: wait for me I will go buy some milk.
if all ur friends are roided like u, ur future will be shortlived
Probably not bad advice dude. You’re big enough and putting your health at risk using a ton of steroids. Lots of these dudes will never be big enough
Noel: Show me your friends.. I'll show you your future.... Me: No friends.
My friends just call me skinny and make fun of the scars on my face I am 13 years old
Song name?
Gg two daddy noel in one frame
I don't have friends
OMG!!!
But I'm not completely hard yet....
no friends no future
LEAVE ME 🙏🙏
When you have no friends but you still go to the gym everyday just to kill the stress and stay fit
The voice 🥲
Cringe. Surrounding yourself with "yes people" is never a good idea. Somebody gotta tell you the hard truth sometimes. Imagine if this video was made by a morbidly obese person.
Nobody: My dad:
Ah yes,here we have a rare species of the females called: *"a dumb ugly bi-"*
"See ya, anyway i m taken already (in a serious relationship with the gym)" 🤣😂seriously now, can a woman leave a man cause of his muscles?  I was thinking that's possible just when u turn bigger by fat, not muscles 😂🤣
Imagine leaving Noel...
he's really cute wuth the peace sign
Yea something similar happened to me. I chose gym over a date. Funny thing is, she got with because I was big. How tf does she thinks I build muscle!?
lmao my boyfriend and I are both trying to get bigger
You killed it like bye but@$
My parents don’t really want me to exercise, but I can’t cut my contact with them completely too. F*cked up situation.
Every mid-aged man after watching this: Google, where is the nearest gym?
The pose at the end tho 😂 this man is a legend, but also a vibe 🥶
Her: "If you get any bigger I'll leave you" Noel: HOLD MY PROTEIN SHAKE
Grow up. There is nothing you can do or say. Game over!
All my friends is fake
ROids is the future !
I don’t have people
No friends,but ambitious...now tell me my future...
Damm his girl looks exactly same as he his   Noice choice Noel 💀
You need to care your heart during your weight gainings.., to avoid troubles,..
Plot twist: She wasn't talking about his muscles
Girl is completely justified in leaving a relationship whenever she feels like it. Her choice.   You tell people to surround yourself with like minded people, that’s what she’s doing.
Whats the background music?
LMAO 😂 good shit
okay then, leave. 😐 what you still doing here?? 🤨
Majority of woman love fit people with good muslce but to much muslce they don't like it.
Good video  noel your motivation knows no bounds I'll be dead before I get my dreams going but hey I'll be watching from above
Noel went for some milk
So, we ignoring the fact that daddy Deyzel is covering the entire L-couch?
Well its likely because they want you to live past your 40s..... I understand what he is meaning tho
Aren't you gay tho?
What would be my future if I don't have any friends?
What Woman would reject someone like Daddy Noel.
Song name?
I don't Know how to find people that want to go to the gym and do powerlifting and help each other to be healthier friend was supposed to get a gym membership the same time that I did and bailed and now I'm at gold's by myself with zero motivation
there is a limit to everything, big body but small balls are nothing alpha females want
i think a better advice is to think why your goals are what they are, and what’ll you do if you don’t achieve them.
Song?
Hahhaha great use of the metal gear alert. Good stuff man 👍
Girlfriend: If you get any bigger, I'll Leave You.  Big Daddy Noel: No, I'm the One Leaving You, PEACE OUT!
daddy?
I’ll never leave you if you keep getting bigger 😘
Well who wants to be with a man who is so focussed on his own image. Addiction is addiction and its unhealthy.
What's the song in the background?
W
0:01 you're the same size as yourself
My ex was taking bodybuilding way too seriously - once I found out she was taking estrogen blockers and was approaching being as big as me - I asked her to question the health of this decision. She curled into a ball sobbing and smashed her head on the ground to the point of knocking herself out.
The comedic timing and the impactful timing dads a genius
It’s sad because it’s actually happened before.
I am going to start to work out I am glad that my girlfriend Is very it encouraging an fall my friends are to I am glad I have a good friend and family base
kinda hard to surround yourself with like-minded people when literally no one I meet is ever like-minded
Honest to God this happened to me too
In a weird way I hope I hear these words some day.
Song?
I mean how much bigger can you get?
I don't have friends. Not worth being weighed down by normies
I don't. Got friends
Pls hit the Griddy daddy deyzel
If we dated I would leave if you didn’t
Woooooo daddy Noel
I don’t have any frens, I have no future ☹️
10/10 video
Fact you had to go through somthing like that itself is impressive keep making awesome content bro you change all our lives and made working out alot easier for all of us 💯💯💯
My mom doesn’t want me to get bigger what do i do?
Noel pulled a 'my dad'.
Nah nah noel seriously you can't fit in the apparemment door       It's actually impressive and i'm gonna be next i love the channel ☺️
you are small
"Surround yourself with likeminded people that support you." Communists: Is... Is this man one of us???
jokes on u i dont have any friends
Bye Bye :)
NO FRIENDS = NO FUTURE  BYE EVERYONE !
XD the way he goes  Actual chad
she might have been concerned about the juice he consumes to get there...
bro turned into my dad 😭
Big enough muscles
Thank you good sir....your vids always motivates me....in scrawnny weighing 46 kg and ive started working out for almost a month now...
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future". Let's deconstruct this a little bit. What if you're 'successful' and your friend is a loser? Do you end up pulling them up to success or they end up pulling you down? What if we shift the perspective to your friend with the same quote but opposite situation? I wanna know in which direction do things progress. Is it that losers always end up pulling you down? Maybe the point is that losers hang with losers and winners with winners, so instead of telling someone directly that they are a loser, you point to their loser friends. Someone help me make sense of this.
Noel's gf was jealous lol
Same vibes as being fatphobic
Karen: If you get any bigger i'l leave you!!!  Me: Sure get out from my house🗿
I don’t have any friends
Man made preworkout and bought milk😂😂😂
If you get into a relationship without speaking about this first its your own fault.
i dont disagree with the message here but "surround yourself with likeminded people" isn't the best wording, maybe "distance yourself from negitive people who refuse to change" would be better?
Nani?!
I'm not getting big since I'm a vegetarian 😔
Idk why would someone want a say in how you evolve, as long as it's not bad for your health, it's the gym god damnit, my guy likes me fat and he often whines about the fact that I want more definition but he knows he has no say in me gaining muscle, we all are in our self improvement journey, if people around are slowing us down, what's the point of keeping them?
So there is really big difference between: "I really like your body right know, but i'm kinda discomfortable of seeing you becoming bigger. I wanna be with you but I wanna be happy too and like your body" and "If you get ant bigger I'll leave you."
I have no friends so I guess I have no future.
Please tell me why Noel looked good in the “peace sign” pose- Nice advice too Noel.
isn't this how echo chambers and circle jerks are formed?
Her back just couldn't handle Noel
That's like saying "I'll leave you if you get fat"
Maybe they would worried that you would die But it’s the same situation where if they say “if you do X than I’ll do Y’ and it should always be in priority to get out of that situation
Relationships require physical chemistry. You both have to find each other physically attractive to some degree. If a person changes their body from the body type they had at the start of the relationship to a different shape entirely, it's only natural to assume that you might no longer be the other person's physical type. Maybe this girl wasn't trying to "control" him, maybe she was stating a fact without judgement? "You're becoming something different and our chemistry is being affected." Is not toxic, it's just an observation. Maybe she thought their relationship was more important to him than his need to be the alpha, maybe she was wrong. Y'all are so judgemental though.
Imagine having someone to leave you in the first place...
i have no friends. do i have a future?
Tbh it might be a good mentallity as you are reaching a point where bigger might mean shorter livespan. As all natty as very limited to max size, enhanced are not and how big is big enough is a valid question.
“Show me your friends, and I’ll show you your future.” That’s a whole fact
?  You said to surround yourself with people that are like you but clearly you didn't take your own advice.  It's really not her fault for not being into someone that is a giant.  There's nothing wrong with you being that big, but expecting other people to be romantically involved with you if they're not into it is just as bad if not worse than her leaving you because you're too big.  Is she supposed to just suck it up?
Well, I have no friends. Can I show you my Pokémon Card Collection instead?
Lmao
Oh dear I don't have any friends
Moved to Phoenix from Michigan for a girl who said this to me. Needless to say, we aren't dating anymore
That voice coming out from him Omg  😂😂😂 I'm crying
Honestly I don't know how you can find more muscles unattractive
Bro you are too big. Majority of women don't find superphysiological amounts of muscle mass attractive.
This sounds so ridiculous, I would understand more if they would push to stop taking steroids for health reasons, but still love should be for the person not the looks
Theres a difference between like minded and yes men.
Somebody has been watching dan pena recently
she just cant tolerate the thrust
Who... Who... Who don't like their boyfriends to go big! You tell me you don't want to get railed by Greek god! Give him to me then! Sheees!
I wouldn't say anything more but aren't you gay?
Why tho? I likem bigger 😍💪🏼
never decline what fuels you
Surround yourself with like minded people who support you and uplift you towards your goals, Show me your friends and i wills how you your future👍👍
The way it's done is almost like as if it's an advertisement 🤣
i dont have friends,everyone is my rival and opponent(almost anyone except my coaches)
I don’t have friends at the moment I’m riding solo….
Get yourself someone who says "If you stop working hard, I'm there to make sure you work harder"
Happened to a friend of mine except he was becoming fat
Could someone help me: I have a well basically toxic friend who is my friend since i started school but he always says bad stuff about me around the 'popular' kids and i dont know how to tell him that i dont think of him as a good friend anymore
Surrounding yourself with like minded people isn't always a good thing tho. It's always good to have people that don't agree with you on certain things as a sort of checks and balances system. As long as you can disagree with people and continue to get along I feel it's beneficial. As far as this scenario goes tho, hell nah.
Am I the only one that noticed the youngla t shirt
good man👍
I'm actually curious though. Was she being toxic about it or was she just not into big muscly guys?
This is beautiful. I've looked at this for five hours now.
But what If I have none.
He goes on the store to buy some protein powders
Alpha choice
She/He could have just been concerned with your steroid use. Getting any bigger would require greater dosage and greater risks.
Achh idk man I not a total meathead like some of yall (no hate) but it’s comparable to girls (or men) getting seriously fatter and lazy after “settling down” Getting as big as Noel is far from most people’s ideal in a partner.   So bottom line is he’s right, make sure you’re with the right person, and HAVE that conversation during the relationship. Because no one should ever have the influence on what you do with your body but at the same time you need to make it clear if building a sick physique is more important to you than compromising for someone you love and commit to.... woah I feel like a just spoke common sense 🤪
Noel, what's the song? Awesome vids as always too :)
When she feeds you nothing but bread
Peace out
Bro. I stg, every single girl that actually complimented me on my muscles (I know, so rare) and cared (or at least was more honest about it, you girls are the MVP's) all told me these 3 words... Are you ready. My body is ready. The three words were: Don't. Get. Too. Big. Okay, that was actually 4 and for some reason my mind said 3 back when I was typing but I am too lazy to edit it. Exposed. True story though. Basically girls do not prefer the Cbum look. I mean, obviously some girls do (goes without saying) but fact is, majority think that it's too much. They prefer the Calvin Klein model look, like the young Calvin Klein, Mark Wahlberg. Do you though. Personally, I think Jeff Seid has the perfect physique. What about you guys 🤔🤨
"if you get any bigger ill leave you" pulls out needle and injects into buttox lmao
good motivation
my friends suddenly left my home
Song ?
I need to start working out    Any ideas on where to help start  16 - 190 lbs.
In some cases this might actually be valid. If your getting huge and abusing PEDs just for results and getting bigger, there's a big health risk that your taking and your partner just wants you to be healthy. I don't think there's alot of people who don't want others to get bigger for no reason, I think they don't want you to get bigger at the cost of your health.
No friends. No future. Hello darkness my old friend..
What a chad
Daddy Noel 😩🍆💦 spitting straight facts no 🧢.
who wouldnt want to be with big daddy Noel????
It happens even more to women.
I know it is likely you won't respond but I am trying to get skinnier but stronger I am overweight 260 lb 13 years old and 5,11
My gf asked me to stop as well. It's a difficult situation, she sais it's not who she fell for.
Lol. If she wants to leave you if you become bigger the most logical is to pack your things and go to the gym.
legend has it he has led lights in his bathroom
"I ain't no simp you won't leave me. I'll leave you." ~ Daddy Noel probably
Woman: “get any bigger and I’ll leave you!”  Men and me: “we’re men for a reason to love you and protect you. We train always to be your bodyguard because your health and safety is our One priority. If you don’t appreciate what we do and care for your well being than PEACE OUT!”
You sure she's talking about your muscles,  champ?
Im 11 almost 12 im tall but fat and skinny on muscle 6 Months WorkOut is my goal
He left faster than my dad after the milk ran out
Man i love his dry sense of humor xD
Imma just go milk shopping.
I left my mom and now  I can't pay my gym membership
Just go for it. There are people who maybe doesn't like the way you look or seeing you make progress in live. Just ignore them or leave them be(no point arguing with them if they can't understand you). Thanks for the advice Sir Noel
This is one of those things that seems like good advice except it's also the same way you get addicted to heroin
Feel the same way when I tell a girl I play Yugioh. I work out as well, but I do it for myself nobody else mainly. But also I have things to see before I die.
Whatever this man says, it's so fkn true
The chad of chads
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you" That's what she said
I mean is she wrong?. how's it that you are getting that big i'd say not good for your health LOL
I have no friends. Just goals
Happened to me as well and I’m not even that big! She didn’t like muscles lol probably made her feel insecure. Said the sight of me disgusted her and that’s how I knew I was making the kind of progress I was looking for.. 😁
Worst part about this is Noel likes guys so a frickin bro tried to stunt his gainz...
Hey man, I’ve watched your vids for a while now and I find them all super helpful. I was wondering if you know any good exercises someone could do to reduce knee pain and develop more leg muscles. I do 12 mile ruck marches twice a week for work. Any tips?
Does that mean that if I have no friends I have no future?
Could teens use pre workout? Thanks!
Relationships are a two way street. You have to make sacrifices and can’t have it all.
daddy noel did it once again
you are a chad
I remember being at the pub one night and there was a guy there from my gym who had recently put on loads of muscle but he was still slightly tubby and these girls were like "you look amazing you shouldn't lose any more weight" and he was kind of like not super sure because losing fat was one of his goals as well as getting a muscular body type and he was asking them if girls would stop liking him and they said yes because apparently girls don't want some super muscular in shape guy they want a "big bear" (their words). I ended up interrupting and said "no offense to you girls but what you think he should do is irrelevant, he should do what HE wants to do" and they got pissy at me. Like bruh, those are HIS goals. He wants to do them and you're trying to stop him from accomplishing those goals by controlling him and you barely even know the guy?
What is that product?
She said that Bcz she don’t want you to destroy her
pov: dad
Hi, if you duct tape you back can you reach it? Or is it just myth or fake? Just asking 🤔
if my boyfriend loses anymore weight im gonna leave him instantly.
Hey Noel I don't know if I sound stupid saying this but, do I have to Do things like leg day and upper body day things like that or can I workout every part of my body in a day?
the look at the camera got me dying XD. This indeed made my day
Noel I actually need help, one of my Lats is bigger than the other
Yo this fucking literally changed my thinking and mental state...
guess I have no future then
any man that is so overly obsessed with his body and looks is fucked in the head
Hey deyzel can you tell a high protein vegetarian food to eat it may help me and alot of vegetarians
I'm a huge fan of yours  Don't take this as an insult, but I was curious  I was wondering how you still have that double chin when you're this shredded. You clearly have your body fat under 10 but still got that double chin  I was myself looking to reduce my fat percentage to get rid of the double chin. I saw many videos, and they all said the only way to get rid of double chin is to reduce fat
Daddy Noel I need your help. I need someone to interview that is connected to physical fitness. I hope I can interview you for our activity.
😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
The song is Jx.Zero - Playboy
I want this dude to be my roommate. If I don't he can drag my ass to force me to exercise.
0:05 my dad when i was born
a bro in my gym told me that his wife didn't want him to get any bigger, but once she also asked "why are you smaller?"
Yup I had the same thing dated a girl but she didn't like how I was growing and pushing myself to grow more and have no peak. And within a short time started dated a gym girl
Lolsd
I have a question about jawlines. In order to gain a defined jawline, what should i do?
Judas had absolutely irreprehensible friends though
Two weeks since beginning to train 4 a week. The exercises are still a lot softer since I stopped but that just shows how much I have to improve.  Still, I haven't missed a single training. Let's try to keep the routine going.
that girl surely was concerned about your physical and mental health and is obvius why
Noel I need your help!!  I have a problem working out. I can put hours into it, take pre, supplements, protein, sleep well, and all that but still can’t build muscle. I figured out the problem is probably in my workouts but I don’t know how to fix it. Do I just need to push myself to failure? Also I workout in a home gym if that helps. (Not only looking for Noel’s superior daddy advice, any gym bros advice is welcome.) I got an arm injury before so I’m hesitant to push until failure as much but if that’s what I need please let me know. I’ve been grinding for way too long to have these small gains.
That's the right thing to do. Btw the smile is so damn cute
why you are my hero?
"Show me your friends, and i'll show you your future." I love that
So it's wrong when a woman doesn't like a man that large but a man can ditch a woman that isn't his body type? Make it make sense
It’s happened to me also
you know what ? i think i'll get WAY bigger !!!
Anyone can tell me the name of the song playing on the background
Weirdo
I bet she feels dumb af rn
Tren hard
Nice wig Noel
Sigma noel
But...but...butt...remember?...Size doesn't matter. 😁
Yo if you get Ryse make sure yall are checking Noel's name at the end 👍🏻
https://youtu.be/r_G0xPVSUEI
So what if I have no friends
daddy is back!!!! hittting legs tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!
I need to meet daddy noel
Mommy Noel in the house baby
Watch STRONGEST man on earth  video https://youtu.be/r0O4zstPKR8  Thanks for the support guys...
🤔🤔🤔👍👍👍😞😞😞👌👌👌
What? She doesn’t like all the steroid use?? Lol
That Peace is a Legends XD
Him: time to get bigger
It’s probably because he thought u were obsessed and addicted to the gym .. looks like he was right 🤷‍♂️🥴
"show me your friends, ill show u ur future" so ur saying that I have no future?
“If you get any bigger I’ll leave you” she’s as big as he is
Oh yeah.. im sure her leaving had absolutely nothing to do with the increase in gear that you needed to get "bigger"
How is that even possible he can't,... wait😳.....oh you meant ..
If someone asks you to sacrifice your dreams for them, better to leave them in the past…
She said don't do drugs but you keep doin em
“show me ur friends ill show u ur future” i disagree if u a follower then yea but if u ur own person then ur crowd wont define u
Song when he disappear?
Don’t lie. What she actually said was “ the roids are shrinking your penis. If you don’t stop I’m leaving you.” Then you went into a roof rage and broke her jaw.
This is what my brother used to tell me growing up! - Show me your friends, and Ill show you your future
Double action
What if I dont have friends?
Meanwhile me: ''Is it weird to scream, LIGHTWEIGHT BABY, during deadlifts?''
Can you cover how to grow your back muscles or get rid of the dowagers hump
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
This would be the right ting to do. But what if instead the conversation was something like  "I can't stand the idea to see you go through major health complication and risking your life due to that good old vitamin S, so I will leave you because that would be too much pain for me." ? I'm not against personal and responsible use, but that would change things a little wouldn't it?
So this is why dad never came back, he still lifting in the gym
Do you ever get worried about you accidently cutting one of your veins??
👆It’ll work i promise🤞😬       I miss her please
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Hi guys  Im trying to gain weight  Can u recommend me what to do ?  Thx
Happened once to a bud. Apparently he became too big and she couldn’t support his weight. Almost asphyxiated to death.
My gf says the same thing, I don't know what to do, plz welp
"If you get bigger I leave you." "Not when I did first."
I also had a chick that was against me going to the gym, im not even a big guy, but some people just dont wanna see you grow because they cant themselves
Got bigger and ripped x2
Man, you gotta love this guy ❤️ ❤️
"show me your friends, and I'll show you your future"  welll I don't have any, what about my future?
Why is this on my page
I don't have any friends
Love your content, not just focus on build muscle like other influencers but also life and more, keep it up❤️❤️
Noel I have no motivation but I want to have it so bad please help
you guys know noel is gay right? so he might portraying both man or woman.
Haha I have no friends!
Can the same concept be applied to jobs? 😂 “Do that again and you’re fired” “You can’t fire me, I quit 😎”    Yeaaa living the broke life
The gains are part of me,  you love me?  Then you also love the gains 😎
No woman has ever said lol
$JerryBaker92188 is where you can donate a dollar to my new teeth if you wanna help me pay off the 22k loan within 3 months so I can get the next loan for the next parts of the process I've already had 8 implants drilled into my jawbones a couple weeks ago for snap dentures.
I've learned a lot from you brother
noel , can you make a video about how much sleep should a person need per day
Is it just me or do you MENS love testosterone cus I DO
So glad I never had this kind of problem with body dysmorphia
Daddy Noel, why you didn't hit the Griddy while the song was playing?
I want to hit a point in life where I can spill protein powder all over the benchtop and not even wince. Thanks for setting the benchmark good sir!
LMAO WOMEN
I wanted to ask for any advice to start working out. I can't go to the gym and I don't really know how to start at home.
yes, I do remember your big t-shirt story, have a great day friend Noel
My ex used to say this…      Well I went from 67kgs to 83kgs so yeah haha 😆
Find a partner who will support you, not pull you down! And always remember to get a partner YOU will support as well!
What's the song in the background?
Fake natty
Tis is why you are built like Minecraft Steve.
no friends no future 😢
Noel: ✌
This one had me crying 😭 yo I love his shorts this the reason I got back in the gym 😂😂💯
MEPs: Joint Efforts Several MEPs from different countries who attended the hearing strongly condemned the organ harvesting crimes committed by the CCP. They urged the European Parliament to take actions to curb organ harvesting and enhance organ transplant regulation as well as transparency.   MEP Maria Arena hosted the hearing.  Maria Arena, chair of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, hosted the hearing. She said that auditing and transparency of organ harvesting are critical. This means deeper discussions are needed to explore how the European Parliament can influence China and follow up on this issue. This is not only limited to legal aspects but more options could also be considered at EU Plenary Meetings.   MEP Isabel Santos from Portugal  Isabel Santos, MEP from Portugal, is another member of the subcommittee on human rights. She said that data provided by Elliott did show organ harvesting was taking place in China on an industrial scale, which highlights the urgency of stopping the crime. The EU and other international organizations must join forces to stop the tragedy. She had heard about many cases in which Falun Gong practitioners were persecuted. And the victims are not limited to them.  Organ harvesting is truly a crime against humanity, explained Santos. Simply classifying it as a criminal activity is not enough. Those who benefit from organ harvesting or participate in it should also be viewed as criminals. This is probably the only way to stop it.   MEP María Soraya Rodríguez Ramos from Spain  María Soraya Rodríguez Ramos, MEP from Spain and another member of the subcommittee, said that organ harvesting in China has proven to be industrial-scale killing. She urged the EU to institute laws to prevent these organs from entering EU countries. She said this was an unprecedented crime and it is hard to believe it exists in the 21st century.  MEP Raphael Glucksmann from France agreed. He said this was one of the worst crimes we could see on earth.
please believe in God,Jesus died for your sins so that you can go to heaven,Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion,God and Jesus can help you
the fact that he makes a woman expression with big muscles like that......
I have a question, what do you think about Excessive diets, like carnivore diet?
what a chad
Okay, so I left my family and friends and I'm left with no home, please take me home daddy Noel.
song?
Noels normal voice is so calmming imagine listening to his voide while weight lifting
I laugh so hard at girly Noel voice 😂
Well if he gets any more swole he will need a custom built doorway, so I understand where they comin from
Don't get into an echo chamber though, find people who want you to become the best you can and will help you with that. Those are the people you want to be around. Don't be afraid of criticism.
It IS gross when you don't even look human anymore.
If a chicks says that then it generally means she doesn’t want to be challenged by other females for your attention.
My goal is to have a beach guy type of body but if my girlfriend seed that my new goal will be to become a god damn HARDCORE BODY BUILDER!
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future" People with no friends: *gets Thanos snapped out of existence*
Whats the song name?
In no way is THIS narcissistic behavior.
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Noel is an absolute mass monster. The only dude I would not want to take  photo with....hahaha
Bet
getting to big unathestic though
You shouldn’t live in an echo chamber either. There’s a difference from a bad influence and a different perspective
here is a bunch of cute cats https://youtu.be/7wetlcZkqXI
But be aware to not surround you with yes men, but persons who will disagree with you once in a while. If you and them can come back thogheter later like nothing happened, you sure should try and keep those folks around you.
I’m ngl going to the gym 6 days of the week seems like a really good way to get bad people out of your life
My girth monster gets the same response.
Only a FOOL guided by self pity and jealousy would leave daddy Noel
He is a large man
Her: if you get any bigger I'll leave you Me: I'm not doing this for nothing
Bruh, I love how the girl is also the same jacked guy with a towel on his head and high pitched voice which is still a lower pitched voice than most guys, this guy is the definition of chad
Sry Noel I got no friends, this probably means I got no future.🙁
Girls: Dont get big or Ill leave Women: You can get as big as you want
Why is Saxton Hale giving me life tips?
If you get any bigger I'll leave you!  literally everyone who has above average IQ: ok *gets 2x larger*
Noel's girlfriend looking fucking JACKED! She only gave him that ultimatum because she's used to being the big one!
Plot twist he left her
Well said
Don't let people dictate how you live. The only thing you should let people in your life control is their relationship with you. They have the full ability to cause it to end if they start to transgress on your own life
What's the music called when he is at the door?
zaddy noel
Bet Grab the Ryse and keys
I see your a fan of Dan pena. Great short!
Daddy Noel I was so scared I thought you were gonna leave!
My reaction? Get as big as you want.  Chase your dreams.  I'd support you in anything that is important and valuable to you.  True friend would.  So would a true partner.  We are not getting together to put each other in the framework.  We get together to build each other up.  Otherwise...what's the point?! Love the one that you're with.
Wow, he just straight up teleported out of there.
the best part about this is that all he takes is the shaker and a gym bag
Big Spoon 🥄
I can't show air my guy
As my man Trick2g always says, "Lata Bitch". Lmao
*If you get any bigger, I'll leave you* Her: built as hell
We love you Noel
🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣 you have a big talent
Man this video is hilarious you really outdid yourself also with the Metal Gear Solid alert… impressive… very nice.
Hey Noel I worked out at weight room I school I'm getting better verrrrrry slowly I want to use creatine but my parents hate that stuff and I'm not seeing the slightest results after 5 weeks
Real shit right here boyz
If she can't take your size she can't take your heart. Wait.
I am not into bodybuilding why do I follow this guy?
Most do not want to see others succeed. If she isn’t a partner that encourages you to strive for your goals and be the absolute best you can be, the one for you is still out there king. ❤️
You are my role model 🫂
Somebody shouldn’t hold you back from working out, they’re in the wrong for trying to ruin what ultimately makes you happy.
Hahahahhahaha he made sure it happened!
she left a man who now has men calling him daddy on the internet  mistakes were made
i have no friends uncle noel its only me. im 17 years old. what is my future? im working alone
only happens to guys who give women that power, my door is always open for them to GTFO
Damn he don’t care
shouldnt always surround urself with likeminded people. It could lead to an echo-chamber where the only answer is yes to any idea, even if its bad.
The background music what
She meant that if your D keeps on getting bigger you have to find another one
0:12 wait, is that famous iranian poem?
He is the type of person, if he says, "Fck u" people would find that motivating
I love this 😂😂😂😂
While it's important to have support in your goals, you don't want to surround yourself with "yes men" who enable everything you do, good or bad.  Differing opinions aren't always bad, the intent behind them is what's most important.
didn't know that Daddy Noel had a twin
What if you have no friends? No future? or the ultimate future? haha
i have no friends so i gess i got no future lmao
Noel : Say Less
I dont have any friends does that mean I have no future!?
Opinion detected Opinion rejected  Reject modernety Embrace masculinity
Welcome to the red pill sphere buddy .
Song?
Uh, yeah I've got a mixed bag o friends, idk about my future
but bro I dont have any friends..
She was probably tired of your sleep apnea waking her up every night.
"ËAT BIGG TO GET BIG BABY SHEEEEESH
WHAT?? wish I had a boyfriend who wants to get bigger lol I would support him for sure ><
Get any bigger and i'll start calling you progenitor Noel.
I dont think she's talking about your muscles😏😏
I had a GF say this about music tbh. Anyone who can't respect your positive goals doesn't deserve a shred of your time.
A fadeout in the doorway when you head out would've been more lit
Getting stronger, not bigger should be the goal
thank you daddy noel
Background song??
The only true influencer.
Like my one girlfriend. I left her. 😃
Noel is like the father I've never had. He taught me so much about bodybuilding and becuse of him I started working out. You're one of the Best people I've come across in my life.
What if I have no friends, literally. I am not joking.
bro is this even possible to be bigger
"show me your friends, and I'll show you your future" Me:  showing my pets ...
Idk if it meant bigger physically or.. bigger the other parts
Song?
Noel, You should upload more skits on your Youtube Channel.  Not Everyone uses Instagram and some people are missing on those.
Good thing I have none
surrounding yourself with likeminded people shouldn't be a blanket statement. living in an echo chamber has equally negative effects as always being given a negative response. the message in the video stands, but people need to use it in appropriate situations.
Love how he portrays a female by just putting a cloth on his head 😂
My friend dad once told me (show me your friend, and I'll show you your future.) Never though I would hear that again.
I like the fact that he did exactly what someone said in a previous comment ✌
Damn he s so great
'if u get any bigger I will leave u' Noel: *doubles his test dose*
It's funny how he disguised himself as a woman by throwing a towel on his head
The quality of this videos is something else 😂
Is creatine safe for people under 18 years old?
I didn't knew noel knew how to use shadow clone jutsu
Found out my gf was cheating on me with her ex, Noel brought the first smile after the storm. Just started working out 2 weeks ago because of this guy. GOATED
Peace out ✌
Hmmm, I get what he means. However if your partner shows concern, because you take PEDs or believes you have extreme body dysmorphia, it shouldn’t be pushed aside
YES!
HAVENT I SEEN YOU ON GRINDR?
"Tell me your friends I will tell who you are" is an actual turkish old saying.
Absolute gigachad
Noel hey just been at the gym for 2 weeks. Your vids have been the catalyst for a new me. Also when will you start motovationals
my ex always said she didn't want me "to get big". one time I went with her to my gym she was pointing to the big guys and saying how she doesn't want me to be like them lol
girl's just envious that her boyfriend is bigger than her
Grow with me, or go without me baybeee
"show me your friends, and i'll show you your future"  what if someone doesnt have friends?
*Her:* "If you get any bigger I'll leave you" *Noel:* _"I miss the part where that's my problem"_
You are superb bro🤣
Never heard that from a man I guess 😉
i wish she told me that daddy noel 😥
Damn he is gonna become a mutant after what the girl said
Get yourself a man like Noel and get big with him.
more update pls love it
Yeah, easy to say, hard to find those people. Most people's goals are "just be happy" which basically means, do nothing and doing nothing doesn't achieve goals.
I had never seen a dude so swole acting as a girl lol
I don’t have any friends.  What’s my future?
A true sigma male
He double scooped the creatine that day 😂😂
that's what she said
It's alright to end a relationship if you're no longer sexually attracted to a person too though. It's better than hiding how you truly feel and give false encouragement. Best to always be clear about how you feel
My girl left me, that's why I'm gonna get bigger.  3 months in on a cut, -13kgs, from 107kg to 94kg. Gonna cut down to about 85 then start building muscle.
I have two playlists, Daddy Noel and Noel Deyzel 😂  Happy accident
and then he met a bro gym that was encouraging him to get bigger, and that's he became gay
WHAT IF I DONT HAVE ANY
God bless you uncle Noel, everyday you give me a reason to keep working harder in the gym.
Trash talker: I'll leave you if you get any bigger Brahs: Then I'll take my leave, to the gym!
Song?
I thought you was saying that once an Afrikaner girl told you that she'll leave you because you are too small... But anyway, we will always admire you Papa Noel, whatever size you are
Daddy noel losing hair. I get sad 😭
Song in the background is Jx.Zero - Playboy but he has in the video is a slowed version
"Cheat on your girl, not your curls"
but what if u have no friends
my doubt 😅... is protein shake sweet in taste?
Look at the size of her, she only said that because you were about to catch up. 😂
Noel ain't no simp👏
Idk if daddy Noel is gonna reply to this but.  Whatre your goals? Do you wanna get bigger? Stay at this size?
Cool and all but did he just mix proteïn powder with water....
So... no friends... no future?
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you" Noel:✌
joke on..me.. I have no friends!
You are the man Noel! 💪💪💪
But he is gay
i have no attachments with friends now as i feel everyone has something going on and no one cares what we do individually for ourselves ...they can either be jealous or try to defeat you ....very few people try to appreciate what you do.
"If you get any bigger i'll leave you" #Mondaymotivation
Anyone who faults you for trying to improve your health and physique IS NOT your friend.
God loves y’all and Jesus Christ is coming soon and repent to Christ
oh yeeah? im gonna be even bigger now
Nothing like a quick protein shake to leg it out of toxic people reach.
Well don't surrounded yourself with yes men. Don't be that dumbass fuck who gets a lot of plastic surgery or whatever and your friends are always supporting you. They should help you feel grounded
so if I dont have any friends I dont have  future?
Ah yes very relatable
I dont have any friend.
Noel Deyzel the sigma daddy
Show me your friends, I'll show you your future. Me: Has no friends.
My mother instilled into me the attitude of “if you don’t like me, you can leave”
„Show me your friends, and i will Show you your Future“   i don’t have friends
*_FUCK THIS SHIT I'M OUT_*
0:05 he’s off for more milk
I've had chicks unmatch me on tinder because I told them I workout.      And nothing of value was lost.
As a woman, It's even more accurate
Happened to me too, so I started eating even more
Bro what's your morning routine
I wouldn't leave you, Noel!  😍
While I don't agree with leaving someone because they're trying to build muscle and feel more confident, I feel like it would be a different story if you're concerned about steroid usage and the health detriments it brings hence "If you get any bigger I'll leave". I feel like it's a valid argument if you see someone you genuinely care about damage their health as a last ditch effort to make them stop.
Out of context that sounds bad, but I could easily see a woman not wanting to stay with someone who prioritizes being big over staying alive, which is honestly fair.
The problem is that u dont have a dream level youre just working every day youre never gonna stop XD
''Show me your friends and I'll show you your future''  ''But....I don't have any friends''.
i have no friends...
i have no frinds so can you be mine noel?
My dad always told me that quote
Her: If you get any bigger I'll leav- Me: K bye
*THE DEFINITATION OF A GIGACHAD*  Noel 👏  Ain't 👏  Having 👏 That 👏 Shit! 👏
You are such a great actor u replicated the exact last seen moments of Timmy’s father
I don't have friends    I have family.
"show me your friends, and I'll show you your future"  damn, I have no future 😭
What was the song?
This is what we call "Pump and dump"💪
what's that soundtrack on the background?
What if u dont have friends? Can u still show me my future?
i have no friends. Does this tell me i have no future ?
I thought he was gay ?
It depends. If she's saying this because you plan on taking more steroids, compromising your health, going against doctors orders, neglecting her and potentionally your family, etc, I stand by her in some regards. If she's saying this purely off looks, she's not the one for you. There's a difference between supporting you and your passion and being concerned for your relationship and health. Bigger can mean a lot of things
forgot that i set my videos to 1.5 times speed, and it added an extra layer of hilarious-ness to it
Solution: King-sized bed
I don’t have friends
Islam has talked about this before.
these people who give you ultimatums for things that make you happy are toxic as hell and should be left alone in the rain
"show me your friends and i show you your future" Me: has no friends
sooo if i have no friends, i got no future then, fuck!!!
Show me your friends and i'll show you your future.   So you're telling me i have no future :c
Can you make a video for IBS patients
"show me your friends and i'll show you your future" bro
Show me your size and I'll show the research which state that  your heart is under a lot of pressure from having a lot of mass. Remember the heart doesn't known the difference between fat and muscle .
every upload makes my day
Why leave ur own house lol
She : I'll leave u Daddy Noel : Brrrrrrrrrrrr
great editor
I dont think that was what she meant tho
And that is why i started to take steroid 💀
Maybe she left because getting bigger can mean getting smaller at the same time 🥜 haha kidding
the title looks like a zyzz shorts more than anything
What girl says this? 🥴
"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future"- Dan Pena
the goodbye pose was perfect, and good point, "show me your friends, and I'll show you your future"
If you close your eyes for the first few seconds it sounds like he got done taking a dump and zipped up his pants.
I have no friends, I'm just always alone and I just do my own business
True, but context is also important. If she wants to have a family it is to be expected that if you „get to big“ which is only possible with unhealthy steroids that some people will not want to create a family with you. I for one would not want to have the mother of my future children die of a preventable thing.
lol, I can't relate to that . It's hard af to pack on muscle tissues
New video yeaaa
-You know what? I'm gonna get get bigger even harder.
Thats how a real dad should disappear lol
DADDY NOEL FTW
LMFAO
whats the songname?
Bigger is better
*injects tren*
I'm glad I'm not a girl cuz I definitely wouldn't want to have a partner that fucks his heart up with steroids just to look big, Noel won't live past 50.
Shades of Brad Paisley.  I love her, and I love to fish....
So that means im gonna have a fun future?
My response would be "Don't just leave me, but never even look, speak or breath near me again"
Daddy Noel based as always
"If you get any bigger I'll leave you"  Me: *If only it were so easy*
Ain't getting "big" 4 u no mo'!
Whats the song in the background?
"show me your friends, and I'll show you your future" *Wow, look! Nothing!*
it was the day, Noel decided to date guys
70th comment
song?
Show me your friends and I will show you your future”  Me with no friends: I guess I have no future
why you spitting all these facts? Just the truth of me, otherwise I'm fuckin' holding back Sorry, I can't be your man     I'm sorry, she a fuckin' fan, uh
0:05 literally every dad ever
Fuck the haters. Everyones free to live their life however the fuck they want as long as it's causing no harm to anything else.
So, Noel cloned himself to get more muscles
she: "I'll leave if you get any bigger"  Noel: "Gets bigger even faster"  Funny shit man! Keep making content! <3
Mommy noel doesnt exi-
Noel is so fucking inspirational 💪
Daddy Noel staying wholesome as per usual.
"show me your friends, and I'll show you your future"  What a line and it's all too real...
She can't handle the size 😏
Mommy Noel doesn't exist, Mommy Noel can't hurt you  Mommy Noel:
"Show me your friends and ill show you your future"  This hit hard.
Both funny and educational. The best!
Whats the song name?
Daddy noel
Both funny and educational. The best!
Hi Noel 👋
dude, you're a steroid freak. how can you not have expected that. now give me your plug or tell me which steroid website you use for the love of God! you're literally killing me!
Bro just went for milk
Thats why i want to be with you daddy, my muscles isn’t the only thing getting bigger😫😫
The real giganchad
Can I work out with you one day? :)
Please show me how to lose my MOOBS
I like the show me your friends quote but sadly I forgot who made that quote
He did indeed get bigger after that
Can't get big fast enough to get to that break up fast enough
The way he disappears from the door. That one got me. The pose, the timing, everything.
Daddy Noel speaks true fact! It must have a nice friend who would encourage you to grow and tell you what your new goal is.
I mean having preferences is okay there is a size limit after which I would not find a person desirable I feel its should be okay to say that. Altought if you have goals by all means shoot for it but dont demonize people's sexual preferences
Can I add you to my Facebook friend list? I'm trying to get into that fit future
wheels=like doors=comment

Emotional blackmailing and manipulation is a clear sign of a toxic relationship. Great advice Noel.

Can't relate.
