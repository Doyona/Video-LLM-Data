Why is this man always sick😂
I was about to tell Pearl, but but you said you will re-roll
Aww, this actually made me feel quite sad to see them go. 😭
15:28 lose yourself?
17:43
PIX sticking to the script
25:02 jimmy saying 'oh,scar'😂
I just wish I knew how they did the rift thing lol
Sausage and Shelby have majestic voices in my opinion.
I love how Doc just knows whos going to be the main one to annoy him well enough that the creeper cannon is aimed right at Grians base
i love grian's high-pitched noises
'i- what are u doing!?...dude, are u bored again?"
Nobody acknowledged that Timmy has a Gregg
that creeper was on screen for exactly 3 frames. it sped off 10 meters in it's direction in 1 frame from looking at the footage. that means that creeper was flying at the very least 600 meters per second, which is 1342 miles per hour that creeper almost reached mach 2.  Doc, what the hell did you make?! and why is it pointed at grian?
13:06 oh yeah?
23:46  this is the most Scottish thing i ever seen(jk)
Sick Grian sounds a bit like Joel doesn't he?
moon big rift small
1:00 “that’s a very weird thing to want to do” well now I’m feeling self-conscious 👀
"dude are you bored again?" that is so funny lmao the implications
19:58 24:12 28:02
It would've been REALLY funny if Pix came back the following week for a one off!  Looking forward to future shenanigans
Everyone keeps hiding their secret santa gifts at Grian's base, but at least one of them was labelled!
0:29 HA I KNEW IT. you don’t understand how happy I was that happened🤣😭
7:12 LMFAOO
19:00
4:50 This is some super villain sht 12:56 That’s mighty impressive, I will say 18:16 Even in Minecraft, the cleaning ladies are underpaid 23:13 “ʷᵒᵗˀ”
Moon big, portal small
That sound 🤣😂 23:13
I have a friend with roughly the same organization tendencies as Grian... Eventually, she made it a points redeem on stream for me to come over and clean. Pearl being real relatable here
10:00 to be fair, watching in 2024, SmallishBeans didn’t entirely make it back! 😂
0:26 you didn’t fool all of us Grian, when you said that Pearl would have been so good, I knew what you were doing with that re-roll.
Oh grian rest up 😢 your sick lil voice  decorations! Killed me 😂😂
« The present you stole you blubbin grinch » 🤣 Joel is the best
“We don’t pick holes, we just cover them up and hope nobody sees them” hmmmmm… choice of words my freind
i understand its funnny and im bad at explaining too and im from the future 2:50
*absolutely demonic voice because I'm sick* The snowman looks like he got 2 minutes of sleep and a stuffed nose
We should not poke the goat. Proceeds to do it only a few episodes later.
10:40 HELP
28:36 you should have gotten impulse to play the song and then said "this week on hermitcraft... Pixelrifts is leaveing."
23:15
17:35 that was the fastest ive ever seen copper age...
24:44 Chica.
This prank is like a saw movie lol
28:05 sausage screams; "OW" and it's hilarious
did he forgot to put redstone for creeper jumppad?
Sick grian sounds like a teenage boy and I love it made my day 100% better
i still don't know why grian didn't just edit out the part where he showed pearl's paper
I knew it
Pixel’s intro and outro are ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
poor pearl
played like a fiddle
"I definitely shouldn't poke the goat again"   That my friends is called unintentional foreshadowing
"Just a bunch of scared Grian noises" I have now found the reason why I watch this channel
so many items are gunna lagg the sever......
13:12 Doc sounds like a kid on Xmas 😂😂😂😂😂
10:35
16:10 “I don’t know what to do with my life now. Just wait.” heh me
12:30 - “Dude are you bored again?” Lol, I know someone like this.
Hes commiting treeason
5:29 : heroBrian sheep?
why is nobody talking about Timmy wearing a Grian egg!?
16:35 he definetly shouldn't have...
Is it bad I totally predicted he would get pearl again
Grian: "I should probably not poke the goat agan" Me from the future: FORSHADOWING...
25:30 Everyone is enjoying Christmas without Grian, that's sad 😥
Do you like Pearl?
It’s funny because he said don’t pick hole,s just cover them up and act like they don’t exist as he,s filling in a hole and acts like it doesn’t exist
"I should not poke the goat more than I already have."  Umm Grian... I think you should have taken your own advice.
Your idea of a good "present/prank" has helped me to know how my dad felt all those times he looked at me and said, "....I dont understand you."
You leaked pearl in the last episode at 10mins. Also your clearly scritped story is dumb and takes from the videos as a whole. Go back to playing minecraft with your friends and making cool builds.
I love how the creeper explosion and the lag spike could be seen as a shock wave.
When it came to the laggy part of Pearl's prank, my computer just decided to die on me :(
JIMMY WAS WEARING A GREGG
I was really expecting a ender dragon in the present
someone needs to make an 8 mile parody with grian's voice
16:32 "I should definitely not poke the Goat any more  than I already have." Oh Past Grian... you sweet summer child...
why did he have over 2000 name tags? what does he need those for?
12:16 taking the phrase “to tickle the dragon’s tail” almost literally 😅
I really love the dynamic between Grian and Joel in the life series and I'm so glad we got to see more of it here. “Joel what are you doing” “Looking for my blummin present you've stolen you grinch” 😂😂😂😂😂
I was so confused, because i had seen doc's dragon before, then i remembered i watched mumbo's series first 😅
Grian: Aww somebody does love me. But whom?  Well Grian, why does your loyal audience return for each video?
Grian: I should not poke the goat again here we are
I miss the more expressive animation pack
Congratulations, you played yourself
Sausage looked like they held on for dear life trying not to leave
Tip for copper feilds is to put torches down 4 blocks from each other so that you can just place the copper next to them instead of counting out each time
"i know that i will need another charged creeper" i then see episode 36 the incident with an explosion in the thumbnail
I thought they had to fly through the hole with elytra with great speed and see who survives :D
Hello, and welcome to totally, 100% unfounded theories with Imagine that is not meant to be taken seriously at all What if Scar trying to follow them through was a teaser that he’d be in the next season of empires
I'm with perl on this one. I also have an uncontrollable urge to tidy up your chest monster
Is no one gonna talk about the grian egg on Timmy’s head
13:00 It was exactly two frames. I counted
Grian is the ditziest girl ever
"this sheep will actually be a very very charged creeper" the things I hear sometimes-
15:54.5
Grian: "My secret Santa didn't leave a note!"
Did anyone notice that Timmy was wearing one of Grian's Greggs? XD
Solidarity: fAils sausage: kisses  pix: see you next week
28:57 my favorite clip.
I think Pixlriffs didn'tget message about leaving the gear behind
15:31 Grian was literally Eminem
That's a suspicious snowdude
The creepers flying at Mach 7 Is amazing
The subtitles say "Selene" when the audio says "Joel"
23:14 I swear to God, that "what?" was so adorable, and you can't tell me otherwise
Pearl most. Like lee has ocd
I actually did guess that you lied about rerolling
There it is, the finale to one of the best MC server crossovers ever
Petition for the lifesteal crossover
17:35 Grian's got Scar's superpower now... Damn
23:13 almost sounds like a star wars blaster
LOL I was hoping that grian would explode so he would have to annoy doc more! Also I loved the ending and they kinda did have a war?
Why is there no boss bar for that dragon?
I KNEW IT
Not me gonna watch season 7 all over again cuz the barge lol
Scars the can't variant
The prospect that there could of been a massive server with all the hermits and all the guys from empires, is amazing. A server with that many people would be so much fun. I’m honestly sad that they have gone their separate ways now. I wish they could just have one giant joint sever.
POKE DA GOAT
I knew it would be Pearl again
What is it with us British peeps always getting sick all the time huope u get better mate
2:03 9:31
I knew you didn't change just didn't have evidence
Entity? More like Emptity
Ever since grian joined HC it has been MUCH MUCH more hilarious (not that it wasn't a great series before he joined)
“Let me put it this way pearl, if you dont clean it, its just gonna stay like that for the rest of the season”  And i have no doubt in my mind thats what would happen.
Was the button closing the rift?!
15:36 Grian-em
20:57 I love how she said Santa. "Saner"
Poor scar
Always love Pixlriffs recap reference
Hmm, how different was it when the empires tried to kill the hermits when they went through but the hermits gave them a staircase and a warning that the portal was closing.
it's a prank and a present for everyone involved :D
Mumbles back
MUMBO IS  BACK!!!
I think the LORE concrete powder was supposed to be Winguardium LOREviosa. Haven't watched far enough to see if that is realized, but whatever
22:54 oh my goodness A time where saying "sorry for my voice" makes sense as I can actually hear the difference Not that I care about the sound But I do care about your health =( RESTOCK! _BODY_
Sick grian sounds like Danielle Radcliffe LOL
groans poor voice i hope he gets better soon 😭
Whever I play Minecraft, organization is my #1 priority. Netherite no, base no, ORGANIZATION IS KEYYYYY
So mine isn’t shutting and I think my Canon might of made your one shot
grians voice 😭😭😭😭
When the crossover started, I was rolling my eyes. But now, I'm genuinely sad the empire people are gone.
You could you know... politely ask for a charged creeper? just saying.
I can imagine scar being trapped in the empires server, then it would turn into a thing for the hermits trying to open the portal to try and get scar back xD
I live for the fact that Grian sounds like he's going through puberty again when he's sick.
2:16 I thought that phantom was scar for some reason
How did they make a one block portal? Can't be like Docs portal from season 8 because the trapdoor would have broken it
I've also been sick grian good to know we're sick buddies
Best outro ever was by Pixlriffs! Loved it so much! Just Impulse's music button was very much missed! XD
I actually can't believe that Doc fell for this ruse so easily... I'm baffled...
Rocc
ALL THE GEAR AND NOT THINKING IT'S A BAD IDEA! (modified quote from season 6) (not said within this video)
12:20 "Dude are you bored again ?"
First
Missing Grian!
Ep 33?.??
Imagine if the portal closing was how they announced a new Hermit...  Like there's one person left but the portal closed so they're stuck 🤣
PLS POST
29:35 and grian havent been well since- (posted before e33)
bread man
I love your videos can you bring back paltry man form series 6
So how you feeling now?
Its been a month I wonder if there's something big coming up
when is the new ep coming out? ( its been 3 or more weeks) something big happening? a stream or a announcement or something or is G still sick?
Did Grian die? Or did I miss a planned break statement?
Rebuild the rift
Just tell doc I want a creeper lol
12:05 two shots later doc when grian sees doc hello there
You've mentioned before how much you "love" comments like this 😉so..... It been like 10 years since you've posted a Hermitcraft video!
I know we just had Christmas, but I’m wondering if cute guy will be doing any valentines day stuff on the server
Do a crossover with the dream smp
E
When the next season?-
When you going to post another vid
Where is grain
GRAIN WE MISS UR HERMITCRAFT VIDS
And when the world needed him most, he vanished
Grain have you heard of itsmarloe he is a sum what small Minecraft content creator and I think he would fit right into hermit craft
2:31 - RIP. 🔥 🪦 🔥
grian when is the next hermitcraft episode.
if i get 100 000 subs at the end of the year can i join season 10 this is a challenge
Anybody else getting the thought that hermitcraft is dying?
POV he hasn’t uploaded in a month and wondering if he’s ok
Silk touch?
I want hermitcraft exclusive and in my opinion those empire guys ruined the experienced
Aight I’m not even gonna lie I stopped watching Grian about a year and a half ago (I kinda just started watching other YouTubers) but I came across the hermit gang song and came back to Grian to thank him and Hermitcraft for making 2019-2021 some of the most memorable years of my life  I’m honestly gonna start watching Hermitcraft again.
Put 'narrate' in the content generator
It’s been a month when we gonna get a new episode
Everyone is talking about the banger of a crossover we just had, but did anyone notice Grian missed the hermitcraft: *9* in the title...  just me?
Hermitcraft should not take one month to record a video. A week or two that's fine not a month
Grian thank you so much for never getting political in your videos
One month and two days since last hermitcraft...
Omg Pearl's reaction was the best thing ever 😂😂😂
grain.
The ending was a bit sad since the empires were leaving.
FUN
greian its scar check your base
Hermits when someone made a mistake: "Thats okay, we can fix this together." Empires when someone made a mistake: "The absolute moronic idiot stupid.. idiot."
Is Ianxofour's versatile tree farm at the start!?
Eminem/Grian collab? Sounds like an idea and a half to me
Grian's Wealth throughout the seasons...  Season 6 = Let's show off our sahara diamonds!  Season 7 = Let's make a Diamond Pyramid Beacon!  Season 8 = Let's make Hourglasses to show off our diamonds!  Season 9 = What is a shop?
me: grian when is the next vid also me: ieanaking vids isnt easy so take your time
Grain when are you going to do another life serious
*Me waiting for episode 33 patiently*
Grian, next video? It's been a month But if u want a longer break,by all means go for it
Anyone Else notice Tim was wearing a Grian Egg or Just me LOL
hi grian
why did I thought that all of this lore was to let Pixlriffs join Hermitcraft as the rift is fully closing on him as he was the last one to leave xDDD What a nice crossover nevertheless!
I thought he gave himself pearl again
Pssttherift
Next grumbot content may say "Mumbo Return Server" or "Grumbot Destroy Empires"
Dear mr Grian, me and my 11 old brother have been watching since season 6 and we love your videos do you think you can bring back POULTRY MAN?
i already miss this collab 😔
GRAIN WE NEED THE RETURN OF PULTRY MAN
How are you feelin
Bruh the effort put into these videos is so clearly minimal, even with just the title like “end of the crossover” is the lamest most unnecessarily on the nose title ever
Did your name tag it
That creeper cannon part was actually hilarious. The creepers literally shot out at the speed of a bullet
not meaning to be pushy but when is  the next hermitcraft i know u might b eill or something
The waffle house has found its new host.
i heard that theres a way you can go outside the bowndryes grian please report back if you want to know how.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
I love this voice so much
The waffle house has found its new host
I wish I didn’t stop watching Grian.🥲 I have to catch up on whatever season this is. I only remember the beginning of this season
honestly, if impulse was there he shouldve played the hermitcraft recap song when pixlriffs was leaving.
Waffle house has found its new host
i just reliz that this seson of hermit craft is starting to get longer
hey grian. i know this is random and you've probably gotten many questions like this but. can i join hermit craft?:)
Thank god
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
The Waffle House has found its new host
Gian What hapend to mumbo did he just join back at one point and no one was there
Early congrats on 8 million!
Grain relocating charged creepers is *almost* as anxiety inducing as watching Scar fly around at 2 hearts.
I knew it! I knew he still took pearls name!
I literally thought last episode it would've been cool if you made us THINK you didn't get Pearl, but then you did.
So if the rift closed than what happens to your base? Because when you first made the rift (not cannon to the lore) you said the rift is the thing that’s behind all the anomalies and stuff that’s happening to your base and maybe the Entity
Grian, remember when Tommyinnit asked if he could join Hermits?  <• >v<• >
nice
where are you?!
when are you posting NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????????????????????????????????
Would be cool if all the empire members and hermitcraft members did a collaboration server where everyone from both sides could be together instead of being separated
Well that is one way to get a charged creeper
That whole clip with doc was way too funny
Hello grian :), if you somehow are reading this i count myself as lucky. I love your content and I have watched all your your videos, Thank you for being such a huge part of my childhood 🙂
grian we miss you
grian.lagg
When last life start again?
Grain did you stop living from your sickness?
I literally just realized, as I rewatched this video for the 7th time (cuz I love grian, who doesn’t) that the flag at 11:35 is actually the banner of the hold of The Reach (who’s main capital city is Markarth) in Skyrim! I didn’t know doc played Skyrim!
what happened to mumbo?
Guys I so sorry to tell you all but grain having a life again so there will not be a video today:(
Did grian unalive?!?!?!
Poor grian.
I was not expecting the creeper to come out of the side of the tree XD
i love my chest monsters =)
You should have poultry man fight grumbot
Post
Where's the Top G?
23:16 That laugh is so wholesome. I caught the Grian laugh virus☺❤
so.... new upload when?
Grian if you need to age copper faster you could ask Xisuma if you could use David.
Joel: I’ll tell everyone it’s shrinking. Also Joel: *Tells only Sausage and then immediately leaves*
Let AnimusJ Join!!!!!
you guys should do this every cristmas!
I havn't seen you in a loooooooooooooooooong time!
“This has been Pixelriffs, my writer has been Zloyxp, and captions provided my Lyarra” 😂 😆 the best outro
I do have a question.... What if all three grumbots met each other?
I legit knew he would get pearl again lol
The Entity was emptity
Pesky bird when
Did Lizzie make it through?
Love your content!
Let’s be honest here, squeaky Grian is a gift from the gods.
Hello everyone! Can somebody help me and tell what is the best server hosting site? I know that this is not the best place to ask this, but where i asked it nobody answerd.
This crossover was the best thing so far and it barely lasted a few episodes... why!?
u ded?
Mans joined mumbo in the permanent afk community
Merge think ruined this great series for me and my friends :(
Am I the only one whos waiting for a 3rd life season 4?
You are KILLING me how can you live so disorganized
Maybe you should use some water so the creeper couldnt explode everything
@grian on April fools, you should turn scars green trolley into Perry the platypus from phineas and ferb.
...And Lizzie missed it all.
yall acting as if it didnt make sense for grian to open the gift, THE GIFT THAT WAS VERY DAMN CLEARLY IN GRIANS BASE????
Scar saying “They took the life raft and left.” is so funny because that’s so true. Scott and Joel would be on a sinking ship, not tell anyone else, and save themselves lollll
It seems that the portals are not that stable are they? The portal dimension it works in many ways once again lures not connected things in a fan services appear and disappear like flies in the wind The portal dimension will be connecting soon who knows? The servers are already connecting
You can fly in survival Minecraft without an elytra
The Doc/Grian interaction had me cackling 🫰☺️ Thank you lol
nerf gun arsenal reveal!!!!!!!!!!!!
not grian getting joels secret santa
So long since i watched you
✔
Grain you were the secand hermit i wachted after gem you are a amazeing hermit
Did Grian actually open the gift that was meant for Joel. When I watched Scott’s video I knew this would happen if he didn’t label the gift.
Rift small
Kan Ethoslab be in the next video?
Season 6 ,don't touch my bush  Season 9 don't touch  my drago
subscribe to Grain
I love these videos so much
Please make a bilding tutorial for people how have ADHD
nught 😜
when is the next episode coming out I've been waiting for it because I'm quarantining and bored
😑
Bring back the barge please I miss barge co
Pleese
What is the server name and the code I want to play
Bro why is Grian ALWAYS sick each episode 😭
Please upload im in need of content
Im not sure why but the newer HC episodes feel kinda boring compared to the ones from seasons 6/7 when i couldnt wait for next episode grian will upload
When are you going too do the hard core series
25:24, look at falses head
23:14, 24:12 lool
oh no grian opened joels gift from scott
for the next life series you should have everyone tied together and you need to do some task to disconnect from everyone so you don’t all die
0:40 It isnt broken, its just my life on hypixel with Australian ping of 200-300
i see its been two weeks since this was uploaded without any other activity - i hope youre not too sick and i hope you get well soon grian!
haven't watched your channel in over a year. i miss these fun bits in the vids :)
24:13 It’s almost midnight and my family is all asleep and I laughed out loud. Caught me off guard.
Thlolmeec
I hope your having a great little vacation grian. You deserve it
Lmao. I’ve never seen a prank on someone else that would actually destroy yourself if it goes as wrong as it could go. 😂😂😂 You’re basically pranking yourself here, Grian. That’s really what’s happening. 😂
third life but theres a killer trying to bring everyone down
Rip Grian, your absence will be missed and felt throughout the Universe. May your videos commemorate the joy you brought to this world.
POV: You just realised that Grian's explosion actually helped with organising items as all the alike items stack
Lol
scared grian sounds like a baby seal
Grian you get sick very easily.
WE NEED POLTRY MAN BACK
I know griians top secret thing impulses siad the plain lol
hope your chirstmas was great grian!
5:29 you know it’s complicated grian red stone when there’s a sheep in it
2:34 what is dying in the background?
Grian grumbot is going to destroy Java addition and my idiotic friend made a grumbot shrine and left the world for a few minutes and when he came back the grumbot had hands and the hands were covered in blood and had tnt in it. and a herobrine summoner under it and so grumbot is going to destroy bedrock and java addition.
Grian you should hear Gideon's music You Will really like it.
Please Get GeminiTay on your next life series. Behind you Gem!
Grian, ARE YOU OKAY, ARE YOU ALIVE
Is the Season over
i have missed a lot of the vids and i just watched this and i was about to comment  who were they and where are they going but i haerd that yall didnt have a war with an other server and i was like oh they from dif server also why couldnt you just ask for a charged creeper also i think the way he launched them was by splashing them with blast protection and regeneration then blew them away with tnt
I have a laugh track that plays randomly, when doc said "are you bored again" it was perfectly timed with the laugh track 😂
Wait, didnt the Empires people come to the Hermit server because their home server had been rendered unsafe? Did anything change? How are they going home now?
Are you better yet?
grian i miss your videos im so srs where are you i could cry pls come home
I've been subscribed and liked all your videos for 8 years
Can’t stop laughing at sausage falling at the portal 😂
You should make Isengard
Hope your feeling better Grian!
Big crossover and no war I dont call that a win I call that a loss
hello
Opens shucker full of bottle o enchanting😂
I like how the elaborate prank on pearl somehow involves potentially losing your own items AND purposefully getting charged creepers shot into your base.   I feel like you might not know how pranks work. 😅
Random talk: I've gotten to the point when I even read "Grian" as "Grain"
I really want to see Joel in hermitcraft season 10
I've found the easiest way to move items into other chests is using a shulker and hoppers, hopper into a shulker or two, hopper into chest from shulker, allows for you to do other things while they fill, such as move already full shulkers. Also means I don't have to individually move each item.
Grian  The reason that your name is corrected grain migth be because that 《1》That people have often misspelled grain to grian or the less likely  《2》That grian when translated from Scottish Gaelic to English is sun.
GET FWHIP IN HERMITCRAFT ❤ 👇
Gian I subscribe to you and u friends or bro whatever u call them and happy new year 2023
Hey grian is MumboJumbo the person on the Pringles can
If you do a prank like this again, it may be interesting to leave your cam account in the box as a "creeper pov". Of course put it in a video after they post theirs, or for them to put in their video
Omg he quoted eminem
Has mumbo just gave up
16:15 that's a master procrastinator
Grian i am a fan i wached your videos and i love them. You could make a afk prank video
Does anyone here agree that when it’s Christmas time Grian is more fun to watch
So, when is the riff going to re-open and Mumbo comes through and be like “so…what I miss?”
you can stand in the mess and spam q and it resets the timers for items
To grain I made a world and recently got diamonds I made a diamond sword but don’t know what to call it I want it to be funny so that’s why I came to you you are one of the funniest people on the planet and do you have an idea on what I can name my sword
Finally they left good riddance, all except Smallishbeans!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 poor pearl lmao🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait...did Lizzy go through?
Grian I love ur videos I recently made my own channel called BRoBlocks and I don't know how to get any veiws
Grian you probably will not see this but you should do a series like double life but everyone shares a health bar
I just live out of whatever I do with my chest
If I’m being honest, this is my Minecraft storage system right there absolute chaos
The hermits definitely enjoy strangely sized things...  Moon's big, rift's small, where does it end?!?!
grian make the castle from seon 8 pls
UM ACSHEWUALLY THERE'S TWO FRAMES WHERE A CHARGED CREEPER APPEARS
“Dude, are you bored again?” Hearing this just makes me think grian annoys doc off screen often cause grian is bored
Moon big, rift small
Pearl and Gemini were perfect additions to hermitcraft.  Love them both.  But I’ve done this type of storage cleaning trying to combine random chests into lesser piles and it back fires.  😂😂
Sick voice Grian is best Grian xD
I would've just taken the coal happily, since I always am short
Why dis not in the playlist
Happy new years grian and everyone else
Poor Perl
on the 6th day of chrismas my true love sent to meeeee  -someone elses present -goooollden ore blooooocks -a confused empires member -arrows to docs dragon -shrinking dimensional portal -and a charged creeper to blow up pearl's dreams  (add more in comments?)
10:40 best bit LOL
I have an insane idea, what if hermit craft had a crossover event with forge craft or whatever that server for testing mods is. Grian and mumbo could team up with say direwolf20 or say impulse and tango team up with pagimar
Le BRokoN ChESt o^o
Npcgrain from build swap
The most Grian-proof vault is one that is never built. -Mumbo (probably)
Get well soon Grian
Can Grian and all the hermits read this please       You are my rolemodles all my friends say I am abANAZING FREIND and loyal this is my dream so please make it come true
Hey grian, you're very good at building. You should do a collab with someone good at Redstone and combine your powers! How about someone like Mumbo Jumbo?
Ummmm akshually ☝🤓, it's two frames 13:05
The fact that there hasn’t been a war yet this season is worrying
you could have probably just asked doc to help you get a creeper where you needed it , but instead you chose violence
Poor Pearl
My OCD Wants to kill youuuu
what if grain re opened the rift but only to a half slab and fishes pixelrifts out of the rift but just enough to clone him.
28:06 AOUGH! 😂😂😂
is mumbo still in hermitcraft? its been 7 months since he posted it
Does anyone remember the Mumbo AFK song?
Grian’s base remind me of the Hallelujah Mountains from Avatar
For Hermitcraft Season 10, I think it would be so cool for all the Hermits to work together on a single mega project. In just a few episodes on Empires, they made a massive mega tower that is on the same level as many of the individual Hermits' mega bases that take the whole season to build. Imagine what the entire server could do when given a whole season to make a single project like that! They could build an entire city of towers like that!
Does anyone know what was in the background on Grian's base at 2:30 ??  I haven't seen anyone talk about it in the comments.
21:52 I do the same. I completely agree.
FINNALY
17:20 dare I say … the emptaty?
Can you put in the content genurater the word trap
I started at ep 1 season 9 two weeks ago I’m caught back up 🫡
Isnt this Hermitcraft 8? The title is missing the 8.

Season 8: moon big Season 9: portal small
Grain-clean Pearl=cry Me-luaghing
Did you know if you have Phantoms following you just have cats with you. Phantoms hate/are scared of/don't like cats
"what are you doing! Are you bored again?"
Grian WHEN?!?! is a new 3rd life last life double life anything what life is it
one shot one opportunity to make my creeper go i only had one shot, i cant make the creeper blow this opportunity comes once in a season, yo
i love that grian got pearl again bc i thought he would
The fact that Grian was 99% certain that Doc would send the creeper is hilarious. I know they play together a lot, but this just shows how well they really know each other, just the entire server in general. Great job pushing through Grian! Also, thanks for the reminder that, yes, time does indeed pass bw clips, bc that realm of video making isn't always evident.
Stand in the middle of the pile of stuff, and keep throwing things, every time you pick it up and throw it the timer for it resets.
Why is no one talking about the fact that Grian stole Joel's gift, because Scott didn't label it?
The recap crew had the last laugh... I bet  pix ending was probably suggested by zloy too
“we made no war”grian said confidently while the grumbot on the other side of the portal may have already made chaos
From what we did see of Pearl's reaction, it was adorable. Bless her soul.
If Grian Didnt Say The Empires: NEW SERVER: Empires & Hermitcraft Season 9
Minecraft is probably the only game where I'd be happy with getting coal
Grian live in a g train in the next season
snadwitch
GRIAN PICKING UP JOELS GIFT CUZ SCOTT DIDNT LEAVE A NOTE IS HILARIOUS LOL
"If i had a nickel for every time i was duped in a christmas video i'd have 2 nickels, which isn't alot but its weird it happened twice"
Grian should start another tag and call it "tag 3 bombastic jubilee".
Grian, will you play a round of bed wars will all of the hermits against each other like you did in among us. It would be great so pls do it.
LET PIXLRIFF STAYY-Yyyyy!!!!!!!
I'm sad the Empire guys are gone, maybe do a whole season with them next time.
im not caught up can someone explain what the rift is? and what happened to the gravity breaking
was lore just grians obsession with pushing buttons
Scott putting Joel's gift in Grian's base with no note and expecting everything to go fine...
Love the secret Santa decorations at your base!!
Can the next season of last life be when you kill someone you get there life and you have 3 life’s and you only get the other players life on there last life
Groan almost at 8 mil!!!
Can someone please tell me if mumbo is going to play this server again any information i will love thankyou
I did not know that people actually take their stuff out of their suitcase on vacation. I always keep my stuff in the suitcase, it's the easiest way to prevent forgetting or losing something.
Ive got a new life series idea: First life  Basically, Green lives (people on their first life) cannot defend themselves from mobs or players Yellow lives can defend themselves from red lives and mobs and can kill green lives Red lives stay the same  The main idea is that first lives are helpless and everything will be after them, so it will be interesting who would be the last green
Grian Grian Grian you should know that size does not matter even if its small
Somehow I was right about you getting Pearl anyways for the secret Santa  Double tricks sound very likely for that scenario
For some reason I expected him to get Pearl
"I like war" I need help getting up that was so good!
Well, it was fun while it lasted
I hope you and your family had an amazing Christmas and have an amazing new year thank you for being me and your amazing community you have built such joy this year  You and the hermit are one of the things that bring me joy in my wind down time when my kids are in bed or on my lunch time breaks so from me thank you so so much for all the hard work you put in your videos I understand that you put hours and weeks in theses videos
12:18 “are you bored again??” LMSHHFSO DOC
Hope u are feeling better already, I love your videos and im already waiting for the next one xD
Sick happy grian noises are amazing
Oli casually leaving the server with some of Scar's stuff
I love how Doc's reaction is "Dude, are you bored again?"
I know how you feel with being sick lmao. My entire family got flu just before Christmas... it sucks for sure
Is anyone bothered by the fact Grian said "I are"?
dude when i saw grian reroll i thougt: oh it would be so unexpected if he didnt actually change the name well here we are
Hey guys
MERRY CHRISTMAS GRIAN!!
Pearl didn't see the creeper, it just blew up from her POV.
That voice is giving me flashbacks to season 6
Poor Grian sounded so sick by the end of the episode. Hope he’s had a restful Christmas
bro a Hermitcraft and RatsSMP crossover would be awesome
This would of been a great way to get a new person onto the Hermitcraft server.
Grian screaming at Pearl to clean while she whimpers in pain is my favorite Christmas activity this year. Merry Christmas!
I really want to see another life series Grian, they are so good! When are we getting a new one?
I wonder if you planned the entire Empires thing from the very start of the Rift or if came afterwards and you thought the Rift is a perfect lore tool for it but either way the collab was fantastic!
The staircase to the portal reminds me of evo, anyone else?
18:26 "uh oh"
If everyone was naughty this year and all 9 trillion people would get a kilogram of coal, would we run out of coal reserves on earth?
Funny how doc has a dedicated charged creeper cannon pointed towards grian explains why ge got coal :p
Could we call your shop the emptyty?
Fwhip didnt Go through the portal!!
this is giving me such evo vibes with the portal stairs and stuff... man
well done pushing through that, now rest your voice.
Grian really bring the word rigamorole back from last season.
Grian: 23:14
"We had an interaction with a different server, and didn't had a war!" So we're ignoring the war that sparked when they tried getting back to the rift and Empires successful attempt to destroy grumbot? Lol
There's a Gregg on Timmys head
A minecraft video has never made me laugh at loud like this one! Bravo!
Idea for another life series: scavengers life: sort of like last life with up to 6 lives, and life giving, except within the first hour of the session, they have to find a specific item or block, and who doesn't, loses two lives. Except if you have 1 or 2, where at that point they don't have to scavenge and become hostile. Also when people die, they drop their head just like in hermitcraft. The chat would say who found their item, but not what specific item. Also, (optional) when a player is killed by someone, the person that killed them has access to their ender chest for only the episode. Day 9 of letting you know this idea. Tell me what you think pls!
"We had an entire interaction with another server and didn't have a war" Uh...does the Battle of Fort Riff-less not count then? Also, Empires Grumbot was going to destroy the server.
I was just watching grian’s old videos from season 9 and was on episode 14 which is the one where the word chobblesome was born and decided to google the word and their is a definition that comes up😂😂
I guess this season it isn't moon big, but rather: portal small
Doc's flag looks like the movie 'countdown' app logo
pix being on the server has been really special, and doing the outro as he left was a nice touch!
when i saw the shulkerboxes i thought to myself oh hes about to restock the barge again
I'm not going to lie, I'm kinda sad that the crossover has ended I really truly enjoyed it
"I think I prefer the cole"
"did you get bored again?" 🤣
grian becoming a whistle was amazing 23:13
I was hoping they'd have a tearful farewell for Gem and then she'd just turn around and say "I'll still be here."
Moon's Big, Rift is small
Nobody talking about how he just opened joels gift-
hey grian, you might not read this but if you do i would really like to talk to you on discord and mybe even play with you sometime, i promise i dont greif and i love making progress in my worlds, i even have a world that is almost 7 years old now
I asked my hrand parents for the grian colorblock hoodie and it is the must comfortable hoodie I own
Grian is really just bullying everyone this episode
Grian mining the (third) present with a pickaxe while having a perfectly good, enchanted diamond shovel caused me so much unnecessary pain.
Don’t worry Grian, Pearl wanting to tidy your base is similar to how I always want to flatten mountains.
grian was definitely scar's secret santa
grian + suffering = Pian
I low-key miss your building tutorials, now it's only Hermitcraft this, Hermitcraft that....
I was hoping Pixlrift would stay 💔
Pearl likes to clean. Hmph, Women!
I actually paused the video and waited for Pearl to upload her reaction before watching the rest of this one.
Awesome episode! Loved the crossover very much!
13:02 This is great ...
my gut says somebody didn't make it through the rift and this whole crossover has been an elaborate ruse to bring a new hermit into the fold
Love how doc just asks if Brian is bored again
I wish the portal could just stay opened
Grain can you let someone in the hermitcraft server because if you can I would like you to let my son play on the server because he is new to Minecraft
0:35 why was the ender chest open?
24:11 *dehcoraishunz*
23:14 *woht*
Grian: "oh I'm not gonna watch pearl, thats her content". Also grian: proceeds to watch pearl & ends up helping her
I've been putting this episode off because i don't want the crossover to end XD Is that bad of me? But now I'mma do it, I'mma watch it
This was so fun! Can't wait to see the next episode
This was so wholesome
Merry Christmas Grian! I hope you feel better soon!
Is it just me or did it feel like the emperors' time on Hermitcraft seemed cut very short?
EVO EVO EVO EVO EVO EVOLUTION EVO BRING IT BACK
15:55... Im sorry Grian... But that sounds like a circular saw that's scared of wood 😂
19:58 TEHEHEHEHE~
It's a good day in the server when grian restocks The Emptity
They could make a whole series like this, imagine someone from hermicraft and another one manage to create artificial portals and then shenanigans unsue, afterwards a whole war between hermicraft and empire with artificial portals back and forth. It will be cool to see that.
Take care grian!!! Get well soon! Merry crimus!
Grian sounded like he was 15 again when he was sick
We need a compilation of scared grian noises.
I feel bad for finding the sickly voice cracks funny but the squeaked "DECORATIONS?" almost made me scream-laugh
Hope you feel better soon and Merry Christmas!
The entity is no longer the emptyty
I've been thinking for this whole crossover, who's going to miss their exit and get stuck in Hermitcraft as an elaborate setup to introducing a new Hermit? I guess nobody?
28:16 Grian you cannot just make a staircase to a portal and say THAT without causing Evo SMP fans to freak out.
did anyone see greg in the shulker?
I got a feeling Docm put that button contraption in Grians base.
21:51 He has a chest monser in real life too??
IM CRYING “Dude are you bored again?” and grian panicking 😭😭  hope u get better i miss the collab already
I love how hermitcraft is a story server but you can see how they playing like this is a lets play and a story
Pixlriffs saying "I'll see you next week" was like Kang saying "See you soon" at the end of Loki.
Scar left you a little present that he was going to give you but then the whole Empires crossover happend and he did not have time to give you it.
high five on the getting sick over christmas. hope you feel better soon, dude. the crossover was a damn riot, im backwatching it rn
The last thing i do on my old PC before i set up my new PC, watching grian vids couldn't be a better thing to do <3
X and Pixel made a copper aging machine. You might want to ask about using it
23:06 He sounds like Solidarity when he's sick
I NEVER EVEN REALISED THERE WAS NO WAR? HOW IN THE? Y'all are growing up
So they came for like one episode we saw nothing of them and now they’re returning?… cool glad that happened….
I commented about the rift being 1 block wide in hermitcraft recap #41. 😋 it became true.
Merry x-mas grian!
I like how Joel ridicules Grian for not telling the rest of the Empires guys about the portal, and then he up and goes back without telling them either.
I saw Doc's video first, and honestly, poking the dragon is so in-character for you that I didn't think twice about it. XD
Noooo Pix went back :(
Mary Christmas! ⛄
Day 2 of asking grian to do a redstone tutorial
22:56 sing the mumbo afk song pls just like season 6 :)
but rendog stole their worlds core???? something might rehappen
I saw pearls reaction and there was no lag I am guessing pearl has a better pc than grain
TIME FOR A WAR
Hope you get better
Next thing you know, a new portal has popped up and Noone knows it exists and then a new group of gamers travel through it.(the hermitcraftians still don't know that rift exists(this is the OG rift, the rift the hermitcraftians went through was just a baby version of it). One of the hermitcraftians then come into contact with the new group wondering who they are and how did they get here. The hermitcraftian then gets intimidated when they see there are a lot of them and runs away to go get help, afraid that they have an alternative motive and might get attacked (in reality the group is very friendly and want ro know what is happening and how did they get there). The rest will be told at a later date. This is not what will actually happen I am just creating a hypothesis about what MIGHT happen (also grian feel free to use some of this if you want to, up to you)
Sad that this half of the crossover was so much shorter, but at least everyone had a ton of fun!
WE NEED WAR
hope you feel better
I literally read the title "Crossover Over" for no reason
"...and we said goodbye, to the Empires crew."  Missed opportunity to say: "...and we said goodbye, to the Empires guys."
buenas noches feliz navidad!!!
We’ve had “moons big” now it’s time for “rifts small”
28:52 congrats grian!
26:37 damn scar! XD
23:14 XD
Jimmy going through the portal and falling 😂😂
Did yall notice the lore?
12:08 XDD
mumbo come home :(
there were 3 frames of creeper
I really want to say "I called it" for that double bluff. Such a Grian thing to do
That shot of pearl surrounded by a bunch of just-exploded items had me HOWLING 😂😂😂
to be honest, i think an amazing storyline would have been one of the members of empire getting stuck on their server and vice versa XD. Then the whole rest of the season they are trying different tactics to get said players home. Would have been awsome to watch, but this outcome was wholesome as well. Great Vid!
this is the best episode in a long while xD
the fact that you got doc to instantly go for the charged creepers was too fuckin funny im dead xD had me in stitches
that secret Santa gift was for Joel 😂
I've been watching since season 7 (sorry it wasn't longer), No WAR YEAH
A story form empires and hermitcraft crossover feels like the story of Puyo Puyo Tetris. xD
Hope you are feeling better now.  Have a Merry Christmas!  And a Happy New Year!
I laughed when grian saw the green present because it was ment for  Joel so it was just funny  to  think it was for him😂and then Joel 😆
I've loved this crossover, the collision of my two favourite SMP's. Very bittersweet ending, really sad to see the Empires and Hermits parting but at the same time looking forward to each SMP continuing their own thing. Thank you so much for this crossover! :D
If only this crossover could have merged Hermitcraft and Empires...
I feel like the rift collapsing was because the imperials nuked Emperor Grumbot
...... wow, you played doc like a fiddle.....  there might be other smarter hermits, but you are the craftiest, sly, most wily!!!
Hey grian I wanted to know if it was possible to like get a copy of any of the hermitcraft worlds as I wanted to work on something but don’t know if it’s possible
I called it on your last video. I knew you'd keep Pearl
Grian started spitting Eminem bars
Scar prepared a cute guy skin for you and the cute guy materials as well. Hopefully your feeling better soon.
Next week on hermitcraft not pixelriffs      Looooooool
I'm really sad they're gone. :( I didn't like it at the start, but they grew on me..
Aw, this was such a sad goodbye to the Empire SMP. Its bern great fun.  *few minutes later*  Wait! Where is fwhip!!?? 😱
Merry Christmas Mr.grian   From: Philippines
Omg, it's been so long since I've laughed this much at an Hermitcraft episode! Merry Christmas Grian, and feel better soon!
....I called that it was pearl... LOL
Grian, get well soon! Also, loved the episode.
I hope you feel better soon Grian!
Merry Christmas Grian!!!! I hope you get better!!!!
I really want empire guys to play decked out
[squark]bye, CU L8R 🐊[/squark]
My favorite S9 episode from Grian yet. Well done with the fully functioning redstone! The noises you made, the interactions with Pearl, Pix doing the Recap bit at the end... Everything about this episode was perfection. I love this so much. Thank you, Lord of Chaos.
Ummm I watched Scott’s video just before this and… the present isn’t for Grian
So busy with xmas that i cant even watch a hemit episode, but finally i can, right at christmas eve
Almost 8 Million subs :O
I love your videos Grian! Thank you so much for all the hard work and time you put into for making a great video experience for us! Merry Christmas! 🎄😃
i started watching s6 like 2 months ago, now I've caught up
15:33 I hear Eminem rapping here
I feel like the fact that "we didn't start a war" is the highest standard for success on the server should probably say smth abt Hermitcraft...
12:18  are you bored again? 18:36 CLEANNNN 26:20 situation kinda dire please leave
You didn't read the book that the secret Santa left!
I pray that some day in the future doc can figure out how to travel the multivurse so they can all visit again.
Who made the fake secret Santa matpat? 😂
Nice, that double-crossover was so well stewarded, congrats!
Grian: oh no, the portal is getting smaller... Anyway
hope you get better Grian!!! also the voice stuff made it actually more fun XD
I have a bad cough to
"Guys, we had an interaction with an entire other server, and didn't have a war."  Next week on Hermitcraft:  The Dream SMP!
Uwu
Merry Christmas Grian! Hope you get well soon!!😊
Merry Christmas 🎄🎁 🎉
Thank god
I absolutely love the recap jokes, its sad they will disappear
The emptity🤣
After 24hours your still on trending! Also that ender chest was normal it kept happening to me I think it’s when someone closes it at the same time you open it
Last season was Moon Big.  Now we have Portal Small.
A Very Merry Christmas to you Grian and your loved ones. Have a Jolly 2023 Happy New Year.
How is it that a server with Shubble and Scott of all people had a war against another server leaving them while a server with Grian and Scar of all people DIDN'T have a war against another server leaving them? This truly is a crossover that changes people
The sheep in the trap lmao
I need more grain + doc content in my life
The way the creepers fly by Grian’s face lol
12:18 "Dude, are you bored again?"  At some point, Grain has done this before and I'm not surprised in the slightest.
Merry Christmas!
Grain didn’t start the a war for once. I don’t know whether to be proud or disappointed.
24:11 had me crying that needs to end up in a grian comp
Grian that present was for Joel
It was really cool how you all got together with the Empires server and just hung out. It was, as you said, a breath of fresh air. Excellent video as always, sir, and a merry Christmas to you as well.
Is no one gonna talk about how Grumbot III said he was going to destroy to Empires server?? Aren’t they just going back to a ruined world?
This whole crossover was wonderful.
Yo grian im bored, when are you starting the next war
EPIC
When you fall apart laughing because you know whos present Grian opened 😂
Love the vids grian, get well soon
For Christmas might we get a new third life season announcement
NIGHT
MERRY CHRISTMAS Grian thanks for posting your video made my day
Use a riptide trident  use lightning to age copper
the moronic idiot was Tim IT WAS TIM!!!
I have a sneaking suspicion that after the moon ended the season last year,  I think grumbot will have something to do with this seasons end
Me who had a feeling he was juking us: heheh
Oh man, grian really committed to the bit by risking all those items. although knowing Grian, he probably wanted to lose all of it to not have to deal with it lol
Props to grian, the hermits, and the empires guys for planning this amazing crossover! This has been so fun and so great, I absolutely loved every bit of it :]  Merry Chirstmas and A Happy New Year to Grian, the other hermits, and the emperors!!!   And take care Grian! Hope you feel better soon and remember to not push yourself with the videos, we'll always be patient for you to take time to yourself!
Grian stole Joel's secret Santa 💀
Did FWhip leave?
We should have permanent Crossover... Grumbot! Open the portal!
seeing the crossover ending is sad, but it was awesome while it lasted! the empires x hermits crossover will last me a while :)
Watching them leave made me really sad, it felt like they were always ment to be there. This was one of the best crossovers ever.
Did anyone notice someone fly into one of the floating rocks and die???
Normal people do a prank that causes some irritation. Grian does a prank whose sole purpose is to enact spiritual trauma.
Grian: "Guys we have a interaction with another server and didn't have a war?"  Is this lore of them coming back eventually?
I wish impulse was there. He could have played the hermit craft recap theme song while pix was going in the portal.
Coal? Gold? Joel!
it says more that doc has a load of charged creepers ready to go when you bug him
when doc says you dont wanna find out you REALLY dont wanna find out
The entity has been empty so for long, at this stage we should call it the emptity
Lol now that was a awesome prank perfect for pearl lol love it
I was literally was going to comment on the last video "how much you want to bet he got plearl again" but I didn't because I'm lazy
Get well soon grian!
Was Grian trying to rap to Lose Yourself by Eminem??
i hope grumbot survives this season...
Now, I'm at 5:07 and I'm prepared to bet money that he protects Pearl's legs from the explosion, therefore meaning she sustains very little damage.  Exactly as he did with Scar.
Get well soon Grian.
Sick Grian reminds me of when mumbo jumbo was afk (and still is)
that see you next week opened up so much lore
Hope you get better soon Grian
The creeper getting method was just 1,000,000 IQ lol
If its not completly closed they can send letters thru that portal like "marry xmas/happy new year or we need help" There can be lot of potential for new content/crossover.  Sorry mr Grian i've got big mind and fantasy 😁
Omg it has been forever since I’ve watched your videos its so cool to find your channel again nice to see you again Grian 🥯🍞🥖🥨🥐🫓🥪
Wonderful job pranking yourself. Imagine chest monsters being illegal next season.
"so I've buttered my own toast yet again" Yep that's going on the British grian compilations
Oh no Grian... The present wasn't for you. The gold and coal was for...  Uh.  Joel... Well he and you sorted that.
Grian grabbed the wrong present...
How am I just now catching on to your evil genius?
THE PRESENT ISNT YOURS
I remember time passes between clips, I imagine sometimes when something bothers you alot and you rant over multiple clips which are probably minutes apart, I imagine it tearing at you for hours and you just ranting constantly between resource gathering
I dont watch hermit craft but i love watching your life series when is the next one coming out?
Hope you get better soon Grian better for Christmas
Grian needing charged creepers: Ask Doc nicely if he could have one < Annoy Doc so he fires one  LOL 😂
The rift getting smaller was the same as “is the moon getting bigger?”
I am sad that crossover end…
…. So uh… who started to laugh when Grian opened Joel’s present.
NO!  I want the Empires crew back!
Get well G!
I love pixlriffs so much
Grian saying "the present is actually cleaning this up" and pearl just turning to look at him in stunned silence was pure gold
Awh get well soon Grian!!
Doc really made the Black Adam meme.
Should have used pearls items instead
Grian literally took a present for someone else
I’ve heard of a charged creeper, but a very VERY charged creeper sounds quite serious
28:57 “I like war” - Scar 2022
❤❤❤❤❤
The second Scott put Joel’s gift in Grian’s base and didn’t tell Grian I was like “Grian’s gonna take Joel’s gift!”
Actually kinda sad to see the Collab be over. But now I have a hunger for more. I want a huge cross over series with you the hermits, the empires, bdoubs friend, captain sparkles, and anybody else you can think of. Just go all out. It'll be awesome.
I prefer last live!!!
Have a Merry christmas Grian!!!
Rift small?
Me just waiting for mumbo to awaken and reopen the rift lol
I hate to see the cross over end. it was so much fun. I even got choked up as they left, silly as that may be. I will continue to follow both servers as always and be grateful for all the amazing content from each and every fantastic member. Thank you so very much to all the Hermtis and all the Empires for an absoutely wonderful time. Merry Christmas! Love ALL your faces!
Merry christler
Grian's prank is like a reverse saw trap:    "Hello Pearl, in front of you is my entire storage system that has been rigged to explode, you have five minutes to pick up all my items and put them into the shulker boxes I've supplied. If you fail to sort my items in time all of my items will despawn and I will be left with nothing, the clock is ticking."
2:31 Hmm things dying in the backround.
No i kneo redstone and i see he fucked up
The fact that Pixlriffs and Grian just agreed, that they'll see each other soon enough- Idk, I guess I'm just craving Pixlriffs&Grian [WATCHER] content. Who's with me, guys?  Ahhah, it would also be a great twist, if Grian one day desides to open the trapdoor and sees [DA VOID]
"Yeah it sucks for you, not for me tho." and "We go find the secret santa, this moronic idiot, this stupid idiot..." Man I love Joel, he's the best
Loved the crossover~ Was a little disappointed that it ended so quickly, specially on the Hermitcraft side where they had access to more materials to build with thanks to farms. I guess it was a holiday vacation. What started and ended from Empires with urgency, ended so casually like a holiday over at Hermitcraft LOL
I SAID IT! I SAID HE WAS GASLIGHTING! Wait... is it still gaslighting if it's unintentional?
the LORE!!!! I love your videos!
How to make a charged creeper farm in two easy steps. Step 1: Find a GOAT. Step 2. Annoy GOAT
Don’t think I’ve heard sick Grian since season 6
Cheese
I love how just asking for charged creeper was never considered as an option 😂
"You give me great pain" - Pearl
99.9999999999999…..% OF ALL MINECRAFTERS OBLITEREATED. ALL HERMITS WILL BE FOUND … HUNTED …. AND ERADICATED…. W H E R E  I S  D A D
I miss mumbo
Pixl provided the perfect ending
“I, grian, am your secret santa”  Anyone else notice the irony there?
19:43 Grian egg!
grian the present that was in your base was for joel and it was from a treasure hunt
Honestly Grian your always rather funny and your prank backfiring on you and accidentally opening someone else's gift is nice.
Loved the collab so much :[ hopefully a crossover next time again
If you ever get to do a crossover with the dream smp, then there should be a WAR! (I don’t even watch the dream smp, I just know that it’s chaotic, and would work perfectly if you guys wanted to have a war with another server.)
Having watched docs perspective first. Me: “grian is really asking for it!” Grian: actually asking for it Me: 😮
I'm gonna be honest, coal in minecraft is just like getting socks for christmas. It's uneventful and disappointing, but come on, you'll always need more socks when you least expect it.
"We had an entire interaction with another server and we didn't start a war." As if Grian wasn't the one who single handedly started both the Civil War and the Turf War.
I really loved this crossover, and it could have lasted me another few months and I would've loved it. But the most important thing is we have had about 2 months of amazing content and I fell in love with some of the empires, which I would have never had if this crossover would not have happened because to be honest, I didn't even knew Empires existed. So thank you Grian, for the amazing content, get well soon and Merry Christmas!!
Loved the vid
Why
We don’t know the seed but apparently idk the /seed command either
There needs to be a war with empires.
As they leave the server and click the other, they edit it so that they go through the portal
The snowman got that lightskin stare 😏😏
11:36 That's a nice black bull I see there. Did he build it for a reference to black clover?
Grian, even your sickly dying voice always brings a smile to our face  -the community   also           lore
I love that Grians solution to get a creeper from Doc is to annoy him instead of you know, asking 😂
While this was much funnier I'm certain Doc would have been willing to provide the charged creepers if you just asked. Likewise he would probably be happy to explain how the launching machine works.
I love that dude are you bored again?!
The rift getting smaller reminds me of the moon getting bigger in season 8, for some reason
Poor pearl
Emptity
It was a nice cross-over too bad it’s over.  I wouldn’t be surprised at all to see everyone all back together for Hermitcraft season 10.
Grian is problably the only person in minecraft to ever use a furnace minecart XD
Wow. Grian finally went through puberty, and so quickly. Amazing.
28:23 BAHSHSHAHHAA BEST PART 28:32 and he looks directly at grian 💀 28:59 LMFAO SCAR
27:13 rip crossover :c it was so amazing
Next hermitcraft u guys should take a longish break before starting it again just so it would be more fresh and you guys would want to play more and not be burnt out
Grian's sick voice was just hilarious!!!
The emptity
Make em all hermits too pleaaaseeeee
In this episode Grian moves a few items a couple of meters to the right
Happy holidays  Merry Christmas  Celebrate Enjoy Be happy
17:54
0:38   My theory is that it hapens because in multiplayer minecraft, if you leave a chest but someone dosen't it wont play the closing animation it just stays open, so, when you close a chest but there is lag, it thinks that there is still a player in the chest and leaves it open.  edit: wrong glich, but related.
18:32 im praying for pearl and her Aussie internet/ ping
"Guys, we had an interaction with an entire other server, and we DIDN'T have a war!" he sounded so genuinely surprised lol. Although I am just as surprised, I guess.
so much rizz
23:14 don't mind me, just leavin this here for a minute..
Why was the empires stay so much shorter?
Once upon a time there were modded HC servers, have you considered playing one of those? Sincerely this season is just slow, boring and seems like something done as a chore. Give yourselves a fresh start, and start in january at least, not in july, that was also a great way to make me forget about HC existing altogether.
27:58  Pearl: “I remember, sausage!”  GOSH DANG IT PEARL IMMA CRY
We prank hard but clean up harder
there something i need to ask... WHO STOLE THE DIAMOND FROM THE VAULT?XD
Get well soon Grian :>
Im sad it was the best crossover ever
Grian and doc both of you need to improve your acting skills(still better than mine) anyways merry Christmas and get well soon grian
I too, thought that it would end in war since crossover Ep. 1
Just got my groan rift merch! So awesome!
Wait so you guys get 4 or 5 episodes on the Empires server but the Empires only get like one episode?
🤣 I love how the first thing Doc says is "Dude... are you bored again?" Like Grian coming to annoy him happens twice a week.
Drink some tea with honey and lemon juice
the open chest glitch is something i see SO MUCH on servers
24:14  “decorations.”
Grian looked at the rift and went “Hmm. Rift small”
awesome video, hope you get better soon, and Happy Holidays all.
You have to keep the decoration grian and why did the rift close I hope you read this so you explain the Lore
Grian please get some rest! We adore you and are wishing you the Merriest of Merry Holidays!!! 💖💖💖
It would be “am” or “is” in your note, not “are”
It looks super evil. I love it. -Grian 2022
"Prank or present" Hermits (and maybe Empires): Both
Hope you get beter grian
I'm not sure if grian knows what a SECRET Santa is. Your not supposed to know who you get it from!
Omg that open ender chest bug is SOOO old, i remember coming across that in regular chests back in like 2011-12
Don't worry I'm sick too and have been for over a week
Gift clean my house 😂😂😂
XD yeah I always laugh at my voice, cause when talking I often go high pitch and if I've been at a tournament or a concert my voice is dead for a few days. So half the sounds just don't go off... and then I just laugh
25:50 I love how Grian's subtitles say Timmy for Jimmy. 😂
Am I the only one that found this crossover story line completely pointless? It's like, yeah, you were on each others servers, but you hardly ever interacted with one another (Only see Grians videos) and within 1-2 episodes, they were back in their original server. It's as if they were NPCs that the servers original players would ocassionaly interact.  Out of 4-5 videos? We had about 3-4 short and I mean short clips of them hanging out with one another. Again, what was the whole point? If they had made it so the portal stays open and they can come and go (or it goes to that in the future) then sure, but if this is it... Did not enjoy it  Even a single episode of second life had more going on then the entire story line here, imo.
22:22 who's gonna tell grian one of the copper blocks is too close to the other
I hope the empires side grumbot somehow is a part of the end of empires season 2.
What about FWHIP?
Building a new storage area but then not sorting the items as I take them over there would drive me crazy.
Grian: This is fine. Also Grian: Panic.
Me screamin to the screen: "BUT WHYY GRAAIN, IT DOESN'T MAKE... Oh, right "
25:30 wait but I've eaten so much turkey
I will really miss the collab :c  But hope you get well soon :D
You wrote the book wrong, after a plural name comes am, in a sense of multiple, you would use are, as in they are, or I am. Your friend, the grammar police.
16:10 pixelriffs has completed the challenge serious dedicated
Hope you get better soon
15:30 the stone is still breaking
Hermitcraft should 'invade' other SMPs People who agree 👇
22:39 Shubble: Loooooore  SolidarityGaming joined the game
Please, please, please leave it so that the one block on the riff does not close for whatever reason. That way even though for now the crossover is finished people can randomly jump across occasionally
It would have been a funny bit to have to shrink the Empires folk to one block tall to fit into the portal.
Get well soon Mary crismas
Well, your prank/present may have not actually been a present, but it’s a present to us cause that was very entertaining 😂
The "are you bored again" had me 🤣🤣🤣
Grian:  Rift is closing, its only one block and Joel and Scott have already left! Timmy: Well looks like we're staying here, guys. (Before... Empires to Hermits: No, you guys can't go home!!) (Now,... ) Grian: Anyways, lets get Empires go home. Hermit's : Here is stirs, donation box (donations are kindly accepted) (while scare: you're kindly requested to put your gear, weapons and tools here and then you all Empire's go home, and Grian: wouldn't mind those spare elytra), you all can leave. Empires: (goes home)...   I really appreciate Grian pushing through even if he was under the weather. Hoping for Grian's quick recovery.
Get better grian we had a fever through the house
Aw
Merry Christmas Grian! Have fun!
Wait the gift grian opened was scott's for joel i think?
Merry Christmas and a Happy new year!
merry christmas grian!! hope you feel better soon :))
Grian's sick voice sounds so cute!!!
Pix did the most amazing cyclical joke and I love him for it
Just like evo fr fr
I don't know why but you and pearl look like childhood friends
Grian building the stairs reminds me of evo❤
Why does sick Grian sound so nostalgic
23:03 MUMBO JUMBO YOU ARE AFK-voice🕺💃
Build mumbos base for him
it‘s sad. hermitcraft x empire is the crossover that shouldn‘t have ended. like, ever 🥲
i just realized the title says Hermitcraft: in stead of Hermitcraft 9:
23:00 this is the first time I've ever heard any youtubers get a bad voice, damn, I hope you get better quickly
😊
i had a feeling that you would still pick pearl
The byes sounded like teletubbies
"We had an entire interaction wtih another server, and we didn't have a war!" Scar: "I like war" *proceeds to go through the portal*
Doc was way too eager to pull the kill switch
If you like wars so much do a crossover with the dream smp :)
Didnt Xisuma and Pixlriffs make a copper ageing machine?
Get well soon but keep that voice, it is hilarious. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
You should’ve gotten a lot of salmon heads.
Great ep, be well soon! Merry holidays!
i think grian forgot the meaning of "secret" santa
Doc is online at the moment
THE LAWWWSSS
the present was not for you
11:25 wait.. what.. pet-- pet dragon?
20:58 the way Pearl says secret santa is an example of complete, pure Aussie accent I should know, im Aussie too :D
No one: Everyone on the server: “where’ll I put this present? Oh, I know! Grian’s place’ll do, nice and original!”
Dam already done!
def gonna go start watching empires now. im starting to miss the crossover already and i remember when they were just strangers to me
That was awesome. Happy holidays!
this has genuinely been one of my favorite arcs of all time. I have thoroughly loved this. thank you so much guys!
Merry chrismas Grian, hope you get better.
You know what’s another word for Prank or Present?…  Trick or Treat
When Grian went to notice everyone at the christmas donut, people were gathering around a fireplace like a family, and what a big ol' family it is. I already feel nostalgic the moment they when through.
Grian's raspy and squeaky voice was adorable but i hope he gets well soon
New SMP Idea: It's just like a regular SMP but all the players must have a variant of Grian's skin. It'll be called "Into the Grianverse." NPC Grian is the villain, he tears down all the Grians' bases and replaces them with rustic houses. At the end, all the Grians will take down NPC Grian in an epic boss fight.
FWhip didn't go through   L
I like Jim's hat
What a fun episode! ♥ Happy holidays everyone!
Grian, I hope you rest well and that you get well soon ^^
Go to x .pixel made a copper masine
That was awesome! Loved the prank and the backfire also how you pulled DocM into it. The goodbyes were very cute but came about very quickly, kinda wish I had been a little bit more of a witness of that campfire meeting. Captain Chaos has struck again. Thank you, take care, hope you get well soon.
When Doc said 'you called for it" it really got me😂🤣
That wreath around the portal was really nice 👌
You had tiny war over you leveing empires
Loved this crossover with Hermitcraft and Empires. Merry Christmas!! ✨🎄✨
That's what they get for unaliving my man Grumbot™. All he wanted was a Mumbo Jumbo in Empires but there was none :(
24:11
Jokes on you Grian, I knew you would stick with pearl.
oh  Grian I hope you feel better soon.  I hope there is possibly a future another crossover event with Hermits and Empires that was epic.  because it truly is the gift that keeps on giving
WE WANT MULTIVERSE WAR
I loved pearls reaction and you pulling her again 😂 coincidence I think not!…
The Empires members slowly leaving Hermitcraft got me kinda sad, especially Pixlriffs leaving with literally "Bro played an outro song while leaving"
Grian, you've got to get the hermitcraft members to agree to add a new member, Shovel 241
gRian sick voice!!! Reminds me of mumbo afk song
I the mysterious grian ARE hmm yes, spot on grammar lmao
0:21 Hah, I was hoping that's what happened, because I thought it was fitting that you'd get to prank Pearl 😅
Wouldn't it be easier to get a normal creeper into the area and  hanwllonf trident it
You should just use TNT. 1. Charged Creeper can kill Pearl 2. Creepers don't give you a 100% drop chance 3. You put all your items in there 4. TNT has 100% drop chance
Feel better soon
You should do a lifesteal cross over
"and we didn't have a war" classic Grian
The crossover was disappointing because there was no war grian. It wasn't a win for content.
Grians prank for pearl is savage cause he said she's a cleaning lady but wait she's a woman sooooo
Why was the Hermit side of the cross over so short
What happened to mumbo's base
It' be really cool if and when Mumbo returns, he does so from a portal all rummaged up and is like "I've been travelling through dimensions non-stop guys, you've no idea the trouble of getting back here!"
"Dude, are you bored again?"
I don't know if this is the case but if this was the plan for the rift the entire time then cudos
If they ever do another crossover, they should DEFINITELY have a war
"Are you bored again?" Grian in a nutshell when he's bored.
I have no clue why one frame of charged creepers being launched is so funny but it is
love that moment of "ha ha it worked... wait that's my stuff! what was I thinking!"
Pp
Hehe I kinda thought that he's actually gonna get pearl again ^^ it's just a Grian thing to do
Yay! Grian learned and started using oak for the farm!
grian just make a storage room and stop talking about the chest monster pls
Awesome episode! Love the Secret Santa prank! Aw sucks they had to leave so soon, feels like they just got here and barely got here. That was really fun to watch though! Hope you get well soon! Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays! See you later!
for oxidizing copper there is no real difference between having all of them together or spread out, so just make a giant cube of all the copper you want to stock and wait awhile and eventually it will be oxidized
dëćerations ! Omg someone does love me  But whome
The crossover was amasing! Merry Christmas, Grian!
That secret Santa was for Joel 😂
He should have written grianch instead of grian
I can't be the only one who genuinely expected Mumbo to pop up online and drop down into the hole as soon as Pix left, just to be like "Hey guys, what'd I miss?"
17:20 the emptity
I definitely teared up when the empire’s guys left, I’m sad that it’s over but the crossover has been amazing
Grian being sick sounds like me when I get a croaky voice
Can't we just keep the Empire guys? The series and the server just felt so much more lively with them and they fit in so well :(
The ending gives me EVO vibes
We never saw the rift ACTUALLY close. It's like Shrodinghers portal, it is both closed and open at the same time until revealed to us.
Grian It was not a bit gone to naught, I cracked up laughing pretty hard
9:57 "Grian, is the portal small?"
oh Grian you praked us by using a prank but there was no prank
What a fun episode! Loved the prank/present and the farewell to Empires. Hope you feel well soon, Grian!
"I've got the redstone ready to go" Also grian: Nothing there
I know how you feel Grian. Was out of work for almost a week and I sounded like a chain-smoker for most of it. Hope you feel better soon!
Pearl is a better person than I am because I would've let everything despawn and been like "Wow, now that's cleaned up, see how much better your area looks without a chest monster?"
Hope you will be better soon, merry Christmas! :)
The real prank was getting Pearl to partake in a shulker monster
⠀
It was my birthday yesterday
A little unfortunate that the empires folks left so soon, but such is life! This crossover was amazing! I can’t wait to see what grumbot has to say next episode.
I will miss the empire crew such a great idea. Hope there will be more interactions in the future.
an amazing few weeks its been gotta say i was expecting someone to just be like "this is my home now" and stay on hermitcraft but im interested to see how gem figures her lore. great video and get better soon!
Get well soon man, Btw your an inspiration to many of my builds and my play style, I wish I could be with y’all in this server but they don’t offer pocket edition a hermit craft server or anything like that. Amazing video as always.  P.S. my redstone in survival most of the time looks worse than that being in bedrock and I’m not organized either so it’s ok😅
Just listening to you was making me feel sick. Feel better my friend, we need you awesome vids.
"Dude, are you bored again?!" -Docm77 to Grian
It's hilarious that Grian got coal for Christmas.
25:21 What the cub doing?
Did anyone else see a hermit fly in grains nether portal at the end of this video😂
you sound american 🤣
I was so wrong
I truly enjoyed this crossover between my favorite mc servers! Pix's farewell was so funny I love it. Merry Christmas Grian!
FIX THE SCULK ON YOUR STONE PLS
i cant un see it
Emptity restocked
Omg I can't believe the annoy doc plan worked :DDD
“If you don’t clean it…it’s going to stay that way for the rest of the season.”  “Noar”
I just noticed an interesting pattern on grian’s sweater…
Hey grian! Just a quick question about merch, will the store ever be restocked? Or was is it a limited time only sorta thing? Thanks so much!!! :)
🌼
Was I the only one who saw that he got pearl again last episode
Its so sad to see the Empires go home but it was awesome to watch the crossovers
17:17  the "empity"
i want to know if the rift will ever open again
You should have called this episode “THE CROSS IS OVER”
"Don't pick holes, we just cover them up and pretend they don't exist" advice to live by
absolutely loved the video as always!! loved the prank and i hope you feel better soon!!<3
✨ᴰᵉᶜᵒʳᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿˢ ✨
The amount of videos on your channel, nice.
restwell Grian
Can't wait for Grian to have another batch chest monsters 2 episodes later.
I imagined Grian going to the end meeting thing wrapped in a blanket, warm tea in a mug, and tissues falling out of sweatpants
12:25 Doc: Dude. Are you bored again?  26:49 EVO flashbacks, oh gosh, i Remember they did the staircase to travel through updates if i’m not mistaken   28:35 “The gift that keeps on giving” -Grian  28:57 No War yaaay
Hope you feel better grian Merry Christmas!
It would be amusing if there was one left behind.
Buttons! ... charged creepers and entity lag! What a funny episode! Stay frosty Grian and Happy Holidays!
Merry Christmas Grian. Have a wonderful holiday.
Boop
This is a really small detail but you are missing 9 in your title!
Timmy falling when entering the portal reminds me a lot about Evo Smp
since when is it just hermitcraft???
moon big  rift smoll
Get well soon Grian, and enjoy xmas :)
Sad to see them go, I so enjoyed their interactions
Thank you for putting all this together! It has been wonderful seeing you interacting with all your friends. Here's hoping you feel better soon 💝
I'm sure someone else has commented this, but Pixlriff's and Xisuma built a copper aging machine under X's base, like the one Pix has on Empires! I'm sure you could use that for aging copper up for restocking the Entity.
The last time I heard sick grian like this... *F L A S H B A C K S *.... H E.... was afk
they where in the server for too short of a time man
If you need to age copper ask Xisuma! He's got a DAVE machine from pix!
I hope they visit when beef and tango their games are finished
But was that the end of THR LORE?
i want pix to join hermitcraft for good 😢 he fits in really well and seems like hes already been a part of the community for a long time. i hope he gets invited for season 10.
Grian sure does love some explosions
I never would have expected to hear Grian sing Eminem in a video
Oh I can’t wait for Pearl’s video.
I was honestly thinking jumbo was gonna come through the rift right as it closes
Hilarious that instead of asking doc nicely to have a charged creeper he decided to poke the goatto get the horns.
if you slow the video all the way down you can see the creepers fly by for longer then if you watch it normally and it is still cool to watch
We both have chest monsters
Grian: Is this my present? Me who already saw Scott's video: ._.
Your deep voice is so cute
Wonder if an empires member got stuck on hermitcraft? We will see
The crossover has been great. Sad to see Empires people go. And I think your snowman looks more suspicious than angry. He's watching you Grian.
*_____*
Merry Christmas British people
Grian quoted eminem
11:42 First editing mistake ever made in grians channel
Hmmmm this prank seems familiar, right scar
I was expecting mumbo suddenly coming out of the portal saying he saved the empires server from GrumBot
i was played a fool...
Miss the 9 🗿
I wish pix could've stayed
17:35 insta weathered copper d.d
Merry Christmas Grian! Hope you fell better soon. God bless!
I knew it was gonna be pearl again! I'm not one to ruin fun tho
Merry Christmas Grian!
Parting is such sweet sorrow. They will be missed. Maybe they'll find a way to get a Mumbo Jumbo in Empires and then the Rift can stay open so y'all can visit each other any time you like.
why didn't you have a war. A multi-serveral portal could result in a big war
The way doc said "what are you doing- Are you bored again???"
Me before Pearl was pranked: Grian, you have buttered your own toast once again. Me after Pearl was pranked: Now, I'm not one to say "I told you so," but...
Lol I wasn't going to tell, but I had a feeling you'd stick with Pearl ;)
I KNEW IT 0:25
I LOVE SICK GRIANS LAUGH!!! ITS SO SILLY
Me, a veteran Scott follower, watching Grian open the box: 👀
Are we gonna talk about Grian accidentally stealing Joel's present?
12:20  doc's "dude are you bored again" explains grian's relationship with almost every hermit and i love it
Wasnt the Allay at the secret santa gift holding a book?
Hi Grian,  today is my birthday so I'm really happy that you released an episode today
I love that rather than asking doc for a charged creeper he just decided to annoy doc into doing it
Grian really read Doc mind HAHAHA
uhh I think you missed the "9" in the title after hermitcraft
18:18 creeper explode
Doc's immediate response to Grian's attempt of shooting the Ender dragon will never cease to impress me that the man knows Grian does this kind of thing  when he's bored.
now time for the lifesteal crossover
The fact that Lizzie hasn’t posted throughout most of the crossover
Grian: "The portal has shrank becoming a one block portal" Everyone: Panicking*  Literally Oli: "But I've eaten so much turkey"
LOL. I can't wait to see Pearl's point of view, hahahahaha.
Doc: Dude are you bored again 🤣
Maybe the snowman’s not angry, they could be squinting because they need glasses
You should’ve told Pearl there’s a rouge charged creeper somewhere. Her being in constant fear while cleaning the chest monster out of pure pain would be.. fantastical!
Ori-G-nal
Would not mind a permanent server merger
Thanks for the captions!
fantastic crossover, maybe a little short on the hermitcraft side. i hope you guys find a way to keep the connection going
Last season: the moon’s getting bigger This season: the portal’s getting smaller
that portal closing would have been the greatest method for adding a few new hermits
“Dude, are you bored again” tells me he’s done this before lol
Us, (do a prank and present) Grian, (ok! I will do neither a prank nor present
this makes absolute sense to me. but i speak moron so i guess it would. good job grian
remember cheapslate?
Grain took someone else's secret Santa from next to grumbot
Honestly, I'd love it if Hermitcraft and Empires merged, although I'd prefer it to be by hermitcrafts rules.
Wow. I was right last episode saying that they were going to end up making the portal smaller than normal.
get well soon grian!
That was a fun sendoff to the Empires Crew, I know for a fact I'll be picking up a few of them now thanks to this crossover.
If you have to age your copper blocks, luckily Pix left a copper aging machine below Xisuma's base before he left.
The crossover was so fun :), I’ve had empires videos in my recommended for a long time but I just never got around to it, pixs has indeed gained a new viewer and fan from this and I’ll likely give some of the others a watch at some point, happy holidays to you and everyone else here (:
sick grian sounds like he did 10 years ago in the craftedmovie behind the scenes videos lol
Poor Pearl! You're giving her grief from just knowing you are leaving that MESS MONSTER like that! Very funny episode. Thank you for giving us such a treat. Take care, and have a happy holiday!
Get well Grian I'm also sickly
very bummed that the crossover is over already. we hardly got any time of the empires folks on the hermitcraft server :( was really hoping the portal would stay open indefinitely so people could visit eachother at least. regardless it has made me very excited for the next life series!
thank god its over
merry Christmas Grian
"dEcOrAtiOnS" Lad needs sleep 😭
God the Pix jokes were hilarious.
idk if you imitiated this crossover Grian, but this was genius! What an imense amount of fun this was! So much that I kinda have tears in my eyes, knowing it is over. Thank you so much, to everyone who particepated! See you in the next episodes!
The shenanigans with the hermitcraft recap that came from this crossover were definitely my favorite part and I'm a little sad that things are returning to normal now. Was really fun while it lasted
Fun fact, the next episode will be in the new year.   Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2023 to Hermitcraft, Empires and all of you in the comments section. Hope 2023 will bring better days to all of us. Cheers 🥂.
This week on Hermitcraft… Pix goes home :( but we’re all still excited to see some of the regularly scheduled program after such a fun crossover
I love Hoimeycraft, but this collaboration shows how much the server needs some fresh faces.
merry christmas grian i love your videos 💖💝❤❤
is mumbo coming back in the hermitcraft server cuz i kinda miss her now
Is it bad that I got a bit nostalgic at hearing Grian’s sick voice and remembering season 6 lol 😅
Moms spaghetti
“Dude- are you bored again??” -Doc  A-again??? Has this happened before???? How often does grian just get bored in the server and just harass the other hermits- /pos
EYYYYYYY
"I like war"  GTWS 2022
I remember watching the evo videos when i found out about grians channel and seeing those stairs was like a nostalgia blast from ages ago
Did he name it?
Usually when a youtuber says "I'm a little sick, so my voice is different" I don't notice any change.  This was not the usual experience, I can tell you that much.
Feel better! Merry Christmas!!
Grian should have had Scar play the music before he went through.
Am I the only one that noticed Fwhip wasn't in the crowd of Empires leaving?
Petition to have pix join hermitcraft permanently!!!!!
Happy Christmas and a speedy recovery.
This crossover was amazing. I hope you guys continue doing stuff like this every once in a while.. I've heard there are some other guys with a lore-heavy smp with some lime-green guy running the whole thing.
I was hoping that Mumbo would pop through the rift at the end
22:00 lmao
I wonder if doc can shoot you put of the creeper tree
Why did I laugh so hard at doc’s reaction to Grian “attempting” to shoot the dragon?
Grian: Builds stairs to portal OG fans: *War flashbacks*
Nevermind it's good the way it is 😊😊
Come on give pix a offer to join hermit craft.
Women
Get well soon. and Merry Christmas.
15:32? Subtle Eminem reference. Nice. Not so PG now lol
Grian the resolution of the vid isnt very good
The "Dude, are you bored again" line from Doc says a lot about living with grian on a server
why not just keep the crossover forever
I swear if another moon fall to this server, the last things pearl will do is clean all grian chestmonster 🤣🤣🤣
Greg's is in the shulker...Save your song grian!!!!
Let's just hope that Snowman doesn't eat you again. (I wonder if people will know what I'm talking about)
Hope You Get Well Soon Grian Also Merry Christmas
It was so much fun having the Empires players on Hermitcraft.  In my opinion, they could've been here much longer, it was nice having them around!
....Hermitcraft dictates way to much what I watch on YouTube. now I watch all the hermits and now the Empire
Grian, that snowman looks like you owe him money.   "WHERE'S MY MONEY PUNK?"
idk if its just me or not, but I barely watched HC when the crossover was happening. did anyone else feel like it wasn’t worth watching?
To that one guy that called me a loser for scanning every frame last episode to see what Grian's Secret Santa was... you're right.
12:06 grian looking down and seeing doc rapidly approaching
Me reads title: "Noooooo, not yet."   Also me: *literally tears up*
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
Imagine if he starts a war again it would really boost the raitings I think....
this cross over would go down in Minecraft history
your not doing fresh animations any more
"dude are you bored again" doc really knows grian
*me who told pearl grian got you as a prank*💀💀
If you had a nickel for every time you got tricked in this epidsode , then you would have 2 nickels, which isn't much, but it's odd that its happened twice.
Good job grain, no war for now
23:14 ᵂʰᵃᵗ  24:11 ᵈᵉᶜᵒʳᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿˢ Sad you were under the weather but something beautiful did come out of it!
15:33 grian=eminem
I wish shelby was a member of hermitcraft
Please get well soon Grian ! Also , anyone else curious if the portal was actually in that one block ? Lol . Merry Christmas everyone ! God bless ! 😊
Somehow, I miss this episode,  and was on the brink of explosion, waiting to know who you got, and you still got Pearl?? *Logs into minecraft and explodes self repeatedly *
lol, that prank ended up so cute! I love Pearl and Grian both for being cute sometimes... Random experience I had today (dunno why I'm putting it here, ig bc it's also cute, lol) I was walking through a park and a woman showed up in the parking lot and opened her trunk, I didn't pay her any attention tho until she started feeding ducks. OMG so many ducks, all Mallard, there was easily 100 of them at least! maybe she makes a ritual out of this and so they know to gather at the one spot... It was super cute tho, I wish I had my phone to record it! I wanted to go meet the woman but I didn't bc I would have for sure scared the ducks. <3
Get well soon!
It's official. Doc = North Korea
Imagine dream smp x hermitcraft lmao
I always enjoy a Grian episode, obviously, but this has to be one of my favorites ever -- between "slightly annoying Doc" and the prank on Pearl and the musings of "I WILL need another charged creeper..." This episode was just SO fun. Feel better soon!
cross over ended to soon.. seems like the hermits spent more time on empire than they spent in hermitcraft
of course you're blowing someone up.
i love how scar has done chest monsters worse than this not as a prank
Come to think of it either you’re gonna have a really long season this time around or y’all will have to start downloading snapshots of the upcoming 1.20 update
Wait, does this mean Cleo is now the Queen!?
hopefully next season empires and hermitcraft merge??
I know Grian is done with EVO but all the pranks and then seeing the emperors taking it in turns to go through the portal while everyone else shouts "good luck" or "see you on the otherside" (not to memtion Jimmy acting as slightly ineffectual law enforcement) really does take me back. This crossover has been so much fun (hopefully for the creators as well as the fans!) and I really hope we can see something similar in the future! Mad props to Grian for organising it! (I think I read somewhere that he was behind this? Forgive me if I'm wrong)
I really really hope that the Empire peeps get to come back to compete in Decked out and Beef's Hermitcraft Card game.
That moment that Grian starts to reference Eminem’s Lose Yourself 😎
15:30 grian just became eminem
i just sore someone says  loreeee did matpat join and said that
that is the proof we needed to prove that doc is a brilliant mad man.
Goofy ahh sounds from pearl
Forcing a woman to clean up a mess you made, classic grian content
Yeah, no duh, what were you thinking? I know no one in the entire world actually has only two brain cells, but I think your problem is that you only have two brain cells that actually communicate to each other and the rest of your brain is dead 18:44
I really enjoyed the cross-overs, great fun.  Hope you get better soon.
grian name your new allay :)
Having the Empires crew be on the Hermitcraft Server was actually amazing, and also having the Hermits be on the Empires Server as well... What A Fantastic Crossover that has been and I'm not entirely sure what'll happen next
Snowman be sus.
surprised they didn't kidnap pixel and force him to remain on Hermitcraft
Please please please get Sausage and Pix on HC!
Get well soon and Merry Christmas!
Hope you feel better mate. Gotta say, that squeaky voice is adorable, but I'm sure it cannot be fun. Rest well, and merry Christmas!
Grian plopping a trap door onto the rift like tour guide sticking a bit of chewing gum onto a crack at the Hoover Dam
MERRY CHRISTMAS GRIAN!! Hope you feel better!!

What a great arc crossover this has been. Feel better!
Why would you sacrifice your own items just to prank somebody? You know what you’re right! That makes absolutely no sense what you’re doing but in a different way than you’re thinking
Grian is The Architect!  The Architect of chaos and fun and adventure. These crossovers have been an absolute delight! Thank you Grian and everyone from Empires and Hermitcraft. I hope you have a peaceful holiday season. 💕 ❄️ 🎄☃️ 🎄 ☃️❄️💕
that squinting snowman is HILARIOUS
19:57 Kid:- Mom we need Andrew Garfield Laugh at home Mom:- We have Andrew Garfield Laugh at home   Andrew Garfield Laugh at home:
OMG YES 30 mins long?? i like
I think tango might be stuck on the empires server. I dont remember seeing him come back through? Anyone else thinking the same?
"I are your secret santa..." Poor Grain am overtaxed.
I was waiting for Pixelriffs to stay 😭😭
Missed upportunity of making a chest within a chest within a chest
I remember when Grian said in a video that he was going to learn redstone. 😢 I'm so proud
"I think I failed that"  Well ok sort of, the initial idea was brilliant but always flawed... the overall effect was amazing for us the viewer... so win?
NOOO THE TITLE IM IN DENIAL PLEASE I LOVE THIS CROSSOVER
Gutted was so hoping pix would stay. He's such a lovely guy infaxt they all are, he just fits . another great episode ,Merry Christmas.
I'm gana miss them  loved the collab this season!
The real prank is when pearl just turns around and walks away as all of Grian’s items disappear.
Coming from Joel's video and now seeing grians side makes me sad, like secret Santa you gotta put the gift getters name on the gift! Especially when it's in someone else's base 😭, poor grian
I recommend the ItemScroller Mod.
Your prank or present was really high stakes lol
I was si sad with pix leaving, much respect to him, that leaving was emotional
Grian placing stairs up to the portal gave me flashbacks of EVO
in the Future we need a war between the 2 servers for sure
13:00 You technically saw exactly 2 frames of a creeper
We need the work song back from season 7 I believe
I almost reared up when sausage was saying bye. 😢
Is it just me or dies Pearl sound slightly russian
Oh my god, Pix's last words were just chef kiss 😝😂
Grian’s squeaky voice was the best lol, hope you feel better soon!
You could say it’s a crossOVER
Biuild swap
Just had did a secret Santa and asked for a lot of printer paper, and got a big box with 500 sheets of paper :D
I wish pix was staying, he'd make a great hermit.
I actually felt sad seeing the Empires people go :(
28:15  He’ll be watching
Guess I’m not the only one who’s under the weather haha - hope u get well soon dude! Make sure to drink plenty and rest :)
Entity? More like emptity...
Sad face, it was lots of fun to watch.  Merry Christmas!
get better grian!!! don't exert yourself
Grian get well soon!
i miss the crossover already lol, that was amazing
this was nice
The fact that you managed to manipulate the GOAT is actually quite impressive.
5:25 I DIDN’T KNOW SHEEP WAS A REDSTONE COMPONENT???
You sound just as well as I do
"I like war" "scar no"
17:33 can we talk about how that copper before the cut instantly aged
it would kind of be cool if the next life series was hermits vs empires. only thing is that there would be a lot of people.
16:45 it means you have an explosive personality
Am I the only one to notice that he didn't put 9 after "Hermitcraft"?
Switch to barrel monsters. Then you can push them using pistons
The rift:(is shrinking) Me imagining Grian right before 2023: "We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year, NOW GO BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!" [Edit: I didn't watch the video through (nor did I at the time of typing this)]
ayyy mumbo can come out of the closet and play hermitcraft now xD
0:30 grain i knew you did that. it was easy to tell
Happy one year anniversary of moon big!
I KNEW THAT YOU KNEW THAT YOU FOOLED US INTO THINKING THAT WE DIDNT KNOW EVEN THOUGH WE DID KNOW. They should of known, classic Grain. 🤦‍♂️
27:33 Cleo and Pearl (I think) said bye at the same time at the same pitch lol
.                        Hi grian
Hope you get to feeling better Grian! Happy Holidays!
Same prank, but next time put an ungodly amount of hopper minecarts underneath so everything gets sucked up and they think it all got destroyed or despawned
Gotta love shifty the snowman
Doc asking if grian was bored again like this has absolutely happened before
history really does rhyme doesnt it? not quite repeat, but it does rhyme. building stairs up to a portal
I’m so sad the collab is over, that was a joy of 6-8 weeks and I’m so sad the chaos is done
i sure hope that slime block truggers
Today on hermitcraft : LORE
Is Mumbo ever coming back?
Get well soon!!
I don’t know what was crying more pearl or the server with all those free floating items 🤣
I thought, what would be the best option to fool the audience? Sticking to Pearl. Look how the turns have tabled B)
funny how the first guy to leave is the 1 person who can walk there the hole.
Love how grian sees a man with a mysterious creeper cannon a pet warden and a pet dragon and says im going to poke it. Never change Grian keep poking the beast.
The crossover was so so so much fun to watch. The event of the century for SURE! I only wish it could have been slightly longer. A month on each server was like… four videos worth for each person (two in each server) at most (excluding like Impulse, Xisuma, and Pixl who seemed to update every two days - it was glorious). But oh god, the best part I think was definitely allll of the hermitcraft recap jokes. Absolutely amazing and I love that Pix joined in on it after that first time. Ranchers reunion was also something that everyone was anticipating and it was everything we needed to move on.  Some awesome interactions: Jev, Keralis and Sausage, the amazing trio I didn’t know I needed to see. Tango and everyone has been fun to see but Tango and Shelby was absolutely the coolest, he never got to become a frog :’( . Joe and Oli, I don’t usually watch them much but together they are THE weirdest (in a positive way), my Christmas present to me is going to be catching up on all of joes streams with Oli. Doc and Lizzy interaction was short but really sweet, their vibes are just so different. And on top of the interactions, there’s just been so many fun moments and events. Tag, prank or present, the battle at the empires rift, Skulkfan, the monster hunter magical girls, joes cover letters, tiny Tom. I know a vocal minority didn’t care for the crossover and were leaving nasty comments, but I absolutely love the crossover! It’s been so much fun to watch and I hope it happens again, along with things like the charity event! Little events where special guests can appear on the server are such a great idea!!
"We had an interaction with an entire other server, and didn't have a war, I think that's a win!!!" Got me dying laughing 🤣 😂            We loved the hermit-empires crossover
This is a work of art. Hope you feel better soon G!
I wonder why grian has so much crying obsidian?   Couldn't possibly be to do with the crying obsidian in the rift
The fact that he said are you board AGAIN
Hey correct me if I'm wrong but Grain went to another server, had interactions with ppl from a different server, have them settle in HC for weeks and he did not start a war     I deem tht as the most amazing thing here..... Grain.... The War Making Grain did not start a war
The crossover was really enjoyable to watch, though it would be nice if they could pop back to play Vintage Beef's card game and Tango's Decked Out.
I was hoping this portal stuff would end with the return of Mumbo.
'in hindsight this was a bad idea' IN HINDSIGHT?! this was a bad idea from the very second you conceived it XD
Grian theres a problem with your prank or prese- hold on a second someone rung my doorbell      help im getting swatted
Jokes on you! I went to every hermitcraft and empires member and told them you pulled their name for the secret Santa!
I lost it when Pix started the Recap outro. Man this whole crossover has been so much fun, only downside is I now have another 2 minecraft series to keep up with 😅
26:20  *EVO flashbacks intensify*
I wish you get better asap, nothing sötét Than getting sick near holliday
Did the other hermits call it the emptity?
grian are you a watcher?
Lost it at Doc's exasperated "Dude, are you bored again?"
"Is it just me, or does the rift look smaller?" "Yep, rifts' small."
I’m wondering, Lizzie went through the portal right? She just hasn’t posted in months, so I’m wondering if she’s trapped in HC?
I like how doc's first reaction was, "Grian, are you bored?"😂🤣
The Emptity
I knew Jimmy shouldn’t have put Joel’s present there. Especially with no ‘this is for’ sign!
thanks for the episode hope you feel well soon !!!!!
Merry Christmas Grain, get better! :D
I was hoping Sausage would stay
24:11 Bro really said *"ᵈᵉᶜᵒʳᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿˢ"*
Merry Christmas!!! I hope that Grian gets better in time for Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Grian!
Sad to see the crossover finish but it was fun while it lasted. The secret Santa antics were great but I wonder who your secret Santa was.
Honestly kinda sad about it ending already? The hermits were on empires for well over a month meanwhile the empire guys got like 2.5 weeks on HC?  I was hoping for it to keep going a bit longer.
get better soon :)
He started sounding like me in a recording
what I wonder now tho is... was the rift just clever editing or an actual bungee cord portal. I mean they're both very established servers, adding a plugin like that should be easy work for them. Either way it doesn't really change anything about the crossover having been amazing!  just something I was curious about.
if that creeper despawned it would have been tragic comedy
Why do grian's base "Dwayne" and Joel's base "stratos" have the same theme? Floating island, quartz and copper?
My conspiracy theory is that mumbo is still on hermitcraft and is doing all the rift stuff and loading grumbot
I get you Grian, I was had a cold a month ago and I still haven’t gotten my higher pitched vocals.
Merry Christmas grian! Hope you get better!
Doc being so predictable and grian taking full advantage of it rather than just asking for a charged creeper
FYI: there could be a chance that pearl enters from the wrong ribbon, and the whole plan goes kaput
Merry Christmas grian!
After seeing that present I could of swore it was going to be full of chickens! Man I really just want to see the return of poultry man
"Every day I find a new way of breaking this game" -Grian 2022 "Every day I find a new way of breaking this game" -DocM77 from within the womb
Merry Christmas  Grian    Even though I identify as a wolf
moon big, portal small?
grian play touhou
Everyone pointing out the differences between servers when learning the other group has to go home but you guys...  They're //Hermits// of Course they'll provide a staircase to the rift to get everyone out of their home 😂
Make an end base or nether base
Someone last episode predicted it was gonna be Pearl again
13:11 YEEEET
So cool!
How does it feel like  so much but also nothing happened in the crossover. Like, sorry if this makes me sound negative, but  it felt like everything on the empires server was tires spinning withput friction, and then back on hermitcraft had friction but also felt very minor like its just the holiday special  for Hermitcraft and Empires instead of a crossover.
I discovered on Twitter about the Multiverse SMP… I- just- LIKE 6 DIFFERENT SMPS ARE CONNECTED SOMEHOW-
Grians base was made for Christmas decorations
You know I wonder if it'll even work considering Ryan's track record with doing this because he keeps forgetting that it doesn't matter how close you are to a creeper if there's a block between your feet and hit you will probably survive
grian: im one of those people who go on holiday and dont unpack i just live out of my suitcase me: dont call me out like that
Get well soon and merry christmas
If this is truly the end of the crossover THIS IS THE WORST CHRISTMAS EVER 😰
Green finally got a voice😂
it is Christmas Eve tomorrow :)
Even tho its really sad to see them go, its been anamazing Crossover and i hope we will get to see you all together again at some point  PS: i love how Pix went out
I KNEW HE GOT PEARL AGAIN! I COULD FEEL IT
_decorations_
I would just like to say, I knew he would get Pearl again. There, I said it, and I feel better now
I organized Grian's chest monster in hermitcraft season 6 but then I lost the world
The rift leaving thing reminded me of evo smp honesty
Imagine if you'd added a timer with audible chimes to make the cleaning even more stressful
I actually got scared when Doc literally shot Grians base with charged Creepers with so much power xD
You didn't nametag the creeper
Anyone else screaming when he opened the gift box........
grians true prank or present is himself
Grian being shocked by the ender chest being opened just tells me he doesn't play survival a lot lol
18:56 your lucky she didn't "clean it" with flint and steal (anyone's mother ever threaten to clean your room up with a garbage bag?)
Aww it felt like they the Empire people were on Hermitcraft for a few weeks.
It started with: *"This week on hermitcraft... ME!"*  and ended with: *"My name has been Pixlriffs, my writer's been ZloyXP, captions on this video has been provided by Lyarrah. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week."*    *_PERFECTION_*
How did she survive the charged creeper?
Yeah we kinda knew it was pearl, we knew even you thought it was cheaty to reroll a hermit
You just made my day by posting your video. Thank you! Also when you built the stairs up to  the portal it reminded me of the EVO server. (Mabye that could be The Rift”s destination when it opens up again.)
Missed naming potential by not calling it “the cross is over”
Me watching this video while also being sick: me too Grian, me too
Personally feels kinda forced cuz I thought they will stay until very Xmas
Grian putting steps to the Right was very nostalgic...*Evo flashbacks*
Pixllriifffs endin
Y’all shoud visit truly bedrock
i was really hoping the rift would close before one of them made it thru as their introduction to being a regular
26:31 *Evo flashbacks begin*
21:42 we found «naur» in the wild
Plz do this with the lifesteal smp next time
12:08 Doc said "Are you bored again?" This means that this is a regular Grian activity, poking others on the server
How did this not end with a portal breaking noise?
Idea for quickly moving items from one chest area to another, but also in a "fun" way. Layer of chests with hoppers. Kill yourself on top of the hoppers. Items get distributed randomly. ;)
Amazing video I don’t even notice your sick unless you say it hope you get better
bye Grian hope you get better and Merry early Christmas!!
Hope you feel better soon grain and Merry Christmas.
WHERE IS MUMBO
Scott and Joel just leaving without telling anybody hilarious😂😂, yes I do know that Scott left a sign but like, that’s besides the point
wouldve been funny if pixylriffs was tried going back but the portal completely closed off and wouldve been like i guess im your librarian now
... Grian opening Joels present lmao.... I was seriously wondering why Scott didn't place a tag for joel when building the present XD
Where is LDshadowlady?(lizzie)
I hope you guys do more with Empires server, I loved having Pix, Timmy, Sausage, and everyone joining you!
Grian, you absolutely NEED more trees on the rocks.
pixelriffs's exit simply amazing, best hermitcraft session 9 quote so far
THAT WAS NOT YOUR PRESENT
When your sick you sound like me
0:45 doc be like:
Plz do a crossover with Camp Minecraft!!!
Nah, next time you poke the GOAT, he'll come up with something far more devious than launching another charged creeper
Merry Christmas Grian! 🎄
broooo i would love to see Grian play FNAF
28:47 Well there was that whole Fort Riftless thing...
I'm gonna miss seeing the two servers interact. This could have gone on longer. :) Also: Grian remains pure chaos.
The ender chest means there was somebody els in your base
Me When I saw the name of this video: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Please can someone teach Grian about 17:42 cliroo-anti-physics to shoot creepers
I had guessed that you had gotten pearl a second time, when I watched last episode.
The worst funny punishment for the Cleaning Lady.
Sick grian sounds like what I imagine a 12 year old grian sounds like 22:59
Grian, I would like you to know that your sick voice sounds like a Gen 1 My Little Pony
Yay no more king
25:40 i love how they are moving when they heared joel and scott left already😂😂😂😂
At this point I am fully expecting to see about half of the empires members and hopefully mumbo join the next season of hermitcraft.
It would have been so cool if the portal stayed open, and they all could just come and go from server to server as they pleased all throughout the season.
The portal bit reminds me of Evo. Especially how Tim and Sausage fell down instead of going in the first time.
Sorry you’re not feeling well Grian. Know that we love your content so so much. But also know, we care about you. We can wait for content. Give yourself time and take the rest you need to feel better!
Just wait till the portal to the Lifesteal SMP opens (ya'll are screwed).
The Emptity
We don't come here to make sense, we come here to make nonsense and have fun doing it!!
He sounds like 13-14 years old 😂
Prank and present Pearl in the present of a prank
Anyone else feeling nostalgic with the empires people going through the portal, it reminded me of evo
I was really hoping that after everyone had left, chat would show “MumboJumbo has joined the server”
Mery Christmas grian
KEEP THESE VIDS UP !!!!!!!!!
The tree launches creepers via tnt cannon but a powerful one although idk how doc has that many charged creepers
Be better grain
There were wonderful weeks of the crossover. So fun to watch.  That Present/Prank for Pearl was awesome. So funny. Also, nice work roping Doc in, lol.  Feel better, Grian.
If he hated placing copper to age, he could always build pix's copper ager
I shed a tear when pixlrifs left
Good crossover but kinda anti climatic
Grian: *sick voices* Me: "Mumbo Jumbo are you AFK?""
Grum-sno bot…
at exactly 13:02 if you pause and turn playback speed to 0.25 you can see the charged creeper come out of the tree
I feel bad
That snowman is incredibly sus 🤣🙃
Everyone but pix took of there gear. Pix totally getting back.
Get better
That actually hurt, seeing them leave.
lol and i knew itd be pearl
why is pearl so much like my gf whenever she sees one of the abominations i've made
The reindeer kinda look like capybaras and I love them
How is mumbo going to react when he realizes an entire crossover happened
Who else wants the rift to always be open so the members of each server can go to and from each server?
Oh that lag was PAINFUL
Eat your cereal
That creeper tree is a freaking railgun
Hope you get better grian
that was a fitting end for the Recap-ception: being able to at least mention Zloy and Lyarrah before Pix leaves..
Noooooo I just read the title
Me: thinks grian is going to ask doc how the use the creeper shooter.  Grian: we’re going to slightly annoy doc until he retaliates.  Me: yup thats Grian
THAT prank was BRILLIANT!
I love how instead of asking Doc to show him how to use the machine, he decided to tick him off instead (which may not have even worked).
I was half expecting him to say Happy Christmas
I love how doc fell right into grians plan EXACTLY LMAO 😭
Out of curiosity, was the 1-block-wide portal done in creative/using cheats, using a datapack, or did docm77 create an update suppressor to shrink it to a 1x1?
The way the video quality dropped due to the thousands of items all over the ground was the funniest kind of environmental storytelling
I'm so sad the crossover is over now 😭
Finallllyyyy
I love the idea that pixel canonically keeps updates on the hermits and finds a way through the portal every week to see what's changed
Would’ve loved to see if both rifts stayed open and there was regular “lore-travel” between servers
I wish the empires would stay on the hermitcraft
I knew grian would stick with pearl i made that comment last episode lol if he was gonna swap the secret santa he wouldnt have told us he would
Imagine if Pearl opens it on the wrong side
Yeah get well soon grian. There are so many of us in the UK with this sickness 🤣
I am sad that this crossover is over.  It was great time.  Thank you for this amazing content and I look forwards to all the future projects.
Man that’s a housewife’s worst dream
Hi Grian! Just wanted to say I got your hoodie last night as a Christmas gift from my mom, and I love it!! The little tiny Grian bread on the bottom on the hoodie is adorable. Cannot wait to wear it soon when it gets cold! 💜  Gonna watch this episode as I am traveling now. Can’t wait to see what you do for the secret santa gift. I bet it’ll be great 😂
Grian: shoots a crossbow near a dragon *2 seconds later* Docm77: What are you doing!?
This is what all Grian wants for Christmas. I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree I just want Mumbo for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is Mumbo! Mumbo Jumbo!
half a stack of content
so sad this crossover has come to an end, its been so much fun!!
grats on almost 8mil subs
It felt like the hermits were on the empires serve for longer period, y is it ending so quickly?
Since we didn’t see FWhip go through I can just imagine that there’s gonna be that home alone scene where the Empires people are like, “KEVIN!” But with FWhip
I'm sick too Grian!
I'm also getting Evo vibes all over again XD
Imagine if hermitcraft did more crossovers with other servers like lifesteal. That would be CHAOS.
Did hermitcraft pull a Marvel with the out of nowhere multiverse and time travel thing
It would be fun if pixlrift join hermit craft next season
This is a creative comment. Beleve
That snowman has eyes that remind me of Family Guy.  Hope you feel better soon Grian!  (Also "We didn't have a war!"... Just a light fortified skirmish...)
David Copperfield strikes back
Yeah- we all ended up getting the flu.. XD
I think it's good that Grian's not letting it still be the Emptity
Grian you NEED to ask doc to launch you from the suspicious creeper tree
Amazing video!
Dude your voice 😍
Grian: - See's present - Me: - knows that it is Scotts present for Joel - Grian: "Ohhh this must be MY  secret Santa!" Me: - Screaming in protest - (Something died in me)  I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry.
13:01 this is seriously one of the funniest moments of the season for me LOL
the exit of pixelriffs, made me rolling 😂😂😂
Finally, I can start watching Hermitcraft again.
Pixelriff’s way of leaving was the greatest thing iv ever seen. 😂
Grian is like the child trying to destroy a valuable object and doc is the parent trying to stop him
Snowman: everything is sus
...so this means I can tick "Watcher Reference" off the bingo card, right?
That Pixlriffs bit was so hilarious I had to go back and rewatch it.
Doc asking “are you bored again” is endlessly funny XD 12:33
27:30 ish felt incredibly similar to evo when they were going to a new update something something how the night changes haha
Grians entity is now emptity 😀
22:54  oh good grian's finally hitting puberty
What time is prank becaus i know the present is a time
I love the fact that when Grian needed a charged creeper, instead of just, I don’t know, _asking for one,_ he decided to piss Doc off until he got shot with one
Love your vids!
“ Hopefully by the time we got all of this set up it will all make no sense to anybody” Grian 2022
I also sick
The ending was rather abrupt.  Hopefully one of the hermits who were at that party has a video with more information.  I liked the cross overs but there was no sense of closure for either side. 😕
Grian pretends to shoot the dragon and Doc's response is: "Are you bored again?" lol
the voice lol
Grian NOOOOO THAT WAS FOR JOEL FROM SCOTT!!!! 1:40
Such a cool concept. Two amazing servers joining together
I'd love to see Pixlriffs or any of the Empires guys/gals join HC for a full season.
Played doc like a fiddle
Who else noticed that pixlriffs made a netherite hoe 😂
You mean its not the empty-ty?
‘Didnt start a war’  *the blown up grumbot at Empires*  . . . . R u sure bout that? 😂
take care grain (yeah grain)
15:53 lowkey sounds like a ghast
I love how this send off is so nice when their arrival here was so chaotic lol
Grian should make Pixlrif's copper ager machine for the E.N.T.I.T.Y stock. I mean, you already made a wood farm and have fallen in love with it. Love, Canary.
The glitch with the chest (at 0:39) is one I’ve had too! I believe it’s when you get out of range of the chest while you’ve still got it open. It closes the menu, but the chest remains open. (I noticed this because I have a chest that’s most easily reached on a ladder, and when I fall off the ladder, the chest stays open even though it’s kicked me out).
I won’t lie. Sick Grian is way funnier than not sick Grian.
tbh i kinda want the empire crew to stay on the hermitcraft server, along with the hermit crew in the empires server, i think both would be kind additions in both servers
End of the episode Grian sounds like teenager with a bad microphone.
Who ever commented last time that Grian still had Pearl, kudos to you.
0:00 First
go up docs flag pole using the elevator at the bottom, there will be a suprise
I love that doc immediately just says "Were you bored again?" That clearly shows just how often Grian does stupid stuff like this.
21:41 an honest to god NEEEURHHH
Two servers and no war? Missed opportunity.
Noo I don't want Pix to be going
Merry Christmas everyone!  Also, great episode as always grian, keep on the good work!
SOUNDS LIKE GRIAN WANTA TO CRASH THE SERVER LOL
Get well soon!
PIX STARTING AND ENDIMG THE CROSSOVER WITH THE RECAP IS AMAZING
wow
I just came back from school, I’ll be watching this while changing and I’m sad now that it’s ending, yes the rift was closing but I kinda wanted it to go on a little bit more longer.
If grian's base is powered by the rift... would dwane collapse and fall when the portal closes?
Grian tittle “hermetcraft: episode 32” he forgot the 9
Now imagine evo some how coming through the lil sliver of rift.
Those Empire portal outtakes were hilarious.
Get well soon
0:27 I knew it!!
PixlRiffs leaving was the best lmao
Scar has a great moving method; dump everything onto the ground, walk into it and hold down Shift+Q to rapidly pick up and chuck everything forward slightly. Proceed with sweeping the items into a pile and shuffle them all toward their new destination.
I feel like eating glass when I hear, sausages, voice, and putting sand in my ears
Grians dying voice is so cute lol
Feel better soon, and Marry Christmas =)
Why is there a sheep in the redstone?
Man Pearl was having some incredibly Weird Dreams
Grian, if U put a block in front of a explosive, it will do barely any damage just like the end crystals in season 8!
the end made me tear up, this has been such a super fun event. i had soooo much fun watching the crossover from every perspective. thanks to everyone for all their hard work putting it together! also your secret santa gift for pearl was inspirational, even tho you fell for the panic yourself :)
The crossover has been really fun to watch. I love watching Hermitcraft and Empires. I sure hope this happens again some other time. Merry Christmas and a happy new year.
Grian, you’ve made ONE TREE FARM and your now the new mumbo jumbo! 🤣
Hope you feel better soon Grian, dont push yourself too much!
Grian says he failed the secret santa prank but he surely succeeded because he managed to create CONTENT
Hope you feel a bit better before christmas G
Get better soon grian! and happy holidays! Gonna miss those empires a lot tbh
I KNEW IT! THE CLASSIC DOUBLE PEARL ROUSE
I've got your sweater for Christmas!! And a cold too, to match!!   Hope you get better soon and enjoy the holidays!! Thank you for so much amazing content and lore ♡♡♡♡
Oh
"This week on hermitcraf, NOT pixleriffs"
Yes
Great episode mate. I love the concept behind the Pearl's present, it's gonna be fun to watch :)
Those who have seen Joel's latest video would have known that you got pearl.
I throughly enjoyed the Empires crossover but I didn't want them to go...
I really wish the crossover wasn't over 😭 thank you for the fun times!
There may nit have been a war, but there certainly was a good attempt at getting one
\*Grian closes the portal\*  Oli: Oh no it's gone! \*snickers\*
ah ;) the old "I gift you my messy room mom, so you enjoy cleaning it".
16:21 I think it has a mechanic similar to your present, but with a backlog of a bunch of charged creepers. Then it hits them with a slow falling potion, and launches them with a TNT cannon?
That was a lot of fun. Thank you, Grian, for helping to organize a really cool and fun crossover that introduced new people to each other and new viewers to new creators. I, for one, really enjoyed every episode and, though I'm sad it's ending, I'm over the moon that it's happened in the first place. The servers will now feel very quiet but I'm sure you'll all know just how to busy yourselves after the holidays. I hope you feel better very, very soon and I wish everyone a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year!
Lizzie is a cat she's wearing a human mask
*CLEAN*
Pearl is the human embodiement of the 🥺 emoji
This episode was amazing, definitely one of my favorites. Merry christmas and I hope you get better soon Grian
Not Grian quoting Eminem
Man the empires folk were super annoying, they didnt respect shops or anything, literally ruinin the ”lag meme” by pocketing both diamond profits and items.
Hearing ur hoarse voice is giving me srs flashbacks to season one! 🤣   Anyway, hope u get to feeling better real soon!
Really enjoyed the crossover ❤️
Episode 2 without no content creator 😢
David [Pixs, copper aging machine] was built again on the server under Xisumas base. You could see about using it for aging copper for your shop
"Wut" "decorations"
Grain? Why don’t you post your among us videos anymore? Most of the other hermits do, but I want to watch your point of view because it is the most exciting
I wish Pixl could stay as a hermit
If i had a nickel for every time Grian thought he had a secret santa give when it wasnt, I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but its weird that it happened twice.
Likely too late, but if you don't remove that concrete block right next to the slime block, it won't be able to bounce the creeper up.
Grian honestly you are more talented than both doc and ilmango as neither of them critical strike mobs but you do!
Yeah this is the first time you've actually sounded ill
GRIAN THAT WAS JOELS PRESENT
I feel it would’ve been cool if the rift stayed open and they could travel between servers, or if one of the empires memebers is stuck on hermitcraft.
grian isnt grumbot from season 6? like you made a bot that looks like mumbo just like now...
I made a redstone computer with only redstone, repeaters, and pistons once, would you call this a "grian computer"
when does mumbo return
Hope you feel better soon 😊😊😊
Someone in the comments of the last video called it; I vividly remember some top comment called out Grian getting Pearl again...    Wow. Whoever they are, they have a third, all seeing eye.
The way how the Empires crew leave the server reminds me a lot of how the EVO Smp would change updates.
23:14 24:12
So very sad to see the crossover end! I was hoping it would continue to the end of the season, with just going back and forth, friends calling upon the other server to help with something, defeat another king, or stop grumble from taking over the multiverse, or something else :-D
When Grian started placing the stairs up to the portal I was FREAKING OUT with Evo flackbacks. “Time doesn’t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme”, yes Grian, it does.
Imagine if pixel riffs actually came back next week like “Hi guys!
i am sick too Grian, we can sound like we swallowed cheesegraters together haha
No war! Yeah!!!
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA GET PEARL AGAIN!!!!!!!!!
grian what did you expect when you blew up multiple full chests of stuff
How about Tango was still at Empire SMP? Did he returned to Hermitcraft?
I’m also terribly sick right now haha, cheers to you Grian I hope you get a good rest this holiday season
I have so much sympathy for Pearl and I cannot tell you how badly I've wanted to to fix Grian's chest monsters.
24:26 THERE'S A BOOK IN THE SHULKER    It's an I.O.U from False
awesome episode grian, have a happy, merry christmas and get well soon
Crossover was the best crossover I've ever seen. Loved the lore behind it, the interactions, and everything else.
🦆
I loved the crossover!
“moon big” has turned into “portal smol”
"DecOrAtiOns!" LOL
Get better soon! I can’t wait for the medieval part of your build.
I’ve loved this series. My only complaint is it was too short, hopefully someday there will be more cross-server collabs. This would be great for Decked Out launch and also the Hermit TCG.
Grain I had a dream where I played Minecraft with you best dream ever😊
I hope you feel better soon grian! Have a wonderful Christmas
Is the rift going to open up back to how it was before?
I'm kinda sad that the Colab on the hermitcraft side was so much shorter. Kinda deamt up that in the future there will be the Hermitpire server (a permanent Colab)
Wow, we've joked a bit that Rift Small was the new Moon Big, but I didn't expect both things to end up ending on the same day, exactly one year apart! This crossover has been so so so so amazing, thank you and all the others for making it happen! I hope you feel better soon, and Merry Christmas!
16:37 I’m willing to bet Doc is now going to flood Grian’s base with creepers.
I feel like the crossover was there just so they didn't have to do another  3rd life.
I love cleaning stuff up and sorting chests, I’m with you pearl! :D
Soooo ...... I has a sneaky suspicion that the rift will open again.... Last life season 4 ?....
28:55 im just cincerned for  whoever said "i like war" niw dont get me wrong i agree
Doc saying "are you bored again" implies this is NOT the first time this has happened
Wow... No one stayed, to be honest I'm a little shocked.
Pix’s “I’ll see you next week,” really got me cracking. 😂
Merry Christmas grain
Is it just me or does when the empire’s side was leaving into the rift remind me of Evo?
Wait how did you get it that small? Like outside of lore how did you do that?
ohh well. hope you get better til sunday. enjoy the time off. merry christmas, G. :)
Don't be sick for Christmas!! That would be soo sad! Gat well soon! Merry Christmas!
Nooo , Pixlriffs leaving made me emotional.  Take him back!
I wonder if someone from the Empires serves was "forgotten" or went hiding
mumbo is not online cause the rift kicked him out of the server /j
what is this, a crossover episode?
Get well soon Grian, and happy holidays ❤
Nice try Grian, but in your previous video, you moved your mouse over the secret santa card, and I saw that it was Pearl's name. Lucky for you, I was willing to keep my mouth shut 😉
Pet Dragons and Charged Creepers... standard day for Doc tbh
Wow the Secret Santa decorations at Grians base are beautiful 😍
I have to admit, that I shed a tear on the leaving of the Empires Folk!  That cross over was so uplifting, so refreshing! And I already said so on twitter, and I'll repeat it here: It would be just great if the Hermits could visits the Empires sometimes, and vice versa. Just to make the both SMPs feel more lively. No big bases for the visitores, well, uhm, besides the Hermitopia on the empires server, but visiting, interacting, and providing to the economy like tourists... or visiting friends. Nothing as big as the, just ended, collab, but sometimes, having a good time together.
b-but lore :(
Decorations! 😆
Aww man the empires folks only just got there and they are already leaving! I hope you guys do this again next season! Absolutely fantastic content!
Grian you fooled no one, you're predicteble
“Are you bored…. again?”
🤣 😂 🤣 😂  I’m so sorry that your sick Grian, it’s no fun especially since you need your voice for your videos, but SickVoiceGrian without the high tones is hilarious and I was busting a gut Thank you for that
I hoped for everyone to join HC but I was left with a melancholic bitterness on my tongue and a scar (pun not intended) on my heart. :')
❗URGENT❗  your the best YouTube ever😍 we love you!!💖💜💚💛🧡❤💙 Thank you for posting Everyday and Making us Smile😁🙌 We appreciate you sooooo much😄
That was Joel’s secret Santa
Sick Grian sounds like a teenager lol
Pix’s exit will be one of my favorite moments ever. This crossover event was fantastic, and I love it. I hope more events like this could come in the future. This was truly a treat. Thank you, Grian, and the Hermits and Empires gang. Y’all have made something special here.
Grian 🎉🎉🎉🎉
whAt?!
Grian, I hope that you feel better real soon.
You know if that was actually grian's present, I would say that's the most relatable Christmas ever.  You give something like extremely insane like a Lego set and you get slippers.
This was such a lovely episode! A great addition to my snow day!
Is the rift small?
“We didn’t have a war!”  Scar: NOT ON MY WATCH!
Omg Doc's immediately going to 'are you bored again?' 😂
I forgot about mumbo's vault. Where is it, mumbo?
I was DYING when Grian took Joel’s coal present, now all that scavenger hunt was for nothing
I've loved this crossover so much! Thank you for giving g us this experience and merry Christmas! This episode was all around amazing!
Pixlriffs has kept the crossover alive because of the one joke
Honestly I was hoping pix would stay on hermitcraft indefinitely, but that exit was honestly worth it
Install Inventory Essentials on your client, then click and drag. It's literally the best mod ever.
The actual fear in Doc's voice had me in fits XDDDD
You don’t sound sick, you sound very, VERY dehydrated
to be honest grian whoever did joel's gift should've puta  on sign on it saying who it was for
And next time, war with the Dream SMP!
Am I the only one who thinks the title of this episode sounds too happy and hyped about a sad ending. Like, does any hermit fan and follower actually want to see the Empires peeps go away?
I think I prefer this sick Grian's voice 🤣.  Still, get better soon!
I hope pixelrifs gets on the next season of hermitcraft
Hey Grian do you know if Mubo will be back any time soon?
Maybe if empires Grumbot didn’t get destroyed the rift would have stayed open longer? Hmmmm.
Grian, I’ve been doing homework for about an hour, I take a lil breaks THEN I SEE THIS AND NOW I PVE LOST TRACK OF TIME
Why am I crying 😅
This was a short lived cross over
Green please don't say poke the goat
Minecraft’s greatest crossover ever. Tysm Grian!
YOU FORGOT THE NAME TAG
"I like war"  GoodTimesWithScar
Grian sound like when he sang Mumbo AFK
The fact that you got bamboozled twice by the gifts was amazing.  But that ending almost made me cry. I'm gonna miss them so much. That joke from pix was top tier.
"Are you bored again??" 💀💀💀
Where is among us video impulse posted that u were in?
Merry Christmas, Grian! Feel better! Thank you for setting up the most ambitious crossover event in cinematic history and giving it a nice end even while you were mildly dying. This was so cool, and I really enjoyed meeting the Empires peeps
E
It’s the Sussy Snowman
I called it! I literally called it and commented it was gonna be Pearl still!
Get well soon Grian!!
Merry Christmas Grian!
Merry Christmas Grian! Have a great time with friends and family, you a deserve a big break :)
Everytime Grian plays with charged creepers I have a panic attack
Anyone else noticed the title says hermitcraft instead of hermitcraft 9 (LORE???)
This was uploaded 3h ago. Lol. I’m so glad I have grain 🍞on notifications 🤪.
Have a wonderfull Merry Christmas Grain and I hope you get better! :D
Did anyone else start having audio problems at about 5:40 ?? Or is it just me?
I freaking called in it the last video.. 1x1 block Knew it
If it's any consolation I am sick with RVS which something that children usually get so I'm going to be ill on Christmas too
I love how in the back of my head, I knew you would do this... Non-switcheroo? I guess?
"You don't need to find out you don't want to find out" oh god, if I thought of that, I knew the dragon was a boss so I would have hit it knowing it      has lots of health something tells me it will be free and kill everyone in sight, we would have to retreat through the rift
grian. great video. i want to tell  you. i had to babysit today. i showed her your videos. i don't think she liked them. but i like your videos.
Get well soon Grian! And happy holidays <3
😢😔
Right before the rift closes mumbo comes back right right
Merry Christmas to you and your family
the stairs up to the rift bring back memories
My os the next video hermitcraft 5 BUMBOOO
The part when Grain started singing Lose Yourself by Eminem was a my fav. One shot, one opportunity
I won't be surprised if we continue to see Sausage on Hermitcraft Season Nine occasionally.
Grian pokes Doc for a charged creeper... Did neighbors stop asking for sugar?  Edit: I feel like the Crossover is over but the collabs are not.
Hope you feel better grian, because I have been sick some weeks ago I know it feels. Have a Merry Christmas and a happy new year.
The fact that I also just orginize minecraft chests also makes me fell less weird xD
I have truly enjoyed the crossover you all have done together. Merry Christmas bro and a Happy New Year to you and your loved ones.
A true Hermit, making videos even when sick. 😊
merry sickmass grian!
The chest thing at the beggining is a mp glitch if two people r using a chest and one leaves before the other sometimes it'll close the chest and then it's in a constant loop of being wrong
18:20 Oh that's some _chunky_ salsa right there. Better hope Pearl was able to _lAaAaAaAg_ your items into your shulkers in time!
Grian building that staircase to the portal gave me some serious deja vu
This was the absolute best thing to happen to MC in a long time.
Nooooooooooooooooo 0:04 !
At the end, grian, you said hermitcraft and empires didn't have a wat. True that it wasn't a full on war but you did have a battle against them when leaving to go back to hc9.
Grian:The situation is dire Grian: takes time to make a nice-looking staircase
Called it go back and check
Is netherite banned on hermitcraft? If not why are you in diamond armour?
3 days.
yo grian but don't you need to name the creeper for it not to dispawn :P
Grian taking Scott's present/prank for Joel honestly is Scott's own fault for putting it INSIDE GRIAN'S BASE, and not putting up a message saying who it was for/who it was from.
sausige had some pure pain when he fell
Grian saying decorations like that made me laugh and since im sick I also made weird noises that barely represent a laugh
i was really hoping on seeing *Mumbo Jumbo joined the game after grian does hes outro
I don't follow many Minecrafters on YouTube here, Grian & Mumbo being about the only two, but man Pix has been enjoyable. I might just have to go subscribe to him to.
I want some bets on what this season's war is gonna be.
i hope pixelrifts joins hermitcraft although he's fun on empires and is nessisary to spice up the server As he has no personal lore, and also knows so much about hermitcraft, he just fit well with the hermit's  But i also feel like theres gonna be a lot more hermits next season, due to hermits basically having a trial run with a bunch of new youtubers (It wouldn't be this season due to lore)  Also probably more empirers people in empires 3, although i assume theres a limit for that smp due to lore, so not too many new (It will get too complicated if there was 24 empires or something)
Merry Christmas Grian  and hope yo get better
The big crossover event ending on the anniversary of Moon Big is making me emotional   This was incredible, many many thanks for dreaming this up & getting everyone on the same page to make it happen! This crossover was really something special ❤️
Wow, wow, and again, wow. Kinda sad to see the crossover end, but what a fab couple of months of chaos and delight it has been. Loved it and thank you to you, the Hermits and the Empires gang for joining together for this. I was actually quite sad to see them leave. As for Pearl's prank, hooo boy I'm just as glad you stuck around to help her because I was stressing seeing that ball-pit of blocks all around too fearing just how much of it was going to despawn. I hope you feel better in time for Christmas day. Wishing you and your loved ones all the best and here's hoping that 2023 will be a better year. ❤
One shot one opertunity to get everything you ever wanted one moment would you capture it or just let it slip
This was the best video
Man, The crossover was so much fun!! It's amazing that we even got it so, yeah :D Also, did Fwhip leave early too?
For once the redstone worked flawlessly.  But somehow the prank still went horribly wrong.
GRIAN THAT WAS JOELS PRESENT
I also love to live out of my suitcase on holidays, drives my partner crazy, he likes to empty everything neatly into drawers :')
Of course you got coal. You stole someone else's present.
Session 10 hermitcraft vs empires mega server?!?! Please 😊
grian building those stairs to the portal is so nostalgic
Merry Christmas Grian!!!!
I KNEW IT! i told him to chose pear again and he did Or i just guessed what he was gona do 🤷‍♂️
"Ive just seen my real SECRET SANTA...... ᵈᵉᶜᵒʳᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿˢ" 24:07
Nooooooooooooooooo. I want them to stay!!!
Hey Grian, merry christmas. And all the others who's watching. And also a happy new year.
Doc saying are u bord agen is the same sort of way a parent wood speek to a tobler lol
The crossover was very cool. BUt its also nice it ended
You know that makes it twice that Grian has outsmarted the Doc in someway, season 7 with the death box and this. One more Time and we can officially call Grian Docs Nemesis.
Grian, would you like for me to fully break down how the creeper cannon works?
Plot twist: as soon as everyone logs out Mumbo pops out of the portal
I'm honestly glad the crossover is over. I'm ready for the server to be normal again.
mumbo is in the snowman.
If Hermitcraft entered nuclear warfare, then I'd want to be on whatever side Doc is on
The PURE JOY i felt when hearing the terror in pearl and docs voices 🤣🤣🤣
Already? They just got there 2 episodes ago
Ok
Grumbot...
I swear the WHOLE OF ENGLAND has a coldy flu-ish thing it’s so sad 🥲😷😷
If there were an achievement for getting every obtainable item, Grian would have it and not even realize it.
So Grians present is like Homer's bowling ball, hmm
It was a very cool crossover :) thank you
I haven’t watched the whole episode yet but the green present with the coal/gold in was for Joel, Scott made a treasure hunt and that was the end prize. I wanted to write this before I forgot so if Grian finds out it was Joel then please ignore this comment.
Big sad
It wouldve been cool for mumbo to come out of the portal after all of them left.
merry christmas grian
Pixx's outro actually made me tear up a bit. I'm going to miss some of the crossover, but I'm looking forward to the Hermits getting back to Hermit things. Maybe being more available for each other and returning to their own projects. AND ALSO getting to play Beef's card game! HE'S SO SO CLOSE TO FINISHING IT!
hah! played Doc like a piano.
Oh my heart😢 im gonna miss this historical moment 😂
This actually almost made me cry. I enjoyed that crossover a lot I guess. It was more than just that crossover too, since it was also allowing entry to the Hermitcraft Recap crew, sort of. Thank you all for this. And I'm guessing you especially, since you probably were at the center of this amazing idea.
Doc's flag - dragon for scale
I panicked when I saw scar go in lol. Glad he’s not switching
merry christmas everyone 🎄🎆
did'nt he forget to nametag the creeper?
Grins has a cold?
Haha😂Doc fell right for the bait
Doc saying, "Dude! Are you bored again?" is so funny
the emptity
Omg he’s voice when he said WHAT while being sick xD
Why go through the rift when you can just log off and connect to Empires manually? Or is that just too much work and you need a shortcut?
I hope you get better Grian! Your voice sounds hilarious when you tried to go high haha! Also I loved watching Docm77 just GO for you, that was amazing. Also you yelling clean at Pearl was amazing.
I was so sad when i saw the title
I knew it Grian got Pearl again
Before it even happens I'm calling that the creeper kills Pearl A lectern is not as blast resistant as stone Edit: well I've been wrong before
15:28 Moms Spaghetti
Did anyone realize grian when he got the charged creeper in the present he kinda quoted eminem?
when everyone was saying bye, they all sounded like the teletubbies
Sad goodbyes. Grian voice makes it more sad.
I hope you are better soon Grian, I don't really know how to say that in english but get well soon❤
Awesome video  Hopefully you're all better  Is it weird that i like your sick voice too?
I sure hope Tango made it back to the HermitCraft server before the rift closed. If not, at least gem and sausage should be able to help him back.
Grain with the grainy teenager voice
i really think that the grum bot on the empires server is gonna open the portal and meet the grum bot on the hermitcraft server
did anyone see the grian egg on jimmy's head at 25:06 and 25:58? what a throwback to the start of the season!! lmao!
So, Grian, you say this present/prank makes no sense, but in the context of it being you, this makes perfect sense. I would be more confused if you did something not so chaotic.
That was not a failure. Pearl's shellshocked reaction was glorious.
Its a shame how lackluster this part of the crossover felt. There really wasnt enough time for anything to really happen
Thank god 🙄
Merry Christmas!
“Might be a good idea to let it know that it’s closing” says the man who tried to keep the hermits from leaving
Now, this crossover is over, there is maybe space for other members for example a well moustached guy. Hopefully.
Pixelriffs exit was fantastic 🤣
I don't want it to be over.
Hope u feel better
0:26 I knew it!!
"I saw 1 frame of a creeper" no grian if you check the footage it was actually 2 frames. I am not kidding I checked
I think funniest part was when ~~J~~ Timmy and Sausage failed to go through portal.  Merry christmas Grian and everyone reading this comment and I hope you ge tyour voice back and feel better soon
My favorite part was literally when he quoted eminem
I hope you get better soon Grian!
@Grian That present was for Joel!!!
Hope you get better grian!! Being sick on christmas is never nice
It would be so fun if this was an annual thing! Empires Season 3 x Hermitcraft Season 10?
i saw it was pearl in beans' video
That was prefect
if the rift was closed and then u needed a hero to open it it would be better bcs u could have bring mumbo with that story if he was willing to come back
Annoying doc so that he would launch the creepers at grian worked surprinsingly well, that was so funny 🤣
Protip: Cut a deal with X to use David C. V
If it wasnt because of pixlriffs making a reference to hermitcraft recap I would of been sobbing by now
Just to say if you slowed last vid significantly you could see grain hover over pearls name after he said he rerolled
poor pearl 😂
Man I wish mumbo would've logged on just to ask Jimmy for a spy glass.
For you to remember  the lectern can block all explosion damage 🤗
What a nice present and base decorations
Feel better, Grian! (Being sick is the worst. I can attest to that, as I am also sick. Solidarity, bro) Alway love to see your videos and the shenanigans that follow. Merry Christmas!
Why do I feel like dream SMP is next and there's gonna be a canonical war?
I think its more of a suspicious snowman
Enjoy your Christmas and break, get better soon and well wishes!
maybe you should change your store name to the emptyty
Get well soon
I love how Joel and Scott just left
Get well soon!
shubble
The chest glitch where it's always screaming as I called it, it's actually quite common. I've seen it trigger if you open and close a chest a few too many time in quick succession. Yes other players can see the screaming chest to.
Grain all u made is a lag machine
that trap would've made mumbo proud, and also a bit frustrated.
Ok but pixlerifts exit was the best it could have possibly been.
Feel better Grian! Thanks for the amazing content and Merry Christmas!
My favorite YouTuber is groan.
Hope you feel better 💜I've also been sick the last couple of weeks so hope yours isn't as bad as mine was.
Pix was the only one I was like nooooooo don't go
hi :)
The creeper wasn’t going to get in the minecart because the minecart was on a rail and mobs won’t path find over rail, you would have had to push it
DOC IMMEDIATELY USED THE CREEPER CANNON 😭😭😭 LOLOL
i already knew you got pearl again, so i went and already told her
I’m 2h late but I swear this episode is pure gold
"A present? This must be mine!" Joel:
The Emptity
I hope the rift opens back up for a minigame stream
No charged creeper was harmed in the making of this video
here have a present -> 🍟
Aw, I was really hoping it would close before Pix got through.
Stubble saying goodbye is great… wish she had uploaded a video from the hermit craft server
The crossover was so fun!!! :D
bro ur helth is nothing compared to mine
Feel better soon!
wining a mind game with doc... impressive !!!
24:11 "Decorations!"
I think pixelriff would be a good addition to Hermitcraft
Thanks for the interesting video.
get well soon
I had a feeling Grian would open Joels present
Oh nooo. The fake ass portal is fake closing... Oh noo.
Scar: "I like war." *tries to go start a war*  The Hermits: "SCAR NO!"  Us: Scar yes.
Is it only me who’s happy that this crossover ended ??
Wait did Tango ever come back through…
Best shop on the server: the EMPTY-ty!
loved the prank and the crossover event.. also get well soon
Sorry, Grian. Feel better soon. I'm recovering from COVID, and it is not fun!
I was genuinely hoping that during the Goodbye Empires Server chat after the fact that Mumbo would just spawn in front of The Rift and ask what he missed before hard cut ending the video,
this whole crossover was a big christmas present for me, tbh. LOVED EVERY SINCE BIT OF IT!! (ps: get well soon, Grian!!)
Nooo not joels present🤣😭
Wait, what abt fWhip?
i am so glad i was here when all of this crossover happened, and i hope the future viewers will think that this was the greatest thing E V E R .
Pearl after opening Grian's present: "Once the items all despawn, the area will be clean!"
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...  This thing was so fun. Loved the Empire guys.
I love the random patches of skulk
E
this was amazing. My girlfiend is super fan of empires, me a hermitcrafter. We loved it all. Thanks, guys!
Everyone is sick even grain!
Mumbo jumbo will finally come back and be like...what did i miss?
Take care of yourself, Grian, we would rather you take a break and feel better than try to push on just for us. This was a great Christmas gift and we'll see you in the new year!
can't wait for the end of sunday's ReCap episode... on the 25th lol
I know this is probably never going to happen but what if Hermitcraft and The Dream SMP had a collab since the dream smp is now in season 2 so it would be cool to see a colab
im sorry but i love how Docs first few words when he sees grian is "dude. are you bored AGAIN?" like it has happened multiple times before lollll
23:14 Oh my goodness your little squeak and the laugh afterwords is the cutest thing I've ever heard! I hope you feel better soon!
Watching this video before Pearl video is out is annoying
What about Fwip
“Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened!” -Dr Seuss     This crossover has gone on for nearly 2 months and it has gotten me through a bunch, with school struggles, hospital visits and surgerys. I’m so glad my 2 favorite SMPs got to collide and everyone could do their own thing with different people. And also, we have S4 of the Life Series! So the crossover isn’t over!
*Grian being annoying*  Doc: “Are you bored again?!”
Merry Christmas grian
FWHIP DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE RIFT. IS IT TOO LATE? But like slay we have a new person on the server if it is.
It was So Much Fun and it's a shame they couldn't stay a Little longer,😔😔The Crossover episodes have been full of laughter.. Merry Christmas Grian 🤧😏☃️🌟.
I would like to point out that the charged creeper Doc shot at Grian's base was on screen for only 2 frames, that thing was going FAST
Hiya Grian! 1st I hope you are well soon! 2nd Have a Merry Christmas with your family! 3rd I'm thankful that you had a good time with the crossover! Nope, I'm not going to continue counting because the gift of you, and the Hermits are innumerable! You've all created a community full of a type of joyful charity that is rare. May it be more contagious then anything. Thank you!!! <3 ~respect
it's gonna reopen to another server hopefully one with create added to it cause i want to see what ya do with create grian. if this happens EVERY hermit goes and when you come back create will be added to hermitcraft i REALLY want this to happen also make trains with create grian that is something ya are gonna do.
he didnt even wait for other empires members to join and just closed it, just like how he reopened the rift without notifying the other hermits.
Same I do the same thing with a suitcase
Get better soon Grian!
trick of the trick
Hopefully the empires crew come back for Decked out :)
Im a tad sad that the empires crew in hermitcraft felt so short or lack luster compared to the hermit's on the empires server. Overall though i still loved it!
The name should be changed to Prank AND Present lol
it hurt watching you ruin scotts secret santa for joel.
It's aight grian I'm sick too
Grian! That present was for Joel, From Scott. he sent him on a scavenger hunt... Well ether way I hope you have a merry Christmas.
I feel you brother
I knew hed have pearl again!
Merry Christmas Grian 🎉
The rice cooker song interrupting the rhythm
you succesfull prank yourself and create 100 times worser chest monster. Anyway merry christmas everyone!
That poor creeper launching from the tree.. looked like one of those astronauts in the centrifuge!  I've really enjoyed the crossover, really fun and I got some more people to follow now. Thanks for this amazing content! And merry Christmas!
Can't believe the crossover  is over. Hope you feel better soon!
Don’t creepers destroy some items in chests when they explode?
I had a feeling you were going to do Pearl anyways
December 22 2021: Hermits left Hermitcraft due to moon emergency December 22 2022: Empires left Hermitcraft due to rift emergency
yay
8 episode crossover Nice...
I KNEW IT I KNEW HE WOULD GET PEARL!!
I KNEW he would get Pearl again. It's so on brand of him.
Merry Christmas everybody!
ngl I always thought Mumbu would come through the rift
"My real secret santa-- ᵈᵉᶜᵒʳᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿˢ"
Don't know if it was on purpose but I loved the throw to evo SMP at the end when the empires were leaving. But either way another amazing episode, grian!
*@Grian* 17:25 Go talk to Xumavoid about copper!!! :D
What an absolutely insane crossover, definitely going down in history here. So proud of all the hard work you guys did to put this together and it was a blast seeing you all have so much fun <3
Your sick voice sounds so young
I feel you grian, I'm currently sick as of watching this
when they were leaving idk the time: only grian would make fancy stairs in a time like that
So, are we not gonna talk about the fact they either had to use commands for the one by one portal or an update supression machine like doc did in season 6 or 7 with Area whatever it was called?
It's finally over
those recap jokes will never get old tbh
OH NO GRIAN OPENED THE PRESENT MEANT FOR JOEL OH NOOOO
You could have just shot the boat with an arrow, no?
I hope there are future crossover between these two servers in the future. This last month of episodes has been great.
PASTA BAKE!
Everyone: yay lore    Me: when will grian bring back the ep. 17 timelapse song?   Please bring it back grian. Please return the vibe.  Edit: Song is mystery by asgr
What if we start calling Grian Redstone Gredstone?
No war, only one confrontation at riftless fort lmao
Grian, I have waited so long to say 1 thing....
If grian had a nickel for every time he was duped this episode, he'd have two nickles, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice
Grian gives the most generous/funniest gifts ever. I love it.
Scared Griam sounds like a cat
Was i only one who tought grian sounded a little like timmy 😂
What a bittersweet goodbye <3 Thanks for pulling this crossover out, it was fastastic.
I actually liked the crossover and honestly hope to see the empire members back on hermit craft again sometime
I'm the same way. When I go on vacation I don't put my stuff away. I just live out of my suitcase.
24:35 He sounds like he's been trough puberty again lmao
💀” decorations“💀
I hope you feel better soon Grian ❤❤❤❤. Merry Christmas 🎄🎁.
Give all the thanks to everyone who helped put this colab together. It was truly a treat to watch this play out in episodes and streams over the past weeks.
Pix always manages to be the highlight.
coal for joel which had raw gold (rhyme)
Did he name tag it? 🤔
Grian: We didnt have a war Meanwhile Grumbot: I shall Destroy this server
Makes us wonder if he will ever use the rift again
4:30 as pearl takes a look through here, a charged creeper will apeare - you really missed one here grian
I want too join hermitcraft but I need it’s up adress
This crossover has been so amazing and a joy to watch and I thank you for bringing this to us <3 <3 <3 Hope you get well and have a merry Christmas!!!!
Oh no Grian got sick just before Christmas get well soon
Love your videos Grian. hope you feel better soon!
Grian here is an idea you rent out the tree farm for a diamond every 10 mins
grian scolding a charged creeper for not following the plan is not something i knew i needed but it was absolutely hilarious thank you
As grian was building up to the portal I kept getting flashbacks to Evo portals
The snowman's not angry, their eyes are blushing!!!
Mumbo: hey grian, portal small?
love the vids
Grian loves pushing buttons. Sometimes wooden, sometimes stone, sometimes Doc`s.
The hermitswhen empires leave: byeeee Me: finally we got rid of those nerds
I knew grian would get pearl again lol
I hope they come back for third life
I watched Joel's secret santa making it, and I realised there was no signs, persumed they dmed you! I was screaming at my screen for you to stop mining 😂
I just remembered that when the season 6 world was made available to download, I basically did what Pearl's doing now: cleaned up Grian's chest monster!
The empires crew going through the rift at the end really reminded me of the evo smp when they travelled through the portals like this to new versions
It was fun while it lasted but all good things must come to an end. I absolutely loved this crossover, we got to see some cool interactions and fun shenanigans that otherwise would have probably never happened. The moment when Pix went “My name has been Pixlriffs, our writer as been Zloyxp, captions on this video were provided by Lyarrah” I laughed, but at the same time I started tearing up, this whole thing shouldn’t make me feel so many emotions and yet it does Thank you so much Grian, Fwhip, and everyone involved for the amazing fun this crossover was! <3
marry early cristmas grian
The snowman eyes just crack me up! 😂
Great video hope you feel better soon
"Are you bored again?" 😂
Does each Word represent a empires member?
You put a terra-cotta block next to the slime block under the obsidian...  I don't think the slime block can move now?
Here I expected a giant chest monster with 1 item per chest... the greatest of all chest monsters
The fact that grian's plan with doc actually worked is insane
The fact Grian got an IOU from false in the present yet didn't realize is super funny for me.
Last season: is the moon getting bigger? This season: is the portal getting smaller?
What does TOY  MICA JAM IS  NIFTY mean?
ITS NOT YOURS
it would have been fun if pix or some one from empires stayed.
Can there be a cross-server war next time? Because that would be awesome.
With the creeper shooter?? I believe that the cannon shoots 2 pieces of tnt, each lit mere 100ths of a second apart, one blows up shooting the creeper and other 2 tnt's away. Next the 2nd tnt blows up, this launches the remaining tnt and creeper up, why up? Because that tnt was slightly below the others, finally the last tnt blows up thus blowing the creeper to its final X pos.
the creeper thing uses a tnt cannon
Hi Grian :)  I have to admit, it's been a wonderful time with both crossovers, I'll be honest it's been almost too chaotic and stressful at times with so much activity among you all. But don't get me wrong, it's been like there's been 10 Grians on the server. lol. :) I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  :)
The emptity?
Everyone is saying how good the crossover was but i just want to know how he made that 1x1 portal
Grian: We had an interaction with an entire other server... and DIDN'T HAVE A WAR! Scar: I like war! *threatens to go through the portal*
One of my favourite lines “dude are you bored again?” Doc
Is the moon getting big?
This was a great crossover but I didn’t see fwip go through. Should we be worried 😧
Merry Christmas!!!🎄🎄🎄
Grian, what are you doing?!?! Are you bored again?!?!?   The fact this isn't a new thing for the hermits, grian truly is chaos incarnate
Watched this episode wearing my Grian sweater
I knew it was going to be Pearl again
Portal them onto TBT2
Ok, who else, whenever the use the rift, was reminded of the portals they used during the Evo series? I don’t know how many people even remember Evo…
Best. Gift. Ever.
It would be kind of funny if Perl just stands there & just watches ALL Grians items de-spawn... ;P  But it would suck for both Grian & all us viewers, as it would probably be a while until the next episode... :/
someone help me please i need to be grian baptized or something. literally haven't been subbed for 2 years and never noticed. :(
I don't know if it was intentional or not, but Pix looking directly at Grian as he says "I'll see you next week" was excellent
The end of this episode is the only time I’ve actually noticed a youtuber’s voice be different when they say it
Now two weeks for Pearl video lol 😂
I am sorry for being 1 hour late gentlemen 🗿🍷
"Am," not "are"
You have no idea how happy I am that Pixlriffs went through last. It was good having him on the server, I hope someday he can join it proper.
Hope you feel better soon!
Grian : 18:20 "its me, hi, im the problem its me" - taylor swift
Doc's response of "Are you bored again?" to Grian is a perfect example of what kind of people they both are lol. Viva La GOAT!
marry Christmas grian, I hope you feel better
You know Grian, you could have just asked Doc. He'd probably have just fired one off to show you how it worked. And you wouldn't have had to risk a world-destroying dragon escaping. Just sayin'.   :D :D
Get better soon!
sick grian voice reminded me of the beggining of season 6 lol
Both groups interact so well together. I can see Heritcraft and Empires becoming partnered. Let Empires be about RP while Hermitcraft is about the other aspect of Minecraft.
"dude, are you bored again?" is the summary of Grian's pranks lol
Bark
Loved the Crossover. Kinda reminded me of the Base-Swap. Just on a grander scale. I wonder what will be next. :D
i loved this crossover, it was really fun to watch!
Woo Empires guy are gone!  CRAB RAVE!!
Well I have to say I’m really going to miss the interactions and chaos that the Empires brought to the server but I can always go to Empires to watch the shenanigans there.
Amazing. I love this collab. One of my favorite things is seeing everyone get inspired by each other and just have a blast.
am i the only one who got major EVO vibes from the portal goodbyes even had the stairs and everything
watch dream come to the server
The fact Grian opened joels present.
Well the sicker you are the sicker your songs sound (mumbo jumbo you are afk)
grian you meanie! don't close the portal so fast
sobbing and crying /srs
When pearl blew up the present there was a literal shock wave of lag😂
This was such a fun and chaotic episode, feel better soon <3
I didn't expect the crossover to end so shortly after the emperors entered the Hermitcraft server.
Idk why but when Grian's voice broke i ended up laughing until the end of the video, it would have been even funnier if it broke again in the end of the crossover when everyone was there  Though i do hope he recovers quickly, being sick is never a good experience
name tag
It was funny I saw you comment on it with Joel and it made me think back the the moment I called you on doing that... Pearl is a good one to prank though.
The collab was great fun!
Grian- ʷʰᵃᵗ
I was like crying at the moment he opened that present that wasn't even for him...
I love the voice cracks :D Also I hope you'll get better, being ill on christmas suck tbh
Avengers: Endgame was not the most ambitious crossover, this is
I feel pearls pain….
I really thought 1 empires member "wouldn't make it through" and stayed
Why does Grian sound better to me?
Hermit craft season 9 lookin like hermitcraft season 6
man, the Emperors waving goodbye from the tiny portal hit harder than it should have.
Doc: "dude, are you bored again" 💀💀
Ya know, it was definitely fun while it lasted. I gotta say ill miss the extra sprinkle of christmas chaos but i know that with both empires and hermitcraft that it wont make any of them falter. I hope you get well soon Grian, happy holidays
Grain tasked himself to give Pearl a gift that is basically a gift for him and not Pearl
I don't know if this is already discovered  but the canaster beside the present in the cave looks like a ghost with a cap on its head.
This might be my favourite hermit craft episode. From the wrong gift with Joel, To seeing doc flying right for Grians shenanigans, and just… rending Pearl’s poor heart with that mess
Joe is your Secret Santa!
Hempires :D
You didn't put back the redstone that you broke 15:30
Grian does the most specific detailed things that just gives him the same result as a simple solution and I’m all for it
"we didn't have a war" Emperor Grumbot: ...
I would just like to say that I called it  I knew that he still did Pearl for Prank or Present immediately after the last episode was done
Every new season the chest monster gets worse
great start to the episode Grian! Shoots himself 3 times in the foot
Get well soon ❤️❤️🤗
Anyone else feel like grian's base and the entity are gonna collapse once the rift does?
never before has the phrase "I'll see you next week" caused such a bittersweet reaction from me
This is a sick prank. I love it
I am shocked that Grian got Doc to do what he wanted so easily. Master manipulator
Giving someone a prank/present combination is like stealing someone's tool just to do the job they needed it for while they look for it. It's actually very wholesome when you think about it?
Everyone leaving at the end felt exactly like people leaving Narnia
Thinking about it I noticed that theirs is one emperor still on Hermitcraft!  Fwip may be stuck on Hermitcraft the crossover may continue!
Entity? You mean, the Emptity?
Grian taking someone else's secret santa is so funny to me idk why
thank you
Merry early Christmas guys :)
Who else thinks that since Grian was able to not start a war with the Empires people that N.A.R was successful and should now be ended so that Grian can start another Pointless war that we’ve all wanted for oh so long
Honestly, this part of the crossover feels like it was too short. I’m pretty sure the Empires visiting the Hermitcraft server didn’t last as long as the Hermits visiting the Empires server.
The crossover is already over? It felt like nothing came out of it, no appearances, lore, anything really.
Grians present should be mumbo in a box lol
I was surprised no one from empires stayed behind, even by 'accident'
Please say at least one empires person is joining next season
Wow He did get pearl.
i love how you try make it easeir for others<33
26:05 Jimmy’s little Grian hat :0
That: "Do we have to go?" from Shellby hurt my soul
I love every video of this channel. Loved the collaboration while it lasted
I dunno why.. but I kinda like Grian's sick voice..
Fwip didn't go true
Hope you feel better grain
Them going into the portal reminds me of the Evo server.
Feel better soon. ❤️
HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER GRIAN FROM THE KRAZY KRAFT SERVER WE LOVE YOU WISH YOU THE BEST!!!❤❤❤
NOICE
Empires when Hermits are leaving: No please don't leave! Hermits when Empires are leaving: Here's stairs, a chest, get out! Merry Christmas Grian! ☺
Pov, You saw the one block portal: ( 0 0 )                                                                   o
🎄
It was from Scar 😭
I hate how short the empires peeps being on hermitcraft felt, but im excited about future crossovers or other series in the future
grian's prank on pearl isn't a prank at this point, it's a saw trap 💀
It's a shame the Empires in Hermitcraft portion of the crossover was so short; but it was enjoyable while it lasted.   As much as I'm excited to see things get back to normal (I can only enjoy so much "lore"), I was liking the interactions with everyone. It seemed like everyone at least clicked well enough, hopefully there are more mini-crossovers in the future or maybe even a collab series.
wait i havent watched hermitcraft for so long when did joel join?
This is the prank you did to scar, just better, so its a charged creeper prank 2.0
The ending was like the Teletubbies, everyone saying goodbye
Why did no one leave hermitcraft with the outro song? lol 😂
Grian’s secret Santa was cute!😊 (the decorations)
The first thing I say when I see this vid: already?
Docm: What are you doing? Are you bored again? Me:.... Hey guys welcome to another episode of grIan is bored so today we're gonna troll Docm (if you understand this then you're awesome, to me, at this specific moment)
I miss then already...  Well, when this season ends (whenever it does) who knows what kind of people we might see join the server!  Probably no one, but let me hope.
I hope fwhip gets trapped and we steals him from empires
My life actually flashed before my eyes when I saw that sheep popped out..😅
Get better soon Grian! Love your videos!!!
Rip grian's voice
Nice
I miss mumbo
Hi
Grian get well soon
“End of the crossover” Me who enjoys the crossover: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aaawwe, I am more grateful it happened than sad that it ends. Thank you Grian.
Definitly the best Minecraft event in history. Thanks to everyone in empires and hermitcraft for making this event! It was amazing while it lasted!! <333
Bro why did Grian sound like the Michael Jackson in the Fridge kid? 24:11
I hope you feel better soon Grian.  Its sad that the collab is over but it was fun as long as it lasted. I personally wished that both Servers would had merged together because the different playstyles made this even more fun to watch but I can understand that this was only temporary fun. Thanks for the amazing work you all did.
idk why but every time, I think pearl is grian's wife. Probably not tho, right?
aw im sad the crossover is ending- at least Pix got to have a funny last few moments actually in hermitcraft
23:14 Timestamp for grians "ʷʰᴬᵗ"
Grian, why don’t you just use your words and ask him for a creeper?
You know, if you had asked, Doc would probably have gone with it. Edit: after seeing the results, I am even more amazed that Mumbo was able to kill a server with items, since that GIANT mess only caused a lag spike and kept right on running
Grian is good at pranking but if he want to give presents he will and it will be good
I hope we get to go between the servers in the world download because of the rift!
Well now I know how to make my snowman. The End population is gonna go down drastically now
I'm actually really sad when they were saying goodbye one by one. It's been the most fun few weeks I've had watching Minecraft smp content. Thank you for the amazing collab!
I thought you got to be part of the "Pulled Pork" game.
Sad it didn't last longer, it was a lot of fun watching the servers interacting with each other. Do it again next year?
grian you do realize the piston cant move the slimeblock since its conneted to the green terracota block
so sad its over :(
did anyone else get extreme evo flashbacks with how grian built the stairs
No more crossover :(
That was a nice crossover thank u guys
"we didn't have a war!" Idk, that battle when the hermits were trying to go back to hermitcraft seemed pretty warlike.... There was a nuke involved
Grian sounds cute when sick. However I wish you 'gute Besserung'.  Get well soon. :)
I'm sad the crossover is finished 😭
I swear grian is ill every like month
I love how grian accidentally took Joel’s gift 😂  I knew it was a bad idea for Scott to put someone else’s gift in GRIAN’S base
I knew it, from the moment Scott put the present there in Grain's base I noticed he didn't show putting another "for Joel" sign but I thought he did because he didn't forget the signs before  Grain if you see this, that wasn't your present
This crossover was so much fun!
this was an amazing crossover!! i started watching more people on YouTube from both servers because of it. awesome work from everyone :)
Grian, I have a glitch that I can’t see your text. the text that you like, make
If only Grian was Ollie's secret santa. Then the perfect lore accurate gift would have been. . . . A PITY sale shop where he sells 1 dirt for 1 diamond, with all* proceeds going to the Give Ollie a Diamond campaign. May include a Management fee
Merry Christmas. Hope you feel better
Tbh, when Grian was making the present, I thought he was ok with the items potentially despawning
1 year anniversary of the end of season 8, how fitting that the empires people leave today
Pixlriffs leaving was hilarious! Sad we won't get to see more Empires.
Merry Christmas grian
Guys, if the crossover doesn't end at some point, then Empires and Hermitcraft won't go back to being what we always loved in the first place, Empires and Hermitcraft. Each series has their own integrity to maintain, so they have to go back to standard practice at some point. I have loved it so much, but all good things must come to an end.
11:15 I initially laughed at the absurdity of Grian's plan to annoy Doc in the hopes that he would launch charged creepers that Grian could then repurpose, but then I remembered that I'm watching Grian, who has a reputation to keep up, so *_of course_* just asking for a creeper would be too simple, and I laughed again!
i have to say it made me tear up
thank you its over
23:13 LMAO xD
i'm so sad. i love seeing both servers together.
Ok now all absent hermits need to come back to at least help finish the srason. Iskall, mumbo etc not saying what they have been doing isn't ok just that certain things need resolved. Like mumbo vault aka mumbo wall
Has anyone else noticed that, when he's sick, Grian kind of sounds like Reekid, or is it just me.
The rift is getting smaller  Mumbo: Lag
Crossover was fun to watch both on the empire's and hermitcraft's side!
A trick to avoid losing items that way... Keep pressed Ctrl+Q to keep launching the stuff you get from the ground by stacks, essentially resseting the 5 minute timer while relocating stuff to a single place
Doc going: “what are you doing.. are you bored again?” Is just the best reaction possible. 12:20
Timmy is streaming dressed as Woody.
Tim would fit through the portal;)
Pix doing the outro to the hermitcraft recap was pure comedy gold
Its cross-over
I can't decide which part of this episode is my favourite. Your panic at the items being spilled, the casual "Let'S poke the GOAT", or Pix going through the portal and closing off the recap jokes for good. It's ALL so good
the fact there wasnt an interserver war is strange
To answer your question about hitting the dragon doc broke it’s AI so if it gets hit I belive the AI will be fixed destroying the world
Thank god the crossover is done it was so bad
Honestly even if pearl had hit it it'd still be a great prank.. she'd get the shock of it NEARLY blowing up literally everything you have but still get the present of cleaning it up
That was classic, you getting the worst of your own prank in the most foreseeable way.  Never change!  I will miss the Empires crew.  They were fun to have around.  I hope that one day in the future the two servers will meet again.
Congratulations you played yourself
I was half expecting one of the empires people to show up after the portal closes and ask what's going on.
FINAAALLYY TOOK SO LONG 😴😴😴 boring ass empire bs
I loved the button fidget toy you got it was a perfect gift for someone who can’t resist buttons.
The end of the Crossover, same day 1 year ago when the Moon Big Crash of 2021.
_Hermits leave_  Empires: NOOOOoooo we love you don't gooo! _Empires leave_  Hermits: ok off you go, byeeeee!
I love grains Minecraft videos
Maybe some of the empires guys will be back next season as official hermits...?
Hope u get well soon, and thanks for the awesome content :)
739th
I’m actually quite sad that the crossover is done :( We don’t get to see all of them interact with each other that often so it’s always so entertaining when we do.
As sad as I am that the crossover is over, I'm very glad everyone involved had a good time! It was so nice to see people who we don't get to see interact a lot (or at all) really jump all in and get the most out of this event. I'm also happy that we can get back to our regularly scheduled programming because it's been a little crazy over the past couple weeks XD and I can't wait to see what everyone does next!
Hope you do another crossover next year
"We had an interaction with a whole other server and didn't have a war, so I think that's a win" -Grian 2022
Have a good day and a great Christmas
I really liked the last life series Grian, will it ever come back?
Here is a plot twist: Jimmy is average size, Everyone else is 10 feet tall. Joel is 20 feet.
i hate the no spoilers stuff because i actually love it when i get to see the same moment from different perspectives. but i guess for those who dont like it its fine.
This is actually evil and the stupidest but smartest thing I’ve seen Grian do
Get well soon wafflehead
The Christmas Jumper has just arrived for me today! Right before Christmas! It’s really comfortable, and to add on the bonus, got a new HermitCraft episode!
13:00 that creeper shot out so fast that even on the slowest play back speed my screen just barely caught it😂
when u said i tricked u guys its actually pearl last episode i was thinking youd do that
Now do we get mumbo back. We miss him very much.
Annoying Doc to get him to launch a creeper worked surprisingly well!
28:48 I'm pretty surprised about that too
18 diamond blocks?! Someone was holding out on the king 😁
lol
Petition for Joel to be on Hermitcraft
I wonder how long it’s going to take for Grian to hit the dragon. Be honest, we all know it’s going to happen someday LOL!
I just realized that if the Entity is empty, you could call it the Emptity, which kinda sounds like MTT. OH YES!!!!
Hello :D
i get the feeling you didnt even reroll it and you just made a big show about rerolling it lol
Doc got played
Happy 22nd of December, 5 pm!
Already
The christmas wreath portal is fuckin' adorable, and you should keep it all year.
now its time for grian to get mad that there was now war and tries to reopen the rift to attack them
Sad to see the crossover is over. It was a lot of fun though
i miss mumbo
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE PEARL 2 TIMES HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo WHY IS THERE NO WAR
Get better soon
uuuuuaaaahhhhhh.
Was this crossover ambitious? Yes. Was it super fun? Hecc yeh
23:41 what in the update supression is that
i hope this is as long as season 6
Hope there are crossovers again in the future, was a lot of fun watching the new interactions between Hermits and Empires folks they might not have experience playing with.
Yay new episode of hermitcraft
Im gonna miss the Empires crew on Hermitcraft.  This was such a fun crossover. Also not Pix ending like the rcap ending. He is so funny.
Well they did have the fight trying to escape empires, would that count as a war?
Hope Grian remembered to nametag it
Such a good crossover
END? END?!
Where's fwhip?
Grian's gonna suffer 5AM Pearl's wrath someday.
It'll be weird to see things go back to normal, not that you can really call much on Hermitcraft normal.  Also there's no more king.   Also, please do not get the flu. Not so close to Christmas. I have had the flu and it is really pants.
I know this breaks the lore, but it's been bugging me since the start of the cross over.  Where does the portal actually go? lol  Guess I'll have to wait for the world download. haha  Get well soon. <3
next part other universe mumbo come out of the portal
hope you get better grian!
doc getting annoyed at grian was so fricken funnny lmfao
Can't tell if this time hes telling the truth
19:19 "In hindsight this was a terrible idea" In FORESIGHT it was a terrible idea
I have loved the crossover.   My two favorite servers collided in the best ways ever. I’ve been on the edge of my seat for the whole thing.  Thank you for the wonderful show that I have gotten to watch from the beginning. I love all of the shanangans (how to spell)
When u getting netherite armor
In this video we have Grian talking to: Joel-The short god Doc-Treats the laws of physics as a sugestion Pearl-Cleaning lady who wants to clean Grians chest monster
Grian: we interacted with another server and didn't have a war *Literally the part where the hermits tried to get home was a war*
I was really hoping that a mumbo jumbo would pop through the portal as it closed
Your videos are great
I knew it was going to be pearl, I said that last week!!!!!! 🤣
Grian is this type of friend that is super annoying, but if you dont have him as a friend, your life is too boring
It would have been great to see a notification,  "Mumbo Jumbo joined the server," as either Grian signed off or just before the Portal broke.
What?📈📈📈🤣🤣 Decorations📈📈📈
aw well hopefully grumbot can send messages to the empires peeps
Hope you get better soon grian
Can't wait to see pix next week!
that should of been 1 EPISODE, it was too long
I hope mumbo comes back after this.
38 minutes
first time i'm early
Deserved
That was *amazing.* I loved that crossover so much. But what I really want to know, is what’s happening with the empires people. What about Grumbot? Didn’t he say he was gonna terminate the server because Mumbo isn’t in it? What’s happened to it since they were gone? *I need to know*
53685th
You and doc together is some of the best hermicraft content 😂
"Doesn't make sense"? This is a Grian video we're talking about. Expected Chaos makes sense. Grian panicking himself was just the icing on the cake.
That was so sad, why did it have to be so sad?
It’s alright Grian, everyone is sick with a flu, cold, fever, Covid, pinkeye, and many other things. If you know someone who is sick then 👇
Here in the first 37 minutes.
That was so fun.
hope u get well soon grian
Grian's hoarse voice reminds me of "mumbo afk" back in season 6. Get feeling better soon G ;)
Grian old boy, I should quite like to purchase one of your pretty Christmas sweaters but I don’t know if there was a deadline for pre-ordering, I checked the page but am still in the dark, did I have to pre-order in November? I don’t know. It says that it’s sold out but I don’t know if that’s for the original release or for the February batch. I am in need of your assistance. Thanks and merry Christmas :)
imagine mumbo came out the portal at that moment  lol
Early
The Saddest Hermitcraft episode title doesn't exis-
does this mean mumbo is back
and with that, oli officially went The Entire Crossover without dropping a single youtube video
This entire empires-on-hermitcraft saga has just been a recap video. From: This week on Hermitcraft: ME!  to  My name has been Pixlriffs, my writer has been ZloyXP, captions on this video were provided by Lyarah. Thanks for watching, see you next week.
I'm not crying over the end of the cross over you are  CRIES ON THE CORNER
This was a real fun episode, hope you feel better soon.
Mumbo: "Hey guys what'd I miss?"
This whole crossover has honestly felt like a fever dream… it’s been so surreal. It feels weird watching them leave. It’s difficult to imagine them as two separate servers again. But both sides have left legacies behind, and made their marks on the world. This has been crazy fun to watch and I can’t wait for the usual shenanigans to continue! This crossover has been absolutely incredible but I must admit that I have missed the usual fun and games. But like Grian said, it has been a much needed breath of fresh air (something Grian certainly sounds like he could use right about now 😅) Thank you to everyone who participated in this amazing event. Goodbye, Empires, and hello!
typing from only 5 minutes in: your Secret Santa idea makes perfect sense, it's just psychological warfare!
Grian taking Joel's present is gonna result in yet another war.     It's always grian isn't it...
i need there to be a full combined smp after these seasons end, they all work so well together and get along so well
13:04 UMMMM ACSHUALLY IT WAS 2 FRAMES GRAIN
Get well soon, Grian.
Anyone else getting Deja Va from Zed in S7 and the base swap with pearl cleaning up?
Im sad to see the crossover is over but i can wait to get back into regular Hermitcraft and Empires. Get well soon Grian
Pearl bluescreened
Ugga
This crossover was absolutely amazing!
its episode 32 and it was posted 32 minutes ago. thought that was cool.
Not grian sounding like a teenager for the second half of the video-🤣😭😭
When you said bye it was lower than usual. I hope you feel better!
What the Grian Head doing on Solidarity's Head?
Just wanted to let you know your sweater is really comfy !! I love it
You should've made the present for pearl a nut 🥜 shape and called it "grian in a nutshell"
2:32 is that dying villagers in Background?
This was such a fun crossover!!
I had so many ideas about this crossover, is this how a member joins HC and leaves empires? Or the other way around? This was such a cool crossover! GG
The sent off reminds me of evo smp xD
i do not trust that snowman...
Is sick grian what grian sounded like as a teenager?
I love Scar's first reaction to Grian''s "No War" comment was to immediately start one.
to be honest i forgot the entitiy exsisted
It's funny That I predicted that you will still do secret Santa to pearl. It's just a grain move.
yes, this tree farm is genuinely amazing, I also build it on my SMP :D thank you for showing me this design and thanks Ianxofour for designing it
I had a feeling that grian would stick with pearl.
Some of us knew that you'd go and prank Pearl regardless
Best content creator in my opinion
0:50 I thought that was a common bug because it happens to me 99% of the time when I play lmao
Could've made the crossover end in january so you can have xmas and new years together danggg
Yeeeeessss!!! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Thankyou grian.
This whole adventure between the two servers has been so heartwarming for the season and with all that's been going on in the real world. Thank you Empires folks! Thank you Hermits.
Hi
Oh man, that prank-esent was absolutely EPIC.
Sad to see that the crossover is done but I’m happy to have discovered new creators on empires!
I cannot believe how easily grian played doc LOL
I love how that creeper cannon is a single frame
At least they didn't start a war!
Ngl, I expected that he would do pearl anyway
The fact that doc did exactly what grian wanted
*off camera grian makes the rift smaller* "OH! I- I wonder how that's happend"
If I got a nickel for every time Grian needed a charged creeper for a “school project” then I would have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it’s happened twice.
Grain is a beast but I miss jumbo
thanks for the crossover Grian it was fun while it lasted happy yule
The snowman needs glasses he is squinting
Pixel riffs has the best final words
and then the Portal exploded, fully merging Empires and Hermit craft, along with several other SMPs
9:14 "Mumbo? Is the moon big?"
Hope you get better soon,thankyou for the amazing content
You should cross over with lifesteal
Hi
Can’t believe it’s over already! It was so emotional the way they all said bye and went through!
I KNEW HE WOULD GET PEARL ANYWAYS I OUTSMARTED YOUR OUTSMATING
Most goats leaves horn behind when they try to ram you... THE G.O.A.T leaves charged creepers and have a pet that can fly thru everything while destroying it... Just saying poking doc might not be the smartest thing. Funny though. 😂
I'll miss live recaps 🥺
So sad to see Empires people going soon! I've been in the MCYT community for a hot sec and Grian and Joel were the first people I watched, from HC 6 to Kingdomcraft. Cheers everyone to an epic crossover!
If anything, this was the greatest crossover of all time. Smash like to agree.
Pearl just in tears with the prank was just golden 😂😂
Dude, I might’ve found a reference so he got coal and a little bit of gold, which is basically the same thing the watchers gave him on Evo
Oh no, Grian is bored again that's a bad sign... What a great crossover. I love it so much
why hello there
Minecraft fact: if a player hits another player into the void then it gives a funny death message.
It’s my birthday btw
15:31 What is that?
*Lore barrier*  23:51 How did you make the portal? With the custom portals data pack/update supression/update skipping or a admin command?  I’m just curious if doc was there to do it lol
GRIAAAAN YOU FORGOT TO PUT "9" IN THE VIDEO TITLE!!!! QUICK YOU HAVE TO FIX!!!
*{•°∆±~Merry'Christmass~±∆°•}*
GRIAN TIMMY IS DRESSED AS WOODY RN!
Moon big? Nah, portal small.
that prank could crash the server
remember build swap
season 8: moon's big season 9: portal's small
When I go on vacation, I also live out of my suitcase lol
Let's pretend it's not 4:30 am for me rn...
hi
Grian shouting  'CLEAN' at a crying pearl is probably the best thing I have ever seen
how to get a charged creeper in your base: annoy doc until they send one
Let's be honest, we all knew he was going to take Pearl again. 😂
Detective: "How do you know it's the real Grian?"  Grian: "It's a prank and a present, oh, also, it makes no sense. I'm just going to be talking for five minutes without an explanation."
Did u tag the creeper?
Shame to see the crossover end but at least Grian won’t loose another grumbot…I think
Imagine if that charged creeper canon can first splash the creeper with invis and speed boost
“Are you bored again” might sum up grian the best way possible
Do you think Grian noticed Jimmy wearing one of hit Greggs?
I love how Grian goes from just somewhat of a prank to maniacal laughter to regret to giving a great gift. Grian is not much of a chaotic hermit.
More hermitcraft
I actually laughed when grian saw Joel's secret santa gift
doc thinking he outsmarted grian  Grain: im 12 parelel universes ahead of you
383rd
This event was great for Grain's chobblesome lore
How about we just trap the people from empires in hermitcraft? please
Hello love ur vids
Gran, that present was joels
12:17 "Are you bored again?" The implications that whenever Grian is bored he'd just go annoy Doc until Doc decides to throw a charged creeper at him are incredible
Seeing pix leave made me so sad
A wise Grian once said:" And it was going so well" :)
I just died when Grian opened Joel's last presentand started mining all the coal.
Green when you said traps don’t always work in your video I know that because of third life last life and the other one I think you had like 10 traps that failed😂
m
Imagine if in season 10 everyone in the crossover is invited. That’d make my year
GRIAN why do never talk to mumbot??
Was that creeper nametagged?
Oh god Grian plz tell me you removed the terracotta you placed next to the launch slime block in your pressent!
Why not make a ramp into the entity
could you remove the tingly bell sounds in the background please? i constantly check to hear where they are coming from
That ender chest is telling you something Grian, “I open at the close” 😂
<3
Thank you for doing the crossover in the first place! I subbed to all the hermits during king rendog's reign and now am subbed to more awesome people on the empires server ☺️
Some people find joy with family and friends. Grian finds it in automatic tree farms. Whatever makes you happy 😊
How could grian steal joals present like that
I’m so sad to see it end already, but I’m glad that it happened! I love watching so many of the Hermits and Empires members and it’s been great watching you all collab together.
😃😃
In the lore, they (most likely) will return, to take down grumbot (if we are right about him being evil)

welp, the empirers didnt last long
I had a idea that Brian just grabbed the pearl name offscreen
grian, all we do is overthink. btw love ur vids i recently subscribed, hope ur doin well!
Episode 32!
5:29 herobrine sheep???
Reeeehehehehehe
i love that tree farm i need to make one
Last Episode Me: Knowing grian he's still going to prank pearl and he's only saying this so that people don't spoil it. This Episode Grian: Imma prank pearl Me: *shooketh*
Merry Christmas everyone!. This crossover has been so great and I hope to see other ones in the future ❤
13 minutes ago we farmed trees
Nooooo! The crossover! Oh well, I hope another crossover takes place again, maybe in between seasons so it could stay for longer.
Why do I kinda ship pearl and grian
Hi grian rewatching season 7
I kinda feel like the story elements are unnecessary, I just came here to watch a Minecraft SMP, not a roleplay  Edit: like the rift or the moon
yeah new video
Seeing that stack of chests is reminding me of the pain and misery of stacking crates in VCD. Good thing Minecraft doesn't have physics so that stack can just explode out randomly despite being stacked nicely.
The present for Joel was from Scott if anyone is interested in that information.
loved it
I KNEW HE GOT PEARL AGAIN!! I CALLED IT
It was cool but I’m kinda glad the crossover is done
Love your vids grian!❤
Let’s go!!! Another freshly cooked grian video!  Ps: Hope you get better!
The crossover has ended will mumbo come back
You didnt fool me grian i knew you would still do pearl because it just seemed like something you would do
Also just saying: Being gifted tons of coal in Minecraft is a super good gift
So many comments already
I just totaly forgot that this was even a cross over, cause everyone add so great chemistry! Looking foward to other crossover like that!
This crossover was truly one of the events in hermitcraft history.
960 person to like 😊
Grian gave me a new reason to hate English, nonsense is just no sense combined into one word and I’ve only now realised this.
Who else loved this crossover!!?!?!
Hi
Early today
Ya know, i had a feeling you got pewrl again. Idk why, I just felt it in my soul.
I knew it was gonna be Pearl
sheep 5:30
Still one of the greatest crossover
I absolutely love when Hermits interact with Doc! We need more, he is such a madman! (and a fun guy!)
The crossover is an event we will be talking about for many seasons to come
This crossover has been amazing. Thanks to Grian  and the crew for making it possible!
grian opening scar's secret santa 😂
Today's Fact:   Large Companies Such As Google Always Use The Color Blue For Black, Because The Color Matters If you going to make it darker, so since blue is one of the darkest colors by itself, they tone it down to make a "Ultra Black" kind of color.  Also Credit To Another User Who Made A Funfact.
A book on a lecturn? I thought Pearl can't read
i love you and your vids
"I, the mysterious Grian are..." Yup. No problems with the first sentence
ahhh yes i can now eat without waiting 20 minutes till i find the right video to watch while doing it
GRIAN I AM CURRENTLY WATCHING TIM’S STREAM WHAT THE HECK I DIDN’T KNOW YOU WERE SKILLED AT POTTERY WHAT- THAT MUG YOU MADE- IT’S SO GOOD- WHFJKEKQKSNDHIEMQMQWHATJSNHEJEKWHATWHAT
People don't worry if you've been watching some origins people have been saying stuff that may hint to a crossover Also ratsmp too. And Scott smajor has been on all
OMG I'm so early wth
Chrimus
Honestly just glad to be back to see what the empires real lore is
We'll miss the crossover.
The fact grian can destroy any redstone machine is so funny😂
I like that you say "I are your secret santa" in the book for pearl
crosslorever*
This crossover was fun while it lasted
It felt like such a short time..
Grian posts a video :😎 It's the end of the crossover : ☹️ It's still a good video: 😎
I love hermit craft :D
You make good mugs
I arrived here a lot earlier than expected, huh. Can’t comment bout the video but Ello people who see this. Preemptive love for the video!
“This prank or present makes no sense whatsoever. It makes no sense to anybody.” - All of Hermitcraft summed up.
HI GRIAN YOU ARE AWESOME
It was nice while it lasted
6 muinute crew
grian smallishbeans video said that your seceret santa was pearl like 3 days ago i didnt spoill it but just saying pearl might know :(
Finally! I can start watching Hermitcraft again
Joel's pov of this was hilarious 🤣 he was so confused that you opened the present. To be fair Scott should've put a sign about it being explicitly for Joel.  Love the video's Grian keep up the amazing work ✌
Sad that the crossovers over
e
So sad that the cross over is ending 😢 it was so good and funny at the same time I love the way you have made your vids this season keep it up 😁
got here in time 3 minutes
Pog a grian video
this crossover has been such a blast!! it’s sad to see it go but I had such a fun time watching all the new dynamics that came out of it! so long empires <3
first
Grian: so this isn’t gonna make sense Me: REALLY? GRIAN, NOT MAKING SENSE, ON HERMIT CRAFT??? WHAAAAAAATTT THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY
Hi
early
NOOOOOO  It was fun watching the crossover of hermitcraft and empires but just like the quote i cant remember "all things must come to an end" but also this is one that will stick to the seasons best episodes or ya know i forgot now so i hope in the future more crossovers like this will happen
The fact that scott didn't leave a note that it was for joel and grian got confused is  raw gold
Grian that was Joel's gift idk why they didn't put a sign

Today's fact: In Slovakia they have Christmas Carp that live in the family bathtub for a few days before they are eaten.
