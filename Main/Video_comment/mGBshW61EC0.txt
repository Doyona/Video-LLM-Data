They're starting to realize that we don't need an origin story every time we see a super hero movie, or every time they reboot one. Marvel did it right with Spooderman, and The Batman did it right here. Like, most of us know how batman started, and if not, they can lean over and ask someone who does.
Having not seen the movie, I don't get the rat wing thing. Is it not batman? Are bats not rats with wings? Im confused.
SAW, with Batman in it?
She was selling that cat, woman!
ermember, ya skant pell "twiknight" wthiout "twikn"
5:10 😆 oh my damn
2:06 POV: when you get out of your retirement
@4:35 CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK. The most silent ninja in the world, riiiiight😂😂😂 Robocop has more stealth
I wish we could get a decade without a movie Batman. I'm tired boss.
Colin Farells WHAT now
3:56 Brilliant
No matter what Robert Pattinson does in his career, he's never going to escape the shadow of Twilight.
A rat with wings? Obviously Rocky the Flying Squirrel !!
That comment about Batman being depressed worse off than his parents and bracing for his city to be flooded while being destroyed by corruption really hit too close to home.
Gerard Wayne 😂😂😂😂 my emo Heart 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Honestly, I wanted to hate this movie because of Pattinson, but he ended up being my second favorite Batman after Keaton. Does it have flaws? Sure, all movies do. It was cool to see a story lean into the detective part, for once, and not just go for 100% action. It's an underdeveloped part of the character on film
Gotham police "Mustache division." 🤣
Worst live action Batman movie
After Batman and Robin, the only way to go was up
My favourite Batman movie so far but I gotta say ….. it got severe screenplay issues
I liked this movie 😶
Bella, i can be with you anymore 😢, because i am vengeance, i am the nigth, i am Batman 😮
The Riddler, Catwoman, the Penguin, Joker together in the same movie? Is it 1966 already?
Love how Honest Trailers pokes fun at The Batman's dark tone and complex plot, yet still gives credit where it's due, really enjoyed the review!
It's gonna leave a...skid mark!...lol
What's the song playing in the background. Sounds like a Nirvana song but i can't figure out which.
Worst Batman. Worse than Clooney, Kilmer or even Adam West. First time watching I turned it off halfway thru
*ugh*...no real critique even though the movie was medicore at best? Sure. Savor the comment.
Shovelface
GCPD, Mustache Division   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:48 Wrong, you clearly don't know italian.
To be fair, can't think of a more fitting gimmick for cleaning up a city than a guy dressed like a garbage bag. That's some genius branding right there!
Loved the gritty tone, but did anyone else feel the runtime was a bit long? Still, Pattinson nailed the brooding Batman vibe!
Taking this movie for what it is, it’s actually a great movie. I didn’t like the hospital scenes, but Peterson did a believable job. I wasn’t sure about this movie, but by giving it a chance, i enjoyed it alot. I have watched it 8 times so far.
Do zardoz. It will be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Partnering with Supercuts is even weirder than this movie partnering with little Caesars.
Actually, Spawn movie. That'd be funnier.
I'm still spamming comments, so listen up!  Please say "I love the way you work it, NO DIGGITY!" And also, in honor of dark superheroes, a Spawn honest trailer. The TV show -- everybody hates the movie.
I hate this movie!! Its woke and the whole goth look of Bruce Wayne is just awful. This movies riddler is an annoying boring looking nerd. Not the least bit scary!!!!!  Matt Reeves can postpone the sequel to 2035, for alll I care. I wont be seeing it anyway.
Why did they put Edward into the Batman’s suite? Why?
Do you want cake or THE cake?
😂😂😂😂😂 someone really put that on film oneday
Gerard Wayne was a funny shout out.
I thought this movie was okay… I saw it in theatres three times… and once at home… do I love this movie? Am I lying to myself? No, it was just okay… gotta watch it once more to find out for sure
Actually, this is the first Batman movie in a while where Gotham feels like Gotham and not just off brand New York
"Somethin in the rain 😢"
Too much was happening in this movie, and yet they successfully made unchaotic.
Loved the soundtrack more than anything 👍
Worst batman since the 60s
Robert Battinson
Gerard Wayne 🤣
Awesome movie!
Mustache division is a really underrated joke 😂
Horrible Movie!  I'd rather watch the penguin!!!!!!!&!
I'd love to know what the music to this trailer is. It is almost Nirvana which I get the reference...
This was hilarious
Good stuff.  Some great puns in there so keep up the good work!
This is the worst batman film or franchise ever
PLEASE DO !!honesr trailer THE PINGUIN !!!!!!!
I don't know if I should say this, but if Epic Voice Guy goes on a brutal campaign of terror against worldwide corruption, I will like and subscribe.
I’m sorry… “some brown teenagers?” Is that what I’m hearing? I’m like, “No, that can’t be the case.” Right???
# Noone knows what it's like to be the baaaaaatmaaaaaan... #
My family is Falcone in Chicago. We’ve always pronounced it Falconē
Great movie
El Rata Alada was such a lame plot point
Was'nt that shot using IMAX cameras...?...Oo?...
You are good man !
Movie is a snooze fest . So many slow take shots just milking the clock . Terrible film
SCREW THE HATERS I LOVED IT ! AND I'VE SEEN THE OTHER BATMAN MOVIES,!
You didn't say the Batman from Scooby Doo was better than this emo insult to real fans. I'm very disappointed in you Screen Junkies.
Twinight 😂😅
Thank you for calling attention to that building👷‍♂️bus 🚌 🙂 fall. That was epically brutal 😳 and comically harmless.
Blandman. He’s the worst Batman. Terrible actor!
Batman does more damage to the civilians in this movie than any of the bad guys ever did..
I thought the batman actor was going riddler. oh well.
Sorry, HT guys but the Pitch Meeting for this was so much better than the HT.
Robert Bat-tinson
8 parts Seattle lol, definitely got Seattle vibes
Just riddles and movie fights will suffice.... now, Dance!
Martinez that guys the homie🤣🤣😭😭😭
THE TWIKNIGHT SAGA?
…bringing a weird fetish goth to a crime scene…
Harvey dent. A Mayor/electoral officially trying to get votes by upholding values and arrests of the falcone family. Gets acid thrown at him in trail, unleashes a multiple personality disorder becomes Two-Face. Makes his own luck. Kills Carmine falcone. Becomes crime mob boss. Never shy from bruces friendship. Face takes over. Bruce/bats doesnt intervene
Not a bad movie, but just super boring
Yet the “World’s Greatest Detective” didn’t know what a ‘tucker’ was…
“I am falling, with style…watch out for the bus-OH!!!” - HISHE
I was really waiting for the shovelface jokes. Missed opportunities.
Big trouble in little china trailer?? Soon???
This is one of the most boring and unbearable movies I have eber seen. Fucking almost made me hate Batman.
😂
Thats actually how you say Falcone. Actual italians don't say it like that. 😅
Colin Farrell watching the old daredevil movie 😆
*nice* sarcastic... xD
worst batman ever
This movie looks like poo
This Honest Trailer, ohh, it makes me feel some type of way. And here is my review, in only two words (at a time.)          — Good movie. Honest trailer. New Batman? Needs sparkle. No shirt? No shoes? No day-diamonds?! Rob knows... The Catwoman? Undry dream. The Penguin? Uhhh...pass. Best part? Theme song!! Nanananana Batman!
The Daredevil joke was hilarious!
😂man you got me in Darker point
The problem with this batman is that if he does not do nothing everything happens the same, something that does not happens with any other batman
"Mustache Division"
What's with the idea that Falcone is "correctly" pronounced "fahl-CONE"? It's an Italian last name that means "falcon" and it's pronounced "fahl-COH-neh" (NOT "fahl-COH-knee")
So many great scenes added up to a mediocre film 🎞️ 😢
Gerard Wayne 😂 I'm laughing in G note ❤
Twink batman.
I know multiple people who got lice from a Supercuts at a mall
I can't explain it. It's a pretty good movie, but man.. It's too long with all the rule of cool shots, it hits all the standard beats, It's the most emo thing that's ever been created... Also interested how they cut out the "boring" Bruce Wayne stuff, when he really could have done the most good going to a board meeting...
Do better call saul you cowards
I've never seen it and never will. It is against my values and morals
DARKERRRR!
They should totally have the joker say something like “Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?” or something like that
A good Batman movie can never be too long
so, we are walking slowly to the 60's batman... right...nananaanananaa, baatman..!
i looked this up specifically because they say all "Jesus!" instead of cursing, easily 30 or more times over the course of the film, and ya'll missed it.   I mean, Jesus!
"Collin Farrell watching the Old Daredevil movie" 😂😂🤣🤣. How do you even come up with these things.
I’m not the right age for this, I stopped watching Batmen at Christian. Shoulda stopped at George, since my guilty pleasure is Batman and Robin, mostly cuz Ahhnold and Uma.
Ew worst Batman movie. Id rather watch Batman and Robin.
FYI. New York City gets more annual rainfall than Seattle.
Youre actually R tr ted for downplaying the knockout game
this movie made me realize how long it's been since we saw a superhero actually, y'know, helping people. like a hero. instead of just punching a big guy a bunch of times
Shovelface!😂
You did surpass 500 likes and subscribers
Slow boring, over brooding, style over substance. I hated it
Damn this movie sucked. I was just waiting for one of them to bust out a wand and start using magic. It was harry potter . lol
Druig sucks!
This movie in one sentence. A side quest about Batman’s mom.
I hate this movie.
Please, anyone, I'm going crazy: what is the song used in most of the background of the trailer? Especially around 03:00 that grungy sounding bit...
8 parts Seattle, because of the rain? It rains more in NYC than it does in Seattle.
Do battlefield 2042 game
And real life Glasgow
Except Druig actually doesn't suck in this one.
I love BatPat
great director, awesome lead actor, amazing music, perfect shots, cool costume, good story, fantastic cast, BORING ACTION! i'm sorry. it's not exciting. i tried not to sleep, watched it 3 times since it came out. change the title to "THE SAD MURDER DETECTIVE".
Totally forgot this movie
This is just a remake of se7en.
The Batman >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The Dark Knight
I would even subscribe if you murdered someone for me.😘
Batman's movie tended to seem kinda timeless but yeah this one definitely had a Gen Z feel especially with the social media influencer stick
The show Gotham got Falcone name right
Now that you mentioned the whole Gen Z thing, I did notice a few woke snips, social media craze, and other things so it makes sense now....
Bruce would've been worse off than his parents because he wasn't active in the business. Sound alike someone not wanting to work to me lol
overdone, imitative (Blade Runner rain, darkness, whispering, freakishness), non-action, plodding, off-source, overly trendy casting, and worst, BORING!
Every single batman has their eyes painted black, this is the first one to show it XD
I don't remember much but was Collin doing his best DeNiro impression? He kinda had the make up.
So a costumed vigilante walks into a room full of police officers, and DOESN'T get himself arrested???
gerard wayne had me dead
4:11 sorry what? am I the only one who heard that?
The worst Batman I've seen in decades.
Didn't really like this. I was excited for a more detective batman, but he was just incompetent and would not have even kept up enough to follow the breadcrumbs without everyone else giving him the answers, much less being a worlds greatest detective and getting in front of the plot to do something interesting. Nope, just slowly connecting the dots and getting punched.
What happened to the original voice of this channel? He quit? Just curious….
"One part NY, and eight parts Seattle..."  Interesting fact, NYC gets significantly more rain in a year than Seattle. 🌧🌧🌧
what’s the grunge tune in the background
When a haunting in venice comes out please do 1974's Murder on the Orient Express
Does anyone know the name of the song playing in the backgroud starting at 2:57?
I couldn't take Bruce Wayne in this movie serious when he started writing his diary while listening to Nirvana. Zoe Kravitz was amazing though.
A lot of people criticizing the movie for not having bruce wayne sections and also batman not being competent enough missed the entire point of the movie
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-Lam-Bert! Honest Trailer for Highlander please!
This movie is really boring and it is strange how disconnected it all is you could take out major characters and plotlines and the rest of them would be totally unaffected. People keep saying it shows Batman doing real detective work but he doesn't actually solve anything himself every all he does it react to what is revealed.
2:10 its unbelievable for him to not have a brain cavity full of mush.   even if he had a motorcycle helmet on.
Fuedliblasae!
0:21 *Barbie: The Album starts playing in the distance*
nanananana batman
2:19  - what do you expect. It's a movie for the consumers
The most ridiculous thing for me was that  ,,Batmobile" WTF was that 😂😂 For sure it was cheap for the producers,  no doubt about that.
Words cannot describe how much I adore this film.
The most extraordinary comic book and detective film in years!
“Meet the Riddler, a guy with more diehard followers than Zack Snyder DC fans”
500 followers 😂😂 Sounds like a ratt
Worst Batman ever made
Incelsior fucking took me out.😭
Hahaha Collin watching the dare devil movie was brilliant
Incelsior!
"in his Twilight sparkle"  Was that an MLP reference?!?
"He's done more to stop corruption than Batman ever did, with nothing but a roll of duck-tape"🤣🤣🤣
I’m tired of them making realistic Batman movies
Best Batman ever.
Wait…but…Gotham is Chicago, isn’t it? Isn’t Metropolis supposed to be New York?
I appreciate you acknowledging that bruce barely solved any of the puzzles and the one he did he got WAY wrong. All I ever hear are people sucking this movie's dick. To me, it's 3 hours I'll never get back.
What I don't like about this Batman is how they shove down the viewer's throat that this is a  different Batman. Nolan's Batman was effortless in being different but this Batman is working so hard to be not the usual Batman.
The missed opportunity of saying, "Is that critic?"
MOVIE FIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Too long for my bladder
I have serious doubts that anyone who thinks this shows Batman’s detective skills ever actually watched this movie.  He doesn’t detect Jack squat, and he literally doesn’t stop a single crime!  WORST BATMAN EVER… and that’s saying something considering George Clooney’s Batman exists!
"Perfection. I mean, I have no notes."  So good. And, I agree.
Feel like we missed an opportunity to call him Robert Battinson
Your Honest Trailer isn't Honest. You deliberately ignored some key plot disasters that you were so quick to catch on in other movies. Like for instance, the bomb that explodes in his face and yet the uncovered lower half of his face isn't blown to smithereens. When the bomb explodes and he only "loses consciousness", the police doesn't remove his mask and yet for some reason moves him all the way to the police station where they get the amazing idea to "hey, let's try and remove the mask". This movie is an epitome to weak and on-the-nose writing. And don't even get me starting on the lighting.
Man, I would not wanna be the Joker in a Pattinson Batman movie.  He's get beat to death on day 1!
The older this gets, the truer it becomes.
Mustache Division😆🤣🤣
I'm not sure how I've missed this channel. But damn you are funny. Been binge watching your content since last night
Dear World,  "Oh come on" is not a punchline. Sincerely,  A Dissatisfied Customer
Discovered this channel recently and eagerly clicked on this video since anything Robert Pattinson is just too much material to milk. Wasn't disappointed.
4:32 that moment when the random goon with face paint is Tim Drake's Robin in the new DC Titans series.
Yeah, even I dont understand why they put Joker into every DC movie now, is the audience really that crazy about Joker.
The Batman (2022) Box Office: $832.4 million
Even darker… Darker than that… (Batman voice) DARKRRRR!!! … that’s just a black screen…
Such a good most anticipated review.
Mmuahh perfection LOL
I loved this movie.  So well done!  And I am not a huge Batman fan.
This is the most Batman movie ever in that it takes a story completely unrelated to the Joker and yet still brings him into the fold
He's not dressed like a garbage bag, he's the Green Bastard from Trailer Park Boys.
his villains are influencers 😱MG!! You killed me with that one... 🤦‍♂️
Absolute garbage 🤣
This really good! I had no interest to see The Batman from watching the trailer a year ago. Christopher Nolan already did "dark and serious" Batman movies with his trilogy. I 'll never understand why Matt Reeves made this one. Bruce younger and in year two of being Batman, and Riddler is a weirdo who uses social medi and cryptic puzzles to mess with Batman.  Voice over lets know that is the longest Batman movie ever at 3 hours. I'm glad I skipped it. Well done.
This movie sucked
Do Superman III
dc : we donot make new parts of movies , me remake them
Riddles would be a fun add in.
I can't tell from this trailer if the movie is worth watching, lol.
Honestly this one had the best Batman/Gordon chemistry of any other Batman movie
Mopeman. More likely to mope around then solve crimes.
seeing this now I know I made the right choice not seeing the movie
👌😄
They used the Lod's name in vain in this movie. I believe Hollywood so regularly does this to desensitize us to it and to mock Jesus. Jesus is real and is coming back. The Holy Bible is His word and trusting it and Christ's sacrifice on the cross for our sins is the only way to be forgiven. God bless you all to be saved from hell and have eternal life in Jesus. Amen.
He's the Batman we deserve, but not the one we need right now.
💀💀
One of the most overrated films ever. It’s so unnecessarily long, Bruce makes stupid decisions constantly, there’s plot holes, it’s supposed to focus on his detective skills but he barely solves anything himself.   The worst part of it all is the entire 3rd act completely goes against the riddlers motives for the rest of the film. He goes from wanting to rid the city of corrupt officials to indiscriminately mass murdering civilians for literally no reason.
The best lines in this movie  trailer were;   *"the first gen Z Batman where his villains are influences and his worse off than his parents."*  *"incelsior"*  *"Gerard Wayne"* fucking got me.  and Colin Farrell watching the old daredevil movie. 😂😂  If they had made a black parade joke it would have fucking sent me.
Lol 😂 he didn't call him shovelface, cause he looks awesome 🗿
This movie was... Really bad.
That movie was sooooo bad. Thank you for trashing it.
i tried to like it. I love Batman(Animated is the best then JLU, than Batman Keaton, JL, than Batman Returns) but this seemed either like a Se7en meets Saw meets a boring Netflix crime show. The ending with him and friend was one of the few interesting things.
Best Batman Film by Fucking Miles!!!!!!!
I hate you all lol 😂, keep up the good work
Honest Trailers Harley Quinn?
To answer your question. Yes to movie fights. I would like a series of honest movie fight scenes. I have sent in a preemptive like on this video to show you how serious I am about my offer.  Your move honest movie trailer guy
I unfortunately watched this movie and i will never get that time in my life back... This movie sucked!
Really? Not going to talk about the fact Batman failed at figuring out what was going on until it was too late? That he failed to fight off the lunatic followers and nearly died, needing rescuing? Or that Pattinson still whines like a teeny pinup boy? For shame Screen Junkies, you're asleep on the job. This was the worst Batman movie since Clooney!
fk sake this movie was too good
This is not a good movie.  It sets other films up, but this is too long, tries too much to relate to modern issues at times.  It is better than other Batman movies from the 90s.
"A barista's sense of flare...The Twiknight Saga"  Genius.
quality every time
That Falcone name screw up is so true
This movie was so bad. Reeves has no clue how to make a movie.
Wow that movie looks beyond terrible.
Andy Serkis deserves leading roles.
Worst batman movie I've ever watched. RP was awful
the first bad alfred ever!!!!!
Putting the goth back in to Gotham 😂😂😂
I fell asleep during this movie found it extremely boring. Not sure why Riddler is wearing a gimp suit but ok. This movie is overhyped by the people who like it pretending its the best movie ever made while most people are like "its ok".
The batman is the best movie
Am I the only one who heard the Batman Returnes theme there? They just took it for no reason...
The batman movie is one of the best batman movie ever
I was so bored during this whole movie.
I've got no desire to see this.
Alas, they didn't talk about my greatest  issues. How Batman somehow cut through two inches of active electric cable in a single swipe of the world's most stupid bat-a-rang. Or how he has high-tech contact lens cameras when all his other tech looks 20 years old.
I thought it was funny that everyone was worried that Joker would cause an incel rebellion in real life and then Riddler did exactly that in this movie.
Now that Batman has fixed Earth, time to fight space aliens.
A forgetable Batman movie with the potential of a good origin story but ended with a load of potlical correctness.
I was invested in the movie until he was in the wing suit and hit a bridge and bus at like 180km, then he fell off the bus hard onto concrete. That's the moment I tagged out and just thought, why DC why lol.
The realist Batman movie I have seen thus far... You are a joke, honestly.
Honest theme song? Really? And you want more subscribers after THAT?
You forgot the line "MARTINEZ, LET HIM THROUGH"
Considering the modern setting, there are two things we can assume about ttis version of Batman: -He listens to My Chemical Romance. Religiously. -The movie he saw in the theater with his parents was Shrek.
This has to be the most overrated Batman move yet.
* Day 33 of asking for Netflix's Daredevil Honest Trailer *
Not accepting thanks
Putting this out there: Batman of all Legacy Batman is a real secret Super Hero/Meta Human/Super Powered Human. His real super power is Indestructability.  Otherwise   scenes of him falling & hitting stuff makes zero sense. Even with his High Tech Gear Suit he should be toast. Unless he's really a secret Super Hero. My Batman Legacy Theory.
The Vig Lebowski
0:47 the next batman reboot
i am only just now realising Collin Farrel is the Penguin...holy crap hes unrecognisable!
How do you want to open this trailer? """""" IN  A WULRD!!!!
literally smokes his head on a steel beam at like 50mph
yes please to movie fights
Its a good Christian Bale Batmen show.
Lol 2nd year on the job batman
Nobody knows how Commissioner Gordon got his job.  Did he sleep his way up? did he use his vitamin C? Or did The Batman pull some strings? Because without him he is completely incompetent. The Batman solves all the cases for him. The plot is so simple even a Labrador would be able to follow it - all important plot twists are super obvious and get resolved within seconds.
LOVE the shout-out to Seattle.... well, kind of. You must live here! My only question is, WHERE's OUR BAT LIGHT?!
Gotham Police Moustache division is a good one😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What do you want from me? entertainment.
Twink-Night!!!!
pffffffffff I spewed on my monitor at the "8 Parts Seattle" gag X,D  SO Freakin' true!
Druig sucks lol i got that reference
idc what anyone says, this is my favorite Batman movie
Cliff's Notes were never more entertaining.  I knew I wouldn't like the movie, very likely wouldn't see the movie, and am now happily certain I'm making the right decision in never seeing it.  I thank you for the 3 hours of my life you've saved.  Now, back to wasting it on YouTube...
Umm can someone pls explain the druig sucks joke?
4:57 😂😂😂 Any MCR fans will understand the reference
Why can't you sing very poorly?  I'd be happy ab that
This was great. The ONLY thing missing is you saying, "He's gonna walk that off? Oh yeah, he probably doesn't have insurance."
He was a good Batman but a terrible Bruce Wayne
Totall annoying Batgirl character !
OMG this is hilarious :D :D :D :D :D: D
And how does anybody not know that the Batman is Bruce Wayne? I mean, who else could afford all that high dollar tech?
This is great stuff!!
I've been watching for like 8 years now, somehow didn't know I wasn't subscribed 0.o
Bruce is a vampire, that explains invincibility Funny, but edward ince was a vigilanity, killing maniacs and drinking their blood. Before bella. And he cought those bustards who wanted to assult bella in first movie during school trip
Alfred: be careful, my preccciiiooouuussss!
This movie is a really good one to watch but I could my time to watch it meaning I waiting to long to watch every should watch it a great batman
Overall really disappointing movie. Batman should be the most awesome character you see on the big screen. Bruce Wayne should be this role model millionaire with all the cool stuff that every teenage boy dreams about. Robert Pattinson's Bruce Wayne looks more like a homeless drug addict with failing mental health.  Overall Batman Movie should be exciting and action packed. This movie was more like Hercule' Poirot episode stretched to 3 hours with too much slow motion dialogues and staring each other. And last but not least - Batmobile should be the most impressive vehicle that a kid has ever seen. But this one was more like random old Dodge bought from Craigslist and spray painted matt black in Walmart parking lot.  I totally wasted 3 hours of my life, i could have super-cleaned my whole apartment during that time instead.
bbbbbbatman !
whats the theme song?
Gotham is based in Jersey, not New York...🤓
The Btaman, I surprised myself becoz this is the first ever boring batman that ive watched
We need the Black Adam HT ASAP
ehh...not your best Honest Trailer.  I agree with many of the things you say about this movie but it was much better than everyone has been saying and much better than I ever expected.
4:58 My Chemical Romance. Clever!
Wakanda forever honest trailers
Cat woman was not attractive both in personality and looks.
This is not a good honest trailer.
Goth back in gotham🤣🤣🤣😭
I tried watching this and could only do 20 minutes before I gave up, there is no way "this" Batman could ever take on Superman. Will never work tying this Batman with rest of DC World, bring back Affleck.
This might be one of your worst trailers.
Come on man that Daredevil movie is great.
It's one part Glasgow, Scotland too
Not Gerard Wayne lmaooo
just can't watch this movie
feel like liking this movie depends on whether you want to see action or an actual batman story. I think this is one of the best portrayals of Batman actually being the gritty detective he should be instead of beefcake punchy man in suit though there's a lot of things they could've done better, i still love it
I hated this movie. I left the theater and walked home, because my ride thought this movie was entertaining enough to sit through all 4 hours of it.
Just for that I WILL Like & Subcribe!
*DARKERRR*
they destroid batmans movies... poor chirstian bale
It was a crap film, how can you out do the Dark Knight trilogy even the Justice League films eventually turned out alot better than this version of batman it was almost like they were trying to copy  the Tim Burton Batman films but it just wasn't received well at all.
U SHOULD DO AN HONEST TRAILER ON CONGRESS
This trailer was better than the original movie        And also why he is the worst batman.
One of the worst movie ever produced and distributed. Man you went soft with this honest trailer, there was so much more to say ahah, maybe you were worried about the backlash.
You forgot to mention all the woke crap...
Cool trailer. Bad movie. Ideological push didn't help either.
Of course, a classic character is now black. Annoying. Just make a new character and try a little creativity.
Plzz do Honest trailer Cyberpunk Edgerunner
When did this movie come out ?
Just a shitty clip from a shitty channel
Druig sucks 😂
Waaait, you're telling me, this was an actual movie? Like a parody of previous Batman movies or something?
fun fact: 84% of the sentences spoken by this version's office gordon just asked obvious questions.
Was so much worse and boring than I could have expected.  Few good notes worth mentioning, mostly lackluster plot but slow plot progression.  Nothing new.
I hated The Batman.
3:09 @Screen Junkies Whats that background music?
Supercuts is a pretty place to go. They time your haircuts and rush you
And this sucked too
Epic Movie!
I was so disappointed by this movie lol.
Just another want to be, Joker will soon hang him on a building
The new batman looks horrible, even on a brand new oled
ahahahahahahahhagahaghaaahahaahahahhahahahahaha
“Oh just gonna walk it off?? Mmkkay” lol
Batman killed a ton of people in the chase scene with penguin
It sucked.
Goth back in gotham LOL
What was the nirvana sounding music you used???
I'm glad I didn't watch that movie.
not influencers, dont be disingenuous, you know thats not what they went for
Really? Not going to mention that the theme song was ripped off something over 100 years old because Gen Z don't know what Wagner is?
2 hour movie crammed into 3 hours
I think the ratio of people liking this movie and disliking this movie is seperated by about ~10 years on average.  You're either an emo environmentalist relating to the struggles of a 36 year old dude acting like a teenager mid meltdown or you're not.

1:54 instantly turned off the video and left a dislike. Don't you try to guilt me into subscribing. If I enjoy a channel's content (and you do have great content) I will like and subscribe. But try to get all judgy on me for not clicking what you want me to click and I'm just gonna get pissed. I really don't understand why so many people are trying this angle. Does that really work for you?
I didn't like it at all. Once again a stupid plot, Riddled with holes and a mandatory 'grand final' that literally came out of nowhere.   So much budget, set pieces etc. And once again it fails on the script. 4 / 10
OK, "what are you showin' me here?! Comeon!" just became a meme.
oh PLEASE - do Amazons "Rings of Power"
The Twiknight bit killed me 🤣
First footage I've seen of this movie. Looks terrible.
This is the direct result of trying to whistle with a mouth full of peanut butter & salteens...
"One part New York...eight parts Seattle". That's pretty much every blue city in America now. FJB!
Incelsior. i'm fucking dead 🤣
Loool I come here to have validation for the movies I missed on purpose and I always get it 😪 never missed ❤️
5:11. Best part.
This movie was bad.
It's "LA rata alada"!!! Fucking big production movie can't even take 5 seconds to use google translator
PLS GIVE US UMBRELLA ACADEMY
When Batman was first introduced he was not a good guy. Very dark.
Bring back movie fight
Rain.  More rain.  Still more rain.  Is this THE BATMAN, or SEVEN?
INCELSIOR!   LOOL
I thought the honest trailer sums up my feelings on The Batman.  It tries to be really dark, but it has so many silly moments that it is difficult not to laugh.
Being a diehard Batfan... Ohhhh this made me laugh. On the actual movie? When announced, I thought, AHHHFACKIT Pattinson? Really? Well, It wasn't a bad movie, and he did a fair job... I'd obviously rank it wayyyy ABOVE Batman Forever and Batman & Robin lol 😉    🦇😎🇬🇧🦇
The mustache division.
1 part ny and now 8 parts Seattle had me. Too close to home man
Guilted me into liking and subscribing
This movie is so boring even the honest trailer can’t make me laugh
2:03 :D :D :D :D :D LMAO
All the twilight fans hype up this movie... Average at best, except for the run time
Capes together strong got me bad.
All bad things cant and dont accept bad Thanks and these are not real
I do in fact want movie fights
Its not batman its phoenix jones
Bro, when he mention he can't get 10% of his viewers to subscribe it made me subscribe😂
I watched it yesterday it was a great film
“Where’s Robin?” Maybe that kid in half face makeup we see in the subway scene can have something to do.
Why are batman movies so good at always being so different none of them can work together. Like what is this newest one? Gen z batman?
Supercuts? Oh dear, ive been away far too long what mmmmm what happened to you screen junkies
Never put catwoman in anything!
well, that was a strange movie - somehow, it was not really captivating, but for nearly 3 hours it wasnt boring either.... i really would liked it in the jokerverse.... at least it was better then batman v superman.....
No, just gonna walk it off??? Mmmk.
"Capes together, strong" is not getting enough respect
This film started on the right foot, then it dragged on and trailed off into another comic adaptation ADD wash out. quite litterally!
A version of Colin Farell so gross it almost ruins his sextape 🤣
This was a terrible movie and it was equally in the script and Directing/production of the movie.
This movie was so bad
Yeah, I'll just skip this, re-watch the crow instead.
This movie sucked.
i just realized something. this batman could be a prequel to dceu batman. based on the jokers teeth. his teeth are so messed up here but in the suicide squad he has all bling2 teeth. he fixed his teeth.
The most boring batman movie ever made! I switched it off after 30 min, then I tried again, but 40min was my limit, then from some friends heard it doesn't really get better and I just left it at that...
Going the detective route just highlighted how dumb it was seeing a guy in a goofy costume looked surrounded by cops. Looked like that goofball superhero that used to run around Seattle trying to play the good guy before it was revealed he was a drug dealer lol smh
you should do "X"
say "I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with my sister."
I enjoyed this a lot more than the movie! I don't know...maybe all the hype set my expectations too high, but I finally finished watching it yesterday and was really disappointed. It had some genuinely awesome moments and some interesting ideas behind it, but for me, it amounted to one really cool half hour with two and a half hours of uninteresting filler.
Analytics.
2nd worse Batman
Pls she hulk honest trailer, by far the worst show ever existed 🍻
1:57 Not clogging up the channel with a bunch of videos other than Honest Trailers; if you *really* wanna know what I for one want from you, regarding subscribing. Sure I’m not alone on that. You could always make a second channel for the other stuff, but real talk most of us aren’t here for that and it’s why we don’t subscribe… no one wants 2 false alarm notifications for every 1 vid we’d consider watching.
This movie needed to much brain and could only be enjoyed at home.
This movie was brilliant. I loved it.
Can you guys do the Lego Batman? I know it's late, but please?
I saw u sliding that birds of flop in the "good pile".
thats not gordon
I will never watch one of your music videos. Stick to what you are good at.
Please attack on titan
The next Batman movie will just be 3 hours staring at a black screen I guess
What a shitshow movie did I lost? (Thank Jesus I did)
Gayest woke flick I've ever watched half of and thought I've seen 99% to much of... Maybe I should finish it but... my wife said she would cut off my dick if I did... So...
I didn't like the movie.  It was too long , Patterson is too emo, the end flood took away the point of it all.  I give it a 5 out of 10
Goth back in Gotham 🤣🤣🤣
Every time I thought this movie was over it just kept going
Iam surprised that he didn't mention Batman's loudest boots yet with which he can easily sneak up behind catwomen who can hear slightest of sound like a cat and ninja escape without anyone noticing.... 😂😂
This version of Batman will never have Robin, because this Batman is Robin. You cannot go more Robin than this.
If you never seen or liked Se7ven, The zodiac, and Memento, your not gonna like The Batman.
Could save half an hour if batman walks faster 😅😅
I tried to watch this, didn't make it through the first half-hour.
Worst movie ever
so the cops carry batman from the church to the precinct and nobody tried to take his mask off?
He's right about the Joker. This country is obsessed with CONSTANTLY recasting the character. 🙄
i just realised I never subscribed screen junkies till now....oops.. Now I have.
By far the most understood Batman we have gotten in live action. True Batman fans know that this film was one giant Passion project! The cinematography, score, and practical effects was some of the best I've seen in any hero film to date! The haters for this film are the same people who are ONLY entertained by awfully choreographed cgi fight scenes like in the DCEU.
Do “Nope”!
No trace of Catwoman is this honest trailer
I didn't get the hype around this one myself
This movie is so damn good. The only part I didn't like was cramming the Joker into the ending.
hope the 2nd one still happens
Shitty movie. Pattinson acting was pure Twiglight style.
And yes.. taking 30min to walk out of a dark area is ridiculous lol
If you notice in any movie that has night time scenes, it's always raining or just got done raining because the wet background reflects light. Easier to see. Old film tricks. Plus I called out him being such a "good detective" yet never figured out what a "rat with wings" is. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT'S A BAT! 😂🦇
holy god what are you showing me is the best part 😂😂😂😅🤣🤣
Incelsior - fucking brilliant
This is the most overrated POS movie, it is so damn long, I hate Forest Gimp Riddler, and we'll Nolan already gave us a grounded Batman linked to nothing else in a huge DC universe.
One of the best soundtracks in honest trailers
One of the best soundtracks in honest trailers
Gotham = Portland
Not my favourite Batman movie of all time (though still an A-rating from me!), I think we can all agree that it's definitely the best live-action film involving Batman since 2012.
This is perfect im so glad i waited to watch 🔥💯😭😭🤣💀
This was a 3 hour turd. The car was cool but that's about it.
Movie fights  ..... please
Batman's armored suit isn't supposed to be repel bullets or negate their impact velocity. He's not Superman
When they interrogated Penguin, Penguin should have been hanging upside down. That's how Batman would have actually done it.
Batman slowly walking towards a dangerous gang from a pitch black hallway is NOT a Batman entrance
ROFLMAO!!!!!!!
From vampire to batman...... the longest journey.
If you think about it, the Riddler won. He killed the ppl he wanted and flooded Gotham. Batman only saved the mayor. Just my opinion
Gerard wayne! HAHA
no
My eyes were in pain while watching this movie! fckol batman movie this was
"...Movie fights?" Yes. Yes i want movie fights back
4:11 ...those kids are white, aren't they?
Best starring ever 🎉
My God they are working hard to make Clooney and Ben Affleck look good.
Twiknight Saga - chefs kiss.
He said,  Colin Farrell watching the old dare devil movie
I’m just here because of nirvana
Forgot to mention the anti-white racism.
I...uh...um..a movie fights would he cool
Gen Z batman. These are facts.
"Collin Ferrell watching the old Dare Devil movie"
This one was not funny at all
Video Starts at 00:30
I thought you would've made a joke about how Gordon is a follower of Jesus. He says it every two minutes.
Is batman suppose to be a master investigator his first year ? lol Honest Trailers you can atleast let that slide. Experience is everything.
"Gerard Wayne"😂 "Capes together strong"🤣
At last the truckers
I was amazed to hear Nirvana during the movie. A wonderful OST
"Some brown kid playing the knock out game."
BA7MAN
Haah i got that, half seattle!😇🤣⛈🌧☂️☔
I'm the night I'm vengeance!i'm batman!
TWIKNIGHT SAGA!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
"Druig sucks" Okay that was pretty fucking good LMAO
It's like when they budget for these films they get to the end and realize they didn't leave anything for lights.
Voice guy didn’t call him shovel face 😔
Bought it, watched it... at least the first half. Couldn't see it anyway.
Please do “Gleaming the Cube”, the forgotten Christian Slater 80s skateboarder movie.
Freaking on point. 🤣 Felt like I had watched a super long parody. Every time Batman appeared on the crime scene with Gordon.. I laughed. "psychologically vulnerable and physically invincible" 🤣 Exactly~
Why gordon let batman into the crime scenes is because he's the world's greatest detective, get with it 🦇
I think this film was genius, it doesn’t glorify Batman, it shows his flaws of being a vigilante and how he could have actually helped people by being billionaire Bruce Wayne and that he has much to grow. People that didn’t like the movie are either too obsessed with action focused flicks, have low attention span or just didn’t get the point being made, although I agree some scenes felt like filler.
For the "starring" portion, you should've called Penguin "Tony Soprano", The Riddler "The Zodiac Killer" and Carmine "insert godfather quote here"
Constantine movie please
Did anyone else kinda feel bad for Alfred, after the bomb happened and he was in the hospital, he wakes up and sees Bruce sitting there. And he seems happy to see him but then Bruce goes all "why did you lie to me Alfred? I found out everything." Like no hey sorry you got injured for an attack aimed at me, I'm just gonna grill you on why you didnt tell me about my parents. Like bruh
I want a movie fight!
I love that Robert will always and forever get Twilight jokes no matter what film they do here, lol.
God I hate the movie but love the honest trailer. 😭 Impossible
Needs more darkness
Just for curiosity sake, could you do the Nick Fury TV movie with David Hasselhoff?
MOVIEFIGHTSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I loved the filmwork in this film. The chase scene with immense collateral damage, the guts to show Western audiences 10 seconds of silence...
This movie was boring. I kept shifting focus to other things. Holmes’s Badman with the Riddler was much better than this movie.
Batman’s next villain should be Logan Paul
Your comment at 2:00 about the subscribers legit made me laugh out loud. Awesome job.
This trailer is telling me too much about a movie I've already seen.
You have GOT to make an RRR Honest Trailer!!
Did he just tease me with movie fights?! Some things are sacred, epic voice guy!
Such a great and already iconic movie.
No Smeagol jokes?
I liked and subscribed just for that comment
His name is Vengeance! Honestly, who calls themselves something stupid like Batman...
Oh, and Gordon changed skin color. Must be the heat!
Good video
I’m NOT saying this is the worst Batman movie, but if a friend invited me over to watch any Batman movie I want, this would probably be my last choice.
This movie was so hilariously bad
2:10 physically invincible 🦇 😂😂.
Maybe Marvel has spoiled me, but I've completely lost interest in DC at this point. Maybe it's the way they play musical chairs with their actors, or how some movies are part of the shared universe while others aren't. I used to love the DC characters, and I still like the TV shows (mostly), but I look at the latest movies and just have no desire at all to watch them.
This movie was so good that it apparently gave everyone amnesia about the tantrums they threw when Pattinson was first cast 😂
I think it was a 2 hour story that they made into 3 hours for some reason.
You want terror stuff? Well why didn't you just say so? Let's do this!!
Honestly the weakest Batman since the batsuit nipples. There were more times someone called him a Vengeance than him doing actual vengeance. Really bad movie and I hope they won't continue this arc.
when I saw the thumbnail, i thought the video would have "stares".
3:03 This is a completely different universe, HT  Though it would be cool to pretend that this is a prequel to him joining the Justice League and all that other stuff
If i understand it correctly... This Is worst Batman ever.
The Batman is the one of the best films of 2022! The cast is amazing and what Matt Reeves accomplished was insane.
It's so MID
the only good thing about this movie was cinematography, the rest was garbage (script, casting, acting, score, plot)
Most boring batman ever made. And reason why critics love it so much? "Messages and representation" Doesn't take much to impress "critics" nowadays
Proof that this franchise should’ve stopped at the Nolan trilogy.
Incelsior! 😂  That is genius level stuff that there..
This movie had more action at madison square garden than the knicks.
I mean truly some of the most genuinely entertaining/honesy channels on YouTube about the slowly dying culture of ‘big-popularity’ movies.  Keep pushing these timeless beauties out.
DO A TRAILER FOR CONSTANTINE (2005)
Falconeee is the right pronounciation! It's the American way, just like we say Picard and not Picar and butcher any other foreign name. It's not that we're dumb, we just don't care. Yeehaw!
Do The 13th Warrior...Puhhhhhleeasssse
C'mon do Obi-Wan Kenobi!
Druig Sucks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was a pretty bad bad movie, I couldn´t finish watching it
I get even less wh anyone still watches this than what they call Star Wars and Star Trek these days.
DARKER!!
Plundercats!
So whats going to be next? A Batman? Some Batman? The Other Batman? My Batman? SMH
Movie Fights but the OG one with Andy and fun.
"He is ready to put the goth back in gotham" hahahahahaha
I would have said something along the lines of, "This is the Batman that actually loses." lol
Well well well
1 part New York and 8 parts Seattle? Some was filmed in Liverpool, Glasgow and London. So... New York? Seattle?
1:23 and 10 parts Venice.
aaaand yet another interpretation of Batman...batman just isn't that interesting...
kinda disapointed.. no word about the bad copy of the seven movie... no one remembered it?
"Gerard Wayne" is the most underrated joke in this video. It's genius.
The catwoman walking like she's a model on a runway was so weird
the ONLY batman movie i havent seem. seems i was correct to pass here.
Thank you for being merciful and warning me how horrific this movie before I wasted my money going to watch it.
This movie is fucking terrible
I fell asleep in theaters and I didn't miss much upon a second viewing.
You can sing like that it's over produced auto-tune. You should know.
"Eight parts Seattle," including one great Nirvana cameo.
Huh? No mention of Batman shooting out an entire glass ceiling on top of civilians, realistically killing more people within mere seconds than the riddlies using machine guns did?
Can we get a 3 Ninjas series Honest trailer?
To be fair,that’s how Gotham was always supposed to look like in all the other movies
this comment: 3:42 makes me feel the same way the movie did. it's an art really
He even started with a ''In a world''
1:00 d-did… did this dude just make an inadvertent MLP joke about Robert Pattinson?
What's wrong with sunlight in Gotham. shy or something?
Too bad there are no stares with twilight instrumental music...
"The Batman" movie was good .But the part of where the D.A. is the church with a bomb ,and the Riddler who looks Mega cult member  with a S & M  fetish thing  .But I were Batman put the Riddler on hold , I mean considering  how long took Batman the cell phone .And outside there was some classic  hilarious. parts in that movie .
It was okay until at the end when it became Woke…
1:04 "The Gen Z Version of Batman - his villains are influencers, he's worse of than his parents and his hometown will very soon be under water"  Can't bring yourselves to call him the Millenial-Version of Batman after all your jokes, eh Screen Junkies? 😁
How did you miss saying, "ridiculously hilarious puns like THUMB.....DRIVE" in your epic voice.
I hope the Flash ends up making him the DCEU Batman.  It makes the most sense...
This was the first Batman movie that didn’t have me rushing to see it…. Eventually saw it & … eehhh 🫤. It was ok but I ended up liking most of the other characters except the main one 🤦‍♂️
worst batman ever
Let marvel handle your movie dc . . .  The mouse can give magic to your future..
This movie was garbage. Patterson played a worse batman then Clooney
3:45 - Pretty frame
This was the worst Batman ever.  Neon Batman was better, he never left his batcave without his VISA batcard.
"Dear diary, I have utterly failed to stop any bad thing from happening ever since the Riddler first manifested himself. He played me like a fiddle and got pretty much everything he wanted. I stopped his goons not thanks to my detective skills, but thanks to my fists, because I'm simply better at punching things than solving crimes, and Riddler himself only got arrested because he wanted to; had he decided otherwise, he'd be in Hawaii by now. Almost every single person he wanted dead is dead, and the last one survived only because the shooter fortunately missed his shot. It goes without saying that I did nothing to stop the flooding that killed dozens more people, and I was left to pick up the pieces left after his rampage. I did lead a few people to safety, which I guess doesn't look so bad on my resume. It made me feel like a guy rescuing people from the rubble of a building and looking like a savior, while making everyone forget that my initial job was to disarm the bomb that ended up destroying said building. I think I'll just pretend that I've found a higher purpose and that I can be a symbol of hope, to help rebuild what has been destroyed or whatever. That way, whenever I fail at stopping bad things, which I feel will be often, I'll have a way of acting like I'm still useful." -Bruce Wayne, November the 6th.
Can y’all bring back movie fights
The Daredevil reference 😈
Twiknight saga😂
Still angry that you didn't made a joke about the millionth time villains gets himself captured and his followers do the bad work
Gerard Wayne took me out XD bet he listens this is how i disappear in the Batmobile
4:15 the one brown person there is the only one to not get hit once lol
The missed opportunity to say starring Johnny Lawrence and gang for the guys in the subway
Honestly it was a boring film
1:18 oh crap it’s all of us Gen Z right there!
2:07 That probably should’ve killed him.
This was such a boring movie.
You guys used to burn movies for their flaws, now you don’t even defrost them.
The Vig Lebowski 🤣
Ngl…”the twinight saga” was really clever
This was the first Batman that clearly sucked at being Batman. Like there were literally moments where I was like "maybe you should let the cops handle this......!?!"
Batman and Alfred: "what is La Rata Alada??"  me, being a native Spanish speaker: "oh, for the love of god"
We can send a man to the moon, but we can't make a good batman movie...   sigh...
I honestly thought you were going to say ''Starring Shovel Face" 😆
A really good Batman movie which was necessary because bit was a really long Batman movie yet the honest trailer was so short for this hahahah
No joke about the fact that despite Batman being unstoppable and invincible, he takes a 1-5 score at the end of the day against the Riddler? The only thing he stopped Riddler from doing was kill Bruce Wayne, and that was by accident!
Martinez is indeed THE homie
I like The Batman
Remember when Patinson said he wasn't going to get superhero swol for Batman and everyone freaked out because Batman can't be slim cut? 🤣
The sick himalayan regretfully poke because acoustic effectively reign to a divergent leaf. lovely, amazing icebreaker
Nothing about how the 6 foot 150 lb Riddler was able to overpower all his victims?  He had followers but the crime scenes usually suggested he was alone.
No Riddler is not dress up like a garbage bag the new look for the Riddler in this movie looks really good please don't ruin this movie and I have not seen it yet
I can sing like that if you want no seriously I like Batman
This video has made me laugh
This movie was meh....
Fight scene long non shaky takes were very pleasant
And a really really really boring Batman movie
Yes to movie fights
Didn't quite like this movie; It's kinda hard to put my finger on why, it just,  didn't work for me.
Yeah the lack of lighting in this movie was a bit excessive to say the least! Could barely see the damn thing
do Dr strange 2 honest trailer..👍🏻😂
I’ve come to realize this movie isn’t that great...
I'm still trying to figure out how "la rata helada" means rat with wings. Doesn't that mean cold rat?
INCELSIOR💀
Batman's Gotham will soon turn into Atlantis 🌝💜✌️
Missed the perfect opportunity to use "Starring: Something in the Wayne"
Felt like a discount Dark Knight to me; lackluster hero, villain, and everything. Direct to video quality compared to the Dark Knight.
“It’s a Tucker....a Mother-Tucker”....
4:07 is absolutely brilliant lmao
I'm gonna make a bold statement and say "this is my favorite Batman movie"
Loved the movie. It felt like a modernization of the Keaton films
Shitty movie, with a winy Batman.
2:57 what is the song in the background? it slaps tbh 😳
Gen z batman.  Summed up perfectly
But honestly, this was probably the best Batman movie to ever be created. Maybe even better than the dark knight. I just hope that they don't cram the Joker into it or merge it with the Justice League. I don't even really want to see the Robin in this rendition.
Do “minions 2!!”
Can't be bothered to watch any Batman movie anymore. It gets so dark (quite literally), I'd need a flashlight to watch it. Thanks for the breakdown
Still waiting for the butler to start singing from is Mix Tape... "what is LOVE!!! baby dont hurt"
This is simultaneously the most and least Batman movie EVER.  *I love it!*
And here I was waiting for  *"STARES"*
First review of The Batman where they didn't mention Gordon being black.
Do Interceptor, please! It was so bad🤣
“2 part New York and 8 part Seattle” can relate to Seattle part used to live there
10% of 2 million views is pretty damn good. I’d be hella happy with 10% of the 10% you get! Folks that want music to not make you think wouldn’t like it but hey, you can’t really be a fan of comics and make music that doesn’t make you think.
i would subcribe if this channel only done honest trailers ...hint hint pitch meeting
Wait, where is the n, it's The Twink Knight Saga!
Are you the same dude that does AniRecaps?
can't believe they didn't use the "bomb exploding right in his face but literally" at 2:05  it was right there xD
Bring us firefly!!!!
4:51 isn't Joker in Snyder-edition his idea? Wasn't he given liberty to do what he wants? And Joker movie and Joker in Lego Batman were great
1:56 do proper videos, stop nitpicking, esp. Marvel, don't put that song... E.g. this video seems to be a good criticism and almost no nitpicking
Song was awful
Do the Dune.
it is hilarious watching all the reaction channels to this movie, having to pretend it is awesome and legitimate and not pretentious ...just to keep appeasing their audiences
I really think there gonna do a three jokers Batman sitting in the mobies chair scene which might be hype or really stupid
Hang on, 1 part New York 8 parts Seattle. Don't forget 2 parts Liverpool
Quem aguenta filme de BATMAN ! CHEGAAAA
I came here hoping for a “Robert the Bruce” Pattinson/Wayne joke. I left disappointed.
this was good but the honest theme song was better ironically enough
The twinghit saga
I'm so sick of this batman  Next movie should make him super wholesome and sweet With everyone even the villains, while he beat them half to death and break they're bones
I was surprised you didn't mention the creepy scene bruce watched catwoman change clothes and how they never got a room together haha.
Watched this recently. I was not impressed.
These videos feel more like spoilers than ironical trailers.
I just noticed the Zoolander reference. 4:20 Classic!
One of the worst batman 😂
this was so bad I walked out on it.
This movie was so god awful, I wish you did it from a comic book fan part of you. This movie was so bad.
I’ve seen better film on teeth
I don't agree with this movie's positive reviews. I think this honest trailer is too dang accurate! I hope this channel gets an Emmy someday.
BOOO!!!!! We don't need edgy Emo Batman. The Nolan trilogy is the best we are going to have.
This was the first Batman movie that actually bored me so much
I think the director of this movie is what would happen if Alfred Hitchcock and a 13 year old goth girl got fused in a transporter accident.
Supercuts ladies could never get my haircut right
I'm really looking forward to the sequels. I feel the Gotham lore is a lot more fleshed out in this movie than any other batman. It's clear this Batman is still figuring out things, hence why he makes a lot of mistakes and was quite clumsy throughout the show. He acted more like Robin than Batman, but I'm sure in the sequels he will become the mature and cool Batman we all love.
Honest Trailer really holds back on fan favorites. They're not that honest anymore I feel.
He's the God damn Batman! You pigs
After you were forced to watch twilight saga, you just can’t find anything you don’t like in this Batman movie
I fell asleep at the theatre. This was way too long and boring.
THE RUM DIARY, THE RUM DIARY, THE RUM DIARY. Please do THE RUM DIARY!
This is the 2nd movie where they featured white people playing the knockout game while there are no movies featuring the actual group of people who play the knockout game. Some appropriations are ok I guess.
The most unrealistic thing about this movie was how Gotham wasn't already flooded before the ending with all that damn rain.
Ok, fair enough, you got my subscribe.
Do a sonic the hedgehog 2
This is the best Batman Movie since Batman Returns, Batman Return of the Joker and Batman Mask of the Phantasm.
i literally just got done watching this movie and i immediately thought "Seriously? ANOTHER rebooted joker?"
I thought you're gonna make fun of the stares! 😂😂😂
Honestly thought you said "James Corden" for a moment and was VERY confused!
If Reeves is unwilling to depict the murder of the Waynes, maybe they can get another director to do it. They should ask Tim Burton. Or Christopher Nolan. Or Zack Snyder. Or maybe even Todd Phillips. That would be crazy, right? Downright mad.  Wait.....
You guys should do the Lego Batman Movie to finish the theatrical Batman films.
This film was so overrated
honestly, I enjoyed my 3 hours in theater while my bf went to the toilet twice😂
Didn't call Robert Pattinson Shovel Face??:(
“Gerard Wayne” is the most perfect nickname possible for this Batman
'Gerard wayne' good one
En español no hay :c
i think the riddler would be better to be called the zodiac Riddler
“DARKER” got me lmfao
I really tried with this movie but it was a big floppy turd.
Didn't like this movie at all, they had no reason to make it imo
"The World's not quite Greatest Detective".🤣
Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie: “Holy God, what are you showing me here?! C’mon!” That got me
Bruh, they really really nerfed riddler, didnt they? Or just made him way worse? Idk
One comment on this movie: worn out. Same old stuff, scrubbed and polished until it just lost its shine, but I'm sure the next reboot will be the charm. Also: the pronunciation of the name Carmine...? I''m Italian, yes, but I'm not asking for perfection, at least try!
This video sucked
Only Batman movie that I fell asleep on...
"A city that is 1 part New York, and now 8 parts Seattle"  Bro...  I'm dying. I lived in and around Seattle for like 12 years, and it's the first thing I thought of when I saw all the rain.
He is ready to put the goth back in Gotham 😂😂
lmk ur gonna simp for this movie
Think the best alternate title for this movie would be The Darker Knight
The twilight saga
hi
Really? You didn't even acknowledge that EVERY villain in this movie was a white male. More like "The Batman Goes Woke and Attends a Diversity Training".
I didn't know Colin Farrell was in the movie until I saw this trailer.
This movie was overrated
“Put the final stake in his twilight sparkle”. This to me felt like if Edward was Batman. Like, literally the exact same performance. It felt like he revived his twilight sparkle lol
The Batman is so boring AF!
For my gaming group, please say "Previously on Mission Unnatural"
" some brown teenagers" ? i didnt get that one.
“Druig sucks” lol
The movie was kinda racist tbh
That’s interesting! Shall we be friends?
This movie sucked in slow motion.
Next please do love, death and robots and I want a shout out
more murders would be cool
3 hours of watching the movie and didn't realize Colin Farrell was in it until I saw the credits.
Immensely boring movie
Oooh you missed the opportunity of include in the starting section “…and Jesus!” And throw all the times they say  “Jesus” in the movie 😂😂😂😂
"The Twiknight Saga"  LOOOOOL XD
This movie is so bad I couldn't even get through the honest trailer. Peace!
This episode is presented by "SUPERCODS"
Capes together, strong!
The Twiknight Saga. You had me there! 😂
2:59 😅🤣😅😂😂
Did they really try to downplay the knockout game because a few of the gang members were brown?! 🤣
Sad you didn't make thing about Gordon always whispering, and a collage of Batman love getting shot at
Yes...pleeeeeease bring back Movie Fights!!!!!!
This film was so good it was hard for them to make fun of it! Still a great Honest Trailer. "That's just a black screen." lol
Long boring movie. Silly take on Riddler. Terrible casting for most of the cast.
That movie was just amazing
5:13 this scene has a meme potential lol 😂
Isn’t it Fal Kow Nee because its Italian if it were American it would be Fal cone
No one wants movie fights
when did this show become a big advertisement more they're other stuff?
“Druig sucks” I stan with you screen junkies
The Twiknight saga got me creasing up🤣
There was not a single "daytime" in the whole movie
Not sure if I'm impressed or disappointed that you made zero Crow jokes here.
Do Supernatural
Worst batman ever 🤦 movie is too long, too boring, not even close to what the comics were. They just used the lamest vampire movie actor, put on a mask, and add the worst scrip... sold. So many wrong things that this should never be talked about 🤣😂 finally, we got the bad movie on Batman franchise. Epic fail achievement unlocked 👍
Movie sucked, period
DOOOO SUITSSSS PRETTY PLEASEE
Torturo did a nice Pacino, and Ferrell did a nice De Niro.
"Druig sucks" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ngl i actually really liked it
Kate and Leopold
That Gerard Way reference gives me life
What?  No "Shovel Face"?  No STARES? I mean this long piece of crap had a lot of STARES
I didn't care about this movie.  It just wasn't important to me at all.
Robert Patterson can't act
This fucking movie was an insult to Batman.
One one noticed nirvana was playing in the background most of the trailer 😂
@some brown teenagers - that sounds kinda racist to me.
i lost it when y'all called bruce "gerard wayne" lmaoooo 😭
Still a better love story than Twilight
.I HATE it!  D.C. Just can't get a good script, or a good Director, and keep things Consistent, they also Can't seem to get the characters right.  Can anyone say "Marvel Envy"?  lol
I immediately cracked up on the first scene... Dark... Darker... Darker.. That's just black screen... There! 😂 😂 😂
The TwiKnight Saga.  Lol.
This movie sucked
I like how, in the comments section, "different" fake YouTube accounts parrot the exact same PR department-written "comments" verbatim....
"There we go. Noice"  gets me all the time
I found myself sleeping 30 mins in the movie o.o
Can we get an honest trailer for The Nice Guys
Seriously, guys, not even an honest trailer for Matilda?
4:58 ahh I see what you did there
Can you make a video about the Chinese TV show 笑傲江湖 2001 version directed by 张纪中 ，it's so epic！
That Kiss From A Bat(man) song is actually pretty good.
man when you said you can't get people to like and subscribe I changed my like to a dislike
Do “Everything, Everywhere, all at Once”. I dare you
Andy Serkis: every solution to every world-crushing problem EVER!!
'He's ready to put the "Goth" back in Gotham, a city that is one part New York & one part Seattle' - gold!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG !! Druig Su*ks part really got me !!! 😆😆
So...is it worth the watch or not?
Long and boring.  Horrible detective.
Great movie absolutely loved it! If you fell asleep on this one that's a you issue....
The TwiKNIGHT saga. I'm dead! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Also do honest trailers on halo reach the series paramount studio + next.
Christian bale is a better Batman.
toppp
The movie was ok. I didn't care much for it. It's like an emo Batman
This is definitely a hit or miss movie for people. I thought it was boring and didn't want another 2 hours and walked out. My friends all really like it to love it. He didn't solve anything and was a dick to everyone. LOL. To each their own!
nobody gonna mention how they walk like GTA prostitutes ? great comedy this movie . what a joke
"The looting of the Wayne charity foundation could have been stopped had Bruce shown up to his day job"  *False* The looting started when he was a child and the Wayne funds were still under the hands of his legal trustees (Not Alfred but the Wayne company heads)
Best movie ever
"His hometown would be underwater" - took me a second to understand that one
Colin Ferrell?
Why the actors from THE PURGE films in this?
All those other clips pronounced "Falcone" correctly, though.
I almost want to subscribe haha 😆 your good bro
Amazing and very hilarious 😂 titles can’t stop laughing at it.
"Capes together strong" 🤣
the most real dumb batman movie ever.. super real.. suepr dark.. and then 4 car bombs.. floods a city the size of new york/ no dam protextion, no flood protection. and people all go to the garden which holds 20k people.. in a city of 10m.. this is the dumbest 5hit ever
3:19 So you know Cussing with God is taking his name in vain.
Bi-motorcycle burglar? There was nothing to suggest she was more than friends with Annika Koslov, right? Am I missing something?
Eh.. it still won't link with anything else and with the track record of all the other films we will get a Joker second (Which I'm personally sick of.) and then a bleh third movie. Before they start over again because WB.
bring back movie fights and dont just get beat down by dan murrel
2:23 Ty alfred!
What's the song they always use at the end of the trailer?
(Colin Farrell watching the old daredevil movie) I couldn't handle it!! best part !!!
they even had their own Nirvana soundtrack
I was hoping you would mention the moment Batman took a bomb to the face.
PLEASE DO DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS AND CALL IT “COSMOS AND WANDA”!
Can't wait for the extended version!....He'll actually use some Bat gadgets! HAHAHA
Thanks for always making me laugh! Could you do an honest trailer for Everything Everywhere All At Once? Thank you!!
"The" makes it better
This one is not one of Screen Junkies best Honest Trailers. I usually love these.
This movie was boring and terrible!
I loved it, my fav live action Batman that really acknowledges how weird, creepy, and unhelpful Batman can be. 🤷🏽‍♀️ He's just a white guy punching people. Riddler was just a white guy who Nazis and school shooters admired. Catwoman was hot and sneaky and sexually ambiguous while also being psychologically broken. It's amazing and looked amazing and SO MANY PEOPLE DIED and they're like "damn... anyway" and it's amazing.
wait, batman stole Asami's glove?
4:11 problem is, if he doesn't maintain control over the company, he loses the money to fund his crusade, somebody might accidentally stomp on his money deviation... I'm all for characters who close themselves off from others, but come on ! Bruce is a professional ! While he does close himself off, he still has enough discipline to appear just the enough ammount of times to make sure his company is under control !
Robert looks more like joker than batman
No mention of the Nostalgia Critic thug in the "Starring" segment?  Down Vote!
Thank you for mentioning the inconsistency in the Falcone pronunciation. I was afraid I was the only one who noticed it.
The biggest "meh" batman movie ever
"What do you want from me? Murders? Riddles?" Well, that would take the channel in an unsuspected direction. Could be interesting.
The Batman is so bored that even the honest trailer of The Batman also bored
druig does suck  great callback
Nah, your voice is already EPIC enough without singing.
Batman does not use super cuts 😂😆
The Batman was epicly awesome! Felt like the comics ! 💯💪🏻
This just didn’t work. The Batman was just too good.
i like this movie, for 3 reasons. 1st people are very greedy and corrupt, kind of reminding me of the previous goverment i have in my country. 2nd - sometimes you need to put justicein ur hands. 3rd it reveals a lot of human nature. maybe not all people may like this, because its kind of complicated unlike those marvel movie that comes the good guy then bad guy arrives then battle then good guy saves the day. very predictable. this one let me ask myself how could i use my power if i am in that position? thats all
PLUNDERCATS HO🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀
Did you see the behind the scenes of that wingsuit clip?
Movie fights
WE WANT MOVIE FIGHT - VENGEANCE
did anyone else think after hearing the riddler's backstory and seeing his followers think they were the other orphans?
GREAT CAR CHASE SCENE
You already have the Epic voice, Trailer guy. Don't be selfish.
Men this movie sucked Hollywood just gave up on doing good movies this days
Wat was the hype was all about??i thought this was a masterpiece before actually watching to find its a very average movie with some annoying things actually
Worse Batman EVERRRRRRR
Some great lines in this trailer, but I can’t believe they didn’t address Paul Dano’s acting in the final act.   The main reason I didn’t go back for a second viewing.
Not the Batman Z needed, but the Batman Z deserved.
PLEASE DO DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS AND CALL IT “COSMOS AND WANDA”!
Man, Starring part did lack of parodying Something In The Way
DARKER!!!!!
Going to use the power of my dollar and not by
Not even one shovelface joke? Come on screen junkies.
I like that film a lot more than I thought I would. I watched it on HBO Max. They’ve got some good stuff on that.   Great Stuff!
Thumbs down for no shovel-face reference.  Also good god is grunge coming back?  🤦‍♂️
There was a missed opportunity to compare it with Max Payne.
please, please, please make a Wheel of Time Honest Trailer!!!!...Or does Jeff Bezos scare you guys that much🤨🤨🤨????.
Best Batman movie yet
"....the first batman that is both psychologically vulnerable and physically invincible." Ya that was really weird. I felt like they really nailed just how weird and creepy Batman could be but then he takes a fucking explosion to the face and is completely fine....ok movie.
El ratata, one of the dumbest scenes in a movie i have ever seen
'Capes together strong', best starring ever
What was Catwoman's mother's name??
I will take movie fight
Lmaoo I thought it said Twinknight
One of the recent videos was about Roland Emmerich's Moonfall. I still wait Honest Trailer video about Roland Emmerich's 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow. I want to finally watch it ASAP.
PLUNDERCATS HO!
Wow, you guys have lost your touch
do moribius
I tried to think of something witty relating VelociPastor to Kiss from a Rose. I couldn't. Please do it anyway.
Do moon knight
I’m surprised you didn’t mention the police captain’s voice
Do for sonic the hedgehog 2
Such a true trailer for a poor, boring movie, my opinion I know!!!  Inject the joker into everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do a trailer for The Bad Guys!
Please. Do. The. The Thing 1982 film. And. The. The Thing 2011 film.
My cousin is somehow convinced this is an awesome movie that beats all recent super hero movies, she even went to see it twice at the theater.
Thanks to this channel I know what hapoens in Movies I will never watch =)
so glad I didn't waste time or money on this movie like I did for Doctor Strange 2.
Colin Farrell's Bullseye was spot on.
Didn't realize the movie was actually set in fairly modern times.
Incelsior!!
But wasn't that Two Face not the Joker?
Please do an honest trailer for My little pony the next generation!
Do the PEACEMAKER honest trailer!!
Please do an honest trailer for Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.
Worst batman ever.
Do Moon Knight 😍🌙
good one
it's absolutly forgetable. there is nothing batman like about it. one could replace batman with any anti-hero, down on his luck, f***ed up officer or suspended cop and it would... actually it would work much better.
PlunderCats 😂😂😂
please say ¨A WOODEN GUN!!!¨
This movie sucked
4:35 don't care, that was a great entrance.
You missed the part about how it was 3 hours of whispering. That got old. Also, the M Knight Shyamalan style plot twist at the end…. Yikes.
I loved this movie, but this was pretty great. Mustache division! Hahaha
gerard wayne.... I just fucking died and rebirth right now!
DC GOT NEXT!!!!! I WAS WAITING ON THIS DAY TO COME!
The thing that pissed me off the most was batman walking into places. Like wtf?
DO DR STRANGE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS
I HATE THIS MOVIE !!!  The hate came after I heard somebody say that "this is the best Batman movie" .
Starring:Gerard Wayne from My Chemical Romance....
WE WANT MOVIE FIGHTS!!
Everyone says this was so good it sucked and was boring asf and none of it made sense
*Batman Returns* -Darker than that *The Dark Knight Trilogy* -Even Darker *Batman (DCEU)* -Darker [with Batman voice] *Black Screen* -That's just a black screen *THE BATMAN*
Can you do a honest trailer for Doctor strange 2, 🙏🏾
Colin Ferrel watching the old DareDevil movies was the best part.
The Batman was better than the last movies. But not even close to the Nolans or the Burton Batmans
Do a doctor strange 2 honest trailer
"The Twiknight Saga"  That's perfect!
You forgot really really ridicously bad ...
Movie Fights is the whole reason I subscribed to this channel....so yeah, I do want that. Also, man, I hated this movie.
4:24 Am I the only one who noticed the Omega symbol? Foreshadowing maybe?
“Ridiculously long movie”
You're supposed to pronounce the e in Falcone
Gotham had always been rainy
Edward… Robert couldn’t leave his vampire title then..
I dislike this
Oh man, this must be really bad, why they dont make a movie for the corps!
That batman movie was awful....
Had you taken away Batman, Gordon would have been the main character. Barely any action. More like a crime thriller. Patenson was to stiff for the action scenes and no final boss fight lmao.
ngl, the supercut dr weird ad is good
God this movie was so bad
Do Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness!!!
I just got a supercuts ad before the supercuts ad
the goth back in Gotham lol
Again he should be Nightwing, can't even prevent disaster a batman who can't answer a riddle
I honestly didn’t like the movie 🤷🏼‍♂️
I hope they don't force this batman to a new justice league reboot. Watching this movie reminded me a lot of the arkham games. It shows batman's detective side. The somewhat "boring" scenes also reminded me of the game where you just stood there thinking what's your next move. I'm convinced the people behind the direction of this movie played the games because arkham knight alone was a really beautiful game.
Um.. only the bat is the rat with wings, the rest are snakes with feathers.
Get some movie fights back and going.
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness please.
“Some brown teenagers are playing the  KO game”
Woahhh that theme song with the Kiss From a Rose vibes…pretty legit
The goth in Gotham 😭
I like your videos that’s why I’m subscribed to you
Song from 2:58?
Good looking? Like what are you looking at in any given frame? Most of the film felt like I had bad eyesight, and my periphery was replaced by blurry, brown, tunnel vision. I feel like the cinematographer failed a film class or two.
you also didnt mention how batman had no effect on the story and he hardly did anything
man..... i really wanted to LOVE this movie and for a bit i thought i was going to. there was stuff i REALLY liked but then when it was revealed the riddler had a bunch of incel fanboys and was an influencer i was left simultaneously cackling and crying.
I lost it at "Druig Sucks" 🤣🤣
Yes, we would like Movie Fights...
Dumbest batman ever, yes that includes lego batman... He cant even figure out what is a rat with wings.
not your best work, but 5:10 was hilarious
Say "I love you in every dimension".
what an abortion of a movie best thing abou it....the trailer
do the northman
Yes, we want the original movie mights format at about 1hr 20 min runtime.  For me that was the prime.  They slowly got more convoluted and long.
If you really want my likes, you gotta give me all three of the above.
Just my opinion. I felt this movie was in slow motion all the way through. Watching the fights, I felt like I could beat up this Batman and I’m not a fighter. The part where he shows off his chicken wing shoulder bones made me laugh though. I’m sure I would of enjoyed it a little more if condensed to a 22 minute episode. But I’m just one opinion.
Yes, this movie sucked.  The only plot thread which interested me - Bruce Wayne going broke - was left unresolved to my knowledge.  But then again,  I really wasn't paying attention anymore by the end of the movie.
Please do MOON KNIGHT!!! 🌙
Thing is I just don't like Robert Pattinson so I doubt I will ever watch this movie. Never watched the Twilight movies either but that's because I don't care for Vampire lore. Don't mind Werewolves just don't like Vampires.
This movie was absolutely awful.
I haven’t even seen it yet, but idc it’s still funny haha
Gerard Wayne, The Bat Parade.
ChaANGE!! We'LL gIVe THem a ReAaLLL ReALL ChAnGE noWw!!!!
Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie... that was genius. 🤣
Yes Movie Fights, always Movie Fights.
Thank you so much for your work please do a Honest trailer for Doctor Strange In The MOM
Like the movie this trailer was way too long
DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE DO THE OFFICE
What happened to screen junkies?  You used to be great.
This was hilarious, but far too kind. The Batman was fucking garbage.
do the sopranos
You may not sing like that but... It's THE WAY YOU TALK.
This batman made Ben afflecks batman an ok experience… and that movie SUCKED
Is it wrong that I think Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne looks deathly sick bc he’s so pale? Like in some scenes he looks like he’s gonna croak any second-
GERARD WAYNE 😂😂😂 WE'LL CARRY ON
Please do band of brothers.
God I hated this Batman so much.
I don’t like it and I wanted to. I think people lie to themselves when they say they likes this movie.
Hey! Do an honest trailer for Moon Knight! Don’t be an apple!
It’s time for the Dr Strange Trailer  Also the Dr Strange theme song  Say “Abracadabra, you are not the father”
Supercuts really is good.  I have a custom haircut and they do it perfectly every time.  Also great honest trailer
I feel so vindicated, I told everyone he's the worst detective yet.
say gif
Please do an honest trailer for Moon Knight!!!
Do an honest trailer for The Boys Season 2 before Season 3 comes out
Will you please do the silent hill movies already
Best thing about the characterization of Batman in this movie is that you can always hear those damn heavy boots and they made sure to have other characters react to it throughout the movie.
hahahah ... his ennemies are influencers made me cry ahahahahahaha !!! Dark Sasuke kikoulol version of Batman ! ahahaha
Remember when they did the honest trailer for the entire Harry Potter saga in under 5 minutes? Now almost every one of these is over 6 minutes long.
I found the movie was super boring
I fell asleep like four times during this movie. Never saw that falling onto the street scene.
You have to Yellowstone... unless you're scared of cowboys from Montana?
10% of "us" is 6 million people...
2:08 Cue the Jackass theme 😏
Gerard Wayne lol
Ready to put the Goth back in Gotham 😂 Brilliant
Still was a very mid BATMAN
HOW IS THIS BATMAN POOR
I wanna see an arkham style poison ivy in this universe. If they add horror elements kinda like they did with the riddler it could be amazing
The Zoolander reference was really on point.
This was not a good Batman movie at all
mustache division had me dead.
The film is a 8/10, They made a 3 hour movie feel like a 2 hour movie. That is how good it is.
Please do multiverse of madness soon
Gen z batman...looks terrible. Too long and emo for me to bother.
Why didn't you comment that the soundtrack is a ripoff from Starwars: Empire March?
Gerard Wayne has me wheezing 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
There it is - “Mustache Division”.  🤣😂
Funny vid and I totally understand why some people don't like it but for people like me who probably read all the Stories this movie was based off it was 10/10.
Please do Timecop
Why the hell cant we get gotham city like its supposed to be? I mean, burton got it right, right? I dont want batman to be in new york...
This film was way too beautiful and too well executed to parody.  All these jokes were reaching too hard and they fell flat.  This was probably the worst Honest Trailer I have ever seen.  I didn't laugh once.  You're usually on point, but there is nothing to ridicule here.  The Batman is nearly flawless.
Watched it once and fell Asleep.... Tried to watch it a second time, and found myself snoring Again....!!!!!
The best Batman yet. Felt really like home.
This movie was wayyy too long
I like the not-nirvana you have in the background. Who played it?
No mention of the ridiculous and overused "white privilege" line by Catwoman? Doesn't seem very Honest to leave that out
Patterson carried this movie. Made it watchable despite the woke cra0
do MoonKnight next pls
Anyone else feel like this film was about twenty minutes too long?
Gerard Wayne💀
its great. thats all ya gotta say lol
The editing on this is incredible
This is MY Batman!
I want movie fightsS!
“Colin Farrell watching the old daredevil movie” 😂😂😂
Dude, say whatever you want but Penguin was great.
a 6 minute trailer?  imagine  Yikes!
Why wont you do money heist?
It’s a good movie I just wish he wasn’t so emo
Dang, was hoping for bat-stares montage. Great ep regardless!
Lame
CApes together strong hahahaha
Do the Depp v Heard trailer!
2010's: drop the 'the' 2020's: add the 'the'
😆
Not riddler doing the joker dance🤣🤣😭😭
The honest trailer was way better than the movie
"That is part nyc and part seattle" ohhh you mean because of all the rampant unpunished crime that's almost engulfing the city? Pretty on point lol  Also "some brown teenagers playing the knockout game" in a grimy part of town, welllllllll, statistically it'd be weird if they were all asian and french lmao......
Gerard Wayne, I'm dying!
I saw The Batman tonight Wow! I was surprised how good it is Pattinson is a great Batman The Riddler was Insane...and yet cool Great movie
They're still doing these Honest Trailers?
DO EUPHORIA!!
Supercuts?         That's just sad..............
Emo Batman
He really looks unrecognizable with his Batman mask on and off.
That Gerard Wayne got me good, rofl
You left out, "Starring Zoe Kravitz, the "Zendaya" to Robert Pattinson's "Tom Holland." Because that's what every movie has to be right now."
When is someone gonna tell the Batman story???? Or, come on people, Spiderman has been SO ignored!!!
"How come only 10% of you like and subscribe?"  I dunno. Maybe it's just not "every week" content. I click one of these in the "related videos" once every few months, maybe, and that's only if I can't find anything else of immediate interest... I think the dorky movie announcer voice you do wears thin after you've heard it once, twice at best... a lot of the jokes are weak, and the ones that aren't are ripped off of Pitch Meetings ("darker... that's just a black screen," for example). I think you kinda phone these in, and even if you worked harder on them, I don't know who would really want to see one every day or even regularly. I mean, since you asked : )  10 percent seems about right... 10 percent of YouTube kids will gush and obsess about anything related to superhero movies. Might have to step your game up to get anything beyond that.
Maybe if you get bored, you can give “Grease” an honest trailer. It didn’t age well.
I feel like looking at it now
This was perfection. Awesome.
Why gerard?
I still don’t know how I feel about this movie. Some aspects were the best I’ve seen for a Batman movie. But it also felt like a chore to watch and I just didn’t care much. Like, I appreciate skipping some of the origin story. We all know it. But then because it was skipped, I’m not really invested. And it had a real gritty feel, but was also literally too dark ha.   I thought Falcone, the penguin, cat woman, and Harvey were incredible though even if the last one’s character was a bit nonsensical at times.
this movie was good, but not great. the riddler was perfect...but Batman didn't feel like batman. seemed like it was some amateur in a costume fighting, not an elite league of shadows ninja
Do Freddy Got Fingered.
Do tomorrowland 2015 honest  trailer
One part New York and 8 parts Seattle 😂😂😂
I’m lost, why in 5:23 it says ‘Druig sucks’?
I tried to watch this movie, but it was too bad woke for me.
Actually Falcone is pronounced like with e
This movie was so baddddd.
Global warming joke? Lame
This was a great movie
"He's worse off than his parents" heh
My sister gave up on this movie halfway through. But that's when the movie got much better. Bad timing.
This has provided me with a different indifferent perspective of the film! Thank u Honest Trailers, because I am getting tired of seeing the Joker despite how much could be still be drained from him in live action.
i thought that was Hush, oh wait they're the same right? 🤣
"Capes together strong" 😂😂🤣🤣
Do Moon Knight!
Epic  voice  you failed at life
I’m looking forward to seeing this Batman grow.
The Movie Fights reference 😅😅😂
I only watched for Robert but goddamn the movie was awful 😕
Not trying to hate but Zoe kravitz and Robert had no chemistry
Can you do Secrets of Sulphur Springs????
I like how the cop guy yelling at Gordon sounded like Joe Pesci. 😅
Do an honest trailer for Moon Knight
This movie sucked
Plundercats ho! Is gold lol.
you didn't even give me a riddle but i did sub
It's a bad movie for the right reasons, but a good Batman movie for the wrong reasons.
Damn, that's the first Bat movie I aint gonna watch, that's for sure.
anyone got the titles of the background music?
“The Twiknight Saga”
I don’t know if I have ever disagreed with the analysis of this channel. If so, I could count it on one hand.
1st they ruined spider man and now batman ....
I haven't watched this yet because it's four hours long.  Four hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTF!!?  I can see for dragging tongue across some female's "browneye" and eating some "kuchie" for four hours but watching a movie....   "Geezus" "Kryst!"
Do Sonic the hedgehog 2
"Capes together strong" tf 😂
this was one borrring movie! a soap opra story and some childish riddles. RIP
Did anyone else get a supercut ad before the video?
I went and saw it a second time in theaters just for the Batmobile scene. That into and then the car chase. Absolute magic. You felt that car, it was incredible.
Do Moon Knight pleasee
Bro I got a supercut ad right before this. Haha nice.
Not a big fan of this version of batman
Terrible film, they had the opportunity to explore Bruce Wayne sexuality and bring a strong LGBT representation into the film. Failure
This movie sucked
Please Say: "Bwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Bwa Bwa Bwaaam"
I'm glad someone mentioned how poorly lit this movie was... 2 hours in, I had a better chance of tasting the movie than I did of seeing it.
Your standard Influencer: a serial killer that’s smarter than he is. “Brown Teenagers” was so risky I actually laughed my drink out my mouth
Druig sucks!
the more i watch this movie the more dissatisfied I am.
darker... Darker... DARKER LOL
Wonder Woman, Dr Strange, Spiderman, movies suck now, seems like they're making movies BASED on OTHER movies
So many people forget that this isnt Batman in his prime, he should be making mistakes, its a learning process. The movie is an absolute work of art and the plot is, even if you dont like it, so meticulously made that every single detail counts and works so well with the story and character arc.
You RIP OFF pitch meetings SO HARD.
i forgot this channel exiusted
Do an Honest Trailer for Dr. Strange 2
I absolutely love this movie and it's probably my favourite Batman movie in all honesty
Falcone had 1 job. He was suppose to say Sam will cookie and tell his conspiracies about how the Batman is a transformer
I think the movie was ok. It's not a masterpeace in my opinion, but has good potential for the sequel
The scene when the Waynes were killed is in the Gotham series
My Supercuts commercial bookending this video uses parody doctor stranges (yes plural)
Not enough because it doesn’t say how much similarity it has to Nolan’s trilogy
Legendary.
Colin Farrell daredevil movement had me 😂😂😂
Puttin the Goth back in Gotham sent me
if not for the last 3o mins, Riddler would have been the hero.
Incelsior😂😂😂😂
and now we are waiting for the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness DO IT! DO IT!! DO IT!!!
I want to watch dr weird now.
Sometimes, the only reason I want to watch a movie is so that I’ll understand all of the references in the Honest Trailer. 😆
Don’t tease me with bringing back movie fights 😭😭😭
Batman is not investigator he is super hero
The riddler wearing a vegan friendly gymp mask..... The f??
that was the funniest call to action for like and subscribe i ever seen 😂😂😂
The Twi-Kinght saga...OMG dying  edit: I forgot Gerard Wayne lol
Can you please do an Honest Trailer for the movie Flight Of the Navigator
Twink Night?
I usually love these…I guess a terrible movie makes a terrible honest trailer.
Collin Farrell watching the Daredevil movie 😂😂
Moustache Division!
no fincher reference? ok, sure
Shovelface
best movie I've ever seen
Wasn't my vibes, too emo. But I get why a lot of ppl love it. Bale will always be my Batman. P.S. Druig sucks
This movie has so many issues, but nobody is ready for that conversation. 🍵 🐸
The Batman - the one with emo batman walking very slowly and talking very lowly.
I do miss movie fights
5:36 WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?!!!
Do Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness!!! 💫💫💫
Rocco also had supercuts (Italians will understand)
Worst Batman I ever saw
Some brown teenagers are playing knockout...hand me my stun glove🤣🤣🤣
GERARD WAYNE
The Reboot man
One of the most overrated good movies.
Now Marvel's Moon Knight please...........
You've got 6.79 millions subscribers stop crying over people not subscribing  ingrate
Watching this movie was a chore. Took me 3 sessions to finish it.
3:09 Lmao I thought they said “featuring James Corden” and I just didn’t get the joke 😂
He is Gen Z Batman 😂😂😂😂  And Twiknight Saga!!! Killed me
Wow this movie sucked
Bruce aint a Gen Z he was born in 1991
The thumbnail pic is of Batman looking up at an artist parachuting onto the stage at Coachella. Alfred definitely booked phenomenal seats!
Collin Farrell watching the old DD movie lmao
Noice
honest trailers your lame and bored hahahaha. thats why your jealous hahaAhahaNhahaD BhahaAhahaLhahaD
I liked it and the focus on practical effects for once. Also, the idea that Bruce Wayne doesn’t like Bruce Wayne and wants to be Batman more because he feels more comfortable.   I didn’t like the Joker bit. The deleted scene was good, but I also agree with the director that it would’ve taken the emphasis off of The Riddler and put it onto Joker.   Pattinson is a good Batman and I’m glad he got the part. I can’t wait for more.
I agree that the movie did not need a Joker. I also think Barry Keoghan is an excellent Joker
5:22 I was shocked by that. Shut Kingo I love Druig
You missed the best but very low hanging fruit joke.  He is the worse Vampire every, took him 15 years to turn into a Bat.
Twinekight saga 🤣 I spit my drink up 😂
The first Batman without a funny low voice but an entire cast to make up for it.
Thank God I'm not the only one that hated the shoe-in Joker moment
This summer...Emo WokeMan 🧛‍♂️🪦
I'm also a hardcore follower of you 😅
I seriously didn't know that was Collin Farrell until now.  That's crazy good makeup.
1:51   good point!  i 👍🏼 and scribed.  i don't know why i haven't before.
_YOU CAN SING LIKE THAT,EVG_
You missed the opportunity to call Pattinson “Kurt Co-Wayne” in the credits.
"some brown teenagers are playing the knock out game"😂😂😂😂😂
This Batman movie is top worst, right up these with the one with Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy.
Damn, striking out at Seattle.
lmao Druig sucks
What song is used starting at 1:24
Basically The Batman Begins Again
that was Colin Farrel ?!?!?   wow.... It's like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, had no idea for the longest time.   shows what a good actor is.
"He's ready to put the Goth back in Gotham"🤣
Gerard Way-ne 😂😂🤣🤣💀 Thanks for making Ultra Light shoot out of my nose bro
Day 1 of asking for seasons 1-5 of MHA
Mustache division 😂.
Literally the best Batman movie ever.

I want movie fights back
blah blah blah another Batman reboot.  Now I'm still asking for a Chuck Honest Trailer.  Pretty Please.
Like they could even make a penguin better than the series ...
Rat with wings? It's obviously a flying squirrel
Gerard Wayne HAUAHAHAHA
Perfect. No notes
5:12 lmao
LOL!!! >_<
Yes! Please bring back movie fights. It can even be over a video call.
This movie reminded me a lot of "The Incredibles 2" somehow
(Talking about the Martha and James murder) NO NO NO PLEASE NO NO…. NOOOOOO
I am batman i am the night....the darkness...a ninja...in steal toe heavy stomping boots
😁😁😁damn good movie
Actually it is pronounced Falconee because its Italian
Shovelface: The Revenge
emo or goth batman i can't tell the difference
I had to watch it with many, MANY pauses in between. I coundnt watch the whole thing. It was waaaay too boring.
Worst Batman movie... It took me 2 days to finish it.
I got a preroll ad from Supercuts and it blended spectacularly with the start of the video.
This reminds me of your honest trailer evaluation of Captain America: Winter Solider.  There were a few things to make fun of, but recognized a good story.
Grey’s Anatomy, please?
“Goth, in Gotham” was great.
Yo‼️   Nice Dr. Strangelove Quote 👊🏽 That is literally My most favorite movie quote of all time❗️
"Movie Fights?!" Seriously, that hurt...
Druig Sucks!!
When I heard Pattinson was to be the next Batman I groaned BUT I genuinely love his portrayal. Keaton will always be my sentimental favourite but Battinson is perfect. It didn't feel like 3 hours to me tbh. Great review guys, I needed the laugh 😆
However many truckers it takes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The TWIKNIGHT Saga" - Honest Trailers Narrator. That's it. I'm dead
This one was based on long Halloween. But without Two face, his wife and Grundy...
my little pony.  Equestria. girls
my little pony.  friendship.   is.  Magic
my little pony.   a. new.   generation
three stooges
One of the most unnecessary movies ever.
The Dark Knight is still the most well balanced despite its flaws. Seriously, I could cut the Bat & Cat completely out of this and still enjoy it more than I did in cinemas.
Can you do an honest trailer of Moon Knight?
Please do an honest trailer for Star Trek Picard
I'm actually part of gen z. I grew up in the 2000's. I consider batfleck is part of gen z too. I think Pattison batman is gen alpha. Kids that grew in the 2010's are gen alpha. Kids who grew up in 2000's are gen z.
Gotham PD: Mustache Division.
Awesome trailer, now on behalf of Every Egyptian fan of your channel myself included, we demand the moon knight honest trailer
This video makes me wanna pass on the movie 😅
why is the whole film fisheye lens?
is sonic 2 coming
Joker =taxi driver The batman = 7 Suicide squad =breakfast club Having Said thAt...one Christmas all arkham inmates escape except the joker who has to defend it from batman and Robin? How's that pitch?
Gerard wayne 🤣🤣
Literally the first thing I said after watching The Batman was "Gotham is no longer New York, it's now Seattle"
Electrical gloves, soft whispers, holy crap, it's a male Black Widow !
"Capes together strong"😂
I wonder if The Riddler ever compared journal notes with John Doe.
Batman is my favourite superhero but  disappointed with this movie. Less action, low tech, creepy emo Bruce, 1 inch bomb survivor including Alfred, sleepy slow scene, lazy catwoman mask, polite tone. A movie i felt doubt to recommend it to my friends
Come on do a honest trailer for The Boys season 2 already
you must do a honest trailer of peacemaker!  Is this where we ask this stuff? in the comment section of other videos? Or is there somewhere else for this?
Can you Please do a honest Trailer for "The Iron Giant" ?
Moon Knight yes Moon Knight
Please make Honest Trailers - Every Sam Raimi Movie
Come on!!! no jokes about Robert Pattinson was shovel face.
“So enjoy a movie made in an era where people are starting to loop back around to saying that they like dark and gritty comic book movies more again”
IMO major failure, a bad movie. Nothing really happens in this movie that makes you WOW. And movie is too long just waste of time, bad story bad actor etc.
Bring Back Movie Fights!
To be honest no one, epic voice included, has pronounced the name Falcone correctly.
You missed the part where he injects some green super serum and hulks out!  Are you sure this isn't a Marvel movie?
''How is it that his videos get 500 dudes to do terror stuff and mine get barely 10% of you to like and subscribe?'' 😂
Capes together strong damnnnnn🤣🤣🤣
These trailers are just summaries 😔
Do moon knight please
Do Demolition Man!
Don't watch the new Batman. Its so bad. Its over 2 hours of crap. Its raining almost the whole movie. You only get to see him twice in the new Batmobile. Every time he was in a fight, it was only hand to hand. There was NOT any WOW moments. Don't waste your time on that movie.
that's cool and all but now make the peacemaker honest trailer
They should make a Red Batman then let Ryan Reynolds play it.
Honestly not all that funny. The movie was really good. Suprised how good it was. ScreenJunkies were realy good too, now unfortunately not so much
PLEASE DO AN HONEST TRAILER FOR THE MOVIE  JIU JITSU!! 2020
And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.   (Revelation 20:1-3)
I want a Batman Who Laughs movie.
The only thing i disliked about this movie is when The Riddler turned out to be a tiktocker. I was like, he's such a mysterious, totally crazy character and in the end, "subscribe, like my post, guys" , getting tips from followers. I was like wtf? way to ruin the movie. Also, it didn't need to be 3 hours long
I fell asleep in the theater during this movie. Best nap I've ever had. Too bad I had to be woke up.
Please say “‘Strong’? You see? You see! Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!”.
I just watched a fake marvel universe ad for supercuts narrated by the honest trailers epic voice guy and then the video started and it was still him speaking about supercuts... I'm so confused
Please do "Plan 9 from Outer Space".
BTW, the way they solved the riddles made me think soooo much about the batman of 67... Except here it was not meant to be that funny
Wait, it sound like you actualy liked that crap ? I'm still considering if it was worst than Forever :/ But I'm definitly convinced Pattinson is the worst batman to date >_> Batman is Dark maybe Goth But Pattinson is giving us 500 shades of Emo an emo Batman with crying makeup... Just no.
THIS MOVIE SUCKED ... I COULDN'T EVEN WATCH THE WHOLE THING ....
@5:25 I heard “the twai NITe” but I saw: The Twink Night.
Please do uncharted honest trailer!!!!
Please say "What mouth?"
this is the worst batman ever ...... and wasted 3 hours of my life
Could you do Alf?
Honest trailer for RRR!
Batman 2022 is the worst batman movie of all time
Say "I love you in every universe"
Pls do Dr. Strange multiverse of madness 🧙
“Gerard Wayne” lmao perfect.
The guy with awesome cool voice.
Why so many directors think that taking themselves too seriously makes themselves better directors?  This seems like a perfect example, and sadly so do the Matrix sequels.
4:40. I hate when directors think long pensive lingering shots immediate translate to built up tension and just assume it’s also being artistic.
4:12. Between his muddled American accent and over brooding, I couldn’t tell if he was saying “ain’t” or “haven’t”. 1) Every actor is trained to anúnciate (but the may not be trained <cough — Twilight>.; 2) I couldn’t unhear it and just thought “Bruce Wayne would never say’ ain’t.” Again; could be my mistake, why is he mumbling when it’s just he and Alfred and he’s not in costume?
Vig Lebowski! Ha ha ha ha
now WE WANT DR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS!
“The Vig Lebowski”…you win the internet.
I have no desire to watch Woke Batman
Was that a New Girl reference @3:42 😂?
The Twiknight saga alternate name: the Dark-light Trilogy
Worse batman of all times Robert Cannot act at all terrible
Very nice low-key MCR reference.
I do want Movie Fights
For guys, I don't recommend you go to super cuts. The times I've been there, my haircuts have been subpar. You can get a way better haircut at a barbershop.
My birthday is next week
@1:54 😁   almost a million and a half views in two days with 70,000 likes.
Was that a Snyder shout out at the end?
Yeah I have absolutely zero interest in this movie. Which is saying something since I've seen all the others. Even the ones from the good old days of VHS.... but this? Nope...
Good stuff, next do the original Battlestar Galactica.
Gordon: "He's my Plus One. Deal."
you said the thing with the horse for kids show!...
Thanks for this, now i don't need to see this garbage movie
DO MOONKNIGHT NEXT
Movie fights with Dan
I liked the cinematics they were really good, but the script was kinda lazy, some parts were cheesy/goofy and not in an intentionally funny way, the actors tried too hard at times, they tried to make it seem more realistic according to logic but they half assed that aspect, some parts were tediously long, and if I wanted to watch a Batman movie again I'd just watch one of the older ones which are far more better in my opinion in terms of plot and story. I feel like people are overlooking some of these things because it's a "NEW Batman movie!" and their emotions are having an influence on their opinions, it's not a terrible movie but it could be A LOT better. Hopefully the second one proves to be better than the first.
Lol, i live in the Seattle area... it's raining right now
So glad I never watched this steaming pile of garbage... I'll watch Sonic 2 over this crap a billion times :D
Movie fights? Yessir
Now do Sense8 PLEASE!
Capes together strong, nice one
The TwiKnight Saga 😂
The long awaited sequel to Seven
I?ll never get tired of asking for idiocracy
Also the final stake in his twillight sparkle was wirh The Lighthouse. He knocked me out of my socks with that awesome acting.
This is so weird. The movie had a great atmosphere. I started watching thinking that I will hate it. But i enjoyed it. Problem is it was too long and by the end I wasn't that invested anymore.
i really really didn’t like it at all
you should do the bad guys movie next :D
This is also a ridiculous average Batman movie.  Not good, not bad just... average.
penguin farrell forced to watch daredevil killed me
Do “war of worlds “ please‼️
2:00 The answer is Dan Murrell. It was great when it was Spencer, Roth, Dan, and Joe. I looked forward to seeing a new video everyday.
It's Movie Fights back?
Supercuts
"Is 1 part NY" = shows a clip of Liverpool
Puts the goth in Gotham made me laugh
nice video, i thought he would say more about the fights (many bad ones) and some other stuff that usually go unnoticed
Yes movie fights. Thanks.
Movie fights
Gotham pronounced Falcone the same way didn't it?
I just wish they'd stop trying to make realistic movies about some guy dressed in a bat suit.
Can you say "dual wielding is actually pretty fun."?
I really really really hate this movie.
This makes me glad I didn't see the movie.
Music?
Thought this movie was 40 min too long and some of the dialog sucked, way too dark at times(thought I'd never say that), Pattinson lines were delivered very corny, and I could hear his accent at times. This movie was just ok if that.
Why did it take them so long to create a cowl that wasn't attached to the rest of his body? Batman really needs the ability to turn his head without bringing the rest of his body with it.
"He's ready to put the Goth back in Gotham"  Nice! ^_^
Please say in either your Bart Simpson voice or Batman voice: "Everybody if you can do the Bartman. Uh. Shake your body turn it out if you can, can. Uh. Do the Bartman. Yeah!"
Hey, don't you say anything bad about Lego Batman that was perfection
Why didn’t you guys ever make one of these for The Crow?
I am a total simp for all things Batman. Including the movie where a skinny gink can beat up a crowd of bad guys while wearing 50lb. of armour. And this Honest Trailer. Perfect!
i hate catwoman's mask, it cover only her nose. i can pick her out of a line up!
"Capes together strong" I died 😂🤣
...and he's an emo goth little bish cry baby about things.
Wth i just got knockout doctor strange supercut ad before getting a supercut ad bruh
Now do moon knight
wll that movie sucks!
What are you showing me come on hahaha
You see Lt. Gordon, but all I can see is that goober doctor from Only Lovers Left Alive.
Mustache Division and Gerard Wayne got me dying on the floor
REQUEST:....  Hay. Can u do for deadpool game?.....................................
Great movie
"The Riddler, who looks nothing like the Riddler but more like some guy into BDSM"
He could have really stopped it, by just showing up at work, at least for a day to cut the funding to that trust
"movie fights?" - yes, please
Was I the only one who thought The Riddler in the movie was basically Jigsaw if he became a Twitch streamer?
Batman be like: Gotham? More like Goth Am haha *puts heavy eyeliners
a good movie for me, waiting for the following installments
This movie is RACIST TOWARD WHITE PEOPLE, you should had point it out!!! GARBAGE MOVIE
"Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie" is insanely hilarious 🤣🤣
No notes on Catwoman? Not even about her absurd "mask"?
Not the Honest Trailer we need. The Honest Trailer we deserve.
I couldn't believe, while in the theater, they didn't solve immediately "the rata alada"...
“Starring Gerard Wayne” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 IM FUCKING WEAAAAAKKKKKKKK
are you ever doing Odd Thomas ? or does it have to be famous to get attention ?
Shovel face is actually a good actor. Go figure. I love how grounded this one was. They're all so... human
hey do the honest trailer of supernatural  , plzzzzz
Batman in this movie just like amazing Spider-Man before he saved the kid on the bridge.
Man you guys missed ... Robert Battinson
hmm hes perfect cast for robin or even nightwing, Not batman, Just come on. BATMAN is supposed to be freaking scary. anyways some people love it. good for them.
When an honest trailer is this short int means the movie is not bad
Can't we just go a few years without a new batman movie? Give us a chance to miss him first. Same for the Joker. I'm tired of these characters, and this movie does not seem to do anything interesting. Heck, making the riddler an influencer is just terrible.
You really love roasting this movie, ain’t ya? 😂😂
Not one mention of Smeagol?
It didn't felt it like a 200 Million dollar Batman movie. They totally forgot Batman is just a human who uses gadgets and tools to do super stuff. Batman in not immune to bomb exploding in the face. They also forgot to give the the villain their costumes. They could have just remove the Batman name, Batman costume and make it a normal crime mystery movie.
Honestly thought u were going to do the clone wars for May the 4th
I just couldn't, it's not the Batman I know nor the one I need.
I am sure The Batman figures out the answer alfred just suggest another way which he himself gets confused in it and so The Batman corrects him which alfred copies later on of which Of The Batman Already Know The Answer!
Didn't like it Batman is dumb they start years later after he is Batman and everyone is scared of him even though  he just goes around punching people and hopes the city gets better I was hoping Batman Year One with a little the Night of owls not a youtuber Riddler
They really tried hard to sell their new Batman theme song here
I didn't like the movie But maybe the next one will be better.
Probably one of the most unrealistic Batman imo. Batman doesn't have superhuman strength yet he survives from a close up shotgun blast & riddled by AR15 shots, hit part of a bridge then crash into bus then hit the ground like it's nothing and was electrocuted before falling into the water that also should've killed him.
My reaction to the old Daredevil movie : " Why Ben, why ? " While Colin Ferrell's : " Holy Cow!"
Gerard Wayne)) I understood that reference)))
I hated this movie and yet this honest trailer was very boring. Not funny at all. ☹️
I feel like we've had more Jokers than Batmans at this point... Batmen?
Glad I didn't waste money going to see this.
Puddle of Sin got me
Kiss from a rose sample?  I'm in, I'll check it out
I've just realized, I'm Sa†an
MOON KNIGHT NEXT PLEASE!!!
When they shifted from a black screen to a scene from The Batman I realised how dark the movie was
5:10 ...im dead hahahha
torrent it, this movie aint worth spending anything on its frigging horrible
Nityanada!
Please Say : Love you lots more than lollipop 🍭 up the bum with cream cheese 🧀 and sweet chilli 🌶 sours
do honest trailer for Wayne's World, Party Time Excellent
Still hoping for Peacemaker honest trailer. Gotta get some more of that intro too XD.  Every day we wait for this trailer, Eagley will find you 🦅XD
I dunno, I really liked how realistic Batman was in this movie. His intelligence wasn't superhuman, so having to rely on others was a good take. It makes him not-BatGod.
THe BAtman, or how I call it: "Emo Batman Walking"
Ironic, I just got an ad on the video about supercuts with a dr strange theme, then the video started I also got an ad.
Imagine getting your haircut at supercuts
DO THE MOON KNIGHT HONEST TRAILER
Batman sucks but villains are great so the movie was ok
The dumbest movie of 2022
Omg yes movie fights!!! I miss hal so much!
Yes movie fights or no likes
Think you mean The Wokekinght Saga cause that's how it's feels like.
I know this would be done but .. HONEST TRAILER FOR MOON KNIGHT !!!
Batman kills the truck drivers ? You all should go through that scene again.
It's Se7en.  It's just Se7en
2:14 That shot of Batman without the cape looks SO MUCH like Daredevil
Literally my most anticipated movie of the year....And it certainly did not disappointment
Movie fights!
I literally got a super cuts ad when I clicked on this video 💀
I really REALLY enjoyed this movie. Best Depiction of Batman ever. Of all time. :D
It’s basically emo batman with corrupt government and mafia dons which is a different version of dc
WOW PENGUIN ACTOR WAS AWESOME, WAS HE REALLY CRACKHEAD BULLSEYE FROM DAREDEVIL?
lol rat with wings... whoa where's Robbin!
Epic Voice Papi, please say, “I hope Elon buys YouTube too.”

bring back Movie Fights, YOU COWARDS! seriously, once every couple months is fine but I need my fix!
Me: I’m so tired of twilight jokes This guy: twiknight saga...... Me: WHEEZE
No reference to shovel face? You forgot your roots, screenjunkies
You really dropped the ball on this one. It seems like you actually Iiked it and that made you pull back on your criticisms. How could you not even mention cat woman's mask lol
I feel like this movie would’ve been 1000x better 10 years ago. When every other movie wasn’t a superhero movie/origin story.
Wow this movie looks so awful! Thank you for saving my money.
Something in my a$$.. hmmMMmmMmmMm
Christian Bale's Batman was better than this.
best ending joke in a while...
This movie in my opinion set a new standard for not only Batman films but superhero movies in general.. it’s cinema at its action packed, comic book finest… reminded me of the days when big blockbuster high budget films weren’t all green screen and mostly cgi…
2:59 South Park vibes.
"...and physically invincible" I mean... God, I miss being in my 20s. With some armour on, that stunt would've seemed like fun.
Insert: Things you can say that most people wouldn't like... "Batman isn't a superhero because Batman doesn't have super powers" Mic Drop 🎤
So stupid this movie was. Thanks Honest Trailers.
movie fightsssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!
What's the track at 2:57 ?
0:35 missed opportunity to say "in a world of corruption and chaos, there is a movie called "the batman"..."
Pitch Meeting was funnier, but mustache division and Colin Farrell being forced to watch the old Daredevil gave me the giggles.
You should do oceans 11 if you haven’t already
If you murder people to get subs, I'd be more inclined to subscribe.
I absolutely love this movie. Favourite Batman, not even close
Since when us Batman emo...?
Man somebody adapt the arkham knight but like remove the bataomobile parts
Little Giants for the start of NFL please!
Superman 1987 Bollywood    Staring Christopher reeve ( without his knowledge)
“Gerard Wayne” is probably one of the best “starring” names you have done!
Movie Fights!! Please come back!
that inro music...
But filmed in Glasgow 🤣🤣🤣
i seriously miss and want nolan+bale combination back!
Do Willow please
So you bringing movie fights back then???
You had to be brilliant with this one. It's a brilliant movie and your honest trailer didn't make it justice.
Wow, looks terrible
not one mention of SEV7N?  really... So much Fincher, so little respect...
Question. Does *anybody* want a Joker in the next movie?  Everybody I know is bored with Joker and Harley being forced down our throats in every adaptation. Batman has so many other villains... come on! No more Joker!!!
A day late but still unrelenting BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!
the fact that Bruce and Batman kept coming back to the club with the exact same demeanor, stance, voice, and jaw, and nobody making the connection, felt silly. so much for a realistic Batman movie
This movie sucked on a level of suck that sucks more than MTG, or any of the sucky Star Wars movies ever sucked...which is pretty f*cking sucky.   It sucks so bad I couldn't even bring myself to watch your entire video: and that's a first. At 02:27 I threw up in my mouth a little remembering the 14 minutes of my life I wasted trying to watch this sucky assed movie.
Best Soap opera ever.
The "filmed in New York, but mostly in Seattle" was spot on. Evidently Gotham is in the middle of a rain forest?
Murders?  Lol af.
the wingsuit sequence was so bad. also the way he survives point blank explosions and smacking head first into a steel bridge. otherwise, the movie was awesome.
Supercuts! They cut more than anyone else… And that includes prices!!! I walked into a Supercuts with $10 and walked out with fresh lines, no crown, and one ear. With a combined staff experience of over 15 hours, Supercuts’ hair artists are the cream of the chop. Vincent van Go see one today!!!
Give me an honest trailer for Bojack Horseman and I will like and subscribe!
Please... NO MORE JOKER
Wish he would’ve said featuring slow walking bc he walks up slow in so many scenes
Really missed the chance to use "Something in the WAYne"
Do "Peacemaker" next, please!
So, you think it’d be possible to do a Daredevil Honest Trailer now that Doctor Strange 2 comes out this weekend?
Once again Honest Trailers has saved me from another insufferable overhyped piece of cinematic debris.
when the satire video about the movie has better resolution than the movie you  bought on YouTube  👀
There's the subway fight scene and there's the rest of the movie. This batman emotes so hard its laughable.
I’m a little disappointed you didn’t mention how darn repetitive the soundtrack was.
That movie was so bad I couldn't even finish the Honest Trailer of it either 🤮
hahahaha
Honest roadsters videos always make my dau
Honest raisers videos all ways make My day
Movie fights without Dan murrell just sounds depressing 🤦🏻‍♂️
Plundercats ! 🤣😂🤣
Even just the first gen z joke was worth the follow. 👍
Sometimes I can’t tell if they like or hate the movies they make fun of. They call it a ridiculously long Batman movie. Is that a positive or negative?
This movie was, stop trying to make it happen. It was bad acting, bad screenplay, bad casting, bat directed bad everything. Why are they making a part 2?
How could you not talk about the obvious similarities between this movie and Fincher movies like Seven, Zodiac, and Fight Club. Especially Seven
I have mixed feelings about this movie. I wanted to like it but there was something in the way. Yeah, mmmmm.
Such a disappointing version of Batman. Now that we have a a good one (Cristian Bale) and two not so good ones (Afleck and Pattinson, can we move on from this version? Find a young actor who actually looks like Terry McGinnis and make a Batman Beyond show.
Worst batman 😫
INCELSIOR!!!  "Noooooooooooooooooooooo!! This is NOT how this was supposed to go!!!!!!!!!!!!"
“ gen z where they are worse off than their parents “ I’m Dead 💀
That was missing at least one "shovelface"
Lmaoo this really honest
i've ben waiting the shovel face😁
That underwater joke was dark 😂
Best Batman movie ever.
I actually really liked this version. The cuts in this video make it seem much more…comical…than it actually is- which makes sense considering this review is purely for comic purposes. Still, there are a few moments in the movie where I went ‘that’s dumb’, but I ended up giving them passes because the idea was ok, and the rest of the movie was pretty good. I especially liked the cinematography of many of the scenes, especially the one where Batman comes out from the darkness at the train station. While that scene only made sense if he was waiting at that particular spot for a while, it was just so impactful that I had to let it slide via the rule of cool. That kinda summarized my take on the movie: some nonsensical stuff, but always overshadowed by something super cool.
I'm cutting this off and unsubscribing if I hear a single twilight joke .
Never mind the shock at Colin Farrell being under all those prosthetics, I can't believe that psycho Trevor from Eastenders circa 2001 is the police chief in this!
I'm just gonna say TDK movies pronounced Falcone's name right (Falcone-e)  They got it wrong in this movie.
💀💀💀💀💀💀
3:50 But the Italian pronunciation of Falcone is phonetically Fal-co-ney. Americanised is Fal-cone-ee.
I'd subscribe if they split off honest trailers like they did with pitch meeting.
This was a disappointing honest trailer tbh , didn’t flame the movie at all really
Fair points that show it wasn't a perfect movie. The physics when the mayor candidate gets shot are just atrocious. Why would her head move back like that when she wasn't shot in it? The point where she gets shot gets pushed back, every other limb or head stays in place. Plus, after that she just seems like nothing happened.
Thank you!
I thought "The Batman" absolutely sucked!  It was WAY too slow to develop, the eye makup (ugh), and what's up with all the rain, in every f'ing scene?!
And ridiculously ridicules boring Batman.... 🥱
Druig sucks
Please do Moon Knight. I need a Moon Knight Honest Trailer!
2:07 You could have really foreshadowed by calling this: *The Tumbler* sequence
Please say "that ain't no etch-a-sketch. This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet".
Do moon knight it just finished today
He did it, he finally did it
this film was like watching a live-action version of Duane Capizzi's Batman cartoon
Just do Green Mile already, dammit
This was tame af for a movie this atrocious
I actually liked this movie
I actually enjoyed it, I didn't even notice it was 3hrs long until near the end, like others have said Catwoman's mask is a joke and looks stupid yet the rest of her outfit was fine. If that was meant to be the Joker in the cell I hope they change their mind and make a better vers, the jarod letos vers was garbage and this sounded similar.
these series is prime opportunity for Clayface to make his cinematic debut
Batman could have been replaced for a couple of bodyguards for the powerful victims and they would have done a better job.
Please do Dragonballs Honest Trailers 😏🌚🤧
'The Twink Night Saga'
“I can only get 2% of you to subscribe” -> has 6.7 Million Subscribers -> Video doesnt even have 2 Million Views
do Euphoria!!!!!
Some brown teenager?.. it was also some white ones too…
Do an honest trailer for turning red!!
Gosh, even the Honest Trailer about this movie is boring.
4:53 “oh come on”? It’s THE JOKER he HAS to appear at some point
Do The Expanse!
do star trek picard s1
Please do Moon Knight.!!!
The white entitled male line completely pulled me out of the movie and ruined it
one of my friends who was in my school actually is in the movie. his name is called Oscar Novak
Careful, he’s a hero
Is it possible you to do Honest Trailer of Depp - Heard trial? XD
This was the most Batman movie i have ever seen
I agree the Joker is overused and should not have been the villain until a possible second trilogy
do disney+ simpsons shorts
😂😂 definitely is the worst batman movie.
"Gen Z Batman- his villians are influencers and soon his hometown will be underwater" gosh that killed me
"True Gen Z Batman" you aint wrong there.
This movie made me so upset with how competent it started out with the noir stuff, before ruining it with the second half. The Riddler sucks in this movie and I love Paul Dano but this is by far his worst performance. Ave Maria was a real no-turning-back moment that echoed Batman v Superman's Ring-ting-ting moment. Also, did anyone think this storyline was eerily similar to the season 1 of the Telltale video games for both takes supposedly trying to be original?
That was really bad movie that everyone seems to like except me. Are you blind, people????
Finally 😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Give me Hugo Strange in the sequel!!
This is not my batman
And that scary song.. so mono. Keeps on and on and on zzz
Here's the thing, people hate it and love it in equal measures. But, what people don't understand is that this is a slow burner of a film. The sequels to come will expand and broaden the batman character in both the character of Batman and Bruce Wayne. By film three we will be be gifted a Batman more developed, more rounded and more grounded in a world that we haven't seen yet. We will get a strong Bruce Wayne, a conflict ed Bruce Wayne and we will get a more developed and experienced Batman. I can't wait. To me this movie screams "watch what comes next" and me, I'm 100% down for it
Technically Alfred didn't solve the it.
lmao omg, no cap, i told my friend that Riddle looks like a garbage bag screwed a bondage suit XD Glad to hear u share half of my sentiment :-P
you know why people never press the like button?
The Whisper-man but really a great villian

Less than 10% like and subscribe because your videos are now basically character assassinations which highlights only the bad points in any film.
For God's sake man, do the Peacemaker already...
Don’t you dare tease us with that movie fights callback. The wounds are still fresh 😢
Did he say brown teenagers? Lol
I got a supercuts add before watching the video. Very confusing
Collin was simply playing Robert de Niro.
I think this downtrodden version of Gotham would be a good on-screen setting for Clayface, Mad Hatter, Hugo Strange, or Deathstroke.  Heck, I’d love to see a Jason Todd/Red Hood arc.
do everything everywhere all at once!
Colin Farrell after watching the old daredevil movie 🤣😂😅😆😁😄😃😀
It would've been hilarious if u had included the stares sequences similar to the ones from Twilight honest trailers because the movie had so many STAAARRESSSS!
I got a Supercuts ad before a Supercuts ad
Gerard Wayne?! Really?!   lol 🤣
The Batman is a masterpiece
5:13 that Colin Ferrell bit got me lol
I would love to see Hush done in this movie series. He is tailor made for this Gotham
This movie would have been a lot better if ridller's mother name was "MARTHA" too
Do 2000's greatsword action movies.  Just like you did with the 80's and 90's.
Emoman
Nothing about endless cribbing of look, villain vibe & plot points from SE7EN?  You guys never miss those!
This movie felt like the most unnecessary batman movie yet.
Manbat would also be horrifying in a sequal plus would be the first villian batman shows true fear towards
Next Batman : introduce a new villain a la Harley Quinn in the Animated Series
Hey, y'know what, we didn't have to see Bruce Wayne's parents get killed again. With the yelling and the pearls and what have you.
I didn't expect druig sucks at akl
Capes together strong is brilliant
I am waiting for you to say shovel face again... 😅😅😅😅
Batman didn’t fk cat woman, is this a crime or what?
DC should should stop calling it batmobile. It should be tumbler from now.
I was kinda disappointed there wasn't a montage with shovelface Batman and "Great Ambition" music... I mean it had quite a lot of stares.
..newyork..like..
Twinight Saga….chefs kiss to y’all!
I really wish they stuck to the whole Se7en and Zodiac style to the movie and finished it like that. The generic action scene fighting a bunch of Redditors who want to flood the city was just so random and ruined the whole flow of the movie. The Riddler was supposed to be the big scary threat like John Doe from se7en. It was a 9/10 movie until that point. If it was 2h30m with the last scene gone and something more dramatic with the riddler that would have been much better.
I had to up my screen brightness before the video
The killing of Bruce’s parents at the end had me laughing. I love this channel.
Are you guys gonna do Lost in Space?
Today is Wednesday means Moonknight day do Moonknight................
all they have to do is watch a batman dc animated movie. and translate that into a live action. its not that hard. stop giving up emo batmans and batmans with strep throat. its like they saw deadpool and if they just throw enough action and dark scenes theyll get a a winner. marvel has made winners because they actually have a good story, good cast and reference material.
This movie was boring 🪴
I’m going to say an unpopular opinion. I like this bat man more than the dark night trilogy.
Plz say 'DOMAIN EXPANSION'
Why would I watch your music video?  Everything musical you guys do is so, so bad.  I can't even watch the trailers where you "rewrite" songs.  Because they're so, so bad.
Honest Trailers > HISHE
Gotham PD's mustache division! 😂😂😂😂😂
DAWRKERRR
Had to watch 3 times....  Kept falling asleep  Suck'd
Rpattz: Born in 1986 Honest Trailers Trying to Be Down with the Youths: Is this a Gen Z?
Look the movie looks good but there aint noway in Hell Bruce Wayne has never seen a Carpet Bolster before and thats the fancy name.
Isn’t that Two Face inside the cell
1:50 Please don't leave Honest Trailer Epic Voice Guy Jon Bailey I do subscribed and like.
Do more DC CONTENT
CAPES TOGETHER STRONG AHAHAHAHA 🤣
LOL "almost" ruins his sextape...almost!
0:57 "...Put the final stake in his twilight sparkle!"  Well, friendship IS magic...
the movie is long and boring with a terrible plot
"I need a hero! Im holding out for a hero with eyeliner at night!"
No reason we cant have super powered villains…don’t take some of the coolest characters out for the sake of “realism”
Was disappointed that you didn't go with; No, it's not Fatoush. It's Falcone.
Kindly do an honest trailer for James Gunn’s Peacemaker
Finally someone calling it out for being ridiculous...
Honest trailers of honest trailers pleaseeeeeeee
"He puts the goth back in Gotham"  Lmfao perfect
2:23. I used to have that. It's called a lite bright.
Is no one going to talk about how she goes from Catwoman in the Lego batman movie... To this amazing performance!?  Does no one IMDb?
Fu****g finnaly
Druig sucks. LOL
You should do an honest trailer for Gravity Falls. I DARE you not to cry during the finale.
Please say: "Am I vengeance? Or am I Justice? I'll figure it out. Why? BECAUSE I'M BATMAN!"     Thanks for the video! Loved the Batman so I was just waiting for this video. Riddler was great at sing Ave Maria but his new single "Kiss from a Bat" was amazing.
Dressed like a garbage bag 🤣
Bring movie fights back you monsters!
sorry for not being a comic book nerd, but was the last bit a reference to the avengers?
love your works...check out vetro music too
That intro song was wonderful
His Butler steals vibranium from wakanda
Youre kidding me...thats what they went with for the Riddlers's and cat women's costumes....jesus
Dumb Knight Detective: The Movie
I’m surprised the video never addressed that Gotham is below sea level. It’s a pretty mind blowing revelation, especially considering how much it rains, the city would be underwater by 2023 just because there’s absolutely nowhere for the rain to drain to
I can't believe they didn't mention the explosion on Batman's chin with no scratches. When I first saw he movie I thought "Honest trailers will make a joke on this scene " I'm disappointed.
They really let Penguin go after finding him in the middle of a drug deal with a body in his car.
Hard to make a parody trailer for a movie that's actually good. This falls pretty flat, man.
So In Other words. Everyone who doesn't like this movie. Doesn't grasp the concept batman isn't perfect in year two.... Got it🤦🏿‍♂️
It would be interesting to see the Holiday Killer or two face in one of these
Loved it,yep 20 MN to long,car chase to short
Movie Fights!
Nice place to put an advertisment for subscribing - but I already did :-/
Is it weird that i had a super cuts add before this video
I'm tired of people missing the point of Batman. He is world greatest detective. His money went more into just brooding and eyeliner. He invested himself also into the sciences and detectology. I refuse to watch another gritty/ brooding rehash. Give me Batman the animated Series or Arkham Series. Give me something to enjoy. Hell, I'll take Batman doing the bully McGuire dance if its more than Batman sad, Gotham Dark.
No interest in DC films. They're all over the place with countless remakes and reboots. They literally have no leadership or plan 🤣
My least favorite of the Batman films and such an awful, coma inducing score/theme.  Decent Honest Trailer. Thank you.
I personally think Robert Pattinson don't look like a rich man.
Bring back Movie fights!!!
This movie was so garbage.  They made Batman so fucking weak. He can barely fight. Garbage
Plundercats Ho! LMFAO
Attempt #36 on convincing screen junkies to make an honest trailer on Freddy got Fingered.
Fantastic movie, just needed like 15-20 mins cutting out. The last part of Riddler’s plan with the flood and shooters in the stadium just seemed sort of pointless in the end. The shooter got the Mayor somewhere in the torso, but then she was fine. Batman just mopped up a bit of the mess. I loved the overall aesthetic and hard boiled detective noir approach though.
MOVIE FIGHTS!!!!
4:52 ALRIGHT I GET IT
Watching everyone heap praise on top of this godawful movie has just eroded the last sense of trust I had in the fandom.   This wasn't just a terrible Batman movie, it was a terrible movie.
GERARD WAYNE  killjoys, make some noise!
Bro the Batman sucks so bad for me that I can’t watch your review this is the first time I don’t wanna watch your review but you do a good job this Batman sucked
All I wanted since I heard about twilight Batman is a face off between him and Jared Leto joker! This was the Batman to take on the gansta version of the joker! And yes I want harlequin in it!
1 part New York and now 8 parts Seattle? You mean 90 percent Liverpool UK...
I just an ad about some hair cut commercial with your voice
No mention of the potential THOUSANDS of people who died when riddler flooded the city but bat’s saved like 10 people so its all good? No? Ok.
Please say, "The more I understand humanity, the more I love my dog."
Please make an Honest Trailer for 300: Rise of an Empire!
I love that batman was so bad at his job in this movie that riddler thought they were working together and was shook- eth when batman didn't praise him
YESS I just finished the movie yesterday hahaha
Can you do one on turning red?
Please do Orange is the new black
4:12 uh secretly based he knows?!
"The Batman's coming!!! Quick, we have to get out of here!... in like five minutes!"
Where’s the honest trailer for demolition man????!!!!
haha why are humans so dumb. A rat with wings is the bad guy... Watch South Park and you'll know who the bad guy is.
Why did they make Alfred sexier than Batman?!?! He looked more like a millionaire playboy vigilante than Robert Patterson. And after playing Klaue, Andy Serkis probably could have played him too!
Jarvis : can I help you sir? You soooo stu hmm a a no problem sir
cmon. deredevil was ok. let it go already
Its the avenger 😋
He gave 2004 emo Batman
Movie Fights yes
Nice one
Twilight Batman sucks eggs.
PLZZZZZ DO MOONKNIGHT
DO PUNISHER (2004) PLS
Something in the way....
Yes we want movie fights!
This trailer is much better than the sorry movie.
This was one of the worst films ive ever seen. Totally awful.
Do Turning Red! 🐼 ♥
Wont watch the movie because how they did the riddler.
😂😂😂
Give me the chills with the line "Welcome to PlayPaintChill. You just gained honor +2 for following us ! ".
1 part New York, 8 parts Seattle and 1 part New Orleans...Until near the end when it's 10 parts new orleans. Because who the hell builds UNDER the water line?!
A mcr mention... That's something I never thought I would see
Don’t waste your time making any more music videos.  Only honest thing about it was how cringeworthy it was.
"Gerard Wayne" * chef's kiss *
The Goth of Gotham !
Andy Serkis and you went ape reference instead of gollum?
Why don’t you tell us if the story was good or not like you used to?
Every Starring in this one was 10/10.
Criminal:" who the hell are you supposed to be?" Batman: "When i was i young boy, my father took me into the city"
Why is that music constantly two notes away from the Heart Shaped Box?
Honest Trailers under siege plssssssssss
Thanks. Better save time & money for other movies then.
Hahahaha...
When your super power is anxiety.
GERARD WAYNE LMAAO
I lost it since "That's just a black screen"!
Nobody was intimidated or impressed by this Batman
"Incelsior!" Perfect
This movie was like a 6/10 😅. The protrayal of catwomen was a disaster basically just falls in love for no reason and serves no purpose. Main storyline rather uneventful and straight forward. Only good thing was the cinematography
Do an honest trailer of Power
Yes, we do want Movie Fights… lol
A bloated Batman Movie who cannot tell the difference between Cat Woman, Huntress, or Bat Woman.
Do morbius
The twiknight, just brilliant, Bruce Sparkles at his peak!!
'Bruce Cobain' fits better or maybe 'Kurt Wayne'
“In a world of corruption and chaos, the people cry out for a hero who can join them in the darkness…” “Darker than that” “Even darker” “Darker…” (the deep voice sent me🤣) “That’s…just a black screen”  PLZ this whole section almost made me spit out my food😭🤣🤣
I literally had to turn my phone brightness up to watch this honest trailer😂😂😂…that says it all!
I remember when these videos were funny.
4:00 - thats like the whole point of the movie...
While I really like the movie, I do get why people point out that the "world's greatest detective" only figures most of the stuff out thanks to others sort of figuring it out for him.
Not gonna lie but I fel asleep midway in the movie. When I woke up it still wasn't the interval!  Damn thats long!!!
hahaha The Twikhight Saga ah you're so funny
Does anyone else feel like Honest Trailers have just become a collection of jokes and puns?  Like they used to have a narrative based on the actual story of the movie and jokes in between   Now it's just- What's this? What's that? Have we made jokes about all the main characters? Great. That's your honest trailer. See ya.   The story of the movie matters very little in these now
Batman has a always sucked. Same with Spiderman and Superman.
He should say “something in the way…mmm mmmm.”
😂 this video earned my like  To earn likes for future videos, please do movie murder but not movie riddles (those earns dislikes), and for subs, I need a riddle riddled movie murder.
Now do Uncharted
The movie was Darker and Red
Before I watch this, this is my honest trailer for the batman:  Sherlock, but Sherlock is Batman and the episode is too long because London is corrupt.
"incelsior" was on point.
😂😂
Look I'm not a big Affleck fan , but I would have rather seen his batman movie rather than that a self absorbed narcissist playing his twilight batman
Worst version of a batman movie ever!!
Interested to see more of Keoghan's Joker in future projects
I lost it at Gerard Wayne 😂😂
This was probably first time in my life i really wanted to get out of cinema, but it was barely ok to stay till the end. Only once have I really walked out in the middle of some movie, so makes it second worst movie I saw in cinema hm
This was a great movie. 👌
Please Say "Oh Geez!"
DO Moon knight Honest trailer
Nothing about Zoë hilarious walks? 😂
Do V for Vendetta!
Who did the background music for this? Cause it's really good. Can we get a download link?
I thought he was going to mention Catwoman being racist for sure
I laughed hard when you called Riddler 'Incelsior' 😂  He really went from incel to in-a-cell, huh?
A lot of Liverpool City in there aswell man.. research 🙈
my pc took a serious risk of having all my coffee at the "mustache division" bit

"Colin Farrel watching the old Daredevil movie..." XD
what a terrible movie
This was better than the actual film.
His villains are influencers  Super accurate
"Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil Movie", How do you guys even come up with these 😂😂😂.
"Druig sucks" had me rolling lmao
Actually i think you'll find it was starring little nicky
Please please please do an Austin Powers Trailer <3 <3 <3
is that Nirvana's Heart-Shaped Box i hear in the background?
he didn't kill any truck driver.  it was Penguin. do people really have such shitty attention spans.
Not wotching this!!! I mean the movie, not this trailer lol
I liked the movie because it is salvaging Batman from the Zack Snyder mess. Ther e is hope for DC now.
Please do sonic the hedgehog 2
It was 3 hours but honestly one of the movies that I didn't get tired to watch👍
Colen Farrel watching the old dare devil movie be like  "\ common what oyou showin me" lol
Alfred's name made me seriously laugh out loud. Scared my dog 😂
I see quality of this show has degraded drastically over the years
I would like to see your opinion on Mamoru Hosoda’s “Belle”. I liked it. Just wanted to rise awareness on it.
gerard wayne .. lol that cracked me up.. *sheds tear and smiles...
Gerard Way-ne haha 😂😂😂
Yeah, when I saw batman get clotheslined by an overpass, I just laughed at how he got up. Uh...No!
It's also a really, really, really bad batman movie. Gen Z is screwed, and most of them don't even realise this. :)
Before the video started I got an ad narrated by Epic Voice Guy. No clever comment from me, I'll just leave the fun replies for you.
The Batman staff: Hire a friggin' competent editor next time!
Excuse me while I go watch my favorite movie of all time Batman Begins instead
This movie was good for less than half of it.
People complaining about the pronunciation Falcone have clearly never seen The Godfather
Not to knit-pick, but that wasn’t a shot from Dawn of Planet of the Apes
"Incelsior!" "Colin Farrell watching the old daredevil movie" 😂💀  Amazing work guys - was definitely worth the wait!!
The "bi" catwoman thing and the raceswapped Gordon reeks of wokeism for me.
0:28 Trust me, this is where you want to start.
I thought Colin Farrell was the best part of this movie, way better than Danny DeVito but, the movie was lacking and the fights look like that repetitious fighting in Arkham.
LOL, I love how Black Canary just came out of nowhere! I died right there!
Happy to be one of the few subscribers. Love the levity of your honest trailers. The blank screen gag was funny. And the Aw, c'mon line was hilarious!!.
Oh man I lost it at the "Colin Farrell seeing a version of him from daredevil" 🤣🤣🤣
That Supercuts ad 💯
The Batman movie was so boring and dull. I seriously struggled to watch it to the end.
Can’t believe he didn’t mention Tim Drake being in the movie 😋
Glad I missed it
The Thundercats reference made me laugh more than it should have
You made the one joke I wanted. Druig sucks.
Why would you go into a sunken building during a flood?
I liked and I’m already subscribed - just felt the vibe like you would want to know that information
That was a super cut. It wasn’t just a cut ,it was a super cut.
😎
This movie is a disgrace to the society. A total dissappointment of DC i think the era cannot do anything better from 20 30 year olds other than visual effects.
Never Like, Never Subscribe 😹
Another crap actor playing Batman. How stupid.
Yes we want movie fight
"Gerard Wayne" 🤣🤣🤣
I can't see anything
Clown teenagers not brown teenagers.
Can’t wait to see this on an OLED screen one day
Is really no one going to talk about the fact that they built a city with it's streets and foundations BELOW THE SEA LEVEL? 🤣
"Druig sucks"
ridiculously long is an understatement. i fell asleep twice but still found it to be a good movie. ill gladly watch it again
I am Part of the High Class 10%. Damn Right!
catwoman black and not berry is disgusting
I literally got an ad for supercuts before the video started and then I get an ad for supercuts in the beginning of the video
Just popping in to say I successfully arrested a murderer, also, for me, please do Ski School 1 and 2.
Fun fact- despite the idea most people have in their heads of each city, it actually rains more here in NY than it does in Seattle each year. So, points for accuracy 👌
"Some brown teenagers are playing the knockout game" - Weird race baiting, they were mostly white.
Mention movie fights? That's gonna get you a Like.
Come on, excluding the last unnecessary 40-50 minutes, it was a very good movie
Please dear god let them do the Mad Hatter or Zazsz next
My favorite Batman comics have him be a great detective, a great person who cares deeply about others AND an inspiring hero whose superpower is how brave and determined he is. I have enjoyed several Batman movies (Tim Burton's, Begins and The Dark Knight, even some parts of Forever and bits of Baffleck's portrayal) but they always seem to cut a chunk of his personality: either the detective part, the human part or the hero part. To me, The Batman was an okay-ish film noir with a plot that went to pieces by the end, it was not a heroic story although I did enjoy the "I've got to try" line, and Bruce Wayne never showed up in the entire movie.   I don't need yet another Joker movie. Instead, it would be nice to get an actual Batman movie - not a deconstruction of the superhero genre, not an edgy take, just the version of Batman readers have loved for so many decades. But hey, "Nevermind", I will just rewatch The Animated Series, Beyond and Under the Red Hood.
Anyone know what the guitar riff in the video is I know the song but cannot think of the name and it’s killing me haha
Can the narrator say "Next time find a planet that can handle the Neutron style"
MovieFights!!!!!!
that movie looks Dummer than a bag of hammers...
3:48 except the previous pronunciation was the CORRECT Italian way. This new pronunciation is off.
Shovel Face has come a long way!
A Dr strange parody of a SUPERCUTS commercial...nice...
Moustache division lol
Hey I watch all your stuff and never like and I'm so sorry.
Honestly I've got nothing against the movie but for once I would like to actually see the movie.
Wait. Did I catch a Venture Brothers reference in there?
"Darker than that. Even darker. Darkerrrr. That's just a black scene" 😭😭😭
Please say:  YOU CAN MAKE IT DIFFERENT YOU CAN MAKE IT RIGHT YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT!
Meh most forgettable cat woman ever
Why does Catwoman's mask look so dumb in this? She covers her NOSE and perks up the top to make ears? 🤦🏻‍♀️
I will subscribe if you
It's a really really really really ridiculously long Batman movie 🎬  Thank you Screenjunkies for mentioning this.
we want movie fights obviously. MOVIE FIGHTS
Catwoman's goal is to take down privileged white men by teaming up with a privileged white man
honest trailer for peacemaker
Starring Gerard Wayne from My Chemical Romance
I'm not wearing hockey pads.
I watched 6 mins of this movie and then watched the Food Network.
1:01 Lmao MLP
Didn't you mean 1 part NYC and 8 parts Portland??  (& i honestly thought it was Twinknight for the title at first glance lol!)
GERARD WAYNE
Please do Dr Strange MOM Honest trailer 😜
"There's no time Alfred! Some brown teenagers playing the knockout game! Now hand me my stun glove!"  LMAO!! 😆🤣😆  Best. Intro. Ever! Like a ghostly, cowboy walking knight acting like Darth Vader.
5:11 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You must've meant to say a gang of white teenagers playing the knockout gang and encouraging a brown teen to punch an Asian but he refuses.  You know. Just like real life.
If David Fincher made Batman tbh.
Opinion:  This movie was boring.
Bring back the screen junkies show
This just makes me want to watch The Batman again.
An acknowledgment of Movie fights! Don’t play with our emotions! **insert It’s been 84 years**
For the sequel Ik Mister Freeze is the top pick, but the Phantasm would be so damn good in this universe
This movie was so overhyped. It was okay but isn’t a classic
The Twiknight Saga 😂😂
THIS MOVIE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIIUIIIIIUUUIIJUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED
The best part of how long this movie was that I didn't even notice.
Why is the entire video black?
Now do an Honest Trailer for Xena! Come on dudes!
please say "i hang batclooney poster to get fantasized with"
This movie's camera angles reminded me a lot of Adam West Batman but Edgier. Coincidentally, Riddler was the first Villian Batman faced in both series.
Sorry I haven’t subbed all this time. Don’t murder people please 😂
Really hoping next week will be either groundhog day or Halo :)
Most fruity version of the Batman ever!
My list of villains I want to see in this universe  One: Scarecrow  Two: Mr Freeze  Three: Deathstroke Four: Bane  Five: Clayface
Was a pretty decent movie. 3rd act almost ruined it. "OH BTW....IM PUTTING THE CITY UNDER WATER!! HAHAHAH" Lmfao what?? Where did that come from?
It’s time for us to see some villains we haven’t seen on the big screen, like:  Scarface, the Mad Hatter, or Professor Pig.
MOVIE FIGHTS!!!
Honestly, I’m all batmaned out.
I'm pretty sure that's still not the right way to pronounce Falcone, not to mention they still pronounce his first name like minecart backwards.
I watched the movie just so I could watch this video. This was one of the best and worst batman movies 😂. I loved the the fact that it was more of a detective movie and there was finally a story indirectly involving thomas wayne. I loved the movie until the falcone arc. The riddler was also amazing until then however I do wish the last arc involved riddler in some way instead of just being locked up in Arkham. Some fight scenes were awesome whereas some felt a bit cartoonish. All in all a solid 7.5.
Batfleck look so intimidating
How long do we get to see an honest trailer for DC legends of tomorrow?
ok i liked and subscribed just don't make me do Riddler stuff alright!!
My biggest gripe with this movie is the sound quality was awful . Tv almost on full volume and still not able to understand the dialogue. Then explosion and gotta turn sound back down… like watching tv in the 90s all over again
Missed out 1 part Glasgow hahaha
The academy wants batman
Please say: na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na Batman!!!!!!
Of course Officer Martinez knew about the tucker carpet tool
Can u do turning red, the bad guys
I couldn't stop laughing after hearing 'Druig Sucks' 🤣. Perfect timing lol.
This was all I ever wanted
I like the old ones better.
Can you do Osmosis Jones?
So, how long did it take Batman to figure out that "Rat with wings" = "flying rat" = "flying mouse" = Fledermaus = BAT?
How long it will get rebooted  another 2 or 3 bad movies
You stole that black screen joke from Ryan George, you hacks.
bring back drunk movie fights!!!
Why don't you mention how they keep pushing the interracial agenda?
Do you guys still put the Allen raptor in these vids?
Honestly I was sorta hoping the Honest Title for the movie was going to be "Yet Another Goddam Batman", which is a reference to the always ridiculed Frank Miller book, and the epic voice guy's frustration of having to introduce another constantly rebooted Batman.
3:44 "I have no notes."  Day9 callback?
I can't wait for the sequel "The The Batman". A trilogy would be cool too..."The The The Batman"
OK OK OK, I'm subcribed!!
Bringing back the goth in gotham cracked me up 😂😂😂
Please say or more acurately SING the featured verse from the batman theme song... IN.. YOUR.. EPIC.. VOOOICE
MOVIE FIGHTS! YES! PLEASE! YES!
Yes…. Murders
Put the goth back in Gotham lol
A good nickname for Gordon would be Neil To Bats Tyson 😁
Insert obligatory Robert Pattison "Vampire Bat" joke here :3
Shot Caller 2017
Please do turnings red next!
The funny thing is I watched this movie just yesterday and didn't have wait a month for a honest trailer
Say - "I wish i am hello! kiddo "
The originality of the origin story itself is lacking for sure.  That’s a common theme among material over the last several years, but this one got a lot of grief for it here.  Might be a compliment to the franchise - a lot of parallel concepts (Wolverine, Superman, Skywalker... Marvel, DC Comics, Disney...) are simply regurgitating the same heroes that data collection dictates merchandise should deliver (Spaceballs ;)).  But yeah, Batman was unoriginal, you’re on the right track.
Waiting for The Superman
Do the cornetto trilogy next
Screenies! We want screenies!
😭😂💀
Please do a honest trailer for Pixar’s Turning Red.
Only thing I didn’t like was the villain. The acting of riddler was great, don’t get me wrong. It’s just how they decided to execute his character. Always behind a screen, felt kinda disconnected.  And the final battle was against some random thugs which felt very, very underwhelming. I enjoyed the movie A LOT, but I can’t help but imagine how greater it could’ve been with a proper execution of a villain.
….Movie Fights….
a solid 7/10 movie for me. enjoyed it thoroughly.
I got a better one for Bruce Wayne... Bruce Kurtko Wayne
R-Bat is Best Bat
Another movie where all the villains are White men.
Say: “…because I’m Batman!” (How it Should Have Ended style.)
With out the original gang movie fight is not  the same
This was a beautiful honest trailer🤣
This movie was so garbage
Man I was really looking forward to see what y’all were gonna do with the over playing of “Something in the way” 😔
Background music song title at 1:32?
DRESS LIKE A GARBAGE BAG LOL
How are we supposed to see anything in this movie? Seriously!
He's a millennial though
Worst Batman selection for the worst Batman movie yet!
Finally suit without nipples
I like the gen z commentary bc that's facts 💯 🤧 😌
I’m so traumatized I 100% heard “featuring James Corden” 3:10
First time I've watch a movie that was 3 hours long.
When the Supercuts ad is better than the product...
We want cobra Kai season 4
Now also republicans have their Batman.
Gosh this movie was fucking boring.
One thing I wasn't thrilled about was the Riddler, he seemed less like the Riddler and more of a Copy of The Zodiac killer. Then you got My Chemical Bruce.
I had really really ridiculously no idea a new batman film was out
The gentleman honest trailer!!! Do it!!
Thumb...drive... U...R...L... Great detecting there.
Ok so that Supercuts ad ripped off the Council of Ricks from Rick and Morty.  Just sayin.
Movie: "a rat with wings" Me: "It's definitely a bat."    Batman: *"it's a falcon"*
this looks fucking terrible
"But... is it good?"
The daredevil movie movie caught a stray bullet for no reason 🤣🤣🤣
if Honest Trailers was its own channel, I’d subscribe
Big question: Why did this movie have Riddler acting so much like Anarky?
God this movie was so long, you're giving me traumatic flashbacks to how much I hated watching this movie.
"You're not my father!" Hahahahahaha Who the eff wrote this script?!
“Capes together strong” was just *chef’s kiss* 😂
Professor Pyg, or Hugo Strange I think would be good in this universe
We want murders
Batman should take down supercuts because the way they cut hair is a crime
This movie was terrible.
Please say "Elmo and Homer Simpson eat black spaghetti. Cha-cha-cha!"
Did he really though? This movie is so dramatized and emo it just feels like the male version of the Twilight movie. And quite literally male since there are barely any women in it.
Yes. Movie fights
The "e" in Falcone is suppose to be pronounced (unless you're a dirty savage from New York and forget that vowels are pronounced at the end of Italian words).
It’s one of the movies that you could recommend to anyone because like it or not, you will still enjoy the movie nevertheless  Kinda felt like the Riddler movie rather than the Batman movie though…
Can you do "The Office"?
The Batman may be the most decisive Batflick since Batman and Robin. There were parts of the Batman I liked, and some parts I definitely did not like. Batman "weaponizing" the darkness was an interesting device, but the Caped Crusader shouldn't have done things like that crazy Batmobile chase with the Penguin. Kept thinking, Batman would pull back and not put all those bystanders in possible jeopardy. Liked the Detective aspects to it, but definitely not the intense darkness to it.
Stupid movie.
I thought it was _The Twinknight Saga_ .
By adding the word "the"😂👍
Man, I was really hoping Epic Voice Guy mentions all the dramatic walking, dramatic head turning and dramatic pauses between sentences.
You haven't done Uncharted  .
I was so excited for the movie... was 15 maybe 20 mins into it and left.... I am a huge DC/Marvel Fan.... It was just sad.
I don't remember disliking this movie...I just can not remember any of its plot. Like yes Batman and Robin was awful and haven't seen it in 20 years but I still remember what happened in it.
This Batman was extremely incompetent, so disappointing.
Long neck batman
We want murders, murders will get a sub
Please do a honest trailer about Bojack Horseman, the best show on Netflix!
I wish it was longer I was bricked up all through it
Really, three pitches for other content in one episode?
😎
0:48 I don't know if that was intentional, but that's literally a scene from The LEGO® Batman Movie. A black screen (and Batman talking about the screen being black).
I still couldn't finish this new batman! LoL
Do the Muppets! And Muppets most wanted
Don’t you dare tease us with Movie Fights and not follow through
i’m a content creator and i can only get 5% engagement so you’re doing pretty well actually
God maybe people are bad at watching movies...
That bit about getting us to Like and Subscribe had me to do both! Sorry Screen Junkies, I thought I had subscribed. Oy vey
Please say "it so dark that i have to turn my phone brightness to the max"
I want the Honest Ad for supercuts.
Say: "Mm, I love this one. My old man gave it to me."
Okay that Colin Farrell one was the best joke you've done in years.
It's the knockoff Nirvana music for me lol
BATCHEST
It lacked action for a 3 hr movie imo
God I miss movie fights
The bit about the dead truck drivers is my "biggest" problem about the movie. Why does Penguin get to walk away from that scot free?
That “Druig sucks!” made my day.
1:25 If by "Seattle" you mean "London"
Movie fights!!
I had on by pass on this movie . Sorry
The bat man was super Long
2:00 yes. bring it back
He's supposed to 30 years old, that makes him a millennial my guy.
Why is there no mention that every actor in this movie was playing acting in slow motion, hence why this slow movie is 3 hours long?
The actor they chose for joker is the worst they could of picked
Honestly, the Joker deleted scene was genius having him blurred and a confidante for solving others mental game. Would work well in the movie if they kept it in and removed the tease at the end
Movie fightsss
Please say  *Give a monkey a brain and he'll think he's the center of the universe*  in your awesome voice.
I laughed really hard at the "Druig Sucks" bit. thank you for that.
Sequel? Mr. Freeze Please.
Cat Woman -- at least according to what we saw in the movie -- wasn't bi.  The girl she kept in her apartment was a victim she was trying to hide, not a girlfriend that just happened to find herself in danger.
Someone say movie fights?? 👀
"Just going to walk that off? Okay."  I am so sick and tired of writers/directors thinking that by wearing a protective suit, it will protect someone from bone-crushing impacts. I could wear a bullet-proof vest, but if I fell off a moving vehicle I'd be seriously injured (if not killed).
People think Gen Z is worse off than the last generation? Lol.
Ironically, this honest trailer was indeed the most honest review of the movie that I've seen so far. The investigation part, especially. I thought I was the only one who noticed how dumb this Batman is. And I understand is just his second year, but come on, is the first time where he's actually a detective in these films, couldn't we get a smarter Bruce then? He can be inexperienced and smart at the same time, but this was not the case. I mean, Jesus, a few years ago we had origin movies where the hero was already a badass one hour in, now we have basic character traits being completely dragged to fully appear only in the end of a trilogy.  None of that means the movie is bad, by the way. I liked it. But I won't overpraise it just because of two or three perfect scenes, even less when the whole thing is that long lol.
This movie really is full of talking and no fights, when they fight, the scene is so dark i cant see
I started watching it last night and lost interest in30 minutes.
5:11 lmao
okay hear me out, what if at the end of the trilogy, he becoms The Batman Who Laughs? guys who know will know
Mustache division. Bahahahahahahahahahaha
Matt Reeves needs to do a Psychological Drug Fueled Thriller Batman with Mad Hatter & Scarecrow. I'm totally down to see Batman get F'd up and Trippin
Where is Peacemaker?
Son, Bruce! Pick up every pearl. They went all over the place, don't lose a single one or I won't love you when I'm in Heaven. They're expensive Bruce, they're fucking pearls! Pick 'em all up. I love you Bruce but I loved pearls first, so pick 'em up, pick 'em up Bruce.
A barrista's since of flair 😆
terrible, LONG, boring, pointless movie.  Can we stop with this 5 hours long movies trend?
nailed it and how did he not make the connection about the rat with wings. Penguin has wings lol.
Do Dr. Strange 2
Awesome
Love that batmobile
Do Sonic the Hedgehog 2 please?
A fantastic Batman movie!!
Epic Voice Guy doing murder??….yeah, I would go ahead and like/sub for that
MOVIE. FIGHTS.
I generally liked the movie, the only criticism I can give is: Why they choose that stupid sock for cat burglar?!
I fell asleep in the theater to this movie . . which usually always means it's good and I'll love it the second time. Didn't work for Indiana Jones 4 though.
impressive self control guys. Only gave us two twilight jokes
Yes, we do want Movie Fights! I'll resubscribe for Movie Fights
I really didn't care much for this batman. He was too angsty for my taste
The movie sucks , period.
Okay imo best batflick yet
So... you were afraid to rip this garbage to shreds eh? I expected more. A half hour of this movie was just lingering on out of focus shots, Bruce is an incompetent fascist, the copaganda is rancid, and the plot is just Seven with everything dramatically compelling removed.
Darker than darkety darkest Uber night 😂
I’ll believe they truly perfected the gritty Batman the moment they truly nail a powered villain in the modern live action movies. Like its fun doing “mad man with a plan”. But Poison Ivy? Give us some weird powers
The Riddler in this movie is what if Jigsaw Killer is a Twitch Streamer
well when he was a young boy, his father took him into the city to see the marching band
Druig Suck 🤣
I am glad I am not the only one who thought it rained way too much in Gotham in this movie. That said, I liked it. Especially how it was more a detective film fitting for Batman.
Great movie. It just was.
I don't get why everyone is going crazy from this movie, I found it slow and boring. I almost fell asleep
The black man 😆
Not a single Shovel Face reference. FAIL.
Do The Bad Guys finally
What does a guy gotta do to get a Sonic 2 trailer?????
Can you do honest trailer of attack on Titan please
Please say, "I have goats, IN MY PANTS"!
The Vig Lebowski. That’s it, I’m done
Nirvana amplified this movie to another level
Druig is awesome!
I was waiting for a pun or mention to nostalgia critic
Mustache division. lol
Was 'The Batman' meant to be a bleak black & pinkish grey movie?...if so then...umm...good job I guess!? What could have been great never will be...just, look how depressed a billionaire can be.
Starring section rocked.
You read my son's comment  at the end and I am pretty sure everyone in my zip code is now suffering from hearing loss.
It's a great movie if you have insomnia.
Say "I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"
Now I have the Batman theme stuck in my head.
This movie was virtually flawless  People that didn't like it just have LOW attention spans.
I got a "Doctor Strange" um I mean "Doctor Weird" commercial for Supercuts the first time I watched this. Awesome.
5:11 the perfect edit 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would love to see Firefly or even Man-Bat in this universe. It would give this Batman an enemy that would push him to further improve and develop his suits gliding capabilities. A flying villain would also allow for the potential development of the batwing.
It should be noted that Robert Pattinson is a millenial.
And part liverpool
I feel like this movie would lead well into the War of Joke and Riddles
Should have titled it 'Detective Batman'.
Don't go to supercuts.  Support an independent barber.
Really though they were gonna still call him Shovel Face.
"No? Just gonna walk that off?" 🤣
Background music sounds like Nirvana instrumentals, what's the name of the song??
I for one would like to call attention to the incredible fight/action scenes in this movie. No shakey handheld camera, minimal cuts, and actual martial arts
2:58 SONG NAME??
That mustache division line and cut away absolutely killed me.
Scrawny Batman with his Magic Bullet Proof, Immortal, Fighting Suit.  I thought we were supposed to be done with Twilight Nonsense.
Yes. Movie Fights.
Incelsior! and "Druig sucks!" had me 🤣😂!
Still holding up hope the sequel will be a straight-up monster flick with Man-Bat.
INCELsior - oh that's gold
The thing I hate about this movie it is not rated r when are we going to get a rated r Batman movie
The writing was so laughable. Among the numerous times the Batman almost died was when the neck bomb timer was ticking down and he didn’t even think to take cover before it hit zero? Nope. Gonna stand one inch away and go boom. So dumb.
Moustache division got me
Please say: evil beware we have waffles.
When are we gonna see Calendar Man???
Wait, Batman's inhuman ability is how he's mental fortitude is invincible but still physically a venerable human while this version is the opposite?
Not your best video, also that black screen joke feels like you stole from Pitch Meeting.
The Batman's biggest influence is THE CROW. Think about it, a gothy edge lord wanders around a dirty, rainy, run down, urban center, looking for bad guys to enact revenge.
If the vfx on that fall is what this movie has to offer, then I know it’s not worth my time. Corridor Crew could do 10x better
Batman? No, that's too obvious. Oh no, where's Robin? 🤣🤣🤣 Biggest laugh you gave me.   Also, I am boycotting YouTube by not voting on any videos since getting rid of downvote counts. I am subscribed though 😊
Not for nothing, but how about Peacemaker
Gerard Wayne is too fine of a pun to be ignored
“Fal-Kohn-Ey” is how to pronounce his name. The other movies got it right, this one got it wrong.
do seinfeld
The Joker "This town needs an enema!"  The Riddler "Give me 32 years."
I'm pretty sure you already said 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room' like ten years ago.
I like that they made Gordon ethnic. I dont know why he just felt more Gordon to me because of this lol
SuperCuts sucks...don't let this ad fool you.
Please do an honest trailer for the Gotham TV series
do an honest trailer the bad guys   the zootopia where humans are not instinct yet
Peacemaker next?
Come on. No SOMETHING IN THE WAY
Movie fights!!!!!!!  No notes to the beginning of the movie  Bat mobile rev up scene
I love how this video has music that's vaguely similar to a lot of Nirvana songs. It's a nice touch
No one likes shills thats why.
Now funny would be Alfred telling Bruce he has been shorting Wayne stock for years and now owns the company
Selena is hotter in the wig.
You know what's funny? Since Joker was shoved into everywhere recently, we think that we had enough of him. When really, we never had him at all. I think this version of the Joker will finally be similar to the iconic one from the Arkham games  Although of course, we should hold off on Joker and bring in more underrated Rogues. A accurately venomed Bane that's both terrifying and matches Batman's wit, bringing in the horror element with Scarecrow or Clayface, Mr Freeze's tragic story fully fleshed out, or even Poison Ivy's plant horror while bringing in social commentary like Riddler did, so much potential!  My personal favorite picks would be Mr Freeze, Court of Owls for Batman to find deeper corruption than Falcone ever reached layer by layer while having a kickass Talon fight scene, and last but not least...The Ventriloquist. It would be so disturbing and somewhat terrifying
1:58 YES, Bring the Movie Fights back
Good movie, should have ended with the arrest of Riddler and let the bombs going off be the start of the next movie.
I’d have to respectfully recommend ATTACK ON TITAN!
😂😂😂😂😂✌ Batman was hella tight!
Movie Fights!!!
If only DC would look at their other heroes and make a movie for them. I tire of the Batman films.
This film is *gorgeous* - you hit the nail on the head with your "really, really, ridiculously good-looking" comment. Sonically it's pretty flawless too... Plot-wise it's pretty meh unfortunately.
Finally the batman has a sexy butler
1:01 thank you!
Everythining Everywhere All At Once!!!
Kurt Cobwayne lmao
Like, c'mon. Don't be afraid of Artemis. Do us justice!
This movie is an utter insult to the franchise, don't deny it, Epic Voice Guy.
Still working on bringing an Artemis Fowl honest trailer?
He did like one or two detective stuff and that was it. I fell for the hype and was completely letdown. I'm surprised you didn't mention him believing everything that everyone says. From the Penguin to Falcone. Although that chase scene was awesome, it was completely unnecessary when he realized Penguin wasn't the rat. So Batman probably killed a couple of civilians during that chase.
This did the film, justice.
lmao!!! Ya he is the hot batman.. daaaamn right.
Yes we do want murders lol
I died when you said Colin watching the old daredevil movie and the penguin reaction!!! Dude I can’t even!!!!! What are you showing me!!!!
Here's a compliment for the movie that few people mention: It had one of the best Hollywood car chases ever! It felt grounded and somewhat realistic, quite tense. The Batmobile itself had a horror element to it with that roaring engine at the start, a proper extension of Batman himself! Making it my favorite Batmobile already despite it's simplistic design
Ahhh you mess the part "he's the most invincible Batman that took explosion to the face and 12 gauge shotgun blast to the chest point blank" or you can say why does he need to jump on the rope and cut it with batarang while he could just throw it or andy serkis reference to Gollum or the hire the most Americans man to be an Italian man
4th dc movie im not gonna watch, the suicide squad, the snyder cut, wonderwoman 1984, and this the batman.
Movie fiiiiiiiiiights
Is this moonfall?
Of course the man who "played" Peter Jackson's Gollum is going to be good at solving riddles...
He is 30, a millenial.
Na na na Batman!!!
Wow ... this movie looks absolutely terrible. I'm so glad I never watched it.
3:47, Oh I disagree. The correct way to pronounce Falcone is "Fal-con-ey" not "Fal-cone"
Say "And frankly Jean Claude, I don't give a Van Damme"
LOL!!!    “Weird Fetish Goth.”     That’s what got me laughing.     😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏
I started watching this movie on Monday and twelve hours later I finished it.
"Incelsior" has to be the most savage name you've ever attributed to a character
I’m already subscribed, but would resubscribe if you did The Crow (and it made you feel better)
You HAVE to do “The unbearable weight of a massive talent!” That movie is perfection
This movie was boring..
I'd love to see Calendar Man and Professor Pyg in the next one
Druig Sucks 😂
Druig sucks.
Can't wait for The "The Batman"
the end was the best! 😂😂
"Capes together, strong!" 🤣
Well Riddler does flood the city so  cleanup the streets step one complete I guess…
"...what are ya showing me here?? ahhh! cmon!!" 😂😂😭😭😭
Sequel - ANYONE BUT JOKER!!!!!
Please say: "Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2? Can't wait to see it.. AIGHT?"    or    "Keep my wife's name out ya flipping do-hickey darn it mouth!"
Plz do sonic the hedgehog 2
Riddles might help
"Gotham Police Mustache Division". Hahahaha
Please say, "I feel like an angel baby, swaddled in a cacoon of cloud candy."
Not scarecrow for second part save him. Have joker and Mr freeze
Alfred definitely needs more screen time in the batman 2
5:11
Did anyone else feel like the Riddler looked like the gimp from Pulp Fiction
My fiance asked me how I liked the sparkly bat movie?
i enjoyed the "detective" approach but the story itself is too stupid, too straightforward and cheesy. it does not worth 3 hours.
Why does he say "brown teenagers"? Oddly specific. Was that gang even entirely brown?
You know, Robert Pattinson's 35. He's near the top of Millennial age, and thus way closer to X than Z.
Ridiculously good? It’s hot garbage
Here's that like you were begging for
I liked the inclusion of Joker, but not the actor.
I liked planet of ape movies, but this was too dark, too long, too boring
This movie was boring. Batman is done tell me why I should care about the character no charisma. Love a ThunderCats reference
5:17 *“Capes Together Strong”* Ok that one got me xD
I CACKLED when he dropped in that joke about Colin's sextape😂
All my 13 year old kept asking was why Batman was so Emo?
I'm getting too old for these.
i havent really care about the movie the riddler clues are plain and boring
I know Movie Fights is never coming. Don't you dare try to give me hope!
"The Twiknight Saga"...I see what you did there; funny 🙄
Tried watching this movie twice and fell asleep both times lol. I'm really trying but it's so slow and angsty
Honest Trailer Guy.  Please say:  "SHAGGY-DEE... SHAGGY-DEE... SHAH-POE-POE."
Y'know, this movie was 3 hours long, but felt like it wasn't...  ...then you bring up that moment when Batman just slowly walks toward those gangbangers and you realize just how long it really is.
Ngl if you guys start murdering people, you'll definitely get more subscribers
oh man the 1 part new york 8 parts seattle got me
The altered Heart Shaped Box is awesome
Wow, this movie really wrote its own honest trailer didn't it?
This is some of your finest work.
yep, the slow walk was really tiresome
"They finally said Carmine Falcone's name right."  No they didn't. It's a real surname with an established pronunciation. In fact, Batman Begins was closer to the actual pronunciation, cause you're supposed to pronounce the vowel sound at the end. They just used the wrong vowel sound.  It's Fal-koh-nay.  Not Fal-koh-nee, not Fal-CONE, it's Fal-koh-nay.
One of the worst movies ever
Week 38 of asking for Honest TV Trailer for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
Please do an Honest Trailer for SPAWN The Animated Serie's.! This May 16th is the 25th Year Anniversary of this amazing adult animation & 1 of the absolute best comic book adaptation of all time.!
After watch tennet i understand why Robbert Pattinson is batman. After reading and seeing the positive review and high rating which make want to watch it but after my brother saw it in the Cinema and say they disappointed with the movie, Robbert Pattinson performance remind them of twilight and not tennet because of emo batman character, alfred doesnt really like alfred. I disbelief of what they say until i say the movie and i was really disappointed, 3hour boring movie XD. Christine Bell version still the perfect batman movies
You know I kinda miss the yellow in the bat suit and the whole bad guy shot at his chest because of it explanation so he doesn't get head shoted.
This was the best live action batman. Just on how realistic they made Batman himself. Most people don’t know the year two story so they hate on how he doesn’t have everything gadget wise
This film only made me wish for a fourth Nolan/Bale movie. It was a completely one and done affair for me. It wasnt bad, but I'll never watch it again.
Please make an Honest Trailer for Rubber!
I'm surprised the name for the Penguin wasn't something to do with De Niro's Al Capone character. I say that because it seemed to me like that was a big influence on the character.
Come on guys,  don't bring up movie fights if you aren't going to bring it back properly
Great film, although I can't help feeling like it would be better were it 30 minutes shorter
Should be called, depressed batman
This was the first take on the Bruce/Alfred relationship that wasn't totally perfect and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I look forward to more Robert Pattinson Batman movies.
Please do Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009)
Twiknight Saga -- that explains it all.
Next DC movie: THE SUPERMAN
Too many holes, who gets shot then able to walk through waste deep water, or when does Batman, a master strategist go into a fight he won't win.. unless a diverse character can. The Riddler, is not that menacing..   It was okay, then got worse and worse and should have ended before the flood..
Please make an Honest Trailer for "All of Us Are Dead".
This was good, but I thought the Pitch Meeting version was more on point XD
Gerard WAYne😂😂
Meh.
This just felt like a movie no one asked for. Like why?
I’m glad mister narrator man is also upset about ANOTHER Joker. There’s so much more to Batman than woohoo wacky clown man
Yes please Movie Fights!!! I miss everyone and everything about it.
Dude watch "Gotham" if you want to see how Reallife Actors of Bruces Parents getting killed lol. Weird fetish!
I had very low desire to see this movie.  This, and that crappy joker pushed it at a firm 0%
Still not interested in watching SparkleBat in Hot Topic.
Bring movie fights back!!
rubber mask man
Actually, in Nolan's Batman, Falcone is pronounced the Italian way, ergo, the correct way.
Honest Trailer for "Everything Everywhere All at Once", pretty please!
I woke up during surgery once and it was better than this movie
I liked because you said Movie Fights
Loved the Gerard Wayne and Druig Sucks bits.
Mivie fights please!!
For the next video, please say: “I suppose there must come a time when a god stoops down to the level of a conquerer”
do percy jackson
Finally someone makes fun of how slow he walks
0:46 THATS SUPER GOOD VOICE ACTING
Please do 'Bubble' next.
Yes Movie Fights!!!
Annnnnd....... 'Druig sucks'!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Do Emo Batman!!"  Oh, wait. . .
Its weird I had 0 expectations from this movie and I ended enjoying every minute of it.
Glad I sat this one out, can't wait to find out who will play Batman next
Why didn't screen junkies make fun of the WOKEness in the movie , I mean, What a message to send to the kids of this generation... White people = Bad Black/Asian/Russian people = Good Imagine a Man , a BatMan who taught 90's kids about loss, fear and pain, Is Teaching the current generation kids about identity Politics and how one group of people is better than other
The twiknight saga😭😭😭
There is a lack of Se7en references in this
Our Flag Means Death trailer 👀?
Meh
Damn. This is a legit bat honest trailer. Are you guys bankrupt of ideas? Tiss tiss
Yes Movie Fights!
Bring back movie fights!!!
I don’t mind the new Joker
This movie was so damn good.
Should have done a crossover with HISHE for this one.
Please do Peacemaker Honest Trailer now, please now?
I thought the title would be: "Something In The Wayne" 🤣
The reason I don't subscribe is simple, and I can't be alone: I like Honest Trailers but I don't like Screen Junkies' other stuff. I subscribed once and my YouTube feed had a load of videos that I wasn't interested in. That is annoying. It's easier for me to just look up "honest trailer" every Tuesday. If you made an Honest Trailers channel (like Pitch Meetings finally did), then you'd have my subscription in a heartbeat. It's low-hanging fruit! Do it!
Na na Na na na na  Vampire Batman! He Sparkles...
I don't want to encourage anything crazy buuuuuut....  If yall said to like and sub or else you'd murder someone you were holding hostage, I'd probably laugh like it's some sorta dark joke... Then I'd like and sub just to be safe.   Also, that one deleted scene with the joker from this movie was better than literally every bit of Leto's joker combined.
Always rooting for DC but regret going to the cinema to watch this movie. 3 hours of my life wasted. Should have waited to stream instead. To each his own...
I'm honestly getting sick of people referring to his work in JUST Twilight. Even Pitch Meeting joked about how people keep forgetting he was in competent movies too. Like for Pete's sake, the Twilight movies are a DECADE OLD NOW!
Love the nod to the Emo Dad YouTube series at 3:01.
Goth back in Gotham 🤣🤣🤣🤣
that supercuts ad would be great in a big short video
this movie is so boring
Very very good one guys! S2
I get why people liked this movie, and I do think it's style is beyond amazing but man I was so bored
*“The Riddler, a guy who talks big about cleaning up the city or someone dressed like a garbage bag. He’ll do more to stop corruption than Batman ever had with nothing but a roll of duct tape, a barista’s sense of flare, and the most hardcore followers ever. “*  You gotta love Honest, man 😂
The Gotham Police--- moustache division.
I’m surprised 😮 no thought Colin Farrell’s penguin/ Oz acted ALOT like Robert DeNiro.
Say Batman gets his hair cut at Supercuts
DO CHILDS PLAY 2019!  The new Chucky show is fantastic, that movie was garbage! & say, "Hi, I'm Chucky, I'm your friend till the end.  Hidy Ho. ha ha ha"
Say "Things just got out of hand."
Let me say from the start... I don't like Robert Pattinson. He looks and acts like he should be playing a VILLIAN not Batman. What is DC even thinking at this point? Let me guess... the Marvel movies are awesome, let's NOT do that. ???
You guys are stupid. They'll never film the Wayne's death scene.
MAKE AN HONEST TRAILER OF WILLOW!
I'd love to see the Court of Owls in the next one with Penguin continuing his rise.  Movie Fights would be cool 😆
It really did not need to be that long.
I’m glad they mentioned the amount of rain in the movie. It’s literally always raining in Gotham.
2:38 Actually the Penguin did that. Batman was trying to catch him.
Fckng great movie and trailer too!
😊Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  Everything Everywhere All At Once.  🙃
Please do already an honest trailer for the movie "Nobody"!
Wait... you're bring back movie fights?
*Why aren't you gonna do an honest trailer for the movie "Idiocracy"?*
Was anyone else expecting Detective Mills and Somerset(from Se7en) to appear in this movie?
robert pattinson is so hot
This was EASILY the BEST Batman movie ever made. By a substantial margin. Kind of surprised H.T. ragged on it so hard. I was hoping for a positive review like the one H.T. did for B.T.A.S. This definitely made it so I wont watch that "kiss from a bat" thing they uploaded along with this. Just my 2 cents.
Skinny wimp playing Batman looks good (not).
for once i actually watched a (pirated) version of the movie before your trailer . .
🤣🤣🤣amazing vid! Especially The Twinight 😂 better title for a very,very,very,very,very, long Batman movie 😑🥱😴
Nailed it again! This movie sucked and now with Discovery buying WB, I bet this doesn't go any further.
Thank you for this trailer. This batman sucks. Why are we stopping a guy who kills people who are invincible from justice? That's an anithero not a villain. Much like the punisher or moonknight😆😆😆😆
Wait what exactly was Riddler’s goal after killing Falcone?
ROAD HOUSE HONEST TRAILER!!!
"he is worse off than his parents and his city will soon be under water". They should have sprinkled in some nuclear war dangers and that would be the most contemporaneous Batman movie ever lol
Don’t feel too bad man you have over 1000 subscribers I only have 6
Rat with Wings. Doves.
Colin watching the Daredevil movie🤣
This version of the film needs to be the extended edition and they need to release a shorter version with less dialogue for subsequent viewings
The Supercuts add Is that the guy from the Warp zone that’s so cool
I wasn't really expecting much from The Batman but it was awesome 🦇
Saw this movie a few weeks ago and I'd already forgotten...well, pretty much all of it.
Darker Darker! DARKER! That's just a Black Screen... There We Go!  My gawd that was legit boss type ish!
4:54 “oh come onnn!!!” yess I felt that. So ridiculous that you have to put a new version of the Joker in every single Batman movie these days.
I'm just surprised there wasn't a single Nostalgia Critic joke
Gerade Wayne! 😂😂😂😂😂 I miss him and My Chemical Romance..🥰🥰
I was waiting for the "Robert 🦇 BATtinson" on the Starring part
0:35
"Where's Robin?" Well, Tim Drake from Titans was on the subway car. So, there's one
careful almost told a joke
MOVIE FIGHTS!
The Joke about Farrell and the Daredevil Movie was GOLD
Can't believe you didn't call him Shovelface !
lol. thats my only complaint about the film is the couple of preachy notes. oh noes white man bad. oh noes dont go and riot and try to solve a corrupt system yourself stay in it. lol. It was really ironic the ending.
"puts the goth back in Gotham"  Damn, I wish I had thought of that!
Please say "Collin watching Daredevil is the equivalent of Chris Evans watching The Fantastic Four"
I couldn't finish the movie.  This batman just seemed boring and Bruce Wayne seemed creepy.  I could see him being moved to Arkham.
Still think that mask is stupid.Lower part is open.Really dumb.
Return of movie fights????
Twiknight Saga . . . 😂 Also, absolutely More Movie Fights !
You should have commented on how Batman kept letting average criminals land hits in him when he’s supposed to be one of the most skilled hand to hand fighters of all time.
"Gerard Wayne" is the most underrated joke in this video. It's genius.
I really loved the movie
Love your nod to Corridor Crew's Adam West replacing Sparkle Boy video. It's some excellent work !
1:32 😂😂😂😂
I was waiting for this, lets fucking go!!
The worst buttman EVER! lol
Probably the joker from Gotham
Please say "DinoLeo23 stop asking about How I Met your mother trailer"
How i met your mother trailer!
At "Gotham City Police Department, Moustache Division" I lost it. 🤣
Why is no one talking about a peacemaker honest trailer
That last comment got you your like
Wait, are you saying that movie fights are coming back?????
Do Transformers: Dark of the Moon already!
the car was the worst part
Do Heartstopper 💟
Cheap mimic to Nolan's Batman with a emo touch 😂 masterpiece 😂
"Incelsior!" cracked me up!
"Twi-Knight" lol😆!
Forgot to show us where they came into a crime scene with no flashlights but could see just fine. To later in the movie needing flashlights to see in the same room 🤦🏻‍♂️
Finally somebody else noticed that Gordon and the not so greatest detective managed to spin four times “la rata alada” - that, drops instead of drugs and an out of nowhere fourth act absolutely made a great looking and well cast movie a sobbing bore.     Also, every single cast member probably manages to get the best characterization of their roles with the notorious exception of the Joker - it sucks, hard.
What the hell happened to this channel?
Yes Movie Fights
You should do an honest trailer for Sonic 2! Once it's out of theaters of course.
I'm just here to say that yes, we want Movie Fights back!
The twiknight saga 😭😂😂🤌🏽
If you go retro movie, do Baseketball of 1999
They shouldn't do the joker ,bro I'm tired of him ,batman has alot of rogue's gallery ,they can do court of owls,lady shiva,Etc
Movie sucked. This was not clear in your review.
THE TWIKNIGHT 😂😂😂❣️❣️❣️
2023: The Batman vs The The 2027: The The The - A The Batman Story
Bring back movie fights
PLEASE do an honest trailer for Pixar's "Turning Red" :D
How's about how Commissioner Gordon was just there to make sure the audience knows what's going on?   Great movie though
Thank you for the shoutout about Bruce Wayne’s parents getting murdered. I feel like they haven’t really portrayed that enough. I need to know why he became Batman.
Marvel: introduced alots of comic book characters into live action DC: Batman, joker, recast, batman, joker.....wait for recast again soon
I'm gonna ruffle some feathers here but this is a better Batman than the Nolan Trilogy. I have seen each of those probably 12 times and own the collector's edition and they're masterpieces but of a different variety. Those are solid films. This actually felt like a Batman run on film though. It gets it in a way Nolan couldn't.
I was never gonna watch this one but thanks for the treatment.
Definitely Movie Fights
Good movie....but Keoghan's Joker could potentially be worse than Letos.
Y'all forgot the puns
This batman wasn't even stealth
I didn’t even skip the Supercuts ad😂
He didn't kill the truck drivers or anyone in this movie.
I found it really boring but I can see why people would like it
THE TWIKNIGHT SAGA 🤣🤣🤣
Well i loved watching the honest trailers before i found the Pitch meetings. Now its kinda meh...
This movie was horrible
Please say - "Dormammu, I've come to bargain"
IS MOVIE FIGHTS COMING BACK??  Dude, I really want to see Greg from the Reel Rejects and Lee from Cinemawins!
Batman meets Seven
You missed the opportunity to call the riddler callmecarson!!!!!!
“Druig sucks”
Your Riddler threat got me to subscribe lol.
This movie had a severe case of oversaturation for DC/WB. Do TURNING RED
Worst CSI: Gotham episode ever
Don't do that... don't give us hope... Movie Fights...
I wish they could have gotten some of the actors from Gotham to play in the movie... I didn't really feel much of the acting was very strong in this one.
You forgot to mention he is the first Batman to knock on doors.
This movie sucked.
That Gerard Wayne joke fucking caught me offguard.
We need a Honest Trailer Classic for Big Trouble in Little China
Do please bring back movies fights.
I hated this movie. 👎👎👎
Okay I subscribed after 3 years of watching.
YouTube needs a like all button for all us forgetful people. We just cant focus long enough to stay long enough to push the like on each video. Now I've gotta re-watch the video because i was to busy typing and forgot to listen
This was a really cool movie, it dragged a bit sure but I still want to watch it again...when I have a few hours free.
I really wish you’ll do a Peacemaker honest trailer
"Putting the 'goth' back in 'Gotham.'" Brilliant, fellas. Brilliant.
He may be vengeance
Mustache division for the win!
Yes, we get it, SUPERCUTS 🙄
Eight parts Seattle.  💀
before i watch the honest trailer, gonna simply say that this movie sucked lol
"puts the Goth back in GOTHam" that was too good 😂
*YES*
It's the 40th anniversary for The Thing! Please do an Honest Trailer!
"almost" LMAO
“Some brown teenagers?” You’re better than that, Honest trailers.
Was I the only one that thought it said "The Twix Night Saga" at the end?
Please say "If it's too loud, you're too old!" PLEASE!
Honest theme Song for Deadpool. Deadpool Deadpool deadpool....
4:12 it's wild how you all will minimize and make excuses for everything brown people do
Incel-sior made me actually laugh out loud .
Hell yes we want movie fights!
I just got a Supercut ad BEFORE the ad in the video. Good job YouTube.
Movie Fights !!!!!!
YES! We miss Movie Fights! Hell, I’LL audition to come host (a man can dream)!  Or have epic voice guy do it!   BRING BACK MOVIE FIGHTS!
acollin Farrell watching DD movie killed me hahaha so good
anyone say movie fight??
Dredd please
the movie itself and it's ups and lows, but it have to be said, Pattison killed it.  we should stop holding twillight against him, he has proven since that he's a legit actor.
😂😆😂
lol
Don’t tease me movie fights without planning to follow through lol
Please say 'leeeeeeeeeeean'.
More Honest Trailers are on the way - The Batman, The Manbat, The Batbat, The Manman, The BatManman, The ManBatbat, The BatBatman, The ManManbat, The BatManbat, The ManBatman, The BatBatManMan, The ManManBatBat, The ManBatManBat, The BatManBatMan, The BatManManBat, The ManBatBatMan!
The song preview sounds 🔥
Warner Brothers should scrap the DCEU, and have The Batman start a Gotham Cinematic Universe. 🦇
Druig sucks. I’m Dead 💀
I still can't believe Colin Farrel played the Penguin, he did really well. So did Pattinson with the Batman role.
Do a  Condor Man Honest Trailer
Movie fights.... You narrate...?? 👀👀
Finally!!! Been waiting a long time for this Great honest trailer :D
Ok you guilted me to like and subscribe. We always like but aren't signed in on our Roku
Worst anything ever
Finally the Darkest Honest Trailer we needed is here.
great
I got a riddle for you. How does one get me to like a subscribe? I will tell you the answer after you do an honest trailer on pokemon 3 spell of the unown
No more theme songs please
MOVIE FIGHTS PLEASE.... ive watched nearly all of them multiple times now i need new ones !!!!!!
Aww I'm sorry Epic Voice Guy, but if we subscribe, then we get other Screen Junkie stuff in our recommendations. And nobody wants that.
Now I’m missing Movie Fights. 🥺
It was good, but it wasn’t the best. I Liked Nolan’s Camerawork and Use of Practical effects better. I remember walking out of Dark Knight with my mind blown 🤯, I didn’t feel that here. It felt like a lesser Long Halloween, but that doesn’t make it bad. Long Halloween is tough to live up to.
That penguin line killed me🤣🤣
Even this review can’t make this movie better
Do Clone Wars Honest Trailer
Really good looking batman movie, really long, not very well written
pontless plot, nothing resolved just things hapenning for like 3hrs
this movie was actually good.
Loved this movie. Extremely extremely skeptical about joker. But maybe the world is ready?
This movie was so disappointing , surprised it got so many positive reviews. This is the first time I have ever seen a Batman watch the Penguin kill about 20 people in a car accident and just let him go.
I didn't know Bruce Wayne's parents were killed in an alley before I watched this movie. They really should have included that at the beginning
everyone: god so sick of batman origin stories its been done to death! Warner Bros: Well how about the year after the origin story!
Meh. Pass.
I still haven’t made it all the way through this movie. I fall asleep b4 that Penguin being chased by the Batman scene. Also I don’t like the cat woman chick she’s boring
Fantastic. :)
What...no mention of just how many scenes are of batman slowly walking around, noticing stuff?
Please do The Bad Guys! 🐺🐍🕷🐟🦈🦊
Who cares how well you can sing? You’re epic voice guy!
That joke.about colin Farrels role in daredevil had me laughing and rewatching continously
The worst Batman film ever. Even the Schumacher ones are better that this 3-hour tosh. A superhero so depressed, he made Indiana Jones seem relevant to the plot of Raiders.
Why why is no one talking about the fact that 90% of the action was in the trailer.
That movie was terrible...long, boring and Batman didn't catch the bad guy. Not to mention the riddler prison scene "Bruuuce Waaayyyne" almost made me puke in my mouth
I swear the joker sounded like DiCaprio
No mention that some of it was filmed in the UK?   Namely Liverpool.
I’ve tried 3 times to finish this movie.  It’s soooo bad…….but I’m not going to let it win!  I just don’t see how it just keeps getting worse every time I progress in the show……
So... Highlander?
I think I need to watch again because I just didn't feel It... didn't feel right. But I really want to like it
Please tell me Movie Fights is coming back
Mustache Division 😆
I liked the ending... It was... Funny.   Hahahahahahahahaha
Druig does suck though...
I've been watching in nightly ten-minute increments on HoBO Max for about a week now.  I think that puts me at about the 1/4 mark.
For all its *MANY* faults, the cinematography and action were both _perfect_ in this. Loved Reeves' Gotham and can't wait for the sequel!
I can't believe you guys haven't done Coco yet.
This movie is a masterpiece.
The ad that popped up before the video started was amazing.
Personally for the next villain I want a nightmare on elm street scarecrow
This was not funny at all
This movie kinda reminds me of the Bone Collector,
Yea, a wingsuit crash  into a steel truss bridge, then a bus , then a car, and then concrete pavement , They would be picking up The Batman pieces off the road  and mopping bat-blood off the top of that bus. The car chase, surely killed a lot of people/civilians given the multiple car and semi-truck pile-ups and explosions (but The Batman doesn't kill anybody LOL) .   The flood of water  into that arena  would have killed everyone below sea-level. Batman would be swimming with  corpses, not leading people out.
Links to the Nirvana-ish songs that play in the background??
Capes together strong.  Nearly spit my drink!
Awful movie!!!!!!!
Please Honest Trailer Tombstone
Am i the only one here that found out collin farrell had sextape just by watching honest trailer🤣🙋‍♂️🙋🙋‍♀️😂
5:11 “Colin Farrell watching the old daredevil movie” I lost it 😂
So. Many. STARES!
That was so sus at the beginning Disgusting how they want to destroy men
"Collen Ferrell watching the old Daredevil movie" part killed me the most, made my night 😂😂 😂 😂
Do moon knight we need it!!!!!!!!
No the E at the end of Falcone is supposed to be pronounced.
yeah, this is the 2nd worst batman, after val kilmer's. It was sooo boring. The pacing was horrible.
Batman did not kill people in this movie period
The Gotham police mustache division was hilarious!!!!!
Loved the Seattle reference. Fits in more ways than just the weather.    Think about it.
Every New Yorker knows a rat with wings is a pigeon
Say, "Movie Fights are BAAAACCCCKKKKKK"
not me spatting out a sip of water when you said "8 parts Seattle"
Gotta say, Robert Pattinson *really* needed the Batman.
1:25 why do I get excited whenever my home town is mentioned
The next one should have deathstroke and more action
I like and subscribe, but I’m not going to comment!
He looks great in the suit but please don't tell me this guy can act he has one facial expression, it's like he just had botox
Please do an Honest Trailer for Arrested Development!
Do the fate series
Bats have no bones...
3rd  best batman film, just nailed the theme of Gotham and i think its the best suit ever very close to the Arkham Knight Batman suit. 1st The Dark Knight  2nd Batman Begins 3rd The Batman 2022
4:01 -4:19 This is literally the point of the movie. Bruce is so hyper focused on stopping petty street crime, but he never stops to think about the environment of poverty and corruption that fuels it. If he’d spent more time focusing on keeping tabs on the Revitalization Fund and less time punching out random criminals, he could have made the difference that he laments he’s not making in the opening monologue. The dramatic irony of what the Riddler is doing is that, despite Batman being The Good Guy and not killing, the Riddler has done more good for Gotham (until the dam plot) in a week than Batman had in a year.  Essentially, the movie addresses the age old question: “Who is better suited to ending crime in Gotham City? Batman, or Bruce Wayne?”
Colin Farell watching the old Daredevil movie takes the cake :)))))
Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie. I died 😂
Not only did I not know that was Collin Farrell, I didn’t even know it was makeup. Just thought it was some actor I didn’t know.
The Batman Movie It’s really not that long of a movie compare to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit extended edition Trilogy it child’s play for fan of it for how long the movie is.
U got me! 😅 I left a like and a comment, now!
Just wait until they bring out the (full length) Directors Cut (version) of this one, then you'll have to do another video on this one and call it  >>>   THE TWINIGHT SAGA (The Uninspiring Edgelord Edition!!) 🤭🤫😋 Heheheeee!!!
This batman movie is the worst high budget b-rated movie I ever seen....
Surprised you called her Bi. Seemingly everyone got their straight glasses on and missed any sign of tht
"What do you want from me? Riddles? Murders?!"  ...I mean...
I hope he does Sonic the Hedgehog 2 next.
“Capes. together .strong”. Loved that one
Brown teens are the only teens who play the "knockout game".
Daredevil joke was great :)
If you think about it, the car chase didn’t have to happen at all. Batman and Gordon could have just questioned Penguin at a different time. “But but but Catwoman would have been killed!” Maybe, but Batman and Gordon had no idea she was gonna show up to the factory in the first place. Batman had already spoken to Penguin in his own club. He could have just done it again.
This honest trailer was waaaay too nice. Even my rant on the batman was more nitpicky than the honest peeps xD
I was thinking that this dark, damp, claustrophobic version of Gotham would make for a very great contradiction to a bright, sunny, open, Metropolis if they decide to make a Superman in this universe.
I fell asleep whilst watching it btw. It was way too long and unnecessarily convoluted imho
"He's ready to put the Goth back in Gotham."
"Gerard Wayne" and "Incelsior" were * perfection *. 10/10, no notes.
Woo. Putting Seattle on the map
Had an ad for a Dr Strange knockoff called Dr Weird, who had amazing hair due to Supercuts. Then the video starts and there it is again. Strange
Garbage movie. Apparently the evil person in Gotham is Elite white men like the mayor Batman and the d a
Yes we want Movie Fights! Dan Murrell needs to defend his title!
Meh
Honest Trailers: HIMYM, Moon Knight, Sonic the Hedgehog 2
The gen z facts are hilariously on point
The opening to the movie was really good though.
Seems like the people who didn’t like The Batman are to used to MCUs having jokes every 5 minutes
IN A WORLD......
Bring back movie Fights! With Dan
Please do Turning Red
When the song was posted I wasnt interested, now seeing it im terrified and will never watch it 🙃  Bring back movie fights lol
This movie sucked
This emo is not even Batman! Batman trained around the world! This scrawny boy just trained box with his butler.
It was a great movie on its own. Was it the Best batman movie? Definitely not, that title stays with the Dark knight. They were too much things that didn't make sense in this movie.  Is he the Best Batman? Well he is definitly the most accurate if we talk about the average batman.
Catwoman complaining about white men having all the power in the city while she kisses batman who obviously has tons of cash and is connected to said city.
YES! MOVIE FIGHTS!
Hey you can't have both the epic voice and singing, gotta choose (unless you're corpse husband)
Do spaceballs already 🫠
What I can't understand about that movie is why every scene had to be 3x longer than necessary. It hurt to watch.
I just wanted to say        Na na na na na na na na na na BAAAAATTTMAAAAANNNNN
GERARD WANE
you could've been harsher for this film, but i guess it would've offended fan-boys.  We've reached the stage where Fanboys limit freedom of expression.  Even i want to say more....ok, i will.  the colors on this continual photocopying of the same ole story of Batman has faded to grey.
If he is roughly 28 and this is 2022 his parents died in 2002 when he was 8 which means he was born in 1994, hes a millenial lol
A lot of the watching time was wasted on Batman just walking.
What music is that?
yes we want movie figths !!!!!
Batman was so disappointing tbh. I’ve never seen a Batman movie before and damn, i don’t think i want to after watching this one.
The Twiknight saga killed me Lmfao I haven't stopped laughing
You missed a chance to say starting Bill Gates for the riddler
Do the Bel-Air reboot next
I am surprised you guys didn't mention or notice the creepy stalker moments.
Edward Cullen + Bruce Wayne + Preston Teagardin = Astro City's The Confessor
MOVIE FIGHTS !!! 😩😩😩
Nice video 👍
INCELSIOR!
Do dragon ball super superhero when it's out please
Falcone is Italian, you pronounce the “e” at the end. Just sayin.
so this Ht toltally validated me, for the entirety of the  dark knight saga it drove me up a wall that they kept pronouncing falcones name wrong , and when I tried to explain this to people it made me look like  lunatic so thank you
Do how I met your mother
I got the supercuts ad, who else?🥴😅
The best Batman, when you never see one of the other Movies.
DARKER!!
Honestly it was shi... but the Honest Trailer is good!
If Batman weren't in this movie, absolutely nothing would be different in the end. He makes very little difference in the outcome.
They also composite the Oakland Tribune building in Gotham. Which is actually rad because they always say Metropolis is San Francisco and Gotham is Oakland.
I love how the movie hinted that if Bruce had spent a little less time on vigilante action and a little more time managing his finances, which would include his father's Renewal fund, he could have prevented, or at least detected, the rampart corruption. It's an apt critique of the billionaires of our real world, many of whom are obsessed with moonshot projects to revolutionize our world when what we actually need from them is responsible behavior and basic, boring philanthropy
Thank you. I’m so glad somebody finally took this shitty movie down a peg.
Just another Bat Movie...
DO THE BOYS SEASON 2
Whoever came up with "Incelsior" needs a raise!
I want to know why Batman and Jim just let the Penguin go after they caught him with a dead hooker, 5 bags of drugs and money and a 12 car explosive pile up.  Also how did Batman even make it to the Batmobile after penguin shot him? He was literally right in front of him
The fact that you haven't done an Honest Trailer for Peacemaker - despite coming earlier than The Batman - is insulting.
Nah, the scene with clowns and batman was perfect.
The Vig Lebowski 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Movie was meaningless and empty to me . I couldn’t ever imagine putting it on again
"The rat with wings"  😂
I hated this movie
Bring Ed Greer back to movie fights.
pretty meh.. 1 hour out of the 3 was good - from 1:00:00 to 1:30:00 and from 2:00:00 to 2:30:00
"DO THE BATMAN"      - Alfred to Selina
Anyone knows the song that begins 0:54 and ends at 1:17 ?
I wanted to see what Mr. Freeze would look like in the sequel.
Them not pronouncing Falcone’s name right reminds me of Liam Neeson mispronouncing the Gungan’s in Star Wars to the point George Lucas started calling them “Goongans” 🤣🤦‍♂️
this trailer had a better story than the batman movie tbh
Capes together strong is one of the best names you guys have done lmao
"He'll put the Goth in Gotham... a city that's one part New York and now eight parts Seattle..." Love it!
Seriously... Druig sucks. That Joker add-on was pure garbage.
I'm surprised that no one mentioned that Catwoman's mask is pretty much a sock while the Riddler's mask is a discount S&M mask.
Is this a movie fights tease?!?
2:00 YESSSS MOVIE FIGHTS  Seriously wtf was with that show just disappearing with no explanation. At least give a little update on why you’re nixing it. Sheesh.
Serendipity struck cause I finally watched this last night! lol
Would the movie have been stronger without the final stadium city flooding sequence?
The Batman was easily the best rendition we've ever had. Everything about the movie was perfect. Literally nobody can say anything even remotely bad about the movie that would be even close to the truth.
1 part NY and 8 parts Seattle XD
Movie fights, Movie fights xD
"and his hometown will very soon be underwater"  😱 Damn! Screen Junkies, you are pulling no punches
The music is just star wars with a few notes removed
Ok, ok, you got me. Here is your like and subscribe!!
I feel like you could've poked a bit more fun at the more ridiculous aspects of the plot, but the joke economy on this is pretty solid. I had to rewind to "Incelsior!" several times.
Think i'll stick with Pete Holmes' "Badman" tbh! 😀
Utterly painful movie to sit through on opening night.
Please say how in the name of ZEUSES BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell. I have requested this like 10 times
gerard wayne. thank you screen junkies i love you
Meh
What about Morbius, its one of the films we ever watched.
I think editing has become a lost art in Hollywood. It would have made this movie this much better to crop out like 30-45 minutes.
Deadass, if yall bring back movie fights, I'll be all in!
Bro pleaaase do an honest trailer for the first chronicles of narnia 😫😫😫😫😩😩😩😩
The Supposed to be Joker guy might be HUSH. I mean that was definitely writen somewhere in the movie
Gerard Wayne was a spot on! I've been saying he looks like Gerard Way since I saw the trailer way back!
Looking forward for the next live action Batman: a completely black screen.
Do an Honest Trailer for Peacemaker!
I feel like the crime in Gotham wouldnt be so bad if there wasnt like 40 cops standing outside a crime scene just to give Batman the stink eye.
MOVIE FIGHTS 🎥🎥🎥🎥🎞🎬🎬🎬🎞🎥📀📀📀📀🎬🎬🎬🎞🎞🎞🎬🎬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧠🧠🤑🤑🤑🤑🍁🍁🍄🍄🔥🔥💥💥🍻🍻🍻… now that I got that out.. Yes Yes YES!!!! Dan the man  Murrell belt match I need it!!!!
I wish robin was in this movie but wasnt but overall it was a good movie.
They should have mentioned the part where Batman was knocked unconscious by the blast that killed DA Colson. He was out cold at the church, they probably put him in an ambulance while still unconscious and took him back to the police station and waited. At NO point didn't anyone try or think to say, "hey, I wonder who the he is" or try to peak under the mask. OF THE UNCNSCIOUS GUY JUST LAYING THERE. They were all like, yup this is 100% normal. We don't care who this dude is. But lets arrest him when we wakes up....whomever he is.
I was bored.
But why Robert Pattinson? Why not Scott Adkins? Is he too old?
Most overrated movie to come out in the last year
I want movie fights with Dan and Joe. Maybe the puppet.
I find it odd that they tried to basically recreate New York. I always that Gotham was analogous to Chicago.
Ok you owe me a keyboard for the "ok just gonna walk it off" #2:15  comment that made me spit coffee all over it...
Seriously why is Batman allowed to walk into every crime scene like that?
Gcpd moustache division 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:27 what? false, out of tune and lyrics in which you ccan't even find the OG song anymore?
Out of all the villains in Batman, the Joker is the one I am most fed up with.
wtf why’d i get the supercuts ad before this
My review of The Batman; Meh... It was alright, a little long though. Better than the last 500 super hero movies that came out last year. But I like the ones with Christian Bale better.
Pls do Sonic The Hedgehog 2 next!
For a supposed  great detective he's not all that good at it .
the song was awful
The Riddler is the Real Hero. He single handedly took out the filth of Gotham. While The Batman did nothing except help out the National Guard at the end.
What a coincide. Just finished watching the movie 2 hours ago.
The best thing about this movie was the honest trailer
Worthless movie, some people hated Bale for his weird voice for Batman, I hate this version of Batman, just walking around with some cool cinematic shots, that is not being a detective, constant flirting and stalking, I'm surprised you guys didn't say anything about that. Got knocked down twice, still moves closer to a shotgun only to be blasted away, one of the most boring movies that I actually waited months for and watched it first day third show, I regret watching this movie, and also the super unnecessary shirtless scenes, makes him look like the weakest Batman ever. Ben Affleck was so much better, WB ruined their chances for a perfect Batman movie.
Is no one gonna comment on the genius of "Incelsior"?
Greatest missed opportunity Mad Worl
I really thought you would have a bit in here about all the whispering in the movie lol everybody was talking so low throughout
Everybody knows that a woman in Gotham who got cats = Catwoman. Its not harder then that. The second a cat shows, then we know who is Catwoman.
I would have been funnier if you said not that dark when you got to Ben Affleck's Batman
I expected Kurt Co-Wayne, but Gerard Wayne will do
Jesus I'd forgotten 2 scenes from that film the shot where announcer is joking about how darker it is and him flying and  falling down and getting back up. I didn't find it memorable.
A good day in Gotham, is when its just fog and a light rain. Im happy to have watched it on HBO Max, where they make every scene gray instead of black, such a waste on a OLED TV.
Movie sucked nuts and balls. Like they took Abed’s Batman speech at the end of that Halloween episode and made a movie around it.
The Batman Who Laughs Without The Collar
I’d like to see calendar man
Seventeen minutes in I dozed off...I can't understand how this made so much money.
Pls bring back movie fights
Whatever happened to Hal Rudnick?
I'm surprised that DC actually let a director do their vision of the movie but they actually understand the character of Batman
No Black man has ever gone to SuperCuts for a decent, let alone passable line-up. Disinformation. Misinformation. I'm calling Elon.
Darkerrrr! Jesus, lost it at that one
So... what did you mean by "Brown Teenagers"? You could have just called them Teenagers.....
*The Man of Tomorrow* is the Superman sequel to Man of Steel we deserve; *THE* in the title will automatically make it a better movie right? Right guys?...  Perhaps *The Superman* to really nail the point.
I loved it, great car too
Still the worst Bruce Wayne ever
Probably one of the best movie of 2022
Goth + long run time. You know it's a great movie when Honest Trailers are sinking to this level.
Falcone (ending with née) is actually correct…. Just saying
bro yes being back movie fights
Can you please say “Sir. That is a sidetable?”
why you tryna keal mee!?
Glad I never got to see or ever will see this movie.   🥱  too dark, slow and boring; same tale.   2 of my friends said they've walked out about the 2nd act   Moving on....
please say "the demon code prevents me from declining a rock off challenge!"
Gerard Wayne...bruh
Please say "brain"(like a zombie)
These are always kinda weak when they try to roast good movies
Please make a peaky blinders honest trailer!!!!!
I love the end title, and the druig sucks at the end. They were funny.
Oh yeah
No mention of vengeance. Missed opportunity
you expect me to watch the honest theme song when the riddler who would wrap himself in cling wrap to not leave DNA literally licks an envelope in your preview?
"Edward courts Bella the same way Batman terrifies criminals " :- Cinema Therapy
So how many batmans movies we gonna need to cleanse Robert Pat fro from his Twilight origin?🤔
Movie Fights!!!
no joke about "vengence '?
Thank you!!!! I pointed some of these same things out when I was talking to my friends about it. For the world's greatest detective he seems to be bad at solving crime by himself in this movie. Also very confused how some people knew him and some didn't, like first, he's been the Batman for 2 years and second, he's literally helping the police in broad daylight (which is still stupid). He gets the crap beat out of him alot even though Batman is trained highly in hand to hand combat and the combination of noir and modern is confusing and off putting at times. This was probably Patterson's best performance but it was very well held back by the script.
Batman is boring now.  The only interesting Batman now is Hishe Super Cafe.
Gotham was a character of its own. A gorgeous dark mess that could also be home to The Crow. Also, the first time where Bruce was actually being a detective!
You gotta do an honest trailer for the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard trial when its done.
Just New York & Seattle? 2:05 *That's* a little bit Chicago, my friends.
For me this movie was an authentic garbage 🤬🤢🤮
Another rehash of the Batman origin for all intents and puposes .... making it longer and boring isn't progress WB.
Trying way to hard to be funny instead of doing a half decent review. Waste of time.
Can anyone plz tell me the name of the song used in this video?
I dont get why people like this movie
I wonder if Police departments have a mustache division?
MOVIE FUGHTS
This is a masterpiece, haven’t laugh this hard in a while  Gen Z version of Batman, his villains are influencers
I feel like "The right man for the job" is going to miss a lot of people, but it's perfect.
The Flash: “Now, all we need is unbelievably bad weather.” * thunder echoes outside * Thomas Wayne/Batman: “Welcome to Gotham.”
My main criticism of this movie is that it was just so utterly unnecessary. DC must have, what, hundreds? thousands? of characters and story arcs from decades of comic books. Why do they have to redo the same tired ones over and over and over again?
Why doesn't the Penguin ever use his umbrella? It's always raining in Gotham!
Please say, “Teeheeheehee”
Why was it so hard to pronounce Falcone? There is a long line of villains with that name.
Thank you
the only thing i didnt like about the movie is that everyone whispers in it. even bruce when hes not suited up
It was ok. Better than all those George Clooney and Val.kilmer Batemans that's for sure...and Paul Dano killed it
Am I the only one who’s been skipping the last couple DC movies?
I am disappointed with the batman movie. I thought it would be a good movie but DC just disappointed me yet again.
I absolutely loved this film, first batman movie I'd call a film.
The most overrated movie since Black Panther...
I've been waiting for this.
Yes, for those of you who still have not seen this movie. This trailer was far greater than the movie.
movie fights please!!
I really like the “That’s just a black screen……okay, there we go.”
The Colin Farrell reaction to Daredevil comment and the "He put the Goth in Gotham" = perfection.  Bravo!
"colin farrell watching the old daredevil movie" lmaoo
Pattinson was more vampire in this movie than in Twilight
DARK KNIGHT FOR LIFE
This one was kinda lazy, didn't laugh once
1:24 love it 😂
Bored to tears
Please say "I am Sofa King we Todd Ed!"
Please say, "If you could possibly not make a bad movie, for just a little bit, that'd be great!"
Saw the theme song first!  reason I didn’t click on it.
I don't get why this movie gets so much praise
This movie looks so dumb glad I skipped it
Even the honest trailer of The Batman its freakn boring.
DC... the copy/paste company. You rock!
This was a good movie. I enjoyed very much in the theatre
Has anyone noticed the "brilliant" Batman motif soundtrack is eerily reminiscent of the first several notes of Darth Vader's theme (by John Williams), and is only missing the last resolving notes?
"Druig Sucks"🤣🤣🤣🤣
you poke fun at Alfred helping batman, but you gotta remember. In the comics Alfred was UKSF, he ain't just a butler
I want Movie Fights
Yes movie fights 😛
It is a shame that Jack whitehall was not the riddler.
Please do Honest trailers everything everywhere all at once
He fights crime by walking towards it very slowly.
Wow, that Gen Z analysis was really depressing...
Fantastic! But when is someone gonna notice The Riddler took over Jonathan Larson's Tick Tick Boom apartment? My favourite part is Colin Ferrell watching Daredevil!
Please do Road to Eldorado! I won’t stop asking till you give in!
Say "Hey guys, thanks for all the comments" using a riddler impression
The worlds greatest detective?! He was given most of the answers lol
Terrible film. Bad writing. Bad direction.
X honest trailer please
Honest Trailers - My Cousin Vinny  Also they really saved money on lighting in the batman
I couldn't even get it half way thru this.
Do  uncharted !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I miss movie fights
Please do 'The Venture Bros.'!!!
I was honestly waiting for the STARES but neverthless, a great trailer!
So there are 2 dislikes now for the terrible music joke
I thought Burton made it darker than Nolan (and literally darker; I don't mean subjectively grimmer) but I haven't done any side-by-side comparisons.
Finally! Y'all released The Batman
YES! They crammed the d*mn Joker into everything… shoehorned him into the first Suicide Squad. Not knocking the version The Joker but JFC stop already.
Incelsior is soooo spot on.
Anyone know the song at 3:05?
A rat with wings..oooh that could be anyone 🤣🤣🤣
“gerard wayne” 😭
Colin Farrell is the best thing in this film . Pattinson was awful, Kravitz is hot and Paul Dano was pretty good. Film was Bleh
DRUIG SUCKS LMAO
Thank you, I said it was raining way too much. It also dragged.
I'm not mad that they introduced Joker, I just hope they don't make him the main antagonist of the _very next movie._ Save him for later, guys. Don't show your hand too soon. Heh, you get it, because Joker is a card- Okay, I'll show myself out.
This movie sucked though. I liked the atmosphere but Batman was too mediocre, nothing extraordinary. He sucked at whatever he was doing. He was a clone of me in that universe and I don't like me
The Adam Project pleaseeee
Druig Sucks!! Will never get old, LMAO
Not a good honest trailers
Overall, I liked the movie. What I did not like was the Joker cameo. I'd much rather see villains, like the Mad Hatter, that haven't been seen in the live action films yet.
Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie. I laughed so hard at this and the reaction of Colin is priceless 😂
I actually would live for Movie Fights to come back, they were really fun and thought provoking
"Hey guys! Remember how cool it looked when Batman and Robin were running in slow motion? Let's try that again, except no Robin, and Batman's walking! That'll pad out the time some more!"
Movie soundtracks are still a big deal
I am surprised how much I enjoyed this movie, especially when I walked into the theater expecting a banal time.
Your plundercats line was better than the entire movie
Moustache division! 😂
Please exclaim, "The Queen is dead! Long live the King!"
I expecting a staaaaare compilation... I'm disappointed
please say "the worlds real-life plague events DLC drops this summer on a city near you!"
Why does everyone hate Druig?
that colin farrell joke XD A+
God, this movie was stupid.
Wait... so Alfred is the one doing the detective work, while Batman just do the punching?
Plundercats HO! 😂😂😂
Would love to see live action version of Hush in the sequel.
Now, how about an Honest Trailer for Slacker?
"That'just a black screen " LMAO 🤣🤣
Oh dear! I'm wondering how silly you're gonna feel when you'll find out that it isn't pronounced either Fal-cone, nor Fal-coh-nee!... I guess you won't give a crap, will you...
Hard nope on the honest theme song, thanks.
Don't forget there's part Chicago also
I laughed so much at "deteeeect" I don't know why
This movie is a parody of The Dark Knight Trilogy.
I LOVED every ridiculous long minute
I swear to fucking god if the other one isnt the long halloween without the joker i will go to the movie theaters ever again
The Druig sucks saga continues
Thanks for noticing the bit about the accountants. I really wanted an extra scene with Bruce Wayne ordering a forensic audit on the Wayne Trust. This is probably the only movie I know that would have been improved with the inclusion of accounting.
great that you saw the main thing- batman who wants to fight corruption did vice versa- he stoped the ones who really tried
Don’t act like Bullseye wasn’t the most fun part of Daredevil.
"Incelsior"...Brilliant
Do beavis and butthead next
Emo superheroes never work. They never ever work.
Please leave Joker locked up in Arkham for the sequels. I really like the deleted scene, but it wouldn't have been great in this movie.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do peacemaker
I actually cried when batman saved people by jumping in, the hero aspect of batman over punishing of bad people.
So overrated
I'm sorry (not sorry), but this Batman film was so mediocre. I do not understand why everyone is praising this snorefest😅
the cat walk is sooooooo🤮🤮
This movie was almost perfect, visually. But was lacking in almost every other regard.
Alfred is always the better support character compared to all the Robins and Batgirls.
Really liked this version of Batman and the Riddler, just thought the movie itself was kinda boring. I think we had enough movies about Batman fighting generic mobsters.
"Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie" killed me LOL
I didn't even realize Colin Farrell was in the movie.
3:07 "mustache division," nice!
Is something in the way ? Cause it's dark.
Please say, in your Voice so Epic, "I have machines of all kinds. Marvelous machines, that can DO things...you would NOT believe..."  Also can you please to a trailer for UHF?
"He's got like 500 followers" 😂🤣
I am gonna say it, this movie is overrated. Pretty good but not the greatest thing since sliced bread like people claim.
That time when you notice Batman could have finished this case with only 1 victim if he just knew a good hacker...
Say "Please like and subscribe....or else" in your awesome voice.  It never hurts to ask.
"Gerard Wayne! " XD
Can you please say "kahmeyhameha" like goku would to finish up the last 10 minutes of any dbz episode
I'm a massive fan of Batman, the Cast, and Matt Reeves' Apes films....  So I was a little stunned that The Batman did nothing for me. I was bored. Annoyed at times. And then disappointed.  Still hopeful for the sequel
Only thing I didn't like was the Joker tease at the end.
"Watch Robert Pattinson put the final stake in his Twilight Sparkle" Maximum sneaky.
Wow that looks bad.
When the vid is only 1 hr old and there's already a thousand comments. 1🤷‍♂️
Legit thought that parody title said “The Twinkknight” and I 100% believed it because it still fits.
props for including "Druig sucks"
Finally a Batman Cinematic Universe I can see Clayface or Ventriloquist living in. Let’s go!
The movie is so boring it even managed to make the honest trailer be boring
The "darker" he said when batffleck appeared took me out 💀
I was 60 percent sure Riddler was gonna ask his followers to fund him on a DC Comics version of Patreon.
this movie was good.  maybe too long but good.   but for God's sake Warner Bros, STOP with the Joker in every Batman related entertainment media(movies, video games).  Joker is so overused and overrated already. he steals the spotlight from every other Batman villain.  this is what happened with the last Batman Arkham video game, Arkham Knight.  Joker was in that game and Scarecrow which was supposed to be the main villain of the story was completely overshadowed.   I hope the sequel for this new Pattinson The Batman movie franchise doesn't shove the clown into our face.
Should have mentioned his back pack used to belong to Hermione Granger.  How did he fit that huge suit of armor, gadgets and thigh fanny pack in that little back pack????
Actually, Italian names almost never end in a consonant sound. "Falcon" would be the French or Spanish pronunciation. And it would have to be "Falconi" to end with the long "e" sound. Even many Italian-Americans get it wrong.
I liked how the Batman was pretty consistent throughout the whole movie about not using guns or wilfully killing anyone. Except for the Penguin chase part where he was indirectly responsible for a lot of trucker deaths.
Okay okay i subscribed! Jeesz!
The right way to pronounce Falcone is Falcon-eh. Fun fact: judge Giovanni Falcone was one of the greatest opponents of the Italian mafia. So, the opposite of a mobster!
The Dark Knight pronounce Falcone wrong the whole time?
Whatever happened to movie fights?
This movie looks like its gonna suck
rick and morty
how do you not love the movie where the nostalgia critic get the living daylights beat out of him while wearing clown makeup?
Dude i miss movie fights
I don't subscribe cuz I don't like any other screen junkies content, only honest trailers
The only thing I didn't like about this movie was Catwoman's mask, it looks so weird. It barely covers her face, why does she even wear one?
Finally someone says that the joke cameo sucked
I understand the next Batman movie will just be a completely black screen with audio.
Do Morbius Honest Trailer
Good lord, this movie just proved how boring, childish, flat rainbow and sunshine marvel movies are. Even that batmobile from this movie has billions times better and serious personality than 90% MCU superheros and villains. Thank you DC, Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson for this great experience. You guys are the greatest.❤️❤️❤️
I'm not okay after that Gerard Wayne pun.
I'd like riddles, personally.
First 10 minutes Greaaaaat, the other six months of viewing time - shiiiiiiiiiiiii*
Say, in your best trailer voice. “Awa an boil yer heid”   Phonetically- “a-wah an boil yur heed”  It’s Scottish. Ken?
How To Train Your Dragon 3: The Hidden World  Into the Woods  I love those 2. They're flawed masterpieces. Please don't be too harsh.  "The Hidden World" wasn't bad, almost every aspect was just a make-or-break.  Also, do "Coraline".
He said the riddler was dressed like a garbage bag 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yes we want movie fights with Andy!
The penguin was really good in this one
Gerard Wayne : when I was a young boy.....
This Batman went too far. The Penguin may be a bad guy but he didn't deserve to watch old Daredevil movie.
The ratio is 9.9%, so pretty accurate.
First Batman movie to include the Tweedles. That's what I'm here for.
Sick of batman
after 14 years, Robert Pattinson finally became a bat.
I totally get why people didn’t like the runtime but I felt like I’m the only person who likes to take in the mood of a good shot
I more or less liked the movie but hated batman 👀 I know minority but that's how I honestly felt
its a tween fanfiction
Dr Strangelove oh what a movie
Do honest trailer of Your Name (Anime)
The last act was just too weak to call it a great film
GERARD WAYNE
That's just too honest
Gerard Wayne, Good one
If u want to see the Wayne’s dying on camera go watch the first episodes of Gotham
This is the worst movie I've ever watched since jackass 2
Honest trailer on Death on the nile
What a garbage Honest Trailer, the most unfunny I've ever watched
Movie fights! Movie fights! Movie fights!
Can we all agree this was actually a really good movie?
Y'all were way too soft on this movie
Man i hate this movie.
*COLIN FARRELL WATCHING THE OLD DAREDEVIL MOVIE* - I actually laughed out loud there, bravo.👏
"Gerard Wayne" cannot get enough appreciation, god damn
Good movie ( sorry for my bad grammar, English is not my first language).
I hated this movie. Can't even really tell you why. Just couldn't get I to it. Didn't care about the characters, ect. It was just long and boring.
DO DR STRANGE AND THE MULTIVERSE OF MADDNESS!! Too soon?
why do they always make batman movies so dark and gloomy? I miss the animated batman series...
I LOV U LOTS, RBATZ, MY BOI!!!!
Hes worse off than his parents 😂😂😂
My Top 9 live action Batman movies: 1. The Batman  2. The Dark Knight  3. The Dark Knight Rises  4. Batman Begins  5. Batman v Superman  6. Batman  7. Batman Forever  8. Batman Returns  9. Batman and Robin
this movie is amazing
Do an honest trailer on the godfather trilogy since it's their 50th anniversary please
The Shadow (1994). Nows the perfect time to show its connection to Batman!
“THE TUMBLR” 😂😂😂
573
Umm…that was pretty weak for an Honest Trailers video. Maybe because the movie was overall too good to criticize and make fun of much 🤷‍♂️
The world's biggest fucking detective didn't notice all of the victims' pictures were obviously taken from the same place
Can't wait for the 5 hour directors cut 😂
dc wont stop until they recast every American hero with a British actor
this was meh.  Adam West 'The Batman' is the Batman i never knew i needed.
" His villains are influencers " 😂😂
Druig sucks
You need to watch it in cinema! Cinematography is stunning and the slow burn is the part of it. I really liked it (accept for Riddler - too much of Jim Carrey in my system). Also, the jaw of R. Pattinson should have its own credit name :)
.do daredevil the series
Like for Movie Fights!
The movie with all the bad guys are white and the good guys are black.
Should have been 1 part New York and 8 parts Liverpool/Glasgow but smh Americans.
This could have been a really good iteration had they kept the Woke and PC away.
say: "The riddler is flooding Gotham plaza, quick Alfred fetch me my bat-trunks"
The joke made about Bruce's lack of attention to non-vengeance related things like his accountants is sort of the point of the movie.   He was so wrapped up in finding a (self) justified outlet for his rage that he eschewed the actual things that would help the city on a larger scale.
Please bring back movie fights!!!
Could have called him *El Rata Alada Man* 😅 .
Something in the way
We want movie fights
Glad I'm never watching this overrated mess.
Yes! We want movie fight back!!
Do Flash Gordon man... POOOOOORRR FAVOOOOORRRR
Do The Thing next
500 hundred followers?! MISTER WORLDWIDE
Please say: "I am vengeance. I am the Night. I am... TOFU Batman!"
Speaking of murder mysteries you should do an honest trailer on Clue the movie
oh look _another_ batman movie
I’ve been waiting for this one 😂
In starring you should have named Batman Kurt Cowayne.....but ok
Not a good movie
Very funny
Do an honest trailer for Doctor Strange 2 pleaaaaaaase
A script where very sentence was a masterpiece, yet the “gen z Batman” analysis still stands out!
What I hated about The Batman is that the makers, in a desperate attempt to make Batman realistic, actually made him uncool.
I was expecting keeps but okay.
Pls, somebody just make the Arkham games Batman into a movie.
haven't seen The Batman but I've watched your HT so this means your HT is better than The Batman!
Zoomer Batman
Seeing Batman walking was little.... wierd.  I mean I know he has to do it but do I really need to see it?
Did anyone else notice how much they borrowed from the movie Se7en? General plot, everything about Riddler including apartment, journals and physical makeup. The interrogation scene ihas some barely changed dialogue from, Pitt/Spacey car conversation.  They are betting most target audience doesn't even know Se7en. So much for original screenwriting.
How can this be an Honest Trailer of The Batman without even a single utterance of the word emo?
New York City actually gets a lot more rain than Seattle.  46 inches vs 37.
Best Batman ever
ON FUCKING GOD!  BRING BACK MOVIE FIGHTS!
Ok but all jokes aside, this movie is top tier.
Yeah….the movie is really long but its a good thing that it was really good tho.
a stuntman really did 2:07 (excluding the flying part, but the crash was real) so it is completely realistic imo
Edward Cullen made a great Batman!
any movie (or TV show like  Monk) is better with John Turturro in it.
Angela Lansbury!!
One time supercuts cut my ear with a razor and didn't even tell me, they just bandaged it lol.
Yes! Movie Fights! That's exactly what we want fro you! 😁
To be fair, I'm actually curious to find out more about this version of The Joker. That deleted scene really piqued my interest.
Movie fights? I hated Andy but you guys did dude soooooo dirty
Druig sucks!
This review was like woke inception
Yes movie fights again yes please
It's legitimately my favourite batman movie and I like them all
perfection... Zoe-Selina was the most obnoxious part...
The joker deleted scene was ace
The movie instantly got bad right after the Nirvana song then they reuse said song at the end....like cmon guys I get it most people don't care it's not real vanity and ego is all that actually matters but still.....at least use a different song.
1:14 "and his hometown will very soon be underwater" lol. True.
It's also a really, really, really, really bad batman movie
Please say in Hindi Namaste mein Epic voice trailer admi hu. Dhanyawad.
I was a lifelong Batman fan until this movie.  They just really lost me with this.  It was downhill with Ben Affleck and this just cratered it. The Dark Night was the best, they shouldn't have tried to revamp it. I really would have loved another dark knight movie where Joseph Gordon Levitt became Robin and then a stand alone Robin/ Nightwing movie. He would have been amazing.
Hand me my stun glove 🦇🦇😂
Say: "Who always pays their taxes? Not Batman!"
Thank God for the Honest Trailer's!!!!😆🤣😂 I have NOTHING against Batman but I wasn't going to go see yet another reboot of the character that WB seems to do every 1/2 hour!!! Every time it's  This Batman is more Dark, This one is too nice, this version is too moody etc...........
I miss Movie Fights
Supercuts is mid
gerard wayne is too much for me lol
BRING BACK MOVIE FIGHTS 🥹🥹🥹
I watched The OGMichael Keaton in theaters.  I can say with full authority that I hate not only this version but everything current year.  Get off my lawn!!
"He put the GOTH back in GOTHAM" I'm dead💀
2:00 I'll subscribe once there's an Honest Trailer for The Umbrella Academy :)
It only took Pattinson 14 years to turn from a vampire to a bat
awesome video, anyone know where can i find the background songs? they sound like nirvana and really grungy i am interested in hearing them more
Yes to bringing back Movie Fights please.
Pretty much the worst Batman movie in existence.
The Batman: 8/10 The Incel Riddler: 3/10 The Penguin: 9/10 The Batmobile: 7658756/10
The Batman >>>>> No Way Home                      *FACT*
The trailer highlighted Batman surviving a skyscraper jump, but not him taking a freaking BOMB to the face and being unscathed? Cmon.
Screen Junkies: "Watch Robert Pattinson put the final stake in his Twilight sparkle." Also Screen Junkies: *calls this episode The TwiKnight Saga* 😆✨
People wanted angry punch fight movie but what they got is a detective story which is a genuine part of the make up of batman that we haven't seen.
I know your secret: If you like the move, you can not make fun of it. Most funniest HTs are when you hate the movie.
Such a bad movie..not Shumaker bad, but close.
You did not just tease me with movie fights.  Don't blue ball us junkies we all miss it
This movie is terrible
Martinez is absolutely the homie. He is the best/worst cop of Gotham City, and every single appearance of him made me laugh.
I can appreciate the cinematography but the movie was just not great. Too many movies have been hyped recently only to be mediocre at best -- NWH, Batman, Northman...
Please say "Lemme get uhhh..."
On the soundtrack thing... I wish they were still a big deal too
"Gerard Wayne" damn near killed me, I had to pause the video I was laughing so hard
This movie was alright 6/10
I hope that the joker is not the main villain in the next movie.  Maybe the third movie.  But, i want to see more of the penguin and maybe introduce another minor criminal.
0:38 should have been  "in a world of corruption and chaos,  Matt Reeves created another Batman movie"
5:10 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Honestly I feel like this movie has a good balance of being really stupid and really good
This episode is brought to you by your aunt Janet who isn't a  hair dresser but works at Supercuts...
The only good DC movies are the ones that start with "The".
One part NYC and one part Seattle is exactly where it was filmed in real life, aka, Glasgow.
Bdsm riddler
FINALLY! Haha
Taking a quick break from the trial because this is the only way I'll be consuming WB anything until they do right by Johnny.
This was a solid movie.  Robert Pattinson was not my favorite Batman/Bruce Wayne but I really liked how the movie ended.  This Batman realized that he needs to be more than just revenge and fear.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.
Do better call Saul when it’s done
ABOUT TIME!!!
Gerard Wayne got me good
Picture all the money theaters are saving on electricity with all these dark movies.
Gerard Wayne 😆😆
Gen Z Villians Really Got Me!!
Goth back in Gotham omg how did i never notice
The Batman Robert Pattinson GBC
The one thing that's perfect in all the batman movies is Alfred
I feel he borrowed Bale's tight suit, stiff fighting.
You know the movie was damn good when it's honest trailer is so lame. LOL
"Who is the rat with wings?" Easy: Morbius.
I loved this film but I can understand why people wouldn’t. I think it’s an amazing take and new look for a hero movie
Lol but it does seem any dc movie with the in the title is going to be a good movie.
Do The Bubble... It's rough.
the fact that the movie is so good that the batman honest trailer isn't funny
Please say "Imagine I'm a toilet"
"Capes together strong." LOL
looks so bad
No jokes about Catwoman being woke? Lameeee.
02:57 you said he's in his 2nd year of the job. you're not the only person I've heard say that.  in the beginning of the movie Batman is doing a voice over and says: "two years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal." that to me says he's already done 2 years and is now in his 3rd. I'm not nit picking this video. I'm just curious if I'm not understanding Batman's comment.
Druig sucks!
"He (the Riddler) talks a big game for someone dressed like a garbage bag." That joke hit harder than Battinson's punches. 😎
it really is long.
Oh, Oh!!! Do the Dick Tracy movie!!!
First 2 hours and 30 minutes: "Well that was a good movie taking down Falcone."  Last 30 minutes: "Oh right...they still got to deal with Riddler. Man this movie's long."
The reason the Batman works at night is because he will sparkle during the day
Fun fact: Zoe Kravitz was also the voice of Catwoman in the Lego Batman Movie.
The Last Kingdom
Do Hannibal 2013-2015
Do you know that Daredevil series doesn't have a honest trailer for it?
Epic Movie Trailer Lord please say, "Hannibal is at the gates!"
I’m surprised they didn’t make fun of the countless shots of Batman’s feet while slowly walking towards something
Peacemaker next !
" Colin Farrel watching the old Daredevil movie" was the best 🤣
It was quite nice But after falcone's death it lost momentum a little bit
This came out 34 minutes ago but I’ve been waiting for it for 2 months
His villains are influencers 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂how did I not notice that!!! 😂
This movie was good until the flood drama. The switch to hero was good but the rest was eye roll worthy. A movie I loved and probably won’t watch a second time.
Bringing back movie fights??
What's the song used in this video? Its tight.
mustache division lolol
"hey, i'm crime-ing here!!!"  - penguin, 2022 -
Thanks for the video
watching it like this...the movie is garbage...i can see all the flaws in between
Still no Peacemaker?!
Movie fights was a great show back in the day
Holy crap he’s right! If Bruce had ever shown up to those accountant meetings, he could have stopped the graft years ago
3:00 So it's not just a phase, okay dad? GAAH! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
noyce
Please say: "The Adventures of Lollipop: World Explorer"
"The Batman" may be my top movie of 2022 so far. But seeing that "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" is due out this week, it may have competition. But hey, its better than seeing Ben Affleck being forced back into the role. LOL
I sincerely hope Joker stays locked up this trilogy. I'm honestly sick of his pseudo-societal rumblings and ridiculous plot armor. Either have him be the psychopath that just wants to have fun, or get new villains in there like Mad Hatter or Ventriloquist.
Do Ambulance!!
2:00 YES 1000% YES Bring back movie fights pls 🥺
do an Honest Trailer of  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 next please
Thank god I didnt watch this crap.
Martinez was a real one
I've never clicked on video so fast
This movie is so weak for me
How about Honest Trailers "Once Upon A Time"
"Druig sucks" 🤣   At least he left an impression, unlike the plot of the movie he's in ...
The Emo Batman is Bollywood length. No editor on board? It was the dark and rainy Gotham from the movie 7even.  Catwoman needs acting lessons. Seen her in a few roles - very wooden, no expression. Maybe it's from too much Botox.
How about Honest Trailers "How I Met Your Mother"
I appreciate the use of Nirvana music in the background
do peacemaker
Finally Batman can be a detective
Vampire Batman
The Starring for penguin should have said "Colin Farrell, apparently"
Please say I'll eat for breakfast.
Officer Martinez is the best part of this movie!!
I loved this movie.
what where is that song available?
Nice to see WB consistently making worse and worse Batman.
'Batman does detective work', or 'Batman Forever' walked so 'The Batman' could run.
Do peacemaker on HBO next
The Moon 🌙 is calling for you to do MOONFALL NEXT!
Druig sucks
Now I want a Dr. Strangelove honest trailer!
The twiknight was perfect
The district 9 trailer
Movie fights!!!!!
Finally Batman can be a detective
Finally, I can watch The Batman on Youtube WITHOUT falling asleep.
1:50 - 2:00 are just straight up facts.
It's time For MULTIVERSE OF MADNESSSSSS
This movie did something that we haven't seen Batman do anytime in movies like Walking among common people, going and coming like normal people through the doors, Doing things in areas filled with lights and for one really behaving like a person
You guys went way too easy on this.  Worst detective, causes so many deaths, and the final terrorism attack was so tacked on just to distract from the fact that the Riddler completely cleaned up the corruption in Gotham.
Please do Everything Everywhere All At Once Honest Trailer to end racism!!!
This movie was overrated
Yes 1:58
Batman survives some interesting bumps but good movie regardless.
"The Twiknight" is good, but I really thought this one was going to be "It's Always Rainy In Gotham".   Just so much rain!
What an awful cast...
What was up with the use of that Nirvana song? I just don't get its purpose for this film. What does a song about living under a bridge in harsh conditions with trapped animals for pets have to do with Batman?
Honest trailer is the only trailer that comes out after the movie.
“He’ll stop corruption more than Batman ever has.” When you think about it he’s actually right
I really liked the director’s approach for this movie, making it for like a detective style and not heavily relying too much on CGI. Yes it did feel like a long movie, but I liked it.
Please say: "Team Johnny"
THAT'S WHAT IT IS ......GEN Z BATMAN MOVIE, I WAS WONDERING WHY THIS MOVIE IS OVERRATED
I loved how they quoted Kingo in Eternals of "Druig sucks" for The Joker.
Good Time was the movie that was the final stake for Robert's Edward Cullen, not this one lol.
For a sequel I would love to see Scarface/Ventriloquist or Mad Hatter, both would be fantastic in this iteration if Gotham
i get the feeling danielle wrote the "mwah" line about catwoman
Isnt it weird that both ben affleck and colin farrell found praise playing essentially the same character roles but in DC
Do an Honest Trailer for Turning Red
actually happy you did some real criticism on it. the fanboys are insufferable.
Can we have the next Batman reboot be campy like Adam West? We've had enough big screen gritty reboots
Lost it at "Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil movie" lmaooo
Do an Honest Trailer for Sonic 2
I wish they would just leave Joker alone for once
Gonna say it since it's always pissed me off a bit: It's LA rata alada. It stands for the winged rat. The rat with wings would be el raton con alas.  GOD that felt good to write.
"Plundercats Ho!" ended me😂😂
U gotta do Cobra Kai season 4
You know this was a good movie when most of the honest trailer is just making jokes about the "emo vibe" and one brief moment where batman just walks off what should have been a major injury.
Yeah I need Movie Fights back
Bootman 🥾
this wasnt your best one. Like the dark knight rises this seemed super rushed
More proof that Serkis should stick to motion capture.
Gerard Wayne. I can't 😂😂😂
Say in epic voice: Honest trailers selling out to advertisers and making utterly crap music videos is the beginning of the end.
Timestamp:- I want see the All Star Superman in live action someday
Riddler be like: Welcome back riddler nation Fam!!!
spoiler alert: Batman beats people up.
I thought honest trailers was gonna say "shovel bat"😂
"Capes Together Strong" 🤣🤣
You guys should revisit agents of shield
I mean more Movie Fights would be nice.
1:57 yes sir i do
Man I so want a good Superman movie
Movie fights and I'll like EVERYTHING
Ok.
Affleck=Batfleck, Patison=Patman?
Easily my favorite Batman movie and portrayal of Batman.
Don't worry, they'll show the death of the Waynes in the sequel
Yeah,my biggest gripe with the movie is how Batman,despite constantly saving he wouldn't kill brought all those drivers on the highway in danger by chasing down Penguin.I mean,he knew where penguin resided so why not just let him escape and then bust him at the club later
1:50 I won't subscribe couse you guys won't saying anything about WOKE MOVIES, yikes!
Yeah,my biggest gripe with the movie is how Batman,despite constantly saving he wouldn't kill brought all those drivers on the highway in danger by chasing down Penguin.I mean,he knew where penguin resided so why not just let him escape and then bust him at the club later
They've remade Batman way too many times at this point, just make a Batman Beyond movie already!
A bit too long but good.
I never thought he'd ever live down twilight.....but I think I can forgive him now.....ehhhh maybe
Yeah,my biggest gripe with the movie is how Batman,despite constantly saving he wouldn't kill brought all those drivers on the highway in danger by chasing down Penguin.I mean,he knew where penguin resided so why not just let him escape and then bust him at the club later
I love everything about the Batman. Except for the Batman. Feel like it coulda been infinitely better with a different actor or different writing for Bruce/Batman
this movie was woke garbage
How was there no starring Slow Walks feature? I mean you can get very very drunk if you take a shot every time a slow walk happens in this movie
Please do an Honest Trailer for The Godfather Trilogy!
I dont get the complaints bout the runtime tbh
where is peacemaker? "You can't see it"?? huh?
I felt like Batman the whole time
Still waiting on you guys to make a Peacemaker honest trailer
I rented this movie, fell asleep twice watching it, and after 48hrs my rental expired and I have no idea what I attempted to watch lol
DRUIG SUCKS!

El Rata Ma Dada
Say Since gotham is under water is it kind of aquaman territory just asking for a friend
Please do every part of jojo bizarre adventure
Objectively the best Batman. If you disagree, you're wrong and stupid.
For a completely new twist, I propose making Honest Trailers of… other YouTube channels! Mr. Beast, Mark Rober, Film/Food/Game Theory, etc. would all be easy targets, amongst numerous others, for a good ole fashion Honest Trailer roasting and satire. Please, make it happen!
3:58. ALMOST ruins it. But not quite 😈😈
America’s favourite serial killer, “Dexter,” must be done! We even just completed the new season! I am also surprised, still, you have not done “The Americans,” another Top 10 series… Lastly, how you still have not done “House, M.D.,” given the good doctor’s zaniness and ample material he provided, seems very disappointing. Please, MAKE THESE TRAILERS!!!
I said it yesterday when I saw the Honest Theme Song and I'll say it again:  *BRING BACK MOVIE FIGHTS, YOU COWARDS!* KLoveYouByyyyyye! ❤
It's not even wrong, he would have avoided more crime by going to meetings.
I injured my wrists making the "C'mon, let's pick up the pace" motion when I saw this movie.
In a world where Screen Junkies creates honest trailers, one man had the courage to stand against an entire world, and say... Give us an Honest Trailer for Hamilton on Disney+ !
Do sonic 2 please
honestly, the minute "like" and "subscribe" are plastered all over the screen - I dont.
Colin Ferrell deserves an Oscar, they better give 'em one
THE Honest Trailers for THE movies are THE best things on THE internet. THE´re you go 😃
In this day and age, The Suicide Squad and The Batman are the kind of superhero films we need more of.  1. Michael Keaton 2. Robert Pattinson 3. Adam West 4. Christian Bale 5. Val Kilmer 6. Ben Affleck 7. George Clooney
Do HIMYM and Van Wilder
I liked the movie and I'll definitely be watching it again when it comes out but a persistent gripe for me through its whole runtime was I didn't get into any of the fight scenes; and I can't put my finger on why, they just felt off.
4:47 the ONLY thing that annoyed me about the movie. 🤦
Movie fights is actually cool😍😍
Do 365 Days, and have the wife watch it with you. You can thank me later.
2:00  Don't you dare tease me EVG! Bring back Movie Fights!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      please:)
🤣 druid sucks 😆 🤣 😂
Ridiculously stupid batman movie.
Please say “Special sneak peek at theaters this Saturday!”
You guys should do an honest trailer for Our Flag Means Death!
I don't exactly condone murder, but honest trailers should go on a killing spree sometimes.
The Batman could just use what he learned at Hogwarts to maje his job easier.
Where's that UNCHARTED honest trailer
Honest trailer for The office (us)?
Please do the expanse, it's so good
Finally Thank You Screen Junkies!
SAY: "I'm both frightened and aroused."
Glad to finally see a Batman series that assumes that you've seen a Batman movie before.
Please say, "Hey, Hey apple, Knife."
the penguin is robert de niro haha
Please say: "Its time to d-d-d-duel!"  Or be really meta and say "Brooklyn Rage!"
Riddle me this… I am a relic from the ‘60s. I am by far the best gadget in superhero cinema. I can be used against predatory creatures. What am I?
Man, I was really expecting a parallel scene between Edward saving Bella and Batman saving the mayor's son from the speeding car.
Please say: "This is the last comment i'm reading out loud......................................... for this week."
😎
Gotham police: Moustache division   Lol
"Putting the "Goth" back in Gotham."  LMAO
I’m pretty sure Alfred still said Falcone-y at one point in this movie.
No parts Glasgow?
You should do ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK/L.A.
Please do one for Tombstone.
That gerard wayne joke is amazing.
"Moustache division" was perfect 🤣🤣
I'm in the minority that hated this. So much so that I got up at the part where Bruce is confronting Falcone and left the theater and got my money back 💯💯 waste of my time was the Batman💯💯😡
MOVIE FIGHTS!!!
Yeah its weird they make it boring realistic while making him invincible.
"... Mustache division" 🤣🤣
Batman has a very big mental ill loyal fans
Say "My epic singing voice is epically non-existent."
Thank you for the acknowledgment of the numerous, numerous truck drivers killed during the penguin car chase.
I lost is at Gerard Wayne and Incelsior!
I miss movie fights
I never liked the batman character until batman begins. I am back to not liking.
Can we get an Honest Trailer for Netflix’s Umbrella Academy before season 3 drops?
When the riddler said "thanks for all your comments" i had to physically stop myself from yelling out into the theater "AND THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING ME ON PATREON"
can you do turning red please 🙏😩
"We are in a new era of dc where they Let the directors have their way with their movies"💀👀👁️👄
Say "How many days can you go without sleep?"
fine FINE I'll subscribe... well played on that one
The Joker is just free real estate at this point. Every Batman game, movie or anything in between must have him apppear in one form or the other
I'm sad we didn't get a Shovel face callback in this trailer
It’s not better than TDK imo but still excellent
No one wants movie fights
This is the best honest trailer ever
Yes, please bring back movie fights.
Put it this way. Nothing is worse than seeing George Clooney Batman with his batnip suit! XD
MOVIE FIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
that was actually really good
In honor of David Birney, say "Romulans don't believe in luck."
The hairiest thing about the Gotham Police Mustache Division was that they never charged the Batman for killing a truckload of truck drivers while he attempted to solve that rat with wings riddle.
*Yea so you have almost 7 million subs and these videos get 1/2 mil-2 million views. It’s not 10% of us like and subscribe, it’s the other way around*
1:56. An Honest Trailer for the Daredevil show for starters.
All those jokes about Gen Z and he never mentioned the Nirvana soundtrack   (Oh you like Nirvana? Name *any* song other than Something In The Way)
Please do Crank and Crank: High Voltage honest trailers!!!!!!!!!!
Mustache division had me laughing out loud 😂
You wash ur mouth. Druig rocks!
Not your best work
I didn't know how this movie would turn out, but it was pretty good! Then I saw this honest trailer, and I thought "Robert.... Batterson!"
Omg that daredevil joke i laughed for a solid minute 🤣 😂
Missed opportunity to call him Robert Batinson XD
We also want Dan back!
Barry's joker is such a let down and frustrating one.
We want movie fights!!!!!
This was a beautiful looking movie and had some cool moments but yeah...waaayyyyy too long.   Also: "Druig sucks!" lol
If batman gets stabbed "something in the waaaayne, ooooooooooohhhhh hmmmmm"
movie fights??
Do wall-e honest trailer
It rains more in Nashville and Memphis than it does Seattle
>Catwoman opening her fridge and *never closing it.*

We want riddles *AND DEATH!*
Ok, I'm interested in this heart-shaped box sound-alike in the background
It was really underwhelming for me
3:45 "Taking down CD underworld types"
Capes together strong that's a good one 😂 Also druig sucks 💀
Funny video, but The Batman was dope af and you know it. 👍🏻
I think the Joker movie was his parents being killed before this
After the greatest detective got his Spanish corrected by the Penguin he decided to really study and learn more than 1 language
Top 5 cbm easily
Do clone wars plzzz
I was expecting Pattinson to be called Shovelface again.
The Scarecrow and/or the Ventriloquist would fit in nicely to Matt Reeves' version of Gotham.
See the problem with this honest trailer is that you're trying way too hard to make up a flaw  1. Batman did not kill the people driving the trucks, Penguin did 2. Batman is also definitely not the winged rat given that he would know if he was an informant in the Maroni case 3. The movie is necessarily long, can you imagine how boring it would've been had it ended the moment Riddler smiles at Batman when he's caught?
can't believe you didn't compare free guy to Westworld
You know, you had me at murder, but you lost me at Druig sucks. NO LIKE!!!
Please say "Désolé, je ne comprends pas", thanks !
The cops complain that Batman is working with them, that is what Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) from the LEGO Batman Movie wanted to do all along. Such an ungrateful bunch of people in the Batman.

"Colin Farrell watching the old Daredevil Movies...." bahahahahahhahahahahhahahaa brilliant!
Riddles? Murders? Movie fights? Haha nice little reference there! (I do miss movie fights;)

Batman: Revenge of the Sparklepire.
A random comment
first
Thank you! Been waiting forever for this!!
Beam Me Up, Scotty!: One of the most popular memes following the film's release consists of the Riddler giving Batman a humorous riddle prefaced with the statement "Riddle me this, Batman...", which he never actually says in the film.
Do an Honest Tralier for Moon Knight please
