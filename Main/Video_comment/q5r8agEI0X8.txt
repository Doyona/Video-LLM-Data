Ended up with a laser level in my shopping list, thanks Kon!

Cool 😎
Happy late birthday john. I think his birthday was last week
Don needs the AirKon
what website do u use to edit your pictures?
Did Kon just order a Laser Pointer for anyone else via Alexa 😂
Where’s part 2?
Is the build going to be in there since that don’t look like his house mans want to travel to a studio in order to record one video then go back to the house…
FINALLY AFTER 4 - 6 MONTHS
Wheee is it
This guy......has so many talents!
Now I have a laser measurer in my Amazon basket.. thanks
360!!! I love my camera lol
I lowkey love how kons chanel is lowkey turning into a renovation chanel and im here for it i love the kontent
i would have that second floor be like an indoor balcony like a hangout spot
Someone is losing some weight
It take you 5 months to make this video
Kon is actually abit rude
After months
Can you give me a pc
Kon, you know you gotta chance that sprinkler system to fit your new rooms, give me a shout ill get it sorted for you!
im sure that set up was at The backstage centre in Thurrock, did you go up to see the 3 different types of lighting grids they have
Lets go I been waiting on this Kon
16:08 i have no words
The Sidemen really came a long long way
You kinda luk like young enthan
you are the real side man you aint even in sidemen 😄😄
damn this guy works a lot bts
16:07 I love it 🥵
W
How do they get a fire engine to fill the tank do they just call 111 🤣
2 samsung 360 cassette, one in white and one in black for the open plan Air Con would look smart
✅
You should make the upstairs a gaming place and a place to chill out and where you could do mukbangs or that
Kon so talented
nice
Man... Thats all just wood.. Your studio will catch fire 🔥 at instant.. XD
BAHAHA BRO MY ALEXA ADDED THE LASER MEASURER TO MY BASKET ( I have my Alexa right next to my tv 😭😭 )
Kon, you should do some under stair storage. Make the most of the awkward space.
Now I know how 0%Mercury made that music video.

It's insane that you built that whole set for the sidemen sunday when I was watching I was thinking how the hell did they rent this place out lmao
Came here from the ashville channel.
Are you related to bezingha
these videos are so good just the edits and the way this man films u can see why hes been so succsesfull
Have you thought about adding some kind of kitchen area? Love the videos, really enjoying seeing the progress ☺️
Llllllllll
Llllllllll
SideSidemen channel for the BTS guys?
Shoutout Ashville
We still are waiting for his setup update.
It’s crazy how much the sidemen spend on their videos
1:05 nah man this guy is too much😭
That laser measure got added by my alexa when you said it kon hahah
FINALLY
A spiral staircase would be way better for a small room like that to save space.
kon can you please give me reply on Instagram
lit ep.
one thing I really like about these videos is the fact that we can see the progress on all these 'side' projects of Kon. It also motivates me to work towards my dreams since I have a lot of projects I want to work on myself~
Finally
Use the area under the stairs as a drinks/snacks station!!
Sorry but Kon’s face on the FaceTime camera is the highlight of this video
It's so cool to see how professional sidemen and the people working behind the scenes
wow
big up kon number 6 on trending
Finally
this shi gon took a year maybe
2:35 Where are you where are you
OMG I CLICKED THIS VIDEO IN 0.1 SEC
Can we have a part two for the gym video
Lon I love yur videos I’m a big fan you enspire me
YESSSS
14:04 I legit thought that was Mini Lad ☠☠
Great Video
my alexa added the  lazer to my basket xD
This was such an amazing video to watch, kon you are killing it
FINALLY
I don't understand one thing, if everything is wood, it's gonna be weak no ? So why they don't put metal or brick for certain part of the set.
Joist hangers are upside down bro
Kon you just made my alexa buy a dewalt green laser level😭😭😭😂👋
Kon is legit one off the main players that hold the sidemen together
thanks Kon alexa added laser measurer to my shopping list while watching this haha
Yo Kon looking hella slim, fair play bro ❤️
Kon looking more slim looks like that gym and workouts are paying off man keep it up
We already know this series is gonna be an absolute popper seeing the progress is going to be unreal. Also I love it when the rest of the crew are in the videos just chilling and having a laugh, they deserve some light after all the great work they do for the other boys.
when your mates walked into the office one of them looked like pep guardiola
Come too Islam for life after death
How much did this set up cost you? Brilliant set up btw!
wht happened to the gym video
Kon, John and his camera mates playing around with that fishbulb-lens perspective. Like it was an alt-rock music video from 2001.
hi my name is exactly the same as urs my name is also konstantin🙂🙂
NOT THE TITIAN RUN LMAO
Happy to see that Kon has his own Kon 😂
FINALLY
They AIR KONNED THE ROOM HUHHHHHHHH!LOL
Who are the blokes that are doing good the building
yesssssssssssssssssssss
Yesssss finally
the studio is looking sick. can't wait to see the final thing!
Love your videos as always 💪🏻  And Sidemen Sunday was absolutely jokes! 😂
sick production on the Hole of the Wall set! Incredible. GL on your future work Kon!
Kon in the beginning: tiny 360 camera  "So this is the 360 camera, and this attachment is a selfie stick that is also a battery, and this is a microphone that attaches here, and this is a light, so you can film at night or lit your scenes, and with this extra attachment, you can now have a screen, so you know what you are filming, and then there's one that is a 20 kilos battery power bank and this..."  Kon in the end: ginormous standard cinema 8k camera with steady cam arm and vest.
Man I love this series! 🔥
Kon i know you won’t see this but you accidentally added a laser measurer to my alexa wishlist
man that camera is legit the perfect vlogging camera
Who knew building rooms and 360 go so well together? Would love to see a timelapse of when your installing everything (it already going to look super amazing)
Finally! After years of waiting😭
FINALLY
Sickk
Kon looks like he’s dropping lbs
Love videos like this! Keep doing them 😊💖
He made 3 Simon setup tour vid this is gonna be like a 9 part series or sum
BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSS AHHHH
Man like Asheville yanoo
finally
Jon I’m loving this content bro the room transitions are sick I hope you do more bro
kon the boss man getting shit done is kinda sexy y'know
TV SHOW 📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺📺
What software is free and easy to track like kons?
finally
7:39 2 white guys discussing about the small room for the new slave        just a joke
Love how after 4 months its barely started
14:09 Guardiola is that you?
So much work! Great work Kon. And my god! I am so excited for JJ’a room
We're so proud of you Kon
Finally
odds on you building a bunker underneath your studio
you are so wholesome 🥺🥺
Hey Kon! I hope you are doing well.
Kons looking wham
What about Behzzzy boos setup?
Ashville are cowboys
Damn Ricky tho🤤
Kon is looking much slimmer and that’s good to c
Just curious. What do they do with these builds after the shoot?
Yesss
Wish I didn’t have my Alexa directly below my tv now
awesome video!
I knew looking at hole in the wall that production was going to be mad. Making moving walls in that studio from scratch is insane
Whats happened to harrys room?
FINALLY
Kon = banger!🔥
Just a couple of nerds having fun how hilarious 😂😂😂🔥🔥
🙏🏿👑
FINALLY
The room is already done don't lie to us
I love how happy the builder was to show off his laser measure🤣
Maybe have greenroom on 2nd floor overlooking studio. The edit suit can be kept quiet etc
those stairs are exactly like my temporary stairs i had in my houser while it was being renovated and now i have a beautiful oak staircase
Is it mad that I’m more interested in this than sidemen Sunday?
KEEP IT UP KON!!
The studio is coming along very well. However, I do have a concern about the door 14:42, won't the black door (when fully open) hit the wooden door?
Kon looking slim 💪
Only been about 2 years
Finally Less gooo!!!
Keep the vlogs coming !
I literally can't wait to see how the studio turns out 🔥🔥
I’m loving these updates on your studio and life in general. One of my favorite channels atm
Awesome job bro.
hey kon great video i need a new laptop and was wondering whats the one you was using in this video..
Kon u got your teeth done recently?
♥️
You should do a small setup under the stairs, that’s for voiceover work, so any voiceover stuff you need to do, a small hidey hole it will be out the way, and you can put the soundproofing all over the walls and door, and seal, think that’s a cool idea, great video once again!
Fuck sake Kon, you almost made me buy a laser measuring device! Dont do my Alexa like that man!
thought it was Pep Guardiola at 14:10
Kon I have to say, your videos are top tier content and quality. I love it. Keep going my guy! You're a major inspiration to me in the video produciton and photography world
finally fuckin hell
Thanks 👍🏼👍🏼, been waiting for long 😭
It took you long enough i was wondering when pt 2 was coming
thanks for adding a laser measure thing to my amazon basket!!
This room is gonna be insane
Been waiting for this lets go
Love these setup and building videos!
Kon is like the cole bennet of the sidmen in terms of setups and camera work
Woii kons lost a lot of weight
you need a slide from the 1st floor to the ground floor
It begins.
Shout  out Ashvile!
Kon, you are a legend. Thank you for all the hard work you do, to provide us such entertaining entertainment
I can't wait see final finished room tour ❤🥺😭
Finally, it's been wayyy too long
Kon looking fit!
Kon added the lazer measuring thing to my basket😂
You know you’re getting old when you enjoy this more than sidemen Sunday.
Finally happening lol
16:6 POV : your are being eaten by a titan
Finally.
Todays sidemen sonday was hilarious my jaw dropped laughing
Finally
Kon 11:03 almost made me buy a laser measurer 😅
this man is using the thirtyvirus background music (ik its not his). Oh the memories :)
Yeeeees finallyyyyy
my fav series
Kons crew is so joke like they all seem legit friends
one thing I really like about these videos is the fact that we can see the progress on all these 'side' projects of Kon. It also motivates me to work towards my dreams since I have a lot of projects I want to work on myself~
11:32 we all know what he said lmfao
Editing is always sick bro!!
Finally
kon mate you just added a laser measurer to my amazon basket
is there no need for pillars for the second floor of your studio? it looks like you would need to be very careful not to go through the floor
Love too see u upgrading ur buisness
no idea about uk laws but you should wear a helmet just saying
Omg kon finally
There's so much beauty in the struggle indeed.
YES KON YES
This video is gonna blow up for Kon, keep up the great work. Maybe this is the banger you need to lift up your channel. 👏🏻
You need to do a hide in seek in the studio.
