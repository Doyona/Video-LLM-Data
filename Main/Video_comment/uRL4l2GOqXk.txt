This is why we need President Trump to run for a third term because they changed the law after he was born. Third Term Trump is Grandfathered In. And Larry David thinks it's GREAT!!!!
I love how Sharon shouts “Raaandy” 😂😂😂
Okay, how much?
If you hands are dirty , you WASH them.  If your ass is dirty; smart, civilized people, WASH it.  Japan, most of Europe.   In North America they just smear it around with a piece of paper ( killing trees).   How Gross !
I'm watching this while sitting on a japanese toilet 👀. Lile this comment so that I can watch the video again while I take a dump during work hours.
Experiencimg Japanese toilets while backpacking in Japan literally felt like this. It was bliss
My sister paid $3K for a freaking toilet like that.  Talk about flushing your hard earned money....
Same esthetic shopping at a Ford dealer VS a Lexus dealer
If only Home Depot actually showcased this.
Jesus loves you repent he is coming back he died for your sins please ❤😊s
Ol' blue 😂
Me after getting home from Japan “Well back to Neanderthal times”
the fact that someone learned japanese for the translation on the sign is so peak good job guys (i speak a decent amount of japanese and can read and translate this sign XD)
I went to Japan for the first time in my life in 2024. My toilet now has three Japanese toilets. Take my money!
I was in Japan... and yes it'ts true :D and yes, they can play music. hell i wonder how long until they start cleaning your room XD
Anyone think Randy should have to work at Home Depot for his crimes?
India does not compare. They have open door shit spaces and worse than the Romans did...that Society in needs to clean up it's act or be cleaned up. You literally can't live in that s*** hole.
Its exactly like our trip to the Water Suppy Store where they sell hot tubs😂.  Yes we did buy one and still use it
America needs bidets they are a 3rd world country until they get them
Poor ole blue…
Home depot guy
It's car
Really make them
1:02 HELP-
0:52
I locked myself in a stall at Narita Terminal, it was AMAZING.
I’d love to try this like my namesake did
Wtf is there no full episodes
Name of the Song that start when Randy try the toilette!?
😅😅😅
No podría venir de ningún otro lado del mundo
Dude  outside
Yes
It's car
That was exactly me in Japan. Poking the buttons.
I got a toilet ad for this
Poor Americans, those toilets are for commoners in Japan and Korea. Suck up to Asians.
Wow!
That music 😅😅😅
"Old Blue"😂
Wait!  Is that what I’ve been missing for 57 years?
som1 can give me the link to the episode when 2 guys come to randy home and need to give sword to his son and he stole a car and beat the driver looolllll !!! I cant find it :(
3:13 the look of DETERMINATION on Randy’s face 😂  Like.  I’m gonna rise to the occasion and overcome this challenge
I watched this falling asleep.. I fell asleep and dreamt Randy did IT with some random dude............ I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT
Actually  make these
I just used my bidet and had to come watch this. I wish I could have that music play whenever I use it 😂😂
None of those toilets have a safety belt though!
Really messes with my perception of time. There's no way I was in middle school 2 years ago. Still so nostalgic!
ITS A PARTY IN THERE😂😂😂
I have an added heated seat on my toilets. First time I had family over, first person out of the bathroom whispered…she has a heated seat!  😂🤣. Have not installed the bidets yet, mite be too controversial. 😂
Im 7 and im watching this
Having a warm seat is the best thing to have in cold winter.
The perks of a Japanese toilet...ever tried one?! 😆 (this episode never grows old... Lol ) LPeaceM 💙☮🎵
あと、トイレットペーパーの使用量が飛躍的に少なくなりましたね。 ただし、電気代が少し上がります笑
They had those at google;I never used the wand
the japenese toilet joke song is more relaxing than youtube lofi beats lol
No ectoplasm?
True. So true.
Once you go bidet you never go back!! 😁
"no toilet. the pile of clothes at the end of the hallway has worked well for years." -master shake 😂 🍻
1:20  like always.. illegals at home depot… like always south park adds it.
The awesome attraction of a heated seat in the cold cold winter....
Let's demand South Park does another Charlie Kirk episode, doing what Israel was harassing him to stop doing -- questioning why we were supporting the Nit&yahoo's slaughter of innocent Palestinian children by the thousands!!  We want more Charlie Kirk!
What season and episode is this?
BBVAAAAASS 1:30 1:30 1:30 1:
Wow 1:30 beersaASSZZS
Yup
U homosexual?.
ANY TIME😇😇😇😇😇
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Everybody’s search history: -Japanese toilets -cost of Japanese toilets -toilets with Bluetooth -toilet no toilet paper
Why this comes up while I am in toilet 😂
I love how he says “old blue” to the Home Depot worker like he’d know what that means
I might have to trade up from my Gerber Viper!  Going on 3 years since install and haven't snaked it once!
I dont want the government tracking my shit from a smart toilet😂😂😂
This is why I want to try a Japanese toilet now
Getting tickled by a toilet is crazy bros league is dunked by  a toilet
Shame that they didn't get Mr Slave to try one of these.  'Woo - Jesus Christ!'
Weird just came acros this news were evil people are injecting needles in papertoilet with HIV stay safe
When I was in Tokyo, the very first thing I did immediately after my long flight was the Japanese toilet and the rumors are true you guys.
Sharon: No Don't Lift The Lid Me: Why Not? Mario needs to plunge your toilet I'm a plumber Remember Ma'am? 🪠
Right this way Sir. My name is Rick. Let me know if there’s anything I can do.
0:53 Shelly: *“GROSS DAD!!!”*  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you see a fan display ?
👰
That's a hard sell right there
I’m fookin 💀 The music playing when he goes in for the test drive: Oh yeah! lol 😂
as a person that lives in japan and has no bidet, i yearn for this. i love mall bathrooms cuz they wash ur ass.
Randy is playing Hogwarts Legacy
Poor ol'blue :(
😂
loesoe going crazy
Randys my favorite charactor
Rick is chill and a good employee and co worker
😂
Driers take a while so a combo of air and few squares of paper is nice.  Plus you get too soft without wiping.  Next time you wipe it feels like 60 grit.  So water, drier,  then wipe keeps you a little tough for the good.
They forgot to add something when Randy went to HD, all the annoying employees saying how you doing, how you doing, how you doing, how you doing, how you doing, how you doing...and hasn't even walked down 1 isle yet.
The Japanese toilet has more buttons than a 747 cockpit’s. Then you go to a public one. Then it’s the opposite. It’s a hole on the ground where you have to squat to shit.
I can attest this is 100% for reals!  Japanese toilets are the best.
The whole tegridy farms thing is so lame, ruined randy as a character
It’s true a smart toilet makes you ask how much?
Imagine being angry over a "powder room toilet." Like lady you should be literally grateful to have a man that provides you a house with a literal powder room😂 At that point, my ass just leaving divorce papers will be in the mail ya ungrateful twat😂
I like they walk! 😁
Did you jiggle the handle killed me instantly
This can't be true!  USA is no. 1 in everything!
THey need this in India to motivate the animal-people to shit in potty instead of side of street like dogs, cats, cows and other animal cousins.
Why can't I lift the lid? 😂
Damn, that must be heaven! Would replace ol'Fergie for new  Kaka-San, how much are these???
This is on my top 10 to do list before I die! The only thing that would make a person embrace rather than fear diarrhea - welcome it and say 'bring it on, give me all you got' because I've got a little something for you... a Japanese toilet, mfer!!!! Yeah, take that! You want more, okaaaaay, say hello to my little Japanese toilet 💥💥💥!!!!!
Shit now i need a one
You're mad.  I'm not poor.
SOUTH PARK THEE GOAT
As a Sailor who was stationed in Japan, i can confirm i want one.
this is a weird question, but is that toilet song from something? so tempted to have it play automatically or via a button in the washroom as a meme almost sounds like enya
25 years owning a construction company. Toto. Period.
Where the music from 😅
Lol
the music killed me
Currently in Kyoto. These toilets changed my life
I had one in Japan.  The prostate cleaner was fabulous.
I can confirm that Japanese toilets are absolutely great. Best shit I took in my life
South Park 0:25
Just seen an article online about Japanese toilets lol
I just got back from Japan.  I never thought I would take a shit in a Panasonic.
That's my dream for a long time. Buying a japanese toilet when I own my house.
As someone from a culture where the use of bidets (shattaf) are expected, I'm always baffled at those cultures who rely entirely on toilet paper. Like you wouldn't ONLY wipe your hand if you sh*at on it, would you? Just use running water. It's much cleaner and simpler.
I’m used to bidets in my house however when I went to Japan their stuff was way way better.
Well, I'm not poor. 😂😂😂
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
basically every American who visited japan... im one of them. Toto Washlet+ is pretty affordable actually. All i care is the heated toilet, warm water, deodorizer, moving wand and dryer. Self open, music and lights are just luxury.
You might think this is a parody, exaggerating how Japanese toilets are, but it's really accurate... They even have them on their trains!
The Germans do a good toilet too.  Duravit vs Toto the battle continues.
Its car
This is how I feel but with Japanese wood joinery (Kigumi/木組み). So satisfying to watch!
This opening is severely overselling how interesting Hogwarts Legacy is. That game is boring as hell
OMG. OK, I had no idea South Park was this funny. I saw it once probably 15 years ago and didn’t like it at all. But, watching it now and it is hilarious. Now there are THREE shows that I have to live without because CBS and Paramount caved to the orange Satan. Matlock, Dexter: Resurrection, and South Park.  Damn!!!!!!
Kinda funny knowing that genuinely the only reason you'd need to replace a whole toilet is if you somehow physically break the toilet
Idk who's the bigger fraud
As a proud owner of two Japanese toilets, I can confirm this is exactly how it feels to use one. You just can’t go back.
Poor blue toliet 😥
And now we can buy them in other countries too.
I'll stick stick w/ my hygiene wipes; for the antimicrobial properties, of course.
I know it might seem like I'm just copying the top two comments but it's really true. I had a connecting flight via Haneda and my god, having a toilet clean your sphincter with warm water was one of the most surprising, yet pleasant experiences of my life
You grow up in America thinking we have the best of everything...then you use a Japanese toilet and feel like you've been a caveman your whole life.
They are that good
Watching this while on a normal toilet puts me to shame
Can confirm. My toiletry life totally changed once I got a one. We only by TP as a formality.
I had a japanese toilet when I was a baby...it was called my parents.
All true. Toyo is the Shitter of the Gods!!!
old blue lol
Haha this is actually true representation of Japanese toilet. Everytime I go to Japan, and when I get home....I get depressed just looking at my toilet
Poor ole blue
2 weeks in japan and using these types of toilets exclusively for 2 weeks had me thinking i was a damn caveman how we do it in the US. When we got back from japan I bought two of these toilets with bidet built in for the house and it was worth it. Going to japan changed me! 😂
THEY'RE YEARS AHEAD OF US
Ok how much 😂😂
I’ve put in a lot of these toilets and they are ridiculously expensive I put in a 5,000 dollar toilet and it’s ridiculous
Get the kohler high toilet way more comfortable
Had one in our London hotel last month. Rather pleasant experience, although be sure to set water pressure to low or medium. Had it on high and that thing squirted right up to my duodenum
No wonder there's more homosexual men these days haha
Japanese toilet:”I gave happy poopy time 😂”
Yeah I think thats enough internet for today
I don't know if he deserves a Japanese toilet with all of the Covid deaths on his hands.
I love the random video game nods they give throughout SP lmao, these dudes know their audience
After watching this, I want to know how much
Funniest part of this for me is the "olde blue" line as they haved lived there for like a year
Gotta love Tegrity Farms
can't belice Americans knew this now
Had the runs while in Japan, was forced to use a public toilet in a park at Tokyo. In Australia, this would normally be asking for a revolting experience. In Japan though, it was pure tranquillity.  Clean, pristine and even played ambiance to save my shame.  10/10 Japanese toilets are the peak of porcelain excellence
And then there are Chinese toilets....holes in ground and not advisable if you aim is poor.
Just went to Japan for the first time last year and experienced this..there is no exaggeration or dramatization
3:39 That’s Trey making fart sounds with his mouth if anyone else didn’t notice lol 😂
Idealistic as the sure...
The Japanese must never want to leave Japan and visit us cold butted heathens.
I thought it might be the Japanese _squat terlit!_ 😂
This reminds me of my dad especially the farting really loud...he was a plumber so would of loved the Japanese toilet experience 💩❤️👍...
"GROSSS DAAAD!" Lol Shelly is hilarious "TUUUUUUUUURDS!!!!"
This has to be top ten episodes of all time! Love it!
George Costanza would be in heaven !!!!
0:48 seriously 😂 that's the most disgusting announcement i ever heard😂
3:44
The background vocalizations when he's in the Japanese toilet room are sending me 🤣
Guys... dont give peasants Japanese toilets. They don't even clean it perfectly after using it like i do. I clean that thing like a art after using it.
Man the creativity of South Park creators is insanely good
They use to advertise sex tourism in Asia with Japanese teens on 60 minutes as news. Is it still cool to do them in the airport toilet if it’s in the international section.
after my upgrade, i'm reluctant to travel anywhere...transforming.
3:22 take off his pants
i'm poor
Wood paneling in the living room. Pastel pink tiles in the bathroom. A blue toilet. This house definitely needs a makeover from White People Renovating Houses. Just bust out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.
Made Tokyo
Does anyone know the name of the music played in this episode?
I hope Randy is most people's dad. I mean, he reminds me so much of my dad, complete with technological cluelessness, dark hair and moustache. 😂
だから空港のトイレから出てきた外国人がみんな妙に笑顔だったのか
Imagine he took his worlds biggest crap in that
No one does fart noises like South Park 🤣
It tickles your tain't.
"YOUR MOM TOOK A SHIT AND DOESN'T WANT ME TO SEE IT"😂😂😂 that music sounds like the callings "where ever you will go" 😂😂
The best way to think about the need for a bidet: If you got some poo on your arm....would you just wipe it off with a little paper?
Just went number two in a Japanese toilet for the first time ever in my life. That's why I'm here😊😂😅❤💕
0:44
It's  car
Me
Oh yeah
Really  make those
The  music
It don’t matter how much.
I did have kind of a big breakfast 😂😂😂😂
In Japan, many toilets come with bidet functions, but in reality, most places still provide toilet paper. I think a lot of people use paper to dry off after washing, and then maybe use the dryer. So, the paper industry doesn't need to assassinate Randy after all.  Heated toilet seats are definitely comfortable in winter. I've heard that Japanese-style toilets are becoming more common in the U.S. too, but are they still a minority?
3:39
I have one. It changed my life
3:38  💀
I can’t believe Sharon made Randy get rid of ol’ blue 😭
Stan sounds like Cartman now
Nothing beats hand washing
Ey, just dont touch the ATP button if you have a penis.
Bro 0:04
1:04 then why are you using it
3:46
his ass is clean......LOOOL...
A nice bidet attachment with all the features is like 200.. 😅
1:05 as usual?
Playing my switch 2 on my Japanese toilet realizing that only hard drugs can surpass this level of awesomeness
Firsttime i used a Japanese toilet, was at a place i worked at. It was fancy as could be. But... it had a seperate remote, wich i didnt know. So a colleague had it with him and he waited for for me to take a steaming log out for a ceramic slide of its life. When i took a seat, birthed that browntown baby and started searching for some toiletpaper, i heard that dude sneak up on me. He was laughing and sniffeling like a child who's up to no good on the other side of the door. When i asked "what you doing man?!" I suddenly heard a beep, a swiffle and a click. Out of nowhere, my ring 'o dooky got splashed with a hot stream of presurised water. The hit on my unsuspecting sphincter made me scream out loud for help. But alla's... it was to no avail. For that dude got the controles and he wasnt going to set me free anytime soon. Infact, when the blower started to whirl up, the windspeed was set to max and my bag 'o marbles was being blown left to right like a bumbling speedbag. Laughter came from everywhere, as i was franticly searching for a way out. Again, water... wind, water and more wind. At the end, my backside was washed so good, even days after you could see your reflection bouncing straight of of my shiny bum. And my innocent brown flower... was terrified for life. Japanese toilets... never... ever... again......😵‍💫
3:25
They forgot the waterfall when you pee and the birds when you poo, but the first time you realize that one button dries you off, you remember for the rest of your life! 🤣
C'mon Randy. A loose toilet handle is super easy to fix.
lol...,      water prouff dukt tayp,            iPreZZ oom ~~~
0:40 This is like the opposite of the More Crap episode, where Randy took a huge shit and immediately wanted Sharon to see it
Don't show that to Russian's
hey kids your mom just took a shit lol lololol
it’s simply better. You consume less toilet paper, means less shopping, less driving, less wasting money and the time.
I did have kind of a big breakfast
I love how this episode turns into a pro-earth, anti-toilet paper industry essay somehow LOLL
Golden Hour Podcast brought me here.
I regret wearing headphones & watching this
I hate when I go to a friend’s house and they have a regular toilet and the seat is cold…. 😜
A Home Depot employee coming to help you. Now that's funny.
in which episode does butters say "we don't want your aids"?
I think that randy is a cheap guy. I watched some of these episodes before
Inspired by ice
Lmao 😂
No plunger
Low flows
Home depot
😂😂
Why is Randy’s voice a bit different?
Poor old blue…
For all the savages that are still smearing poop around their butt with paper, instead of washing it.
These were $9k toilets during the pandemic, I’m sure they’ve doubled by now.
Ima tell your right now Japan knows what’s up  Plus they got more public bathrooms then you could imagine   Compared to most countries    The best 🇯🇵🎌
Randy needs to shave his mustache off he look more handsome if he does
The one misconception of this contraption, the creators of this episode made it seem like Randy was so foolish that he sits there enamored by the Japanese toilets, the thing is anyone that bought missed that they are meant for Japanese citizens, us Westerners already have great toilets whether septic, tank, or municipal...the perks of this toilet dont carry over IF they sell on YOUR land...thank you
I've lived in Japan for nearly 30 years and these things are now pretty much ubiquitous.
"Your my boy Blue!"  Randy Marsh
caveman discovering fire
*Ohh Yeaaahhhh*
I want to experience this. Everyone talks about how good it is
I’ve been living in and out of Japan for decades, I’m here again now. These types of toilets are standard in any Sheraton or Marriott Hotel.
I watched this clip while ON the toilet, making it an interactive experience. However I just use a regular American toilet & TP 🧻, because I’m a patriot, and I’m poor. 🇺🇸 🚽
😂
Doesn't look like the toilets i saw at the Tokyo tower in the 60s😂
You are supposed to use toilet paper before the washlet 😅 The washlet is for an extra rinse, not to clean the whole mess… 😅
Ok was it Matt or Trey who went to Japan and loved the toilets? 😂
Funny cause we all know a Japanese toilet is just a hole in the ground with no toilet paper or bidet.
Anyone stupid enough to freely give their money to a company who's ad promises a robotic puppy "so realistic you'll think it's real" deserves to lose ever last cent of it.  YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE IDIOT IF YOU EVEN FOR A SECOND BELIEVE THESE ADS!!
I wish randy got pissed at this and said "I wanna shit like an American dammit "
As one who seen this show from time to time since the first episode love how the animation got high res in time but they still bob their legs instead of moving them.
I wanna try one now XD
Been there, experienced that. Uh-mazing.
"Your mad" 😂
my first time with a japanese toilet, i didn't know it used a probe.  I heard a motor under my ass and I jumped away, I watched enough anime to not trust it.
Did you jiggle the handle? Randy, fix this damn toilet 😂😂😂
I help build a lot of rich people's houses. I've taken a few of these japanese models for test drives.
I'm Filipino and we use the tabo. Just need to add the music 😅
Ohh Yeah’s!!🎼
You still need to use toilet paper. In Japan is weird not using toilet paper and then the bidet feature.   I still think the Italian bidet is better tho, since you can’t really wash your cock with the JP ones.
The real joke is the Home Depot associate offering help
You can just hear Randy when you look at that picture on the toilet with his happily surprised faced   "Ooooh"
This is not even a joke. That's surprisingly accurate.
Why people don’t use bidets in NA is beyond me
Thx for 7 subs
Just 😂😂😂
I want it
The music kills me every time
1:30 onwards
I had the same experience. Too bad the toilet was like $6000 or i would have one myself.
This somewhat reminds me of the process you have to go through to get a Birken handbag.
South Park is right up there with prime Simpsons.
Man, I watched this while taking a shit on a regular ol American bowl and now me and my ass are sad.
omg that was too funny
The music when he walks in 😂
Okay. Right now I’m about to use a bidet for the first time. I’ve had the opportunity for a while now but I’ve been afraid. But if Randy can do it, I can. I’m sitting on the toilet now. It’s heated. Let’s do this!
"The toilet washes you completely clean..."                     "You're mad" 😂😭
Man i swear they are not exaggerating anything. This was my first experience with a japanese toilet and i bought one right away.
The transcendent music playing in the bathroom and then the crapping sounds.😆
I love how she doesn't like that he took the champagne.
no but seriously why doesn't home depot sell these toilets? is it dumb import laws?
Fr, almost feels as good as when she slips her tongue in there.
Not all Japanese toilets are the same. Many, including public toilets, have a trough system where you have to squat over it and your "product" is presented for you in all its glory afterwards.
"would you like to take one for a test drive" 😂  I also wonder if Trey and Matt use their elbows for the f sounds 😂😂😂
Just awesome how they indicate people just choose to be Gryffindor or Slytherin in Hogwarts legacy, my first choice was Hufflepuff and they have one of the two best designed houses. At Slytherin, hit the under water window a few times with a spell and see what happens 🦑🦑🦑
k, how much?
I just got back from Japan... they are fucking magical! Like having your ass kissed by an angel!
I lived three years in Japan… I hated it from the first day, but after experiencing a Japanese toilet, I decided I had to stay… And it took those three years to overcome my adiction, and finally get on the plane and resume my life. Please stay away from Japanese toilets… After the first experience, you will never be the same.
I'm not poor 😂😂
J'ai jamais été sur des toilettes japonnaise mais croyez moi sur parole, quand ça vas arriver je vais apprécier !
ohh uó
Ooookay, now I want one
Stayed at an airbnb in kyoto once during the dead of winter. The toilet wasnt hooked up to the water heater and omg being blasted with ice cold water down there is an experience you wont soon forget
Um, poop is sticky, and water alone will NOT adequately clean the area, wouldn't you need to still wipe away the dooky?
The shit noises in South Park are unmatched 😂
3:39 got me funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
U know what randy Good For You
3:38 😮
I own a ToTo Washlet and its incredible! 😂 the first time I used the Bidet feature it capyured my heart.. and poo particles. 😂
shelly acts exactly like her mother.
I work at home depot and this is how we show toilets
When i went to japan the toilets were exactly like this and honestly a huge highlight of the trip. My goal is to get one as soon as i can, no one understands completely until youve tried
🇸🇽
$1000
Best  episode 😂
A car
Make sure not to waste money
Imagine having test toilets at the stores? Gross 😅
Currently in Japan on one of these toilets watching this and it’s magical
Just press the "W" thank me later 😊
The Four Seasons  presidential suite in Orlando has one of these. The toilet seat opens and light turn on when you walk in.  kind of unnerving if you're not expecting it.
Hahahaha
Poor ole Blue 😢
The music is the best part😂😂
When I went to Tokyo for the first time I had no idea how to flush the toilet  Their was no flusher then I noticed the touch screen panel which was obviously in Japanese  I was mesmerised by the whole experience 😂
Me too Randy, me too
One feature is the masking music to save user from embarrassment..but i had a Russian friend who prefers to release as much noise as possible. His philosophy is, whomever puts his ears near my butt, deserves what he hears😅😅😅😅
I've been to Japan three times, each time wowed by their toilets, including in public spaces. They were, every time, the most impressive part of my trip. Also, the doors and dividing walls between stalls go down to the floor for total privacy. ❤️
So true...
But did he wash his hands?
When I win the lottery, I won't say much...but there will be signs
プロジェクトXのウォッシュレットの回を見た後だと、とても感慨深いなぁ～～ 人類に幸せを！
Search lavelle Crawford bidet. Hilarious😂😂😂
That's weird.  I spent about 2 weeks in Japan once... traveled all over... and I do not have a single memory of any particularly amazing pooping experience.  So... apparently it is not ALL toilets in Japan that are so special.
I think master bathrooms in homes should have two toilets so both spouses can go at the same time.
While I love America and all that, there are PLENTY of things that the US can learn from other countries. Toilets and public restrooms being one such thing. XD
Those farts upon the music 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i miss heidie Heidi Turner
Yee they are that good
As a man, this hits hard. I love my thrown. It is a sacred place. But those wonderous pinnacles of technology the Japanese have made cannot be denied. The magnificence is beyond mortal words. One must experience the cleanliness to understand...
i still don't understand why americans cleans only with toilet paper or do you guys wash with water first and clean again with tp?
There is two cathegories of people in this earth, those who look at this video on the toilets, and those looking at this video while they are eating
They actually did a Randy episode that isn’t just promoting weed
This makes me want to go out and splurge for a Jap toilet!!
I watched to the end to find out the price, then got left hanging
Been to Japan.   Had my backside lovingly attended to by Japanese automatons.  Can confirm the bliss.
No music or auto lid but the heated seat, wash settings and warm air dry is da bomb. 😎
Actually win was school    best  episode was manbear pig
Listen
It's  car
currently im watching this short sitting on my poor people toilet😢
I never knew I needed a heated toilet seat until I used a Japanese toilet 😂
"You're MAD..."😦😂
It's January 2025, I am in Osaka now, in an Airbnb, sitting on one such toilet, using Google Lens to translate the buttons and enjoying the experience while watching this youtube vid.
🤮🫨😪
New topics:
A fagit ,gun, dice game. 😮
I want one. How much? I'm not poor.
What song plays in the toilet room?
Randy's a fucking legend
Totally false. Finding an underpaid employee at one of these huge home improvement stores that knows anything about what they sell without looking it up on their phone?
Naturally they’re serving champagne while selling toilets.
I want a jap toulet now
Challenge excepted
I have a Japanese toilet
No plunger?
Put  plunger
The  best 1
Seems to criminal to use such a toilet
When do we get the Trump wearable model?
Poor Ol’ Blue
I DO LIVE IN JAPAN AND YES, IT IS ALL TRUE
3:20 please tell me there’s something else to this music
Commenting so i can get more South Park in my home feed
F the women that demand men to fix everything.
They had me at "8 times cleaner".
I went to japan and i can comfirm the toilets are cool
After spending nearly 20 years of my life in Japan, whenever I go to poop in another country it feels like I'm going back to the stone age.
If we really want aliens to understand humans, we need to send every South Park episode into space.
i love you randy
0:48 “Hey guys! Your Mom took a shit and doesn’t want me to see it.”
I thought it was an introduction to Japanese women. I felt relieved(*๓´╰╯`๓)
Low flows  yeah  what about  plunger ?
Then there's the other Japanese toilet. A hole in the ground.
it's all true
Me, an ex-employee at Home Depot, over here pointing out all the ways this is inaccurate about Home Depot.
Hey Randy I'll by some weed is it gass i beat it is i beat it is
😂😂😂 the music selection for the toilet gets me
Japanese toilets are cool, but i find cooler in Qatar : the shower. Cold water, pretty strong jet, but you got nothing, even at the door of intimity. You feel so clean.
im german and i want this so bad.
I  tried it during my japanese trip. Pooping experiene will never be the same again.
You and I collide sounds like the song.
Believe me , after first try , no toilet paper anymore .
We can't just get rid of old blue!
Sorry if u got a hairy ass you gonna need that paper still lol. The asains tend to nvr hit puberty
The bidet jet makes me tighten my sphincter real hard and the water doesn’t go deep. Baby wet wipes are the best! “And little bit of toilet paper afterwards to get that moisture out”.
I hope that sales associate got a nice commission.
Randy's immaturity warms my soul
"Hey guys, your mom took a shit and doesn't want me to see it"  -Randy
Yah...but toilet paper still needed.
After watching this, I can't keep this scene from Thermae Romae Novae out of my mind.
I want a japanese toilet!!!
3:38 That is the best fart sound effect EVER. Hands down.
Man i love how Southpark fits the songs perfectly    Sorry 4 bad english im from India

28 seasons, a movie trilogy & the video games.
Never felt buying japanese toilets almost thought buying luxurious cars in a showroom.  YOU CAN TEST DRIVE. 😂
I live in Japan. I can never go back to our barbaric ass-similators. I'd feel... polluted.
It would've been funnier if he screamed HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!!
Don't remember when was the last time 😭 😆 so hard from SP like from this 🇯🇵🚽
👘🚽🍑🌊✨🌈🌤️🙏🏻
But I thought Japanese toilets were at ground level and you needed to squat, not sit?
We were going to have this all over our city’s public bathroom, but people think it’s a waste of money… they are mad
I haven't seen them /as/ insane as that, but a heated seat in the middle of a cold night is a godsend. So is the bidet function.
Washes ur butt
Make  trip home depot
“We can’t just get rid of Old Blue, Sharon” LOL
I have one and I love it
What do the the Japanese characters say at the end? I'm guessing they chose something funny...
I stayed in japan for 12 days and had this joy 24 times. Too detailed? Yes so was the toilet’s care and nurturing
Japanese public parks have these luxury toilets that even our luxury stores don’t
It's literally first thing I go when I arrive in Japan airport, except cup noodles.
Moved here to Japan 4 years ago and this is very accurate depiction of toilets in Japan, I recently went to a  City Fair in a huge park with my family and obviously in typical Japanese style these places are full of food stands so obviously their is those mobile trailer toilets, and in my home country of Australia these are often grotesque filthy hot boxes,.. well not here in Japan, let's just say it was like entering a paradise, fully air-conditioned, with modern decor and flowers and the walls were pleasantly painted with nature scene and music 🎶 playing softly, I didn't want to leave.. I'd say it was better than some 5 star hotel toilets back home.. this a an example of their pride in hygiene services...
I'm curious why she's using the powder room's toilet, because apparently that's the one guests use.
Who is in 2024?
I just installed a bidet on my toilet. This is accurate. 😂
The guy standing outside the door listening the whole time 😂😂😂😂
3:11 future of Exotic toilets. 😂
Japanese toilets are magical ❤❤❤
Cue every person that has been to Japan now must tell us all how they've been to Japan. Yeah we've all been to Japan, we all live in Japan or have lived in Japan. we've all used bidets and Japanese toilets...no one cares. Just watch the clip and stfu.
lol I’m taking a 💩while watching this 😂
Hi Rick he would like to look at the Japanese tolite’s
im gay
now do india toilet xD
I just came here for Sons of Maria's song.
なんじゃこりゃー😂
Just a $35 bidet attachment is a complete game changer compared to a normal toilet.  It ain't luxurious or whatever lol, but you don't have to use nearly as much TP and it cleans you WAYYYY better.  Going back to using TP or even wet wipes, you realize your butthole was never actually properly being cleaned.
I’ve got a few days left til I go back home from Japan- I’m taking a dump as much as I can lol 😂
If Stan lives at a farm now, how's he going to be able to hang out with his friends Kyle Eric and Kenny and butters and his girlfriend Wendy?
japan has the best toilets but they dont have mexican food WHY DO THEY HAVE GREAT TOILETS BUT NO MEXICAN FOOD? THAT RUINS THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE thats like buying a ferrari and not bringing it on a race track
Low flows
It's  car
Yes , after I had explosive diarrhea from bad sushi in Japan , I used a Japanese Toilet and with afresh rinse with warm water my arse was clean again.
My cousin has one
I'll be in Japan in 2 weeks - can't wait to shit there. They actually forgot an important function - the Japanese toilets also remove the poop smell through a charcoal filter. Truly a great time to be alive.
As someone who has spent time in Japan, I strongly recommend the TOTO brand. They're all over Japan. They're the best!
Just imagine if electricity will shut down.
I live in Tokyo, and have one of these toilets. When I enter the bathroom, the lid opens by itself, a light comes on inside the bowl, and around the bottom, so I don't have to turn on the light when I go to the bathroom at night. The seat is heated, it does this automatically, depending on the season. If you want to raise the seat, a touch of a button does that. The seat and lid lower by themselves. Before you do your business, the toilet sprays water on the inside of the bowl, so nothing sticks to it. If you are going to take a dump "Dumb and Dumber'" style, there is a button you can use which will play music to drown out the sound. Depending on the design of your toilet and home, some use a negative pressure system which draws the air outside, so there is no smell. Once you are done, you can choose from one of three kinds of cleaning jets to wash your backside. The water is warm, you can set it to be as warm or cool as you like. Many toilets do have a drying function, but it takes awhile, so most people use toilet paper. How much does one cost? A basic model costs about $500, a top-level model is about $5000 .
Once you experience them, you do whatever you can go find a TOTO toilet for your home
A model like that sells for about $10,000.00!
I can confirm that they are great!
I can confirm Japanese toilets are absolutely amazing!
That's gross to NOT use toilet paper
I have one of these toilets. It is my best friend.
I want a Japanese toilet.
The only thing you cant pack on a vacation is the bidet 😢😢😢
A trip to japan made me buy a Toto washlet+ .. since people spend 2-3 hours on toilet nowadays, its totally worth it.
I used to have one of those Japanese toilets at my old house, so I can confirm that the video is true.
This is BS, but still funny show tho
I just bought a Japanese toilet because of this clip
Japanese toilets are awesome.  I don't know why they don't have them everywhere.
ol' blue😂
John 14:6 "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'" To get to heaven is simple, Jesus is the only way to heaven. We are all sinners but through him we may live again. Amen
How often do you see a blue toilet?  Burying it was such a waste, I'd use it in the backyard as a humorous planter.
One of the reasons I decided to stay in Japan was the toilets. The best part was saying goodbye to haemorrhoids by using the 'massage' function to dilate you without the need to squeeze.
Heaven must be like making on a Japanese toilet.. 😂
What savages still only use toilet paper and not any bidet?
I love my Japanese toilet!!! The automatic suction cup for when your constipating works amazing. I can't tell you how incredible this is. It basically pulls it right out. It has made downloading definitely a lot more pleasant and painless.
Had 2 of those installed at home. They're intimidating at first with all the options but not bad. Heated seat and lighting is neat.
I use a serrated hole in the ground.
She throws a hissy fit because the toilet wasn't strong to swallow her massive turds. I didn't think it was possible to choke a toilet to death but there you have it.
Japanese is so small. Soooo small. While Americans are huge. Sooo huge.
Randy’s voice is different.  I don’t like it.
3:16
0:48 Killed me
Immer wieder gern gesehen.
😅😅  it's  car
You never forget your first time 😳
3:39 oh dear I have to shit
Its actually false they clean terribly and are gross, you need the friction of toilet paper
I can't afford these, but I do live in a rural area. Every time I'm done pooping, I go outside and use the garden hose to clean my ass.   Best feeling ever, water really is the best way to clean there, you feel so good. So I believe people when they say those Japanese toilets are the best.
I love my Japanese toilet. It knows how warm I like my seat for my morning dump, and sprays my anus in a circular motion at a lukewarm temp, just the way I like it too.
Okay...I need to save up for a Japanese toilet. Poor or not, it sounds worth it.
This song is perfect to this scene.
海外の人からした日本のトイレの認識ってこんな感じなのね笑笑
A dad playing a sons game is very realistic
The way that toilet paper roll was placed is illegal.
😂 the music is just so hilarious 😆😆😆 omg this episode is brilliant
Doesn't Japan have toilets that play music specifically for the purpose of drowning out the sounds of you shitting so others can't hear it? If I heard the toilet start playing shit time music I'd know exactly what they're doing, though.
this episode changed my life, ive since gone paperless
I can tell you, with Japanese girlfriend it's kinda the same..
Is randy playing hogwarts legacy
I hate Randy!
It does not surprise me that I have to find out from South Park that such a thing exists.
Randy takes the most cinematic shit of his life.
Who else is watching while having a poop?
This is true! Did a deployment out in Japan! And had to bring a Japanese toilet home!
Old blue 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Didn’t see a sink in there…
Jordan Schlansky approves
the toilet washes me clean nice no toilet paper
blue tooth
Seat warmers nice
Ha ha Japanese toilets 😂
Sparkling water would have been the more responsible and sophisticated choice.
I stayed in a Polish hotel with Japanese toilets. The business meeting the next morning was everyone talking about the Japanese toilets. They really are awesome.
“ hey guys your mom took a shit and doesn’t want me to see it” got me laughing 😂
I was watching it while actually using the toilet 😅
As a former HD employee,  unfortunately this is not true.   Lmao
I never heard of japanese toilets until south park today which is 9/3/24 lol one site said they were 22k$ lol im a truck driver and ive noticed alot of folks sound like they getting baths in the other stall lol
Sons mof Maria - Days of Blue That's the song the toilet plays.
Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePsEG_zQAE thank me later hahaha.  The best laxative i've ever heard!!
This is the Republican Party now?  Right?  Jimmy and Pat all the cocaine freaks.  I seen ya at legion too.....I don't think it's that conservative anymore?  Do you?  I guess it depends on who ya ask or what ya all wanna do fer a vote?
I found the Japanese toilet song on Amazon music “ Days of Blue “ Sons of Maria
your disrespect towards lisa alisha is unforgivable
dont discuss lisa in any capacity
Randy is so fucking awesome 😂
At our room on holiday, there was one. Of course, we both had to test drive it before we did anything.
0:46 DONT RANDY
GROSS DAD! 😠 -shelly
That’s weird
Weird
Okay how much?? 😅😅
I spent a couple of minutes once searching for a flush button in a toilet room in some cafe in Tokyo. It appeared on the toilet paper holder.
Poor old blue
I want one!
This is so ridiculous...lol.
HILARIOUS
The toilet music is hilarious to me
I did have quite a large breakfast 🍳 😂
"I'm not poor"
Word of advice in Japan. If you’re a guy never press the pink button or you will end up with soaking wet balls. Ask how I know.
“What did you do to it?” Exactly what my dad said when something that was 100 years old broke down
Do not install one of these at work or nothing will ever get done!
I'm not poor...
Sons Of Maria - Days Of Blues
They way he said "youre mad" 2:47
To be honest, I turned into a Randy
😂😂😂
I had the distinct pleasure of using a high tech toilet in 2017 visiting the Okura Prestige Hotel in Taipei, Taiwan. I found out why it took so long for the toilet rooms, like full length wooden doors, to become vacant. If you ever get a chance, get a Toto, it is like Christmas.
South park is 💩 💩 💩 💩.
3:38 The best asmr in the world
The music kills me everytime
LMFAO I legit have this in my crib, it's fantastic
There would be no way in hell I'd feel clean if I didn't at least wipe the water off
Ok how much?
Dont think this technology would work on American butts. Just to much fat and everything to properly clean and blowdry. Would only work for in shape people.
Is it Really clean? Or now do you have other  people's sh💩 on you 😂
2:25 did Home Depot let them advertise this cause they have the actual brand here
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I left my wife for a Japanese toilet.  Smartest move I've ever made.
I used fancy toilets in Japan. You still need paper.
I wonder how much it costs and if there is a warranty.
You can touch Heaven with very little cost. Get a portable bidet.
"Hey guys, your mom took a shit and doesn't want me to see it!" Lmao
Am I the only one that thinks an in toilet bidet is gross?  Think about it, it sits IN THE TOILET BOWL, what's stopping it from getting fecal matter on it? then it sprays that right up into your rear, and balls?  disgusting.
I just use the 3 sea shells  🐚
Classic example of Hollywood rich people losing touch with the common man. One of the worst episodes ever because 99 pc of people watching it had no clue what a 2000 dollar toilet feel like. Including me.
Had this same experience. when I was staying in a top notch hotel in Singapore..it was heaven indeed❤
I’m dying to test drive a Japanese toilet.
Swiss made and sold to Japanese. Swiss toilets...
🇺🇸🇺🇦❤‬‬🤍💙‬‬💛🌹🇮🇱🤍‬‬💙‬‬
"I'm not poor"
I love flying through Tokyo....best darn toilet experience there is. 😅
At first I thought the guy before me must have been runnin hot, but alas, even the public Japanese toilet seat was heated.
I watched this while on a cold toilet 🥹
Watching this on my american toilet
And how do it work with a women periode. 😮😮
And the typical South Park farting, shitting noises.. If there's one thing that hasn't changed in my life, its the beautiful creativity of South Park, truly amazing 10/10
If you have to ask "how much" you can't afford it.
Bought a Toto washlet. Can confirm.
Visiting Korea, I once had a very big breakfast. The hotel room toilet fixed it so I didn't need to take a shower.
I dont see what these have over an outhouse.
Living in Japan and having experienced these toilets, I spend more time washing my bum than I do going 💩.
This is what American teach they're kids...
Now I want one
Once you have experienced a Japanese toilet you'll put them in all your bathrooms.
But how much does a Japanese toilet actually cost?
In France there's a startup called "BOKU" which is a pun for "beau cul" = "nice ass" (and there's much more...), which can install a proper bidet to a regular toilet seat for like 100-200€. Even a portable version for 50€ !  The use of water is truly way more hygienic. Though I'd always keep some toilet paper, with water or spit (maximal adherence and friction reduced to zero, that's just the basics), and of course hand washing in any fucking case.
how much xD
3:39 ayo! i was feeling it!
😂😂😂
Randy Discovers Japanese Toilets
Back in the 70's The Jet magazine had a article about the Jap toilet and my father showed it to me lol I was only 6 or 7 years old at the time.
It’s funny how Randy doesn’t react to a toilet having a Bluetooth functions but he can’t believe it has seat warmer
One thing we can all agree is that Japanese has the most cleanest but holes on the planet
Got my Toto back in 2016 when I bought my building, best 2k ever spent!!!
Facts. These and sedation dentistry - both were life-changing and I will never go back. Anything less is barbaric.
Wonderful introduction to Japanese Toilets.  It's too bad that so many westerners are still not using one or at least a bidet hose.  You never want to go back to just toilet paper.
since I saw this episode I bought two japanese toilets now I am in peace with myself
I mean, they still recommend you to wipe after washing
The "oye" sound effect is tremendous 3:19
Watching this and trying to hold in my laughter as I’m riding this Shinkansen in Japan 🤣
J😅
Watching this currently at my shift at home Depot. Weird.
I am wondering, why don't someone mention that these back-to-front jet bidet splash (or not?) water mingled with poop towards the urethra?
The music got me LOL
Japanese toilets 😂
I want one.
Watching this while i'm on toilet😂
he's not wrong
0:07  Harry potter ? 🤨
Japan has the world's best toilets, but no Mexican food.  That's like owning a Ferrari that you never take to the track.
Way too funny.
There's a fun film called, simply, Toilet, written and directed by Japanese filmmaker Naoko Ogigami. Starring Tatiana Maslany of Orphan Black. At the end of the film there's an expression of gratitude for Toto, a manufacturer of toilets, for the use of an authentic Japanese "washlet" near the end of the story. One of the few times I've had no problem with a film's offering a plug for a corporate entity.
3:38  It's amazing how they created the fart sounds
Had one installed completely free.  Complements of VA.
They have these at my golf course, it's Japanese owned
reminds me of a south park episode
3:19 😂😂😂 it's so funny oh yeah after randy drop his pants
Were electric bidets not a thing in US until recently?
There is something weird about Randy's voice. Or has it just changed very gradually throughout the seasons? I am mostly familiar with the episodes between maybe 1997-2010, more or less, so maybe that is why I feel that way.
Not gonna lie I would kill to have a Japanese toilet
Wes watson likes water on his bum
aside from cartman.. randys the second worst human in south park.
Ok, makes me wanna go try it out myself. But it’s gonna be years before this new technology comes to the rest of the world.
Sophisticated high-tech Japanese toilets have never felt so luxurious…
wow, imagine those toilets being the actual future
Lol this reaction is so American, I live in Russia and I didn't expect this reaction at all. In Russian movies they joke about Japanese poilets like you come there and you don't even know what botton you should press so it's a very awful experience like you come out leaving the toilet dirty because to know how to plush the water you gotta be a doctor of engineering. This is how Russian people see Japanese toilets - not good at all
This is a very accurate re enactment of my own experience - except the dryer wasn't strong enough to completely dry my hairy old ass 😢😂
Chogoink franky is very expensive action figure from Japan. Love you.
Love you Randy love you
My lucky chogoink franky is possessed by Loki it’s worth on eBay $ 6000
It’s funny that Japanese toilet like these really exist 😂😂😂
animation parody police party dog toilet...
South park does the best poo sound effects in media history.
Just installed my Toto washlet today… it’s all true
I'm watching this while taking a shit at the same time 😂😂
Remember when Randy used to be a geologist?
you guys never used japanese toilet before??  This vid is true to the every last bit
bothers tf out of me as a non-american just how much westerners spend on toilet paper. when they could just be washing their asses clean with water instead
What was Randy playing?
The music that plays is, "Days of Blues" - a nice easter egg for Ol' Blue!
Makes me remmeber a school trip where we had a bidet in the bathroom. My classmate, not knowing what it is, misstook it for a urinal and took a piss and than pressed the button which he thought would flush it. At that time we heard a scream and shortly after he came out of the bathroom sprayed with water.😂
I gotta get me one of these. Currently using a bidet which is 100x better than toilet paper, but manual labor after doing the business? Peasant behavior.
I got to visit Tokyo with some friends a few weeks ago and this is pretty much true. Even in a decently cheap hotel, the toilet they had was amazing and I would seriously consider dropping a few grand on one of them.
I appreciate Randy instantly sounding Japanese but was waiting for the price.
I have two of them, and they’re glorious.
Discovering bidets is a biblical experience
I took a shit in a toilet like one of those and had no idea how to flush it cause it was all in Japanese, so embarrassed I closed the lid and asked the waiter where's the flusher? He then pointed at the silver flusher on the side of the toilet...
"You're mad..." 😂
3:10 name song is: "days of blues by sons of maria" 🏞️🌅✨
Once you stop using paper you can never go back.
How many egg rolls could China toilet devour at once I hope it's a lot because I enjoy Chinese😅😅
Randy's the true Peter pan😂😂😂
Your still got 💩💩💩💩 stains in your dairyair😂😂😂😂
Ol’ blue…brings a tear to me eye
I remember arriving at Haneda for the first time and then going to the toilet after my 13h flight. Those toilets are something else, man. Randy's "how much?" Is beyond relatable
Japan was the only place I’ve ever been where I felt comfortable enough to poo in a public toilet
Hot hot hot
This matches exactly my experience buying my first Japanese car.  Getting the stains off the front seats was a bit difficult though.
I don't know what it is about people and bidets, but y'all are weird af. There is no way you enjoy water being squirted in your arse.
They should be giving away Krispy Kremes in the show room.  That will get you going.
My friend went to Japan on his honeymoon and the first thing he did when he came back was buy one . Every time he comes to my place he swears at me because I have not gotten one and he is forced to do his own dirty work .
og sus
det her var epic
Just Japanese comment passing by  We are the creator of Japanese toilet
GROSS, DAD!
He could have gone with a Chinese  toilet , just rip out the old one and use the hole in the floor 😅
do you have a link on your official website where I can buy all the Seasons that have been released on Blu ray so far
him giggling as the bidet cleans him and then let's out a huge fart 🤣
Been to Japan twice and this isn’t very far from the truth.  When Japanese visit the U.S. we must seem like cavemen in comparison with our toilets.  Like just using an outhouse or a hole in the ground.
0:49 (ignore this)
It was my worst experience.
I Would just go with the standard Toilet. . .  BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FEEL VIOLATED BY WATER SHOOTING UP MY BUTT!!!
There is something else like Japanese toilets with showers as well. Apparently many houses/flats in Estonia have borderline space stations as showers, music, touch screen, a bazillion water sources, super weird.
日本語のコメントが無さすぎて悲しいです。 私は動画の内容が驚くべきこととは思いません。実際、私は今日もこのようなトイレを使用しました。日本の都市部はこの様なトイレばかりですが、田舎に行くと酷く古典的なトイレを経験することになります。女性にとっては最悪です。 普通の家庭だと動画の様なトイレを使用しています。泡が出たり、音が鳴ったり、おしりやトイレ自体が洗浄されたりすることは普通です。 アメリカはとても先進的な国だと思っていたのでこの様な内容デモ驚いているのが少しショックです。
🤣 the farting
HAHAHAHAH
"we cant just get rid of old blue sharron" 😂😂
Bells and whistles it’s like a car wash for your tushy
*Poor ol’ blue*
Uh ahhh
This Japanese toilet has NOTHING on the 3 Seashells
2:40 Honestly if someone would've told me that 5 years ago I would've reacted just like Randy did.
The top models even come with a Geisha who eats your ass after you're done.
I’m watching this as I’m on the toilet in my Tokyo hotel room
After a trip to Tokyo, we now have a Japanese toilet.
This is the best South Park. It's almost always good , but this is just stupid fun whereas a lot of the story points since like season 5 have been basically what's in the news. If you watch south park back to back, it's actually a good history recount of popular culture for rhe last 20 years
When COVID hit and there was a huge run on toilet paper, I ordered a bidet from Amazon. Best decision ever.
Randy sure used the F*ck out of that Japanese luxury, prestigious, custom, premium select, deluxe, high-quality toilet!
As an associate of The Home Depot and working in the plumbing and appliances section of the store, I can confirm that we do indeed have places like this in the store, you just need to ask to see them as they are surely not for the poor.
Then you fly over the Sea of Japan to experience the Korean Toilet 💀
This episode sold me on a Japanese toilet, specifically the Toto Washlet C5. Can't wait  to install it, consume kind of a big breakfast and try her out 😁
I fucking hate Randy.
I swore i would never use a bidet toilet until the day i had no choice. OH MY GOD!!!!!😧
He says how much? Then he says, I'll have to sell both my cars but it's worth it!
I wonder if there was a statistically significant uptick in purchases of Japanese style toilets after this episode aired
God's trainspotting.
I'm jell of all you who had experience this toilet.
LMAO.  Classic.
I bought a nice bidet like that and now I can't stand just using TP or no heated seat omg...
randy and Sheryl are my favorite south park couple
getting Heisenberg vibes here
They also have a 2nd nozzle for "feminine" wash but it works great for rinsing off a funky sac as well.
3:41
3:39
Store Clerk: how much are you willing to spend Randy: I am not poor you know I have my own weed business Randy again: okay how much
South Parks shitting sound effects always make me laugh. Especially as its just Trey making them.😅
Trey Parker looking for another reason to show off his japanese degree 😂
正しい使い方は、ウンチをした場合は、まずトイレットペーパーで拭きます。その後、水かお湯で洗い、水気をトイレットペーパーで拭きます。 最初にある程度のウンチを拭き取らないと洗った際に飛び散るし、使用後に水気を拭かないとパンツが濡れる。 いずれにせよ、トイレットペーパーは必要です。
After see this and I’ve got super intrigued, like, something we don’t give so much importance like where we punish the porcelain, something we do every single day, if we position a toilet like this in a strategic place like somewhere we could use everyday, it could be a great investment for your own life quality, adding comfort in a everyday task, all this technological apparatus could make a simple visit to the toilet a stress relieving moment, I really want to make a test drive in one of these before I die one day 😂
3:26 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
for christ sake, take a dump and go
"oh yeah"
Team old blue🫡
This episode is the reason I bought a bidet attachment
But can it handle Randy's giant 3 foot turd?
I love randy's little sighs of contentment. My girlfriend got a bidet in her toilet and I make these sounds every time I use it, just loud enough for her to hear.
Home Depot Met
Can we all appreciate the fact that they nailed the look and feel of the Home Depot.
Were the farts really necessary?
Ok ❤
My friend has a bidet. Walk close to it, lid lifts automatically, has an awesome seat warmer, and it really does clean better than 🧻. Was drunk one night and used it and almost fell asleep on it bc the seat warmer made it so comfortable lol
You're mad 😲 kills me every time 😂
I love that this is a testament to how much America has fallen 30 years behind in literally everything.
Kenny ' s  face
But toilet paper is still needed. As soon as poop comes out, the asshole is pretty dirty. After passing toilet paper through the asshole three times, then it would be cool to feel warm water for an extra cleaning. But yeah, the first time we pass toilet paper on the asshole after pooping, the toilet paper is "brown-colored. " Water alone can't completely clean an asshole that just pooped
there are no lies here. it's not even satire or an exaggeration. South Park be spitting facts now...
best episode of the season
$3783….. plus parts labor and installation another $3000
485 people who disliked this vid   Can't afford a Japanese toilet   uh-huh-hu uh-huh-hu
A Japanese built Toilet for the American consumer.  Otherwise, actually being in Japan, it's a civilized and well cared hole in the ground 😅
What is the name of this sone that plays in this scene 3:12
0:41
Like that old blue has tape all over.
“Don’t Randy!”  “Ahhhuhhhhhh 😋”
That's great, until the technology goes wrong or technology goes bonkers.  I will stay with the system that is tested and tried over decades.
Im sitting on one of these toilets as I’m writing this!  This is all true! Mind blowing stuff!
I still think UAE toilets (Dubai porta potty) are way much better and cheaper...   I mean influencers are evewhere these days and they are eco friendly option!  💀💀💀
The champagne was a nice touch  . But have found a Kobe beef sandwich  .
We love Randy.
name of song from 3:21 please
"Oh-kay, how much?"
his delight when Sharon revealed she had a business she couldnt flush, feels like an accurate portrayal of an unhappy long-married couple
I lived in Japan for 15 years, these kinda toilets are normal, they even have them in department stores.
Uhhhh..... seat warmers are nice.....
Don’t tell anyone but I got away from big TP years ago.
I immediately bought a $1500 bidet after this episode and I never looked back.  The TP industry is in real trouble if this secret gets out.
"what'd you do to it?" is such a dad question
I had wanted a bidet since I was like 13, but felt there was a weird stigma around it, my family got me one like 6 years ago. The best thing about this episode is that it absolutely nails the awkwardness you feel when you try to explain why you wanted a bidet and then, after getting one, why it is such a massive life improvement. I started off thinking that I'd need TP for a final wipe, but it always came back completely clean, so I just started using the dryer instead. I haven't bought and will never buy TP again.
nah for real i went to japan and came back home with one because the thought of living without it was not real
Mar 2 is declared as national toilet days
Sitting on a toilet in Tokyo right now with warm water jet tickling my butt, can confirm Randy was right
As you can see, not much needs translated, although his first happy sigh was when he felt the seat begin warming after he sat down.  Some of them are a little less refined than others.  It is worth the yen to go top shelf for a more refined experience.  The 26% USD advantage on the Yen helps with sales of goods made on the island, and if you are wondering, makes travel fairly reasonable.  Think Wagyu hibachi meals, ~$10.50 every night in local bars with a hostess and a few guests.  Quality there is beyond anything I've had in the US, probably because the workers care and work hard to correctly execute their tasks.
That K is for karhartt 😂
This is also the best ad for a Japanese toilet I've ever seen 🤣.
I would never trust it to get all the shit off. I dont use toilet papper alone. I first wipe bulk, then flip and wipe streak. Then i start with new paper and wet it under sink, then wipe again, fold wetting once more and if nothing comes back on my last wipe im good to go, else i start with new paper again and finish with a gentle scrot wash with last half.
I stayed in Berlin for a couple of days and my room was equipped with a Japanese toilet just like this. Upon trying it out for the first time I basically had the exact same reaction as Randy, perhaps even with more enthusiasm. An experience I can only hope and dream to have again.
I bought a Japanese toilet because of this episode, 10/10
Poor ol’ blue
LOL!
I have been to Japan several times. Can confirm it's great
Please Just PLEASE release the toilet music to the public, i need it as a new wake up tune
His drawn out fart lolol
Having used one - yes, this is 100% accurate
It is madness that we don't use bidets. Bidets get you way cleaner, without the need to spend money on toilet paper and cut down millions of trees.
"I did have kind of a big breakfast" lol...
Ehhh 3:36
I feel like this perfecty captured the sounds I made the first time I ever used a bidet
I like when Shelly said "Gross, dad!"
$269 for a toilet seat? Wow what an accurate portrayal of a Home Depot
It’s funny because ‘American Standard’ is regarded as the best toilet brand in Asian countries
They should have done this long time ago. And why whenever I see anything about toilet and anal I think about Asa Akira?
Out of 4.2k comments as I write this, is there even 10 comments posted by gals? 5? Crazy.....
I got one and I love it. I passed on the ATR (automatic tampon remover) option for safety concerns
I'm an electrician and I remember the first time doing a custom house many years ago as a green helper and there was an outlet behind the toilet and I was like wtf. It was for the heated seat and heated water for the ass washer 😂.
I'd never forget the amazing warm feeling that I experienced in a tiny bathroom in Tokyo after a 24 hours journey. Those kind of things touch a man's soul.
What is so important about toilets
This had to be 1 of the funniest things I've sean on south park  says a lot because South Parks done a lot of funny shit over the years
The Japanese shitters I remember were just holes in the floor. 😅
😂😂😂from tokyo
I hate the water squirting in my butt
Bidet is the way. 😂
I don't see this as an accurate Home Depot shopping experience! He found customer service 😂😂
We bought a bidet sprng of 2020. I never going back to just wiping my ass.
Fantastic
I wonder how it must of been like when BABYMETAL toured the west and had to use toilet paper?
most unrealistic part isn't the toilets, it's Home Depot actually giving a shit
Period shits is the one that would traumatize you if you’ve never seen it before - trust us if we say you don’t want to look in there
Years ago I used to work in Home Depot in Canada, so many crazy memories!! 😊
Seriously, there is a professor at "Western Illinois University" that actually once took his kids over to Japan after 20 years of his Thai Soi Cowboy loving's!! 😁😁
The Japanese are lightyears ahead of the USA when it comes to toilet technology.
Ok, but how much???
I once stayed in a luxury hotel in China and the toilet in my room had so much features I was afraid to use it.
Been watching South Park since UPN🧐🤣💯 #Member
If Randy didn't constantly brag, he could've kept that toilet.
now show what most "toilets" in japan actually are : a literal hole in the floor.
Get a bidet. It will change your life.
I ain’t got that kinda money I went with the knock off Cambodian model that comes with a wiper girl
Al Bundy would've been madly in love with the Japanese toilet. Absolutely blows away The Ferguson
Whoo yeah the toto $20,000
The song kinda slapped. Oh yeah.... I.....
I'm Japanese, but whatever functions I have, it's almost correct except that toilet paper is needed😂
Watched the full episode, the music is soothing.   Lol
Once you use one there’s no going back.
So how much was it?
As someone coming from the SEA region, there are more features of the toilet such as hot/cold water, controllable water pressure, flush, clean, drizzle, etc. All within arms reach.
My dad has one, he said when the seat warmer warms up your thigh and buttocks the poop comes out really fast and you don’t have to wait for long like in ordinary cold toilet.
Call a handyman!
I dont trust the Japanese toilets because there is no Mexican food in japan.
Randy forgot he is also Lorde.
We are just a few years out from the 3 seashells...
name song relaxing toilet ? 03:31
Jordan shlansky approves this message
It washes you EIGHT times better, scientists are working to reach eight point five.
We have one at work and it is very funny to see the faces of the clients after they try them . They all love them and they don’t want a use toilet paper again
Those Japanese toilets really are something else.
I missed this episode, just saw this clip. The song its clearly Trey singing "Oh yeah" lol when he starts pooping I laughed truly outloud for a solid three minutes. I can't stop hahaha. "Well, i did have a big breakfast." hahahaha
GROSS DAD! 😂😂
“Get a new toilet or I’m not helping you sell weed”
I want one
I lived in Japan for many years and one of my apartments had these toilets. It’s life changing.
Toto is so wonderful. I love them.
Randy for president 🎉
HEY GUYS, YOUR MOM TOOK A 💩 AND DOESNT WANT ME TO SEE IT  Lol I dated a girl like that. She took a 💩,  clogged the toilet, and asked me to fix it but I can't look in the bowl. It's like HOW TF AM I SUPPOSED TO UNCLOG IT THEN lol
First time I was in Korea, I had to take a dump so badly in a Museum.  I stayed in the bathroom for a good 45 minutes. Nice warm seat and all the bells and whistles.
LOL!  "Oh yea.." That ambience music is amazing, I wish I had it on loop whenever I made my porcelain throne my b^^ch
I can confirm it’s like a spa 😂 when I went to Tokio, I use the bathroom to pipí, it was so relaxing I end doing number 2😂😂😂😂😂
The same thing happened to me in an air b&b 😂
I still remember the first time I came across one of these fellas while I was in Tokyo, one of the marines I was staying with went in and used it and all you could hear were girly screams coming from the bathroom, the other marine and I couldn’t stop laughing our asses off.
This Reminds me when I drove a Datsun in 1976 and wondered how the Japanese could they make something that smooth for only $2K and still make a Profit ?
I visited my brother last week who has a bidet. It was such an incredible experience that I was kinda sadden on my way home knowing that I have to go back to my standard toilet. 😥
I had a long layover in Tokyo Japan and let me tell you the Japanese toilets are on another level. This segment is absolutely correct. Once you get the laser precision warm fluids hitting your region you will never want too use another toilet again. This i can attest too.
I need that loop
As a person that can confirm this I 100% confirm the confirmation.
When I leave Japan, it’s one of the things I will absolutely take with me 😂
As I get older I feel more like Randy everyday!
Japan: apartment 100 SQ ft with a fold up bed but state of the art toilet .
Bidets are a top tier invention. All my friends have intentionally tried mine 😂
Everyone loves a big shit . It even post's on the internet 😂😂😂
And with the discrete built in WLAN camera it takes a video from your most secret body disposal opening while you take a dump and posts it automatically on YT.  That's going to be the new trend.  Go for it.
Aguante el bidet carajo
I wonder how many people asked about the Japanese toilet at The Home Depot.
To all the introverts out there; they also have a model with a fake flush effect, so when you want have some time for yourself, you can say you went to the bathroom
3:38
As a person who has never been to Japan, I can confirm with absolute maga-esque certainty, that this feels completely true.
3:39 too much Taco Bell be like 🌮 🌯
Sitting on one now…. VALID!
Just ordered one thanks Randy nice review.
You don’t even need a Japanese toilet to get the best part of the experience, just one of those bidet kits that the episode mentions. It feels good, and you get way more clean. I’m NEVER going back to toilet paper!
It would of been funny if the toilet malfunctioned and it sent a jet of water through Sheilas arse and out the front. It would have sent Jules family in a different direction, leading the writers to make Kyle a white boy Carl type, or Kyle’s dad could be partners with Randy in his business. Would have been a very interesting move.
POOR OLD BLUE
Last april I visited japan for the first time. This is truth!
Whats the song called?
The new versions can microwave a burrito as well.
I used to think Toto was a band - not the leading brand of Japanese toilets too.
GROSH DAD
I just got a bidet and my life will never be the same. Incredible.
Now we know what to get if there's ever another toilet paper shortage.
As a Japanese, let me say that it is true that when you are trying to buy a new toilet, the clerk offers you champagne.
Love from south park studio❤🛷🖼️🛹⛳🏕️🏟️
i cant wait to see what kinda bullsh@t randy is gonna bring in panderverse!
I want a Japanese toilet now
Just like a Lexus showroom and the product like a Lexus....rubbish.
Cleaning your butt also helps prevent hemorrhoids.
私は日本人です。 すみません。 今までこれらのトイレの設備は標準的なものだと思っていました😂
Someone please tell me where i can get that song to play in my bathroom
Japanese skibidi toilets are a race of skibidi toilets native from Japan,the twist that they are more powerful than normal skibidi toilet's because they have state-of-the-art self-defense luxury technology where Japanese skibidi toilet's can speak human language unlike normal skibidi toilets that only say the word "skibidi" all over again,Also Japanese skibidi toilets have armor to protect their sensitive parts like their flush button,Also Japanese skibidi toilets cannot be clogged and that's why Japanese skibidi toilets are the most powerful-but-expensive skibidi toilets in the skibidi toilet universe.
What So Washlets are rare in Americans' houses?
Please release the Japanese toilet song!!!
Wait till he sees what they do with animate robotic female companions (love dolls)
I don't know if i trust the toilet dryer to get my ring of fire completely dry. Does anyone have one and know?
How much????
I love the determined look on his face as he pulls down his pants
Japanese toilets are the best, especially the seat warmer.
I didn't know Japanese toilets were considered as luxury until I came to America. I've grown up with advanced toilets, they were common in malls and shops in Japan, I've been spoiled as a kid💀
The music 😂
1:19
they should address the communist threat
😊 I would like to see Japanese Toilets VS Skibidi Toilets.
3:38 ….and that’s when I had to pause it to LMAO!!!! 😂
Anyone else notice how they had images of pot leaves all over the house! Even as a pot leaf pillowcase! 😂
Why can’t I lift the lid 😂😂😂
I love how whimsical the music is while Randy is initially talking to the employee
whats the bgm at 3:25?
I love all my Japanese toilets 🚽
Hook
Honestly my biggest issue with new South Park is how “clean” the new characters and background characters look. They all look like real people in South Park form, we don’t get weird looking characters anymore so when you look at old characters vs new it’s a big difference
The fucking home Depot is so accurate down to the price tags. Why did they spend so much time on that lmao
1:58 草
Lmao that's LITERALLY my first impression when i visited japan 😂
Gotta love the amount of detail put into the old toilet to make it look broken.
I can’t with the farts💀😭
Drawing from personal experience I can confirm japs shit in holes in the ground
gregory have watched ones , this is a funny cartoon give me marshellows give me bornaza
Imagine all the money you save not needing toilet paper anymore
マジかよやべーな日本人
This is legit a goal of mine, to own one of these toilets
Woah, I need to catch up on south park.
Skibidi Toilet Moment
😂💩
I'm pretty sure Trey and Matt just used a Japanese toilet that week and were like "OK, we need this in the episode".
ちょっとオーバーだけど実際そういうトイレもあるからなんとも言えないwww でもウォシュレット使った場合でもトイレットペーパー使うけどww
one of the few legit comedy shows still being produced...
😂❤
I'm so proud of toilet in Japan. The toilets in public facilities in Japan are almost always clean enough to live in there. Come to Japan, and use a washlet.
blue toilets exist, I saw it, He keeps saying he not poor he should change his pants then. I saw 2x and I tried to get my father watch it understand to keep options open. It be one thing get my mother to stay at our current residence. No bidet means she thinking of better house options. At end of episode he returns old blue he could just down graded to new blue toilet. Old blue you take to dump what wrong with guy. 🤔 Old blue he also buried it which is county violation.
This one was weird for me. Was there something I missed in the meaning??
So no one going to talk about randy selling weed and his wife helping him?😂😂😂
Kohler has left the chat
0:42
for some reason "bluetooth capability" cracked me up. and then came "test drive." who writes this stuff, lol
The Japanese: the people that made taking a dump fun again.
Shelly yells at everyone, including her parents
Love his hairy legs. 😎🖤👍
This is an overlooked song.  Think I was quietly sing “oh yeah” to myself for a few days after seeing this ine
Damn you big paper!
who thought the 'civilized' are using toilet paper and the ones called 'uncivilized' wash their butts with water. ah the power of media.
1:13
This is not a satire, I just bought a Japanese toilet after watching this and I haven't had any regrets.
Toilet humor. 🚽
Now I want one
Song is Sons of Maria - Days Of Blues for those interested.
Is the ep about bidets, or big industries silencing people😭
Japanese toilets are great until you run into a squat toilet
Those sounds though...  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
My best friend had a bidet.  Never going back.
I love how he drops his pants and waddles across the room 😂 it’s the details that count
0:48 XD
I watch the same episode at a hotel room freaking awesome
OK GAUHH!
Americans live in the stone age. Use the damn health faucet .
My experience in Japan wasn't like this. Mostly because I didn't own the fancy toilets the city people get.  But in rest stops or hotels and even some grocery stores, the high tech toilets usually have good indicators of where to put to flush.
You can have a toilet and a bidei next to it and is still like 8 times cheaper.
No toilet paper? That'd save me lots of money! Only guys who are very hairy there knows my struggles...
Literally me right now at a Japanese hotel’s toilet. 😂
Days of Blues - Sons of Maria is the song FYI
I WILL ALWAY DO THIS TO EVERYBODY
The funniest part of this video is the salesman. Anyone who has ever visited that shitty store knows that it's really difficult to find anyone that helpful.
🎶  Sons of Maria- "Days of Blues"
Randys my favourite south park parent❤😂
I’m staying at a friend’s house and he has one of these. I had seen this episode and actually tried not to make any noises. It forces you to react. I made a noise and then i was cracking up on the toilet.
I'm actually sitting on my toilet watching this and I'm reaaalllly thinking about getting a Japanese toilet, now. 😂😂😂
Watching this while taking a dump is fulfilling😄
I housesit for people who have these toilets, and can confirm, I was making the exact same noises 😂
I'd be sold on it too. Washes and dry's you, ah sweet clean relief. In the end you save some how
I love South Park, and Randy is the best lol
Watching these clips I realize just how much the tik tok kids will miss in life
Bluetooth toilets- 2023 and in to the future… we need a cellular communication and all things application device to take a dump. Doesn’t get any better than a selfie on the porcelain throne.
The thing I love most is that this elaborate, beautiful showroom with champagne, velvet rope, and doorman are all inside a Home Depot.
What episode is this
3:38  Sounds Like The Episode  ""Hand Me That Evidence Bag"" 🤔
living in japan must be perfect, especially when taking a shit
is it me or does Randy’s voice sound different ?
Ep number
Stay Gold South Park
I live in Japan. This is spot on. Our toilet plays music when you are having a loud movement.
the only bad thing about bidets are that the water shoots out the air that lingering gin the bowl which smells worse for some reason
In Uruguay, Argentina and other Latin American countries we also use pressurized water, we only use the paper to dry ourselves after that. We call it "bidet"
Slick man is my imaginary friend he is assess with chogoink franky he has a stocker name betsy tequila
That juxtaposition of the tranquility of a fine, japanese toilet experience with the sound of Randy's ass exploding. Perfect.
Who's the savage that put the toilet paper like that.
if I had one of these toilets I could cut out 1/2 the showers I take in a day
Hailiarious
So good. Love the privacy world tour as well!
The beginning scene is literally what my family was like growing up. I miss when things were good LOL
Randy Marsh  Hey Guys, your Mom Took A Shit & Doesn't Want Me To See It 😂🤣
Where can I buy this for my house ?
Please, release the full toilet song, in this version! I know the original song and that's good, but this is better!
The clerk forgot to tell him about the gueisha who came to clean the dong.
Japanese toilet is the best thing human ever invented
0:12 Randy is awfully related to my dad dude used me as an excuses to buy a ps5 instead of me playing it just him playing
Idk why but when I first watched this the “oh yeah” in the toilet music killed me
Once you've tried a bidet, you don't go back to toilet paper.
I didn't hear the dryer.
He should have been shown the Turkish squatters. The horror...
Indians and Asians FTW! #GoH2O
This episode convinced me to get a bidet
My grandma and my dog old' blue....
This episode is no lie. Japan spares no expense for their toilet experience.
ははははははっははは
Its not s satire if its thr truth.
I dont laugh often, but the farts got me 😂
Toto’s are awesome
Cheeee
Pewdiepie basically moved to Japan for the toilets, so it's definitely true
The thing is, if you get used to this kind of toilet, amount of fear and frustration would rise if you don’t get a chance to use toilet like this elsewhere. That means if you went out or traveling country except from Japan you would feel much harder to find any suitable toilet you might use when you have ‘urgent problems’…
This episode was great. I’ve watched it probably 10 times by now 😂
100%
These things only cost like 1500 bucks.
South Park is awesome
HOTHOTHOT!
As a restaurant owner that has 4 Japanese toilets people love squeezing out all that chity food they just ate
"I'm not poor , I have my own weed business" LOL gotta love Randy
had one of those installed at a place i worked and people spent way too much time having their dates tickled... was 2 more cubicles but people would wait for the poo cleaning bot.
That music, when Randy takes his pants off! 😂😂😂
I have 2
I used this toilet once 15 years ago and nvr used since then (except the warming part) koreans take that for granted
How many scenes have there been of Randy on the toilet now?
Imagine home Depot actually commented on here 💀
Once you get introduced to the Japanese toilet you just don't have time to fap fap as you would rather prefer backing out a log in the japanese toilet and enjoying the experience
SHUMASU HOMES
the music cracks me up the guy singing just OYAAA LMAO
𝚄𝚛 𝚖𝚊𝚍 😭 𝚔𝚒𝚕𝚕𝙴𝙳 𝙼𝙴 𝙻𝙾𝙻 🤣🤣
𝙻𝙾𝙻
That "Oh yeah" in the music!! 😂😂😂😂😂
That bidet music is peak
Ai ai ai. Oh yeah, ai ai ai.
The Home Depot employee listening in is kinda creepy.
The Home Depo having this exclusive section is hillarious.
Weird facts: Japanese toilets also provides white noise, so you can’t hear women peeing.
Well...how much?!?!
Ok, but really, how much?
These toilets actually cost like 500-600 dollars. maybe not lexury ones but they're not SUPER expencive.
This episode impressed me so much, for my upcoming master bathroom reno, I specified a Toto Drake with a k300 Japanese seat.  It’s middle tier.  Wife thinks I’m nuts.  The thing uses tap water to generate chlorine to freshen the air before/after and keep the bowl clean.
I want the toilet music ,👍🏻
im japanese and this makes it feel so much weirder … ;-;
LOL
People think this is a joke, but it's actually how they work
😂😂🤣
One of the more pointless episodes in a mostly pointless season. Outside of the World Privacy Tour and ChatGPT, I think this season was all done by AI. And not well done.
Can slightly confirm this having visited the Philippines on multiple occasions. Most if not all their public toilets have bidets which clean your backside way more efficiently than wiping with dry paper. Think about it. You're literally smearing fecal matter in between your ass with a dry wad of paper. 😅
First time i tried this toilet was in 2000 in the Meridian hotel in Dubai. And it was a great experience 😂
I'm now buying a Japanese toilet.
I Thought it was a joke or its the fuuutuuuree  when my girl called , excited said she has a new toilet that squirts water on your bum..... i laughed at her and said ohhh you lazy bxxx , df you think you fanccy now madame ?                            and then i went in deep roasting her on the squirt functions xD.... then covid hit.....  she said what now bixxx ..look at you peasants fighting over toilet paper. i bet yur that type of guy i see on tv fighting for paper huh? then fake tea sluurps  during the call (.__. ............... she won that battle
As a woman who takes big dumps in the morning and sometimes clogs up the toilet, this is the kind of toilet that I need. Since I’m constantly breaking mine and blowing it up all the time….. LOL 😂 just joking. I’m not even a woman 😂 see how easy it is to fool people on the internet… but maybe it made some people laugh anyways 😄
3:10 i love the music and ambience 😂😂😂 like he's just discovered toilet paradise
The toilet music is legendary 🤣🤣🤣
To my fellow males; if you use the toilet to take a piss, please; for the love of God; sit your ass down!!!! I’m tired of going to the bathroom and seeing urine all over the seat.  Japanese toilet or not!
'The Marshes' are: 'white-racist', rich.
We purchased two bidet toilet seats because of this clip.  Love them— so clean and refreshing!
If only he had this toilet in the episode where he took the worlds biggest shit…… lmao
Toilets in the states are barbaric and most of you don't even know it.
I had a prophetic experience with a Japanese toilet back in 2010, when I was visiting my sister at the time she was living in Japan with a former boyfriend. Technology is frigging wild.
Best South Park in years.
I'm sure Randy has seen a Japanese toilet before, with his porn preferences.
Don’t lift the lid!!  Why can’t I lift the lid?  Don’t Randy!!  Ah hah! 😂😂😂😂😂
Ok I had a bit of a big breakfast 🤣
The funny thing to me is, I knew this years ago. I bought a bidet for, I think, about sixty or seventy bucks, and it paid for itself a long, long time ago. I've saved waaaayyyyy more than seventy bucks in the past few years. And I didn't have to get a fancy Japanese toilet. I just a cheap little bidet attachment for my cheap standard toilet.
Да, мразя САЩ
Coming from someone who used to live in Japan, YES!!!  Nothing beats a Japanese toilet!  South Park nailed this one on the head!
I couldn’t find Japanese toilets in home depot lol.
Does anybody know the name of the song being played when Randy takes the dump?
Old Blue.
I could see Walter White buying a Japanese toilet
Randy, oh Randy, a man on a quest, To find the world's toilets, the best of the best. He traveled to Japan, land of the rising sun, To explore their bathrooms, one by one.  He stumbled upon a contraption so grand, A toilet with buttons, he couldn't understand. He pushed and he pulled, and then with a start, The seat warmed up, and he felt a new part.  A stream of warm water shot from the bowl, He gasped in amazement, his mind on a roll. He tried all the buttons, and with each new find, His love for this toilet grew, it blew his mind.  He flushed with a smile, and he said with glee, "Oh, how I wish all toilets were like thee!" Randy had found it, the ultimate throne, A Japanese toilet, the best ever known.  So let us all bow down to Randy, the man, Who discovered this wonder, from Japan. May we all find toilets that fill us with glee, And make us feel as Randy did, so free.
10 thounds dollars on a toilet. You could buy a whole car for that, and make money.
😊☺️😊
The home depot is American version of Hornbach
"Sure. I did have kind of a big breakfast."
Randy bought TOTO NeorestNX. It’s not sci-fi gadget on USS enterprise. It’s real!
Seriously American wipeing their butt with toilet paper in 2023 ? Still roaming around with unclean butt , Heard of Water bidget  ??
Japan ahead of the world
Much better than those singing toilet doors.
WC 2.0
Yes, now with Japanese toilet to wash my ass, I can replace my little sla-
This so funny
Ok we need the audio track the toilet plays 3:13 please 😂
I bought an under-the-seat bidet during the 2020 toilet paper shortages. I'll never go back. It's awesome. When it finally breaks I'll probably try one of the fancier heated water ones with the air dryer function and LEDs. That would be amazing.
Yes japanese toilets exist and is out of this world
AYOOO
Is this new south park because now it just seems like a sitcom without jokes. I thought for sure there would've been a joke about home Depot or something...like not actually calling it home Depot but something funny....
Maybe I really should invest in a Wonderful Robot-Toilet Too?🤔
Where can we buy a toilet like that? Is it for real?
Almost every line in this clip is quotable.   Im making my kids watch this with me over and over.    Cause I did kind of have a big breakfast.
Randy Marsh is my spirit animal.
just hope you can read the buttons! lol I used one once pressed what I thought was flush and the butt cleaner started spraying everywhere and I had no idea how to shut it off. i was a foreign exchange student living with a Japanese family and it was my first 30 minutes of meeting them and I flooded their restroom with them thinking I just took a massive crap
Song is Day of Blues by Sons of Maria 🎶
Your mom took a crap and doesn’t want me to see it😐
You're mad!! Hahahahahaha
Sir Harington advised everyone that the proper way to sit on a toilet was to face the toilet bowl, as to use it as a shelf for books, quills, and ink.
Japanese and Thai toilets (with the toilet hose) are amazing. I always knew there had to be a better way after spending the first twenty-five years of my life using toilet paper. Now I know better.
I'm sold! 😄
Watching this on the toilet
You're laughing. This man just discovered the truth on how good bidets really are and you're laughing.
I’ve never used a Japanese toilet before but I hope to when visiting my cousin in japan
I haven’t seen this episode yet, but did they ever put in the Japanese bathroom with the samurai wall face laughing as you take a crap? Please say yes. If they didn’t they should have added that in the episode.
Sitting on a Japanese toilet as I watch this. Can confirm everything is true.
Ok...but can we talk about Randy's face, full of determination, when he pulls his pants down???  Had me dead
How many Kurix can it handle?
They need to add these types of tucking toilets in public bathrooms in the states
*did u jiggle the handle* 💀💀💀
I Confirm
All the absurdity of man in a short clip.
I love that randy was teasing his wife about her poo shyness 😂
I lived in Japan in my high school days, I remember the Japanese Toilets.. so fancy!  I do wish ours had all those features. They even had a different room with the floor tub toilet, now I wish I had one of those back home.  Having a house with two diff toilets in two diff rooms was awesome.  The grandparents loved that tub toilet.
Splashing shitwater all over the lid and my cheeks. Nty
The gaming experience is very relatable
Gahhhh!
Could I offer you some champagne? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
But what happened to Sharon's chocolate hot dog?
Randy is always taking a crap in episodes
That music. Jesus. Matt and Trey are absolute geniuses.
he actually got help at home depot
First time I used one I had no idea how to stop the water stream and waited for like 5-10 mins for it to stop on its own.
Pro randy
I had a Japanese girlfriend once and yes, their toilets are amazing. Her mum's toilet had a heated seat, mild bidet and power wash function which was like a fire hose being shot up your butt.
😂😂
I'm glad wet wipes have caught on to ease people into understanding that paper alone just gets you by (unless you got that high fiber).  If paper was good enough you wouldn't be panicking over how that sweat going down your crack is picking up what you missed on its way down to your underwear. Actually kind of a good demonstration of how good water is at removing the stuff you left behind.  Of course wet wipes have their own problem of clogging sewer lines, which is why bidets are the end goal of cleaning your butt properly with water and then you can dry yourself with the toilet paper.
Never have I seen a clip so accurate 😂
highly recommend get one of those Japanese Toilets . it sure will make your life better. trust me
Impressed they got the words right in Japanese. 😂
Oh Yeah
Too bad he didn’t push out a Bono and really see what it can do do
I bought a seat similar to this but not quite as expensive. Mine was about $550 2 years ago. It doesn't sense my presence, but it does everything else. I wouldn't live without it. Seriously, luxury can be addictive, but this is a luxury everyone should consider.
These toilets would have saved Clyde's mom's life
I can confirm this is true as an owner of an Otohime.  🤣
beginning of episode: haha japanese toilets  end of episode: I want to join annonyomus
😂😂😂😂😂
2:48  What is that musical sting for? Sounds like it's referencing children's mystery movies
That’s called a baddie
I gotta call Home DePot real quick~
The moral lesson from this episode: Just buy bidet sprayer it's cheaper , you can keep the old blue and you use less toilet paper for just wipe your axx dry.
how much 5,000
Is that crease on purpose or accidental?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Randy is what kids who grew up on South Park became.
Simpsons did it.
I still remember when I first took a dump at an airport in Japan,  I forgot the name of the airport, but I will never ever forget the whole pooping experience. It was incredible
❤Shitty episode 😂
I went to Japan in 2006 and found the toilets superb. It’s true, they clean better than toilet paper. I love the ones with the seat warmers.
I have always been fascinated by Japanese toilets but never used one myself. I recently watched this episode of South Park and found it absolutely hilarious but it really did make me question how and why they haven't caught on in the Western world.  Especially these days where hygiene is so prominent and the majority of people want the best of the best of everything but they are still wiping 💩 off their ass with toilet paper every day and quote "walking around with fecal matter on their anuses" this episode really does point out some disgusting truths and might make some people sit up and take notice of how dated, barbarick and how far behind we actually are.  I believe one day these hi tech toilets will suddenly be the must have bathroom appliance and they boom overnight, maybe this episode could be the catalyst.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’ve had layovers countless times in Japan. And the very first thing that I noticed were their amazing toilets Lmao. They’re so comfortable and it’s so funny how accurate this video is 🤣
幾らですか
If the Empire of Japan had the fancy toilets during WW II they could have won the war.
When people come back from holiday and say they're looking forward to sleeping in their own bed, those people don't have a Japanese toilet seat at home
Randy's reaction is 100% truth. My GF hates South Park but could not stop laughing because we both had the exact same reaction.
The funny thing is that is not at all an exaggeration of Japanese toilets at all. The only thing that is different is there usually still is a toilet paper roll next to these toilets.
Don't you love all these comments about how " you can't say anything anymore these days"?  Yes, you can, and so can we.  We, South Park people, love free speech. Unless it pisses some Muslims off too much, because that shit can get you killed. There are limits.😂
I experienced a Japanese toilet, and it was just Confusing…..
Don't lift the lid, lol
Fun fact: There are still more Squat then Sitting Toilets in Japan these Days! .... for some friggin reason
Japanese toilets are great!
japanese toilets are the best.
it misses one feature.. japanese toilets in public play music or watery sounds so that persons next to you can’t hear you take shit or piss
Simpsons did it.
I have a Toto toilet and it will make you never want to leave your house
What's funny is seeing westerners treating bidet like it's some kinda future technology
wooooooow
epsoide and season ??? please
When it comes to toilets we know randy needs and deserves the best of the best. "Sharon come, you gotta see this!!!"
So "Cars 2" wasn't lying.
They are so good. Could have played blower, heard the batwing flap
Thanks South Park you just inspired me to go out and upgrade my bidet.
The music that plays gets me every time, its so funny
Bidets are the way of the future
In fact , these kind of toilet splashs shit on tit's booter , so when Japan government use them on public toilet , it spreads some kind of disease .
I did have a big breakfast
You have to live a life of man who can afford to install himself a Japanese toilet.
I'd legit buy that if it were real.
The music lmaoooo I thought it would be like a piano or something. Not some super emotional music lol
in case of power outage you still end up manually doing shit.
Can someone extract that relaxing music and put it on a loop?
So THAT's how you use the seashells.
Ole Bloo 😂
This is a good season guys ❤
this is wear all the money whent after ww2... while everyone else was busy building ridiculous armies to do nothing but threaten these guys were spending thier money on wat that mattered
This is certainly an improvement from when I visited Japan in 1970.  Our toilet was a trough in the floor that you squatted over.
I like the story seasons but the classic random episodes were the best. Like season 10 ..*mwaaah*
Jordan Schlanky would approve this.
Randy became the star of South Park.
Hogwarts legacy 😅
"What did you do to it" is so me, I'm embarrassed to admit. I will always assume that my dumb girlfriend did something wrong to it, whatever it is, instead of admitting it needs to be changed
$59.99 for an American Standturd toaster. What a deal!
so did he buy one?  and did they show him or anyone else using it at home?
Randy is the kind of guy who buys a ps5 but refuse to let stan or shelly play it since they will most likely choose ravenclaw and hufflepuff instead of griffendor or slytherin
This was me in Korea!!😹😹the sweat warmer!!! Ughhh why doesn’t the USA do better😭
Only american fancy wiping their ass with toilet paper. Even some 3rd world country already use bidet/sprayer to clean their ass. We only use toilet paper to dry our ass once we spray em clean.
considering how long south park has been around, I can't believe they haven't had an episode about this before
Best ad for a toilet ever ! Shut up and take my money !
Yes, God yes the future. Is now
How much!?!?
Bidets are actually a game changer in the toilet. Got one for 20 bucks, really great purchase.
I bought one. I will never take a shit anywhere else, ever.
I remember the time when randy shat the biggest shit human kind has ever shat, i want to see those fancy japanese toilettes handle that real american piece of art...
I remember always having a bidet growing up as a family. My friends would come over and ask to use the bathroom. I would always hear an "AGHHHH" come from the bathroom and when I ask them what happened, they say that they twisted the knob for the bidet without sitting on it and either get it on themselves or the wall XD
100% true. The bidet is strange at first, like only the first 5 times, later you always use it. Senses you are close, automatic open lid (and close). Warm water, you can control the temp and pressure! Not only that, how it pumps: stream with single pressure, or pulsed stream! They have an automatic flush during, flush after, or you press a button and flush instantly. Then, there is the dryer system (for the real high end ones, I had one), that thing blow dries your butt. Then I came back to canada, and had to get toilet paper again.
japanese toilets are the best! i have one
Ngl, Using a bidet in my home and even have a travel one. So refined and advanced feeling
Went to the Home Depot and the guy said I could order the toilets online he did not do this for me sadly.
I appreciate that the toilet seller turned off the Japanese toilet's "running water/birds chirping" fart masking sound effects so that we could experience the poop squelching sounds and Randy's oohs and ahhs in their full glory.
Expected the old joke. Do Not Press The RED Button.....?????....!
while old japanese toilets were just holes in the floor basically.
Japanese people be like: Barbarians lolu
I want one.
This episode actually had an amazing message. We literally spend millions of trees for toilet paper. Using a toilet that washes you with water can save millions of trees. But toilet paper companies have too much control. Great episode
this is way funnier than what rick and morty did
if you have to ask how much than you probably cant afford it.
I did have kind of a big breakfast..
Although I don’t have a Japanese toilet, I do have a bidet attachment kind of setup, and… it changed my life. And I’m not being hyperbolic. I love shitting. I just love it, it’s mans last refuge. To be able to sit down, watch something on my iPad, and evacuate my bowels, in my own little world, it’s just so amazing.   Until I have to wipe. See, I have OCD and I’m a perfectionist, so I NEED a clean anus. I would wipe for 10-15 minutes sometimes. Just to make sure there is NOTHING back there. I would go through toilet paper so fast. My anus would bleed, almost as if it were crying red tears. My life was miserable.  But then the bidet came into my life.   Now, I just sit down, enjoy some The Office bloopers, handle my business and let the bidet do the cleaning for me. I just turn that dial and enjoy the moment. Yeah, I have to wipe the water off after, but I not use MAYBE 10 slices of toilet paper now. And the results are immaculate. Just 100% clean.   Use my story as your reason to make your bathroom experience better, get a bidet attachment.
The Hogwarts legacy reference took me by surprise 😂✨
I want one!
I'm never giving up my bidets! Installed one in each bathroom. Once you try it, you'll understand.
As close as you will get to an out-of-body experience without being dead.
we could all have these if corporate greed didnt monopolize toilet paper to prevent normalizing these toilets.or so i heard from southpark
the music i expected "sail away sail away sail away" song used for some reason.
This is probably the cleanest joke I have seen in South Park 😂 🤣 💀
I want one !
The “Ouuuuuuuh” followed by the fart noise is hilarious.
Japan came a long way from a squat toilet to this masterpiece.
3:45 😂
South Park is sooo gooddd
That's exactly what I said when I went shopping for a new toilet.... I'm still using 🧻
Ok we still use toilet papers lol
He’s right, though. We really should all switch to Japanese toilets.
Best poop joke 2023!
The portrayal of high-end boutique stores is spot on lol. The guy at the door reminds me of someone at a high-end jeweler, the glass of champagne reminds me of a high-end art gallery or furniture store.
I hope he got the 5 year / 5K flushes warranty
3:19, needs more Enya
“You get a new toilet or I am not helping you sell weed.”, that is how 26% of domestic disputes start.
Poor old blue. 😂😂
I am so easily influenced by stuff..now I want a Japanese Toilette just like the one in the show
Okay I went to Japan last winter. Despite being excited for the sights and food, I secretly was super excited for the bidet’s. Once we landed in Narita I saw the magical toilet, I was intimidated at first not gonna lie and was scared I was gonna mess it up. So I waited until I got to the hotel and unleashed the most unholy steamy pile off fecal matter that I’ve been holding since my 16 hour flight and walking 3 miles to my hotel. Holy crap the seat warmers are like a hug around your ass, and the water splashing at your bootyhole is insane.
😅😅 that song that came on when he tried it!!!
Do they make one with a built-in sexual act feature?
the music lmfao
poor old blue
Seat warmer...at 2:00am....during winter....Mmmmmmm🤤
I'm a commoner with the attachment bidet. 100000 percent acted like Randy to people. I feel so clean now.
wasn't Randy supposed to be back as usual after the streaming wars special?
not poor but pants are filthy
Be smarter to pop for a gas range right now considering how loony the left is getting about cooking.
South park has gone way downhill
I've come here after watching the entire episode. As a person who comes from a western nation and uses water in toilet instead of paper, I completely agree with the content of this episode. I have got nothing against the owners and employees of toilet paper manufacturers, and perhaps they can diversify into napkins and other paper products.
Just be careful boys. If you got too nice toilets, sometimes it become shitplace for whole neighborhood.
日本のトイレはほんまに最高よ
I don't believe it, impossible for a toilet to get you fully clean.
OK HOW MUCH
The song 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Can confirm. Best healthcare investment dollar for dollar and relaxing af. They even purify the air so you forget what a turd smells like.   I'm not waiting 10 minutes for my ass to get blow dried though.
the subtle, soothing music peppered with the "ohh yeahh" orgasm-like noises cracks me up
The toilet music sold me
I can confirm not only is this true (See the Toto Japanese Toliet show room) but also his experience is correct. Well you all were fighting over Toliet paper I was good to go
As a white in Japan, I can confirm, this is 100% legit
I really thought this was going to be the—squat over a hole and wash with a hose—type of japanese toilet. Y’all are spoiled if you haven’t been in THAT situation.
When vvomen ask: why do men spend 30 minutes in the toilet!?  Just tell them, japanese toilet.
This skit belongs in the 90s. Old jokes.
On my peasant American toilet as I watch this
I haven’t laughed so hard from a South Park episode like this one in a while. The toilet song is so relaxing and catchy. Hilarious when randy sings in Japanese.
So how much was it?
Randy.. I’m not poor!! Then proceeds to ask how much? 😂
"Higher" :D
Bought a bidet just a few days before this episode aired. 20 dollars. Life changing. I now cannot imagine going back, and question why it's not standard/built into toilets.
This isn't even an exaggeration, Japanese toilets are amazing.
Wow! We've come a long way since latrines and outhouses.
Where can I download the “toilet song”
One of the main things to come out of Covid-19 is now people in the US have a better understanding of the magic that is Japanese Toilets.
Would you like to take one for a test drive ,well I had a big breakfast 😅😅😅
I live in Japan and these toilets are the norm, they're amazing, I have one at home. It's never cold when I sit down, my arse is always clean, it has a bunch of other functions too.
Are these real cause I want one
I like how every sign in there just says "Japanese Toilet"
It’s not just Toilet humor, it’s refined Toilet humor from Japan.
ここまで何も誇張も嘘もないサウスパークがあっただろうかｗｗ
Recently installed a bidet toilet seat. It is awesome.
These toilets should only be purchased for your personal toilet  These are not designed to be shared  It gets really gross if more than 1 person used it
It’s funny how the whole world fasinated and mesmerized by this (so called new) invention, and we have been using and telling you about it since ages ! And by we i mean Muslims all around the world! Clean your motherfucking asses with water after a shit! Its the only and the best and the 100% sure way to Garantie a clean ass!  Closing your butt cheeks on a shit doesn’t mean its clean!   Thank you
And for those wondering, the song is "Days of Blues" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uclk-AeFTv4).
Honestly, once I'm finally old enough for a job and save enough, Money 💰 that Japanese Toilet 🚻 is *MINE*
I JUST USE AN EMPTY WATER BOTTLE 😂
Taking a dump is serious business in japan.!
Fr tho, Japanese toilets are the best shit that a man ever invented.
These sound effects need to be added to the next Sims game.
God bless the Japanese. The Jews, and Japanese are my favorite people. Bring so much to the world.
POOR OL' BLUE!!!!!!!!!!
you're mom took a shit and doesn't want us to look at it! POOR ol' Blue.
did you jiggle the handle!?
“Ohhyaaa”
western people discovering how better it is to clean with water than spread the shit with paper
I have the same toilets at home. The problem is that you cannot go back on normal toilets after 😊
South Park, excellent background information checks, as usual
Randy’s using it wrong  He’s supposed to be facing the other way, so that he doesn’t have to turn around and look at his crap to flush it.
Why is South Park so afraid of making fun of this administration? Guess it’s low hanging fruit or fear.
I’ve got more “tools” then Home Depot
I love how South Park portrayed the biggest mistake Hogwarts Legacy made. Not making it multi-player!! WTF🖕🏽
He sounds different.  Did they change the voice actor?
https://youtu.be/GivEOChp0QU
i suspect US doesn't have bidets because "Big TP" doesn't want to lose their monopoly
Sp is the best cartoon ever imo....better that simpsons, and family guy...I'm on season 5 lol
This show is just gross and vulgar now.
I love the coy "why can't I lift the lid...ahh huhh" from Randy😆
Living in Japan for several years and those toilets are just awesome. Just ordered one of the best model there is from TOTO (Japanese toilet maker) and watched this the following day making me laugh so much!
Now I’m going to buy one 😅😅
Idk, aren’t we like 10 years too late to be talking about these toilets?
They should quit south park.... Worst season ever this one.....
How he found someone to help him at Home Depot!
Finally a solution to the "toilet paper shortage" LOL
Yes, but can Butters still sit the other way and put his hands up?
My grandparents in Japan have a toilet like this and it literally opens the lid and starts playing classical music when you walk in 😆 every visit to the bathroom became an experience because of that and if I can ever afford it, I will buy one for myself 🤩
Gives a new meaning to the phrase "Ah So!" 🚽💩
No seriously... How much? Shut up and take my money!
I think Trey bought a new toilet then wrote this episode, Randy is Trey if he didn't make South Park.😂😂😂
👍
toto ftw
Fuckin... Wish this is how home Depot really was... Champagne!!!!! Usually when I go it's just a bunch of teenagers who don't know shit about shit standing around ;)
"I'm not your average everyday fool" "If you think you hate it now ... Just wait till ya drive it..."
Nice
I want one.
South Park didn't fell for the old joke of when the power goes out.
Watching this while sitting on the toilet
Anyone else wishes that they had one during the 2020 drama? Would have saved a lot of headaches.
Found the Japanese toilet song... https://youtu.be/UePsEG_zQAE
🎶Oh yeah🎶
South park is still just as good after 26 seasons, amazing
I'm not poor
I went to a Japanese hotel in Manhattan for work- it was the only hotel available in the area. The concierge kept saying "each room comes with a smart toilet", but I didn't understand. I finally tried one out. After you go, there were 3 different cleaning cycles to choose from, sort of like a modern car wash. Also, you could choose "back" or "front", I assume the latter is for menstruating women (as a male I did not try). A little arm swings out under your butt, and proceeds to do a power wash. Even the gentle cycle was almost too much for me. After that, a tiny hair dryer swings out and dries everything up. No toilet paper needed.
the proctologist the not joke "joke" had me in stitches in this episode LMAO !!
The joys of using a Japanese toilet.  Although there was that one time I had to search for the instructions for a toilet model online via wifi as I couldn’t figure out which of the 40 or so buttons was the flush!
Another ShXtty episode LOL. You guys started with Mr hanky, Mr hanky;s Xmas, Mr Hanky gets banned from South Park. Then Randy has the biggest Shxt. Then how to properly use a toilet with Sir Harrington, and of course the one where everyone shxts out of their mouth. Good stuff
That oh yeah song kills me every time
日本のトイレ ❤️🤣👏
I love how Randy pulls his pants down to his ankles and then waddles over to the toilet like a little kid. It’s such a small joke, but it works perfectly lol.
Was in Japan in 2006. It is like the cockpit of a 747 in your bathroom. Impressive stuff, but over the top for me.
Everyone whos been to japan has this experience on the first day.
I forget I great this show really is.
That music tho 😂
I can confirm that everything you saw is true. Even the reaction. Also, think about it…no more buying toilet paper! Imagine the money saved
Ironically I was watching this taking a big dump
without a doubt, the GREATEST show ever aired on television. hands down.
Poor old blue, lol
I can confirm this is not satire, Japanese toilets are the real deal lol
Facts!
"Okay... how much?"
This is the reason why i spent 2k at home depot…
Why can't Sharon fix/replace the toilet? She seems like an unpleasant waste of space.
After watching this episode, I actually went out and bought one. (a cheaper, toilet seat bidet addon version of course, i'm not made of money) But well worth the investment :D
So glad, woke left wants to sue South Park out of existence.
Put this on your website.
Wonder if home depot pays money to south park. Isnt this advertising.
bidets change your life lol  this is me with my mates talking about how good the bidet is.
Randy's face when sitting down was just like mine when I first sat down on our new Japanese toilet...
Your mad 😂😂😂
Bluetooth lol
Im not poor.
The song is what makes the episode even better
TOTO means that "Eastern(oriental) Pottery". This episode is the real except seller looks like car dealer.
Randy the only character I know who wants a Japanese wife in both worlds
God bless the Japanese, inventors of giant monster fights, giant robot fights and the best goddamn toilets on the planet…….GOD BLESS YOU JAPAN
South Park might be going into a new golden age. Especially now that they seem to be back to randomized shit instead of chain reaction seasons.
Also, let's say you're the1st user... the nozzles spray water on your arse... the water falls right back onto the nozzles.. that's now a DISASTER for the guy who's gonna get sloppy seconds!
no American, I ever met, uses a bidet... EVER! The very idea of using a bidet sounds disgusting!
It’s Baday now
I would like to see his wife reaction to the toilet...
God Stan's mom has been such a bitch for the last 10 years. I swear like 80% of her scenes these days are her just angry about something
Шикааарно!
lolol
So true..once you try japanese toilet..you ll think regular toilet is stone age.
I bought a bidet during the "great ass wipe run"  in 2020 at the behest of my barber, I would give up my phone before I would give up my bidet.
I'm dying. I need to get back into watching again.
what song is that!??! the welcome song
The contrast between entering some flawless japanese art studio and the apron just killed me. Gotta love this show
If you don't use TP, that's disgusting
no exaggeration, but as a japanese somehow it's so funny to see Americans using the japasene toilet 😂
I did kind of have a big breakfast 😂😂😂 best line ever .
This was a lame episode. It's like yall didn't know how to end it.
That's my exact experience last month. Now I want to install one for my toilet.
I am a simple person - the funniest parts were "Kids, your Mom took a shit and doesn't want me to see it"  and the shitting sounds with the Depot Guy standing outside the door😂
We should get rid of our toilets for a Japanese toilets! No more toilet paper
Outta All the animation on S.P that to¡let is the most realistic! 🚽
Amazon $30 bidet attachment for your toilet. Best investment you will ever make in your life. Never dread having to take a shit in your life and wipe your ass with paper for 15 mins and still feel gross and be dirty after.
Your my boy blue
My first time traveling over seas i had a stop in Taiwan and there toilets are like this and i was so confused
God damn it, I just finished replacing all my toilets in my bathrooms! 😡
I have 3 at home. You only need to fit a new seat unit. They fit on American toilets.
Just think about how Asians must feel in Europe or USA. And they are damn right!! We need a toilet revolution!!
Luckily, he didn't press the automatic tampon remover button
it's 100% accurate
So the toilet paper is an allusion to the federal reserve note, correct?
"Ol' Blue" HAHAHAHAHA!
Please take a crack at Colin Kaepernick
jajajajjaajajaja
Eh I’ll keep a normal toilet.
My kids came up with the phrase "TOTO or no go".
10 years ago we went to the Hyatt in Hawaii and my three boys got to use the Toto's. I still remember the screaming.
What is the name of the beautiful sound?
Omg South Park still keep killing it 😂😂😂😂😂
I don't get it. Does it flush first? Does it spray p!ss & sh!t all over you and then dry it? It sounds like it's doing too much.
Home Depot does have a good selection. I’m not sure if it’s true, though I also deal with public so I’d believe it, that people regularly use them. The unconnected to any plumbing display models just right on full view
Poor old blue.      I  feel his pain...     my love and respect to you my old friend big red.
Japanese toilets AKA Toto toilets actually have models that are fully automated with seat warmers and built in bidets! That little touch pad is legit and some have seats that open for you when you wave your hand across them! I’ve installed some of them being a plumber and if you really want to spend over $1,000 for a toilet, these ones really do exist
They have to do an andrew tate episode
I can’t believe some countries don’t have a bidet or they do but it’s extremely expensive. Forget about the japanese toilet and get a bidet!!!!
Just happened to stumble across this while literally on the toilet 😎...
they are testing AI implementation on those toilets rn
As a Japanese person, the first thing I am happy to see when landing at Narita Airport after being abroad is the the bathrooms with proper washlets. It gives you that warm feeling like "Aahh I'm home" ha.
If I get 1k likes on this comment I'll buy a Japanese toilet for myself.
Im a carpenter and was doing a remodel on a house that had these toilets.... they allowed us to use them and to see really ghetto country rednecks freak out over how good they were was hilarious.
LOL I love this episode! I use toilet as these machine cause I'm japanese and live in Japan.  However we still need toilet paper eventhogh after using washing machine. And some people (include me) use paper before washing.  Pleaese give it a try!
so we're suppose to pull down our pants before we walk to the toilet?
Rip ole blue. Choked on Sharon's shit.
This part when Sharon said Randy twice sound hilarious. 0:12
I have to say I replaced all my toilet in my house with TOTO toilets and nothing compares to them, by far the best money can buy.
How much was it?
So how much?
I seriously just bought and installed an add on bidet after watching this...
3:20 🎵oh yeah...🎵
When I first used a Toto it was a magical experience, sigh
Ha!
Lol this makes me think off the three seashells I think in demolition man ??
As a person who has been using a nihonto toilet for the last 17 years I can say this is rly. the best. and pls get a TOTO.
where are these wonders of the modern world?
this episode was great i like it, thanks
I’ve been to japan, and their toilets are sick.
This clip made me want to look into buying Japanese toilets.  The comments section made me want to move to Japan.
It was hilarious to me Randy pulled his pants down and then preceded to walk up to the toilet with his pants around his ankles
Being a Plumber that goes to Home Depot all the time, this is great  I'm 36, started watching South Park when I was like, 12 ?
Having just come back from Japan, I can attest to all of this.
the characters on the ads in the back of the japanese section read "Nihon no Toiru" or Japanese Toile (which is strange considering toiretto is japanese for toilet)
In such a shitty mood after dealing with the public for 11 hours today, between this and Jeff Duhnam with the old man puppet not in such a bad mood anymore
The welcome music’s “ohh yea” gets me every time 😭
Japanese toilets are the pinnacle of invention.  Thank you for an interesting video in this interpretation
I've rediscovered South Park with the Meghan episode that was gold but this one was crap. That's why I stopped watching years ago: lame fart and poop jokes. It's a show for retards.
haven't experienced the japense toilet, the bidet with all the bells and whistles, but I have tried the cheap add on, and the more expensive one with seat warmer, light, warm water, and a fan.    I preferred the cheap one for higher pressure, but I still want to go all the way with a real bidet
I did have kind of a big breakfast
I actually gave my wife a Japanese toilet for her birthday last year.  She was so excited that *she* actually installed it herself that night.    We are moving later this year and she said the toilet is coming with us.
It is not just about Japanese toilets, everything japanese is incredible
At least its not one of those weird squatting Japanese toilets in the floor. I couldn't even get in that position.
Old blue. 🤩🤣
Champagne 🍾 now that's service
I don’t know what’s worse, that people walk around after wiping with dry paper, or that that they don’t even clean it proper in the shower. 🤮
I am tired of tp or aka bathroom tissues. When I get my own place I am getting a Japanese toilet.
I enjoy my Japanese toilet.
Bidets keeps your asshole clean comparer to just wiping it
I had no intention of ever buying a Japanese toilet in my life before this episode. Now it will be the first thing I add to a home I somehow can eventually buy.
I live in Japan, but I haven't been using it since I heard that it can wash away beneficial resident bacteria for the anus and make me more susceptible to hemorrhoids.
Went to a 5 star restaurant at Taipei 101. The food was amazing, but it was the view from the bathroom and japanese toilet that made the experience.
I have been to Tokyo. It is true.
II want one!!!
I walked into the bathroom at Ferguson’s- they had a top of the line one piece with a bidet (Japanese of course).The lid rose up, heated seat, etc. Blew me away. I bought three of them. Pricey, but hey it’s my office.
Oddly enough I'm on the toilet having a shit whilst watching this. 🚽🤣
As someone who just got back from Japan a few months back, this is exactly how I feel about Japanese toilets
I know this is meant as a Joke, but here are some facts that were let out of the episode. Many of the functionalities shown here can actually be added to ANY toilet, with an special toilet seat called a "washlet". You can even add automatic flush with a motor for the toilet handle. Of course, there are toilets that have washlet functionality already integrated in the toilet, and they tend to have way more things than just your standard seat washlet, and yes, there are the ones that come with music (mostly it is just sounds of birds). But the one thing is completely wrong in this episode is, you still NEED to wipe your ass with toilet paper. The washlet will not be able to completely clean your ass, you still have to do the final cleaning with toilet paper, but you will need way less, it's way less messy, and your ass does end up cleaner as result. The washlet seat costs around 250 dollars, but even though I have never seen a 10,000 dollar washlet all-in toilets, the most advanced do have some outrageous prices, than can go over 5000 dollars
as usual
svrea
The toilet remote on the wall just put some random Kanji characters and pretend they are actual options lol.
My parents still have "old blue" toilet in the spare blue bathroom lmao... probably 40yrs old now...  I'm going to show them this video...
We dined at a sushi restaurant in NYC and I went to the bathroom at some point during the meal to pee.  The toilet welcomed me and I decided, although I am a dedicated non-restaurant shitter, this was an opportunity that presents itself to me almost never.  The shit was lulled from my ass and was superbly formed.  It was an instant release solid sinker, with a slight coil.  The wash and dry was exquisite and I felt like a new man.  One day, I promised myself, it will be mine.
I've been to that exact Home Depot.  But instead of the magic crap room, there was a half dressed man screaming about needing a contractors pack of toothpicks.
If there ever was any doubt before, this episode should officially erase it…. Randy Marsh is the reigning champ of TV dads.
I just spit out my coffee 😆 🤣
This is very funny 😅😅😅
Ohhh ohhhh ohhhhhh 😇😇😇
Gotta say I have tried these "fancy" toilets before and everything beside the heated seat is horrible. I can not understand the mindset of anyone who enjoys sitting on a toilet and having water sprayed up your ass it's so nasty lol. Just use paper and shower like a normal human being aint no one wanna be sitting on a toilet having a dump then getting water from the same toilet spraying up their ass it feels so wrong
These toilets encourage people to spend two hours in the bathroom while ignoring everyone. Okay, sold!
so matt and trey tried a Japanese toilet and then wrote a whole episode about it
The song reminds me of Far Cry 5
somehow im sure there's an anime girl toilet thanking you when you 'use' her. It's japan. Has to be.
So...   most ppl  didn't  get  it.   It's  not  about greatness of  jap  toilet,  it's  about TP industry and shitty  asses of 30% of the world.   Having a bide like europeans do is  just fine...
My ex father in law got stuck in a Japanese toilet in New Caledonia. He created a scene by shouting to his wife that he couldn't get out. She got a crowd shouting out  "you have to wash your hands to make the door open!". Omg the shame lol. She couldn't wait to tell me the story with glee when they got home, poor guy.[edited for typo, auto correct sucks.]
best) russia with love
Lamest, weakest, crappest unfunniest south park season since the show began. These twits don't see it but I know it's not the same people writing it.
Sharon really wrecked that
I want to live in Japan because of the toilets
This is on point. Japanese toilets are absolutely AMAZING!!!
Home Depot just turned into a museum
Different voice?
When the Japanese fist goes up ur jacksy, that's a little extreme.    Tho, i liked it.
Toilet song name: “Sons of Maria - Days of Blues”
This didn’t even satire. This is legitimately how these toilets are. I caved in and bought one about 10 years ago. Felt like a genius during the toilet paper shortages.
The toilet welcome song is “Days of Blues” by Sons of Maria
Japanese staffs usually are good staffs
I guess the Japanese toilet got all the "stuff" old blue" couldn't handle?!🤣🤣🤣
So, Randy thinks he's either a Gryffindor or a Slytherin? Well, he's definitely not smart enough for Ravenclaw and hooo boy, he really doesn't fit into Hufflepuff either. Justice, loyalty and patience? Nope. As for Slytherin? Well... he's not really cunning. Though I guess with all the antics he does to expand his weed business he certainly has ambition. And finally... Gryffindor? That's... tricky. Courage and chivalry? There's plenty of examples for and against Randy on that one. But if I had to make a choice.... Randy would probably be Slytherin.
日本人にもトイレットペーパーは必要です。^_^
So weird seeing them with separated legs and still hopping around.
if a culture can push back the Mongol's they can make a toilet fit for a god!
I want one. how much?
Okay, how much?  Salesman: Arm and 🦵!
No need to rush for toilet papers again fellas like when you all did during covid
I used these went I was in Japan.  But I would always wipe as much as needed with toilet paper first, then use the bidet.
3:35   FEEL FREE TO REPEAT THE VIDEO
As someone who's been in love with bidets, I can't imagine getting my cheeks on a Japanese toilet😊😊
I visited Japan in 2019 and using one of these toilets was one of my most memorable experiences. I recently purchased a home and plan to install these in each bathroom.
That toilet song is stuck in my head
The toilet sales room looks exactly like a cabinet hardware and bathroom fixture sales room I just worked in. Just my own opinion anybody who needs to use a toilet like that is a pussy.. And as a society we fallen so low that our highest Joy comes from taking a dump. That's bad. So you have automated toilets but the city you live in looks like a toilet. So where are our priorities?
The didnt show the three sea shells...
This was close to original South Park humor and I missed it so much ❤️
Took a shit on a Toto once. Dorothy was not amused.
No wonder the Japanese birth rates are massively declining, they are all getting their gratifications on the toilet!
Spoilers: "It ends on a cliffhanger".
The only thing Id change about this is the home depot guy is usually a hairy legged chick in overalls that pulls out its phone and has to google whatever shit you ask for and where it is! When I have to go in that place and they ask if they can help me i just laugh. I sure miss a good ol lumberyard.✌
I like how everyone is using this video to say that they’re not poor with out saying they’re not
One of the top 10 goals of my life is to have a twin turbo inline 6 japanese toilet someday. Lowered, tuned, clean AF.. I want a mark IV Supra toilet.
I won't pay for the actual full bidet, but I installed bidets in my house myself, the French made them, the Japanese perfected them, but not for the prices, sorry, can't do it... I have the handle model and back mount. I can't remember the brand I bought, I'll have to check
Japan doesn’t have toilets.
I used the welcome song for my brother's wedding video and it worked out almost too good https://youtu.be/QXdPOflqxes
Oh baby 😂  Can’t wait to try these out when I go to Japan
this episode was funny as fuck
Release the relaxing japanese toilet song please!
I need the full relaxing japanese toilet song asap! I gotta go and I really like the song!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's as if he experienced the toilet version of true level.
so.... how much?
3:32 Randy: He didn’t tell me the Toilet Jerks you off to, woe ohh HaH!
The more  I read about them the more  I think this is the greatest invention since the internet.
Because of this episode I bought a bidet on Amazon while watching!! Thanks south Park!!
I'm Japanese. There are more functions. Automatically open/close lid, and you can even make seat up with a button, automatically flushing (when you leave it), detergent bubbles and ozonized water/air cleaning, customizable lid color. You can buy and have it installed in less 2000 USD. Come on.
Japan/Korea would be a tie for greatest number 2 experience ever....
I will buy a Japanese toilet on the condition it can play custom music so I can use that 10 minuite loop of the music from Randy's Japanese toilet that was just uploaded to youpoop recently
good ol' blue
Did anyone notice they ripped Breaking Bad where Walt buys a tankless boiler?
I absolutely adore southpark! lol
Do they actually have fairy guys in that game?😂 Cos im too afraid to play as i don't want to get cancelled
Well damn. Now I need to find a Japanese toilet in the UK to try this out.
Having lived in japan for hte last, almost 5 years, This was hilarious to watch. I don't think I can ever use a normal western toilet ever again.
Super
First time I used one of these toilets was in South Korea, my mind was blown🤯 away by the technology 😂
After you use a Japanese toilet, you’ll realize you’ve been living like a neanderthal.
Gives the reason for every men to stay in the toilet longer 🤣....
I live in Japan. My toilet plays a waterfall noise to cover any impolite poop sounds, screams or grunts. I just have to shout louder.
I'm going play this 3:35 at my school
3:44 im sh!tting rn
I've got Japanese toilets. I've had a number of female guests who claim they've reached orgasm when cleaning their front bottom with the warm water jet.
My home I purchased a few years back, came with a $3000 Japanese toilet. It is my greatest treasure.
That's fkn hilarious.  I was walking my jobsite with my architect yesterday, and she was telling me about Japanese toilets. Spot on. 😂😂
@3:40  is the BEST ‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼‼
Its all part of big toilet papers ploy to prevent us from saving the trees, and money on toilet paper.
Every single person talking about how correct they are about japanese toilets... While ignoring the JFK references and truth behind a billion dollar industry that is wasteful and effectively keeps other industries alive, butt doctors creams etc.....
This damn song has been stuck in my head for a week!
As a Japanese person I can confirm that our toilets are like this. They speak to you, play music and the toilet looks like a game controller with all the buttons
You’re my boy blue.
I want a talking toilet that complains.
From the title I thought it was going to be a hole in the floor.
translations for signs on the wall?
It really is like that. Heated seats, air drying,  front and back washing, music and no touch flush and that is the just the public toilet. American toilets you get PTSD.
I want to install a Japanese toilet now.
This is true! it's documentary. really.
So how much was it, dammmit?
nice
We have a Japanese toilet & I get so annoyed w myself when I have to take a 💩 anywhere away from that damn thing!
while a japanese toilet can be a wonderful thing ,  for $20 you can get a spray nozzle it attaches to your toilets  water supply..    yes you have to spray manually    india and most of asia have been using them for a long time .    the japanese have learned how to tickle your sphincter.
Lmao what’s up w the marijuana leaf as a picture??? Oh never mind, Sharon answered that one for me. I love how the Home Depot is so spot on even w the price formats.
I like the sound of trickling water ...so soothing
"would you like to take one for a test drive"  \that line had me laughing so loud with tears in me eyes!.
As an American residing in Japan for 7 years, I can say this is 200% accurate.
And then you have the disgusting hole in the ground with no toilet paper as you find in Malaysia.
I have to know the music.
That was dumb, but funny as hell.
South park studios let people write  comments becazse there is no unpropriate comments
Toilets in USA are the worst!
Americans live their lives with dried crap and tissue-encrusted ass hair.
😆
I used one at a hotel in Chongqing China a few years ago and I'm not ashamed to say... it was a very pleasant experience. It cleaned me better than any shitty toilet paper could, pun intended.
The depiction of Home Depot inside and out, is spot on.
Dude, I already spend an hour on my piece of shit toilet just on my phone. If I got one of these, I’d just live on it.
Why can’t she fix it herself or at least go buy one herself if it’s so important
Watashi wa hei adesu Toire ni irukara Kimochi i
Sports bottles also do the job
I actually wish this was a thing. I want to try a fancy toilet before I buy.
the best series in the world 100%
Six million? C'mon! That seems a little steep..
It's always awesome to have a fish in the tank 😂...... it's hell trying to get the blue shit off your hands though 😲
South Park really fell off after season 18-19..
This is accurate, I went to the Toto showroom in Japan and can confirm they offer “try before you buy” in their bathrooms
I wish home Depot sold Japanese toilets, bought a bidet recently and it's the best thing I've ever done to the bathroom
Lol "Why can't I lift the lid...a hah!"
It’s sooo True about the toilet paper companies! No can’t make meeeee…  I’m sorry for the confusion toilet paper 🧻 is number one ☝️
I don't know bout you all but south park seems to be phoning it in at this point. Are the trying to kill the series 🤔🤔 ????
At the end of the Episode when he stops Stan to talk against toilet paper companies, I thought that he realized that he can make toilet paper from hemp :)
Wait. Question, even though I use a bidet, I still wipe. Am I not suppose to?!
I agree with a fellow commenter. I hope SouthPark never ends.
Why can’t I lift the lid? 😂
I was hoping it was the old style squat toilets.
It’s been probably 12 years since the last season I watched about South Park. I think it was 2011. So I haven’t watched all the seasons after that… and now i see why… South Park lost its touch. It’s no longer funny, at least not to me
spot on....😂😂😂
Just saw this ep today. Finally the old style of South Park that is actually smart and funny.
Lol I feel this so much since I just bought a new toilet last month haha
HAHAHSHHSHHAHSSHAAHAH
I thought the Japanese squatted to a hole in the floor
So much for randy not selling weed anymore 😂
South park has been garbage since season 14, the best recent episode was making fun of the retarded royals.  I watch this episode and didnt even finish it.  South park is trash these days.
Im literally watching this on polish toilet
Bideets are for those who fear under/over wiping, you can't trust your own body how can anyone trust you?
Been to Japan twice, can confirm. I'm a Japanese toilet supremacist now.
Thank you for being of great character. Your conviction is in the rightside of history.  I will be your Ally on this issue.  Thank you for making America great again, fighting Nazis. 🇺🇸
My GOD... This is the best comedy show ever. And it really proofs that expensive animation is meaningless if the script aint good.
This is dumb; Kohler has been making these for years and years, right here in the good ol USA
I have a TOTO G2 ULTRAMAX with a 300S Washlet, and I approve of this message.
3:38 big breakfast indeed
I lived in Japan for just over a year, and it's true. After you come back home to the west, our toilets look like garbage in comparison
" the true story "
That's my reaction to ANY toilet. Sitting on a toilet is a man's happy place, no matter when, where or why.
This is a 100% true, I live in Norway and go to Japan every year, and it feels like i live in a shithole country when it comes to our toilets compared to the japanese ones lol
The best $7,000 you will ever spend.
Went into a JAL premium lounge once, but left the toilet and had to go to the public terminal potties, because I couldn’t read the japanese instructions for the dozens of function buttons, and was shit-scared of pressing the wrong one and spraying crap everywhere.
Can't blame him. I tried those in Tokyo exactly 20 years ago, so I can't imagine what they are making now...
I have lived in Japan for 15 years and wanna know when the comedy starts? lol. All this is true.
It's south park humor, but despite having so many functions the Japanese toilets aren't THAT expensive.  Pretty much every middle class household in Japan has these
Man his wife is such a bitch now
Maybe this will at least convince americans to use bidets! 🇨🇵
I don't think I've seen a bluetooth-enabled toilet here in Japan, but all the other features are spot-on.  Not every toilet has all of them (or even any of them), and some toilets here are in fact just ancient squat units that look like urinals lying on the ground, but the nice ones are unrivaled.
I have one here in Korea. Came with the house. It's even more hilarious how I have Americans come over and play with the options on my toilet lol
Sons Of Maria - Days Of Blues is the song name if anyone is interested its all over the place
SP kept being better and better in the last 2 seasons. This one started great
I used one in a hotel in Switzerland. Didn't like it at all. Felt at the mercy of it and not hygienic. Separate bidet is better.
It is not as funny as it used to be
Man I miss watching South park. Haven't had cable in years
Man, now I want one.
this is actually a high tech version of a western toilet Japan has thoroughly modified.  Traditional Japanese toilets are uh..........quite different.  I know I"ve used one when I Lived there.
Interesting.
2:47 You're Mad.
Did Sharon use it and did she like it?
I was waiting for Randy to yell "HOT HOT HOT HOT HOOOOTTTTTT!" While being corkscrewed to the ceiling. All that PF Chang's!
I’m in Tokyo literally right now. I can confirm that everything shown is true. There is no South Park exaggeration here. The auto opening of the lid when you walk in, the warmed seat, the spraying and cleaning, drying and evening music. It has no reason to be so amazing. TOTO toilets win. nothing rivals the grief of going back to a normal toilet.
I know I'm late, but honestly thank you trey and Parker for keeping  continuing this show! I grew up on south park and while your topics or concerns may change keep being you and trust yourselfs on comedy your doing it right:)
No one helps you at a Home Depot
It's so much cleaner to wash then have paper around your butt all day.
WAIT... South Park is back? Please?
Randy sounds different
It’s hilarious people think that spraying plain water on your butt followed by warm air will do anything other then splash the poop everywhere and dry it in place lol
So. How much?
'Member when we were supposed to get 30 new episodes through Time Warner and then Matt and Trey just decided to backout and not do it?  I 'member.
I must say that Japanese toilet is the greatest invention of mankind since the personal computer
I still cannot believe that Westerners have only now heard of bidets.
Seeing how he’s on a farm he might have a well water system so he probably has less pressure would a Japanese toilet even work?
if you split this epside into parts this is 1/4, may as well just upload the whole thing.....
japhaniise toiretuuh!!
I worked at Home Depot for 3 years and i can confirm we have a Japanese toilet aliese
Captain Planet style episode that has been done before. What may work for CP and Widget The World Watcher, does NOT work for ESCAPISM shows like South Park and Galaxy Rangers! I understand full well the meaning, but that doesn't make for a good episode, which this one wasn't with it's f--k you ending ala The Magnificent Kiwi from the latter show! Make this episode a two-parter with part one ending with Randy getting shot, then in part two, where Stan is giving his speech, the rest of his team (Kyle, Eric and Kenny) are hiding nearby where one of them spots the assassin and stops him/her from killing Stan. From there, the boys torture the assassin until it reveals possible corporations behind the attacks. From there, the boys have to figure out which one is behind it and shut them down for good. Much better than the garbage we got the other day.
It's the music for me.
Damn. Southpark came out when I was in 3rd grade... I'm old
Watching this while taking a dump.
The toilet music is so relaxing
I’ve flying to UK with a layover in Japan.  The airport toilets better be like this too 🤣
LMAO 🤣 It's like my husband leaving skid marks 🤣 I tell him not to use the guest bathroom 😩
I love that the man standing at the door has a suit and gold earring and they serve Champaign like his buying a Rolls Royce
But I think that we can't totally rely on the dryer and the water clean.still need the toilet paper sometime😂
pattern
"The toilets of today aren't worthy of the name. They come in designer colors, and they're too low, When you flush 'em, they make this little weak, almost apologetic sound. Not the Ferguson. It only comes in white. And when you flush it... "BA-WOOSH". That's a man's flush! A Ferguson says, "I'm a toilet. Sit down and give me your best shot".                                                  Al Bundy
Randy's voice sounds different...
All i can say is YUP
Sharon is such a bum hole
They probably have a google home assistant built in so you can have a conversation with the toilet.
can't go back to tp after living in a house with a bidet attachment
The music that starts to play when he walks in!! Lol "Oh yeah. . . I, I, I"
I have this bidet toilet 😂. Just like the episode it has heated seat which is incredible in the winter time. Haven’t needed toilet paper in the 2 years I’ve had it. They are expensive but we’ll worth it.
As someone who has bought a Japanese toilet this clip is as accurate as can be.
100% Accurate!
Safe to say I wasn’t the only one sitting on it for quite a bit of time
He enjoyed that toilet almost as much as getting an old fashioned.
Does it use the 3 seashells?
Once you get used to a bidet, going without makes you feel like a nasty savage.
"poor old blue" :D
I was always so curious about these toilets.    I thought I had to go to Japan to experience it.   Stumbled on one when I went to a fancy restaurant in Hawaii.   Never had I been so excited & nervous.    It was a crazy experience!!    Never told anyone about it til this video 🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait to check out Cosa Bonita!!!! Should be opening here soon!!!!
20 yrs ago I attended a birthday party of a famous friend of mine, in the basement of his giant home he had imported a Buddhist temple interior that was hundreds of years old and reassembled it.  In that basement was one of these toilets, back then it was around $20,000+. To give some idea of how fascinated people were of this toilet, of the 150 guests all lined up for hours to use this toilet while ignoring the bald eagle he had with one eye for petting. We drank, got stoned, ate all night and in the morning had caviar and soft boiled eggs for breakfast and then a group of about 8 guys decided they wanted to fly their Ferrari's to Italy to have a track day...We were in Wisconsin!! Lol....I slept in the Buddhist temple too!  I should also mention he had part of the Vatican upstairs in the entry way, he was at the Vatican and loved a section of carved marble wall. He then made them an offer and they actually accepted! Cost a fortune to get it to the US and when the shipping container was opened the entire thing was cracked in half😂. Honestly I could go on and on about the random things in that home.
I have a Japanese toilet from Toto. The clip even had company name spoofed as Tootoot 😀. Toto is famous for its washlet- electronic remote controlled toilet seat with multi-function bidet, dryer, deodrant, self cleaning features, heater and what not. Amazingly engineered product...
#Disappointed 👎
Also, Japanese Toilets wont divorce you either
After watching this episode and reading the comments... I'm actually dying to buy one now. Maybe Randy is the second coming of JFK
Puh boy my first experience with those was not pleasant. Spend my first time in Japan in an hostel and they also had such toilets. All the functions were explained on a printout which you could read while takin a shit. But  someone put the pressure for the asscleaner thingy way up. It felt like my asshole was blasted with one of those Kärcher pressure cleaners. Still those toilets are pretty fucking amazing.
My boy blue rip
The fkin music “ooooo yeahh” 😂
3:18 Who pulls down their pants and then walks across the room?
What is the song name
Speaking as a firm bidet disciple, once you've used one you'll never go back, and you will hold onto the firm belief that anyone who does not use one is a filthy beast who brings shame to their family.
that is why badays are gay
Anything less is savage.  And the salesperson forgot to mention that the bowl pre-wets itself to keep those 'lesser stools' from harshing your premium experience.
Like getting a mistress to lick your taint.
I just want the heated seat, why this isnt a thing in western society i dont know, especially in colder climates
The design is very human
https://youtube.com/shorts/aDQ6C2XpVOA?feature=share
We need the full toilet song!
Literally me 😂😂😂
Ludwig got to them
HAI........hai-hai-hai........  Fucking killed me. I'm dead now.
Bum bah dah Oooooooh Yea
Where is the squat model?  Squat pooping is the best.
"Hey guys your mom took a shit" LMFAO I love Randy sm
I need to know the song when he enjoys the toilet!!
I seriously need to get myself a Japanese toilet 🚽 so I can experience what Randy experienced. I would also like to stop using toilet paper 🧻
I want a Japanese toilet lol
Jew depot all I have to say is don't ever work there
3:12 Days of Blues - Sons of Maria thank me later - sayonara
Well, I am now fully invested in buying  a bidet seat for my stool...  Already see a good model warm water bidet (no heated seat) w/ side panel controls for under $300.   Cheaper than my PS5 lol... "I'm not POOR." Edit: just bought a Kohler Novita for $253 after taxes.  It has a heated seat, warm water bidet, and dryer lol!
crying - this was my exact experience
as a Japanese, I can say for sure that we still use toilet paper even after being washed by bidet. maybe less toilet paper though.
Hey kids mom took a shit and can't flush it.
トイレットペーパー使わないって嘘でしょ…？ トイレットペーパー、ウォシュレット、トイレットペーパー の順番だよな？
i even have my japanese toilet doing taxes for me
People just use leaves out in the boondocks
Toilet: I am honored to accept your waste. Homer: Ohhhhhhh, They're YEARS AHEAD OF US.  Note: Make sure you dont switch the TV to the toilet channel.
How much couricks does his crap have???
Can confirm that the new version actually comes to you.
Nice
A problem I’ve had with bidets is how do you dry your ass off after?
I’ve not watched it since the vhs days ! Gonna get back into it fkn hilarious
I’ve been seeing ads for smart toilets after this episode
They have these in Thailand too, you cannot beat the feeling of a warm jet of water hitting you in your starfish 💦 😃
Well, it's about time!
"Mom, lise! Check it out, dad's on TV!"
What kind of maintenance do these need?  A regular toilet can go nearly a decade without doing anything.  At some point you change the flapper, maybe replace the float/valve.  I mean you can probably save hundreds if not thousands in tp over the lifetime with one of these?
PSA from a Japanese: Don't use the bidet as an enema! The water may contaminate the inside of your bowels with outside bacteria.
Very nice
Just remember, once you experienced a japanese toilet you will never be able to go back to ordinary toilets. NEVER!
Wiping the sh*t off your ass with paper really is disgusting. When did we lose our humanity so?!? 😢
Made in Flushing, New York.
White people when they find out about washing their own ass: 2:46
Continuity alert @2:50: the Home Depot guy's watch shows the time as 12:14 while the toilet control panel shows it as 12:32. (Funny as hell scene though).
Toto Washlet for LIFE!
What is the song when he's using it?
I’m sorry it’s been a minute but did Randy’s voice always sound like this? 🤨
This is peak Randy for 4 straight minutes! LMAO!
This suggestion popped up right next to Ludwig, lmao.
Bought one not too long ago.. how good is it ? Next week I have an doctor’s appointment to check my haemorrhoids.
Rest in peace Ol' Blue
Dear god do I love that music
l wanted him to hot hot ho hot when he got sprayed fu trey and matt
It would be funnier if he started jacking it.
I dunno.  I for one like a room temperature toilet seat, but every other feature seemed great.
In Japan, they have this EVERYWHERE even in convenience stores. It’s magical. They provide seat cleaners, the seat warms up for you and everything else shown here. It plays noise to cover the sound of you shitting. Oh ya and toilet paper is still provided.
They predict Howarts Legacy :o
Wasn’t Randy back to being a geologist tho?
looked like a richer ikea section
How come wet fart noises are still hilarious after all these years?
Toto is genuinely the best toilet with bidet! Amazing!
The heat warms are insane 100% worth to pay premium to have S+ tier popping experience
These editors must have been sitting on the toilet after waiting for it to do something 🤣
This is how Producer Michael found out about Japanese toilets. He's not poor btw. LOL
Oh,  I was sure that he will test the ATR button    *Automatic Tampon Remover
I'm mixed race Japanese and South Park tends to nail satirizing Japanese culture. If I recall, one of the creators has a Japanese wife and speaks good Japanese, so that explains it. "Let's Fighting Love" along with most of the random Japanese dialog throughout the show is comedic perfection.
This episode makes me want 1 now
Japan toilets: Every building: magical perfection Every park: hole in ground you have to squat over  It's like the ying-yang symbol, perfect balance.
The funny thing is, they're not joking about what Japanese toilets can do
I don't like how hostile they have made Sharon in the later seasons.
I've never heard anyone who's used a bidet speak negatively about them.  Started off with a cheap non-electric one at the beginning of covid and ended up graduating it to a top of the line electric Bio Bidet Bliss BB2000, with heated water, heated seat, etc.  Honestly, the worst part about traveling now is not having a bidet (I'm aware of portable ones, but they stink)
I Love You Randy.
I love south park. It really is the dumbest/smartest show ever!! Its great!! Why arent these toilets being pushed on us?? Especially with all the germs were supposed to be afraid of.. oh yea bcuz of the big toilet paper haha
This was all a joke until the pandemic occured.  Best investment ever.  Once you go bidet, you'll never go back.
I’m going to Japan for the 1st time next month. Looking forward to this kind of 1st impression 😅
This episode sucked
I have to give the South Park writers credit the Japanese on the signs is actually correct Japanese and actually does say just "Japanese toilet". At the very end that round sign actually says "Japan super toilets". For the record if you've never seen toilets in Japan they don't actually completely wash you clean you still have to use toilet paper. But they do have aimable bidet on higher end ones that you can actually angle with a touchpad and some do have a dryer built in.
Pretty accurate
I just started working at The Home Depot, its funny how accurate the store and all the little details are.
As someone who actually owns a Kohler Numi (black edition). I can vouch for Randy, using a Bidet feature is the most weirdest thing ever. But I got used to it. The thing cost me $9,750.00 from the Home Depot. But it was worth every dollar!
“Did you jiggle the handle?” I don’t know why, but the way Randy says it, makes me laugh my fucking ass off! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We bought one online from Costco; love it! 💕
I  I work at the home Depot warehouse and I swear to God I've seen a box with the toilet in it the claims you can flush a pool ball on the box 😂!
I love Randy. Best friend material 🤣
does anyone know what the music is they use when sitting on the toilet
I hope everyone gets to experience a Japanese toilet. I have two of them. And I cant go back to a normal toilet anymore.
New episodes are 100% not funny, I don’t think I laughed  hard at South Park for a couple years now😢
We think of people from 100 years ago as quite uncivilized due to lack of daily bathing or even teeth brushing.  100 years from now people will think of us as primitive and disgusting for still using toilet paper to wipe our you-know-whats.  You guys seriously need to get on the bidet system, and you can buy and install one easily for about $25 off amazon.  You'll thank me and Southpark later.
Japanese toilets: Amazing to sit on, traumatically horrendous if you need to be sick.
When I leave japan for whatever reason, this is the most tragic thing. The moment I sit on a toilet and is cold, man, it feels like I am back to wild ages
Oh it's the one guests use? Then they can be stuck with it
can't wait to see one on the adulterers King Charles and Camilla's Coronation and the church caving in!
Why didn't anyone tell me about Japanese Toilets,...  oh right I'm poor.
Just got back, it is a great land with high class toilets to even the poorest of man.  It warms the buttocks, does a little drain when you sit to make sure you are pooping into clear and clean water, even gives off scented smells if it's been dominos pizza the night before or background noise if tacos.  The spray into the asshole is a different experience but from testing with destructive poo power it does clean better than any toilet paper and even after a beef crusade it didn't clog.   I cannot afford one back home but it is my intention to eventually own.
when I went to japan with my mates, I would run upstairs to use these bad boys. I would leave the door up so they could witness me as they came up the stairs... what a time to be alive.
He had a big breakfast guys
South Park is just..... SERIOUSLY unrivalled in satire, I love it so goddamn much please never ever stop hahahaha!
First time I used one in Japan in 2006. There we're so many buttons I didn't know how to use it. I was at a dinner party and it took me like 20 minutes to get out of the bathroom. Think trying to figure out a complex remote in japanese, the buttons are just emojis of cats.  The toilet was amazing but my knees hit the door because I'm 6 ft 4. (Japan)
Dear fellow US citizens. You can buy a bidet for $50 on Amazon that mount to your toilet and it’s easy to hook up to the water.  Come join the clean side. Side note, you go thru a lot less TP
Can confirm they are the shit.
Simpsons did it
And then there's the Japanese wives................
In 2016 I stayed at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo with my friend.  He was in the bathroom for almost 2 hours and I was getting really worried about him.  When he came out of the bathroom he appeared to have an out of body experience.  He fell asleep on the Bidet toilet.
When Randy's in the test toilet, the sign behind the sales guy says "Japan Super Toilet."
I just don't know how even one of these would help me with a really bad IBS situation, It would just spray everything everywhere :S
Toilet paper is dirty. It doesnt clean you properly. This is not a mystery. I would never be able to go back to just toiletpaper. Bidet or japanese toilet is a must.
This felt like the best episode in a while. The Japanese music from the toilet floored me. And his ramblings in the hospital bed. Genius.
Well, add that we have to walk around in America with dirty buttholes to keep the big toilet paper companies operating to the list of conspiracies.
The heated seat option drives me nuts...I prefer a cold seat and cold water washing my ass.
This episode rings true.  Americans wipe their arse-holes with dry paper and basically walk around with smeared shite on their arses.
This used to be Abt electronics in Glenview IL.  Not anymore, Abt resembles a flea market now.
By comparison I took a shit in a club in New York , a dude broke in, a fight broke out and then bouncers threw him out, the toilet had a crack in the seat which pinched you thigh, the floor was 5mm deep in piss, there were needles on the floor, even my shit crawled back up my ass, I left with PTSD.
Randy is such an unlikable asshole now, I hate whenever he's on screen.
With our Japanese toilet we now clean up hands free. Game changer. Goodbye toilet paper hoarding.
i wonder how this episode affects toilet paper and japanese toilets sales. come to think of it, it is truly weird that everybody's wiping their butt with dry paper instead of washing it clean
Serious question: If you have a power cut, do they still function for basic use/flushing, or is some part of the use/flush cycle 100% dependent on electricity?
Most of the world does not use toilet paper. Water is the most common way of cleaning yourself up after taking a dump. Most Americans probably have unclean, smelly asses. 🤣🤣
How many people are watching this on the toilet  wishing they had one.
I am going to have a cos benefit analysis run on the value of not using TP vs the cost of the toilet. The graphs should cross at 8 years I am guessing.
once you use a bidet toilet paper seems like primitive and gross
I wonder how much Home Depot paid to be on this episode…
When I discovered them I thought I died and gone to heaven
Pro tip: Flush before you air dry. I didn't and I regretted it.
👍🏻
This was a peak Randy episode
At the very least - if you live in a cold climate - then a heated toilet seat is a must have.  Switched all seats over to a heated seat.  Works with any toilet with electrical outlet nearby - an easy affordable upgrade.   Will change your life.
As a owner of 5 Japanese toilets in my household, I can confirm you will never look back again.
Absolutely accurate! FYI the Japanese also make bidet toilet seats that fit on your existing toilet and have most of the bells and whistles but much less expensive.
This is hilarious!  Got the giggles every time I see it.
The music when he’s on the toilet 😅😂
One average transit in Narita airport.
The problem is when the electricity goes out…..
Well, I did have kind of a big breakfast. 🤣
00:41 thats some amazing moving animation of sharon god damn
Toilet paper is for peasants and barbarians.
Best episode in a long long time
Remember during the pandemic we had a toilet paper shortage Because people were hurting something that I guessed most of the rest of the world doesn't even use
I loved this episode so much, and how they incorporated Hogwarts Legacy into the beginning.
Wow. The Japanese toilet even have a soothing music when using the bathroom. XD
So good, thank you for continuing Tegridy farms 👌
Wow this would really making taking a daily shit so much fun.
Cant get rid old blue!
I really want a Japanese toilet but I can hardly afford Japanese take out so... Yay 2023
Seat warmer and water spray is absolutely standard here in Japan. Even many public toilets have these features. Sounds, automatic lid, automatic flush, dryer, smell removal - these are all a bit more luxury features, but they are very real and you do come across a toilet like that every once in a while. In ōtemachi it's even common to find public bathrooms of the luxury kind.
This is literally me after I moved to Japan
THANK YOU
Feels like a home depot ad
I look at the home depot web site and found a couple toilets with a bidet and when you watch the video to show you the features I just about died laughing bc it starts out with classical music then I started to think..... Im looking at a toilet listening to classical music to show me how it works lol. South park never disappoints.
Their toilets are 100% this. But back-assward America hasn't adopted them yet, and probably never will...
I think i would need the garden hose feature
Where's the song ? ::D I need to play it while takjing a shit :D Someone make the song please :D
Its funny how this episode actually is satire but manages to hammer home some very good points
It's funny how all of those features are actually real lol
From what I see here, I have a feeling that this episode is kind of like a family guy episode.  The toilet broke down so that randy makes into a Japanese toilet rather than Japanese toilet being one of the consequences.    I'll watch the full episode soon and hope to be proven wrong. Because the last thing we need is another family guy
so Japan is an industrialized nation and have had these toilets for decades. So why does all the rest of the civilized world still use toilet paper? We all go to the bathroom at least ones every day. It's an essential part of being human. It's a major thing. To all of us!
What happened to his voice
Seeing all those people in the comments make me think that Japan is the superior country on a planet. Yeah it might have some problems, but damn, I'd sell my soul for some of that toilets
Is this sponsored by TOTO?
Makes you wonder how much a Japanese toilet actually costs. Can't see Americans in general use these kind of toilets. Old Habits are hard to kill.
This seemed to be really about universal healthcare. Agree/disagree?
Am i tripping or does randy have a different voice actor?
The funniest thing about this, is that it's completely true! ROFL ... !!
Lived in Japan for a good part of my youth and this depiction of toilets is not a joke. I installed one at my home in Los Angeles too.
Trash Taste Moment
It's funny because nothing could be more truthful. You either know or you don't.
I got the poor mans Japanese toilet...the tushy, shit works amazing, I actually look forward to poop. I also feel like a caveman when using some other caveman toilet...bidets people....THEY ARE INSANE GOOD
Those toilet paper companies (owned by Blackrock, Vanguard so forth) would most likely go as far as they did  in this episode. South Park has been killing it with this new season!
“We can’t just get rid of Old Blue Sharon”   😂
contrast between randy's giant burning crap before
The one off episode returns have been great this season!!! Keep doing them! However what happened to the old gang with kenny kyle eric and stan and the occasional Butters? They hardly even eat lunch together anymore or do anything with each other and now have their own dedicated side paths. Tegridy farms is so weird of a setting but I get it I suppose. At least its not a whole season of storied episodes!
I watch video..
I watch video..
I watch video..
it's all true! Japan is like StarTrek but in real life
We are Americans who have bidet toilet attachments on all our toilets at home. While nothing is better than a proper shower (with hand-held wand and soap of course!) but having a bidet setup on our toilet is awesome. I have some Japanese toilet experience - trust me, these things are glorious. No one should ever have to wipe their ass with a piece of toilet paper, smearing whatever you wipe all over your skin, rendering a dirty feeling that inevitably turns into swamp ass. We live in the year 2023 now and are intelligent humans. We landed on the moon in 1969 but yet our overall toilet experience is absolutely disgusting and discredits our intelligence greatly!
The ending to this episode had me losing it.
I goess Colorado home depots actually have workers around to help the customers
this is so true thats how i felt with my first japanese toilet best shitting experience i have ever felt
Great episode but family guy is doing better
Can we make the Japanese toilet song a ringtone??? Ohhh, yeah....
Hogwarts Legacy
I came back from Japan and started looking for Toto toilets the day I got back.
Do those toilets come with a lazer targeting 🎯 system?  I could use one of them.
The fart had me dying. After all that moaning.
The friend of my mother is slovakian. As she built her house at retirement, she included.... a japanese high-tech toilet. I laugh every time I enter her bathroom and her toilet greets me in slovakian. ^^
The only thing that could of made this any better?  Nick Offerman. (voice)
When the water shoots directly up your asshole its makes you shit a bit more like blowing your nose
Randy ripping Hogwarts Legacy just like me
Japanese son is paying their USA daddy for promoting their products
lol literally just came back from japan and now I have to tell everyone about bidets.. they're amazing! 😁
Love how over the top the Japanese toilet is 🤣
What I care about is flushing power. Do they have a wide enough trap to pass a girthy boy or a long rim roller?
The music every time makes me laugh so much
I remember my first time. It was in Iga at a dormitory, and I couldn't bring myself to do it right away. My breathing got intensified once I learned what each button did, and I finally was able to release the tension once I gave in to the temptation that completely surrounded my bum. Since then, I only prefer the Japanese models as they are compact and ensure you are completely cleansed. I also purchased a toto model once I arrived back in the states, and have enjoyed every moment of taco bell aftermath and coconut curry fallout.
People in Europe:been using hygiene hose for many years. People in America: wow you can wash your butthole amazing.
WATER Washing: old technoogy for all Asians and Arabs and Africans lol
i was in japan 23 years ago. thier toilets couldnt handle my giant american dooks.....
Then they go to a public restroom in Tokyo and find essentially a hole in the ground
The fucking song that plays when you use the toilet
Need that toilet song on Spotify, also can the 10k toilets run Hogwarts?
What ep is this
The Japanese know what's up, shitter time is sacred
Japanese toilets are the best. I got a bidet for my bathroom ten years ago and I haven't looked back. Join the 21st century your booty deserves the best.  Alright I just finished the episode. I'm disappointed that Randy pinked out like that. Don't give in to Big TP.
Am I the only one curious about what the name of the song is called when he uses the toilet it sounds nice and feels relaxing.  Does anybody know?
I watched this episode 10 times now 😂 funest this season so far
Tootoot is an amazing joke. (Toto toilets)
Costco sells brodells for about $300
The voices were off in this episode
eat the rich
Was this to scare me or entice me?
glad i sell bidets for a living!
3:31 I was in tears of laughter at this. Thank you Trey and Matt XD
I didn't warn my husband when we were in Japan and the first time the shot of cleansing water hit the spot on my husband he got such a shock he shot up and banged his head on the ceiling of the very tiny cubicle, he was 6'2" it was hilarious..
Nice. Randy bought a Japanese toilet because he needs to change the crappy toilet.
There's a Japanese manga where a salaryman literally falls in love with his bidet toilet
Just tried my first Toto Japanese Toilet today.  It was everything I dreamed it would be, and more!
Dentist cross curbside toilet ceramic 😁 say cheese 📸!
😆The proctologist.. hahahaha.
Only 9,998 USD
Dude I have had a seat warmed with warm water bidet for like 10 years now, what is wrong with everyone that this is new to them? Toilets that clean your anus for you should just be universal.
i did kinda have a big breakfast 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It is all true.  I came back from  2 weeks in Japan to LAX.  Went to the mens room opened the stall door and was immediately disappointed and sad.
I love how Randy is basically a main character now and I love it. I love his character 😂
i say this all the time.... invest in a bidet. all TP does is spread the shit around your asshole
these toilets were made by lexus
I wonder why women can't poop in South Park. Where's the gender equality?
I was stationed in Tokyo for four years.  My buddy and I literally walked up to a high-end business building and not one employee in suits stopped us from climbing up to the highest level to use their high tech toilets
so how much ?
Randy is role model to men
Looking at this from my Japanese Toilet. I love it!
So, is it deemed unacceptable to prank someone with scalding hot water from the bidet feature?  Or do you just let the o-ring skin fluff off and continue on your way?
Lol yup definitely an invigorating experience
Japanese toilet are not for me, as i squat sit on the toilet
Why does Randy sound different??
I am in a Japanese hotel right now.  Absolutely legend toilets. It’s like having your best friend tickle you where you never knew you needed to be tickled!  😮
This is exactly how my toilet in my hotel was when I went to Japan 😭 that automatic lid lift and seat warmer when you walked in the bathroom was wild.
Beautiful Day Today Ain't This Just Almost Best The Best Day If You've ever seen Seen In The Universe.
Disappointed! I was hoping Mr. Hankey showed up speaking Japanese.
Never tried Japanese but they have the same thing in South Korea and it was incredible. Felt so primitive coming back to the UK lol....
I loves the toilets at the train stations in japan. I desperately want Japan's magic toilets to come to America's public bathrooms.  Sadly I know that America isn't ready for the responsibility of magic toilets.
Uh...ya, no shit.
Yeah, I remember Rick when I bought my Japanese toilet. That's right, I can afford a Japanese toilet. I own a weed business. 🚽
What's really funny to me is that this is actually an accurate representation of Japanese toilets. Literally everything the Home Depot guy is saying is true, even the fact that the toilet can sense you walk into the room, lift the lid, and play music.
Where's the satire?
Those things are fucking nuts, first time i used one was in 2013 and it is all they hype it to be
It's actually true
Who else is taking a shit right now?😊
NICE
nihongonotoire  im such a weeaboo
When I went to Japan a few years ago I said tte same thing lol sold! How much?
Japan got the each side of the extreme when it comes to toilets, these and the old fashion not so fancy squat hole in the ground type.
It may be gay but I don't think it matters
Seriously I can't even think about living without a bidet
I could smell colorado Home Depot just from the screen
I want one, this makes so much sense 😁
I'm not poor
Bidets are awesome! Get A Luxe Bidet and toilet seat off Amazon. I only use toilet paper to dry the water off me.
We need the FULL song, without voices over it
Haha, you guys had me checking out add-on bidets, with temperature control, direction control, and even a heater blower!  Seems you still need toilet paper!  They even had the gold rimmed throne you had in the cartoon!  Great episode!
Lived this expérience in 2009. You Do freakout when the toilet seat close itself
You are about the transform the US toilet sales statistics!
A bidet, I prefer to call it the fag toilet
You still gotta wipe,otherwise it's skid city
I haven’t used toilet paper in 7 years since I moved to South East Asia. To be honest, I can’t understand how in the west we keep using toilet paper to clean our butts. It’s actually really disgusting 🤣
The questions is still unanswered: How much?
there is something with randy and toilets and poo 😂
I literally bought one just like this. This is a documentary 😮
This is to true 😂😂😂😂😂
Europe is pretty much all the type of butt washing toilets. They think we are savages not having them and still scraping poop off with paper. 😁
“I’ve kinda had a big breakfast!”  OMG I almost ☠️☠️☠️😳🙄🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️😂🤣😂🤣😂😭😭😭  The South Park staff (Everyone involved in the creation of this hilarious show) should be billionaires!!!  Literally showing to society their own hypocrisy and indifference through genuine satire/humor!!!  Bravo folks! Bravo!
Watching this as I’m on the toilet.  Nice
Its hilarious but does anyone know the song playing in the background it sounds pretty good
Such a great epsiode! I like that all the episodes are on #HBOMax now
LOL I knew a Japanese doctor who had all those features he mentioned with the light and the classical music.
I DIDNT SHOOT RANDY MARSH!!!
As someone stationed in Japan, this was my first experience too. Every time I go back to the US I feel dirty everywhere I walk
Love it!!
Just buy a hand shower unit jump in your shower squat down and hose out your ass that way
I can confirm that “Japanese” toilets will, in fact, ruin you for all other toilets
I went to Japan and the toilets blew my mind (or asshole).  Shitting on American toilets has never been the same.  The Japanese are lightyears ahead of us in toilet technology.
South Park sadly is not entertaining anymore. You had Jimmy talking for several minutes - didn't stutter once. Before it was social satire and lots of jokes. Now it's just basic social commentary without even an attempt to be funny
Ok I need one. Bed bath n beyond better fuckin have beyond.
Randy lol!
"Bro, I got fucking shot!"
Was funny to look at that clip while sitting on a Japanese toilet with a seat warmer, bidet and Bluetooth 😅
damnit I wanna try out a Japanese toilet!
💙💛
I love how now they are always playing the most recent videogames like rdr2 and Hogwarts
Only Trey Parker can make beautiful music to a scene of a man shitting. What's the song called?
この回を作ってくれてありがとう 日本人としてすごく嬉しいです
Randy's waddle to the toilet with his pants around his ankles 😆
as someone who has used one. OH MY GOD!!!
🤣 this is so funny
We can't get rid of old blue
What’s the song that plays when he uses the toilet.
I visited Tokyo ,, it’s all true
How much are you looking to spend?  Well I’m not poor.  Oh god.😂😂😂  Let me reiterate… I am not poor
how much? 5 thousand dollars!
They really are ahead of us in technology wow!
The first thing I instantly thought of when the bidet toilet welcome music played was The calling’s Where ever you will go.   If I could, then I would, I’ll go where ever you will go.
Japanese toilets are fucking amazing.
why does Randy spray before putting in the work?
Can I find this South Park episode is based on actual truth it is pretty much a mind opener
Everyone has this one thing in common.  We all walk around with a little bit of shit in our ass.
Randy took his poop 💩  too Switzerland, don't know why Sharon is so protective of her turds..
Excellent video
I remember the first time I used a Japanese toilet
They are not kidding you know: the Japanese knows their toilet. That said, I prefer the old fashion one in SEA with their hoses, nothing fancy just practical.
White men are ruled by women.  Yuck!!!
This was my exact experience when I first tried a Japanese toilet lol 😂
Can any Japanese chime in?
Loved it
Koeler makes a seat for standard toilets and it converts your toilet to a full feture bed'e and works great I have them and would never go back.  about $800 for it, don't get the cheap ones they just break.
"did have kind of a big breakfast." 😅😅
Does it dry your ass also?
My brother had one installed in his house, which he's just sold. I asked if he was bringing the toilet with him to his new place. Can't imagine going back to a regular toilet once you've got used to the japanese style! At least the new owners will get to enjoy it.
So funny
I've used many japanese toilets, and i've refused to try any of their features.  Hell no!! haha
Stumbling on this while taking a shite.   Youtube you have out done yourself today
It's so deep joke about Kennedy's family and the junior Kennedy who would probably participate in next election! Just wow
🤣🤣🤣
Went to Japan a few years ago. I would genuinely get excited about needed to take a s**t. Never drank so much water
They always have a funny idea that comes from a simple thought and they make it all complex and it's hilarious and then they add some low vibrational fart humor. And that's the curve ball that always makes me laugh.
in japan-can confirm its true
Guys, I live in Jakarta, and there is a Lotte shopping evenue mall at Jl. Prof. DR. Satrio Street. At the top floor, there is a hidden toilet, public open, with these toilets. Sometimes, I just ride there to relax. Enjoy.
The amazing thing is, everything that the Japanese toilet did in this clip, it does in real life.
Nice video
Did anyone catch that the episode was about big pharma and the conflict of interest with big pharma doctors? The apology at the end was a slight remark similar to people saying don't Jeffrey Epstein us.   Aka don't murder us! The whole episode tried to piss off the most dangerous organize drug dealers in the world! 😂😂😂  While the stuff about dubay's in Japanese toilets are true there's always a deeper meaning in South Park! It's normally a metaphor for some other current event.
This scene is on point and depicts exactly why i bought 2 TOTO toilets in my new house....
Don’t squeeze the charmin! 🧻
whats the song name that plays when randy starts shitting on the japanese toilet?
For those who have a regular toilet, you can buy the toilet attachment that actually makes your toilet a bidet and have temperature and pressure settings . Good investment actually.
2:15 Postal 4
Someone on their writing team got a bidet attachment for $30 and learned the truth.
Never thought there'd be a character I'd hate more than Peter Griffin.
At no point in time was any of this funny.
I bit the bullet and got a higher end Toto toilet back in 2017 after renovating the bathrooms in my new home. Just make sure when you do to have an electrical plug installed next to your toilet bowl, which I did. Safety wipes only and never looked back ever since. First thing coming home on a cold day is sitting down on that pre-heated throne of a toilet seat <3
Having lived in Japan for 7 years I would say this episode is partially true.  The high end toilets *are* close to a religious experience.  But Japan also has the other end of the spectrum where you would suspect that the toilet was used for a mass murder and dystery outbreak 7 months ago and even when you take toilet paper with you (which you learn to do) there still magically won't be any once you're in there.  That's the real Mystery of Japan: you simply can't predict whether you'll get toilet nirvana or hell.
I live in Asia. And got an American Standard smart toilet for a fraction of the price of a Toto Japanese one. It's gamechanging.
My exact experience, too. Then, I was in a hotel that had the fancy ones. Welcome light and opening lid. I doubled down on the want.
Which one do you recommend?   "I'm not poor."
Wanna make fun of everyone Idiots only discovered washing your ass In 2023
Living in Asia and talking from experience once you go JT you can never go back!
poor old blue getting picked on for taking so much shit
Wondering how Hank Hill would react to that toilet...
Funniest shit I ever did see 😂
I like
lol, halarious!
lol, halarious!
I brought my fancy french press and Vietnamese coffee to work  Just so I can finish it off with the work bidet  It is our throne
ToTo is the brand.
The waitress offering sparkling water and champagne, lmao. Dead.
The music is the funniest part
🤣🤣🤣
after seeing this I can't wait to try a Japanese toilet as soon as I can get to one
Weed is just amazing.... 420 long live Randy!
👍💩
So... what's the Couric capacity on those toilets?
Deluxe One Piece unit, Hand Held Remote including premium Washlet 16 grand...Go in Style!!!
Dunno why but the woman coming out with sparkling water and champagne kills me every time.
Ok, so who else watched this while sitting on the toilet?
Can confirm  my Japanese bog has all those features ....
south park sucks now
HOLY 5H!T!! Did he get it?? I want one! How much!!??
Ever since I visited Japan and Taiwan...  I was like, "Holy fuck... This is the goddamn future!!"  They really are THAT good.
Lmao this is literally all the toilets in east asia
I love the fact that Randy can read Japanese.
I live in Japan, one of the things you have to get your toddlers used to is the toilet. They get scared when they see the lid open by itself, a light inside the bowl come on (so you don't miss the bowl at night), and the sound of water spraying inside the bowl so nothing sticks to it. The controls are like something from a Tesla, with functions like bidet, shower, massage (don't ask), heated seat, dryer, deodorizer, and a lift which elevates the seat mechanisms so you can clean underneath.
I've been away from South Park for a few seasons for personal reasons. Is it just me or does randy sound different?
When I visited Japan, my friend and I went to a bar and got drunk.  The place looked nice, but it was underneath a railway and to go the bathroom you had to cross a kind of storage construction corridor.  I wasn't even expecting a hole at this point, but man was I wrong. I opened the door, the lights switched on, the toilet seat opened and the toilet greeted me.   Best bathroom experience ever! I came back half an hour later to my friend and told him he HAD to check out the bathroom.
SOMEONE MAKE A 1 HOUR LOOP ON THE TOILET SONG PLEASEEEEE
I've had one (ToTo) since 2003 when the seat was $5k and now I have a second one bought from Amazon for $400. Best tech on the market.
South Park rules! Japan rules! Though my throne works perfectly fine, I still want one of these. Just an observation; A man that can not repair a conventional toilet should be deeply ashamed of himself. The Japanese have a special product for THAT too. It's really "cutting edge".
Been in a coma since season seven, things sure have changed.
Sounds gross. Someone else’s poop and pee water splashes up on the sprayer that sprays your ass in one spot and may or may not have a dryer. Then anything that’s not dry drips down to your taint and balls
Bro it’s not even the same, once you go bidet you don’t go back
I’m dead.  😂😂😂😂.
I want one
They forgot to mention the water swishing sound effect button to conceal the user’s embarrassing pooping sounds.
Steve From Boston brought me here.   🤘😆🚽
I went to japan in 2001......yes, the toilets were magical, seriously, wish I had one.......if you got an actual toilet and not a hole in the ground.
This had to be the most boring episode of south park I ever watched with the money they make they ought to make good shit like they used to it's like they're scraping the barrel already with Randy's ass already.
Why Randy married Sharron is beyond me.
😂😂😂😂😂
Watching this while being in a Japanese toilet...
The music that plays during the toilet scenes is epic haha
Why didn’t he open the lid well she left
Randy's the best haha
Bathrooms in hotels and airports in Japan are so nice and private. The  hotel I was in , the bathroom was almost like a pod placed in the room. Felt like the hotel could have callapsed but I’d be safe in the bathroom escape pod. Had the same feeling in the airport bathroom.
As smart as the satire on this show is, I laughed the hardest at the absurd sound effects of Randy shitting his brains out.
randy is hilarious.
How much?
Yea.  Thats pretty much a toto
hogwarts legacy
I swear to God my guy at my local Home Depot looks exactly like the fella in Home Depot South Park.
Had an old toilet  And his name was Blue
I want a bidet that can blast the barnacles of the bottom of a boat.
Lived in japan for 3 years! Everything said here about the toilets is 100% accurate!! 😭😭
GREETINGS FROM MEXICO CARNALES Y COMPADRES
THE BLUE TOILET IS THE BEST IS AMERICAN AND MUCH MORE TRUSTED 💯
MMM WELL I THINK I PREFER THE NORMAL TOILET  😗
Here's a clue... check into that big hotel in Tokyo... go to the bathroom... press the button... but *take a look* at that magic wand that comes out.  Shit-encrusted?  You bet!  There's a reason that toilets should not be complex devices... you want a bidet?  Get a bidet... hell, I've taken a bath in a bidet before... don't ask... the shower was down the hall.
Once you go bidet you can't go back. Nowadays when using a strange "paper" toilet away from home it resembles a solitary confinement prison protest.
I went to Japan in 2011 and they had advanced toilets so I can only imagine now
Wondering why Randy and Stan's voices sound different. Deeper almost?
I'm so happy they're still hilarious
Squat toilets are the best
Я играю в этом моменте кресло в гостинной
I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT!!! The most AMAZING and CLEANSING experience you'll ever have! 🤣
I like how dirty the old toilet was while everything else in the bathroom is clean but likely the same age.  I remember my 1st toilet in Japan (1980) was a hole in the floor with feet painted to give the best bombardier outcome.  Then in 1996 a high tech one in a fancy hotel.  I wanted to take it home as it could be a better companion than "Her"
Randy is the best character by FAR.
The writers must have had a field day doing their investigative piece.
Who else needs the Toilet Music released from this sequence on Spotify / Apple Music?
This was the funniest South Park episode I've seen since the mid 2000s
Ive been installing toto toilets and bidets for years. This skit is 100 percent accurate
I have a bidet installed on my toilet at home, and this perfectly describes it.
Then you push a button and a finger will come out and massage you. And the balls-crawl-function is only 800 extra.
Using a Japanese toilet is a life-changing moment. It´s literally splits a life in before and after, you´ll never have the same look on life
Lmao we asians just laughed at you american when covid strikes and toilet paper shortage happened 😂
You forgot to add that the Japanese toilets also allow you to adjust the pressure of the water bidet system so that you can control the strength of the water jet system that hits your arse. The water is also typically warm.
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!! Lol season 10 e 23 —  30 mins over Tokyo
Greek here, grown up my whole life with bidets, have no idea how people live without them. Bidets are ideal for homes, maybe hotel rooms. Not expensive like a Japanese toilet. But so much better than just having toilet paper. For public bathrooms, toilet paper is best. Though, like a lot of people, I won't go number 2 in a public bathroom unless it's an emergency. Suffered in the army a lot. They had Turkish toilets. Public bathroom bidets in poorer countries are usually a Turkish toilet and a hosepipe next to it. Messy, unhygienic. Though, I suppose public bathrooms usually are unless very well maintained.
So accurate!
South park has gotten so soft
I think Trey and Matt recently used Japanese toilets
I’ve been using a $2K bidet for years now and it brings me immeasurable joy every time I take a dump. I love being wealthy.
Holy crap, the South Park writing team sure know how to elevate mere toilet humor.
Japanese toilets will see a 1,000% increase in sales in the USA this year due to this episode.
When you build a 1x6 room with no wallpaper in the middle of your home and a Sim walks in to use the bathoom.
"'Would you like to, take one for a test drive?" Holy shit that was funny
i want one now anyone want buy me one
"Gross, dad!" 😂
Went to Japan, toilets are either like this or a hole in the ground. I still want one of these.
I know a lot of Women in America that own bidet. I used them and it was nice. Not life changing.
Randy has different voice actor now?
Now this is state-of-the-art-for-2023 advertising. I totally want one (even though I'm poor 🙁)
When I moved to Maryland, went to Home Depot, it was very easy to get someone to assist. I moved back to New York 35 years later. Went into a Home Depot could not find anybody to assist me. Finally after walking around the store I found a live person they said they would get me someone, I heard the call go out over the public address system, I let about 8 minutes go by and then I walked right out the door. Went into my local Ace Hardware paid about double the price but they had excellent customer service. Tried going back to Home Depot again not able to get any help whatsoever. From now on if I need assistance I go to Ace, if I know exactly what I want I go to Home Depot. I don't know if it depends on the area, or if things got worse over the years.?
I will bet he really stunk up the cubicle!
If you wish to know, the Japanese above literally translates to “Japanese toilet” 日本人　トイレ Japanese      Toilet
Eveeytime i see that tiktok ad with the rotweiler growling wearing a tshirt, i hope it tears that man in half im sick of it
When the seat is warm because of a warmer = 😊 When the seat is warm because of the previous user = 🫤
From my personal experience, once you use a Japanese toilet you wont wanna use the standard version ever again
Bidets are a total waste of time. If you need one then it's not the toilet paper that is at fault it's your terrible diet and fitness levels.
First time I used a Japanese toilet I almost put my head through the ceiling. Water ended up going all over the bathroom, I panicked put my hand over the water nozzle instead of pressing the button.  Shit was fucked up…
@1:59  Kohler Veil intelligent Toilet was displayed at "Japanese toilet section" 😀
What's with Southpark the last 3 years? I love everything before that but there falling off hard
Please come back to being completely non PC.
After using a toilet with a bidet, I bought one for each toilet in my house.   Just don't feel clean without one.
Thank you for going back to the single episode format and please keep on the Canadian prince and princess.
How many people after looking at this, went to Google Japanese toilets
When did Randy get a pot belly?
I love South Park but I wish they don’t have to add religious that’s way I don’t watch that much now
Pls not another tegridy farms ep
What happened to his voice? Different voice guy? Sounds like Napoleon dynimate
I lived in Japan, the toilets there are the best. Nothing like sitting on a warm toilet seat that feels premium and even cleans your ass for you. It's awesome.
So glad the west is starting to appreciate bidets and toilet add-ons.   Water > Toilet paper
Move over Japanese Knives Japanese Bidets are here
Once was on holiday in France and stayed at some farm in a caravan, we had an outdoor toilet made from wood, just a hole in the ground, a curtain as door, some French magazines and newspapers, after youwere done, you threw some saw dust on your poo and done. When eventually the hole is full, you relocate the toilet. Dig new hole, cover the old one. Best experience ever. Take a dump in nature.
Old blue 😢
Bidet is awesome.
It's always weird to me to think that Americans don't wash their asses properly LOL
An appropriate follow up to the Prince of Canada episode
Good to see Randy is playing Hogwarts legacy and not letting his kids play. Just like me.
I am baffled that South Park was able to perfectly recreate my first experience purchasing/using a Japanese toilet. That was 4 years ago so this was nostalgic AF
What’s you do to it!
Oh fuck off now I want one
My Home Depot have no such toilets on sell nor helpful staff, much less ones that offer me water and champagne.
“You gotta fight these fairy guys” I see what happened here.
It's true.  All of it.  Japanese toilets are the best.
One of the best episodes ever honestly
I forget who said it, but they took a trip to Japan and said of the toilets: "at first its weird, but after awhile you'll be giving yourself the hydro-floss just because you're lonely."
Japanese workers are exactly like that
Happened to me irl. I even knew about them before and swore them off. First night in Japan got blasted came back to the hotel and whoops, by mistake fan.
here's a real life example https://youtube.com/shorts/rQ3ZubWINus?feature=share
I got a $75 toilet. Works just fine. Funny video.
Tegrity far schtick is getting old
to people who think these toilets are not true... i can tell you from personal experience it's ALL REAL
I had a layover in Tokyo once, I remember the toilets....
😆
ugh "thanks'' matt, trey. Now the prices of these toylets just jumped 10 fold.
They're not even exaggerating about the features either
When did Randy’s voice get so deep?
wait... so sharon and shelley aren't dead after all?
Seems like this episode is an allegory towards the creators' feelings towards Harry and Markle. They care about the feelings of poop paper more than the feelings of Harry and Markle. Heavy dis and it's brilliant.
He pulled his trousers down before walking up to the toilet 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Japanese toilet are the best😂🚽
What is the song? love it!
Aren't there cameras in the Japanese toilets and urinals?
Surprise it didn’t compliment Randy on the size of his penis 😂
Buying a Bidet was the best money I've ever spent in my life
Exactly my emotion when I first went to Japan and found out that the toilets i've been using all my life are... sh*t
honestly. the episode was a shipwreck
That’s a really big powder room.
I lived in Japan for 3 years and never used the cleaning function, I refused. The heated seat were a surprise though lol.
3:02 🤣
Said it before, but I do not deserve this show in my life
Toilet Paper just Spreads the Yellow Stuff around. Americans need to Start Washing. 😂
I went to Kyoto Japan last 2019 and Randy's experience is similar to what I felt back then.
Anyone else watching this on their phone while taking a shit
Funny thing is, they're not even that expensive in Japan lol
Hahaha
Thing is, the specs are accurate. Word for word. Currently in a Japanese hotel with exactly such a toilet.
I am Japanese and I had opposite effect coming to America. I felt like a cavemen and a mental patient in the American bathroom. I never fathom I'd had to use my hand to clean myself with dry paper.
I want a bidet for my own home so much.
I thought Randy and Sharon were getting a divorce?🤣🤣🤣
Abloustly HYSTERICAL! 🤣
I want a ToTo
been in Japan 12 years, yes you still need toilet paper ffs
am i imagining it or is his voice deeper?
how many curics was that test drive?
I spent 7 months in Japan and this is 80% accurate. You don't technically need toilet paper but actually you will almost always see 2 rolls of toilet paper, next to each other and ready to be used. You might wonder "why 2 rolls instead of 1?", and if you understand Japanese culture you will know why => it's to avoid the situation where someone finishes a roll and then there's no more toilet paper, hence the 2 rolls. The temperature of the seat can be adjusted, there's even sometimes a fake flush sound (guess why this exists?), and sometimes a clock too.
I lost my shit, when a Japanese toilet said "greetings" to me. Literally and figuratively.
This is SO GOOD, i'm DYING from laughing!!!!
Nooooo not bluechan....
My parents got the cheap one that uses cold water and goes full blast
the moment randy took a shit my dog farted.. for a second i thought we have finally reached the moment you can smell stuff through videos..
In the ladies you have the option of different music
Randy is an absolute chameleon in satire for South Park. He's hilarious 😆
I prefer Polish toilets.
I first time when I was in Japan and went into the hotel toilet, which was back in 2018, it was like I have stepped into the future. My ass felt like it has gone to heaven. Exactly Randy's reaction.
When the hotel I stayed in, in kyoto, had the seat being always the right level of warmth was so good.
I live in Japan and will say, i don’t look forward to shitting in the west ever again!
Is it juss me or does randy sound different (also watching this while sitting on the toilet)
I just love Randy. "Your mum took a shit and doesn't want me to see it" "Ew!" "Gross dad!!" lmfao!
Is the prince of canada gonna buy one for his stupid wife 😂😭😂😭
Anyone got a link where I stream these ?
0:48, haha.
north americans not washing there asz with a spayer in this day and age is some mind baffling nastiness
Poor ol' blue!
Old blue lol
i said no to my wife about japanese toilets for years. It is magical. Nuff said
i just like how the farting sound is made by mouth  😂
that doesn’t sound like randy
Too damn funny.
Do the Japanese toilets come with a hand free auto cleaner?
When I first moved to Canada from the Middle East 20 years ago, I was like WTF ??? People don't wash their asses here ??? And I thought we were backwards in the Middle East 😂😂😂
Absolutely loved this episode, cannot beat South Park satire to this day
Bruh my Dad has bought one for his home yesterday. The amount of money he put into that thing could carry me financially through my next 4 years of university💀💀💀
My new ringtone
I’m surprised it took randy that long to discover Japanese toilets
I'm literally watching this clip while taking a shit. Not on a Japanese toilet though
I can't believe that right wing christian uhmericun google actually allowed this clip to be displayed on their channel. Anyone who watches it must immediately say 3 hail mary's and wipe their bums with nettles and razor wire.
I'm living in Japan and I confirm everything in this episode. My Panasonic toilet has more buttons than a spaceship.
Old blue
I expected Gatsu from the Beserk soundtrack to start playing when the toilet opened
Funny how high-end store serves champagne. My wife works at Louis Vuitton store and they do serve champagne (to the selected customers only).
Silly question. Is trey Parker still the voice actor of randy? He sounds different here
Love South Park. They are just good at converting society's stuffs into comedy.
Now thats the type of ending that keeps me laughing after the credits, thanks for lampooning us asshole dads! Lol great episode.
I’d die happily if you gave Ned like 2 seconds of screen time with like a short line even without just like two seconds of him In the background randomly would bring me peace. Please consider tis all I ask of thee
If it's good enough for Randy, million's of male's in the U.S.A. are going to update their old blue's, white's, etc. etc. etc. I'm baseing my statement on the fact that, from the vast collection available. The one I choose to purchase, is on a one year waiting list from Japan.
Haven’t really watched South Park since the whole streaming service took over the world. So the Marsh’s really did move out of South Park? The whole farm thing wasn’t just a episode or 2 thing. It stayed for good! Wow.
Dude seriously even their public train station looks more clean and warm water to clean your butt i know because i went to Japan and best memories are their toilets warm n clean ...😊
The Sparkling Water... We all know where that came from
Good idea until the power goes out
This is exactly what is like
The 3 sea shells...
I'm actually legit hoping this gets people to buy a bidet. The US is so godamned far behind when it comes to being sanitary.
Used to be a contractor, calling bullshit on him finding help at home depot.
The Japanese really does be making the world great again
My question is. Why would somone want one of their orafises.. sprayed by a water jet thats housed INSIDE a toilet bowl. Seems a recipie for infection.
Where i can get this music?!
Wendy x stan is stupid you should put kyle x stan instead
All hits no misses this season
I love old blue it make me feel comfortable when I poo.
I've had to battle the fairy guys in Oxford St. and I lost.
It's so true about Japanese toilets!  Warm or cold water jets that move up and down and pulsates! <3 They are just incredible for the morning after spicy food. If you are feeling adventurous, turn the jet power to the max, relax a little and it will clean a bit of your inside too. :D  I love 'em!
Does anyone know what the song is when he sits down?
This is all true. They aren't even exaggerating.
I thought he was going to get a squat toilet out of spite.
Such a bad episode
👍👍👍👍
Randy is the main character in this show.
This is so relatable.
so glad they did this about the japanese one and not the french ones....ugh....the french...should have let hitler win.
That's a big powder room.
Ahhhh !!!
The only thing missing here is the soundtrack of a babbling brook / tweeting birds drowning out the noises involved Whilst dropping a massive deuce
Anyone know companies that sell Japanese Toilets.
I live in Japan. This is one big reason I live in Japan. It also explains why we don't shake hands with people from outside Japan.
I liked it, this is indeed how toilets are made in middle east, cleaning with water, except the dryer part which is a japanese special 😂
Please just end the show this is terrible
i live in japan and ive had to leave a deuce in the toilets a few times cos i dont know the flush button
My mind was blown when I visited Tokyo and discovered Japanese toilets. Apparently the natural noise options are because Japanese people are shy when it comes to the noises of poop splashing, so the noises of waterfalls help mask it. PS I haven’t felt so clean than using the spray.
Their description is pretty tame for what a Japanese toilet is really like.
Would you  like to take one for a Test Drive? lol
This episode isn't really about toilet paper, is it Trey?
the Simpsons already did that
Old blue 💙
I went to Tokyo and in the Airport I went to the toilet. I have no idea what the toilet was, it was like a floor toilet or something, I had no idea how to use it
Oh Toto, I miss you so much Toto
So meta. I was taking a dump whilst watching this clip.
best show on tv
Was it good for you as it was for me?
Maybe this episode will convince americans to clean off their assholes with a bidet
Honestly, this made me want to go out and buy a fancy Japanese toilet.
No sound cancelling?
I dont know how to break it to people but 'rich' people have used bidets for a very long time... the automation is the only step up and its probably because of the rich to begin with.
whats the music in the toilet
I don't get Americans just wiping their ass with toilet paper, I mean make it damp at least or use wipes.
I'm getting a 404 trying to look up that episode. Could this be a regional thing?
good
That toilet looks Chinese....
Admit it, you're also watching this while taking a dump, wishing you had a Japanese toilet.. and.. a Japanese girlfriend......
randy sounds diffrent here
“Would you like to take it for a test drive…?”
At first an "Electric Tolier Seat sounds like a torture device. But it is in Japan, which is odd because they also have the squatters.
Even cheap hotels in Japan have spectacular toilets🤣
I had two installed in my house!!!
i love how hes making japanese voice noises XD
Thats why I love South Park. They always over sell over do things.
Does it bother you that Randy didn’t wash his hands?
every time that song came on when they're trying the toilet, the "ohhh yeah" fuckin killed me lmao
As a person who recently visited Japan and had this experience, I can 100% confirm that this is accurate.
My wife and I bought a $300 bidet from Costco and my asshole has never been cleaner. One of the best buys of my life and easy to install.
They are lightyears ahead of us.
That music that comes on when he enters the special toilet room
Brad Pitt in Bullet Train.
What amazes me is how like "current" these episodes are
I just strapped an electric pressure washer to my toilet, gets your ass amazingly clean, as well as your colon. It’s also a little painful and unpleasant, but other than that, I’m clean. 😜
You need something dry to wipe with after the water to get clean.
Powder room 😂 Haven’t heard that for a long time!
Best shits I’ve ever taken we’re on Pee-wee Herman’s chair, the chair the dude on Blue’s Clues sits in, and finally the big comfy couch.
I started to feel my body tense with anger with that first scene
sane thoughts when I used one at Haneda Airport.... Oh My Gawd best experience ever lol
2:46 I love the little piano notes that play everyday bombshell news is dropped
I hope this isn’t a one off episode this needs a sequel or something, episode was amazing
This is only a slight exaggeration, no to be honest the top of the line ones are exactly like that, so the only exaggeration is the whole red carpet toilet boutique in the back of Home Depot.  Home Depot is not classy enough.
I'll take two
Bro was mesmerized 💀
i got rid of cable 4 years ago. best decision of my life. *Best*
If you’re wondering what the song name is, it’s : Days of Blue - Sons of Maria
How many men and women of culture just searched for videos of real japanese toilets to see if this shit for real?
Damn that's weak. Just like I thought, nothing special.
God the graphics have gotten so good. Look how detailed the background settings are now
First of all — and I can’t stress this enough — this is actual toilet humor. Secondly I enjoy how Randy is so fond of his old toilet and has a name for it. Can’t relate, but it makes his character that much more interesting.
I use the Public Bathrooms when I'm at Homo Depot.  Next time I will use the Japanese Toilet instead. Never knew they had such a thing.
Toilet vs. Japanese toilet $100 vs $1,000+ But, yes. It is that good.  The symbols on the touch pad are accurate too. Water Strength, Angle, positioning the bidet, Seat warmer, Self clean airblow , etc.
When randy said :" you're mad" I totally lost it 😅
I was born in Okinawa in the 60's.  I witnessed many of the Japanese Toilets being a hole in the ground, and one would squat over them to poop or pee. Take that Randy,
It's okay to Jiggle the Handle. Problems start though, when You Handle the Jiggle
I would only buy one if that music plays during my shit
One day you won't even have to take the poop. Automatic Bluetooth poop transfer
I lived in Japan for 6 years, all of this is true, no bullshit
Does anyone know the theme song in the back ground? 😂 sounds lit 🔥
“I did have kind of a big breakfast.”
Some of these comments 🤣 😂
Again , another south park episode that was not funny . was it true? yes . Funny ? no .i cant believe most everyone here is so guilable. That episode was one huge plug for hone depot and playstation and the new harry potter game …  get a clue sheeple  trey and shats hus face SOLDOUT !
Speaking from personal experience of using toilets in Japan....they are indeed magnificent
Classic South Park is finally back. Thank god for that, lol! Three episodes in and they've already made headlines around the world.
I’m literally on my bidet while watching this lol
3:11 the future is now...
I had an ergonomic toilet featuring the TOTO Washlet installed in my bathroom a few years ago. Not only is it a pleasure to use, it cut my toilet paper usage to one roll per month.
I like pooping
As a Japanese person, I feel hopeless every time I travel abroad and encounter the filthiness of foreign toilets. Even poor people in Japan use toilets equipped with washlets
I need an extended version of the toilet song
This is absolutely true. I have experienced the Japanese toilets and they are amazing. Japanese baths are equally amazing. Japan is cool.
I laughed so F’ing hard, especially in the first half of this episode!
What’s Next A Tegridy Farms Movie?! 😂🎬🎥
My friend has those.  I can't figure them out
3:12 who wouldn’t wanna hear this music while absolutely obliterating their toilet??
Japanese toilet was always ahead of the time 20 years ago when I visited Tokyo.
Finally....Randy has his throne
They’re Toto toilets if you want to look at one for yourself. They define luxury.
I really want to try the Japanese toilet now😂
So from $600 to $6,000. I don’t respect my toilet enough to spend that kind of money on it.
A bidet toilet is easily one of my top 3 purchases of all time.
I'm just back for this 3:12 😂 what a beautiful piece of music too shit too
They sell themselves lol
I wonder how good of a job these do when you are hairy and you didn't have the standard level evacuation. This would normally call for a shower or a proper power wash.
its like good cheese or fine wine, once you get a taste of it you cannot go back.
No one should have to bury their toilet 😔
Just don't shit while it's squirting water I made that mistake once
Are there toilets radioactive?
I miss my  🥑 and the dog but not eve🤣
What’s up with his voice?
The moments where different characters enter the bathroom and the music starts playing gets me 😂
I just want to know what toilet Japanese song that
Imagine people with hemorrhoids and pressurised water wash
Now lets see the Canadian version of this lol
When I sore the title of this episode I automatically knew it’d be a Randy special 😂
Mr Hanky is going to be out of a job. Oh well I guess you just throw him on the Megan and Harry pile.
Konichiwa ookii American chin chin
The Music🤣🤣
If you're using a public one, just... check the pressure setting before using it. One was set to "prison rape" and I still haven't recovered from the shock of getting anally fisted by a bidet.
"You're in the Hospital because you pressed the ATR button" "Automatic Tampon Removal" 😄😄
Love it
The worst thing in the Marsh’s bathroom was the toilet paper roll being held the wrong way round.
Not me. Never! I will never change from good ole fashioned toilet paper. And not just any toilet paper but the kind made from real tree bark. Unprocessed like God intended it to be. Cold, rough and gnarly and hurts like hades when you have diarrhea but no way. I'll never set my American butt on a Japanese toilet. I'd rather die first.
Trey's voice is f-king up.
this is funny because i recently changed my gender to a chinese toilet
I love how the store guy stands outside listening to Randy's first experience, just like Randy does at home! 🤣
The cultural appropriation of Japanese goods by white middle class people as exotic luxury items? Priceless.
Ah lame, thought they ditched farmer Randy.
POO-R OLD BLUE on its way to the big bathroom in the sky 🚽😭
Yo why are Berserk vocals playing over the Japanese toilet soundtrack lmao
I love living here!  Got them everywhere!  Convenience stores, all the shopping centers, and two in my home!  Niiiicccee!!
PUNISH YOUR TOILET!!
So someone please enlighten me. The toilet sprays your ass with water. How does that clean you better than the paper? I don't see how that can be possible. You walk away with a wet ass hole? Please make this make sense.
Love this episode. Especially the japenese who delivered the toilet to randys house. So fucking good haha
I doubt any amount of water "spraying" would clean an ass as hairy as mine 😅
btw it’s so true we all wash our self with water in my country and THEN use toilet paper for drying ...
the sorry at the end waasssss so f funny
Japanese toilets couldn't handle a western diet
The crazy thing is, they're not even that expensive.
Y'all spoiled the episode for me by giving away the plot before it came out on HBO Max...  Not a fan of this channel...
I can speak from experience, in the 70's, most places didn't have "Western" toilets!
I love the song that plays.
I visited Japan and I’m getting a 🇯🇵 🚽 installed. Regular bidets are so yesterday.
Wait til he discovers Japanese p¥rn
🎶Oh yeah 🎶
I'm English. We're just glad when it's not a hole in a plank.
Even though I don’t have a Japanese toilet, I can confirm that a big day cleans your ass way better than toilet paper.
I lived in Japan for a couple of years and I can attest all of the features on the toilet are true, no exaggeration here, I fell asleep a couple of times while taking a dump 🤣🤣🤣
100% true
Obviously never been to a Home Depot.
lololol the toilet music
this is how it feels to be in a japanese airport
I’ve been to Japan, and I can confirm this is 100% accurate
in middle east they don't need toilet paper as well :)))
So really , no TP?  And completely dry?
No seriously…how much?
Didn't Randy become a Geologist again in a previous episode? I liked Geologist Randy better than Weed Randy. Do episodes more like old south park again. This episode wasn't bad. It was pretty good, but weed Randy isn't all that funny.
Funny how some people think you don’t need toilet paper with a washlet…half the time you need more.
I wish they'd just make a Randy Marsh show for all the retards that won't just up about him.
After using Japanese toilets for a month, and then coming back to the U.S. and using the standard toilet. I felt like I was in the "Land of The Savages." 😂🤣 Japanese toilets are a tough act to follow...
Your mad🤣🤣
Damn those toilets are the shit
In case anyone is wondering, Days of blue by sons of maria is the song
10k toilet. No seatbelt 😆
sometimes i wish randy was my dad cause he seems like such a cool dad if he wasnt racist
We can’t just get rid of ol blue Sharon 😂😂
anyone has a link to the music?
South Park is one of the best series ever because it’s still great with scenes like that hahaha
I've been to Japan twice and always had toilet anxiety. The instructions were all in Japanese and all kinds of things were going off.  Not necessarily in the right order!  But when I cracked the code (usually by accident), it was CIVILISED.
This was a funny episode but I’m not quite sure what the creators were trying to say
South Park forever. Randy forever.
That music is so perfect lol
Funny enough I'm watching this during 4:20
I was thinking that all my life. Americans are disgusting, walking around with dirty assholes
Western men learning about washing their ass in 2023 is crazy
Glad  to see randy financially  recovered from that blockbuster fiasco
Someone needs to get the toilet music isolated recorded on a loop!
I lost it at the test drive
Bidets really should be more common. Smashing shit around your ass with paper is some caveman nonsense.
Omg I remember using them for the first time. I FUCKING JUMPED
This episode just persuaded me to buy a Japanese toilet. Not only is it cleaner for the user, but it's cleaner for the environment. Everyone wins!
I need this music😅
2:15 Postal did it first mate (Definitely didn't come here from the RWS twitter lol)
Nihongo no Toire :P
All of it is 100% true.
I need those Japanese toilets!
Can't get rid of ol blue Sharon!
Rip old blue
Anyone notice how they refuse to mock Biden? Did a full season mocking trump? Hmmmm🧐
RIP Ol Blue
how much?
Randy still runs a weed farm? I thought he want back to being a geologist. There was a whole song and everything.
I couldn't understand why americans were hoarding toilet paper at the beginning of Covid... now I know why. Try Bidets like Randy and I bet you will never be able to go back to tp.
Hilarious!
Damn, when did South Park become reality tv?
lol - gotta love Randy
2:44: I experienced this first-hand at an airport in Japan. Unfortunately, I thought I was FLUSHING the toilet…
Just think. With only a quick ferry ride to China, you could poop in a hole Right into a pig pen.
I thought they just squatted over a hole.
Owning a Japanese toilet is one of my life goals. 😊
Besides the Sharron, Shelly and the waiter serving champagne. Every single character in the scene was voiced by Trey lol
This episode was so weird, but amazing. Nobody does toilet humor better than South Park.
“Shut up and take my money!!”
I just came here for the toiletmusic.
The most unbelievable part is a Home Depot employee actually stopping to assist you with anything...
Watching this while taking a dump and about to use my bidet
Did i hear a "Berserk" Theme when he was on the Toilet? XD
I remember when I visited Korea, the hotel had one of those. When the water shot up my ass, it gave me a half chub. Made me question my sexuality
Does anyone know the japanese toilet song?
I need a toilet that plays this song lol 😆.
*Randy bought Hogwarts Legacy NICCCCCCE.* 💪🏽
Fairy tail I tell you.  Never, ever, not once... has a HD employee ever walked up to me and asked if I needed help.  LOL
I need that toilet song... for my studies.
Crapping is a personal time that I enjoy very much. I might have to invest in one of these.  Oh and the fart/crap nlises of South Park never fails to make me laugh
I work at a Home Depot and when I saw this preview, I was getting Szechaun sauce vibes.
As a plumber I can confirm this is completely accurate.
i cant believe they actually made funny episode again, all that political crap was boring af
I had a Japanese toilet as my phones screensaver whilst doing a developer course just to keep me going because I want ones so bad
I've been around and seen and used many toilets in my life. A good Japanese Toilet without a doubt is almost impossible to beat and it is better for you.
the BILE 9000
You know, I've been scraping the shit off my asshairs for 40 damn years with fucking sandpaper ;( and I'm not poor damn it! It's time I get some comfort and luxury and DIGNITY... in my life. Time to get myself a japaneese toilet.
home creepo
The Japanese sounds while he’s in there is too much 😂
I need one of these. I adopted the Turkish way and have done for 15 years. Shower head cleaning, it's like a low budget b-tec version of what a Japanese toilet offers. Forget cars, forget high end tvs.. I want a Japanese toilet.. Yes! In anyone's experience how's the fresh feeling from 10 to yes?
For cleanliness reasons guys you don't even have to buy Japanese toilets, just wash yourself with water using a bucket thing you can get from anywhere, find anything right size and it's not only a Japan thing, people across the globe wash themselves with water outside the western world
Lol great episode.  Serious question to those who know, are the lower cost models still efficient?  I can do without all the extra bells and whistles.
OH OOHHHHHHH OHH!
Well, you either get toilets with a heated bidet seat.  Or you get a hole in the floor that you hang your ass cheeks over.  0:54 How many Courics? Of course the toilet won't flush, mom just dumped a Bono.
This episode was about the jews
Gauuuh!
Lmao! Holy shit this is accurate.
Shows been on over two decades and he just now discovers their toilets....
The music ......l
once u go japanese u never go back. dont know why their toilets arent readily available in the USA
Randy goes all-in
Over 25 years and they still got it
Never used a bidet or a Japanese toilet but wouldn't spraying a diarrhea covered butthole with water just turn it into a disgusting paste-like mush? Basically making more of a mess?  You'd still need toilet paper surely? Unless the water pressure is like crazy strong.
Just cancel this lame show.
Honestly I laughed out loud from this episode *maybe* more than any other South Park episode. What a damn masterpiece of comedy.
Aw man.. even randy gets to play hogwarts legacy before some of us...
The comedy central i have only has reruns of old episodes. Downloaded paramount + but it doesn't work in my region ....
Bidet and seat warmer are standard
I thought Randy went back to being a geologist
those toilets, Toto Neorest are like 17 000 USD here....I take a 50 USD porcelain toilet any day than spending a down payment to a house for a toilet.....
Come on guys, no link to Home Depot?
We had a ancient toilet we named Gentle Ben...   lol
Aw heck naw! South Park copied Cars 2!
Sooooo..... What happened to the Chinese then, and why do they squat over holes instead?!? 🤔Interesting, for sure. I may have to look into this Japanese toilet thing!👌
“Hey guys, you’re mom took a sh!t and doesn’t want me to see it.”😂
The only problem is if in Japan, and unable to read Japanese, good luck figuring out which button flushes the toilet. Theres so many buttons to push, its like being on a alien spaceship and needing to land it with strange controls but instead you need to flush your shame but dont know how.
How Randy took his pants down and THEN walked to the toilet 😂
I almost spit my food out when he said old blue 😂
Love me a good KARHART jacket xD
No a single video game involving Harry Potter requires that much mashing of the face buttons.
tell me how much 😢
The Japaneses must have improved their toilet technology. When I was there in the 80's the bathrooms in the bars had just a ditch you squatted over. They even had some like that at the airport.
idk man I tried the bidet in japan and I really felt like it ought to have bought me dinner first....
I work at Home Depot. This is legit!
Jokes aside, a sponge with soap sounds way better than toilette paper
This should been a 1 hour special to give it more time to be fleshed out.
I tried one for the first time a few weeks ago and this is exactly my reaction 😆
I'll take 2...
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
This fucking sucks
Nailed it lol 😆 🤣 😂 xx
I love splattering feces all over the place.
Damnit Sharon, the toilet doesn’t need to be replaced, you just need a new float system.
If Home Depot would let me take a test poop on one of these in their store, I'd die a happy man.
I thought he gave up being a weed farmer
Is it weird that I want one now
FBI. Holland. Milad/Smith. Good thing I'm about to be rich. I'll pay the Yakuza to handle Smith.
My flight went over Japan .....I landed in the Philippines...I shit in a toilet that you have to fill by hand with water And then slap your ass with a cup of water.....I should of hired one of the locals with a water gun
60 bones for a toaster?!!?
Two things we learned from this episode; 1. Trey Parker has hemorrhoids 2. Treys smoking weed again Not the quality I would expect of SP.
Living in Westminster Colorado the first scene is just so common 😂 it's just because we're always making jokes at each other being a little high here and there and it's always when the toilet gets clogged and I get asked why it won't flush and it's like "no, you can't see, just fix it" 😂🤣🤭👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
😂😆🤣
MAN I CANNOT BELIEVE THE SOUTH PARK GUYS ARENT MAKING FUN OF JOE BIDEN AND THIS AWFUL ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAVE SO MUCH MATERIAL!!!!! UNREAL
Simpsons did it ❤️
Was this episode all about that punch line in the end to his wife :D
That bidet music prolly what plays at criminal execution waiting room.
Was he playing Hogwarts legacy?
Is no one going to talk about how Randy’s playing Hogwarts Legacy
🎶 🎵  Oh yea. 🎵 🎶  🤣  Found my new ring tone!
Reminds me of the time I was in a fancy hotel and the bidet had about 20 settings and my Mrs fell asleep. Next morning she was getting frisky took her hand and said the bidet done the job. I’m empty 🤣🤣🤣
Once you've shit in a Japanese toilet...Western toilets feel like it's the 1800's
Randys voice sounds different
Hilarious
"Would you like some champagne?"
Why are they back at the farm? What was even the message of this episode? That toilet paper kills too many trees or that Japanese toilets use too much water? Randy sold the farm in the streaming wars implying Tegridy Farms was over, and this episode really didn’t make any solid political or social sense to me. It all just seems lazy to me on Matt and Treys part; especially when they had two weeks to make this episode!
Where I come from toilets come with a hose on the right and toilet paper on the left so when you're done you wash your butt with the hose and dry it with toilet paper 🤔 i never understood why in us they only use paper
Nice video #splendorwaleyr
Id like to buy one too. Are these things real?
I think they need Japanese toilets in Greece.  Apparently, in Greece, you put used toilet paper in a little basket next to the toilet as the Greek plumbing cannot handle toilet paper ( the Greek plumbing was designed by the British for some reason).
2:16 BLUETOOTH?
I can confirm japanese toilets are magical...  like wow...
Men, avoid the lady's setting. It will hit you right in the taint, and not in a good way.
I love the fact that now Randy wears a pothead hoodie...LOL! 🤓🤣
The toilets in Japan rank higher than my gf , dog and work for reasons that keep me from moving back to the Uk. Fact.
Ew! Gross, Randy!
First time I ever used one, I felt shame upon realizing that my "dirty bits" were, at that point, the cleanest part of my body.
Wow he found someone at home depot that’s incredible.
People find it weird to use a bidet but grabbing a tissue so they can stick it up their ass with bare hands is not weird at all.
No. Really. HOW MUCH?
🤣🤣🤣
The audio really makes you feel the tegridy.
Matt and trey have obviously test driven teslas before 😏😏
Real talk as a Japanese🇯🇵 YES, if we go into the bathroom and find out the toilet doesn't have "washlet" or seat heating system or fancy music softly playing background.... we get upset a bit I'm not gonna lie.  But let me remind u that in rural area, we still have "Botton benjo" or traditional japanese toilet, which smells horrible due to the feces being stocked in a hole below them, and we have to just squat on the toilet(cuz there is no seat to sit on) and it's kinda degrading... We even have trucks just for collecting feces from those old types.  So I just wanted u to know that if u r going to visit Japan expecting clean toilets...  GO TO BIG CITIES
Perfect “Takeaway” close by the home depot salesman 😍.
I need the link to the Toilet Song anybody?!?!?!?
this episode might have been about Japanese toilets, but it was never about Japanese toilets, if you know what I mean...
The acoustic guitars with fluttering female vocals as the toilet opens is perfect.
for those of you who dont know.. this isnt comedy.. this is a legit documentary about the difference between Japanese toilets and the swill buckets the rest of us crap into..
I'm a person who doesn't need a lot of expensive things to be happy. However, if I won the lottery I'd definitely buy a Japanese toilet. They sound awesome.
when South Park did those episodes ridiculing those who questioned the vaccines, they put themselves into corner, holding arms with the fauci establishment. is this them realizing they were wrong? i sure hope so..
NOT FUCKIN RANDY AGAIN MORE CARTMAN AND THE BOYS PLEASE
My bathroom looks like Randy's bathroom!
During Covid, for “shits and giggles”, I picked up a $50 bidet from the depot and have never looked back. It’s literally life changing. For better and for worse. You become very confident and comfortable, but sadly using another bathroom just isn’t the same. A bunch of my friends and family picked up bidets as well. They all are extremely satisfied. I also picked up a portable one now for when I’m on fishing trips. I’ve become way too spoiled. Lol
This is what south park became 4 mins for a fart joke -_-
I made my own with a kettle and a jet washer. It blasts everything clean but covers the walls
I prefer wet wipes
why did you make him so fucking hot
I bought a Toto bidet seat years ago, and never want to go back to toilet paper. Heated seat, warm water, and warm air dry.
I lived in Okinawa. This is not...too much off the mark lol
This episode really cracked me up with some classic South Park humor 😄
There’s one thing inaccurate about this. The Home Depot doesn’t have customer service.
This is also my experience the first time off the plane in Tokyo.
I learned about the simple magic of water in west africa. Where they don't use toilet paper. A bit less luxurious than the Japanese but nonetheless effective.
Tegridy episodes suck.
we're STILL doing the Japanese toilet jokes?  it's crazy how old this show seems now
Matt and Trey must have definitely watched the Thermae Romae anime show. I'm pretty sure that's where they got the idea to make this episode.
I bought a bidet for my home toilet as soon as airplane mode was off when we landed back in the states.
Missed opportunity for the toilet to go “Arigato-teehee 💖🎶” after Randy let’s put his big breakfast
Hogwarts Legacy!
Thanks to South Park, all American’s can now see the advantages of Japanese toilets. Sales are going to sky rocket, kurashi!
The best experience ever
Never seen a bidet...
LMFAO Matt and Trey NEVER DISAPPOINT,  always current with what's going on in the world and then some. Hope they never stop.
So true. Having experienced this comfortable Highend toilets once - every other type feels like doing it on an open field in the middle age century not knowing anything about civilization. Take two sticks - one to lean on, the other to defend against the wild animals gathering for your warm output.
Two things I missed from living in Japan from 1994-2000. Fancy electronic toilets and vending machines that always work.
The final line of this episode was hilarious!
So many meanings in this episode. Can one find them all...
I THOUGHT THE STORY WAS OVER. WHY ARE THEY BRINGING BACK TEGRIDY FARMS
What happened to Randy's voice, did they get a new person.
You know an entire culture is doing things right when you have a stressful day and the first thing you do to relax is go sit on your toilet.
little does he know he only need to buy the seat part
Poor ol' blue
Asians are smarter? 😂
went to go visit my cousins who moved to japan about 13 years ago. sat down when i first got in, and this thing literally scared the shit out of me. blasted water that wasnt heated, but after the rest of the trip was hilarious
You often don't even have to get a whole new toilet, you can get a unit that just replaces your existing toilet seat with a seat that has the majority of these features (heated seat, heated water, dryer, light, sound, etc.).
Japanese toilets are the real deal...
I don’t care what anyone says, I think this episode is funny!  “Ol’ Blue” Yep. They don’t make colored toilets anymore.
Taking a poop in a Tokyo Burger King has never been so satisfying.
Based Randy playing THAT Wizard game.
Hey kids your mom's just took a shit!! Haha haha haha haha oh that Randy Marsh...😂
Honestly,i'm tired of pulling peanut butter out of the carpet. Heading to Home Depot,thanks Randy! Have a great bidet everyone.
As someone who only bought a bidet attachment for my toilet about two years ago I can already confirm Randy's reaction. I feel so much cleaner and less wasteful.
Music is: Sons of Maria - Days of Blue
But, what is it's Katie Couric yield?
Whats funny is they are not exaggerating what new toilets can do lol.. they aren't Japanese exclusively.. but the first run down of what they can do is actually true as hell lol
“Days of Blues” 🎶   By Sons of Maria
Dosnt beat the Australian thunder box.
When will Tegridy Farms finally die? It’s the worst part of the show
I'm not poor neither!.. :(
I dare anyone not to be seduced by the Japanese loo
I bought a bidet seat at the beginning of covid, and it's pretty damn great. It has a heated seat, heated water, varying sprays, and a dryer. It's pretty damn great.
What are the odds! I currently have an anal fissure, and just bought a bidet. South Park is reading my mind lmao
"im not poor"
Well SHIT sign me up for one.
Thinking back to when I went to Japan I can definitely say the toilets were something I would always remember... and miss.. dearly. I'll buy one someday for sure lmao
Anybody know where I can get the toilet music for meditation
I don't like Japanese toilets. Feels like someone is pissing on you 🤣🤣🤣
Lmfao
This is every single Japanese product. Massage, trains, audio equipment, food, customer service and toilets are all the best.
Something like this can only work with Randy’s character. If anyone else, it’ll be just weird.
The funniest part is that a Home Depot employee actually seeks out a customer to help.
ffs who the hell wants a warm toilet seat? its the most disgusting feeling ever, like an ass on ass experience. and a bidet? like i want an artificial kiss of posidon. keep your filthy modern toilet. ill stay with good old blue and scratchy paper!
I hurt my back in 2019 and had to buy a bidet because I couldn't rotate to get the job done. Best choice ever. My back has since gotten better but I haven't bought a roll of toilet paper since. In 2020 when everyone went crazy for toilet paper, I super villain laughed on my porcelain throne.
I thought randy gave up the weed thing ,,  didn’t he went back to geologist…..
please help me ❤️🤲
Hey is South Park not on Comedy Central anymore?? Where can I watch this??? Lol thanx
Ok how much 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ha ha. Nice one. Must be driven by one up mansbip to rub it into the rest of Asia where you squat over a hole and can't flush paper.
Best episode
Haha
Really good episode. I am now disappointed lights and music don’t play when I take a shit.  And the ending, “we’re not the Kennedy stan”. “Now apologize South Park”.
https://youtu.be/68HId_31Z30
That damn ,"oh yeah" gets me every time 😂
He should try out the Indian toilet next.
Link to episode doesn't work
As a peron who has been in Japan I can confirm this is legit. Absolutely true. Japanese toilets are one of the best things mankind has ever invented.
The amount of people who only think Japan have these toilets is astounding 😆
Same farmer bs . They have like a year to come up with new random stuff wtf zzz
They keep running the same shit every season now wtf
i need one of these. i definitely use to much 🧻
Being station in Japan I have to say from personal experience that this is so accurate
Man, Sharon is a hard-core b****.
HILARIOUS
Background song 🙂
Days of blues by sons of maria is the songs name for anyone looking for it
So? How much?
Japanese toilets have to be the best invention since life itself
So are we going to get a new Lorde song?
I want one of those so bad!
That was so satisfying
I’m Japanese and our high end toilets are one of the things I love the most about my country ❤
Poor old blue 😢🤣
😂
Love using a VPN to watch your videos on site <3
The Japanese toilets used in Japan were simply a hole in between footpads all within an area with a raised rim around the unit and one simply squatted over the hole and hoped your aim was true cuz them butt bombs oughta go in the hole. There was no warm water as I recall but there wasn’t a seat yet alone a heated one with party lights flashing to the beat of a edm rave.
This episode was hilarious
that song when he uses the toilet. that’s my breaking point 🤣🤣🤣
i need this track name asap
Can you guys make an episode where Cartman get their house back pleaseeeee🥺🥺🥺
Please make an episode to make fun of William and Kate and Charles
What happened to Randy’s voice?
This is the 3rd most accurate thing I've ever seen on South Park.
Minus the no toilet paper thing. This is all just true.
The best Americans haven't discovered. The kicker is it's affordable.
Like my shower walls if ya just spraying water on something it won't be as clean as wiping.  Water helps though.
god help me, this is so funny . i can't stop laughing .
Old Blue 🤣
I love how the  Randy got into new place
Would a Japanese toilet be able to handle the crap he can put out though?  He is both a runner-up and world record crapper.
...and Home Depo is probably wondering why everyone is coming in and asking where the Japanese toilet section is.
Honestly, Japan was dope AF. ...And those toilets are completely legit.
i want one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best advertising ever
I usually just shit behind the dumpster then kick some dirt over it.
Even Japanese public toilets are like this 👍
Music is actually fire 😂
Why's his voice different
TOTO toilets 💞👏👏👏
The hilarious part is randy is just moaning in the room while the home depot worker just waits
The hilarious part is randy is just moaning in the room while the home depot worker just waits
The hilarious part is randy is just moaning in the room while the home depot worker just waits
Why did he take his pants off like 5 feet away and waddle over
Randy isn’t poor. Randy has pooptegridy. Randy poops, therefore he is.
omg that was a great episode. Sucks that it didn't go any deeper. I would've liked to see Stan and co. investigate the toilet companies and get attacked by toilet paper related stuff.
Japanese toilet area became snoopys house in weird quantum space nonsense
Enjoy the go bro.
The salesman just casually waiting outside the door while Randy noisily unloads his guts made me laugh so fucking hard.  South Park really does get better with age.
Currently planning a trip with my brother specifically to use a japanese toilet by the end of the year.
The next time that I go to Home Depot, I'm going to test drive a Japanese toilet...
My first experience with a Japanese toilet was the _other_ type of Japanese toilet. If you know you know 😅
My question would be do women still need to wipe their vaginas after peeing or is there a setting that washes/drys their front parts too?
“Your mad” 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Here in my country Japanese toilet is pretty common and can be found in almost every house idk what luxury theyre talking about
What episode?
When I first experienced a Japanese Toilet at a subway station in Japan, I did not want to leave it for 10 minutes. 8 of them was me spraying the water on my butt.
Not only did he not wash his hands coming out of there, there wasn't even a sink. And dont give that "its the toilet" B.S. the guy said it cleans your ass, not your hands
The start of this clip is the funniest bit.  Randy hogging the video game from his children but acting like he's helping them. Then asking his wife if she jiggled the handle 😂 - the most pointless advice ever but what every man does.
this will go down as one of the most underrated south park episodes ever! It was amazing
Really need that bidet song lol
Oy yah.
Feeling good on a Wednesday
Hello Gene
My Japanese toilet is so good I now tell people they could eat their dinner off my a$$hole.
Sitting and shitting on my Japanese toilet righhhhhhhhht AHHHH Now!!
Actually, I watched this episode and want to note the Women use more toilet paper than anyone else. Facts, Bro! Wet wipes are way better than getting a robot spitting inside you. “I don’t consent “ to a toilet giving me a rim job. I would rather have a CDC scientist, saying that eating out or rim jobs give you Covid  (which they actually said, look at it)
Hm. So I see they brought back crazy karen Randy. That sucks.
"poor Old-Blue"
Hilariously enough, the toilets are pretty common and cheap in parts of Japan. The more fanciful ones will have lights and fountains. I just hope they never play the National Anthem when I'm in one.
mans was playing hogwarts lmao
The Nobu Penthouse Suite in Cesars Palace was the first experience I had with one of these fancy pants toilettes. It legit is pretty amazing.
Does Randy sound different to anyone else or is it just me?
I love how they are playing the harry potter game and its not been out so long. I keep forgetting how quick their turn around is
toilet humor at its best
I know everyone here is looking for the song so here you go "Days Of Blues by Sons Of Maria"
Trash taste podcast content right here
100000% Truth
Me, in Japan in 1995... aaaahhhh  oooohhhh. Okay, how much?
One day I want Japanese toilet money 🥲
Now I want one 😊😊😃
This is the way
I thought we had normal Randy back now?
I'd never leave the bathroom.
"You're mad"
I do all my shitting outside
The funny thing is that they are not exaggerating
Oh my!!! I wish this is true and I'll be able to afford it.😊hmmmm wow
Not since WWII have the Japanese provided a more compelling case to drop bombs in their harbor.
Wait if she doesn't want him seeing her shit, how is he going to replace it?
Hogwarts is great and so are Japanese toilets. I can see what Matt and trey have been doing since episode 2 lol
i dont mind the seat warmer but i never bothered to try the other features when i was on vacation.
This episode was shit
Toilet paper gives you piles.  Of course the Japanese would find a simple solution. 🙄
Most Searched Google Term: Japanese Toilet
I bought a bidet early last year and I will never go back to cleaning myself with toilet paper.
The classic puppy dog sale . Never fails. Let the customer hold, feel, and try. Then they buy.  Oh, back to South Park. Love it.
I had the same reaction when I saw and try the first japanese toilet.
I love this show and how it manages to stay so funny after all these years
Holy Gods, Batmen... Trey & Matt, y'all are Absolutely Positively the Most Important People on the Planet, in relation to Anything television, Especially right Now. Y'all are gods among Us.  #ForeverFan #KeepOnTellinTruth #SouthParkforPresident
He's playing Hogwarts Legacy!
I can't stand a bidet. Give me soft toilet paper
Poor Ole Blue!
He drops his pants before he gets to the Toilet , almost like he's challenging it .
Happy belated birthday RANDY!!
some amercain toilets have that but i still stick to flushable wipes
Can't wait for someone who's seen this to go to Japan, fully expecting to see this futuristic toilet, and ending up in an old-school bathroom with a squat toilet.
Watching this while I am on toilet. 😂 No Japanese unfortunately 😟
whatever man , take a shit or get off the pot already
W Bidet
Best advertising for a Japanese toilet ever
Nothing beats Al Bundy 's mighty Furgeson however.
The toilet looks like a scene in dead space
"I kinda had a big breakfast".
Even their toilets are advanced and futuristic. That’s Japan for you.
We have come a long way since Roman times where they had a whole room for people to crap together and used a public sponge on a stick in a bucket of water to wipe.
Once you try a bidet, you never go back, you'll think of yourself as a dirty caveman.
It's all lies. Where is the compressor to pump the water higher than line pressure? I know how pressure washers work. They need a compressor. You're not fooling me.  I'd NEVER get clean with line pressure. I almost require sand blasting. The japanese don't understand.
Let us just agree that South Park is the greatest show ever….
God damn tegridy...
What's the song the toilet plays
Bidets need to be uniform all over the world. Toilet paper never makes you feel clean
They will change your Life.
Old blue kills me lol
I kinda had a big breakfast....
Wow this is great !!
Imagine Cartman saying: "What do you call a gay frag gernade?" Kyle:"what"Cartman:"A Fraggot"
I need another south park game.
I don't like how South Park has been censored... bleeping out the F word  Time to quit after this series
Watching this as I’m taking a shit
But what about all those hardworking American Toilets put out of work by the Japanese Toilets "They terk our jerbs."
During the toliet paper apocalypse i can confirm in Japan we were fine.. ;) 🤣
Always wanna say the biggest L joke (ww2) about the Japanese cuz literally they make so much cool stuff technology wise, and anime like bruh
The first time I used a Japanese toilet I was hooked too. I sat there for 30 mins with water rushing up my ass contemplating life, knowing this is the moment I've finally peaked in life. I couldn't wait to walk out upon the world with my shiny new asshole! Truly a liberating experience!
3:12 For serious 😂,  I can't get the Japanese toilet song out of my head. ❤❤❤
Once you go to a bidet with warm water, heated seat, and blow dryer you will never go back. Worth every penny
0:42 Hahaha Marriage
Btw: they really do open lid,  warm seat, wash and dry you. Source: I have one.
Wipes work better than all bidets.
I bought a bidet right before the pandemic at Costco.  Best decision ever!  And it’s true it helps a lot with hemorrhoids lol.  The only con is having to take a shit in a public bathroom 😂
Nice.
ランディは地質学者に戻ったんじゃないの？
Did he end up with a shitty deal on it???
i sure do love the japanese toilets. lived in japan for 6 years and i can affirm. comes with a seat warmer and a water squirt system.
can confirm. Everything depicted about japanese toilet in this clip is 100% true.  In fact, they didn't even talk about the blow dryer function.
I figured Randy would’ve dropped a deuce in one.
be lucky to get a bottle of baijiu and a straw for a chinese toilet ...
I'd trade Sharon for a japanese toilet and yes I'll have the champagne.
Indonesia toilets just give you your own personal hose, to well, you guessed it…hose down your own ass
South Park is a luxury toilet in these shitty times.
Since I was a kid, I've been washing my ass out with the shower head after every deuce because toilet paper just smears the doo doo all around.
All toilets in my home are these types and I swear you use it once you will get addicted to it 😂lots of premium malls using these toilets as well
I need that music.
The majority of toilets in Japan are apparently squat toilets, not sit-down. But I suppose the point of calling it a "Japanese" toilet is to dazzle the customer with with something exotic and high-tech sounding with no regard to the original culture it's from. So either way, South Park nailed corporate bullshit advertising.
What a f..f…fffaaa…f…ffaaaantastic episode :)
I have been to Japan and I can confirm Japanese toilets are an experience in itself that you must try.
Man I really thought stan's ✨ZiZ✨ said "GrOuSs DaD" lol
I did six years in Japan and the toilets were certainly nice. Which I'd nice since your gonna need them for all that yummy Japanese food.
South Park: "We're not just childish toilet humor"  *Also South Park*:
😄 Randy is my favorite, I love the episodes with him.
This clip was better than the other episodes this season
Not gonna lie I kinda want one now southpark sorta sold me in having my ass blasted with water
I met Japanese toilets 10 years ago. They are fantastic
Memberberry when Southpark portrayed randy face effing a bat?🤣🤷‍♂️🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Watch the all-new "Japanese Toilet" full episode for free now: https://cart.mn/toilet
"It is an honor to accept your waste."
Randy is awesome 😂😂😂
I could never use one of those things just too strange
Ok, but what if you have those kinda poops where it's like peanut butter, and you gotta DIG in there from 15 different angles until there's nothing left on the paper? Can these clean you better in those situations too?
imagine using toilet paper to clean your bum... disgusting habbit....... water for ass cleaning 4 life
I thought they moved off the farm 😊
Onii-san no daiben ga sugoi desu! Omedetou gozaimasu! Mata ashita desune!
Randy Marsh is the best damn character
I hope this Japanese Toilet thing somehow involves Clyde in the end. Maybe also Bono, since it's got Randy doing Number 2 again.
Didn't Randy return to his old job in Streaming War?
The toilet singing "FIRE" was the funniest shit to me 😹
Touch screen?  Pa-lease. Hey Siri, clean my bum.
Sold!
I would do the same as Randy ！
$7500usd I think they are?
And the Chinese are still using squat toilet holes.
https://youtu.be/ekm9q2dvk6k
Even Randy's playing Hogwarts Legacy!!🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/wRnhNkDbwKE
I would think Matt and Trey were taking the piss about some of the features of these toilets if I hadn't seen these in real life while servicing mansions.
Why is it as soon as I tapped on this I have to shit
Then there’s me sitting on the toilet watching this knowing in a couple minutes I’ll be smearing shit in between my buns with toilet paper 😂 makes me want to buy one better than any commercial ever would.
the funny part is, in america these are luxury items, in japan....these are standard lol
The Simpsons did it
You know Matt and Trey are playing the shit out of Hogwarts right now
0:53 so when she does it it’s eww but when randy does it he’s impressed?
you know i used to work at a home depot, I had to share this with the guys hahaha
the only thing that doesnt add up in this scene is that randy puts back the champagne instead of chugging it. anyways this made me laugh so yeah good stuff
What season and episode is this?
Japanese toilet rules!
Looooooove my bidet. I actually hate using TP now. They’re life changing. Lmao
The kind of porn that Randy watches, he has seen a japanese toilet before
I love how he took his pants down at the door and waddled over to the toilet
G1 you forgot the part it takes your urine data and DNA then, uploads it to the open source, I start pee results, dammit I'm high! Failed test again instant results. Disease your memory is then downloaded
3:36 LMAO
10 hours ago
you guys are the best ! ;')
Great episode!
I've never used a Japanese toilet, I'm poor.
It looks like it beats an East Indian toilet.
What happens if the power goes out? Do you use paper towels
What's the song?
Happy 2023.
this was me when i went to see the japanese toilets too!
The most unbelievable part of this was Randy being able to find an employee to help him in Home Depot😂
As a Japanese, I found it so funny
Randy's voice sounds more deeper than the old Randy
So incredibly accurate.  First time you're on a heated toilet seat bidet you're like "WHOOAHH!!!", then you're like "Whoooaaaa...", then you buy a bidet seat for every toilet in your house.  日本のトイレ indeed.  (Also: "TootToot" vs "Toto" LOL)  Just realized this episode will probably do more to increase the use of bidet seats in the U.S. than anything else.
I am literally taking a shit at the moment and I want to Japanese toilet now fk I’m to poor
You can buy a bidet attachment for $25...they work too.
I went to Tokyo and seen how great the toilets are there. I come back to the USA and felt bad using the USA toilets again. We are missing out!
the toilet paper lobby is going to get you for this clip
The nozzle is on point be careful the water will go through your large intestines 😂
Does this actually exist? Someday, in a home depot, there will be a secret room for all the toilets. Top luxury and with guards to prevent shoplifting as stores are being shut down all over the place because of this? That surely will make Japanese brands dominate western brands in the next years to come.
i wanted keep seeing the rest of the show wtf! lol... "I did have a big breakfast this morning"
I didn't expect this episode to have me in suspense, is the best episode of this and the last season together, and one of the best modern South Park episodes.
The song playing everytime someone uses it in the episode makes me giggle.
Bought a bidet during the Great Toilet Paper Wars of 2020 and I am never going back to wiping!!!!
I take a reliable 2 shits per day. Both at home. Once before showering of a morning and the second before showering of a night. I stick that thing on the mist setting and think of the green fields of England. Wonderful
Did the old "Randy" voice actor get fired or something? That's not the Randy voice I remember.
I wanted to hear hot, hot. Rare miss guys
Poor ol' blue seen some shit.
The more South Park goes on the less I like Sharon
the JT is life changing experience
I love that music playing whenever someone uses the toilet. And I love how Randy took his pants off BEFORE he reached the toilet. That awkward walk. LMFAO Nobody does toilet humor better than South Park.
I want one of those…
So, Ludwig has been Randy this whole time?
i can confirm this is true its like sitting on heaven
This episode Aired on his birthday
I've just come back from Japan and Taiwan, and I can confirm that in both Taiwan and Japan, toilets are like this.
As a person who's been to Japan multiple times, I can say that Japanese toilets are the best thing Japan has invented. My grandma even has a Toto washlet in her house. It's actually pretty hard to find a regular toilet in Japan that isn't a Toto washlet. The Toto washlet is actually pretty good especially for women during that time of the month. There's a setting called bidet that sprays water down there and cleans your butt hole and the lady hole (LMAO 😂😏)
Andrew Tate in south park
lol mom took a poo 💩
So I had an experience with a bidet.  First off I don’t like things going inside my ass. Not even an eco friendly toilet. The button that shoots the water is basically a consent button.  Secondly it didn’t get everything.  So in short I got a bad touch experience with a toilet and it didn’t get everything. I’m pretty pissed off about that. I’ll stick to killing the earth to wipe myself.
Excellent depiction of marriage
Only a madman like Randy would drop trouse at the door and then waddle over to the toilet with his junk out
This is exactly how my buddy explains his bidet is lol.
I came across a smart toilet in Japanese airport last month. Can confirm 1000% accurate
He was not dressed appropriately to even see the Japanese toilets, yet they let him in.  That is Home Depot taking care of the customer I tell you.
Was that the longest bathroom humor joke in history?
Hey boys aka guys.....
Oh, great, we're back to tegridy randy rather than geologist randy.
3:38 😂
This episode was hilarious 😂 South Park is one of my favourite shows. So many episodes have made me laugh. Still to this day it is still so funny 😂
Absolutely genius.. can you imagine if Randy Marsh took the world's biggest crap in that toilet
3:14 - 3:35 I love the music that plays as he’s in the washroom, it’s such nice music 😂😂
Once you go bidet, you never go back. Definition of a game-changer.
America, as Plumber this is true about the Japanese toilets.  I've installed them and all they have to do is talk. But they are pricey.  If your in the Phoenix, Tucson, and El Paso area give a comment if you need one installed.
I wonder how many prototype was made before the final product release. I guess there was bunch of failed attempts, and get a bunch of caca onto your face on each testing sequence. Now it is completed and the horrible day that they had to endure was over.
I have one. Once I told friends that my toilet not only sprays hot water, but also blow dries your behind at the end. They laughed thinking it was another one of my jokes.
I bought the season but why do I have to wait two days to watch it?
I could never figure out why Japanese toilets had a fake flush sound effect. Then one day, I figured it out.  I was in Sendai for a friend's wedding. The hotel's complementary breakfast was terrible, but hey, it was free, right?  After breakfast I went on foot to find the chapel. But there in the residential neighborhood, the rumblies began.  I had been to Japan before, and I knew that 100 yards in any direction would land me in a Lawson, Family Mart, or 7-11 convenience store. With mild panic in my eyes, I found the nearest Family Mart.  This detail sounds made up, but my friends, as I live and breathe, the music playing in the Family Mart was American bluegrass. I can't explain it. I've never seen it before or since, but there it was.  To my horror, I discovered that the Men's room in the Family Mart was occupied. Despite my urgency, I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  As my desperation mounted, a dangerous thought formed in my mind. I had been in the store for several minutes. I had seen multiple women enter and exit the women's room. I knew it was empty.  Yes, friends, I did it. I used the ladies room. I had it to myself--no one was going to be scandalized by my presence. And if I were careful, no one would need to know that In had committed this grave sin.  And the toilet was glorious! All the bells and whistles. It looked like the throne Randy test-drives in this clip, up to and including the NASA control panel mounted on the wall.  But there was a problem. I was taking too long. Someone--presumably the manager--was knocking on the door asking who was inside.  Now I have a dilemma. If I remain silent, the manager might conclude that the door locked by accident and open it from the outside with a key or something. But I can't answer "occupied" -- my voice is recognizably masculine. Worse, my accent is recognizably American.   As a sunglasses-wearing American, I'm already suspected of being a drug-dealing degenerate. Hanging out in the women's restroom would only confirm their suspicions.  But that's when I remembered the control panel.  With the push of a button, the porcelain throne's electronics loudly asserted my presence without identifying me as the white-skinned degenerate that I am.  It occurred to me in that moment that that feature may well have been devised for precisely the application for which I was then employing it.  And if you run a Family Mart in Sendai, Japan, I'm sorry. And I like your taste in music.
As Japanese, it was not very South Parkish in the beginning, but the pitch point was so funny!😂
This is 100% true.....
Poor episode I'm afraid, big backwards step in this season
its okay he's Lorde so he can afford it.
Bidets are better than bum guns
If I ever used a Japanese toliet, I would never use an American toilet ever again.
You get no tegridy
Lmao 🤣 🤣 I love this show 🤣
Life behind the velvet rope🤣
i wish i was tge toilet
he is so hot and hot and if u see me with him dont call the police our age gap is perfectly normal
It’s a satire on Innovation vs Tradition. When people try new stuff, they tend to behave like what Randy did, smug jerks. The ending of the episode shows that Big Businesses like Oil & Gas Companies will take necessary measures to cockblock the competition, even if it harms the consumers as long as profits are made.
the 'Youre mad' bit had me.. so sublte. and why does Randy walk all the way to the toilet with his pants down! amazing touch!!
That random new age music in the background while Randy shits in the Japanese toilet is just hilarious 😂
Hilarious episode!!
I have a Japanese friend who came to America for an exchange program.  At 19 was when he first experienced a cold toilet seat and probably had to wipe.
This episode ended abruptly.... 🤔
Should of bought himself a blue one, to honor Ol' blue. 🤣
Haneda Airport toilets, love at first crap.
This episode made me buy a handheld Bidet to see how it is. 🤣
This shit is fucking right on point considering the fact that I am seated on one right now.... 😂😂😁😁 Just amazing how these guys make it flawlessly funny 😅
Ayo, can you imagine Sony being like this upon selling everyone a PlayStation 5 console for a reasonable low price? Like they just woke up one morning and said, we are about to end Microsoft's career.
Randy's back
Moment of silence for old blue
December 18 is my birthday Lol
Why isn’t this episode on HBO MAX yet????????
Bruhh every time that peaceful "you're in paradise" song started playing I lost it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So I bought a second home in Italy and have been renovating it over the last few months then watched this episode and instantly called my 59 year old female Italian decorator who barely speaks English tried to describe what I wanted and she responded with  "Japanese toilet"
Been washing my ass since i was a kid and only now the west has seen the light
Sure randy.....go compress that vaccuum...in space.....until it gets even more black....then flush.
EPIC~
Americans always behind in everything lately. We aren't the best at anything anymore.
It's kind of funny when America is so technically advanced but people still uses wipes to clean themselves.
F ck how much was the toilet  🚽
Funny but boring. Watched it twice still boring. That said happy I didnt hear the word Tegridy all epsiode. Wanted to see an episode on the recent Davos event or the Oakville teacher with the huge fake tits.
I hope they say something about the lawsuit in the next episode.
Bring back chef!
Whats the point though? I look foreward to the adrenaline rush of plopping down on a frozen seat
Mrs.Mustad (yes,THAT family) told me they had this type of toilet in Scandinavia 140 years ago! (minus the bluetooth, of course).
They terk Blue’s jerb!
This is pretty accurate. Crazy how in Japan it is this toilet or a small hole in the floor.
Anyone know what the song is called?
Why is this not on HBO max. Why are they bouncing around and making people pay more
It is my dream to try one someday.😂😂😂👌🏼
Now south Park gonna get Sued by Trans Activists for saying Hogwarts Legacy 😂
I used a Toto in Sapporo that had temperature choice for the water, a choice of sounds like birds chirping or forest, seat warmer, adjustable spray settings and more. Truly magic
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is she using the guest toilet anyway?
Literally how my family got started with bidets
10k
Looks gay
ask yourself do you really think you clean your ass better with paper or water ? lived in japan for 10 years, there is nothing better than a toilet in japan.
I went to japan once and tried that toilet, afterwards i just realized that we live like cavemen here in the west
Leave it to South Park to make an episode about Japanese toilets...and make me want one...
Randy doesn't need a new toilet; he needs a new wife.
poor ole blu 😂
Anyone notice Randy is a lot more tolerable now compared to before?
the japanese are fr living in 2045
It’s all true, one department store I went into had the self opening toilet. Open the door to enter the small room and the seat popped up like “hey how’s it going”
Hey guys, your mom took a shit and she doesn't want anyone to see it 🤣🤣🤣
Will there be a part 2 to this?
This has sparked my curiosity to learn more about toilets and fixing appliances. I like to fix things so this is interesting to me. Great episode.
This episode makes me want to get a Japanese toilet, expensive kind, I want to destroy my current toilet and s*** in the hole.
Better then the German toilets that have a display tray.
This may have just sold ME a toilet.
hey guys! ur mom took a shit and doesnt want me to see it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*"You're my bowl, Blue!"* _-- Frank the Tank_
Sad truth, but that auto toilet-san is the best.
I feel like this is the evolution towards the three seashells used in the movie "Demolition Man".
I have one. Could never go back to paper.
God damn it, I thought we were done with the Tegridy shit?
White people discovering that water actually washes you better than a piece of tissue lmao
When will it be on hbo?
Imagine if Japanese toilets became a thing in the USA, no matter which house you go to in the USA you would see one there. Same goes with Canada.
This is the way
hahaha the music. Powerful and sensual hahaha
American discovering washing butt with water is a thing
Fairy Guys? But there isn’t any-Oh Randy your a real piece of crap. Big Gay Al is a saint.
Ngl as an American who's never used a bidet this makes me want to try a Japanese toilet!
“Hey guys! Your mom took a shit and she doesn’t want me to see it!” “EWW” I laughed too hard
Thank god, Randy didn't say "Huhuthuthuthuut!". He would mess up the beautiful toilet so bad.. y'all know what i mean😂
can confirm i am not poor and have 3 bidets in the house
Banned by the Catholic Church. So go get one!
Fairy guys?
Randy is literally the laziest father on the show. All he does is sit on that couch and play his video games.
So, we’re just stuck with Tegridy Farms for the rest of the show now? Great…
How rude can Jimmy valmer be real or extremely
Water can get recycled and doesn't clog your toilet, Trees take years to grow and cant exactly recycle paper with crap smeared on it. You don't really need a specific japanese toilet, a simple bidet hose will do the job.
What was randy playing?
10k on a toilet is crazy
i bought 2 of them
i just recently discovered bidets no thanks to American society as it seams they don't want you to know about them.i guess that is becuse it would impact toilet tissue sales.
As soon as I saw Randy I knew the episode was going to be awesome... and it was.😁
Wait  he moved  back  to  the  farm
I need the soundtrack...
WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH ALL THE VOICES!? Dit they forgot how to do them or something? It´s so distracting and anoying.. also way to fancy animation now they gotta get back to their roots
Thanks you South Park… now I want one
Anyone know the song lmao
Last year I tried it for the first time at a hotel I was staying at and when I turned in the water I jumped when it sprayed me lol
Hmmm. Is it funny that I now want a Japanese toilet? Lol
Randy is the sh*t! Lol!!!🤣🤣🤣
First episode in a long time without Token being forced into the story. Thank you for making a funny show again, instead of pandering to the racist woke mob.
Idk
The tune when he uses the toilet makes me piss 😂
I'm not poor
I really hope South Park will make a Andrew Tate reference in the future
This is a magical moment.
Let me guess, he switched back because of hemp toilet paper.
Poor toilet :(
So South Park does Japanese propaganda now? What's next, saying the whales and dolphins raped Nanking? I tried one of those torture devices when I visited the cursed isle of Japan and I felt violated. The Eternal Nip and his mischievous trickery must never be underestimated.
I like how they had to add Randy farting… and going “ohh, ohh”. Classic Randy
what in the hell was that episode? Sorry South Park, this episode was definitely a miss. It felt unfinished and uneven. Not to mention why is Randy suddenly back at Tegridy Farms didn't he move back to South Park? He didn't have his Tedgridy outfit on last episode?... Hoping next week yall will put out another banger like The Worldwide Privacy Tour.
Told my friends about it, but no one wants to listen....... South Park listens.  Needed one after my motorcycle wreck....I can't go back now.
So Randy is back in Tegredy making the We miss Randy song pointless. I like it . I thought he was better suited to be a pot farmer than a geologist. And C'mon, was Randy really that different before the whole Tegredy thing. Streaming Wars part 2 did have a lot of problems
I’m using mine as I watch this clip
0:50 😂 only Marsh
I thought randy was going back to his geology job. Oh well
Lol, South Park just increased bidet sales by 80%.
Damn toilet has more technology in it than my whole damn house!
Oh ooowah
Happy birthday Randy.
Your supposed to use the toilet as a desk.
XDDDDDDDDDD
I can confirm the toilets in japan do everything this shows the music the seat warmer opening when you enter the room the music. They even have a self clean option for the bowl it’s wild -A man in japan
Its insanity to me that america doesn't use bidets
Japan makes things better, now America just a joke.
I just tried one for the first time a few weeks ago... my god, so good
"Come on in, try having water squirted at you from **inside** the toilet bowl!  That's right, it IS in there where you've just been emptying yourself!   Don't think about it."
This is TOILET HUMOR!
Don't squeeze the Charmin
Everybody buy a $30 bidet attachment for their toilet seat. Game changer for sure.
Ive used these toilets in Japan 2 months ago. Best toilets in the world by far!
I hate Randy so much
Old blue🤣🤣🤣
Anyone got a link to the music that plays on the toilet?
If you guys & girls haven't seen it, I highly reccomend Thermae Roma - all bathhouses lead to rome.
Pretty sure japanese toilet sales will be going up after this, is anyone doing research already? Omigo seems like a good option without needing a whole new toilet.
Can we just appreciate that, despite the fact it will internationally be available for free to watch online this sunday and that you have been releasing your episodes for free since such a long time, you still bother to officially air an almost 4-min clip/teaser before most of the world has seen the episode, anyway? Matt, Trey, you guys have always been treasures to the world of comedy entertainment, animation and television. You're truly a gift to mankind and I'm glad that I've been able to witness your work since... forever! You guys absolutely never fail to bring a smile to my face. You're awesome, kewl and totally not fat!
As someone who lives in Japan, everything he is saying about what Japanese toilets come equipped with is true. They also have options such as the sounds of nature to drown out the sounds of you taking a poo. They also have a special gas they release from the bowl with covers the smell as well. And yes, they DO clean you way better than toilet paper. I haven't had to use toilet paper in 6 years.
Wait i thought Randy gave up Tegridy Farms in The Streaming Wars?
I know this is a stupid question but how the hell do you actually watch these episodes in Canada? Paramount + doesn't have new episodes. Looked on Fubo TV. Nothing. Tried going getting the Comedy Central app. Region locked. Tried watching on the South Park website. Region locked. Tells us to go to Paramount+ where they don't offer season 26. I'm genuinely confused...
I lived in Japan for 2 years and this is 100% accurate. They are a thing of beauty!
This is even an understatement to what Japanese toilets do. All these features (except internet connectivity) were around 15 years ago or more.
I am watching SP again after a 10 year TV break.
it cost 10k
4 minute clip? thats almost like 1/4 of an episode...
Wait a minute... the bidet is for cleaning... i thought it was like a water fountain for taking a drink after your pooh.
RANDY MARSH:: Hey Guys, Your Mom Took A 💩 & Doesn't Want Me To See It
I wonder where this episode is gonna go... Probably something evil about these toilets...
Nice, I’ll probably sit on my toilet today soon too, mines neat though because I have a pirate ship with cannons and a Death Star in mine, it’s neat what you can do to protect yourself against 2D aliens when your 3D
🤣
As a Muslim, I'm happy South Park confirmed what I already knew ☺
Not very funny
HAHAHAHA
When the music started playing when he entered the bathroom I really LOL 😂 😂😂 FN Randy
wow
They got it wrong. Japanese toilets make a sound so that nobody hears you talking a shit. 🙄
I really miss japanese toilets. Wanna have one at home.
God damnit now I want one
2:46 - 3:08 that new japanese south remix with the old south park Soundtrack is beautiful.
It's funny to read all the people that have to buy a bidet because it's not standard in their country XD
Witch episode is this
Not gonna lie, I went to the lowes website after watching this and the Toto model does look nice as hell! Someday I might step my toilet game up!
I didn't want to laugh that much about shitting. However, i did.
I remember when Randy wasn’t a main character. How he has developed over the years.
I HAVE to try those things.
I’m watching while on the toilet
That employee knew exactly what he was doing. Saying oh I don't think you want to spend that much money, he knew that Randy saw that as a challenge to as wealth
Watching this on the can and I'm feeling toilet envy
If you have to ask how much fuck it you can't afford it. Break out the Wells Fargo credit card it's about to hit its maximum plus
This is an insanely accurate depiction of how my Father feels about his fancy toilet.  😂
The Japanese toilet’s welcome music would make for a great alarm or ringtone.
Can we get the old Randy 😢
Simpsons Did It.
I was in Japan only long enough to catch a connecting flight, But this is a pretty accurate depiction of the toilets at the airport terminal.
Glad South Park getting back into straight up toilet humor.
Never even seen a Japanese toilet irl let alone used one
It’s the 21st century and we still need to wipe our own buttholes, come on people!
I accidentally bought the German toilet. It throws the poop on you
Kinda weird that the restroom is not completely covered in shit considering Randy's history with taking dumps.
Randy has convinced me not to buy one.
I love how this video ends
Uhhhh I thought Randy was done with Teggridy Farm last season?
Oh boy, can’t wait for the lovely people of Twitter to find a way to cancel South Park for Randy playing hogwarts legacy 🤣
"im not poor"
But you still need to dry your ass with toilet paper don't you?
Shit, not another Tegridy episode.
I feel like earlier seasons of South Park would have had the boys actually go to P&G or one of the other companies. It's a little depressing that even in the fiction, people just give up.
Well I'm not poor lol
"Do you want to take one for a test drive?" LMFAO!
I want one!
From someone who was stationed and lived off base on the island of Okinawa from 2010-2017 I can confirm that these toilets are fucking dope.
Randy 'Lorde-Bane-Tegridy-Senpai' Marsh
I am a Japanese who living in the US. The most uncomfortable thing of the public restroom in the US is that everyone can see my feet…   Why is it designed like this?
I literally thought South Park was done with Tegridy Farms Especially after the streaming Wars and how Randy was getting everything from it
im sry but i hate water on my ass when i take a dumb
South Park should be free as a public service 😎
That episode was so beautiful in it's concept of capitalist conspiracies, We made a video dedicated to it. We swear.
I want their toilets even more now.
Big TP is why I always use a little toilet paper after using my Japanese toilet. They’re always watching….
I wash my ass in the shower after every poop I ain't no savage.....
I have installed a few of these for disabled people and the ones we fitted were £6k each or $7k for the toilet alone
*Oh yeah*
I hope all those pandemic 🧻 toilet paper hoarders see this and upgrade!! 💩💩💩🚽🚽🚽
Randy and Sharon's relationship is incredibly toxic
I have been to Japan and this is funny because it’s TRUE … they are so beautiful
Some people just won't understand the relationship we have with our Toilets.
Shut up and take my money!
Of course Randy fell in love with a Japanese toilet 😂 Japan is making their toilets even better!
"ohh i Japanese i just had a bad and I think I'm gonna kill myself"😂😂
WE LOVE THIS BRO
The way the Piano key shifts and Randy says "your mad?!" Is my favorite part
I Had a Strange Nightmare About Quagmire Toilets Were Everywhere In The Stores And I Just Don't Feel So Safe In This World Anymore! 😰
😂
Old blue lololol
A bidet is a game changer. I haven't wiped my ass in years. I recommend the Bio Bidet BB-2000. BidetKing is a good place to check out bidets. Cheers
Ngl this episode sucked ass
Reminds me of the We Bare Bears episode where Ice Bear has a secret Japanese style toilet hidden down a manhole and a set of ladders, but that didn't turn out too well lol. Hopefully Randy's fancy toilet won't go er ape s*** on him and try and devour him or take over his Tegridy business or anything!  I'd love to see a Joe Biden episode, perhaps they could link it to this one and call it Joe Bidet.
Butters admitted he sits on the toilet the other way round because it has a little shelf for him to read his comic on & place  his milk on🤣🤣
Yeah ok, but the Ferguson is still better!
i get the jist of a bidet, but still, how? water up the butt, yes, but what then? do you just trust that the water got you clean, and stand up with a wet crack, and go on with your day? do you have to towel yourself, if so, why not just use toilet paper? whats the itching situation as the day progresses? is there one that can laser your a--hair off? asking for a friend. close friends. dont worry about it. were just roommates.
This is not an exaggeration.. even the public toilets at the freaking airport are like this
And the best part is Randy’s reaction matches most people’s first time with these toilets too.
I'm over hear trying to learn Japanese toilet language
I want a fancy Japanese toilet 😭
These new episodes feel like the golden era ones! Randy isn’t a complete and constantly high madman anymore, now he’s the randy we love who happens to own a weed farm!
I wouldn't care too much about the bells and whistles, but a toilet that could take biometric data from your waste, and from that determine if there are any early indicators of health problems, might sell me on the concept.
where can a "friend" find the song with no fart noise? :DD
Sharon needs to fix her own broken toilet.
not sure how to feel about this episode, had a bad ending
I miss Japanese toilets.
100% worth the money. I wouldn’t put it in the guest bathroom though. Guests can smear their buttholes with shiz and paper just like everyone else.
5% off toilets 😂
I thought randy destroyed Tetridy Farms?
Wait I thought Randy was back to being old Randy
私はそれを感じる 私はそれを感じる 私はそれを感じる 私は何をすべきか知っています うんこしようとするとき トイレに行って下着を脱ぐ そして私は座って待っています 座って待つ うんちが落ちるまで座って待つ 拭いて拭いて 紅葉の街へ トイレに入れて流す バイバイうんち！ バイバイうんち！ パンツを持ち上げるとき 手を洗う 手を洗ってトイレダンス！ やったよ！
The only reason I want to visit Japan: Japanese Toilets
The ultimate toilet no butt wipe required 🤣
Having a bidet this is what it feels like coming home when I've used public toilets at work. People, bidets are usually only 20-30 dollars and are definitely worth it!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YiwSsMwdvI
What did you all think of the new episode personally I thought it was ok
aw man so were not done with tegrity? i thought randy went back to being a geologist after the streaming wars?
What does the Japanese actually say?
I feel like this may be another plot by the Japanese to avenge their defeat at the hands of the Americans. You know, kinda like Chinpokomons were
I can’t believe SouthPark just sold me a tune off a Japanese toilet skit..
In this case it would be Cartman drean to have a Japanese toilet.
Top-of-the-range Japanese models can cost upwards of $33,000
First red dead redemption and now hogwarts legacy. Never knew Randy’s a man of culture.
No one is talking about the hogwarts legacy reference. Jk rolling is gonna loose her flu powder..
About right. The first time you feel that blast hit you, it’s surprising and unexpected yet tantalizing.
Ah yes, southpark refferencing games everyone plays
Moving back from Japan i really do miss how these toilets were every where.
Randy "I will take 4 of them", salesman "may you live to be a thousand years old."
What game is he playing?
2014 was the first time I use a Japanese toilet and it was heaven on my bottom. I usually soak a little toilet paper in the water before I wipe my ass but with the Japanese toilet that’s pretty much already done for me.
Ludwig would love this hahah
Now I want a toilet that plays Days of Blues - Sons of Maria
that's a nifty bidet
Meanwhile most Americans,  are shamefully walking around dirty buttholes.
Finally someone took on toiletpaper bs, I fought with dense mofo's about this a dozen times in the last 20 years, "eww you don't use toilet paper"  putting down people from all around the world that use water because TP is somehow magical. First thing people went for during the pandemic,  brainwashed toilet paper slaves
But what happens if Randy gets constipated again? Can the Japanese toilet handle firepower of that magnitude?
A shower does the same job though 🤣
I couldn't use that nothing tickles my butt
I remember the first time I tried a Japanese toilet. I’m a different man now.
One of the few things I want to try when I do go to Japan.
Even I'm not that involved in Hogwarts Magic. I haven't played in almost two weeks. However, finally beat Minish Cap of LOZ.
People that buy these should be terminated
3:34 Randy discovers a new world.
🤣🤣
Was he running the bidet while pooping ?
People say Randy was ruined by Tegridy farms but this episode was a goddamn banger back to front.   That ending was a Randy Marsh classic.
10iissh
I though randy quit his tegridy job
What ELSE have the Japanese been hiding from us? 🇯🇵
Show used to be so funny. What happened?
really weak episode, not funny at all
i have no experience with japanese toilet but isnt the japanese toilet the ultimate poseidons kiss experience. not just a spash but an ice cold beam of water straight into the asshole?
God fucking dammit DX I thought Tegridy was over!
i want one so bad they looks so cool
Y'all better have a diesel genny for your Nipponese crapper when the lights go out...otherwise you're up sh!t creek without a toilet roll...
I thought Randy went back to Geology.
From the sounds of it, that Japanese toilet is so effective it actually TURNS you Japanese.
I still do not get how bidets aren't common in America. They are amazing. My friend gave me two and I can't stand not using one anymore.
Baby wipes. Done.
I’m on one of the toilets right now lolo
Honestly never understood why the Japanese toilet hasn’t caught on in the west. Dry toilet roll does not clean you and feels grim anyway. It’s as useless as paper as the idea of it is on paper.
I know a buddy who's parents have a toilet like that...I used it one day and it heated my ass... had buttons for everything
Jimmy was right "Less than 30% of the world's population uses toilet paper. That leaves a whopping 4 billion people who don't. In some places, it's because of access"
Big Toilet Paper hates this episode
Is this episode going to be about PC Principal getting mad at Randy for playing Hogwarts Legacy since JK Rowling’s transphobic?
This is so fucking true it’s hilarious.
This reminds of a Tesla gallery
I would like to buy one but it would kill me inside if my mom was spending more time in there than usual
It’s 2023 and most of them don’t require cleaning the bowl as they are self cleaning models. Lid opening and music are kinda old, but thanks for the global attention on us Japanese
Sharon needs to smoke some weed gottdam
No lies detected. And some can play music, giving the impression that people on the outside can't hear you doing your business.
Oh wow...
Great episode, though I hated how Stan gets mock because Randy gloated, also Randy still doing weed business? What gives? I haven’t watched the whole Streaming Wars and only saw Randy going back as a geologist, are the creators making fun of us?  Also, this episode is also helpful. One: it mention about snowing and drought, which is a good thing that with so much snow could solve the problem of last year. Two: it made an impression about toilet papers and how much America uses, I may lived in Canada but it made me rethink to be careful about it.
There's a local spa and nail salon that has a Japanese toilet, I can confirm it is exactly like this. I am definitely getting one someday when I have more money
I'm not poor 🤣
Randy episodes are the pinnacle of South Park.
Anybody know the song when randy sits on the toilet?! It sounds like guts theme from berserk lmfao
Why does randy sound different????
I learned something today. You better give a shit, where you shit. Mr. Hankey approves of this message.
This is pure gold
Bidets are a cultural change for America I 100% endorse.
bidet's are kinda gay, but so is sticking ur hand into your ass so its really about whatever cleaner and quicker which is a bidet
Welp, how did you all enjoy the first half of the season?
LOOK AT THESE BOT COMMENTS! YIKES!
Wait I thought Randy went back to geology?
"Hey guys! Your mom took a sh*t and doesn't want me to see it!"
SOUTH PARK SOLD OUT! MATT & TRE WTF HAPPENED!
This video proves women take dumps, just like men
No way there playing Hogwarts Legacy in South Park omg that is Soo freaking awesome
Around 5k? 🤣 Got the urge to Google toilets now 🤣
It's true, Japanese toilets are amazing.🤣😂
SOUTH PARK IS TRASH NOW. THIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL IS TRASH! MATT & TRE SHOULD BE ASHAMED!
I was waiting for hot hot hot hot when he was taking the dump.
Dude, my first time in Japan, I was walking around Tokyo and really needed to go no. 2. I get in a bathroom and there's just a hole in the ground with little grate over it. When I think Japanese toilet, that's what I remember. Still have nightmares.
If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
Are Japanese toilets standing for electric cars in this episode? I feel like they're standing in for electric cars.
Worked at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. They installed bidets in all the bathrooms. Tested it to see how it works out of curiosity. The cylinder that came out that sprays the water was completely covered in 💩💩💩. I'll never use a bidet after seeing that
They're still living on the farm? I thought they moved back to south park.
But does it take pictures? And connect to the internet?
"I did kind of have a big breakfast" South Park is back baby!
Shitting is a holy sacrament & should be treated as such. Japan has always known this.
Great 👍 👌 show. I got to catch up 💯💯 banger 🔥 👌 🙌 no cap
Why is his voice so weird?
This is a really important cultural moment This will hopefully be an episode thats upstream of culture and finally normalizes the japanese toilet in the west We live like animals and dont have to
So Randy is playing Hogwarts Legacy? cause he is getting harrassed and bullied online now, how dare he play that game.
Hehe he was playing Hogwarts Legacy I bet
Home Depot’s selling Japanese toilets now?
can u stop with the randy episodes
미국은 비데 별로 안쓰나
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’ve already heard about Japanese toilets before, but South Park just fans my flames of curiosity even more. Definitely on my bucket list!
I knew from the moment he stepped out from the room, he was going to say " how much ". Randy never cease to amazed.
Japanese toilet is amazing
Water > Toilet paper
Damn. I didn't realize the plaid shirt. It slaps
This was a great episode.  Really points up how rich people will just waste money on ridiculous stuff.  But isn't that all there is to do when you're rich?  It's a toilet, for god's sake not a religion.
blahaawhahwliawha
I miss when toilets came in a variety of colors.
Episode was brilliant 👏
I thought Randy no longer sells weed.
Randy sounds different
Trey and Matt ALWAYS deliver quality content! LOL!!! Just hope Randy doesn't press the  "ATR" button lol.
Trash Taste is gonna love this.
Is this the new episode
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
No joke many people bought bidets when that whole toilet paper shortage happened at start of covid. Not surprised if they slowly get more and more popular
Wait this is a new episode? I thought Tegridy is gone, why are they still living on the farm?
lol
Why is this remind me Of Conan and Jordan schlansky 😂😂😂
Futurama's version of the Japanese toilets was better.   "I promise you happy poopy time"
I took a shit in Narita airport for  this.
This is the one thing I would miss the most if I ever left Japan and returned to the states. Nothing beats a nice clean spray afterwards.
Worth every dime.
Seeing the toilet paper roll dispense from the underside in the Marsh household really surprised me. I guess Randy has put all of his sensible dispensing energy into Tegrity instead.
I thought Sharon and Shelly died and tergidy farms storyline was over
Comments on here are comedy gold. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why does this make me think this is a spoof of the PS/PS5 Game "Detroit Become Human"
On my way to Home Depot...
i fucking love South Park 🤣
anyone else think this newest season has been kinda soulless?
I did try German toilet.. I liked it
I really need to try a Japanese toilet
I love it's treated like an executive luxury, haha.
We have Japanese public toilets in Singapore. And yes South Park portrays it accurately
Im sold. I want one now lol
Randy: 😨 your mad Me:😂😂
I love my bidet
Man i'm turning into Randy
Sharon’s reaction to keep the lid shut….I WANT PRIVACY I WANT PRIVACY I WANT PRIVACY 😂⚰️💀
Better than Margaritaville.
I lived in Japan. I used a toilet there  some time ago at a party that the water checks the PH levels in your poo. So basically, Its gives you a detailed idea of what vitamins you’re missing in your diet just by checking the ph levels of your stool. Yah, I know… unreal stuff
They really put a lot of detail into the home Depot set
Bidets are objectively awesome
Can't believe he played that wizard game smh
don't be embarrassed about the noise, you simply assert your dominance!
I’m lamenting the fact that Home Depot doesn’t actually have this department
The most real and actually helpful pro environment and pro health episode any show has done
Didn't Randy give up the whole weed thing after The Streaming Wars or was that not canon?
Does it come with an anime studios instruction video?
It always blows my mind that Yankees don't have the concept of videts.
This shows still on?
Are the Paramount specials not connected to the new season? I thought Randy went back to his normal life.
Alright. Now imagine having Hogwarts Legacy AND the Japanese toilet.   There, I said it. Never getting up again. lol
NEW SOUTH PARK EPISODE DROPPED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️‼️‼️💯💯💯💯
Randy just like me fr fr
If you use toilet paper instead of wet wipes or a bidet to wipe your ass ,you’re a savage
I like the ones where the wash table is right above the toilet reservoir to safe water.
Love it
I can only imagine his turd fell into the toilet like Sora sinking down in water during the opening of Kingdom Hearts.
As a Home Depot employee, we could use them
Hogwarts Legacy lmao
I once had a layover in Tokyo, and the first thing I was told to do was to take a shit and let me tell you that Japanese toilet made for one magical shit
Japanese toilets are the best.
How does porcelain go bad?
The scary thing is that this isn't that far away from how they actually are.
Quick question , is this a dig on tesla?
I thinked that the Marsh that come back at South Park
Surprised these haven't caught on yet in the US, the description isn't even an exageration
Tht like common in most asia countries
Hi
I really want to know how much it costs.
Ritz hotels got them
Poor old blue
For real, oriental (because you can find impeccable toilets in SK too) are marvellous.
I need a Jap toilet !
maybe they too are trash taste fans.
No joke, during the pandemic people here in Germany hoarded toilet paper so toilet paper was either sold out or rationed. With such a Japanese toilet, the problem would be solved.
If Nintendo made toilets their slogan could be Wii would like to poo.
Eight times better!
It’s true. The experience is phenomenal.
Randy playing HL gives me years of life ❤
😂
The only thing that has my attention is the fact they’re playing Hogwarts Legacy.
3:13 song please.
I always use wet baby wipes.never tiolet paper
Ok...how much?
Bob's Burgers did it.
The episode is rather dissapointing. Focussing on something this random instead of the lgbtqs and hogwarts legacy. Honestly very dissapointing
NGL I cried the first time I used a Japanese toilet. After 3 months my credit score jumped to 850, the following month I became partner at my law firm and after six months all the hair grew back on my head. Japanese toilets are a game changer. After a year I spontaneously developed a British accent and amazing physique. Because of Japanese toilets I sound like Jason Statham and look like a Greek statue.
Randy knows what a good toilet is. Don't forget he took a giant dump in one episode.
We love toilet paper, this is fine, DONT SQUEEZE THE CHARMIN.
Guess Randy went back to his High ways, I miss the Old Randy
They're still living on the weed farm, I thought Randy was done with being a weed farmer?
i love how south park make their episodes in a week, a celebrity could die and it'll be in the next south park episode
This entire episode genuinely opened my eyes to some stuff I had no idea about. Did some research and I can confirm it too. South Park has taught me so much about the world using satire and that's why I love it so much.
I would absolutely love one of these, one of the comedians I listen too recently got bought one for Christmas by one of his co-hosts... they look absolutely incredible!
I love Randy.
Weird how this is almost completely unexaggerated
This to me was a return to form, to me there’s kinda a difference from just doin a current event parody n making a statement about a global problem I really hadn’t laughed n had this much fun with a South Park episode in a long time cheer guys easily one of my fave episodes!
OK I LIKE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE…
I really don't know why Randy was back in Tegridy Farms? Am I missing something?
Randy is an absolute chameleon in satire for South Park. He's hilarious 😆
F'king Japanese.  😀
If I got this for my dad he wouldn't use it like he wouldn't use the Sensor Sink becuase of fears of Electric Shock, such an Old Person thing to say to stay in your time frame.
The James Blunt toilet.
I thought the Marshes moved out of Tegridy Farms and back to South Park. Stan was in his old room when Cartman came inside during Cupid Ye
Now I want to save up to buy a Japanese toilet for my half bathroom
Love the craping sounds.
That heated toilet seat is absolutely calling my name!
Wanna take it for a test drive?
Love the craving sounds.
Love how Randy shows Stan but doesnt let Stan play😭, the Hogwarts reference was really cool
I'm so happy South Park seems to be back doing random episodes about different situations instead of story driven seasons.
I see there is a message in this episode. And i get it.
The hilarious part is randy is just moaning in the room while the home depot worker just waits
If I didn't know for a fact that these things actually existed, I would think they were making this shit up.
I was hoping that Stan’s family would get back to living in town after the streaming wars. It’s weird to see him regress like this
So Stan is the richest in South Park now
Remember first time i tried this. My God i want one.. but it cost 4000$
Randy playing Harry Potter is hilarious!  Suck it you trans activist loons
So... is Randy aware that Harry Potter was written by a terf actually or does he just not care?
Wait I’m so damn confused   Didn’t randy go back to being a scientist after streaming wars?
I would kill a person to have Japanese toilets though I already have a bidet.
There really is no comparison if you've never experienced it. Itchy ass, skid marks, mud butt, dingleberrys, endless prairie doggin after that extra cheese pizza, they're all a thing of the distant past now. All relics of the before times for me.  Things are different now. Better. Fresher. Freer.
Should have used Gut's theme song while toilet use.
I really hate randy
here we go with the stupid Childish toliet humor Again 🙄😒
Shelly is becoming less and less aggressive with each passing episode
He still sells weed?
Aw man ive been trying to watch the episode but it doesnt show up on southpark studios :((
A clean ass is a happy ass. Whole!
Drawing from personal experience, I can confirm that this clip faithfully portrays a man's initial experience with a Japanese toilet.
toilet
I thought bidet's were from Europe?
And like that, a new market for HD was created.
Japan is awesome!
God damnit why can't they just stop with Tegridy Farms? It's so annoying
can't wait to see the full episode. South park rocks!
If there's one place in the house you spend a lot of money it has to be the bathroom
I’m still waiting for the 3 sea shells system!   If you know, you know…
Best episode of the season. This was gold.
He names his toilet old blue!! I can't with Randy bruh 😂
I passed thru the Japanese Airport last month and their toilets are top notch, just press the button and cleans you down there
: ● Translate from Japanese to English: " Super! Looks like Randy brand new toilet is a success! No more embarrassing situations and/ or stories about the toilet in Randys home between family and/or friends in the town of greater South Park.  Japanese toilet sends unpleasant smells and offensive material to a dark place full of shadows never to return even for one minute! Spring breeze freshness as far as the eye can see, over rooftops and even mountains! No limits anymore with bathroom satisfaction! 👍🏻
Japanese toilets really do be like that tho... in hotels...
i absolutely love how they go with the flow of time and putting actual stuff tha's relevant now in their episodes like hogwarts legacy i think when it comes to this soutpark is very unique
Pretty sure Christian Girls shouldn't use  these japanese toilets 😁♥️🇺🇸🇪🇺
The way of randy said your mom took a **** is so funny part
randy >>
A really nice one can reach over $8k
Anyone wanna know what song played during the part where randy uses the toilet?  Well here it is enjoy:  https://youtu.be/UePsEG_zQAE
How I love when you create this random mega lore about regular things 🤣🤣🤣🤣 BTW, the "Japanese toilets" that are more know as bidet seats, are the best 😉
WE need all of this lmao..
Having just got a bidet, this was hilarious and true. Switch to bidets ppl, the benefits are countless. Bidet bottles are $10 and worth every penny
サウスパークに日本が出てくるとすぐ嬉しくなっちゃう
I can't wait to watch this episode 😍 Zambia 🇿🇲 loves South Park
Hahaha 🤣
The toilet paper companies surely wont like this
Seriously though, America. Start using bidets! You gotta stop clogging your drains  with wet wipes. You’re supposed to throw them away anyway 🤣
#TeamRavenclaw
Your mad is a brilliant line
🕳  🤔💭 🧻 🚽
Wasn't that the same toilet from Bob's Burgers?
the Truth is the Mortals Hates Poop Only Immortals Eats Poop and Cement, I Wish God Create the First Immortal Person in the World
Stan's voice has deepened 😭. Is this a nice detail? Or something else?
I luv South Park!
Hogwarts Legacy is the worse game released these last 10 years. Poorly optimized on computer, full of dull content and a tr@nny character !
First, Red Dead Redemption and now everyone on South Park including Randy is playing Hogwarts Legacy. Never thought I’d hear this. Also, I wonder if stores like Home Depot are selling Japanese toilets.
still not on HBO max
little black floaty thingy
Huh. Now that I think about it, no toilet paper makes sense. Japan's a (relatively) small country with not a lot of space for trees to be made into paper. Using water instead and just investing more in water treatment seems like a clever solution.
I bought a bidet seat at the beginning of covid, and it's pretty damn great. It has a heated seat, heated water, varying sprays, and a dryer. It's pretty damn great.
Showing his kids Hogwarts Legacy and not letting them play...now that's evil
I loved that this was a stan and randy episode one of my favourite characters lol 🔥🔥🔥
Did Randy find the toilets or was it one of the Producers.?.
Hi Stan
Lmfao wtf this just came out ?
wish i could afford one          But Im poor
@southpark, make a separate cartoon about Randy, it will be great!
South park is the light in these dark times
Sharon is impossible. Randy should’ve stuck her nose in her own 💩like a dog who isn’t trained.
south park more like west area
emmy award winning show
oh Niceeeeeeeee south park Goooooooooddd
Damn I found Ludwig’s favorite episode
This episode was OK ngl.

The Japanese really do thought of everything when they created such a cool toilet.
Kinda makes me wonder if Home Depot actually sells Japanese toilets. 🤔
This is cool M'kaay
