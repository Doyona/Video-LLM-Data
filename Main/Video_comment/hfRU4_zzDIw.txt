𝟏 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝟑 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒔𝒐 𝒓𝒆𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒎𝒆
THE RIBS!!!😭😭 its the only comfortable position but HURTS. (Tbh most laying positions hurt my ribs) and I've gotten used to the cold..
The fucking fact that I’m skinny but my thighs decided to be big😭🔫
I'm fat and I can't dance either
As a skinny 10 year old with eating disorder this is 100% true, literally!!!❤😂❤
"I CANT FUCKING DANCE" AND THEN FUCKING EATS IT
Oh my god this explains so much I thought I was just fucked up ima go be big back now
What is with this girl and fuck
As a skinny person who has only seen about 120 pounds maybe a little less I can confirm all of these and more
I feel so bad now...
Better than being fat 💀
Fat people Hittin’ the griddy is really funny in my opinion im the fat guy Btw lol
I've been thin basically my whole life "excluding the fact i was a prettu chubby baby", and I had no problem doing dances.
the cold one is extremely fvckin innacurate, i NEVER get cold
Girl same
YEAH IT SUCKS CAUSE ALL IR FRIENDS ARE LIKE “Who wants to throw ball pit balls at each other?” And I’m like MEEEEE and they go “na ur to skinny- we gonna kill you”
Bracelets never fit 😭
My heart just got stabbed from these facts.
As a skinny ass person, I can confirm this is true.👍
I feel u
Don't worry fat people can't dance either
I like this FUCKING skinny girl!  Hey skinny girl..........I'm FUCKING skinny too!!!!!🎉 FUCK YEAH!!!!!
I feel your pain
I also got told shit as a cheerleader in the air and it being not to windy and telling me " oh no! Ur gonna blow away!" WTFFFFF
BELLA: "I CANT DANCE!" (PROCEEDS TO TRY) ME( ALSO SKINNY AF BUT A DANCER AND CHEERLEADER): 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂( I DO HIGHKEY SUCKS AT HIPHOP AND FREESTYLE)
The dancing i-i can’t 😂
im so skinny and THIS IS THE MOST RELATABLE I'VE EVER BEEN LIKE EVERY SINGLE ONE
She’s twenty smt and sixty smt pounds and im ten eating seventy pounds 😅
Wth is bro doing on that sink
Same girly
That last one’s just a skill issue
People honestly need to respect skinny people. Like how would you feel to get made fun of in front of crowds because of how skinny you are???
Fucking facts!!!
As a fat person I will still continue to say I’m jealous
Realll
Same
At least you are brave enough to do
The getting cold easily one is way too accurate
Lol i feel all of what you said
Her: I can’t dance  Also her: proceeds to dance like an oompaloompa
I get the fucked up thing I have friends that are constantly telling me ooh I’m so scared you are going to break or your legs are so skinny I’m scared I am scared I am ugly I know but why why do this why say that
Lucky as hell.
Whenever I get a pair of jeans, they cannot fit because I have a smaller waist and I get cold and it hurts my tailbone when I sit on a stool. So yea 😂😂😂
"If you have problems with eating, its okay, you can tell us" is not okay to say to a child
I am a person who is skinnier than most, not due to not eating or any of that crap. Its because both my mom and dad were very very skinny and its just runs in my family. And as i skinny person i can confirm that all of those things u listed definately happens to me😭  One time i was going for a walk while it was super windy and i fell down bc of the wind. And ppl always ask me if i eat when rlly i am a big time foody!
PLEASE i NeEd weight gain info😢
„There’s some skinny people problems“ yes, as a „skinny“ person I can confirm to this.
Get you
Im not skinny yet i relate to all of em, umm
I am called a FUCKING SKELETON at school because I am so skinny
OMG THE 1ST ONE THOOO ❤
i feel you girl
I am way too skinny and I can’t eat anything because of allergies so I totally feel this.
As a skinny person, this is so f-ing accurate
The belt one is so true 😢
Im skinny too and i feel this 😔🤚
This is relatable.
Same I’m just skin and BONE
Nuh-uh-uh, take your shoes off 😡
I’m skinny and I can confirm all of this is true. I literally have fast metabolism and I hate it 😂
as a skinny dancer, i can say 6 is non-existent
Also your ribs tend to be poking out further than something else close to that area sooo
When I sit down my spine digs into the chair and it rlly hurts
I know
DEAR👏SOCIETY👏ASKING👏12👏YEAR👏OLD👏GIRLS👏IF👏THE’RE👏ANOREXIC👏REALLY👏MESSES👏THEM👏UP👏
I can’t dance either 😭😭😭😭😭
As a skinny person (who btw dose eat pretty well ngl) this is true
Being a skinny AF person myself due to genetic purposes. I can confirm. This relates a lot.  (I didn’t expect it to relate this much, she’s explaining so many people’s lives right now, including my own 😂)
I am skinny I can relate
As a skinny person who wears leggings and they STILL FUCKING FALL DOWN I can relate to this so much
I Think you’re a really good dancer
Society one is the worst 😭
The dance 🕺 😂 it slays though
This is me rn
Even though I’m incredibly skinny, my body somehow found a way to produce way too much body heat
Lol I only weight 100 lbs. and yet I am a girl and I eat the most out of my whole family.
This is so accurate.  I’ve always been skinny and petite person and people always have to comment about my weight and height.  It’s always really awkward when I have to reassure people I do actually eat.
I remember when I got sickly thin -before being diagnosed with type one diabetes- been overweight my whole life but got down to like 86 lbs. Went camping and had to sleep in a pool floating bc I could feel all the bones in my back along the tents ground 😂
Yes same i used to not eat at all so im still skinny and i agree
Girl I feel you
I’m showing this to my brother so he’s not a dic
TRUFF.
I got straight up judged by my uncle at Thanksgiving when i said i was working out and dieting. "But you're already a twig" i was overweight at the time, wanted to get into shape before it got bad. I had lost 20 ibs (in the good way lol) in the span of about 2 months. Ive always looked skinny, even at my heaviest i still looked really skinny.  He wasnt even concerned about my well-being, he was more concerned about the fact that i was doing something healthy that he didnt agree with (literally cardio and calorie tracking/limiting). It seems like not matter what, peopel arent happy. You're overweight,  people arent happy, you lose weight, people arent happy...
Tf you mean you can’t dance you just bust down some moves 😂😂😂
I know I but as a kid I started stress eating going from around 80 Pounds to 100 also I'm american
I'm a skinny ass guy holy fuck that shit hard people are assholes to me but, I'm a ballet dancer so that's a plus
Never released how skiny I was until you described me.
I resonate with this way to much :P
I feel you so much my hole life I've been skinny enough to the point where you can see the individual ribs in my chest
As a skinny person, yes it really sucks but is overlooked a bit
So firgin true
My older sister was always telling me how bony my butt was when i was younger... NOW I KNOW WHY!!😂
When I was 18 I was 6ft and 125 pounds
As a skinny person with fast metabolism I can confirm this is true
You're a pro and dancing❤
i'm skinny af but i have a cold tolerance, but everything else is true. I weight 63.4KG and im 22 yrs old its annoying and my metabolism doesn't help in the slightest. as a guy it sucks XD
The cold thing is the worst for me ALWAYS  ALWAYS COLD  and then the accidentally hitting your bones on things... like when I accidentally smack my elbow on my hip bone or if I lay wrong and it feels like my bones are rubbing against one another T_T
And I’m too fat 😢
As a 13 year old who is extremly skinny the society one is real actually all of them (sorry for being so late)
To be fair, the last one is just cause you're white.
I'm skinny my family always talk infront of me that I'm to skinny and I'll get blown away ,I'm ten.
"i cant dance" **literally every kpop idol has left the chat**
I eat more than some fat mfs and still skinny af 😂 I just accepted that I have a fast metabolism 😂
I have all the problems
My dad says I’m gonna blow away in the wind
Yes 👏 my doctor would literally ask if I ate, I was like 7 😂
I’m on the bigger side of medium sized and I can’t dance either I think that’s a person to person thing… but ur really pretty we should learn to dance together idk I’m tired
Omg so true😂😂 i remember my mom going to the stove to make holes in my belt bcz it was too big🤣🤣
But 5 is so real people keep asking me if I am even eating and I’m just getting tired of it
Same brooo
Omg finally. I have dealt with all of these my whole life, and YES! I. EAT. PLENTY!!!
The belt is so fr
At least you can lay on your stomach without pain😭
The pants one is no joke!!! It's SO HARD to find Jean's that fit me
Omg thank you for this video
That's me and my friends dancing well😅
I feel like the can’t dance is unrelated to being skinny lol 😂
My toes are skinny and cold 9999999999% of the time
Ppl who can relate 🤧<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Idk if this has to do anything with me being skinny, but I physically cannot do situps without demolishing my tailbone
That's so real...
Girl, u not being able to dance has nothing to so with it
I cant dance Too!😀
So fùcking true
The rib bruise is so relatable 😂😂😅
As a skinny ah child I can relate to all of this.
All the fat that people say is supposed to be on her bones transferred into height
Hahahaaa don't feel bad I can't dance either. When I dance people get hurt LoL
Try ballet 🩰
“I cant dance” listen your dancing is better than mine
Same :'D
one of the perks is a higher metabolism than others
This is relatbule
Same for me, except i over heat really fast, like I don’t get cold I get really hot 🔥 to the point I will go lay in an ice bath
I can’t dance either, I just get confused when asked
Well you dance better then me
How the fu- you just explained my entire life, but I'm not even skinny. I'm fat as fuck. How tf does that work?
You danced and we all got stick bugged
true epically people saying stuff like what she said when I was younger
THIS FEELS SO REAL
Maybe that last one’s just you😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
As a skinny person i can confirm that these are true 😭😭😭😭😭
fax, been skinny my whole life and society is making me wanna kill myself (for legal reasons that is a joke)
YES I HATE THIS
i’m extremely under weight and i can relate to all of these 😭 people always think of the disabilities of over weight people but under weight people are never recognized but no one really cares about them 😭
Only you would understand… but I am the one of the best dancers I personally know
"i cant dance"  *_proceeds to summon a demon_*
As a ten year old who is 20 pounds under weight this is so relateable especially the criticism about how I'm so skinny but hey at least it's easier to do a cartwheel or a hand stand
Im 85 pounds and for some reason that’s not normal for my age..? I’m 13 btw 5’2 🙃
im the exact same way lmao 💀
Ok but the sitting ass bone problem has followed me my whole life and is too real, it’s always the school chairs man!!
As an abnormally skinny person who cannot dance, I can approve that this is all true😂😂
As a fat person, I can’t dance either, but I don’t think that is a weight thing
shes got better dance moves than me :skull:
Relatable except im still really skinny but i eat a lot
fr
Same
Why is everything so true. I am a very skinny person and people’s comments kinda lower my self esteem.
All of this is true and I'm a kid I've been told to eat more but I eat like 3 meals and 50 snacks I can find a day
As a skinny person I can confirm all of this! But a weird that I can do is grip my rib cage like a literally door handle 💀
Im fat and some of these things happen to me, so, either im not fat, or your not skinny.
"I CAN'T DANCE"  proceeds to get posessed 💅🏻          (absolutely no hate to jayus❤)
So fruckin true, When I stand up, my feet hurt, when I sit down, my ass bones hurt
I don’t know WHAT your talking about cuz PERSONALLY I think those are the BEST dance moves I’ve EVER SEEN 😂     FR THO-
Seriously? I thought everybody had these problems (most of them especially the sitting down hurts and always being cold)
My mom always told me I was skinny and would call me a string bean-
"I CANT DANCE" Me *looks at my skinny ass brother* so thats why my brother can't dance
Everyone (including me) used to say “the wind will blow you away” tbh i took it as a joke and no one ever meant harm
Why are we always so stiff when dancing 😢😢😢
So true so true 😢
But when i eat as much as i can im still skinny
As a slightly overweight person, laying down on my back causes bruises on my ribs too. Maybe I’m just unusually bony even though I have quite a bit of fat—it’s mostly in my legs and waist, after all, so I guess it does make sense.
If me and you were to dance club, I don’t know if they could tell us apart between our dance moves. Lol
I feel you. I'm only 5'1, but I weigh 87 pounds
trust me i know im skinny to
the dancing got me on the floor
Bro i was watching this while my but was about to burst cause i had been sitting for so long
Is no one talking about how she weighs 66 pounds
Oh my gosh yes this is so true!
Brooo the sitting thing is so real 😂
how old are you, i am only 11 and i waigh 125 ilb
Yup Same here mate
Got called skinny as a kid now ive been working hard at the gym 174 pounds now
As a walking toothpick, I can't be in below 70f weather in a T-shirt because my arms start hurting
I WISH I WAS SKINNY LIKE DAMN YALL STILL LUCKY😭😭
I had to poke holes into my belt😭
Me on the other side 😢
She most definitely CAN dance
I can relate with this so much 🥹
I kinda make fun of my brother for being skinny but im really just jealous of him because im insecure about my weight and my grandmother has implied that she thinks im fat, i think slimmer people are lucky ngl
Im skinny and i dont have any of this problems
as spaghetti noodle i can understand
You gotta try the hardest to dance cuz where's that as, the best dance is the hardest
ME TO
From skinny person too skinny person it’s fr
I know..
Move to Lubbock or the perfect temp for us skinny people
I have the exact same problem
Ive got all those problems 😅 (especially the dancing one)
people notice overweight struggles but not underweight struggles this so truw
So true 😢
The "CAN'T DANCE WAS THE MOST TRUE OUT OF THEM ALL FOR ME😂😂(I'M ALSO SKINNY AS FUCK) ALL OF THEM WERE SO TRUE AND THANK YOU FOR STATING THEM.❤❤😢
frrrrr i go through all if this😭😭😭
All these problems affect me so much although i may be a child, im almost graduating from high school and im not even 100 pounds
I can relate
As a twig, I am 14 5’ nothing and 68 pounds
"I CANT DANCE" *Proceeds to dance better than anyone has in the whole universe*
As.an 80 pound grown woman who literally can't gain weight for the life of me I can totally relate
This is so true💀
I can confirm I am built like shaggy
Why did they literally explain me
I can guarantee most people don’t complain about being skinny as much as people complain about being fat.
All my belts have holes poked into them 😆
One of my larger friends would always make a point to call me a flat stick in front of other people and then laugh about it with them.  It was so mean and it always made me feel so awkward
My favourite comment was “I love it when skinny people get stretch marks” .. what do you mean-
You know like they say "1st world problems..."...well, "thin people problems..." 😊
Ive also been underweight all my life becuase of my fast metabolism, but ive finally reached an average healthy weight
Wait I’m sorry not everybody’s ass bones hurt when they sit down for too long?! This is new news to me
Word ... Lmfao. My wife was convinced she could make me fat. 10 years later, and I gained 10 lbs 😂
My grandma once said that I could get blown away by the wind
I have the opposite problem, too warm
Someone called me an asparagus for being tall and skinny
Can’t dance? Bro, where?
The joke with my friends is if they bumped into me too hard id snap in half or go flying
“I cant dance!” * proceeds to do the best dance moves i have ever seen in my whole life.*
I am also skinny as hell but I have gotten used to constantly being cold by leaving my window open and fan on all year round
Dont worry Bella I find you very attractive only im a man  PS the hot ones are always gay or taken
Get an alligator clip belt. They're infinitely adjustable (as per the length of the belt).
as a fellow skinny human, I can attest! These are so true
"I JIGGLE WHEN I DANCE"
"I CANT DANCE"  proceeds to do the thugshaker
umm just me who is extremely skinny but has been dancing for 10 years so far….
This is literally my life😂
as a fucking fatass of a 12 year old, i get hot.. REALLY fuckin fast.
#relatable
FR! I'm  still a cHiLd and family, friends, and RANDOM PEOPLE IN MY SCHOOL COME UP TO ME RANDOMLY AND SAY THAT STUFF- OUT OF NOWHERE. :) <3 Also the other stuff annoys me so much too ;-; :') <3
SKINNY SHAMING IS STILL BODY SHAMING
Girl you dance better than me
Omg someone else realizes that being Skinny kinda sucks too! I’d barley eat ANYTHING, and always get comments like, “eat something!” I can mostly relate to that, and my GD clothes not fitting!
You cant dance because you're white. Just facts (im also white and cannot dance)
Don’t forget poking people with elbows, always being the one forced into small spaces bc you’re the only one that can fit, being insecure about wearing revealing clothes, being insecure about ribs, etc.
i thought that being fat was just me being ugly! Never-mind! Stay safe and eat cake!❤❤❤❤❤
im 13 and under 100lbs, and my friends pick me up all of the time without permission and it fucking sucks
I feel the sitting one😭 my mum says i have a boney butt😂
i was really skinny all my life and my 5th grade teacher would comment on my weight, he would say things like " how to you get so skinny" " do you eat air for dinner?" " treat yourself to eating for once at lunch today" mind you he was a little more overweight and i just couldn't stand it. This was so bad to the point that he asked me if i was being abused, like WHAT im just a 11yo leave me alone. he was also very cruel to all the kids i lovey think he should've been fired. but yeah if you actually read this ty ❤
Toast!
As a professional skinny person I have concluded that being skinny sucks 🎉
Omg same
RELATABLE OMG 😂😂
OMG SO FRICKING TRUE EVEN RN BUT I CAN STILL DANCE
it actually sucks, when i first started middle school, i wanted to hang out with this girl i thought was so cool, and eventually i did. a couple days later, she started skinny shaming me. she even told me something literally scarring, “you’re so skinny, i bet you’d be so easy to kidnap.” saying that to someone is NOT okay, now i live my life in fear of that. but i stopped hanging out w her and i’m with much better people now, stay strong<3
Definitely feel u on everything
“Oh your to skinny eat more” or “oh your to fat eat less” it’s sad 😭
I've been skinny af my whole life and I was born in, grew up in, and still live in Florida where it's really hot. I'm on vacation rn and I went outside in below 50 degrees f in short sleeves and wasn't cold at all 💀
OK I thought nobody was skinny as me but I see now I’m not the only one this is amazing all of these things happened to me like all the time except the dance I can like dance really well😂
i weigh 107
Fellow twig here i relate to this sooooo hard also can we just talk about how jayus danced sooooo fuckin well like they said they can’t dance well that is not true alllllll ❤😊
REAL
my family members always tell me to eat more to gain weight because they think I don’t eat enough. I’ve literally been eating all day carelessly and I’m only losing weight. I’m also a super picky eater so half the food my mom cooks I find disgusting so that’s something.
Finally I have someone to relate to!
I 100% relate to that. Those things are so messed up to say to a kid especially because when you don’t get those comments anymore it starts an ED!!! (I speak from personal experience)
Relatable on another level
As a fat person, I wouldn’t care if I was skinny at ALL
"CAN'T DANCE!"  Yeah, me neither...
thanks
thanks
I can confirm this is true. I'm only 62kg
Bruh you just said you can’t dance and then proceeded to dance immediately after
This is relatable...
The dancing one is so true, I feel like the most gangly stick bug ever
When ppl comment that I just tell them to stfu bc they dont have fast metabolism like I do because it leads me to go severely underweight :')
real
QI HAVE TOO DO THIS AND I GET THESE COMMETS i found my people im still notnin healthy weight
I’m struggled with gaining weight and all of these are true
Omg this is meeee! I get you
I never realized my bad dance moves were associated with my perpetual skinniness 😮😂❤ but for real I'm almost 30 and 7 months pregnant and just now made it passed 125lbs... (yes I'm healthy so is baby) everybody complains about needing to loose weight and I'd kill to gain some... it's weird how that works. I felt this in my soul. Been this way my whole life too. I feel ya.
That Dancing thing is kind of you problem
For someone who can't dance she was absolutely schmoovin
You so can dance
As a skinny person, this is 2 true
that's my  entire  childhood :o
Someone once saw me and said "why are you so fugging lankey"
I have been skinny for my whole and all of this is true including the dancing part.
As a fellow ultra skinny person i can relate to all of this. I just want to say my hole life i always get comments like”you need to put some food in that thing”or”if the winds to strong you will blow away” and that is so messed up it is the same effect if you where fat someone would tell you to”workout “or”stop eating so much”WE WOULD GET FATTER IF WE COULD WORLD!!!
Ok girl you were shmooving and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, also I had never thought about how skinny people have some of the same problems as fat people while others are the complete opposite (I thought they’d all be opposite honestly)
i can agree as a skinny person
Add being tall as fuck on top of that, and my hands and feet are quite literally never warm unless it's the morning because I've been horizontal all night and blood can finally flow properly. Although, what with living in the far north, I have gotten acclimated to the being cold bit fairly well.
Relatable
Why is this so true😂😂😂😂
I’m 10yrs old 156lbs
when i sit on a chair, my spine rests on the back of the chair and it gets SUPER itchy and painful
Basic struggles for us twiggies  Im 14, 5'6 and about 103lbs, size 00 or XS People think of us having the perfect body but its actually more of a struggle than an advantage, always getting made fun of and family thinking you're anorexic but in reality you're eating more than them, not to mention ppl telling you how weird it is bc your bones are popping out, and youre js sitting there embarrassed, you feel wrong for genuinely not caring what your body looks like they point something out, that thought rendering in your head and eating at your brain almost as much as you eat
This is the most relatable video ever to me
Bro some of the comments I’ve gotten as a skinny person, like someone will confidently come up to me and be like oh you’re so skinny, how much do you weigh?? Like
Facts, but then I finally gained some weight and was called fat multiple times (among other things) and then developed anorexia and body dysmorphia 🫠
I became skinny because when I was 3, my dad and mom divorced, and I got traumatized so hard I barely ate for 2 YEARS, and now that damage is irreversible.
So I'm skinny  Nice to know
“break in half in the wind” 🤣🤣🤣
I would rather be skinny than fat because people think it ugly 😢
Stick bug >:)
I actually thought that she was 66 pounds but she only put one foot on the scale
Yup can confirm all of these are SOOO TRUE! But for the belt one I’m either always the last 3 or I have to make my own holes
I CANT GO OUTSIDE WITHOUT SOMEONE TELLING ME TO EAT MORE AND IM 14! Gromme belts are my best friend for pants as well
And it's the exact same for fat people too
"I'm so afraid your gonna like break in half in the wind" I've heard alot of skinny people insults but that was just way too far
I skinny but have a fat ass it sucks cus the ratio just isn’t right 😭
Omg I have that same problem when I was 10 my doctor told me to eat more
I’m skinny but I have muscle so I weigh a healthy weight. But one time I was trying a sweatshirt on at a store and the worker there was telling my mom how skinny I was and I was just like- uhh
I eat alot and im not gaining weight at all, is that a problem?
Dancing sas perfection  Italian moves and u think she’s got some LATINAAAAAA in her
can't dance me being super  skinny and being a cheerleader
Come on you can dance everyone loves the hair airplane 😂😂😂
I can confirm
People don't understand fast metabolism. Like fucker! In actively trying to GAIN WEIGHT!
My Skinny Friends Are Very Pointy When I Pick Them Up.  I Like My Pointy Friends.
Hi I used to be straight but I just had an awaking thank you only jayus
Never realized I was skinny, cause I relate to most of these!!
I don’t think i’m that skinny (~100 lbs) but I have all of these things and MY A$$ BONES HURT SO BAD 😭😭😭  also of course I have to love wearing baggy pants and I am too big for child belts (only by a little bit) but way too small for adult belts 😐
When you feel upset just watch Bella try to dance 😂 Gets me every time
I’m short and skinny…
Dont worry I’m also very skinny
I love how he also body shamed us  women with small boobs kind of j.rk move i have small boobs and i like them she wont magically get melon boobs anyways even if she gains weight
I'm in college I'm 7'2" and I just got the weight of 109 pounds and I have five bruises on my ribs and skinny people have very fragile bones
I will always remember things people called me: wet speggetti noodle and chez stick
Oh my gosh!!!! Finally someone who understands! I’m a guy and still experienced the same exact things!
Can relate 😂
You can dance.  You just did.  You just don’t like how you look when you dance.  I’m pretty sure that more a self image problem than a physical one.  I have the exact same problem.
Dude I’m tall and skinny so no pants fit me because the are either to short and fit in the waist or are to big and fit my legs
is she 64 pounds
Relatable
B O R I G E R
Look, you can dance better than me (admittedly not much of an achievement, but still much better than me 😜)
skinny people cant dance kpop industry: 😊
...yes man
As a very skinny person, I relate to this because like I eat a lot of stuff during the day, and I look like I am a walking twig
Nobody can dance
This is so relatable! I’m like size 8 in the wast and size 15 length
I don't think being skinny is the reason you can't dance 😂
Greg heffley ahh
Same
i wear baggy jeans so i constantly have to bring out the trusty belt that has holes going all the way around 😃
Can’t dance??? Uhm… Niki?  #Enhypen
Don't worry I can't dance either 😅😂😂😂
Nah bc, my friend des is skinny, and her back bones show kinda and I get worried-
Bro f*cking killed it on the floor. 😂
How the hell do i relate? I'm 220 pounds man, how the hell do my ribs and ass bruise like that?
You think skinny is bad? Trying being doughty overweight. I'm like 10 kg above the recommended limit,  yet literally I made my first proper friend towards the end of tenth grade. Shits traumatic.  Not to mention am the other biological inconveniences
OMG thank you for saying this! No one ever gets me like this
i feel ur pain im skinny as fuuuuuuuck aswell
Hey, that never stoped Michael Jackson from dancing. He was skinny as hell.
I’m fat and still cold
Would trade problems in a heartbeat.
At least your getto booty  kinda hold up your...........lol
I have the opposite problem. My body was made to survive famine. No matter what I do, my weight plateaus after 1-3 days of consistent diet and exercise. No matter what I do, at most I lose 6 pounds and it comes right back by next week. It doesn't keep going up, but having my entire family use "baby hippo" as a nickname for me for my entire childhood absolutely sucked.   I would happily give you some of my extra insulation if I could
Me being fat with the same problems but getting bashed for being fat even though I barely eat and are always starving myself
Same
As a fellow skinny person having people call me anorexic
Be grateful to be skinny
Same with me, I'll eat what is a healthy portion for me, and someone will dish up a portion triple the size and tell me to eat that as well, and I'm like no, actually you're a fool and people assume I'm anorexic, which I'm knowing near I. Might not be a healthy weight. It's because I am small and born premature. But who cares they make the comments they want to make? And for some reason I just take that shit
DON'T WORRY YOU DANCE BETTER THAN ME!
Nah and then your friends will make fun of you for being skinny AND THEN SAY YOU’RE LUCKY TO BE SKINNY AND WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT THEY’RE LIKE: oh quit being so selfish you should be lucky you aren’t fat. WHEN YOU ARENT EVEN SAYING YOU WANT TO GE FAT YOU JUST WANT TO BE A NORMAL WEIGHT(or is it just me-)
Also dont forget about wearing shirts looks like jedi robes and leaning on stuff hurts so bad is just stand normally
Same
I was skinny as a child and everyone said these things to me, now I'm chubby and people are still taunting me. They'll never be Happy so be yourself and make yourself happy.
The dance thing is just a skill issue
Ikr I only weigh 72 pounds
YEAH LIKE THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH IS SO REAL
"I CANT DANCE" Absolutely gets down
“I can’t dance” *shows everyone how much better at dancing she is than me*
I can't dance *dances like Michael Jackson*
As a skinny human, this is all true
Or I’ve been wiring for someone to say something
ok i think were the same
I was always told by my family "you know your the skinny one!" And then would poke my stomach and it made me uncomfortable and self conscious
They tell me to get some meat on my bones but when they see me actually eating a good meal for once they say “wow, are you really gonna eat all that?” LIKE MAKE UP UR MIND
As a kid I once got literally picked up by the wind and my sister had to grab my leg
Thank you for that dance…. Thank you 🙏 😂
Nah girl self depreciate all you want but you can still dance better than me
wdym you can't dance? those were the best moves ever
I mean those moves are better than mine so…😶
I agree
I'm really skinny. So ty for this 🙏. Also💃🏽💃🏽
Pretty ducked thing to say to a kid Im under 13 and i get told that like 5 times a day prob
FINLAY SOMEONE UDERSTANDS
I have a really skinny friend
My friend was saying it was too cold outside when it was just a smidge chilly I feel SO BAD for not understanding
I can fit into a pushed in chair is this normal!!! 💀💀💀
Im not even skinny, im a male, not fat im sorta inbetween. Sitting down on the ground specifically hurts my ass bones but sitting on a chair is fine for some reason
The belt thing is so annoying. Not wearing one is not an option if my hands are full and cant constantly pull up my pants on they will fall off fast. Even with my belt I’ve punched a hole in they still have a hard time staying on. So yeah I end up unintentionally having my underwear showing or ass hanging out like I’m “sagging” so I gotta hear people joke about that.
This is my entire life in like 60 seconds
both sides want what they can’t have. it’s a depressing fact. you want to gain more weight, and a lot of people want to be skinny like you. if you were overweight chances are you’d probably feel worse.
i looked at the weight index the other day and I had no clue i was under weight...
This is why I'm chubby
When I would love a foot like a burger or something and I ate the whole burger my aunt would go “ ya you need to eat girl” like please stop 😭
my family has quite literally say “Are you starving yourself?”  My reply: “….I’m a twig”
The society is so true even your family says it 🫤
BOO HOO I am overweight and I SWEAR THE COMMENTS GET SO BAD I CAUGHT A FOOTBALL MY FRIEND THROUGH AND HE SAID IM ODELL BACON EGG AND CHEESE JUNIOR.
Bro I can literally lift you💀💀
And I’m 99.8 pounds at ten. IM A FUCKING GIRL
"go eat" *me after just eating 8 snacks straight*
It's like she gets me.
U can cut the belt, take off the metal part, cut it down to the proper size, the put it back on
@2biglugs1
Pretty much dude
As a big person I also can't dance
This is so relatable- Like as soon as I turn in the ac Im cold already 💀
Im 13 and 85 pounds, I feel ya 😅
i have the same problem as u
I’ve never had to worry about being too skinny, quite the opposite actually
So that’s why I’m very sensitive to cold temperatures-
Well, you have better dance moves then me, that's for sure
I’m 12 and I’m 110
POV getting put on a a skinny dancer’s fyp
Me too😢😢😢😢
“Ew what is that?!” What I heard not once, but TWICE on TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, when someone saw my spine “bumps”, specifically the one at the very top that wasn’t covered by my shirt :( It hurts man
….IS THIS WHY MY BOYFRIEND CANT DANCE?! Dang. It all makes sense now…. Still love him though.
I’m pretty sure I can’t dance a pretty common problem Her: I can’t dance(proceeds to bust out the best moves ever)
This is the most RELATABLE thing I've seen all day.
3. I don't typically get very cold 4. Cloth belts, don't require holes and saves me so much headache 6. You lied, you clearly can
WHY IS THIS SO TRUE!
Relatable af
I am fortunate enough to own the world's most useful belt. It's braided leather and so you can find a hole literally anywhere on it. I bought it at a thrift store in 1989, when I was 15, and it fit me when I was 98 pounds, it fit me when I was over 200 pounds, and it fits me now at 145 pounds. Obviously I don't have a healthy relationship with my weight but still. Braided belts always fit!
When I was little I was heavier than my other cousin (because of genetics, he got VERY skinny genetics). One day my older family members were talking about how I was SOOOO much heavier to pick up than him. I was like 11 then.
As a skinny person I can confirm I have all of these problem
as a skinny person ive heard the same words to many times and they are “twig.”
I know what you went through I have the same issue with my arms and torso but my legs are fine if bigger than others
Plus you can dance Ur really good at it
I don't think not being able to dance is a skinny thing
all of what she said is sooooo true
My friend laughed at me when the wind knocked me over, I eat more than them, and they tied a leash around my waist to keep me from blowing away😛. But yea- literally me
No wonder I wear ten pounds of blankets and I'm still cold
Can’t dance is so fuckin accurate
My nickname as a kid was "Skinny Kenny". I hated that nickname, but I'm overweight and no one calls me skinny anymore.
As a skinny and short person I can confirm this. Everyone will be like "Go eat, get some meat on your bones"... Like trust me i've tried I can eat alot and stay super skinny
I am too. So I can relate. I get cold so easily too, I have to have a jacket or blanket on every 5 seconds!
As a skinny person I can relate 😂
As an almost 7 foot tall man under 200 pounds and has a waist under 30 these problems are faced
I was 90 lbs 2 years ago, and now I'm 140. Still skinny, just tall buff and skinny.
If you were skinny then I'm a skeleton 😓
I feel like it’s worse when all the time people will be like oh my gosh your so skinny, I wish I was like that, or “what’s your diet because it’s working!” And I’m just like bruh 💀 I’m kinda surprised that I’m alive with the amount of gummies I eat a day 😭😭😭
I’m 11 and go through the SAME thing, I shouldn’ be 5 FOOT and SUPER SKINNY at 11!
I am “skinny” and people call me names one that annoys me is “twig with a wig”😢
"I've been skinny my whole F- life" *Me who's been chunky my whole life* "I'm sorry I missed the part where that was my problem"
Hey at least you try to dance ( I’m still sad that my ballet classes were shut down
Nope most of these apply to fat people as well except for the pants and the social part, instead of the pants being to big it's that there to small and instead of people asking if I eat they ask if I have liver problem yet
That belt one is so tru
No matter how much I eat, I don't gain
as a very skinny child if I danced to hard to dance because my ribs would touch my skin and make it hurt
I once as a child called someone fater than me because i thought commenting on someones weight was a norm  I felt so bad after that I was always little sceleton or stickbug How i suposed to know that it's not ok?
The dancing might just be because you're white 💀 (this is a joke)
I used to be small and skinny now im just small and fat
I can totally relate, my fam often teases me about my flat butt. The being cold issue is something I’ve solved. Daily sauna and cold plunge are excellent for thermoregulation
All my friends say I’m weird because I’m not a hundred pounds- bro Im 13 and weigh 97 pounds like shut up 😭
I get all of those except for the fact that I am a dancer
THIS IS ME LITERALLY  my parents are always like  “Your a stick bitch go eat something” And I’m always so cold and my parents are like “its so hot your on something”
I'm pretty sure dancing has nothing to do with being skinny-
home girl is 60 POUNDS!?!?!?!? That aunt healthy i could walk a mile while carrying you
Some Though
Are you 66 pound or am I American?
As a child tahts extreamly skinny that shii is f---ed up and reallyyy annoying to say to a kid it still happens! To me atleast     (Somhow im still insecure that im fat😅 idfk how lol)
I dunno about you but she definitely can dance
Oh I somewhat get this I’m also very skinny
It's the Society for me. One time, someone saw a video of my then BF and I and said "look, a dog with his bone" can we guess who was the bone?
As a skinny person i confirm this is true When i forget my jacket as i am going out I feel like im in snow im freezing so bad like-
Screw this fat people stuff we need more accomodation for us skinny people
Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 🙃😭
The last one is a you problem but I agree with you
I agree I get told this too 😢😢😢😢
I had all of those. You could see may bone and I was eating or like 5 people. I was probably stress due to fuck up child-hood.
I cant relate lol.
Skinny problems are real. Winter is the worst
You ain’t skin and bones like some other people I’ve seen
As a male who is 103 lbs, this is too accurate.
“Skinny people cant dance” Me who has 10 dance classes a week: 😐
I grew up skinny as fuck too.  Then started smoking both weed and cigarettes at about 14-15, when I quit smoking at 32 I also went from cutting trees down (very active and physically demanding job) to a factory job mainly driving forklifts.  In around 6 weeks I went from eating as much of what ever I wanted and 53kgs (116lbs) at 5’7” to 70kgs (150lbs) and had to stop eating sugar and limit my carbs.
I always had these problems, actually still do. When ever I mention it they say "Why are you complaining about the small 24 inch waist you were gifted with? Stop trying to brag about it." I eat a ton of junk food, but it never does anything. As long as my posture is right, im skinny as a stick and forced to make my own pants.
I relate with all of these except the last because I've been complemented on my dancing recently but it's not true for you either.
FRR EVERYONE SAYS ILL BE BLOWN AWAY BY THE WIND
Me and my sis have a fast matabalism because we are asian so we are pretty skinny but we tend to find ways to gain weight
As a skinny person I can confirm that I suck at dancing
The belt is so relatable bro like😂😂
As a ex skinny person who finally got into a healthy weight im now a professional dancer :3
"I'm finally at a healthy weight..." 💗You💗are💗literally💗66💗freaking💗pounds💗  also as a skinny person this is completely relatable. 💗
When i was in high school i was incredibly skinny.  I was 5' 4" at 120lbs and i had friends get mad at me for being too skinny or having a thigh gap to the pount that i was insicure about my body and tried to gain weight. During that i still wasnt skinny enough for my mom.. now im overweight and struggling with the idea of loosing weight because i have a scewed veiw of it and i dont want to be skinny again like that.
Why is this so true, though?😂😂😂❤❤❤
I hate clothes not fitting as if it's my fault I'm built like a twig
I can agree to all of this
I have all these problems 😭
Why is this so relatable? I’ve always had a problem with having too low of a weight. My clothes never fit. They’re always baggy. And everyone says I don’t eat even the people who go out to lunch with me say they’ve never seen me in their life.
My hospital called my parent just couple days ago to force me to a dietist, ma'am im underweight since birth, i cant change it and its natural for me, i ain't gonna make myself weight more because 1 my knees cant handle it and i will look like zekes beast titan, google it💀
Bro just explained my childhood in one video 😢
The comments from adults are so true lol
Same
The worst thing is when one of your closest friends tells you to eat a burger. But just to not throw it up after, even if your not anorexic
My friend's mom seems to think I'm to thin... I WEIGH 125 POUNDS, IM FINE. Also has she seen half the girls at my school? Girls be walking around looking like stick figures
I am skinny so I can relate
It's not as bad as she says I've always been skinny but I'm almost never cold except my hands and feet
REAL :(((
I work with a Lotta larger fellas and they keep telling me a need to eat a day cheeseburger too lmfao
SLAY POOKIE 💓💓
All but the dancing one is true for me
She's got my dance skills
Im 60 pounds at the age of 12. So THATS why I am freezing!
Girl ur slandering urself those moves were the funkiest
I get this lol
Most of my life I have been skinny, and the comment one was a little different for me. It was more like complements for me, and when i got to a healthy weight, I felt like I needed to be slimmer since I being skinny was always seen and taught to me as a good thing. Now I don’t experience weight issues that much, not because I went to therapy or I tried to do something healthy, but because my weight insurances where replaced with gender dysphoria 😭
have you seen Skinny dancers there’s a lot of them like I don’t know MICHAEL JACKSON Skinny people can dance there Actually really go to dancing
YES!!!! also the "omg your so light let me pick you up!" Like NO you can't pick me up so don't even try 😠 😂
That’s a fact I know personally
7. You'll be flying if the wind is a bit faster
PREACH BROTHER PREACH
the dance tho
Agreed!
pocking new holes to the belt. yes.
I mean your dancing ability isn’t dependent on how skinny you are you just can’t dance😂
I am a skinny person and this is SO TRUUE
“You are gonna break in the wind”   “Yeah and you are gonna have a heart attack at 35 tubbo”
I literally saw people happy they can fit 2 fingers around their wrists because of their ed, I'm over here wishing I had normal looking arms that people wont have to say fucked up shit about 😭
Relatable
Im 10 and i weigh 70lbs jesus
600 pounds!?!?!
Yea I can dance but still. When i was 13 i still weighed 84 lbs. You could see my ribs and everything.
As a skinny guy for my whole life as well, u can relate other than getting really cold cuz i have body hair.  Also last one is a skill issue
Real. Not to mention me being reckless and skinny do not go well together, I’ll be roughhousing with my friends, and then have to stagger away in pain, because I got bumped in the rib, a little too hard, even though my friend barely tapped me lol
THIS IS SO TRUE
this is so real
Im in eighth grade, 77 pounds, i cant keep weight on.
As a skinny person I can confirm this is true
THANK YOU FOR THIS
So, I don't want to take away from the issues you've lived with, but they were pretty relatable so I wanted to give the inverse. If the reader doesn't care, feel free to scroll by and ignore 😁    Hey you there! The one that clicked show more because you're like "Oh these aren't the same let me read this so I can complain about it!" I know they're not the same, they just relate pretty well lol.   Sitting down (on a bad seat) hurts my butt because of all the pressure my mammoth sized body puts on it.  We have too much insulation, so we get hot easily and find it hard to cool down.   The belt is pretty similar, just that instead of making new holes, we gotta specifically get ones that are long enough to swing through the city on like Spider-Man.   I was pretty sheltered so I didn't get much of society making fun of me for being fat. One girl did make fun of my man boobs though which was a sore spot for me, but I got over it.   We can't dance because we're white 😂 But plus side for fat people like me, we have a lot extra moving around that might cover up our lack of skills lol.   I know its on me, I'm the one that put the food in my mouth, but it felt relatable.
This is literally me
“You’re my friend now become my kite” 😂
NO FOR REALLLLL! IM 5'5 AND HAVENT HIT 100lb AND I CANNOT EVEN LIVE
Oh, that’s why I'm always so cold.
Sadly (as a white person i can say this) the dancing is just a whit person problem
I feel your pain and suffering 🥲
Skinny people suck at dancing but you broke the pattern with that amazing dancing
SO FREAKING TRUE THANKSSSSS
as someone who is 30 pounds underweight because I have medical eating issues, can confirm people making comments makes you feel shitty 🗿
That dance 😅
That dance 😅
We're all on an equal plane. We all have shit we don't like about ourselves.
How is it so accurate-
People would ask me if I was starving
im not skinny and i cant dance if it makes you feel better
one time i had my arms in my shirt cus i was cold and my teacher stood up and said "Im turning down the AC because Lila is cold. Cmon eat a steak once and a while" like bruh
Soooo true tho
"I CAN'T DANCE!" Well, neither can I, and I'm not skinny, sooo...
Yeah, and we don't talk about the swimming -not-floating part
I experience most of these but the cold one and clothing not fitting isn't one of my problems
Can relate! I literally have always been 100 lbs or under
finally someone speaking out about she struggles of being skinny
Not gonna lie I feel like it’s a matter of opinion cause I grew up being told things like that because I couldn’t gain weight really until my 20s but it’s not super fucked up to say to kids that they should eat more. Could it go without saying? Yeah probably but it’s not super fucked up
yeah hmh even if i eat i still stay very low in weight
Thank you I've been saying this for years and no one takes me seriously
The last one is just a white people problem
No I’m short, so my fat distribution is fckd up, so I get the worst of both worlds.  Cold, nothing fits, I always look bloated, my body looks unproporional asf, AND I can’t reach sh!t. 😭
Trying to find pants that fit is impossible, I am 5’1 and skinny, pants ether fit my waist, but are like kids pants and are too short, women’s pants that are too long, and too big at the waist or women’s petit that fit at the waist and are a good length, but the thighs are too big.  And I can’t go down a size because the pants are a petite zero!
WAIT IS THAT WHY IM ALWAYS COLD? but everything is so true
As a skinny person I agree
620 lbs?
Skinny is good but, you are right about the dancing.
Those moves were awesome.
as a well.... not skinny person. i still envy you. not to put down any struggles of being skinny. or say your dramatic, im still envious
Finally someone who can relate!!!  I cant dance, i get cold all the time, none of my pants stay up, it’s a night mare
I relate so much
god this is relatable
AND if you hug/lean on someone or sit in their lap they immediately are like "augh get off, you're stabbing me"
You are the best dancer to ever exist 😑❤
tf u mean u can’t dance? those are the best dance moves i’ve ever seen
I CANT DANCE  *continues to dance wonderfully *
she really just explained my entire life😭
Onlyjayus just wanted an excuse to dance for us. there is NO way that she should think she is bad at dancing. NO WAY!!!!
I don’t get it I eat a lot and I still am skinny😭
Fr
And the grandma's be like: "Just eat more!" I eat normally! My body just doesn't work the same as yours.
I wish I could dance
As a skinny person, I can confirm, WE CANT DANCE.
I don't lie when I say my sister is WAY to thin. She almost flew away once when she was holding an umbrella during a storm with high winds. The only reason she didn't fly away is because my mom caught her leg. The umbrella was a small umbrella too. This is one of the funniest but scariest thing I have heard from my mom.
I thought I was alone all this time😂
Marry me
Marry md
I remember having a friend who could eat a whole pizza 16” by himself for dinner one night and not gain an inch in his waist. Also this was a normal meal for him and he was under or maybe 150 lbs
I HATE BEING SKINNY AND TALL PANTS THATACTUALLY FIT  LIKE DONT EVEN EXIST 😭
goofy aw DANCE
I’m super skinny too 😭😭😭
You're so lesbian,i can't
Soooo true especially the one about people saying you have eating problems
“I can’t dance!” Rocks the Dancefloor better than I ever can
Stu Mackenzie would disagree with the last one
You I ever think “I have a really good comment that related a lot to the video” and the it’s a year old and decide not to post it? Thats what’s happening now.
I think the last one I just cause you white  (White people rhythm)
Got them skinwalker moves and it looks great
Idk why as a skinny kid having to poke more holes to my belts felts embarrassing. Like... They didn't make them small enough for my tiny self, it's not my fault. As an adult I'm under 5 feet, as a growing kid I was *small* in every way possible. I always stretched height before my weight eventually followed so every growth spurt made me way too skinny for my height for a while. In junior high my PE teacher thought I was anorexic and was about to call my mom because she could see my ribcage lines through my tank top while stretching my back and my collar bones were very out there for the world to see as well. She had also seen me skip lunch/eat only bread/the fruit we often had for dessert a couple of times. I just have IBS, if it was flaring I didn't want to eat lunch because my stomach was hurting and I only wanted enough to not feel hungry. She finally agreed to not call my mom but she watched me like a hawk for weeks at lunch. Eventually she was sure that I did actually eat food and only was a bit picky with certain foods (which made my stomach hurt).
Bro Im cold so fucking much and My ass we dont talk abt that
Got the same problem 😔 so skinny that my high school clothes still fits me (uniform) but i do see more skin showing meaning i grew well at least in the taller sense not in the wider and yeah i get so cold easily just watching a movie in a cinema would be like preparing for a long winter
Ye true facts
AGH nobody talks about this stuff it actually sucks I’m like a friggen teenager but I can barely fit any cute cloths like I’ll get the smallest size pants and they fall down but kids cloths are UGLYYYY
I eat 80 pounds ore second yet I I'm 80 pounds
"cant dance" * becomes wolf from payday 2 *
Dawg I’m 12 and I’m double your weight
saw this video a few months ago and was like "damn i wish i had these problems" and now that i have lost weight and now deal with most of these problems ik i've gotten skinny lmao
Dancing is a lot worse when you are fat
Not really sure you can blame the dancing on skinny.
Same girl and is called malabsorption.
I'm not as skinny but I get all of this all the time this is why I dont wear blue jeans anymore
No wonder I suck at dancing I have been trying to gain weight for 3 years and I finally gained 5 pounds
I don’t know why but my brain only seems to think of ballroom dancing and ballet as dancing despite all the other dance types
What do you mean you Are amazing at dancing!❤
Im extremely skinny, and i agrww wih all the things you said and have had to do those things- i cant type for shit
The last statements youll break in the wind or eat a burger. Put meat on your bones...i got told this alot as a child...now i have self esteem issues with my weight.
Girl sorry but that can't dance problem is not a skinny problem It just a you problem Plus being skinny is not all that bad Sorry to tell the truth but
So relatable especially the clothes and other people talking about
You think being skinny is being hard? Try being fat...   Before y'all say it no im not saying that being skinny or fat is worse im just saying
Im fat and get fucking tired as fuck in the first hour so dont be fat
Bro
I thought this was all normal, 🤯 I didn't know that if I put on some weight those problems would be solved
as someone whos been pretty underweight my whole life *i can confirm*
Your dancing is better than I could ever do
But DANM I wish I could dance
BRO YES THIS IS SO TRUE ALL OF IT WHEN I WAS A KID I KEPT BEING CALLED A STICK AND IT MADE ME FEEL SO BAD DOR NOT HAVING MORE MEAT ON MY BONES
Ur so Lucky Though😢❤❤
If I put on weight it goes away in the next hour and I kinda hate and like being skinny
Don't think being skinny effects dancing skills lol I'm not the best dancer either 😂😂
I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE ANYMORE!!!!🎉 I eat 3 plates of anything per meal and im still skinny AF😅
Let's be honest nobody in this world can dance
You can get weaved belts that dont have holes so it wont matter about the lack of belt holes. 😅
As a former twig I can confirm, I used to get so many bruises everywhere because my bones were always digging in or hitting something, it sucked, I’ve filled out more since then but I’m still kinda thin and get cold and stay cold really easily
66 pounds Healthy FOR A ADULT
so if i can’t dance does that make me skinny
Is this a problem you want solutions for, or just to vent? Both options are valid.
As a fat person, I can confirm that we also cannot dance.
Girl slay these moves are so good slayy
I feel the first one like my bones are messed up now 😂
I’m a twig too and my ribs hurt so bad when laying on the floors💀
I felt that
as a fellow skinny person, this is perfectly accurate
I’m so skinny I can relate peopel call me wimpy but there are downs of being skinny the comments from other people are the worst 😓
The kids would say: "If you turned sideways and stuck out your tongue you'd look like a zipper!"  Age 42 I learned that my body has a genetic flaw in that it does not hold on to Germanium, a mineral essential for assimilation of nutrition. Either I take capsules or drink Yerba Mate tea. 😉
I personally think you can dance. A lot better than me anyway
My wife is very thin and has been her whole life and people make rude comments like "eat something" it's usually a fat person that says it so she just looks at them and says "how can I? You eat everything before I get a chance!"
This is so true 😭
SAME!! (excepet the bad comments)
This is so real lol
13-year-old female and 92 pounds but I don't look very skinny🫠🫠🫠
Bitch that is so fucking true I
Everyone besides my dad in my family
Same man. I can dance tho
as a skinny person... yes but i am VERYYYYY undereight not like eugenia cooney level but like pretty skinny
Can I get some of your metabolism? I could use it, I'll give you some of mine in return, and you can get MORE than a little fat.
Or when you head and neck is bigger than your body ☠️☠️😭
im skinny but im like 100 pounds.. 💀
They got some moves
I'm just sayin, as a lesbian who actually can't dance, I'd be honoured to be dancing with bella in the club
As a fellow skinny person I can confirm this
And then theres the famous "You're so skinny you might get picked up by the wind" that shit hurt me
i’m skinny (like skinnier than u and anyone i know💀) and i have like none of these problems lmao
I still love to dance but mannn i got 0 hips like my hips do be lying cause they just ain't there and its so hard to feel good while dancing when i got my brain being like " what are you trying to shake " i compensate with my legs but somehow i fel more self conscious if i think about it
You,ve just really cheered me up. I,ve been skinny all my life, but really strong. Its bad when you,re young but oh boy do the comments get toxic when you are old and female. Having been reduced to tears recently by this, i,m so grateful for this video.
As a skinny person who's been wondering why the frick I can't dance, this explains a lot!
I been fat I'm skinny now. You don't win either way. Do what you wanna do.
I've been skinny too, and people are constantly telling me to eat more protein when I eat some kind of meat for 2/3 of the week :(
Skinny is healthy I don't know why everybody thinks that somebody's got to be fat to look good
bro literally
How da fuck am I still a kid and I 100 more pounds than you
Some more serious skinny people problems can be amenorrhea and thus possibly calcium deficiency, and more brittle bones
The lizard dance 😂😂😂😂❤
Relatable
I don't feel bad for you at all.
the Las t one is just a white person problem I'm half that jean was the dominant trat
Eat creatine...
i have the exact opposite problems: -Sitting is too comfortable and i dont wanna stand up, maiking me lazier and fatter -Laying down is also too comfortable -i'm always sweating like a mfking pig, even in winter -none of my clothes fit either, but on the other scale, they are too small -People tell me to stop eating burgers
I wish I could gain some wait, but thanks to my fucking fast metabolism, I can't
YO SAME IM 60 POUND
There's no problems for being skinny, you're just creating them. I am skinny and the only problem i get is fat people telling me to go gain some weight, it doesn't bother me.
I used to be overweight now I'm skinny and I struggle a lot - I always feel pain in my bones bc I'm directly sitting / laying on them, hard to find some things that fit perfectly, AND I ALWAYS GET COLD TOO WHEN EVERYONE IS HOT, i aggressively agree
7. You say the n word
For the cold one just find a warm heavier person to hug and cuddle
I used to be stuck on 120 lbs throughou5 middle and high school years. I finally got up to 130 lbs last year when I was 20 years old.
Sameeeeee, PEOPLE MAKE JOKE THAT IM STCK MAN. IM.NOT.THAT.SKINNY!!!!!
Also, when you pick an object up that is mildly heavy, your center of gravity is fucked
As a skinny guy, I can completely relate to this day. Skinny people are the hottest when they dance. They're so underrated and If you're an introvert then it's icing on the cake. I know it's hard ,but try to accept yourself every single time❤🔥
Being skinny is the best motivation to go gym and get ripped. The hardest thing is eating enough cause your hyper active metabolism just makes gaining weight and muscle that much harder. I’d kill to gain a bit of fat sometimes cause it’s way easier to lose than gain for someone like me.
My sister is skinny and she could dance bro if my sister can you can ?
Would rather have skinny problems than be a fat bastard, this coming from a fat bastard
YES SO RELATABLE 🤧🤧🤧
Life hack: buy children’s belts😎 cheaper, cuter, and they fit! I do this myself so I do recommend it.
Haha, I have the same belt 😜
Dude especially when you skinny and over 6 foot i just look awful trying to get sturdy on the dance floor 😂
Fr same
Gonna say the dancin’ part is not because of skinny …..
As a kid who was under wait and gained my wait in muscle so I’m still under wait with my muscles I sleep with three covers and I don’t get hungry except if it’s 2 in the morning so I have to force feed myself huge meals a lot because I’m also an athlete who works out for 18 hrs a week😅😅😅😢
ThIS 😵😒
Stop with the clunge diet and eat some real food then duhhhh
I just skinny person. All of this is true besides fact that we can't dance because you killed it man
You got moves all I can do is the worm and das it😂😂😂
Bella I don't think the dancing one is a skinny people problem ❤
Same...
I am skinny and I approve this message
I was fat and why tf i had these problems like bruh
How tall are you?
That last one is a you problem
holy shit 5 literally is the worst, people literally can't say anything else when they see somebody skinny istg 💀
You’re better than me at dancing😢😂
"I can't dance" you dance better than me
If your skinny and haven't been told to eat more food lucky you
I'm 5'10" and I've been everywhere from 142 to 275 pounds in my adult life. These are not problems.
"eat something" like what the fuck I'm doing just sitting around hoping the oxygen I breathe is good enough.
"CANT DANCE" *proceeds to bust out the best moves ever*
Yep pretty much sums it up
Dude IM THE GUY VERSION OF YOU. But a red head also lol.
Omg relatable I can’t with my height I’m 6 ft god just shrink me a little please I’m to cold and bony
Oh my gosh the pants and then the belt!!
Been there, I've also been that skinny. I know your pain!
"I CANT DANCE" *proceeds to become dollar store Michael Jackson*
Every problem she mentioned is true when people say to me oh I wish I was skinny like you, I said no no you don’t
im sure sombody will find this offensive but... fat people...                                                                                                        are the BEST AT DANCING and the FUNIEST
Yup . Yup . yup  yup yup , I get the sixth one but that's not anything to do with being skinny
Dang it was all way too true
ONG!!!!!! my pants never fit right, I’m always cold, I’m a light ass person, and all of my outside family make’s stupid ass jokes about how skinny I am 😤
Subject matter: Skinny people problems! What I got from this - Dance with attitude! You rock JAYUS!
I think you can dance quite fine
I rather be skinny than fat. I been both and life was easier when I was skinny.
Your belt doesn’t fit? Four words…  *USE AN ANSON BELT*
As a skinny person that has extra ribs, laying down on my stomach is like hell.
I can relate to all but the dancing being skinny because of basketball made dancing easier
SKINNY PEOPLE CANT TWERK LIKE AT ALL!
Painfully relatable
i feel you i'm 12 years old 5,6 and i weigh 45kg or 100lbs
I don’t know, but those dance moves with the best dance moves I have ever seen
Weight a second, you measure yourself in kilos? I thought Americans mweasured their weight in Bald Eagles or somethin'.
THATS LITERALLY ME I AM BERY SKINNY AND I CANT GO NO WHERE WITHOUT SOMEONE COMMENTING
Admit it you wanted an excuse to show off your moves 😂
Samme trauma...lol skateboarding saved me...
Bro be grooving and moving
You can identify as fat
I am 9 and I way 66.o pounds
ALL OF THESE POINTS ARE TRUE! I feel this deeply. 1.86m Grown ass 20yr old dude. Weighs 63kg.😅
the worst thing is when your pants fit but there to short
As a skinny person myself I agree
Yes! Have been pretty skinny ever since I had my second child due to thyroid issues, it is pretty annoying to be honest. And my weight comes and goes so clothes is the worst! 😅
You're cool in my book, I've always had the opposite going on
I would pipe
Just eat bread allot.
Lol same
Dances like a cramped up ellen Degeneres
The last one she just straight-up can't dance
The cant dance part is just your fault
The Cool thing is.. I am THE tallest 12 yro in school at 187cm. And I'm fat. AF like 110 but i began jim so I should be fine.
The fifth one is one that actually happened to me because my family was saying the same things to me when I was skinny and eating just what I needed and because of that I started eating more and now I need to lose weight.
Can't dance, proceeds to dance better then me lol
Talks about a genuine issue then screems i cant dance
My cousin called me a slim jim 😀
And when I was younger I thought I needed to be skinny to be beautiful😢
So true
That does not affect me cos I'm African
I can relate
Omg that beach pic is chefs kiss (just to clarify I'm not a simp just complimenting them)
All that is true
I mean at least she tried busting a move
I feel this I am a  freshman in high school and I weigh like 98 pounds bro
Ma'am you can't dance because you are American, not because you are skinny
My daughter is skinny just like her dad and they both eat like it's their last supper every meal so let's stop saying eat a burger or go find some food. They're eating I promise and the comments are just rude
I get this, only just broke 75kg this year at 22, got sick and got knocked back to 69kg. And for those "eat more comments" I eat 3 full size meals a day and work my a55 off
Getting arm definition will tone a very visible part of your body. Anyone says anything to me, I just roll my sleeve up to my shoulder
The dance was kind of unrelated😂😂😂
Am vary skiny
Me to
Everyone everyone it’s okay…you will turn 30 one day :’)
Me as a kid
She's pretty
Skinny is better …just sayin
Thank you I'm 15 and weigh 111 and some days I can stand the cold but most days I'm freezing especially during Michigan winter also pants and belt thing is 100 percent true and I am tall so it's really hard to get clothes that fit me height wise due to me being so skinny
i am really skinny and i can confirm
Hmm how should we start off the video on the sink like wtf
Nah those were some fuckin moves right there😂
It’s just as hard for extremely overweight
Dude i felt this brooooo
4. I have done that
I have to ware a size smaller and I'm a herbal dancer
I'm heavier then u  and I'm eleven
😮💯
Finally someone that understands the pain of being skinny
me whenever my parents leave the house
Being skinny also makes the hard r slips out easier
I feel this whole damn video to a t. Especially that last one. That last one especially hit home
bro this is so true
"sticks" one of my childhood nickname. Hey found many good belts because. 😊
Ok so I am Tall and Skinny so it’s really hard to find jeans or pants of any kind the really fit me  IT sucks  ⬇️ ⬇️  Like if you agree
You're not skinny, you're anorexic
75 at13
I concord part of the skinny problem by putting on some muscle.
Fuck
Relatable
Oiii! She can dance 😏
Sorry in advance but you looked like worm that you take out the dirt when you were dancing and again I am just saying it because it reminded me of it
Yep its okay to skinny shame but not fat shame 😢 ive dealt with this 40 years worse is are u anorexic RUDE
Girl you looked good. Still do
Start bulking and lifting heavy weights
Facts....
YOU PLAY VOLLEYBALL TOO!!!!!!
I’ll consider myself skinny fat, I’m 6’4, 193 pounds. With clothes on I look skinny, but I’m still have some flub from when I have 100 pounds heavier.
Ur 66 pounds I’m 60 as a ten yo witch may I add is still under wait :D
Same
For those of us that don't know kgs to lbs, she's about 145 lbs.
Personally, i think you can dance
Before summer, I would constantly get called anorexic and people would make fun of me because I was quite skinny and I didn’t have that big of an appetite, but I tried to eat as much as I could, but people just kept on making fun of me and my best friend of like 7 years stood there and laughed with them. I cut her off She’s now making fun of me saying that I was the fake friend and stuff like that . She is still doing that but it’s just really upsetting I trusted her, but she just started shutting me out. I thought I would work, but it really didn’t. I I really miss her but she was toxic mean and now she’s texting me on my ex best friends phone saying how much of an attention seeker I am it was a whole thing but do you know I kind of miss her but not really I just miss having friends so yeah she’s still calling me anorexic everyone at my school called me anorexic so I’ve had to cut everyone off and I am constantly getting bullied and stuff your videos. So you really cheer me up so yeah I hope you have a good day
I can’t lie but I think you cute onlyjayus
Nah, I'm built similar (6'4' 150 lbs) but I do great in the cold, maybe it's just the constant burning calories warming my soul from within
I can relate with this. I have to position my spine just right when I sit down so it doesn't hurt.
A come on… If you’re fat like me you eat to much and if you’re skinny and underweight you eat to little.  It’s as simple as that. Changing that is the real challenge so good for you. Not many actually manage to change their eating habits.
I was skinny when I was real little and I think I took some of those social comments on my weight a little too seriously because now I'm overweight and I am trying to lose weight
Haha love it
ITS SO FACTS
When she says no insulation, dam, wish I had that issue!!!
That's the same as being fat too, just the opposite direction.
So as a fat person with ZERO ASS you can imagine my pain.
All right 15 minutes ago was when my birthday ended I'm 13 now and I'm skinnier than you my mom keep on telling me to eat more and every single time she tells me that I want sucker Punch her😂😂😂
I love your dracula moves
she got some nice titties tho
I don’t think I’ve related to something more in my life
Same
The can’t dance is just being white
Wait- does this mean I’m skinny- 🎉
Her videos are relatable ❤❤
For the dancing part I just bounce around
So people assume that you are on drugs.  That's the one that always got me.
Probably English descendant- still very beautiful
skinny people can't dance.  k-pop idols: 👯👯‍♀️👯‍♂️💃🕺🕺💃
subscribed loved this video
And we eat the most
Idk being slightly overweight exaggerates some back issues as well so I’d take needing to lay extra padding on everything over nearly popping a disk in my back and breaking a few ribs while feeling like my insides got rearranged if I ever slipped on ice. Which happened and doctors keep not taking me seriously enough to investigate.
Hahaahalol same😊
I eat supper unhealthy food and should be fat but I am scinny than you
when i play video games on the floor after about 10 minuts my ribs start hurting really bad like this commeent if u have the same problem
All these things happened to me too
How hard is it to eat 2000 calories a day?
best part of being skinny in my opinion is im wiggly😂
Don't forget about not being able to find belts in your size
Same
Dude been there my whole life, finally got some normal weight but still only 70 kilos ffs 😅 (154 lbs)
I've been real skinny my hole life too,people used to and still say the same shit,like "don't you eat"? Hell I eat like a huge horse,I probably eat more than alot of ppl.
I've been to both sides.  From 140 lbs to 220 lbs. I'm 5 ft 7 btw and my bones tend to be dense. There are minuses and plusses to both sides. When I was skinny, while, yes, having the availability to wear cute clothes without shopping online because for your country, plus size = grandma clothing, there were some minuses. Please keep in mind I'm in Europe. Your butt hurts if you sit too long. But having a bigger butt means having difficulty finding clothes that fit well without showing everything. People constantly commented and complimented my skinniness, but that kind of creates a toxic environment for women based on body type. If you're pretty and skinny, you might be considered dumb or even derogatory things like bimbo, while if you're plus size, you're only that. Just fat. You may not even have the chance to show who you are before an assumption comes up that you live in your fridge. While you get positive treatment, plus sized women get bullied and treated like second-class humans. You get unwanted attention if you're skinny. It can get creepy at times. Have had guys chase me or just be absolute creeps. Everybody in your family or surroundings is super concerned about your bodily beauty and God forbid you gain weight. You won't hear the end of it. Back to the preferential treatment - you may not want it, but it happens, causing tension between your colleagues or friends. Some people hate you just for fitting the standard of beauty and size S or M clothing, which is a whole other toxic slew. The fashion industry and its sizes just gross on so many levels no.matter what size you wear, it gets smaller and smaller and you get called fatter and fatter even if you have stayed the same size, weight or body type for your entire life. Unless you get "fat". Then you make them look prettier just by being present. Thankfully, I have disconnected myself from toxic people like this. Not because I think too highly of myself. I think highly of my friends. Before they need me as an accessory to make them look prettier, they need to realize that they can be pretty in their own uniqueness without needing me. On the other hand, being plus sized has freed me. I used to struggle with body dysmorphia and still do, but rn I kind of give less effs. I still work out and try to eat healthy as much as I can, but. At least I found a person who loves me and appreciates my existence no matter what. We're currently planning a wedding.
“Get some meat”  THATS WHAT SHE SAID
Your awesome
....should i be able to dance?.....did i miss something?
Hump back of the dance floor
You can definitely dance
I’m skinny and I’m never cold, my body is like furnace
Love the dance
The comments are by far the worst because for whatever fucking reason society has determined they're acceptable but me calling a fat person a whale after they call me a twig is somehow verbal abuse 🤷‍♂️
Bro, don't even get started on your elbows hitting tables every fricken time
I get it. I’m 5’1 and 100lbs even. I’ve always been told that I’ll blow away in the wind, people are afraid to break me and that I need more meat on my bones. Like all my life. I thought it was alright then I realized just how self conscious I was( honestly still am) about my size and weight.  I’m 21..
Excuse me, you can dance.
Im naturally super lean (never been over 16% body fat in my life) and now all the sudden the fact that I walk around with a blanket on my shoulders makes sense. I have no fat to keep me warm!
Totally fuckin relatable
I feel you on this, particularly about saying that sh*t to a kid. I’m 39, weight 84lbs and that’s my heaviest not pregnant weight! The stuff that I’ve heard. I even hate the word skinny now because of bullying ALL my life about my size.
Im seventy pounds. At 12 years old
I'm skinny as fuck and tall. Shit sucks sometimes
I was skinny AF and yep all true
Soooo true all of this
Na fr zaza helps though like bro I will eat a whole box of cereal some ice's and whatever edible thing I can find
Im 12 and weigh more
Seems more like a "no rhythm" issue when it comes to the dancing 😅
Lol break in half bc of the wind, as a skinny person I nvr heard that one but it'd make me laugh 9 times out of 10
First world problems
Tall and skinny here, can confirm
Yep... i cant dance to save my life and ive been told i was built like a stick bug 😝😝
oh so that’s why I’m cold all the time
I CANT DANCE *starts pulling extra terrestrial dance moves*
yep ..and now i’ve gained 20 lbs and can’t shift it 😒
Omg yes! so true!
And for some reason eating a fridge a day doesn't work, like why tho
Die\d u play basketball
Bro I'm 12 and I weigh 110 💀💀
Most relatable video I've ever seen
I know that I am skinny
Being a skinny person I can confirm this
"I feel like if I hug you I'm gonna snap you I half" -my first girlfriend
😂 10 or 10 dancing😂
me personally laying down moves my ribs and collar bone a bit and makes it awkward to take a deep breath
I’m 19, a male, 6’0, 140 pounds. Technically underweight, and people used to call me skeleton man. I have chicken legs but I wear a shoe size 11, so when I wear shorts, my legs look so tiny and it looks like I have fucking clown feet. I eat about 4 meals a day, protein shakes, creatine, a healthy diet, a good workout regime, and after all that I can’t seem to pass 145. A little over two years ago, I got really sick and lost 10 pounds in a span of three days, and I weighed about 110 as a 17 year old.   A little advice from someone who has dealt with this since elementary school: don’t give two fucks about what anything thinks, as long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters.
Swear I deal with this every
The only truth😅
Some times I wish I could be skinny
Hey you dance better then my sister 😂
Im tall and skinny and everything but the dance thing is true, thats just a you problem homie.
I wish I was that skinny again😢...
Same and those mf who tell us to eat more dont know that i  eat 5 times a day😅😅😅
I'm skinny af Girls have an advantage, it doesn't look bad on them, infact I kinda like skinny girls but on men it looks horrible I'm 6'1 and 127 lbs Just imagine how I look and how others see me
people call me anorexic and it hurts
I'm 4% bmi 6,2 170 lb I look like a damn twig and eat like a bear
Yep. Except the dance lol-
❤ she is f..... right.
Bro I can’t gain wait for the life of me
My mother used to put bacon fat in my food to try to fatten me up and I ain't fat at all I'm 6-foot I weigh 135 lb
Um?  So?
as a skinny person who has been a dancer since I was 2, and has won many awards up to 5th in solo, 2nd in duo, and 1st in group, I am offended.
As a very skinny person, everything you said here is so true. Even, maybe especially the dancing part. 😐.
I’m also skinny, but I am a competitive dancer
BRO BUILD LIKE A TWIG DAMNNNNNNNNN
I gotten blown over by the wind and my bestie won’t let it go I’m dying😂😂😂😂
I feel you😂
I fight at Flyweight so i feel you 😂
The weed is the problem
😅😂this killed me you had me crying she just explained my life 😅😂hilarious go eat a cheese burger your gonna blow away in the wind lmfao I can confirm these are skinny ppl problems 😂
is it bad i can relate to every signle thing like clothes and belts not fitting well
Yess??? Like how you gonna tell me dancing isn't 90% jiggling body fat
So relatable
U can't dance bc ur skinny it's bc ur white
1 and 2 fax!!😭
Except then your belt is half holes and a bunch of excess leather.
The thing about the food is true cause a friend of mine in high school mother thought I wasn't getting fed at home but he told her he eats more then me and she couldn't believe it😂😂
Yup dont forget being informed constantly that you eat like a pig but still a twig
As a skinny person, I can confirm that I can eat as much as I fucking want and I will not get fatter. It pisses me off.
Damn! You gotta jump around in the shower to get wet.
Well it could always be worse. Like Eugenia Cooney.
I got the same problem 😅 💀
Peanut butter and sugar. 1y later and still no grass skirt.
Lolol It's funny cause I've Been fat for awhile but I have always had a small waistline so ya the belt thing is one the ball lolol
Same😭😭
I’m 11 and my friends friend said that I am to skinny to live and I need to eat more  And like I EAT SO MUCH
Fax
I'm really skinny to
I cant sit down without it hurting bc my ribs are like going on to my skin so it hurts af (sry i am bad at english)
This is so true!!😂😂😂
As an underweight guy I appreciate this! U can't tell if ur unhealthy on the inside bc it doesn't show on the outside, plus new doctors bring up eating disorders. My my and her dad are twigs like me, it's genetics
I eat whole pizza and I am only one hundred lbs and a teen
Relatible lol I'm 5,9 and 7 stone 2
my whole life i had to eat twice what people normally do just to be skinny. yes, pants slide down and belt? so tight it hurts. i hurt people sitting on their lap, just two legs that go ALL the way up! no butt. just a split. disturbing.  i was 35 before I was a "healthy weight!". now i am 46... and I have a new problem... i now have a pooch gut, like if i dont split my legs i WILL PASS OUT TYING MY SHOES because I can't breathe! and i am totally having to relearn how to do EVERYTHING,  and my coworkers laugh! i grab the vegan girl, who also has been skinny her whole life,  and is now very pregnant... and i point at our super round middles, and say "its not right! you all 'normies' have had curves all your lives! i cant see my feet! *lift my shirt!* i don't know what this is! neither does she! THIS!! *POINTING DRAMATICALLY * THIS IS NEW TO US! "
Please someone called the 🚑 she is a having a stroke
Most ur probs can be solved by a chubby guy 😅
As a fat person, I wish I could get cold, I feel like I'm in a fire constantly, I wish I could freeze my ass off
Whyyy is this soooo true¶∆¶
Yeah and I’ve been fat as fuck my whole life. It’s not rainbows and flowers over here either. I mean I get the looks and jokes but not being able to ride certain things. Like can I have an extension on my seatbelt for the airplane? Sorry sir you don’t fit on this roller coaster. No sympathy here. 😡
I am also very skinny so much so that my wrists are smaller than my 5year old brother
Relatable 😂
You seem to be in a somewhat good shape. Remember that it's best to be not too fat and not too skinny, but somewhere in between, but you do you. I have a friend named Jackson, he doesn't like doing sit-ups because he's like "Ow, my tailbone!"
Other people be like "just eat" fxck you
1 amd 6 i find bullshit. Most asses will hurt with all sizes. Believe it or not but 90% of skinny people can dance. The dancing part is a you problem sorry
I can eat like a fatass but can't become one
Cringe
relatable
you are just so adorable
I'm less than ninety pounds I might break in half in the wind
Ima be honest... this whole time i don't know your gender and now im too afraid to ask.
I relate😂
I'm skinny to
I'd say that's a dancs
yup, you tooootally cant dance
Jayus, you CAN dance!
Nah not dancing is a skill issue
Same. Although I ride horses that herts
Facts im 41 male an 144lbs... nothing works
Start lifting heavy weights and eat a shit ton of fat and protein. You'll bulk up
In January i started a challenge at my gym. You get pts for fat loss and muscle gain. I lost 12 lbs of fat and gained 5 lbs of muscle in 6 weeks…i ate friggin 3000 calories a day. I was told my metabolism was 1975 calories. Like that’s ridiculous, so i heavily relate to that “do you eat?” comment
I always hated the, "eat some more food." Comment. I am like "Oh yeah I forgot to eat my whole life THANK YOU." I can't help it that my metabolism is stupid fast
This is so fucking true
I can relate, especially for the always being cold in the winter no matter how many layers i have on. 😅
why are they all so true 😂 i've been a tiny human for a long time so i get it
Till I was about 16 the only pants that fit my waist was 00 in women's jeans so yeah and everything is true asf
I love you, gorgeous😘
At least ur tall I’m short and skinny as fuck I will do 700 sit ups a month to get a good body but I fucking can’t so when ppl ask me y I’m short and skinny as fuck I will tell the some ppl when they eat it goes in their height and some goes in their weight and some both and some none best shape I got into was a 2pack
Your dancing is everything!
"You have no insulation so u get cold really fast"    *me being a skinny girl, under a blanket cause I'm cold rn*:true...
Nah bruh she needs the minecraft skeleton sound for the end
That dance sequence… good news they have anti-seizure meds … clear that right up….
Damn being short and skinny sounds really nice rn im 6'10 280 pounds id love to be skinny but like my ass hurts alot when i sit i cant lay down like at all gotta be on a angle or my gut flattens my lungs 😂
Why when you dance am I reminded of early 90s jim carey
I’m 14 and I weigh 20 pounds more than her
I can't sit without being in pain 😂
I use to be skinny and let me tell you my ass does not hurt when I sit down on things such as bleachers (pause) the heaviest I have weighed in life is around 222 pounds had to lose some weight now I’m down to 211 pounds
Totally agree with the lower insulation. I’ve actually got Raynaud’s Syndrome so I’ve got it even worse😅
I haven't been "skinny" since I hit puberty, but I dropped a lot of weight.  Then a few years ago, I went raw vegan and lost even more weight.  To the point that doing situps actually hurt my tailbone.  My best friend said I was losing my butt and my then boyfriend (now husband) didn't like how my ribs felt, so I stopped.  I still wasn't actually skinny.  I will always be curvy.  Dunno how skinny girls do it!
That last one is just cause your white lol
number 5 still haunts me
i think the dancing thing is a... personal problem(yes i saw the caption at the top, im just making funi)
You ever lift?
Jayus the dancing issue isn't a skinny issue, it's a skill/rhythm issue
Skinny people get shit on fat people get shit on i think society in general just wants us to look healthy and well fed (from a fat person)
Or, instead of a belt, you could always use suspenders.
Skinny or not, moves like that are awesome And i should know Cause I dance like that
Relatable
I was skinny in high school, and one of the things people would say to me is, they would call me olive oil from Popeye
1000% accurate
you dance better than me I look like an autistic turtle bellyflopping 😭 ur dancings great btw and congrats on being a healthy weight 🩷
WHY THE HELL MUST YOU CALL ME OUT LIKE THIS
Ngl I think the last one is just a you probem
As a skinny person, I can confirm
right still dealing wit it and i’m 40
Lol i can't dance iether
I feel you
The androgynous 90’s look 👀
I'm 120 I'm 12
Thus is a you problem fuck real life loser dam
This is my life exactly 💯
There's not a single thing in your life that's going to make it better than being skinny. You sound like the society is pressuring you to get more weight. They're jelaous, don't fall for it.  'I can't dance" that's the worst reason 'I've ever heard. To twerk like a tramp... Just don't do it,.
Bro....I feel you! 🤣😭 I can't dance for crap as well 😭. And I'm skinny enough to still somewhat fit Into a teddy bear jacket....IM 17 AHHHH!
Bro turned into  Michael Jackson with down syndrome
The last one is a white person thing, and it’s not racist I’m white
I’m so light I almost flew with the Colorado wind. My backpack barely held me to the ground 😂
She dances better than me 😂😂😂
I've always been skinny, always picked on for it. Fat people used to get picked on but society cares about their feelings.
Same I have a high metabolism and a growth deficiency and I get told that all the time
Well, we pleasantly plump people are sweating from March to December, and we heat up faster because we got insulation
Fat people can't dance either, I wish I could
I’m sure I’m skinny. I’ve had to deal with this my entire life. It’s annoying.
I can confirm that the belt problem is a fat person thing too.
The "I can't dance" nah that just sounds like a skill issues Just joking at least you dance better than me
Nicacodo cant dance either and he aint complaining also you a better dancer than everyone i know
Try the sea food diet see food and eat
Bro I’ve tried eating a burger and The carbs just disintegrate I’m just skin and bones
Hey in yo guy babe
Thats all true 😭 but i like baggy pants and i am a minor thats in junior high and still shopping in the damn kids (only for shirts)
Bro, you're tall. It's hard to get size when you're tall. I'm  5.7.  I'm jealous of your height and I can't dance either
Just for ND a teddy bear to cuddle with. Lots of guys would appreciate you. Any chance to be bisexual?
we need skinny acceptance in this pro fatass society 👊
Bruh I thought you said you couldn't dance... ☠️
I’m skinny but haha I only get cold!!!!!! When there’s no snow but if there’s snow I can go f ing sit in it!! And not shiver once!!! Explain the logic pls
I've been skinny my hole life and one comment I got a lot from 1st-7th grade would sound like "stop starving yourself" or "you are just angry because you havent eaten" I wasn't starving myself I just couldn't gain weight. Even my teachers would tell me to eat more
As a former skinny person. All I did was start working out and eating more. Pick up the fork start working out.
You should try fat life, if I lay down like that I may not be able to get back up, I am always super hot, standing hurts my knees and back. I working to lose weight and I hope to one day experience skinny people problems again
Relatable 😂
Bro I eat so much and I am still skinny enough to see my spine and I hate it because people think I broke my spine-
I felt that lol
Pants
Number 4
Nah, last one's false. Skinny dancers look even more sick bc of their long af noodle limbs lol. Look at you, for an instance. You were slaying in there 😂😂👌🏻👌🏻✨✨
All this happens to me rn😂
Its so true
I have a skinny friend who joked about getting blown away in the wind and then the next time we hung out there was a small breeze and he lost his balance a little, my friend group jokes about this every now and again
I am skinny boi (gender neutral) to.
SO DAMN RELATABLE
Eat a sandwich was what I always got...
The last one may be true for some... but you def got the moves
This makes me feel so much better. And I finally understand why I get cold all the time. I was always so confused why I had bruises. I have always been called names and what not so I just love this video. Especially because I am in my early teens too.
IVE BEEN FAT MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE
Wah wah
SORRY FOR BEING 95 POUNDS
Someone cares - not me but someone
Im skinny and i can dance...(also ✨️amazing✨️)
I mean, you can dance if you want to...
POV ur her therapist:  Yeh I think she's autistic...
I love your videos iv been watchn them for a long time your slightly deep voice actually matches your personality keep that energy up 💯🤙🤙
CAN’T DANCE 🪩 💃🕺literally does better than me
THE LAST DANCE GOT ME LAUGHING
The only reason you can dance because you’re white
Im skinny to and the last two are so relatable 😂
Whoever told this woman she can't dance should be fired.
When your bones are popping out and you grip your ribs like a door handle 💀
omg yes 😒
Bitch you can dance better than my brother
For me personally I get a violent mixture of things on the food part. I get told I’m too skinny and that I should go eat a burger, but if I eat a donut of something even remotely unhealthy in front of someone they tell me I’m going to get fat by eating all that junk food. Like shut up Karen I have a ridiculously high metabolism because of family genetics and I work freight all night carrying heavy ass crap and running back and forth across the fucking building. Leave me alone I’m hungry.
You will also be told you will gain weight after you have a baby or wait for the "middle age spread" both are lies. I watched my cousin go though that and she is still a stick. I only been through one  but im still skinny.
Am 6ft 2, am taller and bigger in size but am still at 66....the weight is in the bones
The “you need to eat more” hits hard. I could eat constantly and not gain a pound. People really don’t understand how metabolisms work.
I was asked if I eat once... had a few people who were like "woah you're skinny" like, yeah... I know. Finally gained some weight and got an ass... now I keep knocking shit over with it😂 it is much more comfy to sit down though!
Same Im 6'3 and a paper thin I have stretch marks that look horrible I can't wear shorts and if I do they gotta past my knees the side of stomach looks like I have surgery scars from appendicitis it's horrible and clothes for tall skinny people don't exist
No those moves destroyed the dance floor
Yet, I’m still skinnier than you sadly 😅😢
That’s me
Bro I'm not alone anymore 🥲🥲❤❤
Poor you womp womp
If that is not dancing then the attempt is hilarious to watch 😂 Keep up all the good work bella. ❤
This is literally so relatable
I went from 343 lbs to 152 lbs. I had to buy all new clothes and shoes are the hardest to find in a size 15 wide!
Bro I’m 6’3 at 13 and I’m built like a fucking stick so everything you say is agreed on another level
I once got told I looked like a crushed soda can. And that someone could flick me and all the bones in my body would break😭😋
I know that feeling, I have a fast metabolism so I can't gain weight I'm 135 at 17 and can't gain anymore
One of the skinny problems I have is the jealousy of people when I eat almost twice as much as others and not put any weight on to be honest not the worst but would like not to look like you take an x-ray with a bright light
As a skinny person, I can relate to this
Same
And the there’s those friends who randomly try to pick u up
100% me
Facts
I get this a lot, and yet I’m at a health weight.
Was just talking the other day about unwanted comments on my weight. I am a stick as well. Tall lanky white kid. (But yet my siblings were somehow even thinner??). I used to work at an ice cream shop when i was 17 and 18. I got SO. MANY. DAMN. COMMENTS. "Man, i wish i had your metabolism". "Oh, i could never be that skinny if i worked here." "How do you resist all the ice cream? I'd have an even bigger belly."   These were mostly from men... Wait. I think majority of them (if not all) we're from middle aged dudes (white mostly as well). Context: I was 6'1" and 150 at the time.   I did however get comments from my family all the time. Especially around 18 and 19.   Worst of all, I have debilitating medical issues. But cause im tall and thin everyone asks if i play basketball or volleyball. Then if i say no i get some degree of shamed for it! Like. First off, i don't have to tell you shit about my hobbies. Second, any reason is a 'good' reason to not play a sport or do something. Me being disabled does not make it "okay" to skip on sports. TALL PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TO BE ATHLETIC. ESPECIALLY TALL GIRLS.   So much of my dysphoria comes from being tall and afab and everyone wanting tall girls to step on them and crush them. Assuming that every tall person is automatically strong. When we are actually more likely to have joint problems and chronic pain issues!   Bottom line. Just dont comment on people's weight or how much they eat. You have no idea what's going through their mind and your "funny" or "helpful" comments can really hurt someone.   (Fat shaming is bad. Period. I recognize the struggle of fat individuals, especially afab, in the healthcare field and how discriminatory it is towards y'all. It's bad and stupid and wrong. Yall deserve so much more. Keep being you 🧡)
Felt
I don't think any can da e but street dancers
I think the dancing thing might just be a race thing I don’t know if a single white personality that can dance
As a skinny person, I understand
The only problem out of all those I have and had as a skinny boy is the getting told to eat more and the belt thing because my waist is 27 inches however I fixed this by getting a grip6 belt or rather stealing it from my brother when he moved out they are eternally adjustable they don't wear and tear like regular belts and while I didn't buy it and it is pricey I still recommend getting one for my skinny boys who can't find a nice belt that's short enough
As man who is 6'8 and 180 pounds. I can assure you, these be some straight up facts.
Your adorable ❤I love u
Im also very skinny (sleeper build) and all of thies things are true
😢
I was 69(not even fkn kidding) pounds at age 11 and yea this all sucks but I’m a menace in crowds like it’s so easy to just walk around and slightly turn my body to squeez around
I’m an adult wearing a kids size Medium belt 💀
Same I'm 11 I feel you
Fucking King of groove over here saying she can't dance.
I can dance, but if i try to dress in tight-clothing (i.e. skinny jeans) it shows all my mistakes :(
#5 i get told all the time, im 13 and 89 pounds which is very small for my age but I’ve had some health issues which slowed down my eating and stopped me from gaining weight which isnt my fault.
Being skinny I can’t even grain weight no matter how hard I try I always stay around the same weight
I have all the same problems and when I was in dance as a kid the made me sit in the back and pat my knees so I didn’t get to dance
so THATS where my inability to dance came from.. smh i always wondered
We’ll atleast you ain’t got fat 🥷 problems
I did almost fly if the wind didnt give mercy that day 😊
Been on both ends of the spectrum due to eating disorders. People just need to mind their f-ing business! It’s like telling a person with cancer to get over it! 😖🤦🏻‍♀️
THE BELT THING THOO
Get one of those braided belts that you poke your thing into anywhere, they're great! And look quite good.
solved the clothes issue by making my own! never had a fit problem ever again❤
U look fine to me
I understand this completely.  Life goals
Nah skinny people can dance.😂😂😂😂 You just don't have rhythm
Bro I thought it's was normal for you ribs and elbows to hurt when skinny and the chair thing because I'm skinny to
Aye same
Nah 6 I can’t do and I ain’t skinny so yea also u killed it dont say u cant
You danced better than my stooped ass
1 2 and 3 happen to me and im over 200 pounds and fat as hell
I am fat, and sitting down hurts my ass bones.
I was so skinny and ate so much when I was in high school, people kept asking me if I had a tape worm or was sure if I didn't have one. 😅😅😅😅😅
So I'm 5 10 at 15 years old and I'm skinny but I weigh 70kgs is that normal I need to know
I’ve been skinny and I’ve been fat the latter is worse because you have to change a lifestyle for the rest of your life getting fat just involves eating more and moving less
6' 7" and skinny out here looking like slenderman
5’7 105lbs I really felt that sitting down gets your a$$ bones hurting. I’m school I’ll stand for like half of my classes instead of sitting down
Y is dis so true
as a fellow twig, i understand whole heartedly.
Haha I HATE the pants AND belt don't fit  issue... that is real. Until the day she died, my mother had to always make some comment about my butt crack showing even though I'd explained the problem to her a million times. "The store only SELLS low rise jeans. I CAN'T pull them up aby higher... No. A belt won't work you see because the belt goes right through the belt loops on the pants, which we've already established are too freakin low through no fault of my own!"  The day I heard mom pants were back in style was the second-best day of my life (next to my daughter's birth of course).  Also, to pre-emp people at college asking me any questions about whether I eat, I ALWAYS made it a point to pig out on the most fattening, unhealthy food I could find while in class. This surprisingly worked extremely well.
When universe gave you super power, but you don’t get it, or simply bragging about it..
As a person who lost a lot of weight this is true
I am the same (skinny as fuck) allway  have bin
Your dance moves r pretty solid
When you said the thing about being cold I was thinking oh I'm fat 😞
#relatable
I'd dance with you,  fun moves I see
I used to be skinny as hell when i took pills for adhd, i went off the meds and immediately gained weight. I prefer being pudgy over skinny ngl lol
Istg I eat normally, I do exercises that are supposed to gain weight, I try weight gaining diets, and still I’m 6’1 and can’t break 127 lbs
"I can't dance" mother- Separate prob dear 😂
The struggle is real
As a fat person with a dump truck ass, sitting also hurts for us. If we sit on something that isn't cushioned, our ass flesh will get compressed against our ass bones, effectively crushing our cheeks
I have been skinny as fuk to
I am also really skinny and like when I was younger, I used to be really really skinny so like one time I got the flu when I almost died because of it another weird thing is that whenever I go on the swing and I just decided to put my chest on the swing it hurts so bad and also like one of my friends asked me if she could call me bones because I’m so scared I said no and then she asked if she could call me skeleton and I said yeah
Thank you for full on describing me and you did it correctly
I'm skinny and tall 🙃, but people have noted that i give the best hugs.
dang i would hate to be skinny
I understand for I'm the same but dance pretty good
I’m like 70p pounds and I’m 13😂
Yeah, I don't eat a lot. My mother shames me a lot for it.
I’m 47 pounds I’m 8 your like 20 66pounds
U not being able to dance is not because of your size lol!
this video explained me and number five still happens to me
Sitting down is a pain
ME TOO OMG
Thank you... I got pulled to the side by multiple teachers and students. "You annerexic. Are ypur parents starving you" i have a mastetablism leave me alone
i’d get jiggy with you on the dance floor 💃 💃
Clothes bruhh...clothes!!..You end up becoming close friends with tailors 😭😭😂
I’ll donate u half my fat if you want.
I can relate. The only reason I put on any weight at all is because I've hit the age where all men have a bit of a gut unless they work out an insane amount. I *still* have issues with the shorts I wear though.
Skinny problem: I look like the walking dead
I was also super skinny most of my life, and I couldn't STAND how adults would just ask me why I'm so skinny. Like "leave me alone you just ruined my day by commenting on how skinny I look I look normal to me" is the description of what I felt. I get that they were worried since I'm a girl and I was like 13? When they'd ask that but it felt awful I literally am a picky eater and I can't stand it when I'm forced to eat when I feel full. Also: I was skinny but my weight was normal so don't worry about that. So yeah never say something like that to a kid just because they're skinny you might make them insecure or dislike you 'cause who are you to judge how their body looks.
nah you fkn got that last part dude
As a person who weighs about 80 pounds. I confirm that this is all true
That last one was a Personal. F%$&ing. Attack! XD
Do you know that there is another secret solution????? Yes and it is called     exercise!! Sound familiar?
Are you really being a crybaby.
Well dancing has nothing to do with being skinny. But, you should get your hormones checked. Particularly those associated with hunger and digestion. Changed my life!
Since my belt never fits, I wear my 3-year-old brother’s belt.   *I can still max out on that* 💀
she is like the tall skinny model
"We have no insulation" XD true though
Imagine looking through your neighbors window and you just see jayus dancing their heart out
I'm a heavy guy and I assure you if I sit for more than 30 minutes my ass hurts too it aint about being skinny
I've had to poke new holes in my belt
I have never related to a video more
Dude I'm skinny as fuck to and it's all true
That last one is a Condition of being white. I know this because I'm white
I have the opposite problem I’m too heavy so I get hot really really fast. Why is it so hard to lose weight?😭
The struggle is real. I was once told by a relative "if you lose any weight, you'll fall through your asshole and hang yourself"
Ehh I'd still smash
So I'm a teen that has been skinny my whole life and I HATE the society one, people just forget that we do eat, actually a lot.
based off the first points i think i’m skinny
This is also my life
Being skinny ain’t got anything thing. Too do with bad dancing. 😂😂😂
“I cant dance” *Proceeds to dance better than me*
Lmao same thank you
I feel your pain bella
THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!!!!!!! I FEEL IT.
Yeah and i have tall ppl problems My bed is to Small i (allmost)can’t run and Even if i get op to running speed i Can only run for like 6 secends,and i need to eat A LOTE of food
I’ve also been skinny like my entire life
Well, you dance better than me...
So that's why I can't dance!😮
I’ve been both sides. Skin and bone pre kids. The second trimester I started gaining weight for the first time ever. My sons now 20 I can’t get below a size 18 (uk size). Both have issues on your day to day life and how you see yourself in the mirror
Stoppp I had to hole punch my belt, and my mom literally held me outside cos she said I was gonna fly away 😂😭😂
The belt one is so relatable😭
I got this a lot as a kid so I understand the problem as a skinny person
IM SKINNY TOO AND YES I DO GET COLD FAST IT SUCKS
dont blam being skinny your reson of not being able to dance gowrl
Ah that high metabolism life. Even in my mid 30s I can shut down an all you can eat easily. Still wake up the next day and not gain a pound.   Ive been saying for the last 15 years "this will be the year it all slows down and catches up to me" and life laughs.
for the straight skinny girls, that pelvic bone is killing your boyfriend. and most white people cant dance...or cook.
Why is this so damn relatable
I've bought myself a tool that you can use to make holes into belts, that look like they're supposed to be there
Not being able to dance is a you problem 😂😂
OMG the eating thing!!!! I had a doctor who didn't know about why I'm skinny call me malnourished and it messed me up so much
I was fat my whole life and then I lost almost 90 pounds in a year and a bit and the sitting down thing freaked me out so much. Like sitting down just became so uncomfortable overnight. I fucking hated it. And another bone thing that freaked me out was hitting my hip bones on something hurt like a motherfucker suddenly too.
thx i am then same i needed that thx jays
Hey I'm skinny as fuck to
This is happening  to me right now
For belts, I like the woven belts that you just poke in between because no one notices that the belt is not supposed to fit
I'm skinny and I have a condition that makes it so I can eat a lot of food but still stay skinny
I feel you me the same way but I got to dance
“Your belt doesn’t fit?!” Dude same!! I’ve had one belt and it’s fit for a year and now I have to poke new holes in the damn thing!! I just hit 103 pounds then I lost it when I got sick again!!! Dx (I am sick so damn often and none of my doctors can figure out why 😩)
I feel you
Same
I am a skinny person and I went to universal and went on the Jurassic park ride for my birthday… I almost fell on the escalation before the drop 3 times
As a skinny guy who is so fucking tall I can relate (I’m 6ft 5in)
Not being able to dance is not a skinny person problem it's a not very social person problem.
As someone who had girls shots taken away from them at like 13 siblings call it to buy for like when you sit down on wood or concrete or cement and it kills your ass and her chest even if you're laying on your own mattress you know I can you completely cuz I've been are on the same you know I've been trying to gain a naturally and I'm still not
I broke my arm while going 3 miles an hour in my roller blades, I weigh 118. Htf
You just explained me I'm 11 and really skinny an ummm I only way 51 or 52 pounds
did everyone forget what she did
Have you ever fallen into the toilet?
all of these are true
Are you kidding me? You're going to b**** about being skinny and not trying. I'm happy you're healthy now, but come on. You can do better, obviously. You know, people have issues that they can't control. I appreciate your advice, but it's unwarranted.... I would love to see your explanation if you had p c o s And put on a ton of weight and extra body hair to no control of your own, but I mean, that's no issue right? Being skinny is the issue. How hard is it to be skinny?
finally a video about thisssss omg YES
I can relate
Your only skinny in amercia
Finally! Someone who acknowledges skinny n tall people can’t dance! We’re so big and lanky and awkward! 😅
Are you sure it's because your skinny that you can't dance but I feel your pain I can't dance either
I got cancer watching her dance
This skeleton dance 💀 was enoght for my🥒
Yes me too girl
That dancing is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.
I know
As a skinny man let me say respectfully That last one is not a skinny problem
I can't imagine crying about someone calling you skinny and telling you to go eat  Why is it so hard to just fucking ignore people lol
cold swimming pools are teh worst
I'm a 6 foot tall male. I weight 165 one heavy day. I understand all those skinny problems. I always found it weird that's it's not okay to make fun of fat people, but when people tell me I look malnutritioned, it's okay. I also do BJJ and used to do mma. I had to fight at 135. Which if you know anything about mma is a really light weight class for a male standing 6 foot. And no matter how much I eat, I just don't seem to gain weight. Only in the last couple years have I gained confidence no matter what people say or who's around. I'm 30 now and got that confidence when i was about 24. I hope you are not struggling still mentally with how much fucked up shit people get away with saying to us just because we are skinny.
I can agree with you
M the same way, but I have the ability to dislocate my shoulder on command lol
i feel you bro
Oooooohhhh the dance is smoother than butter
Same and i can't lay on my side🥲
As a fellow skinny person I can relate to all but the cold thing. I have a special thing that makes my body more resistant to cold than the average human being. Can never remember the name though.
I can relate to that I am basically a skeleton
That end though lol
For number 5 just remember "We live in a society"
did the video start with you on the sink??????
I know how it feels😂
People doesn't realise that calling someone skinny is the same thing to call someone fat, I've allways been skinny and a lot of people told me  "you need to eat more" or "If you  don't eat you'll end up in the hospital" but If I dared to say something to someone fat they would all get mad.....😐
I wanna be skinny though
I’ve gotten the “you need to eat more!”  “it’s because you’re vegetarian” “are you sick?”  I don’t think they know how biology works 😭😅
I’m the exact same my whole family says I don’t eat when I eat a crap ton of stuff right I front of them
I can relate to this and I get made fun of and I can't dance either so I just embrace it and when my friends bring it up I just join in and make them FEEL my bones😂😂😂😂😂
Grass is always greener on the other side..
I think OnlyJayus had the best dance moves ever way better than me
She straight up just said go gain weight in 7 different  languages
“I CANT DANCE”   * pov: every kpop idol who literally eats nothing cause their companies dont let them, but they are still slaying on stage*
I am glad I am slightly overweight
Nailed it 100%
I relate to the alot
So sad :( having to be skinny darn.
No that's considered dancing😂
"Go eat a cheeseburger" is how my whole family greets me :,)
Skinny shaming is never talked about but it is real!!. I am a mother to two children and I am SKINNY! No one advocates for me, but here Jayus is. Killing it. Thank you!! Haha
So true
I am 5'4 and 110 pounds and must say this is all true
Has experienced every single one of these including the spacific comments
You lucky you skinny I was 6ft 1in over 300lb at 15yrs old now I'm 235,lb I was always heavy at 9yrs old I was 110lb I know playing Peewee football
Fr
😂 brus 60 lbs lighter than me and im 13
“I can’t dance!”  *proceeds to dance so much better than anyone (yes even THE Draco Malfoy) at the yull ball*
well, I am skinny, and I can dance maybe that's because I've been dancing my whole life.....
The belts one hit home😭
I think the dancing part doesn't really come from being skinny
I'm chubby and go through this
Thank you. It’s like everybody tells me to go eat meat like all I do is eat but I’m not getting nothing. They will never get it.
You can always dance better then me
For me it’s like  impossible to get wait so im like her
That is literally me cause am I SKINY
At the end of the video when you realise that tomorrow is the last day of school 💃🏼🕺🏼
Ive got a belt with holes on the whole thing so I don't need to poke holes in it anymore🙃
It's worse when you have to change with your friends but it's so funny to see them ask why they can see you ribs and spine
I remember when i was stuck in a neverending loop of being 64 to 65 pounds exclusively. Never any more and never any less. I ducking celebrated when i finally broke that record lmao. Still have high metabolism to this day, tho 😎✨️
The first one omggggg
I promise the dancing is entirely on you lmao
You poor thing.
Or how people automatically think it’s okay to just pick you up and comment how light you are
Was the 66 pounds???
Relate
Idk how but my whole childhood I was skinny af while eating more than most of the fat kids at my school.
I HAVE THE BELT PROBLEM AND SAME SKINNYNESS
Welcome to my life
I feel the pain im  80 pounds at 4 FUCKING TEEN
BRO DONT SAY YOU CANT DANCE, U GOT DA VIBEEES!
Man I feel you in this one, I’m 14 and 88 pounds male and I’ve got the tiniest writs you’ll ever see dude it sucks so bad I’m so insecure
im the same I can't get any meat on my bones and get cold every 5 min
sick dance moves
Yeah I’m skinny af especially for a 14 going on 15. All I hear is how my choices are terrible and that I should eat more but I feel like shit if I force myself to eat. I wonder if there’s something mentally going on but it’s obnoxious and my skinniness has made me very insecure and introverted
I see you as a boy and a girl it's just so good 😂
The last one has nothing to do with being skinny. That’s just a side effect of being white.   Before anyone gets mad, I’m also white so I can say that
In Germany, we call skinny people a 'Lauch', which just means Leek because Leeks are thin
Bro I get it then u have someone go ewww wtf is that as they hug u and feel ur spin.... yup I was one of those people looking like a Skelton  wearing skin
Yeah but the comments hurt😢😢😢😢
"I can't dance" *Literally dances better than anyone I know*
Not hate but if i were you i wouldn't like even say anything like i cant get skinny even a lil bit
You might not be able to dance, but you've got the balls to upload a video of yourself trying (and yes I see the irony saying YOU'VE got balls)
The theories are true white people really can't dance
I feel ya....
Ift on a personal level
I eat a lot and ppl still think I don't eat😂😅
“I can’t dance!” Thats a you problem
Same
Relatable 😂
I am quite skinny too so I relate to most of these
I’m skinny and tall, and honestly everyone at the school I used to go to always asked me why I’m so skinny and told me it’s literally so easy to gain wait- like not for everyone it’s so easy
She is the first woman to film herself on the scale
Can't dance my ass you can dance, I hate when people say that u need to eat or u need more meat of ur bones it's so annoying, I only say things like that to lightly tell my mom that my sister will eat then throw it up on purpose
Finally someone who speaks up for skinny people!!
This is all me
I was way below average until 6th grade and god this is relatable
you dance better than I can though.
My new response to "eat a burger" is to tell them to buy me one  😂
This is very relatable I was always skinny and people made skinny remarks that I didn’t weigh much all of these are true
I have a habit of getting cold when it's not cold. I am pretty skinny. I take very hot showers and in fall I dress like it's winter.
Bro you can dance better than me
Skinny person hack, get a belt that uses friction to hold itself in place, like d-ring belts. Also it's impossible to find pants with a small enough waist in the us
66 pounds wow you’re light I’m 145 and I’m 10
Another big one is people seem to think its ok to pick you up without permission simply because they can
Get a grip 6 belt. Not an ad, but they don't have holes.  I gain and lose weight a lot from illness and range from a 28" to a 32" waistline, and it's a godsend. >__>;
One time it was windy outside and the air almost took me I was not even touching the ground no more 😭😭😭
I love how, of all these, the only 2 that really apply to both ends of the weight spectrum are society, and "I CAN'T FUCKING DANCE RIGHT!"
Ik do u have any fixes I eat and can't gain lol
Aww poor baby i feel so bad for you that you metotabolism it too good and your a healthy weight. One day you will baloon.
Yeah whenever I lay down on my ribs it starts to hurt like hell
I had to mention this but I think u look SO gd good in that red bathing suit like I love the picture ❤
I have thick thighs disease so the chair one doesn't make sense to me
Holy f))k your that light Im 9 and I’m more
Girl those some good moves for someone who “can’t dance” you can just you think you can’t and you think your not good at it
Nah you can dance perfectly
EVERYONE is always telling me I'm skinny, then i EASILY at just a normal meal eat 2x more
I know ist hard 😢❤ but almost we are happy 😊
Last ones on you dont blame em bones
I feel this
Onlyjayus: I can't dance Also onlyjayus: *starts dancing*
I can't complain about skinniness if you're the prime example.
As a skinny person I think this is.... 100% accurate
𝕀 𝕙𝕒𝕧𝕖 𝕥𝕠 𝕕𝕖𝕒𝕝 𝕨𝕚𝕥𝕙 𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕥𝕠𝕠
If you think us heavy folk can dance your mostly incorrect but we're good at sit'in down let me tell ya that Edit: i didnt realise i previualy comented on this before with backstory damn
6ft 1 here, and this is painfully accurate 🙄
I'd rather have skinny girl problems than fat girl problems. My ankles hurt, I have no energy and they say boobs are floatation devices but they are not.
U literely explained my whole ass life in under a minute we.. Aaaaaaaaaah!
I need to introduce you to stresseating
Bad dancing ain’t cause you’re tooo skinny….. it’s lack of rhythm and self confidence. As for pants falling down., get suspenders… they have soooo many that it can help with your lack of style
My dad and sister wants to fatten me up for Thanksgiving because of how I'm skinny to
Boohoo get real problems
One time in middle school, I had just moved to a brand new Science class, my principal was a teacher that science class (I went to a small school) anyways we were doing a science experiment on pushing pole. She put me the latest kid in the class up against the wall next to another kid, who was quite on the heavier scale. Without warning she pushes me over, and then she tried pushing the other kid over I fell over, hit my head against the wall and she goes see how someone who’s a lot lighter falls over easily compared to someone who is heavy. Later, on that day, I got chased around by one of the boys in the class who kept pushing me over continuously, saying wow, you really are light. You really should do something about that skeleton no one did anything about it except for one of my friends all my other friends sat on the side and watched. later on a teacher finally stepped in, and I will forever love that teacher for that, because all the teachers and all the students sat to the side except for one teacher, and one student. Anyway, that’s my most traumatizing story of being an underweight girl.
Bet yo ass can see ur feet and touch them
I don't think i have deeply related to anything like this for a while
My mom, my mom’s aunt and my grandmother have all said you need to get more meat on your bones also my grandma has said I don’t understand how you can eat and eat but nothing shows
These the same problems if you're overweight with some slight differences 😂  Singing down hurt your ass cuz the seats too hard and you're too heavy  Laying on your stomach sucks because you can't breathe  You get hot so fast that almost every normal temperatures is uncomfortable  The rest are almost verbatim  We all have our own issues some issues we may share with others and some are entirely personal. As long as you are working on it then there should be a problem with it. Although there are quite a lot of vain people in this world unfortunately
Na... the dance thing... that's on you not on being skinny
Bro you look a little bit like me also the things in the video are true and I think I'm skinner than you
I put a hair tie on my pants😂
THE ASS ONE OH MY GOD OTS SO TRUE
Lucky I’ve been fat my whole life 😢
If you are skinny, you will find you have bones in places you never knew. I fell going UP THE STAIRS (clumsy af) and landed on my HIP BONE and had a bruise FOR TWO WEEKS.
I hate the comments people give(mostly my family) but I can’t get myself to tell them to stop
Wait did that say 66 I’m 13 and I’m 88 and people call me short and skinny so ummmmmm how
I completely feel you so so true 😂
I agree
Seggsy
I have the same thing
i struggle with all of this every fucking day, and its because of my high ass metabolism. i eat about 10 times a day AND IM STILL FUCKIN SKINNY BECAUSE HIGH FUCKING METABOLISM
I’m skinny and short and I agree with everything you just said
Me too
I radiate heat nonstop
No offense at all, but you dance the way I imagine a slinky would
Learn how to breakdance. Then we talk.
I can relate to all of these
Back in the 80s my friend in junior high school. She's super skinny and she's still thin and tall. Well I told her why don't you go run around in the shower to get wet. Well that pissed her off😅 I was getting her back for something she did to me just for reference. We're still friends to this day😊
Also my family gets flabbergasted when I can hold my ribs
Follow my diet for a week and your skinny problem will cease to exist since I eat double than the average American
I feel u my family says I'm skinny too
The last dance move looks like a gecko climbing up a wall
cut the whole video. just put in the dance part
I’m am the same 😢
I can't dance... proceeds to kill it Jim Carey style
I went from real fat to real skinny super and really got that "grass is always greener" shit through my head real fast
I’m not even skinny but I’ve literally felt all of these
Omg this reminds me so much of myself  You can literally call me a line and it would be true but not all straight
"I can't danc", bro you can dance better than I ever will 💀💀💀💀💀
Being skinny is superb
My brother is 69.1 and he is 9
One time my grandma asked me if i was going to throw up as i got up to go to the bathroom during dinner
Or when people assume because your skinny it means your fit, i can't even run a half mile😂
Really? 🧌
Speaking of this situation I rarely see this cousin of mine but he was skin and bone you could literally see his shoulder blade
This is so fucking relatable
I can’t and I have never met a person who can
bro im at a private school at canada, and sure i dont have as much money as the others but at lunches i dony rrl eat and they ask me if im to poor to buy me smt to eat😭 like bro- and someone gave me money to buy me food💀😭😭😭😭
i cant believe i can actually relate to something in social media for once, its really hard to be skinny and when you express it, mostly as a teen other girls tell me "wth are u talking about i wish i had your body"  all i can think is.. no you dont wish that trust me-
I am a year later this but same
As a fat man... Ok
This is what my parents do to me and the thing is, I eat as much as my brother and he is in football and he is15. my parents have not realized that I don't gain weight 😢 and I am 14🥲 And all of these are true
OKAY THE COLD ONES PRETTY ACCURATE and the " get some meat on those bones"
Then there are us bigger people and just start dancing and our body fat just started taking over just jiggling
It's summer me in a hoodie 😐
I think ive found the best comfort AND relatable youtuber ever
can we trade bodies and then u do some wikipedia acts on it, make it thinner, then switch back? asking for a friend..
Me being chunky and young  Huh well I guess I should eat more lol
Finally someone knows
I weigh 50 lb and girl you're skinny
I can’t dance either and I’m fat
I felt this
I relate to this so much
I am not very skinny but that is basically how I dance 😂😂😂😂😂
I can relate to ALL IF THIS.
Lift heavy stuff
Cause you’re white
As a skinny person (6ft tall and weigh 100 pounds) I approve these statments
She just has a high metabolism like me
So true 😢😢😢
Bro, same!
It's so bad for me. Not only because you can count all my ribs through my back and I eat 3 kilograms of sugar every week, but I do all the lanky-person workouts. I don't do squats, I run, I don't bench, I do pullups, I don't do squats, I do Nordic curls. WHENEVER I DO BENCH OR SQUATS, IDIOTS GO "Oh only 105 lbs?" NOOOO! One Grayson.
THE BELT NEVER FITS. I GOTTA POKE NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT THREE EXTRA HOLES IN IT
You dance better than me tho 😂
I'm short and skinny so I'm always the baby in the friend group even tho I'm the oldest. 🙄
I am so skinny too I see my rib’s
This literally explains my whole life😅
Me: *little skinny kid* Mom: Eat something for God's sake
story time: so im skinny and my grandma ,skate teacher and one of my friend makes fun of me for it so that friend was like aww your so cute cause like im younger than her so then she said i wanna squize you but you will break in half i bet you can't even hit me so i did and she was like oww and her arm was hurting soo bad oh and this reminds me of the time i slapped on of the boys in my class cause idk i got dared to and i littarly made him almost cry and i left a red handmark on him but it went in a couple of minutes but for some reason he still calls me weak so i remind him of this😂
I CANT EAT BC OF FAST METABOLISM
If this isn't Accurate
I hate belts.... I ALWAYS had that problem. And then I got a belt that was weaved so it was like made of holes.
I’m kinda skinny and I’m young and people calling me a twig really affects my confidence
I feel you
They said I needed to eat potatoes and meat and guess fucking what I still skinny as fuck and everything you just said is true
I feel you
I know I have the same problem. I have a healthy weight. But people think i gang 1 pound.
The 5th one is probably why I went from skinny to fat in the span of a few months 💀💀💀
The inability to dance has nothing to do with your weight. Everyone knows white people can't dance for sh*t 😂
Nah cause I used to get told as joke “Lets tie you down to something so the wind doesn’t blow you away.” By my parents-
I have an older brother super skinny too but he can dance we saw him throw it back during a party
I still wish i was skinny
My grandpa always had the RUDEST COMENTS he thought they were funny but he would say like ur all legs and ur so skinny u could fit under a cloths line and not get wet in rain like wow people r so harsh and even when they don’t realize it there body shaming
Being skinny only comes with the perk of being cuddleable and fitting in extremely small spaces
so true
I agree with all of this
Another problem l, it might just be me, but laying on my side makes me feel really self conscious because my stomach goes to the side idk
The way your way older than me and I weigh 150 pounds 💀
I am skinny and have been I have though’s problems and I can still dance wooo
this makes me less insecure for sum reason °0º
Oh… this is why I’m always cold. How has this reasoning never accord to me?🤣😭
But also 100ds of thousands of peaple want to be like that.   You are loved and amazing
I can agree w this as a skinny person,my ENTIRE family told me to get more meat on my bones at my age I was confused and thought they meant to carry around LITERAL MEAT
That last one though, you can definitely dance. You got the moves
Same with me
Can relate to most especially the bruised ribs
So fat people are better?
I am on the opposite side of the spectrum, and I also, can not dance. And sitting does indeed hurt my assbones-
I know right like I do eat and I get cold af
im skinny too, cant go above 103 pounds… and i’ve been called “anorexic”… it hurt but im a normal weight for my age but because of my height i have a low bmi (body mass index)
Bro just fucking boogie bombed us 💀
I'm 6'2, but I'm at 33% body fat 251 pounds. Are there any tips?? I wanna be 150
That's why I hate pants!! They never fit and I can't even use the belt because there are never enough holes!
I do dancing so whenever we're doing warmup sometimes we have to do situps and my tailbone gets brutally murdered trying to sit up each time 😭
Girl you dance better than I will ever will
OML THAT MY FAMILY THERE ALWAYS SAYING: DO U EVEN EAT? LIKE IM NOT EVEN THAT SKINNY IM NORMAL-
Bro im skinny as can be and im always FREEZING and now I know why I also showed this to my cousin cuz she's like " Why are you always so cold?" and im like " I dont know!!"  She is also always like "ur not healthy." And im like "Actually I am healthy I way about 90 pounds and im an 11 yr old" im just REALLY skinny and I dont eat healthy all I really eat is chicken nuggets, fries, pizza and like Chocolate and chips like thats it so I dont know why im so skinny maybe its bc I barely eat at all but IM NOT FRICKING HUNGRY! like bro  I only eat like  today all I ate was like 12 mini pancakes (there a lot smaller then u think) for brunch and 4 mozzarella sticks  for dinner and a cupcake for dessert. And bro my like 13 yr old uncle roasted me bc of how short and how I have like no muscle  and im like just skin and bone  (Im actually not THAT short for a 11 yr old im like 4'11) cuz my cousin asked  " would you rather be Raelynns size or Owens size  ( he's my 15 yr old uncle who is kinda fat (NO OFFENSE)) and he's like "... Definitely Owens size cuz Raelynns has like no muscel and she is basically just skin and bone." And im like ":O bro your so mean." So theres some life info nobody asked for :D
It's even worse if you're tall, then it includes horrible back pain😂
Was like that till middle school it sucked and you can’t do anything about it.
Smallest belt size dont fit? Me having to get the smallest size belt i can find and poking 11 more holes in it so they dont fall down😂
I'm not THAT skinny but i relate A FUCKING LOT to the 2nd and 6th problem
For the terraria fans out there. When i drink alkohol, i become a tinsy bit zesty. One of my nicknames is skeletron pride😐
i think u look adorable when u dance!!
Bro what do u mean u can’t dance that is some fire dancing
Being told like that as a kid RUINED my perception of my body image even as an adult it still makes things difficult 💀
When I was little there was this OLD LADY that worked at my SCHOOL and she would make comments on how skinny I was. I also had DIABETIC problems that didn’t make it any better. When I told her, she said I was LYING I tried to ignore her and started eating healthier but I just decided to become a vegetarian STILL, after all that she still didn’t stop messing with me and when the school tried to stop and I’m grateful but it hurts to think about what things people say to KIDS
did you play basketball?
At least you can wear jeans
What a flipping minute she played basketball 🏀 now that lit
I can relate
We’ll just saying being bigger is not better at Al you get made fun of a lot more get called the fat kid when people try to rhyme with your bame they will slip in something about being bigger half of the time your clothes don’t fit because they don’t for around your hips you can’t wear anything that shows your stomach because most people are in secure and then when your friends come over that are skinnier and borrow a shirt or shorts they like wow this is big or your older sister comes in because she wants an oversized hoodie and there are many more problems to being bigger that skinny so don’t complain about being skinny because a lot of people would rather be skinny
You shouldn’t complain about being skinny because there is so much more problems of being bigger
What do you mean you can’t dance. Best moves of the past ♾ year and will be the best dancer ever to live
OK listen here I am skinny I can dance you not being able to dance is a you problem. I said those comments were very mean to her as a kid
I’ve been 120 for years!!!
You can be shamed for being fat, you can be shamed for being skinny- it can go both ways and both are harmful
extactly
Yeah. This is my life too.
man not being able to dance is my problem not a skinny person problem
FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS 😭
66.7 lbs is AVERAGE???
Who says you can’t dance
it’s still easier than being fat
Access denied: I don't eat, I don't sleep, I only shake when I yarn, I can sleep for 32 hours, I don't get hungry.... so on
I have a fat ass and still feel my bones touch the chair.
ALL OF THIS. YES.
bro i’m literally the same way and the most annoying part like yku said is when people are like just eat more like wtf dude it’s not that easy
I also have to deal with that
Being tall and skinny myself, I can confirm the truth of this.
just wear to belts but not like a gunslinger
6'4"  145lbs. I usually eat 2-3 serving sizes of food for each meal every day, and then some snacks between meals so that my stomach doesn't ache and growl until the next meal. I have a VERY high metabolism. Yes, I'm skinny, but my fucking food budget is thru the roof. I would regularly go to bed hungry as a kid with said aches and growls when trying to sleep, because my mom never made more food.
I CAN RELATEEEEE 😭 AND NO IM GAINING WEIGHT TOO MUCH LIKE HELP WHAT
did we all just have the same family friends??? they all fluffing said that to me all the time!!
3 is so troow!!!
i relate so much!!! the comments i get :(
she really busted down the craziest moves ever and thought we would t notice.
skinny gang
‘I can’t dance’ *proceeds to dance better than I can*
People randomly picking you up to see how light you are and not putting you down, I got very good at breaking people's grips
I relate so much wtf
My sister is skinny but you get the most whoopings😢😢
Wearing skiis in the shower to stay out of the drain.
I think I have just as much problem dancing
As someone thats skinny I relate to all of this I hate it when people say that especially my family it makes want to go in a room and cry
Nah Thea’s ass one is true
I have wide hips and ribs so I look chunky but I get bruises on my ribs and hips if I lay down -.-
at least someone understands the struggle. it’s not just as easy as saying “eat more”
Not dancing isn’t just a skinny people problem  It’s a me problem        * proceeds to dab*
Oh yeah 5) gave me an ED 👍 Also. People just pick you up. Idc if they were my friends. I did not consent to be picked the fuck up.
Literally me and still skinny
Fr🥲
it's straight body disphoria because everyone says something that you just begin to wish you could put weight on
It sucks because I’m SHORT and TOO SKINNY so nothing fits me or just looks horrible on me ☹️☹️☹️☹️
this is very relateable for me since I infact lose wieght when I eat.... from lifting the fork to my mouth
Bro that is literally my life
Why do  i feel like someones gonna say"oh yeah work it"😂😂😂😂😂
I have all these except for 5
I’ve always been in a relatively healthy weight range (I say “relatively” because I was underweight for a little bit recently) but I’ve also always had really bad body image issues. In fifth grade, I started “sucking in my gut,” and I still do it to this day (I’m in high school now and I can’t stop 😭). It’s caused permanent damage to the positioning of my abdominal muscles and organs (it’s a thing called “Hourglass Syndrome”) and I too experienced sharp pains whenever I lay down, whether in my rips, my tail bone, or my backbone). Moral of the story, to anyone with horrible body image issues, this is what not to do.
I have the same problem
I relate to this so much😭
I love this but me too
Try being fat it is way harder dumbass
Why are you 64 pounds?!?!?!?!
Bro I got called barbie bc I was so skinny 💀
I'm also quite smol
I rarely ever went shirtless because people would comment on how skinny i was. It's just as bad as fat shaming people.
I feel you😂😂
Yaaas queen
Skinny ass bones
Girl just called me fat in 2,000 different ways 😭✋
Leaning against a wall hurts my shoulder blades
5 is so true tho um only like 90 pounds😭 i have never been over 100 and thats coming from a 12 year old
I know
HOW ARE YOU THE SAME WEIGHT AS MY 9YR OLD KID?
Same same & same
As someone who's been on both sides of this, people tend to be nicer to me about my weight when I was slightly overweight then when I was slightly underweight.
same here
The dance is a personal problem and for the society BOOO HHHOOOO INGORE THEM AND WALK ON!
Let’s groove tonight is the worst dance for us skinny people … WE LOOK LIKE A WET SPAGHETTI NOODLE.
As a person who is trying to stay skinny my whole life I envy you
HELP THIS IS TOO RELATABLE- This is just me in a nutshell tho :,)
What's worse is being skinny and tall, so you have no coordination at
I can relate to all of them the comments are the worst ❤❤
The worst part is not being able to make any threats cuz they’re like “you skinny you can’t do anything” may as well be fat and sit on them
That's what's nice about being fat lol
I mean, yes, I am the skinny person for eternity
I can relate to every single one of these. Nobody understands how difficult certain things are.
I swear recently my butt bones hurt when i sit on hard seats
Not being able to dance isn’t just a skinny person problem. I think that’s just a huge problem. I’m kidding I’m kidding. I love you.
It is the same as me...skinny as a SKELETON
A for effort
YESSS THANK YOU FOR SHOWING PPL THAT SKINNY PPL HAVE PROBLEMS TOO
Same
So relatable. i eat the most but im the skinniest out of my friend group
I weigh seventy pounds, my friends weigh 100. This is relatable.
My friend‘s skinny and she starts sweating when it‘s 15*C
That some good dancing 😅
This is pretty fucking relatable since I was really skinny when I was a child
The fifth one if so relatable
Everyone tells me that I'm so skinny, yet I can dance lol, but you killed it😎
“I CARNT DANCE!” .dances. wins world record for best dancer
GORLY me to me to
Once I got blow over
i think the daceincg is just a you problem
Why is this so true 💀
I feel you I also am skinny tiny person so I feel you
Very very relatable 🎉
so true
YOU'RE REALLY ANOTHER COLBY BROCK VERSION
The jeans omg the jeans never fit and always look too loose on my body,the only option is low waisted jeans
This is so true as a skinny person I can relate 😢
Z don’t say you can’t dance that was a really amazing dance
I hold an umbrella I could become marry poppins
Thank you very much. I’m 5’7 and 120 lbs. recently my mom started losing weight and now she talks about how much her butt hurts when she sits down. She looked at me and said “is how you’ve always felt”. Also those are the best dance moves I’ve ever seen.
My “friends” take turns putting their hands around my wrists and saying I'm skeletal 😀
Atleast I know I'm not the only one 😢
This is me, exactly the same. I'm always the one whose cold and I can't even kneel on the ground cuz it hurts my knee caps
Hi that's me execpt i can dance
THANK YOU, FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT
bro this video makes me rethink being overweight
THANK YOU
Can’t dance? You got the moves🎉
i am 15, 5'8, and 94 pounds. hella relatable
Grew up skinny with a big butt. Clothes either fit my butt or my waist and had to ALWAYS poke holes in belts. I feel you Jayus.
i feel this i can put my self in a tight spaces
Don't fell bad I can't dance either
I truly know exactly how you feel Sometimes I even need to poke new holes in my shoe straps😂❤
My poor sister, she said I give great hugs, while when I hug her it feels like lying on a needle bed 😂 harmless but definitely uncomfortable. It’s worth it if she likes the hugs though!
I UNDERSTAND THE FUCKING STUPIDITY OF THIS SHIT I HATE BEING TO SKINNY
That’s me right there
Skinny is the perfect body type for dancing just look at Michael Jackson he wanted to be skinny so his dance moves could look more precise and sharp
Im sorry i dont mean this as hate but no. 6 isnt a skinny problwm is a white problem 😭
I deal with all these problems especially being cold and sitting. Weight situation when i was 8 until i was 14 i was flat 80 pounds qnd couldnt gain. My doctors was concerned if i would live to adulthood.  Now im 138 pounds and im so happy to say it. I cant dance to save my life either lol but i relate to all of it but if i lay on my stomach i just have trouble breathing 😊
13 year old boy 90 pounds my ribs poke out
Dance moves 10/10  skiddi toilet
That belt thing, that got me.
Reletable
I get it people gave me extra peace’s of food and said I needed it
The cannot dance is white people issues
Belts.. Pants… SINCE I WAS FRICKIN FOUR!   Both have been an hassle- so the fact you get it- heavy relief I ain’t alone on that!
Good lord 6’4” 130lbs I’ve heard every single one plus the “did you play basketball”
Same 😅
Me a  kid also  girl  seeing this makes me sick to see people like you skinny but not being happy whith yourself im fat as fuck😥😢😭😓😖🥺 and i pray  that i could be as pretty as  you or just pretty and you just can never trust anyone  to not pick on you or talk behind your back so you wont have any friends i have not had a true friend since kindergarten  and being  soo flipping  insecure makes you dout your self soo much  mom if you see this im sorry .thank you for your time onlyjayus i really  want you to see this
I feel ya. I'm like 5ft. 10in. And only weigh like 130 lbs.
Go eat a backyard, bacon ranch from dairyqueen. with fries, cheese, curds, and a Reese’s peanut butter cup large blizzard. That’ll fix it.
Omg I have thale same problem, also I ordered your awaken book, If you haven't you should.
I can relate as a skinny person
Hey Jayus- so I’ve been a little thicker all my life and I’ve always gotten picked on for it. That’s a big factor of how I got into sh. You seem like such a kind and confident person, can you make a video on how to block out the comments and how to stop getting those thoughts?
bro the belt thing is so relatable, like i dont even get belts that have holes anymore since its annoying to have to put new holes in them
I relate so much. 145 soaking wet at 6'0 and being a guy... shit sucks
Ngl actually does not dance to bad 😂
When I was a bit younger (I think 11-12) I was under the first percentile with my weight my mom switched to high protein foods for me and now I’m 88lbs (about 5’2-5’3) still very under but it’s gotten better! If you try your hardest to get better you can always reach your goal <33
i feel this so much!!!!
My daughter is very skinny and she loves being skinny yes she does eat very good
Omg yes I was swimming in 70 degree water a while ago and I was shivering so much that I had to get out… That really sucked
I am so skinny but somehow managed to make it on a dance team and stay on it for 3 years and I am currently still with the dance studio ❤
Lol, finally someone has experienced the same problems as me, being skinny is so weird to deal with lol
As an 80lbs 15 I would have to say that this is accurate
blame dancing on your weight? Forgot to mention "I can't cook because I'm so darn  skinny."
I can’t dance either it’s not just skinny people and everything else is also true for fat people
Almost nobody can dance
The dancing got me rolling on the floor😂😂
Okay but really, EVERYONE ASKS IF I EAT WHENEVER I WEAR TSHIRTS OR SHORTS LIKE OF COURSE I EAT DUDE WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?? A GODDAMN PLANT??
I still wish I was skinny :l
This is the most I’ve ever related to a video.
Im a big guy and the first two are the same and i cant dance either
As a 5’0 90 pound child I concur
belt rubbing ur hip bones, poke a new hole in it? yeah let me take my belt off in public, see how that goes lol
The skinny troubles, that I am apart of ❤….
This make me feel better thx
Me to girl I can eat a hole cake and not gain a pound ne too
As someone who was 60lbs till I was in 6th grade, now going to 8th, I just wanna say I feel this
I love tiny women
You are so relatable🥹😂 i was always skinny shamed and still am. I’m 15 years 5’3 height and weigh 42 kilograms. My weight has been the same since 6th grade😅
So many people keep calling me anorexic because all my bones are very clear and I can't put on weight easily....I hate this society's norms
Nice dancing tho
As a certified skinny bastard, this is correct
Ffffffffffffffffŕrrrrrrrrrrrrr😂😂😂
im rilly sking and get all of thous things all the time
Chilllllld same
You can dance, you just need some more practice. Your great at dancing I’m serious
Bro I think you're just bad at dancing.
The belt part is sadly accurate. I have to do that with my belts
Are you sure that you can’t dance because there were some pretty good dance moves?
This is so true though!
Got told if I ate a pea I'd look pregnant and if I punched a guy he'd go to E.R. with stab wounds. 😂 this from my 9th grade science teacher.
I was skinny a child, and yeah, especially the last one about putting meat on your bones, it hurt me. Cause then I started eating a shit tone more, and well I gained weight, now people tell me to loose weight
I feel ur pain lol
I know how you feel I’m skinny
“OMG YOUR SO SKINNY! DO YOU HAVE AN EATING DISORDER?” me: tf- no im just skinny
ya...
OMG and the thing is I can't get thicker CUZ MY MATABALIZAM IS TOO DAM FAST
Poking new holes in my belts all the time is so true x-x I usually stick to chain belts or the ones with the two holes all down it so I don’t have to do all that lol
Me struggling to gain weight to be "healthy", like, how do people expect me to gain 10-20kg?and I swear if one more person ask if I eat/get fed at home I'm gonna scream
Last one isn’t a skinny problem. Ain’t even a problem bro you killing it 😎
On got
I'm skinny and I am the best dancer in my school
brooooo omg I got this like all the time and everyones like why are you cold? idk I just am :D
I feel you on that one Jayus
im sorry but the last one is a skill issue
Grew up with a friend with a metabolism like yours as a kid. (Mine is the opposite). His has slowed down as he got older, but he had all of these issues, plus having to eat like a maniac to just maintain an almost healthy weight. He would go through a fridge in a night and still have his ribs showing. It was really bad in our 20s as roommates, trying to afford to eat, and people would still make those comments to him.   When we were in Middle School, I was definitely jealous, given I had my own issues with weight and food, but never said stuff like that. When he said what he was going through, it was pretty clear it was a legitimate issue, not something to be dismissed or joked about. It sucks that people said that to you.
Wait skinny people can't dance????? SO KPOP IS A LIE????
Not sure what skinny has to do with dancing
Relate to all of these
I will literally stand for hours before i sit in a hard chair
Holy shit I never thought to poke new holes in my belt
I’m sorry jayus but I think your inability to dance might be a separate problem
REALLLL
I would invite her to my party
as a skinny adhd kid i hate my assbones hurt and I CANT STAND STILL idk why im skinny i litterraly ate an entire extra large domminos pizza that was ment to server 4
"I hAvE fAsT mAtAbOlISm" as the mf eats nothing in the morning, during school, and finally eats some some chips and doesn't finish the bag -my skinny ass friend
I relate to these 😂 except it’s not just my ribs it’s the bones that stick out on my hips
A bunch of time people have told me that “I need to eat” or that “I’m anorexic” and even “it would be so easy to k!dnap you you’re so skinny that i could just pick you up” and it’s fucking wrong
I don't think your weight has anything to do with your dancing.
Omg! I never knew you lied to your viewers until the last one😢
So relatable! Especially the comments from people 😭
Yup it's that
Finally someone says something
I'm overweight so I have to wear clothes over what size I'm supposed to. Also I got judged for chubbiness. It doesn't help that my family is short on both sides.
Yep sounds like my life 😂 I finally started working out and eating more, and now I'm having fat issues 😂😂😂
This is my life but the weird thing is … I EAT A LOT OF MEAT 🤣
Respectfully… a dancer loves your physique! Just get some training!! You got this!! Would love to do some workshops with you!!
On the windiest of days my sister has to be held down by the seat of her pants. She almost went flying. I recommend a braided belt made of rope though! No need to punch holes as the latch goes in-between the rope braids.
looks like dancin to me!
These!!!👌😅
YES THANk You for this
Ive had the sitting down problem the rib problem and the belt problem lmao
As a skinny girly, I can’t do any of these things
I had the exact opposite issues, I've been "fat" 90% of my life and no matter what diets or exercises I tried (or even e.d.s I developed), absolutely nothing has ever worked. I have had issues like every pair of pants is too small for me when I sit down and too big when I stand up. I always got bullied for being fat, and people at school would tell me to stop eating and I'd be "pretty" again (which obviously developed multiple e.d.s over the years). I've had doctors prescribe me gym memberships on multiple occasions (none of which worked at all). People called me Rhino. And I've never even been that fat, just barely on the edge between xl and plus sizes. I don't even bother with buying women's clothes anymore, firstly because I'm non-binary and am more comfortable in men's clothes, but men's clothes just fit better! I can wear a large or even a medium no problem, but in the women's clothes I have to wear a XL-2XL, depending on the brand and type of clothing.
Girl, I feel you my ass hurts all the damn time
Them dance moves were 🔥🔥🔥
“i cant dance” *destroys anyone who could come her way*
same im 6.12st ish and small so just packing on the problems lol
I never realized that all this shit was just a result of being skinny dude, I thought it was all normal tbh
*yez*
Actually I don't care I just wanna be skinny   ITS BETTER THAN BEING FAT
bro my parents used to be like "OMG GO EAT SOMETHING YOUR GOING TO BLOW AWAY FROM THE WIND!" or like "ARE YOU ALRIGHT YOU NEED TO EAT!" ater i ate an entire buffet
I can relate  my nickname at home is skeleton😩
I NO THE PAIN
Yea
My parents got called into every school i had attended, asking if I had an ED.  After a motorbike accident and having kids, im now overweight!
better than being fat
Yup that has been my family’s problem for years now and it is really fun being tall ass twigs all the time
This is so true I've always been skinny like 65 or 70 pounds 💀
Perks of being thicc: freezing is shorts weather, shock absorbers, am the pillow.
I CANT DANCE that’s not a skinny problem that’s a you problem 😂
I wanna be skinny
Wait that’s a girl
Please use to say I look like a tree because I’m so tall and skinny lol
I'm fat, so society is f*cked and I can't dance either
I've been fed for my whole time I love it I keep really warm in the hun hunting I have a lot so I keep my fat keeps me warm.
All facts for us skiny people
Don’t forget that you can’t do sit ups or else you’ll crunch your spine on the ground   But seriously these are all so relatable, especially the inability to dance 🫠
How in the world is that skinny...? It looks like average human weight 👁️👄👁️
Omfg childhood flashbacks I just started getting weight like two yrs ago
Well I'm 12 and my granny says Im a disgrace 😢😢😢😢
YOOO WHY DO I RELATE WITH ALL OF THESE - I think I bent a butter knife trying to poke a hole into a belt
Bro my younger brother surpassed me in weight and he's not even fat and I get so much crap from it
I have always been skinny, yet I never get cold. *I'm built different?*
You: your gonna break in half in the wind   Me:... no I won't break in the wind... I'll fly instead.
All i can do is the jello lmao
I have purple marks on my ribs from lying like that
I think the last on is just a skill issue
I'm not skinny I js have no ass so it hurts when I sit
I'm fat and I still get cold very fast
As a skinny person I agree I HATE BEING SO SKINNY
As a slightly chubby person, I relate to the sitting one, not because it hurts my bones, because it hurts my  f l e s h
Yeah, I get that
Boy do I know what that’s like. I’m a guy who has a waist slimmer than pretty much every girl I know. Up until halfway through high school (HS is year 7-12 in Aus) I only weighed around 20-25kg (44-55lbs). At least I’m not so tiny anymore at 50kg (110lbs), 167cm (5ft 6in)
The sixth reason kinda seems like a personal problem.
You can't use your pant packets, even if you have them.... They look weird... And if you put your phone in them , the phone will pull down your pants.
Skinny + Tall = falling short pants you gotta live with
Can relate 😂😂
Girl I can’t dance either😅
I was told that I could be broken in half like a stick multiple times and called weak all because I have extremely fast metabolism and am very skinny.. people get skinny shamed too ya know…
I thought was just me
Roller coaster safety bars are horrible for skinny people it's like you're gonna fall out of your seat every 5 seconds
Same bro, you just explained my whole life story
Same here I got fast metabolism
Honestly though like my friend says she wants to be as skinny as me but like, my shorts be falling down half the time and my belts have like, 3 holes in them 😢
Ok I’m very skinny like my whole life and this is true like I’ll ride my bike and have to take breaks because my butt hurts also as a kid I would accidentally hurt my parents because I’m so bony at nine I was 60 pounds and my sister was like 70-80 pounds
Thank you. I didn't think about poking new holes in my belt😅
😊It's just when people say they can't dance, that's fake. Everybody can You just need the right Music
Well I guess my conclusion skinny people can dance better than fat people is wrong because I always convinced myself he reason my dancing looks bad is my arms and legs are too thick but uhh I guess I’m just stiff?
I have a friend, he's built like a skeleton but  bloodied a guys nose and beat another guy on two separate occasions and both were talked about around the school for the entire week. And when I say built like a skeleton I mean you see his ribs when he takes his shirt off.
hon i think the dancing thing i just you😂😂
Also does anyone else have that random aunt who is like “Why don’t you eat more hunny you look like you are starving yourself and your going to get sick eat this plate full of food” bitch I don’t want to eat anymore I’m stuffed so fuck off it’s not my fault that my stomach is teeny tiny
Bro I’m a 0000 and I have to wear a belt with everything so for my school we have uniforms and the uniforms don’t fit and then the teachers get mad at me for wearing a belt with my skirt then they’ll get mad at me for having a too short skirt what the fuck do they want?!
I wish I was your skinny be happy with how you are instead of complaining
Skinny girls are sexy 👍
one day i was holding a big unbrella and the wind was very strong...  i few out side the god damn yard.. i was 13 when this happened (60 pounds)
The worst is when your are really skinny and really tall praticly nothing fit and if it fit it will only be for à few month
I think the dancing part might just be you…and that’s ok…nothing to be ashamed of ❤
Racist as fuck your whole life too
I skinny
I fit into all of these to an uncomfortable amount.
im brother has always really skinny and makes wanna punch someone in the face they say they can snap him in have!
K so im 13 BUT IM A 15-16 IN CLOTHING BC IM SO FUCKING TALL..YET THEY NEVER FIT BC IM SO SKINNY THEN MY BELTS AND SHIT NEVER FIT AND MY MUM SAYS IM NOT “RESPONSIBLE” ENOUGH TO POKE NEW HOLEEEEESWSSSSS😭😭😭
I’m skinny and I always get told to eat but when I do it’s why are u eating sm and then it’s my fault 🤦🏻‍♀️
I eat like my older brother and I weigh 139 pounds
Bro same
Doctors my whole life: you're very underweight and need to eat more.  My parents: stop saying that, they already eat more than the rest of us (4 others) combined!
Oh, you're gonna blow away in the wind. I fucking know, why do you think I wear 30 pounds of clothes everyday????!!!! I barely weigh 125 pounds btw
Your just bad at dancing
Neither can I girl
Bro that's the best dancing I have ever seen
pov ur skinny: relatable
Me a fatass: fascinating
‘’ I can’t dance’’  *proceeds to kill it*
Tbh id sacrifice all of that to be skinny im kinda overweight tbh
You can very much dance
I am overweight, and I would prefer this
the dancing part 💀🤣🤣
My ex used to be skinny as hell. I made the joke not to roll the windows down in the car or he'd blow away 😂
Love you honey but you can’t dance cause you’re white 😭
Most relatable thing I’ve seen all year 😂
I feel the ass bone one for sure
I found a belt at a thrift store that's woven so you can just kinda stick the metal part anywhere and it fits perfect every time
I am LAUGHING
I know I’m late but fr when I was younger I’ve been skinny my whole life but when I was younger people would always call me chicken legs and don’t blow away and light as a feather and eat a cow like I was 5 chill
I love thin woman ❤
People will go so far as to call social services on families with children that are really skinny with the assumption that the child is being starved. I can't tell you how many times it happened to me while I was in school.
I’m Skinny like really skinny and yes all of these are true
Yep… I freeze. But it charged after kids . All my life I’ve hated any temp under 80 but all of the sudden after my second, my body completely changed and now I need fan constantly. Our bodies are fascinating😲
I just wanna say you can dance way better than I can
As someone who just recently hit 100 pounds (I’m 14) can confirm all of These
I’m the same I’m really skinny and my parents don’t forget to tell me
I'm pretty sure the dance thing is more a white people problem then s skinny people problem
I've also been skinny my whole life and I thought these were everyone's problems, also I'm pretty sure my tailbone is permanently bruised because it always hurts, which is most likely from that time I bumped into someone so hard that I broke my arm and I'm pretty sure I got a concussion and I barely remember anything a few minutes after that, or it could've been this other incident that I don't remember, or just the long-term effects of being skinny combined with most of the chairs that I had no choice but to sit in being super hard and uncomfortable, and it was even worse when it was a thin cushion on something hard, it sucks, or it could be all three things combined, anyways I'm gonna go debate whether it'll be a good investment to get that checked out, because it's been a few years and I'm starting to think this might be a worse problem then I think, and the last person I've seen ignore that kinda thing had to replace the entire bone because it was basically turning to dust.
I can't dance either lol 😂
I'm skinny too and even my friends are commenting how skinny I am. All of this is true
dancing is on point lmao
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS MY PAIN
Thank you for finally addressing these issues😂😂
Im 14 and im so skinny that i weigh about 70 pounds and i can relate
Does anybody else have the problem where laying on the back is uncomfortable because the stomach pushes down on your ribs?
I wish I had the cold issue. texas heat is like lava flowing over your body and seeping into every pore
I though it was because I'm white. I can't dance worth a damn.
GET OFF THE COUNTER
Fr
this so real for no reason im 109 and 5'5 the pain is real
This is too accurate. I have Crohn's disease, I've always been skinny no matter what I eat. In high school I had teachers calling my mom asking her if I had an eating disorder. Now I get nasty comments from co-workers. I drink Ensure to try to keep my weight up so I don't end up with a feeding tube, and they act like my weight personally offends them. There are health problems with being too skinny, and it can be just as hurtful to make insensitive comments about skinny people as it is to fatshame overweight people.
OMG I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THESE PROBLEMS
All of this is so true I’m built like a twig
AL FIN ALGUIEN QUE ME ENTIENDE seamos amigas 😭❤️
True
Aight that pants and belt thing was a bit too near home. As a kid (I'm still skinny but I can somewhat manage with a belt nowadays) there was this one time where me and my parents were looking for a pair of pants for me to attend school in. And with me being the 25 kg calciumlord third grader I was, no pair of pants were fitting. So we decided to try a pair from the females section and oh my god, I do not know how women get through their day with skintight (at least feeling skintight) jeans. Got a pair of black jeans with an adjustable waistband at the end but that too was very uncomfortable.
I FEEL U GURL
I agree that it’s not because you’re skinny that you can’t dance (even though those moves were amazing) because I’m skinny af too but I’m a professional dancer/ballerina
Also you can't say to obese person to get in shape but you can critique skinny person all you want.
RIDE A BIKE WHEN U SKINNY ON GLAVEL BRO
With the cant dance thing that no true for me I’m a good weight but I’m just a horrid dancer?…❤😂
Making holes in the belt was so accurate!!
your'e so cool
1, 3, 5, and 6 are all I relate to as a skinny person
It's not just me
I can not dance
all true but u get made fun of and have the same amount of problems even when ur "fat"
You get blown around by the wind as well😂 Lookin like a zombie extra from walking dead
this is so true and when I get cold my mom tells me im like my grandma 😭 the fact im tall, along with skinny, it doesnt help being taller
Frr I'm so happy I gained some weight
Thank you
I think one you missed is intrusive thoughts your friends will have like randomly gripping your shoulder blade or collar bones 😩
I feel her pain  I am skinny myself
ngl you killed it with the dance
I have all of those issues 🤣🤣🤣 I just recently managed to hit 90 pounds and keep it on for months. Also i had teachers genuinely sit me down and ask if i didn't eat or had anorexia. It got to me a lot but then I'd sometimes get free food out of it and I just didn't complain when that happened. Also btw, skinny girl hack, buy jeggings (jean leggings) from target or walmart. No need for pants that cant fit you when THE WHOLE WASTEBAND SCRUNCHES TO YOUR BODY 😎
Omg finally someone who understands me 😭😭
Well, I don’t know I find people who have been skinny all their lives, something to celebrate .I constantly compare myself to my sister and feel negatively about myself even though I’m at a good weight, I still get jealous of my sister and yes, she gets cold way too easily. It’s summertime and she is wearing long sleeves to keep herself warm.
Luckily or we’ll not luckily, I’m like 16 and really short and skinny, so instead of people skinny shaming me they just think I’m in yeah decent or eight
forgot to mention that when sitting, you can't keep anything important in your "lap" because of the giant gap between the legs & your phone etc. Just ends up falling through to the floor most of the time... :/  ....but on the plus side, our thighs don't touch & we can wear shorts & tights without having to worry about the uncomfortable troubles with chaffing inner thighs that most heavier people have to deal with.
I'm fat
I’m pretty sure I can dance and I weigh only 55 pounds
I'm just like you I'm really skinny and I'm pretty sure I'm 9 kilos under my average weight for my age so yeah
So true 😂
I have that where when I suck and you could see my ribs🩻
I'm the same I'm so skinny
I can’t I’m fat
My waist is small so i cant wear pants without it falling down to my arse and my baby maker
I've been both super skinny and fat now I'm somewhere in the middle I love my weight now just have to tone up a little bit but I very much love the body im in its stronger and can do many many things like handstands I could hold my breath for a long time and I'm now super flexible I love my body ❤
THIS IS SO TRUE EVEN MY FRIENDS SAY THIS SHIT
I hate society sometimes. What the **quack** do you people want!  And I have a story as well. I remember eating at the lunch table in middle school (our table got called food before this table) and this girl in the lunch line walked by my friend and I’s table and just says “Fatass.” I don’t know if she was talking to me or someone else but EXCUSE ME-. (I am pretty skinny due to “issues” and yeah- silently pissed the entire time.)
Not to be all armchair doctor, but for years my brother had all these issues, he's tall for his age and has long fingers like you- and we only recently found out he has Marfan's syndrome. If you are also weirdly flexible you might wanna ask a rhumetologist to check for it.
When I was 5 I had 6 pounds of bacon. Like I was EMACIATED
Yup
I try to have empathy for people (even tho I literally don’t have any empathy) and not envy skinny people because everyone has their issues but damn do we envy what we don’t have
Same 50 pounds till I was 11.
Jayus dancing reminds of Chandler from Friends dancing
Damn you weigh A little bit more than me
The first one and can’t dancing I believe are personal issues cuz I’m fat and can’t sit down or my ass hurts and not can I dance and u can reverse the other stuff and u get fat issues other than laying on ur stomach if u fat u can do that
When I was 12 my doctor thought my mom was starving me but I just don't gain weight and I'm still very underweight
The comments always hurt :(
As a thicker girl, I am still sitting on my bones 💀
Maybe you have a overactive thyroid that's causing you to be so skinny? Maybe have that checked?.... Just a thought.. my brother who's 6'6 and barely 150 has a overactive thyroid....
Get a but pillow lol
Not to mention it is also painful just laying in bed😢
You can't dance cause your fucking white 😊
It really hurts me that people like me (who's skinny as a child) always gets a comment like this "why u so skinny, eat more ur to skinny. It's like we are eating a lot bro but we do not know how  we can't gain weight or having trouble gaining weight. People always either say your too skinny or I'm jealous of you because you can't be " fat" . I'm literally sick of hearing about it.
Nah because if I sit for to long my but starts to hurt to and I’m not skinny 😂
So true
What the f…
I wouldn't consider myself skinny but I get the bruises on my ribs and butt bones As well as the cold one 😅
Yeah... you can dance
THIS HAPPENS TO ME AS WELL IM SKINNY AS FUCK
EXACTLY!!!
This is SOO TRUE
Finally something I can actually relate to  Not the dance one though
I’m really lucky I grew up in an environment where most people’s comments were, “Omg you’re so skinny I’m so jealous” It makes things a bit awkward, but I’d say it’s better than the alternative. Also the jeans and belt is so real 😭 And seeing people were jeans that just cover over the hips gives me a HEART ATTACK. I wear my jeans right underneath my belly button 😭
Same kind of sting for fat people. I can't dance to save my life.
I’m hella overweight but i relate to the rib bruise thing. Most of it went to the bottom half so the ribs dodnt get a lot of padding. Plus if you have a big chest that ALSO hurts lying on your stomach
i got the same problems, but a plus is my bones are hard and sharp, people feel it when they wrestle me.
That last one is a skill issue
Even worse, I was short and very skinny. So my clothes NEVER fit and even so I can’t find any nice clothing that matches my style because I basically still fit kids clothes!
Another problem is sometimes your family members go like "how are you so thin?!" like what the hell I don't know
“Oh does your belt not fit. Do you have to poke new holes into it?”   Too relatable
This is so relatable
Joker: SOCIETY
Facts
This is way too true 💀
True
I love your dance moves
Your gonna turn into the stickbug from larva
People be telling skinny is ah good thing.. wearing a bath suit when ur underweight it really brings out ur skeleton. Even I don't wanna see tha
I’m pretty sure that’s just u not knowing how to dance no offense
I am the same way I do not gain wait ether
My name is Paige and once when the wind was so hard when I was like 7, I almost flew away so my dad had to hold me down
One time when i was maybe 10 yrs old my best friends mom said "every time i see you you're always eating! How do you eat so much and stay so skinny??" and i was so confused- that made me think it wasn't normal & now i dont like when people see me eating (or more when people can see me snacking- its ok when im eating breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I just feel like im offending people or something when i eat a lot ig)
The “I can’t dance” is more of a mix between tall and skinny because I’m really skinny but I’m short so it’s easier for me to dance
The dance stuff I would have thought that you were a band kid we all can’t
I'm sorry but can't dance is not a skinny person problem 😂
My boyfriend is a 44 year old ripped 5 foot 9 Italian Venezuelan g from detroit....he Is also 143 pounds...  Dude eats 4 tuna egg Ramens a day spiced with chili seasoning....  I eat two regular chicken Ramens a day. I'm 5 foot 3 and 27. Maltese and Danish with a spot of native.  I'm 165   we share clothes tho...
Also a skinny person, can relate
Truth
We can't dance were white (not racist)
actually nvm i can dance lol
OMG SAME
You can dance my sister does shes skiny to
I looked at my old photos, I look like Slender Man. No curves, just shaped like a straight stick. 😅
Someone asked me how much do you weigh and I stand there uncomfortable because I am insecure about my stomach
The comments r real
Seems like a skill issue
I get told this everyday XD
All facts except last one
I thought the painfull sitting was just me 😭😵‍💫
Sooo, I'm not a bad dancer. I'm just skinny?!?  By the way were did you buy your pants?
It took me 4 years to get 50 pounds, I'm still underweight
YEA I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
stop the a$$ pain is so true 😭
I’ve only been yelled at once by my grandma and it was because I put salad and 5 fries and 1 chicken wing and when I was done she yelled at me saying you have to eat more your to skinny and all my aunts and uncles say it but I I don’t think I’m that skinny but they all usually say it because i put on pants and they are way to big. So one time I was wearing leggings and I had to tie a shoe lase to it so it didn’t fall down then everyone seen and started saying I don’t eat enough
I’m 12 and only weight 79 pounds I’m in 7th grade to I’m super skinny but it skinny and underweight or fat and overweight 😢
The dancing is a you problem but you fricking killed it
Bruh I be heavier that u and I’m 12
sorry to ask but are you a boy or a girl i'm confused also everything you said is true but i kinda do know how to dance also you have one of the best videos ever
Better dancer than me😂
No but the “can’t dance” is so true tho like I’m so lanky that I can’t help but look awkward 😭
Yea same some of my friends call be bony and say, “Girl how r u so skinny” and im just like “thats not exactly a good thing” there like “How” and “yea it is!”
Being skinny has nothing to do with your 'inability' to dance. I say this as someone whonfance until they were 16. I was 5'6" and like 70lbs
The worst part for me is that when I run to long my ribs start hurting
When you said sitting I thought of a chubby person problem, sitting on swings hurts cuz my ass and thighs are to fat. It actually hurts a lot
This is me
Relatable
Lol i love this. I was always the skinniest kid growing up, and now im a healthy weight and i CANNOT get over having boobs and an ass! Like yo, this is awesome, you people got these in middle school!? Why did i have to wait until my mid 20s? 😂😭
All facts I only weigh 97
I cant dacen either and I'm fat
I sucks more to be fat
facts
I can’t dance either
I can’t tell if you are a boy or a girl (no disrespect it’s just if I assume wrong I’m killed for yes)
im skinny and can't dance but i think that's mostly a skill issue
Can’t dance? Says who? That’s the best dancing I’ve ever fucking seen 😅
No you can dance society just thinks their weird shirt is dancing
Fr and another problem is:when a kid is skinny people make those type of comments and then when we do eat a lot people say stuff like "are u really going to eat all that", "ur fat as hell", "ur disgusting" I should know this bc this is how it's been for me ever since 7 so I keep losing and gaining weight constantly 🙂
Damn didnt even realize that not everyone went through that
My 5'10 100 pound ass
I was a skinny kid and my Dad used to say I had to run around in the shower to get wet. 😂
To be honest I just assumed this was normal.
Same
My friends and their moms thought I starved myself even though I eat a lot.
As a professionally diagnosed skinny person i can in fact confirm that a side effect of "the skinny" is not being able to dance
I’m ten and can confirm especially sitting down and when I lay down on my stomach, it makes my pinky is numb, Oh, and you can’t forget those mean comments😭😭😭
this is so true, im 13 and im also skinny asf and my parents always say "oh youre just skin and bones" if i was skin and bones i wouldnt be alive mf because i couldnt eat on my own and my heart wouldnt beat
Lol a couple of those reasons are why I don’t like skinny girls lol bony ass and laying on top of them doing the dirty leaves bruises from there pelvic area sticking out so much lol the cold one just sucks but all women are cold anyways lol
Yeah but still it feels better to be skinnier than it does to be fat
Thank you for making me realize I have these exact same problems
Ur only 66 pounds how da fack
Ohh so u are vegetarian na ? Probably that go eat some meat ( ya sure so like for gaining weight i will have to say buh- bye to my beliefs??? I’m a proud vegetarian who studied in a convent and heard this all her life fr)
as a skinny mf that is true
and I'm a normal everything and I get told I'm chubby I should eat less AND I JUST GOT INTO 7TH GRADE! I fuckin cry myself to sleep because of this shit.
Ive been skinny my whole life and eat normally and people are so so mean about it, thank you for this video it made my day  Its just how im built maybe ill grow into it im only 13
damn this might sound crazy but just dont be skinny! thank me later :D
Ima big man and the belt still dont fit had to get one thats literally all holes
Yeah, I fit all of those descriptions! It’s soooo annoying! And my friends are always like ur skinny minny, and saying that someone is too skinny is just as bad as calling someone to big.
Wait *ALL SKINNY PEOPLE CANT DANCE???* I thought it was just me
finally glad someone made. a skinny people problem!!!
Those moves were everything
so I've also been skinny my whole life, your butt isn't supposed from just sitting down?
I was really skinny growing up and what I hated most was people always admired it saying "omg your so think! how? you are so lucky to be thin!" I hated it so much but as a people pleaser I just laughed I off but what hurts even more is one day it just stopped, people stopped saying how thin I was for ever. as nice as it was it made me realise people thought I wasn't skinny any more but bigger. not that that's a bad thing but being raised with skinny as a privilege it hurt when it was dropped so suddenly.   I don't know if that made sense just felt the annoying need to say it
Facts😂
I was realy skinny for almost my whole life. It's realy annoying. I gained weight but most on my butt and legs and my upper body still looks skinny and so people still think i'm skinny.
Cant dance, ha you fool those are the best moves I've seen all day!
SOMEONE ELSE LIKE ME!!!and I DO GET SO COLD!!!!
Relatable
That last one seem like a personal problem
I’m so desensitized of other people dying because of comment of very grewsom ways I could die (some not evan realistic at all) ever since I could crawl
Skinny guy here. This is all relatable. Especially the sitting down hurting your pelvis bone. And the cold - bro I can’t swim for more than 30 mins. And the belt. I could not find a belt that fitted for ages. Finally I have after 5 years hunting and it only fits on small setting. Before hand I had no belts lol.
Bro I wish I had your problems😢 am 15 and 102kg (224) do you know how worse life is as a tall fat man. And I can't dance for shit
As a white boy I can say from experience that last one is a "white people" problem
Haha beanpole
Same
It do be like that, talking from experience. (Not even at a healthy weight rn, I’m considered underweight)
I dance like that to
as a child i had a friend who ate everything but was the weight of a stick and i was compared to a pig we both insulted each other using weight. She drew a pig on my face and i drew a chicken
I feel you
Is it normal to be 65kg when u were 13 years old just a question its not like towards me
Nononono your dance moves are 🦆king amazing 🤩
My daugther has this Probleme and they tell me that I should give her more food and must watch that she eat and not that her sister eat her food. I hate that and my kids cry about this for this we dont go out
Number seven getting picked up by strong wind
Yeah I am skinny and have IBS so sitting down on toilet you I don't make heat in my seat like my mom can in the couch my seat will always room temperature or colder it crazy it is good when but bad when is cold
I feel like you would dance better being skinny
to the person who said "go eat a burger, get some meat under your bones" your a legen, like wtf thats not "fucked up to say to a kid" its common sense
FORRRR REALLL😭😭 BEING SKINNY IS AS “perfect” AS EVERYONE EXPECTS-
Bro I'm thirteen and a size 00 and weigh more
Same!
I CONFIRM d=(^o^)=b
In high school I was bullied for being so skinny calling me Anna short for anorexia.
"I can't dance" 😂😂😂😂 I don't think that's a skinny person problem that's a individual problem, I ain't skinny and I have that issue😂😂😂
as a skinny gal this is so true.for the first few ones you can still bear the pain but society no just no
I'm ten and I wanna be skinny when I'm older. I have stomach rolls divided into three sections. Wtf. I wanna be skinny so bad lol
If that weight is in kilograms i weigh more than you, but i am 13
The last one is because your white
So true
As a skinny person, so true!!  And with the dancing part, not only it's true, but the worst thing for me is that I also grew up with a dancer sister
FR
I've found my ppl
Man I’m slightly just ever so slightly (20 pounds) overweight and I never get cold unless I don’t have a jacket I don’t need pants I always wear shorts a shirt and a hoodie never got hot never got cold the only time I’m hot is in the summer or too many layers and the only time I’m cold is once every winter when it snows I go outside in nothing but my shorts
I have a skinny tall problem, I’m literally a twig but I weigh 152 pounds, I’m also a minor.
I remember one time ( I have an eating disorder) this girl asked me “ hey, are you even trying to gain weight or are you just trying to lose weight, like literally every time I see you I think ur skinner, put some weight on.” …. WHAT like i only had one class with her I BARELY KNEW HER, yet she tells me this.
BRO MY TEACHERS ALMOST CALLED CPS ON MY PARENTS BECAUSE OF MY BRUISES ON MY RIBBS. (I was doing yoga)
Thank god i got cake
i think the dancing is a you problem 😭😂😂😂
The whole “I hugged a skeleton” just got too real 🐰
i don’t know if anyone else relates to this but it would also HURT YOU ASS BONE to do sit-ups in high school gym class and when i couldn’t do them so easily, people were saying i was weak 😔😒
Ayeee fellow CFAer 👍👍👍
I can't dance as a big person 😂😂😂😂
"I can't dance!!!"  *proceeds to absolutely annihilate the dance floor*
True
Jayus...we all have so much love for you!  Thank you for speaking out for others too!  ❤❤❤
Check your thyroid
I don't think not being able to dance is a skinny people problem lmfaoo
Some people don’t realize that saying oh my god your so skinny do you eat is offensive
I eat so much junk food I still can't gain any weight
It's like telling fat people their fat. I've had a lot of skinny shaming growing up. I was even accused by my family that I was bulimic. I felt perfectly fine and felt healthy. They were jealous.
im 13, 5.1, And 78 pounds😅 where are my underweight ppl 😂❤ also, u killed tje dancefloor.❤❤❤
Relatable but are you calling me bad at dancing?!?! ( well I am) 😂
As a 5'5 110lbs person i can confirm all of these are true especially the clothes one being tall and skinny is the worse combo im not even 15 yet and im already wearing xl womans clothing and its still too short 😢😢😢
66 lbs???
Can't relate to this vid at all, I'm bullied all the time for being "fat", lmao. but seirously why do people bully people for being skinny and heavy???
I have the best belt. It's stretchy and has a slide-adjuster like a bra stap. It's amazing. No more extra holes
Oh hey it's been a while
I'm the perfect size and I still can't dance 😂😂😂😂
You probably can’t dance cause your whi-    (/j))
As a skinny person, all of this is true, and when I say all, I MEAN *ALL.*
naur she cant dance cause she white
girl im 10 and im 50 pounds. HOW.
Omg. This has to be THE most relatable short i have EVER seen. And the skinny comments DONT STOP. Either all my clothes are 2 sizes too big. Or 2 sizes too small. And y am i cold all the time?
I felt this on a personal level. I’m 19 and weigh less than 85 pounds 😂
I’ve been skinny my whole life and at one point I started making the skinny jokes to myself because I was so tired of others saying it I just made it natural
I'm a little chubby yet I have most of these problems... Fudge.
I'm skinny, yet I'm the best dancer at my school
HOLY MOTHER OF THE SKINNY MAN I AM, YOU ARE SO RIGHT EVERY FAMILY MEMBER JUST SAYS TO ME “WE NEED TO PUT SOME MEAT ON YOUR BONES” ITS SO ANNOYING!!
You can dance you just need to know the moves!!! You can do it!!!
The butt thing is everyone sweety we aren't ment to sit for too long
Same!!!! I have been skinny my whole life too!!!!
I was told all of that stuff even at the age of 9, I only weighed 30 pounds, and you could see my ribs, and basically all my bones. I know what it feels like to be skinny, you can still see my ribs. But I’m trying to get healthier but it’s just hard :/ I hardly eat, so I basically starve myself. And on top of that I have an eating disorder :/
I had a girl in my dance studio (she moved up a year so now she is in the 12&U team) she was skinny as heck and she was the best girl on the team she is now in the 12s team not the 10s
Can’t be more relatable
or when people say *Can I carry you?* or *Your so light you can get beat up easyly* or *You will be easy to kidnap*
As a child and teen I was like that then I was put on medication with bad side effects and then diagnosed with a hormone disorder and now im the complete opposite so I've had both sides.
Too skinny but then turn it around to ppl who are big and we are disgusting  learn to ignore the haters
#relatable lol
At the end she was really shakin them bones 😂
Omg I feel you!!!!!!!! I mean you can feel my bones and I eat more then you can think!
I’m literally in a dance team for my school I’ve never done a competition b4 I’m scared but u got them moves Bella
I can relate to all of that when I was 9 I was 18 kilograms what do you think I am now?
i have also been skinny as fuck all my life
I can relate so much 😅
I can’t either don’t worry
Your right you cant
ive gotta wear one of those elastic belts they make for children
I have been skinny for my whole life until like a year ago and now Im great
Fr
I’m the skinniest person in existence, I got called a skeleton a lot and people would talk ab how they would snap me like a twig and scoop me up and throw me. At the age of 15 I’m literally 73 pounds. Lots of throwing down the stairs jokes and I’ve even been picked up and put in a trash can several times. It sucks
That's littary what I've heard my whole life.  The worst part about being skinny is that that's today's Feminine standards, and when ur skinny they make horrible comments.
Did anyone els see the dancing noodle
I think one of the worst ones is going to lean back in a chair and the chair just goes under my shoulder blades like my friend was like I wish I was skinny don’t complain because some people really wish to be skinny and I’m just like literally existing hurts me I can’t gain weight if I wanted
“I can’t dance!” *proceeds to dance more moves than I even know*
"i can't dance" ummm i'm a fat bitch and i can't either
Finally, a short for me. My clothes are hard to buy, I sometimes uses to get asked if I eat and to make matters worse, I'm short to I'm even lighter. My friends can pick me up easy. They sometimes just pick me up for fun (they don't really anymore.) Aslo when I try to lay down next to someone in my family, I gotta worry about my skinny sharp bones. And about the cold thing, so true. (Also, I can fit my hand around my wrist, my fingers touching each other.) I just felt like commenting this cuse this is so relatable to me.
I’m 95lbs and 5’5, I wanna be a lil more evened out cause i got no padding for any of my bones 😭
Girl i know how you feel...i have all of these problems lmao 😂😂😂
I am also really skinny I always have comments like go eat a burger 🍔 or do you eat?!?! NoOoOoO i DoN’t EaT i HaVe JuSt BeEn StArViNg My EnTiRe LiFe.
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS ME literally I am so skinny I nearly blew away in the wind when I was younger but heard the thing I eat a lot like an unhealthy amount but for me that's natural because I love eating but I am still EXTREMELY SKINNY.
If that was super skinny im a skelethon
No offense but when you dance to look like Squidward
the last part is not because your skinny
I have my own little pillow in the living room I call my 'butt cushion' for whenever I have to sit on the carpet instead of the couch 😅
Or the amount of people who try to give me piggy back rides. I hate them, but I always just politely decline unless it was like a dare or smth
"Cant dance"  Me who's underweight and has been dancing for 9 years: And I took that as an insult
Yes, this all happened to me and still does as I'm going into freshman year
Omgg hate long car rides because I need a special cushion for my goddamn ass
Icl but im a skinny teen and it sucks. Like i eat 3x the amount of my family and im thinner than a shatterproof ruler. Also i dont get cold very often and it doesnt bother me which is probably cus im northern. But damn Bella, We french fries of society feel ur pain dw lmao
I'm skinny as well and I can dance because I was taught in a school I used to go to
That last one is just a white people thing. I’m on the opposite spectrum. I’m quite large and it’s hard for me to lose weight. I’m naturally very strong and it hurts to sit down for me because of my ass crushing weight. My back is constantly in pain no matter what I do. I am constantly hot no matter how freezing it could be outside. It’s interesting seeing it on the other side. You probably eat more than I do and can’t gain weight. I eat less than most people around me and can’t lose weight. It might even be unhealthy how much I’m not eating trying to lose weight. Because I need calories to function. For perspective I’m 6’5” and 370lbs and even though I do look pretty over weight I don’t look near as big as I am, it’s very proportionally distributed. I look like the kingpin character just super boxy. And without going to the gym, probably just as strong.
I'm basically a twig as well. The only reason I have some meat on my body is water polo, swim, and walking a mile and a half home every day for two years
Yeah the comments are the worst. Even as a very young kid I got them all the time. There are insecurities no matter where you sit with weight.
AMEN HALLELUJAH SOMEONE FINALLY SAID IT!!
Meeee33.....
Relate so much
Same bro 😭
This is so true and I'm just 11
Thank u for bringing light to this dude
Skinny looks good on you. But with those eyes you can get what you want
Or people always assuming youre smaller than you really are. 🤦‍♀️ I remember when I first got with my husband his mom for like the 1st 5-6 years would get me clothes for my birthday and xmas on sizes she thought I was. They were always like  size 00-size 2 which I've  never been under a size 5 since puberty. Even if Im lost all my body fat my hips are too wide to fit smaller than probably a 4 especially after having kids. It was pretty insulting along with all the comments over the years.  I have a fast metabolism, 3 kids and 14 years later I still am on the thinner side. I would lose all my weight in like 4 months after having kids and the worst comments I'd get would be people asking me if I was on drugs. It makes you wanna be mean back at times. Like  " no sorry I just don't  eat all day long and am very active chasing 3 boys all day. " 😆 🤣
POV I’m pudgy (not real fat I’m not overweight,) but still relate 🤔🤔🤔
I've been skinny as f too. I literally got into a healthy weight last year. I'm still underweight though. But I have experienced all of that stuff. 😂
I am pretty skinny. I am 11 years old. I do a sport, and my teammates are constantly asking me if i starve myself. its horrible and had led to so many problems
oh and you can't float in the water with out help, sitting in others laps are uncomfortable for them cuz how boney you are, things never fit
“I CANT DANCE” hunny i dont think thats a skinny problem cause me neither 😂
Same
Being more on the fat side you jave it good with belts, you could just pluck new holes but its not like i can magically make the belt longer  /lh /nm
Random person:your going to die if you don’t get meat on you Me skinnier then onlyjayus: Ima fly away in the wind WEEEE😂😂  Onlyjayus weights around 675:normal  Me weighing around 110:I’m not healthy  No I’m not body shaming
My sister has short gut so she complains to me about all of these issues ( if you don’t know what short gut is search it up)
Cant dancing is just a you problem
I think I have messed up rib cus I sleep on my stomach- ow. I also have a blanket rn ;-; its very cold I feel like I'm in a fridge.
Truth 💯🤞
I seem just to never really have an appetite that suits my metabolism feel weak sometimes
These are problems I have I even get called weak for being too skinny even tho I’m stronger then I look
Girl I have a big a$$ and lemme tell you I can relate to pain in the bones when sitting. I had to buy a pad for the bathtub lol I think we ladies just have boney a$$es 😂
Are we the same person
I’m 11 and every time I go out people see my neck bone cause I’m that skinny and they always say stuff like eat some meat one time this girl told me that my neck is like a bowl
relatable, i eat alot more than most people, my body burns calories so much faster, but sometimes i dont eat at all because i dont feel hungry, weed helped alot with my food habit, at a time i didnt like eating
Fr I got a white belt that I really liked but it ended up being so lose and not doing it’s job
Why was this relatable
Can’t forget about the comments about when ur sitting on someone’s lap in a family photo
When I was younger this kid once said I looked like a skeleton bc I was skinny and taller than a bunch of kids 😅
Im super skinny and hate it when someone tells me im “wow sexy body! Your so skinny!” Cause like…I HATE BEING SKINNY!!!
I’m over weight and I feel like it either your too skinny or too fat like people call me the f slur but they just make fun of you like it’s not fair how poor people treat each other
My mom makes the “get some meat on your bones” comment everyday 🥲
I’ve been skinny my whole life and I can NEVER find pants that fit, I swear manufacturers think that that taller you get the fatter you get cuz like no, but thankfully I am gaining weight and I think my bmi is finally where it should be
i have this little appliance in my mouth to help move my jaw and because of that, NONE of my back teeth touch making it extremely hard to eat a normal amount, which has started to lead to weight loss. any tips? 😅
Just eat right before bed the unused calories will turn into fat
Hmm I'm fat, I weigh 500 pounds and I'm 52                  -GRIMACE
Even with all that I still would do anything to be skinny
I think that u can dance just fine and ur dance seems more fun
You dance better then me
Being skinny af can confirm
I get this. Also your dance if skills are great
and bracelets 😭 they be sliding up to my shoulder when i raise my hand 💀 (plus there either dont adjust or dont adjust far enough)
Jayus youre my goddamn spirit animal lmao
DW, I can't dance either- 😂
Also people with big boobs have problems laying down😭
I’m really frickin skinny and I agree with all of these ITS A NIGHTMARE (sometimes)I’m also really short like I’m 4,8
😂
My younger brother is skinny af but he sleeps without clothes with air conditioning at 16 degrees Celsius💀💀
Adding to the Society comments one  ahem  “You eat so much and don’t gain any weight.” “I’m jealous that you can eat and never gain any weight.”  Like bro what am I supposed to do about it? Suddenly gain weight??
Ok look I understand them all but that last one is kinda blocking out the whole Kpop industry
Pretty smooth moves tbh
I felt that🥲
GIRLLLL I CANT DANCE EITHER 😭😭😭😭
I have fat girl problems, despite losing like 105lbs and maintaining the loss for 7 years now.
It's not even just the comments about being too skinny, there's also the amount of people being "jealous" over how skinny I am. Being underweight has its downsides too and it makes me feel really shitty when people get upset because I wish I could put on enough weight to not have my ribs and spine poking out when "I should be grateful that I'm so skinny."
The belt not fitting after the pants not fitting hits hard like FCK I BOUGHT YOU TO EOLVE THIS ISSUE NOT CONTRIBUTE 😭😭😭
Worst thing was people telling me that I should lose weight or my body is perfect. Perfect with anorexy
That is so true
It’s also impossible to find clothes that fit how you want especially if you’re also tall. People would also just ask how much do you weigh and then you get insecure about yourself. People just think you’re lying that you’ve been the same weight for years and think you’re starving yourself. I used to be told to “eat more or we won’t be able to see you when you turn sideways” when I was stuffing my face trying to gain some weight. It’s all fucked up because people think it’s easy and that we don’t get body shamed or that their comments about us don’t have an impact.
YOU LOOK SO MUCH BETTER THEN ME IN A BATHING SUIT!!!!!😭😭😭
How is not being able to dance a skinny person problem
most ppl can relate 😭
Like one of my family members thought I didn’t eat in till now
U can't dace cause ur white
YEAH SO TRUE!! my mom says if i keep doing gymnastics i never get fatter😂 i dont wanna eat SO MUCH FOOD I DONT LIKE FOOD UNLESS I GET HUNGREY
Your belt may not fit you but my fat ass has to punch new holes too. To make it fit
Yea and if you’re short too you’ll get picked up a lot without even being asked and sometimes by random ppl also the comments about our weight is so normalized and is so weird because if you said the opposite to the opposite ppl it would be horrible but if it’s said to someone skinny it’s fine
i tried to do that belly dance thing and i look like an awkward little fish desperate for water
Healthy weight 👀
weym those dance moves where amazing 😂❤
Omg this is so relatable to me I’m skinny asf
I'm chubby and all of those happen to me but the fifth
SAME!!!!!
Exaclty bro, sometimes i be under a comforter in the summe and im still freezing
U dance better than I do
i eat a ton but im always skinny. my arms at least. my stomach is too fat at times and my arms are basically bones and i feel insecure about it. i eat pretty well but im really light and short (4,11) my mom says to eat more but due to me having a small body i can only eat so much. this was the most relatable feeling ever. keep up your amazing content!
SAME
Jaylus sorry but that might just be you having issues with dancing
😅🤣🤣🤣🥲 or fly away if the wind blows a little too hard 😅 yeah same I just recently got up to a healthy weight but don’t really like how ai look anymore I feel like I should go back to being skinny 😅😢 because even though I am a healthy weight now I am being called fat even though it’s really only a little bit of roll like when you sit down or I have that under belly fat that’s hard to get off 😅 it’s like a pouch ? Idk how to explain it but it makes me self conscious and hard to work off with flat tummy workouts😢 I hate looking at myself in this negative light because I know I’m not fat but keep thinking I am because that’s what I’m being told or that’s what I see in the mirror 😭 it’s hard but the positivity I get from my bf makes me feel so much more confident in my own skin and happier than ever 😊
How tf are we supposed truly gain enough weight and keep it to be a good healthy weight??? Pls someone tell me bc all of that is true tbh
Bro the other night I was at a party and I was very cold but my mom was like it is NOT cold and now I know why I was cold ALSO I am in a dance group and I had to wear a belt for the costume or whatever you call it they had to make a new whole for it and I can't dance either this is TOO relatable
I confirm everything in this video
I’ve always been skinny asf so I completely understand the struggle
Yo this is so relatable but I like being the cold so that is good
Gurl your dance moves are so slay rn❤
I’m skinny af to lol
I feel you 😂
You dance better than me. 🤨🤨
Wouldn't necessarily call myself skinny, but I can still relate to a lot of this because my body is extremely compacted, the sitting one yes either my legs can go numb or my ummm tailbone (whatever you call it) feels like it's being worn down, laying down yes sometimes i can catch the bruises but I have a weird thing with my body not telling me I'm in pain so most of the time my arms go numb or my shoulders get too stiff, the cold thing is a bit different for me my body has trouble telling temperature but my hands and feet retain cold for way longer than other people to the point you could use them as ice packs if needed and what's crazy i won't be able to tell this until I go to scratch or cross my legs and get surprised, the belt yes and to add to that i always have to fight between getting a pair of pants that fit my waist or a pair of pants that I'm not trippen over the sleeves, society yes every time I go out people think that I'm 12 1/3 of it is how tiny i am another 1/3 is from how young my face looks and the the last 1/3 is from the fact that I'm socially awkward and cling to at least one of the people I'm with, and ya i can't dance either
As a 5’8 1/2, 16 year old guy, who just hit 112, I can say this is all relatable. I’m partially skinny because of my ADHD meds because they make me lose my appetite. And people immediately assume that I just am anorexic because I’m so skinny. Another thing people will do is call me stick bug, and they with also grab my wrist and would put their thumb and index finger around it in a Circe around my wrist to show how skinny I was.
This is my life. I’m so skinny too. People always ask if I got a hole in my leg.
Fr I people really gotta chill with those short people comments I’m shor and it hurts 😢😅
Frrrrrr
My optometrist told me i was too skinny, like you're supposed to tell me im blind not that im too skinny.
wow. a skinny person thinking they have trouble in society.
I legit just stay in a blanket for a whole day since as a skinny person, I’m ALWAYS cold.
Not me eating a whole pizza to myself while weighing 122lbs
Your beautiful to me ❤️ so fucking fine and yessss you can dance wtfff
Date a baker. My wife was a rail before my constant bombardment of brioche and cakes.
Maybe im just that flat but sitting down for to long make my bones hurt too and im kinda chuby😂
My sister is really skinny too and it’s hard to get pants for her that fit:/
You can dance
Real.
OMG LITERALLYYYYYYY
I felt those rib and a$$ ones like I can only lay on my stomach on my bed because it hurts if I’m on anything else and I can’t sit on chairs that aren’t cushioned for long because that also hurts 🥲
Ok I'm a good weight but I can't dance either
So true
More and more convinced that alot of use actually live the same life
Damn I can be your insulation from the cold /j
THANK YOU FOR POINTING THESE OUT
Yeah I’m skinny too and I’ve been losing weight fast I used to weigh 95 pounds then I weighed 87 pounds then I weighed 85 pounds and now I’m just starting to gain back a bit of my weight because the last time I checked I weighed 88 pounds and I’m only 16, I think I’m supposed to weigh more
If you are too fat, you are publicly shamed for it, and have to endure hateful comments. If you are too skinny, you are publicly shamed for it, and have to endure hateful comments.  Make up your mind, society.
Bro stop. You're not a victim. I'm skinnier than you to the point of having health complications. I'm not a victim either. We're skinny. That's all.
Oh my stars I vibe with this too much-
skinnier then her lmao
664lbs💀💀💀
Aww... you're 6'2" and can stand on uour bathroom counter? That must be nice.     I'm 6'3" and... have broken a few.
Don't forget the part where you're body shamed for being naturally skinny -  you should eat more, etc.
I could relate to that on one point of my life
i am skinny can confirm, but i am an amazing dancer, and so are you
I have all the same problems except for not being able to dance
O- sooo skinny and fat ppl have equal problems Am gonna have to tell that to mi mum cuz am fat AND SHOW THIS TO HER TO MHM
Yep. Can relate.
Yeah my friends fav thing to do is pick me up because I’m skinny and it kind of frustrating
Im not skinny, but Im not obese. My waist is tiny, I dont have an ass, and my thighs are big, so I have a really hard time trying to find pants that fit.
as someone with anorexia, i have absolutely no problem with being skinny
One time when I was like 10 Idrk who but someone in my family said ( bc it was windy) that I was gonna blow away I’ve heard that comment a few times and it sticks
relatable :(
Bro I wish I was skinny. Bc I like skinny. I wsnt skinny  Idk why people say skinny people r ugly but nah. They hot
WAIT DID THAT SAY 60 FUCKIN POUNDS
The dance parts cause ur white ur supposed to dance to country
Me to
I'm skinny too and sadly I'm seeing some correlation of the inability to dance 😔
I feel pain a lot because of it
FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS MEEEEE😂
I feel fucking attacked in hilarity
I feel this being 6’3 at a outstanding 160lbs. As my family calls me im a twig
Same
The amount of times I've had to deal with people saying that pisses me off
Same with me people called me an alien
100% true
I don’t know what ur taking about you killed that-
the belt thing omfg 😭
I xant dance and I was really skinny for a long time still am but not as bad so me and cousins joke about it but one day some way said I was. To skinny my cousins proceeded to jump him and I can't stand it coming from adults
all of this is true
Thank you
Me: Skinny  This one girl : I can brake your neck like a towing
I eat so much food but I’m still skinny, it’s the fast metabolism for me😭 these are so true
I’d honestly rather be super skinny like that then have my boobs choke me when I lay down like that😂😩 or be cold all the time instead of BURNING ALIVE
Still cute af tho
IM SKINNY AF, SUPER UNDERWEIGHT AND PEOPLE SAY FUCKED UP SHIT TO ME ALL THE TIME ALL OF THIS IS TRUEEE I’m always getting picked up, yelled at me for having no muscle or fat etc
As a fat person I can relate to all of these other then the comments one. I don't have alot fat on my upper body but I have alot on my lower (manly legs💀) and laying with my chest down leaves Bruises on my ribs too so I know the pain😭. also I can only sit for like 10 minutes since I don't have an ass and immediately feel my bone. My fat Distribution is fucking horrible😭
AND THEN WHEN PEOPLE YOU DONT KNOW STARTS GIVING YOU ADVICE ON HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT
How much do you weigh
I respect your dance skills. It looks like you are having fun. That's what matters. Dance like you are the only one around. I know I do.
I’m really tall and thin, not a good combo
"Society"
She says she can’t dance yet she does it better than all of us!😅
miss you said you cant dance then u over here brake dance like girl you can dance better then meeee your great at that i would love to dance along with u lol
I feel you the  pressure of society made it was so much worse  My friends would tell me you should get a boob job girl the workout you’re so tall why are you not gaining weight
I can relate to this so much 😢. Also I hit my hip bones on EVERYTHING cause they stick out
GROOOV CITY!!!!
The belt on is so true
I have a sister who’s the uncooked spaghetti noodle of the family
I am an extremely small kid yet i am a dancer with 4 dance classes and 8 dances on recital
Not me being 4.21kg or so idk
I feel you on all counts 😂❤
All too relatable lol, I've been called anorexic and sitting hurts but I eat constantly. Recently found a solution of going to the gym 3 to 4 times a week
The dancing one is the truest by far
Actually as a fairly skinny man i can assure that sitting for too long on a hard surface hurts. And I know what I say since I am an organist so after a long practice i really feel my butt😂
The cold one I highly relate to
First fat people were bitching about being fat and now the skinny people are whining about being skinny? When does it end?
IF I EAT ONE BURGER THEN I WILL NOT GAIN 37 POUNDS
WHY IS IT ALL TRUUUUUUUEEEEEE
I FEEL THIS EVERYDAY
#Relatable bestie
so your 21 right or in that range im 14 and weight 160
my childhood in a nutshell and i think it fucked me up cause i hate being touched now
THANK YOUUU
As someone who is so skinny i can see my ribs, the lying down one is so true. The pants/belt one is also true. And something to add, people will be like, "can you afford food?" NO SHIT I CAN I'M NOT HOMELESS
Bro im a fatass and when i dance i look like a fucking basketball bouncing XDDDDD
Haha. I've been skinny and pale my whole life. Luckily the pants problem doesn't happen to all of my belts.
If you weight around 65 kg and i doubt tgst you are that tall bc you are a girl than i might be quite skinny
I’m the same way and I get skinny shamed a lot, people think I just don’t eat but it’s about metabolism and how fast it is
I think you can dance just fine😁
I feel like this is a challenge to date you ?
I wish
I have these same problems and I had to poke holes in my belt and do a double loop once
I eat 5-8 tacos whenever my mom make it home made AND I DONT EVEN GET FAT IN NEED TO GET WEIGHT
You have the issue called being white ain't none of us can dance I ain't seen one good white dancer that ain't chorerographed.
I was super skinny when I was younger and I’m so glad no one says anything since I’ve gained some weight
My grandmas friend skinny shamed me when I was 7 how f up is that 7!!!
“That shits fucked up to say to a kid” I bet there’s no one in the comments who has related to this more than me
As a teen I overate and I became a tank.
One time I was laying on the floor on my belly for an hour watching this show and I was so engaged in it I couldn’t move, so then my ribs got so bruised and later I was going to the beach and when I took off my tshirt, my friend asked me if I had “Problems at home”? And for the next hour I proceeded to explain to her I was watching a show and my ribs bled because I was laying down for too long.  She didn’t talk to my after that 💀🤟
Relatable I'm SO FREAKING skinny and I said yes to all of these
Im the same
So relatable... It's not easy having people think your parents are starving you. I literally tried to gain weight while others tried to lose weight
Then people way younger or short or tall or older picks you up saying your light as a feather!
🤣I dance the same
Your white. That’s why you can’t dance. If you wanna learn how to dance just pull a reverse Micheal Jackson
This is so true
That is so me but one thing that u didn’t mention is how skinny my wrists are and how many comments I get on the daily, especially only being 12 years old it really doesn’t make any sense like I can’t control how slim or skinny my wrists are or how I am 😢
Same here
The belt one was a bit too true😭
Also I flipping hate it when someone compares me to a stick    Not trying to be that”I’m so skinny and petite” person srry
I relate on a whole other level!!  People thinking having small waists are amazing white all my pants never fit 😢
STOP STEALING MY LIFE STORIES GODDAMN
I m 5'10 and 15  And  My weight Is            Literally  46kg😭
i can't dance either
Nahhh fire moves
I have one of those Friction belts, meaning I just pull on the loose end to tighten it. It’s the only belt that I actually use.
I'm 13 and really skinny
as a skinny person, i relate to this on another level. especially the dancing bit
this is so true, in the first rugby team for my school, and only weighing 54kg as a 17 year old guy, i get fuckin sat on.
My parents have always yelled at me to eat more ever saints I was 9, and I agree It's really bad to say to a kid
Those dancemoves sick!!!
It honestly sad
Dude I’m the exact same way
Im saying this unironically and dont mean to sound like a creep, but i'd love to be her boyfriend or like one of those friends that just do bro stuff together and have like a comaderie where she is treated like a guy... Jayus is exactly the type of girl that i like
I really f*cking skinny as well and all of these things were very relatable, EVEN THE DANCING, so i am happy it is not just me.
you remind me of my older brother so much and I love it 😍
relatable
Y'know what's weird I could be like 200 lb (figuratively) AND STILL BE SKINNY idk how either I bearly work out so that can't be why if you know let me know please I've been confused all my life
As a 12 year old child it is concerning that I am taller that 90% of people my age, but I’m 13 kilograms underweight (28 pounds) so I can relate
Ima short skiny kid and all apply to my life
So much. I have a massive metabolism that pisses off everyone to ever diet. Lol you thought I was healthy? Ha! I need to eat constantly to keep the ability to walk
The last point (about dancing) has got nothing to do with skin-iness....😂
The fucking ass bone one reminded me of something so weird!  When I was in 2nd grade, I was bullied on the bus and this girl in high school named Tori would pull me to the back of the bus and sit me on her lap or her boyfriends lap, and they'd always talk about how bony my ass is and that it hurt their thighs!  (All of these are so accurate as well holy shit-)
Guys..I think I'm skinny..I thought I was fat and ugly, now I'm just ugly lol
Gonna lie that dancing scene she looked autistic
SAMEEE!! Growing up in a Greek household didn’t help the skinny comments either🥲 my grandma would force feed me and I would just sit there and not eat because I wasn’t hungry
I remember when i lost weight over two months (i was 115 and became 105) and because of that my waist got thinner. I had a band concert and the belt i wore at the last one two months ago doesnt fit me BY A LOT. My drama club director had to poke a new hole in it for me and she kept scolding me for not eating enough even though i eat a frickin ton of stuff every day.
The 1st is so true and I can't dance but I'm more in the middle.
Always,always,always…… the pants behind pulled up at the worst times possible!
Girl I thought the title said skinny people uniforms so I skipped immediately bc I’m there’s nothing for me on this video 😎
That dancing though 🫶💅🙄
I would do anything to be as skinny as you
THE ONLY DANCE I CAN DO IS THE DARN WALTZZZ
Yes yes yes I. Super skinny and all of those are true😂❤
YESYESYESYES IM A THEATRE KID AND I CANT DANCE BC IM TALL AND SKINNY AND ITS MY WORST NIGHTMARE
Now I’m Greatfull I’m fat af
the poking holes in a belt is a lil too relateable😭
Womp Womp
😮 someone understands! Also, you dance better than me just so you know. 😊
As a skinny person this is very true
Ngl all this true but dancing I can do one move
As a overly skinny person damn anyone know how to gain weight that doesn’t involve overeating?
I mean you have long enough hair for a windmill when listening to hard rock/ metal
I don't understand these struggles like I get fat simply by not starving
Did that say 66
All of this, plus a more specific issue i run into. Most of my male friends are larger than me, with more muscle mass and just more mass in general, so when it comes to strength they all have no confidence in me, despite me being significantly stronger than all of them. The issue is i am barely capable of holding onto enough fat to keep me alive, they are all chonkers
Don't worry I the same way, I weigh 64 pounds at 12 years old, we're the same
Yo I’m six seven and weigh like 120 pounds which when compared to the height is like nothing
Dancing nah it's just sticks in the wind
I have a genuine question I don’t mean to be ignorant or sarcastic but why can’t you just eat food and gain weight is there genetic reasons or something like that
I LITERALLY HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS, LIFE IS PAIN
I’m realy skiny too. Every day i woke up and caunt my bouns.
No worries hun, the grass on this side of the fence, ain't any greener, and the grass in between our yards ain't any greener either. People will always be cruel no matter what your body looks like, your either too fat, or too skinny, or not skinny enough, or not fat enough, if you're in the middle you're somehow still fat, if you workout and gain muscle somehow you are too masculine and therefore ugly. Never change your body for someone else, it won't ever be enough. Do it for yourself, make yourself happy. You can't please people, don't try
OMG IM SKINNY TOO AND THIS IS SO TRUE
As a skinny person to people make comments on my weight and its my family who says it which is the worst part, they tell people i only eat vegetables when i dont saying thats the excuse for my skinnyness
Ya know I think the dance part was a you and I problem...
Smash
Same
I love this dance segment
A chair was too close to a desk in school so I tired to move it but there was a kid behind it so I couldn't move it and when I complained a kid said "You are literally a twig" It wasn't much but it hurt
As a skinny person can confirm
I was so skinny growing up and people always called me Anorexic and it was soooo annoying I just had a fast metabolism and couldn’t help it. It didn’t matter what I ate I was ALWAYS skinny.
I feel this
THIS IS SO GODAMN TRUE
It is fucked up to tell a ch8ld that type of stuff,I had that stuff said to me as a child and then it kinda just stuck with me and now I’m so self conscious I wear baggy clothing everywhere because of the very thing that is supposed to support you,a parent
I have the same problem
Ohmygod someone with weight problems thats underweight instead of overweight *intensely inhale*
YES. The belt and the comments are too relatable 😅 One of the main reasons I live on cushions 😂
She just explained my childhood in an alternative universe  *continues to roll on the floor like a beach ball*
Yes yes yes and ……….YES
Why can I relate to EVERYTHING you just said-
Am very skinny and I don't get cold easy  People always wonder how
The worst part about being skinny for me, is I can’t put on weight easily so up until now I have been underweight, and I’m 104.6 pounds. A year age I was 87 pounds…
YOU CANT DANCE!      * proceeds to kill the dance floor * 💃 🕺
As a 14 yo who is 72 lbs I can relate to all
That’s my problem.
As a 6’0” dude weighing only 129lbs, this is all extremely accurate, relatable, and hilarious.😢😂
“ I CANT DANCE” same girly pop same😔🤚
OMG some representation finally
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP STALKING ME IN GETTING SCARED
You're not skinny... everyone around you is just fat and not used to seeing adequately weighted people...  Also you are tall.
Im short and skinny, def can't dance so i get it
I’m not skinny and I still can’t dance💀
skinnyy ganggg 97 pounds les goooo
THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABT THIS
Just lift weights eat protein. I understand that people have eating disorders and different body types but you should still try
Meeeee I'm 5 9 and 90 pounds like...
FINALLY SOMEONE I CAN RELATE TO
The dance made me laugh so hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I could post pics on comments but I was super skinny my whole life then within a year became really beefy, I'm 6'2" and went from 175 to 233 lbs 🤯🤯🤯... and yes I did always get comments about my weight before, it's harder to be a skinny guy than it is to be a skinny girl
YES someone who finally understands my situation also we can’t just eat and be come fatter it just don’t work I eat a lot but I’m still skinny
All of these are so true 😭😭😭😭😭
I fuckin agree with this shit IM TIRED OF IT
I still use the same child-sized belt that i got when i was 10 cause nothing else fits 😭
I also have to deal with being skinny. Whenever my family, and extended family, hug me they feel the need to comment on my weight. They tell my I am skin and bone. It gets very annoying.
I don’t know if you can tell but….. I have to relate to all of this😢
I can't dance   Just because you're skinny that isn't an excuse you're not talented girl respectfully 😅
Who says you cant dance?
Wait until you have kids and get older... you will have a Big ass and top heavy
I have that problem with the pants and belt as well
I relate to this entire video, besides the dancing!😂😂😂😂😂 I am a professional dancer, and have been my entire life!! And yet I am still skinny as hell!!!😂😂😂😂
I know it’s kinda selfish but honestly people like only like one body type 😢
Oh what people say to you when you're skinny gets worse lol, people used to ask me if I had tape worm or if I was anorexic it's honestly ridiculous
And don’t even get me started on roller coasters! On some rides you can feel yourself leaving the seat and if you’re on a zero gravity ride, you go upside down, or theres just a lot of bumps you’ll feel like those will be your final moments cause you bouta fall out
I've always grown up to be very skinny, and people would say things like, "I could throw you across this room rn." or something like " is that why you were oversized hoodies, because your so skinny"  Calling someone skinny is the same thing as calling someone fat. And I can assure u no one likes to be called fat. Never make fun of someone's body
*when my parents say eat a large meal**i eat it but then im still skinny🥲🤪
why is this so true?!? 😭😭😭
BITCH IS EXPLAINING MY LIFE (Also is it just me or am I the only one who has to use my strength when there’s rough winds)
As a skinny person, i can confirm this is all true.
I can't gain weight. U should make a video of how to gain weight lol
I used to be skinny as hell and then I went to the gym and now I finally am starting to see some meat in my abdomen and arms
You can see the outline of my ripcage
Been called a twig my whole life ut has never once bothered me grow the fuck up and stop trying to be a victim
Why tf does this feel sooooo REALATEABLE!!!!!!
Brooooo fr
"sitting down hurts my ass bones" THIS IS WHY MY HOUSE IS FULL OF PILLOWS. IT HURTSSSSSSSS. love ya bella
Very nice dace skills 😂
I get told to eat alot lol this video is relatable 🥲
Same
Me asf
I can't dance. I'm skinny looking but I currently weigh over 140 pounds. And I get cold so f-ing fast as well.
Wdym that dance is the best in the world...!!!
Lol I'm  short but this was me until 2yrs ago and I've gained some weight  but I still can't dance😅
my aunt called me a twig during thanksgiving and literally said “you should eat thirds, you need to grow more otherwise the real world will snap you in half”
Now, I finally get why I’m always so cold
Facts fr fr
Yeah that's awful🙄
I told my friends that I was going to try and gain some muscle fat and they laughed, I don't think people realize that slim/skinny people have problems too.
.....it's too true-
I us a kids belt  because it the only ones that fit
Being skinny means you cant dance? I always hated this bitch but now im just concerned with her mental health everything she does is grasping at straws
Tbh for me I have alot of this but I actually weight alot while my body itself is slim
Everyone is so ignorant with what they say to skinny kids😢❤❤❤
I F***ing love you! Only seen this one video and you nailed it! That was my entire life wrapped up in a few sentences! Thank you for being someone who understands from a place of mutual skinnyship!😂🎉
“i cant dance” *starts busting it down sexual style
Not trying to be that person, but I’m so skinny, and this has been the most relatable thing ever, also those moves were 🔥
The part with the pants is soo relateable! My pants fall down even with a belt 😭
And doing the nasty with a person just as skinny hurts. Two exposed hip bones banging into eachother hurts like hell
That sai 66pounds WHAT
How am i fat but still have all of these problems
I’d rather be very skinny then be fat because everyone shames fat people but not skinny pepple
BRO NOONE TALKS ABOUT THE BELTS ITS SO DAM ANNOYING
I’m skinny but eat SOOO much, my family comments about it a lot (not in a negative way)
Omg, thats me
oh no.. it's too much.. too much😭😭 it's too relatable i cant😭😭😭
Was that 62 lbs or 162lbs
I AM SO WITH YOU  I DECIDED TO PUT ON WEIGHT THIS SUMMER BY EATING A LIT AND LIFTING THEN I BROKE MY FOOT SO I HAD TO STOP
YES MY BEST FRIEND HARASSED ME BC IM SO SKINNY  MY COUSIN WHO ISNT IN FING SCHOOL TRIES TO PICK ME UP AND SQUEEZES ME
As a skinny person, I can relate to the clothes not fitting. I have a few pairs of jeans that are always falling off my waist, and are just too big around the waist in general.  Also story: when I was in middle school I went to a private school, and I didn't want to wear a skirt, so I just wore pants because they weren't too strict but I had to wear a belt with it. My belt was way too big and I had to poke like three extra holes before I figured out how tight I needed it. Also, the pants didn't fit real good either, but that was mostly because the cut was kind weird, and it was always getting in my butt lol 😆 probably would've been better off if I just wore one of their ugly kilts, and eventually I just wore those more...but also the waist on the skirt was too big, and if I got a smaller size I would get in trouble because it would be "too short" and it wouldn't be "modest" to wear my skirt too high.  Also it was a Catholic school, sorry to trauma dump I kind of just made an entire speech what were we talking about again?
I still think u look amazing 😅u the reason how i found out i like girl werid but yes skinny or not u look amazing
I eat the wholefridge and I can vouch that these are problems
she can bus  it down   really good
I had a friend who had a borderline eating disorder for years, and only recently gained weight to a healthy amount. He weighs more than me for the first time ever, and even though it's only about five pounds of difference, I'm super proud of him.  I could see how he struggled, and it hurt, but for him to finally have gained that weight he was trying to get, it's amazing.
bro i got the belt thats like all holes because the other ones i have i had to poke the holes in it, the braided one is just too long 😭
I cant dance either and i choose not to
I ended up over eating because I was told I was gonna die from being too skinny
Umm nice dancing lol thank u for saying addressing this
I hit the bulk
I totally agree I know the problems
Bruh this person is epic
Same gorl
Why is it true why???
You still dance better than i can so you have that going for you
Just this week my great grandmother was like “You need to gain some weight you really need to gain some weight” and I was like “I know Mamita, I know” 😂 like ma’am I already knew this 😭
"Get some meat on your bones" was a staple of my childhood 😂
Gurl your dancing is fucking fire 🔥
The fact that you have to have a pretty much a exact weight bc if you are skinny or fat you will have health and living issues is 😭😭😭
You have better dance moves than me what the fuck you talkin bout?🤨
I also am skinny but I can surprisingly stay out in - degree weather for hours while wearing shorts no shoes and a short sleeve shirt and be completely fine
U can dance girly!
I now want a burger... yes, it's as sinple as saying burger to make me want a burger.
Just don't blame it that you can't dance you just can't dance
This is very relatable lol
Yes the reason I can’t dance is cause I’m skinny. So don’t even ask me to dance
I think they were pretty good dance moves lmao . Maybe mine are just bad
I wore size 4T shorts until the summer I turned 11. The shorts kept getting shorter, but they still fit so I kept wearing them haha. People called me bones or skinny minny. My foster mom fed me every hour or so, and told me that when I was at her house I never had to wait for permission to eat/drink. I still deal with weight comments to this day and I didn't know until way later in life that I was malnourished my whole childhood. Point being, you don't know someone's situation. Just don't be an arse.
Everyone thinks I’m anorexic and they always make comments abt it especially kids at my old school but like Loling over it
Number 6 is a you problem
Brother I always buy a size up and I would wear a belt man there is no amount of joy like one day putting on your belt and your pants fall down and u got to put a new hole in it that is really progress when you're like holy shit I am not a fat ass.
i am a skinny person i feel this
I’m naturally skinny and I think the most common names I get called are Skeleton and a twig-
I’m a very skinny person and I’ve been dancing since I was 3 and I’m one of the best in my company 😂❤
As a skinny person myself this is true
As a skinny person I can relate to this it is so awkward to dance you don't look right 😂😂
Me and my friend make fun of each other all the time I make fun of him for being skinny he makes fun of me for being a redhead.
I'm chubby and I'm kinda the opposite of most of those things (I'm not calling myself fat and being rude to myself but I also feel bad for skinny people to I'm sorry for those skinny people 😢)
When I sat down for too long once I got a painful bump which hurts way more when I sit down it’s basically a skin tear that got a little bit swollen
The legs look so goofy ahh
i miss these tho 😭
Another thing: EVERYTHING WE DO LOOKS CLUMSY AF
That last one was a skill issue 😅
SAMMMEE BROO the new medicine I’ve been taking is making me less hungry, so I’m like severely underweight and people are like I’m so overweight you’re so lucky I’m like no I’m not😊
You can dance
About the freezing. I'm sadly 330 pounds and I can freeze with 27C or 80F when I'm not sick 😅
I aint skinny but i cant fucking dance either lmao
I'm a copy of u bro
That's what my parents tell me go eat a burger I'm 10it hurts my feelings
Also, whenever you eat, your stomach gets bloated really bad. I’ve been skinny all my life and I’m scared to eat at parties because whenever I do, someone will points up my belly and call me fat, orthat I don’t eat enough. I get BOTH! being skinny is heavily overrated.
Facts
I almost fly away during a thunder storm and I live in Oregon
Ty g
Bro I've been like underweight my whole life and this is too real. The worst part is I'm super tall and grow way too fast so it's hard to get clothes
Fat people problems are worse than skinny people problems
I feel fat but every one says im skinny so idk what to go with😅❤😊
I dont think dancing has to do with wait.. that's a skill issue girl
I’m still skinny asf and always have been and Ik exactly what ur talking ab
Everyone - "Go eat and get meat on your bones" Me - What tf do you think I've been doing?!
This is hilarious but so accurate. I buy kids belts lol. Saves me the hassle of punching holes. Also boots are a struggle. They’re always so loose on my twig legs 😭 and narrow calf boots are not cheap!
yes me
Seriously though like my sister always made fun of me for being skinny. She always told me I looked like a skeleton or that my legs looked like they were about to snap off. 😭😭
You are a wonderful dancer ❤😂
Wait how much does she way I couldn’t see it that good ?
I can relate to people saying I need to eat more , like okay but I would have to eat three times as much if my metabolism is three times as fast just to gain any weight, the only time ever gain weight is by my bones getting bigger due to growing and I’m still 70 ish pounds
Frrrrrr girl your not alone on this one 🤣
Like bro dis tru like i witally get cold like an instant i get inside a cold room and when i go out for hotness is great but when i go back inside its fricking cold again.
OMG SOMEONE WHO RELATES! the point about "getting some meat on your bones" is so true! its like when I finally do eat a lot of food it all goes to my stomach and not my arms or my chest or anywehre else that I might actually need itttt
Oh and don’t forget, if your sitting on the floor your ass bones LITERALLY CUT OFF CIRCULATION TO YOUR LEGS
bro i'm skinner than you and when i wear a crop top you can see my ribcage because of my eating disorders and i have anorexia to
I’m 12 and I have the opposite problem
Yesssss
OMG thatss why my ass hurtsss
Same here but if you find the right song and dance moves that you dance to then you can become better dancing, but I do love your freestyle
Broooo this is meeeee I just now started to kinda gain weight
Both sides are fucked either way. As a chubby person myself, the more you feel insecure about it, the more you think you are the only one who is being mistreated for weight, but in reality skinny people are too. This is just how society works in this age and I don't think it will ever change. We've gone too far
This is all so relatable 😂
Facts
I went to the doctor once and he said that he may make an entry and exit wound on either side of my arm just from a shot
For me it’s painful to run for 1 min
bro i feel this people always give you that look when they find out you’re weight they’re like dang i wish i was that skinny like no you don’t it kinda sucks
As a fat person (I admit) laying on my stomach like that also hurts. I don’t get bruised, but it’s still hurts so bad
Oh my god FINALLY someone talks abt sitting making your ass hurt. I have so little fat (I'm anorexic and high metabolism) that I can't sit for more than 10 minutes without my tail and back bones aching like HELL. And the "do you eat" comments just get on my nerves. This video hit too close 😂
so true
As a skinny person this is all true
I’m getting bodyshamed my my grandpa😭
You ain lie doh
i think the dancing is jus because your white not skinny 😂
Is she 66 pounds!!!?!?????
True
Bruh, I'm literally thick, and everyrhing and my ass bones still go directly through to the chair. My ribs and shoulders are bony as well 😭. Like, I'm squishy, but if you grab the wrong part, it's all bone coming through.
as a skinny person this is absolute hell
She can dance ❤❤❤❤❤
been there, still there
never related to a video more
Ooooommmmmmgggggg thank yoooouuu that is the most relatable thiiing eeeevveerr
i have the same comforter
I was always told that if i wasnt careful i would get blown away in the wind. I got cushions for my chairs to.
Running is my problem I just start to get air
I hate how relatable this kinda is
Trust me i think that having skinny and thick tighs are bad bc if ur skinny ur legs heat up and cool down quicker but if there thick it takes ages for u to walm up again it look me 5 hours for my thighs to walm up and i was shivering for the whole 5 hours
What about the opposite of skinny
I truly relate to this so much. The comments I got as a 8-12 year old kid was not nice at all either. Teachers literally thought I was starving myself.😭
The dancing pie that’s just you love you being skinny
Fr and my swimsuits never fit
My 2 oldest kids are skinny. They eat all the time. The strong wind will push them.
It's really easy, just really really appreciate food.
Same❤
You explained my whole life
Im skinny as fuck and always have been. I see my ribs through my skin😂
when I am outside and it's wind I am falling down last night O hurt my lag bc of that 😭😭and also when I was 11-12 I was really Underweight. My weight was 25. This is really bad for  a kid and I am still really underweight.
Ad 5. Society HAHA I COULD TEACH ANATOMY ON YOU!  I can't count the times I've been told this
This is me. Finally, someone gets me. 😂
I just gave up on belts who needs them when you have shoelaces haha
You dance better than any professional dancer I’m convinced you used to go to dance classes or something
Did forget one thing tho...the random request to crawl into a small hole just to grab a random fallen object
Bro just called out my life😅
Totally agree with this, too many people assume skinny people have no problems but they obviously do. My friend has had to learn to sew to adjust her clothes to fit.  That being said, ive been overweight or obese my whole life and my ass bone hurt and my ribs get bruised, the fat don't protect me
So true
Relatable
People always told me growing up and still do that I’m to skinny and need to eat more  I don’t think people understand that even if you tell me that I’m skinny as a compliment it doesn’t seem like one to me
I was 5'6 in middle school and was stuck at 90 pounds all throughout middle school and my freshamn year of high school. I am now twenty and have been 130 pounds for the past 3 years. Im 5'11. And my guy, I felt all of those.
Omygosh the pants and belt one is so true
The same things have happens to me when I was a kid and I feel insecure cause people still treat me that way😢
I WAS WONDERING WHY ALL BELTS WERE USUALLY TOO BIG ON ME💀💀
Damn so relatable bro
That's me other then the dance part because I'm actually pretty decent. And now I know why I'm always colder then my family.
I’m short and skinny and most days it makes me want to kill myself because I get made fun of you are one of the only people that makes my life worth living
I'm 55.7 pounds, and that's not healthy?! She just taught me something!
I can tell you, It is so hard to find Close to wear
Yes, people say stuff like that to me on a daily basis. Us skinny people struggle too. Also, it's hard for us to gain weight even when we try to.
She is the only one who understands our pain.
I get bruises in my ribs all the time😭😭
The eating one always annoys me, I've been between 110-130lbs since I was 15, I'm 30, yet I'd be eating like 9000 calories a day and not move out of my computer chair unless it was to grab more junk food or go to the bathroom..
But have you tried doing crunches on a hard floor , because I hurts my spine
Im literally the same lol
Ppl always picking u up  Like whyyyyy Put me downnnnnnn
My sister is skinny but she dance sometimes im like wow 🤩
I'm the same way
The gets cold super fast part is way to true. I have 9% body fat too. It’s awful And really everything else too😅😅
Fr 😢😢
im really skinny and can relate to ALL of these
Bella dancing made my day
*I can't dance* -bella dancing better then me- 😭😭😭
2 things: I can relate to all of this and My mum of all ppl does no.5
you can dance
Don't forget the one where your pants  don't fully cover the bottom half of your legs
As the oldest Sib and the skinniest I do get cold often.
What do you mean you can't DANCE!?
@onlyjayus I feel your pain my family would always ask if I was hungry or always tell me to eat a stick of butter bet then I would eat and call me a pig
being hot as fuck must be such a burden
I'll trade you. I can't lose weight
hold on are we not gonna talk about how she was ON TOP OF THA SINK when that video first starts-
😭i get this, i'm finnaly at 49 kg, i'm suposed to weight 56kg.
I think the dancing is not because your skinny that’s because your you
Facts
funny, i would rate my body type as average, and i am cold resistant af, while my fat friends are wearing jackets i walk in tshirts
Once I flew away in the wind when I was a little kid
I can relate to this… I weigh 115…
truth: People with no rhythm who still be busting dem moves are the life of whatever social event they’re at. They’re way more enjoyable to watch than really good dancers and they make everyone more comfortable to just let loose
This so relatable to me!
I can only twerk
Same got a nickname it’s twig
Well we dont say go eat a burger to my friend we say eat anything pleaseeeee   because she has been told (by a dr) that she needs to eat more or it will be very bad for her   Once she took 5 weeks off because of that and is experienceing headaches and normally goes home early because she feela like shes gping to passs out    She does this on purpose to get more skinny but she is already SUPER skinny
My cousin is skinny as f*ck and she is going to worlds in DANCE 💃
Bro better than me at dancing 💀
i can understand these but the worst part is getting cold because i'm known for being VERY VERY hot person all the time even when i'm freezing i'm burning on the out side
The worst thing about being skinny is EVERYBODY calls you a “Skinny B*tch”  Like BRUH, that’s like dumb blonde and stuff. Everyone just assumes cause your skinny then your gonna be all girly and the slightest thing like refusing to pet a snake makes them right!?
I cant dance  How do kpop idol dance then very skinny and then perfectly fine
Those moves are FIRE 🔥
Dude, I am just naturally skinny. I eat enough food, I eat the right amount of food, I eat sweets, I eat junk food, I eat healthy stuff and  I still just seem to be very skinny.
It's so true tho but I can't gain wait ima stick :(
n word
Gurl you can dance you better than me
"I can't dance!" *Proceeds to boogie down*
First time I feel a bit grateful of being a lil chubby guy, bc i (thankfully) cannot even nearly relate to any of this
Skinny men, they think we don't eat But we eat months worth of food in a week I'm tryina be what I'm destined to be But I can't gain no frickin weight (Random meme song if ykyk)
The dancing part I just jump
I get it bad because I'm super tall and skinny so no clothes ever fit me
I have some what anxiety about my weight but I’m my average weight I should be for my age but I’m somewhat short so i have a lot of fat just there so I were really baggy clothes
My besties calls me  spaghetti noodle, and other family calls me a twig
girl i’m skinny af too, nothing fits me and everyone is like YOU ARE GOING TO DIE TOMORROW
Everything makes since, except the dancing sorry bout it but I don’t think it’s because you’re skinny😂❤❤❤
I was 98 - 104 pounds at maybe 5’8 - 5’9 until the end of my 9th grade year and I’m only 110 and very close to 5’10 Edit turns out I’m 106 5’9 3/4
I have always been skinny and one time I was hiking on the misty trail in Yosemite and I slipped and went under the gard rail and I was just kind of dangling there.
girl if i started to dance i wold f*cking die because everything is funny about dancing to me like how girl how?PS. i love your content
Don't forget about people/your parents commenting about everytime you "eat more".
My mom shes skinny as a pole: bruh
I can’t dance either. You’re not the only one
The butt one is sooo accurate!
I can relate to all of this😭
“I CANT DANCE”  **Fucking destroys every dancer’s career**
most of my friends don't let me give them a piggy back rid cause they say there scared to break my back
6 is for so many ppl including 99% og your comment section
The dance was just ✨
Dude, same
SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTSANDS
Worst thing is you can’t fit anything so much struggle finding jeans I like 😅
being called "bony butt" as a kid. yeah i like always did my best to avoid sitting on like my moms lap after that
My belts never fit, the waists on all my pants are way to big, but then my pants are all too short.
As a skinny person, can confirm, the dancing thing is definitely related
A skinny person and a chunkier/heavier person cuddling  Skinny person=gets warmer Heavier person=Gets cooler(sometimes)  Best feelings
I am supper skinny always have been and these r thing I relate to so much
"Hi, I'm onlyjayus and I'm your freestyle dance teacher"
your dancing is actually a whole ass vibe
as a skinny person (and just, fairly small person in general), my friends are very often surprised at how much i eat. i love food, i love eating, but i only recently got to a healthy weight for my size. also yep i agree with this entire video. it’s painfully accurate
I found my people
I would probably be “normal” looking if that one teacher in pre-k at lunch didn’t say that the reason the pb&j sandwiches were not good because they mixed the peanut butter and jelly together. And I just have a fast metabolism
It’s ok Jayus… I love your dance moves ✨☺️💅
Im thicc anf Latina and can't dance. It's okay
I’m skinny as fuck and I barely get cold
Good thing about being a tiny emo is that all my belts are riveted through the whole thing
Dude being 300 pounds makes my hips and back fell like they're 60
I’ve been, as I’ve been told, a very skinny girl my whole life and I’ve experienced A LOT of these type of things. Like, people at school have been always asking me if I eat enough or, if I’m sick. Plus there’s this one girl who had the audacity to say “girl, you’re way to skinny, eat something for your own good.” And it’s very annoying and it makes me feel very insecure about my body. Like seriously, I’m only 74 f***ing pounds, plus I’m a child so I shouldn’t have to be fat to get respect from others. But if I was fat, it would be the same thing, the only difference would be people telling me to “Eat a salad!” instead of telling me to “Eat a burger!” Oh, yeah and, sitting does hurt my butt, I’m cold 24/7, and most of my jeans are WAY to loose at my waist. I hope someone can PLEASE relate to this, like I can’t just be me.
Bro. My mom forces me to eat bcz I’m way to skinny
That’s why I never get cold
I’m a really skinny person and I EAT All the Effing time      One time a girl looked at me and said “dang is your family feeding you? You need to eat something”  But it makes me laugh on how relatable this video is 😅😂
I wish I was skinny, not unhealthy-skinny, just dropping like 20 pounds. I feel like I would rather deal with those problems than the insecurities I have right now.
I've been extremely small most of my life. At 14 years old, I wore a size 14 in boys. I didn't get to adult sizes until I was 20 & up until I was 30, my sizes went up w my age.
I relate so much I HATE winter with every ounce of my body, which is not a lot but still
Yes. Im the short and skinny friend, and im constantly asked if i even eat. My friend decided i had an eating disorder, and thats why i dont eat. I don't, i just.. have problems gaining weight. Im constantly picked up, too. I hate this.
Ok I can't dance lol but I also choose not to 😂. But the one about being cold ALL THE TIME describes me... 😅
Same here I can't lay down on my stomach without waking up in the morning hurting like hell!!
My family has always pressured more food on me because I’m “going to blow away in this Texas wind” they’ve been doing this for as long as I can remember
I KNOW LIKE THIS IS ME IN PERFECT DESCRIPTION
SAME. I literally cannot do a sit-up because my fricking tailbone is always just poking out and it hurts so bad on hard gym floors 😭
I weighed 109 my whole life then, a couple years ago weight just fell onto me and wouldn't leave
I have these problems all day everyday
I can feel these 😭  I can eat as much as I want and I don’t gain much weight for some reason it took me maybe 2 years to go from 68 pounds to 74 pounds. I’m also real underweight for people my age (15)
In my boyfriends words, I’m a “slim-think honey” and I can’t dance either. I think it’s an either you can or you can’t situation that doesn’t really matter on size.
Iv been SKIIIIINNNYYYY since I was BORN! I'm starting to get curves now that I'm 13 but when I lay down my hipbones DIG into the FREAKING GROUND and it HURTS
WAIT 66 POUNDS IS A NORMAL WEIGHT I AM A KID AND WEIGH MORE THEN THAT YOU WEIGH AS MUCH AS MY SMALLEST FRIEND
What are u talking abt, "I can't dance" ur dancing amazingly, ur dancing better than me and I'm fat
true.
I knew a girl who had to eat 2 loads of bread a day to make her gain any weight and it didn’t really work
Okay I'm the nine-year-old girl weighs 90 lb and when she's trying to get skinny it's actually very helpful watching this video so I make sure I don't lose that much weight
You CAN perhaps you shouldn't but you CAN
Tru
As a skinny person...THANK YOU
As a skinny person this is soooo true     Btw you have great videos
Sooooo relatable OMG
Bruh every one of them is true. My freeeekin butt bones 😫😫😫
😂😂😂😂 I can relate dude
“that shits fucked up to say to a kid” it sure is man it sure is
You only way 66lb
The last one hits 😩
Me and My brother was like unhealthily skinny and going through this stuff loool
I have always been called a stickman beacause i’m skinny
I’m super skinny too. I don’t really gain weight. I have anemia and I suspect my ribs may be too small for my chest compressing on my lungs making it diff to breathe, was I born like that? Not sure. But they don’t seem to be growing and I stay skinny.
That last one just seems like a you problem and not a skinny person problem professional dancers are all skinny so are balarinas etc
Bro🤦‍♀️
Bro, I’ve been skinny my whole life and I have the EXACT same problems😂😂😂
Worst fun fact about skinny and tall people: we're more likely to have a collapsed lung for ✨no apparent reason✨
Im 20 now and my grandmother still makes those comments still hurts to this day
One more thing tho what about when laying on your back leaves bruises on your spine?
Oml yes.
Thats very good dancing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
So I’m tall as fuck, like 6’6 and I only weigh 180. I went to the doctor and found out I’m 10 (4 kilos) pounds under weight. Can someone help me. Like tips on how to gain weight I can’t seem to do it. My doctor didn’t say shit. Help me
I can't dance either
I like to think I’m skinny but when I sit I look fat.
My family calls those, “Skinny Bitch Issues”. If I’m cold then that is the first thing I hear.
I always noticed some of my skinnier friends shivering when they have huge jackets on so I'd find the sunniest spot (preferably one that's pre heated) and somehow slowly move the entire group there
I have never related to something more in my entire life
I didn’t know that you played basketball
Omg same! But getting cold fats if the worst one 4 me cuz i cant even be in the pool with other people for as long as them so i just sit outside raped un in a towel 😂
I’m not particularly skinny but I get cold way too easily so I have 3+ blankets when sleeping during winter and still get cold 💀
Omg the pants and the belt thing is so relatable 😢
My cousin skinny and she can dance I think that’s just you and me problem
THANK YOU!!!!! people don't realize that there are 2 extremes to the weight spectrum and they both are extremely unhealthy/harmful mentally and physically
what the fuck
#5 is relatable, but when I do eat a lot NOTHING FRICKING HAPPENS!!!
Last ones a skill issue
I can relate to all of them but the first one in particular. sitting down hurts, like how can I study in those rock hard chairs they have at school 🥲
You dance better than me atleast
The amount of times I've been asked if I have an eating disorder is sad
Relatable
clothes, I want to wear them, but they are so uncomfy, I have a wide ribcage and my curve is really high up from the front, but low from the side, I have big thighs but small calfs, so nothing ever fits
Whats worse is beaing tall and skinny. Like you look like a 5 year olds best effort of a stick figure. I pity bella even more cuz... she's tall. Like 6 ft 2 tall
So true, poking holes in belts SAVED MY FRICKING LIFE 🤣🤣💀💀
Exact same im a freshman and i only weigh 83 pounds. And those comments SUCK
I would like to have some of those skinny person problems because I'm the extreme opposite of you right now
Heh number 5 with me snacking pretty much all day
I have the opposite problem🥲
as someone thats 49kg i understand all of these problems
I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING SO RELATABLE WTF I NEEDED TO SEE THIS 😭
You’re like 20 and 66 pounds, I’m 10 and 100 pounds 😅😂😅
I have the same problems but i think the last one may just be you 😂
says she can't dance- proceeds to bust banger moves😅😂
Oh hun it doesn’t matter if your skinny or not one one can dance
This is so true
Me watching this realizing I’m skinny as hell yet I can still eat a bunch of junk food…
that fifth one
Duuude I feel this I’m always cold I hate it
This is so true😂
Tall Skinny people dancing is the funniest lmao 😂
Ive always have insanely high anxiety, it kicks my metabolism into hyper drive.... I actually eat a lot and you can see my ribs. Eating isn't even fun anymore, it a chore but I gotta eat every two to three hours of I'm awake. 🤷🏼 People always say there jealous I can eat like I do and stay skinny..... I'm not I just wanna pack on at least a few pounds so I can no worry!!!!!
"I CANT DANCE" I can't dance ether..Twins!
I can only relate to the first and last ones
That’s why I’m always cold. I’m 10 almost 11 and I’m only 65, 70 pounds and you can see my ribs no matter what I’m doing. And don’t forget how EVERY little thing hurts. Scratch, your dying. Red mark, your in pain. You fall and cut your knee, your screaming, ITS CAUSE WE HAVE NO FREAKING MEAT TO PROTECT OUR NERVS AND MUSCLE
Did that thing really just say 66.8 pounds 💀💀💀
Thanks I’m literally like 5-9 kilograms underweight so I really relate to this❤
I'm toooooooo skinny
Sooooooo true this always happen🥲 i hate it
I can eat 5 McDonald’s burgers and gain 20 pounds and burn it in an hour while doing nothing
Your also like 8 ft tall... no wonder you can't dance 😂 (this is ment with humor in mind) I'm 5"1 and only 100 lbs. I have proof. I KNOW
And that is why I started working out 👍
Me too Jayus. and for the dancing bit- i’m a ballet dancer, idek how that works.
"Do you eat?"  Yes. Yes I do. I eat enough in a day to feed a family of 5. If I didn't have the metabolism of a f***ing jaguar, I would literally be on the show, My 600lb life.
nah but why is this literally me.  i got told i was an anorexic skeleton the other day :) fun times
This is my sad life
Bro wonyoung (From IVE) is very skinny and can dance lol, its just u.    (NO HATE)
My perents thought i didnt eat but my older sister was trying to prove them wrong 😑 😂i only eat things i  like😂❤
Me too skinny I'm overweight still have the belly I've been dieting I've been eating right but nothing's working and still got the belly at least you can Bust a Move
I don’t think the last one was a skinny person problem  Lmfao
I wouldn't say skinny your perfect 🤷‍♂️
U just described me😢😂
Omg now I know why I’m always so cold
I think I heard an obvious lie when you said you couldn't dance.
Are we the same person??
I feel you😭😭
And then you put on some weight and they say you need to lose it and are you sick, what happened?
Well im a little overwaight and I got comments like go eat a salad and you should stop eating so much and it really hurt me. But now that im older I dont give a frick about people that say things like that, like my ex bff called me fat because I wasent as skinny as her. But im still a bit overwaight but nowdays I dont really give a frick. 😊❤
You should buy a weaved fabric belt I’m also kinda skinny 😅
You just having trouble dancing because you're white just kidding
I miss being skinny though ):
Any time ⟟ say “I’m full” at dinner my dad says you need some meet on your bones…⟟ was 8
I relate to the dance and eat part ppl be out here saying dO tHeY FeEd YoU?
So apparently skinny people and overweight people have a lot in common
My sister once said: "Y'know, I wish Zeke (her dog) could just take out your bones, put meat on them, then put them back."  Yes, she was like 5-6, but still. That's stuck with me and it was just about 8-9 years ago. So that was fun
Last one is a skill issue
😯 bro I know who sits in the middle seat in the car🤣
If it’s any comfort I’m fat af and can’t dance to save my life
I am currently 5’3… short af… also skinny af… I blow away in the wind… no I mean literally if the wind is strong enough which surprisingly isn’t that much will physically push me back…
💀 YOU STOLE MY DANCE 💀
never related so much. especially the eating one. i hate it when my family is like ‘eat more u look like a stick’, ‘u need to eat more meat so u can gain some fat’. 😑
I can’t do sit ups because my tailbone hurts so bad when I do it because skinny person problems🤦‍♀️ (because in PE, we have to do sit ups on hard concrete)
Well, you can learn how to dance with dance classes and it helps if you have Ass but I don’t either and I get high scores at my competitions and I am not flexible
You dance better then me -
I CANT DANCE Jayus fances better than I could ever dance me:ate you serious
Nah fr tho
I get a lot of this comments like do you even eat you need to eat go eat when I do eat I get fat-shamed
Wdym you can’t dance? those moves are better than mine-
Thx for the reminder I’m to skinny
I’ve been waiting for someone to make this video my whole life
Nah you not being able to dance is your problem probably genetics or something
I can relate, even with the dancing
I can't dace  Her:💃💃💃💃
Omg I can relate, especially with the comments 😭😭
why do I relate to this so fucking much😭
fr though
This is not the first time I’ve heard somebody talk about  tall people problems because I have a friend she is 13 weighs 90 pounds and is 6ft and 2in
I was at the pool then other day with my son and there were other ladies there too. They were all overweight. Another lady comes in and she is thin and has one of those cool mermaid tails you swim with. I was the only one complimenting her on the tail and her previous military status while the other ladies decided to take a jab and make a joke "oh you can't be in here with us chubbies with that six pack" and laughed it off as a joke. Why was that even necessary to say!?
And being flat omfg its so annoying
As a former curvy and muscled girl, I confirm: I hate being skinny. Stop telling me to go eat a burger, I can barely finish my ONE PLATE without getting too full and hurting. I feel awkward, and I hate feeling my tailbone. Not, did I ever think I would be able to eat cereal out of my own collarbone.....   I wanna be beefy again 😭
wait wait wait, how much did it say they weighed!? i’m literally going blind
100%
ive never seen a stick try to dance
oh trust me i sure as hell aint skinny but i cant dance for shit either .. dont beat urself up over it haha
I feel the same way cause I will eat so much and only gain 1 or 2 pounds like whyyy
Bro the people in the world needs to stop if you're too skinny or too fat they make fun of you yall need to stop it's not cool
When i sit  i a certan position my rib touches my hip
I have never resonated with something so much
I relate to these problems -
112 pounds...so same
Drink a coke everyday
The "eat a burger" comments were the worst, especially since I ate an ungodly amount and it just didn't do shit to me. Although, after like 6 years of trying I'm finally an OK 150 lbs. Better than 110 lmao
Only 5 was not relatable
Dude, I’ve got curves and I can’t dance either! Wanna trade! 😂
I feel you- One problem I also have is my lungs don't have enough room, so I have trouble breathing.
Yes, All the bone pains, but I’m so glad the dancing thing is just because I’m skinny
all skinny people are really tall and the thing about lying on your ribs cause they get bruised is true
“I CAN’T DANCE”  you can dance better than anybody I know in person
That's shits FUCKED UP to say to a kid yeaaaaah 🤣 🤣 🤣 lmao
Still got better dance than me
You’re still a better dancer than I’ll ever be :,)
Especially the comments, I've had so many comments before, especially from my grandparents when I was younger, always trying to feed me more thinking I wasn't eating and looking back at it it's like "that was fkd up"
Society doesn’t make any sense they be like omg I can almost see your skeleton or “do you even eat” and then gains weight omg lose some weight,”you should go on a diet” this is why society do make any sense hate these dang moldy rats/roaches my god!
Everything but the Bruises and Can't dance part. I CAN DO EVERY THING ELSE
I am almost underweight and I can relate to like half this. Tha part about being cold is just not correct (at least not for me but idk) because I am a warm person.
I was like 30 when I realized the people with a dump truck can sit on a stadium bench for three hours no problem. My six foot, buck-fifty ass can last about 45 minutes.   And rollercoasters are just a bruse factory.
All I can say is Amen
Don't fall for it Miss. The only proper weight gain is building muscle.
my parents tell me to hold on if i dont in going to fly away in the wind
Omg I am skinny to and most of these are relatable lol
can’t dance  maybe that’s cause ur gay   (not being homophobic i’m les)
My best friend 1 is extremely skinny and me and her were staying at the other best friends 2 house and her mom told best friend 1 to eat more and maybe she can plump up some mire
“I CAN’T DANCE” At least your dancing is better than mine
It's the same for overweight people 😅
People always say that stuff to me 🥺🥺
This hit too close to home for me, practically an adult and I've rarely seen my weight over 100,
Tip for belt issues buy a flexible belt they don't look the greatest but you don't have to worry about wholes you can poke through anywhere
One word: rollercoaster, every damn time I went to like Disney or universal or something the bar would never go all the way down, and it was scary. Luckily I’m at a healthy weight now but I still remember the struggles
Bruh this is more true than anything I have ever seen on YouTube thanks for sharing this you are a legend lol for us skinny asses
As a skinny kid the you not being able to dance is a skill issue
I swear bc ppl call me stick boy💀
I eat alot i mean alot and im still skinny
Oh my absolute god this is so fucking accurate
Bro I have a bigger chest idk how but I’m rlly skinny so like nothing fits 😭 and I have a long torso
FOR REAL 😂
Hey I'm overweight and I can't dance either.
U have LITERALLY explained my ENTIRE LIFE!
I can confirm.
im a 13 male that’s skinny and 5’2
But that's all I do is eat it won't work 😢😢😢
Honestly i wanted to be skinnier so bad that it created an ED still do wanna be skinnier and its just sad tbh...
Dude I can lift you up with ease and your kinda lucky
SMH fr you should get a lil cushion for your chair
not knowing how to dance has nothing to do with being skinny..
This is too true for me. The seatbelt one is just too much😢
when ur skinny as heck but you're also short as fuck so everything that fits me comes from the kids section of the stone.
when I was little they told me if I stood sideways and stuck out my tongue I would look like a zipper.
I agree with every thing besides 5 and 6😅
Yeah I have bulimia now and still never get any weight no matter how much food I eat  😄🙂
She is right,some ppl think that skinny shaming is not real,but oh boy it is
Yeah I can very much relate
😮, you weigh less than me and I’m 14!!!….sorry that sounded wrong I didn’t mean to target or anything like that
I have to make holes to my fucking CLOCK!!      (The one you wear on your wrist.)
I understand this wayyy to much 😂😭 I can’t gain weight and people ask if my parents feed me, I eat way more than my family 😂
Right now I'm really skinny and weigh like 65 pounds (I'm supposed to be in The 100) and I can relate to all of these 😂 except the belt one I just wear shorts that you can make tighter
One good thing about being chubby:  I'm always warm
someone finally gets it. Andd it was always so fun to dress in all black and scare my siblings at night cuz with a tall skinny figure they think its terrifying.
I feel you, bro
You dance better than me💀
Every single one of these are true
“I can’t dance!” The does it better than ANYONE
Skinny lives matter😂
Bro my parents used to say I should audition for one of those starving African ads. 😂
Looks like you can dance to me
Skinny gang 👇
"I wish I was skinny as you" NO YOU DONT
I am 10 and I am really skinny and it hurts for everything you just said and yeah I’ve been called skinny way too many times and like why why am I crying kid that is very young like that I know I’m 10 and gets under peoples nerves but
me who wants to be skinny: 😐
Yep, I can relate to all of that 😂😂😂
I can’t dance either but I’m fat as fuck😊😊
being fat has the same issues
I think the last one was a you problem, not a skinny person problem
I am so skinny and you would think I would be packing in the pounds the way I eat. Im trying desperately to gain wait as I am twelve years old and about sixty seven pounds
Me being super sciny and I’m freezing cold right noe
I have a same problem
God please don’t dance on that channel again you said that you can dance and that was really true
You can't dance fucker I can't dance unless you can't a partial ass moonwalk
I can relate especially the cold
As someone who once lost 20 pounds in a month due to comments that made me feel like I was overweight, I can confirm. Still skinny. Still cold af
The belt one is so relatable 😭
I was skinny af too. When I finally achieve a healthy weight I started hearing from people around me that I looked better when I was too skinny...
I think the dancing is just a you thing
I went from super morbidly obese to skinner than most people and I can confirm all of this.
My arms are really skinny so I hate when people say “your not strong enough, look at your arms, eat more” that makes me really insecure 😞.
It's fucken true which is why i have such a high pain tolerance 😅 i was not a normal kid in the slightest 😅
hahah i know how it feels
My sister got accused of being anorexic by our mom because my sister is naturally really skinny and doesn't eat that much.
OMG BELLA JUST DESCRIBED ME IN 1 VIDEO😂
Bella get of the sink
It's okay to know how to dance
Realateble a 100%
Ong I hate being so skinny sometimes 😭💀
RELATE 100% and sometimes Im just laying down with my phone on my chest and it will literally move up and down because of my heartbeat..I'm so thin you can SEE my heart beat
Me and my mom are mad skinny lol
As someone who was also dangerously underweight for the longest time I gotta say the comment that hurt most was when I would get excited and tell someone “look I gained some weight!” And they’d turn around like “you should be happy you’re that small I know too many people who would love to be that small” like I’m sorry ReBeccA lucky you for having skin on your bones!
As a skinny person I can confirm that those are very true
Facts 😭
I can so relate. Was extremely skinny til 25 years of age. Pll thought I was anorexic. The amount of junk food I ate - insane
You dance better than me lol
I feel you there with me being 114 pounds and im 19
Hey! Some who has an ED here, If you are skinny or truggling with a ED, Im sure you have dabbled in the people saying "eat more your so skinny" to "uhm that's your 3rd serving leave some for us little piggy" No matter what you look like someone has something to say about it. If you are fat "you let yourself go" if you are skinny "you are just starving yourself". We really need people to stop making fun of people for how big they are. I understand there is a line between making fun of someone to generally caring and wanted them to get help. Some people can be very sensitive with topics of food, weight, and ED so please be kind when talking about these topics. Thank you.
I RELATE TO THIS SO BAD IM A SKELETON AND I GET SO FVCKING FAST AND I CANT DANCE😂😂😂😂
If eating don’t work… hit the gym and eat…
I’m double jointed so it makes stuff worse I was told by my athletics teacher that they always thought I would break something by just running and it’s like I’ve almost died twice in this class and I’ve been alive long enough to make it here so it’s probably a matter of time
If you get to cold just cuddle me I have all the warmth lol
My entire life I’ve been really skinny compared to other people my age and all my friends have told me I look like I have anerexia and at one point in sixth grade in PE we were running a people behind me were making fun of me calling me noodle arms and skeleton and when I was in kindergarten I would get remarks from adults saying omg did that skeleton just talk and omg you have chicken legs and they would watch me cry sometimes and then laugh 😘
I just go : new outfit for the next year bin !
being made fun by people is worst “go eat something” “he might fly away” “bros a minecraft skeleton” its fucked i can never gain anyone’s respect because im not strong either like “twig” kinda hurts on the inside ngl
Fat ppl: "eat less" thin pll: "eat more"
I have never related so much to a video before 😭😭💀💀
Skinny = ugly  You + Skinny = pretty af
For real one of my high school teachers wrote this in my year book, “Go eat a cheese burger for me this summer.” 💀 Bruh…
When I was like 8 my friend mom told me to go eat 10 hamburgers
Ur dancing skills are so slay
STOP IM SO SO SO UNDERWEIGHT AND THIS IS ALL SO TRUE
when I was little, we were having pe class, I was very skinny so I always wore long, wide clothes. and scome girl was wearing shorts and my bestie. MY BESTIE SAID, "look st that girl shes like a skeleton. "....
I have also been skinny my whole fucking life 🤦🏼‍♀️
Bro throwing it back😂
The fact that my parents and family make those skinny jokes about me and considering that they shouldn’t be saying that to me as a child or at all
Bro I was so incredibly skinny during middle school and people assumed I was anorexic. I actually ate alot and had a fast metabolism. People should be aware of EDs but also sometimes people are just skinny.
Also I’m skinny and tall so I need clothes to be long but there always to wide
Bro I know the struggle I am always getting bullied case I’m skinny
Seeing jayus try to dance reminds me of... Well... Me.
BRO IM SKINNY ASF AND PEOPLE BE LIKE "oh ur so lucky" NO KATIE IM NOT- (katie is someone random i  made up)
As someone who is not skinny, i can’t dance either.
Sooooooo... should I take this as to be happy that I'm a chonky boi then? I mean, sure. Also, epic dance moves.
Belt probs? Go get yourself a “Groove life” belt. I’ve got two (planning on a third) Best purchases I’ve ever made 😎👍
It true
People say that I'm lucky to be skinny.. I don't think so. I can confirm this is what happens to me
Im not that skinny im 125 pounds and 5'5 (i think that's average) but my god pants don't fit at this specific part of my waist and if i get high waisted jeans they will most likely beto big or small and i hate belts and have to post new whoes in them
Oh so that’s why I can’t lie on my stomach without hurting my ribs I don’t get bruised but it still hurts
Bruh I have/had every one of these especially the dance one
I know right I mean I eat a lot but barly gain weight and all theresona you listen are true for me
We got self defense in our elbows though
I was pretty built when I was 16, but one year on 4th of July I had an accident involving a 15ft rock face a lake and a rock that was very close to the Surface of the water that was not visible.  So basically I was at a family friends house and my mother’s friend asked me and a few other family members if we would like to jump of a cliff into some water, and of course all of us being teenagers we said yes (This was also a grown woman whom we trusted to not kill us). She she drove us on her boat to the “jump area” and basically told me to go first which I did. I swam right over where I would go in not feeling anything or seeing anything, I then climbed up the side of the cliff face and jumped in pencil dive feet first… And hit a rock straight away from 15ft up, I then stood up and the water was right up to my waist. Everyone was very shocked that I was standing in such shallow water and so was I, I think the reason I was not in pain was adrenaline but we ended up stopping that straight away and quickly rushed me back to the lake house, where I waited for like 5 hours just sat in a chair. It turned out she went to the wrong place also so yeah. But my legs and ankles ended up swelling like two times their normal size and became extremely painful. To not ruin the fun for everyone else I had to wait there. We would end up getting home late and my parents told me they would take me to the hospital. The next day we got to the hospital and told the doctors what happened, they all looked very shocked and told me that I didn’t look great or something. I had like 12 X-rays to check my legs, ankles, back, neck, and other stuff. By some miracle nothing was broken like nothing at all and the doctor said that I should be completely paralyzed or dead, somehow not even a bone was broken. I did however have two pretty bad sprains in both my ankles.  I would end up having braces. Then like two months later I would have to go back because I was having really bad knee problems and had to get braces for them. Then like a month later my back would go down hill. I would end up being in crutches for a whole year. Throughout that whole time more things going wrong, as well as my legs and feet turning dark purple constantly. And that would all suck. Through all of the not being able to move my legs and stuff I would lose a lot of weight in my legs and butt and it looked very un proportionate to the rest of my body. Basically what I am saying is I understand that thing about sitting on chairs and how it hurt loads from having no meat down their. Also pretty cool but the first step I took was exactly a year after the accident happened on 4th of July.
I am extremely skinny but one problem I have is I am underweight and extremely tall like I’m 5’1 for a child and the problem I always have was either my hips were to big to fit my pants or I was too tall to fit them and that is why I were leggings  Edit: And I can’t dance either
This is comforting to see because no matter what I do, I can't gain weight. I am young, but so far I have always been skinny😅
THE PAIN IS SERIOUS ON MY RIBS
I have Crohn's. My weight fluctuates between 92 & 225 lbs. When I'm skinny I am not taken seriously because I'm too skinny to have opinions about weight & diet & lifestyle. When I am large I am misdiagnosed and treated poorly. When I'm skinny I get free upgrades on car rentals. When I'm large I get told my pain (Spondylo-Arthropathy)  is because of depression and inactivity not because I've had autoimmune issues since age 18. I almost died of blood clots because I was too fat for people to believe I was telling the truth. I feel you. Most people can't say that it stinks to be both too skinny and too fat. At too skinny it's always "You need to eat something!" Or "You're so skinny, how can you know what it is like to live life as a fat person?" I feel your pain. Why is so much of life and medical care based on an antiquated idea of weight? 23 years and I'm still confused  & frustrated.
You got some moves
It's somewhat true lol😂
It is f up to say those things to a kid
sitting hurts so much so I sit in weird ways to accommodate for it, clothes never fit and I always get the braided belts so I can go as small or large as I need, whenever I tell people my struggle with body image they are like “you’re so skinny, you’re lucky”, I am freezing cold all of the time, the comments about weight are bad, I am a dancer so I think I dance decently,
As a person whos very skinny by the stomach im just a kid and people tell me "do you even eat?" "Your so skinny eat some meat!" It hurts. Please think about what it'd feel like someone instulting you about your body.
I am also like this but that dancing one just hits hard
and like laying on your back hurts your spine/tailbone so badly lol. like omg I can’t even with that. 😀
I feel that
Idk that dancing was kinda sick man
I’ve had all those problems, but now just barely in this last year I’ve been getting muscle and bulking hard, and now I weigh towards my body weight that I used to have last year😊
I am skinnier than you ever were and j have to deal with all of those my whole life I have to gain weights j have to eat more but yet I don’t eat breakfast or lunch but snacks constantly and dinners are huge for me so I say my figure of skin and bones! I am in 90  degree weather and I am freezing my but off YAY!!!
Can’t dance??? Excuse me, you absolutely slayed that!
when i was 7 or 8 i would fit into 5ts cause i was so skinny
im skinny af and i am the best dancer in my house, my taekwindo stodio, and my frind group
its way worse being chubby
I was really skinny when I was younger and one of my close family friends said that I was so thin it was like the wind could just pick me up and sweep me away :(  Stuck with me cuz I’ve remembered that for years
Bro you way less than me and I’m 10
I think the last ones a personal problem
*I think thats a you prob...*
Could you do (though you may not know from personal experience) normal sized people that have baby fat or something?
NAH BRO IN FORTH GRADE I WAS BULLIED FOR NOT EATING, AND WHEN I TOLD MY "FRIENDS" THEY SAID IT WAS NOT BULLYING AND MADE IT ABT THEM 😔😭😭🤡
FACT
I was always a skinny kid but then age happened and now im skinny but i have fat hips lmao 😂
Y u always standing on a table or something XD
I used to be a stick like you then my thyroid said fuck you 😂   Im so freakin tired all the time, those thyroid lows really get ya 😩
I can't dance so i just mimic taunts from TF2
Same
as someone who literally poked a new hole in their belt THIS MORNING i can relate (:   but i wouldnt really class myself as skinny...but then again i do have massive dysmorphia
i heard avicodos work
A Lot Of Those Are True Btw, That Is The Best Way I've Ever Seen Someone Dance
I have all most of these problems except the dance one because I do that competitively but it makes it hard to stick with my partner when I have to turn my back into a crescent moon so that there is an okay connection ( this is ballroom dance).
When i do sit ups EVERY SINGLE BONE IN MY BODY GETS BRUISED. Painful
My best friend, her sister, my parents, my sister, every single person I knew said “go eat a burger you’re gonna snap in half” thanks for making me insecure at 7 years old everyone
I and one of my friend in school is shinny and for some reason we love water i don't konow why
Another thing is that people٫ WITHOUT CONSENT WHICH IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT٫ will try and pick you up. They'll just scoop you up ٫and if they've never done that to you before٫ you might cry. that's what I did.
I feel like the dancing part in a skill issue
I’ve been chubby for a while, not fat, not skinny, fuckin chubby. My legs look like steak, my arms are like French fries, and my tummy has a whole meat sack.   One time I was sitting on my tailbone, and it hurt so bad but I stuck with it because it felt cool. When I got up, it was tingling. I kept trying to rub it to make it stop and it was still tingling. Overtime it died down, but it was so damn painful
The butt bone this is soooo true!!!!!!!!!!😂
Yep all trye
I related with every part of this. Including the can't dance XD
i wore a jacket everywhere up until high school because girls would grab my wrist comment on how skinny i was and ask me how i got so skinny. it made me feel so bad abt myself because i thought i was causing problems
As a child my mom feed me so much i eat almost every hour of the day.
Do tall problems nexy
I don't know whether it's the facts .... but man you're hilarious and right though.😅😂😂
Me as a fat person who doesn't have these problems absolute W
As a skinny person ( whom breathe in to much you can see and feel the bottom of my rib cage) all of this information is true
growing up i was always told "ur so tall and skinny, u could be a model" which kind of made me have an eating disorder cuz i thought i wasnt allowed to gain weight or i wouldnt be viewed as pretty
As someone who is skinny (I'm not complementing myself) this is very relatable
For real
I've always been "on the chubby side" as my mom says (overweight), and tbh this made me feel better about myself :)
I honestly think your a wonderful dancer
I DIDNT WEAR BELTS CAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS TOO BIG AND I WAS AFRAID OF MAKING NEW HOLES SO I JUST KEPT WEARING SHIRTS THAT COVERED MY ASS AND PRAYED
Also the hip bones hurting when you lay down on the floor 😭
Bro frrrrrrrrrr
Bro I’ve been through all those same problems my whole life except the last one. I hit the gym and did a ton of sports and now I’m just lean and eat like a horse with all the same problems.
Ok i cant stop watching jayus, so im gonna comment  In the nicest way possible, if you hate being skinny, fix it.....i mean idk what to tell you man
I feel u and they told me to go eat a burger I did and they looked at me like 😟. 😂😂
confirmed
no wonder im always so goddamn cold
This is why I use belts with holes all the way around
Meanwhile my doctor telling me to eat whatever I want an it doesn't matter the amount cuz I was crazy underweight and people STILL called me fat even though I'm STILL BUILT LIKE A FUCKIN STICK: 😊
Ok I can relate to every single one of these, especially the lack of insulation one- I love snorkelling, except I get so cold because of lack of insulation, plus the fact that my thighs are too skinny for my wetsuit. It so annoying 😭
"I can't dance!" *terrible 🕺💃 commences*
I've been fat and skinny. My ass bones always hurt
Finally i see some skinny people problems it so wack people say its hot out and im fine in a hoodie
Jayus: *starts 'dancing'* Me: What the f#ck are you doing?
Hmmm, i dont think being skinny is a direct cause of bad dancing.
I'm 100 over wheight and everything here is the same, except for assholes who randomly say, hey look, a burger as if I'm done sort of dog cow pig hybrid😅
I’m literally 87.4 pounds💀
If you are skinny but tall, I think you will be better at dancing, cause longer arms and longer legs leads to more defined moves, and if you're skinny, they look longer.
I am underweight and skinnyaf and my family tells me I am too skinny but then other people tell me I look beuatiful amd perfect so like-
She was fighting demons while trying to dance 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The downside of being a skinny wannabe dancer is that I can't shake my ass.
Bro I could eat the same meals as the fastest person in the world and still be skinny (not trying to be rude to whoever sadly got that record)
Omg yesss I thought it was only me!! I relate to everything you said!!
i hate that people think that eating more will make you gain weight, for some people it doesnt work
Fun fact: fat is not a reasonable insult it both benefits and harms us - the fat guy on youtube
That last one is just a skill issue
When I was younger one of my friends came up to me and said “do you know how easy you would be to kidnap” and I just stood there like 😮
Fat perso n here you probably can't dance not because your skinny also still better dancer then me
Ngl, I'm skinny, but my body type just means I'm always squishy, so I don't get the comments about not eating enough
I have all of these problems! Especially the comments from society. That and along with some other things is why I’m prob gonna have childhood trauma:)
THE WORST IS HAVE UR WRIST GRABBED AND PEOPLE GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HOW SKINNY YOUR ARE AND SHIT
for the record if you have problems with belts not fitting correctly i recommend getting a tactical belt. you wont have to deal with the holes on traditional belts anymore and thier much easier to adjust to fit you. and they will last a lot longer to.
IM GLAD SOMEONE GETS IT
i'm really fuckin skinny too. i physically cannot gain enough weight
I was 33kgs all my highschool life and I was bullied so much. (AU)
As a skinny person, I can confirm that I cannot dance
I get cold fast fast & I weigh only 110 soaking wet, I understand completely about the hole skinny thing
Im 94.5  Edit:pounds clarification
nah you can dance
The society bit hit me in the heart…and really god damn hard too🥲
As someone who got told all their lives to "eat more or the wind will blow you away" I can fully agree with this
I couldn't get to 150 lbs until I was 30 then poof I was 250 & kept gaining weight finally over 300 & would get tired walking to take a piss I worked at it & am currently happy right around 210 & at 6' tall it's a good weight for me
WHYYYY is this so relatable!!!! It could be 110 degrees outside on the hottest day in summer and I would probably still bring my favorite fluffy big ass jacket everywhere I go!!!!
The only good thing is eating unlimited fast food except for when it hurt and you feel like your ribs will stab your stomach
Everything she said is true. I'm very skinny.
hey I used to be skinny as fuck when I was 7 or 8 and I can relate to this
Why is the s*** too relatible
Any skinny person can relate when you HIT ur FUNNY BONE it feels like HELLLL
Fr I’m 12 and 80 pounds people always tell me to “ just gain weight it’s not that hard” like um yes it is or at least for me   And I’m trying so hard to eat more but when I eat it all goes away like I never eat
yep these are all true as someone who's been very skinny their whole life
Its so enoing
ok but  when your fat it a whole different story like i got bullied for being overweight at throught ELEMENTARY school, the worst part is that even fatter people were the one bullying me but i didn't have it in me to strike back and i still got bullied my skinny people.  also your close dont fir but the toher way your need to spend more money like when you re skinny you could buy smaller clother unless you are really fuckin tall like bella but when you are big you need to spend a lot of money and big shirts that are probaly really ugly bc they have to make then really big
I think by the “I can’t dance one” you mean you can’t juggle anything and it’s relatable to me 😭
Broooo is that why my ribs are in so so much pain rn
Nah she became a dinosaur in the end
I really couldn’t  care less about the comments people made on your weight especially considering the racial slurs you have used in the past your ritz cracker lookin ahh
SAME!!!!!!
Being someone who's overweight this does comfort me a bit. Everyone goes through different stuff and society treats us all poorly. I also despise the cold so haha >:D
I have a friend with the same struggles and I feel for her she's underweight and I'm overweight so one common thing we share with weight is belt holes 🥲
The worst part is people don't think your feelings are even valid
SAME!!
Same and omg so true
I get cold so fast even tho it’s summer and people say it’s warm
I do not miss being underweight. Not that I enjoy being over weight but I will take it any day over walking and feeling my ribs try to poke through my skin.
It's so much better than being fat! You are more fortunate than you realize...
OmG SAME
I got called stick all my life😢
I'm skinny too
Same
See I have a dad bod, but my arms are skinny people arms and my legs are kinda decent for a girl which I have no use for
If ur belt doesn't fit u can use children belts
Idc I just want to be skinny
I'm still skinny and got up to a good weight of 126 now
Bella, you’re officially invited to any dance party ever.
Yaaaaaa I'm 16 and whegh 90 pounds
Barely any energy as well
Finally, somebody understands me🥹🫶🏻
All of these are so true 😭😭
Dude id kill to take your weight
Better than me😅
What I’m getting is that skinny people struggle mostly with physical problems and fat people struggle with emotional problems Both valid of course
Now get it Jayus.
finally- someone who also has this problem! the sitting one is so true for me, aswell as the "eat more!"
You just explained my life. my ribs hurt
Me to they say that the wind is going to take me  im 9 years
Fr and my friend is always like OMG you’re so skinny like I know you don’t have to bring it up
Yah it's so mean skinny shaming is as bad as fat shaming like comments I get from my friends and strange people  Omg the skeleton got out again 10/10 very creative  Your skinny now but you'll be fat one day 2/10why just why  Omg I wish I was skinny like you -3/10 you try wear jeans    Wow I can snap you in half 4/10 suing for attempted murder  You'll never get a boyfriend with a body like that -10000/10excuse me random lady I met in the park who has 3 kids and is getting divorced
I used to have a normal weight but then I got skinny and now my heart hurts when I lay looking up for some minutes. Being skinny may not be but the fact that it started as soon as I got skinny
You dance WAY better than me 🤣 and gurl, that is not a skinny people problem! I'm huge and can't dance for shish!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Same just exactly same
Me and my one friend have opposite issues related to weight I'm slightly overweight and I can't lose it no matter what I do, and she's underweight and can't gain weight easily! Because of our friendship I've gotten a lot more used to how there are problems on both sides of the scale.
Even as an overweight person, i relate to the bruises on my ribs from laying down because my fat tissue compresses a lot when I lay down
Damn those moves were fire
Fat people like me can have the first 3 problems. At least you can walk into any clothing store or shop online and everything is not only in your size but you look amazing in it. Fat people, 80% of all the nice clothes are unwearable, if something is available it's more expensive or brands made for us are HELLA expensive and can often look like old lady stuff.
Justin some sick moves😂❤
F*** that dude you can dance looked awesome
Vegan teacher ahh dance
My belt can litteraly only just got round my head    And my head sint big
Why is you’re room so hot why aren’t fitting on you there the smallest size
bro my friends call me a stick 😭
As a skinny ass person I can totally agree. If someone wants to order a pizza for me I'd really appreciate it
My mom was told she could blow away in the wind
The ”gets cold easy” Made me think-  ” am I… Skinny?” Well heck yea-  I almost passed out two days ago for forgetting eating 💀
As an very underweight person  this describes me a lot :'D Trying to get my weight back as it should be but hell it's freaking difficult when your body burns food faster then you can eat them >.> But some people jsut don't get it at all and keep saying ''Go eat more'' ''Do you eat plenty?'' ''You really should eat'' I hate eating with people bc of these stupid comments they don't know whats going on behind thecurtains i would say ^
her last dance move tho🤣😭💀
It's true T-T
Be an Indian and you’ll get all the aunties to call you skinny in the 1st second you walk through the door
I'm so skinny that my ribs stick out more than my boobs
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS ME
I GET IT!!
Bro same
Ballet. Bella, jayus, whatever you like, I’m skinny. Tall af. And ballet? Ballet.
You just described my whole life- like how
Hit the griddy and you’ll be good
I am super skinny and am literally told that if someone were to kidnap me I would not be able to fight back and people always try to pick me up even if I tell them not to like WTH
Relatable😅
why is the last one the most true
Dancing is a skill ppl can learn, not some innate ability for certain weight classes.
not being able to dance isn't to do with you being skinny you just suck ass
holy shit the dancing thing is real. as a latina, dance is a huuuuggee part of our culture, and it’s rlly awkward cus i can’t move my hips for the life of me
I relate so much 😂😂  Even clothes my mom makes hardly fit😢
This is literally me
I’m 120 pounds in eight grade. I’m not like a bigger person but I’m pretty tall so that may be it.
So ture i was born very early and only weighed 1 pound and 15 ounces its like non of my clothes fit and i get so cold easily
You can't dance my ass
Same and I’m tall for my age and so it’s like I’m tall and skinny. It doesn’t work out very well.
You just need the practise dancing I've been good since I was 4 years old
I'm skinny as f*ck and I can literally relate to all of this I just can't gain weight
I feel like nobody talks about skinny people problems I literally only got to a healthy bmi/weight a few months back and I cant seem to put on any pounds :(
This is all literally so true 😭 Like, when I was younger (and I still get comments like this) family members would LITERALLY said that I needed to go eat junk food so I wouldn’t be so skinny and my 8 year old self would just be there like: 👁👄👁. Oh and btw, I can’t agree in the dancing one, I’ve have taken dance classes all my life and I’m not bad 😉😌
I am also skinny and this explained everything.
The belt thing is so relatable! I either turn it into a lose waist belt or I don’t wear it at all 😭
Okay, the belt thing got me, but instead of belts i need to pock holes in every shoe with a strap i get.😂 seriously i can rap my hand around my ankle and close the loop😅. I dont understand why, especially because i hold a lot of weight in my calves, which only serves makes me look shorter
"I can't dance!"  OMG ITS A SKINNY PROBLEM
lol
all you gotta do to dance is shake your groove thang
yes very relatable...
My parents used to tell me “go eat a burger like omg”
I'm 16 and I'm always being told to go eat a sandwich but the problem is that I eat, I just can't gain weight. I have a super high metabolism and it's good but it also sucks because of the comments you get. And sitting down for too long sucks as well. Laying down on my stomach hurts my ribs and my hip bones. People always say "I wish I could he your size". Like no you dont. Being skinny sucks sometimes.
But also people will be like 'oh your so skinny I wish I were that skinny' and other annoying junk conversation no one cares about that I care too little about to remember
As a skinny person I went through all of these problems 😅
I relate to this
Like when you bump in to anything and you get a bruised for like a week
thank you for explaining my life, exept i can dance bc I'm on dance class haha
SAME!!!
Yessssssss
I feel you!
girl you got better dance moves then me
Bella is an entire mood.
Did she just crease her converse on the counter top!!!????
Your inability to dance has nothing to do with your weight.
and also people picking you up but most of the time i bite people when its someone i dont like picking me up since its quite literally the only thing i can do to get them to put me down so i think they got the message lol
Try being skinny as a male, when I get in a pool my entire ribcage is showing
nah cuz my dad told me when I was born he was to scared to hold me cuz he thought he was going break one of my bones 😭💀
So relatable and for those who are saying she killed it when she was dancing it's like dancing like a stick it sucks 😕
I can relate I need to poke 7 new holes in any belt I think of wearing
I don’t have this problem because I’m very over weight because I’m 11 and I’m 149 pounds
i get called skinny by my parents i force myself to eat food till im perfect weight with my height. you onow what i get. getting called fat by my mom
Bro I swear to god one of the worst things a about being unreasonably skinny is the comments like I’ll just be in pe and some kid will say my arms look like they would snap from a pushup
Why are people in red bathing suits so hotttttt  If you need me I’ll be having a mental crisis
as a member of the overweight community, i get cold and cant dance as well xD
am skinny, can confirm
I'm also skinny so during a storm I get pushed by wind 💀
Seriously
Why were those dance moves fire tho
Lol describing me
Finally someone who understands what it's like to be really skinny.
Finally some kind of realization
Lol I’m skinny too
I dont gain wieght when I eat fast food alot
Best dance moves ive ever seen in my entire life.
I am also very skinny like unhealthily skinny, and I can verify that all of these things are true, especially the society one, I was body shamed by a Dairy Queen in employee for being “too skinny, to order a large”.
I guess now i know why i was wearing a jacket in the middle of summer. Thank u.
Me, a person who is not skinny at all relating to all of these except for No. 5: 🧍🏼‍♀️
you can't lay down face down on the floor without your hip bones digging into the floor. It SUCKS
You just explained my entire life in one short
2 and 4
u can dance better than me 💀
I think the dancing is just you bestie
You explained my whole childhood as a skinny being 😅😢
I was asked by my giant, tall friend if "I was eating" and if "I got enough to eat" while having his hand wrapped around my wrist for a size comparison. People just don't.
Man ur a amazing dancer
Same bro
Bro I am not flat at all and I relate
"friends" called and still call me weak because I had zero muscle
Fr tho! I’m not really skinny, I’m just lanky, and I felt all of that. Except maybe the burger comment. But yeah, I’m constantly cold, I’m underweight, sitting or laying down certain ways hurts my bones, and my limbs are so lanky that unless I am taught a choreographed dance and I am given at least 8 business days to learn it, I cannot dance.
Thank youuuuuuu I’m almost 13yrs old and that has been my whole life story
i can do formal dances like the virginia reel the bellita waltz chicago glide the black hawk dances like that
Idk about anyone else but those dance moves are better than my future
this one time i was so skinny i almost flew away with the wind 😂😂
I can’t dance for sh!t either bruh😂😂😂😂
My legs are long and my waist is tiny... NO PANTS *EVER FIT ME AND IM SICK OF IT!*
I thought the rib thing was just me like my sides and ribs always hurt from sitting on my belly(⁠｡⁠ŏ⁠﹏⁠ŏ⁠)also the body shaming that ppl dont understand.
Bro my sister would always tell me I sound like the Minecraft skeleton when I walk
As a skinny person, i can totally relate 😭
im 5’3 and weigh just under 90 lbs. i work at an animal hospital and get so many bruises from slightly bonking into things and restraining dogs that weigh almost twice as much as me
them: GO EAT A BURGER Me: i gave up cow bec of highland cows…
I’m skinny and yes
Actually. Im a skinny kid, but im also obe of if not THE greatest dancer within my school.
Sitting down on hardass school chairs for 7-8 hours 5 days of the week for 10 months is not fun. Even with cushioning it takes alot for my ass bones to not want to bruise. Also everytime someone touches me they exclaim about how my bones are sticking out, people cant even lay their head on my shoulder because it hurts them
My parents say hold on to a poll if the wind blows
The bruises on your ribs IS SO TRUE, and the belt thing too, I genuinely cringe when I see ppl lying flat now because I just can't imagine it 😭
You can dance better than me and I am chunky 😂
Never related to someone more
Ik like yesterday at a family reunion my cousin told me to go get three slices of cake and 4 burgers and I would feel better like wtf I can be skinny and healthy geez-😢
I am so skinny and I eat a lot
I THOUGHT THESE THINGS WERE NORMAL?????
That is my life- my grandma once said "you need to eat a sandwich"😂
as a very skinny teenager (14) my record weight its 106 pounds and now im like 93-97 pounds and my mom says some of the stuff that jayus listed my mom also says i look sickly and threatens me with a feeding tube
Yup the belt one is me
THOSE DANCE MOVES ARE GORGOUS!!!! I DANCE, ALMOST EXACTLY LIKLE THAT,
And I’ve got the opposite, except as a small kid I used to be underweight now I’m pretty large
Tall skinny and nice, just like me and just how I like them  Before you believe me in the response, this is me being supportive. OK don’t get angry.  I suffer from all these problems as well. And that’s me being a boy so it carries over.
Yup, been skinny my whole life.  Come to find out I'm autistic which is one factor that lead to my ARFID. Avoidance restrictive food intake disorder
You can dance… just not twerk…
I thought the last one was just a me problem
Honestly this is so true
I'll take yours over mine anytime❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️  💕   ✌️ 💗
i heard my freind talking about me behind my back about how skinny i was and she said mean things so i was kinda sad  btw can anyone relate to their spine touching the chair while sitting down hurts its so annoying😭
Same! Except im just skinny, short and skinny
As a skinny guy can confirm
Honestly, I weighed 100lbs or less for the majority of my life as a 5'11" male. The comments and teasing I got gave me some pretty messed up body image issues and even to this day I still struggle with it despite gaining about 40lbs of muscle and being in the best weight/shape of my life I will still get comments about being scrawny. People act like skinny shaming isn't anywhere near as bad as fat shaming but it is.
The fact that all lf that is true, literally every single one of those are right and have happend to me 😭 (especially the one about people talking about it)
Believe me being fat feels a whole lot worse
Just to add to this people thinking we're extremely weak just because we're skinny sucks
I have a cool belt without holes it's like weaved it works well
Man , same !
Oh my god do you eat?!?   Me: hehehehhe no I don’t
GRANDPARENTS' COMMENTS ARE THE WORST    (is that just me?)
I'm very underweight and skinny as a bone and I suffer all these problems 😭 I don't like laying on my stomach on the floor because my bones stick out
The comments were my least fav bc EVEN MY DAD SAID IT. Ok so one time when he picked up his friend I had to smoosh myself between to baby seats and then he said good thing she ain’t fat. Like rude to say to your daughter that has feelings
Experiencing everything EVERYDAY especially DON'T U EAT ANYTHING ???
Yeah I’m skinny but really tall so yeah m convinced instead of getting fat I just get taller
I swear this shits funny, was it supposed to be funnt? Or am i just laughing at it because ive experienced the same things.  Where my tall skinny girls at?  ⬇️
Brooo same
Skinny people can’t dance  *Creates the moves of the century*
My life😂
i have to get  the edges of my pants fold and sewn to make the waist fit
Bro people always are amused as I a skinny person (no offence but sKiNnEr than you) eat 4 burgers in one go 😂😂😂😂
I'm 13 and I just got to 70 pounds - 5 years ago I was 45 pounds.
I thought it waa normal for your bones to hurt when you sit down-
I'm 13 and 65 pounds
Another comment for 5 is, omg you're so lucky you're skinny I wish I was as skinny as you, no no you don't I have struggled with hating how skinny I am for years and those comments didn't help at all. Also as for me as soon as I gained weight I hated it because I had gotten so use to being skinny and seeing my body that way I hated how I gained the slightest bit of weight
LITERALLY ME
I relate to #5 so gahdamn much and i eat like nickacado but cant gain any fucking weighr
All facts 🙃
My bestie is always laying on her stomach and I try to aswell and It hurts to bad when I get up 😂
My parents constantly say “Your going to fly away in the wind” Or “I can cut you in half like a twig” They constantly check my ribs, BUT I EAT. a lot. I’m just constantly skinny, AND ITS NOT AN ILLNESS, I’m just ✨skinny✨ Also I’m cold so I look like a walking blanket all day.💀 My mom always asks “ Why don’t you socialize??” PROBABLY BECAUSE IM INSECURE..🤷‍♀️
I'm not really skinny but I still have to poke holes into belts it could be because I have never bought a belt and they are all hand me downs but I bought one online actually and it fits but it did say it was only one size
Same
This is my whole life 😂
Not because when you are say a bit overweight or not skinny no hate…. you’re really hot during the summer, so yeah y’all get it easier in the summer
Yep. Im underweight and struggle with all of these. I am 11-15 and weigh 77lbs, broke 80lbs 2 months ago finally, then went back down..
"I cant dance" **proceeds to basically be god on the dancefloor next to my ass. I would be more awkward than a fish trying to stand**
POV me dancing around my homies
How did you just some up my life?
You just explained my whole life in less than 2 minutes 😭
I'm SO FRICKEN SKINNY AND MY MOM WANTS ME TO GAIN MORE WEIGHT
As a skinny person I give this vid an approve
So relateable i was severely underweight and physical classes were a nightmare including the people making fun of you
Personally i loved your moves☺
“Go eat a burger” yeah I’ve tried that, and it doesn’t work
Beautiful dance moves gurl ❤
Fellow skinny person here!! All of these are true lol  I was always told to eat some meat, they told me maybe you can finally stay in the pool longer 😅
SO FUCKING RELATABLE
The belt one and the cold one I can relate 💀
Personally I'm rilly tall and skinny, like a street lamp but I can't relate to cloths not fitting because I genuinely hate jeans so I always wear sweat pants which come with elastic bands and I prefer shirts and pants that are a bit baggie. Also because when I was younger I was always hearing that being skinny was healthy and attractive I always took people calling me a skeleton as an exaggerated joke/complement so I can't relate to wanting to gain weight, other than muscle mass but I only rilly care about being healthy not weight.
As a skinny person I would like to add something to this: I can't lye down on hard floors or do sit ups on hard floors without my spine, hip and sometimes shoulder bones hurting. also this might just be me but I am very weak to physical damage, like if one of my friends started roughhousing I would collapse immediately even when they went easy on me because of the weight difference (I wasn't ridiculously skinny 120~ pounds at 5'11 be they were like 180 at 5'8)
I only gained an acceptable amount of weight 10 years after having my kid but peoples coments were so harsh growing up.
You are definitely not skinny for European standards. There are many skinny people like you including myself where I live.
The belt thing hurt
The dancing has nothing to do with that 😂 look at K-pop idols lol
Yes I agree #relatable
I have those problems too
I’m 25 man and have weighed 140 since I was 14. I cant gain weight and when I get to healthy weight it only lasts like a month or two before I’m back to 140
The poking holes in the belt is so accurate though
Wait i thought sitting down hurts everyone's ass.. you just called me skinny then.
I was litteraly blown away by the wind once because im way to skinny
I relate 🤣 being a teen and 100 pounds on the dot is not fun with the cold and wind 😂
But the belt thing is too true… why can’t they just make tiny belts
shes not even that skinny
I can relate.  I pretty much have the body of a 7th grader.  I’m 24.
Bro I can't dance I was playing a game where there would be a circle of people saying a sentence forgot what it was but one person in the circle and walk around the circle choose someone and do a dance then you would switch with them for them to do ur dance and I did a fucking weired dance and she said wtf u was heart broken
NGL you dance better than me..cus holy hell last time I danced I ended up falling through a table
People never understand why hard seat hurt my butt!!!❤
Forget a belt, suspenders atw
now i have my answer that u are a girl , i have been cracking my head over this
You are a broadway dancer compared to me
They comments are the worse. Ppl said ‘OMG I wish I had your body!’  And to this day I weigh 24-30kg.
Exactly
Nobody cares
Oh my god so I have these same exact problem and like my boyfriend he has looked at me and is like omg are okay and I’m like why wouldn’t I be and he’s like well your sooo skinny and I’m just like ok I’m skinny and
Don't worry, I've got sort of issues with weight as well but quite the opposite and this year I finally gotten to what I'd prefer for myself but that's not what I'm commenting to say💀 I'm saying I can't dance either😭😭😭
See the thing for my is k have curves but I have the TINIEST (a lot of people would be love to have a waist like that, people have said to me, but it’s actually caused me a lot of health problems that I will always have so I kinda don’t like it) waist Bcs I don’t take care of myself ✌️🤪 so all my clothes fit everywhere else EXCEPT MY FVCKING WAIST!!! And if I go a size up doesn’t fit, if I go a size down it’s too tight so it DOESNT FIT!! Also it’s the same for me, when I lay down on my stomach for too long I’ll get bruises.
I can’t dance: Me in front of my dad in a public place trying not to fall on the floor dying with laughter 😂
Honestly, I’m happy you got into a healthy being really skinny seems hard
As a skinny person these are problems I have to deal with
Me being a stick my whole life And this checked all the boxes😂Especially they can’t dance one to
Oh my gosh I literally feel you, I am the exact same. Completely understand 😂
Same all of that is true
now i know why i can dance                             coz im 🌟FAT🌟
Nah ppl will can me slim jim😂
the last one is true af
My experience as a skinny person is that everyone would either tell me it's impossible that i actually eat more then them, that my parents probably starve or that i have an eating disorder. Also, everyone treats me like i could snap in half, have no strength at all (on the contrary, i'm quiet strong) or like i could faint easily (also not true). And when you say you were bullied for being skinny nobody believes you, cause "skinny people don't get hated on, your life is easy".
You can dance
True
Bro the 5th one hits 🏠 :(
U look great
The cold thing is so fucking true. My parents where VERY concerned when they saw how many blankets I have on my bed (like five normal thin blankets, a thick blanket, then two blankets that I saved up for such as a heated blanket with a weighted blanket on top of it.)
No cause y is all of this accurate, like have been in all of these situations😂 especially the comments and the belt holes😅
Bro I'm 14 and wear a M 7/8 😅
I'm not skinny, but laying down on my stomach will hurt my ribs (not enough to bruise them) too
I was apparently a perfect weight but literally everyone around me said I was "Fat" or "Skinny". Thing is I have Anorexia so thats nice :D
I was really underweight after getting sick and being in a coma (got down to 78lbs). It really sucked when people said shit like that…or just assumed I was a crack head or something. I could always feel the judgement.   On the flip side, I’ve also been overweight. That was WAY better for my mental health than being underweight. It was SO much harder to gain than loose it!
I have the exact opposite problem. Can we come to some happy medium with our BMIs?
I can't relate. I'm fat asf
SHES BUSTING A MOOOVVEE
Hold my beer honey.....  Even though I'm no longer a MALE "90lb weakling" who lived in an age of VERY toxic masculinity, you at least are a FEMALE, and I doubt you have had sand kicked into your face prompting you to order that "Charles Atlas" course from the back of any comic book.  You never had a "prom queen" or attractive "class slut" literally laugh at you for trying to dress like a "tough guy" and then subsequently being told by the same young ladies that "You need to put more MEAT on your body, if you're going to dress like that".  (Yes, as a VERY skinny "momma's boy", I tried to dress out of my league, and such jaded young ladies saw right through it!)  And you have more meat on you at your skinniest than I've seen on some VERY SERIOUS anorexics.  Bottom line?  Q.Y.B.**        **Quit your bitching😉🤣
THE BELT THO! I hate being skinny!
That’s my parents I tell them I eat but they don’t listen
For the belt one, there are some belts that are braided or knitted so they don’t need holes, every space in between the strands that conform it basically acts as a hole so you can adjust it better
I have a skinny friend, and I got introduced to her by my other friend. My other friend and I broke apart cause she 'didn't like my personality' but after  that I hung out with my skinny friend which then became my best friend. One day me and my best friend were just hanging out at lunch and my old friend was talking to them about how skinny they were and saying they'd break like a stick.. I was so glad my old friend left me at that point and I honestly hate her.  (I'm a pretty big person, btw)
Oh girl don't worry I cant dance either
YESSSSS FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS MY PAIN! AAAAAAAA
Same
can confirm
I knew all except zodiacs
She kinda looks like a girl version of colby brock.
Literally the comments I would get growing up
You just explained my whole life 😭
Bestie thats the best dancing ive ever seen /gen
I lived in a place where people had anorexia (like literally everyone and they though it was healthy) and I was a size that was considered normal for that age and I got made fun of so hard because I was bigger than everyone else. Can we just stop commenting on other people's bodies? It's their business not yours, you shouldn't talk about their bodies unless they have a condition that is really unhealthy and you're giving them tips on what to do
Nice Moves! 💃
66 is not healthy at all
My dad: 🫵🥢
All this is true, when I was like 9-10 people would always even family be like your so skinny you need to eat more meat and now that I have everyone still says I am
Welp i was bullied all through middle school for this but then in highschool my best friend was skinner than me so i had someone who related to me.
MEEEEEEEE
Omg this is so f-ing true !!! I feel this
Its true😅 ESPECIALLY THE BUTT ONE!!!
I AM REALLY SKINNY TOO (naturally) AND THIS IS THE BEST MOST RELATABLE THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFEEEEEEEEEEEE it feels rlly good to see that some people UNDERSTAND
The comments of being a toothpick are the worst for me
ITS THE DANCING FOR MEE😂
My p.e teacher from middle school was doing a weight/height check up and when he got to me he said “you could probably get away with eating a few more cheeseburgers” and I just laughed and thought about how I don’t like cheeseburgers.  Now that I’m older I’m realizing how messed up that was and I’m so glad little me didn’t even realize it
You have no right to make such a relatable video.
This is literally me
As a skinny person I can confirm sitting down hurts so much
Did that scale say 66.5 or was that just me
"I can’t dance"  Proceeds to knock my nonexistent socks off
Idk hun… those moves be killing it! ❤
‘I can’t dance’ you’re literally better at dancing than me…
My fat friend calls me a twig
I suffered from anorexia for 7 years and not enough people talk about the downsides of not having any meat on your bones. Thank you for this. ❤
100% true. And i mean 100%
this hits home lol im a teenager and i weigh a little over 65 lbs and these are all so true 😅
I think that dancing is just you.
I feel your pain I'm also very skinny and I eat well😢😅
She’s right.😂I lost a lot of weight and I’ve only ever had fat people problems. I didn’t even know there were skinny people problems, too.😂
I think then dance moves are fire 🔥🔥🔥
You're not supposed to weigh yourself with shoes on. It adds to your weight
Thank you for posting this, not a lot of people talk about these things. I can relate so much. Also sport exercises when laying on your back hurt too on my spine
omg the sitting down hurts my ass bones is so realll
Same
I’ve never been this happy to be thiccc😂
THANK YOU THANK YOUUUU THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!
As a skinny person I can relate to this
These are facts actual facts
Dude I feel this I’m so skinny like it’s not even good
This is soo trueeee! I had to make holes in my belts so they can fit on mee.
Yup I have the same reasons as well
This is to relatable
Dude this is me but I am short and skinny my sister calls me a tooth pick and my brother just upgraded to a stick
No no no why is this fucking me tho💀😭😂
I have the same problem I am so skinny but I can dance amazingly
Mate I'm just an old European
Fuckin liar, you dance great 😂
Does she weigh 66 pounds!! That’s not healthy💀
That dance was funny AF
Lol that is me my whole life
I get this 😭. I have always worn big sweaters, even in sports but the temperature started to get higher so I took my sweater off in sports... Literally a minute later a dude in my class went: "omg do you even eat." and I replied "more than you, I eat like a pig..". And more people complemented on how many weights I could carry cause they noticed my arms were half the size they were without my sweater 😂
That one ass bone like where ur spine ends 💀🔪
im skinny as fuck too
did anyone else get told as a kid that thay have chicken legs?
POV: your One grandmother tells you to eat a burger 😢
I eat so much and I can relate to all of that bc I’m skinny af
As a thin person I can relate
She explained my whole life problems in a minute : 😭
Bro I ate wayy more then my ex Gf and she was/is like twice my weight and size,
I’m the same lol, the sitting thing is so relatable
I can relate 😅
why didn't I find her channel earlier  man?! she is everythin i like in person
IKR ITS NOT OK, I EAT! I DO EAT! I EAT MORE THAN YOU HAVE EVER EATEN!
I had the opposite problem. When I was growing up I was overweight, but when I tried to lose weight, my dad forced me to eat the same amount and wouldn't let me exercise. And I would get comments from people all the time, saying stuff like: you eat too much, or why don't you exercise, or you're too fat to be my friend. And it would piss me off. But my dad said he only did that, and I quote "so that you would spend less time with friends, and more time studying.", And like, that's not a real reason. That's just my dad being an ass.
"i can't dance" usually means barely moving, not destroying any hypothetical competition going out
Dang just as much problems with being skinny as being overweight. Life just sucks doesn’t it
Nice moves Bella,lol😂
Same, I asked my mum to give me a back massage and she said she felt like she would break me in half😂😂 and I just generally can't dance 💃🕺
Well 😂
The ass one is so true😭
Literally me dancing when I'm alone 💀
At least im not alone.
skinny but very hot stay perfect love from Australia
You proceeds to call me Out
Oh please, you are way too dramatic, I am not skinny and I dance worse
I still would have rather have been as skinny as you!!😭
Okay, so I’m so skinny that I can’t leave my something not because of the bruise my ribs because my freaking Hepburn in is on the ground holding me up and it is so painful so I can’t Leon hard surfaces any more😅😢
She can dance
When I wa da kid I was horrifyingly skinny and everybody would tell me to put meat on my bones so when anyone would say that it would make me feel nauseous looking a food and those stupid comments never helped.
This is so true
The way she danced  got me laughing 😂😂😂
like i eat a lot but am still  skiny as fuck
The society issue I can relate to. Like every time I go somewhere it's: Do you have an eating disorder or some sh!t?
The wrap their hand around your wrist really hurts😭
I CAN'T DANCE  NO ONE CAN LOL WE LOOK LIKE FLOPPING FISH😂🎉
I'm skinny this is all correct
Straight fucking facts bro especially the cold one like I will sit out because my brother go swimming in an alcohol, jumping I get out freezing to death shaky it’s insane
I’m fat, it’s not fun either way😢
Relatable 😭
OMG YES... I swear everyone keeps telling me that they want to be small like me but like,  I'm that annoying size in between child and adult (clothes) and petite (can't spell) doesn't exist anymore because apparently it's offensive. So I just deal with my clothes ether being uncomfortably tight or holding my pants up. Why did they get rid of the entire petite sizes because people were sad that they weren't underweight?! I don't get it.
I said to myself it can't be that bad 😳 girl I need help
Umm that blow in the wind one hits hard   One day It was particularly windy out and I went out to the driveway to see if my father way home yet and nearly got toppled 🥲
As a skinny person, I can confirm that all skinny people can’t dance
i’m 13 and 140😭
I went from being a very chunky teen to a gym rat. After I had to take time away from the gym due a few different things, I lost some muscle and was left pretty skinny and MAN. Holy buttered ballsacks, everytime I'm wearing a hoodie in the summer and my friends are confused as to how I'm legitimately cold all the time 💀 then they get confused when they see me put away an entire meal, as if we don't eat or something-
When I went to go get a shot the doctor told me to eat a sandwich
I can't lay on my stomach bcuz my hips gets bruised. I have big enough breast to protects my ribs thankfully
You look like a trance gender
Yeah, the insults or weird comments when you're skinny are not helpful lol
Also not to mention that with those rude and horrible comments that people make a lot of people who are skinny have bodies where it’s extremely hard to gain weight and easy to lose weight, and some people just naturally have very thin bones and when you grow up like that it’s hard to suddenly change that.
I’m 60 pounds at 12
Shut up girl. There are a lot more problems when you’re fat
I love you TikToks they are hilarious lol
Two words: Tailored clothing It will not only actually fit no matter what, it's actually a nice self-esteem boost. (and it's not as horribly expensive as you'd think)
As someone that grew up underweight their entire life, I agree. My ass hurts every time I sit down, and my family keeps telling me to eat some god damn burgers when I literally out eat them
I thank the lord every day for the ass he as given me and one of the best parts of having a glorious ass is making fun of assless mfs.
And the gown was big! hahahah and everything is so truth this video
And about the dancing thing. I don't know a single skinny person that can dance. hahahah
Me: feeling good about me weight Doctor: You are so skinny. You should fit in this Ps: she was talking about a toddler's gown!
Honestly that’s what it looks like when I dance but a lot more messed up 😂
I relate to this. I have to but a cushion for whenever I sit or else my ass hurts like hell💀💀💀
I can relate to literally all of this. Don’t forget about people calling you flat.(if you’re a girl)
I AM ALSO SKINNY ASF AND ALL THAT SHIT IS TRUE
being skinny is not a problem.
Watches have the same problem as belts too
What if your fat… and still cold… maybe it’s because I live on the pacific coast. Lol
I think it's just you that can't dance lol
I am skinny and I have all of that 😭
This is so true I have high metabolism and these things happen to me
for me, being fat is kinda the opposite. Idk if this is just me but I get hot real fast, sitting doesn’t hurt, I love laying like that, also belts don’t work. either buy new clothes or lose weight
Im go through this all the time and im fluffing 13 and i look like i dont eat but i eat non stop i fricken look like im being starved but im not im always eating and my metabolism just says hey im not slowing down so might wanna eat some more like 5 seconds after i just finish eating like 2 bowls of ceral
I can’t dance either
I will be leave you when  you watch him
I can dance Proceeds to ligit get it on the dance floor
Another skinny problem is people think they can touch you without your permission. Waist, ribs, spine, wrists, people will touch and grab you. The worst is when they pick you up and you aren’t strong or heavy enough to become dead weight or fight
For the belt, just buy some shoe laces and use them. They look cool and there’s effective
You forgot about the legs being bruised really easily
When I was a wee lad I had these problems now I’m like 160 I think.
As a skinny person this is so true
Same in so skinny and no clothes fit me they don't have my size at all the I have a belt but I'll poke a new hole in it and then there's like 5 ft off eccess
man i wish
I CANT DANCE  proceeds to kill it  Edit:Best dance moves I've ever seen
I love that she's so confident to show her dance skills even though she says they're bad they're pretty good.
Same
u are the most relatable person ever. i legit have all of these problems LIKE EVEN MY TEACHER CALLED ME A STICK
I think that last one is your fault lol.
For me, being skinny it wasn’t comments from other people, it was from my family. Such as, “Yeah, honey you need to eat more.” Or, “your ribs are showing a lot.” Yeah it was when I was a kid too.
This is so relatable
As a skinny person, get over yourself
As a skinny dude, this hits home. Finally gaining weight though, just have to eat a ridiculous amount and tell myself that im building muscle.
This is so true
Yeah but being in the middle sucks too. All weights and body shapes have problems. I’m not skinny but I’m not fat so I’m stuck between and have rolls. Being a human sucks
always having to sit in the middle 😮‍💨
As a person with thick thighs and a smaller waist, all my belts have new holes that I poked in them with a hole puncher😂 and I really can’t dance
So how would I gain weight? I have fast matobolism and I hate that I can see some of the bones in my knees and my wrists are a bit meh. The things I want to focus on are my legs and arms so what can i do?
not my parents telling me to eat when i have an ed and they dont know: "you're 90 pounds!? YAYY FINALLY YOU GOT MEAT ON YOU! me crying bc im guilty of eating:"
Says they cant dance *fucken dances like a g* 🕺
I CANT DANCE EITHER
I am also skinny, and when ppl ask me to sit, i says “I prefer standing” and they always ask why….
You just explained me
yeah when i was younger my friend and i were talking with our other friends and she asked me if i starved myself. she and everybody laughed at me.  edit- i also relate to the entire video on an emotional level.
All of these things are true for me
As a fat person it’s interesting to see from a different perspective one of someone who has the opposite body type as me
Oh no 😥 I’m so afraid ur gonna break in the wind 💀💀💀
I'm pretty sure that last one is because you're white. 😄
Dude I am ALWAYS cold
ALL OF THIS IS TRUE AND I HATE IT
It’s relatable, but I can’t help but stand to live with it. Digestion feels like a chore 💀
I NEED THAT FUCKIN BLANKET WHERE DID YOU FIND A BLANKET THAT FUCKIN THICC GIVE IT TO ME NOWWWWE
Im skinny too i got so much hateful comments as a kid like"eat a burger" or that im gonna blow away💀
Honestly same 😂 but when I was like 10 or 11 I ordered a diet soda and the lady just looked at me and then was like "You know that they don't have SUGAR right???" And when I nodded she gasped so loud I thought she inhaled the restaurant and then walked away with a horrified look 😅
Would be ok if I said “let’s go to McDonalds” instead of “go eat something”?
I'm skinny and I couldn't find a prom dress my size. Something was fitting but other didn't. At the end of the day I finally found a dress that fitted me but a little tight and I was shocked that I found a dress that was for a person skinnier than me. Before I found that dress I got frustrated and my whole body was hurting from walking for too long. I wanted to go home.
I can relate because I'm skinny to
“I CANT DANCE!” *proceeds to dance better then I will ever*
I absolutely love you !!!! 🇨🇦
I’m a skinny person and this is so fucking real
Yes
You dance better than I do though, I just spin a bunch 😂
As a skinny person, THANK YOU.
my life explained in under 60 seconds
POKE THE HOLES IN THE BELT LMFAO IVE DONE THAT SINCE I WAS 7
In my school I get body shamed bc im so skinny and all I here is “omg do u eat. Ur gonna fly away. How tf are you cold it’s only 80 degrees out here.” It was so fucking annoying
Y’all r all like I. Skinny well I’m fat 😂
But bts can dance check them out
as someone whos underweight for my age this is very relatable, i have scars over my arms and legs so i feel so insecure on summer because of how much people comment about it, it does not help the fact that i get trashtalked by the popular girls from my last school, they really spread everything about me from last year to the girls from my school (im under treatment for depression and last year i was at my lowest), im also friends with the girl that gets bullied and excluded from her class, sadly, shes in 8th grade and im in 7th, i always try to help people because i always would be the therapist to my "ex", she used to trigger me a lot, talk about her problems without me asking, touching sensitive topics, and not just with me, with everyone, and she still has more friends than me, but i dont care abou those numbers cause i know shes a bad person afterall (this turned into a trauma dump)
Bro same one time a friend of mine (we’re not friends anymore she was toxic) was saying how she was on a diet and this was wen we were 13, she was making a big deal about her diet and wen I told her she didn’t need a diet cuz she doesn’t she was like well you can’t talk because you’re super skinny, girl I’m not denying it I can see my ribs, but like you can’t say that to someone
I thick af and I still can dance….I also get bruises on my ribs if I lay on my side too long it’s weird
so true, same
Well you dance better than me and I and definitely not skinny
Nah man the wind won’t break you it’ll just kidnap you
You just named everything about me.
yeah   🤣
I F*CKING HATE IT I was very skinny as a kid and this is Too True
Exactly❤
I have a skinny friend and she really can't dance
My cousin asked me a question that had an insecurity spike at age 9. "Do your parents even feed you?!" Still hurts
The same for me I’m skinny as hell for my age and uhhh since I’m small too people think I’m 4 years younger and it pusses me off 😡. Also people used to make fun of me cause I’m “light” and they keep caring me like a kid and won’t put me down. Sucks to be both…
I think not being able to dance is a tall girl problem trust me i would understand ❤
OMG I HATE THE PHRASE "You need to put some meat on those bones" LIKE HOW ABOUT I CANT AND I TAKE MEAT OFF YOUR BONES (for legal reasons this is a joke don't sue me)
Its quite funny cause someone once told me that if your skinny, your healthy, ive been underweight my entire life, im not healthy 😂, also about the jokes that the skinny person will snap in the wind or something, literally me, the wind knocked me down a few times and now my friend make the joke that they gotta protect me from the wind 😂, and im accident prone, if theres a way to injure myself, i will end up injuring myself
Your my fav YouTuber ever in the hole world
girl you aren't skinny and your posture is horrible.
Dude that must suck with the bruising like imagine being super tired you jump into bed and you wake up with bruises for jumping into bed
I have this issue except ppl didn’t say this bc when I was a kid I got bullied and wore a sweat shirt for 6yrs bc of it so ppl thought I was fat or fine but I was lighter then the average human
My sister is let's just say a stick and she does dance for a living same with me and all is the same but I have more meat I guess        Not saying your wrong btw love your vids keep up the good work❤❤❤
my first boyfriend was 4 years older than me and u was 14 i was really skinny. hesaid my legs look like they were gonna snap beneath me. my grandma woulf flip her shit if i didnt eat all thefood she made me(southergranmas are terrible abt makkint you eat a pan offucking brownies) and now i have no control with food.  i either-eat nothing or everything and ifeel so guilty afteriti just vom
Can't dance still better than me
I'm also skinny and every time I go out in 20 mile per hour wind I feel like I'm going to snap in half like a little swig
im definetly not skinny but i have all the problems except 5...
The sitting thing is so frustrating, and none of my other friends understand it.
I am tall and skinny but i have to have name brand tall jeans and the wasts are was too big and i where kids belts bc they are the only ones that fit me
Honestly I think you killed it on the dance floor. Like I would definitely go to a club with you
Lol I know the feeling. I was 135 my whole life. My metabolism finally caught up to my age 😂
Who’s in Paris
Its worse to be fat
I can't dance  MF EATS IN THE DANCE FLOOR
You dance better than me
i wish i was skinnier, im not like fat fat but like i definitely wish i was skinnier.
0:34, 0:35, 0:36, 0:37, 0:38, 0:39
DAMN HE/SHE/THEY GOT THE MOVES
So if I can't dance I'm skinny? Hell yeah I'll take that as a win
Me trying to gage how well I could pick them up the while time: 🤔  (No this is not a sexual comment, it's just a fun thing between me and the people I know that I am surprisingly strong and able to lift a lot of people 😂)
Bro I feel I my self am a fellow skinny person
We're bad at dancing cause we have nothing to shake 😢
I'm right in between, some days I'll be sally skeleton others I'm big chungus so I get both comments
I feel you I am the exact same
I feel ya I’m 103.4 pounds but I’m not fat
shake them bones lmao (jk tho)
Me who found out recently im just under the healthy weight for my height and is really low compared to my age but has prob been like that for most of my life. These statements are straight facts I still wear kids clothes and im almost an adult 😭🤣 I dont remember ever getting any comments about "do you eat?" but the amount of times where someone who's only like 10-30 lbs more than me saying they wish they had my body- like bro i would gladly trade this shit with you if i could ive basically been the same weight for almost 3 years 💀
Number 1 reason I enjoy wearing dresses 😂
all true as an underweight person i also cant sit certain ways for too long bc it hurts and can/will leave bruises
My “friend” was saying how skinny I was and that she could snap me in half. I have been throwing up because someone called me fat so idk what to do now.
Number 2 is very very true👍
Bro for #5 it's so true! Society is so mean to skinny or obese people. Me being a skinny person and being called a twig or being nicknamed bug is hurtful but they don't care.
That last one is a tall *and* skinny person problem 😂
I don’t know if that’s a skinny people problem or just the fact that you can’t dance😂
My doctors thought that my mom had postpartum disorder because I was SEVERELY underweight and considered filing a police report and my mom just replied with "do you want to see my grocery bill?"  and they ran tests a found that I have metabolism at like Sonic speed.
i can relate 😭
I know how you feel bella
As someone who is not skinny I can confirm we all come knowing how to dance and every skinny person I know is terrible at dancing
You aren't skinny.  I was sent to a live in high school where all the residents looked like they were just released from Auschwitz. Lived there for 2 years.
Yes and I vividly remember when in high school being almost knocked over by some strong winds as I was making my way to the bus . I was embarrassed.  Also I can't lay on my back for too long on those examination tables because it hurts. On the flip side as a child I could  get in places others couldn't fit .
Yes you can dance. Just takes time and dedication on practicing just like Basketball
As a slightly overweight young woman, I will never understand how people can be insecure about being skinny. Like, I would kill to be skinny, omg. I am sometimes slightly ashamed of being fleshier than most of my friends, but some of this flesh on my body is also muscle, so I guess I could flex a lil bit 💪
The 4th one made me cry-😭 And all 6 are true asheckkkk
THANK YOU
Imagine complaining about being skinny, Not me tho! I'm wider aka overweight aka fat 😔I'm working on it tho!
as a smaller person, finding seatbelt belts was a GODSEND! i never have to poke holes through my belts AGAIN 😭
I can relate
Man my height is 161cm and my weight is 60kg and i see myself fat as fuck but I have all those problems, it just made me happy:)
My Brother is 6'7 and bony as hell💀
You forgot if you lay on your back you feel like ur skin and organs are going inside of ur body
I got a text that said "eat a sandwich bro."
Everything is the opposite except I could not dance because I run out of energy to quickly I'm 5 foot 6 and 280lbs
People ask me why I'm always cold. This is why. It's funny though, I only feel cold sometimes. Like during a snow day, I was outside in a light jacket and a skirt in 40° weather, with 1 foot deep snow. Completely fine. But the moment it's 70 degrees out with a slight wind? Get me the blanket we are shivering on the couch today.
I Never had anyone say I was too skinny. Instead I had my creepy neighbor repeatedly tell me that I should be a model EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE SAW ME.
Her son looks like this :   ( )
And you’re complaining like lol
as someone very skinny and with an eating disorder, I relate to all of these especially society, my friends always made jokes about my weight and how skinny I am to the point where I forced myself to eat big meals to get a little bigger, and half of it I threw up. People don't realize how their comments can really affect a person.
I'm the exact opposite. I've hovered around 230lbs ever since I broke 6'2 at 14 years old, with an all time low of 195lbs at 6'5 when I was 31 and only eating 1100 calories per day while running 5k+. Yeah I don't get cold ever but my back and knees are absolutely wrecked from carrying all this weight around and if I even see a pastry on TV I put on more.   Maybe we could trade metabolisms for a while?
Omg I can I have been called fat but I’m not I’m 10 years old and I’m 5’6 so 130 lb is not bad I have a wide rib cage except I don’t get cold I’m like immune to it but my dad has it to so like genetics idk
And people wonder why I'm so squirmy when I sit in a chair
Don’t forget being tall enough to ride dollar costers but feeling like you could fall out at any moment
Fat people can’t dance either
Skinny people don’t have problems
I love that she actually did one on this, i'm f*ing 6'2(187.96 cm) at 137 lbs(62.14 kg) at 14 so I love smth talking about our problems
As a fat person all of these still happen to us it's not just skinny ppl
You know they have supplements for gaining weight right?
are complaining
me over here trying to be skinny but u
Can't dance? CANT DANCE? YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY KILLING IT!
Yeah that's me ^
I can't dance
I can relate to you on this, and yes, the comments hurt the worst, I was bullied all elementary years because I was skinny, even adults would bully me😂😂
I can relate to all of these
so accurate
i don't think the dance thing is a skinny issue, i think its a skill issue. and in that case, same T-T
Bro I can literally count my ribs and get way too cold
I’m skinny too since i was born and i can confirm all of that. Like i’m 15 and an average weight is 58-60kg for a girl and i’m 35kg and the worst are the comments some are joking abt it and other are just saying jow good i have. No i don’t i hate it ppl just don’t understand it
I bend over like 15° and you can see my whole spine
I agree 100% bc I’m that kid and growing up my friends parents would always say u need to eat a burger. 👇🏻my dudes who know
I'm tall, have thick thighs and a pretty slim waist so I have to buy jeans that will cover my legs and I have to poke new holes in my belt😭
For real! I get so cold in the winter. I'm in Minnesota 😭😭😭
SOO RELATABLE😊
Finally someone I can relate to!!
...that isn't normal? also low blow with the belt comment (though i have in the past had to make changes to a belt to get it to fit me)
i thought the dance thing was just me being fucking unable of any dance move
I feel you Janus, I was a super skinny guy my entire life, I graduated High School at 87lbs and I would have to say that you’re able to dance but maybe not well but you’re still dancing right? 😂
I’m skinny as fuck
all my problems have been explained now. . . 💀
Excuse me did that say 66 lbs ?! Or am I being a stupid American !!!
Me every fricking day 😂
This is litterly me
as an underweight skinny person this is so relatable and everyone makes jokes about it
I’m 12, 4’11, and 80 pounds. All of my friends are way heavier than me, (not in a bad way) and I try to eat but I just can’t gain weight for some reason.
what do you mean you cant dance that was killer
Bro my torso and arms are skinny but my legs are THIICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Pretty 🥰 girl
Thank you! This is so relieving to see
I've always been skinny too Society is the worst! Like telling someone to gain weight is just as bad as saying someone should lose weight. Like it is actually very fucking hard to gain because you can't just eat more. You gotta do it in a healthy way too! Also some people just have a harder time gaining weight like a lot of people have a hard time losing it. I can live with my pants being a little low-waist but society really makes your confidence drop when you get called a spaghetti-noodle
So what does being skinny have to do with having zero rhythm?
omg fr bro and all my other friends would always tell me "i wish i was skinny like you" im like..   😀
The sad reality of society today is that you will always be regarded as “healthy” and “beautiful” from a physical point of view when compared to someone like me who has had a never ending struggle with obesity my whole life. Now-a-days it’s fashionable to refer to to people with body types like mine as BRAVE and beautiful but deep down it’s KILLING ME EVERYDAY.  Whilst I appreciate that everyone is different, after a lifetime of having to restrict my diet, ware clothes I hate and be around people who can effortlessly go shirtless at pools and beaches, I would gladly be skinny.  Not trying to take away from you at all… I love your content
The last one is more of a white people problem than a skinny people problem.
As someone who is 62 pounds,  At first the kids at school thought I was anorexic, but then saw me eat, so they thought I was bulimic, then after they saw I wasn't throwing up, they thought I had a tape worm. Then I started wondering if I had a tape worm. Turns out I dont, and I'm just severely underweight. New school this year, though. lets see what new theories to come
That was exactly me until now and I'm almost the opposite of skinny 🥺 (also I still can't dance 🤣)
The comments, oh my god. Telling a 5 year old that theyre so skinny they look like theyre just going to float away. And other kids bullying you, not taking you seriously because youre so tiny (im also short). Doctors saying they want to give you appetite meds even though you already eat everyone else under the table three times over, and saying that it'd be fine for you to eat straight lard if it helped you gain weight. Oh my god, the things people will say to a CHILD about their weight! And people wonder why skinny people get ED's about gaining weight.
I can't dance either but that is a skill issue😅.
@Christian Griffith  great to see you again after a year!
Nah what do you mean those dance moves were CRAZY!!! 🎉🥶🥵🥵🥳🤯🤠😱😱😱
THE. MOST. RELATABLE. THING. EVER.
this is so relatable and even when i sit cris crossed on a hard floor it hurts my feet so bad. and i can’t dance too
It's true sadly I'm too skinny I'm 11 btw
All these are so damn true.  Omg sitting hurts so much a lot of the time baha
So fucking true i remember having knife's in my room because the belts didn't fit and yeah I agree the     jokes where the worst.
I'm not very skinny but I relate to all of these
Oh my god more people need to talk about this. You are literally always the weakest and smallest thing ever, and when you turn sideways you go invisible.
Omg I relate!!!!
As a skinny person I can relate
I have to poke new holes in my belt for the opposite reason 😂
Last one was a lie
As a kind of skinny person, I can confirm that I am cold all the time, clothes do not fit, and I cannot dance.
My parents used to tell me that I would never get tall enough to drive a car ✨🫶🌻☀️❤️💖
Yep. Sounds about right. I am still told stuff like that
Oh my god so freaking relatable ❤❤ the only fat I have oops on my thighs so I got the hip dip of a-thousand gods but my profile is accurate to a door
The belt was the most real part none of my clothes ever fit right 😭
why is this so true????
did that say 66 pounds?????????
All of this is very accurate and very true, I can confirm 🥲
😂😂😂the dance
Amen brother
I’m skinny but I’m always warm because I got good insolation
YES... YES. YES. YES.  I had my wisedom teeth taken out about 6 months ago and it really messed up my gag reflex. I ended up losing 20 pounds (and I was 120 pounds at the time). I physically could not eat or I would throw it all up later. I still have problems with it sometimes when I'm under high amounts of stress. But people (particularly my mother) would just say eat a cheeseburger when none of my pants fit or I was feeling weak. I'm sorry, but it is physically IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO THAT. So that phrase is a bit of a sore spot for me.
Is it like high metabolism aswell?
664 a healthy weight
Pants not fitting, very very relatable
Lucky you. Lucky fucking you.
bc i’m 5’6 (167cm) and 45 kg (99.2 pounds) i’m considered underweight, my school, my fucking school, pulled me out of class to ask me if i have an eating disorder, like at least they care but no, no i do not! THANKS, WAY TO MAKE ME INSECURE MUCH.
I CANT DANCE
That's why I always get bruises when I'm on a floor
When someone hugged me once they said "wow! I can't feel your ribs anymore!"
As a fat person I can’t relate .
i get cold in jumpers  i always tighten the velcro in jeans extra tight or tighten a belt around my clothes as much as i can i never bother to actually dance but i know tiktok dances i can show my ribs and my spind tail hurts if i sit weirdly my mum said i was very skinny at 6 and almost malnourished at 8 so i can confirm. i eat alot though i have high metabolism now
In middle school a teacher told me I needed to eat a burger
“I wish I was you. Your so skinny.” Then me proceeding to beat myself up for existing and making the people around me feel bad for themselves. I’ve learned it’s not my fault and got new friends.
I have the same Problem, but I am a competition dancer😂
Im chubby as fuck and i still get cold really easily
I get called skinny, I'm not that skinny though
😂😂😂
Wdym you can’t dance?! You are AMAZING at dancing😻
I don’t think not being able to dance has anything to do with being skinny
You just described my life in a matter of seconds
*What do you mean?* You got some pretty solid moves there. You're just missing a few key steps in your routine like the *_Bee's Knees,_* *The Running Man,* and *_The Sprinkler!_* *Work those options!* 🤘🐲🤘
All of this is so trueee I will be just existing in my own headspace and some girl will just say “omg your so skinny what’s your diet?” and I’ll respond with “a healthy dose of genetics.” I also have to specifically buy adjustable clothing just to tighten it all the way to its tightest
I'm skinny and I have those problems but I think I just can't dance
“you are going to wither away”💀
V
I have the opposite problems...being fat😊
I’m a skinny guy but I can’t agree with the cold at least for me
I think I have a problem then....1,80m and 65kg Well...
I'm a 4'11 man who until very recently struggled to keep my weight in the triple digits (in lbs). The clothes thing and society part especially hit so hard (the rest is true too but those sting lol)  I know I'll always be unwanted by society for my looks tbh
Is this that one girl every one was hating or was that someone else
Im skinny and honestly I dont have a problem with cold, laying or sitting but yeah, the one with belt is so accurate and also dacing... I am 6.4 feet tall so I cant imagine myself dancing without it looking really weird.
Yeah you're skinny, but you're cute as hell and there's no fat on that
Fr,when I was younger I used to think that my butt bones were…well uhm maybe u can guess
The worst is when your tall and skinny. Need long pants but always too baggy and waist too big😅
As a underweight and EXTREMELY skinny person, I get cold way to easily. And I can’t dance (lol). All of these problems apply.
as someone who used to be super skinny, i remember having to put an elastic band on my leggings in middle and elementary school to get them to stay up, it wasn’t a great look lol
Yep
I have had problems like this but I used to thing I was fat but my hip bones were literally sticking out and so was my rib cage but it was only brought to my attention when I was ranting about being fat to my boyfriend and he just said “sir,you are the skinniest person I know” but now I am just starting to realize that I need to eat more than one orange a day to not starve to death
Only thing worse than the “do you even eat” is the “man ur so lucky I wish I was as thin as you”
As a THICCCC person I can agree that I go through these same exact problems but in reverse lmao, other than the first two, those I still go through also lmao.
But then if you have the slightest bit of fat people call you overweight obese and disgusting you can never win
And I'm 12 and my relatives compared to my cousins bcs their body is looking like nd hour glass
Girl same
I’m so skinny and people want to be me and I’m like NOOOOOO YOU DONT GWORL
Ppl tell me ima get confused with the skeletons on halloween 💀
I 100% relate😊
The thing is IVE TRIED GETTING MEAT ON MY BONES I JUST CANT. I eat like a god damn pig and am still skinny af
This is too relatable
I’m skinny and relate
🥺 someone finally mentions the belt part. I’ve never done it before but I always find myself seriously considering it.  AND THE ASS BONES!!!! I just thought it was because my butt wasn’t fat enough…U STATING FACTS ONG
my father would always tell me not to open my jacket when its windy so I dont fly away 💀💀💀
Bro I had a friend fr say, "I can't believe you eat that much" like wtf I already hate how I look thanks a lot
You dance better than me
I wanna be skinny :(
Most people can't "dance". Dancing though, anybody can do.
I use to be anorexic now im overweight I hate it so much😭
Finally a video I can relate to regarding my skinny body 😭 this is like therapy lol
They cant dance? thats just a skill issue
As a really skinny person myself I can 100% agree with all of this.
*positive jab to you* You look good and have the best personality any good vibing person should have.
I've been talked down to very much as a skinny person
Well I was even more skinny now I finally did get some meat and Gainz on my bones😎
Someone finally understands it tho, like I can’t sleep on couches bc it bruises my ribs…
We’ll go swimming or the fucking gym for fucks sake , stop complaining and get on with it Jesus Christ
Ass bones? Those are your glutes Jay. Jay needs some cushions. That would help her.🙂
Jayus can drink all the milkshakes she wants. Think of that.🍨🍨🍨🍨🍨🍨🍨🍨🍨🍨
It's envy. Humans are supposed to be lean. Not bloated, cholesterol creatures.
Girl as one of the skinny girls who never remembers to eat I can confirm this is true except dancing for some reason everybody keeps telling me I'm really good at dancing I don't know why😅
Hate to be the one to say this: not being able to dance is a mutual problem between skinny and non-skinny
As a very skinny tall guy, another annoying thing : being lighter than your gf / the girl you date most of the time. Some girls can feel bad about that even if their weight is completely normal.
I'm more skinnier than you, but I can agree with all of them except for dancing
U just a cool person funny cute
Don't worry, you'll fatten up as you get older.  You're right you do look like a dancing giraffe.
Yeah once someone told me that they were scared that I would break like a porcelain doll if I tripped because I was "so delicate"
"Omg, are your pants falling down?"   Me, looking at the pants I have on with are tied up with a hair tie   Yes, yes they are.
1. True 2. Crossing arms over the chest, but also, how often does one really have tummy time like that? 3. True, but having good circulation to your extremities at least partially counterarcts this, which DOES get harder the taller you are. 4. I stick to woven belts. The elastic ones are actually pretty comfortable. 5. Always felt like a 0th-world problem to me. It's something I half-mock & say to other people as a joke, but also, I can out-eat other people, just without the weight gain. 6. Embrace your inner spaghetti noodle 🍝
Im skinny and my fammily said that i look like a skeleton
Don't poke holes through your belt, just get one that's weaved. That's what I did.
Relatable 😅😅
the dream
Girl u do realize that being like 6’1” also makes it’s harder to dance right 👀
"I CANT DANCE IF I'M TOO SKINNY" someone please tell that to those toxic k-pop companies
Yo I'm 5'3 and 88lbs . I understand this perfectly, and don't even mention how people grab your wrist and talk about how they could break you. They think it's funny, but it makes you feel pathetic and vulnerable. Being too skinny is hard, but being short and skinny? It feels hopeless; I despise my body and genetics...
I relate to almost all of this-
I get this, growing up I was too thin. Like my metabolism was overactive. A doctor litteraly told me and my mom that I am to eat cake and ice cream daily. I litteraly ate a chicken pot pie, every single morning and ice cream every night and was 43# when graduating middleschool. This IA not exadurated my neighbor could touch both her thumbs and fingers around me when I sucked in my gut... it was creepy
Felt 😂 😭
Ha that’s me but I ask my mum for a small chocolate bar and Pringle and she says I’ll get fat
As someone who isn’t skinny but isn’t overweight, I’m pretty sure it hurts almost anyone to lay on their stomach for too long. Maybe not in the same way but laying that way is definitely not my first choice it’s super uncomfortable
I can relate. Extremely.
as a skinny person, these are all accurate as fuck.
I know 😢
I got way to excited when I found pants that fit me, I’m 17 and can still fit in kids clothes🥲
I’m fat and i STILL can’t dance
The stuff that people say to skinny kids is so wrong. Most of it is just creepy or is messed to say to a child but also to anybody
I had this issue, people told me to eat more and exersise less. I didnt listen, and am now a healthy semi-muscular dude.
This was way too relatable😂😂😂   One time when I was 12 a girl called me a stick, I was too afraid to say anything at the time, but it really bothered me.
Omg i NEED to see more dancing. I loved every second of it
Na i feel you I'm skinny too and I'm absolutely horrible at dancing so i guess that makes two of us
As someone who used to be incredibly skinny, (I’ve gained some weight) all of this is absolutely correct 😭 I had to start eating A LOT so I could gain weight and feel less body dysphoric, and now I’m even more body dysphoric and feel like I’m fat.
I'm fat af and sitting down still hurts my ass bones
the can't dance is a lie, I'm a skinny ass bitch andddd I did hip-hop XD
Honestly same
My mom and grandma literally had to sew most of my pants and shorts so they could fit when I was young lol.
Boo I can’t dance and I’m a fairly curvy woman
Yep, this is accurate 😢
Yes as a chronically unweight person havent gained a pound in five year i have all of theese problems. Im am adult male and have younger female friends who are heaivrr then i. Its a real problem
As a skinny person, everything is starting to finally make sense...
"Can't dance" I'm pretty sure that's a you problem
This song keeps coming onto my shorts feed after I danced to it! Raahhhhhh I cant escape it!
i wish i was skinny
I am skinny to, but... I'm very very good at dancing. So your probably just not good at dancing
a. Idk how much i weigh but i look kinda skinny
I don’t think people understand the clothes not fitting ITS SO ANNOYING
Yeahhhh... My friend thinks the reason I get cold is bc I sit with my legs crossed. (Which doesn't make sense btw)  But I'm just skinny!  Also sitting on hard flat surfaces for a prolonged time really stresses me out bc I have no ass to act as a cushion, and therefore it hurts and/ or itches. I tried to explain to them, but they practically ignored me.  I remember being told by a classmate back in ~6th grade, that it was "disturbing" to watch me stretch, because my ribs would show.  Of course I, being the nuisance that I was, made a point out of stretching extra when she was around. 😅
For the belt one I use suspenders and just put them under my clothes
no u just need skill in dance but that was FIRE
"Go eat a burger or something" cant tell you how many times I've been told that exact phrase And my dad loved to keep the house around 68- 69 degrees (roughly 20  celcius) when I was a kid 🙃
Relatable
My adhd meds made me be as light as possible it was not good I was loosing to much weight then I had adhd med that made my weight worse made me heavier and now it’s fixed I’m staying a good weight
You look beautiful just the way you are
Lucky I’m fat and would rather have your problem than my pant being to small
I can relate to all of them
As a skinny person, I’ve developed a syndrome called Raynaunds which basically means anytime I get cold my extremities turn different colors….. and I live in Oregon
and i have the opposite problem 😭
Same except the society one because I rarely post my face on the internet
I swear this is the thing I'm most insecure about. Even today i had to go to the doctor for just a vaccination and she said that i don't eat at all. I tell her i do and she says it doesn't look like it. She's really nice but whyy
I can understand how you feel, I was skinny till 7th grade
Literally my biology teacher walked up to each student and either said healthy, obese or anorexic and she called me super anorexic
Random situations I remember from always being a twig  One time in track we were doing a running exercise where we had a parachute on out back and had to run 100 meters with it on to gain strength, it was windy and the coach told me to be careful so I don’t fly away as a joke, and I’m not kidding you almost got lifted off the ground…  Another thing that happens often is that when I tell someone like a friend that I am, for example 10 pounds under weight they tell me to go eat 20 pounds of food and I just stare at them like 👁👄👁 that’s not how it works…  The lunch ladies started giving me things like more green beans is more corn at lunch, but after a little while they noticed I didn’t eat it all so they gave me less food then everyone else…  Remember, it doesn’t matter how much you weigh
im more slim thick and i relate to this so much. not the society one though.
60 second definition of my life!🤟
I would kill to look like that ngl
yeah i eat a good 12k calories every day and i haven't gained any weight in a while, i know your struggle
also, if you eat a large meal, you get bloated 👍
Whenever I sit on someones lap they tell me to get off because my tailbone hurts their legs
I’m 330 pounds but I have no ass so sitting down for long periods of time hurts my ass because there’s barely any cheeks
Bro... My teacher still is worried that I don't eat anything 💀
BRO FRR!!! I WOULD EAT LIKE 10 BURGERS AND STILL BE SKINNY , also that explains why I'm always cold EVEN DURING THE SUMMER
I DIDNT KNOW PEOPLE’S BUTT BONES DIDNT HURT WHEN THEN SAT DOWN WHATTTT ITS JUST A SKINNY PEOPLE THING?????
Bro ever since 1st grade I turned skinny 💀
No, those were the best dance moves I’ve seen in my life. All the comments are people confirming, I can semi confirm. My friends at school think I’m skinny, my parents and doctor think I’m over weight. Because I’m a 12 year old girl who is 4’7 and 90lbs.
You better be careful around storm drain grates
I knew I shouldn't look in the comments
I'm 35kg at 10yrs Thats normal right?
I THOUGHT EVERY HUMAN DID THIS IM JUST BUILT DIFFERENT I GUESS
Yeah I used to have problems with the chest bruising and that got me in the gym
You can be over weight or you can be under weight but you just can't be weight
Fat people can’t dance either
DANG 66 IS HEALTHY(ish) AND UR 6’3??? Im 5’9 208 Lb 💀
I'm thicker than a snicker but I can't dance
Never been happier to weigh 120 pounds ty for making me feel better about myself
This is why I use a ratcheting belt. Works every damn time.
Dont say my insecurities out loud!
This kid in my class that was just as skinny as me was like: 😢ouyh go get a belt   Me not having one that fits:👁️💋👁️💙
The dance😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭💃💃💃💃🕺🕺🕺
Yessss
Thank you! Not many people mention the comments one, so I’m just here to say, that as a person who isn’t even a hundred pounds, got my period at a late age because of low weight, and hates my body, I used to play softball, and this son of a bitch kid got into an surgirent with me because she thought I stole her softball or something, as I went to leave, she whispered to her friend behind me: “she needs to eat a burger god” I snapped around and told her to shut up and yada yada. I hated sports because it’s very hard for me to run without almost coughing my lungs out every time or panting like a ducking dog. I was always teased because I was going to get blown away by the wind, or that someone couldn’t crush me by sitting on me ect. I’m also very flat, which I don’t mind as I plan to wear a binder once old enough to leave my moms household because heaven forbid her daughter want to wear a binder, but my friend literally looked down at my chest and down at hers and said: geez, you’re really flat lol. Like mf shut up! Anyways sorry for venting have a great day and remember, you’re perfect just the way you are❤️❤️❤️
I guess maybe I shouldn’t be obsessed with wanting to be skinny that much anymore- 💀
Can NOT tell you how much I relate. Here’s some positive reinforcement “YOU are not alone”
I feel all the struggles.
Can't dance? What do u meeaaan??? Disco royalty!
Number 5 is way too relatable sadly
i relate to all of these 😂, that is so true. It is impossible to bulk up when my metabolism eats away all the protein.
As a fat person this is not relatable   Edit: except for the dancing part
bro just confirmed the opposite of my life in 50 seconds (im fat)
I’m 14 4’11 and 82 pounds- this has got to be the most relatable post ever
YEA!
wtf bro "can't dance"?? LOOK AT YOUUUUUU literally s l a y
OMG SAME 😅
I was 89 pounds through high school sopping wet at 5’4”. I had a bruised tailbone for years and by the time I hit my twenties I was 116. I could not gain past that. I was always cold or in pain.   Glad you are getting to where you want to be!❤ I know all of this way too well!
My sisters been very underweight for most of her life, while I’m the opposite. I gain weight super easily and my genes make it harder to loose weight. For my sister it’s harder to gain weight.
literally true lmao
Do some barbell squats, lunges a d deadlifts
girl i thought you said you cant dance you fuckin slayed
The Dance moves 👏👌🏻
LMAO IM FAT ASF AND I STILL CANT DANCE
and when i try to ecercise and do sit-ups I have to akwardly turn to the side every time I lay down because my back hurts and there is already bruises I don't need more
Yea I’ve been skinny a lot in the past 5 years due to working out and eating problems and then I just skinnified so I just layer clothing, but the laying down one has no solution it just hurts, and i wear binders bc like, I’m trans, and boy my rib cages really hate me. The clothing not fitting is a constant problem so I just tuck in my layered clothing and those belts that has been blowing up, 6hat has two holes and has it all around it
I am the skinnier person in my year
I like your dancing
Those moves are so fricking slay don't know what you talking about
isn't that dancing tho?
doing exercises on the floor during PE [*]
I'm skinny and I can't dance either
I have the exact same problems with being so skinny, and it's super annoying when EVERYONE keeps saying things like that
Omg I used to have that same problem with adhd my metabolism was real high and I couldn't gain any weight so I was always really skinny and had all of the same problems you had and tbh one day it just stopped and I gained 58 pounds in 1 month and now I'm in a healthy weight zone if anyone knows how that happend all the sudden let me know please
So my name is myrah and I'm 11 people including my friends be saying oh ur a stick I'm scared y might break. But I have been skinny my hole life bad even if I tried I can't gain weight it's just not possible.
I got called fat constantly by my peers until I got a eating disorder and stop eating entirely and some days I still starve myself
Bruh, I’m about 2kg over the average weight for people my age and I still cant sit on hard chairs because it hurts my ass. I actually have something there when I stand up, but when I sit down all the ass disappears. Like where did it go? Why are my bones so sharp?
bro i weighted like u at 14 y/o
I love how society is like “you’re too skinny, eat a burger” “eww your fat, stop eating so much” there is no middle ground and it sucks.
You just didn't have a sense of humor or good comebacks as a kid. I would've thrown it right back at them no problem. My dad told me when I was 12 he was standing around his buddies and I went up to him and told him he's letting himself go. He said that was a good burn for a kid. I don't even remember doing it. Lol
Same girl my weight is so unhealthy
I relate to all of this.. even the dance part 😩
I relate to all of these
I don’t know what to say  You literally just explained most of my life and some conversations I’ve had with people
Once I was sick and a person I went to school with said: this is what happens when you don’t eat. Bro I eat
And also the science for getting medical help with your weight when you’re underweight as they are but there’s no clinics there’s no doctors there’s nothing.   And when you say to offend person that they need to eat more, that’s like really insensitive and that’s just like saying to that person that they need to eat less, but it hurts even more because it’s not that simple.
I don't think dancing has anything to do with being skinny I would know I'm 6'1 135 pounds
You sure you’re not targeting me ? I have bruises on my butt and ribs daily.
As a skinny person, I can relate to this, however the chest one isn’t true for me because my boobs are big compared to the rest of me T.T and I move around because sitting in my butt isn’t comfortable after a while, like even squatting is more comfortable
You can’t dance bc you’re tall and skinny not JUST skininess
Goddamn this is so true I always hated the wrist hand thig also I have bruises on my ribs to
I think an effective way to flirt with a skinny person would to hold their hand on a windy day, if they asked you what you were doing, say, “I don’t want you to fly away.”
don’t forget that people who randomly say “I could break you in half like a stick😃”  like bro wtf😭
I literally ate a whole box of GS cookies and had a teacher say “That’s a lot of fat, you may not need that.” Looked up at her and wrapped my fingers around my wrist. “Trust me, I do.”
Number 6 is just sad yo
Bro and then people also say   Don't complain I wish I was that skinny. You're just lucky  BISH NO 😂😂😂
Thank you so much for this video "That shit is fucked up to say to a kid"  is true
Ma'am you dance better then me😅
OML I FELT THIS IN MY GOD DAMN SOULLLL
Bro literally speaking facts, I’m a skinny person and I don’t weigh much, it makes me super anxious. I recently got into the habit of trying to eat beyond my comforts making me feel a lil sick after food, because I don’t wanna be called underweight.
Being skinny, I can agree with all of these statements (including the dancing one, but Jayus is better at dancing that I am)
Not me realizing I’m skinnier than I thought
Not to mention people saying "I wish I had your problem instead of mine" 🙄
I didn’t know you play basketball I do too
Other side's not easy either, it's hard to get up at 280lbs
I'm a skinny person and this is so relatable, thank you
As an underweight person I understand when I was young people tugged on my hair so I wouldn’t “fly” away
Idk I think ur dance moves are fire
I don't think the cold thing based on weight... That's genetics, lol. Even when I was skinny, I was always warm, even at -40... I was 40kg (90lbs) when I hit 177cm (5 foot 10), by grade 4, lol. I spent a decade at 183cm (6 foot) and 68kg (150lbs).  The rest was bang on, though, lol.  As a retired skinny person, though, fair warning, you do not gain padding on the booty bones. 118kg (261lbs) and I still have no padding, lol.
Yea same
The belt one is sooo me 😂
omg i agree im naturally skinny i totally relate
Preach!! Say it louder for the people in the back! You've summed up my whole life and still get skinny slammed. Just like you I am getting to a normal weight now almost there but it was so annoying people saying the wind will take you away or I'm scared to grab you cause I'm afraid to break you. Ugh all those comments and things are true. People say I wish I was you but I'm like no you don't but equally no matter what size or height you are someone will say something about you. Stay awesome
Dude my mom's coworkers would always ask her if she was feeding me enough because I was and still am pretty small. I didn't get it then but now I look back and see how absolutely messed up that was
You absolutely killed those dance moves
I have a friend who would get sick very easily since she was very skinny. Fortunately, she's doing much better now :)
Yeah uh, same 😅 Edit: especially the sitting one and the laying down one
Thank you. This needed to be said.
Im skinny too yeah
Don't worry I was a string bean joined the Army at 123 pounds got out  4 years later at 135... all muscle oh I'm 5'7"  but don't worry I'm 45 and weight 225 I'm in shape still... round is a shape!!!
me:
I’m tall and slender. 6’4 and I weight about 160. I literally don’t wear long pants because it’s too difficult to find the right size(32w36L) and yes sleeping in a comfortable position is like finding a unicorn because it’s like impossible to recreate it another time 😢
ja butt like every one i talk to knows that i probably eat like a sumo wrestler so😅
And at least for me I even try to gain weight and it just don’t work like I can’t for some reason
The dance part  Speak for yourself
I was skinny my whole life, got bullied in locker room, same usual comments like “eat more, get meat on your bones”, called stick insect etc. some people commented to my parents that I looked anorexic and asked if I was eating... I could only gain weight if I ate like every hour and literally stuffed myself until I felt sick. I’m over 6ft and it’s more common amongst tall people.  But then about a year ago I started putting on healthy weight without changing my diet. If anything I’m eating less than I did as a teenager yet I look much more healthy and filled out. I’m 25 now so most likely my metabolism just started to slow down.
Thick body 😎:)))))
Bruh you look like my friend Hadley
Sameee but for some reason I can eat like an entire buffet and not gain weight. I got it from my dad tho
The belt thing and the insulation are way too true 🫠
I grew up wearing leggings that never fit in the waist so my mom would use safety pins to make the waistband smaller
ALLL THESE THINGS ARE SO TRUE I SWEAR😢
Omg thank you for talking about thissss
Bro, just do the Macarena to any 4/4 song
mood
My grandma: “you need to eat more” My mom: “okay put the belt on and put your finger where the hole has to go” My dad’s two bite policy: “im hiding under the disguise of making you a normal size, but i’m actually gonna make you hate every type of food and hate your dad as well” Me, finally getting up to normal size for kids my age: “from the side i’m too fat from the front i’m too skinny” So yeah life as a skinny person is hell for clothing, food, and self esteem.
Can’t dance? Must be “Caucasian” jk
Try being a muscle bound freak so heavy that you can break a scaffolding. I also hulk my clothes and rip them to pieces. My wife complains when she sees I've ripped my boxers yet again
Exact same problem waying 80 pounds at 18😅😅😅
Bro I'm not even skinny and I can't dance 💀
Can you do tall people problems
i'm not skinny but i can confirm this is true because im fat and have all the opposite problems (apart from the dancing, i can't dance worth a dime).  but fr its always SO HOT EVERYWHERE
Nah you can dance
Soo true
I mean this as a joke  My best friend is skinny asf and you can see her bones through her skin and she is so good at dancing..
You should also talk about how every moment of pain is multiplied by 5 when you are skinny. I swear, I can touch some random thing and it will feel like I bashed my finger into it.
Don't blame "lame" dance moves on being skinny.. 👠
OMDS I hate being skinny- people always call me anorexic and my wrists are waaaay too skinny so I have to poke new holes into my watches and it's so annoyingggg and people call me a bag of bones and tell me I'm being a baby when I'm feeling really cold-
Me and my tailbone fr have a vendetta against each other
I can relate to all of these
Something I hate about being skinny is when it was sports day my friends said to me why don't you do the race you're fit, I'm not fit I'm just skinny I'm not good at running
I thought her dancing was good 🤣
Being tweegg thin growing up, I had a friend who was very touch oriented. She liked to hold my hand a cross our arms together and I ever minded, but a almost every time we crossed our arms she would say “your arm is so thin, I’m afraid it might like break or something!” I love her, but it’s probably not something you should say to a friend or anyone, you don’t know what could be hurtful to them
I sleep with a blanket in the summer
I can’t even lay down on the floor because my bones start to hurt 🥲
Funny. I can’t dance either. And I’m skinny too.
I’m gonna add lifting your arms up while you’re in a bikini/are shirtless. I don’t know if it’s normal to be able to see ribs through your skin the moment you lift your arms, but it makes me self conscious and I don’t want others seeing it.
i died laughing watching this bc i relate too much, i’m 14 and still in size medium kids 💀
There's never a healthy weight I swear to God even if your a healthy weight you're gonna be put down it's either your too skinny go eat or your too fat stop being so lazy and go to the gym or stop faking those workouts aren't gonna work just stop eating
I was skinny too, then I hit the gym
I feel seen.
Yes, so True.  More people Should talk about skinny people problems
ALL,OF THIS
I'm very underweight and ive been my whole life, my father parents and some of his sisters are on the bigger side though, and they're always saying things like "oh you never eat" or "you're so skinny and lucky" and its reallt annoying bc they domt realize i have an ed and im literally 82 lbs, its not all fun and games. Maybe its not so fun to be big, but its also not as fun to be skinny
You just explained my life in less than a minute💀
Covid made me fat lol  But I used to be skinny. I couldn't even play with friends in the water as a kid cause I got cold so quickly. Some guy said I looked disgusting 😢  My least favorite thing, I think it's a skinny person thing but it could be just me. But I couldn't do certain excersises or do a somersault cause it hurt my tail bone
I’m a skinny person but also it’s weird bc when you mentioned the cold thing, for my it’s the complete opposite. I grew up in a pretty normal environment where sometimes it’s warm, other times it’s cool. But I overheat way too easily and have never been that affected by cooler temps.
Fat people problems:      Parents tell you to slow down the snacks      People try and make it seem like your not fat      You need new size clothes every year      You feel paranoid      And you go emo
Bikini picture doesn't look skinny
837k, 32k.
Some people used to see me with my dad and say to us that he eats my food and leave me hungry 💀
I still have the same belt since I was 8 ... I'm 20 now 💀
DONT worry I can’t dance either
This is so damn relatable. Clothes just don’t fit for me and I can’t wear clothes that were made to emphasize the curves. I always feel cold and look really weird dancing. The comments people make about my body also doesn’t help. Why is it that people think it’s not okay to fat shaming but can make comments like “you look like a skeleton”, “don’t you eat at all” to skinny people?? This is also body shaming. So yeah, being skinny is not that nice.
That last one was a you problem
Great dance moves
if you can't dance, play just dance my sister used to suck at dancing so she would play and just dance every day and now she is a professional dancer.
This is so relatable
You looked , perfectly fine imo opinion growing up just on the slender lankier side, to me when your  bony thin w/ ribs showing thru and almost no arm or leg meat that's too skinny I think  my personal opinion though,  but hey glad your @ a healthier weight in general and that your happy with.❤
even worse when everyone compliments you when the only thing you think about 24/7 is how much you hate ur body, like thanks but wut-
I used to be extremely skinny to the point my ROTC master sergeant had to tell a kid not to dock me for the uniform shirt not being tucked in properly that (these are his words) "She's just that skinny."
I feel like u can just never win (especially as an AFAB person though). I’m not skinny at all, and I do kinda roll my eyes when I see these videos because I catch myself thinking “omg skinny people have it so easy in society.” But this is totally valid. no matter if you’re skinny or chubby, people will tell you to be the opposite :( it’s quite sad
Saaame!
So relatable! My pants or belt never fit
I feel everything except the dance part I can dance, but my definition of dance is twirl twirl twirl twirl I mean when you skinny I feel like you’re more flexible is that only me but I feel you
I couldn't process anything but that dance😂 your slaying
Hell yeah she can 🗿 Tf you dance better than the whole comment section
As a fat person I don't relate except for the fact I can't dance 😂
FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT!!
i seriously relate to this
Yes. The lack of representation we have is disheartening. 🥺
…i think i’m skinny.
5th point is 100% true 😂
The most f*cked up thing about this video is that those photos in the beginning looked normal to me because that's what the internet has always shown me is normal. But you look good now, at a healthy weight.
I can't unsee that
As a skinny person I can say all these things are very true
THIS IS HOW I FEEL ALL THE TIME, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO
My life in under a minute:
Literally the story of my life 😭
I'm not any better at dancing
I can eat a whole damn cake and still be able to feel the underside of my rib cage
My pants are either falling off me or they barely reach my knees
not sure this has anything to do with your dance moves bro
Ok the last one is a modern white person thing
The dance tho 😂
I'm in the same boat, it sucks🥲🥺   What I edited was "boat", I had two b's-
you know what... what did you eat as a kid couse I noticed hot skinny you were and yeah... also we wanna see more child jays/Bella.
Wait being skinny is why I can't dance
Dont forge you cant stand for to long or your heels will hurt like hell
I have this irrational fear that if I press too hard on my collar bone it's gonna break. I think it's somewhat because it sticks out and everyone's always told me I'm so thin that I'll snap like a twig.
Skinny as F, but also tremendously beautiful. Healthy is the new skinny. Take up health as a hobby. You can't fail at a hobby. Eat well. Sleep well. Exercise. Meditate or pray. Have a hobby. Make friends. Find meaning and purpose. ☮️🕊️☯️🙏4 Ukraine.
The fact that when i get too cold i just fall asleep... my body just shuts down for me to warm up.
Fr! 😂😂😂
To number 5 haters, have you ever heard of fast metabolism? We suffer from it. As a 5'2" 23 yo with 105 pounds on me, i feel you skinny people. It's also low stomach capacity so I can't eat much without hurling it back up.
"I CANT DANCE!" *Shows dancing* Me: Nah bro you're just a bad dancer.
I feel this in my soul 😂😂
WAIT DO NON-SKINNY PEOPLE NOT HAVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS???
Dancing was perfect 😂
i CAN RELATE WITH THAT DANCE PART I SWEAR! 💀
FINALLY SOMEONE I CAN RELATE TO! My ribs are sometimes bruised man but I find laying down that way is comfyyyyyyyyyyyy but damn it hurts.
7. No energy
I have a pretty normal sized body (can I call it that?) and even kids belts don't fit me 😭
Honestly your dance moves are better than what I can do 💀
Yeah❤
As a plus size person, I hate how people will criticize people for no reason. I used to be incredibly underweight and it was just as bad for me as being overweight. It also tends to be overshadowed by other people which sucks.
Oml yes!! As a skinny tall person my pants don’t fit in two ways. One I have enough room to put an entire second human in the waist band. And two the pants never fit right length wise especially leggings because I’m tall so they always end up cutting off at the shins instead of the ankles.
That’s so true when I get bruises I poke them and then say ow
Honestly they can dance better than me 😅   But then again I’m overweight so that may be why I can’t dance 😅
Who said you cant dance? Thats better than me, i look like an octupus cross a fortnite dance
You can dance better than me
90 IBS here originally 60 since I was little and I can confirm I also have to make new holes in my shoe straps because I have hobbit feet they're big and flat and um my friends have had to jump on me to stop me from getting picked up by the wind from a rain storm just this year soooooooo yaaaaaa.......and yes all of my friends are super proud of me for putting on 30 pounds (I was born 15 inches long a normal baby is somewhere between 20-25 inches I was 3 IBS 1 ounce yes I was tiny no I was not a premi my mother just didn't have enough of the liquid that makes you grow so I was a C-section and because I was so small I was easily forgotten when it came to flipping me so the nurses allowed my head to become flat and square shaped  but I was told that in all the years that any of those nurses worked they had never seen a baby as small as me with the lung capacity that I had I screamed for a full 2 hours till my father gave me his pinky I had to hold it with both hands and they still didn't wrap around his finger)
Being cold is the worst of it all
WELP, TO BAD, IM 11 AND GET TOLD ALL DAHM DAY THAT I NEED TO EAT MORE EVEN THO I HAVE MUTIPLE ANXIETY DISORDERS. :)
Yep, as a skinny person I feel kind of self conscious sometimes.
Bro I saw a comment saying that Bella’s cringe
Shape is more important than size. You look pretty much fine.
Bro your dance moves are GRATE 😂😂💃💃💃
You can dance just in a skinny way
I swear when i was like 10 i went ziplining with my mom, and when i was landing the harned pulled my shirt up halfway (u could only see my stomach and stuff no big deal) and my feet werent touching the ground yet so i was stretched and u could see my rib cage. And some old man was like "you need to eat more meat and potatoes" it was mad annoying
I've always been very skinny but I eat quite a bit more then my friends, they just stare at me wondering where it goes
As a fellow skinny motherfucker, I can relate to these, especially the dancing one and sitting down
Idk, you dance better than me
Coming from a drumstick 🍗 with no meat on it 🦴 this is very relatable!
Can’t dance!? Bro you can even dance better then me on the luckiest day of my life 😂
As an underweight person, all of these problems are accurate. I get skinny shamed a bit TO often.
Nah but ma fat ass can’t dance ether 😂
True…
I mean you got some moves
as a skinny person, relatable
And to think that almost everyone is addicted to being skinny-  Our society is f**ked up💀✨ Judgement always happens (No hate)
BRO I CAN RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH MAN LIKE EVERYTHING SINGLE THING SHE SAID IS SOOOOO TRUE
Lol this is so me.  My parents comment on it all the time.  The belt thing was definitely something I dealt with and though people have told me I'm pretty good at dancing, I know they're just trying to make me feel better lol.  And yes sitting too long would give me something I call butt rott xD
Pls stay somewhat skinny we are losing my people I don't want to become fat bc that what every other country sees American people as
My friend is a skinny person and this is very helpful so I can support her better and know what she goes through. THANK YOU!!!
So true,I (a skinny kid) can approve that these are real
“I CANT DANCE” Proceeds to dance 1000% times better than me and everyone else watching
Yup skinny person here, can confirm!
the dance's were fire.
That’s so true tho lmao
This is why I don't like being skinny and people think it's nice
People used to call me a holocaust survivor
I thought I was the only one😂😂😂😂😂
YESSSSSS I have to poke new holes in belts too 😂
This is relatable thx for saying it
BRUUUUUUUUUUUH im the exact same hate when people skinny shame but think its bad to fat shame!!
I'm bigger and have never been skinny in my life so this makes me feel better ngl, I like being able to sit without my ass hurting and lay in bed naked with no blanket and not be freezing
I have the same problems
For me, its really hard for people to say Go eat a Burger or anything with Meat because my dad is vegitarian. Same with mostly everyone on my dads side, meanwhile poeple on my moms side are not. I dont eat things Like turkey and Pork. And even if I have it is very rare. Chicken is really the only meat I eat, and even when I do I eat very little of it.
Hehe yea I’m skinny and super tall 😀
And when you finally get "meat on your bones" you got that one bitch telling you to slim down  I may be unhealthy, but I'm at a very healthy weight MOM 🙄🙄
It'll be 70 degrees out, and I'll be cold 😭😭
As a skinny person this is true. I am very cold and someone told me that they thought they were touched by death because I poked them T^T
lying down like that while having a binder (THAT DOES NOTHING AT ALL) is worse 😢 and I'm really skinny too
Fr
What of course you can dance that was incredible
A-C-C-U-R-A-T-E
What are you talking about? YOU ABSOLUTELY KILLED THE DANCE MOVES. 😎
Are u sure u can't dance like gawd damn ur better than me
how am I supposed to know how to dance I was not born with that skill
My mom held onto me at the grand canyon because she was scared I was going to fly away
The sitting thing is for everyone
Im a very skinny kid who eats a lot but my elementary school used to try to send food home with me thinking we didn't have enough food, like thank you but there's other kids who need it
why get a belt and need to make new holes when you can get a belt with wholes all around  *think people, think* (and yes, i do have a belt like that, my sister got it for me and its a blessing)
That last dance move😂perfection👌
As a very skinny person it's Relatable
As someone who is very skinny, I can affirm that sitting in one place for too long on something that is not padded does in fact hurt luckily the whole we get cold easily is counter by the fact that I've always been very resistant to the cold
Shoelaces make a good belt
You dance better than me-👀
Love that 👙 pic 🤤🤤🤤
Yes
Then there’s us who aren’t skinny but also aren’t fat 💀
Not to mention when your belt fits, but your pants are just too big around so now the belts rubbing against your skin and barely holding up your pants.
So…two things First, as a person that suffered from being horribly skinny. That is some messed up stuff to say to a kid. I literally was so skinny that I looked like I had some like life threatening disease and had to drink those like chocolate milk things that only REALLY skinny people know about. Literally had a buzz cut at one point and everybody I wasn’t related to kept asking if I had cancer (I was between 5 and 6 years old by the way). I was messed up bro, I thought something was wrong with me because I wasn’t ever really that hungry. Second to look good dancing you just flail around and it just works for some reason.
And then when someone comments ur heavier than u look right after you get to a healthy weight...
FINALLY! Not to mention it hurts af to lay anywhere.  Funny enough my dad just told me right before I watched this   “omg you need to eat ur rlly skinny”   my friend then said “she’s always been this skinny” “  “well yeah but not THAT skinny you need some protein”    As if protein is gonna help you know how much I eat???
Omg this is so relatable 😂
At least you don't look like a potato lmao
As someone with a super fast metabolism I struggle with all of these except the belt and rib bruise ones
That's not bad at all
As a skinny person every thing you said is true except for the last one (I dance for life)
I sunbathed on my deck then my hips hurt for dayss lol
I totally feel for you. Id NEVER say those things to you. But id still trade you. ❤❤
I also had to poke new holes in watches because my wrists were too skinny as a kid 😂
FINALLY SOMEONE RELATES TO THE ASS PAIN OF SITTING.
As a skinny person, I also lack the ability to dance
Nah cuz my mom walked in the room the second that string of profanity came out of bella’s mouth 💀
ok here's the thing, i suffer all of this stuff as a super skinny person except the last one- i literally dance competitively lmao but also like everyone knows how toxic the dance industry can be so just think about how fun MY childhood has been
I had a medical condition and after rounds and rounds of iv medicine I can actually gain weight!! Still have to have the IV tho 😂
Just eat food.......
I can relate
I only got the first four plus I can't dance
How I know I've gained weight/muscle is that my nan is no longer shoving so many snacks down my throat
“I can’t dance”  Proceeds to dance better than me
The belt one is so true, it's not even funny
was that a chickfila trainer uniform?
I don’t know where you stole my dance moves from but stahp 😠
That dancing was so awkward 😂
I am skinny and have been my hole life so I know what it feels like to be called rude thing like: chopsticks, noodle arms and skeleton. ❤❤❤❤❤
Suspenders are better then belts wear them under your shirt
I've been 60-85 pounds since I was 7. Before that it was less, but it was cause I was smoll child. And I relate to all of these so much- my classmates tried to see if I would tear like paper kindergarten to 2nd grade. :v
😅
I cant turn my body with out messing with my ribs or lay down on my stomach 😭😭😭😭
As a super skinny person I always get asked if im scared ill blow away in the wind 😅
I think not being able to dance is a you problem
number 4 aint a problem to me, i love baggy clothes lmao
I can understand the pain 😔✋️
I can inhale a burger and still not gain a single pound
I thought I was the only one
Honestly nowadays girls (like me) get made fun of for not being skin and bones. Most of my weight is muscle and normal growing fat, but I’ve been made fun of because I naturally have a… larger bust… than a very skinny person or just being called fat in general. I’m not fat bruh 😭 the mentality today is that the skinnier, the hotter. I’m 13 and weigh 62 kg and I get made fun of for having strength?
Finally someone says it
Dudddeeeeee sammmeeeeee I fucking hate it I’m 13 and I’m about 90 lbs 🥲
DAWG ITS ALL RIGHT, IM WAY TO SKINNY AND I CAN CONFIRM
I'm starting to think I'm not chubbying correctly....
Oh no (you’re still a racist)
is me being a skinny child at nine years old and I'm only 50 pounds I agree with this
Can confirm 😢
As someone who is 13-16 and I weigh 92 pounds I can confirm, always cold and my skin is a MAP of bruises, looks like some Lord of the rings type map with mountains n shit cause I get bruised just by sitting down or working out 😅
It’s the same story with me just instead of being skinny I would always be over the “healthy” weight criteria since I was six and last year I I went to the doctor and they said I fit into the “healthy” weight category.
As a skinny person, yes. Don't forget the part where your family tells you that you're lucky to be skinny.
THANK YIU this has been said to me for my whole life..also…i can relate to being a bad dancer too
im fat but i have the problems too my bones just brust through me
Im 12 and only 28kgs so i can REALLY relate to all of these (especcialy the cabnt dance on because i look stupid)
Okay but that red bikini is CUTE as fuckkkkk slay!! ❤ and yes gay women can slay and be pretty too
As a skinny person I can confirm that being skinny makes it so I can’t dance —— glad I’m not alone on that one lol
This is so true and I freaking hate it when people say stuff like that.
I'm a thicker person, but as a child I was so thin, I still can't dance😢
Yep. And the dancing ... me either but that definitely is not because I'm skinny 😂
They just have a fast metabolism honestly something I wish I had for the most part I'm always wearing baggy clothing because I hate the way my body looks
Had a really toxic friend when I was 13 and I was skinny and she would always make remarks about how I would snap in the wind the really funny thing was I am really strong and flexible and every time I would pick up something heavy or do anything requiring any strength she would try and take it of me and in a really bittersweet tone say ‘I don’t think you can manage something that heavy’
That dancing is still better than my dancing ;-;
I’m a 95 pound 17 year old… I can confirm 😅
I HATE WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO EAT
As a skinny person, the belt, and (sometimes, I only wear high rise) pants is accurate
The holes in the belt is so true!!! I do it for like every belt cause I am so skinny😂😂 Everything though is true
I am called "Pixie" for a reason. I'm 22 and I shop in the children's section
But i never get cold, And my weight keeps going down Right now im 12 and my weight is 30kg My little brother (8y old) is almost at my weight
Bro same
You can't shave properly! My armpits have too deep of a pit for the razor to reach, so there's always hair there. Knees too -- the indents around the knee can't be hit with a razor if the knee pops out too much.
It's SAD😢
I think the CanT dance part is just u 😂😂❤❤
I made this argument yesterday, I am not a skinny person, quite the opposite actually but I was telling someone to not tell a skinny person to eat more because it's just as mean and is offensive as telling a fat person to eat less.
All the belts don't fit 😂
As a skinny person, I can confirm we can't dance
Yep sitting, laying down, and literally the smallest gust of cold wind is my skinny body's weakness
The society thing is too real and it is fucked up! The dancing one I reject 😅
Having to shop in the kids section #skinnydontcare
I am not skinny but still have those problems for some reason (except 4 and 5)
The 5th one is for me because I went to the beach with my class to do water sports there was a man that said to me”If you want to get strong you need to start eating more meat
I have been skinny and short all my life. My friends in middle school were jerks about it. They did the usual thinks of picking me up without asking, putting thier hand around my wrist to see how much room was left, saying I would be easy to beat up and kidnap, ect.  Happy to say tho I've made it to an average of 86 pounds. :]
Ive never felt more understood
Also if you're skinny like that you probably have a super high metabolism so you'll try to gain some weight by eating but it'll never do anything.
Confirmed
I can not dance to😢
i can relate
#relateable. I really want a hamburger now
I believed I was skinny for the past 12 years, this makes me realize I’m a teensy tiny bit more than skinny. Also, I suffer some of the same problems, you’re not alone.
…                                                                                                        I cannot relate. Coming from someone who gets told by my friends and family to skip a couple meals:(
I’m not that skinny, but litterally every belt, even one’s for kids, don’t fit, the only ones that do are some toddler belt with Elsa-
As a overweight person I can't confirm lol But I would rather be skinny the rest of my live than be FAT the rest of my life. But I started going to the gym and I'm losing some weight.
As a toothpick I can confirm this is true
I funny i die to be skiny
I relate to  EVERY SINGLE ONE
Thank the lord i ain't skinny cause that sounds like it fucking sucks
You just said everything about me
Finally a reason to be happy to be fat😂
This is so accurate!
Thank you!!!!!! We all feel this
Everyone makes fun of me for it
I feel like I need to say this for all us skinny people that have been collectively told “Eat a burger.” Like what is a burger gonna do? Seriously what the fuck is a burger gonna do? Nothing, absolutely nothing. I’m gonna go eat a double cheeseburger and continue to be excused of having an ED or told I’m ‘lucky’ for not being able to gain weight. Such is life. On the other hand my burger was really good so I guess thanks for the lunch recommendation?
I dont know man that dancing looks pretty valid to me
You can dance better then me and I'm skinny skinny aswell
Try learning the moonwalk It’s honestly fun, and it’s not that hard to learn. 👍
Yeah, I agree. But, I try to turn offenses into jokes.
Skinny people can dance thought have you seen ballet but the rest is true
The last twos are mostly relatable for me like whyyyyyy
That dancing one is true but if you want to look like squidword then it not
Wait, wait, wait... You did volleyball!?
Probably the social comments is the the most true. Like the hypocrisy. When people make fun of fat people its fatshaming and bullying. But when it comes to skinny people? Nope its just a joke. Nobody will defend you.
As being a skinny person and underweight, I DO EAT! And this is definitely a very true video
As a skinny person my whole life yes, this does happen 😅😂❤
Not relatable to a god of war Thor looking motherfucker like meh
I used to be really skinny as a kid and then I started to gain some weight now I am getting bullied at school for being “too fat” whenever are used to be 66 pounds until I turn 8 years old
as a complete fatass, i cannot confirm
Yeah I don't think anyone can dance
Wdym you can't dance those were the moves
I got body shamed by my own grandparents, but now everything got better.  And yes as a skinny person I can 100% confirn.
As an almost literal twig of a person, I'm glad these problems have been recognized
**me who is so bulky that I have a layer of pure blubber like I am a whale existing**
This
I can confirm non of my clothes fit, and people would tell me (I WAS LIKE 5 AND UNDER) that I was so easy to just grab and snap in half, or just be so easy to kidnap from being so skinny and not being strong, and I'm still not at a healthy weight 😭
You're still skinny though
This was almost too relatable 😂
As a fat person I don’t know
I was at Ross with my mom, she was staring at the cashier so I asked "what is it?" And she whispered to me "look how thin she is, god she needs a sandwich!" Couldnt look her in the eye for the rest of the day
Don’t worry I’ll give you some of my fat I got you skinny people
Dude the eating is so annoying cause im super off and on with eating cause sometimes ill almost halfway starve myself and eat the bare minimum then the next thing ya know ill eat anything i find. (Oh yeah and its incredibly hard to gain weight)
Id still take skinny comments over the fat shaming I've endured over the years. I've always been fat. Literally, as a kid, fat. As an adult, fat. Doesn't matter what I do and I don't know why. I still get fat shamed and people seem to automatically have a dislike for me because im fat.
Every flat surface hurts to sit on when you have a boney butt..
I relate to this on a spiritual level.   I mean, rn I'm wearing a jacket in 40 degree weather because the FAN is making me cold.  Don't even get me started on belts or belt-like watches. Either buy one for kids or poke a hole in them. I got no other choice 💀 Especially all that teasing as a kid- "Is that all you're gonna eat?" "You look like a skeleton-" I didn't take offence to it though.  The bruising when you sit down on a hard surface for too long is even worse- I wouldn't be able to touch that area for a few days.
“I cant dance!!” Me: 🦭🦭🦭
Twinners
Soo true :'-⁠)
Thing is I did eat a burger and get meat on my bones…..just now I need to exercise 😐
You ain't wrong
As a skinny person, I can relate! Except o don't eat enough food...   and I would just like to say that some skinny people can dance. 😊  I do 10 hours a week if dance for competitions 😂 And I'm 13
Someone in my 4th grade class when i was in 4th grade called me a twig and then my brother called me fat and then someone called me skinny and all of those hurt me
Tbh she dances better than me 😭😂😭😭
My parents started a rumour in my (extended) family about me, that I photosynthesised instead of eating 🥲
HONESTLY!
Not to mention you can’t say your “not hungry” without people assuming you’re anorexic. You can’t stand up without getting light headed
I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY. I confirm all of this 👏👏
I don't think you would normally see a fat person dancing either
And I'm also short, so people treat me as if I'm a toddler. I really don't like that, and that is one of the many reasons I don't like socializing. People always bring up my size.
Number 6 is straight up a lie
As a very not skinny person, I can relate to about three of these 😂
Don’t worry I can’t dance either and I’m also skinny as duck. I can agree about everything that was said in this video which kinda sucks . But oh well. Keep killing on your videos!!
YES, MY ASS BONES HURT WHEN I SIT DOWN 💀
IS THAT WHY I’M ALWAYS SO GODDAMN COLD?!   Also yeah, can confirm as someone who is on the cusp between underweight and not it does hurt your ass to sit if you don’t distribute your weight a specific way
Yeah the burger comment 😐
Also. Roller coaster seats. Can’t sit in them anymore. They are too lose
ok so for the belt, im not skinny but for the longest time i had problems with belts until i found a certain type of belt. idk what they are called, i have 2 of them, they dont have holes but they are weaved in a way that the entire thing can be a hole kinda. no holes are made, the buckle just pokes thru it. they are the only belts i use because my size usually falls right in the middle of 2 holes on a normal belt
I got asked if I died rn how long would it take for me to decompose I'm still thinking about it🙃
Yes! OH MY GOD!!!
Saying someone is “Too” skinny, or calling them a skeleton is equivalent to calling someone fat, or over weight.
As a person who was skinny as hell can confirm
I'm skinny.... My legs are really long... Just imagine my pants...
THANK YOU. you don't know how annoying it is to javelin parents tell you this "isnt normal.". WELL HA. NOW IVE GOT PROOF.
No this is fr one of my own friends told me "omg y r u so skinny do u have an ed" like I'm glad he tried to look out for my health but news flash I have no control over my wait 🙄
As a skinny person I confirm I have been told I could break like a willow bank cause  I'm skinny as fuck my mom came up to me one day and bought me a cake and said eat it and I ate it but it did nothung
Racist
Amen
68 fucking pounds at 12 why
Im the balance between skinny and fat
That's literally me
Things I relate to in the video Sitting pain- MY ASS CHEEKS ARE FLAT AND I NEED CUSHIONS  laying down bruises- god help me you can see me ribs through my skin  Always cold- I will be wearing non ripped jeans- long sleeve t shirt and hoodie and still ask for blankets   4- clothes don’t fit- this is worse because not only am I skinny, I’m SHORT so if I find a nice top it’s like ooo it’s in my age range which is 12-13 or 13-13 and I try it in and it just HANGS but then I’m like ‘ okay maybe a size for 10-11 fits but it’s all TERRIBLE LOOKING  Society- u think skinny people are left alone by society? hahahahahhahahahah no. Not even your family leaves you alone, example. Mum- finishyour  dinner this is why you’re skinny, brother- you look skeletal , Nan- you eat like a pigeon  I can dance but it just looks worse to other people even tho I dance well I’ve been in a musical theatre school for eight years  Society is f-Ed up to skinny people, even children  Edit- I meant 13-14 not 13-13
My family can not seem to comprehend this
onlyjayus: "I CAN'T DANCE" also onlyjayus: (proceeds to dance better than I have ever danced my entire fucking life)
Tip: get a D ring belt, it isn't holes so you can put it as tight as needed
7. When you go down a slide your back bone gets bruised.  Or is that just me
Same as a skinny person I can confirm none of us can dance look skinny person can dance it’s impossible
“I Can’t  D A N C E” *dances far better than I ever could*
First 3, can confirm. 4th was "jokingly" (bs). 5th, I like to believe that I can dance.
That's me
I would believe the dancing. Is a tall people problem. Because long limbed people have to watch out where their swinging their limbs.
All OK bit Bella u CAN dance that was good
As a decently sized person not overweight but not skinny I can neither dance so that's not just you being skinny we're just that dancing
EXACTLY!! and people assume that we love our body just because we're skinnya
Don't worry, no white people can dance
How is 66 pounds healthy weight?? Please y’all making me feel rlly fat rn
The skinny people shall UNITE
The other day I got new skateboarding gear and had to add more Velcro to it
Relatable though especially when u wanna twerk just buy like shaking your ass but you got nothing to shake 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
As a skinny person, this is correct
Sometimes I’ll be wearing a jacket during the summer cause it’s so cold lol 😅
Thank so freaking much bro for say that pain that we skinny people have to go through.
Yo same, I have always been skinny and honestly I am still skinny, the comments you got are relatable too. Someone, after I took off my sweatshirt, once said I looked malnourished, like damn I live in America the country famous for being exactly the opposite and yes I do eat.
Bro you're lucky😶
As a person who is skinny af all of this is true and the bad part is i am kinda picky and when i eat i only eat a little. I also can confirm that we can't dance get really cold and pretty much everything else on that list. Next time you think saying to a child "you need to get meat on those bones" think about how you are going to emotionally scar that child for a while.
Being skinny doesn't mean you are weak. Iam also skinny but iam strong af.
I CAN RELATE TO ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I'M SKINNY MY WHOLE. GODDANG. LIFE.  I get cold so easily that even just a fan can make me cold in under a minute (in hot weather too!)  I've always been told that I'm all bones as a child which actually really hurt.  doing anything can make my body hurt. doing an Indian sit hurt my legs so much. and I always experience cramps randomly in the morning   clothes don't fit me. literally I've recently received some shorts that's meant for my age but you could fit another person in with me wearing the shorts at this point
As a heavier person I don't have anything to say about the first 2 3. I get hot very very easy 4. Clothes for me don't fit well either  5. Heavier people get told to eat a salad or work out or eat less 6. I can't dance either 😭😭 (Just to let you know this is hate, not saying you took it as hate but some people probably might idk)
i thought the seat was only me ..
I literally weight 100 pounds and 14 💀
I FEEL THIS, I WEAR 28/34 PANTS AND THEY ARE SO HARD TO FIND
Fr
"I can't DANCE!" (Proceeds to have the shwiftiest moves ever)
Don't forget the "OMG you're so skinny, I wish I could stay in shape like that!"
The cant dance part is not a skinny person problem, i am fat af and i cant dance 😂
BRO 😂 THIS IS LITERALLY ME AND IM 12
Also when your laying on your stomach it will also just bruise your  knees for some god damn reason- so that’s also fun.
that’s what i’ve been saying to everyone forever!!!
Then they try to get you to eat when you trained yourself not to and you end up self conscious, sad, and sick to your stomach 😢
The worst!
I don’t know about you guys but Bella’s dance moves look great to me. :)
i deffinetly understand this and then my parents say i starve myself??????
O my god I relate!!
I remember I first acknowledged the fact that I was super skinny when I looked down at my arms to realize that my bones and veins/arteries were both quite visible.  It’s is also why I now enjoy wearing thinly layered sweaters with long sleeves whenever I go out.
Killer moves there 😂
Me being the fat ass that I am:😢 I wish I was like you
#relatable as a skinny person😅 but those dance moves slayed
Did you play basketball when you were younger?
I have never related to something so much
Welcome to hell buddy 😂
Yes!!! I hate it when people call me skinny and put there hands on my wrist and show to space. Also the clothes are terrible. It's been like that since I can remember
I’m 14 and am at 80 something pounds
You are the most relatable person on this app. I’m skinny af :)
none of you understand how much worse it is being fat
I suffer from 3-5
All so true! especially the sitting and laying down it hurts so bad
I am currently skinny (i hate it) and i can 100% agree with this!
When I was about 8 there were these 5th grades who would say things to me like “go eat something” “you’re so skinny” “you would fly away on a windy day, be careful” and I just ignored them. Now I realized that’s really messed up to say to an 8 year old
I have I friend that was born a couple months early and she has a twin so she takes shots everyday
Same hereeeee. I’m literally lighter than my sister who is 3 years younger than me :\
You just explained how and why I have anxiety
this is so relatableeeee
My moms skinnier
i need to meet more people that get both skinny shamed and fat shamed bc i have the ribs and seat problems too but im not exactly skinny, i have muscle in my arms and legs but my waist and ribcage bones are exposed but the bone structure i have is super curvy and idek if im fat skinny or mid size 😭
as a 177, 40kg, i can confirm
Poking more holes into a belt is always so annoying!
At least your dancing is better then my sister attempting to do the Wap (help me) she hit me when she saw that and why I wasn’t watching
Your dancing is better then my sisters at least :^
MY aunt ,her wife AND my best friend are super skinny like you.
I can’t with the belt one. 😂 this is way too relatable. I used to either A. Attempt to use a hole puncher. Or B. Find my dad’s drill and drill s hole into my belt.
As a skinny person I can agree this is all true
What about when you hit your hip on a table, you’re hitting straight bone 😭
Who says you can’t dance? Work ittt
pov: me
Bro every single one of these happened to me and it's so fucking annoying
im normal size for my age, but one thing is my stomach is a lot thinner than my rib cage. this causes my rib cage to poke out a heck of a lot more than my stomach does, so my friends think im sucking in 24-7 and I always have bruises on my ribs from laying down.
I can’t I’m literally in my pajamas right now and guess what they’re pinned up also I’m always cold and really in like one of those big blanket hoodies and I have like three blankets on my bed at all times
me: *thinking i’m fat* everyone: “do you eat?” “you’re a stick” “get some meat on those bones” also me: *relates to everything on here* me: …..hm
I get it, i was so skinny as a kid and i could literally not gain any weight, people started asking my mom if she was actually feeding me and calling me anorexic, i had to gi on booster drinks for two years and every restaurant we went to i had to eat all my food and then my stepdad would make me eat half of his food even if i was nauseous, not that im at a weight that js healthy people have commented that i should start to go on a diet because i have an actual belly but idgaf because i feel AMAZING ABOUT MY SELF like im sorry for having organs and not being a Minecraft skeleton, moral of the story. People suck
You have the confidence to dance like that in front of all of your loyal viewers and i respect that. I wouldn't even dance in front of my friends and family
Huh. No wonder I get use to temperatures so easily. And no wonder almost everyone I know is cold at all times.
I ligit am living through everything you just said😂
As a fellow skinny person, oh my fucking god this is so relatable (I'm still skinny tbh) my arms are so thin that we have to poke new holes in watches for them to fit and the belt one 😭
So those comments people said to me actually made it worse bc I developed anorexia bc I was afraid to gain weight and if i did then they would see me as gluttonous and fat
im skinny and i can dance
YOUR DANICING IS AMAZING
Male or female realli
I have the same issues with temperature and sitting down not quite skinny enough to get bruises on my ribs, thank god, but I got plenty of other issues that aren't related to being skinny.
I used to like being skinny, them people were like" Do YoU eAt?" "hAvE yOu BeEn EaTiNg"
ur moves are SLCIK
Yep, number 4 definitely applies to me, and my assbones hurt when it sit, so yeah.
No one talks about the sitting one
I'm 11 and I just now gained weight like you could see my ribs though my shirt
😂 dude your the best
It will be like 72 degrees in my house and I'll walk out with the sweater my dad's like why are you wearing a sweater and I'm like it's cold
Facts
Love! The dance moves!!!! Like xDDDD Life of the party!!! 🔥 XDDD
Bro I'm so skinny my stomach curves in
I relate this sooo much!!!!  Accept I did dance, and was t9ld I was good, but I didn't feel I was good!! 💙🖤🖤
Alright let’s face it. She can dance.
She can dance better than me 😢
Im skinny and this is all true
I live with this
Omg this is so true I'm 70 lbs and I just broke away from 69 and people say I'm lucky and that I can't be insecure I'm 12 send help
As a kid that is scrawny as fuck, like I can touch my thumb and pinky together around my arm, I understand all of this. And the worst part about it is I can't even gain weight no matter how much I eat.
My parents always question why I have a blanket, I get so fucking cold I fell like im in antartica I have hypoglycemia and I lose more weight than I gain, so I am super fucking skinny, so I have a lot of these problems I relate to you and I'm trying to get into a healthy weight
wtf my ass bones do hurt if I sit
Nobody can dance lol 😂
Im super skinny and evryone i know say dat and i have all those effects
Person- "omg are you ok eat something gain some weight ur perfect" Men *I fucking can't!*
Me to but as a skinny person when I was in high school people always asked to fight me and they said it was because they said they would win because I was so skinny they could snap me In half like a stick and they never saw anything wrong with that because they thought that being skinny was amazing and there was no south thing as skinny shaming only fat shaming
I relate on another level, especially to the first two and the fourth one
At the start of 4th grade I was 40 pounds and until 6th grade I was below the weight chart and still then I was skinny(I’ve always been at an average height for my age btw)
As someone who was super skinny in the past, these used to happen to me  (I’m just average now-)
Yah being skinny sucks my parents said those things to me
the belt one is so relatable.      all of them are for me, but the belt is more
My sister doesn’t eat a lot of food and is pretty skinny. Whenever she swims she just sinks. She barley keeps her head above the water, and it’s really funny. To me anyway
I relate to the pants falling down and your belt not helping… sigh
I used to know that struggle. I'm so grateful my body leveled out. But yeah, people can be just as nasty to skinny people too.
seems like you actually CAN dance, miss.
whoever said you cant dance is wrong, if you cant dance, i cant dance. and let me tell you, i can dance.
We can dance together but fr I can relate I am a skinny person 👌👍
Fat person here... no sympathy lol
OMG THIS IS SO RELATABLE
As a very skinny person I can confirm that this is all true and a pain especially since I have an edit disorder people telling me to eat more is a pain I swear it’s stupid
Nah bc these all happen to me but even my parents thought that I didn’t eat my friends and kids at school AND EVERYONE SAYS I AM A STRING BEAN OR HAVE NOODLE ARMS PLEASE STOP I AM EATING AND WORKING OUT BUT IDK WHAT TO DO LEAVE ME TF ALONE
why do i litaraly feel like crying watching this video! I hate being so thin i once had a boy ask me why my thighs are so thin (same F up at 14 years boy who ended up sexualy assaulting me and my sis later) and a heavier set girl once compleatly brushed of my insecurities about my weight saying "You're so lucky I wish i was as skinny as you!" after listening to her rant about her insecurities she didn't even validate mine.
perfect dancing
Did that day 67 pounds???
As a skinny person, I relate to all of this
I'm not skinny but I have the same thing with the bones part... I just have a flat ass... and I guess my bones are very close to my skin? Idk
Honestly if someone told me to go eat a burger as a kid, I would be pretty f**king happy
Well… now I know why I can’t dance 😂😂😂😂❤
Bro I feel you I'm skinny af to
as a fellow skinny person, i can 100% relate
As a skinny person I can confirm
At this point no one can dance anymore
I'm skinny cause I dance. I can't sit for 2 seconds
What do you mean you can’t dance? That was amazing.
Omg yes I rode horse for two hours and it hurt so bad 😀
Seriousli was 11 and I wade 34.2 pounds!!!
Oh! Don’t forget 7. where you actually get blown away by the wind. No, Just me? Okay…
Nah bc when I was a kid I was so skinny that’m there was a roomers that I was anorexic.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT MY BODY WAS JUST WEIRD OR SOMETHING FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS! ITS BECAUSE IM SKINNY!? I LITERALLY LIVE IN ARIZONA AND IM ALWAYS COLD! (This explains a lot) 😭
I am relating to this you have not seen my dancing
Wish i could gain weight im 6 foot tall and i way 115 and im thirteen
I am 10yo and about 28 kg
I’m not skinny but I still can’t dance lol 😂
U can dance slay
I love the way you dance that’s how I dance on the last day of school
Yea, the comments were the worst "do you have anorexia?!"
I have these problems too.😭
Also bumping your hip on something-
i’m not skinny whatsoever and i can’t dance either man 😔
As a professional skinny person, I can confirm, your video is very true
Me who has eating disorders since I was 4: relatable af.
The can’t dance prob is just you Bella we still love you and ur skinny ass
FOR REAL
as a skinny person all of my damn life i can confirm all of this is true, like ig atleast we are somewhat flexible 🥲
Ok, skinny and I eat hella I eat so damn much it's crazy I just have a very fast metabolism
I used to have that problem before I became a pre teen. Now I’m way more meaty but not overweight.
Exactly what being tall and skinny is like
Wow… 66lbs is way too skinny…I’m sorry
relatable
I’m skinny so I can relate 😂
I’ve always been skinny and short so throughout school I would just be picked up, called a midget and everyone comparing me. Then they ask why I’m upset
I feel so sad when people comment on my weight like i can blow you away,go eat etc all that bulllshit and i am still very young my parents never understand neither did anyone else until i watched this video thanks a lot bella ❤
I am literally crying no one has ever understood me this good before thank you bella
I feel this, I’m really skinny and people say I will fly away in the wind if I don’t eat a burger, especially my parents but I can’t help it I’m only 13
I am skinny so this is me and I can’t dance at all
This is so ture with diabetes I lost a lot of weight and im still struggling to get it back to a healthy level
When I was in year 6 I moved schools and I couldn’t order the year 6 shirts so my teacher asked if there was any extra shirts in my size to the head teacher. When she saw me the first thing she said was “Oh she’s s skinny!” . And the rest of the year I was so self conscious about myself.
Im a boy and this is so true
FR!
She just describes me literally <3
Being chubby does nothing for warmth.... trust me, my hoodies stay out all year long and I'm not in a cold climate
I’m not skinny but- I still can’t dance 😅
As an obese person with a lot of skinny friends, whenever it’s cold outside, they all huddle around me and won’t let me move.
Don't call me out like that
Heyyyy I'm skinny af and I'm a pointe dancer
BRO SAME
Me also being really fucking skinny this also happens to me
I have a fat ass but it hurts when I sit. The rest, I guess I can't relate, except for being bad at dancing.
The can’t dance part umm…that is not a problem it’s just the way u dance and I can’t dance so yea
So relatable
As having a skinny bff I confirm And I'm the fat friend
lucky ppl who are skinny i got body shamed bymy teacher for being fat.
I cant sit like normal bc it HURTS SO BAD I’m skinny I’m 13 and I weigh 31kg I’ve tried to gain weight and I’ve gotten mean comments it’s just not working out for me
Yep sadly
Yeah I used to be overweight as a kid because of some medications I used. And everyone EVEN the teachers would tell me to stop eating. ITS LIKE BRO I WAS 8
As a skinny person, I really can't dance
1 -4 are so relatable cause sitting like that hurts a lot and I have to kind of cross my legs to give them a break LIFE HACK😅😅😂😂
BRUH U CAN DANCE BUT IT ISN'T CALLED DANCING... ITS CALLED MOVING TO THE SOUND IN A F*CK UP WAY LOLLLL....
I was born with dad bod
Bro so true
Go skinny people
honestly same I just got to a normal weight for a 15 year old and I still get cold really easy
Me just relating to all of this I was always told “is that all ur gonna eat”
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh     I just felt like it was right to say 😂
I’m a girl but my dad makes me use this pic and you can dance
I relate to all of these. My friends be like, "Why are you wereing a fucking sweater in the god damn summer?"
As I skinny person, I can relate!
I’m not skinny af but I’m still horrible at dancing 😂😂😂
my skinny friend can dance just fine even betterr than me
shut u said n word
I am fridge built and everything around me breaks if I'm not careful
Jayus: I can’t dance My brain:How is she that good at dancing ❤️

"I can't dance" **Busts a move**

I swear jayus always puts a smile on my face 😂
you can dance ma'am and it was perfect
As a semi skinny person I can semi confirm
So relatable
I dare say that that is excellent dancing 💃 😁  Also, this is so relatable, especially the thing about comments you get from people. It really can hurt your self confidence
You forgot can't do god damn push ups cause your arms are weak AF
my thicky thighs make instant hand warmers and i’m glad
yea getting cold is the worst part
Dude same also I have those shoes 🤞❤️‍🩹
Watching you try to dance made my day 😂😅
I don’t know why their saying they can’t dance cuz I think their an amazing dancer better than me
My sister is VERY Skinny
Ok I am apparently skinny
I’m not “fat” but I’m not “skinny” either,not to sound rude,u know,anyways,and bro,tons of my friends DO get called fast and I’m like,how in the world are u cold cause they’re wearing a jumper in summer! Is now I understand
me eating alot but is still skinny:👿😡💅
actually tho
People always make a big deal when I eat food and I’m like, “WHAT?”. I was in a restaurant and a lady I was eating with goes, “OMG, alert the media, she’s finally eating!” I eat everyday.
its not skinny people cant dance its just your a bad dancer
i feel your pain
SAME BRO IM ONLY 80 pOUNDS
" I can't dance" dances better than I can. me: 👁👄👁
I was  "chicken leg poodle hair girl" when I was a kid so now all I do is binge eat to gain weight and then I starve myself to get skinny again because I'm too fat 😂
As a skinny person, my mum kept on saying that I should eat a steak. I don't really know what to do so 😭
its the same for me but i play sports  i build muscle
can relate. like seriously. to all of that been under 100 pounds for my whole life  also you can dance danggg
As a kid who was skinny as a fucking twig, I can tell you this:  You're either told to eat more, or eat less by 99.9999999999999999% of all your fucking relatives. Like TF DO I DO?????  And literally you fit in absolutely NO FUCKING DAMN FUCKING DRESS OR PANTS.
Wtf
Relatable
The pants are the most relatable
I'm skinny and I'm literally a ballerina and can stand and look grateful on one toe
eat some mcdonalds?
Be skinny sucks worse when you actually start to gain fat weight because then all the dresses you bought suddenly don't fit and you have to go out to buy new ones despite being done growing via age. I can no longer fit into my favorite dress and while I'm happy that I'm finally gaining weight it was still my favorite dress 😢 Some people REALLY don't understand that being skinny is just as bad as being "fat". I put it in quotations bc most people who are complaining about being fat are people who are just a little above a normal weight and are insecure about it. Don't get me wrong, being overweight can be a problem too, with massive health repurcussions, but those people are usually less insecure about it and more worried about it as they count up the number of issues that can develope. Same goes for being underweight. Sometimes, i go days without eating food bc i just forget for 2 days and lose my apatite the rest. You also need to be more wary when taking medications, bc most of the time the effectiveness is based on weight and it becomes easier to accidentally overdose when you see someone not underweight taking 500 mg of something. The WORST part is the coldness. I'm always cold which means I'm always uncomfortable which means I'm almost always on the verge of a panic attack. Literally just wish to be warm for once 🥶
Oh yeah I can relate to all of these- 😭
These are just beautiful dance moves, idk what you're talking about!
Most relatable thing I’ve seen this month
If your too fat: go to the gym! Lose weight! If your too skinny: go eat a burger or some, ur skinny as he11!   But remember that your perfect the way you are ❤
“OMG I wish I was as skinny as you!” No you don’t. I’m literally borderline underweight
I am 5' 11" and 110 lbs I can say all of these are true.
When I was eleven I weighed 28kg- idk what’s normal but someone’s little sister weighed more than me
I now have 4 youtubers I want to be friends with: - Jaiden (JaidenAnimations) - Rebecca (LetMeExplain Studios) - SmokeeBee - Jay (onlyjayus) (i think jay is your name)
But as a skinny person your very flexible. (Hopefully)
I hate being skinny, im still a kid I get called names all the time example: shrimp(y) twig and my hight aswell haha I get calls short, migget and stuff like that :] I love life
I’m fifteen and my friend made a joke that I’m 90 pounds and I was like ‘yup, just hit ninety!’ And she looked horrified
It's true but I'm a dancer so I don't get the last one
IM SKINNY AS FUCK TOO
litterly me i struggle with my weight and people tell me to go eat something when i cant gain weight fast
U can dance
Okay this is kinda funny to me cause I've been skinny for quite a while too cause I grew and now I can't gain weight-
All of those things perfectly describe me
People can’t hug you otherwise they’ll get a paper cut
omg yeah and also all the jealous ppl who say "how do you eat and dont get weight? omg i wish i was as skinny🙁🙁🙁" NO BITCH YOU'RE NOT. I literally cant get weight even tho i want to. and its kind of embarrasing when your friends can just lift you on their shoulder and take anywhere they want😵‍💫
Girl I think you just can't dance
I love your videos and how you start the video in cool ways I wanna make videos like these but I don't know where to start 🤔
I had anorexia went from 164 to 105 in a year I got these comments felt this pain EXCEPT  I don’t get cold like at all in fact I’m constantly warm even with the temp is 67 degrees Fahrenheit   One thing I will say is I’m smaller than the small in Japan IN JAPAN
You don't need to be skinny to be bad at dancing there are tons of people who are good at dancing and who are skinny you just can't dance
The sitting one is terrible in class
SAME besides the comments
was once literally my life every Singel DAY! what made it worse, if someone like slaped my back they said 'you sound hollow. do you even have insides.?'..
As a skinny man , yeah i understand your problem
Skeeny people problems smh. I was under 100 lbs until sophomore year.
You dance better than me
Who's gonna tell her that the fact that she can't dance has nothing to do with her weight? 😂😂😂
I'm underweight and god i can't relate more
Literally got told no-one will marry me and love me  if l look that skinny as a fucking 11 year old
I can relate to this sm, and yesterday I've been told '' dear god do your parents starve you? ''
i’m 14 and i struggle with my weight too, i’m 82 pounds… the amount of hate that comes out of people’s mouth is ridiculous. i am so insecure about every little part on my body due to mean people
I know, my nurse said to other students that I had some sort of illnes and she said if u dont eat ur going to look like her
"Do you even eat?"  Me: no i actually adapted to useing photosynthesis to that i can obsorb energy from the damn sun
this is valid
I don’t think anyone can dance. The only people have seen, dancer professionals, or TikTok dancers.😂 people that actually try to dance good but repeat the same dance over and over again
U should dance more
I was under 100 pounds until about 16 I was called twig while a friend of mine on the chunky-er side was called log sooooo……
All of this is tooo true
when jayus can dance better than you
This is accurate I’m meant to say 100 i weigh 70 lol
frfr
As someone who used to be skinny and still has half of these issues Omg yes
"I CANT DANCE" *proceeds to bust a move*
I was a skinny kid, ate a lot but didn't gain any weight. Ate a whole lot more than my big mates
Girl did that say 66 pounds? When I was nine I weighed 80 pounds 💀😭
As a skinny person, I can confirm these  also I've been scrolling through the comments for a while and no one is really talking about thE FREAKIN COLD PART GHSRILKFTEJSLKESA lIKE I'D JUST BE AT SCHOOL EVERYONE ELSE IS SWEATING AND I'M WEARING 5 LAYERS SHIVERING HFIEKSJESLKJFSA
so yea, i’m 13 and weigh 65 lbs. i constantly get made fun of and these pretty much all apply to me. but omg the easily cold one is REAL.
Not being able to dance just comes with being white
"Bro, you need to eat" *Proceeds to eat up the whole resturant* "It. Doesn't. Work."
I gotta say the first two affect me and im not skinny LOL i have absolutely no ass tho
As a skinny person, I can confirm this is true
i thought it was just me
As a skinny person, i can conform all of this
I can relate and just be healthy
I can relate to all of this. You can literally straight up see my rib bones even though I eat a healthy amount.
My toddler used to say my legs were too boney and so uncomfortable to sit on my lap 😅
The fun my mom saying "well glad you got some meat on you i thought you were anerexic for the longest time"  Now i just need to work on the working out part.
That is true
As a skinny person this is so relatable, all my 'high-rise' jeans become low rise and I'm cold all the time
The laying down thing! Kids at my school always used to want to lay down and say it was so comfortable and cause I was a stupid little kid I thought that meant i should too, so I would always lay on my stomach at recess and lunch and stuff snd ignore the pain and bruising it caused
As a fat person almost everything is the same except getting fat shamed instead
I hate how people say you need to eat more or you need lose weight which can be confusing
same same same !!
Yep exactly that 😂
One day, I wanna look like you. :3
Omg so fucking relatable!
It's May and I'm still sleeping with a fuzzy blanket and a comforter
Literally I went to a restaurant with my grandparents and their siblings. My great aunt saw me, hugged me, and whispered in my ear, "you need to eat more.) And I was like 😐  I got bloated after but still
im underweight for my age but a national winning competitive dancer
The belt, the ass hurt from sitting on hard surface, the ribs hurt from laying on the floor.. getting literally no pants that fit my waist and match my height, the struggle is real. ☹️ Even though I never looked too skinny, so comments weren't a thing much, but my god rest of them are still a bother.
I remember I used to be really skinny and one of my classmates told me to just eat more 💀
how is this so accurate. i eat so much meat but i am still so skiny
Being skinny sucks I’m also skinny
me too 😭 me and my friends were doing a spa day and the girl doing mine was like “ ew ur so skinny i can literally feel all ur bones do u have an ed? are u ok?” And this other time my friends and i were playing butt tag where u just slap peoples buts HAHAHA but this girl Vivian was like “don’t slap laurens butt or you’ll hear a skeleton cracking” 😭😭😭
I'm SLIGHTLY overweight and like sitting down is so painful.
very true
Get DNA tested and see what your body will consume calories fast or just do the script method and by purre raw trans-fat to make your body super fat
I can relate. I wear pants like 3 sizes lower because of the waistband. Thank God I'm short too. Also, my lips turn purple when I swim for a while.
I'm just like you I'm really skinny
Yeah fat people get a lot more attention than skinny people Like if you are fat you can have a diet,workout,maybe medicines too I'm not sure But if you are skinny you just have to deal with it I have a friend who eats just as much if not less than me but he is fat while i am skinny as f*ck
It’s nice to know I’m not the only one suffering
I would pay money to see you do the amazing dance moves for an hour
I swear this is just me
girl I'm 11 and under 70 lbs i can relate too much to this
Understand what you mean about the dancing. It's like there's no power in your moves just air
The last problem has nothing to do with weight 😆😆 I am 120kg still can't dance 🤣
Shut up nigga
You couldn't dance because u were dancing to gonna make you sweat lol
Yes, I do eat. Ravenously. I’m barely 120lbs.
Welp all my insecurities just left my mind (turns out im skinny like everyone tells me)
They make XXS belts, also Skinny people can dance.
You sexy
Looking your skinny photos. I am still more skinnier.
Ngl, being skinny is no excuse for not being able to dance, I'm skinny after too and I can fucken shmoove
Noo not the poking new holes in the belt!! That hits hard
same problems except for  the cold thing, i am the complet opposite
as a male wih a little bi of fat very true i still have fat but like none
i get it i am realy skinny
Sorry but my mom is a great dancer
Me who is an overweight person - interesting 😂
I am pretty short too and skinny and I usually never got told hi when u first met someone. The convo started with either “ur short.” Or “go eat a burger.” Yeah. And my parents wonder why I need therapy.
I’m a  skinny person aswell I can’t relate to the getting cold easily
When I was little I used a large dog collar
My sisters and I, all different waist sizes but we all use that same belts, the amount of holes we’ve poked in those belts 😂 Now we have to race each other to the best belt when we’re all going out.
So that's where all this came from from me being skinny Jesus
I have been skinny my entire life until my great grandma died then I became depressed at 12 started gaining alot of weight because I couldn't stop eating and people would say all these rude comments like well look who finally ate something and my great grandma always said go eat something your too skinny and all sorts of stuff I'm still fat and I'm 14 no idea what to do with these comments people are giving me any advice?
How do you stay skinny tho bc I I want to try to get skinnier bc I’m trying to going on a diet so what do u
I’m extremely skinny and I’m tired of people saying eat more
Everything with the bones really
I can relate😭
I am a very skinny person so I know how hard it is ❤
I relate to the belt but I'm not skinny
Thanks you for knowing my pain😂😢
I can confirm this is very true
I swear it's only fat people who say things like that to skinny people.😂
Don't worry you dance better then me and I'm thicc 💀
The dancing resignated with my skinny soul 🎵 BUT I had a round face so I looked chubby yet extremely skinny 👁️👄👁️the struggle is real
Yup sounds about right lol
so relatable!!!! I cant lay on hard floors or do sit ups cause my spine gets brused like my ribs
Ok so that is bad wanna hear how much worse is bieng fat?
U remind me of my sister. She's tall and skinny. She also can't dance lmao
I thought I was the only one
Bro same
fax speaking straight fax
Finally, something relatable
“I can’t dance”  Proceeds to show some of the sickest moves not even my grandma could pull off
😂😂😂😂as the fat girl my whole exact same problem except for the go eat a burger unfortunately I got the horrible opposite 👍but I’m almost 40 now don’t care 😂😂😂
❤I know how you feel I'm skinny❤and I get skinny shamed a lot❤
I can rillat
I am super skinny too so I can relate
Confirmed
the dancing sent me
I feel this
OML IT HURTS TO BE SKINNYYYYY😩😩😭😭😭
I do not think the Dan ring has to do with you being skinny lol
Can you stop yelling it's annoying also please just give up on yt
YOU WEIGH 66🤯IM A KID AND WEIGH 90
As a fat person, I cannot relate, instead of needing to make a belt fit, it’s either pain, or suck it wear sweatpants
This is so relatable
Nahh she ain't dancing that's just my mid night vibe
That last one is just white people problems
I can not dance either
I mean you can dance better than me😅
As a skinny mf I fully agree Exept on the dancing part
When they say: dO yOur parEnTs nOt FeeD U? Like dude if they didn’t feed me how the f i am alive!?
I’m so unbalanced I have the longest legs for my waist and upper body like in 4’11 but my legs 3 ft long so I’m so weirdly balanced and it’s so hard to find close that fit 🤣🤣
as a skinny person this is so relatable thank you  edit: sorry to be that girl but thank you for all the likes 💜 edit 2: rip my notifications 💀
Beds are heaven to skinny people like me
Girl I love you lol
Too true
DOING PUSH-UPS RUBS YOUR GODDAMN SHOULDER BLADES TOGETHER!!!
Me
literally me 💀 And at school the PE teachers say “If I can do it u can do it” I DON’T LOOK LIKE U!  but I don’t get cold very fast and I’ll eat a lot and never gain any weight but if I don’t eat and I’m starving I’ll feel like I need to pass out..
I can definitely relate to all of these besides the clothes not fitting one actually.
Im skinny and acedentaly lost ten pounds after a surgery
FR
IKR it’s so annoying!!!I just can’t!
Nah dancing is just a skill issue bc I’m also skinny af and I am a dancer  But omg the sitting down one oooof
Tbh I’m a skinny person too and some of my friends have called me “a stick” because of my body. Though, right mow, we are cool with each other. 😅😊
Wdym you can’t dance?! That was the best fucking dancing I’ve ever seen! 😂 🕺
Correct. I'm skinny and true.
I’m at a normal weight yet my “area where I urinate and let out feces” still hurts if I sit to long
You dance better than anyone I’ve seen before
I’m fat and I can’t dance
Well im part of the club to very reliable
My problem is I only to plyos and calve raises so I’m skinny and my legs are BIG ASF I have the best vert you see in a 12 year old I can touch almost touch the rim on a basketball court.
Yes.
You didn’t have to traumatize me at the end…💀🤚
FINAILLY SOMEONE RELATES. But the belt its the worst after that the sad comments you get.
“I just got to a good weight “ 66pounds 💀
I deal with all these issues except for the dancing thing I'm a great dancer
im  skinny i guess i get all of those
So accurate and I am so skinny you can literally see my entire rib cage and I have a really high metabolism that makes it really hard to remain in a healthy weight level for long
This is true
As a skinny person this is very true. What bothers me most is whenever I say I don't like being skinny all the time they say "well atleast your not fat your lucky your skinny" but just let me have my insecurities your making me feel even worse
As a fellow skinny person…I feel your pain  I had a literal priest at church tell me I needed to eat and I looked like I’d never eaten when I was fucking NINE YEARS OLD
Stop bc this is true
This is so true
You’re like the only one who understands 😭😭😭
“You can’t dance!” Kpop idols: 👹
Same here
Hello fellow skinny legend   Don’t be jealous of us all it helps me do is fit i between my dads car and the garage door so I can get my water bottle I left in my moms car
I can relate 😂
POV me trying to do a TikTok tread
This is very true
As someone who is 89 pounds (it’s healthy for my height and I’m in highschool) nothing I eat makes me gain weight and people think my parents don’t feed me when in reality I just don’t gain weight and it’s annoying because Walmart only has plus sizes now and the waist is too big for me and they’re leggings so they don’t have belt loops. Also forget about having stuff that shows off your arms because they look like skin and bones
People call me a stick lol 😂
all of this true even the dancing for some reason
im skinny and boy i can dance>:)
😭 I’m glad it’s not just me who experiences all this
My cousins always wore a coat like almost anywhere even in summer and now i know why lol.
BRO FOR REAL ABOUT LITERALLLLY EVERY SINGLE THING OF THIS (lmao can’t dance EITHER)
As a skinny person with Asian parents then my aunt,or grandparents come over they would ask “you’re so skinny here have more food.”
So fucking true
Its fine most people can't dance
It’s always the fucking belts
Same broooooo I cand do anything. Also I’m  lactose intolerant
The struggles 😭😭 I've had to use rope, clothespins, and strips of fabric to keep my pants up because everything falls down and belts dont work
thats some seggsy dancing
bro just explained my life in 50 seconds
Same
It’s the weird fish shark funny dance in the middle
As a young teenage girl that is 5’2” that weighs less than 95 pounds i can relate.
u dance better than me btw im ur biggest fan
Yup this is true.
the danceing
The dancing part is bs you know ballerinas have to be stick thin to even have a shot at becoming professionals
I don’t think you dance bad because You’re skinny I think you just don’t know how to dance😂❤
the problems are basically me
I agree
Number five is the worst especially from your family
Been there done that. I used to be 6'2"  and 126lb  and I ate like crazy but it never made a difference. But then I had kids haven't been able to get down to a healthy weight no matter what I try
#5 is literally my best friend 💀
Not a prob for me who is a 6 ft 15 yo weighing about 180 pounds
I not that skinny, but I’m a kid, and me and my Mom didn’t have time to find a black kids belt for my Orchestra concert, so we bought an adult one. And in a state of frustration, my Mom took a screwdriver and jabbed a hole in the belt. I still have the belt and still use it for Orchestra concerts. 😭
i used to wrap my hands around my wrists and degrade myself for being like this💀💀
Relatables
Bro, I relate to all of these as a skinny person. I'm very underweight. 😪
As a skinny person I can say that this is all true
When people think ur skinny but really ur just healthy-
Bro my uncle is so annoying because I would mind my business watching and he'd be like "Hey eat more look your so skinny!" LIKE DID YOU SEE MY BELLY I LOOK LIKE IM 7 MONTHS PREGNANT MY ARMS JUST DID NOT GROOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW BECAUSE I DO NOT LIFT YOU DUMMY
True
Relatable I mean I can see my bones like coming out 3 cms  See my viens  Weak 🙃 But I like it
"Your ass bones hurt" holy shit this is so facts
My siblings call used to call me a stick
Tbh that dance is way better compared to me who just move my hands only and not my hips
at school people say that “when you move it sounds like the Minecraft skeleton noise” I usually say nothing back because I was told not to. Also the ass bone thing is completely true and it’s horrible
i'm 13 when i was 8 someone said to me when i tripped over a pebble "your so skinny! even when there's no wind you get blown away!" i cried for the whole week after that
I'm a lil chunky, but hey, I can't dance either, I'd love to be your friend
As someone who has been underweight their entire life this is all true also people thinking the answer to gain weight is to just eat more
FRR SAME BROOO
As a skinny person this is all true. I can’t dance whatsoever.
its true but people are so picky your either to skinny or to fat thts just life…🙄
Im skinny and i can say this is all true
The fact that I am 10 and I weigh more than you
Better than me dancing
Nah bro I’m jealous of u bc I don’t like being bigger
YES
When u used to be skinny but people forced u to eat a ton so now u have an eating disorder and are overweight
i am also skinny as hell
Yeah I’m extremely skinny and my teachers have tried to call cps on my mom and also I’ve been called the holocaust victim
The sammeee whith freaking me
Girl. Stop. You can dance. Better than me
Hey, you can dance better than I can
Honestly only got these problems this last year my life been fat my whole life
Slim... not skinny
I felt the belt one on a personal level🥲
Ya I got to a healthy weight last year but I still have these problems   Edit  Also I'm 14 and my older brother always makes fun of my weight
When I was younger I was INSANELY SKINNY and people would always say "go eat a burger" and I always wanted to just be like: "I would but I might get addicted, like you. YOU FUCKIN WHALE"
Okay... we.. ehhmm.. for sure have to work on that dance skills 💅💃
I used to work at a factory where some of the time I had to crawl into each oven to clean it and mind you I'm skinny as well
Woman. You dance better than me.
my belts never fitted me so my mum had to make two holes -
i have never related to anything better
oh my gosh the belt thing is so true
Sit ups hurt like hell for me
im fat but i have literally every problem execpt the clothes problem
Hey lady, I'm overweight and sitting down hurts my butt too. 🤣
I’m not sure if just skinny ppl can’t dance I think it’s just u who can’t lol
As another skinny person, I relate to this
“Can’t dance” nah u just white
OMG THANK YOU FOR THIS!! as a skinny person, this is so true! i've had all those problems, and the rude comments are horrible!
Most of these things I thought just happened to everyone
I'm still like 10lb underweight to my height and weight ratio.... I cannot dance too yep
THANK YOU!!!!
Well if I'm gonna look hot I'm down for it anyway
you are lanky as shit
tf u mean cant dance? u killed it on the dance floor
Honestly with the belt one, just get a kids belt, they fit
I'm not even skinny just small and I can relate to the belt issues  like they should honestly put more holes on the belt
FAST METABOLISM GANG RISE UP!
I got skinny over covid and I feel the ribs thing. It hurts so much and I have no ass muscle and literally the boniest tailbone ever, lol.
You might be skinny but you are kickass cute!!
I can’t dance lol
I feel you're pain
Oh yes... "You're gonna break in half", "I'm scared to hug you, cos I might brake you", "you eat like a mouse", "your shoulders are SO bony, it's nasty", "You'll snap if you bend"... But when I pointed it out, it was all about how skinny shaming is not a thing. Right.
Being able to dance is not a matter of skill, but of confidance
learn how to be Michael Jackson
did that say 67 pounds? ARE YOU ONLY 67 POUNDS?!
If you ask me, I love your dance moves
im skinny af but the chair one wont affect me bc my ass is way too big
I’m sorry you had to put up with that, growing up we learn to not make comments towards fat people, but we’re never told to not make those same types of comments towards skinny people. I had a friend tell me that she always hated never being able to put on weight, and we’re told nowadays about people with “skinny privilege,” and fat acceptance movement people also always using skinny people as “examples” saying how no one calls them unhealthy, which is fucked up and bullshit, it’s just fucked up all around.
I was skinny as a child and I still slept on my stomach. Was it easy? Of course not. Luckily I had surprisingly meaty ribs.  Nowadays my problem is how outta pocket my boobs are getting
I can not tell you how many time people said I would break like a twig
Can confirm
I can confirm I fell asleep on the floor and I had multiple bruises on my chest my mom thought I was getting beat up at school she put me in therapy I'm still in therapy ;-;
People ask me why i keep moving around on my seat and like....my bones are hurting mu dude these chairs are raw wood i am bruising.
Honestly this sounds horrible
This is true
People be like: DO YOU EAT? then I consume three packs of chips, a burger and drink a 2l coca cola Also the people: WHERE ARE YOU PUTTING THAT?
I am God damm skinny that i am 35 kg in 12 years old
I almost got blown away by storm winds, almost being lifted off the ground. That's when I realised, this situation is more serious than I thought.
it's strange hearing the other end of body weight shaming and such, I grew up being bullied for being chubby, I'm not obese but I'm big enough lol. I feel for you though, hearing people's opinions on your body sucks everyone should just leave it alone no reason for it
You are a better dancer than anyone I have ever seen even with the Internet I see your videos every day and you are amazing and beautiful
I'm insecure so if I see a skinny person I always think "I wish I was that skinny.
All same
I’m so skinny I feel as though my skin is squeezing my insides. No one I’ve told believes me.
I can relate from the other side. Uncle had a favorite saying about me and my sibling - "you look like the cause of the famine, and you look like the result."
Constantly being in cold hits too personal ;-;
You can dance gurll
I can’t imagine..”O MY GOD DO YOU  EAT” I’d probably die if I won’t so LIKE SHUT UP LOOK AT YOU FAT PERSON LOSE SOME WIEGHT “at least I’m not a stick” …AT LEAST IM NOT A  GARBAGE  WHO EATS ALL THE FOOD
I'M SICK OF HEARING LITTLE PEOPLES LITTLE PROBLEMS! - God Of Rizz
Same problem I’m 72 pounds at as a teen
Saaaame
As a somewhat overweight person, I can't dance either
The fact that you are also really tall doesn’t help
why is this so relatable! :)
the belt thing got me 😭 i hate it sm
As a previous underweight small child number 5 to thems all fun and games till i was having to hold onto the porch to avoid being pushed down
You  made me laugh 🤣😂😆😄
I can relate to all of these except for the cold one, because I take after my dad in the fact we are living heaters
YOUR ONLY 66KG BRUH I AM 11 YEARS OLD AND IM 60KG
omg im so skinny and its my grandma that always says, "you dont eat enough" or "look how skinny you are"
Me being a skinny little twig and can do nothing about it I feel ALL THESE SO MUCH. I’m also so tall and skinny so yes the clothing sucked and I was always cold with my long az legs. AND WITH SITTING DOWN- I get ya Jayus
Only dance skinny people can do properly is boneless but even the you will most likely start flying
🤔Senior..... 135 lbs.... 6 ft.... male. .... but I needed to stay that way... distance running 🎽 🏃!!!!!! and I consumed EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE.
I am stick thin and today I was wearing my belt to the tightest it can go and it was still to loose. Also it has been June before and I can sit on the hot pad under a blanket and still feel cold
At least you can crouch on the bathroom counter like waluigi
Finally someone who understands my almost 2 disentangle butt bone pain
I love being skinny but it has a cost of not being able to lean in a chair because of my tailbone
As someone was was extremely skinny I mean like 125 soaking wet wearing a sweatshirt at 12 to someone now trying to lose weight to get under 175 i still can’t dance
Me who has been fat my whole life and cannot get skinny no matter what i do: 💀
Fat people look adorable when they dance
Says can’t dance yet dose some of the most amazing dance moves I’ve ever seen
the dance part is just you 😂
That's why I'm fat
I have the opposite problem, but I can't dance... for obvious reasons
I cant sit long either without pain or lay on my chest without pain but im not skinny. I just have a boney butt and a big chest.
Idk what you're talking about, that shit was amazing
is this dude trans?
Ok with all the colorful language and hostility it seems like you don’t like being skinny bud. It’s the way God made you. You’re beautiful, awesome and you rock, still a big dork though.
As a skin person this is so fing true
This is so true
as a skinny person, i can comfirm we break in half in the wind
Im actually glad I’m under weight, due to the fact I’m allergic to my own sweat. So being cold all the time helps me yk, not die.
Number 2 is very relatable
The dancing thing is a you problem
personally i think the moves are a 10/10
Omg jayus is only 66 pounds
I have a belt from the kids section in cal ranch and I still had to poke holes in it 💀
I am skinny and all of these are true... except the cold one I love cold weather.
I was once asked if I was a holocaust survivor because of how skinny I am.
Being fat is worse I struggle with my weight (I have heart problems) people will call you names it’s harder to run and when you eat people criticize you.
No, because why did they say that and then when we do they say go eat a salad 🥗
Hey, you’re still bad ass as a person keep pushing on you all. Love you.
it’s like no one understands I was fucking born like this I do eat burgers all the godamn time
As a chubby girl , I'm always cold, cant dance, and got told to lose weight when I was 12. So yeah
Me eats 1 French fry 🤰
I had to do sit ups for a PE test, on the basketball gym floor, and I got bruises on my spine
Ye so true I cannot dance
I think your dancing was pretty fly for a white girl.
On the other end of the scale and BOI do I empathize. People shouldn't be telling ANYONE, let alone kids, what they think of their body unsolicited. That shit causes lifelong issues with body image, self esteem, disordered eating... It's not okay.
Most of these are too relatable
I’m skinny and a VERY rapid eater. No one’s ever had to tell me twice that I need to eat, but I still have a weight of 43 kg and the anatomy of a Minecraft skeleton
good job ya in the weight also man fock them people that say oh you're to skinny like wtf but nice dance moves (i can't dance either :^:)
My mom would give my sister back massages but not me cause she i was so bony she could feel them- 🥹
Solution: Eat around 4 slices of cake
All those are super true but like fatphobia is much worse in America. No hate tho all of this is super true and valid 😅
Although I am also super skinny I do can dance really well
When I was little, I was not skinny but my best friend was! Guess who developed an ED based on the comments they got….      Jokes on you we both developed eating disorders but different ones. We both wanted to be like the other one.
Omg... Litterally understandable. It's not easy when you don't fit the social norm :/
As a fat person this kinda makes me feel better so thank u
Yes, just, yes.
I'm skinny due to illness. And yes, you bruise when you sit, lay down, turn over. It sucks!  I'd rather be fat again!
Bruh I relate to all of these!!
As a skinny person I can agree I have these problems a lot
Fax
I can completely relate to this!
I was shopping w my mom and this lady told the salesman that "I want a shirt in his size (pointing to me). But my son is a bit healthy, he's (me) a bit too...." I knew what she meant. She was indirectly calling me skinny while standing right besides me and pointing at me. This was years ago but I still remember it cuz its so fucked up. And now Im 16 n still skinny n people still tell me things like this n Im bruh I eat alot but I just dont grow. Its so fucked up to even JOKE about skininess. It never got to me Idc but some people get insecure and hurt 🤦
I’m skinny but I can still dance 😂
I was asked if I'm anorexic at age 9
the benefits of being skinny is that i look tall even tho i dont and i can fit in small spaces
SO RELATABLE THANK YOU FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS
I honestly wish I was skinny. I've been overweight almost my whole life
When I was a kid no matter how much I ate my family would still tell me to eat more and they don't really understand that it hurts as fuck
And you forgot the worst one of them watches ⌚😭
Anyone who CANNOT RELATE  👇
FAXXX I FEEL THE PAINNN
Im also skinny asf and i get all of that is true
Facts !!
im fat and i wish i was skinny
Im really skinny and all are fact except the last one 😃😃😃
...me and my mom are skinny asf BUT SHE CAN DANCE, meanwhile I look like a rotten potato
im skinny but im getting alot of blubber, i hope i can get heavier and bigger lol
I eat a lot and I’m skinny as fudge. They ask my why they see my wrist bones.. THEN I GET MY UMBRELLA AND IM CARRIED AWAY LIKE MARY FUCKING POPPINS (that actually happens I don’t leave the ground I just get dragged around
I'm very skinny but for ADHD reasons like my meds
Don’t tell me this is offensive bc it’s true and too relatable
I am insanely skinny too, every single one of these are true, yes, including the dancing one😅
As a 10 year old girl I can relate but I'm sorry to say I can RILLY dance...
I eat more than people I know that are way bigger than me like where does does that food go? Also I have the same problems
Oh I just have a problem when I eat one f*ching normal size serving I gain like 3 pounds and it’s so hard to work off
Well being skinny is better than being fat
The last one is just a white people problem
the last one is a you problme
I am so small. I get this. I'm 11 and I weigh 60lbs. Most of my friends weigh 100+
Same its so relateable except the rib part im only 10 and when i lay down i lay on my back and i swear danceing as a skinny person is torture.
excuse me I'm not sure if they said that right but $664 lb with the actual f***
Im hot all the time and i also get bruises on my ribs
ur dance should be a new trend on tiktok I bet it will blow up 😂
i related to literlitly all of those and it  SUCKS
THE BRUISES ON THE RIBS ARE SO ON POINT..ITS SCARY 🤭🤣
A lot of my belts didn’t really fit either bu them I got a hand-me-down skirt that came with a belt and that worked and then I got a skirt at hot topic that came with a bent that worked so I have 2 belts
So I know this sounds mean but the comments people told you are what I tell my sisters except my fluffy one because we both fluffy and the reason I do this is because the call me fat and chubby first and they know it pisses me off and I only do it when I didn't sleep at all that night
as a 78 pound 13 year old boy I can relate
I genuinely curious are the shoes you wear on the tabletop clean or your everyday shoes?
not going to lie she can dance better than me
I am skinny and relate to all of that
The last one is not just skinny people problems it’s people problems
As one of those people this is 💯 accurate
Shhh my belt goes right round twice ;)
Bro all that stuff I have had to live through
Every single one of these things are true :]
Thank you. Good god thank you.
Her: “skinny people can’t dance” Michael Jackson: “am I a joke to u?”
Even worse when you had to come to your mom and tell her "Hey it really hurts when you say that I'm a twig, or when you tell me how skinny I am when I've been working really hard to gain weight."   I fucking hate being skinny. Oh, and if you're gonna say "Would you rather be called fat?" no. But being called skinny hurts just as much!
Me not overly eating : Omg your so skinny you need to eat more!!!  Me when I eat more : Omg you look bloated are you okay?  Btw I completed related to ALL of this-
Am still skinny and this happens EVERYDAY is getting annoying 😒
hey really means I m a boy 6'3,age 17. I ate a lot to increase my weight from 62 to 64 in  a month and then lose it  to 61.7kg in 2 weeks and this sucks .
Can relate to the skinny part where people say "do you eat?" Or something like that, even my teachers would say it but it was only out of actual concern that they even asked my father about it so it was actual concern and not a tease. I didn't get bullied about it since other peeps in my class were also pretty skinny  but also have chubby peeps too.
My problem with jeans and poking holes to newly bought belt 🤣
I can grab my ribs.
Last one is just a skill issue, sorry Bella.
Omg this is so true people in my class would say stuff like I'm on drugs or anorexic
I'm not skinny and I can relate to all of these something is wrong with me
I wish I was skinny but I refuse to believe you weight that much
i dont care it should of been me!!
this is so accurate, people always telling me to eat more, and eat more vegetables, and it's kinda irritates me because i always eat more food and nothing even happens on my body, I'm still too skinny, i told them many times that i am eating too many foods and too many vegetables
I cAnT dAnCe   Don't worry jayus your not the only one
This is my life
Omg i can 100% relate
Just so you know you dance better than me
Because I am so skinny as well I feel like if someone grabs my arm they can just snap it in half 😂
Jay... stop complaining. You're a white rich person who has everything. We dont want to hear it.
Skinny people can’t dance                        Meanwhile Lisa:-EmOtioNAL dAMagE
Ok I thought I couldn’t dance because I’m white. Now you tell me it’s because I weigh 85lbs?
I get both hot and cold easily. No insulation and nothing protecting me from the heat of the sun. Then there's a heatwave in a drought and I'm the sun rn. (If you can't tell I'm in California)
No wonder I’m cold all the time! And any car ride over an hour has my ass hurting so badly
i'm really skinny and when i went climbing with my bro the instructor while helping put on the harness said this one needs a few more roast dinners and i was thinking wtf
I get bullied for being too skinny. I’ve been told I look sick 😭😭😭😭😭 I’m only 13 bro 😭😭😭😭😭
This is so true! Especially the belt one lol
Omg the poking wholes in the belt got to me 😭 ive had to do that so many times
I don't know anymore... I don't see anywhere an video about girls who had big breast and now they're thin af and it makes them insecure...
Yeah it’s pretty bad for me, I’m 185 cm and I weigh 150 kg. My family always says I should eat when I’m not hungry anymore.
I'm so skinny I decided to go to the gym  4 months later nothing changes
i know that + being 164cm fck
I LOVE YOUR DANCING!
LOL!😝
first i was to fat for my mom so now do sports and i have the same symptoms
Her I can't dance Also her dancing better than me when I'm not skinny
When I was little I was put on a pizza diet, it didn’t work
In middle school I knew this kid who was SUPER skinny, like the first time he didn’t wear super baggy sweat pant the entire class was stunned. Anyways, we used to make jokes about how skinny he was, but we only did this AFTER he said it was okay.  Don’t make jokes about peoples appearance, but if you really have to, ASK THEM FIRST Also, make sure it’s only light hearted joking and not bullying
Me and my sister are skinny too I’m a pretty good dancer in my case
Me still wanting to be skinny...
on the other hand. if you're mobidly obese, anything you do is brave and beautiful.
I know ur like skinny and all, but how did u get sooo tall?
Skinny people trying to dance looks like a gremlin mating ritual
The fact that she can dance better than me makes me look like a failure.
I’m skinny but short so it’s wierd
this is so true
hell yeah
WAIT SITTING DOESNT HURT SOME PEOPLES BUTTS?? MY LIFE IS A LIE
Bro fr 😭💀
Extremely relatable
So true I’m 13 and 85 pounds
As somebody who is very skinny, I can confirm, this is very true
Agreed
My gma went on a diet...... she gained 5 lbs.....   All she ate was baby food......
Me technically in middle school: *78 lbs* My mom with anorexia: *80 fucking lbs*   Okay so yay I’m not thyroid problems I’m just skinny 😂
Bella: I can’t dance when ur skinny   Me: I was never skinny I guess
Girl i got you I'm 11 and I'm 65 pounds
Ngl you look like Sebastian Bach
I used to be very skinny they told me to eat so now I do and they call me fat .💀 Like tf do u want to do then
Relatable So when i was like 11 or 12 i was 38-39 kg which i thought was normal till my parents told me to eat because  "the wind will blow you away"  which almost really happened😅 but still it wasn't nice hearing it from them
POV your parents are watching you do some random shit while blasting music
Anytime I ever tried to seriously dance or do athletic stuff I’ve always looked goofy af cause of how skinny I am. So I decided to just purposely look as stupid as possible everytime I do something like that to really sell it
yeah the ass bones thing is a big issue
If clothes don't fit skinny people or plus sized... Who are they for ffs. Every brand I know has apparently never heard of curves but my skinny friends are also out their fighting for clothes like what!?
still better than being bullied bc u re fat....
i eat alot of food, i can eat the whole fridge within a few days, but im still a toothpick, the only workout that i have is playing warzone on a controller
As a skinny guy I can say I’m skin and bones
"I can't dance"  Proceeds to bust an absolute move 🙌
Saaaame
Been skinny my whole life. It has its advantages. I can eat all day and night anything I desire and not gain an ounce lol.
I never was skiny but many people around me . But I actually don't understand why people are making fun of you if you are skinny or more build. Like wth in every way there's a problem.
I’m short and skinny 💀
😂😂😂 Please post more dance videos.
Having that shit said to me as a kid literally led to anorexia in some weird way. (I’m recovered).
when i was super skinny in 6th and 7th grade people would ask me if i eat anything like chicken or anything meat related and they NEVER believed me when i said yes
We go jim
Diagnosed aa super skinny when little Me now: fricking purberty brought curves. And now Im fat from all the carbs I eat lol
The whole ribs bruising from laying down sucks.. I’m not even that skinny or skinny enough to think I would be bothered by it but it’s very true..
Then dance moves were pretty sick though 😎😎
It's crazy how common every bit of this is the amount of people that have openly asked me if I have an eating disorder is insane (I just have an extremely high (metabolism)
I was a skinny healthy little girl. Everyone loved to point that out. How I could be a model. Now all of a sudden im to skinny because trends changed in big ass and fake boobs are in trend and id never ruin my body with surgery.
When I try to dance: Noticeably white
Don’t forget about the fingers around the wrist
So much people bullied me for being skinny. Then Wore a jacket for the entire year nobody bullied me
I’m over weight and I over heat easily
I'm fat as hell and no problems plus no one wants to kidnap me
When your average size and still have no ass. :(
“cant dance!!” *proceeds to buST A MOVE
My jean size in high school was 29-36.
There are belts with buckles that slide and lock I've had the same belt from 200 lb to 130 and it's pretty neat
I have the exact opposite problem 😑👍
Having been on both sides, I can honestly say,  it is just as hard to gain weight, as to lose.
FACTS THX YOU
I'm not skinny but I can relate. This is about your bone structure more than your fat content (we are talking about healthy fat content). And most of the chairs are terrible. If you are furnishing your home now, buy good chairs and table. Seriously this is something that is going to annoy shit out of you if they are uncomfortable..
Hyperthyroidism
Now they can't make fun of me if I'm fat 😃
Eat more fat
that dance made my day
After losing 130+lbs I've only JUST learned how uncomfortable it is to put weight on a bony area. I have it now when I sit down, leaning my weight in my elbows or wrists or when I sit cross legged at my ankle bones rub on the ground and that shit hurts. I've also jammed my chin on my collarbone cause they poke out so much and I'm very bendy.
Don’t blame your lack of skills on being skinny
OMG I CAN RELATE SOO MUCH cause I was 11 and my grandparents came over that weekend and I haven't seen them in a whole year and the first thing they said to me was your so skinny Rachel u need to eat more and I was like WHAT THE FUC- and I still remember that because it was so annoying and it wasn't like they said that I'm skinny one time it was multiple times And the fact that my mom didn't even care about what they said and how it affected me and then my aunt and their family came and they like kept on saying that I was too skinny and I could fly away with the wind and my OWN brother agreed to that like seriously... and it really affects me because practically I have been hearing that I'm skinny my whole life so if your one of those people who are like omg your so skinny go eat something then SHUT THE FUCK UP and STOP saying that it's really annoying to say that to someone
Fat people can't dance to!
It’s all true
I am also hella skinny and all of these are true
Can confirm that all are true issues, we ain't got no padding for sitting and laying down comfortably and I fucking hate the cold, my grandma used to force feed me in order to gain weight so I would get sick and puke A LOT, and I also can't dance, no meat to make the moves look more natural
I felt this in my soul!!!
Wait… you worked at six flags?
Thank you, so much. I feel so much better from heaeing you speak the truth for a skinny people such as myself.
Your dancing was okay
Bro whose been telling you you can't dance you can dance
As a skinny person, yeah we can't dance, but at least your able to try
As a very very fat person, I cannot confirm at all
Fr!!!!
Yeah there all pretty controversial topics     Except that last one
On the danceing; you tried
As a kid I was (and still am) very skinny, so my parents thought to just make me eat more, it just went to my stomach, nowhere else was effected size wise.
The bruises on the ribs though like it's real--
i like how people shame fat people and skinny people
Bro I am skinny as heck But the last point tho was relieving cuz I hate dancing
Same. I solved the pants problem when I found a belt that has holes all the way around.
Same, except... i can dance and i dont get cold (i inheritted some skandinavian genes :>)
Why are you wearing a bikini 😂
Why does this make me feel better about being chubby-
Bro i way as much as you and I'm 12
I think the last one is an every one problem
This was to true
Another thing people like to say/ask: do you have worms? As if they were talking to a stray cat or dog, who's been eating trash and rats.
Lol I'm fat and only 2 of those don't apply to me.
You can definitely dance! ⚡️⚡️⚡️
my family used to tell me to put some meat on my bones all the [_] time-
Heh, I have the same skinny people problems
At this point im not gonna be surprised if your videos start off by you talking and hanging from the roof
Idk abt you, but those dance moves prove that you can dance!    Just... Not very well...
When people wrap they’re hands around your wrist to TELL YOU how skinny you are smh
nahh I'm overweight, even most of in in the lower part of my body and the ass bones still be hurting when sitting😩
The belt was accuracy to utmost level 😭
I am also a verified twig person
I really feel the whole dancing situation
Don't dance Or I'm gonna die Ur skinny I'm fat Frack
You can still dance ten times better  then me and I’m not that skinny
I relate to all of these.
the first two problems are not just skinny person problems i struggle with it too
Omg I just thought I was cold blooded or sum shit
I have to tighten my belt so much to keep my pants up that my waist hurts.
Ahh yes! My friend told me I needed to eat more, and I felt like I had to start eating more and thought that I might weight very little for a ## year old  Btw, I found out I weight more than a normal ## year old lol
This was me till like 23
me: *drinks water* gains 4 kgs
Also when you lay back on hard floors your tailbone will start hurting
Uhh I didn't expect to be thankful to be a fatf*ck
Very relatable
I can confirm myself because I am a skinny boy
very sad.  you look fine.
Nana: eat something, your so skinny! Me:*gets hungry a hour after eating a entire pizza by myself*ahhhhhh!
Best dance moves ever I wanna ask you out
Suddenly im happy and fat 😍
This hit me on a personal level
Finally someone who gets it
Goofy ahh dance
Are you not flexible be flexible
i literally bring a blanket to school
As I skinny human I can confirm this. It is also very upsetting when someone goes "you SO skinny how are you insecure about your body?"
Society pushes people to be super skinny then tells them to eat a burger? I give up...
Same
For pants, especially when you have long legs compared to the rest of your body. To have the leg to fit, they’re slipping down, if you want the waist to fit, there’s a whole inch of unnecessary ankle
Bask in the radiance of my biological rib armor.
Facts except the cold part
So.... I can blame my lack of dance on being skinny? Nice!!
🧍
My brother is a FUCKING TWIG if he took a minuscule breath shirtless HIS SKUN BECOMES TRANSPARENT
Five and six still happen to me… I’m 16
You can dance, you just need to put a few hundred hours of practice in to look cool
66 lbs??????
I just go into working out and now my hips are exposed and laying on my bed is so painful
I love you 😘❤️
Nice moves dude
I am skinny and all of that happens to me how the fuck do I gain weight
Preach it
I'd be happy to deal.   Ure beautiful
“Laying down hurts my *ass bones* “ Lol
I’m late Ik but that happens to me all the time even a guy I liked once went around telling everyone he didn’t like me bc I was too skinny it was terrible and I cried for days
I don't change wait no matter how much or little I eat so ill stay at my 120
Does the dancing have to do with the low waght
Still better than being fat
What I got from this?   Send G dragon a bunch of blankets.
Add in height, wombo combo of suffering
I like the cold. The other stuff is right though. Except for the other people commenting on it, but that's probably because they don't notice because of my clothes. It's also a bit strange, cause i eat candy all throughout the day, and if I wore a step counter, it would have an embarrassingly low amount of digits per day.
I.am.6 foot 2 and 120 pounds, have never weighed more than 140 as a guy thats a twig. I also eat atleast 4 thousand calories a day. Gotta love thyroid problems
I’m not really skinny but fat brother is. He has a really HIGH metabolism [or low I can’t remember the one that makes is a cause for being skinny-] but he found your video very amusing and could confirm all of these [except the cold one this manz is ALWAYS in someone that’s probably 30 degrees mah man didn’t get a chance to be cold-]
My dad passed this down to me and all five of my siblings
🙄
Yeah I have the Same problem 😐
Jayus dancing is now my new Sleep paralysis demon 🥹
never have I been so offended by something I 110% agree with.
DaNsInG
The dancing one frrrr like we're so thin that our body just gets awkward to move and no matter what unless it's sm maybe like ballet we can't.
I was so skinny that when I was pregnant, I had to stand sideways lol just to see my belly getting big , and I had 5 children and my weight is 139
Yes regular people think it's a blessing nope a skinny people know it's a curse
Being skinny since I can remember the belt problem was the worst until I found nylon  belts that don't have holes they are basically 1 size fit all and just use tension at least mine does
Poor thing 🙄🙄🙄
being fat is worse because showering is fucking hell
Oh yeah we a team
Im skinny an if i take my belly in i can literally see my FRICKING RIBS...  I dont eat a lot,im just sometimes that hungry.And i dont even like eating that much.
It think the part about you not being able to dance is a skill issue, why, because micheal jackson.
I am skinny too
I'm fat and I have the same problems to
I was so taken aback when I saw you standing on your counter. Also yes, this is all correct.
After a lot of research of seeing this video🧫 I can confirm "she is skinny and can't dance"
Dude it drives me nuts when people say "well just eat that'll fix it" as if it's just that easy.
I’m fat so I don’t have that issue
Don't forget that eating a normal amount of food FUCKING HURTS
yuppp. I’m short and skinny for my age and the worst comment i’ve gotten is “Someone hold onto her she might blow away in the wind!” And everyone grabbed onto me. It didn’t feel great. (i’m 15) :)
Idk if id blame your dancing on your weight
That’s my hole life been told to eat 10 big honey buns a day
I wish I were skinny
Or “Omg I wish I was skinny to”  As much as it sounds like a compliment, it’s not.
You can dance just not that good
100/100 relatable
Nobody can dance properly unless you spend years to do that
So there is this twig of a person in my class, does not gain weight from all the candy he eats. If he was any lighter he could fly like a kite
YASSSS TO ALL OF IT! ESPECIALLY THE ASS BONES.
As a skinny person I can confirm that this is true
As a KID WITH ARMS THE WIDTH OF A WII REMOTE. This is fax.
As skinny I also comform everything here
I'm skinny. 170 sm and 49-50 kg (~ 5'7 and 108-110 lbs). It's not a disease or smth. I've been like this all my life. It's just quick metabolism. Belive me, I eat a lot and people even get confused how the heck am I still skinny. But every third person think it's okay to tell me smth like "you should eat more", "are you anorexic?", "boys like curvy girls", "boys are not dogs to react on bones" and etc. I used to be polite but sometimes I get really pissed of. It's hard to hold on and do not reply "well, then you obviously should eat less" or "fuck off"
As someone who is WAYY too skinny, I can confirm
Legit most if not all of my friends have told me something along the lines of “are you gonna blow away in the wind or something?” Or “bro a small breeze is gonna send you flying” Pretty messed up if you ask me
Okay, being the absolute polar opposite of skinny here are the pros and cons  Pros 1. You stay warm and don't need much to stay warm  2. If you ever are in a fight you have some weight behind blows  3. You somehow automatically make people laugh when you dance , no matter what, people will bust out laughing... it's either with you or at you    Cons  1. Moving a lot sucks  2. Very soft couches and big take a small degree in physics and a full course in momentum conservation  3. Living with other people in a small place makes it so you have to learn how to tetri block your way through   Now onto the weirder abilities you get from being fat  1. No matter what, you can always fit into places with a bit of elbow grease  2. Somehow your considered a lot more passive than most people  3. You have high impact resistance   Also I love your content
No idea why you said you can’t dance
I can confirm this as having been skinny until 8th grade
Me two
I FVCKIN SWEAR IM SKINNY AS HELL AND I CANT WEAR ANY PANTS WITHOUT LIKE A KIDS LARGE BELT LIKE WHAT THE ACTUALLY FVCK
Haha I’m super slender and my family thinks it’s a byproduct of the fact that constant stress is causing me to eat way less, but in reality even when I ate more than most people I was still super skinny. At least now I have some muscle, which remedies it to a light degree
Well I'm fat and I can't dance either. We stand together my friend
My own mother used to tell me I’m just skin and bones, even to this day my when I see my family they tell me I need to eat more
My natural BMI was like 17.3 from freshman year to 21, I'm finally up to 18.3 though so that's cool but now I feel chubby
Sounds like a white person problem 🤠
Bro I'm skinny af, like you can see the bones, even though I eat more than my mother she weighs like double me 💀
Nah you can dance perfectly fine
The one where she was dancing I try not to laugh so hard or break any of my bones
RELATABLE 💯
Imagine being fat and having no ass.  So I get your pain.
5,11 100lb that's me I have a problem with wind
I’m pretty skinny and all of these are very accurate.
as a skinny person all of these are true
I sued to be really skinny but now I ahev some belly fat and now I am a twig with a lump on my stomach
I can relate to this
THE 4TH AND 5TH ONE IS SO RELATABLE
I get made fun of for being skinny every day
Lol I used to be big and now I’m avrg but I still get like the sitting down and the belt thing now lol
I have actually put on like 40 pounds since meeting my husband so I dont quite fit these parameters anymore but before, I had so many jagged holes in my belts 😂😂
THE GETTING COLD THING ALLOW ME TO RANT- okay so all my friends think this is HILARIOUS because I'm the thinnest in our group, I'm five foot seven and 120 lbs, so there's not a whole lot there. I have a fast metabolism, so don't worry I am eating. Like a lot. BUT, all my friends, they laugh because it'll be 60 out, and I gotta go find a sweater, because I'm FREEZING. and then, they grab my hand and go "wow your so warm" YEAH BECAUSE ALL MY BODY HEAT IS ESCAPING MY BODY IT HAS NOWHERE TO GO TO HEAT ME All in jest, my friends love me anyway, this concludes my mini rant
I hate being skinny, it’s honestly completely my fault because i dont eat a lot but i still hate being skinny, why cant i be average weight for my age?
At least you can walk up the stairs without passing out 😔
Oh no, you're treated as a human and not a freak.
Just eat 4 burger and nothing
Same
I want to have these problems instead of having the WORST posture and having to crack my back every 10 minutes and I like being cold 😌
66 pounds???
Last one's just a you problem if you think about it I know a ton of people who can be skinny or have some meat on the bones and none of them can dance
I'm 40 still skinny and still waiting
My mother still comments man, and I’m getting cut at the gym too. She still doesn’t think I look right and has no idea that saying that is problematic. Maybe she’s jealous of my metabolism subconsciously
Thank you, someone said it
This is so true. I’m a teenage girl and I have a high metabolism and a small appetite. I was from 75 to 80 pounds at 11 years old and I just broke 100 pounds for the first time at the beginning of this year. I’m 13
Hey, at least climbing comes easy.
Oh my gosh thank you so much I am super skinny I’m 67 pounds and I’m in seventh grade by the way I love your channel keep up the great beds and I agree with you the comments are the worst
I am dealing with a chronic disease and have lost a lot of weight. I can relate now.
Im a skinny person, but im a healthy wright for a 15 y/o female  I just…cant put on visible weight. At all.
Sick moves
When my friend turn on camera
Lanky guy here. I feel your pain.
I am also skinny and they would always take my blanket and people use to make wierd comments aswell and they thought they were being nice like "omg i wish i was you!"  and it would seem if my parents were starving me  They would also say that im a skeleton and s*** i would cry mostly everyday bc of that s***
Congratson the weight. I feel the polar opposite of your pain.... Be as healthy as you can be and be content for what you do have... Blessings.
Lol
I’m fat,but society is always a problem
So I'm not technically at a "healthy weight" but I've been this way my whole life, I have a fast asf metabolism and I'm 5'2, I'm just not gonna get bigger than a certain weight. So I think this weight is healthy for me because it's the one my body always snaps back to now matter what I eat, I don't think I look bad at this weight and there's nothing I can really do about it anyway even if I wanted to plus the BMI scale is a little fucky because it doesn't take into consideration other factors why someone might be heavier/lighter and just immediately goes "Oh you're under/over this weight? YOU'RE UNHEALTHY, YOU'RE SICK YOU NEED TO FIX THAT." When that's not always the case
Bro I’m chubby and can’t dance either 😭
I've never seen a short identified with more than this
Being twiggy has nothing to do with your dancing ability. Everything else I get. The last part though nope.
You didn't look unhealthy in any of your old pics.
I relate to some of this stuff
Hmmm.....thought alot these problems were normal.
Looks like you can dance to me 😉
Ur moves better than mine 100%. get it!! XD
skinny is good 👌🏼
Listen being a fat person the insults people would tell me as a kid is way better than being told your skinny
Oh boo hoo, if I eat like a normal human being I gain weight until I switch back to keto. By the time I found the only diet that works for me I was a 120kg. My dad once told me I looked like I was wearing a life preserver underneath my clothes.
You can always make more holes in the belt you can never just make more belt
As a skinny can confirm
I would get asked if I had a Tapeworm.
" Do you even eat " No..... i do photosynthesis.
Being skinny isnt why you cant dance. It cuz your white.
As a skinny person I can confirm also we need to find out if all skinny people can dance replies here if you are a skinny person can you dance yes or no?
fuck i hate those problems
Can't relate I'm 5'6 and 85+kg
I'm  sry but why🤣 why did dance 💃 🤣ur so bad.
I feel you I am extremely skinny and people tell me to eat and I do but I don’t get fat
I have a gift that's a curse where I can't get FAT like BREH
When I was 6 I was nearly 100 pounds now that I’m older I’m build like a twig
Same scenarios
Me Also
Yep... 6' tall & a staggering 142 pounds. I feel your pain. I've never cleared 150 in my life.
I relate so fuckin much, especially mean comments They caused so many insecurities Im desperately wanna get gym pass for like 5 years (Im 17)
4 and 5 are tue mist spot on things ever said
I agree because I weigh 20 kgs and the grade for my rugby team is 36 kgs. And kids would call me a show pony when I asked they said because I'm fucking skinny. I don't get it
I cant dance. * Proceeds to dance *
You can f***in kill it on the dance floor. I can dance… kinda and I’m tall, skinny  and generally just a long boy too.
All the other things are true for me leaving the dance
A
I feel u
I think the dancing is just you😅,no offense
Skinny person gang!!!!
I'm skinny but with large boobs, so my ribs don't hurt. Also, I can sleep facing down with no prob, my chest even act as a cushion for me!  I hate them tho-
Last one sounds like a you problem
The first one was deep
The hell you talking about? You got better dance moves than me.
I can’t dance either and I’ve been skinny my whole life. This video is basically facts.
Cant dance has zero to do with being skinny
Cold?  Cuddle a man.
Espeacally 1, 4 and 5 are very relatable
That is the same thing I am going through right now
Same 😭 bro  can't lay on my stomach I will literally break a rib
120 lbs dude problem
At least you know how to dance.
Skinny people are "generally" considered to be more attractive however.       Unless they're so skinny they don't look healthy; like Holocaust survivor skinny. At which point it's VERY concerning.      On the attractiveness note though. I had a couple of buddies that were *barely* on the "healthy" side of Holocaust survivor skinny and they got way more female attention than my slightly overweight build...
SO true
As a skinny person, I’m offended, I’m a professional dancer…. The rest was relatable though
Hey fatty you need to lose some weight 🤣🤣🤣
You surely dance better than me… like WAY better
TRUE
I don’t use belts as anytime I go shopping for pants I always make sure they have that lace to tighten it
Bro I thought this was just me
I feel you on the ass bone one   It hurrrts
I have the same problem my ass hurts all the time when I sit and  my back hurts
I was skinny as fuck growing up.  I'm 6'6 had 39 inch arms and 39 inch arms. With a 32 inch waist. I feel your pain
I'm am 13 5'7 and skinny as fuck so yes I can agree plus I look autistic (no offense )when dancing
Your dance is better than mine
As I skinny person, I mop the dance floor and I leave no crumbs
This sounds just like me
I'm 2.1 meters and i weigh around 70 kilogram so sitting down for 5 minuten is a huge pain cause those seats are all go smalle for me
I feel this, but it's worse to have a build where people can't tell how underweight you are unless you're undressed. I was about 2/3 the weight I should have been. But because of my build, people only realized how thin I was if they saw me without a shirt on, because you could see the full arch of my rib cage from the front. e__e  I only say "worse" because... Literally dying and people are like "Oh, you're fine. You don't look like you're starving" when... Like, in a literal sense, yes. I was. :I
Not being able to dance is not a skinny problem it's a rhythm problem 🤦🏿‍♂️🤣🤣
As a fat person, I can confirm we suffer these too
4% body fat club 😎
So they bully fat and skinny people man just choose a  side
You are so beautiful. 99% of America would give anything to be you. But I feel your pain  and do not want to make light of your pain
I’d still think its better then being fat
Plus, you have to run around in the shower to get wet!?! 😂
As an overweight person, I still have all of these problems... Only I get incredibly hot very easily
no i think your dancing was amazing
Even if you get your pants to stay up, they are still too short.
Can confirm
I am 💅SkInNy💅 but i eat many foods in one sitting like i eat 3 apples,9 whole grapes,family size chips, whole bag of cookies and 1 whole chocolate,and full plastic bread and sandwhich,1 to 4 oranges but my weight is just 37 but i don't have that issues
When you were called the skeleton from minecraft in middle school
Best dance moves homi 🤩🤩🤩
I don't see what that last one has to do with being skinny.
as a 14 year old with 29kg weight, i can confirm i dont relate because i think i am not that skinny
Yeah they say that to me
Yeah realate almost every one says to me does your parents not feed you?
fast metabolism?
No matter how much I eat I never get fat     idk what it’s called I think maybe fast metabolism but not to sure
uhm- this but but but like 5'4/5'5
Casually stands on sink
I'm skinny but I'm also a runner so I've never had the pants problem but I do have the belt problem for when I need to wear a belt
Still dance better than me
I would totally go to a party with her
So true
As a skinny person I can agree cus in 7th grade I was called a stick bug
i am very skinny and this is factual af
I've actually found a special belt,I don't know how to explain it but it solve the holes problem
One of the things i got told as a kid was "stay near us u might fly and never come down
I feel that lol im tall to so i get called slender man only halloween costume thar works besides an enderman
I've had to put so many holes on belts I can't even count lol
I cant dance **PROCEEDS TO TRANCEND INTO MICHEAL JACKSON**
Hey those are some amazing dance moves 😂
As a fat person, stop complaining. 😒
Oh my gosh yes!  I am literally 13 years old and I get comments about my body ALL THE TIME. I remember once my aunt said to me “So here’s what I want you to do. When I leave I want you to eat 6 burgers a day”  The belt thing is also so relatable!
me too if gain five pounds and I get excited
Bro id eat like 10 pounds and lose 8 pounds
Yo same
You call THAT skinny? Holy
When I stretch I see my rib cage
Oh I also confirm I weigh less then 120 pounds and I am skinny asf so I can agree
Pls stop dancing I’m scared
I can definitely understand how hurtful those comments must have been. I’ve never been skinny, or fat. But I’ve never been small. I would love to be able to eat as much as I like without having to be conservative. 👌
Same problems as fat people💀
You need to take dance classes
MY BELTS DONT FIT 😂😂😂😂 I have the same problems
Im 11 an only 78 freeking pounds
Bruh people say that shit to me all the time lmao “bro do you just feed on oxygen or something?”
I hate it when people say go eat it's like I do but for some reason I can't stop being skinny
Every thing was on point
The amount of times I bumped my bones into tables ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Just because you can't dance doesn't mean it's from the skinny problems :/
don't worry, i cant dance either and i'm not considered skinny
I still think the worst part is the people making the circle with their fingers around your wrist
Omg it’s kind of sad that this relatable
you dance better than me-
Everybody has problems but to pretend like skinny problems are worse than fat problems get outta here
Yasssssss everyday with society and literally every thing else
Exactly
Literally me thank you lol
Me to!!!! But the rib thing is the worst I hate it and the comments.
Relatable
I can totally relate!!!!!
Loving the dancing can you tech me???
As a skinny person, confirmed.  5 was the most accurate, through all my childhood up until now (13 years) I have been called skinny and was told "oh my gosh, hold on tight, you're gonna fly away in the wind." It does not help that I live in Chicago AKA the WINDY CITY.  Then we get to now where anyone and everyone can pick me up we with surprise and ease, and it hurts both of us every time because theyre digging into my bones and my bones are stabbing them.   It's fun being 13 and 86 lbs./39 kilos
"Skinny people can't dance" Some kpop idols that was required to lose weight just so they can move/dance easily:
I feel that like my school called my parents because they thought my parents where starving me
I'm finally fat now! Three years ago, I gained, AND KEPT weight. I weigh 120 lbs, I am 50.
Is that why I dance like that?
I cant dance me seeing u dance me found dead
Im skinny to
Saaammeee I am 11 and people I don’t even know are like “ omg you can have the last piece because u need meat in your bones “
U can dance Because you are u
My mom thought my collarbone where hurting my chest so she gave me this medicine I was 8 and now I'm 11 and I found an medicine box on my grandmother nightstand and on the back of the box is the same medicine my mom gave me it was for chest pain 🙃 💔  thx to her I have no b00bs but now she is in heaven because of a stroke she left Aug 14 2020 messed up year if you ask me so uea thx 2020 for everything you ruined so yeah I'm skinny
I’m going into 6th grade and umm I’m 68 pounds yeah it sucks
"I can't dance!" *Proceeds to perfectly dance*
Ayo the pants not fitting and the belt to big that you need to poke holes in it is literally the story of my life.
YES
As a skinny person this is so relatable
As a slightly overweight person the first one I feel, I have no padding on my ass
i used to live on a food stamp diet and if yk yk that those food stamps dont last cause you get a small amout once a month and bc the food would run out qwick i would be starved for a while and my grandma used to call me “skinny minnie” cause i was insainly under weight ( dont worry i am now living some where where i do have food and i am a normal weight for my age)
I’m so glad I can relate. (FINALLY)
Yes it sucks
No offense but you really can’t do that no offense love you lol
I can't dance to save my life and this just reminded me that
Soooooo relatable ~ 5’10, 117lbs  Honestly the worst thing about being skinny is the stupid stuff ppl tell u
So true 🤣
As a 15 year old weighing 45 kg i can approve
Burh her clothes are reminding me of skinny all might the first time deck you saw all my in a skinny form my hero Fanbase actually refers to him as skinny Might
Really skinny yea people rude comment hurt and I can dance it has nothing to do with being skinny lol
Fr my mom always says “go eat a burger” or “go eat a sandwich” and I hate it sm
My parents don't know what a fast metabolism is so they tell me that people think that they don't feed me
ALL OF THIS IS TRUE  though I don't look good in belts  I RIDE FLOOPING HORSES And I can't Dance and but but and ribs hurt something when I lie down and sit
So true about the dancing
I’m pretty skinny and I can’t dance lol
Thank you!! I am a 14 year old boy and I weigh 90 lbs I'm in the fourth percentile for my weight.
I had to poke holes in my belt before (so relatable)
Same
I don’t wanna be skinny but I am skinny can you please help me 🥺
So relatable to me.
Bro I started overeating and vomiting alot because my own relatives said stuff like this to me 😃✋
I like your dance moves!!!!!
I don’t think the dancing is just a skinny problem I’m fat and I can’t dance 😂
Oh my gosh, so relatable 😂✋
Being skinny in the dance world has both helped me and not helped me, because I'm skinny and very flexible, it's easier for me to do certain moves and a lot easier for me to do partner work considering it doesn't strain my partner as much, however people's comments are the worst I've been asked if I'm anorexic or by a problems and no I don't I just happen to be skinny and then you get the bullying, so oh well you're not fat so you should be happy with your weight to any insecurities you have are invalid which is true, and it kind of sucks
Im so skinny and when i was 10 i was like 27 kg and EVERYONE laughed at me, even my family told me that they are scared that I'll disappear
Your dancing is at least better than mine
Lol my sisters have told me to eat a burger my whole life! Like there's some magical burger that will put 30 pds on after you eat it...
Omg the "do u eat" one is so relate able! Story time: so I do cheer well I was doing roundoff backhand spring and my shirt went up a bit and I was doing this in front of some other kids they said "Omg ur so skinny do u eat do ur parents feed u?" I said "yea..." BTW at this time I was 9
idk im not that skinny but my ass hurts when i sit and when i lay down like that it leaves bruises and a lot of my clothes r too big on the waist.
Agreed!!! I have the same problems 😂
as a fat person i can relate to some
No you cant dance sorry
I am skinny and those comments that people leave are messed tf up and I can confirm this video is true also I love your vids ❤️
I am skinny but yet I am an insanely good dancer so maybe it’s just a huge problem because I’m so good so maybe that’s just a you problem
I can’t dance either 💀
and u get bruises all along ur spine from sitting down
I uses to hate being super skinny as a kid, now i hate being over weight as an adult! 🙄
Strangers have been calling me string bean my whole life lol but they have diabetes
Omg, the butt bone pain when I sit too long, clothes NEVER fitting/pants never staying up, always being cold, and stupid "eat a hamburger" comments are all so TRUE 😂 Also, being skinny has made me a VIP member of the IBTC (Ittt Bitty T*tty Committee)
Well at least your not over Weight like me like it’s all the bad stares comments anxiety and stuff but in my opinion I think it’s a bit worse for fat people like you get bullied and unhealthy a bit worse and also you may be denied jobs and a lover as well as being treated differently and given small portions of food while looking at the kids that stare at you when you eat ):
This is so relatable, I’m so skinny for like no reason lol
Yeah my friend is extremely insecure about this and obsesses over it as well, so when people say " oh u need to eat more"  Me: u need to shut tf up and leave the alone, next time u feel the need to say something like this take a moment and think about if someone just pointed out your insecurity right now
I can’t dance either so I feel you lol
Being tall is just as much of a problem like just waking up out of bed and standing up too quick your blood pressure drops and you fall down. Sometimes you just can't win😏
Not like a fat person can dance better
The getting cold is the biggest truth
I know how she feels
why is this so true 😭😭😭
My sister is super skinny so wherever we go doesn’t matter what temperature she’s always cold
I always get comments on my slimness. My mom hates it when I do anything “sporty” cus she’s afraid I’m gonna break. Like, I’m skinny but my bones aren’t made out of flippin jello
Tall kid problems ( I'm not even that tall I'm 5'7 so idek )  " wow ur so tall , stop growing " " let's compare heights "  " omg do u play basketball " " u should play basketball " " how's the weather up there " " can u get that off the really high shelf for me youngster " ( like I'm an employee at the store tf
Everyone: “your kinda good at dancing”  Me: *crying from second hand embarrassment*
As a fat person I do not relate
Love you, but I think the dancing is on you.
My brother is 14 and is still small enough the wind almost picks him up and then I'm 15 and weigh 260 pounds the difference is insane and some people assume he's adopted because my mom and dad are fat too
I feel you and it’s annoying especially when sitting to long and it just hurts and having to wear a tighter belt just so your pants don’t fall
Not being able too dance isn't a skinny person thing Jay is just a you thing lmao
Bro I cant wear anything from jeens to skirts because I HAVE NO  FLIP-FLOPING HIPSS
I'd still rather be too skinny than too fat
I’m skinny too and literally I’m always hungry I eat 24 seven I never get any weight I get so cold so easily literally no one is like 100° outside I’m wearing a sweatshirt people are concerned about me bye but also when you’re skinny you can easily see your rib cage I could put my fingers underneath my rib cage it’s odd ok
Her being mad about being skinny. Me wishing I could be for years now
Bella: Skinny people can’t dance Kpop idols:  Gurl-
I feeeeel it soooo reaaaal!!
OMG YES
Ur still attractive ngl
Her “I can’t dance”  Me only about 2% of people can really dance
As a skinny person there is one thing you forgot our wrists are the same size as baby's wrists so all you bracelets fall of and you have to poke new holes into your watch
Being skinny has nothing to do with not being able to dance I was a 3xl (female) now down to a medium and still can't dance lol
My step dad makes jokes like "Don't blow away in the wind" to my little brother but he's ok with it cause he thinks it's funny and knows he joking.
My life 🥶😭🥺
Same
On the other side of the coin I was told she has such a pretty face🍑🍑🍑
So I'm skinny?  but I have face fat...
The dancing is cause your white
You're so brave love your videos and yes it is a shitty thing to say to a kid. I got the fat one not skinny ones but my close friend did...so unnecessary
What are you talking about you are great at dances
I lose strength easily when i don't eat enough. Like late for lunch due to work? My body starts to get instable
Yeah
The regular belts are SO LONG? THEY GO 2 TIMES AROUND ME EASILY.
My belt goes around my waist 1.5 times and more. I walk around w autmn and winter jackets in summer! "What do you dO in winter?!" 'Uuuhm being scared that i freeze to death on my way home?"
SAAAAME! Worrying skinnyyyy!
As a skinny person, I can confirm.
YEAH MY FAMILY HAS BEEN LIKE “aw you need more meat on your bones” SINCE I WAS BORN-    now I either over eat or starve myself
I'm the opposite of skinny and I can't dance lol
Her: I CAN'T DANCE   Also her 2 seconds later:  *does the best and elegant dance to exist in the world*
You can dance better than me that’s all I’m going to say
Im normal size, but I get bruzez (idk how to spell this) and need to poke holes in belts, and can not dance lol.
I feel you I am like you and I’m still not a healthy weight
"ur literally a bone do u even eat wtf" *_how else am i alive?_*
I don't think not being able to dance is a skinny person problem I just think it's just a u problem
I well WAS but all of that was true and I finally got a bit fatter but I still was to get skinny but I was 8 and weighed 65 pounds and again all that is TRUEEEE
Me dancing be like…
I understand I am 70 pounds and I hit so cold I understand you
I'm tired of people talking about me
Bro i was really skinny when I was a kid like really skinny because I didn't like a lot of food but that is so true
So is this why I can’t dance….?—
Go eat a burger, Go to the gym, No on should have to go through that people don't realise how much it hurts
I sooooo feeeeeel youuu!!!!!! Also, just because some people are skinny, that doesn't mean that we can't throw a punch on your face and break your teeth
Nothing fits AND THE COLD!!!
RELATABLE 😭😭😭😭
THAT IS SOO TRUE!!! I'm only 12 and I suffer of this and my dada says those thing and no we CANT dance and my friends make fun of me for that and I always where hoodies so in the summer they call me noodle arms
I haven the same problem
NO, ITS THE FINGER ARROUND THE WRIST IN PUBLIC
The can’t dancing one isn’t cause you’re skinny. That’s cuz you’re white
Damn, who said you can't dance? Also being a short skinny humanoid-I think- I completely agree with all of these. Those comments ruined my childhood.
I can’t dance   Pulls out the best chad dance moves on the fucking earth
Them moves fresh no cap 🧢
Sitting down do hurt af
“yOur sO LuCkY yOur SkiNNy..” stfu rebecca
Skinny People Can't Dance Wonyoung: baby I m not even here I m  a hallucination      People it's a joke don't attack me I m not body shaming it's a god damm 🤣 joke k.
The judgy aunts when I enter my village: "YES THATS OUR TOPIC"
Me a skinny person: ah yes society is horrible and bruises on my ribs is the WORST
I can’t dance lol 😝 ur belt dosent fit poor u idc
I still wish I was skinny
my toes fr get cold so fast bro 😭😭😭
Its actually easier to dance when you're skinny, esp with ballet dancers, moves look so much better
I was in dance academy for a year (Ik it’s not a long time) and still is horrible at dancing by horrible I mean like horrible you’ll literally 🤮
I didn't realize laying like that is why my ribs hurt😭 this actually helps so much, I'm gonna have to stop laying like that now, I honestly thought there was something wrong with me, I lay like that so much and it hurts to touch my ribs, I thought it was from riding horses
You call 64.4 a healthy weight girl I weighed that when I was like 6 no hate just be careful I wud be so sad if you got sick
I've always been in the 90s to early 100s when it comes to my weight. I never gain above 103 it's either 98 lbs or 103 there is no in-between and it fluctuates heavily. I can eat and eat and eat and still never gain a lot of weight. Meanwhile, everyone around me is gaining up to 200 lbs or so. Being skinny sucks especially when you had an eating disorder growing up because of depression and stress. Society has hacks and solutions for obesity. But when it comes to those who are very skinny, they shame us and don't give solutions for us to gain weight. The double standard is very sad
Being extremely underweight these are all actual problems and I scarred easily
My problem is if ur to skinny its "omg have ever touched food??" But if ur like me its "Damn go take a run or ten no wonder you dont shop in the kids isle" Me being an overweight person so that's all confirmed
Pretty sure the dancing thing comes with being white
Hey I'm fat and I can't dance
FUDGING. FACTS.
Omg that what ppl tell me
We all have problems being skinny
SSAAMMEE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg. Finally found someone who knows my probleme. I get cold when its 39 celsius. And indeed I always got told as a kid that I was very skinny (when I was 8 till I was 10 I was 24 kg)
I have the exact opposite problem and I am so fucking jealous of you. I would absolutely kill to look like you. I would take all of these problems to the max if I could look like you you are so fucking pretty I want to be u why am I not you. I have similar problems like you always being cold I’m always like really hot because I suck at cooling myself down. I’m 15 and I weigh 65 kg so I think you can infer that I am the opposite of you
Sooo true but the last one I can do
All of that is so true I need like 5 blankets even in the summer and almost every family member that I have asks if I eat
I am still growing and i’m going into sixth grade and the comments are almost exactly like you said my nickname is flat pancake I am 5 foot four I’ve been 5 foot four since I was in third grade and I can’t dance either I look like a stick trying to dance and then like. And I get so many bruises and then I don’t like showing my back because every time I bend over everybody sees my spine and even when I’m standing up by the way I’m 5 foot four and I am 65 pounds.
I think we're twins
As a skinny person this is all true. NO MATTER HOW MUCH I EAT, THE MOST WEIGHT I WILL GAIN IS TWO POUNDS. Hey it doesn’t have to be pretty, it’s still dancing
As a skinny person myself, this is all so true
Beautiful dancing and I know I have a skinny sister
Same girl
when i was a kid i was underweight and my parents had to ‘fatten’ me up and now i feel too fat. i really don’t know if i am but i want to go back to being underweight.
As a skinny person I can totally relate 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ The worst thing is that every time I meet a new person I hear the same question: Do you eat??... And I laugh awkwardly or say yes... But what the heck do these people think?? That we survive by eating ants?? They know the answer so why do they keep asking?? We eat and we're completely healthy! So just don't body shame ussss!!!
Don’t lie about your dancing that was better than anyone I’ve ever seen
You would have hated living with my Italian family.... They would have told you to eat more every dam day like they were waiting for the next famine to come.
" OMg do you not eat?! " " Ew look at her/his bones" " Attencionseeker! You just want people to compliment how skinny you are" " wow my three fingers are as thick as your arm"   Thx, we dont need those comments, being skinny can be just as hard as being overweight. We are all human.
I hate when people are like go eat some food with fat on it and I don't like fat
Well your pretty lucky compared to me i’m very very fat
I don’t want to be that skinny but I fucking want to be skinny also I am glad your in a healthy weight but I hope you get better
Same here same here
I am very underweight, like if I take my shirt off you can clearly see my ribs, like 70lbs or smth, and it physically hurts to lay down at all, ive gotten used to it but, Side: skin caves in between rib and pelvis Back: skin caves in on stomach Front: mah t!ts hurt (afab) Also carring anything hurts everything  And people comments.. "Oh I forgot, you don't eat. You weigh like 10lbs." "You can have as many cookies as you want bc you can afford it." "Im so fat"-when they are like average "Do you even eat??"  Sorry for the vent-ish thing, felt it was cool to put here and get it off my chest.
So true, as a skinny person 🗿
I felt that "do you even eat??" "go eat a burger "
I’m skinny too 😢
I hate the being cold 24-7
Yah
I'm super skinny, and I lit get reminded everyday, once even the my own DOCTOR started making fun of my weight 🙄🥲
I wish I could make a fat people version.
I can relate, I weigh just as much as a 4th grader
My Aunt is smaller than you
Yes
“Oh your pants are falling down” I-I very much understand
So true when i would sit on my parents lap when i was little they would tell me to get off after like three minutes
Jayus at the end : ✨~dancing~✨ Me : YASSSS GET IT JAYUS PERIOD
"I can't dance" Well now ya do
dude i was once running and someone said “no don’t run ur twig legs will snap!”
I feel you I'm skinny as well when I was a kid these grown men would be like "I think your gonna fly away in the wind!"
It's so relatable 😪
I am skinny and I eat a lot and I’m still skinny so these are all true
You only weigh 3 kg more than me I’m 13 I think I’m a bit tubby now lol 😂
skinny people can dance they just dont look good
I struggled with this stuff my whole life
FINALLY! Someone with the same problems as me 😭
BRO IDK IF I HAVE SEEN BETTER MOVES LIKE, DAAAAAMN SHAWTY    Ok I have a joke up my sleeve  Do you know which is my favourite tea, it’s you shawTEA . It’s a lil cringe lol
You look great and healthy... You are simply tall and  slim. That's best thing, enjoy it and don't listen what ppl bullshit
You can dance
I can relate to all of these
Haha I'm also skinny I have ur same problems 😂
I’m only nine and Heavier than you and I have so many insecurities
Wait... am I skinny? ALSO ALSO, BABES YOUR DANCING LEGIT LOOKS LIKE ME AND HAD ME CRYING OM THE FLOOR 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
I’m as skinny at you I got all your problems to I can’t dance  either
I never realized that you were skinny 😐
I'm all skin and bones you should watch my figure skate trying to look elegant
Um chuncy people
Skinny people problems yea I’m skinny as fuck
I’m very skinny too
If someone told me to eat a burger, id tell them the truth. I throw up after eating burgers specifically
I’m a skinny human a boy and I agree but I think a skinny boy is worse than a skinny boy a boy you wanna an buff
I used to be really skinny but now I'm more on the overweight side and I was never able to sustain a good weight I can't be a good weight I'm always too skinny or too f@t
Your better at dancing then I’ll ever be.
Yes
"I can't  dance"  ...  Yeah I don't  think that comes with being skinny because I am not and I can't  dance so...🥲
That is so true especially the cold on it was 87 degrees I was in 15 blankets shivering
I am skinny and I eat junk food so fucking much and I never get fat 😑😑😑. This is facts
Better at dancing than I thought
They say eat a burger like if she ate a burger she was magically going to be the size that wanted stupid people.
I found my dance twin! Lol yesss 😊
The dance I cant
Same but I’m tall so I’m healthy weight but I lose it a lot
You: "I can't dance!" Me: "you sure?😏😏😏" Awesome dance moves!🤩🤩🔥🔥
Biological fact but you being cold easily also has to do with you being a woman. Women body in average is lower than a man's up to an extreme of 4 degrees Fahrenheit. There's one for women's problem men usually don't know about.
As a skinny person the dancing thing is just you. But we still look wierd even when we dance proper
This is so relatable, especially laying down or sitting
I LIKE THE DANCING
Yes, the pants problem, I'll find the right size, but not long enough, or the opposite, long but to big
Yes I'm very skinny too and it's the worst wearing a bathing suit and people can see your spine
IF i saw u at a party and u would dance i would laugh my ass of😂😂😂
I can relate to that😂💀
Tbh I dance like that 😂
I wish I was skinny, ive been over weight since the age of 7 😅
4&5 are way too fucking real. As a kid no belts fit and those comments.
As a plus sized person I have the same problem with the clothing….I’m active for a second and my pants fall     And the dancing
skinny cant dance 😣 kpop idols 😦
I can’t agree more. IM SKINNY TOO 😅🥲🥲
Saaaammmmeeee!!!
I also can confirm that it's true
Dude, that shit for real. I get it all the time!!!
Nobody :      That one person: 💃🕺💅💅 me like girll ur better than me I dance and fell at school and almost killed me self
I have literally been accused of drugs just because I have a fast metabolism.... I'm so poor it's like, drugs??? How the hell am I gonna afford drugs??? Hahaha 😂 Jesus I would sell the drugs sis, so I can pay my light bill on time 🤣🙄 seriously
Haha I have been chubby all my live. Suffering from epilepsy. Drinking pills to keep me alive. You know how I see my chubby ass. You mess with me. I get you on the ground. I will sit on you, and you will die. 🤣😂🤣😂.
I agree bc I am skinny
Same
Girl you were dancing
Bella: I cant dance. 2 seconds later does some killer moves
As a not skinny Person i cant relate to that but i have a skinny friend who Always tells me Stories about being skinnyshamed so i try to build her up
Me as a not skinny person, I can't dance either lol
My grandpa always told me to eat meat but I have a hard time finding meat I do like my brother says iM a VeGaTaRiAn but I hate vegetables
My parents say that I am a stick
think u cant dance not cuz ur skinny but mabey also cuz ur quite abnormally tall cuz when u dance u gota use levels (commin from 1 tall 2) if u dont use levels its just weird lookin n 4 sum tall thats quite hard
What I’m like the same weight as u when u were as young as me and this weight looks rlly common I think u should see real SKINNY  ppl
I just think that every basic white person just can't dance like me
Nah you can dance better that elzis
Bro I feel ya, I’ve been skinny my whole damn life, it’s hard, I especially get the being cold all the time and the comments about being skinny
She is just vibing
Wdym you can’t dance🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😜😜
I went through the same thing
Her:dancing weired Me:standing there not even trying
People are always like go eat something and I’m like freaking do I would be dead if I didnt
Bro people be like: being skinny means your luck . BRO ITS A FRIGGEN CURSE BEING SKINNY
Growing up I'm used to people telling me to lose weight on a daily basis, I honestly didn't know skinny people had problems as well
Omgg same
I’m skinny and everyone makes fun of me because of this but I’m so skinny that my hip is bigger than my torso
This is so true
This is me
another thing when you lay down, when you get back up it gets hard to breathe 🥲
My butt goes numb from sitting down for 15min
I’m a skinny  person and all these problems are a huge part of my life
Lol
Her : 66 pounds Me : 78 as an 11 year old and everyone thinking I’m skinny AF
I can't even drink water with ice without freezing to death so even in  the summer I all ways have a sweatshirt on me.
Then there are those friends that you tell how people were being rude about how skinny you are and they are like “WhAt Do YoU MeAn PeOpLe liKe Me wOuLd kiLl fOr YoUr BoDy😩” and they say that to make you feel “better”
I think those dance moves were amazing
I umm same😭🐸
A lot of my relatives say “Do YoU eAt YoU nEeD tO eAt MoRe MeAt” Listen I may be very FREAKING skinny but I’m a kid. It makes me feel bad about myself. Stop staying stuff like this to people
Omg yes! This had been my entire life.
Or when people say “Omg your so skinny, you should be happy I would love to be as skinny as you” 🙄
So true
God and Jesus love you..
Fr this video is my entire life
As a skinny person I confirm this is true
As a skinny person, I can definitely confirm. Sometimes I would even have to buy clothes 2 ages down for them to fit😂😂😂
As a skinny human. I can confirm. I slept with the fan on last night and I had to have like 4 blankets before I was even SORTA warm 😂
U can dance better then so that works ☺️
The dance is just u
At least you dance better than me 💀
I am also Skinny but i croked rib so so cant even Lay Down on a hard surface
I think the dance thing is just you. I am really skinny and everything is same for me except to dancing
Ok I have to say that you have got all of that right! And my mom is always like go eat and I whould eat so much and gain NOTHING!
As a skinny person, my classmate once said when I jumped, they thought my legs were just gonna snap 😂
5 ppl  say that to me like do they have a life
I’m a chunky person and I still don’t know how to dance
The last one was just white people
All frickin relatable
The belt hit hard-
Everyone have been telling me this for my freaking entire life (10yo) and I was like my weight is moderate now I belive I am skinny but it's just because I am tall    5'3 and I am 10
Skinny legends comment e here 👇
Im skinny and I can dance
Same
Its sad to say but people say that to me.
Why does jayus sound like a 13 year old who got permission to swear for the first time
When I was 9 before I “developed” people said I  had a little boy body but with long hair
The dance part made me laugh my ass of
I'm proud to say you can dance better than me
omg it’s so great to be able to relate to someone, even in the comment section!! my dads side is naturally very skinny and even say i eat lots and lots of food im not going to gain that much weight, i guess im forever going to be skinny. my dad even had to poke holes with the drill into my belt for school and it was annoying and had been for quite a while 🤦‍♀️. it also annoys me when people are like, say there like, “omg your so skinny” but if u say “omg your so fat” or “overweight” that’s body shaming. it goes both ways. (also if ur tall people automatically think your gonna be good at basketball fyi i wish so.)
Me being skinny I can confirm
You dance like Ellen
Yeah, I'm 194 and 70kg.... I is stik
Lol so true
You just explained my life
I am 11 i am 1,50 my firends are  1,71 and that stfu and  every one say omgkid do you eat ear more imean i cantttt if i coud  eat i whoud soo bru i have 33 kilograms  soooo bru
You're really good at dancing actually
That's me I'm skinnier than a stik
Very much truee, It’s an everyday thing 😁
I feel all of this pain😭😭😭 The society part is the worst... I guess? BUT BEING SKINNY IS THE REASON I GET TO WEAR OVERSIZED HOODIES!!! MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!!!
yeah i’ve been skinny my whole life and people are always telling me to eat more … like i eat so much but i can’t gain weight 😭 skinny shaming is a thing people
People say to me I'm a skinny rat and a skinny as a pipe
Try to be a fat person 💀
AGREE
Me growing up, I a little skinnier than the average person. I was told to eat a crazy big meal for a week when I was younger. It’s messed up.
I was thin like that too until I get into my forties
It’s called high ass metabolism
Not to mention the amount of times people remind you of how skinny you are - like yeah, iv noticed!!!
I'm fat as hell and still get cold :(
I am fat. like fat, fat. All my fat is on the stomach which means not only do I have the worst kind of fat, my ass hurts too.
This is too relateable, I'm built like a twig💀💀💀💀
I am the same
💯yup so true it hurts.
As a skinny person who literally CAN NOT gain weight no matter how hard I try I fully agree with the comment one whenever ppl say stuff like "ur just skin and bones" or "ur arms look like twigs" idk if they mean it as a compliment but it hurts
as a skinny kid, I confirm, it feels like its 40° but its 90° dam degrees outside,also im half vegetarian whatever you call it/
people always say that i look like a walking stick when i “confidently” wear a tank top 😬
I can't dance
Me eats a whole thanksgiving dinner: My body: I didn't take anything from that
i can confirm this is correct
Nah you got some fire moves
That dancing was sick
I would rather be skinny than what i am now lol.  At least i wouldnt be uncomfortable going to the beach.
Personally I'm chubby but we have some of the same problems
Same
I can dance so do I look I mean am I um wtf is going on here
Yes! I can confirm all of this is true 😌🙂😐🫤🙁
Fat people can’t dance. The only good dancers are the people in the small margin inbetween
True
Same here
This is relatable as a skinny person😀
Dam , same
Her: I can't dance ( dancing her heart out but doesent seem like she cares about OTHER ppls opinion ) Me: cheering her up
i love your dance moves
I feel this😂
My sis confirms people always saying it to her
That’s true I’m skinny
It is true
Well there's people that are chubby that have a lot more problems-....
I’m skinny and all those things besides the rib bruises happen to me. Even though I eat more than enough im still skinny and my friends have a nickname for me called “stick” I don’t take offence I actually find it funny but these are true skinny problems
Those dance moves are Hella good lmao
I cant dance either so your not alone
So relatable 😢
Felt that- but I’m a dancer
Yay were the same too   (IN VERY FUCKING SKINNY
I am unfortunately skinny to I know how it feels idk if it bc I the youngest in my class but either which way I hate it especially when it comes to clothes
I’m short af like very short
The Dance ring made me laugh my ass off
UHM. YOU SLAY AT DANCING
So true
I am a skinny person, all these are facts! ( not including the cant dance one ) We Can Dance!!!!
Gurl weigh less than me 🔫
I got an adjustable belt... With no holes. Fits like a glove. Only downside is I walk around with a union jack buckle constantly, if that even is a downside lol
Exactly
Lol when u were dancing I were rocking it it's so funny how ur like AYYYYYYYYYY DANCEEEE IT BOIII
ha ha imagine to be skinny. I to much like eating to be skinny
I once dated a girl as skinny as Jayus who was about 5'4" and I'm not exaggerating when I say she could eat as much or more than me, a 6'1" 225 pound (at the time) man. She once ate an entire 40-piece McNugget bucket by herself as we drove to a friend's place about an hour away. It was so impressive.
As a skinny lil boy i can confirm this shit happens
I went to being very skinny to being very fat
I feel that I have been constantly under weight and just finally got to a healthier body
Lol I’m skinnier then you 😭
I’ve never related to a video so much before
66 pounds?
I WILL PAY YOU NOT TO DANCE
I'm skinnier than skinny, I can suck my stomach into like an inch and a half
Love your fit when your in the mirror and I LOVE the way your hair looks I want my hair like that but not like a Karen cut or a Dora cut just something short yk
I don’t think anyone can dance, they just go by instinct
Ones tht hit the most: Cold instantly            & ADD MORE HOLES TO YOUR BELT!!!!
Nah bro your dance moves slayed
Damn U curse alot
What did her scale say?
Omg!!! Yes!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Being very skinny is better than really fat right?
Agreed I am 13 and I am 67 pounds
This is so true you can see my ribs threw my clothes.
I’m the opposite and I never get cold I can lay down for about as long as I want but I can’t run and I also can’t dance
Those dance moves be bomb tho ngl
The most upsetting comment I’ve had said to me was “ do you get abused? Or do you hav that mental problem where you gain no weight?!” Don’t ever say that to a skinny person
Ok accurate facts but like who said obese people could dance?
Same
The fact this is true scares me
See you in the exact same but I can dance because I dance like competitive dance
I feel the exact same way
True us SKINNY people 😂 we honestly CANT dance & for other skinny people there butts hurt after they sit it for like 20 seconds it hurts but for me it’s just become numb AF like as a kid I had a couple belts that my mom had to punch holes into them, like the “do you eat???!!” Question is like my mom telling people who ask that says “oh yeah she eats a lot🍔🌮🌯🥗🥓🍖🍟🍕🍝🥟” 🤣🤣.
Yep that's true im very skinny and thats true Im sitting rn and its hurts badly 🥲
Omg it’s so bad just how much I relate.
As a skinny person car rides are the worst
R the first 4 not normal
People are so toxic like we need people in this world who will make us feel better
When you cant dance because your to socially awkward
Girl I am fat af and I can’t dance
Bro I am sooo underweight so yes this is all true
as someone who is a stick this is really true
As a skinny person I also confers
So relatable
I have all of those problems
This is so accurate 🥲
Yes and your beautiful in a non creepy way 😂❤️
My dad says he needs to hold me so I don’t fly away in the wind
Facts tho😭
I’m sorry I laughed at your dancing but I couldn’t help it 💃🏽🤣🤣🤣
This is so true! People always think I'm not eating and they are just mean.
Actually I know a dance that you would be really good at..
Girl I feel u
This is so true I feel you
My mom started to SAY "ur gonna d¡€ if u dont eat", IT started 4 Years ago, AND like in 15 days or something im turning 11, so im 120 months
As a *skinny* person, can confirm
BRO same
Wait, did u just used kilograms over pounds?
Hah… I’m the total opposite  a swing squishes my ass too much
I kmow your pain
That’s me there in a party
Bro jay is 66 pounds
Just workout 💪
The dancing was funny I can’t really dance either all I do is basically just stuff a bunch of TickTock dances into my head and do them all at once it looks terrible 🥲
I feel you
FR
100% percent true xD readable
I can teach you too dance
Bruh I was fat asf and 140 pounds at 12    Yes I’m aware I was over weight.
Neither can I sister 😆
Better than being fat lmao
Finally someone understands meee
I love your dancing
I’m skinny too and often time i’d get called a twig and other things. I know it’s meant as a joke but still it’s not something I like to be called. I can’t dance either though and I thought it was just me but I look awkward doing anything because of how skinny I am.
I am super skinny to
Confirmed. Everybody keeps telling me to get fatter cuz no clothes fit and my dad forces me to eat and compares me to my healthy friend like YOU DO WANT ME DO ABANDON ME AND ADOPT HER SHE'S A PERFECT DAUGHTER
I totally agree
as a skinny person the male option is always, like, overly buff, and i have to explain why i chose the woman option to be more skinny
Just stop stop just stop dancing
I can’t do sit-ups without my spine and tailbone digging into the gym floor 😂
"that shits fucked up to say to a kid" So I was rlly skinny when I was a kid and they used to say "do u eat?" "I'm scared you'll disappear" (even my family and relatives used to say it)       Edit: GUYS TYSM THIS IS THE MOST LIKES IVE EVEE GOTTEN! 266 CANT BELIVE IT! AAAAAAA LOVE YALL
#relatable ☹
I can’t dance
Did that scale say 66 lbs. I mean good job getting to a healthy weight but I feel like that’s still very skinny  Edit: my brother is skinny and he has gained about 10 lbs or so in a few months while not really trying, just eat a lot and I mean A LOT more food
OK maybe the dancing one is right but umm maybe just for me and you
WHY WHERE U ON A SINK
Not me be a real life SkElToN 😡👹👺👿
Fun fact about burgers  If you eat the materials you make it with split up it's healthy   If you combine them it's unhealthy
The only dancer my dad does is slow dancing
Oh well that  your probable
I have always had these problems too though so glad im not the only one.... I'm like 6 foot and weight 115 and I am 15
Her: I’m so skinny! Me: damn ur lucky I eat my whole fridge
I actually relate to this because i weigh very little for my age and people tease me for it all the time and it gets really annoying
That is the rest dancing I have ever seen
I can confirm this
I’m rlly underweight and I always have people either call me cute, laugh and call me tiny (LIKE I DONT FUCKING KNOW?!) or they just tell me to grow and eat shit or whatever tf think makes me grow. I’m not capable of just eating a steak and growing 6 feet taller like you expect.. 💀🥲
Also I was so skinny as a kid whenever there was a strong wind I almost flew away, and when ever I didn't eat my whole plate people would confront me and say your skin eat more food!
Bella’s dancing is better than mines😂😭
I can confirm
This is me, my grandma tells me “Why are you wrapped up in a blanket?” My mom and dad” we’re used to it” me” I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING I CANT GET MEAT ON MY BONES THIS BLANKET IS MY ONLY INSULATION
Facts that is my daily life
I have the same problems
I relate to eveything you just listed
Yesss me tooo
Ive said this before, and will sayit again, I ENVY you. 😫
SOO RELATABLE
The dancing at the end was good enough
Guess I’m skinny when it comes to dancing- I can’t dance
SHOUT OUT TO MY HEFTY BOYS THAT CAN DANCE!
Right
WHY IS IT SO TRUE HELP SSHAHAHAAAAA
As a thin spaghetti noodle,  I approve ✅
I am skinny and have most of those problems  except I haven't  had those comments yet. I get cold like so easily
Your better then me 🥲🥲
I wish we would change bodys
67 pounds?! I’m 89.0 pounds and I’m 11
As a skinny person, this is very true.  Sometimes me and my friends joke that I’m 1940s Steve Rodgers
Relatable   Everyone:eat some more!!  Me: wow thanks I just eat a million burgers?!?!
YOU JUST DESCRIBED MY WHOLE LIFE
I can realte
If you need something to hold your pants up and a belt won't work use suspenders just a suggestion
This is extremely accurate 😭
relatable
Bro…….. Dude……… Same
Omg these are sooo true! Especially the rib and clothes one
I have the exact same thing. I am 13 years old, 138cm and 24kg. I am the shortest person in my year and my family always say about how I should eat all the time.
So start working out
Honestly, I’d recommend letting loose and dancing weird even if you can’t dance. It feels good :)
yep
YOUR afraid I'm going to break in the wind  I'M AFRAID I'M GOING BREAK BENDING MY ARM OR LEG.
YESS OMG ITS SO FUCKING TRUEEEE OMGGGG FINALLY
So SO cool! 🥰😎
I’m more on the fat side and I would trade this for being skinny no matter the problems. I was skinny in like elementary and one of the supervisors said I look like a twig
This is so true
You could use a braided belt, those thing have basically unlimited holes lol
The rat more thing is so funny to me I eat the most out of everyone I know and my ribs literally stick out my body
Bruh why skinny people are always make fun of and I can understand that because I am skinny
"I CANT DANCE" Proceeds to dance
Yeah during the fitness gram test my spine would scratch up against the floor and I used to bleed out of my back and note I wore a white shirt everyday for pe so people would always ask me why there was a stain on mud back :/
Yeah, I literitally hit average weight a year ago. All of these were so relatable.
I have EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE
Do that’s why I’m so cold
Yaaasssss! So true
I agree
I am skinny too
Bro
I love youre dance moves
as a skinny person, the belt thing is very accurate
This actually made me feel a little bit better about me being overweight 😅
Wait ten years. I'm still skinny at age 30.
This is very true
They are all true
Is this a skinny person thing or just me? My legs will just randomly get weak? And I have to sit down for a few seconds?
Same except for the cold part it feels like I'm cold-blooded NGL
Realizing I also have those problems   🫡😐😐🫥
THE LAST DANCE THOUGH 😂😂😂😂
I WEIGH MORE THAN YOU …. How cool I might be able to pick you up but I would respect you probably don’t want to be picked up by a fan you don’t know :)
Fr once this girl said “do ur parents even feed u go eat”
When I was in kindergarten I was asked if I have anorexia, for those who haven't heard that word before its an eating disorder
Same
Society is a problem for EVERYTHING
Girl being skinny ain't stopping you from dancing. Ya just have no rhythm xD. Magic Mike can dance and he got Hella abs
Poking holes in the belt xD
I literally snap like a twig
Love the dance btw
Confirm
I can confirm
Almost everyone to us skinny people: eat a burger, omg do u even eat etc... The EXACT same people looking at extremely skinny models in a magazine: "wow they're so skinny I wanna be just like that but I'm so flabby bla bla"
You can dance better than I can
I am stickmanus supremus
Im not skinny and im always cold
Yeah I am skinny too
BRO JAYUS WE ARE LITERALLY THE SAME PERSON     Besides the skinny problems LOL
These are true, I remember always being called skinny bones by my older brother and when I mention it he always denies that he said that and he always made jokes on windy day's like "hey jump let's see if you go to Japan!" Even my younger brother said that joke, and now I wear baggy clothes no matter the weather just to not be ashamed of my body.
As someone who’s overweight I feel you on the ass hurting part
Her dancing is me sancing
Her: “can’t dance”  Me:get it Bella
OMG this is most relatable thing I have seen this week
I know how you feel, my family says I should start lifting weights- And when I sit down, my back hurts cause of my spine-
Eat carbs
Same
As a skinny person with a high metabolism, I can confirm this is all true
This is facts
I dunno man, seems like you got good skills..
Tell me you can dance by telling me that you can't dance 💃
I am kinda chunky boy and I thought that was bad but I saw this-
Life hurts I'm skinny
Still I wish I was skinny🙂
This is me I have all these problems
Sameeeeeeeee
Me: not at all skinny and being bullied for it as a kid Also me: also can't dance
I used to be SKINNY af and i LOVED my body back then (although people used to say "go eat a burger") NOW im fat and people are like "omg like u should EAT  a salad" like I understand both fat and skinny people- its sucks nowadays
You can’t dance?? Watch the morbidly obese people.
The irony. Fat people are told to "stop eating" while skinny people are told "you need to eat" and here we are.... Confused as fuck cuz all.folks wanna do is be happy. All skinny people aren't healthy and all fat folks aren't unhealthy.
I'm a kid and all these are true
This is so relatable
Dude my aunts say that I should eat more, I ATE THE WHOLE FRIDE WDYM
I’m not like unhealthy skinny but still skinny, and sitting on a bike is the worst thing like ever
Some person:*DO U EVEN EAT WHY ARE U SO SKINNY🙄*  YES I EAT IF I DON'T IM NOT ALIVE HERE RN
The sittining one is SO FUCKING TRUEE
Its so funny 😂😂
As someone who’s very skinny and is a very picky food eater and a vegetarian, I can relate. My parents constantly comment on my body by saying things like “just look at your arms I can just snap them in half” “you need to eat some real meat” “your body is going to fail one day and collapse ” “you need more fat on your body” “you don’t eat your lunch anymore no wonder your shrinking” like bro all of that was my childhood 💀
"I can't dance" My whopping up some dance moves  that no one else has🤣🤣🤣🤣💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
You are not alone I'm skinny to girl 😑😀🙂😮‍💨
One thing that you are lucky with you get cold really quick fat people don't in fact people can't dance either
Honestly I eat so fucking much idk why I'm not a fat fuck I barely workout
"I CANT DANCE" *octopus mode activated*
Im obese as fuck
Cause you're a skinny legend
I’m skinny as hell and I’m never cold… probably cause I’m used to it
I think that last one is just a skill issue
Hey I’m skinny as fuck too
True🤣🤣
I can agree. Im also skinny as fuck and people say "Go eat food. Eat a big mac" And shit like that. I also cant dance at all. Also i get cold SO FUCKING FAST for no god dam reason even thought its like 90 degrees in the room.
I was the skinny kid, now at 16 I'm glad I'm not so much.
I can't dance either...
I am underweight and I am 13 and people always say I am a twig my parents say get more meat on ur bone  “chicken legs” and they don’t understand that it hurt I have a hard time gaining weight I always wear baggy clothes cuz if I don’t people make comments on my body I have a hard time finding pants that fit me cuz they don’t make them small enough for people like me let me know if any of u relate.
Atleast once ive been through all of that atleast once in my lifetime... and yes even if you say and everyday says I can dance, I can't. Lol. Fyi ie.I can
bruh i’m fat and still get cold too easily
Don’t worry I can’t dance either even when I’m 150 pounds
instead of sitting try squatting down on a chair it's weird at first but it can actually be good after awhile
Same :)
I’ve finally started gaining weight from being pretty underweight my entire childhood but i still understand these problems
The dancing is still BETTER THAN MY DAD’S! TWTWTWT
Me
Same
Don’t worry I’m also skinny
Yeah I’m skinny to im 5 11 and 105 pounds 😂
I have 2 pairs of jeans that fit me cus I'm skinny and then i need some that are not to big but then their to short so i always wear  only 2 pairs of jeans
OH MY GOD I relate to this so much, especially number 5
We are like the same my doctor called me thin to my face everyone in my 4th grade class said I was skinny like a stick and I can't dance
bro i feel im skinny so much to the point that one of my teachers didn't let me go outside on a windy day
The can't dance might be right
Idk that's pretty good dancing fr.
I have the same problems
Lesbians in general can’t dance
I feel you
Who are u!!!
I'm so skinny as well
I get the cold and sitting one.. Like I'm shivering in sumer and those stools in three art department...
That dance tho
Amazing dance moves
Bro…love the dance moves!
SAME IM SKINNY
The 5th one hurts
I don’t think it’s because you’re skinny I think you just can’t dance
I always have to put new holes in my belts, even the smallest ones 🥲
Huh and I thought I would be better skinny still tryna loose weight tho
I’m not super skinny, but I have like no hips whatsoever so I understand the clothes/belt thing.. soo annoying
Those are some emaculate dance moves🔥
I can confirm this. My hips are often bruised from leaning on the countertop. My ass bone gets bruised from hard chairs and I have to lay a pad on the tub floor so my spine doesn't hurt in a bath.
Never ever in my entire life watched such a relatable TikTok
I have all these problems
Can relate
You think me as a fat kid can dance?
I can’t dance and my brother calls me fat by I’m 106.8 lbs but I’m 5,2 What kind of logic is THAT?!?😑🤨 Ps I’m 11
The dancing part may have something to do with you being white
Let's be real: the counter in that bathroom gets stepped on more then the floor
Yeah the cold one is so damn true like it's so understandable why I hate the cold weather
As a stick i can agree
You can't dance? I beg to differ-
True I’m 60 fucking pounds
"Your belt doesn't fit?" "Sounds to me like your fucked."
"I CANT DANCE💃" * proceeds bust the best moves I've ever seen in my life*
This is my life
People hit me with that shit all the time do you eat... Yes and probably more than them. Being skinny and tall just makes it worse too cause you look even skinnier to normal sized people.
I can confirm this
I'm literally so fat and I can't   dance and plus my mom told me that I'm starting to get 'big' thats a wonderful thing to tell a 11 year old                     My mom is still nice tho with ia great
"Put some meat on your bones" bitch, I'm trying!
"you can't dance!" Me:you can slightly dance
Just get sturdy if you can’t dance👍
I wish I could be skinny I'm like 1,422 pound that's why I don't where crop tops that much
I understand this so well like I literally wear a blanket almost everywhere I go around the house to the point where my family calls me Linus from Charlie Brown lmao
I GOT THIS MY HOLE GOSH DANGING LIFEEE
This is so fucking relatable
as a skinny person i can confirm and can also say…wym, those some fire dance moves
Every time I’m with my family there like “she never finishes her food because she’s so skinny”  my Pa even has a nickname for me “skinny bones” and I’m always covered in blankets :)
I don't eat sometimes cause I feel fat but I am underweight and I only eat at most one meal a day.
Bro I feel u
Dude, 6’5 and 210 and I am sooo lucky to find pants that fit
So that's why I'm always so cold. And random bruises just show up because I like to sleep on the floor at night.
Same here and I was bullied a lot so I actually once broke my arm
"Cant dance"? Honey, thats not cause you're skinny. Its because you're white.
1. I got that problem and I'm not skinny 2. I got that problem and I'm not skinny  3. I do not have this problem  4. I have this problem and I'm not skinny (not the way skinny people do though 5. I got this problem and I'm not skinny but I don't have it the same way skinny people do  6. I got this problem and I'm not skinny.
Beautiful dancing
I can relate
I have a hate love relation ship with being skinny
Yep I'm skinny and nothing I eat changes it
I have the same problems like everybody calls me so skinny but I eat a whole lot and all the things you just said I can relate
my mom literally told me "people will think I abuse you because you look too starved and skinny"
Yeah I was skinny and now I’m just average weight for my height
Made it to 5'9" in highschool and was stuck at 99lbs for years. Had a coach tell the volley ball team to cut sugar out of our diets then called me out in front of everyone that I didn't weigh enough. Got up to 110 after a few more years. Started birth control and finally got up to 135. I can't wear a normal belt, I always buy braided belts. Just got an elastic one from Amazon and it's friggin amazing.
To true
You can dance like a normal person can
I’m skinny too but not as tall as you Jayus a chick is 6.2 and as a guy I’m 127 pounds and 5.5 NOOOOO 😂
I’m skinny yes this is very relatable 😭
Wtf bella
I'm skinny but about the clothes thing I really don't care because I already wear clothes that are a size bigger anyways so I can't wear pants without wearing a belt.
I can confirm all of this
6 feet tall and still only weigh 128 pounds That’s my situation
I can dance but it's so true I'm always cold
Me very skinny but I still have a little bit of a stomach Am I not dying though
Yup
My neighbor has like a grudge on my parents so she tried to get them arrested by telling the police that I was going around knocking on people's doors for food 😑 I eat like fifty meals a day
I had a bag with a belt buckle adjustable strap, and I had to poke holes into that too bc it was waaayyyyy too long... 😂😂
This is so freaking relatable
As a fat person I'll trade ya🥲
YESSSSS I FEEL YOU
I have the same problem, I remember getting two sizes of pants and the smaller ones the waist fit,  it the leg part was too short. And the bigger size the legs fit, but the waist was too big! It’s freaking annoying!
Aww, your not over weight....I'm sorry, you want taco bell
She gets me now she the best
I wore child clothes for longer because teen clothes didn’t fit
Me: Fat af Also me: Why does this sound like me?
As some one who can see their ribcage, I can relate to this one
Lol them ending
So me
Albino stickbug
Being skinny this is so true, i eat so much fucking junk but i dont gain weight at all.
*"i have never seen a guy that thin do you even care about your image? Do they starve you there?"*   I do not see why that's their business, why do they have to say such things, why do they feel the need to leave comments like that?  What's their deal?
Can’t dance either, I GET COLD SO EASY OR DANCE!!
I have that exact same problem
It's my life everyday
Onlyjayus: I can’t dance! *proceeds to have a seizure and twerk*
Lit
No, you can dance.
How is this so relatable? LOL
I have the same problem
Same with me
Ong so relatable
This is me now
Well you can dance better than me lol 😂
Too true
Relate except the "I can't dance"
ALL THE THINGS U SAID I DO AND THE “YOU NEED TO EAT MORE BURGERS” THAT HITS HARD!
Me all the time
And this is why I wear hoodies in summer
You can not blame the skinniness for your lack of skill to dance
Shit she can dance better than me
This is true and then I gained weight people said Do you sleep in the kitchen? or Don't climb the ladder it can't hold you.
Sammmeeeee those are my problems
As a skeleton ya these are all true
I fly on the wind like no joke I got pocket up like 1 foot 1 time I'm concerned
I have a belt that you don't need to poke holes in, you can put it however you want. My mom got me that since other belts don't really fit me well
Skinny people, couldnt be me right...heh...
No She can dance She looks she is having fun oo
Jayus once said “ I can’t dance”  Then breaks out the moves
I don’t think 67 is a healthy weight
And then there are people that are fat shamed and stop eating when people thatare skinny shamed eat so much they make there selfs suck for it.. society is f**ked up
I’m also very skinny and I feel all of that
I wish I could say I’m skinny but I’d be lying
Lol that was me
All are relateble
This video is so true
Us skinny people don't break in half in the wind, we fly in the wind.
I can confirm
I’m skinny and I’m 11 and people always say get some meat on your bones
I love how they tried to dance at the end lol
OMG i hate when people ask me is I eat like I'm constantly eating i just don't gain wait so just shut
Yeah I've cried because my mom tells me to eat more then tells everybody I eat so much. She said it to my friends too 🥲
Stretchy web belt
Ok ok no offense, jayus I love you vids, but I think the part where you can't dance, I think it's a personal problem, although I'm also skinny, so I agree with everything, I love your vids tho jayus
This is all true. I get called a stick on a regular basis. Skinny is something you should not be ashamed of. Just make sure your healthy and drink water ppl. Have a good day 😊
1 million % correct 👍 Love the pant and belt part and I cant dance well either
Me: *able to see MY RIB CAGE AND WHEN I TOUCH IT I FEEL IT*
Skinny?😂😂😂
Me during wrestling season eating 500 calories per day with 4% body fat cutting 6 lbs/week: this is fine, I am healthy.
Im incredibly skinny but i can dance that just depends
Bro, I wish I was skinny
This is all too relatable for ne
I’m a skinny boi and I agree
This is so true
Can conform its true
I have ALL THE PROBLEMS
People at my school always say skinny people cant dance...      Then their is the entire kpop community being the best dancers on the planet
you still pretty 😊
I'm overweight as heck, and no matter HOW MANY TIMES my grandmother compares my dancing skills to John Travolta's, they suck.
I’m not to sure about the warmth, like I’m phattttt as fuck and still get freezing when the heaters on….
Tbh I think I'd rather be skinny than fat
I get yoi
I can confirrm
I’m not necessary what I would call skinny but I can’t dance either so your not alone
Skinny boy approved
I weigh 85 at 12
Not making fun of your way or anything but if you are to like a Healthy for about a month and have a salad in between those months three times or twice you should get to a good point where you can start gymnastics and you can dance really really well
Im sckyni and i cant dance
I wouldve been skiny AF if my grandma didnt introduce spice to my life, before spicy sambal i eat very little, but after...well lets just say i gain a bunch of weight, like a lot, im 13 and i reach nearly 70 kg, idk about you but last year was 66 or something like that, if i dont know spicy food, i mightve been at 30 kilos or something
As a person who had been a twig their entire life I can 100% relate to this. Yes there are pros to being skinny, but there are also all of these cons.
4 and 5. fat people have it way worse
No you just bad at dancing
True
Bro... that's how I dance 💃
I myself as a skinny person can confirm these things especially the belt thing. I am 14 and weigh 90 pounds. My butt never hurts I sit down, but when I lay down on my chest I also get bruises on my ribs. I have a fast metabolism so it's hard to actually gain weight
Korean girls be skinny af But they can dance so
Why you so fluffing tall
God, this is miserably relatable. And if I don't eat every 2 hours, I'm sick and dizzy and crying because of how gosh dang hungry I am.
You Can Dance a lot better than I can
I eat so much shit yet my metabolism is clearly higher than the amount I eat. I'm also skinny as fuck
So relatable
she cant dance and shes beter than me now im angry
My teacher 👩‍🏫 is skinny that we call here vegan teacher
Sooo true I'm skinny too
I’m a skinny person
“I can’t dance!”  Me: watches her bust a MOVE on everybody dance now!?  Me: breaks every nine trying to dance like…. idk how i dance lol 😂
I forgot she sweated and I had this top note next to my mum 😶😶
Chubby people advantages  1: you can walk through a blizzard with out freezing to much 2: I feel as if you just get funny 3: you tend to be a good friend
I know how it feels
You not dancing is just a white people thing, no biggie. And clothes don't fit you just because of  your style. I mean they do have skinny jeans.
I have the same problem I wanna gain more weight 😭😭😭
YES THIS IS SO FUCKING TRUE
At least your not fat like me
preachhhh
Do fat people problems
When i was younger i was made fun of because people thought i would break in half suddenly or if i was in a bad situation
Glad to know I'm not the only one that can't dance lol
As a skinny person, I have 8 blankets on me during a heat wave
My 5”7 extremely skinny friend who’s been dancing for 10 years and the best on our competition team
Last ones relatable and I'm not skinny
Yes yes it's true
Lol same
I’ve had this ONE kid that had no meat at all, just skin and bones in 5th grade and I always said, not around him. “I don’t think he has eaten a goddamn chip in his life.” 😐 Is that mean? That was my honest opinion
I grew up with the opposite problem but my best friend is like 5'10" and super skinny. She has always had an insanely high metabolism. I never realized until I hung out with her that people on the other end of the spectrum get shit to. I've seen girls glare and whisper to each other and she told be about what people would say to her when she was young because she was almost underweight.
And I'm skinny
Achly I can wear no jacket nor sweater in the middle of a blizerded and will still sweat.
Did that say 66 pounds?
Great dance moves!😋
I'm jelly that u dance better than I can
Im skinny but belts always fit me my problem with being a athletic skinny is just form fitting shirts. Tip use undershirts as normal shirts so they can fit you nicely
No you can definitely dance
Eat fast food ez
me and my older sis are really skinny and when she was in high school the coach would always saw GO EAT A CHEESEBUGER he is a bitch
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS
I wish
What makes you believe that us overweight people CAN dance?
I relate to literally everything.
I’m only eleven and my whole life i have been called names and told to eat like I don’t try. even my dad says it.
Hmm I had the same issues bc they give out Adderall out to any lil kid so I was 60 lbs at 13
Lol me my whole life (the dancing one is the most accurate)
"I can't dance!"  *Pulls out the most based chad dance moves on the whole fucking planet
"turn sideways and you will turn into a crack in the wall..." I heard that alot
Me
To be honest your dancing is better than mine 😂
Dont blame not knowing how to dance on your thinness... just go for some dance lessons😁🤣
Last one is just a white people problem
Justice for us skinny people ✊
What do you mean you’re the best at dancing
Coming from a skinny person these are all true
Nobody can dance like that and not look like an idiot
I can relate to literally every single thing here
Stop complaining people starve them selves and get surgery to look like you. You can dealing with not dancing and be cold.
Most relatable thing I’ve ever watched. I’m not even a hundred pounds and it has nothing to die with how I eat
Always the older sibling who make me insecure about myself.
Omg I did all of those I still do
Literally my best friend
Me too,people would call me a stick.
That’s me
My looks out windows before dancing bc  now I know people watch
Sick moves
Relatable
Bro I can’t even lie on my stomach on my bed. 😭😭😭
Yeh that’s definitely me my pants fall down very easily am done time my friend pulled my pants down in the street😂😂
I think the can’t dance is a personal problem
Your very cute/ handsome so you go bestie ( idk what type of compliments you like)
I don't think that last one is related
GREATEST VID OF ALL TIME
Look I eat a lot like A GODDAMN COW, BUT I CAN'T GET FAT MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BECOME FLEXIBLE
1. Heavy fact  2. I’ve never had a problem with that 3. Fact  4. I use a belt with no holes 5. Fact (it’s annoying) 6. I meeaaan xD
She makes too many fake anxiety issues she don’t have why she feels like she’s fat go eat a damn burger or 3
Like really adorable keep dancing
That made you so adorable
My friends tes me about how skinny I am they say hi toothpick,stickman,bro you break in half in the wind
I was 6 foot 2 and weighted 140lbs in high-school had no fat on me just pure muscle and I ate enough for 3 people lol I'm 28 now and stopped riding BMX had to get a real job and have responsibilities so now I weigh 222lbs and I'm lazy
Ps I can’t dance either and totally blame it on the height I just look so awkward and weird
As a fellow skinny person i agree
Exactly if you have a comment on how skinny I am or lucky I am to be skinny just shut up plz.
Hahahaha. This was good. The dance part was the best.
Wow same I'm like 16 and I'm 90 pounds
i agree with all of those expect for the last one but that’s because i take dance classes and i have for as long as i can remember. i was always told to go eat a burger or something (still am) i eat A LOT i just have a very high metabolism
I was told that I should eat less and that I will turn fat
Sadly this is all true I’m short and skinny  😭😭😭
Same for me I’ve always been skinny shamed
Facts
I’ve eaten a Big Mac, a Quarter Pounder and burgers and et cetera that I forgot the name of and STILL I’m that skinny 6”0 guy. Like, WTH!
I-I’m heavier than you and I am under 10
Hey
Me: I want to be slimmer  ( hears the info) Me: you know what not just for me
Love ❤ her
When I was 8 I was 48 pounds was that normal bc my friends keep calling me skinny jim?
We dance the same way hahahaha and your videos are amazing
yesssssss this is so truee
IKR i have this too. Ever since I was a kid, I still have it. My gramma would give me alot of meat but I never became fat
last one is just u
I have the same covers
I kind of wish I was that skinny.
I am skinny as f**k and I can dance
I'm 37 6"2  and I'm skinny  my hole  life asso and so when I bump my head knees  or albos I get dizzy  and pass out it's really  annoying
Eat protein bars every night
Is it just me or did anyone else see on the Instagram photo the name is michal joy with the joy sounding like Jay??
When I was in 3 grade I was 46 pounds and the doctor said to gain weight and I got to a healthier weight but covid made it even better but I still get pushed by the wind
1,5 and six are agreeable  Edit: that dance 🥵
Stop cussing
I cannot explain the pain of number 3, im.fricking skinny and litterly am almost always freezing and people think I'm overreacting, and number 4 is sometimes also a problem, and 5 yeah I have a great metabolism so when ever I eat food I also immediately consume and digest it, so I eat fricking all the time and people still think I don't eat a lot lol
Also just like laying on your back my spine is dieing
Why are u standing on the sink like that though?
So true as a skinny person as well like I've been trying to gain wait and like I got close to my goal (90 pounds) and then 2 days later I went back down to 85 pound. Like bruh
I think my friend might have an eat disorder but I don’t want insult her by telling her have you any suggestions
I think you nailed the dance
all of these are true since I have the same problem lol
Same
LOL I always get hot I’m the opposite
Omg I am super skinny and I relate to every one
All of that is sooo true i’ve been so freaking skinny my whole entire life and i only way 94.5 lbs and i’ve never been above 95.0 lbs and i’m only 14 yrs old and ppl always ask me like you need to eat more you are to skinny. And everyone thinks i have it easy bc i’m skinny but i don’t i sometimes sucks!! 😡😡😊😊
Omg yes! I have to get kids belts because none of the adult ones fit!
I can confirm literally everything on this list.
0               <---   This you?    --|--     /\
Super accurate
Same so skinny and tall 😂
I’m fat and I can’t dance
I’m a person that can eat but I can never gain the weight. Idk if it’s because I move around a lot or I just have a fast metabolism
That last one is just being white.
i have all of these problems so i can confirm
Pfft
As a skinny AND malnourished (I was/is/am a picky eater) child(hood?) I can confirm. However the comments my dad gave me were a bit more than soul crushing.  *"I don't understand how you aren't dead."* "Why don't you just eat it?" **Arguments over food**  And there were/are more, I just don't remember
It's crazy. It's almost like thicker people go through the same thing just the opposite. Constantly told to eat less, always staying quiet when everyone is talking about their weight and how "over weight they are" when your 50 pounds heavier. Sitting down also hurts, as does laying down for too long. There are many "problems" that occur for both sides. Society just has a weird way of saying "no one can be happy because there is ALWAYS something to change."
3 and 6 are true I eat a lot and I'm skinny
Ya I mean all this happens to me as well and the “just eat” part sucks I hate it and I can’t dance either lol
The cold one is so relatable, and also I finally got to a weight where the doctor isn't pressing that I see a nutritionist, but of course I grew taller so now I still need to gain even MORE weight to be somewhat healthyish weight
Ha that's a best buy uniform 🤣
"Twig arms," being called "tiny wrists," instead of my actual name.
This is true, a little to true
OMG this is what I need to show to people to show them what wee go through.
As a fellow skinny person who CANT GAIN WEIGHT TO SAVE MY LIFE I confirm
No one know to dance
Skinny people and fat people have a lot in common besides the sitting, laying, and getting cold quickly
Do chubby the society
As a very skinny person I can say all this is true
We could bruise on our ribs from laying down like that?
i found my soulunderstander if it means something 😂
Why just why is this me !?
Welcome to the club
I feel this😭
Everyone is making fun of me because im skinny i am only 12 years old
Very true on the last one 🥲
My mom used to say that if the wind were to get out of hand I would have blown away because of how skinny I was I am still extremely skinny
Yea me to a little bit much
Skinny since i remember. My grandpa would always tell me to eat to grow but I ate like a lot of junk food  and I didn't get heavier... but I got taller than my whole family
Facts
Those are some swag dance moves man
Do you eat? Yes- I do johnny. Shut up
At least youre not being called pregnant at 11 :(
As a skinny person, I can confirm that all of this is true.  Except getting cold fast. I'm told I'm a walking stove because I'm ALWAYS warm.
I started dieing laughing when you started dance (not an insult just thought it was funny)
Tbh I'm way too skinny and get bullied for it 😔
Relatable  13 right now and I weight 85 pounds And that’s probably from my bones and organs
And whenever I go to swim at the beach. My siblings yell "LOOK THERE'S A  ✨STICK✨ IN THE OCEAN! " TvT
Fr my mom huge me and deadass said to me "are you on a diet" like thanks- totally NOT trying to gain weight here, totally not
Those dance moves are fire bro
Same with me my hole live
Number 4 and 5 hit me hard. I’m 6’ and 130lbs, nothing fits
The last dance they did just got me on the fvcking floor💀👌😂😂
im the same but not AS skinny
When i am starving i eat like a mounten of food and never grow fat I am skinnier than an wooden electricity pole
Id your skinny you might just have a high metabolism
I’m 11 years old and I am always told or asked if I even eat anything or that I need to eat more and it is so annoying
I'm like 7 years younger than you (I don't know your age and don't really care either) and am 142 lb
I am tall and skinny I feel that
I can relate. My family says I’m skin and bones and that literally all they say and it’s so rude. Like I think that I’m unaware of that. ( ur the best dancer I’ve ever seen)
66 pounds??? Jesus your like 6,4 or 6,2 so yeah being skinny seems like it would happen but 66 pounds
hmm i’m 10 and i’m 100 pounds 😃 i’m not physically overweight, i look quite the opposite somehow
The sad thing is my papa told me that I need meet and my bones and so did my dad and they all say I have no muscles bc of how scrawny I am
I’m not trying to be mean but my eyes hurt from watching you dance
Nahhh you got mad dance skills!!!!
Good don’t affect my size/weight and I’m also tall af
your not alone
As a skinny person I can confirm
So relatable as a skinny person 🥲
I am skinny and I can say this is legit
Skinny and fat has basically the same problems, but not relating to health
Bella:I CANT DANCE me:same
Ooo I’m happy I’m fat
Best part about having some muscle   I was like 6’2 160ish pounds. Absolutely skin and bones. So i would get cold so often. A few years later i was 6’3-6’4 and 210. I have become the “shorts in winter” guy and I’m never going back
The 1,2,4,5 is so true for me 🤣
This is all way to accurate.   (...Except the last one.)
I'm a skinny person I can dance  I'm freaking stronger than the average and I get hot really fast EVEN IF IN THE NORTH POLE
I feel what you feel
All my friends call me spaghetti arms and call me a twig
The dancing is just cause we are white
Bro these things happen to me all the time
Not me being 120 at 10😂
I personally deal with this I have dealt with this my whole life and the way people say "do you even eat" or "she probably doesn't even eat" people don't see this as a form of body shame but it truly is and I'm tired of it and people will be all "well just get some meat on your bones" when you literally can't and there's nothing to do about it this hurts but I've learned to push through what people say and have a positive outlook on my body just the skinny way it is
But with no insulation I don't think you get hot  quicker than others/ fatter people no offense
Bro sometimes you slip down the shower drain its hella annoying
You do suck at danc…… you are super good lol
I am on ADHD medicine that s*** f**** with me in this video is so true for me though
I NEVER GAIN WAIT IT IS SO ANNOYING BC YOU CAN SEE MY RIBS
you weight just like me and im very young
Yeah... I constantly get complaints from MY OWN PARENTS WHO I EAT MORE THAN!
I know how that feels
The can’t dance is just a white peoples problem
Who actually can dance??
Also you always have to sit in the middle seat
Bro, being fat is much worse
ive never related to a video more bro
I can confirm
Lmao
Fellow skinny people……ASSEMBLE
USA when I sit too it hurts my butt
I have fast metabolism u might as well it means u can eat anything u want without gaining weight
I can relate
As an EXTREME skinny person, I can totally relate
I’d rather have that than being over weight for my age
Soooo true I’m 84 p
holy shit bruh bein as skinny as i am i interact with so much of this garbage lmao, all the time i'm constantly reminded of me being skinny as all hell even tho i eat like an average person
I am super skinny/tiny and I am a great dancer/dancer of 10 years and have traveled the world dancing
People tell me  "Do YoU eAt" "Me:YES I DO EAT KAREN"
You can dance better than me😅
Fax
I find myself in an awkward situation, as I’m skinny, short, yet jacked.
Agreed
Im the same way
As a fellow skinny person, I can confirm that this is very true.
Your dancing is better than mine
Bro I’m skinnier then you I’m like a stick
Yes I get that a lot
Shut up
I’m still that way
So true..... Same problems.... 💀
That dance was very good!
Us fat people can’t dance either
As a skinny person I can confirm this is true
Dat last 1 might just be a u problem
I can confirm
For shifty comments add " omg you need meat on your bones" like I eat 24/7 and weigh 80 lbs at aye 14
Lol those dances lol omg that made me laugh
Can’t relate am thick
That’s me. I’m an unhealthy weight
Big boob problems if I lay on my stomach my boobs will compress my chest so I can’t breathe and I have to adjust them or it hurts.
Bro. Same thing for ALL IF THESE but dancing. I can dance thanks to living with a Puerto Rican family on my dads side and amazing energy and chaos on my moms side
I am 11 and I’m 88.8 pounds
As a very skinny person, I can confirm this.
Yes I'm a skinny child and everything is correct except the society one
I am only in 6th grade and I am heavier than you
"YOU CANT DANCE" *immediately proceeds to prove us all wrong*
I mean them dance moves are 🔥🔥🔥🔥
No insulation I'm always in a blanket
My parents don't get my complaints about being skinny, and the hard chairs are the worst
Okay I’m still a teenager but I eat like a 300 pound man and am still as skinny as you lol. And I’m super tall but not thick so the pants thing is real. But I will say I can dance. That’s just a you thing lol
I eat so much and gain nothing 😭😭
That sounds like a you problem the last one
This makes me feel better about being… let’s just say… big
This is so true
Can confirm... I have to eat a lot of stuff... To only gain 1 pound
This video was so relatable. People always made comments and what they didn't see was that my metabolism is just super fast. I can eat just about anything and not gain any weight. God that belt issue is the worst issue. Not to mention that being cold all the time sucks. And getting hot takes a while to cool off. And having to eat like all the time to keep our body warm cause you don't have any body fat to work with. The shaking sucks. But we got to be happy with how we look. And I for one think that every person is beautiful 😍 no matter how they look. Thanks for spreading some awareness. Much love for all your videos
Me and my brother are the same way I have to wear a belt every day and wind blows me across my yard
This is true
Well I mean you can dance better than me
As a skinny person I can confirm
I eat More Than anyone who asks do I eAt?
I feel it im 33 kg and 13
So we have opposite problems me being overweight of course exept for the clothes part, very hard to find clothes
That part when u started dancing made me crack up laughing and yes being skinny is very cold I can confirm 👍🏻
also when your full from food when you breath in too much you can see your rips and your stomach starts to hurt
SAME I CONFIRM TOO
Am but I have all of these problems
Most peoplo cant dancce i knoe i cant
I know the pain
As a skinny person I can confirm we can’t dance
Love the videos and your energy. Yeah. You're thin but that makes you no less beautiful. All natural,  so rock it!!
Me to I got fastmatabalisom
I can dance but I am skinny but it is true
Yes let’s dance like Jim Carrey
Also Idk if it’s just me but I used to leave my arms on the ribs like little armrests, a lot.  That singlehandedly fucked up my posture.
related
That ain’t shit compared to what fat people deal wit but in that case the fat person is to blame cuz why tf u fat
Reasonable WAAAAA
You dance better than me
Bro I just stare at my boney hand snd think it looks like a rat hand lol
I'm 39 kg at almost 14 and my brother who is 9 weighs more than me that's gotta tell you something

I just am kinda appreciating being fat buuuut-  *Bullies*  *always sweating* *clothes are SO TIGHT*

She can dance better than me that's for sure.
Ayo😳
Gurllllll you taller and skinner me
You can’t dance… wait until till you see a fat person dance lol
I mean nothing by it but that’s just how I pick with my sister. I’m built more heavyset and there are times she calls me fat and I call her scrawny that’s just how we teas each other. Any other siblings do this?
Yep that's me 🤣🤣🤣
I can't dance" but you just did??
I listen to this at least 10 times just thinking facts and someone knows what I feel like
Me who is fat: ehehe lol
Bro that’s literally straight facts.   If I want to lay on my stomach I have to put a pillow under me😫 The Comments are the worst though; “You just eat but it doesn’t go anywhere☹️”

Nhaaaaa those are some killer moves
“I can’t dance!”  Well that was a fucking lie
I'm skinny af and I dance like Michael jackson
Approved by a skinny hooman
Ikrrr my parents always say eat steak to gain weight and me eating steak still not fat and I get cold a lot in like a mall or smth
100% me
Honestly all of this is true. I've always been underweight all my life and honestly not being able to gain weight is really getting to me
Brooooo sameeeeee
My ass bones also hurt but thats just bc im flat im actually really fat everywhere except where i could need fat
Same
i'm 11 and weight abut 29kilograms AND I'M SKINNY SO I CAN CONFIRM
as a skinny person, this is accurate as hell
Yeah like what The Fuck god give me some meat
Me with the nickname twig: I feel it...
It's weird cuz when you're skinny people tell you yo bro you're so skinny  real see your bones go eat a freaking Burger get some meat on you but when you're fat they're like oh my God you're so freaking fat you ate 1,000 pounds go eat a salad make up your f****** mind
I'm a fat person and I can't dance either so don't worry
You're too heavy, you need to stop eating so much. You're too skinny, you need to eat something. PICK A DAMN SIDE!
Yes can confirm
omg do you even eat??  you look like a barbie!!   omg you're so thin!!  you should get some meat on those bones!! omg what?! i can feel your spine! guys come feel her spine!!   believe it or not, i don't like feeling like a shiny toy. it's not funny. it really fucking hurts.
Me saving the video to show my skinny friends that they can't dance. Them. Trying to dance 💃😅 Us going to get pizza 🍕 HOW IS SHE STILL SO F**KING SKINNY AFTER EATING A HOLE PIZZA
Dance moves were on point
Dance moves are better than what I will ever have
Bro stop cussing
You can dance better than me
Me to
I’m not skinny and still can’t dance
BRO THIS IS ME
sameeeeeeeeeeeeeee litrally I can relate to all of those expasually the ones were people will make a joke about me being skinny as a kid. But one thing I can't relate to is..............                    I can dance heheheheheheheh. But people mostly think about larger people but being skinny is harder because of that stuff
As a skinny person I can confirm this
i rellaet to al of these            BuT WaT CaN i SaY I Can DaNcE
YES
“Don’t be so skinny eat something” “Stop eating so much you’re already fat” “Stop putting weight on” “Stop losing weight” “Skinny isn’t beautiful” “Fat isn’t beautiful”   What is wrong with our society?
I have the same issues, especially with my ribs. It also doesn’t help that the right side of my ribs stick out about half an inch more than the left
The last one is just a u problem
Same.
She is right
As a skinny worm, this is right
Me watching this:  Maybe I am skinny
Me being 15 and weighing 45 pounds i can confirm but I'm very short
I'm skinny as fuck too my weight is like 48.9  bro really said get some meat on your bone I'm fucking 12 and I'm tall
I know right I've been skinny since I was four
Lol why is this so true
I can deal with that 😭
I’m skinny too. I know the feeling.
Chandler !?!?!
All I have to say is, yep.
So true I can relate
As a skinny 13 yr I can confirm that you get told to eat all the fucking time
Her: *I can’t dance* Also her: **proceeds to dance amazingly**
At least your skinny tho
I can relate to that
As a tall skinny 11 year old, TALL AND SKINNY AS HELL PEOPLE CANT FUCKING DANCE
Fax!!! Except I am short too! 💀
I can’t dance either 😭
I’m fat and I can’t dance either
Relatable
I can’t either and I’m 218IB
Same
Me who is skinny until you can see my rib cage bones : Ah, The life every skinny person has to feel, OVERLY SKINNY!
its just a white thing we just cant dance lmao
Same
THIS IS THE EXACT PROBLEM I HAVE IM 11 AND 62 POUNDS HELP MEEEE
Yuuuuhhhhhh bro my fing mother
Jayus: I CANT DANCE him: dancer
I understand all of these problems
Same
Yah people always assume you’re skinny because you don’t eat enough. Yet, I eat more than 95% of kids my age and am still super skinny.
Skinny or big either way something is going wrong
Me I can eat ten times the Macdonald menu and I won’t get fat….
Yep can relate
i can relate
“I can’t dance” *Proceeds to slay*
As a literal fat god...not relatable..
When someone Seay your skinny it’s the same amount of bad then saying your fat
I relate strongly
So is really beautiful
My grandma came over for a visit to see me and my family. I was eating some pizza and had 1 slice. (It was honestly a pretty filling pizza) My grandma then said “Oh honey, you’re so skinny you need to eat more.” “Do your parents not feed you?” So the next time I had dinner with her I ate A LOT and still looked skinny. I wanted to laugh at the look on her face when all she was eating was a small bowl of soup.
As someone who has went through all of these (and still does) I can confirm and agree with all of this
I was so skinny teachers would ask if I had enough food at home. They then would confront my mom asking if we were poor and couldn’t afford food. For reference I was in 5th grade and 70 pounds at 5.8” (I was really tall for my age) Well finally in 9th grade I haven’t been asked if I have enough food at my house.
I know right😂
Lol Im fat and sitting also hurts me
Meeee asf
Flatter than a pancake
U r not skinny compared to me
As a skinny person, I can confirm This is true
Yeah like I was sitting down on a chair and after a while I said "ah my but hurts." And someone I know said "that's cause you have no meat on your ass."     Yeah..........I think that's why I am insecure
Idk onlyjayus, looks like some pretty sweet moves! Better than Elaine's moves on Seinfeld. : )
As a not so skinny person, I can confirm absolutely... nothing. I wanna be skinny like yall dangit, idc if I'm cold or not I like cold, and society is just a bunch of people who either admire you but wont admit it, or they just want some beef wit you
Idk man I’d say those are the best dance moves I’ve seen ever
My twin sister is 116 puonds
So true im only 76 Pounds and im 12
The dancing is you
She’s like what 21 - 30 and weighs 66 pounds I’m 11 and weigh 73
I get called a twig by my brother bc I don’t eat 🥲
Me (who is 13 btw) I can confirm these facts the comments are told to me by my family and friends. I never knew that it could go to shaming skinny people
For #5 I try to eat alot but I can just never gain weight. Atleast being skinny was a trend once
At least you don’t weigh 2 x your average weight or most of the adults you meet
Fun fact michael jackson was skinny and he was the best dancer to ever live
Not dancing is ur own problem
I can relate to the belt
Jayus: I can’t dance  Also Jayus: proceeds to bust the sickest moves
I just started bulking
the dancing just you (no offence)
I am a 125lb 5 foot 4 11 yr old thats sad
Wdym, your dances are insane 🤩🤩
I used to be size 4/6 now im 14 and fabulous
I feel ya on that last one
Saying do you eat is just the same as saying  Stop eating you fat idiot go workout
The can’t dance is just being white I would know I’m white and skinny
I would never relate.  Ever in my life
No offense  but not everyone can dance
I understand your pain I am really skinny
That’s so true
Amazing dancer
Bruh I don’t think the dancing thing is your weight i have a perfectly healthy weight and I can’t dance lol
Yes
Nobody Me in musical staues when music playomg:
The reason I like this because is because it’s true
What's wrong with your dance moves that's I dance
You can dance. As someone who CANNOT dance, I should know.
I am skinny person and i agree to it all but the cold because for some reason a am just a walking heater and i started to use a pillow in school so it did’nt hurt to sit for so long
And when I am eating.. How can you stay still skinny like that?
Meh don't feel bad, I am fat and people laugh at me :|
this is me rn
This is exactly what happens to me all the time
I was skinny until like a year ago and I can relate.
My Husband can relate shopping for clothes with him is heartbreaking for the both of us because either one of us can find clothes that perfectly fit unless we spend over 20 dollars and when people make fun of him I get heated more than he does.
Miss girl I don’t think that not being able to dance is bc your skinny just kidding but you are very good at dancing best I’ve ever seen
Bro instead of go eat somthing they should say you should go to grams
As a member of the skinny community This is so true
Ayo according to this shit i'm most likely skinny
The wind comment is so accurate tho
How how skinny people can’t dance yeah that’s how I feel I can’t dance😂😂
I don’t know if being skinny changes weather you can dance or not but being tall that changes things
I'm the same way xD I will lay on my stomach and then I just lay down  for the rest of the day and watch starwars because my ribs ache
I'm skinny and I can dance 💃
I wish i were as skinny as you
What if you consumed 4000 kcal a day using smoothies?
The worst is growing up insecure af then leading to trauma
Ah yes, relatable content.
As someone who’s been in both sides of the spectrum I much rather be skinny lmao
I grew up em eh lets say not healty waight for my age nor hight i’ve been fat my intire life and the one thing i’m always getting told is “go work out and eat less for the love of god” eh the first time i was told that was when i was six- FUCKING SIX
I don't think the last one is an actual problem I don't think it's related to be skinny
Bro i was standing talking to friends and i fell cause of the wind i weigh 28 kgs at 12
“I can’t dance” that’s just you
So true
Your lucky to be skinny sometimes
I am underweight, but I'm still not cold, rather I enjoy cold and people tell me that I am cold-blooded 😂❄️
You can dance love it
As a thick human I never realized that being skinny means you bruise easier  I suddenly appreciate my dump truck a lot more
I’m underweight and bullied for it 😕
Better then being fat and constantly tourmented for it.. schools a bitch 🥲
I'm dying of laughter of u dancing
Samee laying down on my stomach and sitting can start to hurt lol
I also can confirm
What’s funny is I’m skinny but I got thick thighs and ass bro, thank god about the sitting thing
Me too
The wind moves me
Bro idk how the fuck I’m not fat I eat so unhealthy I can fit into really small spaces
This hits close to home because I am 13 and weigh 81 pounds
Well I’ve been fat my whole life that’s what everyone tells me so and everyone tells me to stop eating you’ll lose more weight so you’re very lucky to be skinny unlike me when I get made fun of every day so just anyone anyone like anyone and everyone just appreciate yourself and don’t let people get underneath your skin because if you do you’ll be miserable and trust me I’m miserable and my life is now horrible because of that a whole bunch of people make fun of me and everyone tells me that I look like a pig or I look like a fat cow or what I said at the beginning of this comment you should stop eating you lose more weight that way or they call me food lover but sometimes people like food and they can’t control their eating habits so you’ll just appreciate yourself and stop the hate because I hate it and I know a lot of people do too please don’t let people get to you and especially the only reason why they’re making fun of you is because they are less than you and you are more than them but they’re trying to become more than you and they’re trying to make you less than them when they are really less than you please just appreciate yourself and don’t let people get to you
I don't want to say you can't dance but you really can't dance I'm so sorry
💃🏻💃🏻🕺💃🏻🕺💃🏻🕺💃🏻🕺💃🏻
I skinny, if you overexert yourself you also get rib owy. It's been days, it still hurts
Yea all the kids at school say that I should eat more and why I where baggy clothes..
Girl the hell you mean you can’t dance you go out and get it 💅🏽
I am also very skinny and i get bodyshamed by my parents to :(
Yass Bella has definitely convers
As someone who is definitely not skinny, I never knew skinny people had problems
As a skinny kid this is all true
I'm 5'9 and 114 lbs. and I have all of those problems but the only dance moves I have are from K/DA
U can definitely dance I can’t dance believe it
Me nine and 70-80 lbs
Bro the dance moves were fire tho
The last one made me happy and Laughed
I’m just a 🦴
I’ve always been really skinny too, i can totally relate! Also I really love her outfit
Pain and suffering
I love her dancing 😂
I AM 12 Y OLD ANDD I AM 58, h I AM 95.7 p HELP ME
SO TRUE OMFG!
I don’t think the last one has anything to do with being short
Ur dance is fine
stop cus my parents would tell me if i didn't get more weight i would die. i was like 10😭
As a person that is skinny as fuk I can confirm
As a skinny person, I can agree with every statement
Damm the dance was trash 🤥
Can confirm
Ii want to be you so badly I keep breaking my chairs
The fact that you can’t dance isn’t due to skinniness, it’s a condition called being caucasian
To be fair I don't think the dancing is cause of the skinnyness
Those moves were amazing
Oh nooo I'm skinny help me grow the fuck up
I can't dance either 😭🤣
Then after eating when u get fat they tell u to slim down
Waa
I hated sitting on the stools at school bc I would have to sit there for 1-2 hours and my ass would hurt SO BADLY 😭
As a fellow skeleton I can agree
I can relate people go up to me and ask to see my wrist and put there two fucking finger around my wrist and see how fucking small or skinny I really am
lmao walked to school once and some kid at my school yelled for me to eat a burger. I'm not gonna say what I said back to him-
This is so sad
The fat People watching: You are living my dream (me)
“ Can’t dance” dances better then me
Nah homie, you can't dance cuz you just can't dance, there are some big or thic or meaty or wider people out there that bust down and it ain't got to do anything about their weight. However you can change that and not everything else by learning how to dance. Or not do whatever you like, it's just a suggestion.
THE DANCEING IS FCTS
your not wrong
Coming from someone with Protein losing enteropathy, I can unfortunately confirm all of this
i used to be very skiny as a child. it hurt to sit down for to long
This is so true
She has a seizure when dancing I think it would just get better
This is way to true
My friend is so skinny but once when she was a kid she was holding a kite and it was really windy and she took off 😂😂 her dad was freaking out
i wish i could relate to this tbh
I don’t get how people dance, and they make it look GOOD HoW!??!?!??
Oh I use to be a skinny person so Ik
Me being six foot 2 and skinny as hell I can also confirm.
Same except for the healthy weight haven’t reached that yet
Please be honest, who else is hella skinny and way to flexible?!
I can confirm I AM SKINNY THIS ALL IS TRUE!!
Most of this sound like me
I can't relate I'm a fat ass
Dont worry i am fat as shit and cant dance so dont get fat and think u will be better
Bro got me Dancing like talk 😄
Same
Well you being skinny has nothing to do with your inability to dance
That is some of the best dancing I've ever seen
Yep can confirm
No wonder I’ve been too cold all my life- 😬
I live in a desert and it’s hilarious because I am so skinny and what day it was like so hot and then I was like mom can I have a blanket my mom be like sweetie it is burning outside you’re cold yeah what’s the problem
Secret plz
Im very skiny as well and agreed to all this but i can dance
Being on the opposite side I never thought of this.
Take mine I don’t want it lol
Yes just yes
The things people say to you about your weight is the worst in my opinion. Especially when it's friends and family who make comments like that
You can’t dance cause your white it’s a known fact
as a skinny person i will saw this is true
Another thing is roller coaster seatbelts and bars aren’t taught enough, so you end up getting thrown everywhere
I am very very skinny but I can dance that’s just your problem you can’t dance
I’m skinny too and THIS IS SOOOOO FUCKING RELATABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've given up on putting new holes in my belts I just get those belts with the metal teeth attached to a flap so that doesn't face holes so I can make it tight
As I big guy I got the same problems except for being too cold 😂😂 I'm always fucking hot
"You gotta poke new holes into it" Me with a mother who hordes random shit: *laughter*
Life sucks when your skinny
I’m super skinny sitting down will hurt after a while
As a skeleton myself this is so fking true
I actually agree this is true I’m like u
HAHAH as a skinny person same. i get the “wow do your parents feed you? go eat a burger” like bitch i can eat your whole fridge and pantry and more don’t even try ✋
As a skinny person this is verrryyyyyyyyyyy true
same 💀
Well at least ur not fat 😂
It goes the other way around aswell
I am so skinny like when I try to dance It looks like I am trying to perform a demonic ritual 👹
Happy = fat
Bro I’m glad someone understands this 😂
Lies. You can dance.
Better than being a fat hippo
Jayus:I can't dance *Dances*
You get cold fast if you woman
I weigh less but I'm still fatter😑
Relatabele
At least your tall im short as hell
Also when u a guy some ppl think its chill to just push u cause they can. Mad annoying
Its so much more socially acceptable to talk shit to someone whose skinny than someone whose fat. Im probably better now because of the disrespect but i still find the double standard annoying
Lmao this is so true
"I can't dance" **proceeds to dance amazingly** No joke I loved those moves haha
So many people have told me to like go eat a burger or something and it hurts people don't understand how bad it HURTS.
I was always told those as a kid and still!! I kinda hate it but I agree and I’m tall I can never find any clothes that fit me!
Skinny and tall sucks, there aren't any pants that are my height and width
True story so I was a little a lot evil as a child so I’m in preschool and kid pushes me off swing me being the little stuburn kid I was pushed him back and every time I swung kicked him in the face the teacher talking to my dad the WIND BLEW ME LIKE 10FEET BACKWARDS
SAMMMEEEVIM 12 AND 66LBS I SAT ON MY MOMS LEG AND SHE SAID OWW YOUR BUTT BONE POKED ME!!! LOL
Michael jackson is skinny af and you see him dance lol
As a fat person, your f*cking lucky.
FINALLY SOMEONE THAT AGREES 😭😭
I have all those problems I sleep under 4 blankets (DURING SUMMER) kinda sucks but has it's pro's
People literally call me “your literally a stick” my mind: WHAT THE FU-
Same for fat people too
As a fellow skinny waking skeleton, that fact you didn’t acknowledge sit-ups and lying down in the ground. Siiiiiiiigh
Me visibly disappointed I have none of these problems: dang
Get some meat on your bones I felt that
I can confirm this as a 87 pound 14 year old
As a skinny person I know that all of these things are so true. People tell us we need to eat more when in reality some of us eat just as much as them we just have a really high metabolism therefore we barely gain any weight.
I am the exact same way
But, thats how i dance...
i agree
I have a book of insults comment if you want me to insult you with an insult
Man I’m chubby and I have like the exact opposite of those problems in the winter I am warm but in the summer I overheats so easily
Me being super thin and tall it all is true
I'm 5'10", 140lbs, and 40.  I've been this way since 15.  She's so right.
I can relate, my ribs hurt even when I’m just laying on my bed
Being 95lb I can say these are all accurate
I used to be skinny as fuck. I had to deal with these problems alot. I was 60pounds from age 5-12.
She can dance better than me
As a kid, people would tell me “your so skinny that if i touched you you’d break.”
My grandma used her sewing machine to adjust my pants in order for me to fit in, idk why my parents never thought of belts lmao
Get a fabric belt and for some reason I'm skinny and always hot
I can 100 relate. I tried to get jacked. Didn’t work
Am I skinny?
That last one is just you
I guess i'm skinny now
Well have you ever been more than 22,0462 pounds below the average for over 6 years straight? Also wtf finally someone inderstands why i am Always running around with my blanked my sister IS Close to kill me If i dont Stop it
Bro the sitting one is true af
I get called by one my friends that I'm either A Minecraft skeleton or I need meat on my bones which coming from this freind which let's just say he is small which he very much is so. It gets me down in a bad way, he also humiliated me in the biys locker room saying quote "did you're dog eat all your meat because your so skinny?"
Can dance better than me lmao
As a skinny person, I agree it's just that the cold doesn't bother me
It probably doesn't help that your tall either
I can confirm about the dancing part-a skinny person❤
Im skinny but I can dance 😂😎
Preeeech Especially being referred to as twigs since I was 5 The effects are as bad as you think
As skinny person agreeeeeeee. My waste is like as wide as my leg
Yup same for me
' I cant dance. ' Me : girl u can dance better than me
THE HIP BONES. THATS MY PROBLEM
Wtf does dancing ability have to do with you being skinny tho 😭
You sure cannot dance but it's okay cuz I can teach you
With the society stuff I just say at least I’m not as fat as you and then they are quiet
As a fellow skinny person I can relate to everything. I eat a shit ton of food a day and I don’t gain weight like you can’t just say eat a burger that’ll help. Nah it won’t.
Dont worry. Youre not alone
6 stone is not a healthy weight
Fat People Problems: getting called diabeeto by a 7th grader
Dude the belt one is relatable 😂
So glad I’m “big boned”
I'm also skinny asf I 100% relate to all of these
Ya same tho
looks like I'm now skinny without the skinny
You sure are a potty mouth for a girl, that's un lady like, just kidding be who you are biatch lol 😂
What bugs me is that I've always been skinny, the doctor has confirmed that I will always be skinny. But one day my grandpa starts looking at me weird and I asked him if he was okay. He said he was worried about me because I'm "not eating enough". I eat a lot.
My brother is seven and weighs as much as you
You can't dance! Also her dancing better than me-
Am I the only one thinking that's a very ideal figure in Asian culture?  (Hope it's not rude to say this)
Hey I can't dance either and I'm a fat f*ck, not as fun as one might think
I'm hella skinny, 18yrs old and 53kg
I dance the exact way
People make fun of me and put their hands around my wrists and say "Looky whole hand goes around her hands!"
I think the dancing is just a you problem
Same I gotta pock more holes in it one time I got a watch and my hand is so skinny it doesn't fit I pocked new holes VERY FAR AWAY FROM THE OTHER HOLES !! 😩😲😧😳
Lol. As for the first one I’m fat but I have no fat on my but😭😭
Your dance moves are wild
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man I hate those dumb fucking comments about me getting meat on my bones, it’s so fucking annoying
I will never be cold from this stomache 👍
This video is my life!
Yes
As a fatty myself:  My ass also hurts sitting down, I’m a bitch, so I get cold quickly, I ate a baby.
Welcome to my world and I think you look cute skinny
I can relate, I’ve been super skinny my whole life and I’ve been made fun of for it, the weird thing is, commenting on someone’s weight is rude, unless for course their skinny, then it’s perfectly okay to body shame them as much as you want, at least that’s what society seams to think
I FEEL YOU! I WAS CALLED A TOOTHIPICK THAT WAS MY NAME ALL SCHOOL YEAR
You're dancing just fine home girl! I can relate to the skinny life....You're beautiful,  own it!!
I have a similar problem with weight. Say i am 100 pounds, which i never will be, and i eat 20 pounds of food. I will be 90 pounds. My motabilism is to fast.
As a skinny middle schooler who just got to a decently normal weight (90lb used to be 70lb) I cam agree on the comments my friends are constantly criticizing me and making me feel bad that I can eat anything (I eat a lot-) and not gain weight
lmao just like me 🤣
Just chilling on my bathroom sink. Normal hmmh
I am 20 pounds under weight an as a kid that is a lot so I can confirm all of this
SO THATS WHY my sister always has a blanket over her head, and body when she walks around.
Me
I'm not skinny and I still can't dance lol
Lucky
Pretty much the complete opposite of the exact same thing happen to fat people    *cough cough*
The pain is unbearable
"I can't dance!" #whitepeopleproblemsthatidealwithtoo
You dance better then me
Ah ya dance just fine
Dancing cringe
Oh I that being skinny was good 😔
Micheal Jackson: am I. A joke to you
Tru
I to have high mattabolisim
I feel you
i feel you
The sitting down hits too close to home XD also the comments
A healthy weight?? 66 pounds.
All of these are fat people problems
My whole life got described in a single blog video. Damn
"i can't Dance "   *proceeds to dance*
When I suck in my stomach I can see my ribs and I can see the bone in my arms.
Ikr I’m 15 and my gfs sister who is 14 told me she can’t hug me cuz I’m skinny and I was like what the heck
Also, my pelvis bone is SO GODDAMN POINTY it’s not even funny
One time and second grade someone said you eat so much but you're so skinny to me.
Don’t worry, I’m thick and still can’t dance, can’t fit clothes that easy it goes either way 💀🙏
She forgot one bracelets never fit your small wrist
I'm overweight and *I* have these issues
"You have no isolation" Me: getting cold real quick but also hot as well. Which means the summer and winter times are grab. It's eiter too cold or too warm for me 👁👄👁
these are so frickin true
Having a high metabolism sucks because I can't gain any weight unless I eat EXCESSIVELY or absolutely destroy myself at a gym
Subbed. Incredibly relatable. Have a WoNdErFuL day
I’m 11 and I way only 50-60 pounds and this is relatable especially the comments
Bruh that dancing moment was amazing✨ i’m pretty skinny as well and that’s how I dance, and it is so much fun xD
Dancing isn't a skinny ppl problem it's a every body problem
So glad I’m not the only one. I’m 19, 6 feet tall and weigh 130 pounds
I feel ya 😪
I'm fat as fuck, but i can dance
If someone makes those comments I either 1. Start going on about how frail and worthless I am 2. Tell them saying that makes me want to not eat for the next 2 weeks 3. Start hard crying and (semi-louder then normal) tell them to stop makeing me feel so shitty about myself 4. Act super pissed and tell them to shut up about my body If they say Im over reacting, I go harder into makeing them suffer emotionally  (Extra points if in public)
same
“Skinny people problems” 5. Society Isn’t that an everyone problem?
So fat people problems except your always cold instead of hot
I know how you fell…..a lot
Lol I thought u where a boy ur a girls
Not me being the shinny kid with scoliosis
As another skinnt person i can also confirm. IM COLD ALL THE TIME
Lmao relatable
Also if I sit on my knees I’ll start losing feeling in my feet because im boney asf
Skinny person approved (especially the belt one)
No you dance better then me no cap 🧢
as a very skinny girl this is true
i remember how i used to measure my weight every single day because i was told i was “too skinny and underweight”. Im glad I’ve stopped checking but its still messed up how stuff like this is said to children.
So true
It’s a skinny person  can relate to all of these😂
Facts
We all can dance  dosen't matter wat size, shape, age
The whole get meat on your bones, makes me want to die when I hesr that bull shit
i don’t actually think people can dance unless they train for years, so ima need an explication cause my dance is just move my arms and hope nobody sees
As a woman whom is skinny, people always comment on my 'chesticals' and say that they are so small for my age and ask if I eat anything and I say I do but they still try to force me to eat- and when I'm wearing a jacket in late spring ppl say that I'm weird and I should take off my jacket
relatable  Almost 16 here and I still am not even 100 lbs
I’m chubby and can’t dance
I am f fat people tell me 😢
I can’t dace
Can anyone really dance
Would you rather be super skinny or obese
As a skinny person I can confirm, yes this is true. Also if I lay on my side it bruises on my ribs
Literally my life every single day🫠🫠🫠
I eat too much bread and have slow metabolism. That combined with needing to eat means I have the opposite problems. You still dance better than me.
I’m skinny and I eat alllll the time
It’s all true in fact a doctor was convinced I never ate and my parents were starving me but it was the opposite they didn’t let me leave the table until I ate most of my food
So you think that fat people can dance
when i was in 6th grade i was skinny too, and some fat kid told me to eat a burger. and i told him to eat a salad. it was rude but he didn’t bother me after that.
¨I can't dance¨ proceeds to bust it down like an absolute beast
That is me right now
I have never related more
The last one is false its just that you can't dance
Did that scale say 66?
Naw, that was pretty great dancing skills
I’m 300lbs and sitting down still hurts because I have no ass. Stop complaining about being skinny  Love you though
Relatible
Her: I can’t dance!!!! Me dancing like a fucking monkey
I get cold as a fat person thank you
Same here
YES, THIS IS FAXX and yes ik its facts but yeah
People in the comments need to stop saying „I eat so much and I’m still skinny“. If you were actually getting enough calories in you would be gaining weight.
This is way too accurate
Being skinny might not be the problem to dancing you might just be bad but better than me
Felt 19 5,11 and 120 pounds can’t help it tho and I am dude
Ya I’m like 80 lbs
This is why i only buy belts with the wholes all around them😂
I mean....you can dance better than me, that's for sure...   But that is true, some years ago, ok maybe more than a few, (around middle school age) I had very unstable metabolism, I lost and gained weight like it was nonodies business, so I was constantly in both sides of the issue, going from being very chunky, to very Skinny, and very chunky, again and again for  a few years, and the issues are real, it's all true, people do say horrible things without a care, clothes don't fit, the floor hurts, but people hurt more, because they are constantly harassing anyone they can.  When I was skinny people made fun of it and told me to "eat meat", "eat a burger," "get on some calories" all those things (things I couldn't do because of health problems back then) and I had to constantly fix and repurpose clothes so they would fit well and not fall off, and the belts don't work, they fall off right along with clothes😒  Finding the right sizes that actually fit was hell, (and store attendants don't always help, sometimes they can make things worse)  and lying anywhere that is even slightly hard hurts, (I love sleeping in the floor since it relaxes be but back then I couldn't do that because my bones hurt, it was my favorite thing and I couldn't do it, it was sorta sad,)  As for insulation, I don't know about that, I get freezing cold weather I'm chunky or not, I gotta wear layers upon layers of sweaters just so I don't catch a cold even of it's not that cold outside, (and I love the cold but I can't stand it, I get sick very fast🥲)    But yes, being skinny was nice, struggling with incomprehension, body image issues, and overall having people make fun of me was not.  And then when I gained back the weight I lost, the problems were much the same, I'll fitted clothes, mean comments.  At least now I know I can simply ignore everything and live like it's no big deal, if people say stuff just ignore it, if the floor is hard just get extra pillows, if I'm hungry I eat what I want and hope for the best! And if clothes don't fit... Just look the biggest size available and learn sewing/pinching hacks😒 that'll save you a lot of trouble and money, and it'll look however you want it whenever you want it.
never related so much to something before.
my dance moves exactly and all of my family think im for having a heater
As a skinny person I can confirm all of what she said that and also I eat more then most of my family and friends but I don't really gain weight  I'm 13 and I only got to 30 kg last year that and when it's really windy I need to be careful or I will fall over.but I can make myself into a semi working kite so I don't have to walk I just get dragged by the wind and I made this Cape thing to do so
*As a super skinny girl, I can confirm that this so true*
my friend is really skinny and I feel really heavy compared to skinny people for some reason
Relatable
I love thin and beautiful people complaining about waitgh and how "ugly" they are. There are always people like this around. So
I can confirm she speaks the truth.
As a skeleton from Minecraft in can confirm
That's just you bro on the dancing but I can help by suggesting you take some creatine it will help you gain some weight if you want to do that and start lifting weights just be careful with the creatine don't develop your upper body too much unless you want big biceps and triceps I'm just trying to give knowledge
This honestly so true
im 115lbs and 5,5 and i can confirm especially being cold lmao
Still better than being obese.
My family is full of skinny people and all of this is so true!
Well no duh you can't dance your doin THOSE moves!!  (This wasn't meant in any mean way it was a joke lol)
Stfu you're so good at dancing, respect urself queen 👑💅💅
Being incapable of dance is a white people issue
I agree with all of this, another fucked up thing ppl would say is "she's gonna fall through a crack in the floor"
Me: eats all day*  My doctor: eat more or else
The last one is just a you problem
the dancing... i think its the pointy elbows and knees
Being a fellow slender man I understand how this feels 😞
As a skinny person I can confirm all of these are true, and the social one becomes a very bad body issue for us
“I cant dance”  kpop: cries
Jesus Christ died for you so live for him and live
You can’t dance? Oh well same if I try I will look like I’m dying. You dance better than me
I used to be a literal skeleton. The comments were the worst like "do you starve yourself on purpose?"
Skinny club , weigh the same as 25 years ago
She can't dance because she White, and trust me I know.
i love her dance
It’s okay super skinny too
I'm a skinny 13 year old and doesn't gain weight, EVEN THOUGH I EAT MUCH
I can’t dance either and I’m convinced state series are just aliens trying to take over society
Omg I’m slim too And it’s the worst like if you have me take off my shirt you can see my ribs and I get too warm or to cold like if you didn’t know  you think I was a skeleton
I am very different I feel sorry but I feel like that sounds mean so please no hate ...... Also you ok?
The cold one is very true
I’m skinny here and I swear to god I look like a stick but I have A LOT of muscle it’s just gets hidden because I’m SKINNY
the comment i always get “is do your parents not feed you u should really eat more”
Yes it is so true
i honestly dont know how ive been skinny for so long, i mean yeah sometimes its cool but dang why do my limbs have to be sticks
Relatable
“Cant dance” proceeds to show sick dance moves none of us could ever imitate
Have you seen you think you can dance?
FR THOUGH! tHeSE ArE ALL sO TrUe fOr Me
Nah the dancing is on you
You still dance better than me
I can't dance too!!!!!
And here I thought being fat was the only bad thing 🤣
She dances better than me😂😂🤣🤣
I dont think anybody can dance
Don't know what you talkin about. Those the best dance moves I ever seen.
Another one is swimming. I have gone my whole life wishing I could swim but I just can’t float or tread water easily at all. Also the water is also so cold.
You feel ur bones when you lay down
I am also really skinny it is so true
Same I am skinny
People always warn me that I'll be blown away by the wind 💀
"breadstick legs"
Yeah I grew up with the same problem id gain maybe 10lbs a year so I started out 5"10 at like 120lbs now it's about 200lbs because my height stalled 😂. All the while I had a eating anxiety where if whatever comment was made I would just shut down and not eat for the rest of the day basically..
SAMMMEEEEE
Yes I know and your not very strong too
Bro I’m the opposite 😭
I can totally relate 🤣🤣. I am glad I am not the only one who have to to new holes in belt
I don’t know if anyone has there inside of there elbow bone stick out
So I have never rlly felt the cold But I'm skinny as, like I'm underweight by a bit too
I’m skinny to
As a skinny person when you're a child and sit on someone's lap and they make you move because you're bony as fuck
As someone from a skinny family We literally have a device to poke new holes in our belts.
"I can't dance" Then proceeds to dance better than i can ever do 🗿
Yeah it's kinda true or maybe really true
I’m skinny and my Nan ask me if my parents feed me😐
Yup I can confirm this :) I eat way much more then y family and stuck like a twig laying in bed ✨🥲
Omg lol I always try to dance and it just looks so freaking awkward or twig like
Inr
as a toothpick i can also confirm like xStormy (guy in comments
I have never related to someone more in my life
U dance hello good
Hey...um...Bella, I used to be a full-time dancer and was the BEST dancer in my dance STUDIO!
I am in an EXTREAMLY heavy hoodie and sweats that JUST cam out of the dryer and rly fuzzy socks and am still feeling like ima abt 2 die from hypothermia (I 2 am also rly hella skiny)
Best dancer
What do u mean gurl that dancing is amazingggg
That shit fucked up to tell to a kid  Jeah cann relate
I’m fat and I can’t dance either
Basketball coaches to every high school kid that’s over 6 foot: “You ever thought about playing basketball?”
I have a problem where me and one of my brothers are kinda chubby but my sister and other brother are skinny so ppl will ask "do you two just eat all the food?"  AND ITS SO ANNOYING
as someone apart of the skinny person community i can confirm these are all corevt
'I can't dance!' 0.5 sec later: *dances the best jig I've ever seen*
I wanna be skinnier, my friends (boys) used to harrass me for not being 'skinny enough' and it's scared me so I've been starving myself for around 2 years now
I weighed 66 FUXKING pounds and going to climb Mount Everest
BRO I KNOW RIGHT??
Oh so that’s the reason why my whole family lives cold every night am now when i go fishing I don’t get cold… dam-
Oh so that's why my ass hurts everytime i sit down
As a skinny person, I agree except for dancing. As a ballet dancer, I dance (i would say) exceptionally well and Russian teachers love your skinny body so when I was often a tiny bit bloated they say the iconic “I can see your lunch through your stomach”
Try ballet, it’s easier to keep your posture when you don’t have to duck your tummy in😊
bro once my tutor needed to put some weight on a notebook so the page corners would stay folded and he says “well you standing on it isn’t an option you’re like 2 kg”
Same problems only I use a special belt that doesn't use those little holes
as a fellow skinny person i can confirm
I think a twig could dance better
Once my teacher asked if I was eating enough, none of your business, but yes I am.
You can dance, just not well.
That last one though 😭
As a former skinny person I feel ya.  Have a baby that shit will change...I miss my skinny
Am unhealthily underweight, can confirm that all of this is true. Except the society part, even I make fun of how skinny I am. And if you say I'm not funny for it, I can and will shank you with just my elbows.
People tell you to eat a burger then when you do and actually put a little weight on they tell you your fat 😭😭😭
This is soooooo true especially the society and belt ones omg 💀😭 but I am very grateful for my body :) much love to everyone!
Nah nah nah you a fab dancer
I wanna lose some weight but i like the ability to wear shorts in -10⁰f
Me: *eats a whole Macdonalds whopper*  Me the next day: STILL S K I N N Y
I think that the dancing thing is just you being weird
I dont think anyone can dance, as a not skinny person I cannot dance at all
THIS IS SO RELATABLE MT UNCLE ACTUALLY CALLS ME SKINNY MAROOKY 😭😭😭
I did cheer
I feel all of these
Oh my God same
I am super skinny so I relate
You dance better than me
As a fellow skinny person I appreciate that someone’s finally sticking up for us
Me too, I just got to a healthy weight, I've been skinny my whole life. My parents got the child protective services called on them twice and almost a third time luckily my teacher listened to me when I said I do actually get fed.
bro my stoumach is the only thing I hate about myself but people really be like “yOuR gOnNa gEt bRokEn iN HaLf”         LIKE WTFFFFFF
I was fairly skinny as a kid and that 5th one hit me different
I'm under weight  so I know how it feels I'm 15 and weigh 120
I don’t have that problem, but my boyfriend does! He’s incredibly tall and incredibly skinny, and I think he’s complained about every single one of the things you mentioned!
I mean them were some good dance moves
im skinny to0
I can confirm
I disagree with the last one
I can confirm this
I'm not that skinny but no one has ever told me to get a burger but, I can't dance.
"I CAN'T DANCEE" her- * dances like me *
Same bro
All of these things relate to me because I’m skinny but I can dance. Also I’m just 9 and people say those things to me. ( I have to take medicine for eating)
My mom calls me a pencil... now i know why im not the favorite
I'm a tall skinny person so nothing ever fits.
I think they were just worried about you.
You are fine
FRRR
You call that not being able to dance??
Your dancing 🤤
No wonder my friend is always cold…
So damn true, and I didnt know that I looked really ugly dancing. Thx, seriously, now im going to avoid dancing like crazy
What happens when you have some of the same problems but you’ve always been over weight 🤔
Your dance skills are beautiful
Glad to know the dancing bit ain’t just me
Dude so trueeeee
same situation
I am skinny and I've length limbs and my family was always like, go do this or go do that because I was the tallest of my younger brother because my older brother was never going to the same place as a neighbor and you have a great dance moves.
Relatable
Jayus: *skinny ,gaint, can't sit or dance* Me: *Near enough the exact opposite*
Same
That last one is just a white person problem (joke dont take it serious)
Im 10 i can se the details on my ribs
I WOULD LIVE TO BE SKINNY NO MATTER THE PROBLEMS
For me it’s always “get some meat on your bones”
I'm bloated as fuck and my back is aching, I can't lay on my stomach, my clothes never fit, I don't pull off anything, I'm ridiculed for being twice a healthy weight and so much fucking more. I'm not even a pretty overweight!
ok ok but imagine being a ridiculously short person who competes in a sport that makes you have to lose wieght. so all the problems of being short with all the problems of being skinny 3 or four times a month
This still happens to me but whenever it's more windy than usual people say to me "Omg ur gonna blow away in the wind"
Am I skinny? I don't think I am bruh, I need new holes in my belts a lot, the new ones seem to be too loose now
So true I am scinny
and this it why I gained weight
Really brave dancin like tht wild be afraid that Ray might wanna talk but this
There was a girl in my class who would take my wrist, wrap her index and thumb around it, and say "Omg, I could literally snap your wrist in half lol" even when I showed my annoyance whenever she did it.  She seems to think that we are friends for some reason??? We're honestly just acquaintances.
i feel you
You can do the kazotsky kick
Once o went to the school therapist person and they where concerned that I wasn’t eating at home and I had to explain that I’m just skinny af no matter how much I eat
This is facts
Nice now I don't want to starve myself for a year. Also I know if you don't eat for a year you might just die. That's the whole point :}
Nah those dance moves were great
Yes as a skinny kid I can relate I'm 11 and I am average weight but I'm still super skinny and my sister used yo take advantage and give the WORST I ndian burns
I’m really skinny and I get the same problems all the time …
As a chubby person I can confirm
Same I'm 11 and I'm 60 pounds
I’m super short and skinny and I get a lot of comments like “You tried drinking milk?” Or “Go eat something” The plot twist is I am a human garbage disposal, I’ve been able to eat a full cheeseburger in like 10 minutes since I was 10. People these days
Somehow, I’m skinny and fat at the same time. I can’t sit down on slim chairs because it hurts. Clothes never fit. I also can’t dance
Bella: "I can't dance" Also her: *dances perfectly*
I don't know why but your dance reminded me of Grant O' Brien
I agree bc I qm vary skinny
see one of the good things about being over is that you basically have your own heating, but that backfires during summer
sameee
Bella breakin it down! Amazing dancing skill!
Yeah but when you for they say: your belt is rupiter's ring! Or: You ONLY grow sideways man!   I whish I was skiny as fuck and lees fat as fuck!
Idk but I think it’s my adhd I just Forget to eat
I am LITTERALY a stick man and I can confirm.🥲
I’m fat and can’t dance, what’s your problem?
Bro as a skinny guy it’s a struggle I keep my wallet a knife and my phone in my pants and they will start slipping down if I’m not careful
I dont know about u guys but the dancing was good
Been skinny for fifteen years of my life, all of these are true
Ur lucky you don’t have fat people problems
I was always overweight  Not to much  On a healthy level but because I don't have a Sixpack everyone makes fun of me calls me fat tells me to stop eating extr.  And thee irritating part is that I eat healthy I work out and do everything I can to lose weight and it  simply doesn't work  Is there any health experts that can help me
Mann the ass bones and ribs hurting are so fucking relatable !! I was so insecured to tell someone this
I dance worse than that
Yes with the sitting one. I'm 5'6 and like 110lbs and legit just sitting on anything made of plastic or wood without a cushion or pillow hurts my ass bones and the BACK of the seats hurts my spine
My brother is like this but more annoying and less pretty 😑
Yeah can we talk about people's comments? Why do people call me out on being skinny, but telling someone they're fat is offensive? Can someone just explain that to me real quick?
I'm not even "skinny" I just don't have a butt so I feel that first one
I'm fat and I can't dance either
I'm almost 12 and weigh 30 kg SOMETIMES, i usually weigh less. Its very cold in winter and pants don't fit (I don't have a belt 😶). And whenever something gets stuck and my parents or my older sister can't get it they just get me to put my hand or my body through something to get it💀
This is so fucking annoying because I've been fat shamed my whole life and I would due do be that skinny
The other day my friends flipped out because they saw me eating and they didnt think I did...
That video make my day better,the dance part was nice.
i didn't consider myself skinny but after hearing this, man i might be 💀
I also confirm this is all true
Brothers skinny yeah, he can't dance either
As a skinny kid that's is being bullied by his brother I can confirm this
Tall and skinny is the worst combo. Shopping for anything is a pain. People saying everyone can dance, seeing me and saying they'll teach me... then giving up immediately. The struggle is real😭
I'm so skinny I can't find eny jeans that fit its eather the waist is to big but the legs fit OR the waist fits but the legs are to long or to wide it so ANNOYING 👖😤
YES.
Ik the feeling
My friend said I could probably stab someone with my elbow I’m so skinny :’)
I’m skinny af so I understand all of these 😂
All that happened to me
we had eogs at school and theses chairs were cold and plastic, i sat down with no jacket so i was cold and hurting my butt when the test was over the class was stetching and i was stretching every bone in my body was cracking
my middle school nickname was skinny bones.
66 pounds no way
As a skinny person I can relate and confirm The comments as well scar me✨✨ Especially since most of them are from my family
hah, same, my brother always is like “bro, you needa eat more.” HUHHHHH???
Wait, was that volleyball or basketball in that picture??-
Naw. You CAN dance. WORK IT! ❤️💃🕺
We got stuckbugged by a human person
Coming my professional opinion on being a twig. I can confirm. You speak the truth and I hurt
THANK YOU <33  The constant people saying "wish I looked like you!!" "Omg I almost broke you!" "You need to eat more"  AND HITTING YOUR HIP ON THE CORNER OF FURNITURE AND IT JUST HITS BONE 😭  Friend punched my ass and it hurt them more than me lmaooo so I got defensive skills too
Yes as a really skinny person, this happens. My friend calls me bones and my other friend thinks it’s scary
I can confirm
I have the same problem but I'm also short. And it sucks
Jayus: I can’t dance    Proceeds to do dance moves my graduation dance look like
Too true
Facts 12 years old and weighs 70 pounds
Same as me 😭
I am not sure the last one has anything to do with being skinny 😬😅
Why is this so true tho
I feel this pain
1 can dance better than me 2 I get very cold and I am fat as fuck
6'5" and 142 lbs. Skinny and tall whole life. Never thought about why I always got really cold or really warm
Also a skinny person very true especially the part about being cold
Yo I eat so much and am still skinny like why me
I’m skinny but it’s the compete opposite for me
Relatable af, especially as a 6"2 13 y/o
I wss skinny why whole life until about 10th grade, now im 21 pushing 200 lbs
So fucking true
I think her dancing is good
IM FRIKIN SKINNY I AGREE
"wait, but remember to put rocks in your pockets, the wind blows outside" I HATE BEING SKINNY HELP 😭😭
I'm almost 200lbs and i wear a t-shirt and shorts everyday even though it is 50 degrees
Me and you both 🙄
I’m very skinny and I confirm
Can relate.
Your not that bad
God i feel pain from this video, im 14 and almost 90 pounds
This is legit view, i am skinny. I eat my food daily, yet i got question why are you so skinny?
lol
Still Better than overweight
I didn’t know that was bullying…
I have many FAT friends and and i can say FAT People cant also dance IT looks ofyen comically
My friend calls me a stick figure
So relatable
I am every single one of those. 😭💀
All of these keep happening to me-
You gotta build up those shoulder muscles and get some AB's definition. Get the look you really want.
You ain't skinny
Can't rlly relate, like I'm kinda skinny, but like that in between skinny
Lol you're basically my sister
Nice dance moves
As a skinny person my whole entire life I can relate and when I like lay on the front for quite a long time and then I get up it hurts like my ribs had broken in half and fun fact we both can't dance😂
Clothes NEVER EVER fit right. In third grade I had a pair of teal sweatpants, and they don’t fit so I had my hands in my pockets pulling it up my waist. ☹️My friends were really concerned.
I have the sitting problem as well. I am so f****** skinny
Tell me why that when I sit down my ass bone hurts as well and I'm not even that skinny
as a naturally skinny person, this is very relatable. People uses to ask me if i was anorexic AT 6 YEARS OLD. Fucked up isn’t it?
Soooo true
If your tall you can't buy jeans, to short or to big of a waist
The end 😅🤣🤣
I love the: "you should eat more" Ha if you ate as much as me you be on the next episode of my 600lbs life Ok slight exaggeration but still. Also idk if the dancing thing is a skinny person thing but can confirm I can't dance
People call me skiny and they could snap me in half and when I punch them their eyes start watering
What are you talking about that’s amazing dancing 😇😂
"can't dance" I thought they can (ok we're going COMPLETELY out of topic but) alot of people on the kpop industry are tall and S.K.I.N.N.Y like wonyoung, somi etc. So they can dance...? Or is my brain not normal? Definitely not normal
✋
I’m fat and don’t want to be “skinny” but want to feel happy about myself
lol i have a disproportionately small waist
Same i am 72 lbs 😅
Why does that look like me when I try to dance
You look fine to me it's the opposite for me but I'm working on it lost 5kg so far (sorry for being honest)
It’s the worst when you lay on a linoleum floor and you just feel the pressure on your spine
Oh I already commented 😭
You should have had Maddie with you that it would probably look pretty good
this is so true except for the last part i can dance 😏 but people just think that we don’t eat even tho we do
i was really skinny in my early high school days. When i was in class i could hear one of my childhood friends trying to 'impress?' his friends', truth is idk what he was trying to get out of it. Still, he kept calling me anorexic and saying i "don't eat anything" it really hurt for a long time and it wasn't just once it kept happening. I just wanted to distance myself from him and eventually, i found myself in a friendship group with my best friend and a bunch of other people who are all my close friends now and i would do anything for all of them and I'm much happier now. I've forgiven him and we're our relationship is back to what it was before and we had a lot of fun today, i don't think he knows i heard him those times but idc anymore, he hasn't said anything related to my weight or body since and i still love the guy.
I always get the "omg you're so skinny, what do you eat?"
Ya I have those problems but also I'm lite as a feather literally
I have struggles with gaining weight and this is so relatable especially the belt and ribs one
As a so called skinny person by friends and family, I agree!   Today I didn’t want to eat lunch because I was full and my aunt said I was way to skinny and tall
As a skinny person I will confirm especially the dance and belt thing
I'm 12 and I weigh only 65 pounds and I can relate so much
Oml best dance ever oml amazing Haha
I can confirm. I'm super skinny...
I need to know peoples weapon of choice when poking holes in their belts. Personally I use the scissor x kitchen knife method
I like the fact that in the end she says that she can't dance but then starts dancing madly
That’s not the Roblox emote😂😂😂
That was some pretty good dancing tbh, better than mine
Totally agree
I don’t think that anyone can really dance
Your a great dancer.
I can agree
I’ve 14 and all of those are true
Did you forgor 💀?
As a skinny person i can relate
I’m a normal weight and I still can’t dance 😭 huge disadvantage
I get the same comments when I’m at school “You look so boney” “Do you even eat?” “You look like a skeleton”
Not her trying to dance
IM ALWAYS COLD. JACKETS ARE NOT ALWAYS AN OPTION BC THERE BAGGY A LOT OF THE TIME, ITS WORSE IF YOUR SHORT-
They can dance better than me
Yes i can confirm aswell
My doctor told my parents for me to eat more meat
Check your thyroid
I feel this
nah- you're dancing is awesome-
As a skinny person I can agree
Same
I have a brother who’s skinny as all, that dude can eat a plate of pasta (legit a whole plate) and he can still be skinny no problem. Some of my sisters have even been playfully jealous of that 😂
Y
As a fat person, society is bad too
“Bro, do you eat?” Me, who eats more than my entire family combined: Metabolism? idk man
The dancing part so true
Relatable… I didn’t think poor dancing skills was related the weight though 😂
Coming from someone who has a high metabolism I relate to this so so much people really just don’t understand how different it really is then add that fact that I’m a redhead growing up was never easy.
Same
I can’t dance and I ain’t that skinny. Not fat either just in between
You're forced to sit in the middle seat
I’m an absolute beast of an eater with 7 meals a day and at least 4 eggs per day yet I’m a fucking shrimp
everyone thinks i have an Eating Disorder
You really can't dance..🤣
I’m twice your weight when I was in 5th grade
I’m 80 pounds I feel you
I weigh more than her and I’m 10!
I’m skinny and I have these problems
As a skinny guy.. I confirm the dancing part
The dancing made my day don't wear belts that much tho I am skinny
Felt this on a personal level part of kinda wanted to cry 🙂
I’m not even skinny, I’m fit, but yeah all of that happens to me too
RELATABLE AS FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
My arms are skinny and everyone thinks I starve myself even tho I don’t like to eat dinner bc it’s just too much for my body  And some teachers tell me to eat more I hate that. Also everyone is beautiful, and the last part abt dancing is relatable
Can confirm, I have poked multiple new holes in my belt, it’s sad
“cant dance?” uh miss girl, you just lied to us all with those groovy moves lol
60 pounds? I’m like 12 and I’m 80 pounds  Edit: I’m also considered skinny, I once searched it up on google and it basically said I was overweight
Oh yeah I had that problem when I was younger I literally could not find a belt that fit me, but I was to insecure? Ig to tell my mom so I just made my own holes in a belt.  She definitely noticed that😂.  But I did find some belts that work really well there called braid belts and I still use them today👍✨
im not skinny nor fat HAHA idk where i classify tbh. but i know one thing for sure, if i EVER hear anybody skinny or fat shame someone, im gonna sucker punch the person making fun of them
As a skinny person I can concur that this is true
Same
It’s true
I’m like skinny af and this is so frickin true.
I’m not skinny but I’m not fat I’m like chubby
😩😩 too relatable
well im fat and all that happens to me
Dude I’m 11 and my parents still say stuff like do you eat
I'm skinny to girl I relate
I'm 11 and weigh 80 pounds evertime I go to the pool with my friends they make fun of me because of my rib cage and spine showing
Omg I’m so skinny so I can relate to this but I also grow very fast so my pants get really short. It’s a pain to go pants shopping bc everything is either too big or too short
I’m skinny too and This video hurts me
as a skinny person who has been accused of being anorexic and doctors constantly saying I am underweight for not being 100lbs at 17...I can confirm.
Its not fun being a "thick" 11 year old. I weight 110 lbs and everybody in my school says go on a diet fatty
This is very true
When I was a kid I used to be called "weak" coz I was thin. You're right jayus, that is fucked up to say to a kid
As a person who has been skinny most of my life, my inability to dance is because I was skinny, totally not because I’m bad
why is it always a burger :'(
Bella:I can't dance 2secs later  Haves a seizure🐧
People are confused when skinny people do strong acts
Fat and I can't dance
As a skinny person, I went to schools one day and I went up to my “friend” and were were talking and he just randomly put his hand around my wrist and said: “wow,your skinny you should eat more..” and I said: “I-“ then walked away and sat at another table 🥲
Not me laughing at you while I’m skinny 2😭😭 (the dancing part was the best)
Also for the belt thing  Try braided belts
I got this problem
This is so true!I have been told to eat more a lot!Also people are always like “your a twig,I can literally snap you into two”Everything in this video is 100% true!🥲✨
I weigh 80 pounds and I have the exact problem
I’m so sorry I have the opposite situation where everyone calls me fat and tells me not to eat (pls don’t think I’m being sarcastic because I genuinely feel bad for them)
I wish I had those comments. Instead its Go eat a salad! You need to lose some weight What about all that fasting you do (I’m Muslim) aren’t you supposed to be skinny Ohhh you’re the fat friend of your group!  I’m not even over weight my body just hold fat differently
I'm skinny, and I can say all of this is so true 💀
Can confirm
Stop skinny shaming
Also, people will like pick u up and be like, “omg your like as light as a feather”
Relatable 😥
S k I n n y
I feel like skinny problems are easier than being a bigger guy problem wise as I am a healthy weight but looking big had fucked my childhood up so much and I think that's where my problems have always started.
66 pounds is alot
All of this happens to me except for the "feeling cold" and the "clothes don't fit" parts
PREACH
Skinny People vibes      😭
When I was younger, early 20s, I was skinny too. I would eat huge meals at lunch on the job and those guys in the office was confused how I wasn't growing. They were shocked.
my sister has a slight metabolism
This kid calls me a little girl and weak boned little girl like bro I’m a year older than him
She was having a good time
ThaAaats me
The laying down one, ✨Fact✨
Personally I think you're gorgeous. I'm just going to leave this here. Have a wonderful day.
The cant dance one is also for some tall people because I’m tall for my age and can’t dance for nothin 😭✊🏼
Jayus me and you are the same like I can’t dance I’ve been skinny my WHOLE life I’m literally sitting in my room with FIVE BLANKETS and it’s fucking 80 degrees NOT TO MENTION I EAT LIKE A BIRD 😃
Please never do that again. 🙂
I think the last one is just a Jayus thing. J
Some how I eat so unhealthy but I’m still a stick
I agree
Jayus: you can’t DANCE   Also jayus: *does the best dance moves I’ve ever seen* 👁👄👁
As a skinny tall person,these are all true 😭
That dancing is better than minecra
Well at least you’re not fat like me
Eat more calories than what you burn.  "B-but I do eat a lot!" No you don't. You get stuffed on one meal, think that's enough, and random snack throughout the day. I know this because I was a skinny kid growing up. Also the comments were annoying. You're the worst if you comment on someone's morbid obesity, but they're free to comment on you being skinny. The hypocrisy is hilarious.
You just prouve you can actually dance
Your dance moves aren’t that bad
Yep
Onlyjayus:we can't dance! Me who is damn 140.4 pounds:your not the only one
Jayus can dance better than me😥
I CANT DANVE EITHER, IM FAT
I was told to fatten up literally a couple days ago lol
Grow tf up
Can dance my a** off, tho.
Exactly!
Woah 666lbs is healthy? What. Edit:672* and yes I know that isn't pounds lol
Ok the 2nd one happens to often and the 5th one like people don’t stfu like I don’t want your opinion
I don't know, those dance moves seemed pretty fire 🔥
All of these are true accept when I was like 15 someone said you look so skinny and actually bought me food😅( it was my best friend tho-)
This is me
I don't know you seem to be pretty good at dancing.
True 😢
A huge one- ppl going “what do you weigh?! A buck?!” “You can’t be more than a 100 pounds” etc etc etc…why do ppl think it’s okay to speculate on one’s weight if their skinny?!
My brother is the same.
As a skinny miself i agree but i can dance
I dont think it messes up your dancing or that dance moves exactly
"It's just f up to say to a kid"..... well as a kid I get told alot that I look like a skeleton even my father say it and yet I feel sad everytime someone said it
Me having the opposite problems except the clothes don't fit      And dancing, me too
BAHAHA THE BELT ONE IS SO TRUE, and as a skinny person this is true.👺
me too i’m also skinny
The way I dance
Bro it was such a change when I (involuntarily) lost a mother fuck ton of weight due to an ed and now have mostly recovered but not fully and can confirm also I can fit in a spot between my bed and wall and it used to be pretty comfy but now its painful having my bony ass body pressed against wood
As skinny we do mentally snap in the worst ways they either roast everyone or just wants to die
Wish I was skinny
I get cold a lot lol
"I can't dance!"  *Me wheezing in the background*
i only weigh 54 pounds
That is what i felt and still feel
Is 120 pounds for a 5'6 14 year old female a healthy weight, or too thin?
Well I’m fat
Thick people have to poke holes in their belts too it’s not just a skinny person problem. I think everyone would rather be skinny trying to gain weight than overweight and subconscious about how they look all the time.
Get a stretch belt from the men's section at Walmart! No pre made holes, it's woven, you can hook it ANYWHERE  and it stretches to tighten.
Getting comments about not being”thick” was damaging to a me as a kid like what do you want me to do like ??????
bruh i “was” super skinny like skin an bones and then i decided to bulk like none other i remember the sitting thing used to kill and now i’m fine because i have an actual but like a fell trying to touch a basketball rim and i fell on mu butt and litteraly bounced (so nice)
I have that belt problem too! Check out grip 6 belts! No more new holes.
I can confirm...
This is ture!
Can relate
I’m not that skinny I am 140 lbs and 5,6 I wouldn’t say I’m huge but I’m not petite and if I lay on my rib cage I will get bruises and I’m wearing the same belt since when I was 6 and it still fits but I’m only 11
I have these problems
I agree for all of these messed up to say to a child, especially if it’s the parents saying that, people are mean
I don’t think anyone can pull off that dance
Relatable
Yes that's Right 😭
Wellllll you can dance better than me so that’s a win   Kinda
You anoxia
im younger then 12 and YOU IM HEAVIER THEN U BUT period
This is WAY too relatable. Can't Dance, Clothes are just impossible to find, and do you know how many times I've been called skin and bones as a freaking CHILD? Too many. I'm glad I'm not alone. I guess I'm still a kid, but I'm almost 14 and weigh 68 POUNDS last I checked! Wtf
U didn’t weigh yourself properly you need to put both feet on
Same
same Tho- I get all of that... lmao
5-  Yeah people used to lift me up without warning just for the fun of it because "omg look how light she is"
when I sit on someone (not like that) I hurt them.
THIS IS FUCKING ME WHY THE HELL
Nah, being unable to dance isn't just a skinny person problem. I'm a bit thick (My girlfriend looking a bit like a stick next to me), and I still cannot.
ur so right but i can dance lol
Finally she speaking my mind
Im skinnier then you lol 😅
get in too it jayus
I Weight 115 AND IM ONLY 12 AND 5,8 like jeez
Jaimie: this has nothing to do with me, I’m offended!
These are very true
Yeah... having those problems but also got longs legs.. try to find pants that’s fits...🤐
I relate to that sm, when I was little my best friend was uhm…. Chonky :D and I was always skinny asf and she would say stuff not as a joke sayin stuff like “go eat a burger…” and one day we where having a sleepover and she BROKE all my feeling by just saying “my mom told me that your a very unhealthy person because you have no meat in your bones” and so later that day I cried to my parents and they just said she’s just jealous because she wasn’t skinny :(
The dance part is too true
no one:  my family:literally my family talking about how skinny i am at the family holiday party
I can relate
Watch the big body people say its fatphobic
She dances better than me
Dude, we have the same blanket/duvet
Last ones a you  problem
"I can't dance" The crippled:
you CAN dance gurl
"Can't dance"  Me " that is not because you are skinny you are generally just not a good dancer"
"Can't dance" Skinny K-pop female idols who are masters in dancing:**having another deep thought about their abilities, talents and skills**
Un front of the whole class a substitute told me, "you need to eat more you're to skinny"
I thought the dance moves were stellar
All relatable
Every single one of these applies to fat people too, besides the coldness and the do you eat, but I always get told do you ever quit eating? But yeah we just need to be cool with each other
Dancing looks fine to me. Have a great day
THE DANCE THING IS THR TRUEST THING I’VE EVER HEARD AS A SKINNY PERSON
I am 8 years old and 40.2 pounds and people always say mean stuff to me
I think the dancing problem is just you
A skinny kid here, something that’s hell… Sit-ups
"I can't dance!" Cap
I agree with everything
Dancing isn’t a skinny person problem
I can also confirm
It is so true from experience
Lmfaooo them dance moves thou 👏🏼😍😂😂😂
At my school my nickname was LITERALLY STICK......very offensive
When she is dancing this is me  It does not help that she is tall too no hate btw ❤️
That’s me now!!
I've never had the unable to dance problem
Facts
I’m not incredibly skinny because I’ve put on a little bit of weight and muscle since becoming a teen but I used to be an absolute stick and I can confirm that I still cant dance
No,bella u just can’t dance   (Jk idk illy)
The ribs and ass bone are so relatable
I can latterly ware the same t shirt I wore in 2018
Me to don't worry ur not the only one
You are a very amazing dancer believe it!
U can't dance I doubt that It's fun seeing you dance  🤣😆
i have those issues too gurl
I hate it when none of my belts fit/ pants. I mean my pants in length are fine but they always fall of.  😬😬😬
I have experience
Truee
i hate when people say "eAT moRe"
Me too
As fat person laying flat on my stomach and it hurts for female reasons but yk still
the end 😂😂
What do you mean those dance moves are great 💅🏼✨🤌🏻
yo sameee
Sorry but being fat like me also sucks probably worse
You sound anemic…..
Agreed
laying on my stomach hurts my hip bones more than my ribs but yes dude it sucks
I'm skinny and I can relate. I get jealous of other ppls bodies  Edit: I'm wearing pjs that basically everyone my age fits into, but the shirt looks weird on me
In skinny too, i feel u
As a chubby person i can't confirm
I was like 12 and we were at thanksgiving and very publicly my grandma said “what size pants do you wear? Size 00? HA!” That shit hurt.
So true
As a certified skinny person , I can say that this is true
Interesting 🧐 It’s so fucked up how ppl called you skinny as a kid, it’s just so terrible 😣
Was I the only one who saw 66.7 lbs
I'm a teenager now. I'm 29kg...
i felt this on such a deep level
Luckily i like the cold
Jayus can probably dance better than me-
Don't worry I can't dance either.
It’s the worst when you have long arms too
i love this so much i danced with you
Idk I feel as she has the best dance moves😂
You can dance… in a way…
What do you mean you can’t dance? 💃
SAME THO!!!🥺
Your the literal same as my bro, but he's fourteen and an other thing is feetsize and shape. He has 12 feet and they are slim af, and I'm short. I wish I was taller lol.
I’m skinny and I relate to all of them
I live the dance
No but we can move our hips
Dude, I can’t even sit in soft chairs. All I feel is p a i n and bones stabbing
I know exactly what you're talking about 😅 I've been extremely underweight my whole life. Last christmas i only weighted 49 kg (108 lbs) and I'm a 32 year old man. I recently started using a new medication and during the last 6 months I've gained 23 kg (50.7 lbs). My current weight is 72 kg (158.7 lbs).
the fact that the society is never satisfied with u ,so i am fat and everyone keeps telling me to get skinny and my brother is very skinny so everyone keeps telling him to get fat its sad
I’m 6,4 and I’ve put on some weight I’d rather be cold then feel like a black blear in summer
Imagine the other side be grateful ur skinny
I CAN'T DANCE!  Yes you can! That was fabulous!
People tell me that crap all the time XD I have a picture of me from when I was younger I was just skin and bones, no meat, kinda like toys, no batterys including but child, no meat including, also people say it's a complement when they say your a toothpick Me when I was 5: uh mom- I think the winds gonna knock meh over"😶
not to be rude but you weigh less than me I'm 13 and 80
I literally laughed at the very end I wasn't trying to be rude but it was funny cuz that's literally the dance moves that I do because I can't dance
The ribs thing hurts ME, I can't imagine how it affects skinny people
I know what you mean
My brother is very very skinny he is almost 15 and he is only 109 pounds And he relates to all of this the last one mostly
Hah imagine *fatass noises*
Me thinking that her dancing can't be that bad she proved me wrong
The Dance part is not a skiny persion thing lmao
Omg I have to get the clear belts with the holes all the way round as decoration, the thing you stick the end of the belt in is wat too close to the fastens but tho I have to use a bobble to stop the extra belt just flapping around 😂😂
I weigh 46 and I am 18 of age a woman and my whole goddammit life I have been called a spoon. Only a head and a stick like seriously I do eat actually I eat very unhealthy and yet I have not gain any weight. I wish we get to be treated normal for once.
I am skinny so I can confirm this is fact among thy fiction.
Im fat and my pants still slide down
Two word that are different in British English and American English in one sentence: I can't dance
I agree. This is true.
I agree 100% 👍👍🎈💯
Once we were going rock climbing with my class right? I couldn’t put on the weird belt thing that you have to wear so that you won’t fall to ur death if you lose ur balance and I asked The teacher for help- u know what happened? It could not get tight enough- It kept being SO LOOSE NO MATTER HOW TIGHT SHE MADE IT
I can relate-
So true
I’m the opposite though 😭
Why do they think its a compliments saying " I wish my arms were as skinny as you" AND THEN COMPARE MY WRISTS AND WRAP THERE HAND AROUND IT
I'm only 50 lbs
I’m cold
As someone who is about 40 pounds underweight, I can confirm all of these.  Also, it bothers me like hell when someone says they envy my body. Hehe, no, you really don't. My body ain't healthy, but we're working on it.
A very wired question are you a girl or a boy
A very wired question are you a girlor a boy plz answer pleasee
the dance. mwah.
I'm sorry, I just can't help but see really skinny people as fragile beings 😭😭😭😭 like if we arm wrestle I'll just tear their arm out
"I can't dance" Impossible
I'm skinny and i confrme
I can confirm to Clothes never fit me I am nearly 14 and I still have to wear kids also I get told constantly I don't want to hug u I might break you Xx
OMG ME TOO MY FYP IS SO RELATABLE
The dance made me laugh so much I almost peed myself 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Ya I’m skinny and I can’t dance. I only dance in musicals 😅
I feel your pain
My family:all day talking about number 5 to me
Telling a skinny person to eat more is equally as disrespecting as telling a fat person to stop eating..
I mean that dancing didn’t look half bad
jayus: I CANT DANCE proceeds to break dance so hard, IM JEALOUS
Lmao, at the end and being as a skinny person, I agree👁️👄👁️
With 5.society I just proceed to eat a whole bunch in front of them yet im still skinny......... and hungry  And getting cold is the best one, I got used to the cold and touch everyone where cold hurts.
My dad skinny shames me it makes me feel like shit
Fresh hair
everyone says you'll fly away with the wind or an incest will make you sit on it and fly away with you
Im really skinny and people ALWAYS do this and my clothes never fit
I'm also skinny and I can confirm this is true but I'm used to the cold now
I'm a skinny person and even though I ate like 2 Bowls of rice for dinner every day I'm still not gaining weight I'm just growing taller
Always have the problem where I'm so skinny you can see my hip bones no matter how much I eat. :/
So your skinny WHO THE F$@k CARES
I’ve just given up at this point. You can fit my wrist between your fingers? Ok. I need to eat more food? I eat like every hour but ok. I can count my own ribs? Ok.
I'm personally chubby, BUT, here's the catch- I'm *short*. Yup. So whenever there's any wind at all, people worry about me-
As some on who is also skinny as fuck and who strugles to put on weight I can agree
omg so true
I wouldn't say I'm super skinny, but ppl will ask if I wanna take my coat off, and I say NOPE
I was ten and barley 54 pounds
The ONLY belts that fit me are the ones that have the holes through the entire belt
I'm freezing cold rn
man i still cry cause of the comments, then they pull out imm encouraging u to eat like stfu up i *CANT* gain fucking weight u little shitty ass looking brat
Facts though!!!
I feel your pain
You dance like me hahaha ig now I know why I cant dance I am too skiny
All of these are so true.. I'm never cold though
Same 😫
Jayus dancing is killing me mentally
my brother is skinny too so yeah
Watchu mean u can't dance I did dance for 4 years and you got better moves than me
Hey hey hey, you forgot the fact that even if you eat alot it still doesnt help much. Skinny ppl problems
Onlyjayus out of context when?
It's called anorexia nervosa and it affects 90% women and 10% men. Anorexia nervosa means the fear of eating of being overwheight
ITS SO TRUE UUUU
As a fat person, I can’t confirm
I've always been thin but still a healthy weight and been picky and always been eating small amounts all the time instead of meals so it always have small lunches so I always got questions like what do you eat for dinner and people asking questions about my lunch including the teachers
At lest your better then me
No matter how much i eat, Im will always be skinny ;(
the belt one hurt more than my father throwing it
as a not skinny but not fat person, i can agree with the bad comments, everyone's like "yOu lOoK PrEgNaNt!" "YoUr rEaLlY GoNnA EaT AlL ThAt? i CoUlD NeVeR" and then when i don't eat a lot, people are like "eAt sOmEtHiNg!"  but as a not skinny and not fat person i also cannot dance
Me being skinny I can agree on this but for man the heat goes through me and laying down man it hurt my ribs
I'm younger and heavier
meanwhile kpop female idols      🤫😌
As a stupidly skinny girl who’s been dancing since 2:  and I took that personally
Honey the dancing isn’t the skinniness
her dance moves at like 100 times better than mine...
Girl same
Fr I hat being skinny
She is true
im skinny. can relate
As a skinny person "Omg do you even eat at home" All I did about that is just smile it off and they got to a new topic
I was like you for years until I found out it was hyperthyroidism.  I was sickly skinny. My thyroid was over active for 40 years until it just died. Now I can't lose weight. Be happy you have energy and are healthy.
OMG THE BELT AHAH
I FEEL YOU GIRL
What do you mean you can’t dance
As an underweight dancer the dance thing isn’t very true, i love you moved tho! Lol
fat people problem, you look fat
Really relatable
I thought the sitting down thing was just me, Nobody understands when I tell them
Why is that meeeeeeeeeee
jayus my dear you are 6/2  and skinny that's good me 4/11 i think? and also skinny but the thing is iam short you don't know how much bullying us shorties get even tho i like being short but people are f@cking.  !d!ots so enjoy your life dear don't get caught up in these normal things  .... btw love your videos 😚😚
Oh my fucking god thank you!
What do you mean you can't dance those dance moves what on point ✨✨✨
Thems some moves idc
you can dance amazing 👍
OK the fact u can't dance has nothing to do with your being skinny... u just have bad rythm skills
idk what i just witnessed but id say its pretty entertaining and factfull
YES YOU CAN!!!!!! 💃🕺👯‍♀️💃🕺👯💃
Relatable ✊. It took me so long to poke holes, and try to heal my metal health from people.
Medium sized person problems :  #1 insecure
YESSSS THANK YOU, my sister is like " Eleanor stop being so skinny " my reply is " I CANT BE MORE HEAVY   " dude all i eat is just junk food so you know
FINALLY SOMEONE FUCKING GETS IT 😀
You say you can’t dance and you danced really good I wish I was you I am plus size
I can confirm this. No, I'm not skinny or tall, but I have a brother thats built like a tree you see at school. Those really thin ones. He's taller and thinner then my entire family.
Me who’s built like a twig: nothing could be more relatable
yeah this is so true… when i was little i used to be wayyy under the average weight for my age but im finally starting to get into a healthier weight!! (also the clothes not fitting one is so true 😩)
dancing is an everybody problem
So true
I feel ya
Yo, I'll trade you my 5'6" curvy ass antime. XD
I know- I’m sitting over here frozen with people asking me if I eat with me being skinny and I don’t eat a lot at school cuz my medicine that I have to take so I can pay attention at school makes me not hungry a lot so yea
As a skinny person who’s been dancing for 9 years, I think I can dance 🤔
all true ( from a fellow skinny person)
Sameeeee i always had to put the new holes in the belts 😭
I think the last complaint is on you, lady.
As a skinny person with the skinny body type. I CAN DEF APPROVE ABT THE ASS BONE CHAIR and literally everything else
Those things are true fr 😂 Add to that, sleep on the floor and wake up with bruises on your hips 😂 and people telling you you will blow off the mountain if there’s a strong gust of wind lol
You never got “i wish i had you metabolism”, i eat as much as i want and crap as i want and i dont gain weight
You forgot:  - "OMG!! You look like a skeleton lmao" - "Ewwww! I can see your bones 🤢" - tries to circle your wrist with their fingers - "If there was a bit of wind you would fly away LOL 😂"
Sadly true
I’m skinny af and I’ve been talking dance classes since I was 3. I’m 14 now. And I am an OK dancer but I’m thinking of quitting bc it’s killing me. I have BACK PAIN
I get it, people are always like: “omg I wish I was super skinny like you!” It’s not actually that great being super skinny like you!” Being super skinny sucks in my opinion, I have always been waayyy to skinny, and all these things happen to me. I can never gain weight and I actually get made fun of for my flat skinny body. It’s scary to me to see my ribs to 😂
yes unfortunately this is something that I can definitely relate
It's all fun and games being super skinny, until you roll down the window and you freeze to death before flying out the window like a McDonald's napkin.
my problems are finding bracelets that fit my tiny wrists
“I can’t dance!” Me: well… you dance better than me 🤷‍♀️
better moves then me-
I can confirm on so many levels
This is messed up
Wish I was skinny still-
Yes
You weigh 64 pounds i weigh litally 20 pounds
Everything is true but I can dance very very well. Not that tik tok dance shit acutally dancing
No, you can definitely dance!!!!
6e
Yesss and I hated the push up tests in P.E. Because my tailbone hurt way too bad
Omg so relatable
Yes this is all true
Bruv I relate to all of these ESPECIALLY the dancing one. I do hip hop but I hate the way I dance because I look so stiff 😭😭
Have the exact opposite problem
Omg this helped so much I’ve got so much of this cräp
“I can’t dance”  Wdym ur dance moves r ✨amazing✨ And also as a RLLY skinny person I can confirm this like the comments ppl make to us r so messed up
Yeah I understand you aren't  skinny too
I relate to every one except 5 but the first one and the third one are defo tru
Yessss lmao
I'm skinny, and I got a special belt that doesn't have the holes. It's like a bus seat belt to adjust as much as I want it to.
I think the last one is just a you problem
I hate that cuz I'm skinny everytime I go to bye jeans or new clothes I have to go in the kids section
I can relate so much as in im 13 and i weigh less than 70 pound also the belt on made me laugh
I DEAL WITH ALL OF THIS. People are always like: 'I can see your ribs 🙄🙄🙄🙄' and 'It's not THAT cold' and 'Why are your pants falling down? Do they not fit or smth?' and 'Why do you dance like that?' As a 5 yr old I thought it was normal for all this :)
I’m skinny so getting cold for me is VERY LIKELY
Same girl!
Literally me
i recently lost like 20 pounds and one thing that annoys me is MY ElBOWS KEEP HITTIN MY HIP BONES IT HURtS-
literally relate to everything i hate it i’m very insecure and all I wear is sweatpants and baggy mom jeans also completely relate to the dancing one
I can relate
As a skinny girl everyone calls me fatso but I can't gain weight
“cant dance” laughs in ballet
My ass bones still bamboozle me sometimes. I sit down and immediately stand up and look to see what I say on bc it hurt. Nothing. I sat on my ass. And it stabbed me
the most annoying thing about being skinny is finding pants, more specifically jeans, that’s why i always wear sweat pants with draw strings lmao
Yeah I 105 and I am 14
I can’t dance better than me
Sameeee
It’s so hard to put on weight, and then being called skinny is kinda awful
Your living my life rn that's so true
I get told every day that I should eat more. In reality I eat more than them I just have a fast metabolism.
As a skinny af person i can confirm (since im skinny im allergic to the cold 🥲)
Love your dancing
i can confirm the bruise on ribs part cuz i do gymnastics and it hurts af- THE TEACHER THINKS IT'S AN EXCUSE
This is comfirmed
omg yes i get thisss
You dance better than I do.  *B R U H*
Okay but is laying on your stomach actually comfortable because I have always hurt my ribs doing that-
Relax you ain't even that skinny. You're more slim, IM SKINNY 6'0 125LBS.
I dance like that too its kinda sad
God story of my life glad it’s not just me
The first one is the most true thing ever.
Did that just say 62 pounds or kilograms
i cannot say how relatable this is
ill confirm this as a skinny person
I feel the same
As a fat person I do not understand what so ever
I resonate with all but number 5.. considering I was the weird kid in school so no one approached or spoke to me to say anything about my size lmao .. actually it's probably also because I always wear two jackets because I'm always cold. Which makes me look bigger. Huh.
Society: “you look so pretty” “I wish I were you” “you should be a model”
I am skinny but how resilient and instalated I am now confuses me
I am o skinny person I confirm but I am I dancer so a can dance 😂
Bruh those moves are way better
Imagine being mad that you are skinny
Lol I’m skinny and I get cold SO FAST. I will never survive in a cold place.
That me dancing
I would way rather be skinny asf then being called fat
Guilty😮‍💨
Being called a stick or skeleton man at 16 i still get it and it sucks
I wish I could relate.
I’m glad SOMEONE FINALLY talked about skinny problems! And I know people are probably thinking “oh Skinny privilege” but u try hearing “oh ur so skinny u look like I stick” Every. Single.time.u.say.ur.done.Eating! It fkn annoying and it hurts!!
This has to be one of the best and most informative "short" on YouTube!! As a skinny woman I can confirm all of what you have said....except about the dancing....think that might just be you 😏  But why the fuck do people think they have a right to comment on my size? Comments of "omg! You have lost weight!" Or "Are you sure you're eating enough?" Or even just "look how thin you are!!!" You wouldn't go up to ANYONE and say "OMG look how fat you are!!!!" I'm also the mother of a thin daughter....and have had to deal with over worried health visitors and THREE teachers questioning my then teenager about her having an eating disorder!! The damage that alone could have done to my daughter doesn't bear thinking about!!! My darling daughter was even questioned by midwifes when she was pregnant because she wasn't gaining weight.....every woman might think she wants to be thin and feels that she has a right to make comment about a thin woman but just stop!! I wish I had meat on my arse, little layer under the ribs so I didn't bruise, to feel curves instead of bones, just enough to keep warm or to not hurt no matter how I sit or kneel or just enough to stop people making cruel comments about me....these so called jokey comments have made me hate my body shape, made me cry as soon as I got home and see how horribly double standard it is when you're thin....I don't want to hear what people think of my size because I would NEVER make comment on someone else's body type, would be nice to hear how good I look in something... Wonderfully said!
why do i have a bruise on my back? oh i skate... wait i havent fell in over a month oh yeaaaa heatwave and ditching my bed bc its too hot
I’m not even 14 and all of these are true
Thank you finally someone who actually notices all these problems
Making new holes in belts is my everyday life 😭
"I cant dance" Oh do i got a good place for you to dance, Jayus
Yes yes yes...
This is so relatable
Me too was always around 120 5’5” and then got cancer and now I’m 100. Years es bony butt and baggy butt are my names
You got better dance moves than me   I’d love to learn your dance
I seriously confirm
Dude all of these are so true!
Same things for me bruh
almost everyone can dance 💃
Slayyyyyyyyyy
It's better than be fatter than the middle
Idk what you mean “I can’t dance” that dance was gorgeous, slay🤩
You forgot to say everyone calls you flat
Oki
YES FREAKING YES
I’m a skinny and tall dude and it sucks sometimes 😭
I am 32 kgs or 64 pounds, I eat 3000 cals per day and still am ultra skinny so I can confirm thus
I relate to this so much 😅
Sorry to tell you but the last one isn't due to you being skinny
Saaaaaame
As a former skinny person these are true
FR, ESPECIALLY THE POKING HOLES ONE- LIKE BRO IM PRETTY SURE 2/3RDS OF MY BELTS HAVE RANDOM ASS HOLES IN THEM
“I cant dance!” *proceeds to slay*
Sameee
I weighed as much as you in 2nd grade
Also confirm this happened I got out early though now 14
I’m 79 pounds and in 6th grade
Don't forget smacking your limbs into anything leaves massive bruises on you BECAUSE THERE'S NO CUSHION TO PROTECT YOUR ANYTHING AAAA-  -A person who's on the fine line between of being underweight and average.
I'm skinny
I feel you, it is so fucking annoying being skinny. Don’t start with the jealously people give us skinny’s, of being to skinny. Not like I’m already insecure that my ribs stick out because I am skinny.
Same tho
I relate to this
This is the most relatable video on the Internet
Ik someone who is really really unhealthy skinny but like she’s the best dancer in my dance studio
I feel you
i don’t feel bad for you, infact i’m jealous. why do skinny people think they have it harder than being fat.
If you imagine everything being the complete opposite except the not being able to dance that thing stays the same unless you're the perfect way anyone who's overweight has the complete opposite problem how do I know this I'm a 12 year old who weighs 200 and something pounds I'm working on losing weight it runs in my family to be chubby and having a eating disorder and having depression don't help with that my eating disorders complicated but I can simplify it into this eating gets rid of emotions more specifically eating gets rid of sadness and when you have depression sadness makes up most of the emotions you feel so yeah I ate a lot and I still eat a lot buying work on it no seriously I went from eating five meals a day to only eating one or two and I almost never snack and I'm one of those people who considers soda a delicacy yes I know I'm very much overweight but I still mostly drink water how did I get so over with mostly drinking water and almost no eating cuz like I only overeat excessively on holidays where I have to either visit family or get up early aka Thanksgiving or Christmas why because I heard staying up late helps you lose weight and besides I almost never sleep anyway so Christmas morning yeah it stopped being fun once I reached the age of 10 my brothers are like yay Christmas I'm like oh Christmas for Thanksgiving everyone has this problem there's too much good food except for me being a picky eater can be helpful sometimes cuz I hate most Thanksgiving foods usually just the turkey I'll eat and my family hates turkey so usually we end up eating chicken which I love I'm still wondering how some of my family is able to eat half the chicken and fun fact I almost weighed 300 lb I've lost a lot of weight cuz I'm getting closer to 100 lb and my goal is 150 will this be easy probably not am I still trying yes am I still being called fat by my siblings also yes now it's like 1.31 in the morning I should probably go to sleep
As a skinny person I can confirm all this!
I’m lucky because I am fat as fak
I’m not even joking this is SO relatable. I litterally had to buy a belt hole puncher
I think the last one is a you problem every other one I can relate to tho lol
66 pounds???????
Thank you o my god I need to send this to my friends
honestly i love to see someone put it into perspective like this. like, i'm definitely not skinny, never have been, so i don't have personal experience with these things, but i've definitely received comments the opposite way (fat jokes, people saying i need to lose weight, a particularly nasty instance where my dad had me get a belt that was too big cause "we can put a new hole in this one for now, but i'm sure you'll grow into it"). but i have a close friend who's always been very tall and skinny and she's always getting the "too skinny, go eat a burger" comments, and i've seen the impact that's had on her. yes, being thin is often seen as the "dream body", but 1) it shouldn't be, body positivity yall!!! and 2) there's still plenty of fucked up shit people say to thinner people, and just because skinny is the "dream", doesn't make that stuff okay to say!!!!!
IKR
Yesssss this is the problem
I 101% relate. People call me a twig, I get so cold easily, wear a belt! No just leave me alone!
As a professional thicc boi i can say that we can't dance either
All of this is true….👁👄👁
OOP couldn’t be me 😂
As a skinny teenager it's so true especially 1 and 3 like i live in Ireland and it cold and even colder
"ya can't dance" girl, yes u can
I can really relate to the belt poking 😂
Try being 6'2 and skinny
Insults i got fo rbeing skinny: "Bro what are you? A skinny extension cord?" "Ayo, mans lookin' like she allergic to food." "Ha, stick. Lol."
You are vulgar and obnoxious
I can relate as a skinny person.
As an overly skinny person with a very unhealthy weight I can confirm
I am a 16yo who weights 35 kilos...
As a skinny person I can confirm this is true and while in getting shamed by everyone,  time to time their always like "OMg your so skinny and beautiful" BITCH IM SKINNY TO THE POINT WHERE U CAN SEE MY RIBS
That are the best dance moves i've ever seen
Im skinny so this is really relatable. In lock down I didn't eat and sometimes didn't drink
Ok but why tf are you so tall? The audacity...
Honestly your dance moves are 🔥
I went from skinny people problems to fat people problems
FACTS!!!!!! Except I can dance
That jam looked good.
Then people feel you to eat… like it’s not my fault my metabolism is ✨speedy✨
I can relate 😃
I love being skinny
Congrats on hitting your healthy weight!
me being a skinny dancer👁👄👁
I play soccer, and because I’m so skinny I look like a stick figure playing
There are 3 types of people: Those who are living heaters Those who are living air conditioners And those who are room temperature
As being a skinny guy I would like to date a skinny woman. 🤷‍♂️because I am a skinny guy I don’t know why that offends women just trying to meet my compatibility
*I relate to these problems on all levels*
I’m always SO FREAKIN COLD I would not say that I’m very skinny but I’m kinda lol but I’m always so cold MAKE THE COLDNESS STOP
your a girl. . . ?
YESS THIS IS SO TRUE! i eat so MUCH FOOD! and i'm skinny as a stick. i was taking a test and i finished and i was sitting and MY BUTT HURT!MY BUTT BONES ARE LITERALLY HURTING
A pro is that if my friends punch me it hurts them as much as it hurts me cause they just punch bone lol
bro this happens to me all the time
Im  kinda fat?! But i have fat on my  belly and my thighs- fr! Skinny people are lucky-  i get hot, i cant run with my diddies be like SHWAMP SHWAMP SHWAMP,  my thights rubbing against each  other wwhich it hurts!💀
As a skinny kid i get soooooo mad everyone says do you eat? Eat rice,carbs and other shi* i just wanna say eat bs you peace of shi*
I UNDERSTAND WAY TOO MUCH
Which do you prefer? Hot🔥 or Cold❄️  If you’re thin, you get cold easily If you’re overweight, you get hot easily
The last one is a cap🧢 You can dance!
My belts never fit
I relate to everything you said
This is the most relatable video I have ever seen
dude i’m fat and belts are always too big. like idk do the “belt manufacturers” things that my waist is thirty feet wide?
I never related to anyone more than you 😂
Can’t dance? I think that just you! Lol  But me too…🥹
This is soo true! Somehow people think it’s ok to call a nine year old a skeleton or anorexic when they don’t even know what that means!
As a skinny person I can confirm it’s true all of them
Sooo im 5.1 in hight and i am 43 kg im 12 years old i dont have any muscles i have scoliosis and i only have bones as my hands so i can confirm this
LITERALLY THOOOOO
The “get some meat on your bones” is so relatable
In elementary school people would say I looked like a stick, and I still do. That insecurity has lived with me since and it hurts. I want to gain more weight so I can be more healthy but I can’t put on weight that well.
it's so hard being society's standard of beauty :'(
Im fat and still can’t dance
Watching her dance made  my day 😭😂❤️
Same
"we can't dance!" Me: so does that include ballet dancers? 🤔
Ok whoever said you cant dance straight up lied, cuz you really slayed out here
Can relate right now
Win I got a lit al wayt my ant sed you finally gayn some wayt it is ducks up tho tel me 2 ties ago I was 9
Love it when people tell me to just eat more, and im just thinking 'tell that to my metabolism thats faster than an Olympic sprinter'
Lol
That's so god damn true:')
I have to buy youth size safety gear for sports because adult size wrist, elbow and knee pads don't fit.....
I was always skinny, but super sensitive to hot weather, as soon as it gets a little warm, I'm sweating lol
the society one is so true my mum tells me ill turn into nothing and stuff and it doesnt help 😭💀
Lol I'm 10 and just 28 kgs while everyone is 34 kg-- this is so relatable--
Yep would eat until I threw up trying to gain weight 😭
cold one I agree with which is why I date girls a little more heavy than me for a blanket
Yes yes yes, hello fellow skinny af person
"skinny people can't dance"  ballet dancers: 🤡
Person, WHAT WAS ON THAT SCALE?
I weighed more than you when I was 8
I can confirm whole heartedly, you can feel all my bones, my bones always hurt, the cold is a lot to deal with, and the COMMENTS “you can eat so much and never gain weight” “you have chicken legs” “we gotta put some meat on your bones” stuff like that just makes me so insecure
I’m very skinny, and I can relate to everything you listed
The one about being cold is so accurate
I can relate to all of them
See, I am the exact opposite.
Saaaaaaame!!!!!!!!!
No one in the world can do a real dance
The last clip is my cat trying to get the red dot
Her: skinny can't dance Frickin k-pop female idols: *ITS MY TIME TO SHINE*            sorry I'm not skinny shaming them,but Yuna, wonyoung Lisa and more...
Looking at your bikini photo, you never had a low weight issue. No bones showing. You actually looked an ideal weight. Stop thinking you need to be heavier. You are from the US, and like here in Australia, the “Average” is now unhealthily overweight. Just stay your awesome self. Once you hit 50, the weight will take care of it’s self, and you will appreciate all the years of no joint damage from extra weight.
Didn't you say the n word
Yup! As also a skinny person I can relate to all that she said. 😅😊
I can NEVER gain weight and all of these are such bad problems omg Also I agree with how people telling you to “eat a cheeseburger”, or “you’re gonna fly away with this strong wind”, or literally anything having to do with being skinny completely made me insecure as a kid.  Oh and when I got to high school I was called “flat” because I had very little booty back there and my bust is much larger so people would say I looked like the letter “P”  Now I’m well balanced in that department but holy shit those comments made me hateeee myself
for being a fat for a life (being one is not fun) you sweat and be warm all the time its burning we sometimes get choked by our fat also they say eat less but that doesnt work. pants doesnt go in and i cant dance
Its all so true lol even the last one
Yeah um whenever its windy out everyone's like "dont blow away!" And it hurts 😕
its oki same stuff happens to me
Let me just say. The belts with holes throughout the entire thing have saved my life
don’t forget the knee pain from sleeping on our sides
I think you're great at dancing I'm much worse than you are try being a small giant
No matter how much you eat it will always look like you never ate....
I am very skinny and I can never get any clothes that fit 😅
Oh the society when they see my brother they be thinking that we don't give him food. But the thing it's he eats a lot !!!
Im skinny as _ and this is the most relatable video ive ever seen
I got so excited when I finally broke 100 lbs😂
this is the most relatable video ive ever seen in my life-
i know the pain
Oooooo yea i know👊
Too skinny and people tell you to eat a burger.  Too fat and you’re told to lay off the burgers.  But there seems to be no middle ground.  #DoubleStandards
These are all so true. Can anyone else see their ribs when taking a shower or something?
she can't dance  THE DANCE :  yo but still...... l'm sure every skinny ppl became fat after covid.......coz of shakes n burgers made at home
This is so relatable
All True...
I can confirm this I'm also a guy..
A life
Alright someone help me carry this box  Me: oh let me help you No its ok its probably too heavy for you 🙃
Im the total opposite of you, I’ve been over weight my entire life, i have a thyroid issue, I was always made fun of for some reason, my weight, my skin color, my hair, my teeth, it sucked, but even though I’m over weight I still get super cold lol
I’m someone who’s always been skinny and this video makes me laugh so hard whenever I see it.
That dance at the end made my day 😭
So true and it might be sad that u can dance better than me
All are true but not 6i am big and can’t dance
My mom be telling me that the air is gonna take me
I relate to all of these especially when people would comment on me when I was younger, my grandpa would always complain about how skinny I am and try to get my dad to FORCE me to eat more at dinner, and another time i went into take your kid to work day with my mom so I could see my past teachers (she works for my elementary school) and all of them said first thing:” Oh mY gOD sHEs StILl SO sKInNyyYyyyUyYyyy1!1!1!1!!” 😑 (also pls don’t tell me it’s a complement, I’ve struggled with weight all my life so it isn’t a positive thing for me to be under weight)
I am a tooth pick
Very true 😂
Lucky
She can't dance and passes off the black community? Oh boy.
You have to poke new hole's in your belt. 😂👌💯
I always got you need to eat a sandwich and the only type of dance you can do is ballet
Wait hold up, jay is a girl?? I just found out
I think that last one’s a personal problem
You get cold really fast. -nope. That's a girl thing. Fat girls get cold in the summer.
I think you can dance…                                                                     Kinda
HOLD ONNN you just confirmed my guess like i have a skinny brother and he has zero ass and i was like damn how you sitting? doesnt it get hurt overtime
I don’t think the fact that she’s skinny is the raisin she can’t dance
Yo sameeee
Love this...the struggle is real...
Damn so true except I just found the comments funny. I’ll have the last laugh you obese bitch, while I might need a Big Mac your one away for death. This is a joke, except the part about me likening the comments. They are just funny
ALL OF THESE. YES.
can relate... got to and held 72kg at the end of my teens  and i was very happy finally not geting those eat more eat mroe ccomments everyday....fyi im 2m so thats a bmi of 18 :D         (only every week or so lmao)
Can confirm.
Yuppie me to💀
My grandmother everytime I saw her it was, "God, you're so skinny."
Woman- i feel your pain and can agree with all those statements (especially the dancing and always being cold part cause, neither can I dance for shit, I can't not be could for a dam minute ;-;
Can confirm
I can confirm she is correct
bro you are an excellent dancer
I'm skinny ad uea I can relate plus I get cold super quick and at first my family  used to make fun of and I didn't mind xuz ofc I knew they were joking but them my cousin started saying this like every single time it got annoying!! But yea it's been along time since someone told me I'm SkInNy
Try being a 6’4” guy weighing in at 118 lbs as a High School Senior. Not fun.  At any level.
As a skinny person i can confirm to all of them 😑😂😂
I love your body . It’s sexy !!!
It's not about being skinny . U r literally a woman in a guys body . A typical Justin Bieber teenager .
That's so true  It's f***ing annoying  When society says: u don't eat anything..."but I eat 5 plates of rice I'm still 26.1 weight at the grade 6th
My little sister is extremely skinny, like you can actually see her bones poking out of her skin. And our whole family, cousins and all are very fat. So we tease her, but we don’t body shame her and all
As a little kid people always told me those things. I really don't understand why people comment on kids bodies at all. Let them live their childhood without having to worry about the way they look. Their still little.
Yep, all facts 🥲🥲, skinny life
I know, I know very well 😂
I feel u girl
My boyfriend literally thinks I’m getting beat up when he sees my bruises and he doesn’t believe me when I say it’s just from laying down
The one I always got is “omg your a twig I could snap you on half”
I've always had the opposite problem.  When skinny people tell me they'd love some extra weight, I always offer some of mine..
My brother has a very high metabolism, so he always got those comments you mentioned, and he always said, and I quote, "Bro... My brother is right there. He's going to punch you..." If he got uncomfortable. (And yes, I would punch whoever it was if it continued.)
As a skinny person this is all very true and the worst part is the skinny shaming cuz it's aggravating being called a twig (yes I've been called a twig and now I take it as an insult)
Did you work at BBY?
Especially people's comments is the most torturing thing like they dont know how the body works😑
Sorry but you seriously just aren’t eating enough. I can make any client’s weight skyrocket when they realize they really aren’t eating enough food to be complaining from lack of weight gain.
This is the first time i realized I'm actually skinny , coz I've heard it from people but i never believed it but yea now I kinda see it 😭
thats so me
As a friend of some other skinny person, that last problem probably IS because of being skinny...
I understand this one
Bruh same... I was like 53 kgs... And had all these problems...  Now 4 years later i am like 85kg and have the opposite problems (except the belt one cause my middle section is still thin af so if i don't have a belt on the jeans will still alide down and get stuck to my ass ...🥲)  Also to all the skinny folks...  U gotta eat big to get big And also hit the gym like 3-4 days a weeks
The dancing bit hit home HARD 😂 comments on my figure as a kid have honestly created a complex for me to this day, like cheers for that, people! 👌
Naw you can dance fine
YAY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS ME!!!
Don’t forget about how we can’t do a sit-up on hard floor with out our bones crunching to smithereens
Truth
I feel you, I am 6'3" and <150 lbs of nothing but bones
True I get made fun of just because I’m skinny
"I can't dance!"  *continues to dance* /j
Somebody needs to take this boy to a health food store and get him some gain weight 👍🏼
Idk I mean I like those moves! Bust a move!!
My dad tells me to go east a cheeseburger all the time, and im 28…… never been over 160 lbs..🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ and thats at my heaviest🤦‍♂️🤘💪
I had to poke holes in a belt too, but for the opposite reasons🤣🤣🤣
Can’t dance? C-walk. Oh wait you’re afraid of getting shot,right? No hate.
I have never seen a video so relatable in my whole darn life
I know the struggle all too well sis! Ass bones one is always annoying. And also the AC crap.
I feel for you, I'm skinny & tall af 6'4, 180 lbs
Same bro
You are very pretty
I just feel sad I can’t relate cause I’m 5’3 and almost 130 pounds at 11 yes old 😢
The being cold part is false, I know big people that get cold easily and as prior military infantry, being 5'11 210lbs at that time I was always giving off higher temp then others bigger thane me and sweat almost twice as much
This is rude how accurate it is, please stop(but don't) also I grew up in a greek town...and greek moms are like mexican mom's.
662 POUNDS! my American ass could never
Thank you
Same here 😂 I can’t walk outside without someone being like “oh my god are you malnourished?”
Finally, it has been said, I'm no longer alone in this cursed knowledge ;~;
a person once told me i'm a stick but then i called them fat
Finally someone who gets what it's like to eat and still be skinny
Well you're a f*ing liar... You CAN dance!
Nah you gotta just wear sweatpands with elastic waist or a rope thing
Lol I'm a 15 year old boy and I'm 55 so I'm kinda skinny and I still have most of those problems
The amount of belts that I stabbed is unreal lol.
this is painfully relatable lmao 🫠
I so freakin much love how you're dancing..I'd wish goin out with you for a dance or two.
I was always skinny and so jealous other other girls and women who had curves. Now I'm 44 and after 2 kids my body looks great for my age. Being skinny pays off.
Yep I have skinny problems too 😫
EXACTLY THANK YOU (but I'm still skinny as hell)
I wont give you a massage because you're too skinny 🙄 and after so many skinny joke I make fat jokes now hahaha
It's so true
Well am fat I have almost same problems
I'm also skinny af, and hate belts. Thankfully, Amazon has buckleless belts, and they are a pure life saver. Only $10 too!
Im 12and im 28 kg :l
Yep, all of these
I once saw a really skinny kid out eat me and my brother and we use to eat the equivalent to 4 full grown men
meanwhile, I've heard commentaries about my body the exact opposite of this.  "Lose weight. You're a lady." "Your eating a lot." "Did you gain weight again?" "When will you start your diet?" "You don't exercise that's why you're fat." "All those calories have gone to your thighs."  etc etc etc.
As a skinny person, I agree with everything except the cold part.. I'm considered a Furness so my issue is the heat
I've been fat AF and I don't mind, also even fat people hurt their ass bones on wood chairs
As a plump/fat person, nor can I dance without my belly fat fucking bouncing everywhere
I can relate
Yep I'm 6'5 and 170 lbs nothing  i can do i can eat all day and never gain weight  at all
being told i might 'fly away if a strong wind comes' is a weekly occurrence
You dance just fine
The end😂🤣
I was super skinny (mostly underweight) until the age of 22 and people would always be like "eat more food/are you anorexic/ too skinny isn't attractive/...then I started using antidepressants and gained a lot more weight...and now people go "you look better with more weight/ you look bigger than usual/are you going to the gym." 👁 👁...
Wanna trade weights? I will say tmi issues with being a little weighty
People don't realize how commenting on someone's weight just fucks them up, even if it's used as a compliment. Like I had random old people on the street look at me and say "awww yeah! I like skinny people like you!" Like what the actual fuck
But u are really beautiful no matter how skinny u are
Yeah I can relate to a lot of this. I’m really skinny and my doctor keeps telling me and and I was supposed to write down what food and how much of it I eat in three days. Funny how people keep saying they wanna weigh less but Im always so happy if I gain weight lol.
Girl you look amazing
I think you're perfect
As a skinny person. I agree with all of these.
I don't think being skinny is anything to do with those dance moves 💀
I’d take all these problems
Bro- I have these problems and yet I think im fat and hate my body.
What was that dancing
I spin poi and I joke that it's cuz I can't dance
10/10 can relate!
I understand the insults. Fat people understand too.
Yep same lol
Dayum I always wanted to be skinny and now I don’t anymore lol (No offense)❤️
That’s my life! But I still want to choose to be a skinny person.
Now i see why she is lesbian
Same
Relatable, also as a skinny person I confirm all of this, especially the meat on your bones thing, that crap ruined my life, enough about that I almost got blown over by the wind yesterday 😂
Can confirm.
Start eating 3000 calories a day and go to the gym. You're never going to put any meat on your bones unless you put in the effort. Your body type is classified as an EXO morph. Which means you need to eat a very high carb diet you don't really need to do much cardio, try some weightlifting.
Actually thought your dance moves were pretty good, no offense.
ive been eating like matt stonie for so long and im still skinny asf
My friend dad always called me anorexic to me low key hurt
I don't know man , it sounds to me you can dance pretty fine
Also you can't do situps without a cusion bc ur spine will dig into the floor and all the weight will be on ur spine and it fking hurts
The meat the bones ones suck cause then you do and they go you need to workout and be skinny like you use to be and then you do and it repeats
As a fat person, boo hoo. I'm always hot. Oh no, it's 70f outside, guess I'll go die.  We too have to put new holes in our belts, just on the other side.  We can also not lay down like that, mostly because it's like you have another you on your back. Can't breathe worth a damn.
Let's ignore the ending... anyways i was also skinny until i started exercising and now all i problems are gone and i highly recommend y'all to do the same
I don't know, those were some moves
Me same
I mean..... She dances better then I can
SAME 😭 The only diff for me is that i grew up in Canada... yall know the weather there...  then i moved to a warmer country so yh
😍
Their not wrong. All of these are true😂. Being skinny has so many downsides. But their dancing was amazing 😌👌.
i love how i dance the same exact way jayus does every single day of my life
You have such a beautiful face 🤩
been there
The fact that every single thing you said is true and my belt still doesn't fit and my mum doesn't allow me to put new holes into it
THIS IS SO FCKING TRUE LIKE
How much she weighs (i think it said this) 66lbs  Me a 10 yr old: 80+lbs
I think you’re an amazing dancer fuck it up
O well I guess I’m lucky I’m not too skinny
God this person is annoying as fuck
When I was 11 my barn owner told me to eat a burger or to eat more and I was like Bitch I do
I feel that
Still really pretty
So very relatable! I recently got my weight checked to find out I’m like 5 grams from being badly underweight and when I told my friends they all went “yep, that tracks” XD
Yes I have I realized no matter how you are or what you look like someone is going to have something to say! Just keep being you because everyone is beautiful in their own way!
I am the skinniest kid in my grade, I couldn't give my gf piggy back rides because I was a pole, but most people do say I give the most comfortable and warming hugs.
😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😨🤨😅
My partner is extremely skinny, (we are always fighting to keep him at the same weight because he still loses weight really fast) so these are total real problems we come across a lot
Relatable except the dance thing
I'm skinny and very tall. So yeah... this video was just my life as a whole.
So truuuuuuuuue 😭😭
as a skinny person my family literally says like “Bro if we ride that your going to fly like a stick off that HAHAHHA” they laugh like its not a problem
accurate
CLOTHES NEVER FIT. you bruise easily. my metabolism is really fast and i sweat through my shirts within the hour. every two seconds, “what did you eat today?” “you need more meat on your bones, you’re too skinny” “you look sick” thanks. i was unaware. i just consumed 3 mcdoubles thank you. i have to keep the heat on almost every day of the year except for summer (even then i’ll have it on sometimes) and trying to gain weight feels just as hard as losing it.
Lol, that was relatable
Let's take a moment to appreciate that she can dance way better than most of us
I FEEL HEARD
I'm skinny as well, not because I don't eat, but I cannot grow fat, no like, really. Also I don't really feel cold. (BTW I don't look like a skeleton, I'm just skinny, not fat, not a skeleton, just skinny)
Yeah-
Being skinned does not effect dancing😂😂😂
I'm fat as f!ck
Lol. I’m not skinny af, but I have the same problems now. Except I can dance.
You can dance
“Skinny people can’t dance” Everyone and their mothers getting sturdy
You're funny. Makes me want to try and 'date a skinny girl'. Thanks !
That last one is all you. Can't blame that on your skinny.
When you get an x-ray does the doctor just hold you up to the light?
As a fat ass I can’t relate I wish I was skinnier but also if your skinny I can give you some tips on how to Gain weight lol
I had that and I had no issues when they said it because I knew it was a either concern or j9kes
"I can't dance"  Nah, that was some fine white people dancing, don't worry.
One lady asked me at the grocery store what I did to stay so thin. I said I have a debilitating autoimmune disease. My ass hurts when I sit and it’s the middle of summer and am wearing a damn fleece, as long as I look good to you, it’s worth it!
She annoys me. Tf you standing on the counter for get tf down bitch
As a VERY skinny person, I can confirm ESPECIALLY on the forth and fifth
There is a common ground between yiu and fat people. They cant dance either
Fat people problems:  1. Sitting down is a relief 2. Laying down on my rips removes the ability to breathe 3. I'd rather get cold than sweat for no reason 4. Clothes never fit: I agree on that (belt doesnt fit? Who needs that anyway) 5. You should loose some weight or else you're not gonna live for long 6. Can't dance either but I can roll on the ground lol  That's the stuff my buddy said when I  sent him this video💀
I think the “cant dance” thing is just universal
I'm skinny to 13 5.7 weight 99 pounds now is it a bad thing no there's perks to it just like to be fat so no matter what u are u can do something someone can't especially skinny ppl us mfs can hide climb do alot u start blowing cold air we're as cold as Alaska
I’d rather be underweight then overweight. I’m 10 pounds overweight
Was the same even after children. There is hope. After 45 i finally gained weight
YeS my ass feels like bones are coming thru my skin.
Im 22 like you and I'm skinny too. So tired of body shaming from every single person around me....  🙄😈
I got every single comment from that and I get you 100%
Broo it's not funny. I'm 115lbs. I have a appetite of a cow and could eat 3 triple decker burgers in one sitting and people think I can barely finish a sandwich.
So true (I’m really skinny)
As someone who is incredible skinny, these are all correct. And I can even feel my bones through my skin, but I started eating healthy amounts of food and stopped being able to feel them as much but I don't really eat as much anymore, but obviously that makes me feel like in a fucking skeleton
We can tell you are a man.
Can relate
Seems like you can dance just fine👌
Well being a fat guy…I’d love to eat a burger
Dancing has nothing to do with being skinny. U can’t dance because your racist
I am basically the real slim shady so yeah i agree
My entire family said those things all of the time and no it’s not a compliment to say any of that stuff
As a skinny person i can confirm everything that was said here,  And if i try to dance i look like a stiff sock trying to dance
You dance better than me! 🤣
This is the content i want reaffirm my pain
Agreed
As a skinny person I agree. And ppl always saying "your so lucky" not really, no.
My parents always told me to go eat a steak or somethin
I love your videos
Bro I'ma a skinny too(male 5,11) but how the fuck do you weigh 66 pounds, you like 4,6 or something
I legit cannot. Not be skinny I try so hard to put on weight I eat alot
Also skinny *drat you fast metabolism* Some guy keeps calling me skinny as a chicken bone 😀 Like it doesn’t hurt me but he still shouldn’t because it will hurt some people
You need an ass to use a belt🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
her dancing was actually good ngl
Finallly someone says it!
On the dance note, you have potential 😂😂😂
Bro I’ve literally the opposite I’ve always been big I could look at someone and gain weight, being skinny seems like a blessing to me
Same girl same :(
What do you mean you can’t dance
Now do a fat people problems
Yup, pretty much spot on. And I literally had to put new holes in my belt a few days ago🤦🏼‍♂️ Also even with the new holes in my belt it still leaves bruises on my hip bones when I wear it.
I think im skinny as well but i have big bones so i look like i have right weight
The last dance had me laughing for a hour
The YouTube shorts algorithm is broken. I've seen this clip three times this year. So annoying.
Bruuuuuh I felt the belt part- I always have to add two extra holes in every belt I buy
... you want some of mine?
1- not having an ass is mostly related to being skinny, got that one  2- laying like that hurts fat folks too .  3- point for freezing 🥶  4- belts don’t work for a lot of plump people either . It’s a matter of how that body curves or doesn’t curve .. pants and shirts never fit or you can’t find it in your size  5- I eat 1/4 of the food my skinny friend does but society hits me with the save some food for the rest of us .. society will challenge everyone equally .. you’re too fat, you’re too skinny , you’re too average .. wtf?? People going to hate regardless
Nahhh, your dancing is at least above-average
Not being able to dance isn’t a skinny person problem.. I know tons of skinny (some skinnier then you)people who dance like water flows .. (stereotype incoming) that might be skin tone related 😂 .. as a bigger then average person .. my butt don’t hurt when I sit down but my joints do. Imagine you carrying another you all day long . That’s my normal existence.
Stan people spreading skinny issues, my dad is super skinny and while I'm not as skinny, I struggle to find pants that are long enough but also not too wide, I managed to find a really good belt that doesn't need holes poked because it's a different mechanism
"Why don't you eat much? You're so skinny, put some meat on your bones"and "What're you worried about your weight?"  Me: BITCH I WASN'T UNTIL YOU SAID I WAS😭😭😭
Your lucky to be so skinny
Your a better dancer than me
After watching her dance, i never felt soo happy today xD
Why is this so accurate💀
My brother was called as a baby from a family member as if she was "holding a brick" and its still really funny a bunch of years later
As a 90 pound teenager, I can confirm. Uh maybe not the dancing (as I have been in dance for almost 10 years)
No joke and when I meet someone new,   Them “oh my gosh do you eat you need to put some meat in her” or “do you feed here she just skin and bones” Me: I eat crappy food leave me alone
Some of this is true
I feel this
I am around 65 pounds I think and every one else in my grade were saying “I'm 90 pounds I'm super light” and I was in the corner laughing like “if your super light them I'm a feather”
I wish I had your problems.
Hey being skinny is my thing
I'm fat ass fuck except for my ass, so sitting hurts too, and don't even get me started on dancing.
I think the ability to dance is just one that not many people have
Heck, that’s me
I really thought it was just me about the sitting down part 😭
On my way home with my mom I almost got blown away by the wind, she kept laughing at me 🤣
Ummm, ok you can't dance but I don't think that's because you're too skinny 🤭
I watch your shit all day and it's fact, straight facts.
Your fucking awesome, mos def would be awesome to meet you
People are so look judgy. It's sad.
Shout out to all us skinny people. I am also naturally thin. I'm 50 and even my mother still makes comments. I eat well and often. It's a thyroid thing. I at all times feel like I'm being judged. I only go out a few times a year when I absolutely have to and I wear sweats. I actually felt so confident when we had to wear masks because it covered the thinness of my face. I went out more during pandemic because I could legitimately cover up in public without questions...
I can relate to this on a spiritual level
"I CANT DANCE"  *proceeds to pull off some bomb ass dance moves*
Last one was more so an everyone besides MJ problem
Imagine her at the dance club and let’s be honest I can’t dance either
Like, I get it, buttttttt fat people have problems with similar situations but x 2..
Skinny life aint always vogue photo shoots and skinny club meetings lead by paris hilton. Theres pain too 💔
Ugh I'm almost 40 and still hate the omg do you eat crap like I can't walk up to you and be like holy shit Sharon put that burger down fat ass or I will be burned at the steak for body shaming but it's cool I'm skinny say what you want
I don't think fat people can dance either, only like 5 people know how to dance.
As a super skinny person, i can confirm all of tgese facts. people are surprised that I sleep with a fluffy blanket all Summer.
I don’t think the last one has anything to do with being skinny. No one can do
Relatable
Bro this is my entire life
Godddddd trueeeeee
My pants don’t fit and I have to poke holes in my new belts,I am never getting a Gucci belt
Me too 😅 I'm pregnant and hoping that will change
Fuckin truth. Been a skinny guy all my life (6.2 and 145 pounds) Was in the Air force and got SO MANY comments about being thin. Its so annoying going to a store and NEVER havinv pants in my size. Had to get my uniform tailored and it wasnt cheap.
Yes this is true
The dance part just you I am skinny and can dance lol
So true. I recently started gaining weight tbh
All of that is so fucking relatable like it’s not even funny
FACT
Idk what your talking about best dance moves ever
Wtf that's not dancing
I'm chubby yet still have all those problems like what
Yes u can dance u just need help
Me too
Confirmed 😞
Bro those are some good dance moves broo! 🤣👍 Not even joking.
As a skinny person the cold thing is very common for me even in the summer time
The dancing one isn’t because you’re skinny…
Haha 😂  This is exactly me
Just eat more, lazy bitch
Dancings better than me though
Can't dance look at black pink especially rose and lisa
Omg same
And well
Yes you can dance
I am very skinny and people tell me all the time “you need to go eat” and I’m like “WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I EAT JUNK FOOD 24/7!!!”
This is the most relatable thing ever for me
Hold up, ok, I thought it was normal to poke in 20 holes in your belt my mum owns a belt punch for that specific reason
Try dancing as a fat f*ck. That shits hard.
(me as a dancer watching her dance)....you go girl. I- YoU gO gIrL
Just go to the gym bro .
I eat a shit ton like keep skittles on my desk eat a 1 meal and a burger ton and I'm still thin like thin you can see my ribs if i raise my hands i hurt my butt whenever I go biking with a hard seat
Me who's 16,fit(ya regular gym buddy😶✌🏻)n frikin 70kgs,, bruhh😂😂
My friend and I looks at each other helpless when we sit for long hours in the class and our ass hurts sooo bad!! We even planned to bring a pillow to school to sit😂but no we ain't gonna do that. I am Lil bit healthy now cause covid( I'm depressed sitting here for almost 3 years including time before covid due to exam) and people who see me always gotta mention that and be like *"oh you r quite healthy now, don't eat much maintain this !"* I mean... WTF 😒
I wish I was skinny agin so when I have 11 I was soooo skinny and when I turned 13 I’m like the fattest kid in the school
I'm pretty sure that's dancing like a pro.
Everything correct cept the last one
What you are is HOT!
Feeeeeeeeeel it except that i can dance... i think 🤔
What are you talking about you are an amazing dancer!
Dancing is literally me
I am skinny too. Your not alone gurl! 😅
You’re stunningly gorgeous 😍🌹
I can't dance either 😭😭😭
Did that say 66 pounds??
Everything you said is true and I am skinny yet I am highly resistant to cold temperatures. Also I feel as if it is always 80° or above.
Tights and stuff with no adjustment things are too big for me, so I have to thread string through them
As a 13 year old and being really skinny and short. It sucks that I can't do anything with it. I can't wear any of my favorite clothes, or wear anything that I like. But I can't. I hate it. So much. Plus the fact that I got made fun of it.
Weird exactly the same that's all I have to say 😂
Not skinny so can't relate, but for the belt thing I'll usually use those ones without the holes but with the two loops that you string the belt through, that way you can make it as tight or loose as you want, easier to take off and put on as well as to tighten or loosen, and that way you dont have to worry about poking more holes into them or anything because they'll work no matter what. Just a suggestion if any of y'all have the belt problem 😄✨
Lol I’ve been there. I’m finally at a normal weight for my height. (Had some health issues for most of my life that caused me to stay really skinny until recently).But yep been there. The worst more me was being too skinny and too short for the regular pants sizes. I’m 4’11” so on top of ppls comments, I had to argue with the jeans in the store on a regular basis. Drove me insane! Lol! You look good tho, don’t let ppl dictate what you think of yourself 🥰
Yes I can comferm this
I too am very skinny and a problem I have is, if I am laying down with my head above my chest my ribs start to hurt. Another thing is that I will tip over if I lay on the ground, on my side
Where Mufasa? He can teach you how to dance that song 🎵😏😌
👍 👍 ✔ 👍 ✔ 👍 ✔ 👍 ✔ 👍 ✔ trrrrrue
Wtf
Its all true
I relate but, 1; you're not a victim, 2; you're not a victim, 3; learn to stop caring what other people think. I understand this comment is ironic, but I hope it helps someone
Tbh at the age of nine I was around 76 pounds
Being overweight is 10x worse with temperature. You can always add more clothes but you can only take off so much until security asks you to stop.
Bro i have some fat on me and sitting down hurts my fucking as s aswell. On a fucking bed it hurts
Same but I also suffer a issue that my body can't make too many white blood cells I AM STILL ALIVE HOWWW???
So f***ing true!!!!! All of this!!
Lying down on the stomach is a problem for any woman. Like I don’t wanna explain it in detail but I think you can get the gist lol
Same bro
When i was younger, one of my friends was very skinny and she got packed barely any food so we always would give her some of our food, were not friends anymore but she looks healthier now (i see her around campus sometimes) so i hope things are going well for her and that whenever we used to tell her “eating just 1 pack of oreos isnt healthy for you” didn’t scar her too much 😭 aka i hope us trying to look out for her wasnt just us being mean 3rd graders 💀
I've always been quite thin, and it's horrible that people say stuff like 'I feel like you'll snap' like I'm perfectly fine leave me alone. Also, I'm somehow thin but I'm rarely ever cold. I don't have much of an appetite but my dad was always giving me extra food so I'd put on weight then complaining because I couldn't eat it. Also, putting new holes in a belt is very relatable. Also, bottoms with no belt holes or waist adjustments are a nightmare
i am 15 and 87 pounds
As a toothpick, I can confirm that all this is true.
Me laughing maf when she is dancing and I showed my mom and she said she looks like you when she dances and I’m like I agree with that but also WTF mom
Did that scale say 67 lbs? Do you have hyperthyroidism?
This is depressingly relatable….
Skinny person here 🙋‍♀️ These are all true
Most relatable video ever!
Oh, you can dance!!!! Truly, you got moves!🕺
Not dancing  well isn't a skinny pro lem lol
Maybe that's why i can dance
I hate being told to eat a burger or smth like that cause  Its just so annoying cause I really cant gain weight
I hate when err "larger" people say they wish they had skinny problems. Losing weight is literally inputting less fuel while burning more calories. Gaining weight is.... complicated 😒
I am skiny and i can,t dance ether
Doing sit-ups makes it feel like i break my entire back
The dancing one is mainly you so damn lengthy
jayus dancing is a vibe on god RESPECTFULLY.
As a skinny person I  can also say too also still got the moves
Being skinny is not that bad... being skinny-fat — that’s worse, all the problems of skinny people + you look ugly:(
Me fat af for my age but me be cold af
as a skinny person, agreed
Lucky
"oh your belt doesn't fit? oh you gotta poke new holes into it." Like dammmn that is so relatable...and watches too.
I mean most people who aren't even skinny can't dance either
I feel you girl 😔 even tho im not skinny
You're gorgeous as you are
So true finally someone
All of these are very true ppl just don't get skinny ppl
It was like that for me as well I'm still skinny asf
Tru af
Ughhhh why does this have to be so true, my whole life has been like this
Felt this. Can confirm this 100% as a being of 6'2 who only weighs 145lbs.
Stop cussing
As a chubby person I can't relate but I feel you
Me who's fat and wishes that I was skinny:
The more I watch the more I love your content.
the “society” one made me double tap so many times
And yet, I still wish I was skinnier!
Who can dance properly???
As a member of the skinny bitch community I can confirm and it doesn't help that our metabolism is fast as FUCK
Turn your life around around, except Jesus in your heart, and embrace the love of the Lord.
*i cant dance. skinny or not*
You are perfect the way you are but if you insist to gain weight, I got you boo!😉😍
That’s me lol I tell my friends when it’s windy I say “hold on to me I don’t want to fly away”
😭😭this happens to me like  EVERY SINGLE TIME!
This was so right
Welcome to the club
Sorry  but I don't think can't dance has anything to do with being skinny.
BRO I EAT SO DANG MUCH AND I DONT GET ANY MEAT ON MY BODY Also i can't dance, i basically got everything you said-
I used to be really skinny, and I can agree easily with all of these 100%
If this is not relatable I do not know what is
I can conform all of this, 1, 2, and 3 Are so true :,)
Do you want a dance lesson
People always say this to me
Someone name a skinny person who can dance please because I dimt believe the last one
Finally someone gets me
As a skinny person, I can confirm all of these are true. 😂
Lol same here😆💯
Leave with a southern family who eats soul food everyday ull start getting weight
This is me sadly
Can relate. I’ve tried to eat much much much more but that just gave me stomach problems every time.
I have all
The last one is for every one
When u were dancing I was dancing with u ✨✨😁
I can't dance- shakes boo||d||y hell nah dies with expired rat poison
don't worry Bella. none of us can dance.
The way she just explained me 😭
Yaaaaaaasszszs
110 pounds at 15 babyyyyy. Gonna be bulking big time later on
I know your weight did not just say 66 pounds
Another thing you cannot do crunches or anything like that because your spine rolls across the ground especially on like hard floor and it hurts
I wish I was skinnnnnnnnmnyyytyyyyyyy
that's why I put pillows or sit on sofa instead of a chair lol
I still wanna be as skinny as you ;-;
I naturally can't dance I try to but-
Preach. Please preach
Her I can't dance. Me go girl go girl
You are still pretty though.
Youre not the only one that cant dance
I was very skinny most of my teen years so i got a lot of anorexia comments and i am also a very tall person so it just made the comments worse. I also got this comment "you have a really big butt for a skinny person"....... Thanks i guess?
I can dance and im too skinny
hear me out, those were some pretty groovy moves
Am skinny. Can dance. U cap
If it makes you feel better, I am fat and still can't dance like at all, you would essentially be looking at a baby giraffe in roller skates
Maybe you would fly off to another dimension. You’re just skin and bones. Have you even eaten?                         -Society  And as a skinny person, it is tough in life
That’s me dancing in my living room 💃
For f sake my watch i got has to have a another hoke in it @aaaaaaah
I have the same problems
Try fortnite dancing maybe that will work
lol I'm skinny but it takes a lot to make me cold
Spine bones digging into stuff like THE BATH
♥️You dance fucking awesome♥️.
I am Skinny and i go through allllll of this...
The dance thing is a white person problem
I love your shorts.but can I just say you look exactly like Taylor from Hanson.
Facts
Bro I'm a bit chunky and my entire family has been for a while and I can just say laying like you have given up on all things facedown on the floor just gives my mind a factory reset man
Metabolism is so annoying, I'm either too hot or too cold all of the time and I hate it
I’m saying this as a Fan and Respect you’re very pretty and attractive  and you look healthy Slim. 😁
"I can't dance" proceeds to dance better than me
The last 1 was soooo FUNNY
Dancing is expressing themselves with music or rhythm you can dance
Hahah that dancing scene made my day
These are straight FACTS
Same thing that happened to me and still
Okokok hear me out… I think the reason that you can’t dance is because you are white. I’m sorry it’s just true. White people dance like they are a strawberry in a blender.
You have real a lot of confidence to dance in front of everybody in the world
Wait till menopause.  I was the same way...until.....now I had myself on the other spectrum.
My cousin has an extremely high metabolism so she is REALLY REALLY REALLY SUPER SKINNY
Stop complaining I WISH THAT I COULD BE AND STAY SKINNY LONG. As a once thin person, who is now not thin at all!!!!🤯😡😡
People make fun of me because I'm like heavily underweight for my height  and never Felt anything my sister always says I'm emotionless but it doesn't make me mad like dude I don't give a shit about your opinion
I agree lol
bro i have a fast metabolism so i dont get fat very easy and i RELAT TO ALL OF THESE😤🤣
I thought it was just me
Most of these I can confirm although I’m more muscly- skinny so I don’t really look skinny you know?
I agree with you
I’m 60 pounds and I’m 10 years old
I'm skinny and I can dance
I think you can dance good
She is 100% correct mostly the but problem...dat crap hurts 🥲
The last one was a lie girl u can dancers 👯‍♀️
Woman, we skinny. Fk the haters. Fat people die early. We live forever.
Jayus, you're GORGEOUS from head to toe. You look fabulous in that red bikini
This is litrally me
Bro, I wish I had those probs, big girl probs are like, way worse.
OMG SAME
There's a girl in my class that everyone would tell her that she would fly away because of the wind- basically sarcastically tellings she's a paper and a twig- but I'm skinny too and people are like - "don't you eat well?? Try to gain some weight-" like stop now
At least you're better than me 😅😅😅😅
My cousin has a friend thatWhen he briefs you can see his ribs, and I have a friend that you can pretty much see the bones on his legs
I'm a kid from the philippines and i'm really skinny and some people always say "do you eat a lot" and I'm always like "yes, yes i do"
Whatever you call dancing that is dancing there's no right or wrong way to dance
I have like 3 blankets on my bed
I skinny too and I relate to EVERY F***KING THING!😅and among other things LIKE I CAN'T EVEN SWIM!🥴
Yes YES U CAN CONFIRM THAT especially the getting cold
PREACH
Omg 🤣ok. Soo. Ma Man, Dance is supposed to be fun.  If you feel good while doing it. That is literally the only important part.🤷🏽‍♀️ Life is short, so jiggy while you can👌🏼
Got better dance skills than me
considering the fact that I dance like a girl like a greedy grandma that didn't get the last chicken bone you do it better than I do
Me too!!! I’ve been told my entire life that I look like a stick…and had to poke holes through like 10 different belts!!!
I have the same problems
I thought white people can't dance🤷🏾‍♂️ but fat people jiggle so it's close enough to cause confusion 🤣
Meanwhile michael jackson dancing
I was really skinny through comprehensive school but after a few years once I reached 23 all this shit stopped
Cutie
I can’t dance either
What? Sure i can dance 💃 🥴... turns out i cant
No offense but you think dancing is easier when your fat no it’s a lot harder in my opinion
So relatable
I would've killed to be told I need to eat more as a kid, stop fucking complaining
Skinny ppl "problems" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yes
You should get tested if you have Marfans
Nah your an amazing dancer!
I love it
Im skinny af too and sit-ups grind my pelvis bone into powder.
I can relate, I mean have u seen me!?
Can dance better than me
true
Yeah... I don't think the dance thing is from being skinny
I can’t dance to
Says "I can't dance" proceeds to dance like the best goofball I've seen
Skinny people can still beat someone up though
I'm 95 pounds
Yeah, I’d say that six pounds is average for us paperweights
Facts. I'm skinny as crap
I feel this all on a spiritual level
My doctor told me to eat ice cream bc I was so underweight 💀💀💀💀💀
"I cant dance!"  *has better moves than me*
This is all painfully accurate…except the dancing part, I’d like to think I could kill it on the dance floor.😂
Atleast you can dance better then me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That’s just you I am skinny and I can dance just fine
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE IS ME, ESPECIALLY THE CLOTHES ONE AAA ITS SO ANNOYING
My favorite one was "omg I HATE you because your skinny"........
Ahha nah you're awesome 👌  i know the struggle
I can confirm as a skeeny person. But I NEVER get cold cause I had to get up and walk to the bus stop ALL of elementary at 6am in a thin jacket so I don't care bout coldness
Dancing fits so weirdly. I low-key thought I couldn't dance cause I was thin before.
As a skinny person, I feel like temperatures don't really matter, but I prefer the cold
7: people thinking you're abused and start calling your parents 😀
As a skinny person, i can 100% confirm
I've never seen such a relatable short
Im 13 and heavy as you.
To much swearing
HOW LONG YOU BEEN SMOKING THAT SHIT FOR?? WELL YOUR WHITE SO I MEAN HOW LONG YOU BEEN TAKING ADDERALL???? BUT YOUR FAR FROM SKINNY,  BUT SURE ARE WIRED UP ON SOMETHING!!
"Can't dance!"   Damn.....way better them me...
I feel you bro
When i was young i would eat a lot and I was not that fat and my money started saying "if you eat any more your gonna explode" so yeah that terrified me and now I don't eat as much 😁
Try dancing to doom metal it exercises the Nek muscles cause for a skinny human it is easy to dance to doom metal
Easy entrance to slam deep  but if you're thick/curvy you need to work your way in 😁
Bah dw, I've been around 55 kilos for 1,85 meters since I turned 17, I think its actually normal to be that light
Well she dose dance better then ngl
Kinda good at dancing
No you really can't dance 🤭
Lol its accurate im 6,1 an 3/4 and im freaking skinny as all get out and somehow im 145 pounds
Bro how she way 66lbs
Yeah this is all true especially the comments from people and I'm still a kid 😀
Lizzéerd
Relatable
I've always been overweight and still needed to poke new holes in belts
THE COLD THO
So true
You weigh as much as one of my friends
That's is basically me but cold doesn't exist
Found myself of in the mirror for the past two hours.some people are so god Dmn lucky I swear
I gained weight when being on a silicon supplement. Also healthy bones now, no visualsnow.
I like the dance 🥰🥰🥰🤣🤣
I feel your pain
I have saw you before
Everything is so damn true
Wait you are a girl?!
#relatable
I'm skinny too my friends tell me I have to eat ..I'm like umm I do eat I can't help that my body won't put on weight 💜
All of it is true
Bro I feel every single one of these and every one in my friend group does too
Same
and the "youre so skinny im not i wish i looked like you 👀😔💔💔"
The comments are the worst
Skinny problems are the worst I hate them
I’m really skinny and I have a lot of those problems to.
We’ll your a better dancer then me
The dancing is not do to your weight
I have a skinny friend named Naomi (or Luke) she (he) is so skinny she (he) can’t sit or get up and when she (he) stretches you can actually see her (his) scars and her (his) bruises from getting up and laying down at home and ppl insulted her (him) for being skinny like “yo I bet if I blow on you you’d fly” like that’s fucked up to tell someone who’s been trying to gain weight for 8 fucking years like those comments were not necessary for a 5th grader already stressed because of their grades ppl don’t understand sometimes that it’s difficult for some people to do stuff
Same
Same
Relatable as a 5’9 12 yr old who wheighs 110. IVE STAYED THE SAME WHEIGHT SENSE I WAS 10 AND 5’3
Ok but I didn't say the n word
Sameeeeeee lols
As a fellow skinny person I agree with all of the above, even the dancing one
I'm 10 and she's 60 pound and 20 or so
My ass hurts after sitting awhile it's painful but.... IM NOT skinny
She says she can't dance and then dances 100 percent better than me  🤣
We have the same life then but seeiously for the fifth one like its actually really mean especially when your a kid like-
I work in manufacturing and still get made fun of. I am only 4'10" and like 100lbs. I look like a 12 year old. Having to prove myself for the last 8 years I have worked.
I confirm this
As a skinny person I confirm
It's so annoying I think I have a good friend but I realize that they always tell me to eat more
Okay dad
Yep, I am skinny as fuck and the worst part is that people are like, omg you are so skinny ,you are so week and stuff, people are the worst, and also not being able to wear t-shirts and stuff cuz your scared that people will comment about it
Are you anarexic?
Yup
Me,  a skinny person, staring at someone telling me I need to eat... Bruh I eat 1500 more calories then the average person ... what else you want me to do?
I can feel u
Welcome to the club lol, though all my insulation is in my gut now, I'm skinny everywhere else dang it
Skinny has NOTHING to do with your inability to dance. That's just a you don't practice enough, thang!
Me skinny, me comfirm true
As a skinny person, I can dance very well even my crush tells me
Guess you should have grown up in the 80s.
Now imagine being skinny and short as a guy
being underweight runs in my family so i have it to, OMG THANK YOU! also we get so dehydrated- like i’m throwing up sick then drink some water and be fine
I, do not have this problem 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Same but im a guy
I am truly sorry for 1 of my friends
As a skinny person, can confirm, also was very self conscious of people thinking I was like not eating or something BC I COULD FEEL MY RIBCAGE WHILE LAYING ON MY BACK an it freaked me out but I mean I wasn't unhealthy so like-
You are better at dancing than me!!!
I am 13 and to tall and dont get very winter clothes that fit and my dad says that the hole time  I didnt have a but when I was  born sorry I understand😫😥
Naw I think your a pretty good dancer tbh
I know all these problems, especially sitting down and my ass is hurting 'cause of my freaking bones
I have been chunky and skinny. I have heard both sides. I will take being skinny bashed over the other. However, no one should say crap regardless tho.
Yeah, number 6 has nothing to do with weight. Just saying.
Yeah, the society wali problem is with many people  But... It's waayyy moree for obese or fat people You don't even get support or love from family Until and unless you have a really good and supportive family 🥲
I lost over 60kg, I used to weigh 153kg, now sitting does cause sore backsides lol
Skinny people rock. I use to hate it but I absolutely love it.
Yes thank you im 16 and skinny af people be diss af it's messed
OMG yess
Yes I agree I am skinny I RELATE TO ALL OF THESE
Me about to comment about how her dancing skills is a you problem  Nah I think she knows
Same. Im 41kg and im 15 years old .and i eat alot but still my body dont accept all of that
I can dance tho
that's all my problem  😭 finally
All relatable
Who doesn’t
Omg love your content
100%
Me who is skinny that my Bone looked but i eat Soo much even 9 times but when i burp i got back as a Skinny stick:Hi:)
I feel the same way...can confirm skinny sucks
Bruh have the same problems as you cause I get cold SO FAST
I guess I'm fat then
Ok I don't think you being skinny is making you a bad dancer I am not skinny and yet bad at dancing
When she said "We can't dance" I'm like: ur better than me at dancing CONGRATS BELLA
U can still dance better than me the only dance I could do is the floss lmao (I was a fortnite kid in 2018 don’t judge me)
I agree with the sitting on the chair, cold isolation, and the pants. It's annoying and the worst part is, MY MOM THINKS IT'S FUNNY! ✋😭
Facts
You can hella dance
They say they can’t dance (then proceeds to show outstanding moves) but I don’t believe they have seen a wet tortilla with arthritis jump around ( me )    Also some of this things that I’ve heard some people say to my skinny self are honestly just cruel and should be considered bullying.
Does that say sixty pounds
I’m extremely skinny I’m 14 and I weigh about 80 and everything is true except for 3 i almost never get cold
When I was really skinny someone said to me you need to eat I don't want you to die as well. It traumitized me.
i agree out of experince
Litterly my life
Very relatable
Get meat on you'r bones WTFFF
This is actually true and the last one is right for me and now I don't know if it was a joke
I FELT THIS
I still wish I was at least somewhat skinny
I'm glad others can relate to me! I've been skinny since forever and no matter what or how much I eat,  I can't gain!
If you think comments about being skinny are bad, you should have tried being fat, you would love them. During the high school I was fat, I couldn't run without people making fun of me, in sports I was never chosen because I was fat, and in the team that I eventually stayed I was always in defence because I was bigger so the balls wouldn't pass so easy. I was even affraid of taking shower in the school because the girls would make fun. And the names were really bad, every year someone would come up with a new one. And, even when I was fat and would be pretty could as well, It's not only skinny people.
I can relate infact I don't like sitting
I confirm everything, including the dancing
My step dad constantly says I thinner than a stick and I will blow away in the wind or that I should get some meat on me it probably started at about 12-13 yrs old and has only sort of stopped recently because the comments still traumatize me today at 16 years old so I decided to start putting in more effort into working out and doing more
Pro dance👌😎
As a skinny person I can confirm this is right
AIM IN JAYUS
I can’t dance
Yes,yes, can confirm. Also those shitty comments hurt so does you ass
Ahh the life us skinnys live its fucked. Eat something...your fridge dosent have enough food fuck you... argggghhhhh
Acu belt is the best for skinny people
I love how people say put some meat on your bones I eat food 24/7 there's no meat
IKR! People moan at me for being skinny. It's annoying...
Why do I find it so relatable 😢
I can agree im a skinny person and I approve all of this
It's more bad if ure small.....
When people would comment. That part was so relatable 😂😂😂.and the blet not fitting hurt😂😂
When I was thinner during my drug addiction, sober now, I remember how horrible it was when I couldn't find clothes I remember.I got so small at one point I had to where children's pants. Luckily I am short so the length was ok. I will say being thin sucked ,glad I'm at a healthy weight now.  My height is 5'3" I was when I was my smallest 85.6lbs, but averaged at about 95lbs & Now I weigh 128-132
im a bit fat but its i think better to be skinny rather than get your speed halfed
Last ones just a skill issue
Wow you really can't dance
I feel you I'm skinny to they always say eat eat even though I'm full
I mean she can't break the laws of thermodynamics she just doesn't have a big appetite and doesn't understand what eating a lot means
I think you're dance moves are just fine... Can see the flow in your moves... Unlike my potato 🤣
Been there
I'm not the only one then! 🤦‍♂️
Can confirm that this is true
Looking sexy as ever when you dance 🤣 I love it!! No hate cause I'm the same way. Even after dance classes for 2 years
nice dance moves bella!
Facts
I’ve seen plenty of skinny people that can dance amazing lol I’m not skinny and I can’t dance either
Finally someone who understands!!  I come from a family that's naturally larger in body so as the only skinny one sometimes people think I'm adopted  And I'm literally so tired of people telling me to eat more I like have a limit to  how much I can stomach and if I do eat a lot I can't move for at least an hour without feeling pain or being uncomfortable  And I get cold so damn easily I can't sleep with the fan directed on me or I'll wake up in the middle of the Night to turn it away I have to sleep with socks on cause I get cold feet easily and being cold is just so frustratingly uncomfortable
My ASS bones!😂 hard chairs are the WORST
All of those are true
I’d rather be skinny than fat like I am
Idk why but she turns me on 😳🙆🏽‍♀️
When you were dancing it made me crack up you could  be a comedian
Hell yeah. Im skinny as fuck and agree 💯.
Relatable
I’m am skinny and I can dance
You CAN dance!
I am that person
As a skinny person, The getting cold one is the most relatable to me, Because I'd be cold but my family wouldn't because their the average weight and not skinny as fuck like me so I kinda just sit there in the cold..
Ok… but we can get through the Igor spaces we shouldn’t be able to get through. Less likely to hit another car with your door
Looks like you where dancing just fine.  Own the skinny, I was skinny tell 45, now I gave to watch my diet to keep from being overweight.
All true except the cold part
So true its sad
My belt fits twice around my waste lol
Idk if the dance thingy was about being skinny or you just wanted to show your sick moves
I can't dance every body dance now *Does funny dance*
Word
Im also skinny lol
You can dance you just tall.  Lol.
So true ღ😅ღ
All of this is accurate. And I hate it ;-;
Uhhmmm, I love your dancing. It's on point with the music 👌🏼
Im like thinner than a popsicle stick but I can bust a few moves
I’m skinny to and I’m ten years old all of these apply to me except the belt and I can’t dance either
Lol the dancing
The last one it’s not that you’re skinny it’s that you do not know how to dance
About the dancing point, Michael Jackson was skinny as hell lol.
it's 2X if you're a boy
My cousin is a insane dancer she covers dance's  and she's skinny as hell when I hold her sometimes I feel her bones!!!!!!!!!!!! Her bones her bones !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and also she's like half the size oh my oder sister oh end we have the same weight I'm 11 she's 21! Well it's kinde because 5'1 and she has a friend that is 22 years old he is as tall as me she's actually tomboy so um don't judge. Oh and I'm glad that I'm average of skinny not skinny skinny because I love laying down on my chest if you find or read this comment and don't know how to pronounce my name just call me by my nickname Jade.😁
Im also rlly skinny and I can't do anything about it
I used to be like that
So true my friends will always tell me that my parents are starving me😑😑😑
The comments are rly fucked up
But you are still gorgeous 🥰
Ivd been skinny since i was 4 IM FUCKING 15! 🥲
Bitch are you telling me that i cant dance?🤣🤣
Bella: starts dancing  Me: stop please just stop

At least you're cute
Everybody says that I am small and skinny
The dance moves lol 😂 I’m sying
Goddamn you look like a boy
YOU ARE FLAT AS FUCK
The dance made me smile for some reason
AND WE GET CALLED MALNOURISHED 😭

She looks like 6'7
Thats me 😂
I am 11 years old and I am 23 kilos
Haha 😂
All I want is to be skinny☹️
This is the biggest damn IKR I can give
I have got a hella skinny friend and this is so true
Im overweight and i still cant dance
Im very confused are you a girl or boy? 😭
The bruises on the ribs was mad relatable tho
I have never been able to keep weight on, I'm one of those skinny bitches who can eat whatever she wants and not gain weight. People assume I have an eating disorder or that I never eat but I have never been able to retain weight mostly because I have Tourette's Syndrome. On average we burn 4x as many calories as someone with a similar lifestyle due to our tics and how our condition causes many comorbidities with hyperactivity as a symptom.
My ass is so fat I don’t have to worry about that
I HATE BEING SKINNNNNNNY IT SUCKS I AM LITERALLY SKIN AND BONES
Yep. Yeah..the dancing bit. Maybe don't do that.
So true skinny too all of those are realistic
No you absolutely can dance
As a chubed person I can not relate but I understand
As a skinny person, i myself tried eating more food but instead of the body getting fatter, its only the stomach 💀
My sympathy to u jaysus
As a hella skinny person, this is very true  Even the dancing part
That dance is best dance
I go through this everyday....and God forbid I gain weight All of a sudden I'm pregnant WTF!?
I agree but you are real fast
This video summaries my life
True
I FEEL YOU
I have been a 180or a bove since 12 and am now wight a 170 or below and am in my early 30s so how do you get used to it
I have been a 180or a bove since 12 and am now wight a 170 or below and am in my early 30s so how do you get used to it

I love you.

Omg yes
I’m right there with you I am 62 between 135 to 145 pounds I have to put rocks in my pants to keep from blowing away and some people have told me that I fit in tight places underneath the house being one of them with the job I do
This is cringe as heeeeeeeell
Dude!!!!! Fucking same....   I feel you homie
If your belt doesn’t fit just buy a kid belt
Same but you can dance better than i ever tried
Finally someone is explaining us skinny people problems
Some nice moves not lying
The dancing one is not a real problem it's easier to dance when you're skinny than when you're fat I know from experience
What if there's a gush of strong wind, would you not be scared? Free travel.
LAYING DOWN IS SO TRASH
Omg same
My mom would be saying when you were a baby you were so nice and cubby now my sister says I am a stick and she is right.
I understand I am still a skinny dude
Thats i feel
Zyzz: go to gym, have good diet
i  fully understand as a skinny person
I wanna see more of her, but also less of her....
Dancing... Is that a skinny problem or a u problem?
last one is just you.
Your an amazing dancer
Yes you can Dance thats awesome😂😂😂
Can't dance is not a symptom. You are just a part of the rhythm less nation. Chris Brown is skinny he dances well.
Bro im skinny and the society really really is a problem youre so f accurate
This is so true!
girl never have ever anybody said smthn so accurate dayum
I like you but you have a nasty vocabulary.
I feel u a lot especially living in a country that is messed up
Everything thing is true 😁 same here 😅
No offense but I think that last one is just you
Honestly you have a valid point. But I feel as though being fat is worse because you get made fun of more intensely. What do you guys think?
That belt one ...Oh girl... Sometimes pants are so loose that the belt stays on my waist and pants be hanging on loops for its life ...
Every day of Society
She: Can't dance... Also she: **proceeds to dance better than a armlegless child* 🙂
U got some crazy dancemoves
Accurate
And I thought I had a little too much fat on me (I am in a normal healthy weight though) but I have all these problems 😂😂
Finally someone speaks of my heart
on god bro people be skinnyphobic😂😂it’s a joke btw for dumb asses just in case
I can literally confirm this
You are Soo Cool 😎
My little sister is the same but she actually doesn't eat. She only eats when some else cooks for her or fast food
THIS IS SO RELATABLE MY GOD-
Try dancing while being fat it doesn’t work trust me
I got the same problem 😶
Maybe skinny person’s can dance but normal people can’t
Same here bro I'm 13 and I'm only 103lbs and apparantly according to my family I need to be 120lbs
RIP to my RIBS man…..
I know how u feel iam 6'4 and been the same way my hole life so I know how u feel shit sucks I hate being told I need to eat when I can out eat that person
That last dance 😂😂😂
All are so true LOL
I agree with everything
Bro I thought it was just me. Also can skinny people not dance because me nor anyone in my family can’t dance and where all REALLY skinny.
I have also been skinny my entire life. I have been told to eat and get some meat on my bones before. That just doesn't work.
I agree
yo same problems
You've been skinny I've always been chunky for all my life
I can relat

U can’t dance that’s sad 😢
I'm fat af
OK thw dancing problem is on you
Same, people used to make fun of my ribs when changing for sports
I have a very skinny friend. She sits on the chair then has bruises on her back.
The most sexy skinny woman i ever seen in my fuckin life🤤🖤
We may not be able to do alot, but we can sure as hell run super fast
Ok but the bruised ribs one was straight facts, it’s annoying as hell
Bro i been called that so many times bc of my arms like 💀
facts
same as you
Ah yes the worst sideffect of skinniness, poor dancing.
I feel your pain
I mean hey you can fit into a small room and other people probably cant
Try Ball room dancing love it's real classy
Ah, do not worry, I'm a bit overweight and 6 foot, and I still can't dance!
I feel your pain I'm in 6th grade and weigh 80 is but I'm the youngest still I'm skinny as crap
I can relate
You might want to have a good plumber on standby. And when your pipes burst at least know where the main shut off is.
As a underweight person I can confirm
Not being able to dance is a you problem
I think you can dance 🤗🙂
I Can't Dance  Also her:*Dances like a fricking lizard* What did i just see💀 Epic games:"Ty for the new dance we will make a new emote <3"
Don't worry even when I activate my inner fats or wake the fat God i still can't dance and even if i go super saiyain fat mode
My friends called me a stick through the whole high school dude 😐👍
Try water dancing. (Synchronized swimming) EVERYBODY’S SO FREAKING SKINNY *lol*
Im skinny
Facts!!
Bruhs i weight 35  and iam 18
Yup true
Even the holes in my belt don't fit anymore 🤪🤪🤪
Sooooo true
Are you a girl or are you a boy
I'm your subscriber beach is it
My coney beach you son of a beach
I’m to fat for belts
Facts
I felt all of this. Especially the ass bones one.
The comment on my weight are the worst. I've been medically underweight my entire life and I've been skinny shamed my WHOLE FUDGING LIFE but there is humor to it..everyone tells me to "eat a burger"...  I Hate Burgers.
Wtf was the last one
Michael jackson was skinny asf
Someone tell her she’s just bad at dancing
If you get pregnant it will change, you will soon get bigger because you're eating for two, and your breasts will get large as hell,
Do a video on how to gain weight cuz I need it
All true
I like skinny people
I always eat a lot but I'm still skinny 😭
The belt leaves bruises on my hip bones or circles around my waist if I cinch
I feel good being fat now
I can't dance and I'm fat
It doesn’t matter if you are skinny or obese, people will always have something rude to say
That dance is some Rolli-level shit
That music
this is painfully true, I grew up hating myself because i was really skinny. I didn’t hit 100 pounds until I was 13. It’s not like i was starving myself. I just couldn’t eat as much my stomach is just tiny and can’t eat as much. I need people to understand I eat a lot of food
As a man with no assatall disease i feel your man when you sit. Lol
I’m the same
Tbh I think u can dance :)
I can relate
I can relate to all this but I’m a great dancer so I think it’s just you
Feel ya
I literally cried so many times as a kid bc of number 5
Same i am skinny as hell
As a fat person I'm kinda glad I'm squishy ngl maybe too squishy but squishy
1st one is so much relatable 🙂
This is my life f****** story I'm skinny as f***
ALL OF THIS. YES! EVEN THE COLD THING, IT SUCKS!
People don't understand that eating more isn't always the solution. The metabolism plays a huge role too.
Trust me being a fat fuck isn't all it's cracked up to be. Should be glad you are skinny.
U got better dance moves than me u call that bad?!
This is so fucking true 😭
That belt thing is too relatable
Really because I'm skinny but in the middle of winter when it's -5 degrees Celsius outside I walk around in shorts and my wife calls me a human heater as she can't sleep next to me because of the heat generated by my body. Also 66 kg at your hight is not a healthy weight you should at least weigh 70 to 75
For real tho
Modern problems require modern solutions
Please tell me why this all happens to ne
Still better than me
Hey be greatfull BTW I'm fat tho lol
Ah so that y I get cold fast
The dancing part is a struggle because you have such skinny long arms and legs so it just looks weird 😭
Reminds me of me
Jayus: i cant dance : started bussin out moves that i cant even do :
"Skinny people can't dance" Meanwhile k-pop idols: 👁️👄👁️
I’m a Skinny person myself and this is very true
" i can't dance" i believe that's not only a skinny person problem bc i can't dance 😂
Ur good at dancing
For me you look normal lol
I wish I was like you
Me and my twin brother were also super skinny when pulled our T-shirt up we can see our ribs clearly one time there was rely strong winds blowing and we both were holding an umbrella then we went flying with umbrella till neighbour's house and our was like what the fuck
Tbh I'm the same
That dance would work on a party, if everyone are drunk
I have the same problems
I’m a Girl and i Weight 38kg and im 15 years and 159cm
as a skinny person myself.. this is fact
Your constant vulgarity is your most irredeemable quality.
Literally me
some of these are similar to fat people problems  Like clothes don’t fit, you have to buy large / extra large “Your shirt doesn’t fit? Then buy a bigger shirt. They don’t sell bigger shirts? Then loose weight you dumb-“  Society “My gosh, you look like a boulder, go on a diet! Men/Women/whatever you want to add here only like slim women.”  But the rest I’m not sure of
Finally someone who had the same thing as me
Bro I'm chubby and my belt doesn't hold my pants up
All of it is true except the last one you can dance
Me too girl me too
Why is this facts though😂😂 and you gotta add when playing basketball you get bodied no matter what But I’ve recently gained a lot of muscle mass so it’s getting better
as a skinny person,its a pain sitting on school chairs because its always made of either wood or hard plastic,my ass bones would hurt a ton and i wont be able to do anything about it
I feel your pain
im really short and also skinny
Same
THE DANCE IS JUST TO FUNNY I CANT STOP LAUGHING
So true
I'm skinny so this is true and I hate watches because of this
I’m 11 and I still get body shamed for being too skinny🥲
*sibling comes in the room during the dancing*
Relatable
I know but I was also very stong
Why is this so relatable like i eat like if i was obese but overall im becoming more and more skinny smh
YOU CAN DENC BETER THEN ME
I am 15 and 176 cm but i have only 42 kg
Noice........
Agree with all of that l. I’ve been told that when people hug me it feels like hugging a stick. That hurt😐
like about a month ago I was skinny I couldn't even go to the family house with my aunt grandma even mom and more being like wow your skinny and more comments lately i have been eating so much junk food that no one says that anymore and I honestly regret that
Fuck! it's true 😭😭. being skinny SUCKS
Same!!!!!!
I’m also very skinny I can relate to this
Fax
Dude ngl but those are 🔥🔥🔥🔥 dance moves
THIS HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY
Agree I’ve always been skinny
you can dance just fine tho but relatable
Pft sure you can't dance you got the moves!!
Well I’m skinny so HELL YEAH
I have the same problem's
Im also skinny af im 100 percent with you
Im never cold but Im still very skinny, I can go outside when it is winter in a T shirt and shorts and not freeze. Am i normal???
yeah this is true. a few months ago this boy started making comments about how my ankles and my wrists were “too skinny”. it actually got to me a little as well. then i told him to stop and he said “yeah but it’s ok because ur lip shaming me.” because i told him to buy some chapstick? 💀
Jayus: I can’t dance Me: Your still better than me
I get you girl. My middle school called DCFS because they thought I was malnourished, my mom's response, "he never stops eating, are you fucking serious?". After a very short interview they dropped all the questions. And yes, me and my daughter are considered cold blooded. If it's not 70+ degrees we are shivering.
As a skinny kid I feel the pain
I used to be skinny when I was a kid. They'd call me "Skinny Bone Jones" but it never really bothered me. I was a resilient kid. Now I get upset when I order hotcakes from McDonald's and they give me one pack of butter for three pancakes.
You can dance just not good🤣🤣🤣
Same here
I am skinny as Frick so this is agreeable
yes
I know all these problems it sucks🫠
Neither can I 😁

You to know my pain and I know yours
She blow away in the wind

Everything she said right here is fax cause I know because I am skinny
Same, I've been through most of the scenarios and I can't dance to save my life
Mostly no one can dance
I feel the same way because i'm skinny as fuck as well and i weigh 45.3KG and its cold in australia and im sitting in my bed wearing my jumper FUCKING HELL
.
I still don't know why my ribs stick out
This is true
I am so skinny that we could see my bone
Got a friend that's even skinnier, I swear to God he will blow in the wind like a tumble weed

God I wish I had those problems 🐖😂
Eh!!! You made so I don’t wanna dance anymore
Can confirm all but the last one (I’m a dancer so yea) anyway my mom got me a foot long from subway, ate it in 20 minutes and felt sick, if I eat to much food I feel nauseous and really fatty/ greasy foods make me lose my appetite
Fast metabolism people problems
66 POUNDS?
You can dance better than me
Same
And flat but everybody got there preference
Yes your spiting facts
This is the most relatable video I have seen in a long time 👏🏻
My daughter is very skinny too. She wears a jumper even in summer because she gets cold.

Fax
As a curvy person who have a skinny best friend I can confirm
I can't dance me that just wiggles like a spaghetti
My eyes
Painfully relatable...
You just said my problem
Yes, You CAN Dance!!!  I don’t see any problems with the way you dance.  Don’t let other people tell you what you can and can’t do.  I dance just about like that; whatever…I’ve have girls want me to teach them to dance like me.  🥰
True
This is all true.
Yes

Gurrrl I know the pain I've been skinny my whole life too
So fucking true
Me: being underweight Doc: is she anorexic?          Does she eat enough?  Like bruh I'm just built this way I've tried to eat more....
Very true
The can't dance is just you
Yes you can
Ur lucky I rlly wanna be skinny
Find a husband
You can see all your bones and joints poking out when you dance or put on a shirt
Feel lucky please. I was like you all my life until the dreaded menopause and now I have to think about everything I eat. It was much more fun to add holes to my belt and I have no idea what to do with big boobs, they are annoying and get in the way. You are blessed believe me. Enjoy yourself as you are...of course older people said the same things to me an I didn't listen, but really try to appreciate yourself. It's much better to be thin. Love your vids btw.
Weird because im skinnier than the Lego skeletons and i dont ever get cold
I can’t dance and watch I’m THICK
Yo i feel the pain
Well we have something in common. My dancing sucks like shit.
The last one is just a white people problem lmfao
This is true facts
That makes 2 of us about Dancing 😮‍💨
1000/10 dancing skills
Same thing with me I'm still young and people always say your so skinny eat and it just annoys me and a kid
I’m also skinny as shit
I felt this so much
I'm skinny, very skinny (ok not very skinny but a tiny bit below average) I can't relate to the lying down ribs thing bcuz I don't lie down on n god damn floor bro (but all the rest are sooo true)
Imagine I am fat and I still freeze the whole time
I know I a soo skinny
A common quote I get from myself all the time is “the only reason why you cannot do something. Is because you think you cannot do it” ~myself
I can relate
Your Lucky you aint me
I have been both underweight and overweight and dealing with being very skinny is easier. Society judges overweight people more.
Her: I can't dance Me: that's not a skinny person problem I couldn't dance to save my life
Yeah it's true
I can relate to the wind thing cause when I was in like elementary school and we were outside while there was a really big gust of wind I felt like I was about to fall over or end up flying in the wind cause even now my younger brother somehow has more meat on his bones then I do and mind u he's skinny like me
Its hard
I understand
I FEEL U
So true! The comments are the worse. Someone people would be like, don't your parents give you anything to eat? and the list goes on.. public shaming at parties..blah blah.. some people can't eat due to stress.. others eat more when stressed out. I think people should mind their own business..
Trust me better than being obese.
It is so so good to hear someone else say this stuff because I've been dealing with these issues my entire life. But the thing is the doctor says I'm the correct weight for my height and that I don't even look too skinny yet all these issues apply and everyone tells me too eat f****** burgers all the time
You Thick
F***ing relatable yo
I have to do a hiphop unit and I look like a stupid dancing skeleton plus I can’t hide my body bc the uniform is leggings and fitted shirt
I think a misconception about fat people is that they can't move fast and aren't strong but some of them are pretty strong. You can use sumo wrestlers because they have strong muscles behind their fat and they also eat healthy food.
Yep that happens to me
You can dance
This is why I am trying to gain weight and I have the same FUCKING problems
God dam her bone are so.. My body if freaking so hard like my..  I mean rock
I relate to this on an uncanny level...
She look pretty damn good in that bikini tho
Still get those comments
Yo can we change bodys
The dancing part is just a you problem not for others
Just headbang.
Me in the snow am not getting cold am not wearing jackets and am skinny am weird
The first dance she did killed me instantly 💀😭
I have a guy in my class he is so skinny, he is literly flat and even turned a little inside at the brust, he is tall and basicaly weights nothing. I swear to god, if this guy enters water, vhe will imidiatly fall down and walk under water. But he got air in his bones so he can swim
True same
Dances better than me…
My family always said for me to hold weight for I don't fly with the wind
As a skinny girl everything is true but I can dance
I'm skinny as allso so I can relate to everything in this video
Im also pretty skinny as I have a fast af metabolism, and for some unknown reason. My guess being grown spurts.. I am finally gaining more weight, as I went from 80 a few months ago all the way to 92, hoping to reach 100!
I am tall and skinny and my abuela from my moms side always body shames me when I visit her. She also threatened to take me away from my parents bcuz she thinks I don’t eat… it doesn’t bother me cuz she’s been crazy her whole life
So skinny problem and chubby problems aren't the same but they both have them....
Yep just yep
you are a great dancer
Thats sad but to be fat isn't better cause you always feel watched when you go outside, when people talk youre scared that they talk about you, when you go Shopping you Look around before you get the clothes beacause youre don't want that  anybody see the size youre buying and if you go to the doctor you are scared that he/she/it see your weight. I am fat since I am 2 years old and I was often short before to get Depressiv cause of this. I hope people stop bodyshaming!
The dance part is just a skill issue
Yo the ending funny lil 🤣🤣🤣
Sooo ballerinas are obease lol.  But yes to the rest
Me
6 foot tall, 140 pound male You just rocked my world with this one
The thing is I got a condition that I cannot be fat or like yearly you become fat I don't eat few I eat alot yet my digestive system is like fast as fuck so I can't really get some weight that's a skinny issue
Take up truck driving. That fixed my skinny problem
Go jayus go jayus go jayus
Same
Bro I’m probably younger than you and I’m heavier
Funny the belt thing is also problem for fat people xd
For some reason society is mean to everyone skinny or not.  Skinny:go get some meat on your bones and do you eat enough? Not skinny:stop eating so much. Go on a diet. Either way it’s not going to help the person only decrease their confidence and make them paranoid
Everybody calls me a noodle
I don't think not knowing how to dance has anything to do with your weight LOL
TRUEEEE
Do skinny people get the urge to say racial slurs?
Oh my god, people tell me at age 7-11 (11 right now) do you see her, she’s a twig, you need to eat, do your parents starve you? That’s fucked up!
I knew your pain
The pain is true. Cold very quick
I can relate to this I have a very high metabolism but I just try to form muscle to compensate not looking like a stick, sometimes that certain angles it doesn’t help
yes, everyone told me i was built like a twig.
I have a solution 💡 Muscle.
You are so true
I think you said every curse word I know in the first 5 fuckin' seconds XD Edit: also yes I agree with all of this
Same
Me too
Try being fat you think we have insulation but actually are heart doesn't care enough to give blood soon we are extremely susceptible to heat and the cold
Being skinny. Most of my bones bruise when I'm on them too long. It's sad
"I can't dance " her mom- one prob at a time sweetie 😂
All of my relative says get some meat and grow up
Same here bro
No my bff cabt dance
as a person w thicc tights, i need to wear a belt all the time bc jeans are fitting on my legs but not my waist. And if they fit on my waist, eventually they're uncomfortable as hell.
Yooo same fucking problem
Don’t forget when they grab your wrist and say their fingers are overlapping and you’ll break easy
How tall are you
*laughs in fat person*
All same
I have so many of these problems
I'm skinny asl this is fax especially getting cold
You have a pretty amazing smile though :)
The belt thing...💯
my friend's a skinny skeleton. he can grab his right thigh with his right hand, while his hand goes behind him. and also looks like a horror movie actor when he crawls
Short people problems but yet our mothers say when they are like 6’5 and we are 1’7 “Don’t get taller than me!”
You dance better than me. :,) BUT WHY IS THE IS SO RELATABLE WTFFF
I thought the scale said 66 for a sec 🤔
Same 😂
I don’t think being skinny has anything to do with dancing
I like your dancing Jayus 😄
Us chonkers also can’t dance
...pretty sure that dance was dance...
I had all these problems except dancing (I am a fucking god) but I just got fat idk how I did it but I wish I could go back and fill that fat up with muscle
Why did you cut your hair tho???
I am super skinny like m just bones and no muscles and sitting makes my hip bone poke my butt and it feels like someone is tryna fuck me but can't find the hole
Dance was cringey
I am pretty skinny and half of these are true but I can dance let me just say that
Damn girl me and you share a lot of issues, can't dance for shit either....😭 im hospitalized as i type this because i lifted something super heavy almost broke my back in half. I have bulging disks on my lower back and I've been laying down in the same position for over a week snd i have many points on my back that hurt from laying on my back
12/10 dancing
As a fat person I can't dance either
Top tip , braided belts
This not skinny probs this is your probs
10/10 dance skill
Too relatable 😂 Also the cold thing, yeah, that's why we have a lot of blankets at home😅
Me and you can’t dance for shit                                  Because we’re white
As a 14 year old that weighs 92 pounds and doesn't work out I can confirm
Lol we are the same then
YOU JUST GET COLD FAST IT JUST-
The can't dance might be a you problem
Being a skinny person all my life I can confirm this 👌❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Bruhhh this is so relatable. I’m also skinny and tall. (Finally someone understands!!)
I am 11, skinny and weigh 75 pounds
I was traumatized as a kid with my grandma telling me to eat more then when I did she and everyone else would tell me not to eat too much or I'd get fat. That was tramautic.
For number 5 thank you that’s so true
66.4 pounds!!!! I’m 11 and I weigh 114.8 what the hell
where are your magical hairs 🥺🥺
So relatable
Damn you really can't fricking dance
The accuracy 🥲
Ah yes my fellow oddly tall people
Very thing she Said is soo true
I feel the same
Does that say 66
I’m a ginger, I am the definition of skinny.
Love your attitude and humor
might not be the best dance moves but still vibing
Sorry but are you a boy or girl
Language.
YES i still do this day
I’m fat and I’m always freezing
Iam living the skinny part right now
Kpop stars are skinny and can dance lol
True true 🥲
Better at dancing then me
Another big issue with being skinny is working out. You get excessive cramps because when you get hot, ur intestines expand and can press against each other and ur ribs
Me who is also skinny and i eat more than my hole family
I am a skinny 11 year old and that is facts
This is why I'm not afraid to be fat
This is all my problems in a video!!
The belt is so true! And it’s so fricking hard to poke the holes 😭 lmao
I'm also so skinny even tho I eat alot
As a fat person l’m sorry l can’t relate.
Bruh the holes in the belt one 😂💯 then we eat 24/7 and still be skinny
You look good af
as a skinny person , this is honestly relateable and the comments from all of them really annoys me  this is honestly true and the pants and belt is true 🗿
Sry did it say 663..?
same here bro
The fatter you are, the better you dance
I would do anything to have these problems
Skinny bodies are funny tho
You look like that skeleton dancing
I have been fat for my whole life 😂 I wish I was skinny
Good moves
I've been skinny like you too
Question why when she said the n word one time is she a racist and horrible person yet when it’s said like it’s the gosh darned simple statement as hello in middle school nobody cares. Like come ON bro internet drama is too much
Glad to know I’m not crazy about the temperature cause people always seem to think it’s weird when I mention it being cold. I literally walk around always with either a blanket or jacket.
I do get cold fast and it sucks
I'm going to eat more now
But you're so f****** lucky
Bella: “I CANT DANCE!” Me: “oh please, im fat and still can’t dance stfu.”
Omg how can you dance like that I can't because you're better than me at dancing but listen here's the worst part I'm 4,1
Ya got da moves
This happens to me all the time it sucks
Finally some one who understands me, but the last part though 😂🤣
67 pounds?
I ain’t skinny and my ass still hurts when I sit  and I get bruises when I lay on my chest 🧐
Nah bro, u cute. Don't trip
As a skinny person, it does indeed hurt to do sit ups.
I can relate. And everytime i sit down, i put my lag on the chair, because like you said, it hurts afetr some time.
What sucks is when your at a family gathering and someone makes fun of you for being to skinny
l am called stick
I'm called a stick
me whos a little overweight and still getting cold easily as fuck
I wish you his was a problem I had to worry about
If skinny af I know your pain but the weird thing is I’m at a decent wait but I’m tallish so it just is from hight
I weighed 80 pounds in 8th grade
Poking new holes in the belt. Oh god.
as a skinny person i can only wear eyelet belts cuz of the holes
All skinny people facts
When i eat my body expands to a third of its initial size. My body as my stomach. I have to change the hole of the belt 100 times a day. Every time i sit i have to go one larger, when i get up one tighter.
I am kinda fat but also kinda normal and i have most of these problems myself
I'm 13 years old and I weight 30 kg 😢
So you have been skinny all your life??.. explains why you are able to squat on your sink every now and then..
i can relate to all of them especialy thr last one
You can’t dance but those move are smooth
idk you seem pretty good at dancing to me
What if my pants aren’t made for a belt. I’m skinny aswell
PERIOD!!!! Finally someone who gets me
I understand, me too
Ditto, except that my metabolism is so weird that heat kills me and cold is my default
You just dance like a white person
You dont want to be overweight. Trust me.
Honestly...... Relatable
As a skinny person... I could verify everything but not dancing.... I'm a dancer ..
The last part made me die haha
Pretty sure that last one’s a personal problem
No affence but to be fair it is way funnier when fat people dance
I can relate!!! Been skinny asf my whole life!
I say ur dancing is pretty good 👌💃🎶😂
I'm only saved by the sitting one because I have a thicc ass , but the rest my god they are true
As someone who used to be VERY skinny (seriously my waist used to be smaller (by a good amount) than my ribs, I can confirm.
I am borderline obese and my pants still can’t stay up.
“Ass bones “🤣🤣🤣 poor bones
So true
My cousin is so skinny the doctor don't need x-ray to see He's bones you can see He's bones
66 pounds? I can’t read it
Onlyjayus saying she can’t dance but actually does it better that 90% of all the other people in this world.
Ye it sucks but it worse when your small as well
I’m very much on the upper end of a healthy weight but my butt still hurts when I sit on a non padded chair
As a fat person i cam cornfirm i was always a good dancer
All of that is facts, cuz I'm skinny...   But I never get cold... Odd
I have a fast matabalizm so this is very relatable, and yes we cant dance for crap
I will happily donate my body fat to you 🤣
That wasn't bad dancin ngl😂
What I would Give to have this problem again, this was me super skinny and trust be I would eat, so much especially fast food so I thought I was blessed.......Wrong I had 4 kids and now I gained the weight still thin but nothing like before
That last one I’m pretty sure it’s just you 😂
So true
Is it good or bad that I can relate😬
Tell ya right now the comments you were getting as a skinny kid, from your video, were a lot nicer than my comments as a fat kid. JS 😕
U still look good to me skinny love it
Agreed
That bathing suit shot though.... 😍 I'll keep you warm after we have a dance 😜 I like that you own your moves lol
I have this problem 😢
Haha my family keeps on telling me to get some meat on my bones even though I eat enough to say that I ate a horse. Relatable.
Ok bro you should be thankful that your skinny because no matter how many diets i go on or how much i exercise, i CANNNOT LOSE ANY WEIGHTTTTT
This is my life story
So true
Would have rather grown up skinny 🤣 ver growing up fat. That was not fun.
Wait was that 60 pounds or 60 kg
yo i wish i could be you cause i’m not skinny
YES!! 🙌🙌 thank you finally for making one of these vids I am so skinny and I get called string bean all day 😭
I feel her-
as a person with abnormally high metabolism, i can testify that every statement she has made in this video is a fact.
Most of my life I've been the skinny one
I’m also skinny and tall, I can relate so much, though I think the dancing part is just you-
I’ve been told the wind will blow me away 😂
Imagine complaining about being a normal weight...
Yoo same I am 6 ft and way 130 lbs
The pain is real people
Me to and I can dance but I only did it one with my gf on a date lol.                 EDIT : I meant once
Bruh she got sturdy no cap
Agreed lol
Youre white ofc you cant dance
a few weeks ago my friend asked if I ate at home (since I wouldn't always eat lunch at school) and I had to explain to them thelat when I get home I eat basically a full course meal and more snacks all the way up until dinner
Easily get cold... Yeah, related to that😀
I feel you Buddy 🥲
When a guy puts their thumb & pointer finger around your wirst.
Can’t dance the dance moves are lit 😂
I'm really bulky and I can't dance for shit
Fat people problems:                                      Our ass doesn’t fit in chairs,laying down like that leaves marks,our pants and belts also don’t fit,we’re always hot,we get worse comments and dancing makes us look pathetic
Bruh, have you seen fat people dance 😂
Idk if the last one is because your skinny
The cold is terrible
I need help all my clothes don’t fit, when I was 10 I could fit in 5year old clothes
Don't worry my uncle skinny like you he's been try to gain weight all his life
I would like to be skinny but im fat as fuck 🥺😭
Must be nice 😞
She do got some moves tho at the end
And then there's me... 5ft 1in weighing 130
Same atleast your tall
I used to be like this until I started overeating and now I'm still skinny except for my stomach 😐😐 I hate this
True except I can dance and don’t get cold often I usually get a fever from the warmth in summer
I am incredibly skinny but I weigh 147 lb I don't understand
I’m not skinny and I don’t think not being able to dance is related to being skinny cause I suck at it too.
As someone who has to wear a jacket even in summer thank you for speaking out about skinny people troubles
When I was little I was super duper skinny and small and people (including my mom) would say things about how I needed to put some meet on my bones and how I never ate
I'm skinny and can't dance either
I have exactly the same problems
Me a fat shit looking at this like i wanna be skinny even then
I’m skinny all these are 100% true
BUTT
As a skinny person i fucking eat a lot but i dont get fat
I’m very skinny and the food thing I can confirm, the funny thing is I eat a lot like I finish my plate then I go get another plate then I take what every one else didn’t eat. My mehtabilisim is high. I also have a problem with finding clothes also
Ye, relatable.
This is so relatable
I want to be so skinny 😪 ive been fat as fuxk
This is 100000% relatable I'm cold and my ass bones hurt as we speak
I can't dance either, it all makes so much sense, I just thought I was too white 😅😂
i felt all of these until i had a kid and still have baby weight and miss these struggles😭🫠
Omg finally someone is talking about this, at 19 i weigh around 135 to 145 pounds and I'm around 6'1 to 6'4 and I don't understand why people are always saying I'm lucky to be skinny AF but I'm not as a guy i just get made fun of, and I eat a lot including a sugar addiction which is why I have a bunch of health conditions because nobody ever worried because I'm skinny AF lmao I also have hyperthyroidism which is a thyroid condition that messes with my metabolism as well as heart and lungs at least I have a kinda six pack because of sit ups in weight training class and small but defined biceps/triceps and that's it, i literally have been treated horribly all my life because of my weight  and other issues that I have, i wish I wasn't I'm so insecure
Tge dance is epic tho
Facts
I aitn't skinny, I still can't dance🤣🤣
My friend is so skinny he can pop out his shoulder whenever he wants and it looks like he is about to go turbo
Yup. Everything I see here is true and relatable.
I am very skinny and I can confirm this
I think you are just ok, I was and still chubby (fat) then and now so for the dancing.... I have no comments 😐
Currently 13 years old, 102lbs, and oh my god, nothing fits comfortably, and with autism I love tight clothes so I shave to wear leggings underneath EVERYTHING, even during the summer. I get called a 'skeleton' quite alot and called creepy 😭
Teach me how to dance I can not u r a pro
Bruh the "eat more" one is common to me. Parents say it, brother, sometimes friends too. Not fun to hear nearly daily.
Well I'm skinny and I love cold and I would say I'm a pretty good dancer but the rest for me is true.
this is so relatable 💀
MAAM I AM A SMIP FOR THE LAST DANCE 💀👄💀 😏😏😏😏😏😏
I think i found my twin
#6 is more of a white people thing lol
Bella is 21 years old and is 66kg and Im 48kg and not even in high school
Im super skinny and I get called a twig at school
I have a big ol' ass, and sitting on a hard surface hurts me too. In truth, we all need more comfortable seats.
THe dance lmao
I can't dance either
I can relate to number 3
Same
My PE teacher needs to see the 2nd one and my family needs to see all of em lmao
Olive that’s the exact same thing that I’m going through
You say you can't dance but you dance better than me
Wow!!! Is one of them making you say the n ward???
Sorry but the "can't dance" bit has nothing to do with your weight ...  Practice... And watch these skinny dudes dance  Sven Otten (JustSomeMotion) - Parov Stelar - All Night - #neoswing YouTube · Sven Otten - JustSomeMotion Jan 18, 2013
GIRL!! GO GET SOME ABS!  BTS is skinny and they are REALLY good dancers!! Plus they know how to dance good so yea.
As a skinny person I can confirm that people's comments growing up were the worst
Don’t care give me skinny problems any day of the week lol
Me realizing that my 14 yr old brother is heavier than Jayus 😳
This is literally me. I am a skinny person and all these apply to me. Although I am the greatest dancer ever 😅🤣
Those are some amazing dance moves, I feel like you laying to me
Lets switch
I'm sorry to disappoint you but I'm not skinny and can't dance either :(
Every skinny person can confirm this is very true
Completely and unnecessarily obnoxious
It’s easier to gain weight than to lose it
Your quite a informational person, and  a hoot to watch . Your dancing is funny as f..k Definitely worth watching
Can confirm all
I skinny
Only number 5
Facts
66 pounds???? IM 11 AND IM 64 POUNDS ???????
It vice versa for fat people 1.we can never fit in a chair 2.we can't do things like push ups 3.we're to hot all the time 4. clothes never fit 5. Society
As someone who can be described as a Halloween skeleton that escaped, can confirm
Dude what I'm 13 and Ive been told I needa eat more, it's not hurtful at all wtf that's a skill issue
As a skinny person I can corfirm
I'm skinny and I can say this is 1000% true
I'd love to see more pics of you playing basketball!
I relate to this and I hate all of them
Nice
6 foot 1 skinny sucks, calomate bars help, pants still don’t fit and I’m 42 still waiting on the floods to come or swimming in them.
Being cold all the time makes no difference since I hate turning on my heater
Exactly
Same
Me, an almost overweight person rethinking my wishes about being very skinny
Yeah thats a problem but the good thing that i love my body , is very true especially the cold situation everywhere !
Wait onlyjayus is female?
i know right 😭
Society is the worst of all things, it's like  EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
When I has 12, my heigth is 5'1 And my  weigth is FREAKING 38KG.  My guardian told me Im too skinny even the school classified my height and weight as "normal". Like I didnt even become part of feeding program  even once.  I didn't feel cold FASTER but I'll heat up or feel warm quickly.  I look like a dancing skeleton everytime I tried to dance  NOW FREAKING 3 YEARS LATER. In was 15 going to 16. My height is 5'4 and weight is 39kg. EVEN ALL I DO IN LOCKDOWN WAS TO EAT AND EAT. WITH VITAMINS FOR AND PILLS FOR BLOOD.   imagine, 3 years my weight  only increased by 1.
I don't care you look gorgeous 2 mi ps 26
why u always gotta fucking curse on every fucking video that u made? u tough for fucking curse all the the fucking time
I can relate.
Honestly this shit is so fucking true my brother has the same fucking problems
Don't forget about the fast metabolism making you hungry 24/7 no matter how much you eat :)
That must be why I'm so hot at night and can never get the perfect temperature
True cause I can’t keep myself warm NEVER IN MY LIFE have I managed to keep heat in my body
Go GoGo
True very true
Damn so relatable like I was 8 and people were like  Do you eat?.. Are you okay?. And my brother it was like 67° and I was freezing lmao
The daaancncxxeeee 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It Gets annoying
I know how you f5
I relate to all of this especially when you lie on your stomach, it hurts my ribs so bad, to the point where I just cant do it lol
YES OMG
Finally my problems in a videoo
I can relate.
My daughter weight is 96 lbs at age 40
“I can’t dance!” *continues to show us amazing dance moves*
Yeah I have Crohn’s disease so it caused me to loose my appetite and I became pretty skinny. Now I am good at eating but I’m working on not getting so skinny
I’m working on not being skinny so I relat to this
Laying down and then your spine hurts from laying on it 🥴
I'm skinny and I can dance but I get tried  very much after dancing for 10 minutes 👀
I’m fat so my blubber keeps me staying warm so I can’t relate 😅
I will admit that these might be real problems but also if your skinny that means you are conventionally attractive while fat people are always made out to be ugly in society. Sorry if I sound like an ass. Bye.
Yes I am skinny too 😀🤌🏼
My friends used to tell me how jealous they were of my skinniness, but its actually really annoying to be this skinny.  Being skinny is over advertised.
I'm skinniest in class so I can confirm
Ill donate my fat for 5000 dollars , dm me for more info 🤣
i have all these problems, and im also short, i can still wear a kids large in pretty much all clothing brands....im 18
This is my sister, you just listed out her problems ;-;
# relatable
Hey, I am going through this and trust me, It just fucking hurts so much. My own parents call me underweight what's it with me?!?!
I FUCKING HATE when people say “go eat your a stick” or automatically assume I’m on dope because I’m skinny.
As a fat boy kids jealous ngl
I don’t think can’t dance is a problem cause by skinnyness  It’s natural
It’s basically the same being fat
Her: "I CAN'T DANCE" Kpop Idols: *Confused*
I used to be like you. But now I'm 33 and I'm 185 lbs. There was a time in my adult years when I was 118 lbs
I feel you so much
Same Problems its just true
Me too lol
You dance like me
I was always told to eat and I eat as much as I want to which is somewhat of a large amount of food and I DON'T GAIN WEIGHT
When I was 9/8 I was around 20kg or 44 pounds which is super unhealthy and I’m just getting to a normal weight now!!
i'm also skinny and i play volleyball so when i dive to get the ball my hips get so bruised 😭
That dance thing, might just be a you problem lol
I wouldn't be able to dance either way lol
Don’t complain
I’ve been quite overweight my entire life, but recently I started losing a surprising amount of weight. I’m not ‘skinny’ but I’ve started to feel the whole sitting down thing but I never realized it was because I was losing enough weight for that to be a thing- So uh, thank you.
Literally everybody I know mention that I’m skinny I’m so tired of it.
It true skinny people can't dance I can't
OMG so relatable
My dad and sister can relate.
I just barely noticed how much jay looks like Kristen Stewart! 😱💚
Dancing is just hard
I can confirm we have these problems
Me watching numbers 1-5: * aggressively nods I agreement * Number 6: I CANT DANCE Me: * looks from the pointe shoes on my feet to my phone screen with visible confusion *
I think the most frustrating thing is how old you look, I'm 21 and still, sometimes people take me for a 17 year old.
Can confirm all these things. I'm always freezing, if I lay on my side I get woken up because I have no meat on my hips, sitting sucks. I feel u
I actually have one of those belt hole punchers XD i can make 7 different sized holes with it
the comments are so true lol  and the best part is: i almost certainly eat a lot more than them. like, a lot
Hrlp
I feel you...i put my finger on my leg and I feel my bones
Story of my life
when u hug someone and they go "OMG YOU'RE SOOOO SKINNY" bruhhhh that is not a compliment 😭
As soon as dad turns on the ac and it's only 75 I go get my blanket
Thank you Lord Jesus
yeah the cold one is for both extremes, somehow being fat makes you trap cold better, and insulates it for the worse since your blood goes cold and it can't escape
Them: "wow you are so skinny" Me: "nah you are just fat, eat less"
I agree with all of these
also dont even mention literally blowing away in the wind
Yes however number 3 doesn’t apply because I’m ✨hairy✨
I am skinny too
From 3 on, I can relate and I'm sad I do
So I’m really skinny and I have very long legs so either my trousers are too large for my waist or the legs aren’t long enough.
DID THAT SAY 66 POUNDS😓😓😓
On the other side of the world there are people that make 1$ per day and live in mud huts and you're complaining about being slimmer than like 70% the people in your  country.
Anyone can dance btw Just try taking a dance class
As a skinny person, I can confirm this is true
This is so true
Nah, i wish i had those cool dancing moves. Hell, i look like a worm while dancing.
Um that last issue...dnt think weight gonna help
I am skinny too and all is true
As a fatass, cannot confirm. Can’t do shit in terms of sports. We get horrible stereotypes. But y’know. Whatcha gonna do
I am a skinny person as well and I can confirm this. I got a healthy weight like 2 years ago
That's me
Честно говоря, проблемы есть у всех и всем насрать на других. Лично я не вижу в этом ничего плохого
i am ashamed to admit that I did, in fact, fly off with the wind once.
When you bump into a table or wall or whatever it hurts. I am forever bumping into things. And sitting on ur knees/leaning on elbows. Ow
I have all those problems too
bro the go eat a burger is what my mom say to me Alllll the time cause i’m to skiny
So true
I CAN CONFIRM ALL OF THESE
These problems are not comparable to those of a fat person, no offence, just a fact.
Look at those dance moves!
I was real skinny when I was like 8 and everybody said so you even eat or smth-
Yeah i get it I’m soooooo fricking skiinnnyyy people say I’m like a twig
Don't forget what happens when it storms, you have no weight to keep you on the ground.
This is facts from experience
I'm skinny and I relate to ALL these (apart from society)
At keast you can dance betrr then a god damn box
Can't dance my left big toe...  I see nothing but quality, Lovely.
The worst is the society and their stupid jokes like:keep  a coin in your pocket whenever you go out so you don't fly with the air
The 5 was so relatable
Don't forget the pain that comes with doing sit-ups on a hard surface
Relatable
yeah but being told you need to put the burger down is also offensive
God I wish I could put some meat on my dad stick of a body
Everything else are true problems but the dancing...... That's just you miss mam lmao 😆😂😆
As a skinny person, these are all correct
Her saying skinny people can't dance Me: have u seen dance moms???
“Cant dance” **me being really skinny and going to a dance comp tonight**
Relatable
U can dance better than me🤣🤣
U can’t danse cuz ur tall not cuz ur skinny
As someone who is fat, I wish I was thin like you
as a skinny person this is soo true, and one that’s also true is when you lay down on ur back and if your not on your back, oh lord that freaking hurts my bones
I can sympathize, imagine waying 80 to 90 pounds, and looking like a twig, literally one of my nicknames is twiggy lol  :Edit: just for context I'm twelve years old, not an adult that's less than a hundred pounds lol
😂😂
Your actually a really good dancer
In my opinion, you dance amazingly
Your dancing great. What you on about
This....explains SO much
neither can I but I still try dancing
As a 6’1 14 year old who weighs in at 130 pounds and has a 27-33 pant size, all of this is true
I am skinny for a good 7 years now 😭 yes all this is absolutely true ✨🤧
I eat so much and yet IM SO ROCKING SKINNY if anyone watches the internet family knows what ROCKING means
all of them are true for me
You actually have some pretty impressive moves
I can’t tell you how much I relate to this it’s also hard for me to good clothes that fit cause the size zero barely fits me
Relatable XD
I mean you dance vetter then me
Relatable
Ur right, u can't dance
I think the most frustrating is when people say things to you that they would 100% not say to an overweight person if it was reversed
The last dance
I was skinny as fuck in my early teenage years and i started working out at 16, few weeks away from 18 and my oldest brother who said it a lot is 5’9.5 i think and I’m almost 6’3 with bigger arms. He’s 23  Moral of the story if people give you shit give yourself a reason to give them 10x back.
I am a fat person I wish I was skinny trust me being fat is horrible
I can really relate 😭
Mhm this is relatable 😂😭😭
yeah, in 2020 i was 172/46 like, well, im still kinda skinny but not so much
I am a skinny person and I can relate to this 🥲
Omg u crack me up jay CLASSIC ..
I love that kind of dance
I have the same problem. Skinny shaming ain’t right to say to an 8 year old -___-
I’m skinny too
As a fellow skinny person, these are all true
66 pounds?! I’m 10 and 95 pounds
Yep I have the same problem  My friend are scared that they might snap me in half And my dad always tells me to eat a pie
Bro my whole self is as little as a chicken 😭😭
The belt one is relatable to a whole other extent
Ik it sucks
You're now 60 pounds?? I'm 11 and I'm 60 pounds
The poking new holes in my belt was a pain in the ass
At least you can poke holes into belts overweight people SPECIALLY WOMEN can't find a long enough belt I have been searching for a women's belt for my size for *4 years*! I have found so many pretty and nice ones but NONE FIT BC of my mandarin body type! I had to make myself a belt that is actually just three thick rug yarn my mom had to make myself a long enough belt so my jeans would finally stay still for two seconds
I feel all this
This is me Bro like no cap😂😂😂😂
Bro fac
Relatable
That’s me
✨fast metabolism problems✨
Facts
I was at a restaurant and I ordered a little portion and the waiter said to me are they feeding you
Stop, your ecposing me
Skinny? I think you’re hot! Don’t be so hard on yourself.
Oh no the pain of a skinny person 🤭
Some people judge either way. 🤷
This is literally me that's all they say
I can finally relate to a video cuz I'm 13 im not even 100 pounds yet and I get bullied alot
At least you are not fat
OMG I FEEL THE SAME GIRL
I now me to
Does this mean I'm skinny??
Always rather be skinny than fat
Beats being fat,  I look in the mirror before I shower and I look like Peter griffin.
Why..... why is it so relatable
Yep thats me and you might be wondering how i got in this situation and thats the story in finna tell you now….
Heahae
She dances better than me 🙂
i have a friend who is 6'1 and he is 58kg or 120 pounds
Yes, this is def true I'm REALLYYY skinny and I can confirm!
Girl your gorgeous calm it
What to do to be fit like u
I get very cold
Tell me about it
I use to be skinny and when I tried on  pants they never fit so I worked out and my legs arms and thighs got bigger you should try it
Haha love this girl , always have interesting content ✌🏻
Tbh I only wanted to watch this NC of the dance
I'm far from skinny, and i can't dance either
I literally have a disease that is made to make you skinny and all of this is true and I hate it
Yup
Frrr
The can’t dance thing is because your white😐
How can people say you are a skeleton when you have amazing abdominal muscles. For that matter, amazing muscles everywhere.
Some men find slender girls the best. Not all men are into so called thick girls. All the people dissing your body are just jealous that you are so slender.
Lol this represents my entire life I'm 95 pounds and 10 years old and ALL of theses are my daily problems,and that last one it's FACTS
why is no one literally talking about 3. imao i love that blanket or smt its so freakin cute 😭😭😭
i am with you! I HAVE ALL LE SKINNY PEOPLE PROBLEMS
Im skinny af too. The comments are the worst by far and I also have that skinny where I can eat 25 hamburgers in one sitting and gain no wait. I've been 70 pounds almost my whole life.
I can relate to all of these
Last one got me 🤣🤣
Im skinny and i have all those but the last two
best dance moves ever😂😂
THANK YOU!!!!
I can relate
Jayus says its horrible to say that to a kid meanwhile my family continues to do it nonstop
Ooh yuh get it Jayus those moves were amazing
Can relate to all of these except the third and sixth one
Yeah agree on the laying down and eat more I get that often
I used to be 500+ pounds. I got down to 175, which was actually very underweight for my height and build, and now I’ve stayed around 250 for two years. I get so cold so fast now I can’t believe it. I never realized how much my insulation was doing for me.
I can relate so much im almost 6 2 and i weight 127 lbs
Same. I’ve always been skinny shamed and I’m finally to where I feel better and healthy
Bro same! Someone that understands!!
Yoo...those are some sick dance moves..
Grandmother constantly trying to feed you stuff even though you're extremely full
Dance better than me, a fat dude
Well at least you're a girl. Imagine what a boy got from society.
I have to deal with this also
Bro I’m so fucking skinny and I’m like bro I eat so much food I’m fine
No offense but you can't dance because you're skinny it's because your white. It happens to 96% of us 😔
I totally feel you bro
People think you can float in water but what actually happens is u sink I know from experience
Im almost 40, almost 100 lb, still called a crack-head. Fat shaming is horrible. But skinny shaming isn't. Big girl, don't come at me like that. I bite back
I here ya
I feel like u just punched me damn this is teuw
I can relate to these being skinny and pretty tall.
I think your dancing was good 👍
Exspesiuly the but stuf like is it just me that can twitch there but bones and move across a chair without moving
yall complaining bout bein skinny think about being fat for a sec :(
I’m 16 and I weight 36 kilos
My friends/ family always talk about how you can see my bones in certain places because of how skinny I am
*Skinny as [_____]*
Bro same
I have same thing with my ribs. Also is it Bad that i can Touch some Things under my ribs?
Same all my life I've been skinny but I'm starting to put on some weight now
I can relate 😔
Me and my brother is still skinny but short
I'm 68 kg at 10
Are you male or female?
I'm skinny too, and I recommend you working out to put on some muscle. Shit works really well.
That cold part, You guys got it lucky, I’ve lived in cold temperatures for a while and I moved to a very hot and humid area in Japan, So I’m always almost dying going to the bus
My mom is skinner the u
Noice moves 😂
YESSSSSS THE COMMENTS WERE TERRIBLE. Soooo many people said I would break in half if I played football. And this shit still happens to me. 5 fucking years later   Also someone once asked how I’m not 300lbs, because of how much I eat. For the record I’m 110lbs. And I’ve eaten a quadruple McD burger
I felt this
You certainly can dance better than I can though
I like your "dancing"
As a 87 pound almost 15 year old I agree
Lol same
Like fr I am one of the skinniest people in my grade and they are low key kinda mean
I hate very skinny and I can’t dance
I was denied a job because they thought I was anorexic, no, I eat a *lot*. I just can't seem to gain weight.
Fucking REL
I'm not the only one 🥲
This is so true!!!
Omg me too 😖😭😭
The cold thing is way more complicated than just being skinny , although it does play a role it's actually not a very big one in the scheme of it.
I want the skinny people problems, especially the no insulation part. I hate heat
I’m chubby and sitting down makes my assbone hurts as well
Cant relate  Fat as hell
Then just eat duh
the dancing thing is probably more of a u thing
I should know im 11 and way 75 pounds
You're really beautiful and you dance just fine. Only problem is that you curse too much.  I still like you though
Get a rigger belt.
Sit On Me So Your Ass Bones Don't Hurt, Lay On Me So Your Ribs Won't Hurt...I'll Keep You Warm...I'll Teach You How To Dance 2 Lol...JK ..You Dance Just Fine
You are so beautiful ❤️
I literally went into a depression because I was called mean names like skinny slim jam that’s all people would talk about
Dance party woohoo
This is me too I am skinny as hell I experience all this
I love how tall you are!!
The sitting and laying thing is so relatable (also laying on your side hurts your hip bones)
Chile I still can’t dance and I gained weight 😣
I'm skinny some of this is true and some is false
Idk what your talking about but your an amazing dancer
Skinny people rule
Gosh you're adorable😳
I'm skinny to and I'm afraid I'll get the one super power that won't end well for skinny little me 😹😹
Bitch shut up those are the best dance moves I've ever seen
Jay how tall are you
omg ty for making this😂😂😭
I have experienced all of these but #3
Nah tho bro, you got some moves
Oh don't worry, us chunky bois suck at dancing as well.
Come on! Are you saying you want to be 130 pounds when you’re 11 like me
Better moves than me haha
Twerking as a skinny person looks more like a gagging cat.
I was called a pencil that would Snape
I'm a skinny person
While u grew up skinny ur entire life I grew up fat my entire life and is still struggling with being overweight to this day
ⓢⓞ ⓣⓡⓤⓔ
I use to lay down all the time in my room to play with legos and I would get up lookin like I just lost a fight to the rock😭 and the ass bones thing is also 100% fax, even just 5 minutes😭
That is sooo me. Like- I can't even remember the last  time I even gained weight 🥺
I recently put on a few pounds from 129 to 133 i think I’ve made progress mostly cuz im going crazy with the fucken milk and protein shakes and banana and strawberry and blending fucken low fat and whole milk together extra calories 😂
Can't deny any of that
The dancing part is a white person thing, but it’s also really prevalent in racist people
I am as skinny as u was/are. I am 18 and i have a height of 6.4 feet and i weight 55 kilogramms Have fun to see my Body Mass Index(BMI) But i am healthy and completely normal and i also do mich sport
What about kpop idols who dance.....🤔
As a skiny person I approve this message
'Go eat a burger 🍔' Me who is fasting 😭
*Can't dance* may be due to something other than being skinny 🤔 just saying
The same thing I say yo my sis
i can verify that all of this is true-
Me legit not having these problems because I got fat shamed- I’m not even that fat- but I still get bruised
Yea, I see the struggle of skinny people. Currently, I an helping a guy who is 6 foot and is 62kg to body build.
Girl, I can relate because I'm realllllly skinny and I dont eat much and sometimes my clothes don't even fit! So I can relate to you and feel the same way and ppl treat me the same way.
So true
Being skinny does not effect your dancing you do
I swear I have this problem
She can dance better than me!! Rhats a compliment
Anyways I'm a skinny person I'm a competitive dancer aswell muahahahahha
The last set of bones of my ribs are a bit raised up and I am skinny so people think my mom starves me
Me as a skinny person my self this is so true 😔🖐️
All of this is so true
“I can’t dance”  *doubt*
This is soooo true
Yes everything yes
The belt one is too true
As a skinny boy I can confirm all of this I have made like five holes in my belts I  won't lie
I’m skinny and a dancer but about everything else I can relate to everything like sitting down or laying on my stomach that shit low key hurts 💀🤡😭
Not being able to dance is not because you’re skinny😐
It is so true 😔
Its true 🙂😭....
I ain't skinny - I'm more curvy, but I can relate to two of them.   some of my jeans don't fit that well for me. sure my thighs won't have a problem, but my waist? my waist is much smaller compared to my bottom.  after I lost some weight (I am at my healthy weight now), I started to feel cold more often and "easier". btw, my hands are ice cold so often for no reason - wassup with that???
To true 😭😭😭
Eat some cake
Hahaha that dancing tho. Not that I could do better. That's the cost of being athletic.
If u to cold I'd snuggle ya I'm always overheating
I have always been ashamed because i am not the skinniest and the next guy 😥
Oh I thought it was my fan and yes all of these r true
Some people think that’s it’s ok to say “oh my goodness you need eat, you’re about to float away in the breeze”. It hurts a lot of people. Don’t just think that overweight people can be shamed, skinny-shaming is a thing and it’s exactly like saying “oh god, you need to stop eating, you’re going to break that chair.” Don’t shame people for how their body is, society is making beauty and health standards way too unrealistic.
As a very skinny person,I can confirm this
Her: I can’t dance   Her:dances like a maniac
Really, im not skinny at all and i wishes i was skinny. People always make rude comments from my body saying im to fat or to thick or my thighs are too big. 😅
It’s fine if you can’t dance ,I dance can’t dance either
I HATE BELTS FOR THAT REASON
Every day
Bro honestly I didn’t see her she stood sideways
Once when I was a child my family went to a public pool and while I aas swiming a Lady came up to me and said: 'omg do youre parents give you food? Do you want me to give you some?' I Just said 'im fine' and left
Dude I-
“I can’t dance” *proceeds dancing*
Pov: you recorded a video when she was dancing
Flat
Indeed the struggle 😪
Oml thank you Most ppl just don’t get it and it’s super annoying when they say some of this stuff
Same with me it’s not just you
You can’t swim, can’t dance, and don’t know karate.. face it, you’re never gonna make it
My brother is same plus more injuries because no cushioning on him
Literally describe my entire life
As a bloke who's 6'2 with the metabolism of a squirrel on pcp, I concur that being skinny sucks 😂😂 *eats 8th full plate of food today* where TF IS IT ALL GOING?!?!?!?
Ok, skinny.  But you are tall.  Hmm,  tall and skinny vs. short and fat.
I'm super skinny I weigh 37 and I have for years. When I was younger I nearly flew away
Relatable
Get pregnant, you'll gain a bunch of weight
FINALY SOMEONE THINKS ABOUT THIS
YES
I’m skinny and some people said these things to me😢  Ps I can confirm these things
Lol used to deal with this, now I’m fat
The last one got me
sink is for brushing teeth not standing on sorry ive seen a few videos of yours and there seams to be some confusion
Looked hot whole life too.
Bro, you’ve got some real courage showing ur dancing at the end there. (This is a compliment)
I am the skinniest I am way skinnier than you trust me
Yeah I’m skinnier than most people so I can relate
Those are purest white people dancing. No shame in that.
I have all of these problems!! I eat McDonald's at least once a week so the people who say "do you eat?" Yes! I don't eat healthy, like at all!
My friends grandma called me a bird me cus of my skinny-Ness and I still don't go to there house
I play volleyball and every time I hit the floor for a ball, everyone on my team just asks me if I’m ok. They all expect me to break every time.
Fax
The suffers I suffer from
That  where you said about getting cold is my cousin and everything else
The worst thing is when you try to talk about skinny people problems and people think your trying to show off that your skinny
Her: “I CAN’T DANCE!”  Me: that’s the best dancing I’ve seen in my life. 🙏
Um I have the opposite problem. I've been over weight my whole life(yes even as a baby) and I can't LOOSE ITT
as a skinny person I can confirm but also my dance is way worse urs is godly compared to mine
Don't say that I know a lot of people who are skinny &can dance real well
If I walked into a place and somebody was dancing like that I would immediately want to become their friends
*as a chubby person/fat as faq I cannot relate ✌️*
Good dans movs
Me and my twin also are been thin af And like back when we were like 4-9 or sum my parents would always tell us to eat or we would need to sleep in the hospital in the future cause we'd be sick of how skinny we are,im just relizing now how fucked up that actually is  Like wtf
im young and skinny asf and my family says "i can see ur ribs!" and im eating like so much but im still skinny :(
Bonus Problem: Wii Fit calling you underweight ruining my self-esteem
Jayus says she can't dance 5 seconds later: *busts a move that beats the competition*
You can dance?!
I dont really say this but you have to be grateful your what olmost 2 times my age and I have your wait. IM 11 and I am 63.5😭😭😭😭 and I dont even eet much
Im overweight lol
“I can’t dance” bro I ain’t skinny and I CANT DANCE EITHER you’re not alone
Me every single day like I can eat a chocolate elephant and be fine my classmates would always be weirded out
Your dancing was weird, but was done w such confidence that my skinny ass would've joined you if I'd seen you at a wedding.
YO SAAAAAME
So true
my older brother is very skinny so we would comment that he is bird boi
This is so true
If you eat well and do any leg based activities, these problems will be no more.
No like fr tho- I had a few parents as I was growing up call me an actual stick.
Gurl I’ve been through it
You will get chunky after 30
Welp im in the same boat lol 😆
Si zen Gere
I can confirm this 🥲
U prob just cant dance in general no offense but im not very skinny and cant dance either 😂😂
That is me lol
U dance better than me-
Pretty fire mives
Same they always say how to lose weight but they never say how to gain weight
I’m also very small. As a baby, my mom was scared to change my diaper cause she didn’t want to break my bones
Trade you
I know what you mean
I always shivering because I'm skinny n couldn't stand cold😭  No, the fact that Malaysia n Southeast Asian countries are not as cold as winter season in US (n other place that have snow) but i still couldn't stan cold just because a freaking air conditioning 😭
I'm not sure the last is skinny problem
I want to be skinny :(
The line starts be hind me.
As a skinny person I can say The wind is scary
I am skinny and all of this is true
As a fat person I only have one of these problems and that is everyone talking about my weight and shape
Omg she weighs the same amount as me.
Get a screwdriver and a lighter burn those dayum holes into yo belt
At least you can lay down flat. Sad that you get bruises though
people: ohmygod you need to eat something! me: i will have you know that every day i consume 100x my own body weight in food. my stomach is an endless void that can never be fulfilled
I think the dancing thing is for all of us
I think you should check your iron.
Girl, you got better dance moves than me.
Why was this video on blast while I was sitting right next to my dad
As a skinny person, i agree.
So reletable smh
Dude I understand everything you just said I’m extremely skinny too and a lot of people say stuff like “you’re so lucky to be super skinny.” Or “at least you’re not fat”… it’s like bro.. I literally don’t care if u say I am lucky.. I want to be normal sized ;-;
..u still fine asf
I’m tired of it
Exactly
FACTS about me
As a skinny bisch (41kg, twenty less then I should have) I vouch for each of them including dancing! If you ain't got a$$, you got nothing to shake! Lol
i am skinny probably cause I don’t eat dinner
I can approve, as a skinny person
In this world you cant be happy or you are to skinny or to fat or to stupid or to smart
Me not realizing I am skinny 🤯
I can agree
Yup I’m skinny as heck and I can’t help it, my nickname is stick, and people make fun of me saying “one little breeze and you’re gonna snap in half, but it’s fine because you’re so skinny people wouldn’t even notice if you’re gone anyways” it bad and I hate it. I eat too much just so I don’t have to deal with it but I can’t gain any weight.
Bro I wish ppl knew this more
SO TRUEEEEEE but i rly cant dance im too awkward lol but ALL OF THAT IS SO TRUE I ONLY HAVE 2 PAIRS OF JEANS. i eat a lot and my bff calls me "elephant eating stick" PFFFT
I thought I was alone
It sounds like skinny people problems
As a skinny person, I can relate.
I fat
As a skinny person who is literally 5'9 and 92-93 pounds. I can confirm this is super true
Thats so fking true🤣🤣im be 13 this year and last time i check my weight i was 20kg
Yea
Can confirm although I only got cold when you mentioned it
"Just eat more"  Omg why didn't I think of that that's so  smart😳   I personally am a bit more plus sized but ppl in public shouldn't say anything about a person's weight or body in general. I'm lucky enough to have a personality where I'm mostly confident in my body and don't care what others think but it's horrible thinking about what both "bigger" people and thinner/skinnier ppl go through every day. You all are champions! <333
You weigh 60 pounds?
YES! People don't realize how true this is!
I think not being able to dance is just you
That's technically still dancing....
I relate as some one who can fell the back of their spine through my stomach
No offense  but skinny  jay
I’m sorry I have to tell you this but you’re dancing look like Michael Scott from the office in the episode booze cruise
I can confirm I’m to flipping skinny
I can relate
I’m so skinny I just get cold really fast I’m wearing a sweatshirt.
Same!!!!
Ik its a joke, but I know this really skinny girl and man she can really dance.. like she’s great
🤣
I was skinny.   And then covid hit
Lmao the sitting one is so true. Pain in a nutshell
As a person who has dealt with this its true when I was in like 1st or 2nd grade people in my class always said do you starve yourself or something I'm like I EAT ALL THE TIME I DONT UNDERSTAND THIS STUFF
Agreed
Glad to know my inability to dance isn't cause I suck, and because I am skinny as hell
The people saying like its me they still call me skinny and get meat on ur bones
*Jayus starts dancing*  Oh baby…no I love you but…no
Can Relate to 😂
Well...you dance better than me
I was told to keep change in my pockets, and that the only time the pants touch my "behind" is when I sit down.
THANK U people never realize the problems we have
This is true and funny I love your channel
Lol yeah I'm pretty sure it's not your weight that deprives you of dance skill-
I don’t think anyone can dance good even if you can dance it probably took you a long time to learn how to dance 😐 i’ve seen kids dance even worse than you 😑
Yooo, you work @ bby too?
I say she is a good dancer. It’s okay to be very skinny. I am not the skinniest person but I still get very cold
That happens to me. I'm skinny as hell and I'm 13 I stuff my face in food and never gained the calories and fat
I wish I was skinny like that
As a chubby kid I was told by my bestie that I can't dance. She is fucked up sometimes.
you also get holes on all your clothes
Relatable
So true, same problem
she got moves 😂
Yep lol
Im a boy and my sister is like "Omg ur eyelashes are so long and beautiful" like I dont want a beautiful eyelashes
Now let's see if they can give us some short problems  I'm 14 and 4 foot 3 😭
i have weight problems tho
Your so cool
Relate to the can’t dance part because of it 😅
I lost a ton of weight after I had my son due to post partum depression. I was scary skinny. People asked if I had cancer, if I was a tweaker, if I was sick, etc etc. It was really hurtful.
Fucking FACTS
Confirmed
Neither can I but I'm fat
Now as a skinny person do a video on the perks of being skinny as heck I have a perk we skinny people can fit ANYWHERE
This all happens on a daily basis for me I am very skinny
I have the same problem
2 fans on while window wide open at 9:21 pm it's not cold
I’m skinny and I’ve always been so awkward
As a skinny person I can approve of this 😶
Was stuck at 60 pounds since I was 4. A few months ago I finally gained weight and I'm at 83 now. I eat a feast and lose weight. Then I get told I'm too skinny. I'm a child and yeah uts horrible to say what's been said to me to children or literally anyone.
3 for me for sure
ɪ ᴄᴀɴ ʀᴇʟᴀᴛᴇ
My feet are ice cubes 24/7 🧊🥶🤐👣😅
This makes me fell better that skinny people have problems too ❤️❤️❤️
But...But...I'm a good dancer..And skinny....                             Maybe that's a YOU problen

Michael Jackson be like everything is possible
I’m not really skinny tbh but I can dance either 😀
This is so true 🥲
I can't dance either
Look dude, not beinh able to dance never stopped Iggy Pop's skinny ass
I'm not skinny and have issues finding belts, so I found a solution that would probably work for skinny people as well. Go to the craft Department of a store and buy some the Rope looking stuff by the yard. Then, no matter how thick or thin you are, just put it through the belt loops and tie it. No matter how much weight I gain or lose, my belt will always fit. I have a black piece I've been using for years, but it usually comes in a lot of colors and thicknesses for your personal style.
Dude same
That last one I think is a you problem
I never thought i would relate to you so much
Same
I hate being skinny
So true
Jayus: *dances* Me: *minecraft skeleton noises*
*minecraft skeleton noises*
I can relate
I’m quite skinny and most of these are true for me except for the not getting cold. I’m not sure why but I just cannot get cold.
I agree. Being skinny sucks sometimes
Me being skinny and can relate to this
I don’t think the dance one is a us problem it seems like a you problem
My gurl ik we have the same problem
It’s called eat a lot and if you think you did you didn’t
Well I wouldn't snap in half by the wind as a skinny person cuz I am skinny but I can tell you I was sorry that happened to 2 days ago me and my sister didn't have the car at the time cuz my mom was out somewhere so we took walking instead while we were walking back to the house the wind started blowing so hard and I was getting pushed away from my sister by the wind as you can see me in the corner of her eyes and Ashley was still turned away I said help me
THATS ME
"I can't dance!" Me: "Better than me..."
My great grandma once said out loud to me "why are you so skinny people where as skinny as you in WW2"
I am 60 pounds at 10 my sister who is the same height has me being 100 at 13
1. one is true but 3. cap
I am skinny and this is so true Especially with clothes
I get this all the time it's NOT FAIR !!!!!!  WHYYYYY.       I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS
I wish this was more mainstream
When I was younger I was skinny well skinner than I was now but anyway I was coming into school and was really windy and the teacher told me that I was going to break in half so she brought me in and I had to wait for everyone else to come in
Oh my god the ribs part is so relatable

DANCEEE GURL
Is it just me that wears shorts in the snow even when I'm skinny as hell
I feel you girl it runs in my family my mum, grandma, great grandma they were all so skinny and I am too. But there are some good things that come along with it
I completely understand I've been off my ADHD meds for almost a year to make myself gain weight.
there is only 1 cure: c h o n k
Relatable
I know what you mean 😏I'm also skinny but I can eat whatever I want & never gain much weight people sometimes don't like that but I don't care not only that I can eat anything l also can go days without eating and still have the energy to keep on going and going l'm like D freaking ever really bunny. So I don't mind being me. 😁

Drunk jayus
You dance better than I do and I have fat on my bones
Skinny Gang=This Commet
Last one doesn't apply but building muscle is a pain. I have to wear form fitting clothes to look normal.
You can dance better than me
You can dance better than me
Dude same
As a skinny person, I can say you have better dance moves than me.
I got body shamed by my sister on new years 2022, and it’s EXTREMELY HARD to find clothes my size :’D
I wish I was skinny, I’m tired of being fat😔
I personally think you have good dance moves
Me being nowhere near fat but definitely not skinny and wanting to be skinny bad af: ...
I have been fat as fuck all my life but some reason. People don’t notice even though my belly has jiggle physicsy
At least your not fat lol
Y r u standing on a fucking sink
pretty sure you can dance LOL
WHY IS THIS SO TRUE I relate very heavily to this
This is so true
I don’t think the last one is because of you being skinny
YUH GETT IT
*I can confirm, 100% true*
You  can  dance  better  than I can
I can agree very much no wonder how i get random bruises
Same
I feel sorry for you, but I’m not as skinny as you, but there’s some problems with having a shape like mine.
The belt.....yes.....................I HATE IT!
I am literally unhealthy underweight and I can confirm
OH AND MY UGLY AF SISTER CALS ME A UGLY FUCKING SKELITANE
I'm just 9 years old AND I'M SKINNYER THEM MY LITTER BROTHER AND MY MOM said i have to eat more BUT WHEN I TRY TO GET FAT I FUCKING CANT
As a kid, family members would literally call me a lizard, and on windy days joke that I’d be blown away, bro I was like 5-7, you can’t say that to a child
Bro il 13 and 50 how are you only 66💀💀💀
Me too me too.... 😂
Hey person I love your videos
Hmm yes,  your "boyfriend"  is a woman and you the "girlfriend"  in this relationship ,   you are a man.  world has changed quite alot,  wasnt allways like this
I can also confirm all those things.
Least u tried dancing
Man those some sick dance moves how did you learn it😱😱
66 pounds on the scale im not sure if im reading that right but if i am. I weigh 95 and im wayyyy younger than you
True,BUT!When u are skinny u can wear jeans made 2x smaller then the number u are wearing and say that they are 3/4 jeans
That dance Hilarious
I'm nearly 150 kilos at 1.83 meters, so I got different problems.
im skinny and tall yet i weigh            52 kg
Jayus: "I CAN'T dance" Also jayus:Breaking it like a superstar.
That last one isnt a skinny person thing I'm 205 pounds and I suck at dancing
As a skinny person I agree
I've been underweight my entire life and all of these are confirmed by me
Sammmeee but I don't get cold i wore a short sleeve shirt to school and it was 19 degrees outside
Yep I am you lol
I'm convinced they only said they couldn't dance so they would positive well deserved comments on the actual dancing skills
Bro I’m 96 pound’s and I’m 8
as a fat person you do not wanna be fat.
Me a muscular boi: understandable have a nice day
Your amazing 🤩
Well I still wish I was skinny
I thought it was normal
And built like a toothpick
I’m 5’10 and I’m 13
Me- I'm skinny as heck Me 8 seconds later- Mhm... *writes down notes about what she said* Wait I'ma kid- When i'm done- Good
You dancing is really f-ing funny
You dance alright to me.
I can relate
How in the world are you like 17 and I am mine and I weigh 30 more pounds than you
Agreed I’m think as f-ck
I’m a very skinny person and now I know why I am problematic with tons
This makes me feel better for being fat
When she was dancing that was embarrassing for me
Same... I'm just now getting to 139... That's a fucking achievement I have been stuck below 80 it's only taken me fucking 21 years xD
Wish i was skinny. But i like how your starting to feel more confident 😊
All of those happen to me 😢
Everyone has their own way to dance
as a skinny person, my parents have been shunning me for it my entire life. my “friends” have, my cousins have, aunts, uncles, etc. the worst feeling is when someone walks up to you, mentions how skinny you are, and then goes to put their hand around your wrist. its super disrespectful
Literally made me proud of being fat
You can dance nicely
I can confirm to all of this #skinnypeople
Her : "skinny people can't dance"  Kpop idols : **visible confusion**
Facts💯 I concur
I'm skinny one leg on the scale 663
Dance moves approved
It's usually the people that eat the most that are skinny
Fr
Me who was one pound less than my 16-year old brother at 10 years old: 😆 couldn't be me
5 one , this is what I would say “ well what an idea why didn’t I think of that “ I have fast af motabilism and I eat a lot but still skinny
You danced better then I could:(
I can't dance either
I've had to have child watches my whole life!!!!!!
Agreed 👍
Sorry for being *those* kind of ppl but I'd rather have this problem than the problems that comes with being fat.    Not invalidating skinny people problems at all so don't start accusing but I'd rather deal with all of that than getting treated like dirt because ppl think I eat junk food 24/7 🙃
FUCKING FACTS! I love how true this is
I’ve been both really pale and really skinny for my whole life and got BUNCHES of different comments and names. Going from “ghost” to “snow white” and “toothpick” to “look, I can make a bracelet around your wrist!”
The society part is true  I swear I’ll eat like a giant burger and they’ll say you need to eat more
I weigh 75 pounds and I'm 13. Tbh I am you but as a 13 you old boy, I can't dance, I freeze in temperatures lower then 75.
Jayus:" Skinny people can't dance". Lisa be like:Am I a joke to you ?????
the cold thing is true... Im literally sub zero and my family never touches me ;-;
I've never had a single belt that I didn't have to poke like, 5 new holes into. I get bruised so easily as well
Lol i honestly have all these things in my head being skinny forever lol
Lucky I'm fat o~o
Did you eat?
"I cant dance"  [Proceeds to dance better than me]
That's definitely good dancing                            it's not
I was chubby my whole life and I got bullied for being a little fat, and so naturally, I developed anorexia and then I lost a... worrying... Amount of pounds and people then started bullying me for being skinny, like... What do you want from me? 😔
I am skinny no matter what I eat so I can agree with this
I’ve gained weight since, but until I was about 12-13 I was so skinny you could count the knobs of my spine through my shirt. The only time throughout the year I didn’t get a cold was the middle of summer, (I live in Australia btw) I also played AFL, one of the aims of the sport was bear tackling people to the ground. I had so many bruises one of my teachers thought I was being abused, it was actually really funny once sorted it out.
Finally someone realized this thank you
There may be something wrong with ne but I always took the "too skinny" comments as complements-
I can definitely relate to this. I would get bullied for being skinny. The kids would call me Alien and Twig Bones.. Honestly it was just really gross behavior/
Bro I was playing with a controller and my friend was like "stop! I feel like your fingers are gonna snap!" I looked at her like "what?" 🤨🤨🤨
Fr tho
I hate the comments about it
My problem is I am skinny and tall
The dancing is from the racisim
As a skinny I can confirm     ESPECIALLY LAYING ON MY STOMACH AND ON MY BUTT-
I’m skinny so I relate
Skinny people can't dance, it's just a fact
Relatable! Everything in the video, true!
I was told as a kid that if I don't eat and become skinny ill be like a stick and break in the wind i was around 6 years old bc i gained weight when they asked why you became fat ill told this but my parents said that they never told that but had said it now im fat
I would LOVE to dance with you? 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah I’m super skinny and when when ever lay on my stomach i get bruises
Dont even mention when you lay on your back and you feel the ground touching your arm bones, I'm really bad at explaining this sry
So I have this problem as well, but idk if anyone else has experienced this. I USED TO WEIGH 69-79 FUCKING POUNDS. AT AGE TWELVE. If I went without eating for more than three hours, I could actually start dry heaving because my stomach was so fucking small. So because I couldn’t  eat much I literally had to eat like a small meal 5 times a day
Me currently right now
I understand
The end though 🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
As a skinny person I confirm this, and I’ve been told some of those things before to. Also another thing I just wanna say.. CALLING SOMEONE SKINNY OR A STICK (ect.) IS BODY SHAMING AND HURTS JUST AS MUCH AS BEING CALLED FAT!!!  I’m sorry i just had to say that
You're a funny chick.
i am skinny and this is relatable
Hahaha sorry it's just so funny
I feel you
Bro I’m so small. I weigh 57 pounds only 9 less than you
I not even that skinny and the sitting thing is accurate
This is so true 😩
True im skiny
Accurate
Me being in high school eating as much as i want and being under 110. ALSO THE BELT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO POKE NEW HOLES ALSO THE COMMENTS ARE SO DEPRESSING
Same but i have litterlally been skinny since i was 5  and im 14 now
And im a dancer im better than everyone at my dance school
My ass always hurt
As a skinny child i can confirm
When I do situps on a hard floor I can feel my spine
I love your dancing lmao
I can't dance and I'm like the opposite of you
I wish I was skinny
One of my teachers today saw me eating and said "ha the skinniest one in the class is the one always eating" and proceeded to say I eat like a horse. He quite old but like bro, I'm 17 that shits gonna stick I already am way too insecure about my weight rn why tf you think I'm trying to eat so much
Preach
OK that just means you have a flat ass I’m sorry but I am not skinny in any way shape or form but I have a flat ass and it hurts to sit on my butt also because I am plus sized I have a rather large chest which means I cannot curl up into a ball and I cannot lay down on my chest without feeling like I’m suffocating I am hot all the time which is worse than being cold because you can’t takeoff layers but you can add on layers also about clothes never fitting have you seen what the industry has done toplus sized people clothing you have to go to a specific stores for plus size people do you wanna know it’s even more humiliating than having a belt too big having a belt too small that it won’t even fit around your waist nothing that has happened to me but personally it sucks. Also if you have a big chest it’s nearly impossible to get both support and be able to breathe and running it’s just impossible if you don’t want to feel like you’re having a heart attack and getting the wind knocked out of you constantly. And I don’t know about you but I personally believe I can’t dance either and that has nothing to do with what size I am other than the fact that I am very lethargic and bump into things way too easily because I’m on the larger side. Both sides suck being skinny sucks being large sucks it’s the same with being tall and being small the only reason obesity is trying to Bellmore is because I guess it’s more publicly known that fat shaming is a thing which is proven by society and the fact that i’m not even that overweight but I have never been able to go to stores like Abercrombie and finch or Lululemon or Hollister or H&M all of their clothes are way way too small and the clothes they claim to be plus sized always have one part of them that are too small.
my stomach hurts when I don't eat and plus i agree on everything on what you said
Wait you way 66 pounds
I can agree
Number 2 and 6 are not me but yes
I’m a skinny winny and I used to be Immune to the cold but now I’m not
I am SO SKINNY I can barely get  Enough hottness  😩
Seems like dancing to me
I'm the same and I agree with all of these 14746800%
I am skinny and i can dance
I am skiny soooo
I'm a guy and it's the same! Though I do have some unnatural fat in my chest because I took medication that turned my food to fat and it all piled up making a pot belly but the rest of me Is a stick plus I've worked out since then so the belly is gone but I'm still skinny! I cant get muscle because my metabolism is too fast and I've worked out for 6 years and I'm 17 yet 118 pounds! Yeah and I'm 5 foot 10 this sucks!
OMG I’m not alone
idk man those are some sick moves
Lisa and Rosè from blackpink being the main and lead dancers 👩‍🦯
I can relate
Your whole life baby doll. Whoever life is what ? 17 years lpl
As a skinny person i can confirm
Samesssssss im skinny but i want to get more weight but i hate burgers hate beef and pork😭😭😭💔
I know how this feels and I still do
I dont think the dance part has nothing to do with this😂
My brother is exactly the same
She looks like my mom.
So relatable... Sometimes I even have to put extra holes in my wrist watch 😫😫
Hell nah. youre too good looking, Specially when you showed those old pics of yours 💞🥰
I have 9 to 10 year old clothing
Im ten kg off the weight im under im turning 13 and im trying to be the weight of a 12 year old
Being skinny is the worst thing im literally using a blanket watching this and wearing a winter clothing
Me who has the opposite problem people litterly ask me to not eat👍anyways people who get comments on their weight/body shape YOUR BEAUTIFUL
Omg SO RELATABLE.
Skinny people problems.  I've been weighing 60kgs for 5 years and I can't seem to pick up weight at all
Is your couch infront of your tv made of sinks also
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh wrong timing I watched this in front of mom in full volume than God she is busy watching tv
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Well i am fat and still sometimes it can hurt to sit on some places.I guess its mostly generics in her and my case.When it comes to me,i am usually at home but i dont eat that much food.Sure but more than most people would but not that much so i become frickin 130Kg in my 17 years with 180+ cm height.Ive been trying lots of diets and what not but it doesent help much...so i guess its just genetics.Thats prob why she stays skinny even if she tries to eat to gain weight.At end of the day,its your body so if your ok with it,somebody elses words should not make you change yourself.
I'm skinny and this is so true. I'm severely underweight and I really want to gain more weight.
The fact that you were standing on a table top makes me think you have other problems you should work on
I’m not skinny and I also can’t dance 😂
This describes my entire existence exactly down the belt
Your skinny and flat
Me straight fakes
I'm always cold
I know I’m skinny too
Skinny person dance/the one twerk
The cold one is not entirely true.
I feel that
I agree I’m 9 years and weigh 75 pounds
the 5th one hurt although im like still young my mom already controls what i eat and slaps me when im not eating coz im also *SLOW AT EATING*
I hate when people are like do u even eat and I have to say YES U KNOW I DO
the dancing is just a white people problem 😂
Don’t worry I’m not skinny but I can’t dance tho
And Im Super skinny and I can confirm
The last one is a personal problem tho! 😂🤣
You can dance much better than me but as a skinny person I can relate
As a skinny person, I can confirm this is 100% true
You can dance better than me
I can barely dance
As a skinny person I can confirm and the comments they give me hurts like hell...I am just 13 man
I'm kinda short and pretty skinny, but also I can go out in the cold without a coat,, and be fine
Another thing is ppl think ur trying to get attention because you’re really skinny and you can’t help it.
WELL IM SORRY WE HAVE A FAST METABOLISM-
i used to be skinny and now i have a cute little gut. i love my gut.
so FUCKING under weight so many people ask if I eat and I will go shopping for clothes and think they'll fit me and I'll get home try them,on THEY DON'T FUCKING FUT MY ASS
🤔🧐🥳😘🥰😲🌹
What do you mean you're a great dancer
I feel your life
I’d trade you any day. Lol
My mom had to help me stand up on march 20 I almost blew off mount scott
I can confirm every part..
Same
Fr 💀
With the dancing I'm pretty sure thars a you problem
Don’t worry I can relate
So true tho
Idk bro those moves were pretty sick
I know it's the worst
I'm a little overweight and I'm always cold
This explains so much about me
This is me but more social
😆🤣😂I WOULD DANCE WITH YOU EVERY SINGLE NIGHT!!
Gurl I can't dance either and I'm thick 😩
Gym Bro has been summoned
I take meds because of my ADHD that are doctor prescribed but they have a pretty bad side effect of making me not hungry till like 10 Pm at night which is apver an hour past my bedtime so at school people make comments about me being so skinny like these are the ones I've been hearing alot Lately "does she even eat?" "She needs to eat" "this is why kids shouldn't be on social medias." And the most annoying is every single kid in my grade learned about eating disorders a month ago so now they say "Does she have an eating disorder?" And "Is she anorexic?"
I'm also skinny  but I can dance
I'm not that skinny but I can't dance
Skinny too and I can confirm this is all true
The fact that my parents say that I will break into pieces me who is 10 🙂
As a fat person some of this stuff isnt our problem but we do have some problems too. Especially society, cause they be telling ya " omg your like a balkon eat less  and exercise more" like b*tch im trying but it dont work
The dancing is realstable
I don't think anyone can dance, not even me
I can’t dance either lmao
Not me having the same problems but I’m fat lol
my life in a nutshell:
Confirmed
Eat cake
I used to be skinny when i was a kid and this is so trueee
Cringe as fuck
How about fat people problem
Do naagin dance
Do naagin dance
This is literally me.
I HAVE THE STRETCH BELT!!!! I THINK FROM WAL MART¿. I DK . !I GOT IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY 🎂🎉!!! #DUMPED FROM AN 11 YEAR RELATIONSHIP & CHEATED ON ALLL ALONG THE TIME!!!*  BUT GET THE SAME BELT I HAVE!
#####!!! EVERY DAY OFY LIFE!!!  LAYING DOWN HURTS MY TAILBONE!!!  I CANT GAIN WEIGHT AT ALLL!!

64.4 pounds isn’t a good weight for a adult you should get some help
How many mirrors do you have.
When you do sit ups you NEED a mat because of your spine rolling.
I feel your pain
Sorry, it's not an Attack, i Just can't tell of you're male or female
I can't dance either 😗😁
All of these are true I’m super skinny and I get badly judged a lot about it and that’s why I have 7 blanket’s
as a skinny person, True ( i HATE when people call me skinny so plz don’t)
For some reason it still gives me gender envy though, lol
I can really relate to all these things you're saying
4: hey... jay... ever hear of drawstrings?
I agree
I am fat as shit i cant relate
You can dance, just in your way. Screw it, embrace it..
DUDE I RELATE SOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH
I know the pain for number 3
This is so relatable. At my school, they have these chairs made of titanium-nickel alloyed galvanized metal (actually just hard plastic) but they hurt so much when you have to sit on them for more than 4 seconds. Then, once i hot to sit in the teacher’s chair, i found out how unfair it is. Also, another perk of being skinny, is im a god at hide and seek. I was playing it with my younger cousins, and of the 5 games I played, they never found me in 3 of them. I was seeking the other 2.
True 👍
Getting called things like twig, toothpick, or pencil suck. Or being told someone could snap you in half, or your gonna blow away in the wind, or go eat a burger also are a lot more hurtful then people think
Im fat so...
I love this chick sooooo much!!!! She has completely accepted herself  and there's nothing more beautiful than that.
Sick moves😎
I wish I was skinny
This is because most people are born with a natural body shape they can't get rid of and there's 3 of them it's skinny fat and muscular I happen to be fat even though I see skinny people who eat wayyyyy more junk food and stuff than me
I relate to all of those but I have extremely pale skin and freckles and I adapt faster to the cold than most people where I live but I started building muscles for cross country so now it’s easier to find pants that fit :D
Im the complite opisit and it absulutly destroys my mental health
I thought I was the only one that can't dance
I have to agree to this
I have these problems sadly
I flew away in the wind
All so true lol I'm still only 115 pounds lol
My dad must be in pain rn And also he's is terrible at dancing
Boo hoo. I’ve been fat my whole life. Trade ya.
I don’t think the last one is a skinny people problem?
Same
Legendary dancer
Try gym.
Stop the cap nice moves
I still think you are gorgeous💖, everyone has insecurities😘
Idk I think the dancing might just be a you problem lol
Umm did that scale say 665?
It’s soooo true and sad. Sometimes I hate being skinny cus I’m bullied by my friends
But you are lovely though
Don't worry your not the only one
Your dancing is cool
Being fat is worse
Facts I am very skinny too
I dunno why but she looks like a fkin handsome guy lol
Yes I agree but I get body shamed almost every day at school
Yeah i can confirm
it sucks being a stick with arms and legs
That's why I started bulking but I'm still skinny
So that explains why my friends get cold and I dont
Jayus ; I can't dance! Also Jayus ; *Dances pretty good*
Fun fact: i am 11 and i weigh 36 kilos :D
People don’t understand when your lanky and an ectomorph its hard to even put on weight 😭
Who really knows how to dance
Getting myself back down to a healthy weight but I was skinny AF 'til I was about 25. Constantly had bruises on the front of my hips from lying on the floor. Happy I don't have to worry about any of these things anymore... Still can't dance
I'm a skinny girl so typical
I tie two of my belt loops together
I’m incredibly short and in proportion I’m skinny and belts never fit me. However I have this one belt with two rows of holes going around the whole belt and so I can get it to fit. Second problem is that I never wear anything with belt straps so I have like half the loose belt just hanging. I use clip on chains to fasten it together so try that if you also have too long belts
Haha you can dance😂
Okay
I am skinny as a stick so my friends always say “ if a lion came they would not want you cause you don’t have any meat”
I'll take this to say some stuff about skinny peeps (as a skinny peep)  When you say that we are too skinny, we know, it's not like we can't see ourselves in the mirror smh. Telling us to eat more won't make us magically gain weight, we aren't skinny because we want. For the love of god, big companies, make better fitting clothing! Clothes there are longer and not wide, skinny people also suffer to find shit (adult section makes me look weird, kid's section makes me look like a clown). PLEASE, DO NOT, AND I MEAN IT, DO NOT MAKE US SIT ON A FLAT SURFACE FOR TOO LONG, OMG THAT HURTS AND IT IS SOO ANNOYING!  and that's all i can think for now, I'll hit this comment with new stuff every time i remember it.
Dancing looks ok. Having fun with it is the important part.
As a skinny person, this is accurate- lmfaoo
Confirm
As a skinny person I would have to agree
Better than I can damce
I'm not skinny I'm average:  But everyone should be treated nicely no matter what their body is like bigger, smaller. For society is like today is awful.  I should be long in a different era
I'm skinny and short but I'm a good fancer
Bruh I wish I was as skinny as u
Jayus: can't dance *buses out moves better than Charlie*
Imagine being fat now it sucks
I’m skinny to and I get cold so fast
I'm skinny as fuck but I don't lay on my stomach on hard surfaces? And I actually don't get cold easily at ALL Edit: Chairs with no cushions... OW
Keep it real, even if you put on weight you still couldn’t dance
Love the dance 💃💃
This is so sad.
I mean but you did benefit from adding weight didn't you?
I need therapy after seeing that dance.
Most of these problems are very true
“Go eat a fucking burger” is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard
Better dancing then
Frrrrrr
My dad fit into a 28 (size 6 in women's) till he was in his 60s
Being an ectomoph kinda sucks but at least we can fit in people’s walls like that one threat
U got some moves lmao
I SWEAR I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS AND ALL MY FRIENDS R LIKE “ omggg ur so skinny I wanna have ur body I wanna be U” LIKE NO U DONT IM A FREAKEN TWIG AND IT SUCKKSSS
Im skinny and get cold so easy but i never made the connection
I can’t dance:  Proceeds to dance
That last one isn't a skinny people problem from what I can tell
“I Can’t Dance” Everybody has that problem
Me: mum I get dance lessons?  Mum: no we have dancing at home. Dancing at home:
"Ive got to a healthy weight" The scale saying 66 lbs-
I can relate
Can dance better for me that’s for sure
Bro I feel you
Jesus loves you !
Finally someone who can understand,  but those dance moves go hard 😎🎶
Someone once told me "Do you even eat"                             It was my teacher
She wears shoes in her house call the police
SAMMMMME
Yea I'm skinny and people always say to eat something but I'm already eating too much lol
Me who isn’t skinny but dances worse 🥲
Im as more skinny than you like 24 kg and i can dance
HAHAHAHAHAAA!!!
Hahahaha my life in complete
663 BRUH
Thank you I'm showing this to my mother she will finally understand me
So just a bunch of normal people problems you think only apply to skinny people.
I’m going to be honest here I physically can’t gain weight
Yup, the story of my life
I think the dance problem is your own problem
Talent
The reason why u can't dance is because u don't have a dancing ralent
Yes
I'm skinny and 5 is what everybody says. Nvrmnd it's all true
A wise man once told me "Your beautiful just the way you are"
Trust me, you can dance better than me.. also just eat 1200,000 burgers then you should be good for a quick minute
I wanna get tall
I dance the same and you're good at dancing better than me
I can confirm these
And then when a skinny person gets cubby..  Society: Why don't you lose some weight? I mean.. your t-shirt is about the rip apart  Me: 👁️👄👁️ "WHAT-...You Fricking said that I'll break like a twig by the wind when I was fit/skinny and now you are saying that? Frick you"
#relate
I agree with her sometimes the public park chairs you will be sitting with your friends and you will be the one sitting on the edge and the go eat something huants you for life
The dancing is my problem but am FAT:(
I have to sit on cushins
Same I’m skinny and going on long road trips are the worst
yo this is how my life has been...and how it is
I'm the same
I'm pretty sure skinny people can still dance even if they're skinny
Im 9 and i wiegh 69 kg
That happens to me every day I live in skinny world and my rides get brused vary easily 🙃
#relatable
I'm skinny because of fast metabolism
Me a skinny person and finding this video: YESSSSSS
Haha I can’t dance either! And who cares what anyone else thinks about your weight. You do you boo. ❤️
Yeah i know how it feels
That is so true with the belt thing
NOT ME WHO GOT THE EXACT SAME BURGER COMMENT-
You call that not dancing?
I’m skinny and I get blown in da wind……And all this is so true
You are apart of the skinny gang
I can relate to all of them
okay but that dance was 🤌🏼💋
IT ALSO HURTS TO BE TALL I JUST TURNED 13 A FEW DAYS AGO IM 5 9 AND SKINNY AS HECK IM STILL GROWING TOO
Dances better than me ngl
Relatable, I was 80 pounds for years and am now 95. I am 5'8
I can see my ribs
Same to all of it
That last one is a you problem lmao
Still a better dancer than me. All I can do is wiggle **wiggles**
I get cold really often
Im also very skinny but I have the opposite problem when it's comes to insulation I just get to hot
I’m skinny, only 85 pounds my parents always telling me “I’m waiting for u to die” 😭😭
I am also a skinny little stick and I can't dance either
Bro I’m 14 and I weigh to less I weigh 97 lbs and average is 120 lbs
I can eat for days but im realy skiny
Thats better than i can dance
The dancing thing isn’t because your skinny😂. As a skinny person I learned how to dance really well.  The key is feet and leg shuffling.  Not… not whatever you were doing
Omfl this is so true
I have all these problems I’m not even a healthy weight but I actually don’t get cold tho
I love that day and the move
Lol same im a twig
As a skinny guy I got in a lot of fights mostly because they were saying some stuff about me being skinny they called me brittle bones Nikki until they found out my name was Nikki and I'm not brittle. 🗿🚬
i can confirm to this like my friends are like "do you even eat why are you so skinny" that shits fucked up
Yea but imagine being short people who are short probably get made fun more than the that one cringy kid
Joke: *The fattest man ever and the skinniest man ever meet each other*  The fat man says to the skinny one: When people look at you they think there is no more food on earth.  The skinny guy to the fat guy: When people look at you they understand why 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Minecraft skeleton sounds intensifies
As a fat person I don't understand
I was told that I was gonna fly away into the sky as a kid. I embraced it and started making airplane noises. But all of this is veryyyy true.
My neighbor really said to me the other day, wow. You are so skinny. My god
As a fellow pencil person I have to say you missed out that bumping into stuff no matter how lightly will result in pain
I am skinny because I am a fussy eater and don't like the shit my parents make me.
I’m 11 (almost 12) I’m small and always been skinny and it’s always cold
Holy shit that's true I'm skinny as hell
As a fat person I have the problems
67 pounds ????????????? No way
As someone who is very skinny I can say society is fucked up when it comes to skinny people. Like they say "eat less you will gain weight" or "eat more you are too skinny"
Beautiful
Totally feel you on all of that you should look into kore brand belts they work better than anything because I have the same problem...
My parents make fun of me for wearing floods but it’s because those are the only pants that fit my waist and legs lol
I’m fat and this girl’s still busting more moves than I can

”oh my God do you ever eat?” yes bitch! I do nothing BUT eat! I eat more food every day than you do in two days, asshole!
Better than my dancing
I'm skinny af and university life made me loose even more weight. I have wide shoulders but skinny legs and no calves so I had to endure "never skip leg day" and "where are your Calves" most of my life. Sucks but I'm still glad I'm not short or overweight
I don't think the last one is being a skinny person problem 🤧😅
Damn me-
What do you mean you can’t dance You jammin
Do you do dancing lessons if so how much do you charge?
Same here but i found zyzz
Those dance moves were just 🕺🤪🤠💃🏼
Mj is skinny and he is KING OF POP
12456 apply to me
I'm skinny and im the t-shirt guy in a blizzard
As a literal blob, I cannot relate to this.
The last one is not a skinny person problem it is a problem every body has
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Who says you can't dance? Cause you'd beat me in a dance battle.
As the smallest skinniest 12 year old that's in g 7 that is called supposed to be in g2 I am telling you being skinny is horrid
I’m skinny but I’ve always been known to be a good dancer, some people have their flaws some people don’t
I am thin
Fr thou I feel u
Confirmed
Well I guess I’m lucky than lol (sorry if that offense you)
As a fat person , cannot confirm
Wish I was a skinny, have always been chubby
Confirmed. If I dance like that my teacher would send me outside the classroom
Belt not fitting is a problem I understand
My mom’s friend:Omg your skinny eat more lah  Me: *eats more and becomes fat like she wants me to* Also her:omg do more exercises you fat monkey  Me: *confusion*
Same...
There’s some fat people problems to
I feel your doctors said that they would pay me to eat KFC  because my weight was so un healthy but I was healthy and I racked up a total of $270 and the doctors payed for It
I've been skinny my whole life when it was summer wen someone turned on the AC It was cold and made my stomach hurt
WHAT
I.can.confirm.
Dude I never heard anything more relatibale
Literally story of me life
I can't put on weight for some reason either and I'm 6,3,its awful but I'm healthy somehow
I am still living in it and I am way skinner than that and I am 13 that weights 89 pounds, sad for life 😓
“I can’t dance!” Continues to bust some pretty sick moves
As a fat person fat people dance way better
Better than being fat... My sister eats chocolate sweets and shit she will not get a single kilo  And i eat healthy i sport every day and im fat😭😭😭
LMAO I'm skinny and this is so true
What was that first dance move like thf
I can't dance either
As a big person I can’t confirm a single thing
Looks like a fine dance to me 🕺🕺
Trust me, growing up skinny is way better than fighting obesity your whole life.  Commenting on any kids weight or dietary habits is a horrible mistake for so many kids.  You may not be as graceful as you think, but you are way hotter dancing now than you think you are. That’s the limit of what I feel comfortable saying.
I confirm this true. You have my words
It's worth it for me -_-
"I can't dance" woman I'm fat as heck and you have better moves than me!
This is relatable. 😭😭😭
YEP it's so normalised to comment and make fun of skinny people's weight, my BMI is like around 15 and there's virtually no way to fix this other than go to a doctor and get checked but my dad refused to do so because he thinks I don't eat well. Though I eat like a kilogram of fat (and not really) food 3 times a day. Puberty hit me hard, you can tell My family also used to make comments about my weight all the time and they were saying that these were compliments because being skinny is good🙄  Oh lmao btw my butt is all bruised from sitting on flat wooden plates that school chairs have instead of a seat
𝙵𝙰𝚇!!!
My brother feels the same
I have a good bit of insulation
Yes you can. You can dance probably better than fat people. Not as funny as fat people tho
Im fat:)
As a former super skinny person who had to run around in the shower just to get wet fully, I can honestly say that once I hit my mid 30s.... My big girl body came in... Now I can sit down and not have to rock back and forth to stop the numbing pain in my hips, butt and backs of my thighs and I still have a great figure that now actually looks like an hour glass and I couldn't be any happier about the way I am shaped now. But living a very active life with playing sports and dancing didn't make it easy on me to gain any weight at all. Once I broke my back in 2016, I had to slow down for a few months as well as being thrown into my 30s which is what I'm being told is the correct time for our bodies to do exactly what mine did.... Just be patient and keep in mind that eventually, it'll change up on ya again and once more apparently in ur late 50s early 60s during or after menopause. Take care and thanks for the funny AF and interesting content! ❤️
As a skinny person, everything except the dancing is true
The dance part is a you problem
Tbh i prefer skinny cuz i can squeeze in tight spaces better
I can understand this so much! I'm also skinny.
While dancing you looked like Shaggy.
Yes I can confirm to
That’s true tbh
"I can't dance"  *proceeds to dance*
as a skinny, tallass female this is true… ;-;
No, jayus. You can't save b because you're WHITE. :P
Last part cap
Finally someone understands
Jayus dancing be like: time to to chimkin time!!
Is he a boy and he wears girls shorts
Lol your so right
i don’t know how many times i’ve heard my parents or other people said go get some meat on my bones like go eat something but i eat like a idk but i eat so much yet i’m just not getting anything out of it so ya idk
Worst thing I've been asked was by one of my "friends" he had asked me "are you anorexic?". It felt pretty awful to hear especially from a friend, I'm pretty short and very skinny, all of my friends, even the ones who are my height or slightly shorter, can pick me up pretty easily. I do eat, I just have an insane metabolism. People tend to act skinny is like some sort of choice all the time, and then say you're privileged when you tell them it just happens.
You're not super skinny and you're not big. You're pleasantly in-between.
Like Bro DANCING IS HARD-
Finally, someone who GETS IT BEING SKINNY
I was told by my teacher to put on weight
I'm like you I know what it feels like
You're  better  at dancing than  me tbh
That belt one hits close to home
YES I UNDERSTAND RELATABLE!!!
I can relate
You know, i would rather be skinny than fat.
You at least got better dance moves than me.
Agreed
I relate with this so much especially with the comments people make.
Dat is It I'm going to stop Losing Weight
I feel that but they also bullied me causing me to get skinnier because of anorexia
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS! Ive gotten messed up as a kid for so many adults calling me a stick.
I'd still love to have your crazy metabolism.
The same things are happening to me society I can't dance
Broh soo true
My life
You can’t win. You’re harassed if you’re skinny, you’re harassed when you’re fat
I’m also very skinny and the waistband on my pants/shorts always are too big.
I can confirm all these I am only like 50 to 60 pounds and I'm 10 and I eat LOTS of food still
The dancing😂
I’m fairly skinny, but like, if a shirt is long enough, I’ll wear it until it’s unwearable anymore. Also I wear long sleeves and pants because otherwise it’s cold.
Are you a girl or boy
Same thing for me
Im 11 IM 4’5 AND IM 60.6 POUNDS THATS NOT NORMAL FOR ME PLZ GIVE ME SOME TIPS PLZ
All of these are a problem for me and I’m fat
The last part tho
My family has commented on how skinny I was all through out my life and it always makes me really uncomfortable:’)
Get sturdy
I'm 12 and I way 60 pounds and this is true
I NEED WARMTH TELL ME HOW TO BE FAT
I'm kinda obese and I would rather have those problems than mine ·-·
And I’m not skinny just a little fat
I can’t dance too btw this is my mums account
I had the same problem with you until I legitly ate so much and just started bulking
You dance perfectly fine jayus
Ikr to this
I'm SKIIIINY
Time for the skinny-above average weight alliance
Yes I can tell your racist
These are all SO TRUE
Every single one of these are true for me
“I can’t dance *proceeds to dance*” -onlyjayus  Me: I’m way too skinny also but sounds like a you problem
Since I was both overweight and underweight I understand both problems. I was 120kg(264lb), and fell to 48kg(105lb) in less than 2 months. And now I'm finally at some normal weight 70kg(154lb).  I had problems with both but not as much as with being to skinny and now also. Laying on my stomach doesn't just make me bruise, but I can barely stand up because my ribs hurt to much. My back is in much worst condition now than before, because of lack of fat on back. Ass hurts abnormally cause, again no fat. Any type of punch or hitting something hurts waaay more. My stomach just can't take much food, meaning I'm more tired and dizzy. On a plus size, EVERYTHING fits😂 But yeah don't wish on being skinny, it's awful.
I'm insulated waaay too much
THIS IS THE MOST RELATBLEMFUCKING THING EVER
"I cant dance!"  *Proceeds to bust some moves*
I am skinny and i can tell bcs of my f#*king life I CANT DANCE IM TRYING TO COPY ONE BISH
I have I weird problem where when I try to gain wait I lose wait I can feel my ribs
HOLY FUCK THEM MOVES
I was told recently... I can't date a woman who I can fit both ass cheeks in one hand... my lucky day... he was a nasty gross guy.
I feel that
FR THIS IS SO TRUE
FRR- I remember when I was only like 10 I had to put a tack on the wall to hold up a banner and my cousin the same age as me had to do the same. (She was not big or skinny) my mf aunt goes “uhhh let your cousin do that and go eat urself a burger…” LIKE M’AM I CAN PUT A FUCKING TACK IN THE WALL
the belt one happens to me but I'm not skinny at all
Can confirm
🤣 this is funny but I so relate 🤣
I will gladly give some of my fat to any one
I don’t think the dancing is bc of being skinny
I’m skinny to even tho I am
Yes to all of those, and even worse is being tall and skinny bc no pants are long enough and they also don't stay up 🙃 and if I remember correctly you're super tall lol
What do you mean you cant dance? That was some Michael Jackson right there.
I got called a discombobulated twig
I am so skinny that my watch is too big for me  This is all too true for me
I can relate
Yea I feel ya
The dance lol
You dance pretty well Better than me at least
Nice chucks btw
who ever said you can not dance is wrong, you dance really really well, and better then me so you got that going for you
i’m a skinny person and i understand COMPLETELY
You said that thing is  f   Up to say to a kid I’m a kid I’m 9   you just said it to me🤯🤯🤯 how dare you say that
Same
Bro people get called CHICKENS because people are skinny
@onlyjayus ur the coolest YouTubee ever especially since we are foster kids
I’m going from belts to suspenders. Way more comfortable. 😂 I don’t know how many holes I’ve poked into belts growing up. A lot though.
Yeah i can relate, i so skinny my ass pains even sitting on sofa, cold weather feels very cold, and i look like a early teenage boy in my early 20's.
Okay but as a skinny person all of these happened
I'm sorry but who told you you can't dance cuz you slayed babyyyyyyyyyyy
Saammee,
Bro I'm a chonker and I can't dance what's ur point
I fucking hate being skinny and I can’t help also these things are so true
Relatable.
The belt🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m skinny to. It hurts
Easiest dance is the Cha-Cha or Elmo Slide
Oh no, you can dance. Don't ever say that you can't.
Wtf why is this so true as someone skinny
I literally hate how skinny I am like bro💀
Ich will nicht dass jemand sagt dass das eigentlich gut ist. Ich bin sehr dünn und hab lange Beine. Hosen zu kaufen ist quasi unmöglich!  😩🥺
So true as a skinny wrestler I have to wear a fight suit instead of a singlet
Same
For a hella skinny girl I can relate (I am skinny cus my parents are I can't gain wait for some reason it will drop back to the amount after a day😃😃😃)
Finally have a good reason for my bad dancing
I can confirm this is all very true
So true
Relatable
It's soo true. I have the same problems
This auto correct sucks
I meant to say all of them from skinniness
Yeah I’m skinny and I have all those from Mom
Jayus: Tries to dance Also Jayus: **Proceeds to get possessed by a demon**
The first one is so accurate I can barely sit in a chair for more than 5 minutes without getting uncomfortable, that’s why all the chairs in my house are padded
I'm the same way
How the fuck I’m 13 and I’m twice the wait
66 kg?!
Me too but I don’t give a shit
Definitely because of skinny
Only people who said my dancing us good are my parents and everyone at that wedding when I was like 7or 8 and started freaking dropping on the floor like a ninja turtle going in the sowers I felt amazing
4 and 6th was such a  personal attack as a skinny person🤣🤣
My 9 yo sister is very skinny that I remember this one time it was really windy and she almost flew if my older sibling didn't catch her
Girl you got better moves than I do soo
RELATABLE FINALLY SOMEONE ELSE
I barely eat even if i try i dont grow any weight
“I can’t dance” Me who has worse dance moves than Bella: ._.
So true
EXACTLY, THANK YOU!!!!
The cold part is the worst by far
As a skinny person I’ve been made fun of and looked at as the skinny kid, they always said “Oh it’s just a joke! Chill!”
Wish I was skinny lol. I'm too fluffy
I'm fat and I can't dance.    siting hurt's to me too.
Hehe
Holyyy saaaaame xD
“i can’t dance” yea i can tell 💀
Your stick of course you can't dance my grandma can dance better than you
Relatable
The dancing one is just....something else. At least you don't look like a fucking jello bowl when you move any part of your body like me.
Facts for me
Can confirm a i struggle with my weight
The weak comments are the most annoying
Now i feel better about being fat
As a fellow skinny person FACTS no one understands
sameeee!!!! i always got clothes and was sooooooo exited and they never fit.
I remember my family making fun of me being skinny when i was a kid..
You're 22 right?? Drink some red Bull 😙 but not much, Red Bull has a ton of caffeine so you will become a little bit thicc overtime
I sorta know what you talking about I'm not skinny but one of my good friends are and people are calling her pencil girl and shit like that and it pisses me off alot
Bro she dances better than me wtf
I used to be skinny but luckily for me it was just because I was a very picky eater
Are you a girl or a boy no affection
I’ve heard skinny people are very wiggly soooo i think thats a dub
That's still dancing it's free style...girl I can't dance eaither that's why I don't dance in front of ppl
I’m the same way like shit is crazy
I wish I was skinny like that though
Im very skinny u can see my bonesssss and pepole bully me like "dont u ever eat" " are u forcing yourself to not eat" "get meat in ur bones" "your gonna break in half in the wind" although lol i get blown in wind sometimes lol
Lol me
I have super insulation
Sorry to say this but something else you might want to look out for, people who are skinny and tall are susceptible to having the small sacks in their lungs rupture. If you cough or yell too hard you could damage your lungs. It happened to my friend had to take him to the hospital.
Most people can't dance, but point still stands
Me skinny  Everyone else: man your do skinny go eat  man like wind will push you  Me:it happens
I just wear baggie hoodies so no one says anything
As a skinny person I can painfully relate
I am very skinny and I really want to be healthy but whenever I eat healthy people always are like "your skinny enough" do you expect me to just want to eat a burger for breakfast?
To be honest same here im 19 and my hole life i have just been all skin and bones
one thing i can notice is that why are you allways on a counter top lol
As a skinny person I know if this stuff is true,                                  it is.
Why are fat people problems the opposite, yet same
I thought I was the only one with skinny people problems LOL
U gay or wat
I used to be skinny even tho I ate a lot, now I'm super fat and can't eat shit
The dancing u
Haha that's why I am fat. Oh wait.
As a skinny person, I can confirm the first one is true
So facts I’m skinny to
Mi little cousin is so skinny that I call her a little stick idk whyyyy😀😀😀😀😀
I would rather be skinny you can have this stupid fat 😂😂
Al of this is true i can confirm
bella i think the ‘ can’t dance ‘ thing is bc ur white
Jayus: "Being skinny is the worst." Me: "BIT, I AM SO FAT THAT I DONT FIT INTO A DOOR.
The f
she’s only 68 pounds. geez
We can never be good enough, wether we are too fat or too skinny😕
I would rather be skinny than be fat like now
I'm also skinny and I can    relate
Me*a skinny person* : *confirms*
I'm not even skinny but belts still don't fit. Idk what belt companies are doing
My family always says " come on eat you don't eat anything " Me like after every two meals : I think I'm about to throw up "
I felt all of this on a personal level lol
i cant dance Proceeds to dance their heart out
Debra Morgan
I use cloth belts that dont require holes they just kind of lock themselves in place
Yes
I am skinny but a really good dancer other problems can relate☺
Your dance moves aren't bad,I mean their better than mine
Don't forget toothpick lol 😆
I have no words it’s literally describing me I thought it was weird for having like pain  when I sit down and stuff like that
this is so true!!!!!!
I was born chubby
Subscribe to me for memess
That was the best dancing i've ever seen
As a 6''2, 68 kg guy... I can confirm. Especially the dancing
Finally, someone addresses, because I've been a twig, my entire damn life😭
I feel ur pain
GIRL SAMEEEE
I'm skinny too I approve
As a skinny person I agree and yes I can't  dance
i thought that sitting down on a chair and your ass hurting after 5min was normal
You should be happy cause when you fat everyone trouble you about it
Oh you can definitely dance
Wait six is a skinny ppl problem..? 😭
The can't dance thing is a white person thing
Jokes on you, I'm in a healthy size     Yet I still have all of the problems. Also I can't fucking run cause I'm short
As a skinny person i agree with Sitting Laying Cold Extra belt holes like alot I cant dance either idk if its skinny people thing or not
Nah bro I chubby BUT THAT'S OK
As a skinny person it would be hard to keep warm and wear clothes
As a skinny kid I can agree and all of thess
As a overweight person I think we get worse comments from society
Thats how it is, so true.
That dance was fukin amazing i don't care what anyone says
So true
Same
I've been suverily underweight my whole life too and I keep getting people saying "that's a problem I'd like to have" I know they're making a joke but, they don't know the issues that it causes me besides clothes being too big
Oh good it’s not just me
This is the most relatable thing on youtube
I don't have 1 of that problem tho im skinny too my weight is like 44kilograms
True
I relate so hard
this is me
At least when you dabce you dont look like 0Oo0oOoo0OOo0
"I can't dance" proceeds to boogey down like a fucking God (BTW its not your ability to dance, it's your ability to not be immediately infected with social anxiety)
“you’re so skinny you should eat more” “wow you’re eating a lot be careful so you don’t turn fat” ???
Jayus: I can't dance.  *proceeds to pull off the sickest dance moves in the history of dancing*
I'm sorry if this offends someone, but actually tho why can't you just eat something to not be skinny?
Me a skinny person: FACTS!
Nah you can dance
Skinny people rule
I was skinny when was a kid and i totally agree about society  But as i grew older i was a little bit of healthy and society be like look at her she so fat me be like society will never happy of anything
Relatable
Doing sit ups makes my spine hurt so badly I have to lean on one side to sit up
If I give my mom a hug I pretty much  stab her with my bones.. also when I was 7 someone came up to me and said " I swear you could eat 10 cakes and you still would be really skinny" yaaaaaaa :/
*laughing in overweight*
Sit ups hurt my fucking back
Yeah, pretty much it, but hey if you play a couple music games you can solve the last part
I got the same problem I was 35 kg when I was 15 and my 7 year old sister was 46 kg
As a fat person, I don't relate
This is so true
I'm skinny but I can't relate to the getin cold fast
It’s not just the skinny ones who can’t dance
Yea same
Same
Oh and some skinny peoples' thighs aren't thick enough to catch things like when you drop your phone and you use your thighs to catch it some skinny people can't do that unfortunately
I vibe with the not being able to dance
🥲🥲🥲
Bro I’m skinny as sh*t and my clothes NEVER FIT
Story of my life
I can relate to all of this lol-
I’m skinny to
As someone who was always called a stick as a kid, I had huge body problems the second I couldn't instantly see my ribs. (I am 5 6 and a half and 115 pounds)
The secret to the pants waist problem is find someone who can sow the waist and make it smaller
At least u tried to dance
Welp time to DEVOUR A CAKE well I’m all ready fat 😄
Nice moves
If my pants are to big i just roll them
I used to be very like 44 pounds at 7 and yes I can confirm
Finally some one like me
What are you talking about you can dance 🕺
You can still dance better than me
This is true. And everyone at school always calls me skinny
I have the same problems
Ah yes because 66-67 is a healthy weight for an adult
I don't have the sitting down issue
She seems flexible when dancing. Also I love it when I’m cold.
SO TRUE
I'm fear scin by I can stay warm it very cold the north
CONFIRM I have found my people who also have this problem
Im 9 and i way 56.1
U can dance
Number 1 is true
I felt this so much
Same still struggling to get to my goal weight
Your dancing scares me😨😨😨
Came here for the facts, stayed here for Emmas dancing
I'm skinny and my parents tell me to eat more 😢
Relatable
All of these are so damn right and being 14 and starting to meet a semi healthy weight is nice.
im hella skinny and as she said skinny people get cold faster im really skinny and my family thinks i have a cold or fever when im cold
Yea dudes I eat everyday and still weigh under 100 pounds. Gotta problem with it? Unfriend me then, that’s how this works.
*sits* Ass : im sorry,But this is gonna hurt
I feel you
Bro I am skinned as hell and I can do orange justice
Don’t forget YOU CANT RUN WITHOUT LOSING YOUR FUCKING LUNGS OR TASTING YOUR OWN BLOOD WHEN YOU RUN-
Your me but older literally
As a fat person, id still rather be skinny Clothes dont fit You look unbelievably unattractive to most people You get too hot, leading to more sweat, leading to worse body odor And if it getd bad enough you get chronic diseases (im not sure if there are chronic diseases that come with being skinny) So yeah id rather be very skinny It wouldnt be great but itd be better
As someone who is constantly compared to either a telephone pole or railway rail, I can attest to these. Despite me not really doing any workouts and eating a lot, I’m still skinny as hell- also very tall.
How about the wind actually being able to push me around if it is going at a moderate pace, I will never stop being terrified of getting blown into traffic.
I can agree with this
Dance shesh
I wish I could be skinny I'd rather that
If someone calls you fat, just say " I'm not fat your just freakishly skinny "
I have too much insolation 🥲
“Ewww why the heck are you so skinny” people would say to me. Like frick off
I am a skinny person I do dance
i have been pretty skinny for as long as i can remember yet i have been competitively dancing for 10 years
Me being skinny af and seeing this like yoooooo
"just poke new holes in the belt" I know that feeling
The struggle of being a guy
As i am skinny to i shal comfirm this is true
I don’t know why but I can’t figure out your gender for the life of me
Relatable
I can agree, I have been skinny since I was a kid, I looked like Gollum lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im same and my grandpa always says u need to eat more missy but like in a nice way hes never really rude unless i get mad at my mother then i get in trouble by him but ya u know what i mean and i agree with every thing u said
It sucks being skinny as a kid and shirt
Fat people problums the same but skinny be replaced with fat
Literally my classmates started putting they're fingers around my best friends wrist and saying g how gross her arms looked I beat em up 😃👍
All the people that see me just say aww he's so short
Someone needs to mention that scars and bruises take much more time to heal when you're skinny
So true I'm 11 and 67 pounds
It's not like ur skinny so u can't dance, i am skinny and i have won a lot of awards for dancing like real awards and i ain't shaming yuh but yes u need to practice on ur grooving first,and i don't make any sense do i
Omg legit thank you.  I've been this way forever.  The belt holes and the eat something shit
OMG I KNOW HOW U FEEL I HATE IT
Yes thank you
Slayyyy you have beautiful dancing skills
Me who wants to be skinny   🤷‍♂️✌.....idc still gonna be skinny :)
I think the dancing one is just you
Fucking relatable
I also used to be skinny , but i exercised my body over it's limits and now i am buff and beefy.
Better dancer than me😂
I agree with the last one
Yea i am pretty skinny as well but i walk in shorts with -5 celcius
As a walking talking skeleton I can agree agree all of these.
Yes..... Even I can't dance kpop as good as my lil sister
Oh shjt, jayus is me
I think you're dance skills are good...
I’m 13 and I’m pretty tall but VERY SKINNY I have to wear size 6…. IN KIDS and because I’m tall the the pants will come up to my shins 😩
Those comments were always the worst.  I can't help my metabolism is higher than Cheech and Chong 😭
What do you mean you can’t dance? Those are some excellent dance moves my friend
Same I ate like 8 snacks today and am skinny at fu
I think you are just bad at dancing
Me who weights 60 at 12
Same I am also skinny
It really is hard to have the metabolism of shaggy himself, i feel ya
1. You can dance  2. That isn’t a skinny person problem. But you have nothing to shake (not bad)
How to loose weight
I'm so skinny the wind almost blew me away.
The bullying was the worst
I’m not skinny and I can’t dance
I can relate couse i am skinny as a stick
FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT LMAOO
I feel this
You just described my life in just 60 seconds 😂
As someone that has stretch marks...fuck you...nah jokes Ur vids are awesome
As a skinny person  I cant relate to this  Tbh  I aint even cold  While my parents are not skinny and still cold  And my clothes are perfect  Society is pretty cool as well  Im average now (my weight) But its still the same
Me just watching this laying on my stomach on the floor 👀
U can dance better than I can 😭
I have one word for y’all:  SUSPENDERS!
Weird. Since I’ve gotten chubbier I did get better at dancing!
6'2" with a 67-69 kg is still skinny. However skinny people normally feel less cold & leas heat, if it's because of high metabolism & not a disease. I am skinny, with high metabolism.
For me, it’s the people making you put your fingers around your wrists to see how small they are :) also, I’m skinny and I do hip hop 😂😂
-just eat -just stfu
I mean hey your moves r better than mine
as a skinny person I can confirm
“I can’t dance “  🦟🦗🦟🦗🦟🦗
I think you're pretty
“But you look great! Don’t change anything!” Bro I’m like 20 lbs underweight. No.
Yeah laying down I was the my
Your dance moves are great
My eyes started to hert at the last bit 😦
Same
As a skinny persom, I can confirm.
yes very true I am skinny and this is true and I also cannot dance
Same problems
You just cant dance cause your white i can confirm and so can the rest of my family
Dance moves better than me
Everything but the 5th one was, and still is, a problem for me lol
I'd rather have your problems than my chubby problems
VERY RELATABLE
they  can see my spine when i bend over
She can dance she just ain't got no moves . Just joking jayus.  Luv ur vids
True
Relatable, but the clothing is usually using jacket
U can dance SHEEESH
Been told my entire life I need to gain “health weight” when there is NO problem
I can relate
As a fat person, can't relate
Who else thinks the dancing is good ✌️
Jayus, your moves are amazing
As a skinny person I can relate
A good thing about being fat is that you can just jump up and down and you'll look funny enough that people will think your dancing
Hold up with that scale says 66 lb and she's over 6ft tall?
The dance thing is a you problem but I agree on rest
I CANT DANCE!   Hum…mmm I think that’s a you problem….
Well 1 time I almost got abducted by wind so I  see the point
Last one is just white people problems
All relatable af
I can’t dance and I think I’m fat so
Same here 😭
I see poking holes in my belt as a achievement
She dances better than me soooo 🧐
Why is this my whole life🧍🏽‍♀️
I would get the food ones
SO TRUE I barely have any meat on my butt so it’s really uncomfortable to sit up straight
I can confirm.   I mean you dance better than me so that’s good
Thank you FINALLY someone get it!!!!!
Oh my god I have all the same issues. I was 6'7 and 140 when I graduated high school.
As a skinny person, I can agree to this
YES I AM SKINNY AS F**K AND THAT'S SO TRUE
I relate to all of that but I'm got good moves 😌
rlly is.. my dad told me to eat a burger :)
The most beautiful dancing I have ever seen
Literally the kids at school whenever I throw away food that I AM ALLERGIC TO are always like “oh my gosh that’s why your so shinny you never eat!”
People : Just Eat Skinny Guy : I wasn't on moon all this time. *Don't say a word after and wait for them to say something because said stupid thing and now either confused or be feeling stupid*
I'm so skinny..  I take dance class.... and I'm the best dancer in my class- so the last no but all of the other one yeah
I’m in six grade I weigh 70 pounds
DAMN LOOK AT THOSE MOVES ITS WHITE MICHEAL JACKSON oh wait that exists nvm
Facts!!!!
My Aunt once said "oh my god please eat something you are so skinny" I'm sorry but I'm a child and you look the same as me!
YES TH AKS
I’m a small, skinny af and eat more than everyone in my family and I’m still tiny
The best dance right there
I could relate
That dancing is better then I can do
How to get skinny tho
She’s 67 pounds?
The comments are the worst
You can Count my ribs easily and see my heart beating
OMG I RELATE TO EVERY THING SHE SAID
Bruh I’m skinny af and idc about the “comments” like mf too sensitive
What are those kind of shirts called??? I love them!
“I CANT DANCE” starts busting moves
I feel u
I absolutely hate ppl telling me to put meat on my bones. like alright Staci, I'll get right on that as if I haven't been trying to get to a healthy weight for years now
I'm also way too skinny cuz they barely eat
Don't judge yourself
Explains why I'm always wearing jackets
Well, at least you dance better than me because I suck
Exactly what I tell my teacher but she doesn't listen
I can confirm the dancing one 100% correct
I’ve been the same I am a VERY skinny
wdym i ass always hurts when i sit and im normal size.
I am skinny, but the only thing I face is the cold one. Aaaand maybe the last one
Dude I am thirteen and way 86 pounds I can relate
The last one was just skill issue
This is so true especially the dance one but most people don't dance because it's embarrassing but if you even have the courage but you're skinny you're going to just embarrass yourself
I was so skinny when I was on a hike with my family I almost got blown off I was like five
I’d rather be skinny than as fat as I am
Brooooo y can I relate to thissss 😫
I agree with all of this
Can dance because I'm skinny, meanwhile Zendaya 💃💃
Im skinny too, btw nice dancing
I'm skinny and i eat a tob of candy and I ate a lot of mcnuggies
It's so true😭
XD! Im a littaral twig tjo.
I relate ton this🙃
Same
I still feel I would be happier skinny
Same with me
Im the same
I feel you
So true!
Do you have any idea how hard it is to sound like you have authority when you're yelling put me down
me too
Her:and I cannot dance Also her: *dances better than me*  me: THE FU-
I know who your girlfriend is
"I CANT DANCE-" *proceeds to go on world tour*
Idk what y'all think but u look awesome ❤️
Being skinny and 6'2 😭
This is true
I can't dance eathier
If that ain't dancing then I don't know what is
"I can't dance"  Seems like a you problem and not a skinny problem, but the belt thing sucks
As a fat person, I can't relate. Still wish I was skinny tho.
I'm skinny but not that skinny
I’m going through this rn. It hurts me so much, it makes me hate myself.😣
Middle school is so strange the boys fat shame but the girls skinny shame like wtf pick one I way freaking 90 pounds
So relatable I Shane been so skinnny all my life
Fr real
These r all so true. Well except for the dancing one cause I think that one was just a joke haha
I liked the laying down I saw some nice stuff😏😏
I can’t dance to lol same
I feel you
what do you mean those r dope moves
My personal favorite is: „Did they stop feeding you at the age of 3?“ That was probably meant to be offensive, but I died laughing lmao
I got the same dang problem with that lol
I was called fat as a kid and into my teens. At 18 I lost a bunch of weight and until I was 27 I weighed between 130 and 150 and was told I was too skinny. At 43 I weigh what I did as a teen. I don’t care anymore. I’m either too fat or too skinny.
Samemmeeee
I can't dance       R u f kidding me u killed it
The Dance 😂😂😂
My mom hid the scale because I was checking it constantly because of how skinny I am.
I 100 percent agree I’m 11 and my parents are trying to get more meat on my bones
I'm just as skinny you
Im skinny as hell
Can confirm these are actually true
It makes me fast
Can confirm I'm really skinny
Elastic belts where you can poke it anywhere works pretty well try those
Yep same I skinny as hell if someone look me from the side, they can't see me
I cant tell is Jayus a guy or a girl?
Then they hit you with the "You're fat" "Get a diet" "Don't fall you'll destroy the world" The hell is this society It's even worse with growing insecurities
Ik your skinny but, 66 pounds damn I'm skinny and weight 112
Im so stupid are u a girl or a boy ??
Yeah that’s about the way it goes 🥲
So true😂
Atleast you dance better than me
Then when ur fat people make fun of you aswell
It’s the getting cold for me as well as clothes not fitting not being able to dance and the comments too
As a skinny person, everything you say is painfully true, especially the dancing
As a skinny person this is true
I’m only skinny because I have a high metabolism
That's me at every disco/party  I'm skinny but not as skinny as before lockdown
I’m like 71 pounds and I’m gonna be 13 on October 7 of this year. Is 71 a healthy weight? Edit: and no I’m not anorexic.
Fakes
Same
Except for No.4 and 5, it's not a problem for a fatty like me....  But ig No. 4 and 5 affects me even more than skinny people.
Correct 😭
“I can't dance”  The dance:  Me: ✨Po'fécïon✨
relatable AF.
You know what is funny… The first time I saw her I was like Hugh, she has a nice body… like I wish I could be so skinny but now this has been said and I’m like… Just like I HATE THESE BEAUTY STANDARTS DAMN
Relate
Us skinny people have the most warmth no matter how cold we feel
She can do a cosplay of the ‘You know I had to do it to em’ guy
I can't  dance either when ever I try I look like a dog chasing it's  tal
I am 14 and I way 27.1
As a skinny person i can confirm i get broken in half like a stick in the wind
Don't worry, I can't dance either.
I really didn’t care up until she said I can’t dance 😂
Same but I can't put on weight like why
Sometimes people skinny as 1 hair on your soup is because most of them have high metabolism      "Sometimes people skinny as 1 hair on your soup is because they are skinny" my mind somehow.
Number 3 is so relatable cos I’ve been slightly underweight for the past 2 years now
i am a skinny person and i agrre
That last one is on you… 😂😂😂
I feel your pain
Still flat
Same bestie
I know right
Yah.......
Me to
When I tell you I relate too this sfmmm
You could get a mesh belt for the belt hole issue
Testify for us all girl, im 57,...been using a large zip tie, or romex iseasier n quick.
Im not skinny but I'm fat but I think we both get similar people comment but I think ur perfect
Oh yeah, here's another one, SCOLIOSIS, Noone told me I would be having the back of an 80 year old at 12
Same
Can confirm get bully by my teacher that there is heavy wind
people forget that skinny shaming is a thing too…
THIS HAS BEEN ME MY WHOLE DAMN LIFE!!!!
Used yo be like this
Confirmed...... 39 kg
Don't worry, all white people can't dance.
I'm skinny as fuck too, but you didn't have to remind me
When I try to dance my mum says I look like a worm
My siblings bully me bc I'm skinny and day oh tour fly away close the windows  But they secretly don't know it hurts ;D
She wont break in half in the wind, but she'll fly away if you open the car window while driving
Very relatable as a skinny person
It's happens to me
As a skinny person, this is true society is truly ( probably spelt wrong) cruel
People always friggin commenting on my wrists 😤 I have an unintentionally large gap around them and people will always notice them somehow
Yes i can relate...
i can dance
Damn you only 62lbs? I'm 10 and I am 82.4lbs
5. Told that shit too as a kid. I now have weight issues but also have an eating disorder to stay small since I gain weight now. Doing better though!
So relatable!
Lmfao I'm the opposite; I be a fat bitch and proud 😌💅
Finaly some one understands
FINALLY THERE IS A PERSON TO GET IT OF BEING FUCKING SKINNY    I'm 4'8 65lb 12 year old
I had enough comments on me being skinny in middle school and started working out.      I am still skinny but at least I tried
OMGGG STOP DANCINGGGGGGGGGGGG
Your 66 lbs im literally 12 and 104lbs
I agree I am part of the skinny community and I am 12 and just now hitting 100 lbs and I am 5'4 but if I was dedicated enough I could fit in like a tiny drawer under the sink
Idk if the dance part is a skinny problem but being fat doesn’t make much of a difference ig…
Y e p QvQ
Nah that’s what I call dancing.         Btw it will scare my brother lol
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME 😩😭😩
WTF
3 is very Relatable
Therapist: "Dancing Jayus can't hurt u, she isn't real" Dancing Jayus :
Honestly I didn't even know jayus was a skinny person until she said it herself She looks pretty normal to me
My cuisine is more skinny than you and I have seen him in a blizzard waring Sandals and shorts
Very true
I’m not skinny but this helped a little bit with my body dysmorphia. Stay positive
As a skinny guy,I can conform
Your my sist🙂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Basketball woman
I feel your pain😭😭😭
Can confirm skinny my entire life atleast I'm tall though also I am skinny but I eat ALOT but I also end up accidentally fasting for days on end because I forget to eat so that may explain my problem
I have been ugly and fat as f-ck my whole life and I recently got into a healthier weight just recently. People said fucked up things about my weight my whole life as well💪🏼
I was skinny but I got fat then hit the gym now I'm thin w 1%moosles
Can confirm. Im 5'10 135 lb, though unlike most I have high tolerance to cold.
You bones ain’t the problem for your dancing
Being skinny Don’t mean you can’t dance lol. That’s just you lmao
Omg, fucking right?
these are so true 😭😭.
im skinny as hell so yeah the uhh cold thing is my thing
I got these problems and I eat so much food and I’m still skinny
ok as a skinny person all is true, but I've eaten a lot so im hoping to gain weight!... this isn't going to happen is it...
I relate to all of these and I have a solution to the can’t dance part just vibe to the music(I am a terrible dancer)
Danced pretty well
Speaking of eating, I fucking forgot to today. Like how the fuck does that even happen.
Yes someone know what the f I'm going through
Too skinny, too fat like bruh
All them simps pausing the early pics
All of those are true
THATS ME! I have been skinny and I can’t not get extra fat all It is, Is skin and bones I have no fat it’s just muscle skin and bone😪🥴
I have these issues Fun Fact: I’ve actually been pushed by the wind before
I know about the skinny problem lol
Same
None of those are dance moves those are just moves, if you want to know an actual dance move look up Square dancing. Because that’s actual dancing everything else, is just people waving their arms and legs around, like a bunch of idiots.☺️
I CAN RELATE SOOOO MUCHH OMG I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME
Bruh that dancing though
Nice dance moves Jackson 😂
reason:cant danc3 i think thats juat called being white
That is so me except the public comments, the laying down and the sitting down part.
1. When you're fat (like I am) sitting sucks because often you're scooting the chair away from things (like a table or other people) and have to think if it can hold you. (This is more with worn chairs) 2. It still hurts your ribs to lay like that, but no bruises 👍 3. suuuper hot most of the time, especially when doing something. 4 Clothes are too small and most XL+ shirts are made comfortable, not good looking.  5 I hear people say, "don't fall over now, you'll shake the whole building" and "stop running your bubs are bouncing/ get a bra"  6. No sane person can dance LMFAOOOO
So true though
the dancing kinda reminds me of Cisco Ramon from the flash 😂
Now I started eating more and I just started working out so now I am in good shape and healthy weight
I am 12 and Weight was 70
Are you and Mattie dating
Good to be fat… Don’t take that out of context…
but she CAN say racial slurs
One time i wore a short sleeve shirt and I got called a twig multiple times
People comment with no remorse not knowing the damage they create. I had someone tell me to put a sweater on cause I looked cold.  IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER 🤯🤬
Fun Fact: You can’t smile and breath at the same time!!              Jk, I just wanted you to smile!! You are all perfect just the way you are, and don’t let anybody forget that!!
Don't worry lmao your dance over are on par with MJ lol
Whelp the dancing 100% will give me nightmares
I thought at that last part you where having a  heart attack
Ya got to realize she stands on the sink for videos
Skinny problems: even if you eat so much, you dont get fat
You can too
Yesssss queennnnnnn
Great move’s
I hate skinny problems especially the pants one and the dancing
I am 9 and my own friends make fun on how short and skinny I am
You can dance it's just horrible as fuck
I don’t understand when people do this because people say oh your to skinny but when I put on some weight people say I’m to fat and it’s really fucked up when people say this because it’s just confusing and I suffer from depression and it’s really hard for me when they say this
as a skinny person, i am ALLLL of these so your not alone 😌
I have all of this and I have very bad skinny people problems
I don’t wanna be fat :/
I wanna be u
I am a skinny person and I can confirm all of this
I'm not underweight because of my height, but I am practically bullied at school because I'm so skinny. Twig is my nickname
The last one is a YOU problem
Na bro sit ups on a hard floor Jesus Christ
It's like when someone says "go eat a burger" but when it's "go eat a salad" like it's a whole nother thing and I get in trouble for saying eat a salad
Yea-
Can u pls make this same vid but not swear.... I wanna send it to my parents annd I cant, I rlly want them to understand that saying comments like that again and again to kid can mentally hurt
Sammmr I’ve been the tallest in my classes for like ever but I’ve always been the lightest and I’m always cold 🥶 🥲🥲👹🤡
All the fat people: *triggered AF*
I'm literally the only one in class wiggling all over my chair because I can never be comfortable in those wooden chairs 😭
The lack of dancing ability is not only exclusive to skinny people some  fat people can't dance
I hate being chubby but wow,I never knew skinny people had these problems
The sitting part and pants is really true
im super underweight and people are always telling me to just eat and stuff but my body isnt used to it and i get full super fast so sometimes ill eat like 1 meal a day
*"I CANT DANCE"* Dances better than i can
Idk man those looked like some funky moves haha
Yeah I'm currently going through this and it is not fun
That's all with me but guess what I don't get cold literally ever
You can dance better than probably half these comments including me so
Fat people  Am I a joke to yoo...
I've never been skinny but in can relate to not being able to dance
Dont worry girl it will change xd i was skinnier than you and then i hit 35 and boom rounded like a cheese ball
All of these are me:
Dancing part is a you problem xD. For your info I am a skinny person so I can say this without getting backlash mk.
I'm closer to 60 then I am 50 and chairs still hurt my boney ass, I'm still cold af, and belts still do nothing but pull my pants down faster.... You can dance... you just have no rhythm.  It's okay.  Just dance!!!!
Best dance moves ever
THANK YOU 4 TELLING THEM👏👏👏👏
it’s the too big pants and being cold for me 😭😭
5 tho.
Ur not cappin
most of these were so relatable. I'm VERY skinny and underweight, sometimes my ribs will show. I'm such a picky eater that I don't like HAMBURGERS.
I can’t dance either and I understand
Yes
And to this minute i didnt know you are a girl
As a fat person,  Nobody can dance. Ever.
Totaly agree
THIS IS MY LIFE, I can dance tho. I'm 15 and ai weigh 108 pounds, NONE OF MY PANTS FIT
Yes skinny people do have problems... but people only talk about the opposite problem most of the time
It’s the comments for me. They literally drove me crazy as a kid
I’m 6’4” and only 60kgs
Haha that’s me
I'm skinny as well
I feel you Bella…
I just worry about my gf's weight. They get amazed cause I wear t shirts in negative degrees... I'm trying not to talk about it too much.... I'm not skinny, in fact if I ate a fruit cup I'd probably gain ten pounds which is exaggerated... But I thought about these issues a lot.
Can confirm, been skinny whole life, now at 205 tho
My personal favorite is “Oh my god you’re built like a twig” MF I KNOW
Why do people think being fat just insulates you?
Skinny people are flexible That’s an exception
Along with the bruises on my ribs I get them on my hips too
100% agree
As a skronny mf I can confirm
Am I the only one vibin too?
Same
It’s okay I dance the same🖤
Sometimes I feel like I am the *skinest* person in the world 😐
As an incredibly skinny person this is rly relatable especially the go eat something part
OK the eating one. My friends always make fun of me because of it because I can eat so much food still be hungry but I’m a toothpick I think you’re scared I come over to their houses I think they know I can get them out of it
I’m skinny to I can agree
Ok now I know that I am skinny probably too skinny
Sure, blame being skinny for not being able to dance...
I know the struggle. When people say I need to eat a burger I'm like B**** please, I could out eat you, AFTER going to an all you can eat buffet.
Dude. I relate to this way to fucking much. It's worst when you get comments as a kid FROM YOUR GRANDPARENTS at Thanksgiving like "how do you eat that much and stay so thin and skinny...thats not fair to the rest of us".
This is my life
I relate to all of rhis
I'm not skinny, but I wish I was
I sent this to my friends and they stopped talking about my weight and made sure no one else did this
So true
I am skinny I am also ALOT younger than you and I agree with this
Really my brother
I relate to all of these as I'm naturally underweight and have been my whole life-
I got a friend that is so skinny, so I showed this video to her. She felt like she was the only person that was that skinny. That's why your the best
I am skinny and run track and cross country so I am a very fast also builds up leg muscles to have a thicker butty so it doesn't hurt that bad anymore  I also eat 15 time every day and I am still a tooth pick
I am skinny to
Me being skinny and really white and short , good :no  diatiary needs . And I cand do a mean Squidward dance
I used to be skinny as fuck, but then it became such a problem that my parents tried super hard to get me eating, and once I did I was like "aye this shit kinda good" and now im chubby.
Fun Fact:if you are skinny you can wiggle
Sameeeeeee beach!!
🤣🤣😂
It’s so true I am sooooooo skinny
Facts
As a skinny person who can dance and bust it down  I think the last one is a you problem bestie   *THE BELTS THOUGH, THE FUCKING BELTS OH MY GOD I GET THAT, I NEED TO MAKE THEM SO FAR UGHHHH*
You can definitely dance you are better than me at least And I’m a little overweight
Im 14 and 60 pounds, I can relate to all of this
“I CANT DANCE”      *proceeds to do the best dancing I’ve seen on TikTok*
My best friend played xylophone at my ripes
The only thing I disagree is the dance one I can
XD that’s my sister right there. Especially the last one
I feel that both opposites have their pros and cons. I have struggled with extra weight since I was 12. It was better at one point but now totally screwed up again. And the issue for me is the opposite. I'm short and chubby. So no matter what I wear I don't look good. And even if I was like in a normal weight and not chubby, I still had hard time finding clothes that fit because I have a wide ribcage and quite big b👀bs. So no matter what top, jacket or dress I wanted, everything was meant for flat chested or tall people.. 🙄 Also never could wear a bikini even if I was in a normal weight, because of my stomach (I had abs but my stomach still wasn't flat). So I kinda understand you but at the same time I still think society accepts more skinny people than chubby/fat ones..
As a skinny gal i can confirm this
If animals could evolve like in pokemon and there evolutions were painful af then I think  jayus dancing is what it would look like
TRUE!!!
Been skinny on and off mostly been due to stressful living plus alcohol i dropped alooot off weight one summer and experienced all the symptoms you described it was painful hated feeling my joints outside of my body if you know what i mean. All the bones and nick-nacks. Tried the get fat or die trying method wich is basicly just a dirty bulk, thankfully im naturally athletic and love working out so almost none of the weight i put on became fat. Just good ol muscle. (This is not a flex) You should see me when i flex, it's far more impressive.
I've been skinny most my life and now I have a rare condition which put 5×the amount of weight and I wish I could be skinny again 😥 😔
Why I'm cold right now lol
Me: 6 ft and 140 lbs, skinny asf  Also me watching this: I’m not alone?
This is very true because I am very skinny and I relate to all of these things
This is relatable I weigh 31 kg
duude you just explained my whole life - except -  i can dance
Nah that dancing is suburb, very nice
Finally someone said all of this!
Those dance moves tho  🤌🤌🤌
As a fat person all of these things apply to me
Well I am 26 pound last month i was 22
I'm skinny to
Im the lightest out of most of my friends and I’m defo not the shortest so I can definitely confirm
I’m not skinny but all of these are true but #5😀
I understand it hurts to sit for to long 😭
It’s true all of these skinny people things are 100% true
as being 60 lbs and 4'5 at 12 years old it is hard to go to school every day i get into fights because i can't take being called short i have to take a 80hd pill that makes me not eat.
As I’m watching this I have 3 blankets on
Dat was some good dancing
I like being skinny, but all those problems are real, especially 5. Fuck those people
100% Relatable
Hold the phone.... you weigh 60 pounds with one foot on the scale!!! I was double that :,(
I’m extremely skinny. This is all true
I hear that.
You can dance… anyone can 😁
That last dance is so funny
Skinny is actually better for the winter. Fat holds cold more. Which is why my body is the ultimate summer body.
As a skinny person, my friend who's slightly overweight ALWAYS pokes my stomach, awing about how skinny i am, and its fucking annoying.  I keep telling her to stop in a serious tone, but she just laughs. 😐
So true my ass hurts when I sit on a cahir which is not soft
I feel you bc I am also skinny
Fat problems - going on a roller coaster you turn into a blob.
U can just build muscle at the gym
The dancing thing has really been a problem for me. I was a competitive dancer from the ages of 2-11, and I CAN dance, but because of my skinny arms and legs I just look stupid.
She can't dance, maybe bc she is white??
Why am I the same weight as you I'm 13!
Are u a gurl or a boy
I've been skinny as shit as while forever and I agree especially with that 3rd one 4th one and 5th one
as a very skinny man i REALLY think this is true
My brother is super skinny because he has a fast metabolism
GO eat that how I got fat
You didn't have to call us out like that tho
🙄😂
You can dance what you mean
Don't worry fat people can't dance to
Bahaha!!! I understand!!
I am also so skinny so i can relate so much
Bro she costs 1 elixir
As a chubber I do not understand
Ok ok ok , everyone has got their own problems . I think you'll find solutions to it
Are you a boy
Nah u can dance
I am VERY skinny, and that dance one I can agree on 100%
Ask a skinny. I can relate to all but I can dance
Can heavily relate to all except first and last. I'm tall and like 100 lbs so yeah it's annoying
Not only do you get cold quickly, you overheat just as fast. It's currently winter in Arkansas and its snowing and I've only have my heater on for 45 minutes and I'm already dying of heat.
I only  have  1 problem  my ribs
I'm going to be honest you would look hot in a suit and shades
I'm skinny but can't get cold 😈
The dance
I could never relate more to anything as much as i relate to this vid
That is literally me I am skinny and I am just skin and bones my family stuffed me with food as if I am a rotisserie chicken or turkey for all that and I feel like I’m going to explode half the time I hate being freaking skinny I want to be at least a decent weight
Those moves tho- 😂✋
At least ur tall tho ( imagine if this gets pinned )
Super relatable “RUNT” is stuck in my head forever
Bruh the end is so frickin funny for some reason
I can relate
I think the dancing a personal thing 😂 but most the world cantbdance including me...
atleast you know *how to* dance right? 😂😅
Man so relatable
Same here as a skinny person I can confirm this well insept the dance part I can dance very well I think
As a member of the skinny society, i can confirm ✅
You can dance alot better than me
Im fat and i also cant dance
These are some sick moves I ain't gon  l lie😂😂😋.
SO TRUE! Been skinny since 8 yo and it's hell of a stigma in my society. Just makes people treat you differently.
Nah the dancing one is just certain people
Lol this is me
Bro! She can dance better than me
Me also be to skinny
That last one isn’t cause ur skinny, it’s cause ur wyt
Very true when your skinny and short
I'm very skinny myself, only weigh about 125 Lbs, yet I'm almost 5' 10" and have some decent muscle on me. Like, you can count my ribs and see all my joints, which are almost twice the width of their respective limbs.  Also, the example you gave for number five was almost word for word on what my Mom and Nan said to me when I was younger.
As a skinny person I agree 😭💀
Skinny people problem
😂😂😂😂
As a skinny person sitting on wood is very bad
This is very true
As a thick person my pants don’t fit and according to my mom all women get cold easily since they get periods having meat saves you from nothing I be shivering and I actually was skinny and was told to eat not I go weeks without food since I’m told I need to lose weight ☺️ we love the correlation
Omg i can so relate to this
Yeeeeees and no.5 I eat so much my doc had a mild stroke... but I'm a twig......
I was like this for about 7 years, and FINALLY balanced out with the help of something called not moving all day
I feel so insecure when people tell I'm so boney
I am now 13 and since I was like 7 people are like "Omg your like a stick" I'm also rly rly short. Like she said, I'm freezing all the time as well as having no clothes that fit me.
Damn she got some moves and that comes from a person who cant dance at all
i know your 6'2 but you look like your shorter when you started dancing
As a chubby person, I give my hoodie to my skinny friend all the time. Also because she just likes my clothes
I’ve been told I’ve been too skinny I worked out wasn’t allowed into the gym until now and you can still see me fucked up ribs in my skinny waist and ankle so I gave up I still get my muscle But even though I have a lot of muscle I still look pretty skinny from certain angles
Yessssss
I’ve finally been able to get to a good weight and I still have those problems except the getting cold easily
It's called getting a belt for your size
Literally just said everything I have
As a skinny person I confirm and the only good thing is that we are very flexible
Number 5 is just something that I’ve lived with since I was like 5 :(
I mean That’s how I dance
Such a beautiful beast
Its kinda similar to fat people laying on your front breaks ribs instead of bruising
Not to be mean or to be a hater but those dance moves made my laugh so hard that I peed a little bit
Same
flat
I think that dancing thing is just you lol
Did the scale say 67 pounds (could be kilos) but geez I’m 13, 5,2 and I weigh 125 and people consider me small
My two skinny friends are both dancers  They also complain about a lot of these things
U got da moves
Omg this is literally me!! I’m way too skinny bruh it won’t freaking change
The 5th one is the most relatable, even my friends would make fun of me.
“pop yo shii twin”
Def not me wishing I was skinny cause then I wouldn’t have as many insecurities
I mean I actually Am to
WHAT THE HELL
Skinny people can dance just look at Napoleon dynamite
Sis I feel you 😭
I feel u dog
I’m skinny and I hat picked on and it is hard sitting down and I do get cold quick
As a super hella skinny 12 yo that weighs 80 lbs and is 5'1, yah l, I get it. I've been asked if I was anorexic a million times
I can't dance  I think that's my whole family and only my younger brother is skinny
Im naturally skinny but I eat a lot XD so I get this
I’m skinny as fuck to
And you think that we none skinny people can
This is facts
I’ve always been pretty skinny, and when I was younger I was gluten free and vegetarian, and I was (and still am) very very picky, so no Becky, I didn’t eat.
my friends always wonder why i wear warm clothes even in summer but heat doesnt effect me as a thin person as much
Finally I found my long lost sister
I love the videos but plzzz watch saying gd.....Srry it just bothers me as a 15yr christian..OOO and i got like 20 friends n fam watching u my grandma says "o o my *giggles* she's so talented...Lia...what's wrong with u?
I understand all too well
These are all true
Can confirm all of theses
I'm also a skinny person too, so your not alone!
God this is true
The amount of times someone has told me to eat a burger…
I'm skinny and my friends throw me because they think I can fly
Nice moves
YESSSSS- I GET SO COLD, AND PEOPLE JUDGE ME CUZ IM SKINNY ASF-
I CAN RELATE 😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 crying and laughing so hard
As a skinny person, this is VERY accurate. Especially society. I always get bodyshamed growing up.
me being skinny: …… *calling my doctrr*
Another skinny problem is that when you do sit-ups on hard floor or floor tiles your spine rolls on the floor and it’s really uncomfortable. That’s why I only do them on carpet or on something soft
At least u can lose weight
food
Wait 66 pounds
Clothing is worst for me I have such long legs too 🤣
I also confirm this is are kind
Yesssssss same
guess that's why I dont get cold easily
I can relate because every time I step out of a pool I’m shivering so bad, and then some overweight kid gets out of the diving pool fine
one I’m skinny af, two, I HAVE THAT SAME BLANKET
Don’t worry I have the exact same problem🤣
All the problems of my life
I feel the pants thing but it makes it worse when you're also tall
The last one
Not being able to dance had nothing to do with weight.

I know it's sucks
Yeah and when growing you overheat SO FUCKING FAST
65 really my nine tear old friend weighs more than you
This is so true 😭 I can feel my ribs through my shirt and I have to sit so awkwardly to not hurt myself
I get this so much, I weigh like 90 pounds and I’m fully grown, I tell people how much I weigh and they look at me like I have a third eye 😂

Skinny people problem try doing situps just straight on the floor, not on a mat, it hurts and hurts to see other classmate able to do it

Your name is bella

As a person who is skinny, i can confirm the knowledge in this very YouTube short.
My eyes
Me:I CANT DANCE!!!!!!!    HER: IM A SKINNY PEARSON, I CANT DANCE!!!  ALSO HER: DANCEI G SO F’N GOOD
Im a person who has never exercised in their life but I’m the buffest in my class and I have a good enough build so I’m pretty happy with that perk
When i dance i get cramps even when i walk for like 5 minutes
I’m 12 and I way 70 pounds and I’ve been told SO MANY MEAN COMMENTS I have to wear AN XXSMALL
When I was younger people called me skeleton but when I CHANGED MY BODY they started calling me fat. Now I  know to love my body

As a skinny person this is all correct especially the dancing part
Nooo , i want my wife to be as skinny as you, i like skinny women
Im kinda skinny but i have a huge belly which makes people think im fat, my ass hurts from their stupidity and from the chair
I don’t think being skinny makes you bad at dancing
That dancing screams GAY tho lol  Im not saying its bad

As a skinny person. I can confirm dis pain

True
Yoo fr and also if i dance it looks like a fricking pole is drunk and swaying from side to side, doesn't help that i am 5'5 and just 14!!
Why is this so true
Damn I never thought a skinny person goes through this. My whole life I'm not skinny
Your dancing skills are better than me! Good moves!!
I was this way till I was 15 I'm 17 next week and I still can't dance for shit
Just eat more. Fast metabolism? EAT MORE. Works for me :)
I have these all the time except I’m never cold
The only thing is an advantage of being skinny is when people are chasing yiu and if youre lucky and you find an area were only you can fit you get away
Bro I'm 125 pounds and I'm 14
In the third grade I was like really *REALLY* skinny, and there was this one windy day (I mean really windy) and I was at recess *AND I WAS BLOWN OFF MY FEET 6 INCHES INTO THE AIR*
We are gunna need new rich people. See war is the devide
YES SAME
I grew up to being told I looked sickly even though I couldn’t help it. I literally made it a point to eat until I didn’t feel good growing up because everyone told my I was too skinny. I just stopped caring and it kinda stopped so that’s cool and stuff :p
well at least y’all ain’t fat. You can’t take your shirt off without getting shamed, you can’t eat anything too unhealthy, you have to pretend you aren’t fat to not get shamed. Both suck
I’ve never been skinny so I can’t relate. Many of my friends are skinny and they’re always cold.
Why is this so true
Her : i cant dance  Her : starts dancing like a professional dancer 😂
I'm skinny and underweight. 89.4 pounds now. I'm trying to eat more to gain more weight but no matter what i do I keep loosing weight. My friends continue to tell me to eat although I can't help it.
You and Mattie are all over my fyp
U did.ok
I agree I’m 14 and only weight like 60 something I weighed 1 pound when I was born I can relate
I hate all of these problems too
I found a fix to the belt problem theres paracord belts that are honestly a life saver for skinny and fat people
You can dance It’s called the skinny person dance
So true
I’m very skinny 😛 forever I am skinny
I HAVE ALL THESE but the comments were said when I was a kid and left lots of problems because I was short so everyone wanted to pick me up and I would be called bones, sticks, skeleton, or be told these thing
These problems… yes I have these problem, I surf and you have to get up like a seal and my hip bone things get bruised bad
The last may just be a you problem 😂
lol, im skinny cuz I cant afford fatty foods everyday.
I'm fat
I relate to this especially with the cold one
I can confirm it hurts to be harnessed for being skinny
When a random vid explains ur whole life lol
*her* I can't dance   *Me* hey your better then me
lol when i started losing a bunch of weight the cold thing really pissed me off
My weight? 89 when I finish eating 91

Aquard

Facts. It sucks
No, she can dance
I’m skinny but I’m always warm I never get cold ever lol
I didn't think skinny would effect your dancing! I thought it was just a matter of having rhythm
My dad literally bought a specific really thin screwdriver so he could punch new holes in me and my sister's belts. My sister is now 22 and im 18 and we still need the screwdriver every once in a while
OMGGG IM SKINNY AND IT HURTS TO SIT SO BAD IN CLASS
I’m in the 1st persentile in weight
Your dance moves are better than me don't feel bad about thats
I CAN RELATE SO FUCKING MUCH
:I can’t dance  Me: oh umm I “can” umm ya don’t mind the quotes
Im opposite of you and i have a lot of problems that a lot of people wouldn’t think about
Same
😂 I found my twin 😂 I can't dance either 😂😂
AAAAAAAHhhhhhh I know!!!!! I only wear skinny geans.
the dances are making me hyperventilate
Yeah most of these have happened to me.  I like, 80 even
omg same these are so relatable
good thing im thicc
I got the same blanket
At least you have a good height.
I'd say that is some fancy foot work. Idk what you mean by you can't dance
666k views lol
I can't dance either so we're the same
I know skinny people that can dance really good
I’m skinny and this is all true
The thing is I wanna be skinnier-
I could bicep curl you
My classmates constantly picking me up because “I’m so small!”   Honestly doesn’t usually bother me but sometimes it gets annoying. I’ll just be walking in the hall and then all of a Sudden I find myself dangling by my book bag when the Gym guys decide to pick me up. It’s all fun and games until they realize how short I am and drop me awkwardly.
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH BONES IN MY ASS.  THAT SHIT HURTS  School chairs. Are hell.  They hurt my ass.
Omg you are the same as me
As a skinny person, I Can confirm
Yeah, definitely all true
I think I heard a few bones crunch n crack when she started dancing
I'd prefer skinny ppl problems tbh
HELP I RELATE   also I liked at 666k
Better dancing then me
Ikr
Today someone asked me if I ever eat.. it hurt
The dancing 🤣🤣🤣 But neither can I
I'm always so hot it makes me uncomfortable I only really wear sweatpants love baggy shirts and I like the children sections clothes better then what fits me I only care about what my family comments on and already can't dance sooooo
Meanwhile us fat people: 😑😑😑😫  Okay kidding BUT STILL-  Giys I'm joking, y'all are beautiful 🖤💖🖤
Groovy... im skinny too... why Is this all true
Complaining about being skinny is like complaining about being tall.
So damn true I’m skinny✨💀
Can I draw you?
Bruh I can completely relate to this. My sister is always telling me that I shouldn't have any problems with my body bc I'm skinny but girl this is the truth.
A can't dance to
Same I'm so fucking skinny that I do sports not to get into shape but to gain more weight
Yeah my whole family always says stuff like “you need to eat” “you need more meat on your bones” and then when I do eat there’s always one person (aka my aunt and grandma) saying stuff like “if you keep eating like that you’ll be a fat pig in 3 days”
Man i feel this  I am 15 years   1.87 meters tall  And i weigh 54 kilograms  I rly feel this
Bruh any skinny people want my life? I got a lot of extra fat you can use.
Omg fellow skinny person this is sooooooo true
I just got out of the hospital after going a while without eating I’ve lost a lot of weight so now I can relate
Bro but the cloths problem is a fact  and I hatter it i have to modify them after I buy them
You sure you can’t dance? You look like a professional!
I wear oversized stuff and it looks kinda ok
I can relate
As a skinny person, can relate. Random story from when I was a baby. My mom would be asked to stay over night at the hospital during check ups as the doctors always thought either A. My mom was not feeding me or B. I was not eating enough. It was only last year that I checked my weight and am finally in the 130lbs and note I am 5'6ft
Did that say 627 pounds :troll:
You forgot one thing: scooters hurt 10 times more
What’s worse is being really really tall and skinny because I would have to wear a size, like, mens 20 and have to tie them off with those strings, then wear a belt OVER IT
I’m that way too but one time in middle school a kid told me I was super skinny then said that it was a complement 🙄🤷‍♀️
I’ve been a skinny person all my life I’m still in school and when we do PE My ribs hurt so much (we have to do like 300 push-ups.)
That last one is a white person problem. Not a skinny person problem.
this is literally so fucking true every single thing you just said
Beautiful dance moves
Oh yes this is me but I'm healthy
Relatable.
I was the same way until about three years ago, my growth finally slowed down and my appetite grew a bit, little by little, I put on weight and reached a healthy weight, now most of that neutral body mass is muscle, but a few months ago I had an issue with a gland in my mouth and couldn’t eat right for about a week, in that week I lost somewhere between 8 and 15 pounds, fortunately most of that was fat, but I dropped a size in pants so now I need a belt that I haven’t in almost 2 and a half years
I don’t think it’s being skinny that is why u can’t dance. I think it’s cause ur tall! Lmao I love your videos tho! ❤️♥️💜
U want my lobster
I'm not even skinny but this seems like hell to deal with
I’m glad that you can relate with a lot of people
I'm a fat girl, but none of the fat went to my butt. Instead of the weight being distributed evenly, all the fat went to my upper arms, my thighs, a little on the back, and then mainly my stomach... I kinda look like a reverse hour glass. Being this kind of shape, pants don't like me. They just slide right off. That's my main goal for losing weight, so pants will actually fit.
Idk dude, you really boogying
What do you mean you can’t dance?  You’re a natural!!!
I am skinny but I think I have a bloated stomach- Is this normal for a skinny person or am I just getting more body fat there to prepare myself for a growth spurt since I’m only (not saying my actual age) around like the teenagers age I guess-
Facts
My whole life I have been able to see my rip cage 😭
As a chubby person i envy you, lemme give some of my flesh lmao
Ur a better than me
so true I'm skinny af
My dad had to poke two holes in my belt💀💀
I’m not fit but I can’t dance either
coming from a dancer: you dance amazingly
Don't feel bad I can't dance either
When you way less then me:
Wow that helps me as a fat person
If you go to dance class will give you better dance skills
Wow im fat as fuck and sitting down is glorious
People tell me to eat food
Actually you can and very well at that
Doing sit-ups is literal torture
OMGGGG is that why my ass hurts??? I thought all humans just had that 😭🤚
I‘m ✨unskinny✨ and I can’t dance either
Good it’s not just me with those problems 🤣
All of these are problems for me too very similar
I'm very skinny too and when I dance the only thing I can hear it's a Minecraft Skeleton being attacked...
No what people told me and my sister is that we were to skinny and the wind could knock us over. It hurts. Don’t be that person. People that I had an eating disorder for a while when I didn’t
I'm 42 kg.. is that healthy bc idk
Lying on my back hurts more than on my front since my spine just digs into the ground and it also is the same with sitting on a chair and putting my spine on the back of the chair it just hurts
YOU WEIGH 66 POUNDS?!?! I WEIGH 105
Can confirm it’s pretty sad. My friends, parents and grandparents 🥲🥲🥲🥲
I have the same problems 😐😂
I can confirm
I have been body shamed my whole life because I’m skinny and medically underweight and now I have a problem where I eat way to much but now I think if I eat to much I’ll get fat
I'm thin
Skinny or not you are cool
Ehm! I don't think being skinny or fat matters, i believe everyone is beautiful in their own way. Ohh and by the way your gorgeous
👍🏼yep
I cant dance and I am fat af dang 80 pounds over hear
Yo, I never knew my problems were so relatable. Especially the belt one. I have one of those riveted belts that you can poke anywhere. Best investment ever.
Bro ur dance moves are on fleek
I feel ya
This was personal
I can totally relate especially the eating and dancing part 😅
Me and you
Her- can't dance  Me- watch Lisa Manoban😆
I'm a skinny person and I can tell you I eat soo much but I'm just so skinny and I can tell ya the society will say things like " did u eat yet " omg ur parents don't feed you " u could blow away right now by the wind " let me see if I can hold u with one hand " *proceeds to throw me to another person  * then I became a freakin ball to them 🤬🤬
Meanwhile me having skinny body whole having fat arm:
I relate
You can clearly dance!!
Im also way under wait and skinny, and the same issues. So this is true.Also your either sweating or freezing, but it comes in handy in summer
tell me about it,
I can definitely say this is true as an underweight skinny person….
Another thing that sucks is that since we are so skinny there is no weight meaning that on windy days you get knocked over my the wind. The actually happened to me on more than one occasion.
Hahaha same yes as a certified stick I can confirm
The dancing is just you
I mean, that’s dancing if I’ve ever seen it 😃
Trueeeee
….I don’t think that last one is only a problem for skinny people 😆
Bruh you dance better than me
Better than me
I have been skinny too….. I feel it.
As a skinny girl... I can confirm all of this.
I will tell you society was the WORST for me because I'm skinny Story: I loved sweets and I was known for bringing sweets or snacks to classes or anywhere in general when my friend said "when you see money falling from the sky, don't get it that's how terrorists lure you" I wasn't thinking and said "I would die for money" his other friend called me a money loving gold digger but after saying "I was gonna but candy" he called me a fat ass but he still said "at least you are eating food you must be starving because your so skinny" that just made me walk away and cry for the rest of the day PS: that is one of the reasons why I'm so scared what people think like if someone says I'm fat I won't eat for a entire day.  PPS: please watch what you say to people because people like me take it to seriously and might change there entire life for just one comment you made
YES THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY MY WHOLE LIFE Edit: whenever I do sit-ups in the gym it hurts like absolute hell,
She didn’t stand all the way on the scale
O MA LORDY THATS THE BEST DANCE IV SEEN IN MA LIFE
As a skinny person I can definitely confirm 😥
You are wearing my shoes.
I used to be skinny but now I consume... barely any FUCKING food and somehow I'm skinny fat , if you don't know what I mean I mean I grew more outward more than side ways but I should be on the brink of death cause the amount I eat is unhealthy cause I eat a couple bites and go to my room unless the food is actually good , if the food is good I might take seconds
So true, I am 10 yrs and I had to go to the doctors because I was under weight
Never feel cold I just wear layers and the reason why my pants fall down because I wear shorts on them
I can eat all I want I'm always going to be skinny the only problem is my teeth
But I'm overweight and people say go get skinny dont eat so much and then when I was skinny people told ti go eat something and now I'm still over weight
Someone tell me where I can get that giant blanket!
OMG same
I am also a twig man, everyone things I was the person that played as the stick man in that kids movie
Ira ok i am to and more that you and i have to go doctor i broke out i am now a little verter ira ok 👍
um im a skinny person and i can dance
I can realte to this sooo much
The buttbone hurting is the most relatable
As a fat person, I understand why I’m pretty much never cold now.  I can’t sleep unless the thermostat is at 60 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the lowest it’ll go.
FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT  "your so thin" "ewww i can see your ribs" "it's not that cold" "Your so skinny i can put my fingers round your wrist"  It gets annyoing after a while ✨🤪
This is so true
Gym time
Problems I’ll never understand
😂 I finally found someone I can relate to on all levels... including the dance
No one can dance we just say we like that and it becomes a trend
I can't dance  either
Can confirm
You can dance better than me 😏
Girls from dance mom's be like 👁👄👁
My parents think I'll blow away in the wind storm
I can't dance too!
5th one 😭😭
I’m  a skinny person,and I agree!
Bro I dance like that
Relatable
I feel like i'm the only human on earth that was born with a wealthy weight and never gained nor loosed weight
At school I always get made fun of and told to go eat a burger and I'm only 11
As a child: You're so skinny you should eat more and do less! As a teen: You're getting fat you should eat less and do more.
As a skinny person this is a 100% accurate I was know to be light weighted so a lot of people said some stuff that hurt
That dancing is the best I could see that dance on just dance lol also I would nail that dance cause I dance like that lol
I feel bad for skinny people
sit-ups in pe without mats are HELL
My gym teacher made me sit on the gym floor for 1h30 minutes my tailbone is bruised af
As a quite skinny person, laying on my side hurts so bad! I am a ballet dancer so I can't agree with the last one though
and when someone skinny walks around in giant boots everyone's like ha this person is wearing anchor so he doesn't fly away during wind
Omg this just reminded me of a memory of this bitch in third grade. She said she was 30 pounds and she pretended to be blown away by the wind on a windy day. Total pick-me girl. She was rude too. She was like oOh iM sO sKiNnY aNd lIgHt
I’m skinny too
You dance better  than me
Her dance moves are better then Mine   I look a wet spaghetti noodle in the wind
Ok so like hear me out, im skinny af and i found a cool trick with the pants. You cam tie sweatpants strings into a slip knot(noose) so they fit perfect
“I cAnT dAnCe”.          😂😂😂😂😂
I would rather be skinny than get fat just by thinking about food
I can confirm I’m so skinny literally I’m 11 and am skinnier then a 5 year old
The last one doesn't sound or look like skinny people problem
And imagine being chubby YOU IS ON FIRE IN SUMMER
Jayus: you get very cold  Me: shows this to my gf  Also me: HA I TOLD YOU IT ISNT BC I NEVER WEAR A JACKET
My cousin is skinny as f and she is on colorgaurd
For baseball my belt could wrap around me twice 😂
As a skinny person.- I can say this is true.it hurts to sit and lay on my ribs like that ASWELL IM ALWAYS COLD LIKE.and my mother loves putting the ac to 72 so I can freeze like- WHAT
Same exact same for me
Same 😩😩
You can dance I can’t though
🤣
You are so brave to show off ur dance moves I would take it down after I uploaded it 2 mins after 😂
I have these problems to, im not overly skinny, but im not the weight i should be either.
I have a very skinny friend and she goes to the royal ballet school
Ha that’s nothing I am 85 pounds and skinny
Made me realise that I am skinny af, that's alright though because I don't care
I’m to skinny
Yo the same
Ikr that’s what my friend say to me when we’re changing for gym she she’s my ribs pop out and she’s like girl you need to eat 7 Big Macs
That explains why I can’t dance, am cold all the time, and when I lay on my stomach it hurts my chest so and when I sit up
True
Yup my aunt was like eat more your too skinny
Those are some good dance moves you got there🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think your moves are pretty groovy 😎😎
Omg same -!
I'm 13 and my whole life I've heard comments like "do you eat" but idc anymore bc whatever I eat and how much I eat doesn't matter ill always be a skinny legend
BRUUHH ,,,, IM SKINY TOO AND EVERY ONE LIKE EVERYYY ONE SAY : GO EAT SOMETHING WHY U DONT EAT ..  BRUH IN ONE TIME I FIND OUT THAT I LOSES 1 HOLY K IN 5 DAYS  UGH WHYYYY 😒😀 thnx for reading  ♡
I think all of this is true, especially the comments I get them all the time. It's honestly annoying asf ngl..
I don't think not being able to dance has to do with being skinny
I cant dance ethier
Love your dance 😂😂😂
It was worse going to a school with only fat people
Very repatable
Everyone told me I eat like a bird which really hurt me I'd usually just laugh off the pain tho.
The dancing tho 🤣
You look cute while Dancing though 😚😌
my grandpa always calls me skinny and i’m starting to get insecure
I have the opposite problem
As a malnourished skinny one I can confirm I am 13 and only about 60-50 lbs
My weight is like skinny fat skinny
You can’t dance cause you white
I think the worst thing someone told me as a child is: ''If you don't eat, Nobody wil ever think you're pretty'' The most fucking up thing I have ever heard (I was 8)
yep very relatable
I can relate
Ye go jayus go jayus wowoo yeeee 🥳
This is me :(
Omfg this is so true like rn I'm freezing mfao and yes the sitting hurts like bad
I am obese and it’s the opposite except what society says
I can confirm that you can dance a heck of a lot better than I can lol
As a mildly chunky person, I can confirm I am barely ever cold✅
All these problems are relatable ps I'm skinnnnnyy
I am also skinny- and in the national show choir in America
Umm the dancing is not about being skinny you just cant dance
I can't dance got me 😂
I don’t understand no offense to my fam but my dad and my mom are fat and I’m skinny and my siblings are to so um??? And especially if u are skinny skinny and ur a kid and they tell you to go eat a burger ITS RUDE U RUIN THE KIDS LIFE  YOU MAKE THEM THINK THEY ARE FAT OR THEY ARE SKINNY
Me:Being skinny and actually dancing like that.
Facts
am a literal STICK
I’m fat
As a twig I can confirm,
I am skinny too ever thing you said it true
As a skinny person I can confirm, and when I do sit ups my spine gets bruises
I weigh more then u, and I’m 10
These aren't real problems
well I might be skinny but ima dancer all the other ones I can relate to tho, the most common thing I heard was "You need to drink some milk!" lol idk
I'm skinny but also a professional dancer lol
Trade you in fluffy
I, a fat person with absolutely no a*s, can relate to the sitting problem. I literally sit on the bones whil while the rest of my body looks like a marshmallow.
Everything except for the last one is true
You are cute
I’m skinny asf to
I am skinny my entire life but i could literally go out with barely anything on when it's winter and wouldn't get cold
I know how you feel
Literally me I eat a lot but never gain any weight
I'm skinny and I can dance, ur such a liar, 🙄
And when the say “your skinny as a stick!”  And “It’s too windy now! Don’t fly away!”     😢
This is so true 😅😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭
I'm not skinny and I wish I was
Getting told "oh my god we get it, you have an eating disorder" when you talk to anyone about eating. Im also very pale and short so i look like a little kid when im in high school. Shit like that has gone on my whole life
The dance fact is cap im skinny as hell and can dance like no tomorrow
Pls Bella you dance better than me
I'm not skinny at all like dude!
My relatives always brought up my weight in random situations. They told me I need meat and I need to eat more. I am trying to, you don't need to tell me 100 times.
Skinnnnnnnnnnnnny check I am skinny to #fastmataboulisoum
I get this so much
Upload a dance cover
Oh god, I can’t dance either way-  Also I never got comments like “Eat a Burger!” Because I have a gut like that one guy in We Don’t Talk About Bruno
Im that weight and im 9yrs old
I weigh more than you and you're way older than me 😟
I agree
Haha same I’m called 2 years old I’m 14
i think not dancing is a human thing :/
I also hate being skinny
All is me I just have a thick build
you can literally see my ribs through my shirt😥
Love the dance moves bella  🤣🤣
I am sooooooooooooooo skinny
It took me an entire year to PICK UP MY WEIGHT and I’m still skinny but I gained weight, I use to have weird nicknames
All is true except I am a dancer
The holes in the belt are so relatable
All true. I am too skinny. My shirt is too short and loose but my shorts are massive and don't fit. I have to get clothes from the kids section XD
yes me i am skinny and a eat a lot also me in my family i would me cold while the rest are hot
The last one i cant relate too
i relate to all of these on such a high level
im kinda chubby but i can relate to this
To all the skinny people united here today, I just want to say you're all fking amazing and at least we can eat guilt free.
I love your mobes
I'm also so skinny 😸
The dancing looks like a you problem more than a skinny person problem  lol I can relate
Bone doesn’t cushion anything.. hitting the hip bone is THE WORST
True tho
I agree with everything on this list. I’m 15 and only 105 pounds. About a year ago I was pushing 90 pounds.
It’s always “go eat a burger” until u actually eat a burger and now you eat to much or your to fat. I also wish I was as skinny as you because I weigh 112.8 lbs at quite a young age. And I’ve been keeping it a secret from my parents UNTIL they had to take my weight. The amount of embarrassment I felt. I also wish I was as skinny as my brother who weighs 62 pounds. I should weigh 72 pounds. I weigh 40 more pounds than I should. Which is sad. So be luck that your skinny because I’d rather be skinny shamed than told I need to stop eating 😊
Then belt problem is very relatable. I bought a chanel belt (mind you it was the smallest one) AND IT WAS TOO BIG. I tried to poke holes in it, BUT I WASNT ABLE TO 😭
My grandpa says "wow she finally eats it's a miracle" "the wind's ganna blow you away since it's kinda windy"
I can relate to that because when I was a kid I was like skinny and one of my brother's friend used to call me skeleton all the time like it was my name.
Rest is true, but the dance part is a you prob CD
Same 💀
I'll give you 70lbs if you want let's go
Damn, that dancing skill is amazing, I have no skill whatsoever lol
I’m 13 I’m double your weight I could fold you
My exact problems…
THIS IS ME😭😭😭😭
Same here this happens to me all the time but I can gain wieghtband I dont know why
Underweight gang where u at
The worst part about it is when people come up to you and see if they can fit their index finger and their thumb around your wrist. Happens a lot and frustrates me
Skinny like me girl problems..
Last one is false
I'm FAT
I can confirm this
Bruh those are beautiful dances
"I can't dance" yet continues to do the best dances.🤣👏🏾
It’s so hard to get a cute outfit because I’ve got long legs but a small waist. My mom always has to sew my pants to make them smaller, and I love baggy clothes so my arms don’t look like noodles.
I’m so skinny this is true
😎😉
My parents told me I would blow away and now they say lm fat sooo lm very insecure
Actually you dance pretty well
SAMME YOU SAY EXACTLY HOW I FEEL
As a fat person I can’t dance lol
You can dance you dance like me that's my maniac dance😆💯
Same tho
Ime 34🙄 i no how it feels
Basically!true
Wow why can I relate to this😂I had been 64 pounds for like 4 years
I have that problem because I have eating disorder so NEVER EVER ASK MY TO DANCE
WHAT IS THE FUCKIN WORLD ARE THOSE DANCE MOVES!?!?!!!
My dad is skinny and my mom is not too skinny so the only reason that I have pillows on our chairs it MY DAD!!!
Yep….. I know this!!!!
Dancing like a french fry in the background🤣. but it really doesn't matter how you look no matter what the inside  counts ❤️
I would love you have a friend that’s dance like that!!!!🤣
Last month, a girl looked at me up and down (we were in the locker room) and she said to me “You look pregnant”. That day was the first day that I developed an ED. DON’T SAY SHIT ABOUT SOMEON’S BODY. YOU DON’T KNOW HOW THEY’LL REACT.
Dancing is just her problem
Are you a boy or girl
You are so beautiful just the way you are
my cusin said i have have a eating problem because im so skinny its not nice :(
Faxs
Jayus: “I can’t dance (because I’m skinny).” Vaganova Ballet Dancers: 👀🤫
Dude… I’m 48 pounds…
Yup same
I can confirm this. I’m always called a twig or a stick and people saying I don’t eat.
The last one just white pepole
I use to be fat, got super skinny, and now my friends like to say im big boned instead of saying “ur fat”
As i am a skinny person I AGREE
She is so true
Same I’m skinny as a stick that’s been peeling
She’s sitting on the bathroom sink…
EAT MORE
You forgot onee your watch doesn't fit poke holes in it( in the strap thingy)
Agreed
Those dance moves just errupted the time line and all of my desire
Your a better dancer than me
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dancing part is on you really...
You said u can't dance? That's why I'd don't dance... I can't
I love this girl, she isn’t afraid to be herself. 🙃
my parents called me a toothpick.
Literally me
That is so true a am skinny af
Relatable
For my fellow Americans (and anyone else who uses pounds), she seems to be using kilograms not pounds on the scale so no, she’s not 62 pounds while being a full grown adult
“People say I can’t dance” 💃🏼🕺💃🏼🕺💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼🕺 That made my day😊
Wearing a two peace swimsuit is the worst… if you get it you know what I am talking about
No, I think it's just the moves
This is true
Everything is correct as me ( as skinny person) oof
yes it is disrespectful to even say to a child, how would i know? im that person
All true!!! I hate being skinny but every one here that is skinny has to agree they would hate being fat.
Sorry Charli but we’ve got someone better
I could teach you a couple of moves😁
Nice dance moves
Relatable
This is me I don’t need to say anymore.
You are so cute. Ugh. I like your dance moves. Groove it the way that works for you.
OMG so true people at school call me a stick figure cuz I'm skinny
man shes telling the story of my life
True
Relatable….I’m a 60 pound 13yo 😂
Me to it sucks
These are all so true for me as well. I've gotten used to my sister telling me I have no a$s and sh!t like that but I hate when people notice me in a bikini and ask if I'm OK and if I'm being abused because I have visible bruises all over me because I enjoy the floor...
As a skinny person, when people make comments it hurts. Especially when you are young and grow up with them.
You also cant swim for long couse you get cold in saconds
Still being like this, and young, people make comments about how I look and say stuff like, “omg you’re so small, you’re like a twig!” Or, “are you sick?”  I’m so sick of it.
Get it I guess
Oh my God, I would so dance with you if I saw that at a high-school dance
Shut up
Omg yessss
same
5 is the worst
I felt that
I'm the same way and it hurts🥲 and people also tell me to eat or that if I loose anymore weight I will disappear
The dancing is YES.
“skeeny people problems”
When i was in the 1st grade I didn't like  any of the school food and a TEACHER said "how are you still alive you should be dead right now" Just bc i was skinny and I didn't like the food. LIKE WHAT!
I honestly love your dancing
I know these pain and everyone gets mad at me for being cold when they literally have body insulation
The skinny can confirm🙂
FR! Skinny people can’t dance! My think friend will bust a move and look fine but when I do the same dance it just don’t look right 😭😭😭
BRO ALL I DO IS EAT I STAY FRICKING SKINNY
Yes I am a skinny person, and I can confirm this because I am currently in bed, sick because I got really cold. My friend is not sick and she wasn't wearing a jacket, just a short sleeve shirt and shorts. I WAS WEAR 2 JACKETS, A LONG SLEEVE SHIRT, AND SWEAT PANTS, IN THE SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS!!!
The dancing at the end tho
I am in 9th grade and just reached 100lb
All this is so true to me
Is the inability to dance a skinny person problem??
Honestly the comments are the worst it just makes me feel so insecure that’s why I wear hoodies so people don’t make as much comments about me :/
Pretty much the complete OPPOSITE of my life. People say stop eating so much. Exercise. Take diets. So I'm very insucure about my body and what people think of me. I've basically stoped eating all together to be skinny like they want me to be.
I'm soooo skinny I deal with all these problems
I'm SO skinny ASF I can put my RING finger around my arm
Still jealous. A lot of my family was alive during the great depression, so my genetics decided to hang onto every molecule of fat that exists I'm my body, so basically I have no metabolism.
I’m not skinny so it’s the opposite of all of these
I can’t dance eather
omg so relatable i’m only in inch on a side view
So reliable for me
Can confirm
Your dancing is amazing
People tell me to starve myself lol
Correct
This is why i need my heater up all the way-
Well you dance better than I do lol
I shit the dancing made my day 😆👍
The dancing...I can't with her
yep
Haha, yes this is soo true
Did she say she was 66 pounds?!?!? Or do i need glasses?!???
I wish I could dance like that 😔
As a skinny person All of this are facts
As a skinny person, I can confirm. But what is the solution to this??
that is true👍 every time when it’s too windy I get scared that I’m going to get blown away ☠️
Nice moves
i wanna be skinny :(
Ok so im skinny and the worst thing is that when ever i eat and im like allready full atleast someone in family has to say"You didnt eat anything u gotta eat" LIKE DO U WANT ME TO EXPLODE OR WHAT
Just do what i do. Fat Tuesday. Break diet every Tuesday.
Honestly that’s some pretty good dancing
Worst exercise ever: sit ups
I gained a lot of weight due to medication a few years ago, but when I was in high school I was 5’2” and only 96lbs. The comments I got about my weight made me hate myself. “Are you anoerxic?” Like, stop
The last one is the most accurate
Same            Also, bracelets, rings, and neck problems;-;
True
Legit me and my friends, though im the only one with the tailbone and belt problem
I’ve been super skinny my whole life as well- but some how I can dance o.o it might just be because I’ve been doing shitty dance classes my whole life
Me me so so me my parents would be like you’re so skinny people would be like does she even eat anything and then I would just be standing here like excuse me what did I do I can’t get full so yeah that with me
YES FINALLY LEGIT THOUGH I AM A KID AND HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS and people say like EaT SoMeThInG but I lose more weight than gaining it EVERYTIME the only think I don’t have for it is the dancing
Omggg the part about the bones on your butt IS SO TRUE. I thought it was a normal problem everyone went through but I guess not lmao. And your spine too
Same tho
i have a high metabolism that i joke about.i say to my friends i  can eat but stay skinny but if we drink poison i'm the first one going. And thebeing cold is not a joke i  worked at chickfila i was the youngest and skinniest person on staff at 15 i was always outside taking orders. Heck when the freeze happened last year. i was outside for an hour and a hlaf when we were supposed to be switching after 30.
Number 5 is the worst one. I was in ROTC in high-school and was doing more pull-ups than my friend. She got mad and then started saying, oh well of course you can do them so easily, you don't even weigh anything so it's not even a workout for you.  I am literally in my freaking 20's now and workout, but just the other day my friends mom started bringing up my weight and said that when she first saw me a few years ago, "it was like, you were skinny. Like skinnnyyyy." And she said that a couple more times in a voice I can only describe as disgusted or sickened. Like bitch, I am not even that fucking skinny thank you very much.  As someone who has dealt with this my entire life, take my advice people. Don't comment on anyone's weight. Ever. Or how much they eat or anything. Skinny people and fat people are the same. If you say omg you're so bonyyyy to a skinny person, it is literally just as insulting as saying omg you have fat rolls to a big person. Ok rant over
as a fat child, i wish i was you.
Naw these happend on a regular basis
I agree, I’m skinny
As a skinny person I relate to all but the cold one cuz I lived in an extremely cold country for many years which toughest you up
I'm skinny and get cold playing rugby
Same. I’ve been so skinny all my life
As a skinny person this is the most true thing I’ve ever heard except you forgot one, the “we should bubble wrap you so you don’t get hurt”
I agree! I’m skinny too and literally this happens to me all the time
True I fill you relateable
Omg I love your dance moves and. Dtrust me ok what your talking about I am also very skinny and experience all of these problems!
Same lol😝
All these things she named, happens to me rn
I was super skinny up until like last year when I actually started like eating properly now I’m at a healthy weight and I’m glad that you got to a healthy weight because that’s really important
I was skinny as hell but puberty changed that thank god our else I would have been called living skeleton  by everyone my whole life that's the nickname that everyone gave me.
All you said in this vid3o is tru3.
When she started to dance   Me: plz just… stop   Her: *keeps dancing*
I hate it when people say skinny people cant be bullied 😕 I remember when I was in first grade trying to eat all of the food I had at home because everyone made fun of me
Are you a boy or a girl
i can RELATE
Well my mom body shames me for being fat so yeah
I know it's so annoying 😥
As a fat person I can’t relate
As a fellow skinny person all this is true and my teacher asked why I all ways stand up in class 😂
When I was in second grade I was only 40 pounds I’m tall and skinny it sucks
LITERALLY
I feel you bro
"I can't dance"  I beg to differ
"I CANT DANCE" Starts dancing amazingly*
So true
Same here BESTEY
Ok they dancing one is your problem not your skinny body
Girl I can't dance either
Great dance moves🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😄😄😄😄😄😄
What are you talking about those dance moves are nice
I can relate to all
Idk what you talking about, you dance amazing
I felt this, I've been chilling at 80-89lbs for like 3 years now
Sadly i have thick thighs and all of my tiny friends use me as a chair  ;^,
Just wear a shoelace
SAME
Haha, you always find a way to make me laugh.
As a skinny person as well I can relate to the clothes not fitting and having to make new holes on watches and I can’t dance either
I eat alot and am still skinny and have all of those problems
Go to dance class
girl i’m from the US and when u shouted the scale with the 66 on it i was like THAT IS NOT HEALTHY and then i realized u probably we’re not in the US so i googled the translation😅
I can definitely agree with everything, except for the dance one, because I am a competition dancer, and have won multiple times 😂
So is it good to be… bigger?
I’m pretty skinny and I do relate to the dance thing 😂
I feel u man same same
Have the same problem
Omg I have the same issues
I can confirm and I have lots of bruises on my belly and people ask if I get abused even tho I sont
I am the same!
Our world is f*ed up people go to fat people and say eat less and to skinny people eat more there is no way u can get it right
Yea thats what peole say to me
Everyone: listening to skinny peps problems Me: Is she couching on the sink like if I do that I'm probably falling of along with the sink but like srsly bro how in the f ing world did she?!?!?! You know what I'm not gonna ask
The fact that my mom called me a weirdo wiggler because of the last part where she was dancing And by a friend of a skinny friend I can confirm that it's true
I'm skinny, but not skin and bones skinny. 6'5, can't dance for shit, and finding pants that fit me is **hell** I had no idea it was like this for all skinny people
I want to be skinny
Wtf stop calling me out!! But also same
exactly. once at school this girl asked if i was anorexic like no??? 😭😭
That is so relatable 😂🤣😆
As a fat person, damn didn’t know u also had a lot of problems
I don’t even know how many times some one has told me to “get meat on my bones”. Like wtf lol
I’ll eat 2 pounds of food and lose a pound. I hate being skinny
same.... when I was a kid I ate so much food, lots of varieties, and It was pretty healthy, but I stayed thin. Everything jayus mentioned is just 100% relatable
Me and my mom both have a condition where we can only gain weight with tine and slower than average so if I eat 10× normal and don't exercise for a year I'd gain the same amount of weight a if I ate half as much as normal and exersiced from dusk till dawn and I have the same problems u have and that explains it
One of Mt friends got bullied and got called a stick for being skinny she's only 11
THEY MAKE MY DAY EVERY TIME 😂😂😂
for me it's "you eat too much"
The last ones a skill issue but I can't dance either so I also have no skill lol.
OMG I GET BULLIED CAUSE IM TO SKINNY
And when you eat it’s “Lose some weight”
I. Am. Fat. Like I'm talking 30lbs over weight, but I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS, like bruhhhh I swear. I wish I was skinny. I constantly get told to do some cardio, or go in a diet smh. Like how do you expect me to do cardio with asthma, an inhaler that doesn't work for you, and no motivation.
I can relate, I'm a skinny person. Society is the bad part 🙃
My least favorite thing about being skinny is a group of people will shout "boney twig" when I walk by them at school.
Omg I hear this too often…       “I’m so afraid your gonna break apart in the wind” like it was true tho cos like I would be walking in the wind and I would be pushed around everywhere and my siblings would be like “ girl your gonna fly away in the wind”
Me too
you r very funny and if I have a bad you make me laugh so hard thank you
Holy shit- this made me realize how skinny I am, I have all of these problems
This explains everything omg lol
I can confirm this im 71 pounds
Fabulous dance moves jay ✨🤩⭐️
RELATABLE 🤣
I know right
🤪🤪
Once I was eating a donut and and my aunt said “you are going to be a *big* girl when you grow up” like bro, that’s a pretty messed up thing to say to a 13/14 year old (it was only last year but I can’t remember if it was before or after my birthday)
Imagine being skinny couldn’t be me 😢
I'm skinny. I approve this message
Bruh I have jacked up many belts poking holes . Also being a healthy weight then makes me feel insecure so my mental state is always shit . Like I’m never happy with how I look . . . . I didn’t mean to get that deep
Omg finally someone understands 😫
I refuse to take back all my comments to my skinny sister bout how she needs to hold onto me so she doesn't blow way. (There was no wind)
I can relate to this so much, I don't even know why a kid MY age would be 60 lb. I, I, I just... IDK OK? IM LITERALLY A KID. IDK WHY MY BROTHER WHO IS 9 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME, HALF MY SIZE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why are people liking her, did ppl just immediately forget the controversies she made
Society be like to skinny people “EAT A BURGER” and then to fat people “ LOOSE WEIGHT” like make up ur MMMIINNDDD
only me or was that dance *GOLD*
Same😅
Im skinnyer than her it  hurts?
i feel all this and i dont eat anything and my parents would tell me about peope who didnt eat and died so i cryed alot in my childhood
My mom once told me I’m a tree……I understand what you mean I’m skinny and tall BUT I EAT SO MUCH
Nailed it  👏👏👏 ᕦ( ᐛ )ᕡ
The part were they said she cant dance  My mind:but she was just dancing??
i used to be underweight, but i finally gained the healthy amount of weight this year
I'm 92ibs FtM, I've had my mom try to say when I was younger cause I didn't know who I was at the time and was insecure (Much better now) "Most girls would want your body" or "Girls would starve to have your body." Okay, and? And pants are hell, I gotta shop in kids' clothes because nothing fits and when people say "Omg you wear size 2-3?! How lucky" It drives me nuts because I normally reply "Wow, you don't need to walk into the teen's section because of your average female height AND weight?! How lucky?!" Shuts them up quickly. Then people get jealous when I eat a lot (Well I'm sorry for genetics and metabolism). So this video speaks a lot. On the bright side of being skinny, during Halloween, or really if you enjoy being creepy. Even of average or shorter height. Your appearance in large trench coats makes you look scary. Or during holidays of Halloween (My bones are exposed, yes I am healthy skinny.) I can pop my shoulder blades out and it freaks people out. Which made me laugh and still to this day. So it has lovely perks of the creepy fans. Another cool thing is skinny people can survive the heat better, which makes us wonderful lizards basking in the sun. We also are champions at hide n seek, and flexibility (If you're naturally or gymnastics) is on our side, we can also monkey our way in trees cause longer elongated limbs.
As a certified skinny person Yes this is 100% accurate
True
Fun fact: According to the society, calling people fat is body shaming but calling people skinny is just "FUN".        saying this from my own experience :)
are we just NOT ganna talk abt how f-ing funny the dancing was!?
Omg my friend wolf_theweirdow1919 is the same and she eats like a man is is still skinny
I’m super skinny and Get this I am 10 and I hate how Strangers come up to me and say you need to eat something and I can dance
Wdym that’s beautiful dancing at least better than me
Why is that so accurate
My favourite is when you have a snack and your friend takes it from you and says. “Oh my god have you seen how many colonies are in these?”  LIKE BITCH DOES IT LOOK LIKE I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. SORRY YOU GOT INSECURITIES BOUT YOUR BODY BIT DO NOT PROJECT THEM ONTO ME. IMMA EAT WHATEVER TF I WANT OK BOO? And still not have you worry about gaining weight😘
This is accurate asf, except for the dancing part you just can’t dance😂
I can't dance either 😢
That is me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
The comment and dance is my life
I was literally a Pumpkin when i was a toddler
I agree I’m very skinny too I can see those problems
So true
"I can't dance" *Shows of awesome freestyle dance moves!* Me: *welp you can still dance better than me!*
As a chunky person we have the complete opposite problem! Also shoe strings.
Why is this so true-
Very much confirmed and I am so skinny people call me a stick😒
I am very skinny too and this is all relatable
Yes!!! It took me getting pregnant to gain a healthy weight
As a bigger person, I used to hate skinny people and them saying all the bad things about it, simply over the fact I wanted to be them and they wanted to be someone else, I now know that everyone goes through struggles and goes through hardships regardless of their differences, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
As a skinny person I can confirm ;-;
Finally some one understands
The truth
I wish I was relatable
It's ok girl I can't dance either 😂.
Don’t forget not able to do sit-ups
WHY THE *peewoop* IS YOUR BELT SO STIFF.         Edit: no hate just looked weird lol
When I was a kid, they called me a little fat, even tho I was and am super skinny......... I can relate
You can dance
As a skinny person a agree that you can’t dance cuz you know that skinny people dance even if they do the steps like smooth as butter but still look bad cuz of  bones poking out.     Fuck
i am skinny and i can dance
Omgosh i am so fricken skinny and my family hates it and is like gane some wait. Bro
Lol, my gf is kind of really skinny and  Every time that I hug her it just feel like I’m hugging a plank or something 😂
Wtf kind of dances are those but I still like it and I'm like you
You dance better than me that’s for sure…
I greed with you
Same
The society part omfg that is so true cause I’m skinny and adults would just tell me that I need to eat more and I try but I just can’t gain weight like what do you want me to do?!
I canot relate to these problems
I'm over weight but I get so cold when other ppl think it's warm😭
I hope she has her own house because of that dance
Omg this is so relateable
I just realized that if your fat you to chubby but if your skinny you need to eat. Like either way you going to be made fun of. So what I’d like to say is just yourself and make you happy.
Lol girl,the dance issue is not a weight related thing. Kkkkk
Looks like you can dance to me, bro. I see no issues
i was skinny until the pandemic i ate all quarantine snacks and i became fatter than chungus could ever be
Lucky being skinny tho
Yeah that's true
yes..Yes..YES...*YES* *Y E S*    (EXCEPT THE DANCE PART)
RELATIBAL
Well I have called someone chicken bone before but before I called them chicken bone I called myself chicken wing and we were both laughing really hard. So I don’t think it offended them. But idk.
Omg it's so true
So true
I cant dance either but I have anxiety so its different and I dont dance at home because if my mom see's me I'm going to be embarrassed and she's gonna be like "what the hell🤣" so that last one is relatable
You cant dance not because you're skinny but because you just can't dance
I’m just very picky with my food
Im 12 my arm is 1 inch i weigh 59 and i understand the cold thing
No offense , but uhm.. I'm almost as skinny as her I can dance tho......
Me neither, but I'm a monkey, I don't need to dance to get attention
Will just say the dancing problem is a skinny factor that way I don’t have to feel bad about not being able dance either
Same here that's what people tell me I have one insecurity they say "you know how many people want that body exactly"
True I'm skinny
I don’t have the pants problem because I have a decent size butt that holds up my life pants but I have a extremely skinny stomach
This made me cry cause this has been my entire life and it was scary as a child and it made me insecure the fact my brother said I’ll die from starvation scared me and it still does plus I can’t dance at all
Society really is like “why are you fat” and when your skinny they be like “omg ur skinny how dare u
LOL YOU CANT DANCE-
This is actually true, this is my problem I have for being skinny
I’m skinny too and this is true- 100% true. But ur dance moves are on point ngl.
my dear- oh my lord the worst is when the pants don’t have *belt loops*😀🖕🏻
OMG SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS!!!!!  i am tall and skiny and i can never find pants that fit! And i actually had to drill holes in my moms old belt🤣
this is pure facts
Me: feeling confident Some person: omg my hand fits around your wrist! Me: thinking that there is something wrong with me
“I can’t dance”  Continues to dance better then me
Don’t forget when you have to do sit-ups—
I think you where bore that way
Relatable
And i cant float in water 😭
Ur facing us just mwah chefs kees
Bro its so hard especially when people were body shaming me as a KID
You are my favourite of all utube!!!! Amazing facts, funny anecdotes and plenty of energy! I'm fat and my belt doesn't fit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Better at dancing than me at least, and I’m kinda the opposite of skinny.
Jayus: I can't dance Proceeds to show off the best moves ever
As a skinny person, I tend to get so fucking hot- and cold but mostly hot
I’m heavy as fuck but so skinny people think the scales is broken
Confirming from a skinny one
Yup! Also part of the reason I am so skinny is because my metabolism is so fast it just goes away, which also makes me hungry a lot more.
I LOVE YOUR DANCING
5 & 6 never happened to me
Nobody:  Her: "I can't Dane!" Also her:*amazing dance moves*
We’re not talking about those ✨beautiful ✨ dance moves?
THE BELT THINGGG OMNGGGG I CONFIRM EVERYTHING!!!!
What are you talking about!!! You are pretty and perfect also those are the best dance moves I have ever seen
I feel u
I confirm
Now I'm happy that I'm chubby
IM 69 POUNDA AND IM 11

Pov: dancing at home
OMG THIS IS LITERALLY HALLARIOUS I’m also really skinny but this is sooooo true
Society sucks I can confirmed
YES FRIGGIN RELATABLE, I NEVER DON'T GET A COMMENT FROM MY FRIENDS SAYING I'M A SKINNY LEGEND, IT'S FRIGGIN ANNOYING
I’ve been both and they both have their pros & cons. I was skinny most of my life then got larger due to a medical thing.
I’m rlly chubby and was jealous of my skinny friend and later found out that it is as bad as being chubby
As someone who doesn’t look skinny at all and has a stomach but skin is THIN AF HOLY COW- you can see my fricking ribs if my fast
I have the opposite problem but I respect that fat people aren’t the only ones with problems
Same girl 😂😭😂😭
I’m the same way everybody says those things to me, me and u have grown up the same
So relatable
Can we trade pls
Thank you for a good dancer LOL 😊
They always say  Eat a burger Me:I don’t like burgers  Ew ur weird Me:I’m just picky   *picks up a stick*look it’s you a twig Me:that’s a stick you idiot  (Cloths are either way too small or way to big)
My sister has this problems
I'm 11 years old and I weigh 68 lbs but all my friends weigh over 100 and I have all those problems and more, this makes me feel better that someone else is like this, I can eat as much as I want and nothing will happen.
as a 13 year old who weigjts like 85-90 pounds i can comfirm
Yes amen! I know how this was!
Me

“Aww are you pants falling do they not just were a belt oh your belt doesn’t fit you gotta poke new holes in it” made me laugh so hard I fell of my bed
Sooooo realtable🥲
The fact she was standing on her sink-
I'm like a healthy weight but have a stomach and can relate to unable to dance and pain for my ass bones when i sit.
We relate
At least you can dance better then me
As a skinny person I feel your pain. And I still feel it because I can't gain weight
The damn thing is just a problem that people I have
CAN WE TRADE
ok
you can dance you just don't think other people think you can. Dance over you want
And the belt and pants is so realatable
I’m skinny and short and this is so true
I love the dance 😍😀
I fat so I don’t know how it feels
Are you gay
Lol very relatable
The dancing thing I can fix, just look up the kazotsky kick from tf2 and follow the steps!
I am bursting out laughing from the dancing
Hahahaha the dance tho🤣🤣🤣
I'm skinny as heck and I can dance beautifully
Lol that is me
I am so skinny
The pants one is so true. I'm wearing sweatpants that I tightened ALOT
Yes
Omg thus is traumatizing to her like yes I eat leave me alone
I’m also to skinny
I'm skinny to and in sport class we were weighing ourself and I was average height and was the thinnest then my people said you should eat more and next week he bought me bloody protein shakes
SAME
The insulation part is so true lol
I have to lean on one of my thighs to actually sit It  h u r t s

That is True. I follow all of those but I am 110 lbs and look like a never eat despite being a glutton and eat everything I see (that is food) but I can stand the cold
Finally!! I’m not aloneeee!!! 😭🕺
Honey, no one can dance.
That’s the same for me I get really cold so easily and fast
Same and also when u get changed for pe or something everyone is like u are so SKINNY!
I used to be skinny until like 6 people will be like do ur mom feed but know that I gained a lot of weight they like ur mom feed u to much😃👍🏾
That getting cold really fast thing is not true I have a cuz and he is the skinnist person I have met in person and in the winter when there's snow flipping everywhere he stays out there for like 3 or 4 hour's
This is me..

Amazing dance
I can dance as good as you we’re on the same page girl I feel you
Mines the opposite I’m plus size ☹️

As a stick i can confirm everything in this video..
Are you a girl or boy 🤨🤨
4 and 5 definitely hurt ngl
I Know so annoying
Well are you flexible
Hahaha you are such a good dance
When I lay down like that my chest hurts and I can't dance even if I'm fut
Jayus: so you get cold really fucking fast 😂😂 elite That's freaking hilarious my daughter is actually a skinny and kind of skinny and dances good
Jayus: to get cold quick as fuck😂😂
That was the best dance I’ve ever seen in my life
This is so true I never have jeans that fit also its called a high metabolism
I agree.
I love it when she started dancing 💃😂
Same
I have the belt problem too and I'm not super skinny. I just have a big butt and my waist is not the same size as my butt in jeans so a size 6 may fit my waist, but not my butt. A size 10 may fit my butt, but not my waist. It's a constant struggle
It’s so true   My legs are long for my height and I’m skinny and so when I dance I look like an awkward giraffe
As a slim person I can confirm the cold part  I wear 3 sweaters daily
My friend skinny like that anyone like you put up your arm and we can see you have your whole boat you barely even eat your lunch and half the time you don’t even eat eat something she barely even eat one piece of meat a day
Yes get it Jayus!!
I have the same problem
Bro you dance better then me, then again I’m tall and skinny as well so we both don’t have rhythm
I’m fat as hell and I can’t dance bruh
THIS IS SO FREAKING RELATABLE!!!!!
All those things happen to me and I’m 10 😐
It’s so true I am crazy skinny and everyone is always jealous but they done understand the side affects
Same for me
Same
You can dance better then me
Are you a girl or a boy
Ya the fact that you can't dance is just you
When i was in like middle school or like elementary school all my friends would tell me eat candy or you will blow away in the wind then now that I gained weight I need to eat a salad like what the F..k
I think you dance just fine 🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻
Lol dance
FR
As a skinny person, you are not skinny. You are perfect and I am jealous of your healthy weight.
I get called too skinny all the time
Yeah!
I’m really skinny and the boys at my school thought tells menI was to skinny was going to hurt my feeling when all of them were skinnier than me or we big built I’m not body shaming but it made no sense to me
If I lay down like that I cant breathe cuz of my boobs, pants don't fit me, chairs are fine though, I get cold so fast that people don't ever wanna touch me, I can't dance for dear life, and im fat 😭😭😭
Same
Gurrrlll same
my go to move is the disco
SO accurate I'm skinny just LIKE that and yes  my pants fall down so I need a belt but the belt dose not fit and I get COLD SO fast so yea I have been skinny like that my hole life
My friends literally call me a stick :/
I had my friends parents thinking I was on drugs because of my collar bones were always about an inch out, so I wasn’t allowed at a lot of my friends houses because of it and it was very sad.
Yes
It’s good I’m super skinny to and there all true

SAME
Sre you a girl or a boy?
As a skinny person I can agree
Bro I am skinny too you can see my bones
I am 75 pounds and I am almost 13😓
Except the dancing part, I can relate💃🏽
Dance moves  10/10
Bro im actually very skinny and yes i actually do eat alot and i still stay skinny like wtf... 😅
This is so relatable plus add the fact that your own parents say "eat more" "your to skinny"
Can confirm: being a skinny kid and sitting on those stupid plastic chairs in school for hours on end hurts!!!!!
True that
I know right it is like you can’t gain Weight
My dad always says why you always so cold but it’s bec I am skinny AF.. I hate it
Can't Dance Who??
I can confirm
Dancing isnt just skinny people problems I cant dance
U dance better that me lol
Not me dancing like her on a normal basis
I’m so skinny, and every single thing is true!
As I skinny person I disagree I am a dancer and I don’t think I’m that bad lol
Relatable 😭
Im.. Getting skinny. And thats good for me. I needed to loose a bit of weight. Lol
You have great dance moves!!!😍
This is so facts…litteraly every single person at school, go eat food and you won’t have this problem… Also me litteraly consumes like 4 burritos every lunch…and it doesn’t change
Since I am a skinny person with no belts I have to be miserable and go through it.
I suck at dancing, and I think I'm fat as ever
As a very skinny person I can confirm it can be the middle of summer and I have like 5 blankets
Charli d'amelio over here she can dance
It is true but I could and did eat 2 🍔🍔 and still be skinny😂😂🤣🤣
I am sometimes jealous of my friends cuz they are all skiny
Just cause you’re skinny doesn’t mean you get I don’t think that’s a skinny pop up
I hate when that happens to meh 😂😢
I’ve always got criticized for this cause I’m skinny and short so it’s like yeah
I mean you dance better than me
DANCE YAAAAAAAA
i can feel my bones just laying down or when a pet walks on me, i get asked by my FRIENDS “do u eat” or they call me anorexic, and i always doubt our scale is accurate when i weigh myself bc of how skinny i am 🧍
Bro I love ur dancing u and my aunt would make a very cool friend duos
Same
The dance part is probably because u are tall
I can confirm
If you don't like being skinny then can we try to swap I'm fat and I want to be skinny 😢😭
YES FINALLY SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS ME, im skinny since the say I was borned my weight it's like 1,43 kg and I'm turning 14 this yearr
Are u a boy or a girl im confused😅
as a really skinny person who has a high metabolism and always gets told that i should and being called anorexic even tho i eat like 5 meals a day and is 10 kg underweight i can approve of this but she forgot to mention you bloat really fast but 2 seconds later your back to be being a twig
Ya that is me 🙁 I can't get fat I can eat all as I want and don't get fat and I hate it so much
„your belt doesn’t fit? Poke holes in them”  Me 5 weeks ago before seeing this video:   ….
I am always getting shamed by my family and this is so relatable and I'm 10 I'm also always trying to get clothes to fit but you surpassed me with all of your dance moves
Same
Who else was SO vibing with her at the end?
You can't dance I can't dance let's be  pals
Are you a Girl or not
I’ve never felt more noticed in my whole entire life and as a kid who got those comments like you’re a twig or oh I don’t wanna hug you too hard you might break and the most annoying is YOUR SO SKINNY omg😱 No DUHH
I know how u feal
Why is this so realitable
I can’t dance either it’s fine 😂
As a skinny person who live in a warm and tropical country. I have to wear a jacket or a hoodie or long sleeves shirt just to look not very skinny. It feels comfy and cool tho, but sometime it gets preety hot
This is me
The dance part isn't true to me but everything else I can relate to as a small and very thin person
Welp that is the skinny life for us skinny people, very accurate video by the way XD
Most of these problems I still experience and I'm severely overweight
We’ll get that fuck out of you’re mind😊
I cant dance and i am skinny so yes i comfirm
I can confirm sitting makes your ass bones hurt
As I skinny person I can say you do get cold very very fast.
I got all these problems 😤😂
Facts
U wanna tell me that ur 19+ years old and u have 30kg? How??
I have the belt problem so I use a piece of ribbon. Still ineffective
I used to be more on the chubby side and suddenly when I turned 18 I started losing weight rapidly and since then I've been very skinny, no matter how much I eat.
Facts
Oh lord when I have severe OCD and for about 14 years my compulsion was self-starvation…. The COLD. I was always FREEZING. Also yes about every position hurting my bones.
I have a friend that's very skinny and she can say yes
As a skinny person I relate

Those were the best dance moves I have seen in my whole life
I have problems where I have insecurities about belly fat, but everyone says I'm skinny and muscular. Then I'm like whattttt????!!!!!!?????!!!!!
I’m tiny and skinny all of this is true and almost worse
Ur not alone!
That is the exact same thing that happened me
You weigh 40 lbs more than my 6 month old daughter
Idk what you mean I thought that dancing was pretty good. But then again I have no experience with dance and never learned dance so technically I can't say much, but I can say I did like your moves!
SAMD
Your dancing is fine in my book🤣 better than mine
Dude! I thought it was only me!! Just the other day my mom talked about how thin I am!!! These problems suck!
Lol I’m so skinny and people call me tooth pick. Literally ruined my childhood
I've was born skinny and I relate to all of these things😭
I’m still a minor and still get comments like “ Go eat a burger”. One of my family members also called me skinny and when I started being emotional ab it they staid being skinny was “good”.
I agree and she is not lying like no shit
This is why I started working out

Stop swearing
I remember once when I was younger, I had to go to a dentist appointment. They were taking me to the room, and wanted to weigh me. (idk why, it was weird.) After they weighed me they said: You’re very skinny, you should eat more. It really hurt my feelings because ever since i was really young I’ve had a problem with gaining weight. Thankfully I’m starting to gain more😅
I can dance and I'm skinny because I do over 9 hrs of dance each week
I think I’m skinny now lol
Jayus: *dance*  Me​:that​ me​ dance​ing..
When my little brother became old enough and tall enough to ride the six flags big rides my mom wouldn’t let him because she said he might slip out the belt because of how skinny he is
Facts, just facts
U made me sad I am skinny too🤣🤣
I can agree I have the same thing it hard for my to find clothes hat fit and look mice like I'm so fin that you can see my ribs and spine
Ok this is so realistic! Like all the kids in my 5th grade class are like ,"DO U EVEN EAT UR STUPID" so half the time I'm just sitting on the side of recess with me 3 other besties
I'm skinny and I eat like every 1 minute an I don't get chubby my mom says I have a infinet stomach
My mom is 45 kilos, and she's still not satisfied
im sure dancing isn't ur thing girl
Ppl at school say you HAVE to eat and eat more than it looks I’m always eating
Relatable
So fucking relatable 😢😓
Wow I just realized I'm skinny everything about this is me 🤣
As a more heavyset person, I always thought skinny people had it easier because they couldn't be called fat or overweight. This video informed me but even now, I'd prefer to be more lightweight then what I am now.
IKR
FRE
Bro I’ve got thick thighs and big hips and I can’t dance
Dance better than me homie 💛
“I CANT DANCE “ 🤣🤣
I have problems 😢
Are you lesbian?
"skinny people can't" I've been dancing since I was 5

Even me I'm skinny and I can relate to that!
Me being very skinny as a 9 year old YouTuber* I hope I don't get those comments
When I went to mexico when I was like 8 or 9 people kept saying that o don’t eat a lot and I now eat soo much yet I don’t gain a SINGLE POUND LIKE WTF
This shit is so true. I’m VERY skinny like my arms are like sticks and so are my legs
Everyone says that to me

Girl I get bullied and get called a insulting twig dude I understand.
Girl I’m 12 and really skinny and I weigh 93.5
I’m skinny and I never get cold
Number 5 I swear man I nearly cry every time someone says that to me like dude I am eating Im sorry I’m not like the others
Are you  girl or bou
So accurate
Personally im a kid and im very skinny, growing up i hear messed up sht from ppl lyk "omg ur so skinny" and they just call me shtty names from how skinny i am
Me not even eating at all today and it's 2:35pm: 😶
I'm skinny🥲
THE DANCEING THING IS JUST YOU
This just made my day
Relatable-
My problem is the opposite but I do have a small waist
Can relate to almost every problem
Your life just started. You won't be that way forever! You will age better.
I share your level of funky moves respect
The dances were pretty good ngl
I thought the comments were funny when people said them to me
Lol I dance the same
This has got to be the most relateable thing I have ever seen
That's meee
I am fat and I wan to be skinny but I can't
This is too relatable but I still can’t get to a normal weight
You can kill it with dancing
You can’t dance because you’re probably just a bad dancer not to lie but I love u don’t take that as a hate comment
Im very skinny I eat a lot I just can't gain weight but I love the cold and I don't get cold easily
My mom poked holes in my belt when I was 5 💀
People say " are you allergic to food" 😭
My only favorite thing a person has said said about me being skinny was somebody calling me Addie long legs
This hurts because It relates
That dance was painful to watch and I have the same problem lol
People when they see skinny people: Omg, you are so skinny. You should eat more, are you sick.  Also the society: Most models are skinny, the "perfect/beautiful" girl is skinny.
I relate to all of these
Thx for saying it. Im a fat boy i got the same problems
You definitely dance better than me and I am not skinny lol
why do we have to suffer like this? i feel like im overweight cuz i have excess belly fat, but my relatives keep telling me that im skinny, i wonder what theyd say to yall :(
I’m skinny as a twig too
Yes
I was also severely underweight as a kid and can relate to all of these but the constantly being cold and family members rude comments hit different
Y u dance like dat??
Those are good dance moves for a drunk person 😂   PS. Not a hate comment
i get bruises on my spine from sitting
I can't english
I skinny can't do that shit eather
Just now noticing how tall u are
That’s why ur lesbian
I can relate and I'm a kid
*My dad used to say,* _“You really should consider getting some meat one ‘em bones.”_
I can stick my leg behind my head I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing
I can relate
Energy hips hurt easy While dancing
Same
I tried the bruse thing it hurt
True
FELT THIS TO HARD
How tall is she?
Lucky I’m a fat @$$
You also tend to sink more when you're swimming.
Gurl sames
Looks like dancing to me
I can confirm I am skinny tall and the same weight as my 5 year old cousin
I just wear belts that are like braided so the whole belt is just holes, that’s awesome
I feel you but I dont
I know about society I get called a stick a lot most people think it’s good to be skinny but it’s really not people at church even would say I was picky and would collapse if I tried to run
i feel this, i’ve been called anorexic and told by complete strangers to gain weight. it’s upsetting, and when i’ve tried to gain weight people have told me to enjoy being skinny. it’s difficult, and i’m glad i’m not the only one
Understand this
I think you're very cute how you are
I’m skinny I’m literally skinnier than you I try to eat but nothing happens I ate many burgers many fruited and many foods literally nothing changed
I love how she is so honest I love it
Yea true me to.
Yep, basically, I’ve had three watches so far but I always end up having to poke holes like 1 1/2 inches away from the tightest option. I have literally not muscle, my arms are literally just bones with skin, and when I’m cuddling with my bf, he always says that I’m poking him with my bones. He complains that he’s fat, he’s not, just a little chubby which is good, but it’s better that way because of warm cuddles and hugs, and I like squishing his baby face
Onlyjayus:l can't dance  The rest of the world :me ever 😶
Put a Ludacris song on that dance and boom u got ur next big internet meme
This is so true
I still got that problem
That last dance at the end lmao
No cuz the wind one is so true😭
Me being skinny AF I know what all of those feel like
My parents always say to put meat on my bones :/
yeah all that is kinda true
As a skinny person, this is EXTREMELY accurate. As a kid people would say shit like “Omg!! Your so skinny do you eat like ANYTHING????” “Look at how small your hands are! I can fit my hand around your wrist!!” And it made me really insecure about my body as a kid 😭  Edit: when I said this would make me insecure, I mean *really* insecure, to the point where I would legit overfeed myself. That’s f*cked up to say to a kid man 😭
pretty sick moves
It’s the same 4 me
Yuh im 14 and underweight and this is my life and I'm always insecure abt it thank god i know now that others are too
I have the same problem
I feel you... I feel you...
i’m def not skinny but i’m also not fat and my ass still hurts when i sit, it’s not even that i’m flat it just hurts. same with clothes my hips are pretty wide as i’m curvy and my thighs are huge so jeans are always so tight in those areas but fit perfectly fine around the waist. and same with society my literal mother calls me fat sometimes when i’m at a healthy weight.
Good dancing I can't dance too but a good thing to do is  just try to practice c walking I'll help you learn how to dance
THE ASS BONES ARE MEEEE
I’m a dancer have been for 12 years and I’m super skinny but I can dance so well haha
It’s ok I can’t dance either 😂
I'm 76.2 is that normal for an 11 year old
Bro why is dis true doe? My bro and me and even my mom had these troubles until pregnancy. She was super super skinny
I Have Related To All Of These ESPECIALLY THE SOCIETY ONE
Dancing like cockroach sprayed with     Pest repellant
Love you 💖
Sammmmmmmmmme I was the same hieght and weight for 6 years straight 8-14 now im at a pretty good weight 116 pounds at 15 i think its good idk
I have the exact opposite problem. My grandad was starving in the depression and was still bullied for being chubby. XD I understand this but in the other direction where I have had people telling me to excersize and eat less and “it’s ok it’s probs just a phase you’ll be a good size when you grow up” :T I’m thirteen
.......... The fact she can't dance yet she dances better then me is just sad
I can so relate to that
I want to be skinny but not super skinny
The dancing skills are just ✨amazing✨
Same with all of these
Oh sweetie you really can't dance...but neither can Elaine from Seinfeld she was awful
I think your aDorable... love the skinny skin skin your in...I think your smart funny beautiful and sweet 😍🎂🎉🎈🎉🎈....I think your great just the way you are...
I've been told I have the perfect body that has the perfect curves meanwhile my entire life I wanted to be skinny and now I am kind of thankful for that I was blessed with
I too am very skin but can lift more then all my cousins so every time the day eat something I can bring that up
"Oh my Goood, Hahaha your wrists are soo small"
I don't think that last one is due to weight lol
This is so true because im too skinny
How is this so accurate? Bruh.
"Do you even eat?" No brenda i photosynthesize. Fck you
I think you can dance on personal level
My same problems
Oh my god the sitting one has been so annoying for like almost my while life
As a skinny person I can confirm that all these are true  My family calls me things like twig, pencil and because of my skin they would most of the time call me paper because apparently I look pale. My mom would make rude comments about my appearance because I'm really skinny.  I was once in a fight (not a fist fight)with a couple of little kids and most of the insults were about how skinny I look.  Sitting isn't much of a problem for me, laying down is a struggle sometimes, I do get cold VERY easily, I've actually had to cut holes in my belt AT SCHOOL because my mom didnt have scissors. I cant dance AT ALL  Not including how much people tease me at school because I'm short (not in a mean way tho)
Try loosing 84 pounds. Basically the same thing but you get to experience it for the very first time in superspeed.
Omg!! This is so relatable. One of my PE teachers actually asked me if my parents feed me. 😂
IK RIGHT IM SUPER TALL AND SKINNY 🤦‍♀️😀😭
Lol! It is so hilarious how people always like wow do you eat? Then I’m just sitting here like I eat like an elephant so…
Literally me
I only kept working out because I enjoyed that people stopped telling me so often that I was skinny and tiny. I hated feeling lesser. Now I still feel small, but my triceps looks greekly godly
Also, have fun trying to explain to doctors that no you do not have an eating disorder, you just can't gain weight! I've been put through 3 different dietitians and had to go to see psychiatrist as a child because no matter what I ate I was really close to being drastically underweight (and still am)! And if you have ever dreamed of noticable muscles, you can throw those dreams right out of the window! Like sure, you can gain muscles but are they going to be noticeable? Most likely not!
my mom genuinely believed I had an eating disorder when I was growing up just because I was skinny, she wouldn’t let me go the bathroom after eating because she said I would vomit out my food, which wasn’t true, I just digest food pretty quickly. It kinda hurts when your parents blame you for something you never did especially if they don’t help you. They never were actually worried abt me being unhealthy, they just kept getting mad abt it
Ik right I get so cold easily and I can’t eat so much and nothing happens and I’m also short to for my age and I can never find clothes that fist me at all bc I’m to small and skinny and also I can’t find shoes that fit me either since I got small feet
I am very skinny and I am a kid and my family dose that to me
Jayus,”I cant dance.” Also Jayus, *dances off with the VRChat dance moves* Also Jayus behind the cameras, *does the spooky month dance*
Coming from a skinny person this is very true!!!!!! ( ppl think I starve myself…. I don’t I just have very skinny genes )
Why so relatable
But still i would rather be like this but not fat do you now how many humans would tell me "oh your so fat why dont you do a diet" I was 13 years old but still they have to tell me but i am not saying that you skiney humans are happy everone have thier own sad and bad moments
Yes everything
What
I have those problems too I feel your pain I'm sorry
I was told by my one of my bosses that I needed to eat more, that I was too skinny. I felt so insecure about that. I am 19 almost 20 and finally weigh 120 pounds, and am 4 foot 11. Most of my childhood was spent on ADHD medications that restricted weight gain (at 17 and a senior in high school I only weighed 95 pounds, and 99 pounds on a good day, now that I'm finally off the meds I've put on a little bit of weight but it's a struggle to maintain that weight no matter how much I eat. I was a premature baby, 3 months and 4 days early, I'd had weight issues my whole life, and now that I'm at a weight that my doctor says is healthy, I'm happy, but continously get told I need to eat more. As a kid I was told to eat more but I was almost always eating, I used to layer my clothes so it looked like I was at a healthy weight. Now, I don't do that unless it's to keep warm.
Gurl I feel you
Sure, like the rest of us; you've got your own problems but think for just a moment and be extra thankful that you're not even a little overweight, let alone by a lot!
being skinny didn't help your vocabulary either.
Lol hang in there, as 5'11 I was like this until I stopped growing around 21/22... I blew up once the nutrients weren't going towards growth anymore 😒😪 went from being a chestless late bloomer to an F cup practically overnight lol... now I really want a reduction.
Ahhh yesssss the society comments   RELATABLE    People give me money like to buy food, I just realized that is so sad, i don't get sad because i take the money
Being told "your too skinny" as a kid was really really fucking bad
Same we can be the scrony dude
you CAN dance 🖒
I'm skinny. I'm 93 lbs. I'm only 5 ft and I wear a size 12 in kids pants. I love my weight and yes I can dance.
People walk around and pick me up randomly because I’m short And skinny
You cant dance sure   Busts a move
Better than being built like a fucking truck for your whole life
Killer moves
“Lol you look like a stick” “branch” I ALWAYS got told those :/
As a person who weighs 300lbs in pure fat I can relate to all of these except being cold
Omg yes people always told me to go eat a cake like no j wont
Yeah and I was told "carry some stone in you pockets to weight you down or else wind will blow you away"
Like I’m so skinny and I eat so many burgers
This is so relatable I am 85 pounds and 14 years old. I wish I was joking 🙃
Yes you can
Also putting ur arms on a desk while not wearing a sweater or something
I think ur wrong ob the last one💃🕺😂😂
Same
Your dancing is *amazing* 👏🏻
Lucky
What do you mean? Those moves SLAPPED
You're not the only skinny person
I am skinny so I can relate.
I’m 6’4” but very very skinny and these are all super horrible especially since I’m also tall and the chairs in school not only hurt my butt but are tiny.
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND Also can confirm a lot of dancing is just making your body jiggle in a pleasing way. This is why skinny people "can't dance". Doctors accused my mom of under feeding me but anyone who knew us knew I ate A LOT. Like the whole neighborhood fed me and I was still skinny.
A new healthy weight ??? Seriously???
I know he feeling
I'm 12, and I'm 80 pounds
These are so true especially the society one my family always has to be toxic
“I can’t Dance” them what were You just doing
Skinny people problems are so true
I thought I was imagining the body insulation part cause it would literally be like 80° outside but I would be wearing thick ass jackets cause I would be COLD.
My friend is soooo thin... her whole life. people say the most fucked up things to her. she has becomes irate as of lately about it and I dont blame her... quit body shaming people. super thin people actually don't always like it.
Yes you can dance !
The clothing problem though!! I can't wear any pants without them getting all scrunched in at the waist cuz I pull my belt so tight!
Yea but I’m pretty fat not gonna lie but I feel like everyone is like OMG DO YOU EVER NOT EAT?!?!? And I’m like  Yea do you?
When you're tall and skinny with a extremely high metabolism.  No pants will fit you and eating about 4k of calories is like eating cotton candy.  One heavy storm is good enough to yeet you of the planet 🤣🤣
Only true:/ 👍
My”friends” would always comment on how little I eat. SORRY IM NOT A FAT ASS LIKE YOU. I genuinely do not eat that much, my stomach is very small OK
I can carry you I’m 98 lbs and I’m 12
I’m sorry, SHOES IN THE HOUSE??? No. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
These problems happen to me and my brother one time I kept getting called Skeleton
I eat alot and everyone knows and I can relate to all but the cold and people saying I don't eat
On brother dude
I'm also really skinny and everyday I get made fun of, I get called a twig , people say they have more strength in there pinky then my entire body , and people don't believe that I actually eat a lot, I have a very fast metabolism and an iron deficiency, but I still get made fun of everyday ,even by my own family
I have all these problems everytime I eat the food doesn't stay and fat I can't get and body fat
Same I hate the cold bro it’s the worst part
Hey d rather be skinny
Also doing situps hurts unless you cushion your back
I swear i've heard that shit with "do you even eat?" And other my whole life and it doesn't stop like BRO I WAS FUCKING 9 OR SMT AND I WAS SUPER INSECURE ABOUT MYSELF
Glad this isn’t only me
I actually like inability to dance
Maybe jayus the dancing thing is.. Is… maybe not due to ur weight
Your a better dancer then me a least 😢🥲😢
Not matter ud you are skinni you are still f.... Hot 🤘🇩🇰
Try being short and skinny. See what insults you get. They suck!
I gave up on belts. I now wear suspenders instead, partly because my girlfriend thinks they're hot 😅
Sadly it's so true
*I understand your pain*
I can confirm these. Even when I broke a freakin school record for strength people still called me a stick.
You thought this was a good video but it’s actually a really stupid video
Finally someone who gets it
I can relate to this. In band, our director was measuring us for the uniforms. A couple days later, he got the pants in. The SMALLEST size almost didnt fit me. On top of that, i have short ppl problems as well. He offered to get me a dress that was literally as tall as I am. I just took the pants. My mom is good at stuff like this so she altered them for me
Maam you dance better than me wth 😭
Dancing seems good to me
I think too fucken FAT cause my left leg hurts and I know why it's cause I lean to my left too much for too long
Sooo..true.The problem is kind of like a daily thing for me😶😶
As a kid who is tall nd skinnny totally relate to this video. I mean cm'on i hv been hearing this all the time tht why don't u eat etc etc nd all tht shit. I eat all day long but my weight is still the same.
Shmateo, les twins and Michael Jackson are/were all skinny💀
😂😂😂 the dance part
You're an AWESOME dancer😂😂😂🤣
If you skinny you ain't getting fat
Try being 6ft 7in tall and skinny af
I love Bella's old long hair remember the times🥲
I was skinny for a while as a kid and people always made comments about it... My idiot child self listened to them and now I have a *belly* and I don't like it, I look like I'm, like, 2-3 months pregnant even though I'm a fucking virgin and almost 20💀 I shouldn't have listened to those people🥲
Same
Yeah 🥲
You can get a clothe belt so you can make it as tight or as loose as you want
Also SAMEEE
She has moves
"I can't dance" Neither can I
Not being able to dance is not just a skinny person problem. I'm overweight and I can't dance either. And I have a cousin that is average weight that can't dance.
The thing is if you're skinny people would tell you to eat more but if you're a bit fat people tell you to exercise and workout and get skinny.
It’s okay you’re not the only one who can’t dance
Who said u can’t dance?
I’m so skinny too and I just hate the clothes thing ._.
If you are skinny: bro why are you so skinny like go eat something . If you are slightly more chubby than a super model: why are you so fat maybe you should skip lunch or go workout . Society has found a way to make everyone feel bad about themselves
It is so creepy that you are literally  the same person as my older brother you and him would make the perfect couple
Can't relate
You better than me at dancing
U played basketball?
Thank you so much for making this it’s relieving to see someone actually talk about this. A lot of us actually struggle really bad with body image and find it very hard to gain weight.
Do why do you curse I’m only for teen
Good I’m fat
Omg same I tall and thin some people forget that just because I tall doesn't mean I'm big and they say stuff like eat or work out but working out justice me smaller and no matter how much I ate it would take a month to actually get one bones😑😑
When I was 9 I weighed like 60 pounds. I'M A GUY. I can relate to this.
Nice dance moves, their not bad
spicy 👹 dance💃 moves ✨
I can relate
I kinda feel offended because I'm fat af
As a fellow skinny person I agree with all the things u said I have done the belt thing  as well lmao
U dance like my Tia Chickie
All my teachers used to call me skinny mini😭👍
The go eat a burger comment is the opposite for me being slightly more than slightly overweight most of my life it was stop being the burger 😂
Don’t worry I’m 12 and 120 lbs still can’t dance
I feel that I ate more than my family combined and weighed nothing 8 pounds of chips 0.1 pound put on me
I'm legit 40 pounds and I didn't grow well so I'm also very small.
I can relate
All if that stuff is true for me to accept the cold one bc sometimes I'm hot in -10 weather (farenheight) but other times im really cold and the dancing ones true (atleast for me) for me I'm so skinny people can see some if my rib bones and laying in a soft bed can make me sore for days
So relatable people do not understand and I don’t know why I can’t dance either I thought it was just me
I wish i was skinnier and maybe i wouldn't of had this opinion if my mom didn't constantly tell me I'm fat my whole childhood
Ya I’m super skinny but I have a 6 pack so
Omg sameeeee everyone tells me that I eat too less and I eat way too much in real life tho, and everything else is relatable
Literally I can't do situps on a hard floor because THE BONES IN MY BACK  AND TAILBONE STICK OUT AND IT HURTS A LOT
FINALLY SOMEONE SAID ITT
I've looked high and low Far and wide And I still can't find The fucking lie
Ok most of these effect the fat too
As a skinny person. This is true
I literally almost flew away in wind once when i was 8💀
I’ve always wanted to be skinny and now watching this, *i dont think i want to be skinny anymore.*
Lol I just realize your a girl in this video you look like a guy with long hair
Lol I have the same problems
I eat as much as Nicado Avacado and I’m still bones
Jayus absolutely spittin facts bro.
Well I like your dance moves!
Dont worry, I'm fat and understand the belt problem.
The dancing is just perfect.
And never getting to wear Bracelets or Rings because your hands are to small  😔 I dream of the day i try on a bracelet that fits
all those are the same for me im 14 and people tell me to eat more so i do then i “eat too much” and now i have to deal with starving and eating this shouldnt be smt a 14 yr old girl should be thinking about it hurts
The dancing thing is a personal one I meet tons of skinny people at germanys dancing competition 2018 (damn that’s so long ago already?)
I'd hit that
I can confirm this
All of this is relatable to me 😭😭😭😭
I feel you. Im skinny and I’m always hella cold
Yes, gym clas push-ups destroy me
Same with me and I'm still really skinny
"No you can't be full you need to eat it all. You're too skinny you have to gain weight or we'll worry." "Stop eating, you'll get fat."  Can they make up their mind.
O no the wind caught em and there she blows
I can relate qwq
Can't relate. My family's nickname for me growing up was chunky monkey. Then I got anorexic and they'd constantly make comments on how sickly I look. Pick a side ffs
I love your danceing
I'm fat but it still FUCKING hurts to sit down fast
Same
Oh my God I can relate to all of those problems
Am I going to be the only one who is going to say that Jaylus is literally so attractive?
Im skinny and people always say that i need to eat more AND WHEN I TRY TO EAT FRICKING MORE IM STILL NOT GONNA GAIN WEIGHT DUMBASS so i usually say this inside my head "ok whatever gosh why is people always bodyshaming me) and always smile fake smile of course   If i get 10 dollars everytime someone say that i would of have been rich already
I’m pretty sure the dancing part it’s mostly just you
I get it im skinny as heck and shere most of theis
Same I experience this to
I feel this
If I suck in my stomach I can see my ribs and the thingy that connects them! ☺️😊 it’s been like that basically my whole life!
Your a girl
BROO HOW THE I WEIGH MORE THEN YOU AND IM TEN
Whinging about being slim? What's wrong with you?
Are you a girl are a boy?
Hey would you rather be500 pounds
That is meee iam sooo skinny and wen I eat don't do shit
I got a friend who is skinny as hell and she can do cheer gymnastics and dance
me rn being a skinny kid with toxic family 😐👍
I can relate to this so much because this is me… I am 13 but all my life I’ve been called.. anorexic, skeleton, stick, and tons of other rude names😑🙄😔😒😒 and I can never find cloths that fit me, I have the a completely flat chest, I’m 13!😩😒😒😩 and I’m the tiniest in my friend groups, and people think I’m 8 or 9, like actually people think im 8 no cap, like ughhh😒😒😩😩🙄🙄🙄😑😑😑
Lol 😂💀      I don’t mean this meant I’m just laughing at her dancing
We skinny people can dance ^u^ and you got the moves
I’m f-ing skinny and I’m a young teen I can dance amazingly and I do get cold so fast And in elementary school I was called a stick everyday
I have been struggling yo lose weights and fats in the past two years but failed miserably. Meanwhile Yagus:......
True
You weren’t nowhere near as skinny as I was
I’ve always been small n it’s krazy how ppl say watever to skinny ppl but think it’s rude to say shit bout fat ppl wtf it’s da same thing!!
The part that it hurts when you sit it’s just facts
This is true like I have a pair of jeans that don’t fit so I have to tuck the excess belt into my jeans and my god is it annoying
Society one is literally my grandma which is probably unusual for people
No- you can dance.
I can't relate because I am so fucking fay
OK you’re not the only one I can’t dance either
Well im the opposite
I don't think being skinny can affect you being able to dance
I have the same condition as you.😂
That's my life
ESPECIALLY IF YOU SIT ON THE TOILET, THAT SHIT HURTS
ESPECIALLY IF YOU SIT ON THE TOILET, THAT SHIT HURTS
Would you rather be overweight? I'll trade ya
True...😭😭😭
Me who’s still 10 pounds underweight: 😳👏
I feel the pain and I way about 96lbs an I’m like 5’10 and I’m 12
Same wen I was younger but now people mack fun of me for looking fat but only waying 100 ponds
You are still gorgeous though!
I don't think being skinny has anything to do with not being able to dance lol. Because I too can't dance, because we are Whyte lol
I’ve always been tall and skinny
can’t agree more
Cute
i think the can’t dance is just a you problem in terms of weight not saying i can dance but i’m not exactly skinny
I can still wear some of my clothes when I was in kindergarten, and I don't feel too happy about it.
everyone's making fusses about body positivity and shit. but it's almost focused the plus sized peeps so that they can accept themselves, but then some of those plus sized peeps criticize or even say we're blessed for being thin no matter what we eat. dude, like I don't get enough criticism from my plus sized loving family already, and you're adding yourself to my pile of negativities.
Idk bout y’all but those dancing skills were amazing
I'm skinny too
You know personally I think that your dancing wasn't that bad.
I’m skinny and tall as fuck
Same 🤚
I mean that's how I look when I dance. But I think you look better than I do. I'm also pretty skinny so...
Omg finally someone who know the pain!
Lol that’s me
LMAO same AF 😂🤣😂💀
Dude “eat a burger” holy hell yeah no kidding. I got told that once a week my entire life
When you said I can dance Then when you tried to dance  I felt to f*cking bad for you XD
Your either skinny or fat these days.. no one is happy
Yo fact but I'm 38kg so my probs bigger
Bro FACTS
relateable
I’m almost 14 and I weigh 100 ponds and I eat like SHIT. Like idk how I’m not heavy
This is literally me, even my own friends would say I looked like a twig. But once I told them that it wasn’t a complement they understood and stopped.
Isn't it crazy how society will dictate whether you are too fat (even if you are not) and relentlessly crucify you for it but they do the same for people who are slim which just shows that society doesn't know what a 'perfect' size is so if we are ok with our body then just ignore society as it is rubbish (I have had an eating disorder for 32yrs and it didn't matter what size I was, I got hate based on size😢😢) Jayus, I know that you don't need validation from me, but I think that you are awesome the way you are and if you changed, as long as it was because you wanted to change, I would still think that you are awesome 💗💗
Thank you   My dad says that I need some meat on my bones....😒 Like bitch I have eaten so many steaks and burgers that I don’t feel skinny  IM STILL SKINNY DAD AND I DONT CARE
I dont know if being unable to dance is a skinny problem
this is so true but it’s worse that i’m tall because of pants. if i get a pants size that fits my waist the lower part of my leg is showing. if i size up they never fit my waits but my legs are covered THE STRUGGLES
Ok the funniest thing about this is I am a dancer and have been complimented by so many people. I relate to everything except the dancing
one time i was joking about how someone called me fat (i’m skinny like you) and my friends were like “HAHAHA IM SORRY BUT NO YOUR A LITERAL TWIG” like bruh
The bets dance moves 💃
Jayus: I can’t dance   Me: I’m not skinny, but she can dance better than I can
My personal fav that my male coworker says “you must need to run around in the shower to get completely wet.”
It’s hurts to sit down like real bad omg
Does being skinny make you racist though? It's never made me racist, but maybe that's your issue jayus? Really fucking let me down with that one.
As a very skinny girl I can relate to everything
Why this is so relatable 😭😭 Especially 3,4,5 😭😭
I have been "skinny bones Jones" my whole life too. Well that's what my mother used to call me.
As someone who was really skinny in their youth and now bordering overweight, it has given me new perspective on the two sides. Growing up, people kept telling me I'm too skinny or that I should eat more (worse was when they say my parents are being negligent on my food intake which is a shitty thing to say especially because my mom gained a lot of weight after having three kids) and then when I got older and gained weight, all people kept telling me is that I should go on a diet or exercise more.  Imagine meeting people and the first thing they say to you is "you gained a lot of weight since i last saw you, why dont you go on a diet or smth?" AS IF I havent been trying to lose weight for over two years now without resorting to throwing up everything i eat or just not eating all together 🙄
I'm thin as hell and I'm only affected by the 1st one sometimes
That is so fucking true my God.
This is too relatable cuz I'm very skinny 😭
Same
As a skinny person freezing under a blanket watching this the mental issues the comments cause are bad
When I was really little I was very skinny. People would tell my mom that she wasn't feeding me enough, they would ask me If I was starving my self, and I got called skeleton hands. (I just have a fast metabolism, and was a fit child lol)
Ikr
bruh the “go eat”  comment was too accurate i’ve heard it from everyone
i feel so bad when people say “OMG UR A TWIG” and “ If u don’t get more meat on ur bones ur gonna snap if half so much easier” there is not a feeling worse than that
Me problems
I love your dancing
I can relate to this. My mother tries to convince me to eat but I'm very picky when it comes to food.
Never thought to put new holes if a belt didn’t fit big brain move
Better dancer than me
isabella/onlyjayus: I CaNt DaNcE
Cant dance is not just A skinni problem
Same here 20 killo weight
Same here 20 kill weigjt
I know about all of them I'm skinny too
I have all of these and I'm over Wight I'm I skinny 😶🤯🤯🤯
Finally someone understands the sitting problem
Yeah for me it’s really bad, I’m trying to I get healthy at most
Srsly tho I’m skinny as fuck and half the ppl are jealous and half think I starve myself but I’ve been Trina gain weight and I CANT
Man this is soo true
Same I’m so tiny
I hate my life because of that shit
Yea idk why im like skinny and no matter whatever i eat my weight stays the same and im still too thin but like idc at least when im being chased i can go through a narrow wall than they cant fit in so im just happy 😀
As I have Celiacs Disease( a disease where I can’t eat wheat, Gluten, barley , Rye, Everything I eat has to be Gluten-free food or else I will get projectile vomit for 2 days in a row) so I eat very strictly and I’m 40-50 pounds skinnier than my friends which they weigh about 110-120 pounds… Soo yeah I can’t eat all the processed foods a normal person would eat 😎🥴
Perfect for me
I try to eat but I'm not gaining any wight
For #3, it's the complete opposite
Facts 😂
This is my story too
So true all of them 😂
Damn same so this has answered a lot of problems especially number 2
"I can't dance" you already surpassed me in dancing on 10 different levels
I feel ya
I think you are  just a bad dancer
I recognize the term "get some meat on your bones"
I sadly have to agree with you in the skinny one but maybe bc I never really eat like normal people you see for No reason I just find it very and I mean veryyyyyy hard for me to eat anything that isnt sweet and I can barly eat meat the only meat that i can eat is Chicken breast and normal Chicken I cant even eat vegtebals and im allready near 17 and I have to fucking fix my body afsp bc im going to need to find a job to help my family           Somtimes I wonder what the fuck happened that made me unable to like normal people
Is it just me or as a kid, doing something like pushups makes you look terrifying. If I bend my elbow, they just jut out 3 feet to the side
Has anyone else been called the apple-jacks cinnamon stick????
I’m very skinny
I am 65 lb skinny AF I also get cold too easily
Yes
Same
During the dancing segment you should've edited in the Minecraft skeleton noises
I am also very skinny
I’m not sure being skinny is reason you can’t dance… lol no hate love your videos!
Man now I know why every time I do sit ups my bone in my butt hurts alot
I am skinny and short af I always have been so yes all of this is true
Feeel that
I have the exact same problems
YESSSS i can’t sit down for too long or else my butt hurts 😭😭 and i CANNOT lay on my stomach without it hurting
Same tho, my own family told me to get some meat on my bones saying it since I was really young in 15 now they still say it
No-one can dance
Don’t worry bout the dancing Jayus it’s amazing
For 4 years I hardly ever ate It was because of my Medicine it made my Elementary - Middle school life really Miserable kids used too force feed me for fun and like it was bad and I looked super sick like you could see my rib cage
My dad: do you fuckin eat?? Or, when he hugged me on Christmas oh my god your so skinny!!!!
Hi, skinny dancer right here-
All of these are very accurate for me
This- is so true
Aren’t you like 6’2
So, I'm very skinny and I have iron deficiency. I'm a giant ice cube.
Date a black guy and you'll gain weight and be able to dance. Btw, I'm single. 😁
Dude saaaammeee
Can
You cab dance
Bish, I've had jest lost 2 kg, and now I weight 52 kg, but I'm olny 11.😒
It's funny because I've experienced skinny people problems and now I'm experiencing overweight people's problems. More experience I guess. Lol 😆
I've also been skinny asf. Now I'm overweight. Like God, can I just be normal? Argh......I'm working on it though.
Your still amazing
Soo true about the belt
No wonder your skinny you like 6’2
The last one it’s because she’s white
😂😂
The dance thing is just you
Yea.
i always feel mildy bad when i compair my partner to a syphinx cat but i seriously feel like she’ll die if i don’t give her cuddles(cause i can’t knit sweaters). my excuse for staying chubby( cause unless it becomes a bit more unhealthy i don’t give a shit) is that “being fluffy is in my best interest for her”.
OK I’m skinny and I can even dance
So true
bitch tell us how to gain muscles then
It's always " oh ur too f@t" or " oh ur too skinny"... people always be body shaming, and I have personal experience  😔, guys, I've been body shamed my whole life, just ignore those rude as$ b1tches
I had all the same problems.. Then I got old and now I'm 300 pounds diabetic and would really like those problems back! XD
Not saying this to be rude but gets some fucking dance skills also there’s this restaurant it’s called kfc go get every thing on there menu
I think it’s just you on the dance I am just using my mom’s phone hehe
The last one is a u problem *saying as a joke*
"I can't dance" Trust me hun, I'm chubby and I can't dance either.
All of these things are true and I say that because I’m also skinny and I literally have a heating pad on my stomach just because I’m cold I think this is hilarious 😂
Omg her dancing had be dead- 😂
I can say this is 1000% true
YES
Bella :I can't dance  Also bella:dose slik moves
I wish I had skinny people problems
I hate being super skinny. AND SHORT. It used to be a good thing to be skinny but now you are extra criticized for it.
Ion care imma still smash
Same here girl.. I didn't weight 60 pounds until I was 8. I only just now got up to 80 and I'm 14! I get comments alot asking if I'm malnourished or have an eating disorder- It doesn't bother me anymore but it's annoying in the locker room when I'm changing and everyone stares-
I get it I still get bullied
Ok that last one might not be because your skinny 😂💀
I'm obese and actually have all these same problems.
All of this is accurate
Don’t forget about the fingers around the wrist 🤦🏼‍♀️
🤣🤣🤣”Sitting down hurts my ass bones”🤣🤣🤣
Thats how i dance
Wow poor you
The one problem I have is even though I eat, I still don't gain weight. I don't get cold fast though.
Didn't u say some racist shit and not do anything to make it better?
the dancing ur problem
Sorry to say but you really can't dance but guess what I can't dance either
Sorry to say but you really can't dance
The dance one is a you plroblem
You're not the only one I'm skinny and T all the clothes in my size are nearly impossible to find
No you do know how to dance better than me
Doing sit ups man, that shit hurts after a few mins
😭😭😭
Can relate
haha next time do the opposite thing
The dance seems like a flex
See I’ll never have to worry about this stuff 😌
Me: a skinny person Also me: Ahh, I see you're a woman of culture.
I’m 12 and I weigh more than you
I too am very skinny, I'm underweight even though I have a normal diet I do unfortunately relate to all of this except for the last one. If you think you can't dance all you need is some oversized clothing (hoodies and such) trust me you'll look normal while dancing (I'm a b-boy myself so I consider this to be pretty reliable) hopefully it helps other skinny people 😁
No you can dance way better than me!
I'm skinny and 6'3 so pants/belt really resonated with me but I'm pretty sure we can't dance because we are white
Tell me about it🙄
It's so true hahahahah
Im the same im 14 and way 35 kilos=/
I like being chubby
When you showed the dancing part I became happy knowing that in America it’s easy to become obese
Hahahahaha same shit here
Same
Better thane
We can't read opposite America ??
Can comfirm. The cold is the worst
Skinny approved ( MAKE A CHAIN CHAIN ABOUT IT)
Yo I feel this on a personal level
Tbh I’d rather be skinny than how am now with anxiety and just past depression
600 is not healthy
Come to Uganda we link 🔗
It’s the comments for me. Especially from my dad when he would just look at me and out of nowhere, just says “Damn dude your a human twig”. At least that’s how I heard it. Eh, that was about 10 years ago so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Learn and live i guess
This is exactly how I felt my entire life
So trueeeee
Relatable
I can't Dans to
So if you're skinny your entire life or the baby pictures
Y is this so true
I've always been pretty chubby and been made fun of for it, but knowing other people that are a lot smaller than me also go through that? I didn't even think about it until now. I've always wanted to be slimmer but I guess it's no better in some ways. Thank you for sharing this, it was actually super enlightening and I'm going to be rethinking how I see myself and other people now lol.  Have a good day :3
As a skinny person I can agree but you forgot one thing for boys when they are young *all of your friends will keep carrying*
No one can dance as good as you
Dancing isn’t really a skinny person problem it’s just a problem
Cant dance? Hit the boneless
Don't worry I'll save you with my fluffiness
No you can dance.
My parents tell me this everyday it's sad
Yeah you cannot dance 😅
Dance moves to keep people away
So am i
You can dance better than me 🤣🤣🤣
Nah, those dance moves are still better than mine 😆😅 Edit: cant spell...
I don't think the last one is a skinny person problem jayus lol
I'm a damn walking skeleton with skin
“Skinny people can’t dance” Yeonjun: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t hear that
OMG This is me
Accurate af, i'm having 5 meals a day and still weight 56kg for 180cm as a male 😐
I as a ski y perzon. Can say yes to all of this
I have been skinny everyone said eat something and now I'm fat
As a skinny person    *yes*
Girl preach !!!! Tired of everyone saying that exact thing !! Do you eat ?!?!? You need to eat a burger !!! Yes I fucking eat , probably more then you do….. not the point . But either way would you ever go up to an obese person say & say omg you should go on a diet !! Do you ever not eat ???? It’s just wrong on either end. Yes obesity is majorly accepted & now praised basically ……. But being skinny & somewhat healthy is acceptable to be told that you need to eat more ……. Over it
Funny thing I was born leaning on my rib so idented
Did i just see that ur 66 pounds
Litterally all of them are accurate I don't bout the dancing part tho-
I have a friend that’s under weight and very skinny. A girl I absolutely despise literally said that’s good to him when he was talking about it. Like how is that good???  (He also somehow falls all the time and ends up not being hurt. Tbh I think he would be a pretty good stunt man.)
I have all these problems
meh atleast us skinny people dont get as shammed as fat people
Those things still happen to me
I like, physically can’t gain weight. And yeah, people’s comments like “When was the last time you ate LOL” and “I could break you in half.” I feel very weak compared to everyone especially when I’m like annoyed with my best friend and I do something (like grab her wrist, or ‘high five’ her face) and she says: “wow- that hurt so much?” It hurts deep down knowing that I cant do anything to defend myself, and I’m weak and can’t change it. (Also please don’t get mad it’s a thing we do where we just like smack each other in NON INAPPROPRIATE PLACES just to make that clear.)
Fat People can't dance too right no I'm not like morbidly obese fat but like I'm a little bit on the chunkier side
Can we just say that jayus would kill the dance floor 😎😎👌
Ur hilarious ❤️❤️❤️
its relatable
I was constantly told by friends "I wish I was a skinny as u" and I'd have to tell them their healthy while I was underweight
you are like my sis I miss her
Please jay STOP DANCING
I can't dance and I'm fat
I'm average and I can't dance either 😂
You know what I was sad missing my somebody and you just made my day
Legit fucking 14 rn and I'm 140 pounds damn you light
I don’t care that your skinny, I think you are gorgeous.
You still dance better than me lol I’m overweight
Not being able to dance is not a skinny person problem
Im so skinny same
Better dance moves than mine
Haha same I'm 13 and I never gone over 40kg is that bad. To be honest I like to eat 🥞🍙
Being cold sucks but what sucks more is that I can’t blame it on anything I’m not skinny my blood circulates well and my body actually creates a lot of heat But alas I am cold (My s/o says it might be my nerves or something not detecting that I’m warm, and I can see where they are coming from because I used to get really bad fevers as a kid, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
Relatable, they dont think I eat meat 😐
SAME!
My dad used to call me skellitor but the only thing that is not skinny IS MY BEELY WHY NOT ME ARMS (finnaly someone gets what im going through)
For real I’m attracted to your intelligence and I have all those problems and we all know (skinny people) we eat a lot
my height and weight index is 15.7 🥺😢
Still better at dancing than me
Also doing sit ups on a hard floor Banging your elbow Getting hit hurts ten times more
Sick goofy dance moves I like it
I saw a ring on your left finger, so either your camera is turned around... or you're married!!!🤔🤨
Bro those were some moves
Omg yeah I can definitely relate to all of this
Im short and the society part is brutal ngl whn ur short ppl are like”yo why u so short”
I was the skinny kid. I got the go eat something comment my whole life.
Me nietyer
Yo relatable
I’m skinny and I like surfing but if I use a fibreglass board I get bruised on my hip bones from lying on it
Same
That's literally me
No one ca. dance unless they’ve dedicated time to learning how to dance in some form
Jayus: I can’t dance  Proceeds to show the best dance moves ever
As someone and who gets picked on for being skinny this is so accurate
I have been underweight my whole life. This is so true.
I always think I'm fat Mom always says "stop eating so much or you're gonna get fat" That hurt  Now I'm insecure about my weight ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF NOW, MOM
I think the dancing is just lack of skill no offence
im as skinny as you but 2 doesnt happen   but i get told i must be on a diet i eat all the time  also i can dance well
I am skinny but strong
I can relate everything here except for the   go eat something part
It's SO WEIRD to look fatter while actually weighting less
I feel you
You are pretty good at dancing
Go eat a burger get some meat on bones!! I’m scared your going to snap like a twig!
I wish I could be skinny… I’m fat And it sucks even more.
i don't kno what she talking about those was some cool dance moves 😎
I am 187 cm tall and weight 55 kg in 23 years, i feel your pain
Why are these all problems I have to 😭
I'm 12 and I weight 34 kilograms
You dance better than me
Yep I get ya- I’m 11 years old and only weigh 65 pounds. I should weigh 80 to 100 pounds
Wait why do I have like %80 of these problems I'm definitely not skinny
So relatable
I really hate when people judge me with my looks, like bro I'm lucky I have one and I'm living normally
Bru I was thin af just like u and everyone made fun of me cause my bones would show now I've gotten fatter and Ppl go oh look who fat now like Bru
Oh my god honestly. I'm an 8th grader and I have these issues, I've even had a teacher ask me if I eat enough. It's so annoying 💀🙏
THE LAST PART😭😭😭💀💀
This is so accurate 😭
Relates too har d man
Facts bro
U dance better than me
Im only 12 and my friends always say that sort  of stuff to me bc I’m skinny
I feel you
I can very confirm, but I have the “skinny problem” and the “Dont stop growing problem” :)
Bru I'm the littoral opposite of you
Why these so true
Your amazing. Love your videos. But im big so i wish i had that problem. For real.
Pants don't fit, get a belt, belt doesn't fit poke some holes in, and then sit down hear pop and the belt has broken. I would go through like 8 belts a year just trying to make them tight enough to hold up pants with no hips.
Jayus: Twerks  Minecraft skeleton's: are you challenging me bro??  If I insulted you, I am sorry.
Same
What you mean? Those dance moves were fire.
No you can't  Dance 😂😂
Those are like, all of my problems 😂
Ngl you’re by far my favorite person 😂

People call me fish because they think I’m too skinny. And I am short 😢😢😢
You can have perfect posture in everything you do and you’ll still look weird doing it
why the heck do the problems sound like what my parents tell me???
You don’t know how many times I’ve told people about the ass thing, and they all just say I’m being a jerk. IT FUCKING HURTS!
All this stuff is true for me too lolllllll
When u danced it looked like seizure mode loll
I am skinny to

I HATE WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME IF I DOES EAT, I DOES EAT MORE THAN MY WHOLE FAMILY JEEZ.
The dancing part wasn't that bad
You are too cute
Relatable

Omg the DANCING
You dance pretty good ngl
Lol it is me 😂
I’m just saying you dance better than me
Ok maybe I am a bit too skinny then
No one can dance m an
So true tho
Yo this is me
I'm skinny is well nothing fits me
I've got a friend who can't wear his pants without a belt  because he's super skinny and we couldn't find the belt one time and he had to pull up his pants every 10 seconds we were also on skateboard
I can not for the life of me do sit-ups without a cushion
YES. THIS IS SO TRUE.
Well may I r.i.p
I’ve been fat since I was born
Fellow skinny person and I can confirm it yes.
Same ngl
I can relate! But in the defense of others who always wanted to feed me I would take all the food lol 😆 so I ate a lot throughout my early 20s off friends and at my job lol
If i can say it, i dont have a problem whit you
She dance like she on icarly
I’ve never been skinny but never been fat either. So the fact that I get, “you need to eat more. You’re a stick!” Upset me because I’d be bordering overweight if I kept up eating as much as everyone wanted.
This is my son… I love it
Poor fucking you your skinny
Seriously your pretty whish i now you in real life  but im dont think im interesting person
Lol you can dance better then me
Try seeing a fat guy dance lol
Same this is relatable
Looks like dancing to me
Ngl those dance moves were better than I could do
Dude I am 5,11 and 125 pounds so I am a sekeleton
I've never related to anything like this holy...
Im very skinny and very tall, a horrible match as i can never find pants that go past my ankles, sweaters then go past my wrist. Its horrable
This is so true I’ve been skinny my whole life
Same
It's really hard to dance and stay warm but I will survive
The last 🤣🤣
I used to be able to see my ribs
Omg the “eat a burger!” Comment is so rude!!! I’ve dealt with that when I was younger all the time and it was so rude
I am skinny and yes, I agree
Shit want some of my fat I got an excess of it
Ok  when i was in like 2 or 3 grade in my school i used  to sit on benches for like 3h straight and bc of that my a*s bone used to hurt a lot and yes 5 society can be crazy but i am great dancee
Last year I was skinny as fuck so I was having the same problems as you. 2 months ago I finally got in the normal BMI community and I feel so much better
Thaths me
Why is this so trueeeeee!😩
Ikr 😞
My ass goes numb and falls sleep when I sit down too long
Im still skinny as hell and one time not that long ago the wind pushed me over onto the concrete path by school
1 2 and 6 I deal with and I'm fat
Can confirm all of this im 6 foot 130 I feel your pain
Same situation here. I don't mind high temperatures because I'm so thin. A 64 kg male.
Yup, relatable
I get all of these comments from my brother. For so dam long. So I get all of these and yes it does hurt
Did anyone every say to you "If you turn sideways and stick out your tongue you look like a zipper ? I hate that one !!
I like the Honesty!
I’m asf
Ur lucky you are skinny
Fawkin hell it’s so true 🤣🤣
I can't stand this chick. Trash 🙄
"I can't dance-"               *Dances the dance of the Gods*
The pain I get from laying on my stomach is crazy my rib area gets really sore
Why did I laugh so hard when she was dancing like 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good dancing
Did you go to lake Norman charter in North Carolina bc that Jersey your wearing looks like it
Your dancing is better than Elaine from seinfeld tho
AYO YOU'RE A SKELETON TOO???
This is all SO true
I don't know if I'm skinny or not because I'm only 8
I have the same problem's
The dance is like me at prom so awkward
Being a very skinny person as well I can say this is all true.(including the dance part)
The not being able to dance part has nothing to do with you being skinny as a rail
FINALLY SOMEONE TO RELATE TO!!
Me too
AHHHHH TRUEEEEE
Never had the rib problem lmao
Dance moves are pretty fire no cap
U mean giraffe problems
Cute! Hahahah
I know you pain
You'll grow up when you quit cussing God
Well you can dance better than me so that's a good thing
Does that mean I’m skinny because I’m always cold and also I can’t dance either (I don’t think I’m skinny)
I feel you lol
I can confirm as a skinny person
Awe so sad. But you’re tall. Try being a male that’s too short and skinny trying to find jeans
Why is this actually facts
Me too
Ayyy my skinny sis
Me who's skinny and still goes out in 40 degree weather in shorts short sleeve and sandals peasants
Saem
IM VERY SKINNY TOO
Your right I’m skinny too 😕
those dance moves, all i have to say is... SLAY, SLAYY
I’m short and stumpy
i get comments like “OMG UR SO SKINNY I WISH I WAS YOU”
that is literally my life
Also as a liked comment said this is confirmed I can suck up my skin somehow and you can basically touch my ribs
Fuck all those true I’m skinny af and I always get told to eat pizza or shit
Fuck those regular and fat ass people who tell you to eat more. Indeed there are extreme unhealthy skinny people around but if people tell me to eat more i make them humble and tell them to Look at the mirror first  because im athletic and also look athletic but still skinny. Fuck they even make fun of jon jones and wilder for example that they got skinny legs.
This so relatable like I’m 12 tall and skinny as f-k
Preach. 5'8" 130lb for nearly 30 years.
im skinny and people tell me I have noodle arms and when you see my stomach YOU CAN SEE MY RIB BONES and people keep tell me to eat more and I did but at least I got legs and a stomach now and sadly still no arms 😕
Yeah I’m so skinny I remember in elementary school we would play tag and my nick name was Skinny Bones
I am skinny
Problem with being fat. 1. Judged 2. No one likes you 3. No beauty standard 4. Everyone thinks you drink burger grease when I've been eating pure vegetables for dinner for a month. 5. Every time I dance it feels like an earthquake.
Being skinny, i can confirm these all are true 🙂
Those dance moves are 🔥FIRE🔥
I'm trying to get skinny
I am the opposite
This is soo trueeeee And I eat a lot without gaining
u saying u cant dance those are clean dance moves🤣🤣🤣 and i can really relalate to the skinny problems
Literally everything is relatable
SAMMMMEEEE
I feel like u can dance
As an underweight person, this is too true
I relate to all of them...sadly 😂
U can’t dance because your skinny it’s just that us white people can’t dance 😭
Can relate omg
I hate when people say go put some meat on your bones WHEN I EAT MEAT ALL THE FUCKING TIME AND NOTHING CHANGES
Tell me about it🙄
Ooh ooh, you forgot 1 Being able to squish between tiny places on accident and getting stuck.
oh my gosh this is so true, ive been very unhealthily skinny my whole life do stomach issues, so i relate to every one of these
Lol🤣🤣🤣
I was skinny but I think the dance thing is you 😂. Joke. No offense 😀👍
I just have to say that you are absolutely beautiful 😍
Omg that is sooo true I’m like 90 pounds

Everything but 5 was relatable
So true
Yeah those comments hurt alot
For all that's concerned, she CAN dance
My mom calls me skinny and is always like "dOnT sTaRVe YouRsElvE" and it hurts my feelings bc I feel like I'm going to throw up if I eat how much she thinks I should eat
I know the pain and the exact opposite both 🙃🤘
I mean not really anyone can actually dance good
I eat 3 burgers a week 2 pizzas a day and I weight fucking 45
Yeah man, some family members that I don’t like started saying to my parents if they even fed me because I was so skinny. I got so mad at them but couldn’t do anything so for the past several years I’ve just been on the grind to gain muscle because no matter how much I eat, I don’t get fat
Those are the best dance moves I have seen in my life
I'm chicken bones
Nah you can dance 🤧 very good 🙂🙂
I have the same problem too I'm skinny too and short
I can relate to this
Facts bro
facts 100%
I think the dancing is just your skill but good luck
Jeez stop cursing every 5 seconds
Help me how can I get fat even though I eat a lot I search google nothing comes out 🙃
Same with me
Nobody can dance
The last dance tho 😂😂😂
But look at what you do have. Your beautiful, funny, creative, caring, smart. You have a lot going for you
I keep getting said to get some meat on me but every time I get McDonald’s I EAT 3 FUCKING BURGERS, yeah definitely eat more ay I’m so skinny my rib cage kinda shows and ppl thing it’s a six pack💀
The get some meat on your bones is my worst skinny problem people think it’s funny then I try to eat but I still I don’t gain weight and they just say it over and over
Sounds like a you problem
i can relate to tjis and still trying to get healthy weight
Relatable (especially sitting and cold)
I have a big ass o dont feel the pain on my but.
You and me both
MOST RELATABLE VIDEO IBE SEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2021 AND ITS 2022 NOW
4-5 Fucks erm the word in this video don’t ask why I counted
True
I think your videos should just be you dancing from now on… Js
Now I know why I’m always cold
Or when you have to swim for school and you get REALLY cold
That last one isn't a skinny problem
Strait facts
"Go eat a burger!" Meanwhile my mom "Go eat some fresh vegetables"
You can’t dance but you can say the n word
That last part made me laugh out loud ngl
Lol im skinny and ive been called a twig
But then laying down when you have a chest hurts too- lmao
Can’t relate Been a fat my whole life lmao
For me all but 5 are true especially number 3
I know I am so skinny to it’s all true
This is all true
Id rather be skinny
that's just what people dancing
NI-
And im to stupidlly fat and its so bad
Might have skinny problems too
Lmfao 😂😂😂 best dance moves
Laughs in 15lbs overweight
It hurts so much to do the workouts in gym because sometimes we lay on our stomachs and it kills my ribs. Then i can’t so situps, it hurts really bad- And hey, I can’t dance either 👏
For real in the same boat
EXCUSE ME. YOU'RE FUCKING 66 POUNDS. 😳😳😳😳🧐🧐🧐
We're told to eat if we're too skinny, but told to starve ourselves if we're too fat.  Unhealthy beauty standards go brrr.
I’m only 13 and I can fully relate
I don't even use a scale. I literally use which new hole in my belt I use to determine weight gain and loss
I feel u. People say big people got it bad. Then people don't think it's hurtful to say those things to skinny people but everyone thinks it's ok.
I understand you
I can relate to this.im underweight.😢😢
That's so true 😂
This is not my phone but yea I  get a lot of those comments about me being so skinny and I'm only 10
Same for the number 2 and 5
Honestly, negative comments about my height and weight when I was growing up probably contributes to how nonchalant and unmoved I am.
I relate to all of these, especially getting cold fast. I'm freezing right now under 2 blankets 😖🥶
I thought you were a guy
Lucky u im fat
Idk in a overweight I mean not that much in a healthy way
As a very skinny person 80lbs 12y I can relate all of these are true
So true! I’m so skinny
Im only 72 pounds……. Im a stick
I’m worried about getting fat rn, because I’m getting fat lol
I think your dancing is because you’re white 😂
my own family, friends, and everyone i know comment on how skinny i am. it really hurts, and i dont think people realize callig someone skinny can be damaging to them
We love dancing ♥️ also you better at dancing then me
Yea this is true
I have felt this my whole life. I finished growing at 6ft tall and I weighed between 115-125 pounds. Thankfully that all changed. I’m now 34 and I’m 170 pounds and in great shape. I guess things balance out in the end.
This is super relatable
Nah that dance part just I I’m pretty big and I can’t dance
U my new bff we r the same in ever way 🤣🤣
I am skinny too, people are always telling me EAT, I am always complaining about how my pants don't fit!
Your dance made my day
3 and 4, 5 are so fucking annoying
I love the way you dance! Lol. You should hear the things I'm still told, simply because I'm a 4 11' - 110lb black woman. I'm even called "white woman " by my own people. I'm 41. I love my size!
Yess bro finally some one gets it
Cringe
I'm skinny but I don't know why I don't get cold so quickly
Same !
Its never good enough one time your to big and the other time your to small 😑
“gO eAt A bUrGeR” like no-  I can confirm as a skinny person
I can confirm all of this
I never seen someone dancing like a crazy girl
This is so true omg I still remember the pain of my ribs 😭
Your dance moves are better than me 😂
I can co sign to this, except I can dance a lil
As a person who is 5’10 and 112lbs. I can confirm all of these are 100% true. Especially ppl mentioning that shit, sitting down, and my pants falling down.
True
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Once you're fat you get so warm and in the summer you'll be to hot.
I remember back in 8th grade when I was 63 pounds. Now I'm 18 and 146pounds. Gotta love that high metabolism life. Literally became a bottomless pit after quitting that aderal years ago.
We love Jayus’  confidence in the dance! I could never dance like that on canera
I am skinny as fuck and this is all true, but l can dance
I do gymnastics and just looking at be do floor of beam… well you just see my bones😢😢at least I get 9.4s -9.7s that great 👍
Eh I gained like 20 pounds from covid and its fiiinnnnee
I’m skinny and have been skinny my whole life and I’m still in school and I’m sitting on plastic chairs and my butt hurts by the end of the day and I’m always super cold
i relate to all of this..lol
I’m am really skinny but I eat like an elephant ;(
I feel that tho
1 and 2 are so true
“I CANT DANCE” no honey I think that’s a u problem😂 love those dance moves actually tho 💃 😂
This is so me
I remember that I was waking in the hallways one school day, and some kid came over to me and had the NERVE! To  call me ✨Flat✨
You're cute
I feel attacked 🤣
“Go poke holes in it” True true
Shut Rachel remark
as a freaking SKINNY boi, this hits hard, like your friends only insult is you being skinny it’s annoying
Bruh same
I feel you, I’m just as skinny
I feel like people complain on being skinny it is way better to be skinny than fat
Nah im like so skinny that i can see every bone in my body and i disagree with 1-4
I’m sorry, did that say 66 pounds or 664 pounds or am I just dumb and don’t know a thing about scales
i'm a very skinny person, there's one that's very bad walking bare feet hurts your heels
Me being a skinny person :3 I totally relate my mom always says that I will break in half and I'm always freezing cold
As a fat kid all my life women though i was disgusting society told me to loose weight they called me fatso had to buy bigger belts then i hit puberty and swelled bigger then i worked out hardcore fuck bitches get pumps.
What happens if you try to **ck
Me too
Hi all those problems
That third one is so true for me
Have a kid…
Wow😑😑
Thank you for pointing this out, one time I was complaining to my friend about this, and she said “All you get told is eat a hamburger, your life is better being skinny stfu and stop being a pick me.” Yeah, that hurt having someone put down your problems.
I’m thicc af and my booty still be hurtin 💀😭
Oi oi oi Flat is justice Also i can relate
Same I've all ways been skinny
Can't relate XD
Me to
I am also bone boy
Verryy true
Good
I can’t agree more to this I’m short and very skinny
I don’t think that last one was a skinny people problem
The dance problem is just you
I'm also skinny but to me my dad sounds like he doesn't like me being skinny
The Teletubby dance
I am in 7th grade and my weight is 35kg   I am legit skinny
I’m skinny so I feel you
No matter what size or shape you are, people who still comment about you. I was fat when I was younger, still like that though, and I get bad comments like "Don't you pity yourself", "being fat is ugly" and all that. I was even denied a gift when I was younger because I looked to big for my age. That's really painful to experience at a young age. A quote from Holding up the universe says "people say insulting comments and say they're speaking their mind" or something along the line.
Fat ppl problems are worse 😭
i've been skinny for 13 fucking years
I understand all of these. I’m the same but I’m still not a healthy weight
Imagine being fat. Same issues but different.
Nah the last one is just white people problems
Fan we appreciate how BOOTIFUL the dance was 😀
This is me
The sitting down one is too true. Shit hurts after 10 minutes.
Just eat more. Consistent calorie surplus :)
Can't find my wrist watch size, have to poke a hole which is a hassle
I think you have some sweet dance moves 😉
Bro as a skinny person these are true
I’m skinny too
With the belt that's what universal belts are for
My teachers would ask my mom and  dad if they feed me
you look like a guy
Sorry boy
Or you a girl or a bou
Try being a guy and being skinny , guys think your week and girls think your week and say there jealous.  Luckily I can fight and I'm naturally very strong for my size.
All you said is so fucking true
Yeah and im 15 and skinny and 6 '3
Holy crap you really can’t dance
MUSCLE IS BETTER THEN FAT
All of this is accurate. And I never stop eating either, even been eating and someone said “ahh good you must be starving” made me laugh though. The cold is worst this of all
Work it jayus
Ur dance, i somehow like it, lemme jus-   *Proceds to Dance*
idk what they’re talking about they’re a ✨pHeNoMeNaL dAnCeR✨
Yeah sitting down breaks my ass cheek nerves. Although I’m pretty skinny I’m mostly average
I've never been thankful for being fat until i saw this video
How tall you bruh?
I'm the same lol can't gain weight unless it's muscle no matter how much or what I eat. I get cold way to easy and had trouble finding pants that fit due to my long legs vs my small waist. Some of us have the metabolisms of God's but are unfortunately weak to the cold.
Im 15 weigh 70kg
True
YES
All true. Happened to me. Even school teachers would make cruel jokes in front of the class. God damn bastards.
OMG everything but dancing is true
I don't know what were you saying but those dance moves fire tho🔥🔥
I have asthma and when I have asthma attacks (which isn’t often) my neck partially swells up and it’s like my skin gets closer to my bones around my neck area. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if I weren’t so SKINNY that you could literally see almost all my bones around the bottom of my neck when it happens. Which, while I’m not sure.. I think it also makes it hurt more.. I’m not saying this for sympathy or anything just being skinny can suck too.
The downsides of being thin outweigh the downsides of being fat. Also skinny shaming is a bigger problem than fat shaming.
But still Hot as F@©✓ 🔥😜
Yes I have these problems lol I'm 26 and only 120lbs and it's not even healthy.... I eat soo much lol
The belt hack: drill
That's hurtful, I am skinny and she's saying we can't dance. I mean I am like lol but sad
I'm a fat f***women
I can't dance either but I have fun trying to
I feel the Same way
Nice dance moves
I’m the same I’m really skinny😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
All of this is so true because I’m so skinny
I would rather be skinny than be as fat as I am
Being tall and skinny and watching videos of yourself running is probably one of the scariest things I’ve seen.
All facts
I’m also skinny and I’m 11
I think you dance just fine lol
But you look kinda cute 👊🤍
So fat people can dance let’s go!!!!!!!!
This is so true
I’m skinny to
This is relatable, my grandparents tell me to eat more and I eat the most out of my household. Also I ger cold and the cold air just goes up the bottom of thr hoodie making me just as cold if I didn’t have a hoodie on.
I hate to tell you this, but there might be a different reason why you can't dance.
Bruh I’m skinny to lol I know how you feel
Get into it
Yeah must be terrible.  Cry me a river.
U danced amazingly
Yes u can girl! Rawr!
Yea I get clod even if I'm wearing a thick 🧥
I'm skinny but I found out how to dance
OMG SAMEEEE😂😂😂😂😤 this dose make me mad
I am 12 and weigh 64 pounds
I have most of these things. Your not the only one
Same I’m really skinny too Glad to know that some people feel the same
I'm super skinny too and I do dance competition  but I look REALLY stupid doing it, also everyone of those ARE SO FREAKIN TRUE
Same
I can't dance ether
i have had esting issues theough my life and its hard especially in school because you will get teased, also its likd being fat but in my opinion worse. I also get asked “how do you look like that???” and it makes me question, how do i answer this… if you want to be skinny, dont go to great lengths or barely eat… ( i just had different taste buds and i have had to see a pediatrician for s bit because of this ) its a pain, just keep in shape and eat right and you should be good, plus i have to shop in kids - teens for a while… and not just that, IM SHORT SHORT VERY SHORT and its a PAIN to play sports, especially in PE, because 90% of my school is tall, ridicously tall. these kids look like giants to me. Tbh i wish i wax a lil bit taller (i get teased a bit because of my height) IM RANDOMLY PICKED UP and being called a smurf or mega mind ( i have no bangs ;_; ) and its bad. Just try to be healthy and try your best… its tough eaither way…
So true
Holy shit she's 66 lbs like gain some weight this isn't  the fucking freak shiw
Same
Dame
BROOO SAMEEEEEE
Dude this is literally me and people make comments and shit hurts more then eny thing like shut up
Bruh, skinny af and can't dance, that's me, minus all this thick body hair that started coming out of the woodwork the last couple of years
Treu I’m skinny and I know it’s treu
I can  💯 percent confirmed
Lol she's so funny. Being a skinny person is a life of its own. Like walking in a wind storm and trying not float away.
I’m 12 and 80 pounds wtf
1. if ur fat it's too hot a lot of time. 2. if ur fat ur pants don't fit. use a belt. the belt doesn't fit. need to poke holes.(and a lot if you are getting even fatter. 3. ppl say how much do you eat? ur so fat. fat ppl like me have similar problems too :/
I was always super skinny growing up and relate to all of those except the being cold part. I've always been a Jesus it's way to hot type of person if it's over like 65° lol
Glad I don't have to deal with this. But sitting down does hurt after a while.
One thing I find is that people think that I'm extremely weak and can't defend myself/ take a hit (saying from bullying experience) But bro... Just cause I'm skinny doesn't mean I can't fight back, like, my muscles may not be as formed but they still exist (I don't know if this is just me but like... Why?)
So is Jayus a girl or a boy 👦🏼👧🏼
The fact that she’s less skinny than Kevin Durant
I was fat and lost 100lbs. ITS MUCH EASIER BEING THIN, TRUST ME
This is soooo acurate
You may be thin but you're still awesome and look great
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I fill the same
Facts
I’M NOT THE ONLY ONE! I always thought this was just me
I m skinny and it's so relatable people always tell go and eat some food
Skinny shaming cool but say what thing about someone overweight and the world goes mad. What's actually made is 90% of people overweight are overweight from how much junk they eat the amout they eat and the lack of exercise yet most anorexic are anorexic from poverty and mental illness. Not even joking that's true shit I had a brother who's overweight and I am anorexic and sure he got bullied for his weight but he got sympathy too if someone bullied me it wasn't even recognised and legit I'd get told eat a burger
I can relate to everything. I am 18. I weigh 30kg. I am 1.5 metres. N I wear a size 13 kids shoe.
I hear this all the time every single one thays crazy
“Oh my god it’s the Minecraft skeleton” is a new one people say, least I’m healthy.
At least your not overweigth
I'd rather be skinny. I eat 1800 calories a day and still can loose wait. My BMI is 27.  I want to get to 25  I run, lift and get good sleep.  Nothing works.
Not sure that last one affects skinny people but I can’t dance either some i could be wrong
I'm skinny as well AND I AGREEE
U r so lucky
Stop swearing you skinny pickle head.
Sooo its the same things that happen when your fat
me whose body is like this but im +sized: 👁👄👁
THIS IS SO F**KING RIGHT!!!!
i know how u feel i’m 35kg and i’m 15 yrs old hahaha
It’s okay I can’t dance either
Get some on dem bones-jacksepticeye(idk which video), and that’s all I could think of from what you said when you said get some meat on your bones😂
You dance better than me
About the dancing thing approximately nobody can dance no matter the size
My Sister is the same
Relatable😒 I’m 17 and weight 106
The not being able to dance part is just because we white 🤣🤣🤣
So tru
I don't know I think you just proved you can dance
Nice dance moves
True
The dance was wholesomely hillarious and i love it.
im not fat its called body armor fool
My shoulder bones used to protrude
"I just got into a healthy weight" No need to brag I'm still skinner that you 😒
You can dance 😉❤️
Same
You're beautiful and have the most awesome personality
You're still a kid.  It will come. Trust me.  I graduated HS at 6'2" 135lbs. Now I'm 6'1"(I shrank) and 220. Was 265 till I dropped my BF% to 16%.
I'm skinny as fuck
Another one: we dont fucking float
You’re still beautiful
So accurate
i’m always cold
I would still hit it if I were bored, though.
Are you grl  😛
I’m so skinny but I eat more than some people so I guess it’s either all the exercise I do or I don’t eat high fat foods
I relate to this so much!!! I’m 6’3 and 130.🥲
Agreed
Dude literally me. Everyone tells me I need to eat more and I eat as much as I can stuff in but I have a super high metabolism and I'm very active so I burn calories fast so I totally get where your coming from
Omg it's me from the future  I dance like that to
I’ve been fat all my life,  hey let’s switch
I have the same frickin problem
When you started dancing I started laughing so hard I almost cried
I feel ur pain
I dont really dislike ur video but i find u very uninteresting but they keep pushing ur face in front of me
Honestly you're pretty good at dancing!
The pain on the butt is real especially  at anywhere but a house
Is she single
I can relate to this
You can dance. At least better than me 😂
The amount of truth that just came out of this video I relate to all of these
Yep. Very accurate.
You can't call a fat person "big" because it's offensive, but it was okay for me to be called "shrimp" or "bird legs" my entire life. They're funny insults, but I hate double standards.
I think you look good
When I was a kid I was skinny and my parents and friends and their parents would be concerned but rude
I'm thin n, have high metabolism n, I've heard it all.. someone said damn! Eat something I said: pay my bill n, shut up....        😀
Just stop
I'm fat af and I am always cold so explain that please
Lmao same
Lol I have a friend who is really skinny and all I tell him is that he should eat more and he hates it
with all of the stuff I eat I shouldn't really be as underweight as I am, genetics suck lmao
Same issues lol
Me to I hate society because I’m to skinny and comments
Also swim trunks never ever ever fit me
Sammmmeee I’m 15 and weigh 90 pounds, I have all those problems, minus the dancing, I can dance 🤣😂
Me to I’m incredibly skinny
And everyone wonders why I always crouch when sitting
I’m not skinny, but I have all these problems too.. i think its just human problems. 😒
Yeah but I would rather be skinny
That's what I do poke new holes in the belt to make it fit
Excuse me but you are a God teir dancer. Change my mind
Her : Idk if you can tell Me: even Stevie wonder can tell 😂☠️
You just said my whole life
I don't care what the hell you say, you can dance better than me
I’m 5 11 13 years old and I weigh 155
Hahahha
Feel u I’m skinny too the comments hurt the most
I feel u I’m so skinny and it’s COLD
Girl you can dance.
Soooooooo true
Sitting down on the floor for an hour will leave you unable to walk
This is all me
Relatable
I'm SO freaking skinny. I can eat and eat but I don't gain weight. All of these problems I still have and probably always will.
The dancing reminded me of a song from peppa pig called "I'm a Wiggly Worm"
thats sooo true
Do tru you get so cold and laying or sitting to long hurts
You can definately dance lol
I can't dance either
People would rather deal with a skinny person like her than a fatso like me
THIS IS LITERALY ME BRUH
God, too real
I CANT DACE
Thank goodness that I’m not the only one with a skinny problem.
Girl! Yes! Body shaming isn't just towards "fat" people. I've Always been skinny as well. And skinny does not equal healthy.  Also it isn't are fault we can't gain weight or keep on weight.   Making nasty comments hurt our feels just the same.  And pants!  Oh the worst is finding pants long enough that also fit in the waist!!!!  And belts leave bruises on my hip bones too. So I totally get it!!!   It sucks ass being skinny too.
I eat a lot but im very skinny
Yo what sport were you playing? Basketball? Volleyball?
15, 6foot2-3 and 59 kg ,don't know what that is in pounds sorry
ya being supper skinny sucks especially in the cold
I am quite skinny myself 55kg 176cm tall so yeah but i do eat a lot and still didn't gain a single weight :| i think i might have a faster metabolism or i am doing too much exercise that i don't gain a single kg
Nice moves lol 😂
That dance was great.😂
Bro I’m fat AF and I want to get super skinny lol I’m so sad 😭
I’m skinny and I agree
Those fat people shit there draws a lot more
😂😂😂
You are also 6 feet tall! Oh please becareful don't step on me!
I feeeeeeel this hahah
It’s so true 😭
Eat alil more chicken and weight lift. And you'll be fine
My wife has watched a couple of your shorts with me and we both laugh into bed. So . Thank you for wing womaning me
I WANNA BE SKINNY AS FUCK
That's me when I dance lol we look like an alien lol
That last one wasn’t because you’re skinny lmfao
This is just my life
I agree
I can relate
Im so confused on what im supposed to be Skinny: problems  Fat: problems  Me: uhm..
Ok your 66 weight and you are probally like 18 and im 9 and i weigh 92
I have been hovering around 75 pounds since about 8 years old.
Yes
I'm eleven and I only weigh 74 pounds and I have all those problems
All of this  Especially the comments towards skinny children (and adults) I've been under 100lbs/45kg for my whole damn life and those comments are demeaning as fuck.   Or when you can't find clothes in your size and you're told just to shop in the children's section 🙄  Or are constantly compared to a druggie...
This is relatable
Did that weight say 664 or 66.4?
It is all true
Why does her dancing remind me of chandler bing from friends
Me af growing up
So true
I can relate 10/10
Poking wholes in belts really shows how similar we are
She's so skinny that when she turned sideways she disappears
You were shoes inside
Who stoped you from lifting weights doing squats leg lifts. That shit will give you a ass.
It's true 😂
Idk, I think you're built really nicely. Honestly, (& I hate this "system") I put you at SOLID 8.
THANK YOU PEOPLE FINALLY APPRECIATE MY PAIN
Im really skinny too so this is pretty relatable
You wear confidence and you wear it well you fucking rock just the way. You are stay golden 💯
Im 16 and I weigh 'bout 60kg. Yeah you could say I'm skinny and once I tried buing Bundeswehr(german army) cloths and jut took the smallest size availible. I hat to poke 3 more holes into my belt to get them trousers to not hit the fucking ground, whenever I was walking!
Hater’s gonna hate .I’m 42 155 but I can say i don’t have dad bod.
Skinny is normal and skinny is hot! Fat people are just jealous.
I can relate we had to make a ekstra hole in my belt asswell. BC im skinny and always has ben.
As a skinny guy yes
This is so relatable to me...
Omg your dancing technique is hilarious af 😂😂😂😂😂
No worries, you look beautiful!
You remind me of my sister your funny
Limited vocab.
The Last one. That's a you problem
All true
You have such a nasty mouth, I have to skip your stupid videos.
Not being able to dance is more of a you problem than a skinny person problem. No hate tho
Sit down? Yea boney ass just "feels" different.
Absolutely! Being 6'5 and skinny is my life. People don't think you eat enough and then they see you at a restaurant. Yes I eat like a horse but I'm twice as big as a person my age.
Omg, where are you. Your my kinda people.
Now how to fix fat problems, btw great dancing lol
Cant Dance Isn't From Being Skinny Lmao 🤣🤣🤣
Ya I relate
Jayus : I can't dance ;(  Also Jayus : busts the best moves
U dance fine for a white chick.
I asked someone to to make my face in clay they Made a skull
You can dance! Omg
Yep you can dance 💃🏻 lol 😂
You gotta nasty mouth
My cousin has problems with being cold cause she has muscular dystrophy
670?????
Am 12 and i got 37 kg
Skinny people probs right hear one good thing is I don't phat finger typing
You seem to dance fine to me....
Some Big people can't dance either
I don’t think the dancing part is bout you being skinny…..you just can’t dance
Hey i’m trying not to be rude but are you a girl or a boy and I love your Videos xx
I want your metabolism I need that skinnyness
Did you ever think to, I don't know, try the stuff on before you buy? Just curious.
ITS SO TRUE THOUGHHH
You have a boy body. It’s not surprising that you’re a lesbian. It’s just that you’re made that way so you should be focusing on the positive aspects of it. I know that it’s not easy but in my opinion you probably have the emotional and mental thinking like a guy also which in my opinion is more logical and less emotional. You are the way that you are and if you’re successful channel isn’t proof that everyone likes you…  It may have been tough growing up but now as an adult you can capitalize on this and so far I think you’re doing a good job.
Nis
I can confirm as well.. I've got the fastest metabolism.. I n high school i couldn't get over 140 and i was 6 ft 1in then...  I just finally got to a normal body weight for my size at 25.. Lolol 😂
I'm layerd and covered with blankets!
What sucks is I was kinda chubby until I couldn’t eat cause of my adhd meds and I lost 15 pounds in a few months and I’m constantly dizzy and my stomach is constantly hurting even if I eat enough and finding pants that fit is a pain!! I look stupid in any pants I try to wear
Bro so true. I may not be skinny now but i was for my childhood.
Bro if ion sit down the right way I sit on my bones and it ain't nice
I can comfirm
✨Don’t lie to ur self u can dance 💃 ✨
fat people get hostile man whattt thhe heeelll
Now is it she or he. He looks like both
I don't know what you talking about man you got rhythm
im a terribly skinny person, put now that i just turned 13 and got my period two months ago, i am starting to gain weight and body(curves), but everyone still tells me to eat more even though its just my body that i was born with and me having a fast metabolism, it also doest work like that. 🤷‍♀️
Wait your 66 lbs
As a skinny person,I can relate
The solution to the belt problem is to get a seatbelt style belt
I’m thick now and happy 😆 no more bruised butt bone 👍🏾
Dunno ... dance moves looked pretty good!! 👍
I am fat
Me just jamming With her
I feel you. I’m 6 4 and I can’t grow at all except upwards
😍
Omg! I have the same problem!!!!!
is being able to see your ribs skinny?
I love you!!
Finally someone who understands me
This is facts
I'm fat and I have to do new holes in my belt
Omfg this is so trueeee what I hate the most, when I get something to eat and everyone’s like awwwww your eatiinnnngggg, like, mf ofc I’m eating I still get hungry😭😭😭😭
Girl I'd take you out on a dance floor any day. You seem fun as hell 😤✌
Better dance moves than me I can't even spin around once
The can’t dance part is called being white
As a skinny one number 5 I can confirm is fucked up
I wish I was skinny!
Yup. The struggle is real. I actually found out that not only do I have high metabolism, I also have a gene that prevents me from gaining weight like a normal person. So I had to constantly eat junk food to keep the weight that I had. I was below 50kg up until my mid 30s.
Ayyy, this is me
Dancing is all about the legs. Arms are like the cowbell in "dont fear the reaper"
Skinny people can dance fym
Skinny person here. Confirmed.
As a member of the skinny association, I too can not dance
I can dance and I’m skinny however the biggest issue is that when I need to get clothes I need to go to France or Spain since here in the Netherlands there all fattier than me  I however never get cold
Well you’re still dancing better than me
I know the feeling I'm 30 and just now put on a lil bit of weight
It's true and the worst thing is I can eat whatever I want and how much I want and I can't gain more weight but still hearing from other yo get some food and s*it like that but when u say to fat person yo better get some diet and start workout they're just pissed but idk why cuz I say it in defense when they making fun of me
But no heart attack from high cholesterol. You’ll put weight on when you get older.
Don't lie about can't dance
She can dance better than me
As a skinny person, I relate
You can dance at least as good as Elaine
It's true and when you hit yourself. OMG DOES IT HURT!!!! I have  been both cubby and thin. Both have their good and bad.
Skinny People Dance The Best That Aint Why You Cant Dance 😅
Your metabolism was out of control at that time. The same thing happened to my nephew he could never put in any wait until after he was 24 25 so it's no big deal he ate like crazy and could never put it on
I am skinny because of fast motabalysm
Sorry I’m really fat 🤣🤣🤣
At least I can dance TvT
I mean as a skinny guy this is absolutely RELATABLE!
Ahh get you a big guy then girl, that'll solve a lot of your problems.
You can dance girl,  effing oath you can!!
Idk abt the dancing ur INSANE
Omg so true
So relatable smh it hurts
O poor baby your skinny 😢 and you can't gain weight 😢.......
Maybe if you put a muzzle on that face ANUS dropping turds in public you might make some progress. Just a little positive reinforcement for ya.
I beg to differ on the can’t dance cause I am sooo skinny and I love dance I have done 10years of dance
You dance just fine, grasshopper
Ass bones?
I’ve been skinny all my life, I can def relate
I’m skinny and I can confirm all of these are true
I don't know if the dancing thing could be considered a weight issue....
Ohhh fuck that just be yourself
Wish I had those problems, cold skinny girl! You're young n beautiful. Nobody cares that you're "skinny".
I'm 260lbs and I'm ALWAYS FREEEEZING🥶
As a fellow lank I’ve learned that if you can’t gain fat just gain mustle
dude I'd rather be skinny then put on weight every 5 seconds
I am skinny aswell. Can confirm this is true
I think you’re great
Jayus is a 10/10
Metabolism changes throughout life. I was chunky kid, opposite. Lost weight in mid teen years, good weight all my life. I won’t mention  getting older but I’m not like the morbid obese folks in area.  Focus on healthy, 👍
It's so true
She’d definitely cop the diddle
omg all of this is relatable but i know how to dance lol
I have all those problems (except the last one)
Ya im skinnier then u and its so annoying but i dont get as cold and its rly weird its like a medical problem but ya
DAMN SHES PRETTY N SHAME PROBABLY LIKES GIRLS… nothing wrong with THAT..BUT IVE LOST HOPE FINDING THE RIGHT WOMAN
Cant dance is a white people problem
You got better move than Michel Jackson
Get Just Dance
I have every problem you do 😅😅
THIS IS SO TRUEE
Wdym you’re so awesome at dancing 🤩🤣🤣
Don’t worry I haven’t found my jive either
Yea I’ve had to deal with that my hole life to
Tff
The dancing XD
Watch the filthy mouth
I have weighed  the same since the 10th grade. 147# Gained 10 in the Army.  Lost a few since usually 152.   Lol yep cold weather is a bitch.. but I ski and can dance  lol.
I've been fat my whole life ! My favorite shirt says ""I'm fat fuck off"
I relate to everything except for number 5
Bro I relate to this soo muxh because I am very skinny cause of medical
OMG FACTS
Why do these young people  use vulgar language so much, especially females do they think it makes them look tough? Must be why they put gobs of tattoos on thier body.
*this isn’t meant to offend I’m just saying my pov*  Okay no offense, but how come skinny people want to gain some weight while overweight people want to be skinny? This doesn’t apply to everyone, ik that but I wish we could all just be happy with who we are rather than always craving a change on ourselves
The one that says go eat more LITERALLY EVERY FAMILY EVENT IS MY GRANDPARENTS AND AUNTS SAYS TO ME "aRe yUo eVeN eAtInG sOmThInG???"
OMG WHY SO TRUE LOL
U can't dance has nothing to do with it weight
That was the best laugh I have had all day watching her dance.
You're still super smokin hot 🔥🔥🔥
I eat all time but I never take weight but like rarely
“Are you anorexic” is my favorite
I have to agree with this belts and laying down are the worst- and same with the cold that’s why I’m always wearing 3 jackets
Everyone I see constantly makes says stuff like go eat something or when I order a Berger they would say you do need it 🙁
Dude i watched this after just poking a hole into my belt fucking 3 inches from the last factory hole
I can tolerate your trashy mouth but you could leave God out of it.
I know exactly how you feel 😂 my friends all call me twig 😭
That's me🥲😭
Your still a better dance than me
Take some grade A vitamins and exercise
The leaner you are the longer you will live.
Whyyy iss thiss true😭😭😭😭
I always thought that I was skinny but I don't have any of these
I’m skinny af too but bad dancing is not a side effect lmao
I'm so skinny that you know the lines inside your chest bones yeah I can put my finger in between those and I can feel my heart beating literally
Ikr I’m 14  and I’m 80 FRICKIN POUNDS
The sitting down one is way too accurate. Everytime I go somewhere they need me to sit down for a long time, it starts to hurt after a while and I'm just in complete agony but I can't do anything because I need to be formal.
Omg same
I feel this on a deep level
How the fuck are you alive that shit said 66 pounds?
You hot accept the burden and carry on
Sooo a twig broke off a tree and than it tells me fun facts...noice
Gfgdgd
idk what you're talking about those dance moves are great
@onlyjayus you need a dad bod man lol
How do I have those problems I'm not skinny I have a lot of meat on my bones but I have all the same exact problems
That's so true
Those are some pretty sick dance moves. I don't know what the fuck you talking about
5'9 113 lb male here. I understand this video so fucking well.
SO TRUE
Your weight affects dancing?
I don't care if you're skinny...
Hey, nothing wrong with skinny.  I love people like you.
Hey.
I think you are pretty
It’s not that a skinny person couldn’t dance, it’s just they aren’t good at dancing
Bet Jayus has a Phat 🍑 ThO!! 🐱
This is all so true and living like that is so hard
at this point i’ve just embraced, there’s fat people who wanna be skinny skinny people wanna be fat and so on. no ones secure with themselves just appreciate your body. what really motivated me though is artist like kurt cobain who was insanely skinny but just didn’t care
SO TRUE
Why does tiktok give people with no personalty all the views.
Finally someone gets the struggle
Daaaaayumm she is so fkn fine tho
i can confirm.
Yaaaassasssssaaaa!!!!
ive always heard that I'd break and half and that I should "just go eat a burger " and I relate to every single one of these except dancing cause I was in classes when I was younger....but yea it's messed up to say to a kid
Bro. When I try to gain more weight, it goes to mah belly. I'm friggin skinny. And this happens to me too
No one is ever happy with their body and it's getting worse with easy photo editing/social media influence. Just enjoy being young,  healthy and hot.
Feature me for fat problems
You can dance just a little
I know how it feels exspeacialy the cold part
Thank god I'm not the only one who looks like a skeleton although hopefully I can beef up soon
My life
Don’t know what your talking about that dancing is imaculet
U dance way better than I !!
Love you skinny or fat baby
Lol your just like me! Wow 😐
Ah yes "SKEENY"
Yeah I’m only 55 kg and I’m skinny af my arms/shoulder hurt on a morning after sleeping my hips hurt! My back etc lol I hate it! I get super cold all the time and people think I don’t eat witch I do! It’s like I’ve got a hollow leg we’re all the food goes
This is ture
Omg yes I have such a hypnotism that I can't even gain weight I'm almost 20 now at 120 lb
Use to be anorexic, solution- exercise and eating much more
I was enjoying your videos up until this one, when your language got dumped into the toilet.
Your not the only one
I remember them problems when I was skinny.
I too can not dance, this is do to the fact that I know zero dance moves
I’m 14 (I’m on alt account) 6’2 and weighs 126.7.
She’s super cute ☺️ tho
Dude I have a freind like this and I'm chonky so we are complete opposites but get along so much
Ill take being skinny over being fat lol fuck that
Like holy shit i tried proper dancing lessons once and i look like a skeleton meme or something
Omg the language!! You’re not cooler when u cuss. Find other words to use & improve yourself seriously. Unsubscribing if I have to hear ur sailor mouth
As a kid i was skinnie as hell now i am a bit on the heavy side
I can relate
As a skinny person, I can also confirm, why is the belt, laying down, coldness, and the sitting 😭😭
I'm about average. Still can't dance though.
Of course you're a hooper too 😭
This is me
I can fully relate to this
Jayus I can't dance either soooooooo
Youve got better dances moves than I
Did it also make you racist
True story
I relate to the belt one as an overweight person🤣
Finally someone who understand my pain.
As a skinny person, JUST YES
Skinny is healthy
You look good tho
Finally someone says it, I’m skinny too, the only thing that put a dent in the “problem” was working out seriously for a while (strength training not cardio)
I don't think i ever exceeded 60 kilos on my weight Well yes i am 19yo guy, but this ain't making it better
Omg. I'm really skinny and ppl are like "why are u so skinny" 🌝🙄😒
So true im 20 kgs and im 8 bro my dad tells me i need to eat more but my body is always never hungry-
I understand them all
I can't dance! Fuck that was funny!
Drop the GDS
Being thin has nothing to do with your ability to dance. I was much better at dancing when I was in my twenties/thirties and couldn’t gain an ounce. It’s all metabolism, which seems to start and stop depending on how much you eat that determines your weight.
Your are funny 🤣😅
Ya god forbid you call someone fat but cant tell you how many times I've heard "omg you're so skinny ." no guy want women saying that.
Such a rough life. My heart breaks for you.
I'm 13 my size 9 pants are just wide enough but so short
Bc I am skinny
I feel same way
I thought you danced fine
Bro im skinny but I'm 230 pounds and know one belives me till they try picking me up. I think it's a tall ppl thing. I'm 6'6 so food goes too the feet
You can't dance 'cause you're white, not skinny.😅🤪💃💃
You’re a girl. .enjoy being skinny dafaq you complaining for lol
I STILL WANA BE SKINY 😪😭
Fat is natural body armor
Omg i feel ya on the ass bones. Currently on a medical regiment of lunges and squats....
You can join the it's just a crack club with me and my friend
As a skinny person this is true
You have a nasty mouth, have some respect for yourself
Hey now... those were class A dances moves. But where was the dice roll?
Just love seeing you daily. I want to be the real me but I don't know how to. You are Inspiron to me.
I agree with everything in this video, I don't know about the dancing problem if it's really about being skinny tho.
LOL I've been fat as duck my entire life
Yes lol this except #5 no one gave a shit hahaha
Look like you kinda got cheekies for being a bit thin.
6'6 here you first sure!
I think the dancing problem isn’t to do with being skinny
Yea I’m skinny also smh
You look nice and healthy now. Woot woot!!
That's one reason why I hate society
I’m skinny as hell to but I’m only in 8th grade and 101 pounds
People bitch as us about how skinny we are! But it’s so Fucking difficult to gain enough weight to be considered healthy! Life’s a bitch!
I cut down from 170 to 140 the past few months cuz weed kills my appetite.   Literally every one of these became true. At 170 I was always warm. Now I'm cold and my bones hurt from sitting down. Skinny dude problems are real.
Dem dance moves on point doe-
Amen!
I’m skinny and this is all true
Same, when I was younger grown ASS people commented also on how pale and or skinny I was 💀
I AM THISSS IVE BEEN SKINNY MAH WHOLE LIFE THIS IS MEEE
I am a kid and I can agree I am very short and skinny
True. True
Hey I have really good dancing and that's dance was really good
I feel this one😂😂😂
You look good 👍😁
Imagine being too skinny
Yes I did 11 got to 124ponds when was 10 I was 84 ponds and I am fuking tall
omg so true @onlyjayus thank you for inspiring me to give YouTube another whack, I have so many things to say haha and all the other platforms are dumb but shorts.. cool!
i consider myself skinny i mean my stomach is like in line with my ribs but i do ballet 🩰 and jazz
Hey well I can say one thing you dance better than me
I know what ur saying girl...I got bed sores on my bum bone  ahhhhh!! But have weight now!!!  U look look good girl XXX
As a skinny short person I agree
Same here. Once I destroyed some teeth from eating too much (but still not gaining weight), I took the freedom to cut people out of my life who were mocking me for something I clearly could not change due to hormones and genetics (dad is in his 50s and still has no dad bod even though we both eat like beasts) Anyways, love your content
You know being skinny I kinda better than being overweight ...you gotta workout to loose weight but you just gotta eat to gain weight ...
Vibes at the end
lucky
When I was in 2nd grade I was in a split class with 3rd graders and we took this picture and everyone made fun of how skinny my legs were and they weren’t even that skinny
Use Your Name next time you damm someone.
I feel this lol
You not even skinny and I’m bigger than you and my ass bones hurt when I sit down
As a skinny dude im always hot as fuck I don't get the "skinny people are cold" shtick
I can totally relate! When we would visit my cousins in Mexico, they would call me "la calaca" which in English means skeleton!
I am not only skinny i am short too. Sad life💔
What's up mosquito?
Those are very slick dance moves
I use to be skinny AF I use to be 97, now I’m 128 and I’m 13
your fucking awesome keep it up!
I completely fucking agree with you no one should ever comment on someone’s size whether they be too heavy or too skinny I would 94 pounds all through high school all through my 20s it’s only very recently I gained an amount of weight that is normal for an adult female I hated it oh my God I hated it I hated sitting down on anything remotely hard I froze my ass off I was horrible it was horrible I never wanna go back but I would also love to go back
I have recently lost 45 kg, 99 pounds, and my bum bones hurt all the time and I can’t sleep on my stomach because of my rib bones. I feel for you.
i can relate because im skinny
Literally no one cares about your emaciated body
Your the best lesbian in the world
{[LOVE][GRACE][JOY]}
Ive saved my belt since i was 16. I weighed 395 pounds and some change. I still use the belt. Im 23 now earlier last year i got down to 220. Unfortunately i gained 60 pounds since. Im still working on it. Im just happy im nowhere near as big anymore. I refuse to change my belt until im at a even 200.
I’m confused
Being fat sucks too maam 😭
Most of these are real skinny people problems
Same homie I could have a great night then eat like a whole taco twelve pack from taco bell and gain no weight besides like a pound I really don't understand it.. only cooking with butter and drinking more milk helps a TINY bit
Just eat some meat you will feel better
You don't  look that bad
You look healthy skinny isn't bad I've been 30 pounds over weight my whole life even one year I worked out and replaced 30 pounds of fat with 20 pounds of muscle and still looked the same lol. Your fine.
Oh you can dance you got some fire moves
You are totally adorable consider yourself lucky have you seen these fat b****** at the grocery store
Yeah, growing up in Wall-E’s America the regular/fat folk are always criticizing you for being skinny. Because not doing so is fat-phobic
As someone who is 6'4 and 67kg's I can confirm all of these are accurate. Especially the comments from people. People think it's funny, it's not. It leads to overthinking, anxiety and honestly depression. I hear someone on the bigger side say "oh you are so skinny you should eat more" but if I say "my god you are fat lose some weight and stop eating" it's considered fat shaming. Genuinely frustrates me to this day.  (Also was wondering why I can't dance.....now I know)
I get bullied by my family for being skinny and they think I find it funny
Can confirm I am a twig and I can't dance
And you’ve been complaining about showing your weird toe
I have alway been skinny too, so I can relate. Fat folks get XXL, but if you are thin, there is no XXSML...
Im 6 2 and weigh 280 pounds I wich I was as skinny as you  My back hurts to god damn much
True dat
I feel ya with having no ass meat.
Anger issues
Amazing. You are Amazing. Blessed Be.
Not only do I thin your hilarious, intelligent, and cool... I think your beautiful too
I know the feeling I grew to be 5 foot nine when I was 14 years old and weighed 145 pounds. I’m now about to turn 59. And I still weigh between 145 and 150 and all I’ve heard most of my life is how skinny I am and it really makes me sick coming from people who break into a sweat and get exhausted while they’re eating.
I felt that 🤦🏾‍♂️💯
That's some aweseome dance moves
Finally someone talked about it
Haha lo
The dancing thing is a you thing. Reference jamaican dancers. The men are skinny af
Same
I feel ya!
The comments are the worst
That's not down to genetics and no one forced you to be like that eat more, workout and quit giving a shit. If they're big enough problems you will care to fix them 👍
Why just why don’t dance for us please
Just be happy while you are like that. I was the same way. I would never gain weight I thought. Lol. I'm 40 now and I miss the skinny jokes.
“I can’t dance”  What are you talking about  Those moves made Michael Jackson cry 😩✋✨
Arent you racist or something
i can confirm i feel insecure when i dance as an semi-skinny person
❌it’s not a joke, it’s a hazard✅
Honestly, the skinny person thing sucks and doesnt get recognized at all unless you're also skinny. This video was very relatable.
poking new holes in a belt… me
Yeah people used to say “Man, I wish I looked like you!” and I just looked at them and said “Thanks, I have an eating disorder. No you don’t and you shouldn’t idolize my weight. It’s not healthy.” And omg the burger thing! The putting meat on my bones! Bro I’m a vegetarian! I’m autistic and have a lot of food sensitivities! And an eating disorder too! Fuck off, I’m dealing with it the best I can!
Im skinny af to
I’m 80 lbs
I am skinny and this video makes me sad for reminding me im skinny
You say you can’t dance but you’ve never seen me try. You got them pro skills!
Obsoletely gorgeous the sister with dark hair!
very true i'm a thin kid, the annoying thing we go tru! UGGH!!!
You have no idea how many times I have heard: "Im scared you are gonna break😰" Like- 😭one time a friend compared me to a fucking quesadilla WITHOUT the cheese😂
U can dance but look funny doing it.
When she danced😂! Not hating. Just saying. But I think the dance that she did should be a tiktok dance in the future!
So true. Though my ribs start hurting if i lie on my stomach for too long.
Bruh I'm skinny AF And my whole family ofc wants me bit fat And I eat Junk food and burgers On my midnight snacks And I eat a lot instead eating normal and I'm still skinny af
Sweet Bella
6'4 170 and have never been over that in my life and I eat like a fuckin pig lol ah well
i decided to lose weight one time and now i'm skinny as fuck and i regret it
Welkom to the skinny team
Lol 😂. I’m a guy and i feel you
I have the same issue.  I’ve never used hard drugs ; and yet everyone around me thinks I do cuz I’m weird and skinny. I actually have a fat malnutrition disorder so does my mom and my grandmother as well as her mom. Usually mostly women have this but as a twin odd occurrences do happen frequently
On the other end of the scales...still gotta poke holes in belts, slightly hot and I melt, told im a fat arse need to loose weight. Oh and dance alot worse then you.. once I stop body keeps jiggling for a bit.
Grass skirt?
You look ok, healthy, what people can see in your hair, which is great..... But don't dance... 🤣
The dancing thing may just be you jayus but being really doesn't help either so mhm
You dance literally just like me!! I love it 😂😂
Super sexy slim 😍
You dumbass. So you get cold because your skinny. It’s called circulation. 😂
Still better than being obese
I'm skinny.. but I think I dance okay
PERSPECTIVE!! 😨 In comparison to the 5' 5", 75 Lbs. women in Bangladesh, who're practically starving to death 'cause they haven't had a meal in the past 45 days, YOU'RE MORBIDLY OBESE!! 😎🤔
All the other women in my family were size humongous scared the crap out of me I never got over 103 lb even having five kids I'm 60 now I'm still a size 2 and oh you're so right and a lot more
I wish I had the skinny aspect everything’s but the comments on the skinny ness and the belt I have. Dancing’s probably my own problem lol
Sooo true!!! 🤣
All of this is super accurate for my experience
Yo same I have been on an ice cream diet since I was about 4
"Eat a burger" HA my metabolism is faster than a formula 1 race car also goes with how much energy and patience I have (also I wolf down food)
Dance Moves were on point
U look like the girl drone American ultra no cap
High matabolisim is a bit h
You definitely Can Not dance......
Dude I'm skinny as fuck
This fucking girl 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im fat, but I have a Hank hill ass, so the sitting down and the belt problems are still issues for me
I feel personally attacked by this
Skinny is good. Don't complain.
When you barely got fat on your back, doing situps without a mat underneath you is stupidly painfull.
sit ups are the worst
You look nice
Tbh ur dance moves zre godly 🤣
Cocaine is a hell of a thing
Oh cool she plays basketball
Eat something
Unfunny
I get the "you must be so fragile" type comments all the time...nope, not fragile at all. Ive crashed my quad, fallen from high up, been in fights, ect. Never once broken a bone. People gotta stop saying stuff like that, it's just ignorant
Ha ha
Have a couple kids.... Fixes that skinny problem.
I rlly love ur dance😂😂
It's not just belts, I sometimes have to poke holes in my watches
No such thing as bad dance moves in my eyes
I’m not super skinny my thighs r fat asf 💀 but I do have a SUPER SUPER tiny waist so I always have to use a drill to make new holes in my belts LMAO
Can you not swear
I think you have great dance moves :>
As another tall lanky person I too cannot dance my stick limbs dont bend
I eat like a fucking horse
Love ur personality u seem soo dwn to earth funny and smart..and ur gorgeous
So if I gave her back shots would her ass bone just be hitting me
You're right, you can't dance...
My back always got bruised on go-karts. I couldn’t lay on my stomach on a hard floor without hurting my hip bones. I think adults taunted me more than kids.
Omg you're me in woman form aside from the cold lmao. Being called a bean pole or saying you'd blow away in the wind. Yeah thanks guys
Weird and non-relatable question— I’m 11 and I’m 5,4 is that normal height? :D
You have best moves 😎
Totally relatable
Hold up she can ball? 🏀 where can I find this 👸 at?
I mean society goes both ways tho. For big, small, loud, quiet, pretty, ugly, girls, boys. Everybody gets hurt by society, it’s only bc society hurts society. This might not make sense to people but the people who get it get it. For big people society is “stop eating” “why do u eat so much” . Love everybody guys! Especially yourself!
Watch your mouth you don’t need to cuss
If laying down on your stomach gives you bruises on your hips, and you feel cold all the time, you just might be anemic.
Skinny jokes are = to fat jokes
Eat some burgers
Have a baby and age 10 years. It will put a few pounds on you. Ask me how I know.
You still skinny by the way
How do you get to a healthy weight??
Bro I can't dance too and I'm chubby
"Ur so skinny" ur so fat "that's fat shaming"
Idc...ure still cute
Your gay I see it
True
Whats your complaint? Love the skin your in.
How are your fingertips?
I wish to unsee her dancing.
Have you seen a fat dude dance? Ain't pretty
I been skinny for all of my life 2rd one and 3rd is really true cuz when i lay to long my body will get painful and sooo true 3rd one like i get really cold all the time
I been skinny for all of my life 2rd one and 3rd is really true cuz when i lay to long my body will get painful and sooo true 3rd one like i get really cold all the time
She dances better than me
I'm in shock buy the dancing 😥🤣
BTW how height are you mrs.onlyjayus
Your so frickin beautiful  lol
Chill with the cursing for real you good?
The eat more gets to me all the time 😅
Jayus: I have been skinny my whole f life  Me: ANOTHER ONE OF MY KIND
I'm not skinny but I can't dance
I know this feeling all too well and the fat positive people have no idea
If it means anything coming from me your still hot we could get it!!! 😘😍🤣
I think number 6 us just you...
no one can dance
You are funny .
Oh you poor thing. As someone that was 120 in High School, will you STFU trying to appeal to that dumb fat positive cult? Nothing you talked about is a problem.
Hahahaha I wish
I’m sry but u dancing had me cracking up
Listen I'm not trying to be racist  but these are simple facts. The reason why you can't dance isn't because you're skinny. You  can't dance because a majority of you white folks simply don't have any rhythm
Those are the best dans moves I’ve never seen
My son has the same problem. He gets upset by the same comments, it's like people saying the same to big people. Just the other end of the spectrum! You are beautiful sister 💜
And if the holes dont fit might as well turn into a walking talking lamp
If you go out side in Baggy clothes in the wind You can fly
The dance 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 can't stop laughing 🤣😅🤣😅🤣
“ noodle arms “
Most of us tall people look horrible dancing xd
My friend is skinny as paper and can somehow do the worm
Iam 14 and iam soo skinny since i was 9      Thats terrible trust me :'(
I have some weight I would be happy to share lol If only I could It would be a win/win
You can’t dance because your white
Pretentious swearing is pretentious
Idk about yall, but I'm skinny but the cold isn't an issue
I can eat well over 3000 calories a day and stay 145, I hate when people say you need to eat when I eat more then them.
I totally feel ya on this one!
Omg this is so true. I may only be 10 but all of this is true.
Can relate
I feel this
I think the cant dance part is just you   😧
Jayus: *weighs herself* Me: SHES WEARING SHOES IN HER HOUSE?!?
A lot of those are just fat people problems without the social stigma lmao
Girl I love your face very much
I feel that
Jayus I mean this in the NICEST way possible, the dancing is not a skinny people problem...
I'm skinny too, and most of this stuff is a problem for me too.
Cute
Her voice sounds like a hug
I eat non-stop and I floofing skinny
I can tell that you yell and swear too farking much
Not to be mean to anybody or anything, but as a Mexican I have seen a lot of people who have two left feel and literally can't dance so I think your dance is pretty good I mean it doesn't look stiff or weird enough and you're just having fun which is what's the mos important part and btw my older brother dances almost just like that and it's not half bad and yes he is skinny too lol.
Im skinny as f*** but I'm a dancer and on a competition team, the dancings on you ma man
;-; same
Work it girl!!
As a guy who's always been chubby I would trade places with you skinny folks any day.
Omg its so true😂
They want you to be a lard ass like everyone else
I am with you on this one I’m kind of skinny
You dance pretty well, might I suggest adding the only moves I can pull, “the Macarana” and “the Carlton”
u dance better than i do
If ur height was small and u were 20 kg and ur haircut was like mine , I guess u were my twin 😂😉
Same number 5 is too true
I know the issue well. However I don't know anyone one over 50 that can look down and still see their shoes.....but I can😁
I think you are absolutely gorgeous.  Youe Confidence and personality,  as well as your intelligence make you beautiful,  I think your body is perfect... it's your body it's how you were created... but anyways If you were my girl I would be proud that I was with you
Fuck you’re hilarious I love it 😂
God made you perfect
My sister is a walking stick, after 50 year's she had weight, 64 kilos and she was happy 🤣😂👏👏👏my sis is cool 😂
Only recently have I started to ad some muscle on me but I’m still mostly skinny
The last part has more to with your caucus DNA. They are known for lack of rhythm
I relate to all of those. Tho I never really considered my self that skinny
hey if you probably dont know what video to make a few videos about zodiac signs (I dont know why ppl think pisces is the dumbest one of them all please explain)
I literally thought everybody’s ass bones hurt
Why must you hurt me in this way
Stop downing yourself your beautiful ,adorable and healthy than most people
Belt thing goes both ways.  Big people have trouble finding belts that are big enough.  When we need one, we NEED one.  You cant poke new holes in a belt to make it bigger.
This is how I am
the comments from people are like fucking knives stabbing into ur hea
Eat more workout get some weight ez
But can u say the n word
Oh and dont get me started with the “oh i wish i could be as skinny as you. Always eating a lot and never gaining weight” No, no you fucking don’t
Hahah Sweet that Part with Dance
I ❤ U
Sheesh, nice dancing
Fat people can’t dance either but nobody says anything because we are already depressed enough
Lol this video is so funny
I don't think 3 and 6 are focused about being skinny
You’re hilarious!  Love ya
U dance fine girl
I'm the same way
I used to be like that
You just have a high metabolism. Nothing to worry about and if anyone says different they stupid.
Nooo u dance
Still racist
im underweight and ALL of this is correct
Smoking hot though
I'm skinny af too and I relate to this 😅🤣
I am skinny but i dont have this problems, just the dance thing, guess it goes to the person
I hate how everyone says something nasty even if your thin or fat and I know that’s a big struggle And for a kid it needs to be felt with 🥺
That's my sis
What the absolute fuck
How the fuck are you 6 FOOT AND 69 lbs
Bad choice of words
You can't blame being skinny can't excuse the dancing
Totally can relate to you
#5 was crazy relatable bruh i was skinny up until a few months ago when i started going to the gym but the comments people would say are as bad as calling someone fat
smh just eat
Sorry can't relate to that
Last time I tried dancing I fell in my face
I’ve been skinny for my hole life but I’ve been not wanting to be skinny
You're a beautiful person inside and out
Are you a boy or girl
Yeah
Can dance better than me
Saaaamme issues
Story of my life. It took me reaching my 30s to reach a point where I could gain weight and keep it on. It was rough being stuck at 145-150lbs at 6’3 for most of my adolescent/adult life. Thankfully I’m now 220lbs
I don't have enough azz to hold my breeches up
Shes actually a pretty good dancer
Id still hit, even merry
I had that all my life. Most people wrote me off as a tweaker. It took almost 3yrs of triple whey protein shakes with each meal every day as well as snacks… now I’m skinny fat ha ha ha
Stop- its to relatable. Also when like you have to kneel on a hard floor and you bruise your knees 😀
i suck at dancing, trust me
People used to ask if I was anorexic
And then the belt hurts your hipbones
Danm she thicc e hell
You can dance better than me
Well, better than fat person problems. I was born fat and has been fat all my life and for whatever reason my body decided to grow to 6’4”, so I’m huge in every dimension and my doctor told me that my ankles will be dead by the time I’m 25. To avoid having to wear ankle braces for the rest of my life I had to teach myself a whole new way of walking that reduced the stress and impact my ankles are exposed to every step and it involves absorbing my body’s momentum into my knees, hips, and foot bones. It is 10 times more tiring to walk this way and a side effect is that I make next to no sounds while walking, so I also inadvertently scare the shit out of people when this 6’4” 300lb man-shaped behemoth just appear out of nowhere behind or besides someone. I’ve been pepper spray TWICE by two DIFFERENT chick friends of mine who knee-jerk reacted when they suddenly noticed me looming besides them. I’ve lost count of the number of screams I’ve elicited from people. Also my best friend is eternally confounded by how someone with his own gravitational field doesn’t cause a miniature earthquake every time he moves.
I love ur Elaine Dance
I relate too much with number 5 I was put under watch to make sure I was eating, sometimes I ate till I threw up just to gain weight
How about tall and skinny. Tell me where I can by pants that are long enough
SITTING DOWN FOR 6 HOURS AT SCHOOL IS THE WORST I AM SO SORE AFTER A SCHOLL DAY
As a skinny person I agree
I’m the same way
Lol. Omg yes..
Hard chairs were the worst in college. My butt was bruised.
But really, not as flipping bad as being a teen, and like 288 or 300!!!! I have been walking on the treadmill for 20 min a day, for a while, hoping to get to at least 220 maybe
After loosing 20 pounds I definitely get colder quicker and more often.
HELL YEAH YOU CAN DANCE, BRUH YOU NEED TO COME PARTY, we got drinks, drinks, and more drinks
Great dancing lol A+
Awww…..same.  I finally gained enough weight to look “Normal” but now I have testicular compression between my thighs.  Fuckn hurts and I have to walk like a baby with a full diaper.  Btw I think you’re a fantastic dancer.   For a broom stick   Don’t come near me with those ice pick elbows.   Jk lets make out 💋
as a skinny 11 y/o,, i can confirm all of these ☹️
I just got D ring belts.
Have you heard I’m afraid the wind gonna blow u away followed by a weird ass laugh as u can tell I’ve been in the same boat
Fat people have just the opposite we get comments like that like go eat a salad you need to lose weight so I know what you're going through
Bella:"i can't dance" Me:lies, lies and slander
Youre beautiful,dont worry
Jay dance made my day 😂
I'm also thin all of this is true Tho i can dance been dancing since i was born
I'm not skinny yet but I'm loosing like 3kgs a week coz I don't eat enough and my exercise is stupid hours
I've done that before the belt thing
This one hit deeeep. I'm 6'6 and was usually around 160 to 170. Last year I made it a goal to put on weight while working out and am 230 now. People aren't ready to have the "you so scrawny" body dysmorphia convo yet though.
So go to the fkin gym
This is so fucking relatable man
U fuck morr then u talk lol..saying fuck more then words
That's some great dancing
Nice moves
My mom called me golem from lord of the rings I think its funny
Exactly
Me, skinny asf  also me: literally a heater
Anyone can dance
My 6” 1’  14 yr old daughter has Marfan Syndrome…super skinny as well. We cracked up at this video! LMBAO!! Keep up the funny work young lady! 👍🏼🇺🇸
Can relate my friends bully me cuz im skinny and say they can break me in half
"I can't dance" *proceeds to bust moves*
people underestimated me for being skinny but i'm not
so true
She fine though
U were also racist as fuck too
I'm also super skinny but my family and friends know that I love food. I'm also short and very underweight.
What do you mean you can't dance?!?!?
YES!!!!! HOLY FUCKING HELL I DIDNT REACH 100lbs until I was  A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL!!!!! And I didnt reach a healthy weight until my Senior year. And what was weird as fuck is that I blame my boobs for my junior year because that was when I suddenly got them. Went from a B to a D and wondered WTF. My friends and I were bored one night as well and wanted to see how fast our metabolisms were. So we weighed ourselves right before bed and right after we woke up. I LOST 7 POUNDS IN MY SLEEP. 7 FUCKING POUNDS!!! Everyone else was two maybe three but no I'm blessed with a metabolism that rivals the speed of speedy Gonzales
I have the ideal body type without effort. Boohoo
You dance like a mumble rapper, rapping, nah jk but you’re funny and cool af, sending peace and blessings 👍🏿✌🏿💯
Too Easy
Okay.. I relate!
My brother's friend always tells me to eat a pork chop.
Post your dance videos !!!! Asap  I really love it ❤️
Your dance was just😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You can even dance better than me 😂
You honestly got everything so spot on know exactly what you mean  like exactly lol
I grew up same way.  I was 6'6" in 7th grade.  And skinny.  Now I'm 43 skinny as fuck
The dance moves
I can confirm all of these frfr
This is my body in a  nutshell
People complain about fast food being bad and unhealthy but then there's people in 3rd world countries that wouldn't complain to start gaining weight.
I would have said to a really skinny person if I hit you you might break into pieces.
lol when you started dancing lmao
Thank God I'm a healthy weight
damn true
Omg yes sitting down hurts
✨Skinny people problems ✨ i can relate 😀
I’m 13 and i weigh just under 60lbs 💀
Every point is so fricking true, can totally relate to every single one!  🤣
I used to be kinda fat.. I had a concussion not so long ago and.. well I was just sitting in my bed all day long.. so I wasn’t hungry so I would eat every 2 days.. and now 2 moths ago I had enough so I started working out and eating waaay more.. ( by the way I’m vegan so it’s not easy). Well it took me a while.. but now I’m starting to like myself
I dropped 130lbs and the new people I meet think I've been skinny my whole life😂😂😂. Oh yeah!!! I get cold really  fast as well ever since I slimed down 🥶😂
Go wash your mouth out.  Sorry you had shitty parents.
Oh was the same, then I got put on antidepressants and nownim fat af.  Lol no I'm not obese but I could certainly do with losing some weight now.  Tbh I miss how my ass hurt when I used to sit down now lol.
That dancing was better than mine!
How I feel
When she tried to dance all her bones broke at once
I felt 5 like...
I’m hella skinny but I have no problem
Most people just can’t dance
Check check check and ✔
My femur always pokes out and that is the only way may pants stay up
Your dancing traumatized me 😬
Please don't break...
This is SO relatable
Tapeworm
Don't matter if i poke holes in it, i dont have an ass or hips for the belt to hold onto at MOST im just delaying the inevitable
The dancing has nothing to do with your body lmao
I ‘d rather have skinny problems than fat problems like diabetes, heart disease, or any number of obesity driven diseases.
"Omg do you eat go eat a burger" My life story of what people say to me 😂
i’ve always been Skinny aswell  as a younger child people say  ‘’ You never eat ‘m ‘’ your a stick!
You look great
I'm just really small short and skinny
First off yes you can dance
Stop. Cussing.
Ayo she's listening to muzan Jacksons song
omg not just me! ( I like it cold)
"Do u even eat?" Shits annoying af.
If you are skinny eat more carbs, fat and protein
i literally hate it when someone says go put some meat on ur bones also most of these are very relatable    besides the dancing thats just u jayus
This is a unrespectful moment when individuals has no understanding and or respect for God. Exodus 20.7. Accept Jesus as your savior and repent of your sins and worship God.
When you dance I thought you were having a seziure
The Most Relatable Shit I've ever Watched in My Whole 16 years *Everyone keeps saying "Do You Eat? you're gonna collapse just due to a breeze" *Clothes Don't Fit *Cold problems
Your right u can't dance
Your really really pretty BTW! Hope you know that
I'm not sure what dancing and being skinny have to do with each other?
I was at 129 Lbs! Yeah, my ribs and hip bones hurt laying on my stomach!
Fr fr. Im 6 ft 5 and only weigh 150. This has been a problem my entire life. Btw im 36 and weigh the same.😢
Atlast there is someone who is actually talking about this. Especially the mentally affecting a kid part cause when I was 13 one of my close relatives asked me if I know how to eat food. That made me depressed for almost a month straight. Thank you so much for talking about this 🙏
Yessssss so true! I have all those problems 😅
The comments hurt the most
IM SO SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNY
Interesting 🤔 Not
I have most of these
I'm skinny and good thing the people in my country aren't that judgemental
HEY people also can’t dance like me💔
t's not a mistake, ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
t's not a mistake, ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
t's not a mistake, ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Jajajaja my 9 year old  daugther dances like you jajaja
Dance walz or quick step, Hard to dance if you are not thin
Still got better moves than most lol
what they don't realise  is that saying that saying that to a skinny person is the same thing as telling every fat person you see " Just eat a salad you fat cunt. You're soo fat not even the mountains move you" They act like this because they think like this" "  When fat people tell a doctor that they're fat they are given a diet but skinny people don't have diets therefore just eat more food"
Well being fat sucks
Yes finnally someone just like me
I personally love tall skinny girls. Big bonus is big feet with long toes. I find you cute.
You can't dance? How can you say that?! That dance was amazing!
I liked the 1st dance lol
al of em so relatable
LITERALLY MY WHOLE LIFE RIGHT THERE!
Your beautiful just the way you are, keep vibing! P.s. I’ll keep you warm also other things
Sick dance moves
Actually your bones have no feeling
Love it love it that me too
that was a evolution
*onlyjayos "I cant dance" *dances*  *me "bro you can dance to me!
My pants 😭never fit mee
jayus "Can't dance" also dancing like a chad high on something 😆
Ayo 😳
Wtfc
They’re all so true
That dance like,Wtf
Well think of the benefits your always flexible
You just can’t answer so lotta skinny people That can
As someone who was drastically bullied for being overweight pretty much my whole life I would trade positions any day
Doing sit-ups at the school gym(hard floor)
can't dance!? LIES!  You KILLED it!
FINALLY I RELATE TO SOMEONE
I think the scale said like 669…
Your beautiful
I wish I was skinny
Do you live in America? Only because it seems as though the scales were in kgs and on other videos you have been in the car and the wheel is on the right. Im probs wrong but just thought it's worth asking
Now I feel confident about being… big… ger than you
Yeah I can't dance either but I'm slightly tubby -_-
Better than me
I would love to date a girl like u so down to earth and fun. And skinny lol I like that
I love your dancing
+ your scared to show other people your arms so you wear a sweatshirt and that’s why most skinny people hate summet
The dancing 😂😂 that was the best part
3 and 4 but worst is I never could gain weight which is the opposite of everyone else.
The eating one really gets to me. I have to drink protein shakes just to maintain healthy weight. #Skinny-Shaming #Fat-Shaming are equal in messed upness
Yo I've been skinny my whole life too, I've heard it all.
I wish ppl would see that telling a skinny person they need a burger or some other rude comment is just as mean as telling a person that they’re fat and need to diet
Dance better then me XD
is this a girl or a guy?
Woman! Don't ever quit these shorts! Some of the are fukn hilarious!....
How tall is she? I'm curious to know...
Your a fucking girl? Damn I just realized
Better dancer then I am
As someone who is much thinner than you, I can say that it's absolutely false that you get bruises from lying down in that way.  But I get it girl, your "I'm so quirky" attitude can only get you so much attention, so you gotta pull out the "my privileges are aktchully making me a victim".  And you pander to equally vapid women, so you actually get exactly what you sought after.
I love how you embrace your life!! Keep that shit going!! Also your dance move are smooth!! Don't ever let anyone stop you from being you!! 💥😎🤙🏽🤙🏽
so true, i’m 11 and weigh like 65 pounds
The thirst is real for jayus too bad no quy will ever quinch it
Throw all those dance moves together and you'll pull it off.
Everything but the last one
The dancing we must protect you at all costs ❤️🥺😤
This is soo me I barely can find close and belts the fit and I'm cold all the time and people call me a stick I'm not even joking
Omg
Your dance moves are amazing 😂😂
That is so me😭😭😭😭
Yep too true. Especially the eating disorder accusations.
Same
Where is the 28 inch waist gang at...
When I was thin (the good old days!) I used to have problems number 1, 2 and 3.
I relate to all of this I can’t gain weight no matter how hard I try just never hungery
Being skinny has nothing to do with not beable to dance, 😂😂😂
Literally everything you said is relatable to me
Oh sorry your thin and not fat🙄. I bet thousands of people wish they were your size
You turn into Mr. Burns
Omg same happens with me all the time
How can people be underweight? Like, Just eat a dozen pizzas
Relatable
Those dance moves were fire, don’t know what she’s talking about
Thats meee!!
Same very accurate .. thanks dumb ass I eat non stop trust me I don’t want to freeze . Don’t get me started on belts lol
Did you drop out of the WNBA
Ahh someone I can finally trust
Just I like your videos but like have you ever thought about over weight  people who have it a lot harder sometimes
Bro Same
How about NEVER finding clothes that fit you!
Society can suck ass tbh. Skinny and Overweight people never feel comfortable outside just by walking around because they dont fit in the image society wants to portray. If u look at skinny or overweight people weird and laugh at them, i Hope ur pillow is warm on both sides
we found out her boyfriend lesgo
My favourite one growing up was “bet you have to run around in the shower to get wet”
I'm also so skinny
Your telling me I’m 13 and I’m 80 pounds
It's less you can't dance and more ,you shouldn't dance 😀😀
Ask me if you need help gaining weight I am the person to help you and the food is tasty and good for you but you can gain weight fast just making shakes with yogurt or ice cream not milk that’s a tip
**exhales**  Sooo *relatable*
I mean I am good at dancing always dancing into kpoppppppp kpop forever I'm adicted to kpop
I like skinny
My cousin is skinny as heck and she can dance so well
I don’t…I don’t think you not being able to dance is a skinny person problem…
I can relate  I'm in 6th grade and I'm 80 pounds
This is so true I am really skinny and for problem 4 I usually buy braided belts so I dont have to poke new holes
WTF  is wrong with your dancing 😂
The dance part lol
Your absolutely awesome in my book.. You go girl
So true and the bad part is your family does it to an I’m only ten
Tbh u do be hittin moves tho
i have issues w/ my body cos i have a big belly but everything else is thin
Bro im too skinny i can realate to everything u just sayed
Nope u can dance 🤣 for sure
Girl... your dancing skills have nothing to do with your weight. I know it... I'm overweight and dance the same as you :')
You are hilarious I love you videos.
All of them, except the dance part
You can't dance cuz your white stop blaming skinny
i get made fun of for being built like a twig😩
Eat healthy foods  and you will naturally gain weight 🍇🍉🍊🍌🍍🥕🍒🍑🥔🍆🍐🥑🍏🥝🍞🍗🥚🥙🍚☕🥛🍯
Very true I’m very skinny and all of that is true
BRO I FEEL UR PAIN
But u dancer better than me TvT
OH MY GOD!!!   I flipping hate it when people say "you need to eat a sandwich!" Like I AM YOU A$$HOLE!
Sorry for this. Put some rocks in your pockets it's windy today. Sorry I know that was ridiculous. PS I think you can dance well.
I am also skinny
I’m also very skinny and literally my cousin bully’s me for it. All of this happens to me to
Apparently fine af too
If your skinny, older people just tell you "go get fat" and when you do get fat, they say "I miss when you were skinny"
But what about big people probs
Fucking relatable. Especially the society part, and cold. Except I low-key love cold. 😍❄️😂
Cute
now if i wanted to get a girlfriend who was the best dancer in the world, i’d wish jayus was straight
I have a low metabolism so im overweight not really I'm just short
This bitch says "fuck" every 3 seconds.
My favourite YouTuber! 😆
Get some meat into ur bones skinny
Bruh I used to get so cold I would have to miss out on some soccer games even though I had fucking thermal under layers And I was in PA, a place that actually isn’t super cold
I am feeling a little bit better now with my "tank" body
i feel like the more i eat the more i get skinnier
I can remember back when I was like 19 and finally grew into 29 inch waist pants. At 62 years of age I'm back to the 27 inch waist.
Being skinny is not easy. People bodyshame you right in front of ur freaking face!!!!
Skinny people usually can dance
He dance better than those tik tok girls
Can relate in every way listed!
Lifting helps
It is relatable.Very very much
I AGREE!!!
Hehe, I’m short
Also it's not a mistake it's a masterpiece ✨
I am 5 9 and 10 and 50 pounds and your video is every thing that is wrong but you missed out on how much you stand out in school
I'm skinny too...and u dance better than me 😂😂🤣
Ok
I can confirm this
We all got problems.... Hilarious depicting your skinny issues...getting cold fucking fast :)
Why does she dance better than me 🥲🤚
So, This happened a few days ago and I don't really eat at my school lunch so I'm really freaking skinny, My crush is always like "Bruh, Go eat, You're so skinny, I can see your ribs" and not alot of people know, But thats very offensive, And if i eat, He is like "You should eat less"
Does happen to me.
U a guy or girl I cant tell
This is like way too relatable
Your dance moves actually turned me on😂😂😂
I have rare oh beast so it's hard for me to lose weight same thing for us everybody picks on us too. I just wish I was your size you're so lucky
people invalidate me for these problems and tell me I should be happy to have them, meanwhile part of the reason I'm so skinny is because I have organ failure :/ fuck off, I'm not happy to be underweight, I wanna be the standard or at least healthy. don't come at me with "skinny is the standard" because yeah, it is, if you're curvy and shit and yk. FIT. which I'm not. I have my issues, yall got them too and you can keave it at that.
THEY ARE ALL SO TRUE (except the last one)
You can definitely dance
What the heck you can't DANCE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Same
Be you and let no one tell you to be different. Skinny people as funny and smart. I think you dance ok not terrible. Everyone is special in their unique way, btw you'll probably live long too.
13  5" 0' and only 94 lbs I'm all legs and have no waist I've been told multiple times to eat more but I'm just not hungry I got bony shoulder blades and my ribs show through my skin I feel the skinny people problems 🤣
Dancing is easy
Okay, I'm a guy. 5'7 when I was 20 I was 112 lbs. Now, at 44 I gained a lot. I'm 135, jaja. I have poked new holes in belts. But we are not really that skinny. You look like an average woman here. Or like an average American 50 Yeard ago. I eat like a pig, but bike a lot and have a super fast metabolism. If I skip a mealI can loose a pound within a day. Although I know women prefer tall men or bigger men, I stopped caring about that. I Love my body and will live to 97 like my grandma.
That's true
I am skinny and i can relate to all of them
U fine
I know what you mean😕😕😕
No insulation .. 😭😭😭
I am skinny and I feel your pain
You're cured. 🤣
That's some dance moves... 😂
Thou shall not use thy Lord’s name in vain!

Number 6: Mom come pick me up im scared
Same 😓

YO THIS EXPLAINS THE PAIN I FEEL ON ME BUTT BONE (I am ether close or am slightly underweight)
How tall are you?
You forgot to mention sitting on the toilet for more than 5 minutes makes your legs fall asleep lol.
Me who’s fat: I’m something of a superhero myself
I like the vibe of this girl 😄
I remember the days

The ass one is so relatable
Honestly tho this is so relatable I can eat anything and gain no weight
Im so skinny that I can see my own ribs
FINALLY U UNDERSTAND MY PAIN IM 25 KG
Haha 😂
Yeah right you killed those dances
My best friend Art Frietag was skinny like that and when we were teenagers i told him Dude you're gonna slip through your butthole and hang yourself if you don't gain some weight.
ALL OF THIS HAPPENS WITH ME AHHH FUN TO HEAR THE PAIN
Im skinny and i can dance i get easily cold and it makes me suffer
I related to everything you said expect that Dancing. Dude!! i'm walking like i'm dancing. I never stood normally 😂
Onlyjayus: "I can't dance!"  I feel that 😂
This bastard's so skinny I used to think he's (well, she but anyways) a guy with light voice
I started working out my skinny ass when I found out college lecture hall seats were so damn flat it hurt BAD
The dancing cracks me up every time
Man i am the same and the coments I get hurt me :(
Ok and how not to be?
I agree with this

I can't wait to see the I shoot 4 fun edits with the dancing bit
People can be so unwelcoming and straight up rude.....I think your perfect the way your are.
Your dance is pretty cool actually😄
Also skinny, can confirm dancing is definitely related.
I can't gain weight I have been 65 lbs Sice i was 8 I'm 14
Lol that's true
No fat no jiggle physics...lmfao you're still hawt so you got that going for you
Squat and eat a lot.
Sameeeee man lol
You know what, I’m pretty sure you would give the best fking wedding toasts for some reason🤣
I’m skinny but unless it’s under 32 degrees I’m not wearing a winter coat Bc it’s too hot
I mean really. The trash language not at all cool  , or necessary.
"Skinny people problems." The most tone stupid post I've seen in a while.
I’m skinny af and I’m a dancer lol
Fat people punching the air rn
As someone with the exact oppsosit problem poking new holes in a belt always feels great, congrats on the weight! Lets do our best to continue achieveing our goals
girl i am 6.1 ft 16 yo teen and i am 65 kg
Seriously that dancing 🤣🤣🤣
I’m skinny but can dance
Yes
You dance better then me
Seriously this is so relatable try not to say it because I know other people will always say “you could be fat” but like it sucks😂
lol Gold 😂 I love your lanky boogie!
Im fat and cold
Yeah I can relate. I have some privileges though. I have this one friend who takes to tackling anyone in a ten foot radius, except for me, because she says she doesn’t want to break me.
Same here besides dancing
Bro, I’m skinny and short so I have it all these problems plus short people problems
You can definitely dance don’t worry about that
I feel ya. I’ve been working out every day for like 2 months, I’m 5’10 and I’m still only 115 pounds😂
That last dance 😂🤣💀👀
The cold one is true and I live in the ✨uk✨ so it sucks 👍🥲
Talking Facts
i go through every one of these. When my own Grandma pulls my wife to the side and legit asks if she is feeding me....dude.  :(
i am confused now man, are you a girl biologically by birth? It's not hate, anyway you look amazing!
My mother used to tell me that skinny people had some kind of involuntary attraction to heavy people because they were skinny
Her dance literally made my day😁😁😁
I grew up fat. I think I rather have grown up skinny than fat.
“Eat a burger”  Thats it.   I have dealt with that comment my WHOLE LIFE.   “You don’t have to be skinny to impress people y’know”  “You NEED to eat something”  “Steer clear, shes just a dumb, blue eyed, skinny popular blondie who only cares about her body image.” ( trust me I heard something whispering that)  Im not a dumb blonde! I cant help my looks and weight!   HELP MEEEEEEEEE!!!!
This is so damn true😭😭😭    Specially the comments people make I hate them
As a member of the fat@ss community: **** you. Just **** you.
OH U CAN DANCE BEAUTIFULLY 💃
😭i felt this. only thing is i’m not skinny. i guess we all suffer the same way my ppl
Id trade for those problems In a minute   Atleast you don't have to worry about finding a chair that fits you or breaking one Or picking a car by if the seat belt fits or not . Holes in belts , having to order belts and clothes online cause no one has your size on the shelf . Sorry for the rant . Love your videos
THE BELT ONE THOUGH. It's so true😭 like I always wear those belts with holes all around just so the belt will fit.
It surprises me how down to earth and relatable you are, because of how beautiful you are. Big fan of yours.
I do get the bruises. And the belt one was amazing.
Wow i cant watch u with the same respect anymore when i saw your controversial videos…🤦‍♀️
I don't think the dance thing is a skinny ppl problem I can't dance for shit but I get told I'm fat almost everyday
What you talking about you dance better then me
Your dancing beautiful
“Comforts you”
At first I thought u were a boy
Get a big man you'll be warm all year
for me it used to be- geez do u even eat? or, omg ur so skinny now its- you need to work off that food other wise ur gonna get fat, or how much have been eating?
Oh well it must suck…HAVING SOMETHING ALOT OF PEOPLE WANT! (Jk) no offense
Facts
....dance seems legit
Best dance moves ever 😌
please stop swaring
Mmm…expect being fat is being associated with being ugly and stupid. Try being told that trifecta for two decades on repeat. Put on a sweater and take dance class. My heart bleeds for you and your ability to find clothing that fits you on a regular basis.
I hear you. And when strangers ask you why aren't you eating? And buying undies in the kids department....🙈
Start lifting sweetheart.  You put on weight.
No
I NO RIGHT
I think the can't Dancing thing is more of a rhythm thing rather than a skinny person thing.
Also for the things peopel say I can relate I remember one time I was on vacation I was liek 11 I think and I had just eaten dinner I had literally had a burger then we went to go do a ropes course thing and the guy that was putting the harness on me was like “wow you skinny you need to get some meat on your bones go get a burger” he meant it as joke I think but it stille was annoying
I can relate to all this except the being. Cold part
Playing into the Society comments. TW: ED  "Are you anorexic?" "Do you have an ED?"  No. I have a low appitete due to my coffee addiction and a high metabolism.
Can’t dance that’s on you I can and super under wait
It's soo true that my weight is is less
I hate that wrist thing people do, it irritates me
All of these are true except for dance bc I am skinny and a dancer so
You've got some real problems. I don't know a situation where a boy skinny or not should be wearing a bikini.
Ah thats why you move around  so much  .. avoiding pressure ulcers xD
Dude, you literally can dance.
people said they're afraid of hugging me because they think they might break me in two 🤡
How is being bad at dancing related to being skinny?
Go eat a burger😂😂 same
Fuckin relatable
THAT’S SO FUCKING ME 💀
Same same gurl only just put weight on this year
add to it , being unable to complain about the difficulty of gaining weight  because people just think ur being ridiculous because very few people can relate,  just like I can't get fat joks because I can't relate.
I’m like 180 lbs and I go through all of these problems except the bruised ribs
How you managed to get better body?, please reply, I want to get rid of skinny body.
I am a boy and some fat dude, one of my toxic relatives, really just came up to me and said- your hands looks like a girls hand,don't you eat? Like literally I was trying to avoid him because I knew he do talk shit about my weight
Anyone else try not to laugh at the last part, and ITS 3 AM?
I have that exact same blanket. and i used to be skinny and this is so relatable
Dancing might just be u
I’m the same
oop so true
I also have allergies so it makes it worse
They told me I looked like a stick
I agree
This is me and it's so true this video is amazing
Ass bones hurt --> lean back in your chair --> lower back pain
You're so amazing just the way you are ❤️
True story bro
Give her a samich.
I was dying of laughter when the dancing started (no hate )
Not to sound like a creep but seeing you dance, made me fall in love for a second.
I hate it when people say “you just don’t weigh a lot bc your body is blessed” like yeah bitch. It is :)
That's why I only wear leggings and skinny jeans 🥲
Someone tell this dude to shut up please.
No my trousers are falling down because I've lost weight to quick
Remember the thinner you are the longer you live
Your still so goddamn beautiful
I used to be so skinny you could see my ribs but now I’m a little on the chubby side lol. Trying to lose some weight and honestly been doing good :) wish I was naturally skinny tho.
The fifth onr is sccurate af not gon cap
Girl same I can’t dance either
I am skinny myself so I understand
100% true for everything always been skinny. I love my bony butt
6.67 poud hahahhahahaha
My friend would always tell me that I was gross skinny.. I was also so self conscious about my hip dips growing up. People are so much more likely to avoid bringing up a fat persons weight than a skinny persons but in reality it’s fucked up to mention anyone’s weight ever
Please girl try to stop cussing so much.   Plz
Oh my same with me
I'm actually *not* the skinniest in my class, but I'm the only one who's asked "do you even eat?" Like bruh- ofc I don't  (i actually do eat, but I have eating disorder and I sometimes don't eat for days, or I eat too much)
Literally me
Need a 10 hour version of the dance.
Like i am really really skinny even when i am eating whole a** day i am still skinny and the comments i got are like 🥲 dont u eat doesn’t your parents give u food if i blow you are gonna blew away just like that u are like a stick i can break u in 2  and i am like common do it 🙄 but i hate when people say to me like does ur mom eat your food too bec my mom is bit healthier that doesn’t mean she eats my food 🙄🙄
I have all these problems
Can't dance has nothing to do with being skinny ppl problems it's a personal problem 🤣
Yeah not knowing how to dance is something that happens to everyone
Well at least I'm not alone
Don't want to sound rude but what is your height cause u look really tall in videos
Ok I’ve been skinny all my life too. These are all true especially the ribs getting bruised is SO true. And the dance one. I literally have been dancing all my life😭
I think the fact that you can't dance actually has nothing to do with your weight. You just can't dance 😂
Ahhhahahahh YES YES YES!
You really can't, but you own it.
I feel the same
I too have been super skinny my whole life. Except I can dance 😜
I used to get called 'skinny bones' when was I was a kid.
She's still fine as hell
Same
*Dances* A+
Lol same
she: you cant dance  also she : *Dances*
Just drop molly and you won’t stop dancing
Everyone I've ever met has said those things to me...
Skinny is good! Don’t listen to others.
I have an addition to the hurting ass when you sit for too long So I’m quite skinny like Jayus and you would never want to lay on my shoulder because its bony and if you lay a bit closer to my neck, you get my very protruding collarbone which really hurts to lay on…I’m not a comfortable pillow
I want to swap food journals with this person for a month soo badly and see what happens 🤣
I’m reallyyyyyyyy skinny and can dance
Ok finally some said it my mom is worried for because I'm skinny  I'm literally can't even where a belt 😂
Finally someone talking about the ass bones hurting !! Of course your ass will hurt at any weight if you sit too long, but the bones hurting is really different. I only realized this after going from 60kg to 43kg 😢😔
No one can sit on your lap because you're "too bony" to sit on... 😭
Sometimes I forget you’re a girl
Okay
Always
Not to mention elbowing your hip bone🙄
Aaa with the clothes thing the length for my pants is fine BUT THE WAIST PART aaa it’s to big!!!
Omg I went to see my gramma and she said “ what happend do ur fat” Then the next week it was super windy and we were in the middle of a storm and my friend said” hold her down or she’ll fly away”
The dancing made my day.
Have the same problem
i’m skinny too. i’m built the same way my gram is (tall and skinny) and she had the NERVE to say i need to eat more
Go eat a burger” at least we us followers/subscribers can buy one unlike you 😎 (bur bur bur!!!!)
You are so awesome. And oddly attractive :)
The last one is just your fault.. 😂😂
Thanks to God I've got big round ass so sitting long doesn't really hurts.
She's dancing just fine
Please dont take my comment wrong or rude i am just curious is that person a she or a he . I am really sorry but dont get offended i didnt mean to act rude or a racist or something its just that i have been watching her or his video for a long time and i thought that she or he was a girl but i was not really sure . Can someone please tell me
Ohhhhh got your super skinny aww your cold wtf. Yeha worst comments. And no its fucking not god your pathetic  please eat sleeping pills
Your 60 Lbs??
You can dance 💃  If you need inspo go see kpop idols they are  forced to diet and be a bit underweight and they dance!! So, so can you!  [This is not meant to be hate or shame towards kpop idols at all]
This is right
I can't dance either
Being skinny is hard
Now don't tell me u are a Girl
dances like Bambie on ice 😃
The sitting down one is especially true. And I'm always cold.
I'm not skinny now but as a kid, I was freaking boney and I remember my grandma always had to help me poke holes into the belt.
Nah, you can dance
Oh my I experienced all of this. I cried when I eat because I forced myself to get weight. People kept saying I sgould eat
Teach!
Lalisa watching her video be like:- .......
Question🙋 y r on the washbasin 😐
You are very beautiful!
Learn how to dance then.  I can cut the rug as a fat guy better than all my thin friends.  I can waltz, tango, crunk, you name it.  Except like ballet and stuff.  My ankles will crumble.
I eat ficking a lot but amm.... I still skinny😐
Same
This is like so relatable like whenever I show my family, friends, relatives my k-pop dances they're like why don't you complete the steps I'm like bruh I'm skinny so my dance doesn't look good why don't you understand that!
Don't eat burgers. Eat some dope ass cake.
You need more room, to dance.
Oh I feel your paaaain 🙌🙌🙌🙌
I never thought about this because I am considered overweight but the best thing to do is find out what a healthy weight is for your age so you can stay within that stone
On point and watch’s don’t fit for me at least before you are a teenager
I hate the eating comments. Like geez thanks. Did I ask to not be able to eat a lot and then feel hungry because of it? I most certainly did not! Would you like me to eat more and proceed to throw up cause I feel incredibly sick?
BRUH YOU CAN DANCE JUST FINE
Bro people would always do that thing where people would do this 👌🏽 around my arm and make fun of me bc of it. Like bro I have a fast metabolism it's not my fault im a stick😭
her style so good
The comments suck from people about being god damn skinny, SHIT
Shut up ur cute asf
Bella are you stalking me…
I would warm your heart.
So true
I feel bad now for my friend me and my sister said he looks like he has no water 💀
The can't dance thing may be because you're white.
"Skinny people can't dance" me:  I think you talking about yourself
i agree with 1,3,and 4 100000000000000000%
Ya dance better then me :p
Finally no one ever talks about these tho my biggest pet peeve is when you sit on a chair and your back is against wood or whatever the heck chairs are made of at. At least it helps with posture
Love your videos, and I'm also skinny 40 years old I have a 14 year old kid and I'm 100lbs and I can relate completely specially about seating.
i totally agree with what you’re saying… and your dance moves are so 🤩 lol!!! total inspo
Everybody::watching video  Me::OMG IM WEAR THE SAME SHOES AHHH
I can’t dance ether .
How tall r u? Like 66 but looks skinny :') I'm 70 but looks fat as fck
I'm not skinny anymore but I'm telling anyone out there that is and doesn't like it.  Enjoy it because it's seriously sexy and only reason people say negative things is their so dam jealous. I soon miss being thin.
I'm skinny I relate to this
OMG samee
LOL Good video, sadly or luckily I cannot relate. I have never been that skinny, not even during a disease.  The thinnest I have been was during a stressful time: 132 pounds, and it was the ideal weight for me. After the stress went away, my weight went back to 154-160 pounds (goes back and forth during the year) Fatty, but not obese, also stress free, warm and with enough meat to sit in a chair without pain XD
Omg I have the exact same problem😕
I think she’s super attractive
I have skinny friends and they tell me the same problem with the chair. They hate chairs :))
THIS IS SO FUCKING RELATABLE I CAN'T
The belt part is so freakin relatable🤏🥺💅
I'm a slender tender and as a toddler, no belt in existence fit my bottle sized waste, so in order to compensate, my beloved parents bought a pair of ruler suspenders...looked like the dog on the "ants in my pants" board game.
Once i get flew by a wind….           I only weight 45kg…
Im fat af so don’t be mad that your skinny
Im not skinny but my hips r so huge that if I lie down it hurts so bad
Is anyone going to talk about her dance moves
Dancing be on point 😹
Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels
This is so accurate 😅
I eat WAY too much for how much of a stick I am ;-;
Trust me, you just need to eat MORE. Your stomach will adjust. Just eat good things, but always eat enough for a healthy weight
IM VEGAN AND I SKINNY AS ####
I’m a twiggy
You look awesome
The sitting ones is the the worst
I feel you
Same
I got all these problems except the dancing part
Also you have to use a scale to check how much u eat
pros of being chubby lmaoo
This is so true for me but yet funny 💀
But your clothes keep fitting you
I'm skinny so I understand
You understand me ❤️🥲
Lol I’ve been WAY too under weight and what ever I do I can’t gain weight and all of this stuff is super relatable it Hurts to sit bc my butt will start hurting even if I have like 10 pillows. It’s also rly hard to get comfy when I try to go to sleep so I don’t get much rest. I also get judged a lot and ppl ask “how has the wind not blown u away yet”? Like I get it I’m 14 and I’m 68 pounds but I Can’t gain weight!!!!
I think dancing is just a you problom
She is kinda toxic to herself
I'm skinny but somehow I don't need a belt
I am ugly what a disgrace
I am skinny so I Ralte but a can dance
I think the dancing problem is just yours
Me when she started dancing 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😄😄😂😂😂
DUDE THIS !!!!!
"I can't dance"  FINALLY I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CANT LIKE ME , MY WHOLE SCHOOL CAN 😭
So true girl. #same #skinny #ilovefood
"I've been skinny af" *talks about how crappy it was*  Me, who's at that weight and recenrly okayish with my body: "Welp."
😭i relate
WHY IS THIS ALL SO FUCKING RELATABLE
Stick to the one two step plss and you amazing women!
I can tell that aswell beside that cold thing i'm just sweat so easily and love it cold xD
Yesssss!!!
Im walking stick i can relate
Why are you me
Lol I'm 13 and really short I'm like 4'9 and I am just 75 lbs because my metabolism is so fast... And no I am short and skinny but I look better than you think lol
I CANT DANCE TOOOOO
The society one where they tell you to eat more. if you're even slightly overweight or just a healthy weight, people tell you to eat less or better and exercise more and stuff. Beauty standards are fucked.
I can relate to 1,2,3, and 6
Poking new holes in the belt hit the hardest
Dances better than me
I've been body shamed for how skinny I am since I was in school, I can relate to all of this so much- lol
I have the same problems and its so fucking annoying
Oh my god yessssss!
I can relate to this so much because I am also a skinny person and no one talks about being skinny and just make fun of skinny people
HOW DO YOU DANCE SO GOOD. TEACH ME!!!!
That not dancing that's her having a heart attack no offense ❤️ your vids
AND EVERYONE SAYS, “omg your so boney.” AND ITS SO ANNOYING 😤
The best part people thinks it ok to say you need to eat your to skinny but it's mean to say you're fat and need to stop eating
Stop Swearing
Lucky you don't have diabetes and are a little overweight
See, I’m 12 & skinny af!! She gets it, tho!! Also, both my sides are Caribbean! Y think I don’t eat, breathe & drink meat?! 🤣 so literally everything I’m dealing w. I’m 84 pounds! At age 12!
Girl your dancing’s better than mine😂
I can say in definitely skinny and agree with you 100%
How tall are you ?
Lucky I love long clothes
You forgot the worst part: if your body is long and lanky like mine and hers, you’re either born with an insane amount of grace and beauty, or you trip over your own feet every five seconds and are constantly covered in bruises that you can’t remember how you got. I personally happen to be the latter…
For me it’s that I would see my ribs so I would be super uncomfortable wearing swimsuits
TAHT ONLY 66 POUNDS EVEN I WAY MORE
You can dance!😎
I model so I have  expectations to be real skinny 😃
But its better than being to fat      Radical feminists: BODY SHAMER
I'm a super picky eater.
I can relate to the one about the belt. It's annoying!
“Break in half in the wind”!!!!!💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
You need about Fcking 3500calories per day weeeeeh
Those are some cool moves Bella
Good thing i know this now cuz it makes me feel better about the fact that I'm overweight but not that much.
YESSSSSS
Are you a girl
As a skinny person that can dance, I would like to inform you that I am superior
So True 😂
Im 66.2 kgs and people think im skinny I feel like I'm chubby as I got a chubby ztonzch
Funny as hell 🤣
i can relate so much to all of this :')
I am skinny and people are like do you eat and I’m like and my friend is like ya but she doesn’t eat breakfast and I get so mad because I don’t have a big stomach like other people.
Really relatable
I literally olmost fell during shcool cause the wind was blowing
I am the same way
I dealt with this alot when I was younger, but I joined the Army and I fixed it
No way thats why my ass hurts im 280 now but 5 inches taller than you lol
I remember in 4th grade a bunch of girls walked up to me and said “hey… do your parents feed you?”  Here’s how it went:  “Do your parents feed you?” *uhh- yea* “But.. your so thin, like I can fit my hand around your arm” -yanks arm back- *uhm… ok.* -walked away-
I'm. Fat. But.  In.     Mizo. We. Don't.   Fatshame.   Because. We. Are. Christan.  But. Used. Get. Teased. Alot. In. School. Because.  I. Have. Anger. Issue
I used to be chubbier as a child don’t come at me I’m from a big family and would never discriminate but I would constantly get criticised of of my mum for not being the perfect daughter and being very skinny like she wished it got to the point where I developed an earring disorder now I’m skin and bones and my mum still criticises me
I would believe everything except for not being able to dance. Shit was  fire 🔥
Ik skinny too 64kg and im 5 foot 9
“And then there’s chunky” I’m not dead I’m literally commenting I’m here I’m C H O N K
I know no one's asking, but your pic in the beach looks really nice.
I'm currently 6'5 (195 cm) and 115 kg.  I used to be 70kg and legit looked like a skeleton.
Sooo true
her: so idk if you've noticed but I've been skinny af my hole life.    me:lucky 😔😫😭🤧🍀
U dance better the me
I'm the same
Thank you! I’ve had all these situations. Sone people even ask me why I’m skinny. Like what!
My nickname is baguette because I’m so skinny and tall
You know, ether way people bully girls “oH yOuR tO fAt” and if you lose wait they go “dO yOu EvEn EaT?”
I can relate to all
Lol I was the same weight kindergarten - fourth maybe fifth grade.
My grandfather is so skinny that his skin has the shape of his rib bones. It's no joke it's very true.
Facts
People are like eat more. Well I’m sorry my  metabolism is like go to go fast
Nah nah I'm mf skinny but I actually have rhythm ( tryna not be offensive )
This is true I am skinny.everyone in my family calls me a stick but I really don’t mind
“Just put some new holes in it” My mother’s fav dialogue
What u talking about u can dance like a lady (a 90 yo lady   Edit: no seriously tho u can dance better than me
Well that explains why my friends were so cold when I was warm af
The 3th and 4th  one was my favorite
Welp i can relate until u said u cant dance🤧😅😇😇
"You can't dance." Ballerinas: *Hold your belt.*
Bro we are basiclly living skeletons
I can get u thick Jay, you're awesome love
Omg people call me skinny especially my mom anyways, when I was in fourth grade I was in my homeroom and I was getting ready to go to my second period while I was opening the door I also flew with the wind so if anybody ask me what the craziest thing that happened to u I tell them this story.
Dude im a kid and people still say that to me
6 ft 2 and 135 lbs as a 25 year old guy
This is so true I hate that people always comment
Same here
SAME MF?!?!Me to😭😢🥺
I don't know why people try to be skinny I speak from experience when I say it hurts. Ouch.
Why are people complaining about being skinny, it’s much worse to be called fat than skinny.
Me too
Same for all of them-
Hahahahahahah the last dance is wat got me laughing🤣🤣🤣😂
She should have tried to do the worm or the robot
Also for fat people sitting down will hurt after a while
Your dancing was a A+
Can dance better then me
You look like you just came from the holocaust.
I think it is better ten be too vat
I mean her dance moves woooaaahhhhh. I'm a fan ☺️☺️☺️
So true
I didnt know that seeing jay dance like an idiot, is excactly what i needed🤣
Your still cool
I was the opposite as a kid. I was around 100lbs in the first grade & was close to 5 ft tall. I had people asking me if I failed the 1st grade and was retaking it, so I had to explain that I was just husky 🙄
Bro Ik how you feel
Bro this is actual facts
I am skinny and this is true true true true
SAME
These all happen to me except the bruises
Same
I handle all these problems all the time
Skinny person here!
So true
I have the same thing except the belt problem 😐😐😐
I relate to that cos I'm really skinny and I relate to all of these
I AGREE TO EACH
Dem dance moves lol
Jayus: I can’t dance! Me: me neither. Me. Neither.
I just died when she started “dancing” 🤣
i once told my friend “brb i have dinner” and they asked “wait you eat?”
I love ur dancing
Hey but at least your tall
Lol that dancing thoughhhhh
Dont worry the good thing about being skine is are bones can bend down all the way
Jayus:I just got into a healthy weight  Scale:(shows 612)
I am the only FAT friend and I have skinny friends
It's not that your bad at dancing it's just that other people can't dance so they don't want to say it
Lmao I can’t dance either...
Nice dance moves. 🙄🙄
I was going to make fun of your dance skills but umm I can’t dance for sh!t
This entire short is incredibly relatable 😤😂😢
Yea can relate
So true 😂
Go Bella go Bella go Bella
Lol that last part got me
Yeah Jayus get into it lol love the end.
Agree with the rest. But being skinny has nothing to do with the ability to dance.
Me is fat
Finally someone agrees I’m 66 pounds and IT SUCKS
Ok but the sitting down, the gets cold easily are very accurate but the can’t dance is INSANELY accurate
I can confirm this is true
When you were saying that people would tell you like do you ever eat or like go eat a burger all it reminded me of was Captain America the first avenger when someone said get that kid a sandwich since he was extremely skinny
i can relate but she can danceeeee those are good dane moves
She is the best dancer of ever seen
Add fiber to your diet
i finally got to 90 pounds after years of struggling to stay over 80 pounds. i look like i’m at a healthy weight because of all the fat on my body but i’m not i eat so much too. i guarantee i’m gonna go under 80 pounds soon again
I've always been fairly skinny, I hit maturity and started filling out out I got cancer. Back to eternally skinny
You kinda dance better than me so that’s something XD T-T
No white person can dance
OH MY GOD. fr tho- I’ve been severely underweight my whole life, and all of these are soooo true. At 10 yrs old, 43 lbs. but I can dance :)
Me too and I eat sweets alot
Jayus: I can't dance! Me having done dance for yrs: You can still dance better than me  Edit: Thx for the likes!
I'm skinny and like the cold and I don't get sun burnt
Relatableeeeeee  When sitting on a chair without a cushion Im constantly moving cuz it’s so UNCOMFORTABLE
No ur a dancing pro 😎
"i cant dance" and this is why we stan onlyjayus
I grew up with my everyone around me saying "you have to eat or else you'll get blown away by the wind and we'll never see you again" 6 year old me is traumatized
Your right you can't dance
Oh my god, this is to true. And I eat every goddamn second-!
Ahhhh the pants are so true I literally couldn’t wear any jeans until I was 10 because I was a fucking skeleton and I can’t find any belts that are my size
I hate my life Bc of this
lets be honest those dance moves were fire
OMG THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TRUE!!!
When I was 8 I used to think I was fat so I would put my belt on the tightest loop to the point where it would leave marks ,and wouldn't eat until I felt like I was going to pass out ,I wanted to talk Abt that telling a  child ways to lose wait Doesn't help it develops an eating disorder
still better than being fat tho 😢
UNF *i don't cold but I'm canadien so its more of given for me .*
😂😂😂lmao LOL the dance though
Ok this is all facts. My grandma always told me and my sister when we were younger "You need some meat on your bones" and I absolutely hated that. She still says it but I just live with it now.
The fuck you talkin' about? You're literally dancing in this video, and look more fun to dance with than like 90% of dancers...
rather have that then have mine
I’m 12 and am 60 pounds so this is so so true
tfw you're wearing the same pants you had during 7th grade and you're going into college..... ive had the SAME PAIR OF JEANS FOR SIX YEARS AND THEY'RE STILL THE ONLY ONES THAT ACTUALLY FIT RIGHT AND THEY'RE FROM THE KID'S DEPARTMENT
Knowing how skinny i am my friends did not believe how much I ate fun fact I shocked them with all the food i ate and the buffet we went to
So its better to be semi-fat?
And I’m all ways cold
Bruh same I can’t dance
people: she can’t dance  me: ugh rude ppl shes a dancing Queen lol 🥰
Aw yes especially when you’re eating “damn your eating ? God must be coming “
I had a buddy growing up that was 6’7” and a 165lbs. Dude could not for the life of him gain weight. After a night of drinking we go and get some scum dogs (chili dogs) shout out the Louie’s!!! Anyway he ate 21 of them! 21!!!! And an order of fries! Didn’t see him in years and were in our 40’s now. He finally broke 200lbs a few years ago.
But why is this true
Don’t worry jay I’m with you
As a fellow stick figure, can confirm
Same girl same but I can dance
Still can't work out if you are Male or Female.
Fat people in the comments
I know I’m super skinny too
I eat and eat and eat and I gain nothing
my dad works at this place and i was doing compression therapy for my very injured hamstring a few months back. i’m 13 and this creepy ass old man walks in and stares at me. he walks over and starts commenting on how skinny i am- he didn’t talk about anything except my weight. my mom walked in, she works reception there and he walked off and didn’t talk to me unless i was alone.
🕺😩💅
Im really skinny i would say this is 10000000% true
Relateable
Dude I tell people these things and their like no and I'm like who tf is the skinny one who has to deal with this you dont wanna be skinny not like me
Jayus: "Can't dance" Also Jayus:
also it hurts to sit on swings
I can deal with that
I just..omg..this is so accurate 😩
*Ant jiggling my leg * "you need to put some meat on those bones" well maybe it's because I'm 7 Jackie  this same ant made a back story as to where my ass was when. i. was. 8. FUCKING 8
Skinny gang  Sitting down on church benches is pain
Better dance moves than me
This sh*t happens to me 🥲
Holy shit 66 pounds!!!!!!
I cAnT Dance ... proceeds to bust some amazing dance moves
yea being skinny i can  relate to all of these, im am near 13 and i am 4”10 and about 70 pounds, and i feel very insecure about my self and i used to cry to myself because i wanted to gain wait and be like the others, i remember when my friend said that everyone in high school would call me a toothpick and that i dont need exercise because i am perfectly skinny enough, it hurts honestly i mean i know people want to be skinny but they should just be proud of their size (if its not unhealthy or a reason for pills) because honestly some people are forced to be skinny, be proud of who you are, dont body shame people
I feel you im the same ;(
Girl same
Same
Ay ngl I sometimes wish I was as skinny as you 😅 man being overweight sucks
I’m almost twelve and I’m the average weight of a 6 year old and I’m super short to top it off
The dance🤣 I have the same problem
Can confirm lol
The belt and clothes one is a moof
“Can’t dance” Sounds more like a personal problem ngl
Okay, I'm 13, and when my friends tell me, "do you even eat? Go eat something!" Like, wtf you mean!!?? I eat 3 burgers ever time I eat lunch!!! I can't gain weight!!!
Tell me about it
Your butt bones hurting when you sit on a hard surface is so relatable lol
I don't really relate except for most of these
I wanna dance with you , just like you .
5.5 for the dancing
uh yah
yes this is relatable but if you skinny and short you get told every time its hella windy out "oh your gonna fly away Lol"
😂😂😂
That’s how I dance 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😜

Also when u say you need to eat to them they most likely eat a lot so

I'm a 210lbs man and I deal with almost all those problems with the exception of rib bruises
Finally, SOMEONE talked about some of the problems of being rly skinny. THANK YOU
I'm to fat
So true. People think obese people have it bad but skinny people have problems too. I hate that nothing fits me and I get cold so fucking easily. I wear 3 layers and I’m still cold.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is the most relatable short ever
especially when you’re tall as well
SAME!!! My friends bully me for that
as someone who is skinny.. i can relate to all of these. i get cold every 5 seconds- 💀😭
I feel the same
THOSE ARE SKINNY PEOPLE PROBLEMS??? BRO I HAD THOSE PROBLEMS THINKING ITS NORMAL! i-...

So relatable
I am very skinny and everyone seems to want to be skinny and I have all of these problems and I have felt very insecure me whole life and I have tried so hard to gain weight and I just don’t and the comments that I have gotten from people are messed up
Why is this so trueeee
This is so my sister I’m nothing like that
Yep
Same

Beautiful 😍
The dance tho😂
🌈mass gainer 🌈
Umm, I thought you said you couldn't dance?
i can agree
All of these apply for me except for when I lay down instead of getting bruises on my ribs it hurts my chest really bad if I lay down for to long…. and no, no I am not skinny
Your Dancing Is Still Better Then Mine!!!
Yea I've pocked too many holes in my belts
That’s why my cousin can’t dance
Not going to lie that's better dancing than I will ever be able to do
You not being able to dance may just be a you problem
I eat a lot and my body is just like ‘’hmmm lets see lots of food  YOUR GONNA BE SKINY AS HELL BIATCH’’
Just the bloody cutest person ever
Odk those were some nice dance moves
i go through all that crap that people say like "you need to eat something" everyday of my life
You may not be able to dance, but, try the dance that CHAD DOES FROM THE MONSTER HIGH GHOULS RULE MOVIE I STG—
Yea and being fat gives you a way worse time with bullying I don’t see the issues just cause your ass hurts
but being chubbier than all your classmates...
All of them are actually pretty accurate lol
Me and you are almost the same
I’m skinny, small and weak and it is a nightmare. I try to eat a lot of food but I’m still skinny and small.
As a skinny person, I can say this is true.
I’m 5’1 and around 95 lbs and I relate so hard. Except the fact that I’m literally a dancer
Flat like that paper you use to cut like your wrists stfu racist
Sorry Jayus but that dancing looks like the whitest mom
Dancing is not a skinny problem
You played basketball?
relatable
The dance was painful to watch to say the least
but your personality is awesome lol seriously your beautiful you got a cute face n your dance moves cracked me up its not always looks that wins a person over i feel i could vibe with you on a personal level n would have a really good time bein with you now dont get weirded out just letting you know the awesome qualities i see in you cuz i feel you needed to hear them and im very happilly married n would never ever cheat on my wife i hope this made you feel better n you have an awesome day
All of that is me
I honestly want to be her friend jesus
I can relate but im never cold
Good thing tho, you can win hide and seek alot, you can fit in small spaces
I agree with all of these- I have a eating disorder and these things are so annoying-
your still cute
I can confirm
Bro I remember my own father telling me that I'm a toothpick, or telling me to stay in my room when his friends are over so they don't think he doesn't feed me :/
Casually starts video while crouching on a sink
The very last move wins
Yes but i can dance
I'm not super skinny but when I lay on my chest for too long it really hurts my ribs
Used to be skinny. My class mates made fun of me because of that. So,got in to the gym. Now I’m fu*king too bigger than them.😂 Now my presence always makes them feel small.😆
Not ashamed to say it.... id still tap
I wish I had your problems
6 2 n 140 pounds. Accurate
My brother used to try and put me on a only burger diet -_-
Fun fact we also have soft mattresses because of problem #2
BRUH I STILL SKINNY AS F ALSO I HAVE NO FREAKING PANTS TO FREAKING WEAR AND IM COOOOOOOOOLD
My best friend is skinnier than people who have eating disorders ... He doesn't even have a disorder he's just a flat out twig ... A tall twig ... Meanwhile I am mister cubby also because of genetics like I don't eat that bad but I am just fat and I will stay that way until I actually have the time and motivation and money for the gym
Bro when I was 10-11 I had to go to the toddlers section to find me pants that fit😭  Also fun fact: I had to use my sister a 5 year olds belt
No wonder my ass hurts
As a Skinny person, I can say that all of these are true
I can confirm I am very skinny and this is mad facts
Omg- SKINNY BROS
I hate when People call me skinny. I’m 12 and not even 90 pounds. My hip bones show. My ribs are extremely visible. When I run, the skin in between my collar bones suck in. The reason I’m skinny is because, at my step mothers, I was constipated from the un healthy food she fed me. I didn’t eat for less than half of the 9 months I lived there. When people call me skinny, I try not to cry. Please be aware of these situations among other children, because it’s hurtful.
I'm tall and skinny my clothes are too big and too short also I get hungry fast  It sucks🙃
😂my whole god dam life
Wait skinny people broblems wtf
She dance like Michael Jackson
Sub I like her it only took a year 😉🤪
100% relatable. Or asked constantly if you model, being told “I’m jealous” when you have pizza for lunch then simultaneously told “well, YOU need it”, or asked “what’s your secret?”….from strangers….Netflix, desk job, fast food….that’s my secret lol. It’s hard on a kid though you’re so right, like mentally it’s draining. Also my family had a leather punch for my belts(and also other crafty things) but that made me laugh 😂
Same asf
Ur dancing was still better than what ever the fuck I'm doing.
So in conclusion: get fat and be comfortable in chairs
Me to
Those dance moves were bussin though 💃🕺💃🕺
Can agreee!
I have the same problems except dance
this is what i am going there
Shes gonna say the n word
I have a little brother who is like this he is nine years old and he ways 64 pounds
I can’t really tell cause I get called skinny
Oh and I cant dance either :)
Dude this is so relatable. I would get called "skinny" and whata worse is im FRIKIN SHORT!! IM NOT EVEN TALL! And all these facts are true ESPECIALLY THE COLD ONE LIKE AUGHHHH
Omg I know what you mean.
I can relate to all of this😭. I dance like a chicken with its head cut off, and meh feet get to a temp of -1,000 degrees very quickly lol
This is a summary of my life
You were 6 2 before  12
This is me
Thts me
When I’m skinny people make comments about…when I gain weight people make comments….moral of the story who cares what others think bc you are going to have your fat days and your skinny days….and for some reason people feel the need to point it out. 🤷‍♀️
So true
You dance better than anyone in my family
GIRL IM NOT THAT SKINNY I CANT DANCE!!!
This one really hits home
It's true I'm skinny and I can't dance
Sam I'm a twig
Beeing skinny and flat is the most problem you have..
The dancing problem isn’t your weights fault babes 😂😅
Nah your Hella sexy for sure and love your vids 🤘🙌
At least you aren’t fat 😂
Try being fat and see how that feels.
It's so true
Same I'm so skinny
💀🤣🤣💯🤣🤣💯
One of my friends are skinny but he dosen't get cold easily I do and I'm in the middle of skinny and fat at the same time!
Yes! All of these! Also, pants with elastic on the inside, to escape the belt problem xD
I think the last one was a skill issue  All in all, I’m joking, i love watching ur vids
You can call anything a dance
I’ve been told I’m tiny my hold life and I can relate to all of these btw I have been dancing for 10 years
am 9 and i weigh 28 kg
Other than cold that also sounds like my fat people problems
ur dancing is a gift
I'm not fat or skinny and no jeans or trousers fit me and I can't sit down for long :-)
Im not that much over weight but it is so hard to find a belt that will fit me
You can’t dance? I can’t dance without jiggling so being big isn’t any better 😆
you dance better than me
I can confirm all of these as an extremely skinny person
Laying on your back on the ground and your pelvis pinches your skin. Lol
Yo she is right I sit down for 5 min and ima already done with it and the belt I've done that to many times😂😂
Those dance moves were too good 😌😌😌
I can relate and for me Even if I eat tons of fatty foods, nope no weight gain
Lol
Thats my life right there
I’m just like you
IKR
Are you 💅🏳️‍🌈
I don't think 6 is because your skinny
Literally, I know what you're talking about.
I can relate with all of these facts
OMGOSH FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS
I feel you gurl
"I can't dance" K-pop idols: 👁️👄👁️
The principal would even make comments about it
I have the same problem and the comments are the worst
I understand
Wit your a girl ??????
Facts
What r u talking Abt u can dance like a drunk danceing boss
It’s crazy, the skinny people want to be bigger and the fat people want to be really skinny.
Bruh I feel your pain
I'm heavier than you I'm 13
You are a very skinny boy.
I can relate to all of these except for getting cold (propably because i'm Finnish and can't afford to get cold :D) and the belt thing since i started using jeans only a couple years ago and i have a belt that doesn't haven any holes
*me who wants to be skinny* This really happen? ill stay being warm :>
Ur watch sliding down ur wrist
Last one is probably a lie
Pretty solid moves tho.
𝙈𝙚 𝙩𝙤𝙤
Girl I'm 6 ft 6 my body shape is shaped as a pair with toothpick arms and toothpick legs my mom always thinks my legs are broke off
So take this video and multiply it times 10 for people that are overweight especially the society part.
That’s facts
Dancing has to do with being skinny??????
The wind thing is true I only way 50 Poland I'm 12
Yeah, the dancing is not on being skinny 😂
Can’t dance is a user error
Dude the same for me 😂😂😂
As a very skiny boy i can relate
I think the dancing is another reason 😳🙄
Better then me 😄
i think the dancing this is just you tho
I was like this when I was younger and I had so many brusies. I LOOKED ANESTHETIC
65kgs is a healthy weight ? Nice.
The first too were so relatable
You dance better than me! Yay! 😂
I experience all these problems
I have the same problem. Work hard all week to get 1 pund, take a shit loss 3 pund but I am always hot so I hate summer love winter.
0:41
I have never related to something so much plus I’m 6’3 at 14 so that makes thing a little worse
Ha same
I got the same problems
That belt thing spit out facts lol
I wish I was skinny because I can't wear tops or bikinis at all I force myself to wear jackets and hoodies or oversized shirts
I know some skinny people and I don't do 5 because I have a soul
You can dance, just not well.
You are very  pretty and funny
I hate doing hip hop dances bc I look so wRird
I think- i think the dancing part is natural and also I can relate, I hate when my aunt says that im skinny like DUH I know that
So relatable
Yo i literally have a video of me dancing to that song when I was a kid
That's me and my dad... yeahhhh... we can't get big... I eat more than my brother... and that's a lot
Yeah
Your pretty tho
I've also been like you but I am like exactly now gaining weight and it's actually good because when I was 8 I was probably like 40 pounds which is bad I think I don't know but I don't think that's for an average 8-year-old but that's when I was eight now I am 70 something pounds
Skinny facts tho dancing sucks
Believe i know the struggle is real
I am skinny and this relates so much to me! Especially the belt and when my butt hurts from sitting too long 😩  Edit: Thanks for all the likes! Every like means lots to me. 👍❤️
I-
Yep
Girl you can’t dance not cuz your skinny it’s cuz your onlyjayus and onlyjayus is bad at dancing
Still can't dance-
She also can’t go without using racial slurs-
I know them
its annoying to be skinny
The pants thing is so relatable
Girl I know how u feel why people r so noisey chill WE EAT 😞
♤I just wear a weaved belt so I dont have to poke any new holes I can just put it through the weave and I wont damage it. It also looks way prettier♤
The can’t dance is because she is white and I know
And racist
i'd know i weigh 32kg
I kinda like the way you dance thou XD
As a thin ass male I can agree to that, except I'm fucking fire on the dancefloor
I can't either
Imo, being skinny is better than being fat
The balls of my wrist bones show 24/7
Plz don’t dance in front of people they are gonna be scared im so sorry im telling that cuz i was same you so dame skinny but now i am fat as f**ck
SO TRUE 😅
You wouldnt be skinny in my family
Ngl i can relate to this especially the u need to get meat on ur bones mate & the   holes in the belt
I no how you feel 😅
being skinny is the reason why I (almost) always wear hoodies or anything with long and loose sleeves even if it's a boiling hot day, cause it covers up my bony and hairy arms.
WTF what was that dance
The truest thing today
This shit happens to me and on top of that im short 😭 :]
True that!!!
Why is this so realetable like-
SAME AS YOU
As a 13 year old teen that looks like a kindergarden stick, I agree with everything except the last one I am a professional malayan dance
I want to be skinny like you when I grow up
My mum is scared to life I'm gonna die I'm that skinny
the 5th one is WAY too accurate for me lol
I was always a chubby kid but when I slimmed down in my early 20s my family started accusing me of being a crackhead:)
Today I can officialy say that im proud of being a fatass
I have the same problem, I'm 14 and barely weigh 90 pounds.
I am a skinny people and all that is true
👁👄👁  Same
As a skinny person I can relat
As a skinny akwerded teenage boy I can relate
And yet it still hurts To sit down and lay down for too long
The only fat I have on my body is my thighs and my stomach
I used to have to poke holes into my belt... but I got one of those belts with holes all around it (Totally recommend)
That makes sense because I always sweat on my back after going in side from recess because I’m 131 pounds 😬
Eat alot of Food maybe idk
Hey its better then being fat
Bro why can I relate to this so much.
All of those are completely accurate 😅
I have those problems...but the opposite
I mean like the pants and belt thing applies to me sort of it's like oh your pants don't go up any farther than your thighs, that sucks get a bigger size, oh that's too big so put on your belt, oh wait that's too small too so then you got to go back to the store and get a new belt.
Relatable
Same
1. I see nothing wrong with being skinny. 2. Can't dance is a white person thing not a skinny person thing. I would know. And to all white people who can dance well. Congrats. You have actual skill.
I am mix of fat and skinny I have a lot of stomach Fat and skinny arms and legs
YES I FEEL YOUR PAIN
Toothpick gang like if ur in with me
I aggre
I'm the same way
Feel this hard
Yeh I'm like that I'm 13, shortest in the school in year 8 only 140cm, so skinny
Same
the reason your ass hurts is because you don't sit enough although it can be genetic if you sit for long periods of time throughout your life it will make your ass bigger im a male and it's exactly why i can sit for 6 hours a day EDIT: the reason your ass gets bigger is because it gets more fat from long periods of sitting
Same and l am 10 wearing a 5 year old s belt and it is huge
Same
“I can’t dance.” Yet proceeds to dance epiclly.
My wife looked like you, then she had our first son and now is about to have our second son and she's gained some weight and she looks even better than before she got pregnant
Thank you jayus your dancing made my day
dude i identified a lot with this video like i was always thin (at least from age 5 i think?) and even if i stay at a healthy weight i still appear to be so fucking thin  And I have an accelerated metabolism- so it's very complicated to gain weight :'/
Same here
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh I have the same problem
Slay
The dance moves🤣🤣
Lol yea it super annoying
Aren’t you like really tall thi
I can’t dance worth shit either
I'll have slightly cold water and be freezing the rest of the day
Being over weight is also bad but as bad as skinnines because mist people can shrung of the extra weight easily
This is so true I am skinny like an stick if it's hot as the fa#@ing sun I will be in my room without a fan on and in my thick blanket and just stay there
It's true. My mom and other people everyday say: You need to eat more.  Me: I CAN'T GAIN WAIGHT EVEN IF I EAT MUCH.
It is nice to be skinny
FINALLY some one talks about that sitting for too long makes ass bones really heart ..like ......I can relate to too many of what she said
Wait? What was that weight?
I can not dance ether
You cant dance for other reasons jk
I miss being skinny. Now everything is soar all the time and I'm a fat piece of shit
I can really relate to the ass bone one, im not REALLY skinny but im pretty skinny
As a teen right now, it really hurts my feelings when people make fun of my small size
I do agree like I’m 12 and I’m 80 pounds and like my eating disorder isn’t helping
Sitting on hard chairs is the worst
Your dancing is gorgeous 😂
This is so true
dude my dog ways more than I do that just shows how skinny I am but my stomach is a bottomless pit
Look, I personally do not have that Skinny person body type if that makes sense, BUT I still struggle with these problems, because I put it upon myself by buying big clothing, long belts, staying in cold places and giving up on dancing and only doing fortnite dances when asked.
Now i know the reason why i get cold so fast
I can confirm this as a skinny person, I've been said that I'm bad at dancing and my family always says "YOUR SO SKINNY", "EAT MORE". Like that is kinda harsh to me because I'm a kid and already getting body-shamed.
I'd rather be skinny then the 30lbs overweight that I am.
As a skinny person, literally everywhere I go someone be like "Go eat some meat" ouch.
So true I'm actually skinny so I know how does it feel
I feel that I've had all those problems all my life and still do I actually wear one of those seatbelt type belts where there are no loops and you just pull the strap thru the buckle and tighten it
Can't dance is not just skinny people I can't dance
Brother this happens to me
As a fat person. I'd rather deal with those issues than stay like this. Lmfao
HOW R YOU BETTER THAN ME AT DANCING
I'm skinny it happens to me so annoying when friends make fun of it
U should probably go and work out how to dance
What am I seeing
Literally my whole life story
You telling me butt bone pain ISNT normal?
Atleast you're tall
As an overweight person with very skinny friends we can confirm
I am 6 ft and fatty and I look like a tyrant from resident evil . So I am trying to become skinny .
I can relate ENTIRELY ✊😔
Coming from a Hispanic family….. all of my skinny boy insecurities were flamed on the spot growing up
You are perfect just the way you are and yeah society can fuck off society is a bitch and there's nothing you or anyone can do about it but all you have to do is work your was around it and ignore the people that will say that shit. Thank you for your time❤
Achievement  unlocked: New type of skinny stick
I been said a lot people be saying do you eat like,and my belts don't fit either and I'm a kid
I'm kinda fat can't relate. I've been scrolling forever
The dancing is just you I can dance just fine
Bruhhh so accurate
But peoples comments were the words. My parents call me a noodle
I have eaten an ENTIRE JUG OF CHEESEBALLS and LOST 5 pounds
The good news is you are good at hide n seek.1 At least for me I'm a skinny tiny person.caugh caught the shortest in my class
Alert alert skinny person dancing
I'm a skinny person but I'm a dancer. But literally everything else is true
as a skinny person who is constantly cold yes
As a fat person I can’t walk in my own home normally without fucking shaking nearby chairs or tables
She also can not stop being racist
I HAVE A THING WERE I DON'T SHOW MY WEIGHT AND MY NANA SAYS "you need to eat eat more" LIKE NO NANA YOU EAT LESS FAT BI$H
“I’m  afraid your gonna break apart in the wind”   My friends earlier today: “bro the winds gonna be going at 60 miles! “ “Woah!” “Yeah and you are going to get carried away by it. You’ll probably end up in a tree.”  “T-T”
I don't feel skinny but I look skinny
You sure that last one was cause of your weight?
Hahahahahahahaha hahaha  "I can't dance"
Me sista is skinny she be havin probs with her hips
THIS IS SO RELATIBLW!!
Yeah, same
As a skinny person I can disagree. I am ALMOST ALWAYS warm
OK dance and I’m skinny I think that’s just a you problem
Im 12 and I weigh 60 pounds
I wish I was skinny
Bruh im skinner than ypu so theae problems are even more relatable XD

All confirmed I agree,except the dancing you ain't feeling the Groove get some funk. Practice. It's okay it a common problem for white ppl.
I didn't know skinny people problems involving calling someone a n word (hard r btw) lover
Yes. I am skinny (basically smaller than a text book, I wish I was kidding) and well.....I felt all these. I'm tiny and I hate it. I have people who be jealous. Like, I'll take some more meat/muscle just to not be cold all the time!
you ...CANT DANCE yo what....
With peace and love, your lack of rhythm isn't a skinny problem. Its a you problem.  🤣
i no longer have a need to make new belt holes
Can't tell if male or female but if male Jesus dude I'm 10 and I weigh 80 pounds dude.

You dance way better than I do, my dances are twirls and awkward shimmies ( ._. )
Right
You
Why
You probably have the most wholesome personality.
Those dance moves were lit AF!
I have a friend that is 65 pounds in 7th grade
Wait my friend is like a skeleton and he doesn’t get COLD, he could be in alaska with no clothing and he would never get cold
Yea i agree i cant even do push ups
Most of these are FACTS
Ya know there is an EZ way to help you increase body mass. 🤔😏🙃🙂
I agree. And also you have back problems to like me because I’ve been skinny and tall for my entire life
my problem is literally the opposite
I can confirm this is all true especially the society one please stop telling me I need meat on my bones 😭
I have the same problem so I only where baggy clothes
Same it's horrible 🥲
This is true, I feel your hurt fam
I'm 11 and 68 pounds
i have these problems 😭
If I saw you dancing in my room I would scream
Relatable
Just be healthy, an try to be happy 😃
Me thinking I can't dance    BUT THEY JAYUS OVER HERE
OH MY GAWWWWWWWWWWWDDDDAAAAAAA   THIS VIDEO RIGHT HERE GUYS
Eat a Burger 🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
Ngl u dance better than me lol
THANK YOU FOR SAYING SOMETHING FOR ME LIKE THANKS
All true. Happens to me DX
Being skinner is more socially acceptable then being fat and it hurts my brain
Yup, i was there. And with a s spine i also got hurt on the back sliding of ...waterslides and karting. Cant dance either. But when i reached my 30's and started anti depressives i got fat fast. Even training my ass off in mma.  Now i wished i was still that skinny guy
True
As a skinny person, and ad a child, it also is very wrong to body shame a child
Don’t worry everyone in my family can’t dance
That is so true and  I have to make holes in my belt
i get u so much. i'm extremely skinny, and i'm 4% on the weight scale for my age. i eat so much like i eat more than the average person and i've been doing this like my whole life, and people ALWAYS make comments and have even asked my parents if they feed me at home. also i'm cold 24/7
Fam I am so skinny and every thing u said was facts especially the society one
Dont forget drink tons of whole milk because you need the fat in it to feel full for longer than 2 hours.
I feel attacked. Hitting the gym made me gain weight
The pants and belt one is wayyy too relatable to me
Most of these for me apply for me except on my feet
I am really skinny but am really good at dancing all of the rest are true tho
You made my week with this video. Thank you!
Whenbyou dance you look like a man who dosent know nothing
Do you know how it's like being a fat person "your clothes don't fit you, oh well  guess you should wear a fucking bathrobe instead"
If ur skinny I’m a stick  Compared to me ur not skinny at all
Bruh I have high metabolism and I kid you not, it took me YEARS to get into a normal weight for a 14 year old. Yet, now I'm only 100.22 pounds 😃
I’m 10 and I’m like 50 pounds and your like 60
I’m skinny too and I understand all of this a lot 😅
I know what you taking about cause im to skinny to.
Not skinny. Never have been. Never been able to dance. Ever. 💃
I have the Got damn same problem :/
Am thick
Get married, you'll start putting on the pounds really fast
I’m skinny as fuck, like you can see my bones (ED) but I can dance- only slow dance because I have a supporting partner!
This reminds me of this anorexic woman who jumped on a net and broke her wrist on Survivor
Wow I just wow
Mate I'm skinny as fuck I am 9lbs
Are you a boy or a girl
I relate to everything en especially being cold
My question is why you on the sink🤣🤣
Your cussing is totally not necessary,  and certainly taking the LORDS name  in vain, if you can't  communicate without cussing , then stop doing tic tok and go to church
HOLY CRAP HOW MUCH I CAN RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH. Thank you for talking about this
Same lol
You do better dance than me, sis.
Bro relatable
So I thought you where a boy intell the beach picture
funny dance move.... Ahahahaha
Me and u and my friend both
This is so relatable cause I'm skinny also
Why are you standing on your sink
I’m skinny as f so when I lay down like that my ribs hurt (btw I’m skinny enough that you can see my ribs)
I was skinny until I started dating. You will be missing the times when you can walk up the stairs without stopping to take a breath or groan getting up from any seat.
As a skinny guy i can relate
Lmao im fat
I'm skinny but I can dance it's just that your bad at dancing
GREATOVE AND YOU SAID YOU VANT DANCE
Omg i went to go to a covid vaccine and the doctor said to me "do you're parents not feed you at home"😑
Yoooooooooooo 😂😂😂😂
I'm also a skinny Bitch😅
I can relate
Do you know what it feels like to be obese???😭😭😭 It is worse than being skinny!!!
I love You Jayus❤🌸
Everything.same. oh my god.
This is so true
Ok you can’t attribute your lack of rhythm to being skinny 🤣🤣🤣… I too cannot dance🥲
I face the exact same problems even if I try to gain weight I just remain in a skinny body
I feel this....all of this
You might have had a hyper matableisim I have the same thing I actually can't gain wait no matter what I eat and diabetes please it is in the very very unlikely zone   Did you realise that you ate way more then you should have been but still never gained weight well congratulations you and I are similar
“I can’t dance” Me: oh it can’t be that ba- *dances* Me: …oh…
Lmao the belts!   Also, I used to buy my clothes for kids until I'm 22, and only because of the pandemic. I've gotten chubbier this year
Yeah :/
You dance better than me
This is me  I’m 13 and 91lbs Female Finally got to a good weight too
The dancing one is true
You can’t dance has nothing to do with being skinny hahahahahahhaah come on
Lucky
Any Video Can’t get cringe more thn this
I am skinny and short this is so right lol
this actually made me feel better about my body, i feel like im fat but i know im not, and this confirmed it a little more
This is all true, when I was 11 years old (2 years ago) I would go out in public with my friends and this one time we went to a trampoline park and they wouldn't let me in cause they said I was to skinny, wasn't eating enough, and I shouldn't lose any more weight jumping around a lot, I told them I was perfectly healthy, I ate enough and even if I did this how would it effect my weight they made me call my mum to confirm that I was perfectly healthy and then they made my mum call my doctor for double confirmation, like bro RUDE MUCH!? Yeah but after around 30 minutes they finally let me in, and another thing with getting cold bro whole nother lvl! I can wear 3 jackets, 2 layers of pants, and 2 pairs of socks and I'll still be freezing!
Yup I agree the problems are difficult 🙂
At least I’m not the only one experiencing it 😂
I eat more than my father and I'm still skinny even if I eat meat
Breh i feel you people call me skeleton
ik this pain but im a human heater so im good about being in cold areas
Hey I’m skinny and I have to suffer those too😭
Bruh my aunt used to say when we used to have family reunions. "Kylie your solo skinny! Eat more!" ... BISH I EAT MORE THEN YOU MORE THAN YOUR WHOLE FAMILY COMINED 😑😞
Exactly omg I’m so glad you made this because all of this has been happening to me my whole life
I've more or less been a reasonable weight my whole life. Thin, sure, cuz I'm tall and don't gorge on donuts to compensate. I relate to the pants thing and getting cold thing though, and I'm always hungry... Not sure of that one relates to anything about my height/weight
How tall are you?
I've always been pretty skinny my entire life and I can confirm all of these things lol
I get everything
Well u have a awesome sense of humor   out of it
People don't really talk about the opposite spectrum very much, I see all this about overweight people but I feel like a lot of skinny people like myself go unnoticed.
Same here girl.. same here..
I'm skinny AF and I approved this message
Ill take all that pain to be skinny
Here i am arguing over my weight
Jayus: i cant dance Me: damn you dance better than me
But apparently we are "fatphobic"
can’t dance has nothing to do with you being skinny
BRO THE FIFTH ONE IS SO RELATABLE
I can feel my frocking ribs
Same here I can’t dance
How is this so accurate 😂 our but can get numb if sitting like..30 minutes more😂
The can’t dance is a u problem
😂😂
Same
So being fat is better. LET'S GO
Bruh same
Same
The butt bones thing hits hard
Yes, the “ do you eat enough?” one hurts also yeah it hurts to sit
"Go eat a Burger or something"   Ye- No.  I work at fricking McDonald's and eat 4 to 6 time Burger a week and LOSE weight- So yeah but no 🤣
This is right I am also skinny  All these thing is happened to me actually everyone told me  One day I was in Terence the wind 💨 blow really fast so everyone told me hey you're gonna break and if my mom pick me some dress it will not fit me I will tell my mom that mom my pants is so loose then my mom will scold me
I think the best part was the stickman dance
RELATABLE
When she danced no that's like the average white person shuffle
These are facts
66 pounds is still not a healthy weight
Skinny nes don’t make you bad at dancing it is cause you are white and as a white dude I can say white people can’t dance
I am super skinny aswell
I face the same thing daily
So that’s why I would always get cold
atleast she can dance unlike me
I have skinny girl problems as well
So relatable😂🧡
i can confirm all of these. skinny has downsides too!!!
Omg I'm skinny to like everything is so true😞😶😞
the dance is sending meeeee Jy!!!😂❤️
This is all 100% accurate for me, although I can dance it just looks kinda weird lol
I get hit by medicine, drugs, alcohol and caffeine so fucking hard.
So true
Skinny same
THE DANCE THOOOOO
It’s normal that you can’t dance because some people can’t
That dance was fucking amazing
Omg for real i related to this 10000%
Dude I am 10 and u way more than you
Idk why I’m so skinny but I don’t get cold
im skinny and I CAN'T DANCE THIS SO TRUE
Bruh I feel u. Some lunch monitor forced me to get a second of discussing school food because she said I never eat. I can’t dance. I get so cold so fast
As a teenager who is too skinny this is so relatable
I'm dying of laughter
My friends call me stick but I prefer golf club
I’m really glad that other people struggle with this.
I don't mind the others too much but the fucking lack of warmth kills me
Same thing but backwards for fat people ( I know this form my fat self)
I don’t know if y’all’s have this problem but do you ever accidentally smack into the corner of a table or sum cornered piece of furniture and since my hip bones stick out a lot it hurt so f bad?
And also being tall, that is the worst combo, for example the dancing and social parts worse
Ur right u can't dance
I feel you I am the same way
U know what screw auto correct
It's OK I fucking suck at dancing
My mom literally used to call me a ‘Skellington’ like I’m Jack Skellington’s third cousin or some shit. She ALSO used to accuse me of having eating disorders all the time but NOPE IM JUST SHAPED LIKE THAT.  I put on like 30lbs in the last 5 years (WHICH IS A GOOD THING) and I’m *still* skinnier than almost everybody in my friend group.   I actually HAVE a butt now and I legitimately almost started crying because I can sit on an unpadded chair longer periods of time.
I deal with this so fucking much
If she were to twerk, it would look like a wobbling sheet of aluminum.
Yeah I totally agree because I am so fucking boney
And I have the same problems as you
I’m skin bone and muscle
I got no fat on me
I've been bullied about my weight and I always have to have really small clothes
Feel your pain I'm 14 and I only weigh 90 pounds and everything you're saying is true
Your grown, yet you weigh less than em
😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I felt this on a personal level. I've always been underweight and I felt insecure about it all the time. Oh, but I can dance so I don't think that has anything to do with how thin you are.
3rd one isn't a problem up in the north you get used to it
One of my cousins is fourth grader and he is 40 pounds I am worried for him
This is worse for boys, it sucks
Me too
O cannot relate
I was the same way till covid hit i was like 70 pounds when I was 11 and I just finally hit 175 at 14
I like your hair cut
Confirmed I just stand there in a dance
Miss yes u can't dance nor can I ESPECIALLY when I FREE..... STYLE....... Ya mine is worse
I don't know what your talking about those where the best dance moves I've ever seen.
I really hate the earing one. I'm very tall (6 foot 4 inches) and very skinny (134 pounds) and people tell me to eat more all of the time :( but all I do is eat and it doesn't help so please stop telling me to eat
All of these all of them true
The (i cant dancers)
Look ur a better dancer than me 💃🏽🕺😩😩😩
Whats with the language
I can't judge your dancing
Facts
What in the world i just saw
God the fact that the laying down one is SO true
A skinny problem ISNT SAYING THE N WORD
Ohh now i get why I always wake up when it's too cold while my cousin in just sleeping
I’m skinnier
That's the same problem I have
I'm wondering if any one ever said get yo skin tone chicken bone outta if here if not I'm surprised if so I'm feel sorry
BROO THE ENDING
Fun fact anyone can say the n word like onlyjayus
Lol now I have a  reason why I vant dance
me two
I feel you
When I was in 5. Grade a guy in my class said I was fat and I knew that was a Lie cuz I was underweight and later the same year him and his friends started saying stuff like 'why are you so skinny' and then he would hit me "for fun" so he could say stuff like 'I can feel her bones that's so disgusting' and other stuff like that. I'm still underweight but now I wear hoodies and oversized clothes so people won't know.
Love the energy,
Better, than being overweight like me. I get meaner and worse comments, from the smallest piece of food, I can gain a LOT of weight (I exercise, by the way). It's so easy gaining weight, but losing it is... Nearly Impossible..
Damn Jayus rocking that bikini and swim trunks
Here is a plus size person problem(or just a me problem)      Have you ever been told you should eat less so then you don't eat for a long time and continue to keep passing out because you want to be anorexic so you can fit it then you get told you should eat then you feel ever worse and don't eat then get sent to a mental hospital and then after that you get called crazy and selfish because you have food to eat when other people don't then you finally give up and not eat till your almost dead from starving yourself and eating zero calorie foods so you'll reach your goal of being anorexic so you can fit in and then finally you pass out thinking your finally dying and then you wake up in a hospital forced to eat while your only 11 years old. That is my  dream in one comment:)
Racist
I have always been heavy my entire life I was 200 pounds before I even hit middle school im 23 now and am almost 270 sometimes I wonder what life would be like skinny but my friends say the opposite and how they wished that they were built like me.
Every one calls me skinny
I know right my nick name that my friends call me is tooth pick
Indeed
Society: you just understand me so much even my teacher at middle school was making comments about my weight
And eating disorder that one is the worst😢😖
I'm not skinny and I'm not fat but my bum bones hurt to much when I sit on any type of chair, and I have no idea how to dance and I have a belt and I had it since 7 I'm 9- and Its to big-_- I told my dad to drill wholes in it -_- a girl cam to me and said you should eat more than salads... Umm I hate salads AND I GET COLD EVERY SINGLE TIME IM ANYWHERE
This!!! Used to always be told to eat more. I eat so much! I’m just skinny.
I'm skinny and I say I'm good at dancing like good good
Ur best dancer \:
Fuck you I'm the same 🤣 so you're telling me all of us tall sexy freak fucks can't dance 💀 I'm beginning to believe it I can't dance worth shit you looked like me dancing I'm 6'2. ,🥲
Same same same
You look good✌
That’s just me I’m skinny I don’t like much food
Just saying u can dance those moves ain't bad just put them the right order and add like a final move and bam uv got urself a cool dance :D
Girl what are you saying you dance better than me lol
i love the dance
I'm fat and I can't dance I know it's hard to be Skinny. The grass is always greener on the other side
Atleast you are not fat
I know u feel i have been there😔
I’m overweight and my butt hurts when I sit down ✋🏼😬
People say “Go get meat on your bones.” Even though they know I run every single day.
"I CAN'T DANCE!"  *Proceeds to dance*
I understand, I can’t eat a ton of food, I wasnt over 100 lbs until high school
I loved the groovy at the end
FINALLY!!!
Everyone of my friends who is skinny and start talking about it how much they don't like i just come up with the idea that i could give you a lot of fat if you really want to and realise both side s*cks
I relate to this so much!! 🥲 I hate it when my jeans don’t hat the elastic adjuster thingy.
XD I know these problems! I'm the skinniest of my family and I get cold quick,hip bones hit seats, and can't lay on my chest for long times on the floor or it hurts, have bony fingers, some clothes don't fit (good thing I like over sized things anyway), and I've been stuck at 5'6½" even my little sis is getting taller than me!
I think the dance part is not because of skinniness
God moves
Are you gay?❤
I’m very skinny and I have these Problems all the time but I think I can dance
Isn't this the person that said the n word
I am skinny as fuck and don't get cold so easily. My metabolism is fucking burning the food i eat and making inner heat
Don’t forget people always pick you up
Jayus:skinny people can’t dance All female k-pop idols: baby I’m not even here…..I’m a hallucination
I really can relate to where your ass hurt when sitting in a not cushion chair and the gwtting cold so fast
Yes
This is too true 😩
True
I can relate 😃🖐
My sentiments exactly. Ass bones are done if I can't sit on my thighs
U know what else is fucked up to say....THE NWORD
Ok girl/boy
Forking botch u r forking perfect dw dw dear
Yeah I feel ya pain espe with getting cold but for some reason my skin feels hot asf even though I'm cold
It happend to me I was depressed
Yeah I’m really skinny
LOL
Yeap i am skinny as hell
I'm so skinny
Everything you say do i have
U can't dance  I think that's all of us 🤣
I’m skinny and 8 and  my friend can pick me up
Do you stalk me? How tf did you know all of that about me?? WTF?!?
Omg this is me wtf
As a 6’2” man, I agree with every single one except the bruises on the ribs one.. I’m not that fragile. As for the eating one. I still get that all the time.. until someone actually sees me eat. Then they are jealous at my metabolism.
ayo those dance moves boi
Your beautyful
I'm getting sad realizing those things about being skinny, then the dance💀💀
I had to put so many holes in a SMALL belt it was less belt than air... I've been told to eat more, after wolfing down a pizza and three whole cheesecakes to myself
How tall are you? 🤩
I like the way you dance
I can relate to that.
As an skinny people i can confirm this is correct
"Cant dance"  *Procceds to dance better than me*
I knew a twig when I was younger she ate more than anyone I know.
When you wish you were skinny
All this is true for me tho
Being fat is worse 1. People make jokes about you being fat 2. Unhealthy 3. Can't stop cuz your stomach is already that big 4. Break things 5. PHOTOS WITH SOMEONE'S WHO'S CHUBBY
A s s bones
That's me sis lol
Its the exact same thing for me
omfg the bruising yes on my hip bones when i lay on my stomach too. and the cold don’t even get me started i get cold so easily i hate it. AND SOCIETY man growing up hearing the “do you even eat” and all sorts of things was so damaging
Well..if you plan to have any kids..find a black guy so atleast your kids won't hurt there ass sitting...
Bruh being fat also has it's downs
100000%true
True
This is sooo relatable
I get the same thing
Ho shit my arm dont fit
Been having a lot of trouble trying to gain my weight back, this made me feel a bit better lol
is it hard for skinny people to not say the n word
The dance part is a white person issue
Someone get that kid a sandwich
I wish this wasnt true😭
I have the same problems
You made me laugh so hard
Just look at dat i was like that before. What i did i became adicted to geliton/jelly with souse well lets say im not that skiny anymore
Be skinny is the life I am fat I am very fat and I want to be skinny
Racist
I understand the belt problem
I always wear a jumper because I’m so cold half the time and everyone in my friend group tries to get me to take it off, also I get mad at my gf when she takes my jumper
Skinny people actually get bullied damn I did not don that shit
I am taller than you when you were 13 Bc I am 13 and I am 6,3
I’ve always been insecure about my weight because ever since I was younger I was super skinny and my parents would make comments like you’re so skinny do you eat your lunch at school and stuff like that, but when I would gain a little weight instead of saying you’re gaining weight they would be like “Ooh you’re getting fat.” It was and still is very upsetting.
Don't feel bad look at Carnage no seriously he has his spine as the only thing that connects him to his legs
Na cus those dance moves were elite
The dance was soooooooooo fucking funny you lil shit
Lol so totally true. I have to live with this every day. The only thing that is not true for me is I can dance :) (I used to do competitive dance up until I had to drop out earlier this year)
1 & 3 though, my lord, the accuracy
Can't judge you
We live opposite lives I swear no bc Im literally fat & I have it worse than u gurl 😭 skinny peeps always looks so frikin good in every outfit & y’all can wear tuxedos & dresses & be looking like queens 👑 & I be looking like a pig wearing a tuxedo 😭 & yes we don’t get cold as much but damn does it suck during the summer frikin hot as the 7 rings of hell 🔥
So I was a freshman in high school who weighed about 95 lbs and about 5’4 give or take. Well I heard all of those comments all the damn time. And I’m now 19 out of high school almost two years and I’ve gained 80lbs since then. I will say most of it is muscle but I also grew 4 inches and my 32 a cup went to a 38 DD so I’m not over weight but I’m definitely not skinny anymore and I haven’t heard a single comment like oh be careful not to blow away, and more people hit on me tell me I have a good ass thick thighs all these complements and they say wow you gained 80 lbs since high school. Well I should’ve had 40 of it to begin with give or take. But they go how are you not fat. People just suck
Thank you for making people see there comments hurt some times
We are the same people say I’m a sack of bones and the wind can pick me up
I can relate to all of these except for the bruises while laying down, but that's only because I never lay like that, I would if I did
I feel the same way I legit have not gained weight sense fourth grade and I’m in middle school now… I weight 65 pounds!!!!
That dance made my day
At least you weren’t that
Bro I’m dealing with this a lot my parents are telling me that my muscles will grow if I eat and work out here I am 16 years old been to the gym and doing physical exercises for 2-3 years and I’m still skinny as fuck
Omg 😱 I can definitely relate to you, don’t listen to the negative reviews and comments from ignorant people that don’t have the knowledge that you and I have 🙏🏻😇😍 GOD loves ALL OF US 💯🙏🏻.
I wish I was skinny like you..
Its bad for fat people too. More or less the clothing stuff but its just backwards. And you get oppressed A LOT about being fat. But really you just have to accept your weight and be who you are! Your gorgeous no matter what 😉✨
Her:I'm so skinny  Me:ikr
I just realized, u are a girl
Bro I'm sorry bout that, but the struggle is real both ways like it's hard to tie shoes, hard to fit clothes, can't run, etc., but it's bad both ways like being skinny, can have some of those features too. Hope no one took offense to that I'm not good at explaining 🏃
I’m skinny too. Af. And I have all those problems
Can relate with ALL of these, along with the shit adults give you for being skinny.
Idk 🤷‍♀️ those are some pretty good moves
I'm skinny but i can fit in the small hole :>
I mom say s shes not body shameing me, just being honest parent :')
This is true for me
Am I the only one who can relate
throughout  my 13 years of living middle school kids were so rude 😭😭 i got called q-tips, brick (bc im flat on both sides) twig, etc. and people are like  "do you eat" LIKE YES I EAT 7 SNACKS A DAY AND STILL 90 SOMETHING POUNDS IM APPERENTLY NIT GROWING 😭  (im in 8th grade btw)
Literally me every single day
E
😅 i thought the cold was just a me thing
I GET YOU IM SIKNNY TOO!
Some people might hate me but I just started to follow them is it a girl or boy
The dancing 😬
Your dancing skills are better than mine
This is so relatable 🤣
All relatable
Onlyracist
Yes i really just thought it was just me until now
I agree with all of these as a SKINNY person but I dont think the dancing has anything to do with this
This is me
I am in the same position
I relate
As a skinny person this is accurate
I think the dancing is a you problem
Sometimes it's fun to stay still for long periods of time. They'll wonder if i died
Idk what you are talking about you are a great dancer
Hay your not alone I am a 12 year old boy and I wa 72 pounds it sucks cuz I am short af
this plus getting big bruises on my knees if i lay on them for more than 5 min
I feel the same way
10/10 personality.
I feel the same way!
I'm so sorry, but are you a girl, boy, or other?
That position in the mirror when the start of the video I love that
Yowwww ahahaha
Bro I can dance and I’m skinny
Now offense, this may seem creepy,but you seem like you're 16...How old ARE you?
I'm skinny as fuck to so I speak for myself all of these are true
I understand you I’m skinny mine whole life to
I’m skinny to I literally sometimes wear high water so they fit around my waist it sucks people always tell me to go eat a cheeseburger and they tell me that my mom doesn’t feed me when she does I just have a very fast metabolism And I get bullied because people can see my ribs
Yes
Omg Jayus you are a LIFESAVER thank you sooo much I needed this!🙏🤩  Plz don't ask why 😅
you not being able to dance is just you lol
This is soooo true my parents wouldn’t let me play any sports or even go to the gym because they were afraid I’d break in half like what the hell
Hello sister twig seen the other’s brother and sister
I have to make new hols in my belt a fat person made fun of me because I was to skinny
You dance better than me 🥲 and I’m fat 😃
Same I’m skinny as fuck and still can’t gain weight
THE DANCE IS BEAUTIFUL GIRL I CAN RELATE THO
"are you anorexic" questions I've been asked when I was rlly self conscious of my weight
McDonald
Fat people 🤝 skinny people hating society for being rude to them about something they can't always fix
I don’t think you not being able to dance is because you and skinny.
I'm simie skinny but I cant DANCE
True
Rue
My bestie is the same why ppl are so mean to her and tell her that she is a tooth pick and as skinny as a tree
Sometimes I wonder if she’s a guy or a girl though I know she’s a girl but still having my doubts
I can relate as a 121 lbs 16 year old thats 5'10 lol
Like I know! My ass hurts so much wen I sit to long!
That's eacatly me
Your lucky because im fat as fack reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I can relate too all of that
It’s the dances for me but she tried
OMG this is so true! I’ve always mean skinny and everyone always comments on it and its so annoying.
I always thought you were gay is it true
I'm skinny as fckkk like my bones also show and everyone Carrie's me like I'm so light I don't like when someone picks me up
That last dance move was 🤌 oh yeah and btw I’m the same thing ;-;
I'm fat and I can't dance either
You look good girl
Same
I can’t dance i shiver almost everyday and I need to poke holes but the other way I’m fat-😀
This is relatable CAUSE I HAVE A HIGH METABOLISM
Also, I’ve been severely underweight most of my life and when I finally got to a healthy weight people called me fat and told me they liked me better when I was skinny so I stopped eating and had to go to the hospital  :( being super skinny isn’t fun
OMG YES IM 12 AND THIS IS SO TRUE Like I’m just a kid and I get these comments all the time 💀
Your Soo funny my respect for you 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈 🤣🤣🤣🤣💕❤️😁😅🤣😂
Ahh. So it seems I'm not the only one who can't dance and instead does that.
It makes me feel insecure aswell whenever people tell me to eat, like i do, its just my metabolism
IK THATS ME TOOOOOO!!!
You complaining because you skinny am complaining because am chubby
As a 90lbs 15 yr old I agree
The dancing not a skinny problem it’s a You problem (obviously joking)
I have the same exact problem
Can releate 100%
🥵 lol
I’m fat
Every single thing said were 100% facts
I can relate soooo much!
These are all correct cuz I'm also dealing with these things and have yet to reach a healthy weight
Same girl I have the same exact problems
Not the dance moves 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ive bin skinny my hole life to
I don’t know if you’ll read this. I work in health care and been an athlete my whole life. I can emphasize with being skinny. But what really helped me was putting on good solid muscle mass. I know the video is supposed to be comedic. But if you are serious about fixing some of the problems skinny people face. Start doing some strength training or powerlifting. It doesn’t bulk women up like some people say. It helps build quality muscle mass that on women looks lean and tone. It will help you in the long run.
Faxxx
Im fat , and i also cant dance🤣🤣
I relate to this problem :-) but instead of being told I need a cheeseburger I'm asked what drugs I'm on. It's just as hard on super skinny people. Everyone judges everyone. It's sad. You are amazing.
lol so true the comments are so annoying like I’ve always been the shortest kid in class and one time I was late and they said I went to France and back (i live in the Netherlands) and they still say it today or like when it’s windy they say things like “look out you don’t fly away to France again” and a girl always calls me “hey little one” and things like that im small it’s so annoying  Ik im talking about shortness I’m skinny too tho I just wanted to mention that experience from France and things don’t know why tho
I agree
Just true, feel it
I am skinny and I can confirm this is all true.
0:42 absolute lies
IM FATTT 😭🤚
I went from 200 pounds to 135 pounds and I miss my insolation  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last one cap mam
Yes I am skinny and I have all these problems
So trueee
Yes that is true
I'm the same. Lol. 🤣🤣🤣
I em sciny
Yes those are all true. Society is really one of the worst because they are saying to just get fat. It does sound easy but maybe think about how hard it might be and maybe I am totally fine with being skinny.
yeah a major problem for me 2 am only 14 and am 5/7 and am skinny as heack
I am skinny so any time when I’m playing games I get beat up by the wind
Being fat is worst then being skinny :/
Same I can relate to like 5 of them especially the belt.🙄
I know your pain but do calisthenics and yoga
for the dance thing, you have way more energy than I do to try and dance so just that's better than, at least, me when I "try" and that energy can make it all that much more fun to be around even if "you can't dance" :)
facts lol
I can totaly relate to this my parents always make fun of me sometimes I’m 10 years old and I only weigh 62.9 pounds! But I’m still good at hitting the jig lol
Please say that's 60kg
being overweigjt comes with problems but its important to aknollege that so does being under weight :3❤️ most people disregard them because of conventional beauty standards but both sides are equally valid^^
I can relate im too skinny
This is true
Yes
I’m the exact same as you, my wrist is so skinny I had to use a k ice to poke another hole in it
You dance better than Addison Rae
These are all facts I’m so f-ing skinny it’s not even funny
Same
So true the sitting  part is so true and all of it
Yeah than people get fat shamed for getting meat lol
I eat a ton of food yet im skinny asf
all of them are just facts because im like 115-120 pounds, skinny asf. Always being called a pole or a stick 😂😂😂
Society part is true
Same as me
How the fuck is she so cool and funny as fuck??!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can relate to all of these things
Yep. I am skiny too and everything she Said is so true😪
I am 6'1 and some 130 pounds and skinny, but I will disagree with you on the cold, I have the highest tolerance to the cold compared to most everyone. But the clothes one is 100% true.
Same
Feel you
i wish i was skinny
Soon true I hate being sooo skin people skinny shame me all the time and I'm 10
Just stop ✋ 😒 😪 😑 😫 not that is not right  🕺💃💃💃💃
Remember when those ridiculous body positivity fucks come at you remember that they are ridiculous. Everybody has problems skinny fat tall short the only reason this body positivity movement even has traction is because there's a ton of fat people that want to be okay with the fact that they're fat and being fat is super unhealthy and being too skinny is super unhealthy and whatever
Same, and what's really annoying about being skinny is that people will just assume you're happy just because "you're not fat".  A) don't say "fat" say overweight, "fat" is extremely rude to call a person And B) how you look doesn't automatically affect how you feel
I'm skinny to and I am so cold
I can dance but most of the other stuff um yeah
Not gonna lie when someone says I should put on some weight it's so damn annoying
Same girl same. Every one of these are true
Finally, I video I can fully relate to🤣
I’m skinny as hell but I’m only 12 , and I ain’t never get cold tho.
Oh so not being able to dance isn't just a me problem?-
I know how you feel 😐
As a guy around 6'3" I can agree with all of this it fucking sucks sitting in non cushioned seats as your butt has so little there it is bone on chair. I actually got a Pokemon belt buckle from my ma at one point but couldn't get a belt that fit me, along with the pants finding pants that fit me in length that aren't massive in the waist is trash. Tip for anyone that doesn't want to try and fix belts or try to find a belt with enough holes, seatbelt belts are the best thing ever easy to get on and off fully adjustable to any size and come with awesome patterns and designs. They are very comfortable cause they curve perfectly to anyone's waist I love them
being skinny as hell makes me worried that I will actually blow away in the wind and it's almost happened before 🤩
Yup understandable have a great day
You dance better than me
As a skinny person I relate to all of these I also can't danceಥ‿ಥ
I liked the washing machine move it was cool
O can relate too you
You were as much as my 10 year brother
The comments still happen to me
66 pounds?!?!
BRO I WAS SO SKINY AS A KID and all my friends would say “ omg aly ur going to blow away in the wind”😭
Same 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲
IM DEFINITELY YOUNGER THAN YOU AND YOU WEIGH 66 POUNDS? I WEIGH 73
Wait HOLD UP
The society part man , that's just facts man
Can relate as a skinny person
I'd rather take a skinny life still. It's still better to fit into clothes than not
All that was true cause I’m short
I used to be too skinny now I'm too fat. Can't be happy.
0:15
The last one might just be a jayus problem
I really like her voice
So true I'm skinny I've been sick in my whole life to and I was asked if I was eating properly because my brother and my dad were a bit bigger But I ate more than them
What was the dance at the end
Underweight gang rise up
Same
Or maybe it depends on what’s everyone’s definition of “healthy” is  I’m a 85 lbs male and I’m 20 years old been skinny whole life, but I never suffered from any disorders or malnutrition, I did skip my daily meals for 2-3 years and did fall casualty to bullying, but none of that affected me. And I don’t play any sports too and I’m introverted  But I was never less than any average male or a female my age, and doing so I was able to even enlist in the navy in my country and I was better than my average sized peers in the military who often hit the gym and were sporty or muscular For someone like me who looks unhealthy I had noticeable difference in my  performance compared to others which included that  I was faster in each tactical movement, had better accuracy, was  quicker to register more hits on target and was  able to overcome obstacles and evacuate casualties without any difficulty. While the others  would struggle to be agile  and have control in getting  through these obstacles and had to retry them several times before they got it right .  But I was unhappy about my haight (still am) because I’m only 174 (5’8-5’9) cm which is short for a male 😔
Everyone at me school would always be like “eat a burger” “your a twig” and then I would eat lunch and they’d be like “omg slow down your gonna explode” like bro-
That’s literally me!
You my friend CAN DANCE✨✨
Faxs for me
It’s so true
onlyjayus : I CANT DANCE!!!  ME : i also cant dance but my room is 19-25 and like  i still feel Hot!?!?! And im skinny like a STICK
that is very TRUE
No I'd say you're a pretty good dancer
Can’t Dance… ong😭😂
Good dance LOL XD🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
I'm not skinny but I'm not fat either and I agree to some of these. However, whenever someone told me I was too skinny, I would just shrug it off cuz even at a young age, I knew I can't do much about it.
You can’t dance I can’t fucking smile
She said she COULDN'T dance
Too true
I was 80kg 6 months ago now im 70kg
When you lie on your stomach too long your bsck starts to hurt then you get up and because there isnt fat on you ur organs all feel like they are falling onto your diaphragm causing alot of pain
Bro I lost 8 pounds on a cruise while my brother gained legit like 5
I can agree with everything here. My arms are so skinny and I'm self conscious about it
Skinny girls over any girls 😂😂🥰
I knew a kid on Alaska who was like 120ibs soaking at 5’9 or so and the cold did not bother him one bit, tbh the cold doesn’t bother me cause I’ve seen -40 degree winters, it’s not fun, but my body is used to cold so 30 degree winters in the lower states don’t bother me even without a jacket
I don't know what you're talking about you dance just fine
DUDE I WANT TO BE SKINNY
Bro I've always been skinny as fuck but since I started to work out over the past few months I went from 105 pounds to 122
Yes true everyone is like get meat on your bones     IM A VEGATERIAN
All of my skinny friends (pretty much every friend of mine) can't dance either so ye XD I have never asked them if they have problems with being skinny so I will. Tomorrow.
THE DANCING IS AMAZING UDHSH
YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS I got taken from my mom because of it TO BAD MY GRANDPARENTS COULDNT FEED ME ENOUGHT XP
My older brother has the same situation, some year's ago he needed to do the same thing with the belt

I'm skinny and extremely short (4ft 8in) imagine my struggles lol!😟 but I'm so blessed ❤️
Growing up, I was skinny as a cheese string, my 2nd ever girlfriend, who I really liked a lot dumped me coz she said "you have no ass you're way to skinny" when I was 18. So I started eating. By the time I was 25 I was a chubby thing, now everyone says I'm too porky..... Great 👍
I don’t know what your talking about thos moves are FIRE
“I’m afraid ur gonna break in half in the wind” It’s so true it’s funny😭😭😭
I believe in you practice dancing

STRAIGHT FAX
I think being skinny makes you racist Not sure tho
God loves you so much
God loves you so much

This is me 13 years old 4’11 and ways 65 pounds

Cant dance? Well your definitely better than me
Dancing is not a skinny people  problem. I'm 5'11, and 130 pounds or 59 kilos, and i,,, can dance, sister.
I totally need you in one of my songs dude seriously!!!
This makes me feel validated as someone who lost 40 pounds because I now suffer all these problems 😂😂😂
I Was Skinny When I Was Little Butt Everyone Kept Picking On Me Because I Was “Too Skinny” So I Started Eating A Bit More And Now People Call Me Fat Sooo
You’re incredible.
On Crack While dancing
Jayus: skinny people problem cant dance Kpop idols: Ehem
My fiance was bullied for having anorexia. The dude can and has eaten like $200 worth of grocery store food in a week. They're not anorexic
I used to be skinny as well weighing somewhat between 40-50 kg but then i started eating n here i am in 67
Same.
So true this happens to me
I'm 12 and I'm barely in healthy wait because of depression I just started eating last month and I was 80 something pounds and now I'm 95 something
Guess what, no one asked
Omg a teacher said that to me and im a flipping child!!!
Bro how is anyone supposed to just know how to dance? Just supposed to look at a dance floor and say ope time to bust out the moves
Relatable
I think the dancing is a different problem
Im dying
People think it’s rude to call someone fat and calling someone skinny also hurts I know both feelings but I’ve learnt be yourself and don’t change for someone to like you
Me being 10 and as skinny as you
Oh my grandmother talks about how skinny I am and tells me to eat more..
I’m skinny too and people say it’s unhealthy
YOOO. SAME!!!
You still dance better than me.
You dance like my dad 😁
Same man.. I can’t believe                How dumb I am
And how long have you been a racist for exactly?
Then dance moves through 🤣
Damn I know how this feels😭
Im 9 and 80 through 70 pounds please tell me if I'm gonna die
That is like me
I have actuly hid behind a pole once and i was the past one found
Me to im way to skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiny
That comes natural
Bro the dance was good
They always compare me to a walking chopstick or anchovies :/
I have the same problem
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Skinny is okay as long as it’s not skin and bones
I can’t dance Either
Honey being skinny isn't the reason why you can't dance I know it's hard to believe but I guess your just born to be bad at dancing sorry :') <3
Pain you have to live has skinny person
I liked your dancing 😊 better than mine
I eat 2500-3500 calories a day and I’m still stuck at 105 I can’t gain weight
What are your pronouns?
I understand this way too much.  my ribs are visible no matter how much I eat.
POV she just wanted to show off her incredible dance moves
I can relate to all of these, especially the "do you eat?"
I just work out just to get bigger you just Gotta get buffer if you can’t eat
I got the same problem
Yo bro let me tell you this I'm fat as hell but let me tell you this you just have a really a really high metabolism which is fine but at least you're not fat as heck because that's a lot more concerning then being way too skinny because for you just go eat a Big Mac or a Whopper just you know but you're not fat.
Dude, being skinny and living in the south is hard. Especially is your trying to eat healthier. Cause people are all the time trying to fatten ya up
Lol that's my uncle he's a twig
your the best dancer in the world I don't know what ur on about😂😂
I've always wondered what it's like to be skinny =]
I under stand all of this what I did to solve this was I started working out and eating all the time
Same. It sucks and I don’t have a healthy weight
being fat is way worst.
I’m a bigger size but I have 0 ass so when I sit….ahahaha that shit hurt.
The last one isn't from being skinny that's just a part of being white
She dance better than me dude.
I feel this in my SOULL
Go eat a burger  I literally eat (a healthy amount) but I literally cannot gain pounds
Omg I’m not the only one THANK YOU
Jesus fuck, it must be a living hell be skinny.
This is 100% ture!
Same
Are you going to be on the fridge next
Nobody ever talks about this! So thank you so much! I'm 5' 2" and 110 lbs and people give me shit about eating all the time and it drives me nuts! It's not okay to body shame a heavy girl why is it okay to body shame a skinny girl?
I don’t think that last part has anything to do with weight
You can’t dance skinny people can dance if I think it’s just you that can dance
i understand! im 12 and i weigh 80 pounds...idek if thats normal!
EAT SWEET STUFF, THINK GIRL THINK
finally now I know who my favorite youtuber's gender is
True
SAME
This is very relatable
Im skinny too IT went so far my Mom called me french fry its Not a big Deal (it funni and all) but i agre with the Sitting Thing (i cant write since im dumb so idk If its Sitting ore Siting ore agre ore agree )i Used the Word ore was to much
Same I am to
You not being able to dance is a you problem, not because your skinny
6feet 140lbs
when you have a non existent metabolism
I love the dance moves
U never could have danced
U never could have danced
I feel this on every level
"You can't dance" *begins to dance better then I ever could*  Me:..... . Uh... You sure?
If this cheers you up you dance better than me
Sooo true!!!😭 Not loving it
Yup I can relate to you
…..this is accurate…..
I liked her dancing. I look fat but I'm probably normally skinny.
The dancing part me and you both 🥲
Relatable
Omg I relate to everyone of these, it’s so true! Especially the society one. I’m always told that I’m to skinny, I need to put some meat on my bones, eat a cheeseburger, omg your so tiny I can fit my whole hand around your waist, etc
Finally, someone else understands
I have been being called skinny for the past few months but I don’t think I’m that skinny. Can somebody tell me if I am? 96 lbs at 5’3”
Bro I’m still very skinny
Relatable
Still pretty though😊, lol no but yeah being skinny sorta sucks😅
I’m underweight, and so skinny you basically can see my bones. It has nothing to do with what I eat, I just can’t grow any fat. So yes, all of these are relatable (except for cannot dance since I take dance lessons so I think I dance decent I think)
I was not expecting that 🤣
I have all these problems, people say I’m lucky I have fast metabolism, but I just want some meat on my back. I love getting massages but theres not many spots that I can get massaged on and people freak out when they see my angel wings. In school I have to use my massive jacket as a cushion because the seats are uncomfortable. I have been gaining a bit more weight ( probably because I’m getting older ) so hopefully all these problems will fade away with time as my metabolism slows down, but I think that could be bad because then I’ll eat to much and my metabolism won’t be as fast as I’m used to and I gain too much weight
those people that assume i’m anorexic are the worst
It's so true sitting down on a chair hurts my ass a lot
Sitting hurts laying down hurts I don’t get cold tho
If you think your skinny try me   I'm a white male who is currently 5,7 and I way only 110 pounds and I haven't even hit my main growth spurt yet hmph 😤
You dance so great hahaha yeah me to i m so skinny and my brother haha me to i cant dance and my jeans cant fit and in my house i have 2 air condition and its very cold
So I understand
Am also really skinny
SKINNY SINCE BIRTH
Dance is not only a skinny people problem
Soooo you dance like my grandma I'm not even joking she says wacha me dance I sit down she looks like a broken McDonald's ice cream machine
Mhm
When your the same weight as her but you dont want to admit it because you have a massive age difference between you and me. Lol insecurities
Nailed it.  I'm an old man skinny my whole life and all those things were said to me and experienced by me many times.  Don't expect it to ever end.  I do think being skinny is probably preferable to the opposite body type, but it isn't the paradise heavier people think it is.
I have never related more to a video.
Luckily I'm not that skinny
Coopikarottensticks
Her: I’m starting to get a healthy weight  Also her: shows 66 pounds  Me: same
SAME
Can’t dance dance class
Same I’m super skinny
If she can’t dance no one can
Im skiner
Same here
I'm lucky in bad luck. I am as thin as a stick and 190 cm tall, but I can eat what I want in large quantities without it being visible
aye you're lowkey cute ngl 😏
I’m not skinny and you have better dance moves than be
I have all the same problems
Bro I had the same comments I feel you
Okay, those goofy dance moves were funny enough for a like
I’m fat
Same and even after u eat it's like it doesn't even work
Same Energy as me
Yes you can dance jayus
I am. Very skinny and when I was growing up ppl would be like do you eat air and I was tried of that question so I would say yes and it tastes very good and I love my body
Whats worse than being skinny? Being skinny and tall
She looks like Pete Davidson’s sister lol
I have these exact same problems
Jayus: do your clothes never fit Me, who's skinny and tall: WHO TOLD YOU?
Bruh all the same but that last one uhhhh idk about that maybe i cant idk haven't tried
Me too 😭
Me being too under weight for my age and eating a lot but never gaining weight and people always telling me they want to be me because im skinny 😶
I am so skinny as well and everything you said is true including the dancing part 😂
Jay are you straight ?
🤗🤗🤗
Tru
Wait, laying down doesn’t hurt other peoples ribs? Shit I guess I am skinny, I’ve been in denial because so many people made fun of me
I eat a lot and I’m still skinny af
i’m also skinny And I deal with the same stuff it’s sucks as hell and I get bullied a lot
Yup I could agree this is why i get cold very fast
I have these problems too
Don't see how being skinny makes you a worse dancer but the rest I relate too
This is actually relatable
I love you re body so  You look verry nice cute and beautiful .girlll😄
I thought most of these were  Normal
Bestie I also cant dance even if I'm not skinny 🤣
SO TRUE THOOOO
Fucking True
I know how you feel
I feel this
I can dance really well
A bit relatable
Haha I remember being asked on several occasions by different people if I was suffering from some sort of eating disorder because I was so skinny-😂
I love your dance moves they are phenomenal
I'm exactly like you I eat soo much but can't grow
Facts
Don't dance please😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I finally way more than than someone

This so true I can't dance my family is like eat more when I lay down it foes kinda hurt so true im ill at the moment and the ther one I forgot
im skinny and my brother made fun of me cus i kept getting so fucking cold every second
The twerk 😂 also remember (especially females but also males) society is so messed up about being "too skinny" or "too fat" it goes both ways
I don’t want to be fat but at the same time I don’t want to be a twig….So I’m just skinny. THE PAIN I RELATE
I think the dancing problem is personal
6'2 and at my heaviest ever 145lbs. Literally everyone tells me to eat a cheeseburger and gain weight. (-.-") so annoying.
My das always makes fun of how skinny i am even his friends would say thag if the wind was to hard i would blow away :( he even compares me and my little sisters weight and makes mean jokes again :(
Your hot soo.... I wouldn't know you had those problems I guess
I am also skinny
OMG SAME I HAVE THE SAME PAIN
i think the last one is just tall people problems
I envy skinny people so much. You are ENCOURAGED to eat alot, im here with my fatass self feelign guity inhaling too much oxygen
I'm skinny and im Embressed or shy to show my wrist (basically my whole arms)  does anyone have that kind of things too or it's just me
Are you trying  to 🤔???
I finally reached a health weight the scale: 660
Happens to me all the time
Everything about this I feel oml 😫
I was 116-118 now i'm like 122
I weight 89 pounds-
Same but the bully who made fun of me regretted it bc he's fat as a hippo
I was even skinnier than that
Relatable
So this is how my step sister feels
But I can dance
Same
My parents told me that if i stay skinny i would fly away in the wind and now that i gained weight my parents tell me stop eating like that its not healthy and now I’m just like how tf do u want me to eat then
You really tried to dance 😂
I’ve been skinny for basically my entire life as well and my family has made comments about have you eaten anything and it is really messed up
She actually right I fucking experience this crap and I eat a lot I am still fucking skinny
The last part tho 😭✋
This always happens to me , most of the time in social lot of people judge for how I look it really hurts me  ( But now I don't care much now a day I got an habit of it ) now when ever someone tells me how I look I always tell them ( first look at  yourself and then judge me )  Never jubge someone or tell someone how they look !!
Well I have that insulation but that means I'm always h o t, even if its 70 degrees f outside with a cool breeze
I think you're beautiful....
I'm so skinny too
Me fat af
Not to criticize but I’m a 11 year old child and can give Jayus a piggyback
Holly fu*k you are a bad dancer 🤣🤣
I’m really skinny my brothers make fun of me and I only way 70 pounds
for society with bigger people its the same, except its opposite. “Eat less, lose some weight!” i mean for some, its just their natural body type and theyre shamed for it. society kinda sucks sometimes
Thank you for making this relatable to me😌
As a person who does flooders I can say my tailbone hurts like a door got collapsed on it
Me: A 13 year old weighing 70 pounds. Bro I wear clothes for a 6-8 year old-
" your skinny " mcdonalds: need some help?
I’m a TWIG, I’m always in hoodies and blankets when the time is right
God, my Mom has been skinny all her life, she's nearly 40 and she's only 42 KG. Is that normal???
I’m like that but I’m really good at dancing
Very true
Somebody asked me to do a plank and my arms couldn't take it so I dropped and then my ribs hurt so bad, Its really true, also comments like that ended up with me eating even less and some people still called me fat- sometimes I drop like 20kgs a week even trying to eat but now being naturally skinny
Yup know that problem
Watching her dance is like watching National Geographic
OMG THIS IS SO TRUE. I’VE BEEN EATJNG A LOT LATELY BUT IM STILL SKINNY-
I thought you was dude 😂🤣
Bro wdym that dancing was unreal
All of these I can confirm. Especially the warmth, belts, and social interactions. Even if it's unrelated, I can't dance either
Same girl
As a skinny as frick person it hurts for ppl to say that like yes I’m skinny if you have a problem with that idc- so yeah sorry for wasting anyone’s time-
Yesss that stupid belt problem!! I switched from normal belts to a belt that has no holes. I loop it through my belt loops like normal and either tie or loop it through itself a dozen times.
Fr my mother tells me I’ll blow away in the wind,  She called me a tree the other day, then send me a gif of someone hugging a tree,  “ Sending you hugs!! “ I love her and her jokes but god damn MSJSKJD
I am skinny as f*ck my hole f*cking life and I've been dancing for 7 f*cking years.  now I'm 10 ·_· WTF?!?!
"I can't dance"  *Dances like nobody's business*
That Hip game was strong in the dancing bit
Id rather been told "go eat a burger" instead of "go eat a salad"
Ay same but also the exact opposite cause I’m fat af
So efing true ahhhhh
Bruh u can dance it’s amazing 😂
So fking true
Dude what about, the other half? Being called fat? Happened to me. I lost weight but still! They still say "you're a little fat still! You lost weight? I dont see it?"
Im skinny af, I have a fast metabolism so I have to eat alot but I get so sick so Im just stuck like this and I hate it

Im skinny and i Relate to it its annoying
Jayus eating a chicken nugget in a parking lot got me for some reason
Me be like
This is understandable and relatable
I'm skinny as Fuck too😀
I can relate lol I’m always cold and the fact that all my class rooms are a different temperature that’s soo cold it sucks ya being a stick man sucks
As a skinny person i can relate to this very much
People that complain about being skinny 😒😒😒
I'm one of those people who can eat 70 pounds of food and gain no weight
Yasss, totally relate. That why I love the belts with the d-rig s so you don’t always have to poke new hiles
I fucking understand that-
I am still skinny but Same problems
Yeah I’m 14, 180 lbs 5,6 and jacked and it kinda sucks because no matter what I try to do to not be so jacked nothing works ( like at all )
Ok your fucked up very much
Nice chucks!!
I'm 12 and I'm over 66 kilos
I was husky as a kid and now as an adult I’m skinny I’m happy with my body but I can’t relate to this so much
Relatable
Honestly I think I’m too fat but not to fat but I still need to get skinnier you know?
3 and 4 and 6 yessssss
Don’t forget being called anorexic and shit
Can't dance one is so true, I look Hella ugly while dancing 🤧😭.
I’m a mixed person, both parents have fast metabolism, and it’s very hard to gain weight for me. I eat a LOT of food. I have more than the regular amount an average person has a day. And what’s worst, I’m lactose intolerant. And I have a bowl movement that takes all the weight I was supposed to gain.
Imagine saying the n word jayus
THIS IS SO RELIABLE
Date a fat person they be warm 24/7
I feell your pain
I’m skinny I get cold really easy people do  go eat my pants do fall down to lol
Eat like seven burgers on top of a burger with cheese extra mayo
This is all the stuff that happens to me my ribs show and I'm not kidding
Too true
I can relate
Im skinny but when i get older I will gain weight but yes I get comments like “oMg YoUr A sTiCk“ “GuRl Do YoU eAt“ YES I EAT IM SORRY IM SKINNY  IM CONSTANTLY EATING 😭😭😭 (im 81 pounds)
You legit just described my daily routine
Girly I feel the exact same Way I have really long legs and I’m just tall in general but I’m super skinny so whenever I buy pants that are long enough they’re way too big on the waist and whenever they fit perfectly on the waist they are way too short and sitting in school chairs is legit torture for my butt and all my friends are like oh my gosh you’re so skinny like what the heck
😔✊ number 5. Hit real hard tho Bc it can get really bad and some even end up have eating disorders, bullying, etc. and that’s not ok but guys just know there’s always some one to talk to about those thing so stay strong 💪😁
I am terribly skinny and people always make fun of me! It freakin sucks!!!! I am 12 so I am hoping at some point I wil get fatter. Hey  I am actually a really good dance
Oh well at least you're healthy
I listen but I'm the opposite I'm over wait 160 pound 13 year old  and I can say hambergs do not help also I live somewhere cold on the border of Canada shorts all year long also I love sleeping on the Flore but running vary hard
I know how you feel 🥲
Well if you try to be silly and dance like that then you’ll will definitely have some stares😂 but why do you even care? Aren’t you dancing like that that for your own fun anyways for tiktoks? Also So who cares what others think these days anyways?😂 you wouldn’t be on tiktok if you cared about others opinion that much...and being skinny...girl shut up and go model! Those model agencies want super skinny people anyways! Already you’ll be a healthier model who doesn’t have to puck her guts out or not eat anything to stay “skinny” on purpose! 🤷‍♀️
I sit down on a freaking metal or like wood share my cheeks hurt that’s why
THE BELT PROBLEM LOL
It’s shitty but better then being fat
Dancing part not really skinny problem more like a white person problem
Bro same
You dance like my sister she is very skinny too she never  Eats either
As a skinny person this is to true
Well I seen some fat kids who can dance
So freaking relatable
Literally me
I know you probably can't tell, but I've been overweight my entire f-ing life.
I'm skinny and for me number three is completely the wrong in almost never cold
It’s even worse if your a guy
When she was dancing it got me saying boy what the hell boy
I have experienced everything that you just said
Fact🙃😴
This is so true I’m so skinny I’m only 80 pounds in 8th grade and I eat ALOT OF FOOD but have such high metabolism
Being a skinny person I can relate to all of these
I’m lucky I have so much that I can literally barely move a lot
The worst part in my opinion about being skinny is that people don't understand I'm TRYING to gain weight. I LOST weigh over the pandemic because I wasn't exercising as much and I lost all my muscle mass. It's fucking annoying.
Yeah I don't know why you're complaining I don't know if you like girls or guys but most guys prefer that despite the whole thick fetishment we seem to be undergoing and I'm a Chicano meaning Mexican born in the US
this is so true for me but i kind of got used to it
So true
bestie doesnt have to suck in my stomach to see my ribs 💀
I was diying
Same
is it just me or does she dance better than me?
66.4!! i’m 11 years old and i’m 76.3
Im skinny too i know this
True that
relatable
the dancing is just bc your white
I think the dancing is a you problem😂
I love how she is honest
I look like a fucking deadbush from Minecraft  Meaning I’m skinny asf
It is so true
Poor you! Fat people get lots more criticism and bullying towards them, Especially in the media.
I feel you i am a tall skinny guy and the comments about eating are a pain like man i probably eat more then a average person but i guess its just the genes that make me skinny
You're beautiful
Wow your better at dancing than me
Yesss me!!!!
Glow up go crazy
I’m skinny as heck
I have a fast matabalisam
I feel you
fun fact: whenever I'm with my grandma she tells me to either eat more meat or something or that I'm too skinny so the society one is basically my grandma
Jayus would be that one kid at the school dance that doesn’t give a shit what people think
I was skinny my entire life until middle school which is where I got my growth spurt, I can confirm that when I lie down on the floor….I feel my my ribs are going to crack lol…
im 5 10 and 47 kg  i get all of these
Same
I can't danceee
Well you can dance better than me for sure
Never gonna give The mean attitude
Im exactly like you , we need 2 eat more 😂
Fun fact: No one doesnt know how to dance, we all just have that ability
Why is this me to
Yess & tall asf
I’m the opposite when it comes to hot and cold. Everywhere I go is too hot
Yay now I’m not alone
I mean I love being skinny but only problem I’ve is getting cold I really hate it
I’m a dude… and yet this is exactly how I feel
Be great full a don't have to add on to your belt🤣
She can dance better then me
Same
Lithely
I wish I had these problems instead of having fat people problems. I want a refund
Ok soo plz never dance again
All the same for me
One thing that I hate is doing sit ups, like I want to do them to build muscle so I’m not just bones but every time I do them, even with a yoga mat underneath my tailbone, it just hurts to much.
same :)
I am a stickbug :D and i like it i can squeeze Anywhere i want, also bonus im the thinnest in the shcool so everybody asks meh for help XD
No
SAME MY SISTER ALWAYS TOUCHS MY RIBS BC YOU CAN SEE THEM I no one Will hug me because I’m too bony
You can dance perfectly fine better than I will ever do
Being skinny is way better mate when I was skinny I could climb the top of a tree in seconds now I'm shaking to climb a ladder 😟 ignore these mouths that stay they will compliment only in death "oh he was a good man" Does it really matter?Wtf 😲
I feel ya my mom always said I’m skin A.H and I said it’s how it is I eat but it just won’t make me fat or gain weight plus I like how I look then she said other people think I don’t feed you enough and btw she still complaining about it till this day
I am happy cause I'm funking average
Jayus : I can't dance. Me : I disagree. Those are some cool moves.... 😉
I felt this
THIS IS THE SAME THING IVE EXOERIENCED😂
Omg the butt bones hurting- thanks to COVID and my binge eating I gained so much butt and thigh fat (I even have stretch marks). I actually hated it at first buttttt sitting no longer hurts lol
*your flat.*
So true , like same 😂
The dance looks like she was on crack for 3 years
To be honest we all can’t dance
Finally someone that knows how I feel
Show us some of ur basketball highlights 👀
Hey I am 12 years old and I would really appreciate it if you wouldn’t say the f word every 5 seconds. Thanks.
You just read my mind,I'm 16 years old and I'm at only 40Kg,during the summer I just can't go out without a hoodie because the bones on my elbows are so visible
I only joke like that with my skinny friends. I hate when people comment on other’s bodies. Don’t talk about a child’s body like that, ever. I will call my friends skinny because we know it’s a joke and then go tell them to eat a turkey. They’ll then tell me to run a mile, cause I’m chubby. So what? We friends.   But like when you say that to people you don’t know or children you can genuinely hurt somebody. Strangers don’t know you are joking or have good intentions. I know I love my friends and they know that. But strangers have no strings attached which is the WORST, and kids are impressionable. You can give them eating disorders in the future.  Don’t do it.
I cant gain wait like for real
I'd love to be skinny I've always been chunky I went on a diet and I gained weight so  idk
I’m 69 pounds at 12
I am naturally skinny so thank you and my parents and my family say the same thing as a matter of fact my brother tells me that if he opens a window that I wuld fly out and my parents only lagh
Meanwhile , you are still skinny 😂
You really can't dance 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Being skinny means nothing why you cant dance you got no rythm.  No hate being skinny. Im literally so skinny my ribs show all the time
So relatable
I swear that if I knew you in real life, I'd want to become your friend so bad omg
I love you for this. No cap, no kid. I adore you so you much
I'm sorry ma'am, but you CAN dance. Stop spreading lies.
Call the police somebody stole your ass
"Can't dance" Bish have you seen MJ?
Don’t worry bout a few of those, I’m a fat ass and belts don’t fit and I can’t dance either, and sitting hurts anyone’s ass
I can relate.
Are you a girl?
Onlyjavus:"I can't dance" Me:and you still dancing better than me
I'm really skinny buy im never cold for some reason....
U played volleyball
Idk that dancing was pretty good bruh
https://youtu.be/pCbqp93bz_I
YEA AND WHEN I LAY ON MY RIBS IT DANG HURTS SO BAD!!!
the fact is in not that skinny and when I freaking sit down  THE BONES IN MY BOOTY FREAKING FEEL LIKE THERE GOING TO SNAP and btw I AIN'T FLAT I'M DAMN THICKY NICKY!!!
Trying to gain some weight till' the finish line of my middle school. And yeah, all of that is relatable, besides the fact that you can't dance. I took dancing classes before. so nah, I can dance.
Everything that happened in the video is also with me so everyone wants to be thin but if they really know how that is, they wish they had never said that even if it might be nice for many it also has bad sides :,)
The first parts were true as f
My friend and I in 4th grade were outside waiting for our parents and the wind was picking up really fast. We had to hold on to each other because we were getting pushed by the wind like rag dolls lol.
Lest thing i dont think bc you are skinny
And I’m skinny
Bruh I am nine and I weigh the same amount as you
Very relatable cause I'm under weight but it's useful in some ways I guess
I can relate
We should start a support group.And Call it...."Yes, I do eat".
Me
Poke new holes . That kill me
FINALLY SOMEBODY GETS ME!!!      *I will ✨s t a b ✨the people who said I don’t eat-*
Guys, just remember someone saying “go eat a burger” is the same as you telling someone to stop eating so much or straight up calling them fat. It’s very rude and anybody with social skills knows not to say anything about another persons’ appearance unless it’s a compliment.
I think the last one is a separate issue
I agree with most of what you just said
All these I can relate
Me too <3
If you're having a proper diet and eating healthy there's no need for you to eat extra and force yourself to eat IF AND ONLY IF you already eating healthy and proper. I was a stick my whole childhood but once I hit 18 I've got a proper body meat and am considered slim which is a pretty look but will look chubby not fat if I gain further weight. (Or I'm talking nonsense idk but that's what it had been for me so...)
All of that has also happened to me, but at least there are benefits of being skinny, I suppose it’s better than being fat, and you can build up muscles pretty fast (well at least I can).
Ohhh can’t dance someone said that I am to thin to dance and I would just embarrass my self but I told her well look who got a singing and dancing gig from that day on we never talked
My cousin is skinnier then my 4 year old cousin and she can dance
I’m thick!
I am skinny to
I am super skinny and I still feel fat xd
Me dancing with the boys when we don’t have a date in the school dance
True, true, true, true, extra true
I hated that. Skinny shaming is a THING! Don't do IT!
im skinny too, n even my friends tease me about it. i hate it, i tried to eat more than i could n it ended badly. just feels better knowing people can relate.
WTF IS THAT DACE *she dance better then me*
Being skinny is pretty shit, my own parents are like “go eat stuff” like bitch I eat food my body is not making fat cells mate.
This is all relatable to me!
Bro I’m also skinny as fuck I’m 11 and I have been the same fricken wait for three years!
So that's why my friend is getting cold But my feiend is the skiniest girl ever , but, sheis also the best dancer everr!
Not only do I get cold rlly fast but it takes me 10+ hours in a jacket in 40 degree weather which is hot here in nsw Australia so I am damn near immune to heat
My friend tells me and my friend were too skinny and.im really incacure about iy
I was born with height and weight problem so I'm 22 and I'm 39kg I'm so skinny n tall that everybody calls me giraffe 😅 just don't judge i had many problems in my past life..
Graduated high school weighing 81 lbs. at 5'2".  "You're so skinny you can change clothes in a gun barrel."  "Do you have to run around in the shower to get wet."  "Does your husband have to shake the sheets to find you."  During my pregnancy at age 30, I gained 60lbs.  A few months after my son's birth,  I stayed at 105 for years.  I've slowly gained through the years and at 70 yrs I'm  at 125lbs.  I never let it get to me.  When someone would mention my weight,  I would reply with one of the many jabs I'd been told.  Stopped the teasing cold.
When I was skinny, child belts are your friend or invest in buying a belt hole puncher
Tot when i got to 30 I would get fatter,nope.Tot when I had a baby I would get fatter, nope.Just running wit it now,can't kill myself
Everything in this video, I can relate to.
This is soo true like ive been telling myself to go eat more so im not that skinny af, nope, still the same weight
The problems are really true but I can dance
Me who stays in the cold 24/7 and is skinny
Why I think she is a big fan of the last of us
You still got some dance moves
I’m skinny and I’m known for being a dancer
During puberty I started gaining a lot of weight but recently I've started losing them. The first thing I noticed was the sitting part, my ass hurts a lot because of the bone and the thing I really hate the most are the people's comments such as: "You're so skinny now, are you not eating?" "Are you starving yourself?". Like bruhh it's destroying me q-q
Oh my god I can so relate to this 😭😭😭😭
Hey I have a question what made you do tattoos on your body ??
I'm a 13 year old mexican who is 5'9 and weights about 62kg is that skinny? Because i've been so skinny my entire fckn life lol
Most skinny People I meet are tall, why tf am I the only skinny short person ik. And I'm not skinny from choise, I just don't get weight no matter how much I eat.
It is still nothing compared to what fat shaming is! Being skinny is excepted and praised in the society, while being even slightly overweight is considered a huge flaw. When you gain weight people ask you are you pregnant, what happened? But when you lose weight, people praise you!
As a Skinny person, I can say for certain all of them are true-
I thought I was skinny but after that dance no thanks
My bad , just saw you in a swimsuit ! Thought you were a boy
I'm 210lbs I live in Alaska It's winter and I agree ,I was skinny till  Alaska .
My friend is a literal stick.
TvT this is to on point preach
you can't dance bcs ur white
I am the same 😂
My favorites were “omg ash where’d you go?”(after I turned sideways) or “I’m afraid to sneeze around you, you’d just fly away”  Both said by my male gymnastics coach
Yup clipin That last dance part
“I can’t dance”, that might be a you problem and not a skinny problem
We're opposite hahahaha 🤣
All flipping true (not the dancing part though, I mean I can't dance but still)
thats why being fat has more benefits
Im so skinny too and I do relate to this video
You can dance.
I don't lay down non my shest because I can feel the floor pushing on my ribs and that gap in-between and if feels so wired so I sleep on my side he'll I've masters sleeping on the school bus without lying down inlightly lean back agenst the corner of the saet and I just drowns off
I don’t really care about being skinny, all I know is I’m cracked at running
Can't relate to the others but people of all sizes can't dance
Lol I'm skinnier😫🤚
I can't dance either
As a little kid like 9 or 10 years old I was stuck at 70 something pounds I’m 16 now and weigh 129 pounds at my fattest I was 145 but just decided to loose weight lol
Relatable 😓
FINNALY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTAND
Oh my Gosh girl I'm with you when I was little I had where size 4 when I was 6
You should've mentioned wrist bands. My hands are skinny and I always have to push my watch up so it doesn't become lose on my wrist
I’m not like super skinny but I am so just sitting in class is a pain
All these are true
Ngl I don't think the dancing has anything to do with weight
As a fellow skinny person.... Can't dance for shit 😂
People say I am skinnyyyyyyyy but I am so stronggggggg
True
100% relatable for me
Relateable
Im skinny like u too
Same I can't dance either

Ive always been a relatively skinny guy but building muscle helps a lot.
i just can’t gain any weight, i’m 12 and 70 pounds
I might just be skinny because the last one is me
Bella, I think everybody can't dance. . .
That's probably better dancing than me 😄😂😪
Girl same:>
Yeessssss so true
Another skinny person problem for me is that I can’t get fat easily
So true
Her: I can’t dance Me: can barley do a jiggle jumpy thing
So true
Yes, I remember being called a pogo stick to the point I wanted to run away from my family, I am sensitive about how skinny I am, commenting on it makes me horribly upset. And my family knows that but doesn't care.
I am the same I get bullied for how skinny I am
Brahh!! You can dance!  At least as well as me...
Experience these problems as well good to know I’m not alone
I’d rather have these problems than the problems of a fat person
I am over weight  Mine is opposite
The sitting and the dance part is true!!! When skinny people dance is really weird!!! I'm an awesome dancer, but it always looks weird man😭😭
Same
Oh it gets cold reel quick.
So that's why my older sister has 4 blankets + why she gets sad about her body
YO SAMEEEEE
Bruh i can relate to all of this it sucks
So I was changing classes and as I was walking into math my teacher asked me “Did you eat lunch?”  When I was at lunch she was in line and STARED AT ME

I tried to eat a lot to gain some weight but I guess I got the same kinda metabolism as Shaggy from Scooby Doo.😅😅
Hey now don't blame your shitty dancing on the fact that you're thin ....come on now
Honestly
Don’t worry. Fat people can’t dance either.
Totally true ....that sitting down thing...cheeses that hurts. I never heard  anyone mention it ...but me

This is so true
AGREED

I hate the comments as well. I was shamed for being very skinny by my family and other people ever since I was 5
YES I’m not alone
The belt hits home
Yep skinny thats me…

I am over wait and I can’t dance

Are you  a boy or girl
I am literally fat and hairy yet I am still so cold like I’m a girl and I have the same amount of hair on my body as my brother
I agree with this
You dance better than me
I am 12 when I was 10 my grandfather said “why are you so skinny and skinny ppl are ugly and why are you so skinny go eat are you starving yourself”
Fax
The last part through, and thats me too
Same
Bikini Jayus though
When I lay down on a hard surface I almost instantly get an erection (._.)
Bruh stop cursing
Far people problems?
Nobody can do the last one
Yeahhh being fat is way worse…..
My wife has been 6'1, 125 pounds since she was 15. Had 4 kids, always went back to prior weight. She's getting ready to turn 48 and now weighs 145, all in the butt and gut...

INDEED I AM SKINNY
No but SEREUOSLY PEOPLE CIMINTING IS THE WORST LIKE WHY DINT YOU EAT WHY ARE YOU SKINNY
You got moves
Jayus I’m the same
It's better then calling yourself fat next too a chubby person (Experiece from seeing a skinny girl next to me in my math class poking her flat ass tummy calling herself fat- then when I called her out that she isn't fat- she looks perfectly fine then says I'm skinnier then her-HAAAA! Tell that to my tummy that sticks out like Santa and my fucking wide body girlie 😂😂😂)
I have a friend who's 6ft 7 and only 50kg
true..
You cute tho
I have the same fucking problem lol
Im 12 years old and my family keeps reminding me of my skininess which makes me hurt... One time my dad told me "ur so skinny" all of a sudden during a vc then I just hid my face and tears started falling from my eyes... I told him I dont want to be skinny and cant control my weight and i just didn't show my face or even speak to him for the rest of the after that vc...
Too skiny or to fat you should be perfect
That's me xd
I’m skinny and those are problems for me.
I WAS 66 POUNDS AT THE AGE OF 7
What was the last dance the chameleon
I feel your pain but no the cool
WTF THIS IS A GIRL
Trust me, I know. I am 6”6 at 15. So I have hade skinny issues. But what I have learned is that just eating does not help has all of it is spent on growing. What you need to do is workout a lot.  Because then you will at least get some muscle’s.
I don’t think the dancing has to do with your Weight
No disrespect but what type of dancing is that😅
I experienced all of them. I’m 95lb at 25yrs old
Its worse for fat people.....
I guess fat and thin peoples have many things in common....  Just fat peoples cant poke new holes in belts.
I learned the Kazotsky kick and im skinny lmao
Me too. I'm 15, 6'3 BUT LOOK LIKE A FUCKING STRAW
0:01

Can we get some tips to gain weight maybe?
The last one Is just a you problem.
Oh those are some serious problems

Same dude. All I ever do is try to lay down, be warm, EVEN SIT DOWN!
Just so you know in future it can be quite triggering to show a scale on camera for people who have have issues with eating in the past
Not rude just saying love ur dancing moves
Meanwhile:  Bts: are we joke?
*im basically malnourished.*
Yup
U can dance how you dance girl
Same here
As a thicc person there are way more problems than that
I used to think she's he before watching this video
And then after you got meat on you they start saying your fat a tell you to eat salad and it just starts going on on on until youve had enough and tell
Totally felt the last one :/
I’m so skinny It’s also True😂
Right  am skinny
Yes I’m skinny too and these are all true
Funny how skinny people start to be vocal about their weight problems, and when i was a skinny kid i had those problems too...but now i am only concerned about getting too overweight and i really want to be skinny again...i never felt insecure being skinny as i am now being a little overweight.. We should stop being insecure about weight...
Ikr I hate that
Oh gosh the dancing traumatized me😂
So trueee
Yeah im constantly called a twig it dose really hurt but I just push it off
Thank u  That dance made my day
I can’t ruin it for lesbians
Not only skinny she is sooo talllll!!!!
Being skinny and tall is actually frustrating to me-
I obviously don’t have a bad life in any way. But as a 23 year old male who’s 118 pounds, waist size is a 26 and my leg length is a 30, I to this day can’t buy pants from America if I don’t want to tailor them lol. And to this day everyone tells me I should just eat more, when they don’t know I shove food down my throat like it’s nothing.😂
I are like my mirror but female
What do you mean you definitely can dance
You play basketball????
Are u a boy or a girl I can't find out when I started watching u like a month ago...
I'm skinny but after nonstop eating nickado avocado mukbang routine I'm 62kg /j
No dance skills ain't a skinny problem.. it's just a rhythm thang
you cant dance but you can say the nword😎
Relatable
In the videos I’ve watched I’ve never once thought about your weight  Weird
I am skinny and ppl don't think about these things
I can tell fucking skinny why the hell does         Am I so fucking skinny
2,4,6 kinda everyone problem
Ya im so skinnyyy🤸🏻‍♀️🏋🏻‍♀️
When she tried to dance she kinda looked like my parents
Боже, бедняжка, она худая, вот блять беда то.
The way in wich you put the blanket on is just like me on a Saturday morning.
Being 6’2” and 145 pounds I can relate
True hsha
Onlyjayus: I can't dance Me: wana go?
Society was be like bro worst thing I I was worried with the mental breakdown I had
All of these happen to me  And I especially can’t dance….
That dance was funny tho
All true. When I'm on holidays with family ( December time) when they cook something I would eat some cuz they would dish up ALOT and when I don't finish they'll say "why r u so skinny r u on a diet" or "you must eat cuz you're skinny" but I eat alot but instead I grow taller and before my ribs did show but now they kinda don't anymore. The dance part I'm getting better at it
Ok but isn’t she ableist and racist.
kpop idols at the last part be like: 🤨
Can’t dance she says.. she seem to be boogieing hard over der 💃🕺💃🕺
That satanic ritual and the end pretty scary ngl
Thats me when i dance
Can’t dance is not a problem if you just have a fun time doing it
You’re 67 pounds??
I'm very skinny and well most of those are true and I get colder EVERY MINUTE
This is so frickin' true
As a person with fucking no meat on my body every time I go on rids I fucking float out of the seat if im  not held in place so I don't rid them ...😂
After watching that dancing part I just wanna throw my phone
Skinny for life here.
I hate the belt one so muchhh
Yeah same problem
last fact is misleading
Definitely the wrong song to try to catch a rhythm 🥁 Lmaoo
She:i cant dance Me: cassualy doing breakdance windmills at an age of 12
If she can’t dance I really can’t fkn dance because she has better moves than me and my uncle at a party combined
Same
My brother has the same thing
🤣🥰
I am supposed to be 63 kg but I'm 36
I can relate
True specially when sitting down for too long
Bruh I'm 11 and Im 60 kg 😶
I CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING MORE RELATABLE THAN THIS 😭
My cousin who is 19 is the SKINNIEST person in my family! Like she's just skin and bones. But she is incredibly healthy and is the best dancer I have ever seen she loves TikTok and sometimes dances with her younger sister who is 14.
Wait ur a girl???
I can't dance either, sweet shoes though 😁
Omg this is what I get every fucking time!
the belt with new holes is my live. 🤣
Don't worry i am skinny as fuck to
I don't think your Dancing Abilities have anything to do with your weight...it had everything to do with you being white tho lmao
Wood shop with metal stools as a skinny person is fucking hellish
I was pretty skinny during elementary but I finally filled out around high school. I hated getting called skinny and I even cried when I got home whenever someone made fun of me. Now in high school one of my best friends is really skinny, just like me in elementary, and I feel bad for him because people always make mean comments about his weight, just like they used to do to me. I forgot what the disorder is called, but people always say that he had the disorder that makes you not eat. The thing is he super tall… like 5’10 in grade 8, so idk. It’s harder to gain weight as a kid because ur still like growing and stuff.
Im a musician and you dance better than I do. That and my aunt is a semi pro ballroom dancing type. Not dancing kills her about me.
"go get meat on your bone" im pretty sure someone going to make it out of context
I'm skinny and I'm never cold. Like never
These are all very true, as a person with metabolism faster than the flash I can confirm it hurts to roll on the floor
Dam bruh didnt know eating is that hard
Oh my God I'm gonna do the same but for fat people...    My sink broke and I had to have stitches.
I mean I’m only 10 but pretty much all of those things happen to me. I can’t dance, I’m very cold, and my tail bone always hurts when I sit down
You CAN dance, now can you dance WELL is subjective
I can't gain weight easily, for example I've tried to gain at least 2 pounds in 2 months, I got skinnier instead.
Your a gurl, I have been trying to figure it out for 3 months
You are perfect
Yeah they say, oh I cam see your ribs, or your bones, and now that covid has got me eating more I just get fat in the torso stomach area, I thought that shit evens out, I thought it would go to my buttocks so when I sit it doesn't hurt my bones. Or arms so I cam lean on desk to type, some cushioning for my bones. Not
I'm glad I'm thick.
I am incredibly skinny and just sitting hurts the tail bone thing
Same
I’ll still smash
Absolutely.
I Feel You Pain I'm Skiny AF too
😂
My friend and I'm only 9 but she said (your gonna die)now who says that...but I actually do get blown in the wind sometimes not gonna lie.
I'm called a 2 by 4
The last dance looked like it was from Charlie Brown
EXACTLY! I was super skinny and now I'm in the 7th percentile for weight, but when I was in 3rd grade I was 38lbs. and people would say "Aw, we don't want you to blow away. It's windy today."
It's the worst one of you have leather belts. So hard to poke the holes😭
It's so fucked up for someone to tell you to eat a burger- that'd be like someone walking up to me and saying to eat a salad (I am the exact opposite of skinny)
JESUS FUCK YOUR A GROWN ASS WOMAN AT 66 POUNDS???? THAT WAS MY WIEGHT AT LIKE 9
I'm thick but skinny I'll get a pair of pants that fit my legs and but and then be like 2 sizes to big for my waist
EVERYBODU DANCR NOW
tbh i am skinny asf and i do competitive dancing and have a solo but nothing fits me and i am rlly tall soooooooiiiioo
Im litterly so skinny this happends to me too like all my friends they are like why are you so skinny i can barely hold you go eat meat or something
Wind acually blows me over though...
Find a solution for usss! I tried training myself to eat more calories without getting sick but like thats a very temporary weight gain solution
Her/they: i just got in a healthy weight this ye-  Me: the scale said 66-67 pounds-
they’ve got skinny people problems but no problem being racist lol
Can't dance that's just a you problem
We are the same
This is so realitable to me😂
All my sister called me when I was growing up is a twig and she still calls me it to this day, at this point I just learned to roll with it
Ik damn i hate being skinny
I am exactly like you
The clothes my relatives buy are always too big and they say "Oh, it'll tighten up in the dryer
Skinny gang were ya at Btw I'm so skinny that I can can see my guts in my feet I'm scared 😂
The fifth one is a you problem I am sorry to say this 😔
Same, even though i eat more than my fat friends
Same!!
As a skinny person I had to suffer this ;^;
I don't think dancing is a skinny problem but a you problem that I can relate to
Get in to it yeas
People mess with me cause I'm fat soooo
Add being 4'11 5 ft on top of being skinny 🤣. I still get the comments and shit.
This makes me happy 😊
I'm pretty sure that last one is on him
Loved the dancing!!😋
Raletable
She still can dance but than again I'm skinny ad too

I don't know why but my ribs starts to hurt if I lie down like that in no 2
U dance a lot better than me
I hate the cold
I'm short
I can relate
Same and it’s true
Omg i relate to all of these
I used to be so skinny that people thought I was anorexic but I just had a high metabolism and then when I turned 20 my metabolism slowed down super fast and I gained so much weight where people said I looked pregnant and obese. People used to say put meat on your bones and then I did but apparently it was too much.
I wish i was skinny
This always happens
I’m 9 and heavier the 66 pounds lol
WAIT HILY SHT YOURE SAYTIN THST MY ASS BONES HURT BECAUSE I SIT DOWN AND THEN HGET UP? SHITTTT HOW COULDNT I NOTICE
Im not skinny  And Can’t dance So it might be you (Again I’m not skinny and I know a lot of people who are skinny and can dance)
honestly as someone who really struggles to eat properly, those comments are the worst
Are you a girl or boy
I can relate I'm not just small for a teen but also skinny and the dance part at the end was hilarious it gave me tears😂
Don't blame being skinny on not having any groove homie....
Me to
Agreeable, I’m a freshman and I weight around 80 pounds
I had a friend who was a stick and she was still a good dancer
Facts🤷🏾
Is it bad that she's a better dancer then me lol and I wish I was like her.  Me: 11 AND OVER 100 pounds 😭😶😐
The things I hate your to skinny eat I burger your to fat stop eating just make up your frickin mind and stop that literally someone like me just a bit chubby people tell me to stop eating and I did then they told me to eat more like what the heck
Smae here every thing aspechily laying down and stitting and cold
Sorry, I can’t relate, I’m 20 pounds over weight. The worst of both worlds is the insults
Last one fake
I know exactly how you feel
Did not ask
I also can’t dance- and I’m fat as fuck (I’m a female and  5’1 and 185 LBS just think about that )
Society: "You're too skinny" Me: ok *begins eating more food and gains a little weight* Also society: *you're too fat*
I've lost a LOT of weight and am starting to realize these problems lmao. Im so cold 24/7 and im not even skinny, I'm like medium-sized. None of my pants or belts fit either 💀and I've always sucked at dancing
Society.... story of my life 😭
I can't dance either
Clean up your dirty mouth!! And you'll be fine💖
As a skinny person this is fact I just saying to them that I have fast metabolism
God, I love your weird🤣🤣🤣
Relatable
Can relate
I can’t dance um not so sure that is why
You dance good I guess...  have a good day
U remind me of my friend
please i feel this, i swear any time i lean or sit on a bony area (wrist, knees, butt, elbows, ankles, shoulders) it hurts so bad!  I can barely wear watches and  belts. and pants never ever fit me!
I do that belt thing and it passes my mum off because I don't own belts so i use hers
You can dance better than half my school
I just figured out you are a girl bc you sound like a boy
As a person who was 50 pounds at twelve years old, I feel you, I was really skinny because of my adhd and the medication I take :(
The sitting down part is sooo accurate
Why are all of these so true🤣
No that just u try to break dance
Hi 👋
Facts I’m skinny
I can never forget her racist comments,every time I look at her that’s all I can think about
I’m always freezing
I am so skinny
Same hear
True dat I am 12 and I am 61 pounds.
Okay that last one is a lie, those moves be sick
The dancing part was actually the most funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Im a kid and i cant gain weight and people say add meat to my bones BUT I CANT BC NO FOOD MAKES ME FATTER
The clothes thing is the worst!! Like yes I love being skinny but having to punch in a million holes to get the right fit is THE WORST.
Downfalls to having too much meat it's hard for you to get up out of bed gets super hot in the summer but nice and warm in the winter occupants can't fit you anymore
Yeah, these are some big problems...
Now Ik why my class wants to keep the window open while I'm freezing They're like "it's an ok temperature" While I'm there freezing in the corner
I'm super skinny and when scuba diving I get so incredibly cold I start shaking uncontrollably, dangerous
When you started dancing  Why did I think of voyd from incredibles 2 😅
I cant dance but i aint skinny
Omg the pants problem is so freaking annoying. Like I just want straight jeans but they always have a weird round shape (like the fabric sticking out at the side) and I don’t have hips. So then I use belts but I have like a million different holes for different jeans.  Thanks for making this video
My bestie is cold every day every second of her life like bbbbrrruuuuuhhhhh
Ur the best girly I alway watch you never change yourself and alway eat!❤️❤️💓💓
I get called a twig 🙂 on the daily
The dancing one sounds like a white people problem
Dude SAME
Why do I agree- MaYbE bEcAuSe I gO tHrOuGh ThE sAmE tHiNgS!!
Nice dancing no defense
Loosing weight cause you're cold all the time so you get more cold and loose more weight
Is that 66.4 or 664
All of them same but dance THEM SOME GOOD DANCE MOVES
U got some moves sheeeeesh
Ask me dancing
idk about the freezing part, i usually go around in my t shirt/vest around 5° even tho my IMC is under average, and my friends who have a bigger weight than I do, freeze at that temperature
The last one was so funny
“Everybody do the spaghetti noodle”
So true I just be outside and my hands be fucking purple in the winter and everyone else around be like this is fine
I am the same exact way except for the fact. That I literally can't gain weight if my life depended on it
Onlyjayus: i cant dance BC ik skinny   Charli damilio:😶
Me either
YEAH AGREED
I’m skinny af but I don’t get cold And I wear summer shorts and a t-shirt WHEN ITS 0-1 DEGREES Celsius
Some of my friends call me skinny and I see a lot of people they are not as thin/skinny as me I guess I can relate
I am 55 and this is my life...lol
Haha I'm 73 pounds at 13 😋😋
My parents say the same thing YOU NEED TO EAT OR YOUR GOING TO BREAK INTO LITTLE PEAKSIS
fax
I used to wear a diving suit in swimming class because it was so cold!
I do soooooo agreee!!!
This is true
I feel you I'm skinny to 🥲
Dan sing is your problim
Fat people problems, told by a fat person. 1.- Cardiac problems 2.- You probably have diabetes      3.- Can't dance 4.- Society lmao
Dancing better than me
I have been dancing in eight years so I’m pretty good but I’m very skinny. Before I got very many comments about it and I hate it.
We are same
Trueeeeeeee
Jayus I think it'd just you who can't dance
Yeah it dose hurt sitting and laying
Are you a girl or boy
Skinny people struggles 🥲
True as fuck i am so fucking thin people are annoying me and   just saying eat something
Facts
Ayo I’m not alone
It is funny, I need to buy new jeans every year because I keep growing taller but when I buy bigger jeans it feels like they're gonna fall with every move I make if I don't wear a belt lmao
You're telling me that you cannot dance you're only lying to yourself you did just fine to me I'm the one who looks like I've got a corncob stuck up my ass
Me being a fucking stick man is even worse
Wait i thought you were male
I am not skinny i just donated my flesh 😌
Thanks…. You made it… the vid that discribes my live… thanks…!
This is so true
I love you 😗💗😁
Nice move 😆👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥
I feel u like i can see my bones but its couse of my condition so i cant control it
It's so true😁
I am male and 1.90 cm and 67 kg and I can say that I am cold all the time and I have made several holes in my belt. And I eat normally and I simply don’t gain weight.
U cant dance cause u white
This is currently happening to me
Can’t relate. Ate a piece of bread and gained 0.5 kg (true story)
Yup but at same time your gorgeous af
Relatable, but the good thing is I can fit through tight spaces🤓
Nah you're normal I'm skinny too but I traveled outside America and I realized I'm just a normal sized person who lives in a country that normalizes being fat asf.
Thats me....
The part where society tells you that you’re skinny is too relatable for me. I’ve had friends and family and even other people around me telling me that I’m skinny af. i’m fully aware of this as i’m basically living in this boney state of mine for almost 10 years now, so I’m also aware that my metabolism is genetic. I also wanna gain weight, but it’s hard no matter how much I eat. I’ve also tried eating junk foods but they’re of no help at all. Also tried eating as much, 3x a day and still no changes after a few months. I don’t even wanna think about doing the exercises as well, let alone doing something simple as push-ups. i just feel like I would become even skinnier or gain muscle, but still look skinny as a result. Guess i gotta wait a little bit longer for some actual physical changes to my body
Wait everyone doesn't feel pain after sitting?
Now Iam fine but I used to be skinny it's relatable.except that cold one
yes yes yes
I’m still a pre teen but I only weigh 95lbs and it drives me CRAZY especially since I NEVER STOP EATING but I still never gain weight 😭✌️
I am the same!
me who’s skinnier than her-
So true
My PROBLEMS
HI
RELATABLE 😭🤚
Yeah i get those problems. But i am healthy now, That was the past.   bro what u talkin abt, Your good at dancing, Your better than me...Who needs months to learn a dance •-•
I'm also skinny af
ALL true we cant do anything sadly
People always used to scold anyone who touched me because I was apparently too fragile or delicate 😑
😂😂 I feel you girl, I feel you!
I mean ppl in asia (in my case where I live) skinny ppl are always the one getting sum *insert lenny face* and I’m not lying when a guy who looks like a twig (no offence) got chicks for days 🤦‍♂️
I'm fat af and I'm always cool
yes i get this allllllllllllllll the time. like people genuinely get pissed at me for being so cold. and then they tell to me eat as if i don’t eat enough
ITS SO TRUE I WAS AS THIN F*CKING
I'VE GOT ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AND HOW DO I GET OVER EM OMG
This is so true
The only benefit of being a fat ass couch potato is that I get cold harder than most people
SOOO TRUUUEEEE!!!!!
Bro my grandmother used to always say that to me q q
So true especially when the people are like get fat don’t you eat and I know this because I am thin
Don't worry I'm skinny
WNBA TO TEACHING PSYCHOLOGY FAC
man my sister is as skinny as you would ever be lol
Relatable i am a 10 year old who actually is pretty skinny unlike skinnier than you sometimes i get those comments to
How to be fat?
People call me a stick bug,walking stick,stick figure and, chicken bone
I am also skinny
WHAT PEOPLE SAY YOU CANT DANCE
FINALLY SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING ON THIS! And we do eat a lot but we stay skinny
So true
Im SKINNY as a belt and can dance TREMENDOUSLY
Relatable or waaaaaat
I'm skinny
Tru
Onlyjayus:I can't dance ME: I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING EXEPT THE LAST PART I DANCE SO WELL....OHHHHH YEAHHH
I'm skinny Af and the laying down thing is really really hurtful
Can’t relate! 😂
You can't dance?? Try listening to zenon or fullon nighttime
Im skinny but i still give big people a hard time in arm wrestling, either they are HELLA weak or im strong
That's how I dance
Dancing like that so funny
i am so skinny can relate
You forgot about how every watch falls off
How the FVCK are you FVCKING 66.5 pounds I'm 11 and I'm 140.6
the family comments you get is insane 😭, if you gain weight they are like “you have gotten fatter” and if you are skinny they are like “you look like a bamboo” “do you even eat” “you should eat” and when you reach normal weight they won’t even give a compliment or something 😭 this society is so messed up. Worst part of being skinny is that when you tell your family that you just don’t eat a lot as you get full easily they think you’re lying trying to act like “I’m built skinny”
Same 👹
R u a boy or girl😂😂
Society😞 why am only a kid.
“I CANT DANCE!” I think that’s more of a *you* problem
Can fat people and skinny people just meet up and trade some  weight or smtin
Are a girl or boy you look like a girl
I love your dancing🥰😂
💯💯💯
“Your belts doesn’t fit” THIS IS TO MUCH OF A PROBLEM FOR MEE
The 4th and 5th is me.
LMAO THESE ARE FR!!
Dude I can inhale 4 burgers and not agin weight
Your dance is hilarious
This is me.
Ye me too
All of these are relatable
I'm skinny and short so I can relate to all of these
Same
The most relatable shit
I feel u
My butt got bruised at my pelvic butt bones from sitting.. no natural cushion
Uhm relatable
Relate
yeah i feel it
It's the same thing for overweight  ppl they tell you oh go exercise oh go get new clothes bla bla 😑
EXACTLY
Same people say thing like that to me
I would consider myself skinny I try to put some fat in my body but it’s literally impossible, I don’t have problems with sitting down however it doesn’t hurt my ass since for some reason I have a huge ass as a male
honestly I'm skinny. And I get these comments from my friends and family they say is, "Have you eaten anything?!", "Omg you have become so skinny the last I saw you" etc. Like I tried to eat alot but nothing happens the only difference that comes is my cheeks becoming chubby. Like I tried to eat and I exercise so then my body can be healthier, I was freaking born like this! How the heck am I supposed to change my body FOR THEM!? like I want to be myself and I dont want to change for others opinion.
This is so relatable
That’s probably why my sister can’t dance
All of these are relatable, even the can't dance one
All of this is true I hate being skinny
i’m a ballerina so.. (also i don’t have a eating disorder)
Me and my fat ass can't dance either.
I feel you😮‍💨
Have y’all ever thought about fat people and how they wish they could be skinny?
Im fat… sitting still hurts mah but bones
No matter how much we eat we never gain weight 😭
Hey atleast your tall
Facts literally all theses things happen to me
I feel you I’m 12 and I’m 70 pounds and very skinny I relate to all of these even the comments it awful 😢
Only Javus is hot
Her: can't dance Lisa: hold my beer
This was me all my life up until 3 years ago when I decided to start working out
100% understand you
Ah that explains why I'm not effected by the cold, I fat af, Also rhe last one isn't just a skinny problem
Number 5 is so annoying my friends call me skiny bones and tell me to eat more :(
You dance good and no worries at least ur the one getting through the small opening in the wall when everyone else is stuck to be eaten by zombies don't shame ur size bro ur still awesome
Pro gamer moves
Most people call me a rather skinny fuck
This is me everyday and I'm only in middle school
Just eat food
Skinny person here laying in my bed, I have four blankets
I think the dance part is just you
This just brought back so many memories now I'm sad again I'm 37 and I've been the same size since I was 16 even after two pregnancies I'm actually probably smaller
This makes sense for me
I know the feeling mate I'm skinny ass fuking hell I wish you could see what I looked like like im down to the bone snd I have 50 or more Bruce's on my ribs I have no jeans that fit so I wear sweats I eat all the time I can dance tho but I run out of breath to fast I play baseball and I hit a homer but broke my arm doing ut
I think the last on is a personal for her
I think the dance was a you problem
You weigh 66 pounds I weigh 82 pounds and I'm literally 8 😳!
Uhhh I don’t think you can dance
I can relate so much
5. Me when someone tells me to eat more: I FRICKIN STUFF MYSELF WITH BURGERS WHEN I GO OUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN EAT MORE I'VE TRIED!!!
What I hate about society is they shame you for being skinny and shame you for not being skinny enough
well i am skinny and i know how it felt
Thats honestly been a mood for my whole life
You also can't have a double chin
Same thing here do not worry my grandma like ; go eat smthing ! WOMAN I JUST HAD A LARGE FRIES AND A 20 PIECES NUGGET AND A LARGE FRAPPE CARAMEL….
That’s funny cause my best friend is super skinny and she’s a competitive dancer
Why do match all of that
I can relate to the belt one…     but with my wrist.
As a really skinny person I can agree about all of these
God loves you repent for the kingdom of God 🛼💕❤️🪅🍁🎋🥀
I can relate to this I only weigh 110
The fact that you’re 66 pounds and I am 87 pound but I am 10 years old.      🤔
The can't dance part me that's a you problem
Her:I CaNt DaNcE! No one: her better at dancing then me-😭
I do all of those things except the skinny shaming thing but that’s beacause Iam not skinny
So r u saying fat people can dance 🕺
Gender?
Agree with all of these
Same
4,5,6 are basically the same thing for fat people like me but in a different way
Well I can’t dance that well
These are all so true like my parents would always comment on me being skinny when well i have a fast metabolism so gaining weight is hard and they wonder why I’m always in a blanket and in my head i just think,” mate do you think i have fat” also i suck at dancing but doesn’t really seem to be a problem for us twigs
Best option, eat like 2600-3100calories  and protein powder and work out, went from 120 to 170 and I'm buff now
Omg this is soo relating cuz I’m so skinny
ay same
Im skinny bc im allergic to any animal product (milk eggs meat ect) and it suckssss  1 yess 2 yess my friend whos also rlly skinny broke a rib doing that 3 YESS im constantly freezing 4 SUCH A STRUGGLE 5 I HATE PPL 6 i look like a limp spaghetti noodle trying to dance
Please don't say God's name in vain ma'am
Bruh yeah,I’m 92lbs and I’m 15…
Not to be rude, but the dancing has me wheezing! 😂
The struggle is real ... my belt leaves bruises on hips 😪😪😪
Definitely relatable 😍😍😍
I'm not even skinny and I have these problems9
You can dance
I would rather be skinny than fat. I grew up really skinny, now I'm just overweight. I feel disgusting
i’m skinny too, and ppl have literally said to my face “do your parents feed you?!” i mean a lot of people only think of fat shaming, but skinny shaming exists and it’s just as bad
You can certainly dance better then me
I skinny
I have the the same things happen but I don’t think I’m that skinny but guess not
“I can’t dance” * proceeds to show off the most amazing dance moves I have ever seen in my life*
SAME
I’m skinnier than you and I’m 23
OK stop saying bad words oh I’m not trying to be mean it’s just you cannot say that on TickTock I’m not saying that I’m the boss of you I’m just trying to say that I am only 7 years old
Yes. Lol
"just eat lol"
Finally the facts 👏 🙌 💯 I've been told this and I'm like i can't help it and no belts fit so I have to get like the 2 year olds belts also can't dance always carrying a blanket on me throughout the house
All accurate,except the dancing!! I can kill some dancing!! I've don't it for like 7yrs!
Relatable, I’m also skinny as f(!)ck. All those, so relatable.
I don’t think the dance thing is about you being skinny

This is going to sound fake and something out of a cartoon but the other day I was in my P.E class and there was a strong wind and the wind literally PUSHED ME I almost FALL!! Of how skinny I am 😃😔
Skinny people probs
5. My grandma always talked about this but she meant it in a nice way
Same but no one cares 😭
All of these are relatable
As someone who just lost a fuck tonne of weight after being in hospital for a long time I feel most all of this except I could never dance
Me too 😅
im skinny and somehow always skinny even when i eat a lot of food
i’m a kid and THATS LITERALLY MY WHOLE LIFE
No wonder. No wonder why my hands get so cold they feel numb. No wonder why my friends hands are warm.
I dont think cant dance is a skinny people problem
Huh I didnt know I am skinny now
We can switch I'm fat as hell
Ima so skinny to, no matter how much I eat i don't gain wight.
I can't dance to
I feel that so hard like I hate being skinny like even if I just breathe in you can really see the outline of my ribs usually I shouldn’t be weighing less than 70 pounds at the age of 12 like I bet I weigh about like 60 pounds so I feel house people feel the pain
that last one 😞
I am really thankful from our bring this up. Lol I have been told to just shut up when I say this. My family members called me anorexic along with other things. So thanks it makes me feel better that I am not the only one
Could have done it without you’re bones flopping everywhere
Facts
don’t feel alone I am also SKINNY AS FUCK
I'm a little on the plus side I wish I was skinny
Luv you onlyjayus
Oh my god yes
Her: I can't dance *starts dancing* Me: you really can't dance *dying laughing*🤣🤣
even laying face down for a couple seconds hurts my ribs so bad bro it gives me heart palpitations
My uncle used to tell me I was to skinny when I visited him and would try to get me to eat more
The can’t dancing has nothing to do with your skinniness
I'm glad I'm not the only one lol
5.Society I used to be very thin when I was small they always said those things And now in Healthy so now they are saying loose weight like WT@%#%%
Fine asf 🔥
Tall as fuck too
U can dance
You can't dance because you will distroy the dance floor with them epic moves 😎
Atleast your not fat. Listen, sure, you can get hurt easier. But being fat makes you a social outcast. Never had a partner and am constantly harassed at school for it. Besides, it's easier, at least for me, as a once skinny kid, to get fat.
I remember wanting to train to get some muscles as I was practically just spaghetti limbs. However, as a super skinny teen, people just kept commenting on how I "didn't need to loose weight" and it really killed all my motivation for working out... I just wanted to gain some strength and maybe a bit of bulk... Also, my life changed the moment I discovered holeless belts! No more poking holes in belts or needing a new belt every year or two, just because the homemade hole got too loose as it wasn't reinforced with anything.
I can relate that
How many times did she say the f word
I'm chubby and I can't dance
Lucky your skinny
as a twig i agree to all except the dancing
But them dance moves though 💀💀😂😂
I loved your giraffe videos Jayus
Yasss relatable
It’s better to try to gain muscle’s they add weight 😇
I'm aware I have high metabolism
THE END HAS MY DYING 💀💀
The dancing at the end 🤣🤣
I used to be that skinny it's awful
I think being fat is worse made fun  of way more😭
Then what about the people who aren't skinny?! We are all beautiful are we fat or some shit?
Girl, you look amazing!:)
Whahahaha more wholes in the belt, same here😂
To be completely honest sometimes I feel my self getting pushed by the wind
Same
Omg same!! So many people would say the same. In dinners, eat eat eat you need it, after I ate enough.
At least you have better moves than me and im not skinnie
I fealt that
Would you rather be fat or skinny
Why the f is she 66 pounds
The dance thing is a Jayus problem
I'm super skinny also I'm the same ur not alone
Same for all
Skinny gang hello
My friend is hella skinny she just do these things all the time
I wanna be a skinny legend
YESS
Its fine socially coz many are jealous and also makes you look younger than you are , they also want to be you in some cases  But personally it very difficult especially wen you are aging. I nvr forseen this Retaining nutrition is difficult coz we burn too quick, thats how it works,  and i can't keep hogging all the time and my healthy eating habits is worsening it 😂😂 y me ! Underweight alwz and aging is restircting it further making me look even more sick and skinny. Definitely not good as you age m experiencing malnutrition and degrading  health I am loosing my energy and fats functioning quicker than anybody can think. What people experience  in their 50's myt be, i am already experiencing it in my late 30s. You can't give excuses u know. It cannot go on for too long for me. I am helpless coz its genetic.
I have skinny deseace that has no cure.
I'm still underweight but not as much as I use to be-
GIRL THATS ME
People say some of these things to me all the time bro lol
The best comments I got were: ‘ I really wanna be skinny! Oh, just not that skinny *poking fingers at my stomach*’ ‘Where are your organs?´ Can I mesure your waist? *trying to mesure with their hands* Have you tried eating?  And the f*ed up part is that everyone thinks that they are just being funny by mocking your weight, because we all know that by the end of the day *being skinny* (for some reason) is beauty standard, so it’s okay to make fun of it
Do you play volleyball?
I'M GLAD SOMEONE SAID THE COLD THING LIKE OMG
Oh mah gawdddddd number 4 I'm dead 🤣🤣🤣 How relatable
Girl your a great dancer
Facts
Same😭
I’m so skinny when I stretch you can see every bone
Evribadi kica 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵😏😏😏😏😏😏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥴🥴🥴😮😯😮😮🥴🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑😤😤😤😤👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👎👎👎👎👎⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️👹👹👹👹👹👹😯😯😯😯
I know how this feels I'm really skinny. I can reach under my ribs just a little
I've been fat all my goddamn life People are always like loose weight to me And I always want to be skinny..but idek at this point anymore I just want to be right size-
Oh oh , you look like my popsicle when i burn it a little and try to shake it off.
That's better than me actually.
Im skinny and i feel the same
Facts people always say things like that
We should always be grateful for what we have, at least you have something
I feel your pain. Just skinny af for no reason at all. I’m 37 so I’m going to guess I’m done growing and I’m not going to get any bigger. Guess I’m just meant to be skinny
Xd same at this point i just laugh
me: not skinny, but friends call me anorexic
Now im happy im fat ass fvck
Can you stop cursing
I'm not skinny I'm pretty robust but I can't dance either. PS. Your dancing moves was way better than mines 😂
That picture in the swim suit though 😳 sheeeeeesshh
Yeah
Im literally 20 lbs underweight i can relate
One rule to try and combat this,  Never waste any food, ANY  That's what I grew up with anyway, and I'm now on the mid range of average weight
Chicken hairy leeeeeeeegs
I can relate
Why isn’t she in a music video yet
FINALLY THE PAIN I ATE SO MUCH AND EVERYONE SAID I LOOK LIKE I SYARCE
At least someone is like me
Mmm mood
Hehe thats y im doubke cheecked up
As a skinny person I relate alot 😂
Truthhhhh
I have the same problems 😊
I know right (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
Facts
Im skinny and i can dance. I can kinda do moonwalk
I’m skinny just like that too. I do online school at home and I have to lay in my bed whenever I can cuz my chair hurts my ass if I sit in it too long. I also can’t lay on the ground too long or my chest starts hurting and I’m always cold.
Litterly me
Same shit for me ur not only one
Girl same
Jayus: I can't dance   Me:you dace better than me *screams *aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You would probably fit in Korean beauty standard
I'm skinny af
Everything is except for the dance I can dance but everything else are true
I relate to this so freaking much and I finally came to healthy weight too last year.
Being skinny doesn't make you a bad dancer lol.
As a 64 pound 11 year old I can relate
Nice dance moves~
My hands were too small and i can grab it just like i grab sticks
As a person with fast metabolism and is skinny as fuck i can relate
Felt this  I'm a 15 yo who weighs 110, if that. And all I hear is you need to eat, thsts why you're so skinny, but thats not true. I have a really high metabolism and every time I eat a lot, it does nothing to my wight. I'm now trying to work out and gain muscle, which adds weight to your body.
I swear to god…how true is that!! I have gone through all this
I'm happy that I'm not the only one who has these problems
Me too I am also too skinny
Facts!!!!
I can't dance eather
And you get called lanky
Was that 66kg or 66lbs? Cause if it's the latter then that's really too low and extremely dangerous. It's gotta be kg
Same
I’ve been both skinny af and fat af. Lemme tell you, it’s way easier being skinny af 😂
Yes, I am extremely skinny, not too skinny to make it a problem but pretty skinny.
You literally stole words from my mouth😂😂😂 All hail skinny people 😂😂
My skinny self watching this video who has been skinny my whole life even though I eat a lot of food
Thank you so much for number 5
God bless😎❤️
Healthy weight? I'm not sure but that phone is really heavy if you look at that scale
I've fallen for this gal 😂💚
So true
Same with me
I get commented to get lean when I get fat then said to become fat again when I get a wee bit slimmer life is a cycle
Y'all have no idea how badly l want to be skinny
Soo true
You shouldn't say the good lord name in vain its not right
Your still  beautiful
My bros and i were all skinny. They were and they are struggling to lose some weight now. I think it's genetic bcs our parent were skinny when they were young. Me? I never even hit more than 50kg in my life. I never try to lose weight😬 even my aunt comment that she will gain so much weight if she eat like me. I'm abt 48-50kg now. It's good for me bcs you don't know how much i want this weight since i was in highschool😭 i'm 25 now
I couldn’t relate to anything as much as this
I am soooo skinny and I struggle with alll these problems and I eat double burgers like EVERY DAY
True
I have all these problems like wtf create a new society for skinny people 😑
THATS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. MY SIBLINGS ARE LIKE THIS EVERYTIME. EVEN MY DADS FRIENDS ARE TELLING ME TO EAT MOR EOR FORCE ME 😤😤😭😭
Hugs 🤗
Im skinny as a kid but growing up change it im bulk now 😂😅
My whole 21 years of life has been poisoned by people skinny shaming me. From my bio teacher saying my vag won't stretch to my ex saying my b00bs aren't big enough. People speculate i have some disease( i don't, i have a high metabolism) , guys have implied and some indirectly said i'm bot attractive enough bc i don't have much b00bs or butt. Friends always making fun of me bc i am skinny, all skin and bones, i'll be blown away by wind, i look like a baby & no body would say i'm 21. The first thing strangers would say why do i look like a child, why do i don't look 21???  One ex friend told me to my face i'm not beautiful and made her bf tell me i'm not beautiful, she would too poke fun at me all the time for being skinny. And let's not even talk about the countless unsolicited b.s. food and health advice given by strangers, family, teachers, parent's office colleagues and friends. One time i bought a sheer dress and was very excited to wear it bc it looked so good but my mom bullied me saying i look sick and bony in it so i couldn't wear it. And on top of all these people especially the ones that get fat shammed invalidate my experiences and say skinny shaming isn't a thing, and it's not as bad as fat shaming,i'm looking for attention. the same people that get body shamed for being fat instead of understanding my struggles better shame me for being skinny .
I can think of something else thats fucked up to say, Jayus.
My same problems...
Same
me who's fat: *does all the things she told us not to do*
These are problems?
I have also been very skinny my whole life but I always have it SO warm. Like when it's 3°C outside I have it warm. Like wtf???
I'm skinny but I can walk like a spider and I am good at climbing
We also move more freely
That dance was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🤦‍♂️UR rlly skinny
Good dancing btw im also skinny so I can relate
You know what? you're beautiful 😊
She fine
Let me tell you that is VERY VERY TRUE 😭 and that's hurts 😑😐 ALL THE POINT That 5th accurate than acura
Cant dance and look skinny me to
Lol
i’m skinny and those moves are like better than mine cause i’m a skeleton and help cause they call my that 🥲
I swear ppl never understand these problems of mine, like IT'S NOT MY FUCKING CHOICE TO BE SKINNY OK?! 🙂🙂🙂
The Society one I am like pretty much a child ;-; my parents say that to me and it hurts 😥 But yeah everything else relatable.
That's me
Oh my god this is so relatible. I'm a guy but still!!
THEY JUST CALL ME SKINNY MINNY
Same....
As someone that’s 5’4 and just barely hit 100 pounds a couple months ago I can relate to this a bit too much
This is real talk men! her words reflect my daily life being skinny at all!
So i was weirdly skinny my WHOLE like, untill about the age of 17! Now  bare in mind I am 1,69 meters tall  and I went from 47 kilos to waighing 73 kilos in 3 years, all my life I heard those type of coments," omg eat a burger" " watch out you might blow away" "  are you shure you eat" or" grose! You look so skinny"... Now suddenly hear omg you eat too much","you look so fat" "and grose, celulite" and literally" are you shure your not pregnant!"And all this from "friends and others" basicly, people will judge you no matter what !and you just do you and society sucks! Just everyone try be a good human and be mindfull of others. Thanks sorry for the rant. Ps sorry if there is any miss spellings, english is not my first Language. 💋
Every single thing you said is a problem for me also
Sometimes I would get comments about me when I was younger that in a storm I would LITERALLY fly away no cap someone said that to me once 😂😂
The last one sounds like a you probably
I am very skinny arm even leg
Half your problems can be solved by a cushion
OML SAME BITCH
So tru
I can relate
I is a skinny legend to and that is so true though
Can u tell how to get fat
Me :scolled after watching this video.  Next video: about you  Me :what in the
All spot on but the dance thing is just a white person thing coming from another white person who can't dance
Why this trueeeeeeeeee 😭😭😭
You actly better than dancing than ne
EVEN at school every day I get so many comments from these three girls in particular saying stuff like "OMG your literally a twig" and "do you even eat anything lemme your just skin and bones you have no fat" and it really angers me because I don't know if they realize it but they are actually body shaming me. And yes skinny shaming is a thing
I understand it totally🙂🙂🙂🙃🙃🙃

And ur ribs LITTERLY HURTS AFTER DANCING;-;
My friends say that too
Plump people rn (including me):👁👄👁
That's my problem:/ I can't dance they even take my phone if I don't dance☹︎☠︎︎
I'm skinny as hell too man even if eating a lot I could a whole store and I'll still be skinny I can definitely relate
If u want to gain weight, be lazy, and eat Greek foods
I'm a kid and I'm very skinny, and all  this happens to me, and everyone was used to taunt me, even my parents and I'm still skinny just like before but people don't taunt me now because it's boring for them.
"Serious buddy, eat a burger" (me)"what, the 2 x-large pizzas wasn't enough of a lunch"
Its much worse for guys :/
I can dance but I'm really tall and skinny and I'm in third grade
Left out having to use hair ties for bracelets because our wrists are too small for regular ones 😭
I'm 90 lbs and I'm only 11
Bella got some moves 😎
you look like all-might after what happened to him
I feel you- I'm literally a skeleton, and ever body forces me to eat-
Yes you can
Just saying this for badboyhalo: LANGUAGE
Bro this is so true......   Well except for that I can't dance
I'm 60 pounds 😁
Well, I would be more than happy to trade bodys
Same i don't eat much but even when I eat a lot I just can't get to a healthy weight
Don't feel bad about the dancing. As a thiccc boy, I can tell you there's not much dancing coming from our end either lmao
honestly i think you look good being the way you are
I can totally relate to all of this. Also the go eat more kinda thing makes no sense cause lots of skinny ppl including me just have a naturally high metabolism
And I’m fat as shit and I can’t stand for long but i have good insilaton outside in dead winter when it snows I wear shorts and a t shirt and you get comments on that to.
I have skinny friend but she can dance so well
I’m skinny too but I’m trying to gain weight it is hard could u make a video of how to gain weight faster for skinny people????
Jayus ya know u have dancing a good shot lol
Like that shit hurts how about you get skinny as me and let me tell you that bitch
I have this problem where my arms are just skin and bones level of skinny but my legs are fat as hell. What the hell cursed me with that
Yup, Im tall af as well so everyone asks me if I play basketball, shits annoying as hell.
Relatable really I'm 82 pounds I don't know how im.still on the ground how am I alive
You got some good moves better than mine
The fucking dance is that
Hmmmm your cute lol
That was so funny when you danced
“I can’t dance” Me grooving to her dancing*
Y to
YESSSS THIS IS WHAT I FEEL EVERYDAY 😿😿👍
i am fat but i always feel cold. my fat can make my body warm lol. they even stay on body for years without pay for rent
OMG ITS SO TRU LIKE MY DAD AND STEP MOM IS LIKE ITS NOT COLD WY ARE YOU ALL WAYS HURT I WHERE A PEaR OF PANTS FORe A 7 yEAr OLD IM NOT 7 now my elbow hurts from lying like dis
Ok try a fucking tiktok dance
That dance tho
I feel your pain. I can literally see my ribs everytime I breathe. Everything you mentioned is 100% true for me.. including not being able to dance
Thank you I’m the skinniest person in my family and I have over 36 people in my family
I hate being skinny
Exactly what it’s like - I’ve been as skinny as a freaking pencil for all my life
Agreed I feel my ribs
Yep same
Me
I agree with this. I'm a very skinny person who's never been comfortable with myself because of the problems that come with it and My mom always says things like "you know how many people would love to have your body shape" just screwed my brain up
This is very true since I am skinny as fuck
Fr!!!
I can relate to the whole vid
I love your videos. They are soooo relatable. I'm obsessed.
I want to be skinny 😭
Your speaking faxxx. 💀
I have been skinny my whole life to. And it also get told that im gonna break in the wind and im still a. Child too :) what a nice world we live in
All of those I relate to everybody calls me a twig
its true people use to make fun of me for it
Whenever the pe teacher would make us sit on the gym floor it would hurt like crap
I know your pain
I can very much confirm this
Damn relate to this vid
Honey you being skinny has nothing to do with you not being able to dance. That's just awful 😂
Are you a girl or a boy
Yeah do that while being short and its 10× worse
I feel like dancing comes over time
The burger and food stuff u said was true ppl keep saying that😭
I relate to all of those, specially the pants one, I apent 6 hours in the shopping mall looking for pants
Im really skinny tho lol-
Hahah 10/10 for committing to those dance moves! Keep up the good work :)
All that shit is true   Tell me about it 😂😂😆
Im very underweight, yet I can stay outside in cold with just a thin hoodie.
I can 100% relate to all of there except the cold bc I am one of those people who wear shorts all year round
I’m 62 pounds and I’m 10
At this point i stop wearing belts amd opt for pants that are tight on my legs and thigh especially my upper thigh so even if it doesn't fit the waist or hip then it won't  budge at the thigh And if i wear baggy pants the elastic better help cause the string won't do shut but dig into my skin
Girl say ROCK if you going to say nasty words😂😂
It also doesn't help that four tall as fuck
Just work out
Brrruuuuuhhh I feel that
"I CANT DANCE" *proceeds to dance better than me*
My best friend is a tall skinny guy. He is ALWAYS cold! and I’ve seen the holes he has made himself in his belt! He eats a lot though so i know it’s just his metabolism. I love my bestie.
I can relate
Literally relate to everything, earlier my friend that has a normal weight was like it’s not cold and me being me I’m FREEZING
You got some good moves
I feel u
Reason why I’m fat as F I don’t want to be cold and I love to dance
Lol so true I am only sixty pounds and no one understands
Also a lot of skinny people end up being late bloomers. Mainly talking to girls…..
I'm fucking dead 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🧬 she nailed it !!!!
The "do you have anorexia" is the worst comment like stop stop
So the only good benefit of being skinny is you look good in clothes
As a skinny person I can say all of these are true
That was better than me dancing
I'm a thick chick and proud!
True as hell
Okay so I am skinny I don't look very skinny but I get cold in 2 seconds
As a skinny person this is true btw the very cold one is legit me all the time I’m that kid dude lol
I know how you feel but I barely get cold
If you're skinny people hate you if your overweight people hate you comon people.
Like people want to be skinny but they don't know what comes with it literally sleepless nights bruh 🤣
Shit girl ..are you kidding me?!?.. your dance skills KILL! lol😀 but frfr, you're good, in my book, at least 🥰
Soooooo true
Sooooo truuuuuueee 🤣
I’ve always had an average body and my best friend has always been thinner and all of our body convos went like “I wish I was skinny like you, then I could pull this outfit off better, you can literally wear ANYTHING and look bomb” and then the response “wow stop, I wish I was thicker like you and could fill out my clothes more” we always hyped each other up. Don’t body shame people, it’s really fucked up.
Society ducking sucks!   Oh I'm fat sure I'll be skinny, society . I'm too skinny, sure I'll get more pounds . I'm too fat, didn't you just say I should be fat?  Society sucks and is questionable
In my opinion I think it's better than being fat
I can’t dance either! I am skinnier then a skeleton. I HAVE NO MEAT
I'm so skinny it was really windy today when I was walking to school and the wind blew me and it felt like someone was pushing me
I can only wear skinny jeans
Yeah true when I was 3 I was SOO THINNN this is facts
I don’t know what your talking about those dance moves we’re on point.💃🕺
I’m skinny and I mean really skinny because when I put on a dress all I get is “ you are very skinny “ or “ do you eat I can see you’re bones are you ok ? “ it makes me hate myself but now i love my body and if somebody says something I talk back and not stay quiet and cry
This is the effect of ADHD I know it's like cos I've got it too
Literally related to everything in this video lol 👽👹✨
where i live, these problems bother me cuz i’m skinny but there are no plus sides to being skinny because everyone else is like me
Don’t worry I’m built like a fucking potato/marshmallow and I can’t Dance to save my fucking life XD
I can relate to everything here especially the belt
Same😃🙃
“I can’t dance” same, but not cuz I’m skinny, it’s because I’m ✨ w h i t e  ✨
I get sick from a fan a old dusty weak ass fan that barely works and is hot not cold like wth
I mean a boy
I have a question for you are you a girl or
This is too relatable...
This is so true
Skinny and cant dance sound more like a you problem I'm fucking michael jackson on the dance floor
Me either girly
I legit have that blanket
Same here
So true I eat alot but I'm still so SKINNAY 😃
The sitting down one I felt and people consider me chubby
In sixth grade I went to the mall with my friend and her parents, they got Panda Express which I’m not a huge fan of and when I wasn’t eating too much of it, the mom asked me why I wasn’t eating and even after I told her I just didn’t really like Panda Express, she straight up asked me if I was just anorexic
This is literally me
My older sister is so skinny and eats so much junk and dances
i had a classmate who was incredibly skinny when we were 13-16 years old. at this point in school we had to get changed for gym, and in the locker room she all of a sudden said that she was fat.  a lot of the girls got mad at her because she was nowhere near fat, but i felt bad for her because she felt that way. i don't know if she ever gained weight back because she left my school, but my friends thought she had an ed because when she left she was somehow skinnier.
Specially tall skinny
I think those were still better moves than me
I'm not skinny, but my waist is small, so the problem with pants is common for me.
I’m fat and my mum always said i’m just about double boned?  Bc when I lay down like at 2. Mine hurts
I cant dance eiver
I have exactly same problémy...🥺😂
Yeah these are really problems when you are (to) skinny
She's 100% right! I hate being skinny
I think you dance alright! And you're pretty❤️
Sadly I don't struggle at those thing look at me Am T H I C C
I skiny to I'm a boy
As a skinny man I’m quite turned on right now. Both by the dancing and your understanding of the struggle.
Jayus: I CANT DANCE Also Jayus: Micheal Jackson mode activated

Can’t relate I’m fat af
Your dancing is better then mine and I’m fat.
I'm 18, and failry underweight, last tike I checked, I was 58kg. Nothing I can do tho, I eat alot just can't put on weight. I ain't self conscious about it but comments on it definitely don't help

Yea, thats me.

I’ve recently have lost a lot of weight due to illness. I wish someone would’ve told me all things you’ve mentioned.  Especially the ass pain and being cold all the time
I'm skinny...but I have curves somehow. So I've got the bruised ribs and no insulation issue...but I have the chubby issue of being unable to find jeans that fit and looking bad in certain outfits😂
At First i was skinny as fuck and now if fat
So relatable. I've been like this my whole life
Thats so fucking true! 20 years ago beeing skinny was the goal. Now you get mobbed for it :) obisety is healthy and beeing skinny= anorexic ( both menthal problems but just one is sick to the society) wtf is that - me a skinny girl
Yes I have thes problems
You can't dance because you're white I can't either
I am skinny
Racist
ITS SO TRUE I SKINNY AS FUGE AND ... I needed this!!
I'm tall and skinny 🙂
I'm sorry, dancing has/had nothing to do with your weight...just saying
I'm a big guy and I can't sit for too long and laying on my stomach also gives me bruises.
Sheesh dance moves

Your fine. You look good 👍🏼
your dance moves are better than my life choices istg-
As a skinny person ppl ask me alot that if i eat and im always no i havent eaten for a day could u like order me a pizza in a sarcastic way 🙂🙂🙂
I'm so so skinny and really tall which makes it worse
As a skinny,i can confirm this
Yeah true
They saud this to me but over 1 year now i am heby for my age
Yep people say I'm skinny but always eat A lot and still they call me skinny like it doesn't matter how much I eat I just stay skinny (and I'm thankful for that)
He was a girl?
All the dumb insecurities are created by the society...
You to
Very skinny but I can dance pretty much
I'm skinny too and i TOTALLY AGREE. 💯 That dance was lit 🔥🔥
The belt problem - suspenders and/or overalls. Welcome
Im a skinny guy and im lucky noone told me i was too skinny or eat more i feel bad for yall but yeah im a skinny legend and thats all that matters😗😗😗
I like your body I am to fat so I get to hot so fast I feel like I will never be skinny
I remember being asked by my cousin asking how do I still have a Slender body no matter how much I eat 🥲
Im a skinny person and THIS IS FUCKING TRUE
Me too also i also get cold very cold.
Im litrely so skinny
as a skinny person I can agree to most of these
This is so relatable. I searched up on Google if I was a normal weight for my age and height. I was considered under weight. All of  these happen to me.
This is all true
Hey don't worry jayus. that looks like dancing to me
Not being able to dance isn't an exclusive problem for skinny people.  I'm not fit, but I'm not overweight either. Either way, dancing makes me jiggle to an uncomfortable degree... Jumping hurts a little bit too
The belt thing is 10000% relatable
That's soo true
This is so true am skinny as much as you and these are the questions I get 1. "Omg u should go eat" am not hungry at all 2. "Are you good?" No am freezing  3. "your pants is so small how doesn't it fit?" What's the problem am so skinny 4. "Wow ur lucky your skinny" no I wish I wasn't
Shut up!! U are blessed and lucky!!! Try double that weight and then we can talk about getting hateful comments to your face...  but really, you look great, I am jelly af and wish you all the best 😘
my dream is to be skinny
OMG THAT'S ME !!!!! OH GOD !
U actually prob can dance listen to kpop and the dance moves and if u still cant dance then idk how they dance being skinny
Go through all that shit everyday.
I WANNABE SKINNY ASF 😭
I know the feeling cz am skinny too
I still am🥲
I am 43, and finally got to the "goal weight". My oldest daughter is 18 and finally made it to 100 lbs. Ironically, every other family member on both sides is overweight!
Oh my gosh same.
Im a 8yo girl and I'm only 19.95kg
So true
I am not going to lie I didn't think people who were smaller had problems which is really a bad thought because I got bullied for my weights because I'm on the thicker side but I'm happy that I know that smaller people are skinnier people have problems too
I just love how she's like I can't dance but then like I see her dancing way better than I do and I'm not super small
Her : "Can't Dance!" Also Her : *Dances like a pro*
For the you can't dance I fell you LIKE HOW TF DO THAY DO IT IT'S LIKE A ROBOTS PLAYING PUPIT MASTER AND THERE THE PUPIT
I was 34 pounds when I was 8
I like how she acts like a boy that makes it funnier cuz she ain't scared of being embarrassed lol i like that peraonality
I’m fat and can’t dance
I agree, I hate it so much when a lot of people see me and say "you should eat more" or "are you on a diet? You shouldn't need to watch on your weight too much", and the worst would be when they blame my mom for me being skinny and accuse her that she doesn't feed me enough. And whenever she tells them that I actually have a big appetite and that I eat a lot, they wouldn't believe her and be like "Really? But she looks so skinny tho" I'm skinny not because I don't eat, but because I have such a fast metabolism, why can't they accept that answer?🙄 Also being skinny was the reason why I had a huge accident when I was a kid where I broke my elbow (it's healed now though)
Bro wait am I skinny.
I hava same problems
You dance so good!! It’s not bad, I promise!!
Lol you can dance better than me and my physique has been average my whole life.
My weight is 25😫🥺
Here's a little tip that got bob hard for some reason... Only eat McDonald's for one day, then eat really healthy after. (This is partially a joke, don't do the McDonalds part)
does growing up skinny also make you say the n word?
I've been struggling with this my whole life. At this point I know I have high metabolism and I'll accept the fact that I'll never gain weight no matter how hard I try.
I've been bullied for being too skinny but in my opinion I hate it. I'm not at a healthy weight and I am mostly bones. People don't realize that skinny people struggle too
And you think I can dance 😂
I have a skinny insult but please, PLEASE, nobody use this, its really rude.    “Whenever someone touches ur stomach, they dont even feel it bc it dont exist” i made this and i really regret it.
Still struggling with this
Jesus is returning soon are you ready? Repent and also become Saved. Heaven or Hell, choose wisely.
You’re a better dancer than me
I'm skinny and I can dance
Grass is always greener on the other side. I was chubby and I would want to be skinny. Then I got skinny and I would feel like being chubby wasn't that bad. Then I got swole and I had to get new clothes because they wouldn't fit after a couple of months and it was a bit annoying but now I'm good.  Tldr: find the sweet spot where you feel comfy with the drawbacks and stay healthy (mind, body and soul).
She still busting sum good dance moves tho
I was watching a movie and my friend told me that she though the main character was prettier than the conventionally pretty, skinny girl. And that’s totally fine, but her reason was “I like the more natural pretty, not starvation pretty” and all I could think is that it’s socially acceptable to say that but everyone would be super pissed if someone said “I like the more natural pretty, not the stuffing your face with food pretty”.   -sincerely a skinny person with a bigger friend that doesn’t understand my struggles even though I understand hers :)
This is so true
This is true and yes I'm in 7th it is vary fucked up
Oreo thins
I would prefer being skinny than a big blob          Not saying anything mean because I'm a big blob
I can relate to this
bruhh why did the meter say “620” 💀
Cant relate, I'm fat as heck 😂
Sitting and laying down hurt so bad lol
Jay you are not the only one who can't dance I'm skinny asf
Are you a girl or boy
Like I swear ever time I find a belt that has enough holes to fit in it’s made of metal, AND IM ALLERGIC TO METAL
Lol
Dead serious you have some of the best dance moves of any person
Thank me too when I was achild ppl will called me a skeleton
THANK YOU!!
MY UNCLE ALWAYS SAYS “do you eat at all? what u so skinny for" AHHHH
Oh my god this is so true i’m 13 and I have this problem
You know it’s true I’m skinny myself and sometimes I need to sleep with five blankets yeah really sucks sometimes
The only good part is nothing
No dancing is just you
This is such a good representation of stereotypes that people use against skin people
My whole family says "oH mY gOsH yOu ArE lIkE sKiN aNd BoNeS yOu NeEd To eAt MoRe FoOd"
That dance was the best no idea what ur talking about
She: Skinny people can’t dance  Michael Jackson:      Hold my hat
my parents call me skinny each chance they get
Eat McDonalds that’s what has to be said to skinny people
I can relate
First 4 relatable asf
My brother has teased me for being skinny my whole life and my parents never knew about it and now I’m insecure about it and I told my best friend and she said I was too skinny to be insecure about my weight.
Literally me
Someone literally told my parents to feed me today bruh I ate three cinnamon buns for breakfast
It’s literally so true- I get way too cold when it’s hot outside, it hurts to get on my stomach foe to too long. i can’t really fit into most pants. and i cant dance :/
I'm really skinny I eat alot and I never get fat tho
Me who is skinny and tried dancing but is now laying down on my bed in my cold room wearing clothes that didn’t fit: *I have a few of the problems but I know I will have more soon.*
Jayus, I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I can't even dance like that and I'm also skinny asf💀💗
Honestly the only thing I don't like about being skinny is how my wrists look, I personally think it looks weird (which is why I wear sweaters all the time) and as for the comments about being as small as I am, it doesn't bother me personally, in fact me and my friends joke about it a lot (like making jokes about me being blown away by the wind, snapping in half if I'm squeezed just a little too tightly, etc.) I know not everyone is like this, it's just that I personally don't care about comments and jokes about my weight. Ok I'll stop talking now
I’m struggling with this too
no wonder i use 12 blankets each night…
At least your not at constant risk of cardiac arrest like fat people.
I have the same problems sometimes, but my pants fit.
My friends all thought I had an eating disorder…..
I can relate to this because I’m skinny and these problems are my life.
tysm for this!!
Onlyjayus: "I can't dance" Me : well those dance moves are better than mine
Ur "dancing" has made my day
That’s me 😂
Especially when you have pool and everyone sees your ribs
So I just can't dance because I'm skinny?
God dam your 66 pounds bruh i am 9 and i weigh 85 pounds😱😱😱
I just think it’s not bc ur skinny it’s just ur bad at danceing
This is so relatable bc I am rlly skinny too
I think dance isn't a size thing?
Sames gurl
I just found a nice size ribbon in the craft section and use it as a belt.
Im also skinny and In one of the known dancers in our school. I weigh 41 at 162cm of height.
You can dance
I am the 3 all the time
As a medically underweight person, this is all true
🥵
When u was a baby I was only 5 pounds
Same with me
I've been skinny my whole life and once time I went to a friend's house and when we were eating breakfast and I said "I'm full" and her mom said "it looks like you've barely eaten!" I was actually full and she asked "what do u normally have for breakfast?" I said "cereal" she said "no wonder your so skinny" 👀
Your white duuu
Just work out or try to get fat. I am not meaning to be mean but just try.
If you hate it so much do something abt it.
Some reason no matter how much unhealthy food I eat I am still the same and I don’t gain pounds
Dude same Jayus, especially the comments, no one even meant anything but most of highschool even in 90 degree summers I would wear atleast 2 long sleeve shirts anywhere.
Skill issue
Can I point out that she it way bigger than the couch
Are you a boy or girl?
JAYUS I GET U I HATE WHEN PEOPLE SAY DO U EAT
Mate I’m not skinny and h can’t dance I only know one and I got taught it and as I forget stuff I don’t remember if sometimes
I eat like 5 fricking pigs that are dying from hunger but still am a toothpick
Okay
3 I am like wearing 2 jackets just to not get cold and 4 made me to never wear jeans again
I have an ass and mine hurts too when i sit down on a hard chair... also the ribs, happens every time I workout
I was skinner now im fat due to covid witch one do I rather
thats cool but at least i didnt say the n word
Ur dance skills rock
I don’t think the last ones cause she’s skinny
Wow sucks for u 🙄
And I should just put the burger down. I am going to do that
Wait you weigh 66 pounds Im probably half your age and weigh 80 pounds
Wtf is  the dance
I’m not the only one
Im skinny too 😂
Good teknik to get your but fat eat then do sqouats
OK the dance on you still look skinny people can dance
I’m skinny naturally and I eat so much af and yet I get comments like these FROM MY SISTER
Fr she should teach dance lessons
I thought you were American
Fat people problems: can’t run, get very hot, you run out of breath, you can’t lay on your back, you have more of a chance to have a heart attack.
Calm down with the swearing
also num 5 i got that alot AS A 4-8 YRO
i can relate to this alot, and i was told i was so skinny that i should eat more and i felt so insercure but i can push through it
im also skinny and i eat alot its just i have a fast metabolism
That dancing was fabulous
“So I don’t know if you can tell” Me: So I don’t know if you can tell that you sound like ReeKid ☺️
You remind me of my old friends aunt she had the same personality
I am NOT SKINNY but I can not dance . Only person in my family who can't dance
That is me and my sister
The cold one so fvking true
I’ve been I’m still skinny I know how this goes
I get it there are some problems but be thankful that you are skinny because there are so many people who are struggling to lose weight and wish they had these problems than having the problem of being to fat and stuff like that
Acually i'm opposite of skinny 😀👍🏻
Ym fucking skini tooooo #i realet
Thank you for exposing our struggles. Skinny lives Matter
Omg.. so related
like yes except the cold but the belt that is the worst
You have great dance moves
Onlyjayus she is😃🤨😐😤
I just have an unhealthy metabolism and i can only gain weight when i am actively trying to, and its just uncomfortable. But i dont really get cold because im just... cold blooded
I am definitely one of those people👉🏻👈🏻
Yeah being skinny the comments were always the worst people would constantly say like I can snap you like a twig
I am very skinny and wear a winter coat in some of the hottest days of the summer
That’s dance was good but it was 😆
Oh my fricking god, my whole ife problems in one 30 sec video.
Can we just agree that when you want to talk about this, many would think that you're sick or something. But how am i suppose to talk about how its difficult to eat regularly when i have no idea either
I got the same problem
Now i know why im always cold...
Same like everyone asks if i have an eating disorder 😭✋
Guuurl u dance better than me
Same
Im skinny ai need tips lol, aldo I eat
“ I can’t dance”   Proceeds to show the most amazing dance moves I’ve ever seen
I don’t think the last one is because you are skinny, I think it is just you
Yeah all of my friends say that all the time
ITS FINALLY NOT JUST FUCKIN ME
Im also skinny and my doctor said i need to gain weigh and I can't 😭
I can eat everything in the McDonald’s Menu but I will NOT GAIN ANY WEIGHT OR ILL BARELY GAIN ANYTHING AND EVERY ONE THINKS I STARVE MYSELF   And the bone things are true the pants problem is the worst bc I will find the best looking jeans but they’re too big for me
100% true I can mhm true
I used to he able to dance but not anymore udk why the only dancing j can do it tiktok
I want to be skinny
I am 10 I am very under weight same problems
Same but at least I'm not fat 🇺🇸🍔🤡
I quite like your dancing! But I can relate; I only started to gain weight at the ripe age of 29...I'll be 30 in February!😂😂😂
RELATABLE AS A SKINNY PERSON 😭
So I’ve lost weight recently and my cousin came over and I said “have you stoped eating you look weird” and “I can see your ribs” and other quite hurtful things   I’m 12
Okay no comments i can only laugh about the moves
The dancing thing is just you
I agree
with the 1st one, I legit can relate to it soo much, especially at school where they have the plastic chairs that just hurt to sit on. The second one, i don’t relate because i’ve never layed down like that ever.with the 3rd one, i’m skinny myself and i’ve never been “extremely cold” or maybe i’ve just gotten used to staying in 20 degrees celsius (which is a cold temperature for you americans)  and even my mom who is slightly above average weight gets way more colder way more quickly than me.
Just eat more lmao It's easier to be fat than to be thin
Being cold is a serious problem for me lmao. Whenever i go somewhere i have to wear four layers and gloves, i live in a summer all year country-
People say white people can’t dance lol jk
Skinny struggle for me: i am amusingly weak looking and yet kick like a mule. Its hard when you look like a skinny titan from AOT and are sorta strong assumptions suck
this is honestly very accurate from a skinny person
Can totally relate
OMG I CAN SO RELATE TO THE PANTS ONE ITS ALWAYS LIKE oh thats cute OH WAIT IT DOSENT FIT
Yeah secoity suspects us to all be skinny but if your too skinny you will get shamed for it
saying ppl fat is as disrespectful as saying ppl thin ngl
Fucking Finally someone said it! I'm too thin too! Everybody's like:  "omg did you even eat anything?? Omg I wish I was like you!" like no, ı am eating and it doesn't even affects me. I'm also being happy because I got more weight and people looking at me, worrying about me- Lmaoooo
The end tho
I now how it feels my waist size is 22 cm but people say the same thing I need to eat because I'm a leaf plz we feel hurt and I'm tall so it's hard to find clothes that I can use its really hard😯😧😳
The dance moves were amazing
I have all these except the dancing... I can't dance, just don't understand wth that's gotta do with being skinny. 🤔😂
I just love the way she f**king talks
Im struggling with this
Im skinny and people say i need to eat more but the thing is...... no matter how much i eat i lose the weight the next day
The I can’t dance part cracked me up
Freestlyin
U can’t dance cuz ur white
Wow what a great dancer  Me always dance like that , that cool
I'm literally skinny but all you do i do but opposite
Ur body is how my family wants me to look like... I'm fine.. :)
im not even that skinny but my ass hurts so bad when i sit for a long time
I was always tall and skinny growing up and thought it was the most fucked up thing that being tall and skinny is a “societal ideal” but no clothes ever fucking fit me, I just looked like a child playing dress up. Make it make sense please.
Im fat but not much but still have big belly and big thigh😑
I relate beyond relationships
Hahaha. Yes. I live in the Pacific and was usually the only one who would wear her jacket to school. Hot or not. At home I would literally stuff the bottom of my long pants into my socks to keep warm.  But my tolerance has improved now.
That's literally my little sisters life
Sweat pants are the best for skinny people I should know I am one just tie it tight
The belt thing is so relatable
That’s why my brother wears 2 FUCKING JACKET IN SUMMER
I don’t understand, think about how good it would be if someone as fat as me switched with someone skinny, like if you say anything, the only thing people say to insult you it’s always, ur fat, and vice versa
Society one is defined true
Words have never been truer. I was told not to go out when it's too windy and asked about the threads hanging from my coat that was my legs. I remember my friend grabbing me and pulling me in, frightened the sh*t out of me, she said she thought I was going to fall down the drain.
I'm skinny and the part where you get cold fast is true...
you weigh like the same as me and im 11
I’m very slender, kind of too much. I have all of the things that you do but I also have a DIVIT in my chest. Sometimes it’s hard to breath
The 5th one is so real I just got depressed and anxiety
IKR!!!!!!!!
Im super skinny when i was young but started to gain weight in my late 20's. Now im 31 and starting to get tubby 😆
I get called a twig or stick and I'm still being called that
Aaaaah  Me too!
Sooooooo true
What does she mean she can’t dance
I am one of those “skinny people”  but I don’t think I’m skinny but people at my school are like oMg I wIsH i CoUlD bE lIkE yOu LiKe  WhAt Do YoU dO tO gEt It
unrelated to the video but this girl is really annoying, can never understand her point bc she's so loud and cusses a lot loud. and whats with all the weird zooms
I bet you have a thyroid disorder
Yeah but skinny people punch so hard
That meeee
My mom always say why the heck are you dieting and I was like what Wdym
As a heavier person, omg i can relate too except for 4. And I completely agree with that those comments hurt.
The dancing isn't skinny people problems, that's a jayus problem
Feel the skinny pains I need a few hoodies for 65 degrees
Wish I was skinny because body shaming is something that you cannot escape from honestly I've had many people make fun of me 😩
Ok so as a ’skinny as shit’ person those happen to me always
Jayus is female????????
As a skinny person I can relate to all of them :,)
I mean i have a sister like that even if she actually eat alot she never gain weight😅
my mom tells me to eat a cheese burger, like i would if she would buy me one??? and people tell me they're afraid I'll blow away, tf💀
Also a skinny tall person. Got called anorexic once, that shit hurts more than a stinging nettle
Oooooooo same when i do push ups my bones are always crack  and my dance is horible XD
Another thing that's fucked up to say to a kid is my grandmother told me I needed to watch how much pie I eat or I'll gain weight on Thanksgiving when I was supposed to be with my grandma and mom being happy
“that shits fucked up to say to kids”  fr the comments people would say to me when i was younger are the reason i ended up having a binge eating disorder for over 4 years.
Same! No matter how much I eat, im always been so thin and all of this is relatable!!!!
Oh lord
Those dance moves do be good tho
I feel this
I have been told to eat so many times it really hurts and I only weigh 71 pounds
Yet skinny is a lot more attractive then fat
This is so true for me, sadly 😂😂
same😭
I count that as dancing
I'm fat as hecc and I can't dance either
I relate to this so much
No the bad thing is that I am skinny and have a big waits and it’s just horrible and it kinda sucks so yeah 🙂
I am struggling with weight gain and have no appetite at all.   I  hate it when when it starts showing on my face. I am down to 102 and it makes me so mad at myself!!
I would rather be skinny then my current fat body
Cares if you’re skinny be you Sorry of the consequences of being skinny but I think you’re awesome
If you’re having fun you’re dancing
Yep.
YOUR 66 IM NOT EVEN A PRE TEEN AND I WAY MORE THAN YOU THATS NOT HEALTHY
It's called your pelvis not your @ss bones🤓
3 and 5 we're very true (to me at least)
The poking holes on the belt ruined my damn belt.
omg i an to and it like ahhh and yes these are probloms
Me who is very chubby: Guess I am skinny
I wish I was skinny :(
I gave up on dancing bc of all the negative so I conform          And I dont know if it's just me but like I CAN NOT RUN THAT SHIT HURTS
As a skinny person, I can confirm ass bones hurt when you sit
I approve
I’m sorry but watching Jayus dance made me secretly attracted to her
Facts im very skinny and I am always told to eat more
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy same
Not being able to dance has NOTHING to do with bn skinny
I'm short and overweight I'm still cold allot.  Remember guys your size does not matter be youself!!
I showed this to my brother and he said “well atleast there’s a good reason to be so fat now”
Get a grip 6 belt it's good
FINALLY IM NOT ALONE OMG
The bruising is a little too accurate. I ain't skinny, I'm overweight but still been losing weight since last year and still going at it. But my sis is the exact opposite, she is skinny and when we were little because my dad thought it was a good idea to bring his unhinged daughters to watch wrestling like the lil crackheads we are, I would do that shit when we got home and the number of bruises I left on her was too scary I eventually stopped rough housing with her and even now I am too scared to even hug her tightly now that I am working out and can bench press her.
Yea when I was a child these whete my issues- now that I gained weight I don’t have the issues
Eat the word of God and REPENT..SINNER.. your in great DANGER.
Relatable People said the same about me all my life ,now that I'm conscious of my weight, everybody's telling me I'm fat
I CANT DANCE -  💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻👯‍♀️👯👯👯‍♀️👯👯‍♀️👯🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻
Omg I'm so sorry like nobody should say that to a kid :( that's stuffed up bro
I think that last one is a u prob 😂
I'm not skinny but I somehow have the same pain
And we look dumb as shit doing literally anything we do
I'm sorry but I don't think the dance problem is your weight (I'm not trying to be mean I love you and your vids)
I like how I blocked this creator yet I keep getting reccomended their videos, youtube better get their shit together.
I have the same problems-
Idk what your thinking, but I think that's dancing
Does anyone see the first frame?
This is all so true  I know this bc I have been extremely skinny my whole life
My friends ask if my parents feed me 😭😭🥺
Me on the the other end with and ED trying to get skinny to get those
Exactly I hate when this happen people gave me the nickname pancake because I was so thin
Ok this was me when I was 7-9 but now I’m very chunky and I’m not cold and I can barely run and all those fat stuff
Are you a girl🤨
I’m really skinny too so I definitely understand. I go through it all
You do need a sandwich!
I eat a lot now and people ask me how am I not fat I’m in high school and can barely fit a size 14 in kids
Someone called me that thing in the hobbit that said my precious
I lost weight and suddenly most of these problems are  actually true. It's weird that when you are too fat people laugh and bully you but when you too skinny they will want to give you food and force you to eat it.
I can't dance
664?
I understand ur problems
This is what we call thin privilege.  You were and are still treated better than fat ppl in society and always will be.
I noooo
I can dance and I'm 2 inches thin
I've been skinny since young so I decided to eat more but all it did was clogged to the toilet. It was no longer  a problem to gain weight since I started training my muscles
Girl same
This is the story of my life lol brake in the wind 🤣🤣
*if she didnt have Meat on her bones* *how is she moving?*
THIS IS ME!
How.. DARE U SHOOT ME WITH A RELATIBLE ARROW
I totally related to the skinny problem. I always had that problem when I was young. I had a hard time gaining weight. Everything she said is what I had to go through too. People don't understand how hard it is to gain weight, and now my son and daughter are having that same problem too. Lol
“Break in half in the wind!”😂
And I've been so funking fat and I still am. I can't dance either tho.
Did onlyjayus play volleyball 🏐?
SamexD
Sooooooooooooooo true...jayus now reading my mind too😂😂😂🤣
As a skinny underweight person. I can confirm everything apart from the cold one. I don’t actually find the weather cold :/
I love skinny girls and I love ur craziness
The bad dance is just because you’re white. We can’t dance
Geez, I think,  and this only for me, that I'm fat and all I want is ru be skinny and y'all want to be normal.. But don't get me wrong, everyone is looking perfect, it doesn't matter if you're skinny or curvy
That happened to me girl 🥸🥸🥸🤩🤩🤩🤩
Yeah it’s not good to say a kid is skinny. Has anyone ever went through that? Me: ✋😕
NO FR !! Sameeeeee i could totally relate to this
It’s true. We skinny people can’t dance 😭
DUDE, ....I FEEL YOU
I can literally relate to this entire video especially the sitting on a hard surface and the belt thing and people are legit constantly telling me that i dont eat anything and i pretty much as 2 of my family members combined.
I hate being skinny as nothing fits and my parents make skinny jokes that are mean such as "I can brake you in half easily."or"you need to eat or you are going to hospital." 😭 I hate bieing skinny.
You are slim and not skinny
Wait did you play volleyball? I love volleyball
I know how you feel I can't sit down and I can't lay down but one time I had a sleepover with a friend s they were really hot the whole night and they had no blankets bc I took them all and I pit the heater on full blast. I was still cold.
I relate to this so much!!!
BRUH STFU I WAY MORE THAN U AND IM YOUNGER THAN U BY ALOT
It's me 🥲
I CAN'T DANCE  **aggressive dance moves** 👹👹👹✨✨✨💃💃💃
Red flags
I'm always being told I don't look like a human. But I'm not even that skinny.
10/10 dancing 😏😏😏
My uncle is skinny shit too
OMG YES! IVE BEEN MADE FUN OF ALL MY LIFE FOR BEING SKINNY
The clip of jayus dancing is gold
This is literally me except I can dance
the sitting down problem is unreal i totally relate
most people would consider be quite chubby but I still relate to the first 3 problems way too much-
Yeah my brother is a garbage disposal and is still skiny as heck but no of this applies except the dancing part he can't dance
im not even actually skinny maybe im just on the slimmer side but i always still see myself as too thick but one time one of my bosses was like HOW ARE U NOT COLD ?! u dont have the natural jacket like *points to big guy other boss on the other side of the room* then *big guy hugs his rolls up to show* and i was just thinking like wow thank you am i considered slim😭tears of joy fr
This always happens 😂
I'm skinny and once me and my family went to a park and there was a strong wind and sand flying everywhere and me and my brother almost went flying off until my mom grabbed us
Why is the belt so relatable 😭 my mom had to use baby pins or poke holes and now, I STILL GOTTA DO IT and like the only think that's growing is my stupid fucking fat belly which only shrinks when I fucking run till my legs can't support my body
Glad you addressed this. I've been told "your so lucky to be so skinny" from a girl who isn't even fat she just has a gut. And I honestly hate it so fucking much because I want to gain weight but it's hard for me. I remember wanting to break down crying at the doctor's cause they said within 6 months I only gained a pound. It's upsetting..
I can’t dance either😭your not alone!
I eat a dozen fried chickens in one sitting? Nope i ain't even getting a pound off of that
This is soooo fucking relatable
I'm skinny and this just related
YES this is relateble like you know everyone even strangers will be like "omg do you even eat " "i am afraid i might break your arms they are like stick"  and thats the most annoying thing people will ever ask me
Im the same way and it sucks and I've had all this happen to me and the comments about it are the absolute worst.
I use to be skinny as hell. I had a 24 waist in high school and was super lean from my time training in martial arts. But still had the other problems, sitting down, dancing, cold all the time and certain clothes not fitting but as I grew up it all kinda went away as I put on more muscle mass. Just eat healthy and treasure what you have because one day you might miss it. Unless it’s actually absolutely miserable
I can't dance and I'm fat
Jayus: I cAnT dAnCe Me: Me nei- *sees excessive dancing* -bish you lying
Us fat guys can’t dance either
same😪
Finally I found a video that explains all my pain
Yeah thats my older brother over there hes skinny as fuck he has to eat and drink medicine
Relateable about sitting, especially metal chairs, also shop from the teens  section sometimes lmao 🤣
I can relate to all of this even though I’m not skinny…WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!
They always look at me like I'm on medication and been starving my whole life.. like come on, if we had an eating competition I'd most definitely beat them by a mile
I can relate
Ye no I’m pretty sure the last one is a u problem
I don’t think the dancing one is a skinny person problem I think that’s just you😂
Jayus: you cant dance when your skinny   Charli: who said that
I'm not skinny but I can't dance too 🥲
on number 3. I hate it T o T
You call it skinny?😂 you were definately not skinny honey
I'm 14 and my weight is 20 kg so i het picked on alot
Same
Quick question is it normal that people will pick you up to see how much you way because you look so skinny or did that only happen to me?
I think being thin is not the reason why she can't dance😂
As someone who has been SUPER skinny my whole life these are so true
Those are some hot moves🤣🤣...... I think you got the dance part under check
No cuz this is to relatable- also with the belt situation I suggest an eyelet belt as the holes go all the way around since I got one life had been way easier and also it suits my style so yuh lmao
SO TRUE
So true I am very skinny like tooo skinny and.. none of my clothes fit
I can relate
Same
The best dance
Do we all live the same fukin life
I just noticed that she looks like my big brother.... he has all those problems
Me too onlyjayus. Me too
The dances
All were true besides 4 & 6
Im really skinny but I can dance I do competition 😎
The clothes and belt is my problem 🙄 😖😅 it's really annoying
Jayus can dance
FLAT!
You can dance tho.
That's not cause you're skinny that's cause you have horrible dance moves No  Offense
Me: i wanna be skinny Her: there are skinny people problems
You can dance better than me🙃
I was damn skinny and underweight that I constantly fell sick . After puberty I got curvy and ppl started to call me fat ...... Stupid judgmental ppl so they could just piss off 💪💪💪
“thats fucked up to say to a kid” hmm so is the n word
I'd rather have been skinny my whole life since I've been overweight a majority of my childhood and it sucked. I felt awful and people would talk shit about me when I would be nice to pretty much everyone. Atleast then I wouldnt have had the memories of being in 3rd grade sucking my stomach in on the way to lunch because I was scared of being called a hippo. I'd probably still have self esteem issues regardless since kids are mean but it wouldnt have been so bad that I cry myself to sleep and binge eat my problems away. Worst part was when I dropped alot of weight I started getting attention from women and men. I was practically invisible before but suddenly men stared at me when I was in public and women would compliment my outfits.
I'm 13 fit and 180 lbs
FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT-
I think it's just you that doesn't know how to dance
I’m sorry but that dancing is better than mine also I don’t have those problems (I’m CHUNKY)
Same😌
As a skinny person I can't confirm this is all true
like competition
actually i’m rly skinny too but a dance
I’m 16 and only 95 lb
I am skinny and I can confirm all of that has happened to me
I understand you
The fug you talking bout those are master like moves
You still dance better than me      Yeah I'm joking
She is pretty
Oh my god THIS IS THE SAME
The cold one I am the opposite I’m overweight and fell like the attic and mount everset combined x10
True ;-;
I you can literally see my ribs through my skin
I like your dance moves ✓ i have to poke holes into my belt too -_-
I grew up really skinny and I had a friend tell me that I give bad hugs because my bones stab them :/ never gave hugs after that
I am skinny too :)
I'll be more than happy to lend you 200 pounds
I have the same problems but I think you lied about that last one
Alr, let's talk, I'm thick as f u c k man, like I'm not obese, but I have thunder thighs that spread out to a little over a foot wide when I sit down, and the pants thing, they fall for us too. I have an ass. Like a s s . And funny enough, instead of it h o l d i n g my pants up (you'd think they'd have a hard time getting over), instead it *drags them down with every step.* And if you wear a belt with an ass, it kinda positions weird in the back, and when you've also got stomach fat, it digs into your stomach when you sit. Also because of how my fat is rationed around my body,  every part of me is pretty much constantly a different temperature from the others.
eh i cant feel bad for skinny people. you can dress and act however you want without being judged. people seem to like skinny people more than bigger people, it’s just how to world works.
I can relate to this hah. Ha.
Yes
Loved the dance
For real tho
I relate to but I am a pretty good dancer but I’m in dance but I relate to everything else I’m always cold even in like 72 degree weather like bruh
Never thought I would relate yo a vid that much And these that "body positivity" movement makes skinny people feel worse. What do we do???
Not to mention if you get hit it hurts a lot more
Exactly been there
Yes you definitely hit this video love it . Thank you as a skinny person it hurts to sit for many reasons and i always wear hoodies. And im scared for anyone to comment on me or my body thats why i don’t like compliments.
That dance 😆😆
All of these are so true
I am 13 and I’m 66 pound my annoying little brother is 33 pound and he is 4 his tall as hell for his age lol
I’m also very skinny, and my cousin calls me a skeleton and a twig
So 👍 ttue!!! I cannot dance at all
Okay Dancing is a you problem
I’m the opposite and this makes sense, especially 4
Thanks im so short
SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMME!!!!
As a skinny person, my friends call me twig and it really p**ses me off
The dance thing is just you
Ur still skinny
I’m 66lbs I’m 11
I’m still struggling with this. I’m glad I’m not the only one. People always tell you how “your so lucky to be skinny” but they don’t see that there are lots of cons that come with it as well. It’s probably my biggest insecurity and it doesn’t help when I have my entire family and friends telling me 24/7 “oh wow your so skinny” “look at your legs they are so tiny” “do you even eat?” “You’re you’re going to blow away you have no meat on your bones” it especially hurts when it’s something you can’t control because it’s genetic. It hurts.
What do you mean you can't dance? That's dancing 👏👏👏👏🥰
I always thought I looked ugly and sickly all because people told me, "do you take vitamins?", "Eat more." and stuff like that All. THE. TIME. Even I myself wanted to gain more weight but I just couldn't.
I could dance
That’s brave having that “ *dance* “
I wish I could be skinny
You gotta tell me what you do because Iam trying to get skinny
I'm mega skinny and I have been my whole life, and I gotta say I 💯 relate to these.
I'm skinny and I can dance perfectly fine
Being  skinny as frick I swear all of these are true
This so true iam skinny  and I have those problems  and iam like: 😀👌
Man I’m fr jealous of Jayus- is that a bad thing 😅?
I’m so skinny. I KNOW RIGHT. I FIT INtO NOTHING ONLY MY 6 YEAR OKD SOTERS CLOtHs………🤨😎😤
Can relate omg 💀☝️ im more than 1,60 and my weight (is that right?) Is 48 k 💀
I am to
Ah yes onlyjayus dancing
I always had the looks of "who are you peasants to call me " and never been uncomfortable with it cause I did want to be fit , so my confidence of my body is strong
I have been fat for most of my life and I hate the heat and love the cold
I honestly want to be skinny- but i am not Am over the average weight for my age and height  I tried everything to make myself skinnier, it just doesn't work
Omg I can relate sooo bad
I’ve been called stick and twig multiple times
i used to be really skinny in 5th and i got the opposite type of making fun of they would say “olivia you eat so much but yet your so skinny” i never realized it’s body shaming and if you ever get made fun of for being skinn just know you can’t do anything except surgery or sm but u are very very pretty and perfect! i love you!
When I have clothes I look stick thin But when I wear bikini, my boobs and curves exist I’m 36C cups and it’s average right?
Same like all of them😭
kpop idols with skinny body and dancing *baby im not even here im just a hallucination*
The last part is my favorite
I am dead your dance movs soooooooooooooo funny hahaha
THATS SO TRUE! Also people think you have a perfect life just because you’re skinny
SAME i have been Skinny sence i was born
Also, it's nowadays almost more difficult to find a size XXS then it is to find a size XXL
In this world- your either to skinny or too fat. People have a way to hate on anybody. And thats sad. People. Need to grow up and accept each other’s differences
If you have problems being skinny just imagine being fat like me😔
I am really skinny but my hip bones are so wide and that makes me big so like tf?
THANK YOU!!!! This is just too relatable. I'm 16 and I'm the skinniest person I've ever met.
I know how it feels 🥲
*gosh I look like a skinny legend when I dance*
AS A FUCKING STICK THAT'S SO TRUE LMAO😂😭
I needed moves , I got her moves , now I. Dance like that everywhere
Ive always been bullied because ive been skinny whole entire life..even my family do discrminate me :(   They will always say that "why cant you lift that up its so easy!!","why are you so slow","Your useless" 🤧😷
Her I can’t dance Me I think that’s just you
Well ive only seen people getting bullied for being fat... and i was one of them. I still cant imagine what is bad about being bullied
I relate
Ok I’m skinny and this so so true like whyyy  Heh I’m nicknamed “twig” at my school  And I here ppl saw omg I could break your f****** legs in half
I’m only 3 stone 11
Especially a short and skinny like me
I already hate the society it's just too judgement to breathe in but we're going good. Besides that, gurl u got some moves 💃💃💃
Same sis same sis I understand you 🥺
#5 Society: Yeah, that happens to me all the time. People always assume I'm starving myself when in actuality I just have a really fast metabolism lol
Ex👏ac👏tl👏y
this is so fricking RELATABLE LIKE I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY omG dO yoU gIve Her tO eat Like OmG So weAk LIKE MF B-
100% relatable
I get most of those and I’m always warm and I’m a 💃
I think laying down like this hurts most people.
"Cant dance" Kpop idols: hold my soju
Swear much?
Someone asked me if i was vegan and i was eating a HOTDOG
Lol I’m 10 and I’m 71.4 and my cousins are like 90 something they are younger
Other than the dance part, the rest are so fuckin true it's crazy. People think skinny people have it easy until they go through what skinny people go through, not saying others don't it's just that no one has it easier. My clothes NEVER fit my mom always has to sew them for me🙂
female npesta
brah this is too relatable
With the belt one my skinny friend doesn't wear one she wears shoe laces instead
I think you dance very well! But I was skinny growing up and it's true that even when I was a rather good dancer, something looks a bit "noodly" aboit dancing when you're on the thinner side haha so I would say that it actually is related! Again, not about actual dance skills but about how it looks 🍜
Hey I’m pretty skinny. I relate to everything, except for the dancing thing. I’m a dancer. I know how to dance!
I love her dancing😂😂😂just crazy af like me
Same i am tooooo skiny!!!! I relate to this
I raise my hand for the third one Everybody tease me for that one But I have no choice to be a fat one I got no choice to be fat one *Sad piano plays* Mama Why Am I skinny Put some food ahead of me Still I eat but can't be fat Mama I was born skinny But now everyone thinks I am funny
You are going to make some lucky person very happy one day if not already. You are one cool lady.
The butbones and ribs make sense
My friends mam calls me skinny like spagghetti
Just eat some cake
I looveee jaayuss
I get you 😔👍
Her dance 💀💀💀
I swear i can relate but whenever i eat to much i CANT gain weight
This is way too relatable its scary
Oh, cry me a river.
Girl I'm skinny too..and the one I find is not relatable is dancing... I can dance 🌺perfectly🌺
I got used to it so I don't feel that cold anymore I do still feel it if it's like super cold Why I have trust issues
I don't know why people say people say "you need to eat something" to skinny people like me 😫😫😭😭  Do they really think they help us by saying this   Do they really expect us to give reaction like - ohhh my god😱😱😱 bro that's a so good idea I never knew I need to eat something to look less skinny you really helped me your a life saver bro 😮😍  I want to tell them that we feel bad when they say this line like eat something you're so skinny or something like that
Same, dancing is not one of my best skills
I WANT TO BE SKINNY. 😂🙂🌚🌚🌚
im 40 kgs and i constantly think im fat!! #bodydysmorphia!
I'm also
This still don't change my mind that being skinny is worse than being fat
Relatable ?  Me : yes  How much ?  Me : yessssssssssss
Sorry, I've been fat my whole life. I'd take your problems over mine. I CAN dance though.
I used to have those issues I still have some of them but I used to be covered in buses on my pelvic bones and ribs because I danced and when I did curtain moves it caused bruises on my pelvic and ribs and shoulders
Why are these so true im 11 And everyone calls  me a stick because I’m so skinny even if I eat a ton it does nothing
Being fat is just worse but i get how you feel lol
At least you dance better than I do
I am also and when there is really strong wind I start kinda blowing away
Bro l am the exact same but I do not get bruises like that. I CANT DANCE AAAAHHHHH
Literally this person explain everything. 👏👏
Nah, you gotta learn it for dancing. You see those skinny kpop idols? (Not saying that they're not healthy, that might be their body type or something) but they dance well so it's not about being skinny for that one.
That's true i go through all of this
Same bro
This is very relatable for me lol
Nah your the best dancer of all time
I get most of my clothes tailored to fit me
The belt problem is so relatable
💯 % can relate
"I can't dance" Rosè being thin as heck and still is the lead dancer.
As someone who use to be 260 I do miss the all natural seat cushions and the organic insulation. It’s to cold in Chicago to be skinny. 😅
How tall are you?
So true I still have the same problem😔
As a  skinny girl i can relate to not only the society's comments my own family's too
Skinny or less weight people can dance who is Charlie 🤣
to be honest those are the best dance moves i’ve seen in a while
You can dance you should be the next charlie d'amelio
I'm thin To XD I feel like ima die
you can dance
TOO TRUE (also being body shamed for being skinny for most of the time)
I fucking felt that
O dear I think u r just fine as u r ...... !
"oh god" *me noticing that i have lots of  this Problems to* (im wearing often Things Like wide Hoodies and stuff so i dont Look skinny
Why she's so 😍. I'm straight 🤣 dafg she's so Amazing 🥺🤤😂😍
I think being chubby isn't that bad anymore 🧍🏾‍♀️
What do you mean that's how I dance
I skinny that's a you problem
Relatable
Just eat
I’m trying to get weight but I cantt
The poking holes into the belt made me happy I actually got a little fat😭😂
I realate to all these lol not only that but I'm short so I'm made fun of for that to
I can't relate to the being racist part. Lmao
Umm I think you just called your own moves out dangggg
FFFFFFFFFF YOUUUUUU please don’t talk about being skinny.
It's sad how reliable this is 😭✌️
All facts
God loves y’all Dios los ama God bless y’all Dios los bendiga 👑❤️👑❤️✝️🙏🥰
Sitting hurts my butt 😭
Idk girl you caN  dance better than me LMAO
I don't think you being skinny has nothing to you being a bad dancer
OMFG I CAN RELATE IM TALL AND SKINNY AND IT SUCKS, FINALLY AN INFLUENCER WHO ISNT SHORT AND THICC
Start lifting weights might help
Wait  So what gender ?
I am also very skinny and have bine my whole life like I’m literally 13 and I am 4’11 tall an I Weight 64 pounds it’s kinda sad cus I do get made fun of like today was really windy and lots of people looked over at me and said “don’t blow away” like thx captain obvious.
Same here. Everyone's like damn your skinny. 😢 Like come onnn.
I can relate so much,and what's worse is that society thinks that being called skinny is a compliment,Like yes if someone worked out to get skinny then it is a compliment but someone who has constantly eat to gain weight,it hurts.Alot.
As a skinny 300 pound discord moderator, I can relate. 😏
I literally can’t relate more!!!
Nice dancing lol I dance like that to
This is so relatable🙄🤚🏼except the dancing part. But this shit sucks😂
Yeah I can vouch.
Iv been callwd a midget 5 times
Thats me now
Try laying down and doing a few sit ups :) if your skinny enough your tail bone will dig right into the ground making it near impossible without a pillow lol
I have been growing up like this and I can’t take the comments I get and the way my parents talk to me about it
I’m LITTERALY so skinny too
i was skinny my whole life and i've always been told "you should eat more" "you look like you'll be blown away by the wind" "you look like a twig" like what the fuck i'm only 7 years old😕😕😕
Ima skinny and all of these are true except for the fact i can dance
I've been skinny half of my life. My mom made me get fat. I'm getting skinnier. Its sad tho..
Finally someone I relate to😔
When I was a baby a doc told my mom to poor butter on my food because I was too skinny
Oh no, jayus, I’m quite sure you can dance.
Im only ten and I get body shamed alot people call me a stick and say I’m so skinny I’m weak and also once a girl said ahahaha like I’m scared of a skinny bone and it hurts and my mom forced me to be skinny and in a year I only gain four pounds
Idk who told you you cant dance, but they clearly lied
I think that last one is just self thing but I am a skinny person to and this was relatable
this is so relatable because no matter what i do im always cold fr 🤦‍♀️
None of my pants fit so I sew elastic on them 😂
You can dance better than us and we are sure not skinny! 😂😂
This is all so true-
This is me like that is all true
OH MY GOD! This is sooo true! As a skinny person I would have a lot of problems, like for example, size 4 clothing would be too tight but size 5 would be too big. And when my parents say that I need to eat more, they don't understand that after a point I'd be so full I'd feel like exploding 😂. #skinnypplproblems
It hurts me how being skinny, chubby, or average always make me unhappy. I'm really never satisfied with my body. Maybe I should work on being muscular?
I love the dancing one.
Thank you this is very relatable
IK    Not skinny anymore, I started working out and somehow now I have big thighs and hips... How😭   Pants still don't fit tho
I have The same problems I am so skinny too
No that’s me
I recently got into leather totally in crafting and now I have a whole bunch for a belts and I can make my own beltd
LIKE UGHHHHH she gets what I MEAn😀😀😀
This is so true on skinny person to another
Ooh what sports have you played?
This is so right because I do dance competition and I feel like I’m a lot worse than the normal sized ppl
So relatable
Still dances better than me🤷‍♂️
I feel you
That’s so true I’m too skinny to
I can relate 1000% like dafuq
Facts as a skinny person I can 1000% Relate
For real
Kinda like the dancing
Yes i get made fun of for being about 20 ibs underwgheit thrn i should be
My dad mentions my weigh alot note to u im 11 and weigh 110-100 pounds (IS THAT GOOD?)
I m trying my whole.life to get skinny
can’t relate
Stop complaining people get shamed way worse
The dance thing is your fault
Hey you got better dancing skills then me
Relatable
ik
Gurl im 10 and im like the same weight as u-
Ok i believe the last one🤣 btw I'm skinny too!
when ur ligit a minor but your heavier than jayus:
I am a boy and i recently gain some weight and now i feel better and i can relate to everything especially that dance 😂
Me: *being skinny my whole life* Everyone who sees me: Why are you so skinny, are you starving yourself? Your like a walking skeleton! Also Me: *Finally having a normal weight* Everyone: Your eating like a pig, can't you see how fat you got?!
SUPER RELATABLE
The dancing 😂 😂
Everyone bloody says "You need to eat" "your to skinny" I EAT SO MUCH- I DONT KNOW WHY THE HELL PEOPLE SAY THAT- Like- I would be in the school dinner hall until year 6 was there (one time I was late to class!)
I've been plus size my entire life and have had the majority of those happen, my ribs don't bruise they just hurt if I lay on the floor, but like, most of that has happened to me except instead of being told to eat more it was the opposite
I feel you
I love the way you are
Lmao idk but that cold thing and that lying down thing is just so true omfg
The way she danced
So true i understand that pain mostly the sasayaty ones.
IN KINDERGARTEN I LITERALLY HAD TO STAND AT THE WALL AT RESSES ON WINDY DAYS SO I DIDNT FUCKING BLAW AWAY 😭 😭 😭
Im skinny but I can dance
O my gosh it's so relatable
The dancing part is normal, we all cant dance
I can relate Soo much like I eat A LOT and never get fat ( which I'm thankful for)
1, 3, 5, 6 Been stuck wid dat crap my whole fkin life
66 lbs?- oml. that ain’t healthy
All of the things are true for me bc im skinny af as well     Especialy the dance thing
Omg this is so relatable like i always hear comments like "Don't you eat?" "Dosen't your mother give you food?" "You'll get blown away by the wind" like these just irritates me so much.😑😶
I am also very skinny and the comments from others are the worst. Also buying jeans is very unfortunate, because there are problems with the size all the time. Thank you for this understanding video!
This is so trueeee
as a skinny and tall person, I can relate
Bella: like finally blah blah blaj Me: wow i thought you were a boy..
I can  relate 😭🥲 I get used to this skinny comments becuz literally my whole life I have been called skinny like everywhere I go
I am not that skinny but definitely its relatable the lying down shit bitch that hurts
i am feeling that ass and rib pain while im watching this;-;
I have one question are you a girl or boy???
I’m pretty skinny but I have insane temperature resistance
OMG THIS IS SO FUCKING RELATABLE ESPECIALLY THE SITTING DOWN AND LAYING DOWN FOR TOO LONG
True
She looks like she's 6'3
Yea, you CAN do a little boogie 😌🕺👯‍♀️😂😂
Trust me gaining and losing weight is equally as hard.
As someone skinny and been skinny for my whole life .it’s suck’s and it’s not my fault I eat and don’t gain weight that I want to gain cause I’m tired of people picking on me about being skinny , I have to laugh it off but it hurts
Skinny people can dance (*remembers lalisa manobal*)
Nickname by family members was ‘Skeleton’ I always took stuff like that as a compliment though
I feel u skinny people
Now I think being the older sis is cool cuz ik how it feels to be called a stick 24/7 seeing by lil one suffering from the same shit hurts and everything in this video is true af expect the dancing one ig cuz I have been a dancer whole lyf soo yaa
I think that last one applies to anyone I'm not skinny and I can't dance to save my life
I relate a lot, I'm 14 and I weigh like seven or eight kgs less than I'm supposed to, the only bit i don't relate to is the dancing because I have danced since I was in third grade and even tho I'm skinny and I've always played either main or front row during dances. Other than that I relate to everything
I relate to all of this 😂
"I can't dance" says it and then dances amazingly
I understand
U r so beautiful.. i am sure lot of guys hit on you
Finaly someone to relate to 🤗❤😑
As a dude it’s even worse. It was kinda horrible growing up. It’s literally the reason I become an obsessed gym rat😭 and eat 5 high protein meals a day now.
im wayy too skinny-   lol this is way too relatable this is literally me    and bro people tell me to eat when i eat an entire full day’s worth of food for just breakfast and cant gain weight no matter what. i have a healthy diet but still, can’t gain weight.
I'm a skinny person to🤣. AND CAN RELATE TO ALL THOSE. 🤣🤣🤣🤣... But I can dance a little. 😅
Damn... You can't dance...
WEAR TIGHTS
I'm 40lbs overweight and I can't dance..... does that mean I'm skinny 🤔
Lmao I had the nickname skeleton. My assbones and spine used to hurt when I lied down. I've been literally told to eat for years by people who eat a quarter of what I consume everyday. And dancing,oh lord. I have been publically humiliated for looking awkward while dancing in front of tens of people multiple times every time we had a school function
Thank you
Lmao the danceing
My pe teacher was talking to some girls in my class and she called me, I went there,  SHE GRABBED MY ARM AND PROCEDED TO SAY: - MY son's arm is skinnier than his. (Her son is 7 years old and I'm 14) WHY WOULD SHE COMPARE A 14 YEAR OLD TO A 7 YEAR OLD
legit just looks like a 13 yo white boy. like stfu
I wear 2 layers of clothes to not look so skinny, even in summer.
I’m skinny too
more of a you problem
How do I relate to all of this I can’t dance at all
I don’t know if you think of it as a insecurity but you are perfect how you are so keep being positive and thanks for posting
My belt usually need to be punch new 3 holes Everytime . This video is the most relatable to me.
True as me being 62 Lbs.. I need to see a doctor..
Sounds like a u problem
I’m glad I’m not the only one experiencing these skinny problems : )
I used to be 38 kg 7 months ago
me: who is skinny enough to see my ribs and experience none of these things  also me: am I even human
I haven’t broken 70.00 and my funniest story is having a weight of 66.6 pounds for three days.
is that a boy or girl? 😂
Skinny gang leave a like
Sweet moves
so relatable like my whole family is like eat some meat
Bruh how u gonna be 66.5 pounds I'm ten and I 75.3 pounds
C’mon less be honest… most people can’t dance😂🤣 not trying to be rude tho that’s just how it is for me😂
So true. but that last one is a you problem
Shit, I'm so attracted to her right now especially after that dance move 😂
As a stick this is all true
Relatable!
Yes all the skinny problems I have, kids and teachers hate me for sitting on my feet
Soo true
So that's why I can't dance
I'm 167 kg
Yesss
Yesss
i would definitely like to blame my inability to dance on my skinniness
Haha
Do u know how easy it is to put on weight compared to slimming down...?  Supermodels have skinny bodies....
Atleast you aré not Mr. Burns skinny, he could go to a skeleton party and not get any looks!
Im skinny and someone asked me if i was anorexic and that was a few weeks ago 🦔
I come from a half Samoan half Maori family and I'm one of the only two skinny Mf in this family
They aren’t that skinny
So relatable for us Skinny Legends
Belt thing seems to be just a normal thing. I had to make new holes to use my belt. I still use the "smallest" hole and by weight I am freaking overweight.
The dancing thing is a white people problem
Lol same I am 23kg at 11
I..I…I  Thank you! Finally someone said it!!!!!
Im 5 foot 8 and i weigh 49kg lel
The worst part is comments 😑😑. They psychologically hit different 😩
I relate to that.   I feel you
I can fucking relate girllll!

So light that a stiff breeze can blow her away.
I'm skinny and my "friends" had one of there friends over and no offense but she was fat we were all sitting on the couch and she came up to me and my brother slapped are stomachs and you need eat a Burger
I’m very skinny
Same
I freaking  WEIGH 59 POUNDS AND I AM IN 5TH GRADE AND I EAT A LOT OF MEAT INGACT ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOODS
DID I JUST SEE SHOES IN THE HOUSE??
Bro I’m super skinny so I get this
Yeah when I was 10 I was really skinny and once a teacher took me into her room and said do you even eat I would eat so much but was always so skinny
Can't relate cuz i am chubby but it must be hard for y'all . Tc ❤️
Same
I mean you’re better than me at dancing, at least
/: i worked for getting to 49kg for a year. I gained 2 kg from 43. Then i dropped back to 43.
As a person who is thicc, I have been called by my mom "You need a diet" like 100 times and bruh You said many times "This is your own life make your own decisions" now you tell me I need a diet
Wait did that say 66lbs??? That is not healthy
I can 100% relate pluse those annoying relatives also mocks you like "do your mom even gives you food" "omg poor kid" like dude i ain't diein so something-
I am 10 I'm still skinny and a lot of people say rude things😔😪
me not skinny .-. ok
There's a Time in my life where I wanna be Fat 🤣
jayus dance really be hitting hard
You don’t look skinny tho you look healthy?
How are you 6 foot 3
For the dance one how does blackpink dance lol🤣
One time in school some fat kid went up to my really skinny friend and asked do you eat I responded with: do you stop eating
As someone who has been skinny all their life, this is accurate
Honestly same. Im like 43kg. Not gonna lie I look boney when I dance.
You might be a model being so skinny and tall.. you should love this ..you're lucky and beautiful ..girl it's a blessing..you should use it to your own benefit
😂 Exact issue I have here bestie lol
I HATE when fat old folks condescendingly ask me if I eat. Like yes, dingus, do YOU exercise?
I would always be bullied for being super skinny so i took their advice and ate ALOT MORE and now im being bullied for my obesity. They just cant ever be happy can they. 😖😖😭
I am lighter than a five year old
I could relate to all of these except the dance part. Anyways the comments people give are the worst.
I've lost about 12 kgs over the past few months and I never realized how cold it gets during winter. I need to put on some muscle
I’m sorry but your dance moves are funny but relatable 😂🤣
Very true but to add on to getting bruises on ur ribs i have curly ribs meaning they stick out so it hurts more
I had a parent who’d joke my ribs are “making them hungry”
Ngl , that's the best dance moves I have ever seen in my life
I'm a skinny.person too
Thank god im fat...
Don’t worry it worked out for me
I think you dance pretty good 👍!!!!
I punch holes in my belt, just the other way around
My parents call me a skinny mini
As someone who grew up in Africa  , your old photos look like a good normal weight though ? 😐
I feel this pain.
Ur dancing is better than mine
I really like you as a person! I wish  their was woman like you near me
5 10 128pounds and 28 yrs old I'm doing fine
It’s just that us white people can’t dance. It’s alright.
I can relate
Woe is me
I'm skinny, but at least I haven't said the n word
The belt thing hits home. I got a slide ratcheting belt cuz no adult belts fit me.
I can't dance either
That last one is a white people problem
She soo cool.tho
I think the last one is on you
Nice dance moves!
She might be skinny, but she's also racist
Me and my friend have always been skinny but she's skinnier than me, and she literally came crying to me the other day about how she felt it was so sad when people called her skinny and it hurts so much, this should be a type of body shaming. People struggle with this a lot.
I think your dance moves are hella good😌
It's so true all of it
I am a skinny person and the part about being cold is the most  relatable thing ever, then I saw the belt one and I was like y’all just tied for first
Ehh petite women are my type tbh
The dancing yes
Lmao u a stick just eat some burgers n shit it ain’t hard
Still beautiful
Doesn't matter for me anymore
You are so sweet 😊
I get thoae commwnts alot as a 104 poumd 13 year old. It hurtla alot and pepole need to stop makeing them
Same
My problems
Shes been skinny because she got thrice or maybe fourice growth sprouts
That dance made my day gurl
I'm not skinny but I can't dance either so we can vibe-🕺
That’s me
Bruh my friends still say I’m gonna blow away when there’s wind.
I luke being fat but not that fat
The last one is not true I have a skinny friend and she dances really good
Me 😭, I even eat at night and before sleep. I seriously don't know why I can't gain weight
Still under weight even when i eat like pig
I can relate too, almost EVERY member of my family just takes one look at me and says "WHY ARENT YOU EATING WHERE'S THE MEAT" I mean sure I wear size small shirts and clothes for kids but everyone doesn't really have to barge into my life like that  Summary is: I like being a skinny legend 😎
Dont forget it hard to walk in the wind
I hate her, you dont have to act cool by cussing
I relate to you my whole ass life is full of shames cause of it
You are just like me  Im sick of everyone telling me that im to skinny and shit it makes me wanna die
- everything is so relatable i still remember when my parents bought me a new watch, so i tried it on but it slipped of my wrist and it got scratched:'>
Perfect dance
That's why I figures out to not be quiet and talk back to the people that said those things and also why I   buy like the edgy belts that have the holes going the entire way around the belt
It hurts 😩 I know😅
Me whos lived in a cold place from like birth, like im skinny but like i cant live without the fan on, cus im like used to cold, and anything that is like hot burns my fing skin
Me being chubby asf my whole Life: 🧸
Too much cursing in this one lol
I'm skinny but I eat a LOT of food. And people tell me to eat more food while I literally eat ALL day. Being skinny is just a part of my genes. It's not that I don't eat food. And by the way according to my dumbass friend and this dumbass world, if ur skinny, fuck you!, If ur fat fuck you! and if ur normal, why tf r u this normal? This society is so fucked!
Omg I'm so skinny and tbh I'm 13 years old I'm 4 foot 3 and I weigh 64 pounds and I eat (alot)
Sabra I would like all of this I am so skinny
Damn can relate
I have the some problem as you My mom my antie's say why do you not eat ,I eat so much
This is so true my friends and family always used to call ne a matchstick or a stick which made get insecure and now I never wear sleeveless tops or shorts
can relate
When I went to get my vaccine, the nurse repeatedly asked me if I had eaten that day. I told her I had breakfast but hadn't had lunch yet( not true- I had eaten nothing all day). She asked me multiple times if I'll be okay and won't faint 😇
You dance like possessed giant praying mantis
That dance tho
I thought her dancing was 🔥
It’s the ischium 🍑🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣
7. People automatically assume you’re weak
Are you a boy or girl
As a chubby person I also can’t dance so we can suck at dancing together
Being a big guy. Its hard to brearh sometimes, your so hot, you need to get a new pair of clothes every month or two and also you get judged for your weight.
Why is this so relatable I’m so skinny
You dance better than me and I’m not that skinny (no offense)
Thank you for this! Ahh. The bruises are why I refuse to lay like that. And ya the belt one is great.
I didn’t think much about my body when I was a kid till everyone started commenting about how skinny I was. I only then started getting self conscious about everything. People need to just chill and let me live. As long as I’m healthy to a decent degree, u don’t gotta worry about me. Gaining weight and fat isn’t that easy for everyone.
Me
Ya pretty much And when they say "i can just blow u away (like a feather)" or "you cant fight me ill just break u in half" Like no bitch u wont ill break u in fckin half
Can't dance? Looks like you're busting a move to me.
Omg nook not the  Ribs and bruises it just makes me cringe  and hurt
Thought I was the only one who got the bruises
90% true
Relatable
Dude the bruise thing my brother gets that I always feel bad for him.
I’m actually very underweight and I’ve been skinny my whole life. This is true though
I'm younger and skinny I weight less
I'm skinny but I can still dance
I'm gonna puke from the amount of zooming
66 is still very light I am only 14 and I am 130 pounds.
No one's ever really good dancer anymore everyone been stuck in quarantine with all just lost the game.
I’m actually kinda glad that I’m not skinny bc I have zero of these problems instead I have different problems, like I get too warm, you get cramps from running too much (sometimes), and you can’t grow into clothes if they don’t even have your size!
Holy shit. I love your videos. You always find a way to bring a smile to my face 😀
My doctors are convinced that I have  an eating disorder. Everytime I go they have a talk with Mr about telling the truth after I say that I don't make myself throw up 🙄.
I can relate to all off them
So accurate omg
Had like a new hole in my belt everyday was confusing at times. Its actually deciding which one to go with that takes the longest.
as a skinny person who in 2 years might go on pointe I hope I can
I'm skinny as fuck and I feel this
Why are they like so fucking cute?
I know this may come as rude but r u a girl or a boy? Sry if that sound rude it’s not meant to be
I’ve legit seen worse dancing
Your not alone I’m skinny
Lol i weigh more than u and im 12 i think thats bad for me lol
First time I’m happy to be fat
The tall also contributes
I’m enerexic and I have 11 dance Medals and 2 trophy’s
F***
Onlyjayus: I CAN'T DANCE Also onlyjayus: dances better then me Me: THEN WHAT IS THAT
SO FRIKIN TRUE
Okay .......  I'm skinny..........   AND I CAN RELATE SO MUCH    LIKE... HOW?????
Update 54
The thing is i can eat a hole thanksgiving diner everyday and i dont gain Weight you think thats good no its not its sad for me
Enjoy it! U will look young for longer. It's worth the bs we went thru as childhood
I cant gain weight, up until march to september i ate pizzas almost everyday i could without exercise. Im still really skinny, it doesnt really look lkke it tho because im short
With the cold it dosent matter of you skinny or not I'm 78kg but I don't get cold easily even if there's snow
You are better then me at dancing
This is so fucking truee for someone like me who have been skinny my whole ass life till now and for some fucked up reason cant gain weight!😭🤝
My parents or grandparents always told me to get some meat on my bones not knowing how it can effect me as a kid which I still am
Yah... I lost a lot of weight... I never knew how cold winter was...lol. when you go from 300 to 180 you learn the meaning of COLD
You know which body type don't get mocked? None of them.
Does being skinny also make you racist?
So relatable her dancing was the funniest thing I have seen all day 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
You’re Canadian af
Formerly being significantly overweight and then dropping 100lbs I felt Hella bad giving my skinny friends shit for always being cold, I now have a hoodie within reach at all times.
Haha I been skinny all my life too and all them problems she said are so dam true  😂😂😂 I have no problem with the cold since I’m always hot but the rest are true lol Also I can’t dance either haha I dint know it’s a skinny person problem wtf 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Yesss
*me who's spine and ribs stick out of my skin* I agree
Am I the only one who thought she weighed 664 lbs?
Okay, but I wish I was skinny, instead of bulky with a pop belly.
Am skinny too
reject weakness, embrace aesthetics
Am I the only one that wants her to come out as a transgender man?  (Not as in like, pushing trans against her, just as in I think it fits her so well)
Excuse me I’m sorry but I though you said you couldn’t dance?
Am fat
Usually ur metabolisms is going to fast so it’s burning through everything so yeah
At least we can fit through small spaces and laugh at the ones who can’t
Watches don't fit usually
As a skinny person everything is true in this video for me unfortunately.
I’m super skinny and I hate it because of these reasons
I think this is me.
I have to poke new holes
I relate to all of them I also have short problems
Honestly   I can't dance either  and that's why at parties, I just sit down or go back to my room
Bro ... This is me
Im fat so i feel like in a volcano with my blanket
Pretty sure we fat people can’t dance ether
Damn those dance moves are better then mine (;v;)
Oh fa
I feel u I am skinny to
God i love you. Skinny girl problems are rwal.
As a skinny person most of these actually relate to me
It’s better to be too skinny, than be a little fat.
Jayus: I can't dance Me: those some pretty fly dance moves
I think your beautiful/handsome (or whatever you prefer bc last time I checked you had they/them pro nouns) just they way you are
Put on muscle
I'm not skinny but I do relate to having to poke holes in my belt😭 in fact I used to be chubby but I slimmed down some
I don't know. Being told to eat ..beats being called FAT ASS.
It's a shame you aren't as entertaining as you are thin.
My parents used to tell me gonna I'm gonna fly away in the wind because I'm skinny
Say nothing just danse like her
I feel your pain have you seen me 😢
The dancing thing is so true tho 😭
All of those happen to me but my family say that I am skinny and I should go eat a steak
sitting down for long hurts my ass too and I'm overweight...
I have all these problems too such as my friends joking with me asking if all I eat are some low fat chips but really I just have fast metabolism
Sameeeee
IDK GURL, THEM MOVES WERE LIT AF!!!
Explains my sister :)
Hey you look good as a skinny person ( every one looks nice but you prob look the best of the skinny ppl
Im too fat
Your metabolism is probably really high mine is really low and i want to increase it
You’re in your 20s or whatever age you are and you weigh 66 pounds???
Shit number 3 and 4 I relate to-
The thing is I get called skinny but I'm the average weight for my age
THAT'S WHY I'M COLD ALL THE TIME?
I have this same problem I'm 4.7 and I'm a pre teen also I'm around 60 pounds
So true. I am a guy, just turned 18 two weeks ago, 6ft tall, and I weigh 125 on a good day. Life sucks😂😂😂
Jayus if u try it without ur shoes bc shoes have a weight
I don't know why but I am twice your weight and I am 12. I kind of feel bad for you
You dance just fine.
Ik it fucking sucks I need to eat shit
I can relate, except I've always had a tiny bit of belly flab.
Dude soo true
Yes and i eat to much food and i never get fat but that a good point
That’s me I am also very skinny my hole life and I have the same problems
I gotta say it’s real annoying to have the opposite problem of most Americans.
U muppet..nice dance moves..luv ur tough voice
What the f🤬
YUS. TOTALLY. THIS IS MY LIFE. My brother is an exception to the cold one, though...
**sighs** my life in a nutshell  Like, i legit broke a belt putting too many extra holes in it. I also get made fun of cause i get way too cold easily and the fact that i cant dance
In a nation full of obese people, embrace the thin you.
"WE CAN'T DANCE" Me:TRUE
So do you know FAT people problems we get made fun of, a lot of diets can't wear nice things we excerzize like CRAZY yet nothing happens I would be happy to be skinny🥺
Get suspenders it's better than a belt more comfortable
I think you dance like jagger
This is me all the dang time 😭😭
Same with all of this except I'm not in a healthy weight yet, but I'm trying.
Well that's happening to me too but people still telling me "omg stop eating" and things like that so yeah :')
What was that last part it looked like you were doggy paddling
I have been slender for my whole life I cannot dance either I feel your pain😭😭😭😭😭😭
Just cus I'm fat doesn't mean I can dance
I'm pretty chubby tbh but all of them except 5 are my problems too
This is literally me, I’m 5’6” and I don’t even weigh 100 lbs. Except the dancing part though, moves like jagger.
When they say do u eat go eat a burger or something I’m like what the hell do u want me to do I eat 5 times a day and then go to the bathroom and take a massive crap and lose 2 kg
Me who is skinny and loves the cold
Try just dance
I also cant dance
literally me but i’m also 6”5
I can't dance either and I'm not skinny
I literally went from my belt being too tight too me having to poke a hole in it😂😂
She reminds me of Ellen D
I am bigger then my uncle and i'm 10
WHAT A FUCKING LIAR! she got sweet moves!
People will never be content. I used to be called fat and people would say to stop eating, and now everyone calls me skin and bones and says I need to eat. Make up your freaking minds.
The fact is if you're skinny, they will make fun of you and if you're fat then too they will make fun of you. So we're not the problem.
Big flex-
I feel the pan
“I can’t dance!”  *Proceeds to fail at dancing*
Honestly same… I feel that… It’s depressing….
You are so fucking right! My least favourite was people would grab me when there was a gust of wind and say “ don’t let him get blown away”
I do not like you, but this is true.
True, btw It hard to gain pounds for me.
looks good
yeah and its hard for me to bulk considering whenever i do it gives me fats in the places i dont want them. and high metabolism
Girl you look great!!!! I wish I could say being bigger is any better
I'm not skinny and I can't dance either
I'm a skinny dude and I hate it
Im insanely underweight and cant get fatter somehow and i have every single problem in this video
We have the same problems
Feel your pain
I'm fat as f-. I wish I was skinny. I got fat shamed all the time, I got called a fat @$$ b!tch. I finally moved away from the school that had those kinds of people but they live in my brain.
Honestly the dance moves are pretty good
I'm 14 amd I weight 29kg.  Yeah, I only eat an Apple and two sweat potato a day.
If your over weight then you got made fun of but if your skinny then you got all these problems. That make zero sense and it’s f up.😢😔☹️
She's built like a teenage boy .
Dancing is a definite skinny person problem
At least your not fat because fat makes it so much harder.
Lol I mean everything you said sounds better than whatever Lizzo goes through. 🤷🏽‍♂️
U are a girl u can do the most dumb ass shit  dance Known to man and u will still get . Compliments
And people say we have it easy…
Same problems but am skinny and smol
gimme tips for crying out loud👌
My mom had to sew my swimsuit tighter in order for it to fit.
EXACTLY!
Just went from being a human stick figure almost my whole life to becoming rather large after high school, and I don't mean I became a fatass lol. It actually is pretty nice not being super skinny. I have the opposite problem with pants now, I have a fairly large waist and hips so now pants are always either too small in the waist or too long in the legs. Also having some weight on you can really make you strong, even if you're not super muscular. If you're at least strong enough to throw your weight around being big, you're pretty damn strong. I've always been decently strong, but now that I'm not skinny it helps in practical ways. At work, the guys skinnier than me are too weak to do certain specific things, while the guys fatter than me are too out of shape to do the things I do. Also went from ravenous eating as a kid to barely eating anymore. Still managed to gain over 100 pounds since beginning of high school without getting taller 😂.
All of them are ture. But maybe the dancing, I mean the dancing might just be her.
Literally just stayed up to 4am looking up 3000 calorie meal plans to try to gain more weight and I see this video on my feed lmfao. I hate being this skinny, especially in the winter. So damn cold.
Being skinny doesn't effect your dancing, your just white 🙃
😱 u just solved ALL of my problems
Don't poke holes kn your belt. Just untie the belt from the buckle. Then cut from that end and are attach
So that’s why I’m never cold because I have lots of body fat. This is accurate I am pretty damn fat
I’ve got skinny problems too and I took 10 years of dance classes and still can’t dance 💃 👩‍🦽
THOSE DANCE MOVES!!!!!!
My sister is skinny i am to but not that much but i have those problems
This was so helpful to me because now i feel like im not alone being really skinny...I have been skinny shamed my whole life
Yeees this is so true brooo!!!
Jayus, sweetie, I don’t think it’s the fact that your skinny is why you can’t dance
I'm not trying too be rude but the way she was dancing has making me crying laughing 🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂
Okay but honestly I think that those dance moves are fire. Or maybe there just better than mine
"I can't dance" pulls out the smoothest moves I've seen
God I feel all of this. it's even worse when people say "oh I wish I had your problem" 🙄  I have an ED (not image related) so it's just really frustrating when you're underweight and everyone acts like it's fine and you have nothing to complain/worry about.  sorry, I just get so fed up with people saying they want others disorders.
I eat so much and I’m so skinny 😭
I am 15 and i have the same problem :( 50 kg
Image her dancing at someone's anniversary
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
like this if jayus can dance better than you
Omg same
Same
Me, who's overweight: interesting
Lol skinny lives matter
Thank you for dropping out of the NBA to teach us facts
Sick dance moves tho…
Another one is you can't dance like me cause your white 😂
The dance part is not because your skinny most people can’t dance
I'm attracted to you your awesome
That’s how I dance and fat af
You skinny cause you do not eat enough to break maintenance weight n add it, you have to force feed yourself past fullness n eat more times per day stretching the stomach then you will gain weight n increase appetite.
Nahhhh you got moves 🤣🤣
Enjoyed your video!
I was the skinniest person in my class and the best dancer at the same time so..... Yeah
They jelouse
This was quality.
No offense  but  get  better dance moves
I was so skinny but since the pandemic started i gained weight and now im fit
I am 20 y/o, male and weigh between 55 and 60 kg depending on which scale I believe. I was a fat baby that lost weight to sickness and never regained it. I have advanced metabolism so i use energy to point that it starts using muscle mass for energy due to a lack of fat. I am healthy, happy and living a fantastic life but can't gain weight no matter how much I eat. I have had all these and everyone tells me they wish they were skinny. Don't.
bruh
I have these same exact problems and it sucks. (Including the dancing thing)
I've done the new holes in belt 🤣
Doesnt she remind you of Ellie from tlou2?
You look like a boy
Yo skinny gang where u at?
My grandma make me eat more cuz she thinks I have a bad alimentation but I'm only skinny grandma!
You should of ended with "oh and I'm also pretty as fuck" ........ Ya.
Idk how but I get bullied for how skinny I am yet I thrive in the cold
I am skinny and people thought it was bc of my picky eating and they would scare me so much by saying "your gonna have to get tubes up ur nose and they will force feed u"
People assuming that skinny people doesn't eat that much is bullsh*t.. I am a big dude and most my skinny friends eat twice or thrice than what I eat.. I'd be like chill bro
I'm not thin and laying too long on my belly also bruises on my ribs.  This is normal I think. Thin or not 😅
those problems are my goals lmao
Jayus: I can't dance  Me: it can't be that bad looking omg it is that bad
Why dose that like my mom dancing 💃
"That shit's fucked up to say to a kid"  No joke! Would get this constantly. I grew up very tall and very skinny, buying clothes was a nightmare. Still kind of is, but I've started working out to try and actually fit into my clothes. So far so good 👍
this is all true btw. and I would know.
Is this a woman or a man? Jesus.
No one can dance, it’s a ploy made by the government
Me: skinny That one kid in my class: a literal twig
The dancing is on you tho           It’s a joke guys
Yah my grandmas both always keep feeding be so much because I'm so skinny
It is worse to be the chubby one
I can't tell you how many times someone called me a twig, like- bruh
Thank you for letting me know I'm actually not that skinny, i don't get bruises
I think dancing is a you problem 😂
I don't think the dancing is because of your skin nis
Yes yes ture
This is so relatable as a child (I'm a child still) I always get bullied and shit but I friended the cool kids now I'm cool😔
I can dance like jazz and contemporary but not like party dance or I look like and idiot
So true
Yes you can dance  you just make it more fun
Come to Europe, where you’d have a pretty normal body type! The ass hurt is so real though
The society one... as a guy, I swear it hurts twice as much because when you complain it's bugging you, you get told to suck it up or "man up", and your own fellow man may tell you that you won't find a partner or be good at fighting, or whatever the fuck. Well, that's why Bruce Lee is a personal hero, because he was the same height as me, 130s in weight, and defied all the odds. In a time when body shaming is so prevalent just for a laugh at someone else's expense, people have clearly forgotten about him, or at least don't realize he was just under six feet, didn't have hulking muscles, or all that other macho stuff. Skinny shaming is body shaming too.
I’m a skinny person then
Btw no can dance
Cold all the time Tired all the time Made fun of all the time Can’t sit on anything without cushion Everything hurts 5 times more than you’d think The thing is I could inhale a Big Mac and not gain a single gram
Dude it is fucked up to say that to someone's
Thanks for shedding some light on the issues but I don't think the dance is because you're slim....it's just you loll...like have you seen Lalisa from blackpink???!!!!!
I look like a skeleton when iI dance
Needless to say I'm a worse dancer 😂😂😂
I’m 11 and I’m skinny AF to .everybody used to say I was skinny as a pole. I only weigh 87 pounds and the rest of my friends way at least 100
Omg I’m really skinny and one of my friends always mocked me for being so skinny and I felt awful, this whole video is so true though
I’m fat and when I lay down on my tummy it hurts my god Dam ribs
They can't dance.  Michael Jackson laughing in heaven
Dancing is just moving ur body to the best of the music. It doesn't have to be good.
Relateable
You make the rules in dance. Remember  becose every one follows one path, that doesn't mean that you have to too. Have a nice 2022.
That last one is just a you problem lmao
The real problems...
I hate being skinny
This is so true I’m 75 pounds
How is she 600kg
Where complete subtitles?
Relatable af  😔
Have you ever impaled someone with your tailbone when they hit it from the back
I’m also very fucking skinny…
Umm I think I have a problem I’m skinny asf but I don’t get cold fast… I always knew I was a problem 🥲😂
The way Jayus danced is exactly how i dance when im home alone 💀😂
Your dance is way better then mine I totally lost it 🤣
What does dancing have to do with being skinny? I know plenty of us fatasses who also have no rhythm. Just saying.
All of those things are true...
You can dance better then me lmao
At least you can dance confidentially
Even my weight according to my age is k, it's just my appearance I look skinny and "weak" (PS:Just a thing that happens with ME)
The 5th one is FUCKING TRUE like others are true too but the 5th one is the most accurate, specially when ur an Indian or Asian
My arms are like 7 inches wide
Same
When all of these apply to you but you still feel fat
I'm madison and people are like "Madi go eat some meat or I complained of it's soooo cold, also my size of clothes don't fit. Bye
OMG same
How tall is Jayus ?
HahahahahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
All of that is so true
Same and also relatable plus I always ate a lot as a kid and then they would call me fat weird
Me dancing like that thinking I’m good ( seeing someone else dancing like that)…     I am never dancing again, but all these things are true 😭
When I lay down on my chest for too long it literally starts caving in onto my lungs like it's wave lighter than a pancake could ever be it's flat like paper by now my rib cage is probably just a 2D image
Y'all, I'm not the skinniest and I'm flunking cold all the time, can't dance, have a pain in my ass all the time too :) it's not just skinny People 😄
Fellow skinny person here and I agree with everything she said espiaclly the comments about my size.
You're perfect
I'm am a very skinny person and this video is literally describing me
😍
Same lol but the way you danced was weird tho
All I know is to twerk at my Self in the mirror🤣
I can relate to all of them except being cold. I’m always hot
I also grew up skinny. I can eat and eat and I won’t pack any of the calories. You know how you’re considered a bad person for fat shaming? Well what about the people that skinny shame? If I had a dollar for every time someone said I’m too skinny.
Skill issue
This is accurate and I hate it but I don’t wanna get fat (not trying to be fatphobic or whatever the fuck people get triggered by now)
*YOu hAvE NO iDEa HoW trUE thIS iS*
accurate info 😻😻😻
I wish I had these problems :( instead I can’t put on socks or shoes without being able to breathe also, I can’t do anything athletic and I put on weight just looking at chicken Nuggets 🥲🥲
This made me feel like I'm not alone anymore.. throughout my life ppl keep telling me to eat or I'll be blown away with just a wind. It hurts and yes all those things Jayus says are true lol.
dont worry, i think ur cute
No ur just bad at dancing
bruh, this is so relatable, especially the sitting one, it sucks a lot
I feel the same
I’ve had the same issues growing up. I didn’t start gaining weight until I started working out and eating a whole lot more. I thought I ate a lot before but nah. If you are happy with what you look like, that’s great, but if you want to change, you need to make conscious choice and make it a habit.     Ps you need to have different level of maturity where you don’t go overboard, and the moment you start lifting you will forever be small.
Facts
the dancing had me dying
I'm fat as hell and I can't dance
Me over here being fat shamed at school because I overweight by a bit:(
Omg I am skinny too and I can 100% confirm that all of this is true. I have luckily found some pants that fit me but i have to get tiny ass pants, and it gets SO GOD DAMN COLD.
Is that 68lb or 68kg?
On a weight gain journey and so far i gained 20 pounds in about 3 months. I was 120 pounds.
Relatable
Cheat code, eat peanut butter and (Dave's killer) bread before you go to sleep.  Or just have some higher calorie stuff in your diet like some more olive oil or a mass gainer
Yeah ik so skinny and people make fun of me and tell me to eat it makes me sad
rather be skinny than fat any day. Also i helps not to give a fuck what people say
IM super skinny and I can’t dance
We can’t all dance
So relatable
No.
I feel you
Finally SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS
I am a tween right now and someone told me to eat some meat and I was like "BrO, sCrEw YoU"🤦
That's mee
I have come to another problem So I bought some trousers a few sizes too big bc my age size but the legs are decent the waist was like 4 inches to big
Being called a "skinny bitch" randomly by just about every woman in your life that cannot loose weight 🙄 like bitch how we both look is not my fault and your body shaming to try make yourself feel better. I don't have to be insecure just because you are.
I think beeing skinny is beautiful
Use a grip 6 belt no holes required
I’ve never related so much
That’s literally me
Ngl those moves were fire
im skinny and if its a lil cold i wont wear a jacket when is like very cold is cold and i dont want to wake up in the morning bc its cold and its barely cold at the afternoon
She dances better than me
Yep that’s me 😊30+ years…..2 kids later ……still 114 lbs (52kg)
Cringe fest
Skinny squad
IM SKINNY TOO I CAN RELATE YOUUU
SO TRUE
The most annoying thing is that people don't fucking understand that you can't help it. They get mad cause they're jealous that you can eat but they don't understand that you don't want that ether.
Sooo true........I weight 34 kg at age 15
I'm as skinny as u can I can dance pretty damn well 👉👉  Also I like the fit, 10/10
Best dancer on 'Sausage time'
Is it bad that I relate to this and just about everything else you post
You are dancing
Bro I’m overweight af, can’t dance, and get hella cold. 💀
I’m extremely skinny because of a rare disorder and people always ask how I stay so thin.  To avoid telling people my business I just say “I’m just naturally skinny”.  One time, a woman looked at me like she looked me up and down seemed like she wanted to kill me because I had the audacity to be skinny. Women actually get mad at me! And I know exactly what you mean about pain from sitting, being cold, and not being able to dance.
Im skinnyish but i have a dumpy so i dont have problem sitting anywhere, and im pretty cold resistant
literally me
I was always skinny as well didn't matter if I ate a whole xl pizza in 1 sitting but ppl always said do you even eat
For me this is fairly relatable, I am skinny.  and i think you have good dance moves
You CAN dance.  Haha.
You can't dance because your white
You can't dance because you're white
So true so true....
DON'T FATTEN UP WHILE BEING SKINNY. You'll only get skinny fat which is even worse. Try to put some muscle on, it looks good on EVERYONE
How dare you lie your an amazing dancer
Best dance moves 🤣😆😆🤣😂
That dance is the same dance every student does after barely passing
We all can not dance
I feel Your pain
Same
I’m 9 and I weigh the same exact pounds as you
the belt one got me laughing
IS IT TRUE YOU ARE RACIST? IM HITTING UP MULTIPLE TIMES CAUSE YOUR NUEROLOGICAL DISORDER THAT MAKES YOU FORGET THINGS I'M JUST ASKING A QUESTION
You don’t have to be fat you just need to lift some weights to get some meat under your bones 😳
Ive been on both side the worst part about being skinny is getting cold way to fast.Then being fat was just walking and going up stars
Other people: Eats a whole table of food and never gets fat  Me:   *breathes and gets fat*
oh i definitely know about that putting your own holes in belts
Your perfect
I relate to this to mutch
Me who is constantly underweight for years: Ah understandable, have a great day
Lovin those moves
As a skinny and short person           She's right :,)
Im pretty sure your dancing problem doesn't come from being skinny. That just comes from a lack of practice
As a very skinny person I can say that I also have horrible dancing skills
😅😅😅😅
Gurl i am normal size and still can't dance
I feel you I weighed 60.0 pounds FOR TEN FUCKING YEARS
uhhh- my little sister is 8 and she is 43.5 kg-
The dance is veru funny
I lived this my whole mf life
Have a baby  least you got that  I'm 41 6'4 the most  I have weighed is 190      I get the cold part tho  Nice video but I'd rather be skinny than fat
As someone who is skinny. I can dance. I don't see how being skinny makes dancing hard. Everything else checks out.
Do you have do you have bad rhythm
Those dance moves were dope af
Same i was skinny since i was a baby i was a elf i was SOOOO SKINNY
I fell you
🤣🤣🤣
I can’t dance   Busts a sick move
you're really tall
i was the same weight for 3-5 years. i was 90-97.5 pounds and in a growth spurt still waiting to gain at least 6 pounds. i am finally 100 pounds
"You can't dance" Meanwhile Lisa from Blackpink :
So. RELATABLE!!???!?! BEING SKINNY SUCKS, AMD THEN EVERYONE SAYS "You sure you eat?" I eat more then they can. "Your lucky your so skinny! I wish I could be as skinny as you.." You WOULDN'T want to be this skinny. "Why aren't you sitting?" IT HURTS
I'm literally the opposite of this but I always find it funny how skinny people don't want to be skinny and curvy people don't want to be curvy. We'll never be happy.
Oh my god, skinny people can gain weight, but it's so fucking difficult for fat people to lose weight. Skinny girls can wear a lot of stuff and look gorgeous, not fat girls.
As a skinny person I can corroborate
When I was little I was so skinny my grandfather called me snake hips
Skinny people and fat people having to poke holes into belts: 🤝
i was skinny growing up too, so whenever people say, "your getting fat" i take it as a compliment haha
Sitting down sucks lol
I feel like the last one is not just for skinny people … xD
Those dance moves are actually good
This is 100000% TRUEEEEEE
Am also super skinny
Ok everything is true but I don’t get the skinny comment I get why you so short
Same lol I am 70 pounds at 25 lol
Ok yeah I agree I'm literally 13 and I weigh 85 FREAKING POUNDS and I get comments saying I should eat more and stuff from my family all the time!
Did I see that right? She weighs 66 pounds?
I realize how lucky I am being a slightly overweight person. Walking barefoot never hurts, I don’t get cold fast but I still get  cold.
Yea can't relate
I am the skinny kid in my school and br I relate to all
I want to be skinny
Nice try blaming the dancing on your bmi lol. That is just lack of rhythm plenty of skinny ass people can dance
So true though
I eat more then anyone I know and I'm skinny asf🤣biggest flex ever
I like you
Can't dance is more of a you problem
i am a cold lover/i dont like summer
Im skinny too
Dude ppl are more afraid of being fat than skinning but being skinning is f*cking miserable  I always wear 3 F*CKING LAYERS OF A JACKET FOR THE TO ATLEAST FOR FREEZE AT WINTER dont get me started on the seats and food literally is the worst once you get skinning it will take months to get a "your safe" size
Damn this is so relatable, my ass hurts so much from sitting on a soft chair gah
I have problems like that too and I’m skinnier
I don't think the dancing issue is a skinny people thing.
"I can't dance"     *Literally being spongebob dancing*
😪🤤😯😲🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😊🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣
My waist is so small I get boys belts or stretchy belts to fit
As a skinny human. This is really relatable, especially the Society one like istg If I got a dollar every time someone told me to go eat a burger or something, I would be rich right now ;-;
-Limbs go numb faster both in awkward AND comfortable positions too. -muscle growth is cut in half due to your body going like "im gonna burn all the shit you ate, no calories for you" -Pointy shoulders
My sister is skinny and i feel so bad for her. I comment on it as a joke when she says I eat to much but whatever thats fine, and she tells me to stop if I cross a line.  But what my family says to her is messed up.   “When I blow on your hand it moves”  “You look like a stick”  “You’re just skin and bones”  Looking back I feel bad that I say this sometimes when I know she can’t help it. And I never knew about the cold thing and that’s probably why she wears full winter jackets in early fall.   Anyway I’m gonna cry and give my sister a huge hug when she wakes up, have a good night.
you sound like your parents left and you can cuss while there gone
People should just stop being mean about things they can't change
My doctor was concerned for me lol
FR!!!! Smh 120lb male at 6ft 2 freaking blows yet i can out eat over half the flippers in my social circle
I’m not fat
You’re skinnier than me and I’m nine years old and weighs 70 pounds
These are true
Just eat a couple of steaks during the winter to keep yourself warm.😉😉
Different person here the actual Josh haggerty made this account for me because mine got deleted but I'm fat and yet I still can't dance and when I said it hurts more than ever and I get cold
That’s how I dance
Not gonna lie it’s probably not weight that changes dance
I was a chubby kid now I'm a petite adult and I hate it. I got on the bus and the driver charged me for a child's ticket, I'm 24. I shop in the kids section, adult clothes don't fit me, people like my ILs are mean to me about my weight, telling me I'm too skinny. When in fact I eat whatever I like, I've had two kids, and I barely work out due to having zero time... It's not my fault I'm skinny!! 😂
Im skinny too... i have same problems as u... i get u😂
i heve the same  problem :(
I have all of these problems especially people just being rude
I’m a teen that weighs 75 pounds and I cannot gain weight if MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. I used to joke about it but now it’s gotten to the point where my confidence is rapidly decreasing, and as a guy, you’re expected to look a certain way, idk if it’s worse for women, but it sucks. I’m glad you made a video about it, it makes me feel like someone actually relates to me. God bless.
relatable
The video: skinny people problems blah blah Me: yas b*tch thx Me also thinking that I can ralete to literally every single one
I can sorta dance. Everything else here I can 100% relate to
Being skinny, almost all of this is true. Except as a dude, lying on my belly doesn’t just hurt my ribs, but also my crotch area.
The cold part is so true. Like, everyone around me is just like wtf??? But its so painful to be always cold lol
You can't mistake me for a pencil i'm a fucking stickbug that's how skinny i am
TRUEE
The first thing happens to me on a chair without cushioning although I am overweight.
Maybe I am skinny
Dude you can dance
Same, I need a cushion to sit down
Come to Wisconsin you'll probably gain 10 pounds just by breathing our air, we're beer battered and snothered in cheese.
I can confirm most of this especially people constantly commenting on you needing to eat more
Me who isn’t skinny but still relates to this: 🤡
I was born a chubby kid and I was also told omg ur so chubby I couldn't fit into dresses my eating habits were unhealthy then one day I was ok let's do this lost weight and now people are like are u dieting? Starving yourself? I feel like ur arms are gonna break no matter if ur fat or skinny people always have a way to body shame you 🙂
I've literally been eating diabetes for over a year and I'm still skinny AF (as frick)
I weigt 29.5 kilo grams and im 13... Is there somthing that helps on skinnynes?
I understand this, I’m 6’1” and 135 pounds, I’m skinny af
OMG, so true. I often wear jeans and sweatshirts during summer. The part about sitting. I hated the plastic chairs at school. I would constantly have to adjust myself to try and get comfortable. Also, I too cannot dance but that is just a lack of talent
That last night be just you but still the rest are true
I feel the pain
Facts I know the feeling
is that you in the last picture??
not saying any of these aren't problems, or that she doesn't have the right to complain about them, but it's also pretty nice to be largely catered to and favored by western society for your body type too
Jayus: *"WAAAAAH I'm so skinny"*  Quadriplegics with no limbs:
Define 'cant' dance? You dance just like me...wait... Is this not sexy?? 😱😱
I thought she said she can’t dance
True
I have all of these problems I never had ANY meat on my bones so I’m trying to build arm muscles to get at least something for my arms but EVEN THAT is a problem because there is NOTHING to build on
I've been 120 pounds since my freshman year at 14 years old... I'm going on 38 and weigh about 122...
Nah jayus lokey hot tho. I mean sheesshh
I am very skinny and these problems are exactly what I go through everyday :')
You dance awsome!😁
Ngl that dancing was better than mine I just twerk and get paid
The worst one is being cold because every time i go out during the summer i would always dress up like im in the middle of a blizzard😭
Well I think I your just plain awesome
me, not a skinny boi: ok
I just go to the waterpark yesterday AND CANT RIDE THE ICE CREAM RIDE LIKE THE CONE SHAPE CAUSE  MY WEIGHT DIDNT REACH MORE THAN 35 KG REEEEEEEEE
Sis those moves is killa
I have all these problems too 😂🥲
RELAAAAAAAATE
She's spot on the money that was me now im chubby and life is great
I'm anorexic
Don't blame your lack of rhythm on being skinny. I was skinny my whole life and can dance.
Solution?
Me being overweight and chubby asf: can't relate😀
So it's not just me? Yayy! But also not yay... Not sure i should be happy about that-
What you mean bro society looks at me and says "go lose weight fuckin stay puff marshmallow man"
Bruh that was literally the best dancing I’ve ever seen 😩🖐
5 was beyond believable. People still say that to me still. So I wear anything to hide that I’m just a twig so no one says anything.
I REPECT u doing something like this much love.
GURL I UNDERSTAND THIS SO MUCH
My mom is living every girls dream!!   She has a condition where she can't really gain weight as much as others, meanwhile as she does not get full easily.   IN OTHER WORDS MY MOM CAN EAT A WHOLE 20 PIECE MCNUGGET, A LARGE DR. PEPPER, AND 4 BIG MACS, 𝙎𝙏𝙄𝙇𝙇 𝙉𝙊𝙏 𝙁𝙐𝙇𝙇 𝘽𝙐𝙏 𝙉𝙊𝙏 𝙁𝘼𝙏 𝙀𝙄𝙏𝙃𝙀𝙍
This is very accurate, the only thing that I personally experience that wasn't mentioned, is not being able to eat most of the time.
Relatable
I’m not skinny by any means but I have no butt so I understand the first one
When people talk to me: The wind will take you away you skinny a*s... 😒
🤔Skinny women are all coochie..😋👍.. yw.
I don’t think I’m “Skinny” but O am one of the smallest out of the people in my friend group and it gets annoying being the smallest in teams I’m not really short either but one of the shortest so yeah, but I honestly think it’s just genetics 🧬 or idk.
So since you have no insulation does that mean your boyfriend is a fat guy so that you could spoon with something warm? Also I don't think you being skinny doesn't have anything to do with your ability to dance, I think it could be you're just that white LOL
I be seeing black guys that look like sticks and know how to dance
I think the dance thing is a you problem
The dancing was hot!
I can gain weight but I don’t visually change or look any larger.  Skinny is painful.
Got a big crush so had to memorize them picture s
Ok. Now make the pros of being skinny, like me as a heavy guy, no way I'm crouching on the counter for a tik tok, I'll break or the counter will, or both.what other pros of being skinny hmm Oh easier time being fashionable. More agile, easier to change momentum. More people are attracted to skinny than to fat. Yeah I'd say the pros outweigh the cons (figuratively)
It changes when you hit your 40s..You get good curvey.. The being cold doesn't go away though.. And pants still sit on the hip bones...and who lays on their stomach on hard floors?? Also.. Dancing has ZERO to do with being skinny.
This is my sister like loky
This is SO RELATABLE LIKE BITCH SAME HERE
I used to be anorexic and all of this stuff is so true and I didn't realize until I gained weight
being called fat is worst than saying go fucking eat 💀
I eat around 4 full meals a day and yet I'm barely not underweight. My metabolism is fucking crazy
Your good at dancing if I saw u at a club you’ll make me want to bust a move
I'm 41 i still weight 66.6 Kg and have done for 20 years everyone always said you need to eat, I stuff my fat face daily makes no difference amd yeah I get cold easier than others and belts have extra holes and my arsenal bones are numb lol x
There's only one benefit to being skinny. It's a simple as this. You can eat like there's no tomorrow without regret or shame
As a skinny person I actually relate to pretty much everything. The only thing I didn't quite understand what's the dancing. I mean I can't dance for shit either. But I didn't think that was a part of me being skinny
Me as a very skinny person this so true and when u hurt yourself on something it hurts 10x worse
Same, like It’s not even funny
Finally, she's a girl!  You look hot with all this knowledge and short cut. I always wanted a smart girl.
I feel ya man. I feel ya.
I’m very skinny as well and can relate to all of this. I am not saying being fat is better, but being skinny sucks.
I’m super skinny and I eat like a lion
Everything she just said is my sister
I agree with this. Especially the sitting problem.
I was skinny, then I started eating a lot more and working out and now I’m JACKED!    …Or maybe not
Wow
Facts!  I get cold so easily- Also I honestly just gave up wearing a belt to. I get a size XS, it just needs one more hole-
Bro same
Laying in my tummy makes me nauseous
So people fat shame, and skinny shame WTH
Offending people when you sit on there leg "ow your ass bones" ....cheers pal
Her dancing is scientifically better than 93% of all white people
All of these describe me
Always knew I couldn't dance because I was skinny 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
press X to "Same"
I was skiny for 19 years was in shape for 5 and out of shape for 14
Im also skinny and this is relatable
Thanks for dancing,I feel beta
This is me as a guy. 29 waist 128 pounds. Can eat Italian dinners every night and still lose weight
You are bodyshaming. I am oppressed.
I have no idea what you mean when you say you can’t dance, according to what I just saw you can entirely throw ass ssooo lol
My youngest daughter is 7, she's nearly 4' tall but only weights 54 pounds. She's perfectly healthy, she's just built tiny. Her pants either fit in the waste or legs, never both. I have to him everything!! She gets comments often, people telling her she's going to blow away in the wind & people telling us to feed her. I can tell you that that kid eats, a lot!!
I don't think it's your skinnyness that makes you bad at dancing.
I'm one of those people who you at first say, you need to eat so we can fatten you up boy..... and then they see me eat
*me who hates burgers*
You're very flimsy and wiggly
Jayus: Can’t dance. Kpop idols: Hold up-
I relate So hard
Lockdown helped me really well gain me weight because bephore that I was so skinny like my ribs were seeable also the sitting part is true at school my ass hurted so much on the bechrs
I have the same problem :)
MY UNCLES DANCE LIKE THAT LMAO
I honestly can't tell if this person is a biological male or female. My brain says female, but idk.
"I CAN'T DANCE" Me: I can't keep my eye normal since both if them are lazy eyes but that's better than me dancing
Hehe nword lady funny
Michal Joy? :o
Jay: can’t dance  Me: doubt
Can relate to it all good job getting into a good weight maybe I could do that someday I'm still under 100 pounds
I'm skinny too, but I eat more than any of my friends. I eat so much and I don't gain weight. Also laying down on your stomach as a skinny person hurts so bad I can't breathe while doing it.
I just hate it when people comment about how I look like a fucking noodle
This Is painfully relatable
Ayo, I’m hella skinny too
I hated to be skinny.
I hate the "we need to get you a burger" comments. If I was to say shit like "gosh you need to stop eating burgers." Everyone would be all over my case. Because that's rude. But it's the exact same shit bro.
Their are thin people problems and their are big people problems, somewhere in between is a healthy middle with little to no problems
I love those shoes!
Jayus: I can't dance! Me: nice dance moves, better than mine cause I can't even dance like at all
Why are these the same exact problems i have like i get called a stick to many times than i can count like dang it is not my fault what do you want me to do
You cant tell if someone has been skinny their whole lives by just looking at them, and being skinny has nothing to do with not being able to dance, that's just a you thing.
This is one of the first videos I can actually relate to cause every single one I could remember happening
Me watching this as a freaking skeleton: true
I disagree with the last one bc those are some suck fucking moves man.
Very true my friend.. all of it lol
Skinny people: I hate being skinny😭 Me: WHY CANT I BE SKINNY😭
Me: I've already been broken in half in the summer even tho I eat a lot of food and everyone is now saying I'm skinnier than water    Also me:eats as many burgers to become fatter
6'3" Only way I can gain weight is working out 154 in highschool. Another friend of mine same height and weighed 130 in high school it took him preparing for an ironman to gain any weight 🤣 FYI we would eat crave cases, whole pizzas, and everything else 🤣
When You started dancing I literally died😂😂😂😂
Cute
Must be nice 👌 😒
Literally the same problems to fat people 🙃 😅
Still cute.
Can 100% relate, I’m cold in bed right now too lol
ive always been underweight and skinny my whole life, and when I tell you-  the comments people told took such a toll on my mental health, that I would starve myself as if that would help. idk my mind wasnt doing so hot.   now I'm only thirty pounds under my height's healthy weight...  instead of 50.
Vaccinated people are weird
I still think being obese is worse but seeing this has shone me that being obese and being skinny are closer in pain than I thought
This is facts I’m only 68 pounds and bro I’m get so many of these comments are facts
Think she got a lil carried away at the end their
As a skinmy person i will second this
I freaking love this girl, the dancing had me rolling 🤣😂
I'll take the skinny problems over the fat problem any day, in my 20's I ate horribly, but never really gained weight, I thought I'd be like that always, but then I got pregnant, after I had my son I stayed fairly skinny for like 5yrs, now I cant even look at food without gaining 10 lbs, I'd go back to those days in a instant if I could
I like your dance moves
Are you a
Yeah, I was like that until mid 30's. Now my ass is hot af all the time, even in winter. Enjoy while you can.
I love you so much. I’m fat tho and it hurts my buttbones to hold the weight. And laying down like that reallllllllyy hurts cause all the fat crushing you
It's alright, it took my dad till his early 20's till he wasn't skinny. My brother's 10 and just as skinny as when my dad was when he was that age
I have a similar problem my waist is 22 inches all the way around but my boobs and ass are over twice the size ( I where a 32DDD bra) so nothing fits and before I matured I was made fun of for being to small. I’m 15 and have to where a size 5-6 kids belt
At least I didn't say the n word
Finally somebody said it
none of us can dance. Prove me wrong.
I used to have the same problem start drinking 6 to 10 beers a night  n sleep all day
Idc how skinny you are id marry you anyway just for your personality
I so agree
Im skinty and can dance
I get bodyshamed for being skinny and flat a lot and I don't find it cool but I just ignore it. Usually, I deal with all these problems and I hate how nobody could see it.
You my ask your doctor.. overactive thyroid causes that.. lol and bruises are signs of other problems
I’m 12 years old and I weigh around 95 lbs but my friend is like 85 - 90 lbs
Me losing weight (1.5 lbs) and it hurts to f**king walk:
Me watching this as a skinny kid *like* “💀 true💀”
1 and 3 are soo true
When I was like 8-12 My family always told me I need to eat cheeseburgers
I’m skinny, but, I have a gut as well    It’s weird
Idk how, but im that slim that i dont even feel the fucking cold- Fr im never cold, if anything i like the winter & autumn
I feel you! Thank you, I am glad to know that I am not the only one that feels this way!
I've been skinny my whole life:  1. Is that why i always sot on my knees?  2. Yes 3.i don't get cold normally
I understandstand I weighed 62 for ages just got to 71 recently
Yo that  dancing tho  amazing 😀
Wow spot on. My ass hurt sitting down too long, get cold real quick and  always being told to eat. Skinny shame is real and insulting at times. I wouldn't have it any other way🙂
Same
I am a fat man and can't Dane either.
I hate that I can’t gain weight, I get judged for being skinny and not eating enough, I eat every trucking second of my life
Bruh thank god I'm not the only one who experiences every single one of those bitch ass nuisances 💀😭🤣
Do you think people who aren't underweight can dance as well?  That's not really a skinny problem
I'm obese and even I know not to tell a skinny person to just eat more. Chances are the person eats well but has a very fast metabolism. I wish I had a fast metabolism. I don't eat much yet I gain weight so dang easily..
So, you used a terribly uncomfortable chair to sit on, most people will get uncomfortable especially at heavier weights than you, laying on your ribs isn't normal, they weren't meant to be rested on, 'healthy weighted people's also get uncomfortable laying on their ribs, and whoa, your belt that's 16" doesn't fit, well try having a 54" belt. All of these can literally be fixed by wearing thicker or just more clothing oh fucking No! Belt issues literally hit everyone different sizes, try being 6'4" and trying to live in this society, trying to find SUVs or Trucks almost impossible, cars get the fuck out. Tired of hearing how hard it is to be average or shorter height, and 'healthy'  weight or skinny which let's be honest, unless you're skin and bones, when any joint shows through or you can see the whole spine then yeah you have an issue, but in between no fucking place to complain.
I’m not even close to a healthy weight, I’m 5’3 and a teenager, average weight for my age/height is about 120 pounds and I’m 99.1 pounds-
The dance is better then my ex girlfriends apple pie
Amen 😑
Im not skinny at all and I have these problems.
I'm skinny and ALL OF THAT ID TRUE 😭✋
You're beautiful
My older cousin who is a year older than me is skinny skinnier than me everyday she gets called out I feel bad
Girl I feel you; we skinny people must stick together!
Hey I'm opposit I can't loose weight, maybe you lay on me so you don't bruise
.... if you've been skinny all your life & you eat like a normal person that means your health. Like, amazingly healthy. Why the hell are you trying to gain weight and destroy your health just for american standards. When in korea women there are extremely healthy & are thin naturally like you. I can't understand, maybe i wasn't suppose to but that's so fat normalization bs that you gotta fit to that weight when you healthy. That's probably why you have a smart mind because your health.
Just do the sprinkler my G. Asserts your alpha dominance.
Bro I'm literally 13 and only just hit 80 pounds so I'm the same way and I can't stand for too long or else my whole body will start to itch but it might be my xama (idk how to spell it lol)
The dance thing is a tall person thing like WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME
Jayus : I can't dance  *dances better than I could in a hundred years*
I hate to break it to you but being skinny in fact does NOT affect your dancing skills.
Tbh I don't understand why people are so bent on saying that it's worse one way or the other (I'm not saying that shes saying that, I just mean people in general). It sucks both ways (overweight or underweight)
Everybody has there own way of dancing
That sucks because I'm can tear it up on the dance floor and I have dainty little arms and frame
Oh did you ever get... are you hungry..no not really... oh that's cuz you smelled the food huh?  Or you can't play hide and seek with us... why not... because it's not fair you can hide in the cracks. Nickname used to be skinny bone Jones.
I'm so FAT I wish I was skinny
This is my life I swear I am like this all the time it sucks some times
Imagine being a dude and going through this😐
"That's fucked up to say"?   Christ, the world is going to Hell, I tell you.
Omg she is right
Better than me
Its okay nobody can dance good :)
I dunno I'm fat asf and that fat doesn't help at all when it's cold
You can’t dance.
Same for the first one also if my pelvis gets hit on my butt side it hurts really bad it feels like I got stabbed and it cuts off the circulation in that leg and everyone says I’m faking it.  -Edit: it happens all the time and I have to skip/hop/run for 5 minutes for it to go away but then I can’t run for a few hours because the pain comes back
Nobody can dance
The dance part had me rolling, I'm 6'4, and 160 pounds. I ca relate homie.
I've been fat as phuc my whole life Im Just exaggerating because you are! you look great btw.
I wish in would bei skinny
The majority of my mom's side of the family is overweight and I am not (probably due to my Asian side) and my mom and sister cup my waist and tell me how skinny I am. It feels really weird whenever they do that
Lol I thought they were 600 kg for a second. It was either that or 60 lbs. 😹
u can poke holes, i gotta buy a bigger one
Better dancer then me tbh!
I can relate 👁💧👄💧👁
Since March 2021 I lost 140+ pounds.. I used to always be hot. Now I am always Fucking cold!! For the first time in my life I’m dreading winter.
Pfff ur nothing compared to the other boys in my class dam i can make my thumb ans pinky touch holding their rists
I can't abide by 6, I can groove with the best of em and those are some fresh moves
Ok but at least nobody fat shamed you
My brother is the same literally my whole life he was a walking stick (he's fine with the family calling him that dw) but before lockdown, he started training and started getting muscle but his area went back into lock down and had to stop
*when you eat a lot but you never gain weight*
Omggg I FEEEEEL IT SOOO MUUUCH
Same omg i'm 13 and i'm 80 pounds 😭
For me it's been the exact opposite and no matter what I do I can barely lose weight how ever I did find out if I wanted to I could lose 4 pounds a day how ever it includes my meals but I am slowly making progress to stay an exact weight I'd be happy with how ever I can't complain as much because thanks to my weight I'm stronger than average and more durable on the pain tolerance sadly can't run fast for long tho
Nah I think the dance is all you💀
I cant dance Proceeds to bust a move
5th one is definitely the worst as a skinny person. Like it’s not my fault that my body takes in the equivalent of 5 steaks of calories as if it were a cupcake
Nah, her dance moves be better than mine xD
She didn’t used to curse.... it’s so annoying that she does now...
Same here
Literally all of those things. My whole life...
someone finally said that being skinny sucks cause that's my whole life and no-one understands they say you are so lucky you don't gain weight now matter what 😑
Wey nur, are you geet tal
I understand...😕
I feel u
I totally understand your troubles but to be fair you do not know how to dance 🤣😂❤
First or second day at my new job the manager comes up to me and goes "you know I usually think it's really rude to comment on someone's body for any reason, but.." I'm like BUT???
I never realized thats y some people get cold so easily too.
I am really not going to judge your dance moves😆😆
Im not skinny but I was fat and I lost some weight but I’m lazy so I haven’t bought new clothes so I can relate to the belt thing
YOU FAIL AT SKINNY LIFE!!! or at least dancing. All the best dances are skinny people dances. Yall look lanky and cool. Just do a lot of Hip hop dances and you'll see what i mean...(im fat btw)
you dance sooo gooood!!!
Big relate
5 is the reason I wear hoodies. So anyway now I steal my boyfriend's hoodies.
Nahhh that dancing factor is on you shawty, everything else is genetic and difficult to alter. But those problems you face are on point.
I can relate being super skinny isnt as fun as people think, ive seen worse dancers though
broski!!! I eat pretty much everything and I am still skinny as hell so yea i get u
Are they non binary?
At the end it looks like the demon you see when the acid kicks in
Struggle real girl..ass bones that did it for me.. and I'll say it even though it's shameful...I have a legit belt. Notching tool🤣
I'm over weight
Been called “Stick” more times than I can count, but this stopped for the most part when I was seen finishing two McDonalds  double quarter pounders in one sitting.
The hug of my skin on my ribs has been a constant comfort in my life. When I started gaining more of a natural weight I said that and noon understood what I meant.
I’m a twig to and I can’t dance either 😅
Yes I was there all my life. I'm 36 now and I'm now at 107 pounds. My weight would always fluctuate in the 80s and 90s.
I like salad and some kid looked at me and said ''WHY ARE YOU EATING SALAD YOUR SO SKINNY YOU SHOULD EAT CHICKEN'' and she said it like it would make me offended
See that can’t dance bit? Yeah, I don’t wanna claim that for all skinny people.
"I cant dance!!" Eh... I think that's just a white person problem... I have the same issue...
I disagree with the dancing comment
Same, I'm 10 kilos underweight ✌️
Would def rather these problems rather than a overweight person’s problems ngl
I had comments "you shoudl eat more so you grow some mass and then muscles, from my classmates, until on my birthday, we went to a pizza place and i ate 2,5 32cm pizza in front of him, while he ate half (i ate the other half) and i never got the same comments again
fat perks our waists are huge and certain parts are built wierd we don’t look fat because the clothes end up baggy i can sit down as long as i want
This is all accurate apart from the cold part, everyone at school asks me everyday why I never wear a jumper or coat
This is too true. Especially with the cold bit. I'm from southeast Texas, and we don't know cold.
Eating disorder problems
Skiny asfk beautiful asfk
Jayus: Skinny people can't dance           Michael Jackson: Am I a joke to you!?
In this whole video I was like " me too!"😂😂😂
I always told my brother that he would fly away if he was to light Lmao
I'm not the skinniest person but I relate to all of them except the dancing because I can dance
Relatable.
I’m overweight but skinny, I eat a lot but skinny and because of that I everyone used to make fun of me but I just learned to brush it off
What do you mean cant dance? That looks perfectly fine to me!
Relatable. Very Relatable
I completely understand what you’re talking about that I’ve been skinny my whole life as well I understand every bit of what you’re saying
True story, was locked up in jail once reading a book in the middle of the pod and some dude walked up to me and said, "Man, you're so skinny I almost didn't see you! How do you not blow away in the wind?"   I replied, "I don't know. How does the reflection off your bald head not blind you when you're outside?" And his smile turned to anger real quick. I can't remember what he said back but he was angry and I just laughed and asked him,    "What? You love to dish shit out but can't stand it when you get it back?" And he just walked away and never spoke to me again.
For someone who is skinny as f*ck I can relate to all of these points
Then you should tell us how to gain weight 😂f**k
i’ve never related so much to a hecking video omg
I’m 17 6 foot tall and weigh 108 pounds and I share all these problems 🤣
Hehehehehahhahahahahahahahha im in 18 deggre water I am not c9ld u Jay has could never
I feel u i got so cold
Yeppp
That dancing part is more of a white girl thing than a skinny girl thing
I love her but being skinny isn't why you can't dance baby 🤣
"Yup" "Yep"  "Uh huh" "Yea" "Eyup" "Mhm"
I feel bad now since I thought they were a dude till this moment since I don’t follow actively please tell me I’m not the only one
Cringe
YESSSS THANK YOU
holy shit finally someone who gets it
Im not skinny but ur still better at dancing than me
This is relatable to a whole another level. Like whenever I tell anyone that my butt hurts when I sit for too long, they go like whoa are you trying to show of how thin you are ??!! I swear it's very annoying. And the dancing one was just me whenever someone forces me to dance. I'm soo happy too find someone like myself
As a guy who has a thing for skinny girls I don't get these comments. Like AT ALL! wtf is wrong with people??
SAME
Feel ya. I'm 6'2" been about 140-150 for like 10 years
:/ k
I would say that’s not bad dance moves
their attempt to dance was hilarious to watch especially because i dance like that two because im alsso underweight
All I can say is, you dance way better than me.
When i sit my assbones also hurt
So I'm skinny to
The can't dance thing maybe a white thing not a skinny thing 😐
No you can dance that is the best dance in history
I uhm- I- Just- True.
I dance like that
I can relate to the 5th one. Growing up my grandma kept on warning me saying, "One day your gonna fly in the wind like paper." I was 5. I'm still underweight by 10kg I asked some people for tips and they said, "jUsT eAt." I get sick and throw up all the weight I gained if I eat a bigger amount.
I cannot lie down on my stomach. My ribs are always in pain
Hahaha you so crazy🤣
Okay you made me feel a lil better, but you came too late! I was just 50% lifeless tissue just pure fat like a year ago. I lost al that shit only 2% of me is just pure lifeless tissue, and now i am suffering of the same goddamn problems u have >:(
Her: I can’t dance Me: I know how you feel girl 😉
Technically it’s a lot of people I can’t dance but this was kind of funny
The last one sounds like a u prob 👀
My god how tall is she bruh
I’m the same you are so I feel the pain I’m 15 and weigh 95 pounds
I'm skinny too and I have an odd over sensitivity to pain
“eat more”
I don't know why but the dance looked like a satanic ritual
All is true.
Says the one who taught people how to twirk-
Boohoo
I'm fucking skinny and I'm tired of people. I don't know when they are gonna understand...
As somebody who's experienced what it's like to be very underweight and very overweight I can say that society sucks unless you're absolutely perfect looking.
Me, 120 pounds (54.4 kg) of pure noodle wearing sweaters in summer: *oh, okay* Eating more than everyone else I know and somehow maintaining that weight: *o h ,   o k a y*
I have two more. Back bruising from plastic/metal chairs. My backbone would push against those plastic school chairs and leave painful bruises. Constantly fucking hungry. To keep my metabolism going I need constant fuel for the fire. It’s worthier that or all the progress I’ve made gaining any weight at all is nullified.
Skinny people are bullied 🥺
As a skinny person, it's hard to look graceful
I AM THE PERSON IN THE PICTURE AND I'M SCARED
.... Been there and still there
I'm just like you
...😔
DUDE I RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH OH MY GOD
Don’t worry, me too
I know this pain, its just annoying
Goddamn how tall is she
I would wear thicker clothing to look like I weighed more.
Dance pretty well
say that last thing to kpop idols
Better than my moves
Literally the opposite but the same for overweight.
Updated your intake of fatty foods
This is me, I am skinny myself and I have to deal with it everyday, especially the comments.
I have been called noodle arms, twig etc. but I’m secretly strong and when people realize they say it’s wrong.
Jayus : *list a bunch of things about how being skinny sucks*  *relates to all of them* Me : Am I skinny? My brain : the fck, no Me : ... true
I have a great tip for you chain belts very stylish and very customizable
Oh my God beautiful dancing skills oh fuck  I can't even dance like that
I get you. I'm skinny AF and I eat a lot, yet some how I'm fifteen 5 foot and 89 pounds
Skinny or not she's still fine 😍😍
I thought it was just me
Frfr. Got all those problems XD
Number 5 is the worst one like it’s abuse to skinny people like me
I think the dancing is just a white people problem though
I suffer all of these.but one.I AM A RLYYY GOOD DANCER SOME PEOPLE SAY.so idk if u can blame dancing on being skinny
i mean i'm not skinny and i ant dance lmao
That last one is just cause your white
atleast less skinnier thhan me
During sit ups I can't stand the way my spine rolls across the floor it hurts so bad
I am nine and I weigh 68 pounds
I'm skinny but when i seat i don't hurt but when i seat on my friend well they suffer because they fell my Bone even they are bigger and taller than me. like what?  And i win in a fight whit my friend ones ,.  👁️👄👁️ huh?
I have experienced this all my lifee. It really hurts, you know.I still cant sit down for long..my body hurts😞.I cant do anything about it.I eat as much as the others do, maybe even more.I still cant change it.Please stop teasing me because of that 😢😢
As someone who weighs 42 kg I relate to this. I'm a fucking stick 😃✌️
I feel ya. I'm 6'1" and 118 pounds. I'm 37 and have been that size since I was 14. The quote I hated most growing up was, "do you have cancer or something?"
Im a dude and can relate to this real hard
So glad I'm overweight
Arcade belt is the perfect belt for a skinny person. I know the deal
That's cause ur 6ft 13
Are you able to fold your thumb into your palm (all the same hand), close your fingers over your thumb & have your thumb protrude past the edge of your hand?
I’m only 14 but I relate so much 😖😖
I am exactly the same
ok i believe that u cant dance 😂😂😂👍
Situps hurt
Ok but jayus honestly you got some moves though
Yes to all of this
I can relate soooo much
Im also fucking skinny
That last one is just you
I used to be skinny befor the pandemic.  Now I'm still skinny on the top half. But the bottom half just doesn't fit It's like I'm using someone else's legs😂
I once got called to my schools office purely for them to ask if I was eating, it was mid (field) hockey season so I weighed a bit less.
I’m skinny and all these things apply to me to
cold just means u got small (diameter) blood vessels
That dancing thing is just you
Can relate. Am 16 years old and 104 pound
As a fellow skinny person I can agree to all of those except dancing.
I miss being skinny, went from 175-185 high school to age 25 and instant 260. Now 38 and yearly its 230-260 better than my 20s 260....also I couldnt dance to save the human race on mdma
At age 12 I weighed 88.8 pounds is that underweight or not?
bruh what do you mean you can't dance
I understand these very well.
I dont get hot but i get cold ez pz
I was so skinny as a kid I no joke almost got washed away by Lake Superior When I was 12
I got all those problems but not the rib bruises or comments but all the others are the worst and some I thought were normal for everyone
What? You're normal, not skinny.
4:20 likes
I was skinny growing up. When I was a 90 lb teen and people were like, "Do you eat?!" I would challenge them to an eating contest. And I would WIN EVERY TIME.
Soo true 😭 I feel ya , when your brother is bigger and they ask does he steal your food , you are gonna fly away in wind 💔 hate those comments
EXACTLY like I had to poke more holes into my brand new belt
Ha! Try telling a Mexican or Italian that telling a skinny child that they’re sick is bad for their mental health. It’s like talking them out of beating their asses with a belt for misbehaving. You’re speaking to a brick wall there.
Praise my skinny brethren!!!!!!! Let our problems be known!!!!
Those dance moves though- 😍👌
a person can be overweight or underweight, but they can't be weight
OML #5 IS SO ANNOYING EVERYONE IS ALWAYS TELLING ME I NEED TO EAT MORE. THEN PEOPLE SEE THAT IM GETTING A LITTLE THICKER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I NEED TO SLOW DOEN ON EATING JUNK-  sorry for the small rant lol
Stopped watching when she was on the sink….
You can dance  !😃
Get ittt
I'm in my early teens, and weigh about 120 lbs, simply because I'm a dense person in general.  To me, seeing your weight on that scale almost scared me ngl.
I never want to poke new holes in my belt since I don't trust myself to do that so I only own 1 belt that fits me- it's the type that has the 2 holes on the entire belt so I can just use it as small as possible >:]   oh! and for the first time ever, a doctor never commented on my weight recently!! That made me so happy since they always say "be careful in the wind, you might fly away" etc
There is nothing worse than the smartass comments about eating some more and stuff...yeah no don't be jealous fatso
Okay 8m a 19 year old male and I weigh 115. I completely understand and agree with everything your saying
The "I can't dance" is not related to being skinny, isn't it, sis ?🤣😆
6 is just you
You may be skinny, but you also cute and funny
You dance a whole lot better than me
Ikr I'm so skinny like literally
Stop dancing STOP
Alright tubby
How do I get this bitch off my feed
Super relatable
For the dancing it's not cause you're skinny it's cause you're white
Bro what's your weight because I'm probably the same weight due to all the tips you just said 🤣
Lol sorry the last one is just you.
Better danceing then me
I’m big and my ass always hurts when I sit and my ribs when I lay down ahahahaha
If I could Measure my metabolism it would be yes. I was under 100 pounds for 13 years. I can see my heart beating through my skin, how you may ask I don’t know! At one point I was drinking 2 of the cokes you can get in a 6 pack of plastic bottles a day and nothing changed.
Yeah people constantly making comments about my weight really messed with my self esteem growing up. I gained weight as I got older so now I pass as "normal" but we need to stop treating smaller kids like that
Why is this so true for me 😭
Personally your number 5 I never worry bout that because I have the most legendary comeback if someone says ewww I see his rib cage. Or anything about how skinnu I am
For people complaining, were talking about people who are underweight. Not average/healthy.
Dancing seems fine to me 😂
This is sooo realistic
I'm not skinny, I'm Vogue😏  Yesterday I ate 30 nuggets, 5 sandwiches, half a gallon of Dr pepper, half a gallon of sirup, a bag of skittles, pack of unicorn cookies, with some chipitos and a quart of chocolate milk.  6'6" @ 150lb 😂😂😂
The dancing part hilarious
What
THIS IS ACCURATE AS FCK when i was in year 7 i weighed like 35kg and my step mum would always make hurtful comments :(
Lemme teach you how to dance!🙄🙄
Omg yes to most of the
I was pretty skinny and i was eating decently but couldn't gain wieght than i started eating 5-6 times a day and started going to gym than I gained like 45 pounds in 8 months.
I have a fix. Eat 10 McDonald’s meals a day till your stomach is the size of Kansas. I don’t have any advice for fat people problems tho.
Dude I wanna be skinny tf 😭
I think the inability to dance stems from white
I remember when I was skinny af as a child. My arms and legs were like twigs. My aunts and uncles always said I should eat more. Now I’m overweight. They all say I should exercise or go on a diet.
Your beautiful
I was skinny untill i ate hamburgers  Go eat hamburgers
I’m extremely underweight, weak and skinny like whatever I eat or do it won’t change and I’m very lazy + my baby brother can literally pull me so I agree with EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING LIKE OH MY GOSH AND MY FAMILY OVER HERE BEING LIKE “Oh We NeEd To FaTtEn YoU uP” LIKE WTF MY BODYS MESSED UP WHY WONT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THE HELL tiegidhfvixdjfgidfvdhdjgfudjdeudkfbodno 🖕🏽🤬
Homie busted a fucking move at the end
The most weight I ever lifted was 1000 pounds    I did a pull up
She is so right  laying down like that and the belt and the can’t dance yea very much true
I've been fairly skinny my whole life and people think I just don't eat I mean sometimes I don't eat until dinner but other than that yeah I eat
Okay I felt this this hit way too close to home
This is so accurate
Yo that was some snazzy dancing 😘
imagine being 13 and 65 pounds.  yea definitely not me. yea
A class dancing
this is my favorite 1
OMG IM SKINNY AND YES IT IS SO ANNOYING
You dance better than me
I mean you gotta eat like crazy to gain weight if you have a fast metabolism
I feel u
Thank god someone said it
Me too
Now for the belt thing belts will always be uncomfortable for me since im too skinny so I buy sweatpants disguised as different pants like jeans and no one has ever found out.
You dance better than me
I've been skinny since 5th grade ever since covid though I gained weight and now I'm 150 pounds which is overweight but it's much better than being as skinny as a noodle that my mother nicknamed me noodle when she gave birth to me
A vast majority of people would you find you more attractive then a chubby person! OH NO!!! ... Anyway
Same
I can relate it is very ignoring and hurts
Yes this is true... and I was born in December
Jayus: *Dancing*          Me: Wtf are you doing?? You havin a stroke or sum??
You're one of the few funny people on this shit Keep it up!
Bro your saying u can’t dance I tried to dance before and I walked into a closet
You not being able to dance has nothing to do with being skinny it’s because your white
Can't believe she lied about not being able to dance
The last part about the dancing  that you cannot dance because you're skinny that's just you not because you are skinny fyi you are beautiful ❤️
You dance better than me
Laughs in fatass
literally my whole life thank you
Yeah society is my problem
You just hit even note of my life. People used to say if I turned sideways, I'd disappear. I look a little better now. My goal is add 20 lbs of  muscle next year. No more being skinny please 🤘
The dancing is a white person problem lol
Im skinny af
It's pretty funny that I relate with everything that you said except the belt complaint and also the fact that I'm going to break in the wind even though everybody just says that I'm going to fly away like a kite
wait so im skinny? LMAO
I personally relate to this its hard to be skinny as hell
With no weight we have no momentum so we cant dance AT ALLL GAHHHHHHJHHHHHH
Another common trait that leads me to think you are the female me..
I can relate  Except the dance one
Not me being in 7 grade and being under 70 pounda
SO FUCKING RELATEABLE
I'm 12 and I'm only 3 stone
So true .. I'm skinny and when I was in 6th grade ppl gave me the nickname of twig and I hated it .. but now I'm homeschooled now but I'm going to go to  high school so .. yay
I'm with you on the dancing cant dance worth shit even if my life depended on it.
As a representative for the fat guys community, i would like to say that your problems are our goals
I feel you I've been learning I have a fast metallism
That's me
I was underweighted but during quarantine I gained weight now my weight is normal but still I am skinny af The worst thing about it is the society  I am skinny but I can dance pretty well
Honestly tho I like jayus even her dancing like her personality is amazing and she is funny
Same bruh...
Society hurts me more than a knife cut
I hate how true all of these are for me Cause my clothes just suddenly didnt fit and now everyones saying im built like stickman
Nice moves
Me my problem is that I’m TALL and skinny, so I always have a hell of a time finding pants that are the right length and don’t fall down. That why I resorted to wearing boys sweatpants, and previously I always had to buy adjustable waist jeans and they would be fairly tightened lol.  Although recently I’ve developed a bad habit of forgetting to eat cuz I get invested in stuff, so I think I’m maybe a pound underweight or something. I’m 5’8” and weigh about 116lbs
I wish I was thin like you
So true I'm 13 years old, 5 foot 3 inches, and 90 pounds. Its partly because my.body type is skinnier, and partly due to a side effect of my ADHD meds that suppresses my appetite. I've been gaining weight recently, tho. I was 86-87 pounds a few months ago
This is all true, fuck
WELCOME TO MY WORLD MAN WELCOME TO. MY F*CKING WORLD
These are all true
At least you can say the n-word you racist bitch
I fucking hate the 'eat a cheeseburger shit', and the 'giiiiirl I'd break you in half' -if we were to be intimate with each other, hate that shit.
How did you gain? I’ve been feeling really bad about myself recently, like i used to dismiss comments before now it triggers me so bad i end up crying for hours
Skinny like that my whole life
Skinnier person here, stop complaining.
+1 … especially on the cold “really fuckin fast” 🤷🏾‍♂️
nah cause anyone else get called a twig or lanky streak of bacon 😭
I think the sitting down thing applies to everybody no? When you sit your extra fat is always gonna ooze aside and your bones will poke through or at least that’s the way it seems
As a 15 year old guy who is 5'10.5 and weighs 124 pounds, I unfortunately relate to this very much
My friends mum came up to me whilst I was in year 5 and asked me if I was anorexic 😀
Skinny? I’m short
Honestly tho, if ur skinny or fat when you’re still like a teenager, do something about it now. It’s so much easier to lose weight and change your body until you get older and it becomes very hard, not impossible just harder
DUDEEEEEE
I've been self conscious about my arms and forearms for being to skinny all thru middle school
Word.
I can 100% relate except especially the dancing part except I can throw it back move my hips
#skinny people
I didn’t know I was skinny until all of these were true
Good thing about being very skinny (especially when your tall and skinny) is 1) becoming a contortionist in school while sitting in chairs or in odd places (I often spooked my teachers by sitting oddly in chairs while reading on my phone lol) and 2) You can fit in so many unexpected places and make others question life/ their sanity/ *your* sanity/etc!  (became well know in my high school for being found in the oddest of places especially around the end of the year such, as but not limited to- cabinets, behind or under the smartboard devices, bookshelves, ladders, under tables, under desks, ladders, etc)
D-ring belts can be shortened to any length, if you're interested.
I’m 9 and heavier than you
i can relate im 6’2 and 130 lbs😭✋
Inability to dance? Sounds like a you problem
Being obsessed when I was younger, I'd still rather be fat than skinny now being older.
Love the dancing… it’s amazing❤️ love your videos by the way
I can relate
Trust me. I know. I’m 15 and only 80 pounds.
LoL being fat is the exact opposite. In the worst way.
And being vegetarian almost completely(it’s complicated i just hate beef, pork, ribs things like that)abd im picky
And low iron dont help us
Omggg I can relate to all of this!!!
Please let me know if this is a skinny person problem or I'm just weird but I'm concerningly flexible without need to stretch.
Oh my God I got all these I'm so skinny that my collarbone stick out
To a fellow skinny boi I can say that those were some good dancing
There’s are very true I’m 40 pounds under wait this all true
can relate
This is going to sound odd, but if you have a Walmart near you, go in there specifically get a men's belt with two belt buckles on it the reason that I say that is that they have belt buckles all the holes all the way around the belt.
All this is super true for me 😂
Relatable 💯💯
This is me all the God damn way
Finally our pain made public
Those looked like smoove mooves to me 😏
That put new holes in your belt thing hit way too close to home
I’ve got fat to spare if ya want it
I used to be young and skinny but my parents forced me to eat a lot and now I’m a obese fuck
My daughter is the same way. She eats. She is 16. She is 95 pounds. Dr wants her closer to 115-120. She is 5'7". Totally get it. She is cold all the time it seems!
This is so true
Running out of ideas hm?
I didn't care enough to fix my eating disorder which is leading me to become really skinny until I was riding my bicycle and  my ass-bones started hurting, and wearing belts with extra holes make the pants wrinkle around my hips and makes it uncomfortable :|
*I can't dance!* . .   *Imitates slander-man *
I’m super skinny and laying on my stomach rn
This is me! I brought jeans the other day and it took me forever to find 29 by 30 jeans plus I’m 120 at 21 years old. I can’t dance either
Nice dance moves o-o 🕺
You are a girl?
Same
Sometimes I wish these were my problems The ones I have rn are ruining me
You're the same as me
FINALLY SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS!!!
It's us skinny problems
This is the same as if someone said  "white people problems" or "straight people problems" just saying.
I don't think the dance thing is related
Your dancemovse were amazing
Get pregnant .problem solved
Me and my brother both lived with my mum till 19 years old.. We both only ate what she cooked and drank water. He.. 50 kilos.. thin as fuck, still buying clothes for children today.. Me? 110 kilos back then.. how the fuck.. yeah, its just eating i guess.. People are different.
I have the same problem
I think you look perfectly fine
I HAVE ALL THESE DUCKING PROBLEMS. WTF
Oh the can’t dance part you proved yourself wrong
U Dancestors better then me
My grandmother is very skinny but very tall and she always wears a sweater when me and my mom come over because we part Scandinavian which is where Vikings were. I’m half Scandinavian. We take cold better than most others. So we keep it cold but my grandmother doesn’t mind. So she lets us turn it cold.
same
I would kill for those problems.
Yeah but at least your not fat
I'm a dancer and I'm really skinny
Okay- now I’m questioning if I’m over or under weight- I think I’m overweight- but this video is saying I’m underweight😭
Don’t forget relatives,parents and grandparents
I had to make 3 holes in one of my belts just because i was too skinny and my friend even say I was as skinny as his grandpa
Can't dance indeed!
Ikr 😩😭
I found a belt that has holes in the entire thing at target and there were a lot still there so that could be a good place to look to make your life easier
Great dancing
Relatable as a skiny person
I am skinny and when I breath i see my rids
So relatable, just started gaining weights after i turned 23... It still sucks...
Yeah I'm skinny but I can kinda dance
Yo that cant dance thing has nothing to do with weight. I was never underweight i was rather overweight and i cant dance at all.
I gatta get back to a healthy weight
At least your not 1200 pounds at 13 years old.
A lot of people I just meet are like that to, "don't you eat" etcetera. But then they see the amount of unhealthy shit I consume and their like: "wtf how are you this skinny"
I think the dancing is a personal thing and u r a good dancer I mean a lest u move
With my thing hands and wrist 🙏🏻
People also be like " bruh you on meth?"
That's the foking reason why I wear hoodies all the foking time
i lost 70 pounds after hs and was expecting to have no problems ever again but my now knees are always bruised from knockin and its hard to eat anything 😭
Im really skinny and alot of people say omg do you eat or omg let me grab that your ribs might break like bro- that's fucked up.
I have no idea how you feel, im muscular and fat.
Welcome to fat people’s life enjoy
I feel your pain, I was skinny, and to make it worse I was also tall, common nicknames included, walking stick, toothpick, tooth brush and giraffe 🦒
Her:I can't dance. Me: she dances better than me
I can relate and as a dude i was absolutely flamed by my peers😂😂
You can dance way better than me lmao
Can relate
Oh boho You’re skinny, I have a Slow metabolism I am fat as fuck, and it sucks ass sweat all the time, can’t run as much, and if you get too fat and eat too much the weight of your body crushes your legs so they hurt if you stand for too long.
30 years old and I still get the "we need to fatten you up" every year at family stuff... like DUDE you just watched me eat the same stuff you did. I CAN'T HELP IT!!!
Love you buddy
Wow this is surprisingly accurate.
I can relate 😂 it's annoying when ppl comment ab my weight and then I'll tell em I have bruised ribs and they freak out
Does the scale say 66.4kg? I use lbs I wouldn’t know, correct me if I’m wrong but I weigh 250lbs so that’s 113.4kg I’m also 6’ 2’ which is 187.96cm
I've experienced literally all of these problems, I only weigh 108 right now and I'm 14, and all of these problems have been a thing for me, I experience the rib bruises less but that's cause I don't lay on my stomach much
See I'm the opposite I'm dummy thick. Out here power washing in the winter with shorts
Thank you
All are me and I was using speech thing and I got old wolverine
Same bro. 'specially the dancing
Same Short PPL gang in the chat
I hate being skinny
This is so true and worse if your short im 4'10 in 8th grade it sucks
Haha she said the n word
The worst was when my tattoo artist straight up asked where I wanted my piece and I showed him the spot above my knee and he stopped for a moment, looked at the spot and said, “you’ve got some skinny ass chicken legs man”…  Me: “Damn, you right”
You think that's bad I'm 5'10 and 120 pounds as a guy
Dance better than I can
But that dance tho lol 😆😂🤣😅
When my mom was In highschool, everyone thought my mom was bulemic because she was so skinny. When she was pregnant with me, everyone thought she was having twins because her bump looked huge in proportion to her body. She passed it down to me and everyone thinks my 17 year old sister is older than me because she’s taller. I’m 20 btw.
Well I'm glad she made something about this and I'm a fatt ass so
Idk if she’s gay but goddamn I’m attracted to her
Just explained my life in a whole short
You.. you just personally attacked me and I don't mind..
Damn i wish i had a girl like this
hey, guy here.  You’d be surprised how many of these I relate to😂 especially when I lose 15-20 pounds from summer work. Definitely gotta poke holes to make my belt smaller😂
Ever have your pants fall down, when wearing a belt at max and suspenders? Then you might be skinny fuck like me.
Thanks for understanding as a skinny person it's really nice to see someone else like me
I can confirm, all of these are right, though she still has better moves than me?
Why do you have to attack me like this
I am skinny but I think the last one is just me
You just said all of the problems that I have about being skinny.
I didn't realize I wasn't the only one whose ribs hurt when they lay like that. Glad to know that it's not just me
i love your dance moves. really. :) it’s way better than i can dance 😭
Yep pretty true
Amen lord bless you amen
Finally someone to knows about my problems  The Clothing thing is hitting really hard :c
My parents would always tease me because I was skinny, they’d say that if I didn’t eat i would fly away in the wind. I’ve gained weight now they’re calling me a fat a$$. This is great 😭⁉️
This is why you wear sweatshirts like me
I was skinny for 22 years thought wow this sucks I want to be fat biggest mistake being skinny was the best
More skinny people things... can you fit back there and get that I dropped it? Can you crawl through this tiny hole in this wall so we can fix this or that? I locked my keys in the house can you climb through a window you'll fit? There are advantages as well definitely more than being over weight
The scary thing is i weigh less than this girl. And im a guy 180 cm and my weight non stop fluctuates like crazy from 61 to 57 kg
Wdym you can't dance that's better than 99% of all tiktokers
FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS SKINNY PPL PROBLEMS!!!! PPL ALWAYS COMMENT MY WIEGHT!! 93LB IS MY NATURAL BODY WEIGHT
I grew up super skinny, 💀but i ate like a grown man , never gained any weight till 17 years old , then boom i got thick finally,☺️😂💀
You know u dance better than my father? Xd mam he got meat but no rythm
Or just buy a belt that fits? Or one of the belts that has holes all the way around it because it’s made of a mesh material???????
These dance moves though🙌 I was overweight as a child till some illness and my depression fucked me up and made me skinny. People just couldn’t shut up about my body negatively or positively either way. Bc that’s what’s the only thing that matters on a girl right??? /s My girlfriend is reminding me to eat and take care now so I can have a healthy weight.   (Not saying you can’t be healthy with any type of body or that your worth determined by your health, body or weight!)
the best part is im a dancer so…… but yeah im really skinny
Yes
I feel this with my bones hurting. I’m 80-90 pounds atm and had to do Russian twists for gym, my ass hurt so much.
Try being 5'1 and 180 pounds yea
Can't dance? I believe that was a lie. You look awesome
Hi I’m a fan and I have a YT channel
Except I'm always hot for some reason. I'm always the one who decreases the ac temp in the office to the point when everyone starts complaining of being cold 😅
I feel your pain, i cant gain weight
You cute 🙂
I'm So Done with f^cked up people who care about weight like I'm just skinny IM TRYING TO EAT PLEASE LIKE PEOPLE CAN YOU SHUT THE F^CK UP😁
I felt seen today
Bruises on ribs, I have pectus carinatum and I'm skinny.
I was skinny when i was a kid, people thought that it was bad and at the same time almost all the adults wanted to be as skinny as me. Old people saod i'd grow to be a model, but i was as gracefull as a potato, so that compliment confused me. In the end, no matter how any the girl i knew looked, everyone wanted to say something nasty about how she looked. When the girl was very beautifull people searched for her flaws even harder. I hated that so much, i refused to pay any attention to how i looked, ignoring bith bad and good things about dressing up and stuff. I hated pink. Now i still prefer to not spend a lot of time on looks, but when i want to, i do. And i enjoy that time. My life feels much better
Be a model  They get payed  Good
You have skils in danceing lol
I’m the same way really skinny and all these things are true
Your cracked at dancing
Ur slender not skinny
Soooooooooo true
So relatable
Plz reply to my DM's 🖤
Yeah, that's my current problem 😩. But I'm trying really hard and it seems as if it will get better soon 😜.
People saying "eat a burger" pisses me tf off. Thats just as rude as telling a bigger person they need to lose some weight.
whait what what what you cant dance wtf
Wait did it say she was 66.4 pounds because I am 55 pounds and I am nine and I agree with this because all of my life people are like Jayla you’re so skinny and I took that as thank you but when I got to third grade it was rough because all the kids were like Jayla you don’t eat and they giving me food at lunch because I don’t eat I really don’t but at home I can wake up at three in the morning and shove a cosmic brownie pack down my throat. So it’s just and one of the kids said let’s compare our feet and our weight and I was so insecure I was trying to gain weight so she had a stool for some reason which is so fucking weird but anyway She came out at At least 105 pounds and nine-year-old should be 98 or anywhere from 60 to 80 so I’m like what so then I get on the scale and I say there’s something wrong with me and I start bawling my eyes out in the school bathroom like my eyes to read for a week I was bawling and then he comes in is it I’m very sorry I just kind of like you I said wait what if you like somebody you don’t make them feel so fucking insecure and make a ball out in a bathroom but that’s how I got my first boyfriend in the third grade lol
64?! My weight when i was 11 is 46 dude
I would not call that "can't dance" 🤔😏
Omg yes ❤️❤️😭
I just hate being bulied for being skinny and people telling me that there is barley any of me
This person is relatable. For some reason i cant seem to get any fat in my body even if i eat many.
I was kinda of skinny a few years ago , most people just poking my arm and says "woah thats skinny" -my aunt , and now i was the "fat enough cant weat pretty dress" and then people was like "damn , you kind of fat" -also my aunt🤓🤓
This young man is right
I can relate to all lol
Wait wait wait.... she's a girl?!?!
As a skinny kid this is relatable
It's not our fault people like us have fast metabolisms.
I was an underweight bodybuilder and I couldn't stay cool even in winter, I was perpetually too hot
Just shhhh.... Trying to hard now
Sad that I’ve gotten very skinny ova the years, Im getting taller ova the years n it’s been 3-4 years ago since I got checked to see my height n I still dk bc I’m struggling wit my back idk if I’m the only 1 buh then again I’m losing a lot of weight not rly havin n appetite.  . . Ima throw this out there ima big 🍃💨 if ykyk
Fat people can't slav squat though
I am soo like this
And people think its cool to be a stick
But all of that is clouded by being able to squat on a sink without breaking it.
You re doing just fine and you re very beautiful
Relatable
And the family insulting about it too
Best dance moves ecer
I'm the same way
As someone has been skinny my whole life I relat to this
As a skinny person I agree with most of these
When people tell you eat more but you cant because you literally cant afford it...   Cue darkbess my old friend.
Love it
"How did you go from fat to thin in under 5 months"  Me:its complicated *looks down on my butt*
People used to tell me that if the wind blew too hard id fly away. I would just laugh and say I’ll hang onto you.
ty so much im less then 100 pounds at 5 foot 8 inches!!! this means so much tho ngl and yes i am even skinnier then u 😳
66pounds omg
That sums up my older sister. She is skinny but she (and us {the family}) love her just the way she is.
She everything I want in a man
Hm. You can dance better than me. Haha
Omg me too it’s like people keep saying “oh your so LUCKY I wish I was like you UWU”
PREACH
Facts I feel you
Ummm I’m sorry but also the “worst part is the comments”- but like, I’ve been skinny, I’ve been fat, and being fat is worse. I’m sorry, skinny bean, but like still , that’s a little rude it say how “ difficult it is” to be skinny.
You have good dancing moves beter then me
I feel you
Your so relatable  When I was playing for an under 13s football team/soccer team I got put on a diet which was based on me gaining fat
Do not worry I may not be that soon but I can not dance either
You dance like a fricking queen girl!
Can't Dance! me:(dies of not knowing how to dance) Ghost me:well is you didn't know how to dance you would be dead
Bruh I never thought we were this close 😭...
My brother in law has this problem. People think he's an addict, he's so skinny. There are those who would call being naturally skinny lucky. Little do they know!
Im fat as hell and i cant dance soo your good
Chest still absent
Sorry but speaking as a white person the dancing isn't a skinny person problem
I can totally relate, but not like in a pick me girl type way. Like, I am not even, like, attractively skinny. I have all of these problems and it is so annoying.
OMG I RELATE TO THIS ON ANOTHER LEVEL
So annoying not being able to sir for longer periods
I know your pain
Everyone of these applies to me lol
U definitely CAN DANCE
I can confirm these being also a skinny person
Honest to god I can NOT LAY LIKE THAT- my boob starts to hurt, I can’t dance for my life, sitting down isn’t much of a problem but sitting on someone’s lap as a kid would kill them, and I ALWAYS HAVE A BLANKET
I'm in 8th grade 4 foot 2 and 95.7 lbs and yes every single one is true
I fell you girl bc i am in the same situation it's so freaking anoying
"Can't dance"  Me: dance better then me
I'm under weight but can dance. Never thought that would be very connected to weight.
MyGoshhhhhhh I feel this!!!!
I’m confused, what’s your weight? 66 lbs is too low,66 kg is too much.
And my legs has bruses everyday nonstop and my pant has to be like sooo tight to not fall down
Im also skinny or something but when i was younger i was cold every 5 MINUTES and people stil like GO GET MEAT GET FATTER And at school they like👀🦴👀🦴 why you almost never wearing short clothes me : SHUT UP!
Yeah, alright girl, we can trade any time you'd like!
Bro I’m like 119 kg and my belt still doesn’t fit, that’s not a skinny people problem but a weight loss problem, not to mention leather belts get stretched over time.
Yeah, my stepmoms side of the family used to bully me relentlessly for being a twig, so now im a meathead.
😭😭😭 you are f**king 💯 true dude.. But who said you get cold fast. I can withstand any cold without sweater
Looks like dancing to me.
🤣 Ok. Well. Age will helps you.
Every 1 in my fam is skinny even me and all are true even the dancing
I'm kind of like that well because I'm a little bit skinny as hell so I kind of get that and I like the cold so it's kind of Cool so yeah and I always run because of my favorite thing I'm think is a sport I don't know I meant only seven years old so don't judge me
Just eat lol
My 216 lb ass over here lmfao On the opposite side, having a bit of extra weight ain't all that bad :)  1. Most of the time, with extra weight, you are built like a BRICK WALL, compared to a skinny guy, my fat ass is immovable, great for altercations! 2. When you're heavier, your legs are STRONK because every day, all day, you're carrying your body weight, I can leg press over 400 lbs and squat over 150 and I've only been working out a couple months lol 3. The BMI index is bullshit, it ONLY compares your height and weight, not your fat content, not your water weight, not anything else lol, my weight lifting and conditioning teacher is a professional body builder, he's ripped but hes shorter, so he ranks as obese ???? Yeah it makes no sense, muscle is twice as dense and twice as heavy than fat cells. 4. You get warmer faster and stay warm longer because you're insulated 5. Being bigger in the beginning is great if you're trying to work your muscles out for show, because you're already wide lol 6. And in my opinion, if a girl is laying her head on your stomach, like as a pillow or sumn, she doesn't want a surface so flat it feels like the floor, or a rock hard set of ABS, she wants something soft and pliable and warm bro 7. You can have extremely developed abs and core under that fat, and that accounts for most muscles, super cut isn't always healthy lol  You can have an unhealthy amount of excess weight though! If you're worried about your weight, see a doctor!  Thanks for listening lol
As someone who has been skinny their whole life and is the only skinny person in their family i feel this on such a personal level 😂😂
I wonder what 1 gram looks like
I love your dancing
I don’t think being skinny has anything to do w dancing maybe it’s the coordination lmao
Omg same
I like being fat now thanks
I have most of this issue bisede the laying down thing. I hate people just said that i need to eat more when i eat more than them, plus i did get tb soo... that explain alot
i used to have the same problem i was 50-60 pounds and 20 pounds underweight till like the 7th grade but i was also short but in the 10th grade i went from120 lbs and 5'2 to 180 lbs and 6'2 in the span of a year and thats so funny to me i used to fit in a twin sized bed without my feet hanging off the end
yep same
"You need to eat!!!" Oh. Why didn't I think of that.
I’m a bit overweight and just being a BIT heavier than some other people is bad. Every says “fat lol” “if you punch him the fat will save him” “you need to stop eating so much” “go on a diet”. It’s just so rude and it’s really pissing me the fuck off recently
Worlds greatest dancer
Maybe being fat isn't so bad
I relate to all of them except I don't catch cold easily
I had these ehhh fuck1ng pants and one month later they are falling fuck1ng life
Same for me i fu**ing hate it
Its better to be skinny than being overweight
*To me* *3, 4, and 5 is very true*
Nothing wrong with skinny matter of fact fat doesn't suit you AT ALL girl stay cool
YOU ONLY WAY 62 POUNDS IM A KID AND IM 118 POUNDS
Yo just get us0ed to it
Kpop idols:y'all hear smth?
I'm the only person in my family that is skinny and I say I'm cold my sister yell it is so hot how
Shes actually really hot, and tall.
I'm skinny so people ask me to eat more but I like to be myself
I don't know if you can tell, but I have been fat my whole life. If I lay on my stomach at all, it's because I have moved my boobs to the side and they are now painful a/f. I am hot ALL THE FRICKEN TIME! i could go to the poles and still be hot, hell I my body heat would probably melt the snow away.  And well I can sorta dance.... have you ever seen a lava lamp? Yeah, I just have to do a little shake and that's the rest of my body for the next hour.
The dancing may be related to pigment and not weight
Night club dances to scare away guys in the club part 1
Get a job
im so tiny and its annoying and i agree with all
Completely understand, I couldn't stand being cold all the time
My nana and grandpa calls me flaka witch means skinny in Spanish
Your hair looks nice
Your dance was like skeleton dancing
I had to make an extra hole in my belt too... but in the other side
SOMEONE GETS IT!!
cool dance bro
Im 185cm and 63 kg... this is very accurate
Cutest girl
I ain't gon lie I started my weight lost thing and my butt bone hurted for the first time when I sat down so I can believe that
Bro I'm skinny right... But i cant get cold 😭 only hot
Yep this is too Accurate... Like 100000000% i hate having 40 height.
But what if you play ice hockey
I want these problems
Jayos welcome to the cant dance club
Yay I’m not the only one that has these problems
this is literally me why are all of these so accurate lmao
and an insecurity idk if any other skinny people get is being called a stick
I'm so skinny, my friends call me little Auschwitz boy...
EXACTLY
I feel this so much, I cant maintain healthy weight too long  and lose weight without meaning to. I m 23 I m 170 cm tall (5'6 in feet ) and weight 52kg btw I work out everyday and swim 3 times a week, follow a diet for weight gain with a dietitian and still cant get a healthy weight for long. A year and a half ago I weighted 42 kg. The belts one is hilarious and so true. Also besides the belts thing, it's been a struggle to find clothes for my body type my whole life
I felt this
I'm skinny too because I'm a type one diabetic
I’m skinny and I can dance but I feel you
Ngl that’s better than me AND YES IM ALWAYS ETHER TOO HOT OR TOO COLD AND IM ALWAYS CALLED A F*CKING TOOTH PICK but at least I’m tall
How funny. You are, and were, more healthy than any fat or "thick" people who made those comments. You were always a healthy weight. You're only "skinny" in the United States where about 40% of the population is literally medically classified as obese and the other 40% is overweight. And we have to have the president's wife spend her entire tenure as the first lady trying to get people to stop letting their 4 year olds get so fucking obese they need a C PAP machine to breathe at night.
I’m the complete opposite, I’m a freaking hippopotamus!!!!😭
Skinny legend aka my life sucks
Another one, if you're a side sleeper, your hips hurt if you have pants on. IT SUCKS
Damn
A im skiny like u and B i can dance C i get body shame alot my perents are like your to fat stop eating and once i dont eat all day there like your to skinny eat something    and that is why i dont eat infront of my perents or at partys
It’s opposite for me but at one point I stopped eating and now I just have a small appetite and people keep telling me to eat but I do I just eat in secret
I used to be really ducking small, now I'm overweight it's not fun
Same
I can relate
Omg yess
Doctor: dont worry jayus stick dance isnt real.  *jayus stick dance :*
You can dance better than me LOL
Big/fat ppl problems :   I can't dance either  Can't fit into too small places  Standing out a lot (if the rest are smol)   Not as sneaky  Also if you are mad ab. It I'm big & fat 2
YES!!!! Exactly!!! My sentiments exactly! EVEN the fact about dancing 🤣! I think it is because our legs and arms are to long. I and...I am sorry to tell you but even after "right weight" most of issues stay 😅😭
I am like this probably I was born really early
Wish i had those moves
At least you dance better than me
You don't need to poke holes in the belt, you just need to remove the metal part and cut from the leather
im pretty skinny too lol
Instead i have kalcium
So true me and my friends were skiing and i friking flyed in the wind
That's still better than my dancing! 😂
But the sad thing for alot of us skinny people is that,WE EAT SO MUCH MORE FOOD THAN A REGULAR PERSON, yet we still gain 0 WEIGHT
I feel you bc I'm skinny.the most Fricking comment💬 about being skinny is society like I eat burgers🍔 🍟Fries everything that you could imagine so that I could get a little🤏 fricking bit fat l.
How can I get bigger? Hmm let me think about that for a minute how bout…… fckn eat more what do you think about that one? Eat more fuckin food. Eat a lot, sleep a lot, and train a lot
You gotta eat big to get big
You can dance a little bit at least she can be proud about that
Sitting on Ass bones yeah I never thought about that but yeah it’s true
The last one is not true My friend is a great dancer and one day he danced in the street and acted like if the cars passing were his public xD
I'm 11 and I weigh more than you.  Your like my 19 year old sister
You can dance
LMAO ME AS A SKINNY PERSON I FEEL ALL OF THESES 🤣🤣🤣
You’re pretty cool dancer
All true but 6
I get comments from other grown women asking if I buy my clothes in the childrens section or that I look "too skinny" all the time. Not that I would ever, but it wouldn't be ok for me to ask if someone buys their clothes in the plus size section or that they're "too fat", and it's so annoying that even bringing up skinny shaming gets met with an eye roll and a "I'd love to be skinny so I dont know why you're complaining that's not a real thing"
Anybody having a problem with their metabolism making them skinny, just wait. Your metabolism will slow down and you'll gain weight and curves/muscles, as in your silhouette will get more balanced. To the point that if you don't pay attention to what you eat (because it barely affects you) you will eventually have to. ;)  Just be happy with your genetics. You won't be the next weightlifting champion, but you're probably have to work for your healthy weight a lot less in life than others.
I feel these problems so much 😅
Preach
5th was the truest thing like MAN I CANT DO ANYTHING IF MY WEIGHT doesn't increases
As a skinny person I can relate…
Your amzing
I think I'm the opposite of skinny so can u make a vid abt tht 😆
Yes
Do you live in New York? my aunt does and she has the same looking places
I think I have the same problem before
Finally someone else that knows the pain.🥲
'Can't dance' kpop idols: 😅😅
I feel the same
Glad of hearing that you gained more weight I know that sonds harsh (5) but thats kind of nice that people are conserned for you
But it is better than being fat like me
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SAYING THIS I ALMOST PUNCHED A FUCKING 5th GRADER BECAUSE HE SAID I WAS A FEATHER THEN THREATENED TO THROW ME THEN SAID THAT IF I ACTUALLY ATE SOMETHING THAT WOULDNT HAPPEN LIKE….. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK-
I can't dance either.
I used to wrestle as a kid and was super skinny. I still remember walking out to the mat and hearing a parent say “goddamn get that kid a sandwich”
My brother eats everything and he’s so skinny
I was just like you until 35, dont worry, youll gain a pound or two
This is VERY true especially the belt one
Im from the Philippines and #5 for me is good thing or 50-50 i guess, while yes there are insults but right after that i usually get free food and sometimes its to my choosing, throughout highschool and university i gained alot of eating buddies and we now are helping my community with food thrives and free medical health care, btw in addition to being thin we also over heat easily
Can't dance                         Lisa(Blackpink):ummmm🤨🤨
"I cant dance" skill issue
Don't know what ur talking about when u said u can't dance 😏
I don't know about other but this is so true to me
Me too girl, me too
Bruh i cant dance either 🤣
I feel you. I was a skinny guy right up to my 30s. Clothes never got right, always feeling cold (and I have a sinus problem!) On the plus size de, I could eat whatever I wanted and not put on weight. So, good balance, I guess.
This bitch dances way better than me😭
Being bad at Dancing has nothing to do with weight
danceing op 😂😂
Lmao! I don’t think that last ones because your skinny😂
I know this every  one of these problems   I was 110 at 19 then joined army 4 months  later I was 250 like wtf
People call me stick
I know its so annoying right
Im sorry but I cant watch you anymore, your in my opinion too attractive and this upload makes me want to meet you.
Same
Was that kilograms or lbs
😂😂 this is Me!!! And btw those are some moves.
First off nobody can dance and second of all would you rather be a fat fuck them people call you fat and chubby
My cat and I are just like when she danced: Wtf....
Yes. When parents or adults are really fast to point out you're too skinny or something. I get it, it might worry them, but they should phrase it better. I, myself almost got some problems with eating bc of it. Etc. (I still might sometimes have difficulties w eating but it comes from a different thing. Basically when you just... Dont want to eat anything. Even candy and sweets wont go. And then you start to think that you really are sick... Then a week goes, and you can eat anything.)
I still wish I was as skinny as you lol
Omg I have all of these I'm 10 and I'm only 65 pounds
Haha yes, as a skinny person, I feel this :D
I can relate...
Pick up an axe or a shovel. Build muscle not fat.
I Too so my sister eat almost nothing but I eat really much but I am MUCH SKINNIER THEN MY SISTER BUT MY SISTER ALMOST EAT NOTHING AND I EAT REALLY MUCH BUT I AM STILL MUCH SKINNIER THEN MY SISTER
I know, it’s bad to be jealous to problems of others, so I don’t, but damn I hate my fat…  Like, really, glancing into a mirror on my way to shower is just really sad.
Im skinny but i can dance with my fucking ass 💃
Would have liked it better without the profanity
People dont understand #skinny4L
Get a belt from guess struggled for years till I bought one
This is relatable
Subscribing you is not bad choice
No:5 always happens to me 😔 People tell me to go eat something  Actually I eat a lot 😁😂  And I don't listen to them 🙂
I didn't know she was a girl untill now
You and my older sister has a lot in common
I think you should be in a diet on spinach.
That's because you are tall. You want some of my fat? I have extra to spare.
I feel ya on the sitting down hurting your ass bones.  Same here chick. It sucks.  If it isn't a cushion, then I get fucked up pretty quick lol
I am both, skinny everything, but very fat gut, so I just deal with all bad and no goods
As a skinny person I approve this message
Usually overweight people were a shirt swimming. Skinny people do too, otherwise people try to your ribs like a xylophone.
Them moves seemed legit to me.. like I couldn't do any better lol
Nah. Not being able to dance is a personal thing, not a skinny thing. I'm fat and I cant dance either.
She’s so god damn beautiful I can’t believe anyone made fun of her but I know where she’s coming from I’ve been so skinny my whole life and there’s no control over it I eat more than everyone else in the room but put on not a single pound high metabolism sucks
People think we have it so easy WE DON'T!!
Im nearly 40 and this had always been and still is my life
Soooo fucking relatable
Didn’t she say the n word?
I’m a lil bit fat and I dance basically just like that
U are fkin tall!!!!
Okay, the worst thing is when you are told to do a plank in the gym on the hardwood floor and your elbows just cry…
The cold thing depends on the person for example I'm a living furnace :')
I can't stand this chick. Can't speak with out taking the Lord's name in vain constantly. You better repent lol missy.
Relatable because im skinny too
Yes this is me
Can't dance? Girl those moves were fucking lit
you should try eating
Bruh. I'm 250 pounds. But my shoulders are straight up like huge.
Hey fat people got it worse don’t trip , everyone got problems but skinny dudes got it easier , bulk up , fat people yikes you got lose that weight before anything happens and you better not think your metabolism will help you at all
I can definitely relate to it. Society is the biggest problem for people like us. They just can't keep their shit to themselves
We DGAF
I used to be skinny and now I am fat. Skinny is better...to a point, obvi. And youthful. I was healthier and younger. Now I swear a lot and have breathing issues and my chronic health conditions give me endless troubles. I guess I mean that it used to be easier to move and breathe and I miss it.
She has had the exact opposite problem as me, I get very warm, people ask why I eat so much, people say I look like Chris Farley when I try to dance, and I can never find the right size pants.
Just casually standing on the sink
The belt problem is my least favorite. It suuuuucks.
Do the jojo torcher dance
Hey im fat and i still get those except the bruises on your ribs, yea i dont get that cuz i lay on my side or back
Oh getting told you're skinny as a kid must be so fucking hard. The other kids ain't tease you for being skinny and you know that. Shut up meg.
people say shit like bro do u eat wtf and I legit eat more than everyone I know and I'm still a I'm STILL A FOCKEN STICK!!                 WHY??!?!
I relate but I’m skinnier and I hate the fact that hearing the words “do you eat”,“you need to eat more”, ”you should eat a lot more”, or “why are you so skinny”, they’re all triggers that make me cry. I’ve had people say that to me multiple times before and it just hurts. I know they might not intend for it to be mean but I really is hurtful.
i get the being in pain while sitting but.. as a chubby person, sitting on swings hurts just as bad lmao
As a. Skinny person pls stop whining bltch
That cold thing and belt thing actually accurate
My sister is like this. I have the opposite problem, but because we both have each other’s struggles as a reference I feel like it makes us both super empathetic and understanding of the other issue. I don’t tell skinny girls to go eat a burger, and she doesn’t make me feel bad for struggling with my slow metabolism.
I've always been overweight, still slightly overweight we get too warm in the summer, and winter is kinda like spring
Skinny People Problems ✋
WHY IS THIS THE MOST RELATABLE VIDEO EVER
Bro, being fat is worse IMO. I’ll admit, I was never skinny, but being fat is worse because you look bad in clothing, and when wearing trunks or a bathing suit. I got to a school with chunky, and skinny people. My ENTIRE time there, nobody has ever made fun of the skinny people.
Some of us wish we had smaller bodies, but now I see being that skinny prolly isn’t fun. There are some things that I see the benefits in being skinny too.
Better to be skinny than like most of our disgustingly obese citizenry
I'm fat and I can't dance
Enjoy it... The world was made for you. Bus seats, airplane seats, clothes that fit you. Not having to worry about fat phobic Doctors not believing what's wrong with you or helping at all.
This new season of AGT looks great
These problems impact me too
Bumping into stuff hurts twice as bad wen were skinny♡♡♡
I'm skinny but I don't get cold easily, but that might just be because I'm canadian and have cold resistance
I’m also skinny as fuck
I'm chubby but can't dance
SAME IM STILL SKINNY
Litterly everyone make fun of fat people and say stuff like go workout
What about fat people jokes
But you're still gorgeous!
yup
Idk man, those were some sick ass dance moves for someone who doesn't know how to dance😅
"I can't dance" *continues to out-dance Michael Jackson*
Nice dance moves   I'M SO JEALOUS
I have skinny people problems i am a fucking skeleton
Bruh same
Michael jackson who was basically anorexic and didnt eat anything at all but still danced better then nearly anyone from his time and ours: not being able to dance seems like a you problem..
I hate how much I relate to this.  But it's apparently ok to bodyshame skinny people.
Is that why I have bruises on my ribs when I wake up sometimes
I knew that's why I can't dance! Not because of my lack of squills!
Being someone who's slightly overweight, I've actually always wanted to be skinny because if you're skinny you can be moderately attractive, but as a fat person you can't were anything that's revealing because it looks very weird. When you're skinny, you can wear any type of clothing muscular people can.
I'm a 5ft0 100 lbs male. All of this is true. I'm also called ma'am all the time because society thinks men can't possibly be this skinny/short. I have a beard...
Let's just talk abt myself..I'm skinny too
Trueeee
I’m not unhealthily skinny, but I am really skinny, skinnier than most girls my age. But the funny thing is, I LOVE food like I’ll eat every chance I get, yet I never seem to put on weight 😂
Your sexy so who cares about weight
People call me sticks, skeleton, stick ect BECAUSE IM SKINNY oh yah because I skinny I'm very light so I'm called feather too
Girl I would chill with you all the time you a real one
That's me been skinny forever
So true
i used to be skinny and was pretty underweight for most of my life. over the past 6 months i’ve gained about 40kg and it sucks too. i honestly preferred anorexia.
THE BELT ONE FR
I feel fucking SEEN
Healthy weight of 660lbs🤣
If a skinny person can’t dance, then can a fat person dance???
Besides "can't dance " yesss! Finally someone understands! 🙌we're not trying to be skinny!! And when you tell me eat a burger it's not a fuckin insult, because that's my favorite and shit it it out before you can finish your order!
yea, i wish i was skinny but i'm 117 pounds and 5'4 and i have my dad's genes, so I have naturally big bones and no matter how much I lose I still look big. it sucks tbh 😕
The fact you can't dance isnt correlated to your weight at all. That's just shit body coordination 😂
We can swap you know
Just......eat    like, *a lot* Even if you dont gain weight, what's the downside of eating 😏
People who hhave any complaints about being skinny just please stfu
I don't think you bring skinny is what makes you awkward. It's probably more because you're crouched down on top of the bathroom sink for no FUCKING reason. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I love your videos
Like, people make comments like "I wish I was skinny" first of all, every thing she listed, second of all, SKINNY SHAME IS A REAL THING
In all my 16 years of life, nobody has ever told me to get more weight. My weight is 50kg on 16yo. Almost underweight. But still, no one has told me to eat. Is that a good or bad thing?
This a dude or chick?
i was really fat growing up i used eating as a coping mechanism cause the trauma and chaos i grew up around, but as i started to hit puberty (around 8-9 for me) i started to get comments at the lunch table for eating the school provided lunch. girls would tell me that i don’t need to eat all that as they are the same food. boys would tell me i was gross and basically repulsive because my size. looking back at photos i wasn’t that big but i wasn’t the skinny norm for my school. but as i got into middle school it got physical with the bullying throwing carrots and apples at me just basic bullying but the comments got more aggressive and i decided to do something about it. i didn’t eat anymore. i ate once a day and that was for dinner. i would buy food at school so my mom thought i was eating three meals a day (there was this online account thing she could see what i bought in the lunch line and it’s how we got funds for food) but i would give the food to other kids or throw it away. i ate half of my dinner and on those nights where we made our own dinner or ate left overs i didn’t eat. i got super skinny and then the bullying picked up again. i did get a lot of praise for being so “successful” in my weight loss but that went away when i started to look unhealthy. i got told to eat anything i could get my hands on. and the “eat a burger” comment really hurts cause that’s what i was scared of as a kid, being seen eating. i am now at a healthy weight, my bmi is around 25-26 fluctuates based on water weight and whatever. but i’ve been shamed for every weight i’ve been. skinny, fat, normal. all of it. it’s still a really raw topic for me to talk about as i’m still recovering from ana* and mia* but yea i hope this shows to some young kid on here that it’s not about what other people say but how you feel because you will get negative comments no matter what you look like. (i’m not diminishing anyone else’s experiences just telling my own to maybe help someone in a similar state i was in)       * - eating disorders (codenames)
Beautiful just the way you are
Michael Jackson very skinny and look how big he was able to dance. :/
Is she trans?
This was literally my life till 28! 6’4” 175 till 24.
I reckon it is hot
Edits like these reminds me of nakeyjakey... just need an exercise ball and jump around with edits... great stuff though
Ok I’m fat so why am I cold af?
Wow, those moves were JUICY 🤣😁
YEAH!! I have been skinny my whole life (it isn't that big but still) and now at 15 i started to gain some weight (very difficult proccess, my stomach would hurt every day for a week, might have been geeting bigger) and now i'm at a healthy weight. But i couldn't understand why i didn't feel so cold this video reminded me of the difficulties. To whoever wants to gain weight, DO IT, it is soo worth it, but it might be a lot difficult. Good luck!!
Most of these are true
I can relate to all problems mentioned, i can eat and eat but i'm not gaining any weight. Guess that's my destiny, *To be hurt by any single fucking movement*
Wearing high waisted jeans and adding holes to your belt feels so accurate 😭
Try grow up as a girl that’s taller than her parents
These you tubers who just talk to their phones in the mirror are so fucking weird and annoying
Try eating some'more Dik  it's high in Calories....
Wow I felt all of these lol I eat more than a whale, but you can't tell
I’m skinny as well buuut I’m a radiator so I produce a lot of heat so I don’t get cold easily
Im 187cm and weight a bit less than you
Go lift weights
"eat more or you'll blow away in the wind
OMG TRUE I CAN NEVER GET FAT
This is around a 92.4% wholesome channel, I very much appreciate it.
I wish I was skinny
Liar, that dance was awesome.
Jayus, if you were calling THAT skinny, you haven't experienced half of most of the skeletons out here.
I’m like you😂😂😂
I been caught
She reminds me a lot of my girlfriend ngl
Perfection
More skinny problems: you’re sharp. If you jokingly elbow a friend, dang too bad it stabbed your friend.
My brother is seven and is the skinniest toothpick I’ve ever met.
Oh... you call that skinny? You don't want to see me.
So i almost never get sick.....only like 3-4 times a year i think
You know she had to get shitfaced before that dance
Being skinn y i relate to well
I'm overweight and somehow have every one of these problems too
Who's looking to score some meat?        😏
That bikini photo though, you look hella bomb!
You can definitely throw it back though, and I'm not skinny and I can't
Was super skinny growing up (significantly skinnier than in her photos) and then around 16 I started gaining weight and didn’t stop until I was very curvy. I’ve never been fat or anything, just more filled out and I can say without a doubt, it was way easier being super thin. The comments are so much worse the heavier you get, I can’t imagine what they’d be like if I was fat. It sucks when people comment on your weight or body regardless of how you look, but it just doesn’t happen as often when you’re thin.
Me at 13, 100lbs, eats enough to feed a family of 5 loses weight somehow
Yo those dance moves are lit bro I can’t even dance already know you’re I’m pretty sure a female if you’re not in your mail I am sorry but still you’re very good at dancing I can’t dance for crap
🥲
I'm living through that stage currently.  Ahhhh
am pro buff man
Your lucky
“Oh do u eat “do u shut the f*ck up
I’m not sure I Me the person that’s problems that you can think about but that’s what you want sometimes you can’t we can sit in the chair because it’s too small
All of these are true because I experience them everyday.
I'm waaay overweight and I can't dance either 😔✋  ̶A̶t ̶l̶e̶a̶s̶t ̶y̶o̶u ̶c̶a̶n ̶m̶a̶k̶̶e ̶y̶o̶u̶r ̶b̶e̶l̶t ̶f̶i̶t, ̶e̶v̶e̶n ̶i̶f ̶y̶o̶u ̶h̶a̶v̶e ̶t̶o ̶p̶o̶k̶e ̶n̶e̶w ̶h̶o̶l̶e̶s ̶i̶n̶t̶o ̶i̶̶t-
This is me
As a skinny person I hate it And ADHD sucks :[
I'm 20 y.o. 6'1 and I weigh 58 kilos, now I'm trying to fix this.
Me too
i literally deal with all of these struggles all the goddamn time, in my dance class sometimes we have to lay down on the hard floor. And. It. Hurts. it like presses on my shoulder blades and spine
That last one isn't true
I know what that’s like.
She's clearly lying. Those dance moves were fucking fire
Shut up im literally built like a mine craft skeleton
Bones break in the wind
I can hookup with you.
That dance is better than my neighbor all she does is kick and do this thing with her arms.
No one is skinnier than my cousin
She dances fine though...
Naturally big people would give up their left toe to have naturally skinny people problems. All you are doing is rubbing it in their faces. GG.
Yes
Who Said you can't dance
Yes, being skinny sucks. All the comments I’ve gotten about being skinny and the fact I’m going to be fat tucked with me. You cannot do that to a kid
You can't dance might be a you problem 😆
That's relatable for me too
Can't help with most of that but I can help with the belt thing. Long story short.....fuck belts.....get suspenders dawg. They'll change your life.
Same gurl
Gotta say you be look good. Hit me up
Im 38 pounds my son is 38 pounds my son name is Rocky And  Kies
People say go eat food to me, little do they know that I have a fast mentabislim and I eat alot
Idk... I think your hella sexy. Big time
I was like this until like 3 years ago and now I'm fat and I had to get new clothes lol
I’ve had female friends with this problem just complain about being flat and I’m there like “How do I respond to this”.
I heard skinny people are really strong
You dance a lot better than me 🤣
I still wear belts without holes and with those clips cause it just be like that
You can’t tell but I’ve been a big guy my whole life but I have recently found out that I have made it 29 years with missing parts of my heart and I came out of the hospital last year and her issues were the only things that kept me from killing myself. Also it’s fucked up to bring up when your an adult
Your realy a terrible dancer
4 out of 6 of those problems i have and im not skinny. Also you cant dance because youre white just like me & were raised by doodoo parents with no dancing skills & they never bothered to learn
That last ones a you problem
I literally eat double my mass and im still a skinny person
I notice that some people like you can't even stand steady while speaking..
I feel that- my friends literally made fun of me- I wasn't chosen in teams cuz they said I was 'too skinny' and my relatives thought I was suffering from a disease
I have never related to anything more in my life
😘
Trash poor girl
Those dance moves are flames. Stop the cap.
People shame people for being skinny,people shame people for being fat,what the hell?
Same man same 😭 I'm still skinny and self esteem issues
I am 18 and 45 kg 🤫
That was so annoying.
Ur bones are also not very protected my guys
The cold part can be fixed by living in a cold place for your whole life then you get good at just taking the cold and the heat heat strok is for the week
#5 I have the same problem but people tell me if I'm gonna eat healthy or go to the gym ever! Like I can and I walk to work everyday so technically I do use the gym 😏
Lies. You are a fantastic dancer
Cant dance??? Bullshit your taking the floor with them moves
Om not Skinny but i get Cold fast and her brusies All the time and i waight around 80-90 kg 😅😅
Literally boys problems all the time
Yeah, it sucks dont not eat pls, stay healthy please
It's not all bad I can eat a fuck ton
At 6ft, I used to be 140 pounds, which I think is skinny for a man, but i had none of these problems, except for the belt thing. I weigh about 170 pounds now and I literally feel no different.
Hay I'll take your skinny problems any day over mine
You have the worst mouth I've ever heard on a woman. Young girls may be looking up to you
No honey you just have no rhythm just don't living on as you being skinny. You just have no rhythm😅
Im fat and can't dance
Honestly it's probably kinda okay to be just a little bit chubby cause you not obese and not extremely skinny I'm 17 5'9" and 214lbs at rhe moment but I lack an emzine to digest most fruit and vegetables plus with trauma of getting paintful stomach aches at a very young age I stopped eating meats and other healthy stuff cause I didn't know what was gonna cause issues and what wasn't and once I went into grade 8 I kinda started eating more crappy foods and not proteins from stress and being bullied for my life interests and not keeping up with the trends and stuff most kids were doing and the local gym next to my house has been closed since april 2020 after covid started I beed to start working out soon but knowing when the local gym is gonna open up would be helpful
Y'all to skinny? Im to fat lmao.. but still  both have a bad side effect-
How about we tell her about fat people problems 😑
Ok but fr tho. Those were some epic moves
Get a weight gainer supplement :v
I mean I have these issues and I'm kinda fat
Did the scale just show 60lbs‽ hahaha pussy
So true!
I think the last one is just you
same :pensive:
I can vouch for that 🤣 I'm a twig myself 😂
Same one of my friends pulled my arm for a play and literally said “oh you’re so fragile I feel like I’ll break your bone if I pull too hard” and literally all my family members do the same😭
Lololol same the different is that i have afrid 😃😊🙂🙃
She kinda looks like Pete Davidson 😂
And your racist!
Relatable
Society
I feel your pain
No the reason you can't dance is because  you have rhythm  and I can dance and I'm super thin
Ngl im a fat dude and imma be honest I can't dance either
Relatable lol especially the bruises haha
Get something to eat!
I’m not even trying to be intentionally nice, I legit didn’t think she was all that skinny
I'd simp bro
Being good and bad at dancing has nothing to do with weight
Omg watching yoy dance is sad becase i dance luke that cus im 91.2 pounds and im 12TwT
Honestly that’s everything fat people go through
SO TRUE
Pov you just described me:  Someone: how? How?! Me: i don't know
This is basically my entire life holy shit
Not that fucked up to say to a kid. I was a scrawny mf who played baseball and just vibed. Speaking of vibing, fucking great end of that video XD keep being awesome
My friend and I are complete opposites physically  I'm overweight, she's underweight, both of us get unwanted comments on our bodies when we're out in public.  She's been 101 lbs for a while, sometimes slipping down to the 90's, and she just recently gained 5 lbs and I'm very proud of her :) Edit: I've been losing weight too! I've just lost 35 lbs, and she's gained 15. She's at a healthy weight, but I still have a ways to go, wish me luck!
SOO FUCKING TRUE I'm naturally skinny people tell me I got more skinny if I eat I don't gain weight if I don't eat I'm a skeleton
I relate to all of this
As a slender person myself I find problems with all of these
I think you look good and it sucks your lesbian
This is what happens when you think swearing is a personality trait.
I really dont like how this girl makes everything so bad... Fat people have same problem with belts but there does exist better way how to shorten belt... Just unscrew the bolt and cut it... Make new hole for the screw and the belt will look like new. Try it when the belt is too short... And she allso does not make any good research about what she say
Im exactly the same
I don’t think dancing is a skinny problem😅
BRO SAME MY GUY
I relate to all of this
I’ve been 150 for a long time. Im still skinny asf. I relate too much to this.
Me too I'm so skinny, I'm 28 and 5ft 5 and I weigh like 47kg which is equal to (104 pounds) Doesn't matter what I eat I just dont gain any weight really 🤣 The amount of abuse and bullying I've went through growing up is insane. I am still self conscious about it however not as much and it's taking me a very long time to even get to that point
To be fair the can't dance thing is because you're white not skinny
You been beautiful af your whole life
Same
I’ve been skinny my whole life an I eat constantly but can’t gain weight at all smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
im a big guy and all this Applies to me to lady your just experiencing life and atleast people dont make fun of you for being big 🤦‍♂️
I’m so skinny to Lol
So many of the top comments are about skinny people relating to this issue   But the other end ain't any better, I'm overweight and feel insecure about my gut and chest showing through my shirt
The dancing has nothing to do with your being skinny. Also, quit your bitching. Being fat is way worse.
Ain't she 6 foot tall too?
That last one really only applies to white people let’s be honest
I feel u
I relate to this so hard
You can still dance better than me, being fluffier can still lead to being a social outcast from bullying, also we may have insulation but we also overheat faster with that during the summer. Either way you will have pros and cons with your figure you just have to find the point where your happy with yourself. Not trying to sound rude or cheesy
Why does she drop the f bomb uneccesarily?
Shiii..dance better than me
All my life I have loved skinny girls. They always want to cuddle, and you can walk around while making love. There are lots of reasons why I love thin women, but these are just a couple. I don't want to offend anyone. So I'll stop here.
Can’t dance either. I am way skinnier than you
This is true, also have the added problem of being 6'7
You can dance better than me also being larger means you sweat easily trust me
I'm a boy and I can't wear belts cause none fit me the weight of my phone makes my pants fall almost fall down every step I take
Can totally relate!!!
SAME
So I'm skinny??????
I feel ya
You can dance just fine jayus!
Tbh... nobody can dance, we just made up cool ways to move and called it dancing
I may be mildly overweight but I have the massive added benefit of enjoying winter weather in everyday clothing.
Fatties have to poke new holes in their belts too, just at the other end of the belt.
I get you, its a real pain
Legit me on the last one: that's not really a skinny ppl problem *writing* *pops* *up* Me: wHeN U cAN gAzE iNto ThE  FuTuUuUrE-
As a skinny person I can disagree on half of these
Thank you thank you so much i am that kid right now lol
I wish she would curse more!!!
Can confirm sitting hurts like it can get really bad on a hard chair and yes I’ve had to ad holes to belts so they are useful and I was always going to blow away in the wind
As a skinny person. I actually do not get cold quickly. Since I am skinny I cover my body with jackets and long sleeves due to anxiety. But the other things are all true
Yup. I'm a simp for her
what up skinny gang
You can’t dance because you’re white.  Neither can I. But I’m like 20lbs overweight so 😂 5’8 and 180 😶‍🌫️
the belt one is too real
Fym you can't dance
Same here. I have literally attempted suicide bc of being called skinny so frickung much. LIKE IM TWELVE AND I WAY 65 POUNDS
That dance bussin
I KNOW! IM 11 AND DGIWSGDJSGAUSHSGDEIKACSKSKSGDLENSJSKEEIJ ITS SHITTYYYYYYYYYYYYYBEJEHDIEWJSJZODJ
I don't know what you're talking about Jayus.    them dance moves look pretty nice
Sounds like a op Reddit.
Very true facts
I can agree with all of this
I'm skinny I can't dance 🤣🤣🤣
Eat oatmeal bread and peanut butter and I guarantee
I flow today because of the wind today
Can’t dancing is the white American deal but unless you take dance classes then you’re a god at dancing
Literally the story of my life 😂
that bikini pic was great tho
Sorry if it sounds bad but you dance like a person in the 90s and I love it
I never had a problem laying down.
This is in bad taste
Everyone in my family: fuck, put on some weight your too skinny Also Everyone in my family: why are you so shy you need to get over what ever it is and get out there
I’m skinny and another problem: guys make fun of me for being weak. I’m really not, but I hate it and literally have to keep myself from screeching shit abt them.
"you gotta poke a hole through it" IS SO TRUE
Ive just taken to wearing hoodies and jeans 24/7
Still sexy though!
Same here
I am 82 pounds at 14 years old and all of these happen to me every single last one
I’m also skinny af it’s all so true
I agree with all of the points... exept im warm all the time.
You're  a Beautiful  Young Women But you need to watch your mouth.....✌
Who gon tell her the reason she cant dance isnt because shes skinny 😂
Don't dance u will break your 🦴
Man I've been fighting my way back up to a healthy weight for a while now but let me tell you, those "eat more" comments? Yeah they fuck you up big time. Had a melt down in a doctor's office bc she told me to "work on my diet" when I wasn't even there for anything diet or weight related and *had put on almost 10 lbs since I first dropped weight*. Like, really? That's what you choose to say to someone who just told you how much they had struggled to gain weight?
Are those lbs or retard units? Because thats light asf
Fat fuks love to skinny shame people.
I like her I'd talk to her
Don't lie to yourself, those dance moves were fire
Yoooo I relateee  ily😂🤟
This is me 24/7 though I'm really skinny I'm a freaking stick
GET OFF THE COUNTER DAMMIT
Same God darn thing
a teacher actually bullied me for 5, she also wrote like 10000 notes to my parents about me telling her that i was hungry when i never told her anything like that ._.
Don’t be upset with it. You still fine as white sand.
Oh the comments, especially the "You look like you're gonna wither away" ones  and growing up short _and_ skinny, super fun
I'm pretty sure everyone but  hurts when they sit down.....for to long
This person could dance better than my stupid two left feet could ever hope to do in a million years
YESSSS FINALLY SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS MEEEEEE I have high Metabolism so like I can’t not be skinnny and like I relate to like all of these problems (except for dancing I don’t dance)
As someone whos uh under the weight your supposed to be at my age I CAN RELATE TO THIS TO MUCH you got cameras inside our house🤨
Actually i don't get cold fast
Wdym that dance is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen 😂
I used to be really skinny, like I'd eat as much as a mukbanger would and it wouldn't do anything, now I'm trying to get to that point again... and it's not that easy  Beauty is pain, of you want to gain more weight to not be so skinny try rolls, I love rolls... a little too much tho.. hence what I stated above
You're definitely not thin, I think you look slightly overweight. Maybe you should try cutting out carbs?
Being skinny isn't a reason for you not be good at dancing...
lmao I'm 170 💀 getting body shamed 😢
As a 28 year old male, I can confirm, some of the worst things is when you hug someone and they say, "wow you're so skinny you need to eat some food and get some meat on your bones" family, friends, acquaintances. I've heard it from all. And as a guy, you are "supposed" to be big...like I'm 6'0 and weigh 155. I eat a LOT of food. During high school I could eat two big Macs, a McChicken and fries with ease.  Imagine saying to someone "wow, you're so FAT you need to eat WAY less food" after hugging them. It's one thing to say that to a person when seeing them, but after hugging it's even worse because it basically puts a negative connection to wanting to be nice/share in a healthy physical touch. And it creates a high insecurity problem because it's the people closest to you that say it, but like I said it's friends that say it too.  The only argument for them saying that is, "they just care about your health" ok, so it's fine to tell anyone who looks even slightly overweight that they need to eat less food and remove some weight from their bones because it's healthy for them 😂 you're not wrong in intention, but the delivery is wrong in terms of making someone healthier when it just makes them mentally ill. Can confirm.
At least in society's eyes, being skinny is good. So stop whining.
Now, that last one😒..  idk but I don't think that has anything to do with weight.
21 and barely on weight
Dunno those moves are pretty good
Bro I am skinny very skinny and I eat a lot but it burs super quickly and I’m barely moving like bruh
#relatable
First one is sooooo true
SAME
My so called friend shamed me because I am skinny but now she is out of my life which is great
Yeah its q lot of fucked up shit. I'm the same
Im 12 im 80 pounds im soooooo  skinny
You may be skinny and have a hard time wearing belts, Iv used quit a few belts and have bruises on my hip bone area becouse I myself am skinny too, and to be honest there's been times when iv used a peice of rope to hold up my pants so your not alone
Why is this so true to all the skinny people, especially me
Being skinny and dancing is a problem cause you can’t default twerk like everyone else 💀
I get called stick insect for a reason It also doesnt help im 6’3 and im still growing
Can't dance... just copy the Koreans.
STFU JAYUS U GOT MOVES. BETTER THAN ME AT LEAST.
ok that dancing part killed me-
I know who I'm bringing to a party 😂🎉
I'm in my 30s now and starting to get chubby but my ass is concave. My ass bones hurt too.  I got Hank Hill ass lol.
I can totally relate to this
Blames dancing on being skinny 😂
I wish I had skinny problems . . . Girls will always dateba skinny guy, no matter how skinny he is. I'm just broken and fat, so I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life
Why’s this dude so mad all the time
dancing isnt a body problem, its a you problem
Huh? Why go gopnik on the vanity yo?
im skinny and fat at the same time
U better go to the gym
Happens to me all the time
I’ve got an autoimmune disorder called Graves that makes it impossible for me to gain weight due to not absorbing all the nutrients in the food I eat, and all of these hit home. The amount of belts I’ve had to take nails to to get those extra holes
Atleast your not fat
Look to all you non skinny people I am so sorry that my metabolism is high.
A few vertebrae and the two bones that stick out a bit on my pelvis (sacrum?) Would get bruised from the wooden chairs throughout grade school.
As a short person with thicc figure but actually a small waist, I can totally relate to the belt thing
You are gorgeous skinny or skinnier May I ask what are your pronouns?
Yeah and I’ve been fat as fuck all my life. You’re not special:(
This is just me lmao
Relatable.
I'm a litteral stick
I'm exactly like you
Jayus
I’m 16 and 96 pounds, everything in this video is accurate.
Ppl who can't dance but try are the best. That's why everyone loved Ellen DeGeneres prior to knowing her be kind act was a false persona.
I don’t like being skinny or fat
Work out then, with strict diet and hard work should put some energy off for that high metabolism into gaining more weight and healthier too
The dancing is on you because I lost game people can dance and it's not f***** up thing to say any go eat to skinny person that is a child
This 80% true. I can dance tho. But the rest is accurate.
I think that is just you because I can dance and I am skinny
Sitting down hurts me and im like 90kg probably like 180lbs my pants doesnt fit bc there are no pants made for tree trunks aka my short stubby legs i dont get bruises but im always really warm which makes any activity that involves moving torture and i get comments like “are you hungry already you just ate?” Yes mother fucker im hungry i lift hella weights i need my food B and i cant dance for shit i can only lift big things, and small things but thats not as impressive (i can also drink like a god aka thor)
Bro as a fat guy i had to make holes for my belts to lol
Same here  lol 😂
Finally someone talks about problems us skinny people face everyday
It's still be with you. But I'm short I got no problem just not sure about your taste
I was skinny in fourth grade and I’m FRIGGN AVERAGE!! I misss being skinny. Btw, I’m in 6th grade
Nah...she can't dance cuz she white...
I'm on the heavier side and I still can't dance... So... Yea
Make a fat people problems vid because I need I might have those problems
Dude I skinny to and when I sit in the back seats of the car to long my but hurts for hours after
Ooh pertty
No, you sure can't 😆
FUCKING SAME
Skinny people get body shaming like you wouldn’t believe I am so sick of hearing it while I was growing up The message I constantly heard was I was abnormal and unattractive that I was freakishly thin
I can't dance either but it is what it is
As someone who’s been underweight and also just became healthy weight… I whole heartedly agree with this. And those comments. I’ve heard a billion times “JUST GO EAT A HAMBURGER”
Ok I’m Skinny and everything she said is true about me TnT
5'10" and 112lbs. I feel every single word she said. But I'm cold due to Raynaud's Phenomenon.
I hate wearing jeans so I just stick to leggings , can't relate to that belt problem but I can relate to everything else
ur cute
Being short and skinny is possibly even worse. People have literally picked me up without my permission. And not even close friends - like, coworkers and acquaintances that I'm not comfortable with.
You can kind of dance
Me too bro
Okay you can't blame your skinnyness for your bad dancing
Wearing belts also hurts you on the bones where they lay on
dude. i’m very skinny and i have been dancing for 11 years. but everything else is SOOOOO true
DEAD ASSSSSSS
Fr 😂 all of these problems
you dance better then me lmao 😂
My mom stills says things like "Your boyfriend surely loves your legs" *shows me a photo of flamingo legs* "Look! It's like you when you are wearing shorts"  And is just like??? She's not a bad mom but she really doesn't understand that you can also skinny shame.
Is he a boy or girl
I identify as thin, so this really hit home.
God you are annoying
One day you'll gain some weight Lil boy
bro seriously people need to stop that “u need some meat on ur bones” shit it literally fuels insecurity and it’s just really shitty to say to someone. Also, people that are overweight and say “I wish I had your problem” that’s shitty to say too
You can't dance? You dance better than Ellen the degenerate!   And let me fill you in on a little secret. I can't dance either, which is worse, because I'm the only black person in my family and my friends who has no rhythm. I'm... Defective... 🤣
I understand, but your cussing puts me off.
I love you 😭 preach girl
You are so loud and annoying
Yeah all of those are true with me bro 😂
The dance one is just everyone lol
Lmao I have the opposite problem
In a public transport a bulky person will easily dominate for a larger chunk of the seat and you can't fight back with that weight
Last one just depends on the person
After 30 it's change believe me
You like to curse alot huh? 😆
I went from 60kg to 35kg and I instantly lost my cold protection  I live in the north of Britain It’s dreadful
Looks like the way I dance. 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯
Is she really trying to say there's a problem with being fit?? At the beginning didn't she say she's finally had a healthy weight?
No one except Michael Jackson can dance
Btw nvr let ppl get in the way of u no one is perfect     nvr listen to the toxic ppl thay dont see that body shaming is not ok :)
Im the complite oppisite im fat as hell but i wear clothes on top of it and some how ppl dont see it and see me as a normal not overweight person
I loved watching you dance
Facts
#Solidarity
I way too skinny and this is 100% true.
Oh ye I know that feeling I was 88lbs til i was like 17 and now that iam 30 iam still skinny as hell 137lbs
Love people complaining about their own privilege
Sorry to say this ,but your perfect the way you are .wish I meet a person like you.
This is fucking me
U can dance
I mean A for effort
Awesome dance moves 😎
Your still so attractive and fine. But I understand your struggles. 🙏🏻
Same here. That belt shit is super relatable
I'm also very skinny but I'm also tall which seems to make it worse.  The only problems that I don't have are with clothes and I get really hot instead of getting cold.
This video is very true.
Until this video I thought u where a guy
Don’t be mad us skinny people can run and do shit unlike fat people
For a good while I didn’t know what you gender is and know I finally do
same, I've been skinny af for as long as I can remember, and always wondered why everyone else could lay down and not say "ow" every few seconds. hurts like shit. and an honorable mention to my new pair of jeans for no longer fitting, and belt also no longer fitting. And them always being like "go eat a burger jesus christ" I dont like burgers, go shart urself 😄
Thank god iam fat XD
Y are you swearing so much?!!!!!
"You want a ring? Oh, you need one that's a size 4 (14.8 mm) or 4.5 (15.2mm)? Sorry, but we only go down to size 5's (15.66mm). Get a one size fits all and bend that ring 'till it looks ridiculous and feels like it's gonna snap in half." Whoever needs a ring that's size 3 (14.00mm) or smaller, I pray for you.
:v but being skinny is a beauty standard at some asian countries
I can’t Dance too
i have to poke a hole on literally ALL my belts lmao :')
Im skinny af and im always boiling
I like your Dace moves
Pretty sad but just 10× of that and that's what overweight people face..lol
Y’all know how everyone says they want to be tall. NO YOU DON’T. Being tall is a PAIN IN THE ASS. Listen, I don’t make the rules, I just enforce them.
She's a good weight but she's fucking annoying
Dancing isn't a skinny person problem I'm very skinny and I can dance fine but the others very accurate
That's literally me
Relatable
this makes me so incredibly mad. i understand eating disorders and hating what society tells you and yatta but unless you are/have been over weight, you will never understand what it is like to be a fat person. oh no you’re belt wont fit and you have to put holes in it? how about not fitting into anything since 3rd grade.
I hate being skinny I eat like 6,000 calories a day I don’t want you to tell me I’m so skinny and need to eat
Yea i wish i had skinny problems instead of the problems i have now
Pretty pathetic problems. No insulation, so she feels cold? Well, wear something! Do you know that fat people get sweaty in the street WHILE THEY FEEL COLD. And that happens all the time and makes them feel even colder… . (That is because when you are overweight you sweat because of too much water stored in your fat). As a man who had to fuckin torture himself to get to normal weight: from 95 to 80 kg (1.85 cm) - those problems really look pathetic. I have been fat and fit and being fit is 10 times better.
I got an elasticated belt from a workwear place and it was the best decision I ever made because it can actually fit round my fucking waist
I can relate to this
It least your not shy 😢
Just EAT!!!
I've been fat my entire life 1: At least you can fit in any chair you sit on. Hopefully if its a booth, the table moves out. 2. Laying down like that bruises my ribs too and suffocated me and pinches my nipples. 3. I have insulation but I still get cold really fast. 4. My pants fall down all the time too. I have an apple shape, aka NO ASS! If I had to wear a belt it would dig into my stomach and cut me. So it still doesn't fit? I'd have to go buy a new one and hopefully then I can find it in my size. 5. I didn't get body shaming comments when I was younger but, I know the other people my size have like, "why don't you put the fork down, fatty!" 6. Dude, no one really knows how to dance anymore.  How about you just not give a damn what other people think or say and you'll be better off.
All of them relatable lol
Your dancing made me think of Elaine from Seinfeld😂😂 funny video, serious subject, I like it✌
_THIS 👏 THIS 👏 THIS 👏_  I went to a fricking penny sale and these old ladies were talking sh** about how they *"bet I think I'm beautiful, but god she's just disgusting. She looks like a skeleton, she needs to eat meat, why would she ever think —"* I could hardly handle not blowing up at them
“Your belt doesn’t fit??”
Wait you are a girl I am so sorry I thought you were a guy this whole time no joke.
I'm skinny and I love cold
Yep me too bro
Yep it's always been totally acceptable to skinny shame
The worst part is,no matter what or how much you eat you lose weight faster than gaining weight
I'm genuinely big
Say it to vegan teacher
I’m really skinny and only 15 years old but it takes more for me to get cold then most people like I’m taller than my girlfriend and my mum but my mum weighs more and you can tell and my girlfriend is bigger but doesn’t actually weight more and they get cold way faster than me
I’m still skinny af even when I eat 5x a day +snacks every hour
Same problems 😅
I actually like the little dance
damn true
i just wear hoodies and skinny jeans cuz hoodies hide my thinness and skinny jeans are comfy and not tight at all
All those moves r better than mine
Even though im a guy, u are just like me. Interesting
Actually i am medium size body but I can get cold really fast since I do live at tropical climate even 25 already consider cold for me.
Gaining weight is not easy for us actually
She s pretty fine to me
I was like this. My teachers used to follow me at school to make sure I was eating and often called my parents to discuss my weight. I was tiny and really skinny naturally but always healthy. I got so sick of being hounded that I ended up drinking food supplement drinks Infront of my head teacher to prove I wasn't starving myself.   Fast forward to when I turned 25 my metabolism started to slow down and I'm now a really healthy weight and found my curves 😊
would you be rather fat?
5 is just normal in an Asian household
I am a child and people have been telling me ' why are you so skinny '
Do singer breath from their nose or mouth
Hey im skinny but I eat like 2 times the average. But I don't have that problems "bruises on your ribs when you lie down" or "get cold" but sitting on hard objects does hurt
Alot of that is true for me I'm 6'3 maybe 130 pounds I can eat like no tomorrow I've been told I can't do the all you can eat buffets from simple simons in 2 towns I drink like a fish and I cant get over 140 pounds even at 28 years old
"I can't dance!" *Proceeds to prove otherwise.
As a skinny guy, I use an old folding chair to play video games so I gotta use a pillow so I can play for longer without my ass and back hurting lol
I’m really not trying to be mean or anything. But I legitimately thought she was a guy this whole time till I saw the bikini pic
I wish I was that skinny
This is real shit
I'm skinny as fuck also. It's called a high metabolism. & It ain't fun. Cuz u gotta eat at least 3 squares a day or u feel it. Low blood sugar, headaches, lethargic etc.
Absolutely love the dance moves 😄🤘🏻
What you mean you can't dance? Those were some sick moves!
I’m 15 and I weigh 87 pounds wish I had a little more meat on my bones lol 😅
Was that 66 lbs??? I’m a kid and I weigh 90
My wrists have a circumference of like 8 inches.
You can dance better than me what you mean 😂😂
Ahh dont forget about back pains.
Thought this was everyone problems
You are pencil.
I think you dance fine 😂 better than me at least
Someone just found out the word fucking
Laying down bruising the ribs? So freaking true. Hell I think that happens to everyone possibly. I used to be a skinny person until like 22. Finally I gained some good weight and now look like a normal person. Yet, this rib problem still remains 🤷🏼‍♂️
I cant get fat, no matter how much food I eat I never get fat.
I am happy to be chubby now thank you 💪
Did you just learn how to cuss?...not impressed...big turn off
Fat people problems are worse. When your clothes sizes are In Roman numerals it’s a problem.
Eat more and stop complaining.
Same 100% this is my life
You can't dance?!  Ma'am those dance moves are fucking amazing!
👍
6'2" 144lbs....😒
Ikr
Actually my friend is also verrry thin but her dancing is amazing
I was getting more thick this year, then this summer I got jaw surgery and lost weight. Now I’m back to being skinny, I DIDN’T CHOSE SKINNY LIFE, SKINNY LIFE CHOSE ME!
I only got 4 and 6
Well your better at dancing then me!
Damn thats relatable as fuck
as a skinny person..      I relate a lot.
Might be messed up but I prefer unnaturally skinny women. 🤷‍♂️ can’t help they’re just attractive to me.
Me whos trying to lose weight after finding out I weight 260
I can literally eat extreme fatty foods with nothing but lard and greasy foods and not gain a pound !!! It sucks when you get told to eat a burger because i literally do but my body doesn’t gain weight!
My parents used to tell me in 5th grade that I was to dam skinny and my teacher gave out to much homework and when my dad would carry my backpack he said it was to heavy. But the got me thicker because idk if your parents ever gives you like this protein shake idk chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, my mom would scream at me telling me to drink those and I had to listen because yk parents hit you so yeah and now I am thick and in 7th grade... :) :(
GEEZ TALK LIKE A LADY EH!!
I feel this….🥲
Im skinny af but never really been cold
I’m fat and I get cold super fast too
Your forgetting did you come back from 1945 Germany. I got that a lot.
Finding pants is though tho, the one that fits is too short and pants with perfect length is too big
You forgot oversized ppl telling you your skinny, while mentioning their weight is offensive! 😂 we’re all thinking it!
So cold, buy my pants in Juniors. Size 14 slim straight cut. I'm 30.
im 5'11 and i weight 50 kilograms (as boy) and YES THIS IS SOO TRUEEE
Same but I can dance ( bc I workout 😅)
Lol
You look like a man
Does it make you say fuck a lot? Just askin
Holy shit Best Buy!  Shout outs from store 118!
Lmao all of this.  Also my family constantly worried that I was anorexic as a child. I just didn’t eat a lot.
I'm not skinny and I get bruised ribs when I lay down like that for too long, especially when surfing
I was told worse like do I have worms in me like wtf no I have high metabolism
I know what this is like, it is very relatable, around ten years old I was like you around I would say about 90 pounds
I always wondered how Heroin adicts get belts so small that it fits around the arm but poking wholes in it makes total sense
YES. OMG YES. im really skinny and i can relate to all of these 🙄
Your dancing is so funny
My grandma keeps telling people I'm on a diet. I don't care, it's just weird.
My best friend growing up was very petite and I'm a full blown Amazon. I can't tell you how many folks I had to eat because of the "go eat a sandwich" comments. That shit is fucked up to say to a kid.
I'm skinny pants fit tho- I can't dance and I thought the comments were just normal tho-?
Nice
High metabolism got you too
Fast metabolism so I’m ✨skinny ✨ 🤷‍♀️
All of that used to happen to me till after I had my first son. 😅
I just had to poke two new holes into a belt a bought 🙃
1. you can dance 2. I weigh 79 pounds... I eat normally like what. the. fuck
She understands!!! Always cold, always uncomfy, cloths never fit, and the part I hate the most. People can throw us like javelins.
I'm opposite of you, I'm 214 pounds.   At age 13!
Bad dancer cause ur skinny      That ain’t it cheif
That last one is just because you’re white.
Jay I’m 12 and weight 78 pounds; I feel your pain.
What a personality
Agreed 😂
As a fat person I can honestly say that you dance a hundred times better than me.  Just saying
Also not being able to get on certain rides even if you're tall and old enough. I can't count how many times I was told I can't go on a ride because I didn't have the required weight.
i feel u i been called a twig but funny thing is i had enaugh waigjt to take dpwn a kid almost 3 times my size in a game of football
I used to be skinny as fuck also untell the last 4 years I started gaining weight was 120 6ft now im 175
I’m not skinny, but my weight just stops at 200, I’ll go from eating super healthy and whatever my body needs and I’ll lose like 20 pounds, but if I eat just fuckin the worst shit it caps at 200-210, I don’t understand biology all this fuel goes to my massive god complex ig ffs
Why am I the exact same I can fit in a vent and cardboard boxes
I have the same problem.
i get so cold to fast
BRO I'VE BEEN THERE
Nah, you'll live longer. BMI 22 is Master Class. Just be careful of foods with cholesterol in it.
I've been 40 pounds for most of my life this year I am finally 70 pounds that is still not as much as I should be my nickname is a stick and I get cold all the time
Bro I am built like a Nerf football
I relate to EVERY ONE OF THOSE!🥲 Luckily I'm now 12 and weigh 98 pounds 😁
I have all of those problems except I'm a boney short and wide girl, so I was bullied for being fat. I tried to lose weight and I wouldn't eat for days on end, but my life has gotten a little better
This a dude or chick
"I can't dance."  Hey, that was uncalled for. I dance fine enough for a skinny person.
A lot of these I didn’t have issues with despite being skinny my whole life until highschool when my legs got more muscle/fat from working out. I loved the cold weather(didn’t get cold unless it was windy), didn’t wear a belt(now I do), didn’t get bruises on my ribs, everything else happened
This is exactly me
As someone on the fatter side, no, you just can't dance
Your perfect
Lol maybe you just can dance? 🤣😂🤣 Those crazy contortionist dancers are pretty skinny haha
Skin do I dance good
Can’t dance Nah she’s just white
I’m skinny af so I can relate to you and I love your vids keep doing it
Ok but but being fat is worse
Why are you so cute tho
I’m super skinny to and I also have that same problem when I lay on my stomach on a hard surface
I was skinny when I was a kid and im not a even kidding the wind would push me like hard to the point where I lost balance
Yeaaaa you can't Dance lol
lmaoo
YES
But you tried
Better than being fat
I can’t lie down on my back because my spine is poking out of my back😢 School food……
I’ve been skinny my whole life and I also can’t dance, neither can my super skinny friends
Can relate. I just worked out and ate a crap ton.
Omg its me Im skinny people...
I would rather be skinny then what I am right now
I have the same problem it suuuuucks
I feel all of these pains
Love it when you say Fu*k. You make it sound great!
I'm skiiiiny
Same
Oh honey you can dance
that dance situation is for all white people
I’m fat with a flat as 200 pounds SITTING ON MY FUCKING ASS BONES AND GETTING SORE
That is what happens to me
WHY CAN I ACTUALLY RELATE TO THIS dude I just reached 80 pounds yesterday and I AM A TEENAGER  ALL OF THESE THINGS JAYUS SAID HAPPENS TO ME I CAN NEVER FIND PANTS OR BELTS ITS AHHH
I can't lay on my belly cause my boobs are toooooo big! I have no AZZ. Got curly hair so I straighten it while my friends get perms. My eye lashes too long they run on my glasses. Blah blah blah 😃
These are all true
This is fully accurate
Damn... I can relate to this
Can’t dance?? But she be GROVIN’
She dances better than me. Lol
Me every damn day... especially the cold like people be going out in t shirt and jeans while I have 3 jackets and two pairs of pants on and still freezing
ok I only knew of the lack of insulation because my mom is skinny. Also because there is less fat a skinny person would starve to death faster.
We live in a society...
I can relate
You can dance, its better then me😭
r/relatable
Just get fat 😏
omg im a skinny girl i have dealt with all of this
One time in 6th grade I got yelled at in the middle of the hallway “EAT A SANDWICH B****” traumatizing.
You ate talk and skinny. I think you are cute.
truue, also: - i can never put my phone on my lap bc it slips between my thighs and falls down... - i cant catch stuff when they fall from my hands while im sitting. they slip between my thigh gaps as well - hitting corners with the corner of your hip, where that little bone sticks out... the most painful thing ever - when ur blood is getting taken aeaeae my veins are too thin - im not allowed to ride certain motorcycles bc my weight wouldnt anchor it down enough when im taking big turns - everyone asks for diet tips from me, meanwhile im munching on the worst and the most unhealthy food available in the area
I hate how people called me skinny and still do. I'm about 6ft and 190-200lbs. My muscles and bones are dense and compact so I look very skinny, very muscular from when I was in the Marines. I've proven how fit and strong I am to people but I'm still treated like twig, my father (another Marine) was the same... up until people pick a fight with us and realize apparently we're made of iron. The bad thing is we're not great swimmers per se because we kinda sink from our genetics. Also muscle cramps and pinched nerves every now and again. You get used to it. Oh and we go through shoes really fast because we have a lot of weight on boney feet. Destroys them in like 4 months.
It's basically the same for fat kids just the other way arround in some cases...     Except the belt. The belt part is the same.
Ps if you are tall the back hurts like having a sunburn
I have a fast metabolism(which means I can burn off calories and fat like in 5 minutes) and I hate being skinny
Tell me your ways oh jayus, im a fatty fat fat 😅
Being the opposite is cracked too, it aint fun, "ur way too fat stop eating" "pants don't fit. Well go lose weight" 🤚🏻🙄
Guy sitting in a chair with aching assbones rn.
Eat. Remember when you said the N word with the Hard R
I can't dance either lol
....[to me, ur beautiful...]
I can relate to AALLL of these I can’t dance for shit and my parents always tell me to eat more because i may have some health problems in the future heart problems I think they said 🤔
...G-D... ...shouldnt say that...u have no idea... PS-im thin.
Soo any fat or should I say healthy people who almost cracked their phone with anger watching this😐😐
These are so true the eat a cheeseburger gets me every time also one of my friends wants to play football and everyone is like no your going to die your gonna snap like a twig!! It is so true!!
Me skinnier then slender man. 🕺
How to solve this go to Hometown buffet and eat 13 full plates. lol I use to be skinny as you.
I'm so skinny my mama got investigated by child services for if she was feeding me... she was and I eat shit loads 😅
I died when she said she was in a healthy weight then it says 66 pounds
Do not dance or die
😂😂😂😂u look so sweet amd innocent but you swear like a pirate. Hahha i was also raised by pirates. Its hard to turn off
I love skinny girls
First of all...we need to hit the club with those sick dance moves! I'm chubby and my dancing looks the same lol
People don't realize how bad this is
Being skinny is always better then being even slightly overweight
I've seen some skinny girls dance so I'm not sure that is a skinny girl problem maybe a you problem but hey lots of people can't dance great.  If it makes you happy,  dance anyway.  It really doesn't matter what other people think,  you do you & be happy.
Me I weigh 110 pounds
Bruh sammmmeeee
Yo is it just me or does she have a different phone case every vid
Saaaaaame
The 2nd one used to happen to me, there were no bruises but my ribs hurt. Now they don't but I'm still skinny🤣🤣
I can relate
This is me like even if i eat a lot i cant
I get comments all the time! For example; “you eat like a bird”, “we should put some fertilizer in your shoes”(I’m also short), or “you’re a runt”. I get made fun of for getting cold too fast or being so small. It’s really hurtful when people do stuff like that and causes a lot of unnecessary insecurities.
I can't dance for my lifee
Lol for some reason despite me being chubby I have the same problems
You are only 60 pounds  I am 13 and I weigh like 93 pounds
Facts. All of it
Yes I am 😂😂
I am HELLA SKINNY and my friends always say this. “You dance so fucking good”
Stop gangbanging 50 guy’s a night.
EXACTLY
I have an over average metabolism so I'm always skinny, this is literally my life.
"I can put my hand around your wrist!" :/
People judge you for being overweight and also judge you for being skinny
This is an accurate representation of my life 🤣
I think you can dance 😍
Same
I can agree
It Is so awkwardly true that no skinny person can dance. I mean of course normal weight people can but have you ever seen a rEaLlY skinny person being a good dancer? No u havnt
Same... I'm 22, 6'3, 58KG. I never gain weight but I lose it quick.
I cant dance!   Proceeds to dance better than me in every way possible
I have a very high metabolism 😭
It's not a matter of not eating enough, it's a matter of having a black hole stomach that can digest anything under 3 seconds.
Bruh same 😔
As a fucking thin person, yes,the last one is fucking annoying
Damn y'all dpnt get butt hurt and rib hurt when you lay/sit down? 😕
Relatable
Why does everyone say this.... *ahem* FAT IS NOT BLUBBER!! it does not keep you warmer or colder than the next person....I know several bigger people who are easily cold and I know several skinny people who can walk outside in the middle of winter with nothing on and be fine....I realize the few people I know doesn't speak for everyone's experiences but I'm just tired of the implications that fat is as good of an insulator as blubber...sorry for the tangent just felt the need to toss that out there
I have a curse of rare genes gaven to me by my dad and I and skinny and talk and get made fun of a lot for it, many by my siblings.
True xd
Girl there just jealous of you, you are GORGEOUS 🙂🤪
Pog
It’s ok I’m on the same boat as u :/
I also add holes to my belt just the other way around.
Sameeee
Sorry! I've been hospitalized for Bulimia and 95% were underweight skinny as f#ck women. I was 70 lbs overweight. Except for those under 95 lbs who are in danger of dying you have NO problems compared to fat people. Why? Because you fit in society, are admired, sought after and blend but, a fat person is seen as DISGUSTING, ugly,. Lazy and stupid, no one wants to be like you and you sweat overheat,  waste your paycheck on fast food and higher priced crappy clothes, get chafed, smell and break chairs make others uncomfortable and it's ok to bash fatties. SHAME.
I think the “cant dance” is a you problem
Starts off by standing on the bathroom sink with no fear of breaking..... That's a flex 💪 😂😂
What?? Can't dance?? Bitch please you dance better than me and most people I know 😁 You beautiful 🤗
DAMN SAME!
Just wait until you hit your 30s...lol...I was just like this until I was about 32/33 yrs old. Now I wish I could go back to being the skinny b*tch...lol! In all seriousness though I have learned to love my new body and the curves I never had before!
Can't dance? Gain weight!
I understand. Im 125lbs and im almost 30. I can eat more than most think and i don't gain weight. Since 3rd grade ive been trying everything from protein to workouts. Drs just tell me its hereditary but im the only one under 6ft in my family and because of a divorce i kno my father is my father because of the DNA testing he had to do.
I am the short and skinny friend and fricking yes soooo easy
FR
I had friends who were super insecure and felt they were overweight, so whenever I’d say something about MY body (no matter what it was, positive, negative, even things like the clothes I wear) they’d be like “oh but you’re skinny, you look good in everything, you can’t be insecure about it.” Like yes bitch, yes I am, and it’s because of you 😐 and I’m not even that skinny-
You can dance better then me
Be happy skinny people are more beautyfull most times
Honestly I think that you're dancing is priceless and if you were to do that a party you would be the star of the show 😂  👇 This is how many people agree
I have them problems
I've always heard "why are you always cold?" And "Eat some more" my whole life '-'
What does being skinny have to do with dancing there's lots of skinny dancers?
I knoe and I hate it
Me
Please, you can take 10kg mine! I give to you! that is a deal! In 2 months I am 10kg less, and you happy with 10kg more 😁!   Oh if we could do that! It would be easier for everybody, wouldn't it? If I open my mouth and the wind touches it, puff 1kg more!  Hahaha! I 😟
Omg im even skinnier then u growing up people said something messed up to me and they were adults teens children they said "u look unhealthy u should eat more and gain weight"like i cant bc my body wont gain weight no matter how mutch i eat😒 oh and then they suddenly said" Im LiKe So ScArEd Ur GoInG tO bReAk Ur BoNeY bOdY iN tHe WiNd" like thats so messed up😒😒
Yes l can relate to most of this as a skinny short girl cold get me all the time 😅
Listening to your garbage bucket mouth is what makes you unattractive unfortunately real ladies are hard to find
Comments I get couse im skinny  1. Why are you so skinny ? 2. Why are you so skinny ? 3 . Why are you so skinny ? Me: idk ?couse im skinny leave me alone  ( Also i can relate with everything in the vid especially everything !)
I guess we are same problem...
i hate you
It’s not like you can’t dance because you’re skinny tho. You’re very beautiful IMO, you can’t dance because u white as hell 😂
I was working while watching this my leg clicked out and then slipped back in
You’re pretty hot though. I’m thin too can’t put weight on but we can be together and make one awesome healthy weight person
I'm not skinny anymore but  I can totally relate to this
Way too relarable
I knowww they say go eat and im like oh my god what a great idea i can’t believe ive never tried it before-_- or when they say oh youre so skinny this wind is going to blow you away-_-
Dancing is not a "skinny people" problem, it's a you problem tbh😂😂😂💔
i lost a lot of weight over lockdown and went from size 10 to size 6, i noticed things like this, i’m freeeeezing all the time, i don’t even bother with belts now or the holes, my butt hurts sitting down soooo much, ive had to get new clothes because they fall down. but most importantly ive had comments telling me to eat, or i’m going to waste away, i’m so much happier but i get so many negative “compliments”
I have no words to describe how much related i felt with this.
Wtf is that dance
It's true, I'm still skinny and my body temperature drops faster than the speed of light 🤣🤣
I was called narrow but I was able to dance tho.
I thought you looked pretty good dancing
1. true, especially cycling it's a nightmare. 2 true, matresses we sleep on have to be super soft. 3 true, but we get used to it. 4. TRUE! 5. true, wtf can't they understand we are actually eating a lot? 6. false, we can dance, we just look like twigs in a hurricane.
I don't take so much food to lunch too school and people say I have eating problems and I'm a kid I'm seriously 11
FOR REAL, the amount of accuracy is beautiful.
Feel you on the belt holes and cold ect ! I liked your attitude was kwl
So fat people get some goodies from public. But they can just eat their feelings. The fuck do skinny people do? Cry?
I can relate
I’m skinny, but I have never once thought of these as “problems”. While I might get cold, and my ass might hurt a little in seats, I consider myself pretty lucky, some people would kill to look the way I do
You say you can't dance, but it looked to me like you were fucking jammin'.
Im 13 and weight 45kg,bruh I get the problem
Honestly. People go "you need to eat more, that way you'll gain weight." BITCH I EAT MORE THAN ALL OF YOU COMBINED EVERY DAY AND STILL DON'T GAIN
This stirred up my emotions 🤣🤣
My radio just started playing that song. I'm scared
Im heavier than you and im 15
Your dancing might just be a you problem...
Can’t relate.
Shes kinda cute.
As an extremely skinny person who's been skinny my whole life, I can confirm all of this is true.
Ngl the end really got me
I was 64 pounds for 3 years strait ...... I LOOKED LIKE A SKELETON!!!!
The worst is when those dense mfs comes and holds your wrist with two fingers and like 'omg it's so small'
I cant dance
boohoo
Lmao im 69 kg
Damn the belt hahahahahahahhahh same
i never thought of myself as skinny really but I ALWAYS have to add holes to my belt the comments i get are more like “Your body is so out of proportion it’s weird” bc my breast r big and everything else is small in comparison ig
I can relate
But ur pretty tho cuz ur natural
What the fuck did I watch at the end
Jayus: I CANT DANCE! *Proceeds to literally break dance* Me: ok ok! I see you *Starts breaking it down* Me: well sh-
I think you're beautiful. Coming from a fat girl that always wanted to be skinny all my life. I came to the conclusion that this is the only body I have so I try to make the most of it. I dance like an embecile regardless of who's looking. Now big butts are sought after. Wish somebody would have sent me the memo.
When I’m in class, I usually lie down cuz I’m sleepy and my elbows become bruised rip elbows…….
I think we all suffer from that last one
I used to get in trouble for not liking to sit down
When I lost 70 pounds, I wasn’t prepared for the boney butt, boney shoulders too 🤨 and fckn freezing 🥶my non-boobs off 💀I can dance though 💃🏻🤣
I relate
I'm thin as hell and the belt doesn't fit either 🤣 1.75 with 59kg
dont forget when you go swimming. you just sink lol
True so true
Lmao she is better at dancing than me
As someone who has dealt with the whole you need to eat thing, the part that always pissed me off was I probably ate more than 90% of the people who said it to me.
Omg aldc can’t even  dance like you
Im also very very skinny and i can relate to all if these and a lot more😂 like my family is bigger than me and then there is me a stick
Would you rather have to wear an extra layer or get skin removal surgery? Shut up.
I am skinny af and also iron deficient so Winter is hell for me 😂
This is every day in my life. I’m 14 and 65 pounds at 5’ 2”
Im not skinny but i have the same belt proplem because i wear oversized and i  can only find male size belts  and the women belts are only for show or accessories
Wait your a girl I I very cool
😂 i live these problems every day. she must be an awesome friend to have 🙃
I was the same way until I had kids 😥
Oh poor you, someone told you to eat a burger once. Cry about it more, society is built for you.
Same here
Better than being fat 🤡👈
Please stop shouting at me
i thought it was only me who had skinny problems- i'm 2 times skinnier than you but i can relate to this so much
Same
I'm a fat girl with skinny girl butt problems lmao
I was rarely average/overweight growing up, and I remember getting told to est more a steak whenever it came up.  Bit I wasn't really noticeably skinny to most people
I think the dancing is user input error not so much weight 😂😂
My daughter is thin she's always hot!!!😳
I feel your pain I’m 6,4 at 14 my metabolism is off the charts
Gay
God the first 4 at least so true for me. I've been 125lb till like 2 years ago, I'm over 21.
I'm glad I'm not the only one
I have the same problem
Just her dancing sent me into a laughing fit
Dancing was accurate
Can relate
I feel it lass. Same here
Yessss
Ahahahah same shit tho
But you will stay hot AF no matter how much you eat
Do the robot dance it would be mildly easier for your body structure.
I am 100% the exact same. But obviously not the same person because that would be kind of creepy
You didnt look skinny
Is this Justin Bieber?
I feel this in my skinny bones
I have such a crush it hurt
"I can't dance!"  Proceeds to bust the moves
I've been skinny my whole life as well and have all the same problems other than 1. I am a male with a fat ass so my ass is protected
No, you can't dance.
Dude same I'm skinny and even over here in Canada people don't like doing anything in just six Wii remotes stacked on top of each other
Jayus: I can't dance! Also Jayus: Dances amazingly
Love this video
I got comments about eating too. I ate 5 meals every day
Spooky scary skelitons!
Shaming skinny people sounds like something that would happen in the USA.
lol if I drown in water and you let me sit there I’ll begin to bloat
This is literally me
you can HELLA dance
Girl that last one is just a you problem 😭
HOLY SHIT. THAYS A CHICK. Sorry. I honestly thought she was a dude.
Dance moves solid IMO 💪
Whenever someone says I should eat something, I'll burst out laughing because I eat a lot. And the sitting down one is so relatable, like the chair would have to be reallyyy comfy.
bro do you even lift?
I have never related with someone this much, especially the butt thing maan it hurts
I know the pain
I feel the pain
I might be a stick but somehow even though i should have no insulation i somehow i can survive just above freezing in a jacket and shorts
“Go eat a burger or something” Bih ill go to an all you can eat buffet and still get skinnier
I could always see my ribs I ate and ate but it all just went down to my stomach I gave up and I started getting used to working out everyday and I got abs so then I realized I still saw my ribs but I noticed other people with abs also have it so I wasn't to concerned
I was bullied for this for the longest time it really messed me up bc as a kid I was underweight and was the size of a 5 year old at 9 so it made me really self conscious bc I did eat and I started to take supplements to help with it
Holy heck I've never related to something more !!
I bet if you eat 6 doughnuts every day you’ll see weight pile on
Fat people can relate to 4 and 5 too lololol.  5 especially.
Thankyou 🥲
Felt that last one
Not being able to dance definitely isn't because you're too skinny 🤣
BRUH AT SEA WORLD LIKE 3-2 YEARS AGO (not entirely sure how long ago-)THIS RANDOM ASS GUY JUST CAME UP TO ME AND SAID “you know why your cold? Because you have chicken legs :3” AND THEN CONTINUED WALKING- ME AND MY MOM WERE SO SHOCKED AND CONFUSED WE DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO SAY- but the thing is… WE WERE IN THE FUGGING PENGUIN EXIBIT SO YEAH NO SHIT I WAS COLD I DIDNT HAVE A JACKET!?
Stop cursing please you ignorant child...🤷🏻‍♂️🤗
Just go eat some grilled chicken and about 5 peanut butter banana sandwiches a day. In no time you'll be yoked.
You are wrong about dancing look up les twins
"poke new holes in your belt"  Skinny and really fat people: yep, I hear that
The belt problem is so true
I had that problem, then I moved to the desert and got married then went from 6'1" 165 pounds to 240 in like 3 years. Now I stay around 200 to 210. Wish I could get back to 175 to 180
Same I'm very skinny and have to deal with most of those problems to.🤣🤣
..Learning something new everyday  🌈⭐️The More You Know
I'm hella skinny to and short lol
True true
Some of the most relatable crap ever, I’m a skinny kid that has like no fat and I eat HELLA a lot and I’m still so thin
Racist too.
Relatable as I'm like this as well so I understand
Me too. I look like a stick when I try to dance lol
These are true minus the fact that I can dance
"6. I can't dance!"  Literally killed the dance after saying it.
Shut up onlyjayus
Wait the Butt thing isn’t normal
As an 18 year old, 90 lbs, 5'5, these are all true especially the lack of insulation
I'm not skinny at all but I have most of these problems too so I don't think it's very accurate
All of these things happen to me and I did not think I was skinny lol
Why is all of this me?
Well atleast she is not 45 at 16
Very relatable.
OMG IM SO HAPPY U POSTED THIS I honestly thought I was the only person that literally just didn’t gain weight no matter how much I tried.. the only thing that I disagree with is the dancing one… I think we just aren’t good at dancing in general 😅
This is so relatable thanks m8
Finally, SOMEBODY LIKE ME!
Trust me it is worst being fat at least  some people compliment you like omg your so pretty cause u r but they dont do that when u r fat
As a skinny person, every problem you mentioned is absolute facts.
I can relate to everything but that last one I think that one’s just you
Sorry I am also vegan
Haha joke on you I am just 13 and my weight is 88 I am heavier than you and faster than you and stronger than you and I'm also six foot 1
Dance moves are better than what i would be able to ever do 😂
I finally reached 90 and went back down to 87.  I wish I was joking when I say wind actually pushes me down hills.
my best friend in a nutshell
This is the first YouTube video to make me cringe so hard that i actually yelled stop at the screen, please, on God's good earth, never dance ever again
2
"Can't dance!"  Proceeds to magically dance like a Sim.
It’s pretty much the same thing for bigger people like your clothes don’t fit so you have to get bigger but now they’re to big so you have to get a belt belts not big enough poke a new hole  the only thing that different is we have insulation
Ngl this is all true
Someone called me a POW once, that shit hit me hard.
This skeleton can confirm
I'm only 5'7 but there is only 1 "tall person problem" I know I relate to despite being "average height" or "kinda tall for a woman". And that is when short men fetishize the FUCK out of women taller than 5'5. Just like how some women fetishize men taller than -what? 5'11? Idk what height people are even talking about on that end as I'm not part of the weird ass dating pool that has taken over decent conversations and self respect these days. All I know is that fetishizing people is creepy regardless if you're male or female. Preferences are one thing and that's fine. But beyond that it's weird af.
I was skinny and I lived in the uk 🇬🇧 so it was freezing as balls
as a person who’s been thin all their life, i jumped up with every fact
I have the same skinny problems
You dance like a paperclip taped to a maple leaf in the middle of a tornado. No offense.
You have also said the NNNN - word during your life. I’m writing it with extra N’s in hopes that the message doesn’t get auto filtered out.
182 cm across 50 kilos....
Seriously!!!
I mean I’m a medium person, not overweight and not skinny skinny but a perk of being a girl is I have stretch marks on the inside of my thighs and I’m not even that big
I would rather be skinny than large 😐
As I watched this, I finally felt like I am not the only one, all of these are true besides something that I never tried and that is laying in that one position
I weighed 135 lbs when I qraduated High School I benched 250 but had no size once I hit 40 I hit 160 and then shot up to 250. You may have always been thin but you've also always been very attractive i.e. HOT !
As I skeleton I can relate to this
I've been underweight my while life, and this is extremely accurate
Whats her onlyfans?
That is dancing and I dance like that!
i was heavily bullied as a kid for being incredibly skinny, these girls would yell at me saying i was ugly and anorexic, they would write insults on my desk and they never got in trouble, and even my dad would make constant comments like “you should eat more, I could break your arm if I wanted to” when it was literally just my body type.  yet I never felt like my pain was valid because it wasn’t as big of a problem as fatphobia (which it isn’t, but I know now that it was still bad) I’d always hear people say things like “I wish I had that problem” or “why are you complaining? people want to be skinny!”  all this to say that you shouldn’t comment on someone’s body PERIOD. you have no idea what someone’s going through, where their self esteem is at, their medical situation, or what their ideal healthy body looks like.
It’s the same with me!
Just be happy you ain’t fucking short, quit complaining when you can just fix your problem by eating.
I love the dancing 👍👍
Well I weight 194 at 15 yrs old
Same girl
Bruh Skinny or not, the most important thing is height. I'm short & skinny af (5'5")
So I'm very skinny and I had a thing where id suck in my gut and put my hand under my ribs to creep ppl out. A girl ligit straight up said "are you anorexic?" And in the back of my mind I was just like 'TF you just ask me bitch?!' but I just walked away cause I had recovered from bulimia the year prior as was almost at a healthy weight. I'm not at a healthy weight for my age.
I can't dance do I respect u
Bru this is me I only just go to like 65 pounds and all of these are accurate littertly almost all the comments are the same like Bru no matter how much I eat I'm still a tooth pick
It sucks I have the same problems
Healthy weight" she's 66 pounds at 9 I was 75
Same
As someone who was underweight my whole life and is now overweight, I would much rather go back to having my skinny girl problems. Yes people commented on my weight more but now I have to deal with nasty sweat in unholy places lol
So true that way 75 pounds and i am 13
Awwwww poor you.  Try looking at a piece of broccoli and gaining 10lbs. Fuck off
The doctors literally called social services on my parents because I was skinny I've been 100.0-109.5 that's it for the past 3 years
Same girl
Facts
Ikr
I dunno... That dance is kinda hot...
I used to be super skinny and a have breeze that nobody had trouble with blew me into the back bumper of a car
I thought you said that you couldn't dance? That right there was the bee's knees player
Good thing for me: I’m dUmmy thIcc and i have plenty of insulation in my fOlds
I am a skinny skeleton person I used to be chubby now I'm a stick
You kiss your mother with thar mouth?
I’m also a skinny person I’m like 91 pounds while being 16 so I can say all these comments are true XD
Why is this me
The 5th one tho 🥲
Damn!! This girl is Tall af
I know your pain 🥲
Being skinny isn’t why you can’t dance it’s cause your white
You skinny but rly cute if you ask me
shut up and get sturdy
Finally someone who understands what it's like 👍 👌 🙌 👏 🙏 😌 👍 👌 🙌 👏 🙏
Basketball comments...that doesn't even compare
"Do you eat?" "Yes, do you ever stop eating?"
OMG super relate 🤦‍♂️
I was a literal skeleton my whole life, right up until like a year ago. Im so glad i have a little more meat on my bones
Ok that poke extra holes on your belt thing cracked me up 😭
What about running around in the shower to get wet? U was killing it with those dance moves
🤣🤣🤣.  YOU HAVE TO WAKE YOUR METABOLISM UP WITH SOME HOME MADE "PUERTO RICAN" FOOD.  #BRRR!!!💪💪
Why is this so true
This is the thing I’m most insecure about and my friend always says: oh my gosh I wish I was as skinny as you!”…..
I had to poke a hole half way down my belt, and now I got smaller so I need to poke ANOTHER HOLE.
Fat people can't dance either tho?
Accurate
Skinny squad assemble! Let’s goooo!
Anytime anyone says something like that I just respond with, “Body shaming goes both ways.”
I felt this, and my grandma still makes the “you need to eat more” comments
I was sad all day bc of something i don't wanna talk about and at tge end i fucken died laughing you made my day bro
im ALWAYS SOOOOO FREAKIN COLD IM SUPA SKINNY
Nah, that’s just how us white people dance
This was me until recently.  Fun fact: I ate 4 square meals a day in high school and still lost weight.  In college I had to quit going to the gym because I was just losing weight too much.  Thankfully anybody who knew me knew I could eat and eat and eat.  I still can, it just isn't a good idea.  You may fond your metabolism will change as you get older. Patience is advised until then enjoy it while it lasts.  Girls would have the skinny problem worse than boys simply because the obv assumption people go to directly is eating disorder but I don't believe you have that.  Stay safe!
I never thought about myself! I'm genetically obese in a community that is typically skinny beans, and I got a lot of discrimination from teachers and also I'm extremely at risk for cancer, so those are a few of my problems lol- (I'm not that big anymore but it was an extremely painful process)
As a fairly thicccc person... I would 100% prefer these mild inconveniences more than being fat
THE DANCING ONE IS SO ACCURATE! I’m disgustingly bad at dancing. 😂
Thank you. I have wondered these things about svelte people.
I thought you said you couldn't dance
I’m fat and I had goosebumps...it was ninety degrees out
As a really picky eater and a skinny person I can understand all this shit. And another thing, I hate holidays because when I was younger EVERYONE in my family commented on how i was so skinny and never ate right. and I would see everyone with a full plate of food even my younger cousins grabbing seconds, and here i am with half a plate of fucking cranberry suace and fucking potato chips trying not cry listineng to everyones stories and jokes, wishing I could just me a normal weight. I hate it when people caal me anorexic and shit too because if they really thought it was true wouldn't they take me to a doctor? and now i'm 15 yr old 5'2 and weight 109 lbs and my mom asked me what I weighed and I told her and she freaked out like "OMG your gaining a lot of weight!"(which makes me so uncomfortable) I only gained about 7 lbs in like idk 5 months, she makes it out to be like i'm fat even though i'm just growing... It's like there is no inbetween. Am I fat, or skinny, make up your fucking minds! Sorry just needed to vent about this
I'm 6'2 and I was 140lbs until I was 41 so most people thought I was on drugs
To be fair, I don’t think anyone can really dance besides maybe Michael Jackson
Is this why ur getting cancelled?
Don’t let the body positive community find out you saying this they will freak out and call you fatphobic… keep up the good work
Damn I’m skinny but i love the cold
4 and 5 is the one I relate to the most
It goes  1. Fit: 😀 congrats 2. Husky: not fit but strong 3. Skinny: her reasons 4. Chubby: strong but made fun of by people  5. Dad bod : called fat but when you say your fat people disagree and have no arm/leg fat or muscle  6. Obese : higher chance of diabetes unless it’s genetic
CAN RELATE!
Omg I watched this yesterday and forgot how freaking skinny i was and couldn’t sleep until i was on my stomach. Woke up today and my chest was bruised so bad it hurt to breath.
And can dance better than I can
🎶 Skinnyyyyy 🎶
Being skinny is just having anime look ( :
As a fellow skeleton, I can attest for every point being true.  Especially #5
My sister gets lift in a roller-coaster games
I’m just like you I’m just like you you’re just like me you’re just like me that’s what I was thinking about this intire video
I got pushed over by the wind the other day 😭
EVERY SINGLE ONE 🤌🏼 but I’m not skinny-
THIS IS MEEEEE
She’s got some moves
Just eat👀, bruv I eat for two the actual fuck 🤣. High motablism and active lifestyle. Fuck you
And people be doing👌to your skinny 💪arm
I am very very very skinny
You're beautiful
Skinny but definitely gorgeous too
Im a skinny skeleton person too and i wear black hoodies and jackets during summer bcs i get so fucking cold
lmao. Same issues here. And I also can't dance🤣🤣👌💯
I like this content a lot better than the emotional manipulation stuff. Feels better inside
My biggest problem is sitting in school chairs, hurts my spine sm cuz I have poor posture. My spine is legit like the bumps on alligators backs
Dude even after hearing all of that, I still want to be that skinny  Bruises and the cold hurts less than my boobs slapping me in the face when I run. Or the back pain, and the low energy.
when i lay on my back i dont look at my belly, because i can literally see my ribs
Im 6'6 and weigh less than u i feel u rn
So true
I don't think number six has anything to do with being skinny
I was so thin as a young woman. I weighed about 100 pounds. I was just a thin person. I ate all the time. I got all kinds of comments like this and mostly from stranger's!
The Dancing isn’t a Skinny Problem
Yep not even that long ago, dumb people called me a stick from Apple Jacks, now insecure to wear short sleeve shirts :/ i hate people.
People on October said, you being a skeleton this year? 😒
You can't dance, try sum fenugreek 10grams/ daily sprouted while drinking red clover tea few times a day. This is highly estrogenic and progesterone producing, so feminized weight will develope quick after 6weeks or more of use
The one about sitting down hurting your ass hits the hardest.
Your dancing was amazing bte
I have the experience with the you got really cold fast my feet are really cold all the time like even as I'm saying this
This is so true! I am also very skinny 😅
Your parents must be so proud of your broad vocabulary....
Same I know how you feel and it hurts being called names because of it
Same
The feels hit hard
I get made of being skinny its so messed up i only wear long sleel shirts so they cant see how skinny i am and i only wear panys even in summer i dont even take my shirt off wile swimming
I FEEL YOU PEOPLE ALWAYS BE SAYING “how’s the weather down there”
I think we ALL can relate to that last one, skinny or not, right? Right guys?
SAME
I feel this, im 6'2" and skinny as fuck. Fucking slenderman, im too skinny for a male at this height 🤦🤷
At least Ur not fat
Sit ups are the worst
I ended up being a binge eater from the bullying. I have days where I feel I’m starving if I don’t eat every ten minutes. Still can’t get over 110 lbs
Ayo yo it's true but damn we skinny peeps gotta stick together
I can relate to all of these except for getting cold. It could be 50 degrees outside and to me it feels like 70 degrees
Eat more pizza
Same I am so fliping skinny😂😂
When people say that I just call them fat
I can agree and now people fat shame me like really?
I still rather be skinny sorry o3o im still always cold, i used to be skinny
Meto
As a part of the skinny community, I agree 100000%
Can not dance is a you thing
I fixed the belt problem where it's stretch only and you can poke the hole anywhere you want with ease.
As a skinny underweight person almost NONE of these were true. But the belt is true. But I don't wear belts. 😁
I cant relate sadly B,]
Why u standing on ya counter all tha time 🧐🧐
Skinny gang
So true
Can't dance is just a white person problem
My sister is very skinny and she uses a blanket EVERYDAY
You can't lay on your back on the floor because all your weight is on your tailbone
I know that I'm not alone in this world
youre still going to be more socially acceptable than larger people though. ive struggled with weightloss my whole life. mainly because i have an over active knife and fork but yeah... id much rather be able to complain aboht being skinny and struggle to gain rather than struggle to loose it even when fasting, eating healthy or whatever.
Girl no one can dance
I rather b3 fucking skinny okay? XD
Bro I would pay to be skinny lmao
Worst part is using the shitter and never finding a toilet seat where you don't fall in
Relatable
When I lay down it feels like my organs are getting pushed by my ribs
So when i was in 5 grade i was really skinny and i have a brother who at that time was fat and he is 2 years older than me, so when i told my new teacher who my brother is she said "Does your brother eat all ur food?".
I think people forget that skinny kids get just as much unnecessary flak as fat kids do.  I'm sorry my body is a discomfort to you, now could you move your fat ass head out of my way Jerome.
Being a skinny person my older brother had to hold me down when I went fishing because the wind was blowing me away also these are all fact like can't they make skinny clothes for tall people
same im a Skinny person and my mom and family would always tell me to go eat a burger from McDonald’s or somewhere
115 pounds: "go eat a burger" 135 pounds: "go eat a salad" Clearly nothing is enough so why listen to them and care about their opinions? Just do you. (Unless you get as skinny as Karen carpenter. She will be missed. Her and her voice.)  Edit: sorry if I scared anyone with the pounds. I was just putting an amount of weight down, and if it makes you feel better, I was 140 at 12 years old and was 5' 1"
Lowkey looked like shaggy dancing
All of that is the same as me because I am very very skinny
U give me 🍒fruity🍒 vibes. Just me? Oh... ok...
I'm really fat and I have an older brother (age 19) who was really skinny, and I don't think he realised at the time but people used to tell him bout how skinny he is, and he really got annoyed and started working out to gain muscle, but his body was weak for it so he started eating a LOT of food. So he ate many different dried fruits, loads of Nutella with bread, and other things. He also ate healthy stuff to make sure he wouldn't have bad health, but now he has muscle but he looks fatter and everyone comments about it. Honestly if your fat or skinny, it's gonna be hard so imo do what u want but make sure u can get healthy to not be in pain- (sorry for the rant)
Dang  , I feel  so  bad  for  the  5 year  old  kid  I bullied when  I was 9 for  being  skinny I wish  i could  say  sorry  I feel  so  fricking  bad .
The dancing was so funny tho.... NO OFFENSE
But a “perk” is your entire body is a weapon
Mabye I'm not skinny lol
Any advices?
My dad tells me I don’t eat enough because I’m to skinny and makes me eat more than I’m hungry for. I get his intentions, but that doesn’t mean I like it.
i was getting ready for pe at school once when a girl i barely talked to came over and asked if i’m anorexic
This is more relatable than someone saying they're human
Black pink is skinny and IS SO FUCKING GOOD AT DANCING
I had to poke new holes I'm my shoes 👍
Eat and lift that’s all I did and that’s all I do
as a skeleton i agree especially the cold
That's me
Ok now make fat people problems being fat is a lot harder 0-0
Finally someone says it
And everyone always tells you your lucky so you can’t complain
Love your carisma
Bruh
that’s cole sprouse, u cannot convince me otherwise
I still and will forever think that being fat is 1,000× worse. The ridiculing is waaaaay worse than just "you're too thin". You can't possibly imagine the horrible things that have been said to me and behind my back my entire life. "I bet if she sat on a pumpkin her a**hole would just absorb it. Haha it already looks like it happened" "ew look at that disgusting pig trying to eat like a human" and other fun things. And don't get me started on health problems
I cant tell you how many times I have been called skin and bones
I'm 5he same way been skinny pretty much since u was 16 so the past 20 years and I've been threw it all but I can dance but the rest are spot on lol
I lost 160lbs...my feet hurt if I'm barefooted and sitting on a hard surface hurts bad. I keep bruising my hip bones and I don't know how oh and my knees too. I'm freezing all the time now too. I was very small as a kid got sick as an adult and the meds put 200lbs on me I finally got that weight off me but dam lifes way different and I feel for ya hon ♥️
You were that much you’re skinny I am only 79 pounds and they’re 66 pounds
Didn’t mention that people are weirded out that you can see your intestines?
Same thing with fat ppl
I’m skinnier than you lady and I’m 101 pounds
Yup this is true sadly
As a man who has seen and is friends with many skinny bony people I am genuinely concerned they might break a bone easily and for the record  you do not look skinny rn
Ok    The dancing one is more tall skinny problems         I’m pers very fall I can’t dance to save me however     ALL MY GOD DAMN FRIENDS THAT ARE FREAKING IDK 5’0 CAN DANCE LIKE A GODDESS        DUDE     WHY
Do squats and start eating 4k calories a day I imagine you'd have a problem shooing men away if you started resistence training
oh boo hoo ur skinny stfu ur literally the standard
I’m skinny but I’m always warm Farley cold
As someone whos also been skinny all their life, trying to gain weight just feels impossible. 2 months ago I was 56kg and yesterday I checked and it was 54kg. Its like the more i eat the skinnier i get. Wtf.
I'm a skinny man I understand what you are saying but the dancing thing has nothing to do with you being skinny
I have all the same problems I'm also super skinny
Look, i am a real life mosquito.
I am also skinny but I literally eat everything…I’m 15 and way 96 lbs-
Jayus fucking poppin off
same evem tho i've gained some weight
Bruh don't mention this stuff it's the bane of our existence and you know it
Same!!!!!!
True
I am skinny, but I really love eating meat so when someone says go eat something I would say that I am
Me to bro
🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
same i have a really fast metabolism (i only weigh 92 pounds) and im only 5'½
Omg the comments from people tho! I honestly think it should be considered body shaming, I used to feel horrible about my body just because my aunt and uncle used to be so rude about how skinny I was.
Like do you know how bad is to be FAT?
I'm skinny and  I do dance I do comp
Dang it į can relate to you so much į am 22 yers old and i have alll and more of thees problems, and i am just 72 kg and 1.90 metres high
Lol
People please stop ruining your belts poking holes in them like noobs... These holes will make your belt weaker and if you need a another one because you gained or lost a little weight is gonna look baaaad... Here's a smarter way:  Step 1 (Measure): Put the belt around your waist and mark the position where you'd like the new hole to be by pressing the prong against the belt. Now measure the distance from the mark to the middle hole.  Step 2 (Disassemble): Unscrew the screw and take off the buckle, loop and all that things at that end, remember how you disassemble them, you'll need to put them together later.  Step 3 (Cut and punch): Now use the measure you took before to decide where  you will cut the belt from the side where the buckle was. Put the piece you just cut off on the belt lining up the  edges. Now use the old hole as stencil for the new one.  Step 4 (Reassemble): Put back together the loop, buckle and screw.  Et voilà!
I CAN RELATE TO ALL OF THESE
I have the same problems
Maybe stop calling people N*gger lovers and eat a home cooked meal from someone's aunt house and you pick up some weight
Kinda lanky looking honestly. You seem pretty tall too.
worst one is “you’re so lucky you’re skinny”
Same lol
That was awkward to watch that
Brooo my friend is the same way! I ask her if she eats a lot and she says yes and I’m like..😶😐oof
I’ve been skinny all my life and I have been asked at least 20 times if I have anorexia.
It is not just you but my feet are big then my new shoes 👞
You not being able to dance isn't a skinny thing it's a white girl thing
My top pick for worst skinny problem is  the simple fact that it takes so much more work to put on muscle 😭
Sooo that's why I'm very cold
I make this comment a lot when I threaten skinny people that bully me "ya know less fat means easier bone breaking" it true tho
Big facts lmfao 😂
The dance at the end was funny
The punching holes in the belt hit close to home lol
Brooo try being fat lmao
Lucky I love the cold
I was similar until all my childhood eating habits caught up and now I am on the opposite end of the spectrum
Can confirm
Still healthier than the average American
Damnit Jayus, I thought I was light until I saw 66 lbs. I clock at 85
The ending tho
The do you eat one really hit home
Me: overweight
I am skinny af, but I never get cold. Today it was about 6°C and I walked around in a T-Shirt. Idk WHYYYYYY 😭 I just can't really feel the cold ಥ‿ಥ
Going from obese to having skinny people issues definitely takes some getting used to (especially being cold all the time and my ass hurting from sitting)
wym, you can dance amazingly, please teach me those epic moves
I bet your a good f..........
Skinny people r better im short
I'm skinny to and Yea all true
I have the same problem. no matter what I ear I don't get any fatter and the fat b Ards say arn't you having breakfast it's the most inportant meal of the day just before they drive to macdonalds. calling to greggs on the way then. complain of  heartburn the rest of the day!
You can buy the proper size belt?
Som guy call u skinny they callcenter me fat
Don't forget the skinny shaming some people like to do because apparently that's ok in a lot of society
Bro I'm 6 foot 2 and I've been skinny my while life I can 100% relate
Trust me, the opposite problem (being too heavy) isn't better. Unless of course you are in a snow storm, in which case those extra pounds are quite handy. But yeah, I think everyone is unhappy with their body.  You look great. There is nothing wrong with your physique. But if you really want to gain weight, I recommend a physical job and protein shakes. I have a buddy who's real skinny, and it worked pretty well for him.
Shit that what I look like skinny
HONESTLY, this is shit I struggle with all the time. I'm pretty skinny just naturally, but I have trouble with eating enough food so I'm like, MEGA SKINNY.  Sitting, especially on hard seats, hurts like hell. I'm also super tall so clothes are either too short and/or too big. I'll be damn lucky to find clothes that fit comfortably. Being skinny makes it feel awkward and weird to move around, hence the inability to dance. Personally, I haven't had any issues with getting too cold.  And this is a thing that people are super quick to shut down or get mad at you for because of body image issues. We have this idea of the "ideal" body, which is generally being thin, slim, skinny, etc. And maybe I take the fact that I am slim for granted, but because of that, the issues and annoyances start to shine through. And just because I'm skinny, that doesn't mean I don't have body image issues. I feel like I'm too skinny. I feel like I'm fragile and weak, and I wish I had a bit more fat or muscle on me.  Sorry for that full blown rant, this just really resonated with me 😅  TL;DR  Being skinny also has it's downsides, and I can relate with that.👌
She says she cant dance but yet she is 100000000000000000000X way better than me
Idk what you’re talking ab those are some fire moves
I agree
I can relate to all of these no matter how much I eat I can’t even put on weight 🕳🏃🏾‍♀️
Can't dance as you start breakdancing
My brothers always call me fat when they are super skinny so i might tell them something like this🌝👍
I enjoyed the dancing.
If you can't dance it means you have no rhythm. Just listen to the beat and you'll learn
If you buy a belt that is too long don't poke holes into it. Unless you have the right tool your new holes won't look nice.  The right way to fit a belt is to cut the end with the belt buckle. Before you cut put on the belt and pull it until it reaches the desidered tightness. At this point make a sign (on the inside) where the tongue would go as you would do if you were make a hole. Now measure the distance between your sign and the central hole (usually there are three holes).On the inside of the belt there should be a screw. Unscrew it and cut a length equal to your previous measurement. Using the piece of belt you just cut as a reference make a new hole (don't worry if the new hole isn't perfect because it won't be visible from the outside) and simply screw back the belt buckle on the belt.
Yesss gurrll yesss 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I only weigh like 105
Probably a skeleton im 17 and damn im so freaking skinny ppl think that i dont eat nothing but in real thing i eat 4 burgers for dinner Alone. And it does not help me at All.
I have all these problems
I'm skinny and this is darn true 😭
SHE GAT SHOES ON UNACCEPTABLE
EVEN I WEIGHT MORE THEN YOU AND IM YOUNGER BUT HOW
The can't dancing thing not one white person can dance. White people cannot dance for real.
This is true for me while sitting, this is why my back looks like a half cut potato
Yep *skinny person struggles*
I CAN RELATE SO BAD
#relatable
As a plump person, allow me to say... I can't dance either. Unless you count jiggling my belly and thighs dancing
I went from fat to thin as fuck (90kg to 70kg) and this is true asf
I relate to this on a spiritual level. For me society is the worst, I used to be a little confident when it came to my body, all the comments they make just imprinted in my brain and I started saying it to myself. Keep ur comments urself ffs.
People really be starving themselves to be skinny, u don't see people trying to be fat being fat is worse lol
Me too lol im skinny
I have the same problem being skinny except for the clothes. I love oversized hoodies and sweaters. The only pants I have are skintight pants and I eat a lot and don't gain weight! What kind of symptoms are these that keep you skinny? 😐
That's normal for kid who weighs more than his grandfather that's me
I've spent my entire life feeling like I'm freezing while people around me say "it's not even cold." Like I'm sorry I have nothing there to protect me from the temperature!
The thing is, i am skiny as fck too and i honetsly want to gain some weight. But for some strange fking reason even if i eat 2 King size meals filled with pommes, 2 XXL Whoopers and 1,5 liter Fuze tea and dont do sports like at all, it just takes one big dump and im back at my 57kg weight again
i don't know if that last one i because of your weight
My belt never fits lol but im not necessarily skinny i just have a thin waist. Not as cool as you think my belt NEVER fits and even if I poke holes like there is a HUGE STRIP of left over belt 😢 not the best.
Im sorry i laughed
Feelin it too much
Being fat is worse than being skinny
I can relate with each and every thing
Bro I paused at the beach pic
Did you just use society as an issue Welcome to the club
You can’t dance because you’re white boo 😂😂😂 that has nothing to do with being skinny 😂💯
Boo hoo
So relatable
Don't worry about it.  Once you got 40+ either you continue being skinny or you'll start to shrink and bloat.
Bruh thank you for making this I have the same problem high metabolism and I’m still not sure what to do about my body to improve it
"I can't dance!" *Seizures*
But it honestly have some advantages like waking up is easy and in summer you won't heat fast
Ok danceing is just her own im just as skinny have been my whole life and my lanky long ass arms make dancing amazingly   Just look at a octopus and say it cant dance
Lol I can relate
You straight up talk and look like just another one of the drinking buddies that's like let's get cross faded. And Noone disagrees
This guy swears too much
Yeah everything is true people think I have a eating disorder when I clearly don't I love food
Lol that can’t dance thing isn’t a skinny problem it’s all of us as white people problem
U sure u got some nice moves 😂
This is so true plus saddle of bike hurts your bum so much that you don't wanna cycle ever again. I have a reasonable weight now (60kg) however I still feel cold so fucking fast.
Oh so that’s why I can’t dance.
True I’m very skinny that’s why I know
THIS IS SO TRUE , I EAT ALOT BUT I am  ALWAYS skINYYY
Why tf did she say she got to a healthy weight and then put only one foot on the scale. The thing literally only said 60 pounds.
HUMANS HAVE ASS BONES???
You missed a few points
Jeez i can relate soo fricking much
Cute
My dad left us when I was born, and I got to see him the first time at 12 years old or something, and he kept touching my shoulders (NOT in a weird way) and saying "You should eat more! You're so boney" and then adding more food to my plate-
I’m pretty sure the can’t dance part is just the normal white people problem
OMG I deal with all these problems.....      And I thought I was fat.
Don't worry, the last one of not being able to dance, that's pretty much Universal with a lot of people. I mean I'm a fairly healthy weight going on fat but, I can't dance for shit
For me, it is very relatable
The only issue I have with video is she said GD!!!! Why
Same
U ungrateful fucker 😂😂jk. Im skinny too and I totally relate to the problems but there are so many positives as well like being super fast at mobility and bever having having to worry about diets that involves eating very low amount of calories.
Gaddamn u too damn loud for someone who used racial slurs
the comment i get most is eat more which did work so i guess the were right
Im the fastest person I know and and all of those I can relate to
My metabolism makes it so if I drink i get sober faster than i get intoxicated XD i have to drink quite a bit to get really drunk.... And i don't think I'll do that XD
It took me till 31 to get to a size and weight I actually liked, being skinny. Cry to your therapist.
This just made her more attractive. Especially the dance moves
Skinny, tall, I have to say that Ive honestly  think that you are attractive and always have.
Jayus got sum moves to be honest .
I love em skinny
Please please boycott onlyjayus. She's a racist homophobe who literally got caught calling people n***** lovers and issued a fake weak as apology that wasn't even sincere or real wake up people
I always had to deal with comments like that for a long time mainly “you should eat something or ur going to disappear” that was the most common one. I have been doing exercise recently and also got to a healthier weight after being underweight for basically my entire life.
This is me now at school :(
Hey sunshine I weigh 174 lb I'm 5'9 which means I'm shorter than you which means I'm heavier than you and my ass still hurts when I sit down because there's nothing there I have the world's bonus but I swear to God I will switch with you you can have my body type and I'll take yours because you know what I would rather deal with that then all the extra weight that I cannot get rid of and the clothes that don't fit me anymore and the depression that comes along with weight gain and the low energy that comes along with it but I'm also 34 years old so that might be another reason why I gain some weights hormones changing every 7 years and apparently 30 years was the seventh Year my body decided to say hey let's slow down the metabolism let's make it harder for her to lose weight
I had a supervisor at an old job tell me if I didn’t gain weight she was going to fire me because I “look like I have a ED” and “we don’t promote that here”.   No I didn’t get fired, but she did 👍 although I did cry about it for weeks while trying to gain weight but I couldn’t. She also threatened to call CPS on me because I couldn’t possibly be caring for my kids if I have an ED myself. One, I don’t have an ED, it’s just my metabolism. And two, the best thing I ever did was saying something to HER boss. I didn’t try to get her in trouble I said something because I really couldn’t afford to lose my job and I was scared. Thankfully the conversation went the opposite way 😊
She's like the girl version of Pete Davidson.
You've also been racist and homophobic your whole life but apparently nobody cares like I keep saying. You gave this s***** fake ass apology acting like you were crying I've never seen a worse performance with fake tears and everybody was just like all right whatever that's fine. No it's not fine you're a racist homophobic piece of s*** and you've gone from giving cool life hacks to giving illegal life hacks I wish you would just go away can't you go away? You got your core followers but outside of that nobody wants you around on the internet no more
Thing is i eat a fucking lot. But im still skinny and underweight
After watching 150K video, this is the most relatable thing I've seen
I have the problems to
ok but seriously, i can feel my damn bones ALL THE TIME 😐 they hurt
I really hate people. I've been super skinny because I have a very fast calories into energy system (no idea what it's called in English) and because of some information processing reasons I tended to not eat as much as I should when not reminded to eat. People kept saying wow you're super skinny like a twig, I bet you're going to be a model one day. Then I started eating normal amount of calories (I was working on balancing my vitamins and stuff but I had a better diet) so naturally I gained weight. And people keep commenting on it. I wasn't getting nowhere near overweight, I was barely getting to healthy weight! So thank you dad and other people for my two years now of starving myself getting back to healthy (kinda) and stopping midway and going back. Fuck you people who comment on people's weight
I feel wut u feel
Stop calling me out like that
I love her danceing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did I just see KG being used in America??? Wow you guys are finally entering the 21st century
I feel you
FELTTTT
I like your videos. But the language is so unbecoming!!
what sucks more is if youre tall and skinny, its hard to find pants thats long enough and fits ur waist. Sometimes, when it fits my waist, its too short. When its long enough, its too loose around the waist.
Lol love that the last is a joke. I'm skinny and I can dance. (This coming from the biggest kluz ever lol its possible)
I think you look great 😘😘😘
Still cancelled
GenZ  are so spoild, they make up shit to be mad about. They makeup shit to be offended by. Parents of these kids need to cut their financial benefits off, and make them get jobs
You’re not skinny
Lol same😏😏😂😂😂
I don’t think the dancing is the skinny problem
Bruh I’m fat and still have these problems . Laying down hurts and sitting down on hard ass wood is not comfortable for anyone.
I felt every single sentence you said hit me really hard. It... hurts. Edit: An addition to this: When someone says, do you eat properly? It looks like you don't eat anything...  Messed up thing is that I eat more than anyone in my family and my whole family is fit...
Very relatable
I felt this on a whole new level
You dance better than me 😂
The dance 💃 😂
She’s normal in Europe
I feel ya, all applies
I feel this on too many levels.. I look like a stick bug
Yes this is so true
I am same whit belt
I know right and it makes it even worse when even your family make fun of you too
You cant dance but u look cool, so everything you do is cool :v
I like her, she’s super cool and brash!
This relates to me on a spiritual level
I'm under wait
But your still very Beautiful
The ass thing ya it's hurt when I sit on a wooden chair
"I can't dance" *dances*  me: nice dance moves.
Reddit.....
You can dance better than me
Seethe, mald, cope
RIGHT IM SAME LIKE MY MOM SAYS IT SOME THIN I SAY EAT EVERY DAY SHE SAYS ALL YOU EAT IS BRUGERS AND IS MAKING ME NOT THIN BUT DOUSNT WORK LIKE WTF
I feel the same😅
As a skinny teen. That shit dose hurt. And yes, it is fucked up.
Same
You sound like reee kid
I honestly feel the same, being skinny is just torture, especially those with terrible hypothermia
Yyyyyyy😂😂😂😂😂meeee fffff
Oh I just thought I was weird...        I'm still weird but not for those reasons
Ok so I have pretty good resistance against the cold, now I know why, I'm a bit thicc
Yeah no body can truely feel my pain cause unlike the rest of my family who is either at a healthy weight or above I just barely managed to get to a healthy weight for my size and they never get how im either overheating or freezing at any given moment because my body just cant regulate heat well like I have to wear a blanket and have my fan on otherwise I either freeze or overheat and if I dont have a blanket or my fan on I still overheat or freeze up
As a skinny person these are 100% true lmao
Stop shouting bich😑
Intelligent choice of words
I understand body image issues as someone  with popie forearms. But now I feel like my issues is nothing compared to you since you have actual life effecting things. Me I only can't reach my arms in tight spots and my arms block my mirror on my bike and when I wear a long sleeve shirt they feel tight and when I make cosplay's I need to make stuff that would normally be used for legs so instead of getting a 4 inch dianimer PVC I need to get a 7-9 inch diameter PVC
I hate when people assume that im poor and I don’t eat because im skinny  They don’t realize that i eat more than some of them
5’7” 100ibs these are true it’s also easier to pull muscles and anything hits you it’s just bone
Finally someone who has the same problem
I’m 5’5 (still growing) but I weigh 80ish pounds (idk exactly because a lot of the time when I weigh myself it’s in the middle of the day so I’ve eaten which adds weight)  The cold thing isn’t very relatable, I mean sometimes I can get cold very easily in other times it can be 50°F outside and I’ll walk out wearing shorts and a T-shirt.    Also something you forgot was that some days you will barely eat or can go the whole day without Eating anything but not feel hungry at all, but then on the other hand some days you can be a WHOLE FUCKING BOTTOMLESS PIT like WTF BRO!
The one thing she mentioned when you're skinny you do get cold it doesn't feel great
I am 15 kgs underweight and i have the same issues...
We go to appreciate her dance moves
Walking barefoot hurts and I'm an adult but got no tits at all. And the comments from my mom are the most annoying thing.
I think the dance part is that you just White
I'm 6'3. Absolutely everything you said is 100% true for us. I weigh 146 lbs and I've felt healthy for all my life but the comments asking if my parents feed me or being told to eat a sandwich got old real fast. Also I now use a belt that has a friction clip instead of the hole and pin belts. Works well. Also will u date me?😂
Relatable
Story of my life😩😩😩
imma be honest, the dancing is just on you lmao skinny people are able to dance easier
Hey picture number 3 reminds me of a meme yknow... The one where they're shaking hands? Any clue just THINK
Yes! This! It's so rarely talked about!
Yeah the belt thing drives me mad
Then you get made fun of for being bigger than the average kid
I have these problems but my family always complained to me how weak I was as a dude and made me literally experience pain for hours making me pain resistant in certain areas so I can lay on my stomach without problems and sit for really long but eventually my bones hurt but only in the ass idk why and also I can fall and get cuts a lot without feeling it and stand back up
I felt the pants and the cold ones so much
Ohh my god this is so relateble... Well not the dance part. BUT YEAH ITS SO ANNOYING IM LITERALLY LIKE 30 KG WHULE PPL MY AGE ARE MOSTLY LIKE AT LEAST 40
Can you explain why where that skinny? My best guess about how to get more weight is eating much food and working out.
I have to add belt holes all the time! But, to the other end of the belt 😅😅
Yet a skinny girl can get all the 🍆 she wants when ever she wants. Quit complaining. You could’ve been fat and no 🍆 for you…..
Being a chubby person isnt the best either heck you cant be either skinny or chubby society judges everything
I feel you I swear
I can't wear braclets unless they're adjustable because my wrists are so frikin tiny.
As a skinny person i can say i dance decently Maybe sacrificing my lungs for a quick moment but no biggie
It's not that skinny people can't dance but it just looks SOOOO awkward specially if you're tall
why are you standing on the sink?
My family tends to go far away (minimum of 4 hours drive) for holidays, and everyone else in the car is fine, but i end up sitting on my hands because of how bony my butt is
Ik this prodlem becase i have ben rilly skinny i hit a goot wait this year too
Lol the dancing is a just you problem lol I got a cousin who's a skinny like that but can bust a move lol
Watches and bracelets always gotta be resized to fit too🤦‍♂️
if any ksi fans are here  GET HYPER  if u know u know
You can still have sex without breaking into half right?
Belts also don’t fit cos they just squeeze your hip bones and still don’t hold your pants up
I'm skinny and I can dance like Michael Jackson
You not being able to dance has nothing with you being skinny lol
Bro im skinny too this is fax
I felt this
You're a disingenuous attention seeker, who cares what you look like.
Me too
bruh i have every single of these
I feel it bruh
I don’t think the not being able to dance is a skinny problem, I’ve gotten much better since I was smaller, but I can dance, just not at a disco
Im skinny but I can dance really really well.
Illest fucking moves tho! 😎👏🏼
I'm also a slender person everyone of these hits!
I can relate sm
You sooooo beautiful
YES!! Finally an explanation for others
Accurate  -skinny person
Not being able to dance has nothing to do with your weight. Great way to add that in I guess
I waigh 28 kg
Still better than being fat.
Ok even if you were like not being told you can't dance, like yea I'm a competitive dancer and you can't dance that good lol
Imagine you think this b is entertaining
Aye I rather be skinny than not.....I been at both ends of it In middle school I was 5,7 pushing 250 I wasn't terribly overweight but you could tell I like to eat but in 9th grade I shot up 6 inches and lost 75 lbs of it
The stick can dance tho
Jayus: "I can't dance" Me: thats a you problem (Im chubby and i can't dance)
wtf that's true for me
This is me ;-;
4 is like me.. LIKE My clothes are too big for me.. ( size 10 ) but size 6-7 is too small.. and we don't do size 9.. 😭🤚
I felt absolutely all of these problems
Ever since I've lost a bunch of weight, I definitely feel colder a lot easier.
Ectomorph life. Still get the "eat a burger" eat more bs from co workers and then they talk shit when I take creatine and whey to build muscle
Yeah im skinny too but its my body type and it kinda hurts me mentally when people said those but your videos make me better!
YEP!
I'm a boy and I can relate    Except for the being cold real quick
As in your previous video you said every body lies lol I disagree those are my go 2 moves lol
This is so true
You remind me of a female version of Colby Brock 😭😂
Bro I have to agree I mean it’s so true
Me chubby: belts fit well  Me skinny: belts has lost its purpose, I can't even poke holes in them why bother. . . *cries*
The last one is just a white person thing lol.
Skinny people reply to my comment-
At least people who r skinny r skinny cause there r a lot of people out their who are not and actually do no t like themselves and what they look like no hate just king regards to those people ❤️🥰😕🥺
meanwhile me: severely overweight
I've seen worse at the club, you'll be fine. Let the music replenish your soul like the rest of us
This was my problem for the first 12 years if my life. I was just some 4’8 72 pound 5th grader
I am a hella skinny person but i am da best dancer honestly
Honestly the most relatable thing on the internet
Dem moves 😍
Try being fat like me. Oh your pants keep falling down because your love handles are wider than you waist? Just wear a belt. Oh your belt buckle is digging into the underside of your gut? Just tuck your shirt in. Oh tucking your shirt in just makes you look fatter? Just lose weight. Not to mention I have TO MUCH insulation and I'm always hot so I can't cuddle with my girlfriend without sweating my ass of and soaking the both of us. And for anybody saying just lose weight, I have a thyroid issue so losing weight is very difficult. I wish I was skinny
I love it how she does not care about what others reactions would be, btw I have the same problems lol.
I used to be pretty big until I got older and taller and stretched out. Now I'm pretty skinny and always cold lmao. At least I've still got some good glutes
sameee
You can dance better than me
If I hear another person say “put some meat on those bones” to me one more god damn I’m gonna snap like the twig I am
Try being overweight and you would hate it much more. You literally can’t be cold, people bully you constantly, you can’t dance because if you do people will think you look dumb no matter what, sitting down for too long ruins your tailbone, you can’t find clothes that fit you and you have to buy belts that are massive, walking around hurts like everything in your body, and one of the worst things is people telling you that all you have to do is not eat. People could go a week without eating and still be 300 pounds. I understand that there are problems with being skinny because nobody is perfect but making this video was just stupid. Also you said the n word hehehehehehehehehe
This shit had me literally dying I can’t breathe this is fucking hilarious😂😂😂
Yes the skinny comments I get are annoying as hell "Why don't you eat anything?" Me being the most unhealthy junk food loving person alive : 😐
Pls do a video of how to become 🤔😏😛😛😛🤗 fat
As a very f0cking skinny kid, this is true and relatable.
Me and you same girl
Don't think the can't dance is a skinny thing
You can't dance might be a everyone problem
I had the opposite societal problems as some people would be really jealous of me being unable to gain weight no matter how much I ate. What they didn't know was... everything else and the fact that I was way underweight for a long time! :')
Im 12 and i always think im fat but people say im too skinny. Im 25kg and my height is 155cm. Im fat right?  When i was 5 years old... Me: can i participated in this running competition? Please... Teacher: no! You too skinny, im scared you will broke your bone while you running.  Me: what...in the world Then i was 10 years old.... Go to my cousin house Mom: okay lets go home😊 Me: ok Mom: wow today is kinda windy..right(ask me). Ermmmm where are you? My aunt: she's here😂😂(holding me cuz i almost fly) Me: ermmm mom? Can you hold me? I almost flew away.🥺 My family:😂😂😂😂😂
I feel personally attacked /hj
Straight up all the way wit you
So happy to see someone else with this issue lol
"Have bruises on my ribs" 🤣 Hilarious!
I see u survived the wind
Awerage sized and curvy and fat people cant dance either.
I was also skinny pretty much all my life until last year when I also got into a healthy weight, man, my classmates in elementary school always made comments on my weight, but were shocked when I brought out a sandwich bigger than my head, especially when they found out I ate more than them. I just never put on weight.
Ahhh... first world problems.
How did you get the right weight? I'm still on my way there and would appreciate some tips
I don't think the part where you can't dance is it cuz you're skinny also it's fine to be skinny it's fine  to be fat
ya i’m skinny and i get all of those and get bullyed
I felt this in my soul, thank you for this. I thought I was alone
As someone on the other end of the scale, I wanna say that at least you're seen as conventionally attractive
66 lbs at 6’2”? Need some steak and potatoes
@onlyjayus I feel you! I have a really fast  metabolism
I am fat but now dont want to be that skinny
I was skinny as fuck because my adhd meds boosted my metabolism to unnatural levels. After I went off the medication I gained over 50 lbs in less than 6 months
"can't dance" Me sees you "*dancing*":oh uhm. Well this is awkward  My dog literally dancing to the same song
I'm skinny not that skinny but I can totally relate especially for the society one people be like do your parents feed your or no? Like relatable and everything else is relatable lol
Why is it "okay" to make fun of skinny people but it's not okay to make fun of fat people
My skinny problems are when in wearing school trousers that really long I'm quite lanky and the waist is soooo wide so I have to tighten them fully and they always fall down randomly it's so scary
Update: she can dance
I feel you girl
My sisters like you, skinny 21yo and she’s like 2 fckn pounds after a swim:)
Yo come eat at my place for a month you will gain weight. My mom makes too much food and she won’t stop feeding you until you leave the table… only you are trapped because guests always sit against the wall and are blocked in by my mom and dad sitting on the ends. You will be forced to eat until we run out of food or until her novela comes on, either will take about 2 hours.
She's 6 feet plus and 68kg that's low in bmi scale
Girls when they're fat: Omg I hate being fat  Girls when they're skinny: Omg I hate being skinny
This is so true
Im fat but my belt don't fit lmaoo
Last ones a you prob
I'd rather be stick skinny with no booty or tits than over weight. My cousin and I tell my sister, who is skinner than you, this all the time.
I don't eat but once a day and not much and I'm huge. I'd give anything for your issues. Lol
Very true
Im being bullied bc im "too" skinny.
FACTS
M8 I was skinny as fuck right up until I started doing construction work, my first job was digging through about 200 sq/ft of concrete and dirt about 6 feet deep with nothing but jackhammers sledgehammers shovels and 5 gallon buckets, I gained 100 pounds of muscle and it was fucking insane
I cant dance  Me: i couldnt do any better IMAO
I just eat a lot of boiled eggs
Funny how skinny shaming was never frowned upon.
I'm sorry if this is mean or whatever but how are you 66 and I a 14-year-old weigh 150
Same with fat people 😐
Good dance moves
I would trade you for all this in a second.
I'm fat and always cold
I think my cousin and my two friends can relate 😂
Hey Playgirl 👋 why did you use GOD'S NAME IN VAIN? THAT'S NOT COOL!
Yes to all this except the rib bruises for me. I’m 110lb but a DD in the chest. Replace rib bruises with back problems galore lol
😭😭😭😭 IDK- I ASKED MY FRIENDS IF IT HURTS TO SIT ANYWHERE AND THEY SAID NO, APPARENTLY I HAVE A LOW TAIL BONE??? IDK MAN- BUT I'VE GOTTEN SO MANY COMMENTS ABT HOW I LOOK SICK, AS I HAVE REALLY PALE SKIN, AND AM SKINNY. But don't even get me started on the body dysmorphia- ik its not everyone but I sure as heck struggle with it. I know I'm skinny I know, but I'm so afraid of not being how I am. If I gain weight I know I can't loose it. I'll get unhealthy and rot. So I should be skinnier, but no then I'll be more unhealthy. "As long as I eat what I want, but in small doses I'll be fine. Always have been"   Sorry this turned into a vent. I just needed to talk about this.
Tbh i rather be skinny... like I'm chunky as hell, i eat one pizza and my weight goes from 120kg to 123kg... TF IS MY BODY, and i had to go on a diet for almost a year so i can go from 140kg to 120... FML
Yeah how is that fucked up to say to a kid? You are joking and saying they are small
I had this problem my entire life 😆
I'm honestly the opposite. I'm overweight and disgusted by it. I'd rather be skinny. I can't do most shit without feeling disgusting/sluggish and I barely wanna take my shirt off most the time. Everyone says it doesn't matter but I've yet to meet a girl who's actually into me and doesn't care I'm fat. Also my family is stupidly skinny so I look like I'm 600 pounds when I'm in photos with them.
I’m also very skinny so I just work out and the only fat I have is muscle fat
i’ve never related to a video this much 😩😩
Yep you are correct            You cant dance
4th one is easy, just get two thin belts
Being fat is the same but opposite 1. Sitting hurts your back and or hips 2. Laying flat on your stomach and back can make it hard to breathe  3. You always insulated and are hot all the time as well as sweating too 4. Clothes also don’t fit you sometimes have to get stuff special ordered 5. People will talk about how fat you are but indirectly saying shit like you can eat for 5 people  Bonus one is you jiggle from everything. even a little pothole in the road, you know, like jello.  Unfortunately it’s not healthy to be too skinny or too fat. It is equally as hard for both sides for people to gain weight and to lose it. I pray anyone on either side can manage to get to where they want because it’s a struggle that I am so glad I got through.
I relate to this... also doesn't help I'm short as well... highschool always gotten underestimated because of my stature in weight lifting... even though I was lifting more than half my body weight.
I think number 6 is just you
Same
Yeah you dance better then me
You’re not that skinny
Yeah my brother is 6'4 and weighs 140 lbs on a good day. I didn't make fun of him because I'm a girl whose 6ft tall and 190lbs on a bad day so we both getting made fun of. "Oh my god you're SO skinny! You should be a pencil for Halloween" "Oh my god you look like a linebacker are you on the womens football team??"
You can dance you just got to find the rhythm 😍😝❤️🌞 well in your bones exactly lol'..
I feel this all on a personal level
I’m wicked skinny, and it drives me crazy when someone says to me “do you even eat? You’re so skinny!” Like dude stop! You wouldn’t walk up to someone who’s overweight and say to them “Whoa! You need to stop eating so much” it’s so rude!!!
"I can't dance".  *Proceeds to set fire to the dance floor
Fat people don't stay warm you know that is a lie everyone is told I was 18 stone at one point and I was just as freezing as everyone else
Those dance moves really got me 😭
the last one is me Lol
Wait this aren’t things normal people
Squats....... your welcome jayus
Still nothing compared to being fat. Like yeah theres definitely a degree of annoyance but unless its anorexia or obesity both of which I’ve struggled with honestly its nothing
THE BELT ONE IS THE MOST RELIABLE!!!
The one thing that skinny people say that annoys me is..... God..I'm sooooo fat....
My problem is that the clothing industry doesn’t think that skinny people have boobs or hips. I am a small person and my waist is small. But I have natural DD’s on my cheats and hips to match. Let me tell you, almost no one make a 32 DD bra, most affordable clothing lines don’t make clothing that tightens enough at the waist and so even though my torso is a small, I have to by large and extra Large shirt to fit over my chest, even though the hang off of me dramatically. And don’t get me start on finding pants that fit over my hip bones and then sags at my waist. I get told a lot to suck it up, I’m skinny, that there are bigger problems in the world. That true, but I would like to have the majority of my clothing fit me right so that I can have confidence in what I wear and how the world sees me. Without having to spend even more money to go to a trailer to have them get the clothing to fit me for double what I actually paid for the clothes. I mean don’t get me wrong a lot of people have this issue, finding clothing that fits. That doesn’t mean it should just be acceptable. No matter big small or in between. It the 21st century, affordable clothes that can come in different shapes and sizes should be out there for everyone
Remember when she was racist?
I feel you, I am 14 and I am 83lbs, people are always skinny shaming me, but when I call them fat they get all hurt like I just beat them with a stick and I'm the one getting in trouble
Damn, I'm the opposite of skinny. They still apply, but some are the opposite.
Aweee, You’re skinny? 😱
Wait 66 lbs is what you're supposed to be
I-i.....guess  I'm..skinny
That's happened to me and my little sister but my sister was skinny that you can see her chest bone no matter what and how much she eat she is still skinny bruh I mean we eat 6 to 10 times back then eat meat everyday but still skinny 🤣🤣🤣 But now things changed 😃
Same here 🥲
I’m both skinny and short
I’m skinny and I have all these problems. I don’t like it...
I always hate getting comments on how skinny I was
My best friend from high school is super thin. His nickname was Sticks.
I'm gonna cry 😭😭😭😭😭 Everything was so relatable 🙁🙁
Same but my family’s like dude u need to eat 2 months of eat more then I ate before my family now dude ur fat
I know how u feel
I’d rather suffer being skinny than stay fat
Most reliable vid
Yup 👍🏻
Yes, you can dance and it is glorious
As a fat boi.  we have similar problems
I think that last one is just a personal problem
I feel the pain I've been skinny for ever
You for some reason I can never gain any weight and people are so mean to me
my family always makes comments about how skinny i am, they're always saying stuff like "you need to get some meet on those bones" or "do you eat enough" and honestly it makes me feel super uncomfy :(
"I can't dance!" *Proceeds to dance better then me in multiple ways*  Damn alright
Who said that you can't dance?! 🤣
This is all so true
Me, a 16yrold who weighs 250 lbs: Dude you don’t want this is sucks so much
Very tall guy here, and... "Basketball?" "Do you play sports?" "Do you play basketball?" "You should play basketball." "You're probably pretty good way basketball, huh?"  And all the others. How's the weather, is the air thinner, etc., etc., etc.  Also, yeah the can't dance thing is definitely true.
Well… would u rather be fat? Like me? I didnt think so huh
She can dance better than I can.
In my blanket I am freezing even when I am in my blanket
I’m skinny like 12/100 skinny (being the 12 skinniest out of 100) and ummm I can’t stand yo straight for an hour with my bones deciding to sleep and chairs are not merciful
Lol
My baby sister and I mean she is 9 months  her hands can fit around my rist
i really skinny to i have these problems
Im not as tall as you but just over 5'11. Of course I hit that height at 14 but I was always taller than most. One day when I was like 7 or 8 a relative over for dinner suggested to my grandmother that I must be anorexic. Just because I was skinny. The look on my grans face and the idea she took it seriously made me feel I had to finish all my food all the time but I literally couldnt so I started hiding food to make it seem like I ate it all. My mom started finding some pretty gross stashes in my room. A lot of worry for nothing.

Notice how skinny people can eat a lot but never put on the weight
This happens to me so often even the dance part but her we can fit in small spot so that good I guess
im skinny… T0T
Bro it is like that for me except for the cold one
🤣🤣 those are some epic dance moves
I mean u can dance, u're just... you know... stiff
Worst 'insult' I ever got as a skinny person: a girl come sup to me and goes "oh my GOD you are SO skinny" and this point it's happened so much that I just considered it a compliment cause most people want to be skinny. And don't get me wrong I think I got on the lucky side of skinny I don't looks frail or sick. I'm just skinny. So I just sheepishly smiled and she follows it up with this question "how many guys you've slept with with a body like that you whore" and was literally awe struck my jaw dropped and everything. She literally assumed my sexual status based off of nothing but my body
As a person who has been body shamed ever since i was 9 for bieng skinny, all of this is infact TRUE.
Pretty sure the last one can be fixed
66, healthy?
Same
4 WORDS: RANDOM FUCKING ELBOW PAINS
I hate this because I'm a healthy weight but I get made fun of for being really skinny, it's because I do track also I can dace really well
Never had any of those problems (btw) I'm skinnyer then you
Omg yes I'm glad I'm not the only one who randomly says "I'm cold" when I'm in the blanket fully
I feel that pain
That is why I get the braided belts
I was always told, “your like a squirrel” “your so skinny” “Your not gonna get tall, you don’t eat enough” it’s really hard and people don’t understand what’s it’s like there both body shamming.
My ass always hurts for sitting 7 hours listening to a teacher... Skinny life tough
All this happens to me
Who else doesn’t comment because they can’t relate
Your not skinny the world is fat.. I live in Africa and they think I'm big because I weight 160# 😂😂 in America I am called skinny.. don't think Africa don't eat.. they eat big wake but healthy food.. plus they physically work not sit in an office all day..
This is me for sure and I get Judged all the time for it I’m 14 and 71 pounds
I literally laughed out loud when you said the belt thing, and then added that you had to add extra holes to it, because that’s literally every belt that I’ve ever owned
Them dance moves
The dance thing is that you're white. I was a skinny child and when I gained weight as an adult I still can't  dance.
Yeeeeeesssssss
I relate to this way too much
As a fellow skinny person, being cold is definitely my number one complaint
Its so annoying!!! Im 14 and 5'5 and my jeans are a CHILDRENS 10 1/2 and too big in the waist but too long in the legs!!! WTF am i meant to do?????
I think the dancing is more on your rhythm
I would like to add one: Can't lay down comfortably on any hard surface 😭😭😭
Me too sis me too
The last one because you have WPS iykyk
People who say things like do you eat are fat 😐
I’ve never related to something so much felt this on a molecular spiritual level
I’ve been very cold but I can’t dance either
Yupyupyup
I am 13 and weigh 70 lbs.  I can relate SO MUCH
Honestly so relatable even had to go a whole year in 4th grade with this classmate calling me "skinny fry" all the time  but now its better bc i got real friends :)
Fast metabolism
As a skinny person, 1 is fake, I think you should just get a new chair. 5 is only fake if you don’t include family
I'm skinny and this is so true 😭😭😭😭😹
That's how I dance :)
Jayus another fellow skinny person, and another problem is that you can literally suck in and count your ribs
As a skinny person I can relate
I mean the dance moves were solid
Tysm for bringing this up as a skinny person
Wearing high waisted pants makes you lose your curves...  (Another struggle if it's a struggle)
I will never forget the day that I was walking across the street in downtown Seattle and a lady threw french fries at me telling me I needed to eat
One day at the aquarium we were on the dock outside and it was windy, I’m small and skinny so as a smaller sized child I would be pushed around by the wind and I would go with the flow so not only was getting closer to the edge of the dock there were a folk birds trying to kidnapped me. When my mom told this story again she said to “apart of the crew apart of the ship” 🤣🤣🤣
Fat ppl can dance ik bc I am fat and can’t dance ):
Im skinny asf. I still wear the same belt I wore when I was 12 and Im 23 now lmao. I still have the holes poked in it.
AS A SKINNY MALE PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE TO LEAN ON MY SHOULDER BECAUSE IT STABS THEM AND IT HURTS MY FEELINGS
Skinny people just hard to be fat
Ur cute doe
You have stated everything about me 😂
Ik how that feels
I FEEL THIS
The problem that u can’t dance is just a lack of skill
at least u can dance better than i can 👌🏻
I feel personally attacked
Yesss you understand me
As a fellow skinny person 56-60 lbs. in 7 and 8th grade, I can confirm that skinny people don’t know how to dance
LEGIT RELATE TO ALL THIS SHIT
Story of my life
I can relate to this
Bro on god😂
“can’t dance” *proceeds to do a top notch dance*
HELP THEY’RE POSSESSED IDK WHAT THE DEMON INSIDE OF YOU WAS DOING AT THE END BUT IT LOOKES LIKE IT WAS TRYING TO GET OUT BUT DIDNT KNOW HOW
God I am so glad that this is just skinny people things and not just me.
Sick dance my guy
She's pretty tall looking
Why is this so true
I can just see my rib cage and my heartbeat normally. I’m also only 70 pounds at 13.
I'm  skinny as fuck I'm only 13 but my whight is the same as a 9 year old
Me 💀
Why is it that I am fat yet my ass still hurts when I sit?
im skinny and i am horrible at dancing i was also so skinny
But very beautiful
I can relate to all of these ;-;
So true I've been very skinny my whole life and constantly get asked do you not eat
And a horrible combination with being skinny is having a fast as fuck metabolism, so no matter how much you eat, you stay pretty much the same.
Yoooooo same brooooo
Ah yes 5"10 and i weigh 55.5kg Male i know how it feels
I agree so much with number five. I mean like it’s not as easy as just eat more. It’s not like I’m trying to starve myself or something. It’s not lucky, also that last point lol.
Being a skinny person I can say all these are correct
Them's some moves alright
Wish I was naturally skinny, I’ve just looked like a potato for 15 years 😔
Relatable, I always have a blanket with me.
Jayus : 66 pounds  Me: 11 years old 173 lbs  Also me : 👀
Your 66 pounds
U know my friends at lunch give me there food and tell me to eat it cuz I never eat-
Im American so I can’t relate
This is all true 😔
Bull, that's dancing if I've ever seen it. I weigh 200 pounds and I'm 6' 2" and I can't dance because I'm incredibly inflexible. Also my back hurts. So if you can do that, you are 100% able to dance.
omg totally felt the belt one😩 my waist is 27/28 inches, any belts i find are 32+ inches so i always have to poke new holes into them😔
The dancing has nun to do with being skinny 😂
didn't you say some racist ass bullshit like a year ago why do u keep showing up in my recs
THE BELT HOLES— I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST ME
The pants and belt deal I really feel that one 🤣🤣
i can relate so much 😭🤣
I hear you, everyone gets mad about fat shaming but I’m a 6’ 2” 160lb male and I am certainly tired of hearing people ask me if I’m riding a chicken.
Not to be rude but I can't tell if ur a boy or girl
I used to be skinny, and I agree with you on everything except the dancing part. Now that I'm a thicc dude, it's harder to move quickly and jump around to the beat, but as a skinny guy I would glide across the floor like a disco god
What do ya mean their moves are better than mine :,)
The weight reads 66 pounds. You're getting up to weight. I'm a 17 year old dude who somehow weighs 198 pounds but I'm not fat at all. I guess I have a lot of muscle or something? I don't know
that “you need to eat a burger get some meat on your bones” shit gets so annoying
Yea true my sister said she would die to have a body like mine but I tried to be a little fatter but won’t work I ate fast food like for weeks I did gain a little weight but I mommy body still looks the same..
The only dance we can do is shuffle lmao
I have a metabolism like a train so I can relate 100% to this lol it doesn't help that I eat pounds of food yet I am still a toothpick
“Aw are your pants falling down, your clothes dont fit? Just wear a belt. Oh your belt doesn’t fit? Oh you gotta poke new holes into it.” And I took that personally 😂🥲
I can't relate but it really seems upsetting.
It’s insane.  If she was over weight she’d get picked on too.  If she was perfect weight she’d get dragged thru the mud by the other pretty girls.  This society sucks
Well, lucky you (At least, considering where I'm from)! My cheeks are just a *little* chubby and I'm labeled as the TOBUNGUS HUMOLODUNGUS of the entire class... for *SIX YEARS!* I probably don't play any sports, SO WHAT?!  SAY WHAT YOU WANT, BUT IF YOU COME NEAR ME WHILE I SHOVEL FOOD DOWN MY THROA TO TELL ME THAT I'M "OVEREATING", I WILL KILL YOU WITHOUT HESITATION! Assholes...  Anyway, you're perfect just the way you are...
Ikr I am 13 and I am so freaking skinny I don’t even weigh 100 pounds yet and I am a boy and not only than but I am so short but I hate when people make comments on how I am so skinny and how they are scared that I might need to go to the hospital and how I am so picky and how I don’t have any meat on my bones and I really hate that most pants are like so big for me like I love sweatpants cause they are comfy and most of them are like just perfect for how skinny I am!
My brother is hecka small for his age and he’s always cold
the belt thing is so true
I relate to EVERY SINGLE ONE
Well everything u said is the opposite for me
I think the dance part  is just a talent thing (i can't dance either and i don't don't think I'm that skinny )
You can dance
Yeah im skinny too I'm 20-40 pounds underweight for my height apparently, and I don't feel skinny but my ribs are literally showing
Omg! I am also gaining weight and having a normal weight for the first time in my life.   First of all, it is prett, funny that I can stand the cold way more now and my cousine, who was never cold, is now loosong weight and getting cold.  Also, it is pretty true that you can't dance when being skinny your whole life, it sounds weird, but I feel so much more groovier with a little bit more body weight.
Forget skinny problems I just wanna know what that jumpshot form is 😭
Same
Not being able to dancing is not a Skin person issue.
Yep that me
Bro I can dance that good 😂
I have that same problem but really hurt my feelings is when my mom would say go eat a big Mac you need to eat more  look so skinny you look sick
I hate how you hit every point especially when your tall
The belt one hit wayyy to close to home
I’m also skinny
True for me to
This is sooo true
I remember coppin my first gucci belt.  That shit was wayyyy too big had to punch like an extra 3 holes in that shit
The end- 😭🤣
And 3, 4, 5, and 6 are the ones that I relate to the most  My mom calls me a stick 🤣
Ive also been really skinny my whole life like when i was . . lets say . . . 11 . . . . i weight like 37kg
Shut up, jfc. I was going to write out what this ignoramus needs to read but I don't have the energy with this shit anymore.
You haven't been skinny, you've been a man in your entire god damn f##king life
I cannot express how many times someone just said to me "eat more"
This is actually true- I’m skinny af.
I think you’re beautiful
Dude lol my sister is the same except she’s a ballerina 🩰 so she has muscles but still so so thin. Never passes 98lb even now tht she’s not rlly dancing anymore and is about to be 27 and she like eats everything too meanwhile I eat a donut and I gain like 5lb 🥲🥲
Bro, why are you on the sink?
67 pounds is healthy? That just doesn't sit well with me. But hey if your happy good on you.
I used to be skinny now I’m 200
Epic dances move!
Michael Jackson was skinny asf and he could dance
This dude Hahahah Hahah THIS DUDE HAHAHAHAHAHAH AT THE END HAHAHAHA THE WAY HE DANCES HAHA
I got all those problems except 5
I have heard all of these but the belt I did not know about
I got all those problems to. Fast metabolism isn’t all that great
Yea, so I decided to get a few pounds on me a few years ago, because of this. Now everyone calls me fat and that I should loose weight again. Wtf
You think your skinny a girl across my apartment legs are sized as my wrist
I get this, it sucks
I've had this my whole life 5'9 90kg and I'm 29 😞.... I eat enough tbh but work in a very active job and that's just how it is 🤷🏻‍♂️
The last part def hits.
I fucking get it
I can actually relate to all these cuz I'm very skinny too and I've been very underweight for a really long time a lot of my girls at my school are like over 100 lb and then I'm just sitting here at exactly 100 lb
jayus bad ina bikini
You dance just fine.
This is so true
I feel this I'm 13 and 89lbs
Totally relatable lol
Me
I'm pretty sure I'm overweight and I get cold so fast and so easily.
Ya dance better than me😗☕
As a skinny person I can relate to all of these
As a twig person I can 💯 relate to this 🥲 no , my back wont snap in the wind *stop asking*
If you need a Jean hack for when your jeans are too big just button it and put 1 or 2 of the closer straps around the button.
Don’t say the lords name in vane
u just described my entire life
Holy shit this hit so hard
Why is this so true ;-;
True, I'm a kid but I'm skinnier than you
Yo I'm sorry to say this but like the dancing problem it doesn't include your weight
I seriously thought this was a dude
Was that pic volleyball?
That’s better dancing then I’ll ever achieve:]
Im skinny and i relate to this
Thats cap my guy 🧢,nun of it is true
I'm cold in like summer in Arizona I swear to GOD 😭🤚
She definitely was that one annoying kid who everyone hated cause she thinks she funny
I relate to every single thing on this video. Society is the worst one. Especially when I was younger smh..
OMG I HAVE THESE PROBLEMS
the wind can push me over
WTF is the average end
I feel seen
Same
Yes yes yes this video is soooo relatable
Im so ligjt that my 6 year old is heavier than me and mi 12
OMG I CAN DEFINITELY AGREE 😩
That last one isn't a skinny problem lol
The dance sent meee Lmfaooooooo
I'm genuinely curious about this. Can you skinny folks out there do the Henry stickman dance? 🤔
I had these problems for 16 years i was a very high metabolism for most my life and it cause me to skinny as hell
Nah being fat is still worse
I can relate so much
I have never related with a video on this level ever in my life.
People also don’t understand that along with getting cold really fast, we get really hot really fast
I felt this way to hard. I'm 6'3" and just hit 140. Tall and Skinny is horrible too
Yo I relate lol
Lost a fuckton of weight and now none of my clothes fit. I can at least relate to that
As a person who is skinny but thicc 😂I understand the ribs plus sitting in a chair that has like a real uncomfortable support for laying back makes my spine uncomfortable and sometimes when sitting down I am somewhere around 120 and 130
Actually you killed the dance portion idk what your talking about
i'd rather be told to go eat a sandwich then get made fun of for being fat and eating a salad
Too be honest I would rather be called skinny than fat but I'm used to people calling me that
Can relate to every single one of these😂🤣
I RELATE MY NICKNAME IS  “The Twig”
im fatt ish and cant dance eather
It’s ok, I got called perish at school 💀
wait how tall are you?
This is my life in 60sec video 😭
Yeah this is all pretty true
I am skinny!!!????? 😀😀😀😀😀😀
Yep, been skinny my entire life as well. Doesnt matter what I eat, I've never been able to gain, even on special nutritionist diets. Telling a skinny person to eat something is exactly like fat shaming someone. So stop.
As a skinny person myself i can agree
Finally somebody who knows the same like me
Its true and im skinny as shit
Worst thing is my ass bones hurting i will never know how fat people feel when they sit.
Yes skinny people problems
If this makes you feel better my dancing is worse
What does dancing have to do with being skinny lol?
The dancing thing is the only thing wrong skinny people can dance
Why is this so true🥲
I think the last on is on u
Tell his your Height
I cringe at when I see skinny people stretch I have a super skinny friend and seeing the shape of his bones sometimes when he stretches makes me cringe alot
All true 😂
I eat my weight in McDonalds and di t gain anything
Growing up I was an absolute twig. There has been times where the doctors called child services on my parents because I weighed 70 lbs through all of school including high school.
Not a problem in many places.
I'm skinny and 6'2 ft but I'm 14 and male
I'm slightly overweight and oh boi do I always get cold for no reason
I prefer skinny women 💯
It’s better than being fat that’s for sure because I would know. The key is metabolism and mine is slower than internet explorer.
Y'know being skinny better than fat cause fat is annoying, I'm fat so yknow shut
Haha try fat people problems
Do you have Marfan syndrome?
Yes, relatable. I eat so much but I don't gain weight super easily, and when I finally do, and tell my friends about it because I am actually happy for myself, they just give me the stare --->🤨 and than say after that "she is trying to flex for being skinny" or "why don't I see any fat" LIKE OH MY GOODDDDDD, GAINING WEIGHT DOES NOT MEAN GETTING FAT.
100%
I think yo dancing is great
Same
Me too🙂
Ya someone said I look like a noodle when I dance
While i was watching this video, my dog died. Rest in Peace little hero.
Those are some class moves
I agree I  am skinny af
The fact you can't dance is probably do to the fact that your white
My pants are too big
I could never Tell your gender until Now. Dont ask how
Omg finally someone talks about it! I have a special knife that I heat to poke holes in the belt 😭
Honestly feelz
I have an abnormal amount of metabolism and it sucks
Thank youuuu every body talks about only over weight peeps but ty
I'd love to swap places with you I wouldn't mont not being fat and no offence the dance thing is your fault just gotta practice
Well... There is a reason why skinny people who can dance wear baggy clothes...
It's always fat insecure mfs who ask if you eat. But in reality you look alot better and is alot healthier.
My life however im a guy so immediately worse
Have my body weight I don't want it
The funny thing is that most of these apply to overweight people as well. Real fun fact there
So happy someone has made a video about issues skinny people have. Its always about bigger people, never skinny. It's always bs. But that dance one?... I'm skinny asf underweight (6.5 stone) but mate I can dance very well. Any typa dance. But what you should of said is ( unless you don't get it) people saying how jealous they are of you and everything I hear that I feel sick. Jealous.?? Of having so many health problems, not having periods, being told you at a young age can't have children, saying your anorexic, even though you love food and say how much you eat it. No energy. Not much strength. Horrible skinny arms ugh makes my elbows so out and ugh
U can dance u r amazing🤩🤩🤩
I know a guy who’s wait is 420 and that was funny
I'm 70 pounds at 11 is that unhealthy?
Skinny people produce more heat.
The struggle is real
Those comments shouldn't be said to kids OR adults. 💯  Those callous comments from bitter people projecting their weight insecurities are the most annoying and hurtful.
So now you more confiusing me! 🤬 Are you an women or an men?!
You still look like a fokin stick tho (in a good way)
I feel this
I went from extremely underweight to overweight😭😭😭😭
And I'm been fat my whole life get over urself
Im a 170 guy, i still have to poke holes in my belts.
Ha Same
@
As a skinny skeleton person, these are all true.
THIS VIDEO IS SO FUCKING RELATABLE THEY SAY I DONT EAT
Facts you can see my rib cage in 4k
FR people say to me all the time especially my friend just like "do you eat?! " or "you need more food! " and stuff especially I get called a stick all the time
your lucky i have been fat all my life it sucks
The last ones just a symptom of being white
Well I’m not skinny but I’m bad at dancing
Wow I’m 11 and I heavier than u and yes I’m female
I used to be so skinny that i could see my own ribs
Samesamesame
I feel this
But... it looks good to be skinny.
Ik this is kinda fucked up but I can't tell if your a boy or girl
Fuking fax tho I'm all ways so goddamn cold
Man why is she actually my favorite person ever😂
And fat people think skinny people don't have problems. But there's a difference in not being able to gain weight and stuffing ur face until u weigh as much as 3 or more people
Cant dance isnt a skinny problem, it's a white person problem
Skinny people   Fat people                         🤝                     Being shamed for their bodies
In my book you can dance. Great dance lmao
EVERYONE LOOKUP "Gematria Effect News 23"!
At least you aren't outrageously tall
1, 2 and 5 are very true
I am so skinny but I eat most out of my family and don't feel cold Help pls
I dont think the last one is relevant
No mee to
That last part probably just you
I’m still skinny these are the problems I have
Those are some pretty epic dance moves tho…
I know this feeling
Shopping for keens is the worst.  You find out real quick they make clothes for larger people only.  Try and find 27x32  men's jeans.
The funny thing is I eat more than all my friends but have a high asf metabolism
These are all true facts
But we aren't overweight, so us being skinny is privileged and we aren't allowed to complain
Yeah, Skinny squad
I'm skinny and tall and finding pants is IMPOSSIBLE if they fit me in lengh they are too loose, and if they fit in lengh they fall off, plus finding belts is near impossible.
Man I wish I had these "problems".
Same everything lol
Of course you can dance OnlyJayus!!! You learned how to twerk remember!!!😁
I am sorry but being skinny is easy.  At least you aren’t part of the gay man community.  Where they block you, ghost you or insult you if you are fat.  I am 25 but I feel like I am back in middle/high school again.  Wow you get cold because you don’t have fat, well I haven’t been on a real date because every man who I talk to blocks me because of my stomach.
As a skinny person, I approve this message.
I can agree
Im skinny as fuck too kid lmfao i do the same shit with the belt😂😂😂😂😂✌🍀🎸
I remember every time I went bowling my mum would sort of make fun about how I couldn't pick up the heavy balls, I was shit at bowling, I don't remember the last time I did it
Same my metabolism is highhhhhh af
I don't think being skinny means you can't dance, you just can't dance in general
If anyone has weight gain tips, let me know lol.   Otherwise I’ma be forced to see a councillor… unfortunately, I don’t process carbs all that well.
Cheers to the skinny ones🍻
I swear
Why tf are u standing on ur counter
im skinny but my ass is too fat to hurt while sitting
Had the same problem. Now I'm 270 pounds. Enjoy skinny, and hope it lasts.
I’m just like you
Yup, it’s true. And the fun thing is i can eat whatever the fuck i want but i keep  the same weight. But i feel like i gotta watch it, cus i weigh less than you do and i’m probably so much taller, not sure though. I’m 1,85 but i mean, i just assume anyone who is not dutch is smaller than me cus most of the time it’s true xD
You can dance.
Im not sure if the last one is related
honey the dancing ain't a skinny people problem, thats a you thing, is what i learned from every skinny girl in my dance classes ever
Nah nah I'm ten years old and I'm as skinny as u
Yo...dats me literally. Their smallest waist pants doesn't fit me.
I love all yr posts star, happy you are a healthy weight now !!!! MORE POSTS PLEASE X
Order
Skinny or not you got an envious height.
i used to be super skinny as a child, then got to the point where i was overweight, then got to a healthy weight. people had something to say about my body at every weight. “you need to gain weight” “you need to lose weight” “have you been eating?” “are you starving yourself?” the only time they never asked me if i was starving myself was when i was overweight and doing just that.
I m very sorry if it sound bad but I always thought you were a male  Sorry 😅
Every single adult when I was between the ages of 4 to 12 commented about how I was so skinny and they were convinced I didn’t eat. (I ate a lot but I played like the top 12 most popular sports in Canada.) Anyways, now I’m 20 and super obsessed with being curvy and will binge eat if my weight enter the BMI range in the 18s. Thanks for really f*cking me!🥰
That is good dancing
You just yelled everything I was thinking
I can relate, and it hurts.
I'm skinny but my waist is huge
That dancing thing is not for all skinny people
Chill with the swearing young man.
I'm pretty sure the inability to dance is just a white person problem
I'm skinny af aswell and doing situps on the ground leaves bruises on my spine
My spine hurts everytime I try to do sit ups without something soft on the floor.
As someone who was skinny my whole life until I had kids. I feel ya girl...
Another thing about sitting down is when you sit up straight and your back is against the chair it hurts your spine.
The belt is me but with watches
How does dancing have to do anything with being skinny I can’t dance either
No offense but i didn't know that you were a girl
Mesh belts are the best, unlimited holes
Brave of you to assume those who aren’t skinny can dance! 🤣
Sounds more like inconveniences than actual issues
My brother's gf Naycee. My God she's so small and scrawny I'm afraid to high-five her cause last time bruised her palm 😂
I fuckin feel this entire thing, it does not help that along with skinny I got the lank gene so buying pants is a fucking nightmare because sometimes the pants fit but they're too short or they're the right length but they fall off
Nah this is cap im an under weight thirteen year old an less then half these are true
I so skinny I ate a full course meal and not a single pound gained        Idk wtf my body doing but it don't want me to chunk up  Also I have a high resistance to the cold idk why I just do even though I look skinny enough to slither my way through a door
I'd do ya..
Fr I feel like it’s more of an effort and more frustrating being super skinny than people think.
I can relate😂 My neighbours always call me spider legs😅 But do you know how skinny Michael jackson was!? He still could dance
Well damn I'm the opposite
Being thin doesn’t make you unable to dance. I know lots of thin people who can move!
This is too true
I’m really skinny too and I have alllll these problems but I’m always really tall
Relatable
Wow I didn't know that ur a girl until I watched it twice
I think the dancing just a you thing
She makes me happy to be fat
Welcome to my world
That's how I feel and people be like how do you eat a lot and be skinny like I don't know
The 👀 who are reading this message may your parents live a long life ❤️
The belt one is so true 🥲
This is do true
My but hurts for sure
Bro I can relate to it all. I was at a school checkup in 4th grade and we got the results of height and weight/body mass and I asked my mom what did I get and she said: “Everything looks fine it’s just that you are very skinny and need to eat more, you barely eat”. I kinda almost started crying cause that hurt me bad.
Bro I'm pretty skinny myself but somehow I just don't get cold that easily.
YESS THIS IS SO TRUE OMG
Her dressing sense is like so GOOD😍
Nah delete that last clip no one else should see that
another reason to not workout and lose weight :)
I know how you feel, my friends call me a stick all the time😞😞
Im 31 and skinny I can eat whatever the hell I want and stil I don't gain weight thats life who cares
I get the same problems
My problems exactly 🥺
I feel you 😂😂😂😂😭😭
Same problems
That’s me like most people my age are above 100 pounds I’m 60 pounds like bruh
So fat ain't the problem anymore? It's skinny people that are the problem now...smh...get over yourself bitch
I don't think the inability to dance is a thin person thing it's more a you thing.
The dancing was something else😅
Literally me I'm also super skinny and I always get asked if I'm anorexic and I'm not
Ew
183 and randomly dropped from my 70kilos down to 63 even tho i didn't change my diet or do more sports... And i totaly feel your problems 😂  Next problem: my 70 kilo jeans throw wrinkles with the belt on it and those wrinkles rub open my hipbones making every single step hurt like shit on my HIPS!?! 😂😂
You're 66lbs?
The belt though lol so true
I have 2 lunches a big dinner and like 3 snacks in between yet im still underweight af, I gained 2 pounds from doing this for a month, what really suck is that I'm 12 and 5'6 and I weigh at 107
I'm a skinny person I experience all of these.
Me, standing up cuz I don't want to sit cuz... : Relatives: "can't you ever sit down, don't you know it's rude to stay stood up"
I'm shubby and sitting down hurts my assbones too, I don't even have a flat behind either, just the bones being funky ig
Im the opposite, im fat asf
I’m a bodybuilder. I’m not lying I swear. I weigh 135lbs 😅 I’m super skinny but my muscles make my size
You're sooo fn pretty
The belt holes do suck tho  (Relatable )
It can suck being skinny. You're pretty so fuck the haters.
Fun fact: I'm roughly two hundred pounds but I clock in at 5 feet 4 inches, so I'm what one might consider to be fairly stocky. HOWEVER, I have no ass to speak of whatsoever, so the ass bones thing when you sit is also a problem with me, and it fucking sucks
It’s uncomfortable to lie down on my side. 💀
The dancing thing, you can take dance lessons or youtube some dances and learn. Freestyling however is impossible for me. I still struggle with gaining weight but I had comments on my weight going both ways. I had my parental guardian ask me at 12/13 if I was pregnant. I'd never had a bf or kissed anyone. Also heard the "Go eat" one quite a few times
I went through a massive weight lost transformation since I used be chubby my family would make fun of me to it now the call me a skeleton and say that your gonna break in half. Nothing is never enough and instead love your own body
Yes Fax im skinny as hell
Nah I’m not fat I’m really wide and tall and it’s strange all of the problems I have
You know, as a skinny kid I was constantly asked “Don’t you ever eat?” Or “How are you so skinny” and I always replied with “I eat like someone twice my weight and I have a fast metabolism”. However, until people started bitching about “skinny people problems” I never once felt insulted but rather I took it as a compliment because a lot of people would love to eat as much as me and not gain weight. My point is: STOP BITCHING ABOUT EVERYTHING
Someone else like me
When you eat too much already and skinny af. This things happens. How do people get fat so fast after eating a lot?
You dance better than I do
im fat and relate to the positioning ones. I guess fat and skinny people need to work out just to sit comfortably.
Dude I would agree with you I am a stupid 8th grader and still way 80 pounds. I fully agree with this vid
The last one isn't skinny problem it's white people problem
"can't dance" that's just a white person problem
And fat people can dance.....?
Oh so you want to be fat  Don’t worry I’m skinny too
When a skinny person falls or hits their elbow/knee/hip, it hurts a lot more because they have nothing between their skin and their bones
The worst part of the pants issue is that compannies will convince you the problem is your body, not the pants... But I really hope that everybody knows that the uniqueness of our bodies will NEVER be the problem, everyone has a body that is beautiful in its own little way.
Dancing makes us look like twigs blowing in the wind
I know your pain I am 11 and I am 3 stone
Only Jayus is 6 foot at 13 years old i--
Oh, thats my sister is always cold
She dances better than I know how to walk
Once i got called skinny by 4 different people in ONE DAY
Yeah. Same. I’m fuckin lanky. LÖNG.
All of these are do true especially the last one
I no how you  feel
i'm still skinny but on the muscle side skinny, my stomach department is full and i tried training but i have had some difficulties with building up muscles (coca cola addiction) and i can't get it of of my self
That last one is actually no issue. at least not one caused by weight. it's easier to dance if youre thinner due to better flexibility
Im in the bed and I'm cold af B)
Osteoporosis, greater risk of dementia, increased difficulty fighting cancer, & some others I can't remember at the moment. Definitely better off if you just have a night metabolism.
Dude.... Ive been watching your YouTube vids and now ran into you on fbook. You are hysterical... You'd be an awesome best friend. You'd have me rolling all day every day lol.
I get cold easily, I must be skinny
You can dance better than me
You dance a hell of a lot better then I
Is that why you turned lesbian?
This is fucking me in a nutshell
The Cant Dance part is EXTREMELY debatable
You're just ok. You're not skinny.
Only skinny people know I feel better to be skinny
Wanna trade places? Haha
True.
Lol that is my problem's
I fucking love you! I was 117 pounds when I joined the Army so I know all about being skinny! This was the best laugh all day, Thank you!
Honestly same I feel you
"sitting down hurts my ass bones" IM NOT THE ONLY ONE???
As someone who is really skinny, all of them are so fucking true
Im fat af and i cant dance eather😂🤣
I love this. I have always been SUPER skinny and this makes me so happy that other peole get it
this actually happened to me and my friend the other day. were both quite skinny and we didn't have our school jumpers on so just our shirts, so our arms were showing. these girls (one year above us) walked past and said "you guys are so skinny, lucky! but try eat more" and they all started laughing. am i the only one who dosent find this funny??
Skinny... and hot!
Those danse moves are just drip
Hey girl I'm not skinny and I can't even dance
I'm also skinny af
So true
Bruh fax
Jayus : I can't dance! Also Jayus : throws the best dance moves I've seen in my life.
True Dat, I feel the pain every day. Lol.
"you should try eating more"  WELL GEE IDK WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
Are you calling me out.
Bro I feel you but I can dance pretty well bcuz when I was in school I was in kinder garden and I danced in my school yeah every body told I was the best one dancing and then like then I just started dancing . Oh and potatoes supposed to make you fat right and I love potatoes so I eat them every day and IT DOSENT WORK ON ME WHEN I WEAR A BELT I NEED TO POKE HOLES TROUGH MULTIPLE TIMES AND YOUR LIKE SO F ING TALL WHEN YOUR SKINNY  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I have the same weight problem with the same problems that come with being overly skinny. When someone complains of being fat I chime in with “ I have a weight problem as well, it’s just the opposite of yours “ and they would roll their eyes. Then I would say “ at least you don’t have to run around in the shower to get wet.”
Yeah us skinny people look like worms when we try to dance
The dancing made me fall in love 😂😂😂
I wish I had this problem lol
So true
Me just being fat ngl fat problems are a lot worse you get bullied a hella lot and constantly have the thought people judging you
That "dancing" is not because you're skinny.
I know the joke is you don’t have hips so you can’t dance, but we’re all envious of those moves you just laid down😂
Ive been skinny all my life and ive had comments about my weight but I dont bitch and moan about them like a baby its a joke stop looking for attention
True im skinny im 5.12ft and i Weigh 39.00
THISSSS PEOPLE THERE ARE MANY DOWNSIDES TO BEING VERY SKINNY EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS "UR LIKE A SKELETON" "DO YOU EVER EAT?" AND THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE CALLING THEMSELVES FAT AND SAYING THEY WANT TO BE ME CUZ IM SO SKINNY PEOPLE NO WANT TO BE YOU NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
You can look good dancing being thin, i mean look at kpop idols. But yes, most thin people can’t dance.
I am literally a twig and I agree with these problems
Raise my hand you said you can't dance from what I seen you got moves so you can dance in my opinion
Do you look like my cousin it’s a compliment
I am skinny too   It really sucks
My skinny legs were a constant source of stress when I was a teenager!!
Happens with me all the time
YES that's awful, but still everyone around me is like "Oh I want to be skinny, I'm so jealous of you" :>>
Sadly, I can relate.
People don't know how much you have to eat yo gain weight if your skinny
That dancein was brilliant
Hate to break it to you jayus, but the reason you can’t dance is cause you’re shit at dancing.
Me too jay
Those dance moves are legendary don't worry, they're the best moves I've ever seen
I agree. My family calls me a skeleton or a bone. It sucks
I completly understand im 6.7 and way 280 pounds
Absolutely I just hate all that stuff about being skinny I hate it
You can dance
"I just got to a healthy weight, like, this year-" *pans down toscale reading 66.7 lbs*
I love how fat people have the same problems but also are systematically oppressed
Third one is a lie i know
everything is very accurate  everything that people said about you happenned to me
Милаха))
Ngl I was was very unhealthy skinny B4 lockdown and I was 38 kg now I'm 66kg
this is kinda the same problems fat people have except its the complete opposite of your explanations
I don't mean to read you for filth, and say the one thing you probably don't wanna hear, but your bad dancing isn't related to your size... you're just bad at it.
Oh boohoo so sad
Prettt sure that dancing is on you
As a fellow skinny person due to genetics, I hated when your bones pop out of place and the weird looks that you get putting them back in. I wish I could share memories of the time I terrified a bunch of classmates as kid for putting my leg back in place after it dislocated during gym class. I got sent to nurse's office and had to explain that it's happened so much, I didn't register the pain anymore.
That dancing was actually world class
You still look amazing tho. :3
I hear you, but the freezing part can be prevented by doing more sports (as in really getting your muscles tired regularly)
* My over 6ft tall n skinny 62kg ass being a dancer and spending most of the cold winter wearing shorts*: O-oh, guess I'm an exception...  Te eat something comments and the rest of problems hit close home tho.
Hate everything about this
I have the exact same problems lol I am so skinny
Isnt this the girl who said the N word
I still prefer skinny than fat because still beats the many problems of obesity. But still this is good information to know non the less.
hey, you might want to buy a military belt, no need to poke holes on the belt, just zip and go.
I think the last part is just you.
Relatable
That last one just cuz you're white
damn, i relate to this a lot. every time i sit down, my ass starts to hurt like hell after five minutes or so. also the feeling of my ribs touching the floor when i lay down is just weird
I have a huge waist small legs huge top I and I have the same problems
Im skinny and Im always cold I used to be fat but then I started to hate myself for it because I saw all these pretty Skinny girl in bikinis and I hated my fat for that so I started eating less but I still ate with a healthy diet and started dancing after every meal and I got used to it and now I act I still don't like my body but its good to know I changed( ╹▽╹ )
Also can't forget if there's strong wind it'll push you back a bit😂
Insulation is bullshit i still get mad cold
Yo this is the MOSTTT relatable thingy I saw In Ages
As someone who is skinny I can attest
I’m so skinny u can see my veins through my skin 😭
Tall + skinny = trash dancer confirmed lol
Nah
You look good
Lol I'm skinny kinda just got over it
I felt this being 140 my whole life and being 5’11
I can agree
SHEEE SHE CAN DANCE BETTER THAN ME *Dances like a crab and fall and cries*
I'm exactly the same way. 27 years old and have been 130 for a decade.
That’s me
Your 66 Pounds
Same
Fell ya. I'm 6ft3 and 150lbd
Im jealous
I feel you
for me they say i dont sleep
The worst one is... can you hide behind that electric pole!
I've always been skinny like this but I have always been really athletic too so when people say I have 'no meat' on my bones they don't expect me to be able to do the kind of shit I do, I always just found it funny.
Jayus: *"Says she can't dance but then busts some moves"*  Me: Bruh . . . . . You *CAN* dance
Cant relate haha
Another thing that people don't realize they do is creat an ED with things they say. Omg you're so skinny you're so pretty. We start to internalize that being skinny is the only way we are seen as pretty
Fellow skinny person here! Just can't wait until I don't have the metabolism of a nuclear reactor lol
#relatable but did your scale say 66 pounds? Or did I misread that
Felt
LMAO THIS IS SO RELATABLE 😂
U make kids cry just by dancing.so don't do that
This do be true though
Aren’t you a racist
I have the fucking same problems! 😫
Yes, been skinny my whole life and can't gain weight at all, kinda sad, I want a little chub :(
When I was 150 lbs my thigh bones used to stab people when we done missionary. Now I'm 200 and just crush them.
Ngl i thought she was a he and he was a she...??? What
Been here before
I'm so skinny that I might blow away
Probably more acceptable than being fat tho
Also bike seats like going for a bike ride for to long hurts
I feel I bend my side like halfway sitting on a chair I get sore
It's true, everyone always say I never eat anything even though I eat a lot, I'm just this skinny
Even while I’m not skinny I can’t dance
You should get a GRIP6 belt no holes can make it super small if needed. Anyway congrats on getting to a healthy weight.
This girl is 66 lbs
It's ok I can't dance either🥺
Just a cute as a button spider monkey.
I'm skinny, and all things that are mention in this video, are all facts to me.
I wish i can make money but complaining all day
Why does everyone have to cuss so much?
As someone skinny I understand
Talk honey talk let them know how we feel
Ok the last one is just so goddam true imo
For reference I’m over 6’ and under 150 lbs. Clothes are probably the biggest annoyance for me. I have to buy jeans that are a few inches too big in the waist for them to reach my socks, but even then not every pair with the right measurements fits well. Long sleeve shirts generally don’t go all the way down my arms. I have to search for shorts with longer inseams so it doesn’t look like my cargo pants are short shorts. Things made for people my height are generally too big, and things made for people my weight/waist size are generally too small.  I also sleep with three blankets year round, a weighted one, a warmth one, and a fluffy one. Any less than that and I’m cold. I live in Texas.   Roller coasters. Often the safety bars are either too snug (which im thankful for) or im just big enough to prevent it from clicking into the next setting, giving me a few inches of wiggle room. It’s never not terrifying when you are suddenly not sitting in a seat, but only in contact with a single bar preventing you from flying to your doom.
Shutting up helps not burn calories been trying to get you off my app for months
Person: I am too skinny  Society: omg. What the fuck. Stop complaining. There are fat people. You absolute badonkadonk.
"Get too cold" excuse me but thats the least of my problems in a tropical country, id be happy when I wake up at morning when I feel cold
I’m built like a thin mint
Thid is me
I am only 70 lbs. I have these problems
Yeah I’m skinny but back when I was in school and even more skinny I was bullied more than fat kids in similar age. Healing those insecurities caused by bulling kids took a lot of time (I’m 27 and still sometimes got weird irrational fears).
You dance a million times better then I can 🤣
Scrawny gang
I’m struggling right now this is literally what’s happening to me
Thats the best dance i have ever seen..
You should never say to someone who looks skinny "do you eat or sum", as it can be hurtful or just annoying, for exemple, I'm a literal skeleton, but I'm one of the ppl who eat the most in my family
Hold on skinny people can dance tho
Oof me n my friends can relate
Been skinny my whole life. Except when I was pregnant.  All 5x I came home from the hospital in my pre pregnant jeans. Shoutout to my metabolism. 👐
“I am so afraid you will break in half in the wind” -hahas
As a skinny person, the average of the Weight on my class is 45 kg.       I'm 35 kg.
As a skinny person, breakfast is super important if you want to gain weight. Skipping breakfast is why I was so skinny for so long. Once I started consistently eating three meals a day I started to get closer to a healthy weight.
How did u get into healthy weight? Plz share!!!!
Not that being me
This girl is my spirit animal
Preach!!!
Same
I agree I am really skinny and this video is so true
Faxx
We live in a society 😔
I was really skinny when I was young that anything would bruise me. Now I am the size of a hippo and almost as solid as one that I don't bruise and I have been hit by 2 vehicles going 15 and 25 mph and never broke a bone and only got a bruised rib from one and a bruised ass on the second lol. Also I can't dance for shit either.
I know how you feel
Don’t people realize if you’re small you’ll have a small appetite. You can’t just randomly eat a ton of food that your stomach can’t hold and gain more weight
Facts, can confirm. Can’t dance also the belt thing is so relatable and yeah probably the ribs thing too.
I don’t know I the dancing is a skinny people problem
Im so fucking skinny that my family calls me the walking skeleton guy
As a skinny person I can confirm we cannot dance.
This is real shite
Yeah, it's not fun being fat either. As a female of the same height (6'2") im 300lbs. I could be enjoying a cheese burger & ppl are like,  'Ew, your disgusting! How can you eat that? ' But if Im eating a healthy salad they're like, 'Haha, ya know that's not gonna help,  right? Maybe you should get off your fat ass &  actually DO something for once.  Dieting doesn't seem to help, im partly disabled & exercise is literally torture. It hurts so bad I can barely take my dog out for a casual walk.  Btw I was in pain 70lbs ago, im NOT in pain cuz im fat.  Clthes don't fit & I can't just cut off some extra fabric. I can't FIND cute clothes that are for fat AND tall ppl. So IM ugly AND my CLOTHES are ugly. I can't have a style of my own.   I can't even FIND a belt in my size. Sure, you have to punch extra holes, well, I don't even OWN a belt I can never find it in my size.
Dude needs a makeover
As someone who is skinny af, I can comfirm all of these
I don’t get how it’s fucked up to tell a kid to eat so that they get to a healthy weight but okay
At least she is not short
This is facts
Dont ever dance pls
I am skinny to i am 15 and not realy smal and i only am 45 kg
what are you talking about those are some sivk dance moves
Those Dance moved ROCK
so accurate I need a soft chair to sit on bro. I gotta sit in seat for 8 hours at school and who whole time I'm uncomfortable cause my ass hurts.
I’ve realized fat people and skinny people complain about the same thing from two different angles
This is so relatable
Oh that's interesting, I'm plus size and my butt also hurts when I sit for too long, but I'm gessing it's because of the weight.
Why is this literally my life RN I don't why ijust F-ING skinny during lockdown and it was ok until I got out of my like everyone I knew started saying do you have eating disorders or what not and I was like no bitch I had eating alot
Pretty similar to fat people problems: 1 either have to squeeze between arm rests or wrap ass around a stool 2 how you breath like that? 3 its the opposite, start sweating in mid 70s of no breeze. 4 same problem with belt, plus new problem of waist being thicker than hips/ass and belt not helping anyway. 5 Big is not beautiful no matter how much body positivity deep gets said, and everybody knows it. 6 Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
God im fat as fuck and i STILL dont got insulation!! I can relate mate xD
So you get bullied if you’re fat, and also skinny. What the fuck should I be??? And if you’re a ripped muscle man even people call that gross lol. I’ll just be air.
FAX
I'm fat person 😭
i relate this video so much
I relate to all of those problems because i’m 11 and I only weigh like 71 pounds because I eat like a bird😁👍
I'm skinny and i can do the fkin kazotsky kick dance, other than that... Yeah this happens to me
so i have a theory why skinny people can't dance. 1.you need muscle to dance hard, and powerful move in dances looks good. 2.thier limbs are so long and lanky, that they don't know how to put their limbs properly.
I feel this internally and deeply. It never gets easier.
I mow my uncles lawn every summer. And the mower got a really soft seat. My uncle pointed out that he can literally see the ischial tuberosities (the 2 bones u sit on) engraved in my seat xD I got embarrased because I have tried for years to gain weight but it just doesnt work…. :((
I’m extremely skinny too and my family says I’m a bird
This is all true
I can relate
I can rellate to this so much
I’m definitely not skinny and have a lot of the same issues
I am not skinny but I am always cold and that makes me a good girlfriend bcs I steal most hoodie's
Hey come on, you can dance way better than I (a fat guy) can!
Rotatable
What the hell are you talking about? Dancing ✨God✨
"Go poke new holes into it" is so true
Am a skinny guy too👀🤣🤣 and got the same problems
you dance good
This all happened to me,but on reverse
She is hilarious
There’s also when you sit on a wooden chair that has no hole in the back, you get bruises along your spine because it sticks out just enough for that… the beach gets a whole lot more interesting when you have a bunch of bruises down your spine.
In my opinion,  you should start with getting implants. There is no downside to Bice Noobs !
Yeah, I'm pretty gangly. I used to be a fat kid, then I lost a load of weight and now my body moves like a slinky when I dance.
All of these apply, but hey if your ever trapped under ground you know who isnt. Going to be stuck.
Can’t dance might just be a personal problem because I know some skinny people and they can dance
What do you mean you cant dance those moves are sick.
well you dance better than me
I eat about 21 pancakes for breakfast and I'm still 95 pounds
Not being able to dance has 0% to do with your weight
SAMEEEE
I feel all these except not being able to dance.
I remember having to wear pants that had those straps to tighten the waist, then put a belt on with extra holes in it
Damn right girl. Skinny kid knows about it u.u
I really felt the awe your belt doesn't fit poke new holes in it 🤣
I am in love with this woman.
you da best tho 👍
Same  Me SKINNY
Relatable moment
That dancing was cute
I can relate a lot to this 😭
You can dance WAY better than me and I'm not skinny I'm on the chubby side lol
I swear i have all of those problems but i was slightly overweight till last month hahaha My proportions are really weird, so my waist is to thin for my hips and i always have to make new holes into my belt xD
I didn’t know you played basketball jayus that’s interesting
I can relate to this
Lalisa Manoban (Lisa from blackpink) is skinny, and fit. Yet she can dance?? Tell me how
There's also overweight problems.. 🥲
bruh i’m ✨skinny too✨
You remind me of my brother Yes he's skinny af
Me the exact opposite
U gay? I mean I'm bi but mom doesn't want me to have a gf :(
this is so fucking treu
This is so relatable
YOU CAM DAMCE
Your mouth is your downfall
It isn’t normal to bruise your ribs when you lay down? 🥲I guess we’re built different together
The dancing has more to do with your culture not your size. Keep being beautiful mama
It’s considered dancing
I am happy this is a video I definitely have all these issues
Thats not even skinny. When youre bodybuilding shredded thw fat on tbe bottom of your feet isnt there anymore and walking barefoot is likw hell
I'll take the rib bruises any day to be able to wear a bikini
maby start exercising.....
As a tall skinny person I 100% agree with this and that this is factual
This is all false because i am actually considered as "skinny" too
Number 3 and 4 hit hard. I work outside and am also short so buying pants is evil
Me who is skinny and showers everyday with cold water in 53° weather: pfft, amateur
u also been racist ur whole life or is it only on instagram DMs with black content creators??
Skinny people: "clothes don't fit, at least we've got belts. Ah shit, gotta punch some holes dang." Fat people: "clothes don't fit, nothing here fits, let's go drive somewhere else and hope they've got bigger clothes, we've already been searching for hours"
Finally!! Someone who understands my pain :,)
Me w0hos basicly skinny but all the time Its hot for me: Am i some sort of calt? My tjoughts:am i acually skinny? Do i just eat alot?is it bc i go to gymnastics? Am i some sort of calt?  Eh #VERYskinnyPeopleProblems 🙂👌
5 is so freaking relatable everyone say you should eat more and stuff like bruh do you think i tried eating a crap ton
Can anyone explain why jayus is in a basketball court and basketball clothing..?
As a 5,11 man who was 9ish stone. I feel you. Only in the last few years have I started putting on weight.
Typical America where fat people are the norm
Can we just all agree that belts are a problem in general? If you're too fat you don't get a belt, if you're too skinny you don't get a belt, and if you're none of the above you can actually find pants your size. Whoever is making belts, if you're listening, please help us
Ok
Boo hoo you gotta poke holes in your belt, I GOTTA BUY NEW ONE ALL THE DAMN TIME
Yes. You get cold in like 2 F*UCKING SECONDS. Also clothes when your shirt and skinny is so hard to find good clothes
She’s not wrong about anything
Exactly
So true literally me
She dances better than I do
Poor thing
When I was 10 I weighed 50
Sameeee I get all over these
Rav
REMINDER:  just like its hard for skinny ppl to gain weight and dont tell someone “ just eat more”.  its hard for fat ppl to lose weight and just the same, you SHOULDN’T tell them “ just eat less/better”
I'm telling you being thin in the philippines is much more harder, the people will bully down to the bones (get it?)
Yup I relate too. But there is pluses as well. We squeeze in narrow places. Month after giving birth I jumped over fence with buggy and women with food baby was stuck there. I know it sounded weird but I got locked in park because London’s parks has closing hours. 😂 it’s easier to hide if you’re smaller. Clothes don’t get too small for us so we save money because we get to wear them not replace them. i have serious core muscles. TWIGS ASSEMBLE!!!🤣❤️😎😂
True
I can't dance either but I don't let that stop me from trying!
I remember being so skinny until the wind almost made me fall I was only 20kg
I've always been skinny as well but I don't get cold easily I'm usually pretty warm
Bruh these problems still doesn't faze me away being skinny is a 1000 times better than being obese
the sitting down and cold ones!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!
Careful weight can fuck you up
Lmao you'r cute as skinny no need to eat 😂
Wtf did that say 67 pounds Jesus no way mabey I'm just to drunk I'm like 350 and I'm chillin
“I can’t dance”  False. Those are funky moves
Bro u got the exact same problems as me
Gross
As a skinny guy this is way too relatable
We skinny people have own problems too not just fat people
Jayus I swear to God I relate to these in the easiest way possible like the 5th one hit me hard 😭 also if you see this hii! having fats metabolism is a blessing until you are told to eat more so that you are not blown away by the wind 💀
clothes never fit me, especially dresses, i need the ones that has a rubber around the waist because if not, the clothes would look like a paper bag, honestly this is why i love shirts more, the oversized ones too.
I thought I was the only one
The belt thing is exactly why I buy fabric clip belts now, I was fed up of leather belts.  But yeah same for everything else too, being tall and thin is the absolute worst for buying clothes, dancing makes me look like jack fucking skellington, and eating is haaard
I relate to all except 5 thankfully, my mum would murder anyone who said anything like that lol
✓ skinny ✓ flat chest  Don't worry you are one of a kind.....
The thing is I am overweight for my body but I experience all of them
Oh I feel this. Except I can dance xD but I legit can't gain weight... 60kilo was maximum and can't go over it. it was for like 46 kilo like until I got 21...
Wtf does skinny hasta do with one's ability (or Inability) to dance,   ?? And yip I know some of those problems too,
I almost got taken away from my mom because of how skinny I am
I'm 49 killos and I'm 15
I have always thought I was overweight. My whole life until I was 16. See, I did dance when I was little and every single girl there was skinny and flexible. Keep in mind I was really self conscious of myself when I was only 8-9 years old. When I turned 15 I actually became okay with my body, but still considered my thighs and stomach big. So when 16 came around  (I had gained a lot of weight due to personal reasons)  I realized how beautiful I was months ago. I realized I wasn't ugly, that I should watch what I eat not to be skinny, but to be healthy.  I'm happy now ☺
Thank you so much, not enough people speaking on this, it means allot
I can relate 100% with the holes poking on my belts
Nah your better  at dancing than me beautiful moves 😂
Same
This is way too relatable
How comes y'all skinny I'm fat af. 😭😭😂
Wait ur a girl??
I can’t either
Her sink must be indestructible
Don't lie. You can't dance cause your white. It's okay all us white boys can't do it
Short and sweet I hate your problems lol
same
Ephesians 4:29  Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.
How old r u
Same
And then as a fat person it was the opposite
And yet when a fat person talks about how hard it is to be fat people call them pigs and tell them to lose weight.
She still cute tho love her voice
very true
I swear to God if somebody else tells me to eat a sandwich I'm going to go postal. I pay for my own food now. so I can damn well tell you I eat a metric shit ton.
Telling us to eat a burger is the same as saying to a fat person eat a salad
Finally someone I can relate too
On the insulation part, you deadass just need a hug fam. Also, as somebody who was a twig for awhile, laying down like that wasn't fun at all, hurt after "x" amount of time.
Can u give 5ips how we can gain weight
I don’t know what you’re talking about, those were great dance moves
Ay for that last one. I am average wait and I can't dance for shit
Being thin seems like a blessing to me, imo..  Working so goddamn much to keep myself fit and thin, but my slow-ass metabolism has me locked into a Keto-diet.
Still better than being a fat lazy slob good work 👍
That explains why my ass hurts so bad 💀
Did that just say 66 pounds?
#5 is inaccurate. Those were some alluring moves.
Nice groove at the end tho
I used to be more self contious about being thin, then I realized I just don't get shitfaced on liquid bread every other night so thay's nice.
It hurts everyone when sitting down
Yea she can't dance
Ok now I feel bad for calling my bff skinny stick 😭-
Same
OK THAT IS ME TOO
Is everyone a victim of something these days?
Those were some badass dance moves ngl
Yup, basically ever chair feels like stone, and I dance like a wet noodle too hahahaha
I've always been on the smaller side but I'd rather be under weight than a fat disgusting waste of space 👍🏻
I'm in love with jayus at this point 😚
If I sit down, my ass starts to hurt and I’m overweight…
Bruh them dance moves are fire
Mood
Lmaooo
the belt thing is so fucking true, i always had to poke new holes
Dead ass your are very beautiful ❤
I have to wear kids belts because adult belts don’t fit.
Bruh I’m 12 almost 13 is 80 lbs a normal weight? My friends are all between 100-130
Most skinny people I know dont actually have a fast metabolism its usually just and excuese and they usually have some sort of eating disorder or they just stick in their room all day without any sort of activity
Yeah
Lol my mom literally told me to eat a burger tonight haha
I am still skinny and what she said is so true
This hit so fucking hard for me haha. Skinny dude and you nailed it all.
Well, I'm really skinny. But I can dance. I think that's just a matter of having a sense of rythem.
Just eat
Society: “i want a person who is skinny”  Also society when they see skinny people: “omg don’t you eat or anything”
So with me I’m EXTREMELY skinny so it’s like trying to feed a skeleton it just goes directly through me and don’t even get me started on the cold thing because multiple times a week it will be 90 frikin degrees in my house and I have multiple blankets piled on top of me and I’m shivering from being cold and I’ve tried to gain wait and as a result I lost weight so I would try to lose weight to alt as a reverse psychology thing but instead I still ended up losing weight 🙄☹️
Yes. Just yes.
putting holes on belts, dang it hit me
My 10 year old sister weighs more than I do and my grandma always makes fun of me for being too skinny I hate it
I am so thin that I can wrap my arms around myself
I barely eat yet I’m overweight 😂 still get super cold all the time though.
I’d rather be skinny than be my old self(246lb) because…YOU CANT MOVE WITHOUT GETTING EXHAUSTED IN 2 SECONDS
Same
I myself am pretty thin. I brought it up to my doctor an they just brushed it off like 'ohh you're over reacting!' I cant wait till my metabolism fucks itself over.
Today this girl told me she eats chips for lunch everyday and My reaction was…..HOW ARE YOU STILL SKINNY?! 😃
Shut up your channel is annoying, being skinny is ideal and most people of all history were skinny.
I have already accepted this skinny body I have I don't regret being skinny even though if I'm the most skinny out of all family members and even relatives but I accept it cuz my parents think gym is bs u can't transform through it just eat properly but I do eat properly but since u don't wanna lemme join gym I guess I'm ok like this atleast I ain't excessive fat so yeah this is good... :)
Imwitcha
this is me
Nice mouth. You must have to sneak up on food.
Okay but those were some sick dance moves
I was so skinny for so long and had/still have these problems. Since 2020 started tho I decided I wanted to stop being skinny and ended up overweight with skinny people problems. I really need to exercise:(
I dont think there is a single aspect of life that dosent have its problems
I don’t get that last one🧐
Holy shit i couldn't relate more
Imagine this but worse that’s what overweight people go through
I'm not skinny and have all these problems
It because of the comments people made when I was a kid and still make now that caused me to have extreme insecurities about my body to the point I'd wear baggy cloths or multiple layers to seem "healthier" so people would stop saying it. I use to eat so much food to the point I'd be unable to move trying to gain weight. I wish people would just stop making jokes or comments on others bodys. You may think what your saying is harmless but it's not.
For dancing no one can lol
As a skinny person I can totally relate
My favorite pic of her is her wearing blue kinda like a police officer, idk why it just fits her so much and Everytime i see this vid i literally see the pic and I'm like "how can someone be so beautiful...."
The tall funny human knows my pain, this is relatable
This is funny, because there has never been anyone who has such a relatable to myself, especially the bruised ribs, because I'm barrel chested
As a skinni i can relate
I felt all of these on a personal level. My doctor still thinks I'm borderline anorexic because of how fucking tiny I am. 5'5" and never over 100lbs.
Im so skinny i keep trying to get weight
Relatable
Thank God someone understands how I feel
man it must suck to be at a comfortable and attractive weight
A good one I heard as a kid was  “where do you put all that food?” (I ate a lot as a kid but still looked like a twig)
My friend always ask me if u eat bro i eat like every 5 minute
I have this exact same problem cuz I am basically just skin bones, my bones stick out from my back🥲
I feel this pain.... And am a man :|
As a fellow skinny person, yep this is all true.
I'm having this problem now skinny is literally my ideal frame I wish to achieve but when I go to family functions they're like: "U need to eat" ....like I don't eat I'm not skinny rn I'm 215 Ibs. But I plan to be 189 Ibs. My 5"11 BMI by the end of next year....Hopefully
My 9 year old bro also was very skinny but now he is getting weight
148lb at 5'11. Dis is relatable
Do people actually not enjoy being skinny?
Yo you just summarized my entire life in less than a minute 🤣🤣
You weigh 66 lbs? I just lost like half my respect for you
My fix for the belt problem is sweatpants about 99% of the time the last 1% is when i actually need to wear one.
Bruh, I have to eat all the the time since I have high metabolism, but I still am incredibly skinny,.
I feel so bad for your troubles, thank you for all the cursing
You dance fine
Fax tho
It ok nether can I I cant dance
Finally, someone relatable
My friend said yesterday that I look like a skeleton!
I respect you and your amazing dancing
OMG YOU GET US SO FUCKING WELL I AM SO SKINNY AND THE COMMENTS ARE THE FUCKING WORST
Well this is relatable
I'm still dealing it from people all the time but my dad would, and still does tell me I need to eat or if I couldn't finish a meal that "didnt matter because I needed the fat anyway". I am now super insecure im skinny, and I dont have enough thighs or whatever.  Please stop telling people that out of random, it really sucks and its super unclmfortable for some people.
"Skinny abs"
Lol 😂 that last part I loved it
Finally someone that understands my problems of being 55 kg at the age of 20 but for some reason i dont get cold easily i get warm really fast
Bigger people always dance better
I kinda think the last one isn't the structure being the problems
wat you talking about you got the moves 😂😂😂
Same but I can dance no cap
Why am I so relatable but I’m not skinny
I think it's a girl, not sure tho
As a normal human being, I'm starting to understand others' pain.  But I also suck at dancing tho 💀
Ok but that last one is on u lol. I’m 5’11” & I can dance 🤣 the rest is true tho. Turn 35, the weight may balance out 🤷🏽‍♀️
Still better dance moves than I got with my fluffier self
I can relate
Lol the ol belt issue. I seriously wonder if most ppl think they're like a one size fits all type deal ?? Cuz you can just buy a belt for ur waist size instead of poking new holes.... ahah
Work out that helps
Lots of interesting people problems, I’m considered overweight but I have a very low body fat ratio. So I go to the doctor and they say you’re overweight so I just constantly wonder how the hell that works. I have heard the BMI table was made off the weight of deceased people and not living but I got nothing. Anyone else got any interesting problems that make no sense?
Same
These are all facts bc im more skinny than a twig
Why is this so true?? Me with a fast metabolism and the fact that I am a dancer✌️  Some comments also include: “You have a bony butt or hips” “You are cold because there is no meat on your bones! You are all skin and bones!” “Aww you are so tiny!” “You need to eat more cookies and donuts!” “I wish I was skinny like you”
Wait a sec I'm actually unhealthy skinny and I just found out
At least you can break it down
Sadly this is all true 😥
All true
I'm a 6 foot 22 year old skinny dude and the biggest problem I have is my fekin metabolism, I eat for a full 5 person family in one day and cannot get over 70 kg 😂😂
Cute
She is beautiful
Me to
I'm always the girl in class that shivers at any cold breeze. And I always get hurt whenever I fall and it hurts to rest my head on my desk or sit without a cushion.  I would use a sweater as a cushion at school, but guess who is freezing without a sweater?? MEEE
you dance a billion times better than me 💀
The hole in the belt is way too accurate.
This video builds my self esteem as a fat kid
Damn, I feel it....... I hate it
Hmm explains why I’m always so freakin cold
I had an eating disorder while going through puberty which delayed me quite a bit. The comments you mentioned really do hurt
A dad can't dad either
Yo fr
Even though I really can't relate to this, it is hilarious.
That last one is just you problem
I am not skinny but I relate to this except the eat a burger
Still wanna be skinny
I am super skinny, and it's cas my metabolic rate is way too fast. The result of this is that on top of the mentioned skinny person problems, no matter how much I eat, I can't gain weight. If I eat more than normal, I feel sick and loose my apetite for my next meal.
Same
Mega vibe
I have way too people skinny problems and I hate it cuz I'm always freezing
GURL WE THE SAME LOLZ
All of this is relatable
Got better moves then me when she said I can't dance
Please don't skinny shame it's just as hurtful. Some people just have fast metabolisms and it's hard for them to gain weight, like me.  You know what also hurts really bad I get rashes and cuts on like the my pelvis. The big bone that sticks out on right Infront of my hips. That gets so cut up when I go down waterslides because of the friction:(
This is all true
The dancing one aint a skinny problem, im a healthy meaty guy and still, I cant dance at all either
I’m fat and can’t dance
Same Bc I’m very very skinny
You can dance better than me and I'm a fat bastard 😂
Can dance better than I thats for sure.
All these things are true!!!!!
Fax yo
I had a skinny friend 3rd to 5th grade, and dang was she skinny just look at her legssss. Im so glad I never told her to go "eat a burger" or something. I would be super embarrassed. Im not super super skinny, especially now, but Ive been pretty skinny as a child and the 1st one was so relatable.
I love skinny girls.
when she says she cant dance #6, starts dancing*
I can relate A LOT! (but not with the dancing part bc I have been in dance for 5 years now. But I am turning 12 on November 12 and I only weigh 85 pounds and I am 4"11
Strengthen your butt (Do squats and thing to strengthen your glutes) if your butt hurts after sitting for a while. The reason why it hurts is because there is little muscle on that butt. (I had the same problem)
Not being able to dance is not a skinny person problem
I mean u can dance better than me so...
Ya please dont be that person that says "do you need food?" I eat whatever i want every day whether it be a row of oreos or an entire costco sized dorito bag in an hour, still skinny. 140 pounds 6'2
Hahah talking the truth!
I can relate to ALL of these because I’m skinny and I really fucking HATE it
hey don't let that stuff bring your hopes and dreams down just be happy that you are being yourself and making people like me happy and feel good about myself so screw them people and just live your dreams and keep making people happy.😘😜
When your fat and still have all these problems 😀 society is fucked and life is hard 🥲
this is so relatable i wanna cry
Raset
I’m 73 pounds and I’m 14 and my acquaintance is litterly 54 and 13 😅
Human: omg u so skinny go eat some more *kalm Human: omg u so fat go diet or somethin *panik  This is the truth sadlyz
Go eat a steak made me gain 45 lbs I went from 90lbs to 135 in about 4 months now I love my weight
I feel ur pain im 6 foot 4 and weigh 105 pounds... ummm🥲
This is me every single day!!
I’m skinny but I’m not I have 4 pack but mans ribs be like 👎
"sniff's" ya
Not me being sticks 💀
Always being cold: for a super skinny kid, i was able to withstand the cold very well, t-shirts and jeans in temperatures below 0. It wasn’t until this year, 19/20 years old that the cold finally started getting to me, now i need a sweatshirt anything below 50 degrees lmao. I still get that it’s better than most people but its an insane difference ive felt
You are still sp beautiful
Me who has 90% of their weight in fat purely at their belly without one reason explaining why "Yeah checks out besides me being skinny"
YOU CAN DANCE! GET IT
That is all so true, I should know bc I am very tall and skinny
The struggle is real 😭
Just eat more. More than your body could ever process. It's tough. I gained 1st by just stuffing myself and eat 4x a day. I still look skinny..
Dude me too, but I didnt know the reason I couldn't dance because of it, Thankyou
You can dance lol
Sick moves doh?!
I understand your pain I weigh 98 pounds and I’m 16
Eating too much shit just for gaining but end up feeling like shit after ..
Lmao had to get a new belt the other day bc it was too big
Im fat lol
yes. i’m 92lbs and i’m 13yrs. someone literally today asked if i had an eating disorder since i’m so skinny
I don’t think the non dance talent comes with the skinniness… but uhh yk?
Me irl every day
I would still hit
I cant dance   *Proceeds to dance better than me*
My metabolism is infinite so I can relate not being able to get some meat on my bones
And getting a hole puncher for your belt just to make ur pants fit costs more than the price you paid for your belt 😐 that’s why I’m happy when I go back to Asia cus the sizes there actually fit me
Also for some the more you eat the GOD DAMN SKINNER YOU GET and you can’t act cool, cosplay, defend yourself, and a lot of other stuff like you cant sleep on the plane because your to skinny and you might be TO GOD DAMN TALL FOR 2 WHOLE SEATS
I share this with you ESPECIALLY the sitting and comments (exept I understand its a joke)

As a skinny person this is very true like to true
FACTS
Hey you wana trade bodies? Ppl make fun of my weight... even my parents!
I’m skinny and can confirm all of them except for the cold one, I have a really high cold tolerance but I think that may have to do with that I’m a swimmer and I swim in really cold water
Jayus: "I'm skinny" Actual skinny people: "Hold my skin"
High metabolism meant that if I accidentally skipped ONE meal, I could throw up and pass out as if I hadn't eaten in a week.
Being called anorexic as a kid was tough
Hey you got better dance moves than me
Its not easy being hefty or skinny, I've been both during my life and either way I still get hurtful comments. I'm only 16 and I literally can't decide which is better, if anyone has some advice it would be much appreciated 🙏❤
All true mostly the dancing
Ur tall.
I see you I see you        $@mə
I’m more skinny
You certainly can dance
I’m foggin skinny as fuck aswell
You totally can dance and people love it. You look great.
Me who is fat: *scrolls with disappointment*
I'm scared how was this so accurate
Finally found out that she is a she
Im the exact same way it is terrible the bullying and nagging glad its not just me. THANKS FOR UPLOADING THIS
Bro I’m so skinny if you fight me you can grab my ribs and rip them out like people awlays say I need weight
Closing in on 12,000 comments in four days.  Nice.  This problem is better than the opposite problem.
Same girl same
Ah yes you need a swear jar just from this video I'd get my student loans easy💰🤦🤦🤦
okay soooo i’m not that skinny but i get cold so easily 😭 i also overheat too 💀😂
Man I love skinny girls so much
All of these are me 😭😭😭
Man that dance thing is the most relatable out of ANY of them, which is just sad because they're all SO relatable
Wait what!  There is other skinny people in the world?
Idk bro, ur dance moves are way better than mine.
Honestly girl no one can dance 🤦‍♀️
As a skinny person, this is so true
um I have most of this and I'm overweight xD
Fat people problems: "omg your so fat go eat a salad" 🧍🏻‍♀️

My son's pants are the worst of him being tall and skinny. At one point he was a 28-36. He's bulked up a little now though, 32-36. But I still have to buy any pants online. The other one was he ended getting a lot of stretch marks on his back. A result of having growth spurts and being skinny. Poor kid.
But you can change that
so so cold
True
As a skinny peep who cant be a normal weight i relate A TON
Bruh literally everything in this applies to me lmao
I’ve always been underweight my life, but now I know I’m not weird
Bruh this is fax
THESE ARE ALL SO TRUE. I'm the same way and I am the only hot natured person I'm my house and sleep with like 5 blankets
You and I are the exact same weight.
Haa been like this aal along.. and we're the same weight as well 🤣

Wym u can’t dance ur the most beautiful dancer
Only 5 n 6 are a problem for me 😂
My parents always say to me go eat a pizza lol
I'm the skinnier one in my family so my whole family says I look like a twig and sometimes it just hurts cause I don't like being this skinny plus I can never fit into certain clothes that I wanna wear.
Idk tho my family kept caling me skinny 👁👄👁
Sssssssaaaaaaammmmmmeeeee I've been the same way my hole life
This is 100% true!
Okay the dancing one doesn’t correlate to skinny people . If anything it would be opposite 🤷‍♀️ lol jokes .
I think that dance thing is just you
I'm also very skinny so I understand your problems I have so many bruises on my sides and I'm always cold and get almost frost bite in the winter
I'm ten pounds under
I relate
I'm checking of a list of all of the facts about skinny people problem and they are all correct yes this is a very skinny person saying this
Woah it's so weird seeing someone else similar to my size be called skinny. She's 66 kilos and I'm 62 kilos but I used to be REALLY overweight at my fattest I weighed 225 lbs so I still feel like I look fat but seeing her and she's HEAVIER than me!?!? That's crazy.
Facts
My ribs pop out of my stomach and are 100% visible if you look, although I'm amazing at tag, running, climbing, and hide & seek
Bro they do break all the time that’s my I have no friends
bro i have never felt so related to lmfao everything she just said is straight facts
I think the dance issue is just a you thing.
Bro you spiting fact
YESSSSS
Yeah I did but now they say the opposite so I don't care
"Go eat a burger!" Geez jayus, now you sound like everyone I know.
Yes 👏
Dude me to but I also ride dirt bikes and recked and broke my arm I BARELY FELL LIKE WHAT
That beginning is funny to listen to, but I can relate to this
Damn, still looking for who asked
this is why I never show my arms because I know damn well someone is gonna point out how skinny I am
So relatable!! Belts NEVER fit and it sucks. And I have NO CURVES I am flatter than the freaking television screen.
I relate so hard (I only got a healthy weight probably throughout covid pandemics). As for dancing yesterday I had a lot of energy and white girl danced really badly in my kitchen
I can eat junk food for a whole weekend and not gain any weight and I always find that my feet are eternally cold
My sister has been skinny her whole life, but eats like an army. We just recently found out, that because of her high metabolism, she is now developing Rolling Rib, which means her rib cage is falling inward on itself... So...
I got told I look like a holocaust victim, like chill   I know I’m skinny.
Facts
I sware to God I was doing planks in basketball and my back felt like it was going to SNAP
#6 is just cuz your white         that was joke
My ribs show through my skin
Saaaaame man same, specially the ribs bit I hate it
Me too
Jayus you literally hit every point
facts tho
EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE! I’m so skinny even clothes my size that are supposed to be tight are baggy and my ribs show it’s a big insecurity but seeing you have the same problems make me feel way better because your one of my idols :)
Have been skin and Bones half the time I was little until I got older then I became thighs and stomach 😭😭😭wtfreak
I wish I was that skinny... 🥺
You are not the only skinny one I am too and its relatable
Innate farm house insulation perk for the win
Lmao the dancing one though is like me during just dance
Still rather be too skinny than too fat. Being too skinny means people will still date you.
Relatable
felt the cold and belt one
These are all SOOO relatable. My friends always ask me if I eat 😂 and I have to try to find pants that are long because I’m tall but that fit my TINY waist. I wonder what it feels to be a normal weight.
Pretty sure the last one is just yoy
I know all these problems I am freaking skinny
I big enough where the only issue i have is shivering any time it drops below 68°
I cant dance at all and I'm let's say bigger
Man the facts are so true
Same
That’s what I’m saying me being a 13year old boy that’s what I’m saying
I can relate to this I am skinny
My weight is around 29  And I can't help it  And I can't DANCE EITHER 🥲😭
All these are true
If I was that skinny, I would definitely break in half in the wind.
As a skinny guy.. I know.. But as a skinny guy ive had to fight people just to prove im not a wimp.. Thats 47 years of fighting.. Fuck em..
I screamed at all of these- yessssa TvT
Relatable
What the hell
That’s something I just recently learned, people who lost weight told me they didn’t know it was so uncomfortable to sit down and how easy it is to get cold. And I’m just like yep welcome to the world of having no fat
I relate to every single one of these problems. It took me till I was 9 or 8 to reach 50 pounds. YEAH.
I really hate you
In my opinion thoes moves weren't bad
Y she doing the dance like that 💀😭
DUDE THANK GOD SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS MY PAIN
Yet you dont know the pains of being overweight either💁
I really want to be skinny. I hate my body.
The definition of first world problems
that last one is a white person problem
I relate so much to this omg
I always hated the "You need to eat more." I'm not even that thin and I eat more than almost every single person I know. I eat way more than all my in-laws and they're big people.  Shut the fuck up about peoples' bodies.
Another thing is when someone circles your wrist with the hands like they are handcuffs and say "HEY THEIR HANDS FIT!!!:
Ok you can’t be that mad about being skinny you should see me i wish I was that skinny
As a skinny man the one that’s true is 4
Try being fat for a day 😒😒😒
Hey At least it's not like Charli or Dixie's body where you can see their real bones 😂😂🤣🤣. NGL ur Body looks great on u.
FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS MY PAIN
You not being able dance isn’t due to be skinny😂😂😂nice trying to slide that one in
So true
My spine sticks out my back and the chairs at school hurt really bad
All relatable. I weigh 93 pounds
I’m super skinny too and I have all these problems
Idk what being skinny feels like lmao BUT I WANNA
I honestly miss being skinny
As a fat dude, fat problems are completely the opposite, I'm always sweating, It's hard to find clothes that are normal sized or even too big and everyone has to remind me every 5 minutes i'm fat!
I am the same
I'm very skinny to and whenever I played Sports I always worried that my leg bones would snap on my legs if I stepped the wrong way
As a fat person I can say this is true
Society Me who are skinny : **Laugh in asian body standard**  But mostly my parents would tell me to eat more lol
This explains so much. All of these I have.
I’m skinny and by skinny I mean I’m 24 and I weigh 96 pounds!! People say,” Oh you are lucky that your not fat” but it still sucks. I have dealt with this too many times
I think the dancing is just you
And fat people think we’re privileged I think not
You can always go a reverse diet.
I know it sucks and im skinnyre then you
As a skinny person, i agree
Nah u can dance better than me.😂
I wish to have your problem Im 200 lb in mussels but I cant stop working out because I get fat for breathing
But I’m skinny and short
Thank god someone else who understands. Skinny shaming is just as harmful.
I’m in 7th grade and I’m 75 pounds. This video is facts though.
Finally I found their gender
Yes
NGL Jaylus I think that last ones just you.
Same I agree so much
Yep
I like how she says she can't dance but she dances better than me😂
i think the last one is a lie 😂
So true! It’s so annoying, especially the stuff about clothes not fitting and how society views it😡
This has been my every day life since middle school. Everything mentioned here, is what I hear every day still to this day 😔 it absolutely sucks
Lol ya don’t know if the last one is cause of that I can’t dance but I’m thin to
Jag suger mer på dansa
I’m on the heavy side and I can’t even dance so your not alone
Me too yo I'm very skinny I feel the same way I'm so skinny and I get insalted alottttttttt like alot......
My sister is this she needs to get a better digestion and needs to have her period and grow up so it can make her bigger (it’s her dream idk why)
Every thing, soooooo true
My skinniness has gotten to so much of a problem that my parents are making me eat 5 meals a day. MY STOMACH DOESN’T HAVE THAT MUCH CAPACITY.
I’m not making it all about me, but I’m almost 13 and I still way about 85-90 lbs….. kinda depends on the weather
Are the same problems girl at the same problem
The sitting one is not relatable for me butt all the other ones are so true-
I’m so glad I’ll never have these
Yeah having food on the table yet still fitting in with society really sucks. I feel bad for you.
Same 💀✋
As a fat kid I literally have all the opposites. LIKE BELTS! I cant fricking borrow one cause ther to small. Got to buy huge ones for grown men and im not even 13 almost but not. But I cant dance either.
I have issues keeping on weight, but tbh I’d MUCH rather be underweight than overweight.
Got better dance moves than me
A lot of people don’t realize that skinny people can be body shamed too. And that sucks. Most of my life I’ve been told different things. My doctors want me to gain weight but society always told me “I wish I looked like that” or if I did get to a healthy weight it was “did you gain weight? You should loose it you looked better before.” Stuff like that sucks.
As a 6ft 2 140 lb man the only one of these arguments I don't agree with is number 3 I'm very hot blooded
I know i hate being so skinny😩
Don't you eat 🤨? Whenever I go to grandma's house 😭🤝
I think the can’t dance thing is just a white people problems lol
I don’t think the last on is a skinny people problem I’m a bigger girl and still can’t dance
That dancing part was so funny LMFAOOO
Everything is a fact for me
The belt thing is pretty common no matter what size you are a lot of people ignore making sure they're belt fits correctly
The lack of the ability to dance doesn't correlate to being skinny my chubby and I have 2 left feet as the saying goes
Sitting hurts everyone’s ass and fat doesn’t insulate people
I'm 22yr male and weight 130lb and had a fast metabolism my whole so I can 100% relate
Ye...
Chubbys worst I go to school to be made fun of where there's honestly nothing I can do ( No you can be born like this and exercise doesn't help)
Honestly i thought this person was a man who looked like a woman hahah
Yup
Wdym those are some awesome dance moves and I actually feel this lol
I can dance....
I weigh a good amount for my age but I look soooooo skinny
All of this is 100 percent true
I’m in the same boat
My teacher said I’m too skinny so I might blow away in the wind
All except can't dance and rib bruises I relate to
I'm pretty sure that this is Zelda from the original Pet Semetary.
Ha im a fkn torch
Same
I'm 14 and have only weighed 98-100 pounds for like 2 years. My mom keeps telling me to eat more. I do, "you need to stop eating so much". So I do, regardless, I won't gain or lose weight :/
Lol i know how it feels
Ive never realted this hard to a person
I want that
I am fat and I still can’t dance
I can't dance either but I'm not that skinny I'm like 3inchs fat😅😅😅😅😅I can only do gymnastics
I'm not even at the bare minimum weight..
Bro this is relatable I am skinny af
This is so true 😭
🤣THE DANCEING THO🤣
The way u dance 😂😂😂😂😂
I weighed 165 lbs and height of 6'2” all 4 years of HS now I weigh between 250 and 275 and it's not all fat. They didn't let me play much football afraid I would get broke.
I eat SO SO SO Much, yet I'm one of the skinniest guys I know. My metabolism is so fast :/
fat people cant dance either
Most these problems apply to fat as well
I have the same thing
Wtf she weights the same as me I’m 19 years old 6ft male 😂😂
Onlyjayus: can't dance Me: they are better than my moves
Bar NUM 4 non of the where/are a problem
Wtf was that last bit
As a “skinny” Person {I’m 13 and like 7 1/2 stone? So I’m kinda underweight?} I can really relate to the Pants and Belt one 😭 and I have barely any rythme either but I’m working on it plus I’m cold 24/7 😭😭😭
Yes everyone things it so disgusting 🤮
Not me being 5'6 and 100 pounds
Ik its not a compition but I feel like being fat is way worse than being really skinny.
Bruh skinny problems I feel ya
The last part 😂
Im 6’4 150 lbs yep
When they say that you should eat more, like bitch, I can finish a 6 course meal as if nothing happened and my body weight will be the fucking same 🤣
#boneyassgang boiiiiiiisss
I’ve been skinny ever since I was a child but now I’m fat so I can relate to all of this
I'm fat and I can't dance either
That's so true
Wait are you a girl or a boy?
I can’t tell you how much I relate to this TwT
Im skinny and I eat a bunch  God damn metabolism
THIS IS ME
Yep skinny people problems
I can relate🥲
bestie ur a skinny queen
I think the last one is a you problem
And i have been a little bit FAT  AS FUCK FOR MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE I JUST WANNA BE SKINNY AND I CANT DANCE EITHER !!!!!😑😑😑
I felt all of this
6ft at 14 and 160 pounds I'm suppose to be 200
yeah i dont think that last one was a skinny problem
Im...64.0 pounds 😅
Lmao true except the dance. Most dancers(including me ) are skinny af
Its literally body shaming when you say something about someones body type. Its sad people think its okay
Soooo fucking relatiable. Every single one even the dancing 😅
Same tho ever since I was a kid I would nearly cry whenever I sat down because my butt bone always felt like it was funny crack and I got sick a lot and people told me so many toxic things. No, being skinny isn’t fun and it dosnt make me feel more attractive. It makes me feel weak, awkward, stupid, starved. No matter how much I tried to gain weight it didn’t work. So no Barbara you don’t wish you had my body and no grandma it’s not my fault my knees stick out and my ribs show. I can’t control the fact my spine is visible no matter how much I try.
OMG THIS IS SO TRUE i’m forever skinny and these are so relatable
I never noticed this, but she never takes her shoes off
Don't worry , everyone gets fat by their 30s. Good things comes to those that wait 🤰🏿
I got the worst of both worlds, j got French fry arms and thunder thighs 😭
Omg I know and I'm a kid but I'm skinny but I'm heavier than the fatter kids they are 60-70 pounds but I'm younger and I'm 87
Yes! I had all of these problems when I was underweight! 🤣 And I've put on quite a bit of weight to be at healthy weight and my thighs are big, my belly bulges and my butt got fat and everyone still thinks I'm the skinny underweight weak person? Like ..can you not see the weight I put on?
I thought the ass bones and ribs thing was normal… I’m skinny too.
My grandma always said that I will fly away if it's windy and my teacher said that my legs and arms look like sticks
I cant not dance and im chubby kinda
I have to deal with this and sometimes it's depressing to hear someone say you need to eat your to skinny, or your so skinny you'll break bones  if I flick you.
Relatable all of these except I can dance ( I am very much twig)
Enjoy it while it lasts in no time at all you're going to be trading in your Jord Ash jeans for lard ash!!!!
I’m literally can relate to this on a spiritual level-
Me irl
Today a guy in my class asked if he could have my breakfast, and when I said no he said that I’m skinny so i would probably not eat it anyway.
My grandma calls me skinny Minnie I’m a boy
It's all true
Can't gain weight or muscle
Relatable af
I can’t dance either XD
When the bus driver hits the breaks the air lifts me in the air even when I’m grabbed onto to something 😭
Why does she need to climb on a sink to tell us all this?
Yes true am sooooooo skini
Not being able to dance is a skinny person problem?
Same with chubby people releted to when people say eat less sometimes it's genetic they legitimately can't lose weight like one of family members they sometimes go days without eating and constant exercise and still overweight haven't lost a pound in 2 years even with exercise diet and they even gained a few pounds they got muscle now but still look really overweight because somehow there body won't burn fat off for some reason they've been big sense they was a baby
You dance Jay.
I’ve got so many  punched holes in my belt it’s ridiculous. I even try to eat a ton and yet still barley gain any weight.
Thank you for speaking for us...now I am half fat and half skinny and old.
Relatable
Can relate
I would rather be skinny than fat like me
That last one might be more of a Jayus people problem rather than a skinny people problem. I've seen some skinny dancers out there who've got moves.
That dance 🥵
What do you mean you can’t dance? Sister you were busting those moves and they were fireeeee. 🔥🔥🔥
Well atleast i can eat burgers or anything without getting thic
I know I’m just like you
I’ve never been told to eat a burger or anything but I have been told I do too much physical work and I’m too strong for my age. If you haven’t realised my friends are gamers and spend all of their time watching/ playing games and watching anime😑
Yeah lol. I feel this
YES YES YES SERIOUSLY ALL OF THESE
I am skinny AS FU*K and this is SOOOOO relatable and I guarantee that I am more skinny than you are (62 POUNDS!).
3 is bull  and that's coming from a skinny guy.  3 is all about cold resistance and getting better at just shrugging it off. If not, who cares if you put on an extra layer?
You look great
That last one sounds like a personal problem
Sick moves 😂
I had a cosplay corset on and I got comments on how skinny I was 🥲  Examples: “why do you need a corset, you’re already so skinny” and “wow, that makes you look even skinnier than you already are!”
Preach. I got same 6/6 problems
Agree I’m 11 and weigh 65 lbs but yet still have a gf
I’m actually the same bro like everything else on the list.
Bro, the cold problem is crazily true for me. I stack wood in maine winters and my fingers start to LOCK UP after 50 minutes even with gloves.
Happens to me all the time
You are skinny but so beatiful...I would love to have a girlfriend like you instead any other😂I like you're style and your humor
I don't think you being skinny has anything to do with you being a bad dancer
I'm a skinny guy I can relate to all this
Same
Bro I feel u so hard, cuz at school they started calling me "yellow bone the stick" words hurt!😭😂
Brooo same I'm 6'3 and skinny and all she speaks is Facts
I can relate im skinny as shit and everythin you said is fax
The dancing was horrible sorry to say that
I think the last one is just you...
So, Society has a problem with all shapes and sizes
U dance better then me🤣
I'm 1.74 and weigh like 50 kg. I was skinny from my childhood and into adulthood. Me and skinny go hand in hand. I think that my biggest perk is in summer when I wear all black I don't cook from the inside out(dunno if anyone can relate to that) when it's close to 40 degrees outside. Plus I don't tan in the sun. I'm literally crisping.(pale asf)
The eat something comments want to make me throw up. but as a skinny man ya boy can move
I don't think you can blame being skinny on your dance scene.
How to gain weight? It's easy eat and sleep and repeat just eat and lay on bed and check your phone
The belt is the most annoying
You forgot the fact that when u have a shirt that is the perfect width it is NEVER long enough, it mostly just barely go over ur belt
Omg I am the skinniest kid in my family. I am the second oldest and I am lighter than the youngest in the house
Everything in this video is fax
Pretty sure knowing how to dance has nothing to do with being skinny jayus 🤣🤣
I’m a big fella
jayus: i can’t dance  also jayus: *grooves harder than anyone on earth*
Uhhh my bro is so FUCKING skinned and it seems he pooped his organs out. He is diseased
I don’t think you can’t dance is a skinny problem😭 love the content tho
I can relate to this
Sameeeeeeee
Omg, me too!!
Im super skinny and everyone makes fun of me
Me who eats alot My Metabolism: They say I'm faster than light itself
Having been underweight most of my life, and now finally being overweight, being underweight was waaaaaay worse then being mildly chubby.
Good moves
as an underweight myself, i can relate
SO TRUE
Idk about you, buuuuut those were some sickkkkk a$$$ moves! #dancingwiththestars
I can 100% totally relate to this
Her saying fuck just tops it all off! 😂 I would too if people said that shit to me, if people still do that to you don’t let it happen make sure they know that they are not going to treat you like that! ❤️
I fell you I'm skinny as a snake
Love the dance
When me and my cousin were kids, we were (and to some extent, still are) skinny as fuck. Give us a trench coat , we  could easily pass off as the “Rattle ‘em, boys!” meme.  To this day, if I take off my shirt and look at the mirror, I can see my ribs, but for some reason, I’m pretty comfortable being that way
Still dance better than me XD
I hate everything about this person
I wish i had skinny people problems
THAT'S WHY SKINNY PEOPLE ALWAYS GET COLD! my ex was soooo skinny and he always used me as a personal comforter.
Im the same but lol
Welcome to the club of not been able to dance
Bro im skinny as fuck
She cute though 😍 😌 😛
No seriously though my ass hurts after sitting for like 3 minutes. I have also just given up on belts… I just use a fucking shoelace.
I have D/E cups and literally can never understand how people lay on their stomachs; if I lay down like that for long not only do I feel suffocated, I also get lower back pain
So true
I’m midsize and I can’t dance either I’m very sorry for both of our horrible dance skills
C$C music factory for the win
Heheh I just always get ‘bro you’re so big’ and it’s “a joke” but let’s be real, it hurts
I can’t get weight cause I got a illness  when I was three
This is sooooooo relateble
My mom has some meat on her bones and she's still cold and gets bruises places and still can't dance either
I don’t think just b/c your skinny u can’t dance maybe it’s
Nah man u got the moves 11/10 would party with u
im skinny too and i can relate to this
yes yes this is true
That 'laying on your chest' hit home  When I'm lying in bed watching something in that way and I get up after a while it's like 'Oh my lungs just died and it feels like all my ribs are broken
I AGREE 😃
Quick question why did u feel the urge to stand on the sink to record the video, what is the floor on lava or something?
O I used to get bullied for being skinny
Then don’t lie down like that….and wear a sweater and socks….sit on a cushion…better than being so obese you can’t move or anorexic you also can’t move
Can dance better than me lmao
Im super resistant to cold so I can stop wearing pants IN THE MIDDLE OF FALL and I wouldn't care
I'm a 6'3" dude and I'm 175. I feel your pain
This is so relateable 😭
U remind me of my friend
Best moves ever I wish I could dance like that
This is so relatable! Finally someone who understands! I dunno why I'm underweight cause I eat a hell of a lot more than my younger sister and yet I weigh less
As a skinny person i can confirm all of this
That happening to me too
That was extremely relatable, im underweight and it's scary
I have pretty average legs but my ass hurts like hell if I sit on hard surfaces and idk why. Thought I was the only one
Yes. Yes. Also yes.
Don’t forget hearing “do you know you’re under weight?” Gets tiring real fuckin fast
Relatable.
So i am 10 and very recently my dad called me to fucking skinny and dangerously skinny for my age and this is so relatable none of my clothes fit Any more I can't dance ect
I have the same problem
Uuhhh hahaha I think you should start dancing from the basic move
Pretty good dancing to me
This is actually relatable—
Same
I've been called as skinny as a toothpick before and that i need to drink protein shakes or something to gain weight but I'm at a perfectly healthy weight according to doctors.  I'm just skinny...
This has been my whole life Also that shit is fucked up to say to ANYBODY not just kids
Jayus: I can’t dance! *masterpeice*
Well shit, I'm fat, why can't I be skinny for one day, I'm jealous
She may not be able to dance, but she can be racist
6.4 ft, at my 20s and im only 108 pounds, my highest weight was 123 pounds, go figure how ppl reacted to me.
same problem
Okay, now this is what I’m talking about when people say they wish to be skinny like me and I warn them. Literally every single thing is true! And don’t forget that you can’t sleep on one side even if your mattress is soft af. The bones on one side of my body hurt just thinking about it. Edit: I also forgot to mention what happens when you finally put on some weight. You think that people will be happy for you? Pshh, as if. They’ll tell you that you need to lose some weight, which makes you wish that you were the same as before. That leads to ed and body dysmorphia. Real fun
I got threatened to be snapped like a twog
Really glad to know that I'm not the only one 😂
Y’all soft as a skinny person we’re not going to be like the fat people I better not hear skinnyphobic from anyone
You are a good Dancer
Very relatable! I've always been below average and very small. I think the most I've ever weighed is 105, which after my body metabolized, I dropped back down to 100. Now I've never been very insecure, but it sometimes made me feel like I was just too skinny when my life revolved around people calling me a stick and to eat more food. You can see my spine, I have hip dips, my ribs sometimes show, but at the end of the day, if you're happy and healthy, live your life! The only think I hate about my size is clothes. Sometimes adult sizes are too big, but kid clothes aren't meant for a mature body
All of those are sooo true!
I am skinny becose I have the metabolisms of an fucking pig here are my biggest troubles  1- laying down on anything hard(it hurts to stay only on bones) 2-I bleed from anything(no meat to stop it) 3-I have no but to hold my pants):
I do nothing but eat and I'm still so skinny
The belt one I felt that🤣
I feel like i watched the forbidden when she danced 💀
Dancing ain’t a skinny thing it’s more a having rhythm or a routine or not thing
These are all facts hi I'm a 14 year old that is only 95 pounds- (well it keeps going up and down so--)
I ate 100 wings and I'm still skinny like 👁️👄👁️ WHAT DOES IT TAKE
I used to be 135 pounds at 6'2. Now I am 200 at 6'4. I feel so much better now, I used to relate to all of those :p
Extremely true.
omg, my mum thinks i have an eating disorder because im so skinny, but i eat everything she gives me! i keep trying to tell her that its nothing, but she doesnt believe me. it doesn't help that iv been through some shit
As a fat person I can personally agree that some of these happens too me too but I'm not body shaming I think u look great :)
So sad you were struck with The Misfortune of not being affected by the fake poison food that makes the rest of us overweight unsightly and casted out by Society it must have been so hard for you
My arms are skinny, my torso is fat, and my legs are average, you can imagine the insulation problems. My arms are cold, my legs are comfortable and my torso is scorching.
Im definetly considered obese and cant dance either
I can't dance either!
ohgod i relate to this so much😭
Omg iam 11 iam sooo skinny :o my mom friend always say iam soooo skinny you should eat sooooo much food :,)
oh ur a girl??
Hey I can’t dance either
I think the dancing is a white people problem not a skinny people problem lol
I CAN'T dance
_"If don't like skinny, then go obese"_
As a chubby fellow I don't remember relating to this if I do when I was skinnier but I love seeing or not alone in our self conscious body images
Yes
FINALLY! SOMEONE WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS AS ME😂😂
I feel you on the rib thing
People don’t get that: ITS👏GENETICS👏 I 👏CANT👏 CONTROL👏 MY👏 BODY.
It us
I don't want this to sound wrong but she dances like Chandler Bing And it's honestly so funny
I mean most of the shit that you mentioned aside from getting cold is also true for fat people like me
Bruh, you'll dance circles around me.  This comment was made by the Dad Bod Gang.
I’ve never related to a video so much in my life. I’m 6 3 and I weight 112-115 and I’ve been working in pizza places around Oklahoma for the past 2 years my coworkers are almost always like “put some meat on your bones” “eat more”  Bruh I be eating close to 5000 calories per meal I’m a fatass in a skinny body
Amazing I never fully understood the correlation between me not being able to dance and me being perpetually skinny for my entire life. But I understand I am skeletor and I am proud of that
Love ya
True!!!!!!!!
Omg most relatable shit ever. I am 49 kgs and 21 yo!! How did you gain to reach a considerable weight? ( like she's gonna answer 😐)
Those were some pretty dope dance moves
i get the comments from my parents a lot.. it’s definitely hurts but the fact that i’ve gotten used to them is not so great. i still get comments from people at restaurants and other people 😅😅
I'm skinnier than you and I can dance but yes I do get those comments off and I'm only 10
Are you a girl or boy??
The "your so skinny I hate you" all my childhood and young adult life messed me up.
I’m super skinny and I don’t get cold that fast lel
I understand this and till this day I’m really skinny and I would always get insecure about my body because people like make fun of us and sometimes I feel embarrassed because my mom would say “GO EAT MEAT!”
When you ain't fat/cubby nor skinny: ✨BOTH OF THE PROBLEMS ✨+ being short!
Ok for that dance segment you owe me monitor cleaning wipes.
Can't gain wait fast matabloism
I cannot even relate enough to this... thank you for the video 🥰
This is the most relatable video-
I have the same problems and it fucing hurts my mom keeps telling me to eat because my ribs show and I’m a child and it’s like asking a kid to bring them god but you can’t because it’s impossible and I eat everyday but I’m still skinny
Worry not Jayus, i am fat and i don't know how to dance either
It’s nice to know that skinny people have problems too
The pants problem is so annoying, because I could find them good length but it would be 3 times as wide as my hips
I'm not even underweight anymore (yay thyroid meds) and i STILL freeze 24/7
Do one for the opposite, for overweight people.
Im almost exactly the same
Exactly how I feel. I'm like that.
Alright Debra Morgan.
I wish to be as skinny as you xD
We can’t say slim to the slim  Fat to the fat guy  Death is the only option in my mind
*I Grew Up Skinny Too But The Different Is Between Me N You I Grew Up Poor, You Gotta Nice Suburban House N Allat You CAN Pay For Food N A Personal Trainer N No Longer Be Skinny, I Didn’t Have Any Of That Growing Up So It Was All Trial N Error Till I Became An Adult N Moved Myself N My Family Outta Poverty So Ion Wanna See No One Complain About How Fat Or Skinny They Are, Just Workout N Eat N Sleep As Good As You Can With What Ur Financial Status Allows You To Do🤡*
Only Janus I have a med I have to take Bc of adhd and I experience the same thing
100% accurate
Same
the ribs one is so true I can't even breath when I lay down like that-
I can relate
Reminds me of my sister
I have the first 3 problems
I don’t think the dancing part has anything to do with being skinny just a thought could be wrong though.
To be honest, when I was super thin, I took the comments with pride. I showed off how much I could pull my belly in. I was amused when people asked me where my organs went.
I can relate to this
Im skinny too. Onlu recently have I finally started gaining weight after having my son lol. I confirm this video is true.
Can relate to all of these
U can't dance because ur whiter than milk trust me my aunt and me feel that pain
I have olmost ol dose problems exept the last i am a prity good danser
I can completly relate The funny part is when people aski if i dont eat and when we eat together i probably eat 3 times as much as them but nah those calories go straight through and on the other side out
Yep. This is how humans have lived since the dawn of time. Go to hell fatties
Finally somebody understands
You are perfect just the way you are beautiful ❤️
thank you. soneone understands my pain
You can dance
I know being skinny can be hard but being a 164lb, fat young teen is pretty bad as well. Teen clothes who? I can only wear women’s. I guess they both have their downsides
Ooo lord… I uhm… gotta make some phone calls but I don’t know their numbers and shit😂. Besides, I know at least some bulked up and got jacked; so that’s a plus. But I called my friends “pencil arms” cuz it looked like their damn arms were nothing but skinny arms and connective tissue. Of course, I was a fat bean pole cuz I wasn’t skinny, but I’m tall. Shine a light down and I was a light pole in the fog…  Teasing was cool, but moments like this make me reflect on whether or not it made me shape their perspectives negatively
I started losing weight (I've been overweight)  And I was like ... Oh
I can relate to all of this especially 4, but I started gaining more wait in the third grade :)
Same with me
I am skinny to and I eat a lot and everyone says do you eat
She looks cute dancing.
To Ezy
"Oh my God, I'm so jealous of your family's metabolism" meanwhile my brother's metabolism is so fast he was starving to death, and now has a feeding tube
Darling you can dance 😤👌
There is nothing  more shitty when these assholes wrap there hand around your arm and they're "OMG my whole hand fits around yours u skinny skinned carrot"
I can relate a lot
My fat ass is always jealous of your body. I wish I am as slimmer as you
i think the last time i was a decent weight was when i still had baby fat, even then i was underweight for a baby.
Me: HOW ARE YOU ON THE COUNTER?! Me: I need to practice to sit on my counter so I scare the crap out of brother.
I wish she wasn’t lesbian.
WHY DO I RELATE AHHHH
I felt attacked when she mentioned poking new holes in your belt
All this is accurate but the last one B) I dance like Michael Jackson’s better cousin
Same
For 5 this literally just happened to me. I was at dinner with visiting family and I ordered a half pound cheeseburger. (For context here, I eat A LOT, regularly) and my mom goes “oh yeah you need a burger”. Like what 🤨 I eat burgers twice a week, it’s not a new thing. Don’t even get me started on the comments when I tried to be a vegetarian. I was successfully one for over a year and then was forced to eat meat again because my parents thought I was unhealthy. I was actually more healthy than I had ever been and gained weight, but no no I wasn’t giving my body the proper nutrients.
Felt. You can't dance if you have no ass. Assless homies 😔.
And the worst thing about being skinny to is also when you work out your muscles barely show 😂
God this is too relatable.
I feel the same thing as you I’m skinny
I am skinny because I train too much and eat not enough.
As I fat person the number 1 issue is being overweight
As if I saw myself😅
Omg! Me too 😂😂
When women complain about clothes size and i just laugh cuz I'm 6'1 and skinny as a scarecrow pole. Swim suit shopping is so fun
Bro people in my old schl told me I look like a toothpick
THIS.
Bruh, in my country being overweight is a beauty standard. Therefore I've met a lot of people, mainly women, say that I needed to eat more to gain weight and curves. And I'd be like, "woman leave me and my perfectly healthy body alone, god".
I'm fat and I can't dance.
Maybe it is a good thing that I’m a little obese lmfao
"do you eat" hurt to hear even just as an example
I feel like the ppl who tell you to eat more just want you to get fatter so they dont feel so fat
I can relate to all of these
My pants either are really loose or painfully tight
You missed cant do situps without a cushion on your back because your spine grinds against the floor
Haha you looked like me when I dance, I'm 6.1 and I'm so skinny. I only weigh 10 stone.never gone over that.sod the fat people who are there to help the skinny people, like me and many other's,
Sooo, i Don't know if Can't Dance is a Skinny person problem😏😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
People saying “eat some food” think skinny people magically gain a ton of weight just like that
Skinny people problems are not as bad as fatphobia.
omg these are way too relatable, i get bruised and cold so easily
Ikr same it's so annoying
as someone that's been extremely underweight to the point I had to go to the hospital and someone who's now a little chubby, you just can't win. clothes never fit, now I can't lay on my stomach thanks to boobies and people will make fun of you regardless
I feel this I'm 6'10 an 24 an 250lbs but when I was 19 an 6'9 I was 150 lbs way underweight for my height the cold sucked sitting down sucked laying on anything that wasn't my back or side sucked intercourse with another skinny person was just pain...
My uncles and aunties would ask me at our Chinese New Year would always say I was so skinny and to eat more And then they saw me eat double a normal person’s amount
That’s so true all of it
Thats true the last one actully every one
My best friend is a skinny bastard who lifts and he wants to gain weight cause stronk and I'm a bigger guy and don't have such weaknesses, so I just tell him to eat more but he's says it's metabolism which is mostly true, but he also can't put away nearly as much as I can. So uhh get on my level.
I'm 5'10 at 13 and VERY skinny and I can agree. All of this is correct
I didn’t know about the bruise thing and felt so bad for you. That must be so painful and tender
It sucks😊
Tell me anything you want but you can dance
Yeah. That sums it up well
I get that shit i eat a ton and i am so fucking skinmy
Eat like a gorila it made me bulky
Well the last one isint cuz of skinnyness XD
Nobody told me but I used to think I would break in half
Their all true lmaoo
All these so true
As a skinny person yes I agree
go eat a burger lmao
There’s nothing wrong with your physique, and also, dancing isn’t a thing everyone can do😂😂. I bet none of the people that made fun of you when you were younger are great Social Media influencers like yourself. Don’t be hard on yourself for no reason Jayus.
I used to have the same prblem but now i eat like more than i did 2 years ago
If you're too much of anything people will bully you, if you're too fat, people will bully you which could end up in anorexia, if your too skinny people will bully you, which could lead to a binge eating disorder, if you're too "curvy" for a guy you'll be bullied (I was bullied for this reason) this could end up in orthorexia. Why can everyone stop making fun of girls and boys who don't conventionally fit into societal standards. I sure as hell don't fit, but I know for sure that a lot of people find my body type attractive as a man, And I look damn good in a dress so STFU
You must have a high metabolism
I think your cute the way you are I wish I was skinny
Yes
I can feel you 😅 Me and you both are skinny 😂 One of my friend ( in girls) is also too much skinny... With same attitude as yours.... Positive attitude its good tho ✨
My every day life in one video. I was never so related to a video
5 is so relatable 😭
clothes never fit anyone in general 🤣
I dont thank ur being skinny is the problem with dancing
I’m the exact same thing😩
As a skinny person I have to wear a belt on slim fit jeans
The thing is i look VERY skinny but i’m actually a little overweight for my age and height. That’s kinda fucked up
I can literally eat a whole pizza and I'll lose weight. I hate it.
Oh here’s a my nick name it’s stick figure or twig
Im sorry i literally thought that you're a sarcastic dude
My mom is 36 and she is 58 kilos 😳
I lost some weight and was super surprised when I would lay on my sides in bed and get bruises on my hips
Yoo how much do you weigh because I am 9 and I am 106poung
Defiantly true.  Especially the comments from society.  One time in middle school in the boys locker room I was minding my own business changing and when I bent over to grab my clothes.  Some kid points out how my spin was visible and how skinny I was.  Like dude just keep those comments to yourself,  they’re rude and make me and people who are also skinning insecure about their body.
Tell me about it. Hey I am still skinny so tell me how to get fat er or what people call healthy
Being a skinny boy is MUCH worst tho...😕
So true
I relate to this so much, no matter how much I eat I cannot gain any weight
Yes i can agree that it is hard to be skinny because I am skinny too
I can't for the life of it can't not relate it is my life
girl i get that cause i’m the same way
I've been overweight my whole life, but recently I've gotten quite skinny. I can agree, ITS FUCKING FREEZINGGGGGGG. ALL MU CLOTHES ARE TOO SHORT FOR ME AND I FEEL LUMPY
I’m skinny too everyone says it
I can confirm being skinny is better than being fat I have experience
You, can dance better than me.
I vibe with this video SOOOOOOO Much. Like seriously, i need 3 layers of clothes to not freeze in AIR CONDITIONING! Frickin AIR CONDITIONING!  And about the clothes, i can never find some, they’re either too small or too big, i can’t even find a fitting shirt nowadays.😩
Good for you nobody cares or asked please stfu and remove yourself from the internet
Same.
I've had some of the same problems
I’m not that skinny but for some reason I can relate to every single thing in the video
Everything is true Take it from a person under healthy weight from age 6 to 11
S A M E
Real. I'm 6" 1 and I've been damn skinny my entire existence
Can't agree on the can't dance part, It's just you- '-'
I'm quite a bit older.. it doesn't stop with the comments.  Until I sit down and eat with people, then they are shocked that I am out-eating them.
i relate to wll of these but the last one
You can dance just fine
I mean id *MUCH* Rather be skinny then fat.
Relatable 🤣🤣🤣
What a fantastic way to give someone a complexion about their weight. How does anyone find this funny?... CANCELLED!
I feel described
Was skinny... Still skinny but my ass bones don't hurts anymore when I sit on hard surfaces...
I hear the “ omg do you eat ? Eat something your gonna blow away in the wind I’m afraid I’m gonna break you “ so much I’m 14 5”4 and 84 pounds
Let's go Brandon !!!
I got the, Put some meat on your bones a lot and saying I should eat more by my whole family
I thought it was bc I was human
I am skinny and i barely have any muscle… now imagine how worried I was when I noticed just how skinny my ex was while I was with her… she was skinnier than me and she ate little as well… and i was worried about her health… really had to talk about it various times til I finally was calm about it
That is some good dancing
Skinny and flat but still kinda cute tho.....
I was born 2 months before my official release date so.... I'm hella skinny it's painful
Bruh go eat a burger
She still is cool af atleast
My husband has this issue & so does our children. I’ve been with my husband 15 years & he has JUST now gotten to 145 lbs & that’s the biggest he’s ever been in his 33 years. Our son is 11 & only weighs 70 lbs. Our daughter is almost 14 & has just now hit 100 lbs. My kids get asked a lot why they’re so skinny, but the one that makes me the most mad is people assuming my husband is on drugs bc he’s so skinny. Just fucking STAHP! 😡 STOP ASSUMING! Sometimes people are just skinny! Damn! 🤬🤬🤬
I can relate to it very much e except the dancing part. Not trying to flex or anything but I'm actually pretty good at dancing.
I feel all of the problems... Suffered them my whole life, only now I too am at a healthy weight. Every belt I've ever bought I had to poke new holes lol
I thought you were just really tall
Wtf was tht Last 😂😂😂😂😂it was so good and funny😂😂😂😂
Ye lol anytime I go somewhere They be like: SHE TOO SKEENEE FATTEN HER UP
“Cant dance” I dont know tf u talking about, those some footloose level dance moves
“I cant dance” and then jayus proceeded to dance amazingly
Sadly all of my fat went to my ass. So yes to all of these, except the tailbone one.
Make a video on how to become fat please I need it
Finally somebody said it I've been struggling with my weight my whole life I didn't hit a hundred pounds till I was 13 and still as a twenty year old man cant get past 120. In highschool we were talking about weapons and rights surrounding them and one of my classmates said they could pick me up and start hitting people with me and Id be considered a weapon. Anyway the end of my rant
Bruv what does society want because I've been thick my whole life and that's not been acceptable too
You look great
So true!!! I have the same problem
As a fat person I have all these problems plus added health problems. Fat does not equal warm in the winter time, it equals more area to get cold
As a fat person, I believe an alliance is in order. Body fat donations. Everyone wins.
My friends continuously tell me to eat more when I tell them I cannot gain weight when I eat
The but bones is soooo accurate
the twig has joined the chat.  (yes, IM LIKE A FRICKIN TWIG)
THANK YOU SO MUCH I FEEL THIS EXEPT THE BELT 🦴🦴🦴
U not being able to dance isn’t because of ur weight lol
Why does @onlyjayus dance like Joey from Friends?
A healthy weight is 664 pounds?
12 years old I still have this problem, been skinny my whole life and I've hade every single one of these problems and more.
Awwww I’m so sorry your life as a skinny person Is so hard. Fuck off.
I think that last one might be more of a you problem then a skinny problem
Finally someone says this!
Oh hey your leg got better! Glad to see you’re okay
You still have moves tho
Welp im skinny but my ass is fat so...
4. put your bet through the wash it’ll shrink  up
Me, who has a fast metabolism: *laughs in relatability*
I feel like i belong to this category and i don't like it. And yes all these facts are true ( exept dancing ) and i hate that i'm so skinny.
This is so relatable, I’ve been trying to gain weight for reasons like this but for some reason my body just said “Nah, not gonna happen”
Omg this is totaly meeee
I m skinny but I eat a lot because I m bored 😶
I’m fat, but with a bony ass…. I feel you on the sitting problem
and then we have those kids at school going "lmfao your so small" as a joke but then im just like "yeahh ahaha" AND THEN THEY PUT THE CIRCLE AROUND YOUR WRIST 😭
I don’t know I think you can dance
you forgot about stubbing your hip bone on on the side of the table
U can hella dance! 😎✋
Still better than being overweight...
Only thing I will ever miss of being at my heaviest is that I could sit on a pointy rock and somehow still be kinda comfy.
persone magre
I have been skinny my whole life too and I'm still skinny and I'm 11 years old and I'm still skinny and I got common till the time that my parents you need to eat well guess what Mom I EAT WHENEVER THE HELL I WANT
(==) am skinny yet well built but as an asian....i have dumb truck....with no explanation
Hold up, ur a girl?! My friend said ur a boy 😂😂😂
Facts I eat but don’t gain anything and I can’t much
Same but at least I'm the fastest in the school running at a speed of 14 mph at age 11 plus im the best with the cold I can stand in 19 degree F without a Jacket or anything easily
🔥🔥🔥🔥Dance🔥🔥🔥🔥
You are skinny but you ain’t cute= that’s what my friend said and I tell you  “ it’s facts”
The last one might just be u
Lol I feel you; finally hit 178 pounds 6,3 height and 300 plus cholesterol. Yes I am working on eating healthier…… stay away from McDonald’s burgers not the way to gain weight
YES. THANK GOD
This is so true😭😭
That's true, I mainly always had a very high metabolism so I have to eat a high amount but still remained skinny. So that's also why I started bodybuilding, so I filled in more now. At least I have an ass too because of the muscle :3. Plus, not being able to dance sounds like a personal issue 😂 I can dance if I want I just choose not to if I don't like that person.
Was that 62lbs or klg??
Dance is not true but yeah    I am soooooo f*cking skinny
I'm the same, so I can relate.
I love that these are all literally the exact opposite problems fat people have...as in sitting down too long hurts our assbones for the opposite reason, the comments we get are the opposite "what did you eat your whole class," and most of us cant dance either...
*nods while crying*
My brother is like this can confirm that he indeed gets cold quickly
I'm in love with you
Eat more shuchi
Can you tell me how to get skinny
Time to *BULK*
Cause you're a boy
i would gladly switch weight with you if it was possible
Get cold really fast?  I’m just permanently cold
Skinny shaming is most definitely real, I’ve been made fun of especially as a kid and that ruined my self esteem and perception about myself as an adult today. It’s really stuff you wouldn’t expect like “you’d break in half in the wind.” “If you got pregnant you wouldn’t survive because ur too skinny” “you have no butt ur all skin and bones.” “How often do you even eat?” “Why are you so small and skinny?” *person puts fingers around wrist to see how skinny it is.*
Especially when the food comment happens you sit their thinking "But I ate like 5 plates of food last night."
I used to be 90lb! I could eat, eat, eat, eat, and not gain pounds. At the age of 25 I ending up with a thyroid disease and gained a crap load of pounds. I am slowly getting my weight down. I am at 180 now. Was 200 few years ago.
Lol same
Felt. My rips cage is actually large compared to my body so they protrude. It is extremely uncomfortable.
I would rather have that than be fat Well I hope one day I get the morivation to actually do something and lose a bit of weight. I am apparently in a healthy weight but the shape of my body would suggest otherwise
im tall and skinny.  170cm and 52kg. I eat as much as I want to. its called fast metabolism and im sure my height plays a huge role in it.  I cant find clothes fitting because the larger the size is. the wider the clothes are. I need time to be longer not wider. that's my issue. not weight :') as in my country. its rare for people to be obese or fat
When I was little my sister used to let me sit on her (like when there were no other chairs) but then she started complaining that my butt was too bony lol. Now I just sit on the floor or on the arm rest. I am always so concerned with my weight, but not bringing it down, making it go up. I finally am happy where I'm at but now my family is very concerned with my eating habits. I usually only get an appetite at 9-11 am and 3-5 pm. If I manage to eat 3 meals than they are small ones.
I appreciate this video so much. And yes, it’s VERY f**ked up to say those things to a kid
Haha you are right, i have these problems too
Whenever i workout and i do the russian twists or something similar where i sit on my ass my assbone dies, hurts like hell after that
FINALLY, THERE ARE OTHERS WHO UNDERSTAND
Dont worry I’m normal sized and I can’t dance either :|
I grew 20 kgs in 18 months. Now I can't even run. I need to loose weight fast
I too was skinny my entire life. Nothing I did put on weight, nothing. I used between meal protein shakes, ate as much as possible without vomiting from too much food. I was harassed for years by fat people for being skinny. All kinds of rude and hate-filled comments. My husband helped me when he told me that fat people demean anyone underweight because of jealousy. He was correct. I do not listen to them anymore and thoroughly support them in their fatness, but not their mean comments about thin people.
As a tall skinny guy, my gawd this is so relatable
I'm skinny too I'm 12 and 4 foot 7 and three quarters and I only weigh 79.6
Almost all of the girls that I go to dance are skinny af, my friend and I are the only ones that aren’t as skinny as them
as a skinny person I confirm this is straight facts
I’m skinnier than you. Mostly cuz I hate muscle cuz it’s too chunkish so I rely on bone strength.
Jayus ur a better dancer than ne
I sympathize, I'm a guy about 5'11" and 130-135 pounds. I am exceptionally fit, exercise regularly and have a pretty physical job so I'm surprisingly strong for my wiry frame. I love the look on people's faces when I heft around car batteries (or hay bales at my old job) with ease lol 😉
Nah them moves are unbeatable
I feel that. I’m skinny too.
Same bro, at least now I know I can blame why I can't dance on being skinny.
Hello! Fellow skinny person! About the “do you eat” thing, most of us eat a month’s worth of food in a week and are STILL hungry after that. We have the metabolism of a fucking wendigo
The first one is so accurate 🤣🤣and the others
Same lol
All of this man I'm still so fucking thin and hella underweight idk how I'm alive lol
YES YES YES I FUCKING HATE SITTING DOWN AND FELLING THE PAIN
I feel this so hard
The same
We are a lot a like
You look great dont let anyone say you're too skinny
I fell your pain
I have a Lot of these problems
I can 💯 relate. I eat massive portions of food like 6-7 times a day yet I stay the same, have to keep reminding people that I have a FAST METABOLISM!!!
Same lmao
As a under wieght person the "eat a burger" is so relatable  I got so angry when someone told me that
Lol it’s weird cause I’m not really skinny per say , but I have a lot of those symptoms
Ik that problem when there was wind rly strong i almost got blew off  I too poor to eat nice
Or letting your elbow on a table and it feel very unpleasant.
I'm ten and I'm so skinny that I can't poosh out my belly
Ahhh so is that why I get bruises on my ribs
Wow.... I really want to take her home to meet my family........as long as she doesn’t talk.....omg...can you say trash mouth
she’s talking straight up facts here. i’ve also been told ‘ i would love to be that skinny, you should be grateful’ okay sorry jessica. but i hate the fact that you can literally see my ribs😭
You can dance just not good
I'm so tired of people saying "jUsT eAt" like it's not that easy.... Some of us quite literally can't go up even though we eat alot.. And others can't eat cus we have eating disorders. So please don't tell a skinny person to "just eat more" cus that can really hurt our feelings..
THANK👏YOU👏
I relate to you so much so, it brings me nostalgia from my somewhat ‘horrible’ childhood.🥲
I know this problems🥲
I eat the most out of everyone in my family and I'm still the skinniest and all of these are relatable especially the dancing one
Bruhh why were you standing on sink
how tall are you?
YAS #3 is SO TRUE
Yep
#fatgang
I really think being skinny is better then being fat i m not even fat im 5'6 and i google it what the weight should be being 5'6 its 70 kg for boys im im 71 kg  And my fucking school weighted us for no reason  now my classmates didnt give a shit My fucking teachers started harassing me embracing me everyday they saw me they were like Omg your 71 kg your so fat I told to my parents  Now im going to new school
Facts
I’ve been super skinny most of my life and the only problem I had was the sitting down and laying down. Pants aren’t much of a problem though, if you get the adjustable ones.
7. Parents/friends ask at least once:  "Have you taken any drugs?" lol
I got some chubs to donate, hun.
Don't let people tell you anything I love your videos
I get u
Lmfao!!! I feel you
She got better moves than me
My butt bones hurt after like 20 minutes and it’s so uncomfortable
Does dance moves are better than mine
My family thinks I'm weird for keeping the thermostat at 75 degrees I got no insolation people
I hate when people just bring up your weight. With fat people it's normally people you know. But when you're skinny it's like the first thing they notice when they meet you.
The thing is that I’m skinny as hell to
I can relate, i get cold easily and i have to put holes in my belt.
Im chubby. Heres a couple problems. I refuse to go in a pool (obviously). Whenever i hear a squeak when I seat on a couch i want to kill myself I cant dye my hair (i would look like an Sjw). I feel embarassed just Wearing stuff like tank tops beacause i look like i beat wifes. I feel guilty as heck when I eat something fried. Underwear looks tight
Just because your skinny doesn't mean you can't dance... Well I'm skinny and I can't dance either but that's just me. (Yeah this has to be the most relatable video I have seen from her)
If only I had these problems
I'm a chubby girl. The thing with our society is they don't let us live no matter what. What I'm trying to say is if you are skinny they'll say "omg you are so skinny, do you eat" and if you are chubby/fat they'll go" omg you are so fat you need to skip meals,or how much do you eat?" Society doesn't let you live peacefully.And I feel cold easily so when I say I'm feeling cold people say "but you are fat how come you feel cold?? Fat people don't feel cold easily" everything is f**ed up. I have experienced all this so I'm telling.
Adults and two kids told me that I need to eat more because I need to put on weight yesterday 😐👍🏼
8 have the same problem
That belt one hit a home run
As someone who has been both fat and skinny.. its actually easier to dance when your smaller. Your more agile
I think the dancing part is all you
OMFG THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS. IM 14 AND I'VE BEEN SKINNY MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE IS POINTING THIS OUT BECAUSE I CAN RELATE TO EVERYTHING YOU SAID IN THIS VIDEO. THANK YOU!!!  Also i also cant dance lol
That last one is just because you're white not skinny lol
:)   IM FAT
Thanks for telling me that it’s okay to be fat jayus.
Eat and lift Weights  Tadaaa..
Wait died this mean I'm skinny I get everything you get so- am I skinny
I am very skinny and tall, every person on my school calls me slenderman and now i qm poular for it
It’s just metabolism she eats but it don’t work    It’s gonna workout sooner or later
omg uve told me nmy life
Haha all of these are the same as my problems. Thanks for the belt tip tho
Well at least «skinny» isn’t the go to insult worldwide. Srsly u travel anywhere and someone wants to insult ppl, they usually call ppl fat.
KPOP idols changing then dance situation
Skinny as f boi here, I got what u mean
Oh wow I’m very high up in the weight category for my height, but I always get cold. And can’t dance 👯
So I'm skinny now?
will never forget getting asked "why are you so skinny are u anorexic" in the locker room  in 7th grade -_- like damn u just learned that word and your already coming for me.
You dance better than I do 😊and im bigger that's not a skinny person issue 🤣
You dont know how lucky you are. I have an enormous desire to eat everything. But now I have to stop doing that for an year to regenerate my liver. I am doing cardio and bodybuilding. I can run for 2h and eat 4 apples and I am just fine. If I eat a cake I get fat for 3 weeks.
I hate being skinny.
as a skinny person, i have always been so confused how my mom gains weight so fast like- wthh
Ive been really skinny too and once my friend said "Roz you're too skinny you need to eat more"
i relate to all of these but i don't see myself as skinny lol. maybe it's just me though because my mum always goes on about my weight
Naa the cant dance one is just cause ur tall and not talented lol
No lies in this video
Don't think many Americans have a problems with being too thin
Related to all of them
The fact they dance better than me
You kinda look like love from you
Being fat is a lot harder and many people give comments to fat people and not thin people so all the people who used to be fat or are fat please open up and tell what all comments people gave you
You look like one of the Hansen brothers
Eat a sandwich or two.
Fat people thought they had problems. 😂🤣
yoo wtf u were like over 6 foot at 12?
This is true🕴️ Cuz I have experienced all of it and am still experiencing it now 😊
Stop whining, being skinny is way better than being thick
Much rather have these problems than heart disease you should feel glad
As a skinny Ican totally relate and thats why I like wearing baggy clothes♡♡
Was a skinny lad up until 13, fast forward an addition 6 years at the time of this comment and I've now got a dadbod. Feel a lil insecure about it, but I'm not here to please people with my looks. I'm just here to live my best life. Unnecessary comment, I know. But sometimes, people grow into their genes. By the way, better dance moves than what I got.
I think that last one is an everybody problem
Don't let the dance thing happen again
Unusually relatable 😭
"Can't dance" Pretty sure that isn't just a skinny people problem...
Why tf is YouTube recommending me OnlyRacist? 🤮
I have shoes just like theirs-
I'm skinny, but I eat like there's no tomorrow
I've been skinny my whole life too. I fire back when people comment on it. Oh I'm skinny?  Thanks Karen, why are you 200 lbs overweight? Oh you didn't like that comment?  Me either.
Ok but fat is worse than skinny.  At least you don't get winded tying your shoes.
That some nice moves
You are so beautiful and sweet you are not ugly
Yo the dance is lit lol 🤣🤣🤣
I get so cold so fast to
That's so relatable I've been thin my whole life and I eat as much food as I can.
Im skinny and i won divisional level of dance sports
Smh
I have the same problem
Iv gotta be honest people shouldn't be ashamed on what they look like don't let the media change who u r like I'm skinny the cold doesn't effect me at all etc.
The whole can't dance thing us more of a white people problem
I'm 12, and this all applies to me. People don't realize that the same you can fat shame people, you can skinny shame them too.
The last one is so trueeeee
Fuck I need this woman on my life 😆
I RELATE TO THESE. but I'm def fat
Jayus is perfect 😁
I way 2 more pounds than you but I am more skinnier than you
This dude complains more than a chick
That’s me
TFW-you wish you had these problems
I cha girl I am like 10 to 15 kg below a health weight for my age
Well Im skinny but I only get 3.99 euros a day for food ;(
I'm skinny but I can dance no hate
Why do you look like that you were having a seizure but I hope you are okay I'm trying my hardest to not laugh Idalou shouldn't be laughing but it's hilarious when you still can't dance did it look good tragedy to Funky Chicken along with doing the robot
Someone: you need to eat more Me who eats 2-3 plates of food: the fu-?
brooo im 6'2 and 140lbs ive dealt with this shit my whole life. one day i was high af and someone said the ole "have u even ate anything this entire week?" and it just came to me and i said "yeah ive been eating ya moms box all week i guess ur right i should get some real food in my stomach" and ever since that comeback came to me, i just WAIT for people to say that dimb shit 😂
I dance like that too, but does being skinny have anything to do with dancing? 🥲 Oh yeah and the bones on my elbows hurt so bad when I lay down on the ground after like 5 seconds
Last ones on you XD
That’s how I am
I’m skinnier
Hun I don't think being skinny is the reason you can't dance lol
Can relate people says I'm too skinny but I eat alot of food
This is extremely relatable like when I sit down to eat I need to sit on a pillow or else it will hurt.
I have a fast metabolism so I dijust food faster and I cant gain weight
Every body tell me that i am skiny cuz' i don't eat, but when they see how much i eat got f*cking SCARED.
This is so true
Hahaha I would still dance with u because u are cool 😎 and those dance moves probably don't look good on that many people
I was skinny basically my whole life even though I eat a lot like basically after every basketball practice I would eat like 2-3 cups of rice and then sleep but I just couldn't gain weight but then covid came and meh... That fixed the problem for me now I am fat af...
I Dunno, better moves then me
I relate sm to this. Literally my whole family is like "do u eat?" And lots of stuff like that :')
FINAALLLLYYY!! A TIK TOK MADE FOR ME 😭🤌🏾
Idk those dance moves are pretty on point
Id rather be skinny than jiggle every time i take a step
Ayo same👍
When people call me skinny it makes me think that’s is the same as calling someone fat and is kinda offensive as I’m trying to gain weight
I weighed like 54 lbs when I was I think 8 or 9 or maybe 10. I weighed 60 pounds at 12. At least I could (and still can) say I AM THE WEIGHT LOSS SYSTEM.
AHHAHAHAHAHAHA YOUU SOOO CUTEEEEEEE
I'm not even skinny but my belts don't fit either 💀
Me😭
Got the "Do you even eat?" and "Go eat a sandwich!" type comments all the time all the way through childhood and my teens, I ate nearly double what anyone else my age would be eating just because I was constantly hungry but was still super skinny. That however meant I'd also get the "I wish I could eat as much as you and be so skinny" type comments which hit even harder because I deadass was a beanpole trying to look less like slender man 😅
66 pounds that's not good
Me to
Me who has skinny af body but idk how a chubby face tf
As a skinny pearson that weights 50 kg for most of my life I can confirm that these are true.
I am skinny too 😩 And I also have these problems right now
Awww. I love your cool dance 😊 but yeah, society is really problematic on both sides on the scale. But as long as we are somewhat healthy and happy , size does not matter 😊
This is so true 😭
Try being gay and fat
Why the most relatabke thing here is dancing?
OK I can 100% relate
I'm really skinny and i am like a twig :(
Uk whn ppl call me skinny, I usually like it lmao, I actly dun mind it
All for views
As a skinny dude, this is facts I still deal with negative comments about being skinny on a regular basis, society kinda sucks
Im not really skinny but I still can't dance and I always get cold easy
I'm not as skinny but definitely
To everyone who wants to do somethings against being skinny, ask for help from professionals. You will realize if you have no disease causing you to not gain weight you will have way more success with a bulking diet. Great foods in great amounts lead to much better succes. Even with calorie surplus tons of chipa and shits wont help you. I hope this helps at least someone.
I feel this so much, only just started to get any weight to hold on my body at 22, and I'm now a healthy weight, spent most of my life being underweight and could never gain anything no matter how I tried. Cant say I know about the laying down one but I never really lay down much
You look like a girl before now just like a 27 old man crackhead.
Kpop idols seeing this video :  👁👄👁
I'd rather have this than get bullied for being cute
Atleast skinny people can use their brown adipose tissue for heat production
I'm 18 and I weight 45 kgs and I'm a dude so I know the pain
I'd have the best childhood if you were my older sister It'd be soo kool
Skinny people have the least problems. They’re healthy and don’t have to pay any medical health bills because they’re in perfect good health unlike fat people who are depressed and in dept because of medical bills 😂😂😂😂
I ready disliked the video   What about you?
Oh, so uhh you’re a girl ? :0
GOD I KNOW THIS IS SO ACURY
Not being able to dance isn't a skinny problem its a people problem 💀💀
Last one is just cause U white
My ex was 165cm tall and weighed 46kg
You can dance. Just terribly 😢
This is completely a false accusation. Skinny people can dance. They’re are a lot of skinny people out there who can dance. Not all skinny people get cold easily. Some people wear sweaters / a lot of clothes just to wear them. Not because they’re cold but Bc they can handle the weather and for no reason really.
Jay trust me being gordo is not any better
Oh jayus  I love your videos they're the best ❤️❤️
"Why do you always wear a jacket?"  Makes me look thicc and plus its cold even when the sun is shining
I can confirm
Well, her weight just made me doubt myself...
I’m so glad someone assessed this!! I remember someone asked me: so what do you want different in your body? And I said I wanted to gain weight (I had gained enough weight to not be underweight, but I was scared I would lose weight) And she looked at me and said: but your soooo skinny.. everyone would love to be as skinny as you…  And like- we were 11-12.. Every since that moment I feel bad about my body 🥲👍🏼
Damn the assbone one is too damn true as well as the cold one
A fellow skinny person
We're not Skinny , we're not fat
I'm in obese person. And I can relate to every point. But obviously on the opposite side of the spectrum. Being too skinny and too fat is not good for you.
Someone said it! I don't feel alone 😭 especially with the sitting problem. It's the opposite problem as people who feel like they are too big to sit in people's laps. I NEED SOME CUSION! For both our sakes 😂
Preach the facts
I relate to this good thing my hf says shell feed me till i explode but jokes on her even at 18 years old ill never get to 107 pounds her fatting me up will never work and the cold thing i hate the cold i turn blue every time i go outside
I mean there’s gotta be a weird diet for the twig people in the world to at least turn them into branches….
You said you can’t dance? Are you kidding me I honestly you make me want to say “you can dance if you want to” cause you got the moves.
Tbh same
dancing thing is soooo much cap
SAME RELEAITBLE
Skinny , but really pretty. The more natural look is beautiful. I can't stand all the face paint nowadays. It's cool every once in awhile but everyday , or 2 hours throwing war paint on to hit the gas station is ........umm a massive waste on time lol
Apparently somehow everyone thinks they are skinny now I. The comments
Most peaple can't dance
U dance better than me xD
My cousin is the skinniest guy EVER. Even if he got the entire McDonald’s menu he would probably still be skinny.
I don’t like how you carry yourself as a female 😐
Ive been skinny my whole life. (60kg or so) And at some point I was tired of it and started eating to gain weight. Now Im not skinny anymore because I weigh 100kg 😂 prefer it this way so much more. The fat jokes are much better than u need to eat something. I already ate like a machine when I was skinny sorry my body works like that.
Dude I’m too fat
Just be in caloric surplus
Can confirm
I can relate to every single one
Skinny people problems 🥲 I can relate to all of them except the pants and the belt. 😂
Pants with the right waist are to short and vice versa
Also been skinny my entire life, these are all true and I can relate 😂😂
As a skinny person my entire life i relate to basically all of these, more of number 5 because my entire family teases me on my weight telling me i am going to just fly away like mary Poppins if i carried an umbrella
It suck
Yeh ok but you're really cute so there's that😎
I am short myself and i can confirm this
Also it’s almost impossible for me to gain weight. And tasers hurt a lot more
I’m also really skinny, but for me the being cold one is the complete opposite. I don’t get it😐
are you a girl or boy
Look jayus... I was in fifth grade. I was 29 kilos. Normal weight was 41 at that time. I am still siinny AS FUCK I know your ptoblems. We share problems. Have a good day!
Im both skinny and tall, not only do one of my pairs of sweatpants not fit me, they come up more higher passed my ankle
Can't relate cus I'm pretty built Funny story: I'm in 8th grade and pretty short (5'7) but people are terrified of me cus I am really strong. They told me that when I tackled someone in soccer, let's just say that was A bad day for that person
I too am skinny
To the 1000th degree agree! My butt hurts so much yet laying on my stomach stops me from being able to breathe. Uuuuughhhh!
I know your fucking pain
As an overweight person I get cold easily too, I'm not sure why but I'm guessing its because of my skin disease that caused this sort of weak sensitivity?
hmm...I like her.. literally my type...but meh it won't happen still great content
When people are talking about making you eat more meat to “put some meat on your bones” buddy, I eat a shit ton of meat and veggies and am still skinny as fuck, shut up and stop body shaming me
Ar l
Enjoy it while it lasts!
“do you eat?” “you’re just skin and bones.” “you’re so picky.”   the one that’s stuck with me for a while was something an uncle of mine said while visiting from out of town, i came out of my room to come see him (which i rarely do, i don’t like greeting family because most of them are complete dickheads to me) and the first thing i hear him say is: “what is THAT?”   i went back into my room and cried a little bit.   saying these kinds of things to skinny people hurts. yes, i know i don’t look healthy. yes, i know you can see and feel my bones. i’m *trying*. i’m not picky on purpose. and even when i do eat, i have a fast metabolism so it gets burned away quickly. i’m sorry i’m not fat like the rest of my family, uncle andy.
Last one is just you
Brooo honestly though🥲
Ummm well I was skinny my whole life AND ITS TRue u get cOLD Like IN ONE SEcOND
This is so true, except the dancing part. And I honestly wanna become a model cause of this. My friends use to tease me, when it was windy they went " omg someone hold her she will fly" 😭
After making myself laugh way to much after watching the end I’ve decided to make this comment….. *teach me how to be skinny….I need it desperately- can’t deal with my whole family calling me fat anymore*
My class mate/bff was bullied by the "famous girl"on class thar happen when i was grade one she said that do my bff only eats once a month
Ya Dat I have
Still got better dance moves than me
the best one I've ever experienced, is someone in a completely unironic manner asked me if I run marathons, lol, I was like nope, im just skinny
Everyone talking about being skinny:    *ME TRYING OUT TO FIND JAY GENDER AFTER 2 YEARS OF DENIAL*
This is so relatable, especially because of my eating disorder and my fast metabolism
Ok how are you skinny you are like a stick but I'm over here as fat as pig
🤣🤣🤣 your still cute tho..
Me who chub haha suckeerssnsndbbfxnbz
I have a skinny friend and I sometimes wish to look like her 😔 but she’s really skinny no matter how much she eats she still skinny
This gal speaks facts...
FELT THIS
Isn't this the girl that said the n word if so then your a idiot
I mean I see those moves
Try being over weight. It’s like this but opposite and 20x worse
I can relate
"I can't dance!"  **Turns into a Just Dance NPC**
As a skinny person I can relate of this, i literally have to buy 13 year old clothes and receiving comments from people since 6 years old
Just wait til 30 its the age almost everyone get mor weight and btw  If you are long and skinny your pants are so wide
I sad thing is, if she was like a D cup. Theyd flock to her like a bear to honey.
I fond you so cooll like damnnnn haha love your vidss by the way yy
“I cAn’T dAnCe” *proceeds to bust a move
Im not a good dancer but thanks for making me feel amazing with that movement
Oh my goodness somebody can relate to me finally all of these are true
The poking new holes into a belt is too real
No ass, no chest.  I feel you.
that dance at the end made my day
I can agree I'm skinny
The cold one is so fuckin relatable
I agree😭
As a fat person you also have struggles but you wont break in half in the wind and wont get cold as fast
Still a better dancer then me
buy a mechanic belt
I can confirm as a skinny person myself
I mean ur better at dancing than me tho that’s not hard to achieve😂
"Thats a fucked up thing to say to a kid"  Yep, a kid and that is absolutely true
My grandma would always tell me the wind was gonna blow me away but I know the feeling on every one of these except the bruises on my ribs thing And I eat so much food it isn’t funny
For me laying down hurts my chest in the middle
The blue plastic chairs they have in school were not made for skinny people 😭
Ɏ₳ɏ?
Fully agree... as a kid I was eating adult size meals bec I was trying to gain weight.. family, friends, random ppl was worried I dont eat/dont finish my meals. (Now a days they put food in my face I'll finish it so fast they didnt even finish half of theirs) For anyone's information my basic meal is 3-4 burgers or about 6 tacos, 1 and a half large pizzas.. @.@ I eat or I consume?
Nah you just ain't got no rhythm
Can relate this is all true
I have been skinny just like you
Thats why im working out, im still skinny but im getting there, 142 pounds at 5'7
No one, me: who eats almost every 1 hr ,and still skinny... I'm 18 and weight like 35KG lmao... also my snack is rice... haha
Worst part is, I've gotten skinny-shamed and fat-shamed before and honestly it fucking sucks because I'm at 107 (been trying to gain more weight) and I still get told I need to eat more but not too much
Peter is that you?-
i'm opposite and i can tell ya that that has some problems too
Glad I’m not skinny
Skinny people can't dance Meanwhile blackpink lisa Dancing like god
I think you’re beautiful just the way you are 🔥
I love jayus so much, she is so cool, i wish i could be her friend
I know the struggle 😅😭 it suck’s
I don't care about skinny, I  just want to be taller😂🥲😕
The fact jayus is not afraid of getting copy write
The last one killed me😂😂, and no Chloe I can't DANCE!!
I don't think the dancing thing is because you are skinny...
I agree I’m 6’6 and I’m about 165 and it kind of sucks a little bit 😂
Same
My metabolism has slowed down so now I’m actually starting to get a little belly in my teens/early twenties I’d put away a 22+ slice pizza and still want dessert
As a fat person, sitting down still hurts my ass so I'll take the skinny any day xD
This is soo much relatable..it's like whatever I eat disappear before reaching my stomach 🤷🏻‍♀️
"i cant dance" my limbs are so heavy i cant even move them
Same with me it’s sad
My dad wants to know your location
Pretty sick dance skills🕺 I weigh 85 lbs and I'm skinny to where i can see my ribs.
Me who can relate to this
Better than me dancing
My mom can't dance either
Finally someone else gets it. 😂🤦‍♀️
Bro I'm skinny and I relate soo much to it 😭😭😭 ....I always try to gain weight but I can't 🤧🤧
As a person who has been "severely underweight" since 6 years old, this is facts
OMFG This cracked me up because it’s exactly! EXACTLY what it’s like!
she's flat as fuck
Lmao same
I'm FKING 60.4
EVERYONE can dance❣️Just enjoy yourself❗️( it’ll warm u up too!)
as a person whose been fat my whole life I cant relate at all to this
Although my friend is the skinniest person ever and also the best dancer ever.
Lol
I'm skinny as too and shit I can only lay down on my back bc it hurt to lay down any other way
Ok nobody can dance😂🤣😂🤣
in 3rd grade my teacher told me that if the wind blew a little I'd fly off into the sky
I have a lot of these problems (fast metabolism and running cross country doesn’t help)
Thought this was a dude...
Winter season: Me at 125 lb. being slightly irked at being cold most of the time  My 110 lb. sister literally moody all winter, complaining about how freaking cold it is both inside & out
I agree
Last ones a white people problem
I've had the "get meat on your bones" commebt so much and honestly, it rubs me the wrong way. Like- Yes I'm clinically underweight by a few pounds, but it's not your problem
As a skinny person that's facts
I feel this
Don't try and blame your ability to not dance on your weight!
664 pounds?
Nice moves
Everybody gangsta till you do eat the bird.
I WAS ALWAYS SO SINNY THAT ONE TIME SOMEONE CALLED THE POLICE CUZ THEY THOUGHT THAT MY PARENTS WERE NoT FEEDING ME
That "sitting down hurts my ass bones" is frustratingly relatable
Can’t dance thing seams more like a white thing.
So relatable 😃😌
Facts
I guess we're the same:)
Says can’t dance bust out moves that I been tryna pull off since middle school
This is damn true i eat alot but never put on weight like at all and the getting cold bit is so damn true as well
I'd still hit 😈😂💯💀💨
I'm very skinny and I have Dem problems
Well at least you not fat as a cow like me and you pretty
SO FIN TRUE
If i'm sitting in bed for too long my bones hurt
I agree
Oh my goodness I'm dying this is so true my mom would say I'll blow away
As a skinny bone I can agree people tell me to eat more, that's the problem I eat more then my friends.
I feel the same way but I can dance🤣🤣
Us skinny people can't just get meat on our bones
Yesssss!!!!!! Literally
my brother faces all these all the time...especially everyone badgering him about food
WE ARE THE SAME PERSON I FEEL LIKE THAT TOO,IN THE WIND I FEEL LIKE I WILL BLOW AWAY AND PEOPLE SAY THAT
I eat like a mofo and I'm still skinny af. Not even with a nutritional plan I can gain weight
being skinny and a guy is a terrible combo. You are expected sooooo much more to be “strong”. And yes that shit is fucked up to say to a kid
Im 9 and im have 55g
"I can't dance" that has nothing to do with being skinny, I know people who are in the ideal margin of overweight and skinny and they can't dance even if their life depends on it
Never tell someone clearly underweight they're lucky to he that skinny.
I was so sinny i can see my rib cage one time
Bro I’m not skinny and I’m always cold 😂

The pants/belts problem is the worse for me. All the other ones I can totally live with them, but the belts? Not even the damn belts holding up my pants so it won't fell down every three steps I take? No... Not even belts helps...
I got stoped by a school consoler because I wore a t-shirt and he thought I didn't eat.
I’m called mr.stretch, it’s terrible
Oh so it's good that I'm kinda fat
one of the worst things honestly— you say something about any of those and you get:  “oh my god you’re not allowed to complain you’re skinny stop it” I AM ALLOWED TO IM NOT “IN SHAPE” IM UNDERWEIGHT SHUT. UP.
I agree and yes I do have Chunk but like I’m skinny!!
I'm also pretty skinny 🤠 but I think I'm the best at dancing in our friend group
Imma guess really fast metabolism I have a metabolism of a race car and I can't gain weight for nothing I'm full grown and I weigh about 128 pounds
3rd one is a lie
Yo mine is terrible because I can’t gain weight due to my high metabolism
Fucking oathhhh. I've only just recently hit 60kg which is so unhealthy for a 17yo male 😭
Being skinny has nothing to do with the fact you can’t dance
The last one isn't a skinny person problem that's just that you problem 🤣
Sad that this is so true
This is fucking stupid
Dam the 80's want there dances back
Hey arent you the racist person
Same
I feel all of those
me sitting here with 3 blankets and a hoodie on: yep, definitely cant be warm. (I also have an iron issue so yay, extra cold /lh)
I only weigh 116 and I've weighed that since Middle school 🤣 can relate. I've slowly gained weight though. like 4 pounds that'll burn in a day
im a skinny person but can dance lolol
I'm Skinny but I can dance :')
damn I could relate to all this before lockdown and I wish... I could go back to that time :(    Sick dance moves tho... teach me senpai?
SO TRU BTW
IM ALSO SO SKINNY I EAT A WHOLE BUNCH AND I WANT TO BE FAT BUT I CANT
They use to call me anorexic all my friends it really hurt
My isolation so low I go to 40-50c and say ah nice weather out here
"Can't dance" I respect your opinion but you're wrong. You have some great moves.
I’m obese and tall, I also CAN ABSOLUTELY NOT dance
A like for ur dance
im a fat 10 yaer old neitehr can i
I act skinny but I'm not
Cuddle a fat boy. Or date a bigger dude
She dances better then me 😶
So what’s the problem
Tell me about it
10/10 so true
Man these are so true, like I've been that way for as long as I can remember
66 is not healthy
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
You like a guy
Me getting cold after being at the park for half an hour:
Sometimes I wear weights outside because I'm afraid I'll fly away in the wind.
At least you can wear any pants, all u gotta do is tighten it in some ways. For bigger people it's hard to find cute big clothes
It’s worse if your fat tho so you lucky
İm a one skinny boi
Lol Id still take all that over having to eat a quarter of the daily recommended calories just to not be considered overweight
The dancing part if it’s crazy free style you would win
I agree I can relate to almost all of those
I'm a skinny person I'm literally cold 247
Yah the last one dancing happens to be a white person thing
I've been 140-150ish my whole life. I've recently got into bodybuilding and gaining weight is a STRUGGLE!!! I def feel ur pain
Idk if u can tell but bitching about being skinny is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. Just try being fat for 1 day and see what real problems r. The only thing more absurd would b bitching about being white (which I've actually heard ppl do) unbelievable
Still no matter what it's still got some good dancing moves👍
if i didnt have fast metabolism i would be as fat as a fucking elephant
I understand lol
I am skinny and approve of all of these except for the last one i just don’t dance
i have the exact same fucking problems
#6 sounds like a you problem 🤣
You can’t dance because your white not because you’re skinny
Don't worry as a fat person dancing is a bit difficult as well
Yep thats accurate 😭

I love how she dance ✌️
Yes.. it's true but I can dance
I question why this is a problem
Yes i feel this its all true 😂
My brother is skinny and my dad says “Go eat a burger.” He does. Then it comes out the other end.
Yessir u can dance like a Queen
SAME THOUGH
“I CANT DANCE”
Your right on the dot ngl
I had a friend like this, and I was the fat one. Can confirm that these problems seem like nothing to a fat person
Heyyy I have been skinny my whole life too and i always. Have to wear a belt and I dance
You think chunky people can dance
Once moves 👍
Bro all that shit happened to me and it sucks
As a skinny person, I relate, especially with the “Do you eat?”
the shoes in the house-
I eat like an animal and i am still super skinny '-'
Sorry but the last one is your fault
Im skinny and i get cold if im inside but if i am outside in 50 degree weather shortsleeves and sweatpants is fine  Also about the society thing my parents (dad) did the opposite, making fun of me if I had 3 or more courses of a meal I liked by telling me to lift up my shirt and turn to the side so he could see my belly  Now I cant wear anything tight and if I eat more than 2 servings I get reslly upset and remorsefull
Watchu talkin bout u a great dancer :D
What about the constant pain from bumping into stuff a little too hard?
I can relate
Nah you can dance perfectly fine keep being awesome
15, 30 kg. It’s really easy for people to say eat more but it isn’t easy to do so
Felt😂😅
I can relate alot
so that is considered skinny in America hmmm interesting
Tall skinny people also are at higher risk of collaped lungs
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaaaaaaaa but true all of them
Badly but dance is interpretive
Lmao last one is a personal problem u can dance
This is p a I n
100%
So relatable😂😂👌🏻
She. Her. Female. Woman.
As a fellow skinny person i can relate
yeeaah I was literally called a stick my whole seventh grade year, that was really fun ;)
I agree with everything except the getting cold fast. It actually takes alot for me to get cold
My friend is skinny and we had hip hop today and I guess this is why she won't dance and we where dancing to this song
Tbh I’m thinner than her and half of those are just her problem
Are you roasting me or yourself?😐
I'm fat as shit and the first 2 still happen
Agreed when they tell me go eat I LITERLY DONT GAIN WEIGHT
YuP that happens
🤣🤣🤣 nothing more true
used to be like this until, puberty. I use to weigh 80lbs i’m 5’2 now and i’m 170lbs funny enough i’m only 170lbs because i’m inactive :/ don’t want to know how i’d be if I was active again properly looking real good. Also I don’t eat a lot.
I am slightly chubby and I SUCK AT DANCING and you are actually better than me 🤣
Okay but like we have the same blanket
Those dance moves though
You can dance! Just not very well
As a former skinny person the dance thing was never an issue that’s just called being a bad dancer
I also agree as a skinny person
im a legit stick bruh relatable
I dislike this creator tbh and I don't normally leave negative comments but I can't block their videos from showing up  Onlyjayus joked about robbing a disabled person while they are incapacitated and couldn't even apologize when people called them out. They are ableist.  Edit: fixed pronouns, I may greatly dislike this person but I will still respect their pronouns.
Ngl those moves were good
"Just eat more."   Shut the fuck up
It’s weird how fat people and skinny people have so many parallels, we’re in this together hon.
i remember when i was skinny and i agree it hurt so much to sit and i was cold all of the time
When ur kinda chubby but these still happen to you ☹
I'm 13 and i weigh like 38 kg  and yeah most of this is relatable Edit: i don't think I'm THAT skinny
I love you Jayus❤
People see me as the skinny quiet kid, which in reality I'm the buff skinny quiet kid. Every problem she mentions though, ALWAYS HAPPENS!!!
Once you have a child.. it will all change. So embrace your skinniness. It to shall pass.
I can definitely relate to the freezes easily... Same damm thing EVERY year... I'm also very skinny... I've weighed 100lbs even, for 3 and 1/2 years. I freeze all the time. I hate it.
Your going to wish your skinny when get fluffy lol BTW love the vids💚💚
Boo hoo youre skinny
Me too
My ass bones hurt all the damn time
All of it is so true
The dance part....there's probrably a better explaination for it other than you being skinny 😂
All of it is so true
This dance moves are amazing what are you talking about.
I can’t dance i’m fat tho
Now I feel good being a fatass
Today I learned that it's not normal for your ass bones to hurt when you sit
Me, a chubby after I sit down: maybe I am a skinny person
Low key you look like a young magie from the walking dead :) ❤️
Number 6 Is my sis she can't dance
Soooooo trueeeeeeeee  My problem is like self induced i have the metabolism of captain America and can go 24-48 hours without eating so i just am overly skinny
The belt needing smaller notches isn't even the issue (it's an easy fix I should say). If you have no hips or butt then the belt has nothing to catch onto and it just slides down with your pants anyways. Standing, you end up looking like some homeless cartoon character with a rope belt and parachute pants. It's not fun.
Thanks you someone gets it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😊 I get hella cold easily like my mom thinks I'm overreacting about it.
Bro my parents call me skinny for being like 80 something pounds but damn ur an adult and ur 66 pounds and I’m 12
Once a co-worker of mine sliped on the floor we all laughed and giggled until hw didnt get up. He broke his hip at 22 years old on the floor!      Why isnt the "i can make a circle around your hand !" here? Oh yeah and number 5... My parents and siblings would say.."you can fly you can become our kite in the beach!" Any skinny person like my can agree
Stop whining
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT IS NOT A DANCE
My mom literally told me I was gonna shrink into nothing 🤠
The dancing 😂😂
Your danceing is amazing
FINALLY SOMEONE SAYS IT!!!!!!
P is So not say bad word p is and in so so so skinny
I am five foot two. And was 95/100 most of my life..I'm now 47 and have some weight gain due to health issue but skinny ppl issue are real. And so is the abuse for being naturally skinny. Didn't matter what I ate I was skinny. I could eat burgers and cake all day and i would still not gain one pound..now I just want happy medium lol
As a fellow skinny person I agree very much
5'10" and ~110 most of my life and can confirm, now I'm at 170. I can now use adult belts... but I have a large collection of buckle belts so I'll keep using them.
Lol but at the end of the day, you can comfortably wear a bikini and not have anxiety to show your stomach + not be judged by society like bigger people that have flabby stomachs. You never have to pay extra money for plus-size clothes, you can almost always find your clothing size available in a store, doctors won’t put all blame on your weight for any health issue you have, you don’t have to worry about sitting on a plane and taking up space or having to buy 2 seats… and lastly, you can happily eat WHATEVER you want and not have to feel guilty about it or fear putting on more weight for it. It’s my dream to be able to eat whatever I want, but I’d probably get to 800 lbs in no time and die. If I had your metabolism, I’d eat so much Taco Bell/Burger King, pizza, cakes, cookies, ice cream, candy all the time and feel so amazing 😭😭😭 I can’t imagine what it must be like to be you.. you could go eat a dozen Krispy Kreme donuts right now, and you’d be fine. That’s a blessing.
"i can't dance" *Proceeds to kill it*
I know how you feel
Mate you dance better than I do
Actually in skinny person standards, That dance was beautiful. ಥ⌣ಥ
Just be American lol
onlyjayus: I CANT F**KING DANCE   Me:I think that’s a personal problem
Fat problems:  People be saying: eat healthier Them not knowing I have an eating disorder*
Idk y u always stand on ur washbasin, that's gross. Nd there's enough goat's to support uu🤦
I'm obese and it's always been a real struggle I'm working on my health atm but it's not gonna be easy
So true
I like the way you dance. Have faith. I was 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 166 pounds from the time I was 16 until I was 26.  I have since conquered that problem.
I don't know jayus dancing is the thing to make my day!
Cant dance is a white trait agree with the rest
Fr I’m tall af too. I’m 6’9” and like 170. I know people that are 5’1 that are heavier and they aren’t even fat😂😂
Omg, this is sooo relatable.
Rather be skinny than obese imo
Word
I agree 100%
I am 52 pounds and I am 12😔😞😢
I can relate
As a kid, I was Ethiopian skinny. WAS. I blame the gamer lifestyle or it might've been puberty. Just don't do a lot physically and eat more than usual. For the dancing, I think you mean style. Just gotta feel it.
I'm skinny really skinny and every single pair of pants I have had they are way to big on the waste and the belt does not fit
Yup totally me
No cap I eat the most in my family and the skinniest I dont know how to dance either  also I just did that for Halloween I always wear a blanket
Yes.
I’m skinny and also can’t dance, so you might be right.
As a fat ass I can agree with "do you ever not eat"
I can relate
As a kid who has always been skinny I can relate to all
Can relate
Jin is skinny  but he can dance💜💜💜🐹
My mother would have loved to be friends with you as well as me because I wanna learn how to mess and joke and just fuck around and tease people without them knowing
That can’t dance promblem is mine to and I’m NIT skinny
im skinny af and just cant get cold thats a you problem
But why are you still here with horrible quality and bad content? 🤦 Stay on TikTok please...
Last one just a you problem
I know I hate it too
Same
Relatable
Apologize like really apologize.
Been poking holes in belts my intire life 😭😭😭
I have all these problems
100% true
skinny-shaming goes more unnoticed because sometimes it feels like it's just a jokey compliment.
"Thin" not skinny...
No one cares ..
I'm not skinny and as far as I've heard that's not all that bad in comparison
Bro I didn’t know it was every skinny person that had their butt bones hurt when they do sit-ups I thought it was just me
This is true I am 10 and when I was eight I weighed 42 pounds because the only meat I eat is chicken and my doctor literally threatened to put a feeding tube in me if I did not gain weight but now as a ten year old I am still skinny ( 65 pounds)
As a skinny person I can agree that people make fun of me for being skinny even tho I love most types of meat and I eat a lot but I just got a really fast metabolism.
The thing about comments is so true I was told I looked like I had an eating disorder for my whole child hood and I didn’t even know what it meant until 8 grade in health and after learning about it it really screwed with my mental health later on when I gained weight and was proud and told people they shamed me for thinking that gaining weight is good yet they didn’t realize it was more healthy for me to gain weight then to stay underweight btw all the weight I gained was in muscle from weight training since muscle weighs more then fat so its healthy weight
You can't dance?!!! You're MAD CAPPING
I’m skinny, but jeez, I can dance! Everything else is relatable, especially the comments
For those that told me to eat more… stfu you don’t know what it’s like to be unable to eat a whole plate of your favorite food anymore and cry about it because you can’t finish the one thing you loved most.
Same people are mean 😪
Lol I am skinnier than her but for some reason my body hust churns out heat like am a godamn radiator Like going outside in line barely above 5 degrees Celsius in short sleeve shirts and I feel pretty comfortable as long as I'm not moving, like I get surrounded by a layer of hot air and feel okay And it's autumn and currently raining outside while I'm here with no heater in my room literally sweating of hot temperature cause my room is so dang hot compared to the outside just due to my accumulated body heat making my room hot. I'm literally my own heater, and living in the summer sucks. I may be contributing to like 10% of climate change.  No but now seriously, that's probably why I'm so skinny, my metabolism is just like crazy fast it just burns through any fat I eat
As a skinny person This is true. And yup Every person says eat something and I cannot dance too. Thanks Jayus to tell everyone about this, every person should watch this video cuzz not people who are not skinny wants to be skinny and people who are skinny wants to be healthy, But why.
I think...the can't dance is necessarily a skinny problem....
My grandad says I'm malnutritioned every time he sees me
Stop calling me out except number 4
Totally agree as a skinny person
i can relate!! skinny problems ;-;
I am always getting made fun of cause I have abnormally small stomach 😑
She dances better than me 😭
I feel ya im skinny too
Same I’m 11 and I weigh 77 pounds, the worst is when I’m in p.e and I lay on my back my spine practically no longer exists
I'm a little underweight and this is all true except the cold thing
Facts
Ngl that dance was 🔥
The “can’t dance” one is definitely on you
- They'll call you freaking bones - Or skeletons - If you don't exercise they call you lazy, which is for anyone, BUT IF YOU DO EXERCISE, They'll get confused, like "is it enough?" *WHAT* - *"Eat. Stuff some meat inside there."* Um yeah i don't think it works like that. Looks like the foods ive been eating just, flew off i guess- - You are so skinny. "Excuse me?" *What, you should be greatful ur not called fat* - Does your parents not feed you? You'll blow in the wind - "It's freaking hot here why can't i turn on the AC??"   *DON'T*
I’m 13 and I’m 90 lbs and skinny
THE DANCING THING IS SO TRUEE  ANYTHING WE DO LOOKS WEIRD AS FUCK
The hell u mean you can DANCE girl damn
I feel like the inability to dance may be unrelated.
I like to think that scale was in pounds
Same
This is so true
I can agree so much- but on another weight note- I think my best friends scale is um broken… I weight like 90-100 pounds it says I way 75-
Everyone can dance even bigass chungus and im fucking fat thats yo fuckin problem
That’s easy to say when you weren’t built me me
Felt this, finally
As someone who is basically skin and bones i can agree
Ikrr they would tell you to eat while complaining of them being overweight when they are nott 😭  Also they say to be greatful ur not called fat ;-;
All these are so true
I agree besides that 5 one I’m fine with that stuff
Sleeves. Hoodie sleeves. Last month I got 10 hoodies from different companies to see if I could find a hoodie long enough for my arms. Not a single one passed the test.
Me to my fatass body after this video: maybe I treated you too harshly
u must not know the comments u get for being the opposite of skinny
This is true for me every single
I'm a fatty and even I relate to some of these things
As a fucking tall and skinny as man I agree to this
Are you 66Ib or 66 kg?
This is soooooo true
...  Well at least u dance better than me :D ... *dying inside*
You and me same problems skinny life 😭😭
I can relate from 3 to the end
When I was in my early 20s, a rude, morbidly obese woman gave me a disgusted look and said “girl, you need to eat a bacon burger; you’re way too skinny…it’s gross.”   Now, I’m not usually one to make ugly, disrespectful digs about someone’s weight gain, but in that specific scenario I just couldn’t help but pop back with “if you’d leave one on the table long enough, maybe I would.”  She was completely shocked & offended. Thankfully, I’d have a much more mature reaction these days, but that moment will always be one that sticks out in my memory.
Ild definitely rather be criticized over being skinny than fat
I'm a skinny person and I can confirm
This is me. I related to fucking much 😭😭😭😭
skinny people 🤝 fat people    hated by society for no reason
those dance moves where oretty swggy ngl
Yep I feel the struggle completely
I've been the same way and I can't dance eitger
As a 70 pound person I feel you
Omg, the belt thing. Fuuuuuuck my life.
Is the dancing really a skinny person problem?
I can’t talk in this video
Im so skiny and still skiny and i have all the problems to
All that is just being white…. Not skinny.
I have celiac and have always been under weight and those comments were always funny to me
At low resolution, she looks a lot like Marisha Ray. Neat
My problem is that i eat A TON ALOT OF MEAT and i mean a TON but i play a lot of sports every day so i burn them really fast. And i also eat a lot of snacks and 2 big bags of ships every single day
I know that problem to much
It’s ok I hear you I’m the same my mom would get mad at me for not eating and I can go a few weeks without eating hahah… I think I need help
XD I can't dance 😂
Bruh I can't even tell you how much I relate to you
I’m overweight and sitting also hurts my ass bones
Where can I sign up for these problems?
I live in a family with both sides having very fast metabolism I can eat like pounds of sugar and not gain so much as a normal person
I’m the exact opposite but I was always the skinny kid when I was younger
I mean being skinny is great but like jays said there are some down sides
Yep yep. I get ya. I'm 6 foot 5 n a half ... I can eat shitloads ....work out ect... My body does what it wants.
I got a high metabolism. I can't get fat even if I wanted to.
I think that bad dancing is just a Jayus problem I’m a boss dancer and am not thick or average
Bruh forget being skinny why you on the counter
The comments and laying down thing is true. For me at least.
I feel this cuz I have a high metabolism so I dont gain weight when I eat that may seem good but from all the time people made fun of me, rn it's not bad for me cuz I'm used to it but to all really sensitive people it's a pain for them. Also I eat a lot and barely gain like a pound after like 5 meals
You are annoying!  please go away.
So true ESPECIALLY THE DANCE ONE
Same
Being smol, this is relatable
Skinny people problems: when your rings don't fucking fit
I can’t dance: that’s just you 👹❓❓
This is why I hate being to skinny no matter what I eat I still stay the same
I'm the opposite I'm basically what children would say fat upsets me but like I realized that I should just love my body and I was surprised with a lot of these I did know that you did get really cold though cuz a lot of my brother's family members are like really small lake where you can see their there isn't it looks like they don't even have a stomach and they get really cold so I did know that one though
I can confirm 🥲
Not being able to dance isn’t a skinny person problem, I am fat and I can’t dance
I swear this is what happen all the time🤣
Excuse me but yes you can dance.
-THE POKE HOLES INTO THE BELT ONE FMLLLL- *I’ve done that before* 💀💀
Agreed
Jayus got the moves
Very Beautiful
When laying down I basically do a bit of a plant the whole time and use my arms as Kinda runners to stop my ribs from dying
The society one doesmt make sense being fat people body shame you more
OMG OMG YES YES YES IM 70 POUNDS AND FIVE FOOT AND I LOOK LIKE A TWIG AND I DONT HAVE A SIZE IN PANTS I HAVE TO SEW EVERY PAIR AND I CAN NOT DANCE AT ALL
People are do judgemental in this world tbh. If you eat, oh, you're fat. If you're skinny, supposedly you just don't eat.
You can dance
For fat people they get worse comments like you fat get a life workout for once get some exercise and clothes don't fit also can't dance worth shit
What's worse for me was that I'm skinny and I used to be a dumbass  I walked to school while it was snowing hard with no coat or sweater  Just my uniform
Wanna switch? I got high cholesterol, lower life expectancy, suck at running and can't eat anything unhealthy without seeing the consequences
I'm 12 years old, am 4'4, and weigh 52.6 lbs
someone asked a girl on tiktok who was just really skinny if she had an ED.when i tell you i wanted to throw hands because i have friends who have had EDs and it's so fucking frustrating when they don't know that even if they don't have one ITS STILL FUCKING TRAUMATISING and it PISSES ME THE FUCK OFF.
The only reason people haven't made comments on how skinny I am is because i only wear super oversized shit
I think the dancing might just be you bc I have a friend who is the thinnest thing out there and she is a fantastic dancer
It's one thing to be skinny. It's another thing to be skinny and 6+ feet tall.
So that's why I don't know how to dance
Me being skinny as fuc-: 🥰💀☺️ also me: being great at dancing *I'm for parrel universes ahead of you...*
You can dance better than me. (Well I’m skinny so maybe that’s why Lol)
the fact that the "go eat a burger" comments are literally part of my fucked up fantasy because I have an ed 😬
Is true definitely the dancing part, when we dance we look like werr sticks getting moved by the air
"Skinny people problems"  Me not even watching the video: this is exactly how i feel and i resonate with this as if it were my own child
The cant dance is a white person thing
I feel ya I'm 5 "9" and i only weigh 120
Girl I fat af and I still can't dance
I was gaining weight in middle school then a grow for 5.6 to 6.2 in 3 years
True
This is 100% true
Jayus Dancing >>>>>>>>>> Every other TikTok Dancer
But I have high cold resistance
As a skinny person I agree
I have the same problem ;-;
I'm skinny too.  Sometimes I just ate a whole a*s burger or burrito o whatever and I'm COMPLETELY full. Someone offers me food, I decline saying I'm full and this leads into a 10-15 min conversation about how stop eating won't lower my weight and that it is unhealthy to do that. And I'm like "My idea isn't weight loss, I just ate...." And they are like "HMM...I was just saying" :l
then bumping with furniture that directly hit the bones and you don't have meat to lessen the impact.
I was skinny 2 years ago but now im fat!😶
*I can’t dance* proceeds to dance perfectly
Bro I'm fat as fuck but I would never say to anyone "go eat something you stick" because they can back at me with a body insult
When I went to the doctors a few months ago I weighed about 158 pounds so not that skinny but I do feel sorry for skinny people especially the cold bit
Dancing Is not a skinny person problem tho
Exact same.
My metabolism is faster than Lightning McQueen and it takes me like 2 months to gain a pound. And yeah, the comments don't make me feel good. (I may lose the pound that  I gain sometimes)
Did that say 66?? Hope that’s kg
2,3,5,and 6 is me even tho,I'm not skinny...im in shape and I thinks it's not a bad thing...much
... any imperfections in a path... such as a rock that sticks up or a hard branch ... can MESS UP your feet..   Because you have no protection in the form of any fat below your feet..  And that is why I have frequent fucking cramps in my feet... ever since I destroyed my feet during 3 days of hiking in austria!  Fucking incredible to lay in bed... and then suddenly:  One toe just cramps up and says: fuck your schedule, you're staying here for the next 20 minutes!
Does skinny equal a trashy mouth?
Which one would you rather be? Be fat, clothes that are awkward on you, insecure and bullied, or be skinny, seemingly being too thin, but being able to flex your body? Yes being skinny had problems, but being fat has so much more.
I don't think your not being able to dance is anything to do with skinnyness I'm pretty fat and I can't dance either lol.
Thank you! Someone understands!
As a kid who is 5'3 in 8th grade and 85lbs I can second this to be true
I think your dancing is amazing! I'm very skinny too.😂
Omg I feel this. I’m 14 and I’m only 90 lbs.
Yes agree... Expecially... That i got really cold... Like freezing cold fast
I heard this is all my life... Chicken legs, skeleton.. Etc
LITERALLY RELATABLE AF. LITERALLY TODAY I WAS WEARING JEANS ( THEY ARE SO HARD TO FIND! IF THE LEGS ARE GOOD THE WAIST ISNT AND VISE VERSA) they kept falling down 😩😭 and my bsf ( while I hugged her) Omg your so boney it hurts to touch you. Then my stupid spine sticks out so at swim practice every can see my freaking spine- they’re like ewww get away. Also I can’t dance 😆. Ok when I was little I would lay on my chest and it felt like my ribs were gonna break— I do get cold rly fast and when I was little my mom was super worried abt me being cold. I hated it soooo much. I always had to get so many coats and hats and- you get the point           Someone send help
I always hated the "don't you ever eat?" stuff. It's so bad that it looked around to me not wanting to eat and hating the idea of getting fatter. Then again the dysphoria might be a triggering part too
Yea but when it is the opposite you have the mean comments about how much you weigh and how other people talk about it behind your back and it hurts
Im skinny asf, 15 and 5' 1 and I weigh basically the same as that
Are you 6 foot 1 or 3
Saaaame
"Eat a burger" they say "put some meat on your bones" they say, how about you eat a salad... Maybe take a jog. Whats that? Your too lazy to get off the couch? The maybe not eat so much goddamn food
Yassss that’s so annoying
As a skinny Person i never got cold haha
I weigh more than you
I have the blessing of being a little chubby but not fat, so yeah i don't get cold as easy
As a fat guy that belt thing still effects me
All of those apply to a fat person as well
That's your  problem
I'm almost 6 foot and only 114 pounds... I relate to this too much
Ok same though
Pros of having fat: when you fall on your stomach, you won't lose as much breath     Cons of having fat: Bullied 25/8 and loses a lot of breath everytime you run for 1 minute
Ok
As a person who was so malnourished that i look like a skeleton, I fully aggree, only this year have I also had some weight put and I look way better Honostly, idk how I ate but my bones would literally hurt me, I would have to wear Jackets all the time because my asthma + my skinnyness would make me sick immediately, and I would be extremely Insecure the more people asked me 'What do I even eat?' and 'You're too skinny' it really made me insecure until I put on some weight and started getting less sick
Nice moves bro
I GET COLD FAST AND I AM NOT EVEN SUPER SKINNY!!!
How about I just stand for hmm 5 hours maybe should I?
Bro that last ones cap no one can dance At least not younger people since it's always cringe
The dancing probably just your bad at dancing
I’m skinny but because of that I’m natural fit. I have fast twitch muscle fibers so I exert a lot of power and I’m fast sprinter. But most of the things she said in the video was relatable.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No offense but get a better belt with no holes, you won't regret it!
Same I’m skinny as hell but can eat whatever I want
As a skinny tall person. I feel you😭
As a skinny person I can confirm that the belt one is very true and so is the sitting also and cold all the time
Who loves her dancing?? I I I I V
Well im fat so
I almost spit out my water at the end 😂😂😂
I have also been skinny my hole life and my neck bones hurt when I lay on the ground
also shopping at thrift stores, the selection for smaller sizes is much more limited
So thats why i can't dance !!!...........and for the cold too!
The fact that body shaming a skinny person is something so many people refuse to acknowledge bothers me. If you told an overweight person to put the burger down there would be outrage. But telling a skinny person they need to eat a burger is OK.
Same with watches..I've poked holes into them
ahh.. im not skinny, i got a decent amount of fat in me,  but i still sit on my ass bones. this proves that i got no booty.  edit: and i thought it was normal
6,4 only bones
Same
Me: YES!
Well, you are considered to be an average-weighted person in Asian countries :)
Why are you assuming that any9ne has followed your life?
Lesbian love#
I relate to this so much
The cant dance part is not cuz you skinny its cuz you white
It's funny that I used to brag about being able to see my bones in every limb 😐🙂😶😐
Love u
Damn 60 pounds
Are u sure about the last one I’m real skinny and I’ve been and dance for my 7 years now
Weight isn't your problem. However your mouth, needs a bar of soap to clean all them filthy words coming out. And! to  teach you a lesson. One time I got caught stealing something from someone and lost the one inch of the pinky finger at the first joint.
Bruh I can't even wear a watch it just slips off my wrist
That's not normal-?
You can dance
That last one was a u problem
Everybody has issues at least you're not fat. And if you were fat you probably wouldn't be as pretty. And that would really suck for you cuz you're only okay looking
My uncle would say to me u have a bird chest it could fly away if you don't get any meat on your bones.
664 pounds is not a healthy weight
people find it acceptable to say things to a skinny person that they would never say the opposite to a fat person like how people will just reference your body however they want while itd be unacceptable (and rightfully so) to reference someone heavier the same way additionally, how problems with how society deals with skinny people get brushed under the rug because “being skinny is conventionally attractive”. being skinny isnt even considered attractive as of the 2010s, everybody wants somebody thicker, its a shitty excuse to treat somebody shitty.
Bruh I’m fat af so you sound lucky to me
Nothing wrong with skinny people.  Who are we to judge them . Are they offending us now??  What wrong with skinny people. They are health.  Why are you and whoever wanting to profile Skinny people .??? What’s wrong with them . Leave them alone and stop comparing them to what your ignorant standards may be.   Can’t pick on the African American??? What about the Asians? Don’t want to pick on them??? What’s wrong with SKinney people? Stop profiling them  . People are people and they do come in all sizes y’all small little tittle or big titties, fat or skinny white or black . List goes on    This world is made up of all people white or  not all people are made from god . God will judge everyone of us by our deeds. And how we treat others. Remover that. Shame on you .
Lie on scale
Being overweight sucks too.
Don’t worry, your not alone :,D
I still feel insecure about being fat….. but great video
Well that shit sounds like a you probably
I can’t tell if this person is a he or a she
Can confirm that this is true, I'm so skinny, that I can suck my stomach in and look like a scp
I’m small and a twig just like uuuu
I can relate
The belt doesn’t fit part 😂😅🙃
The dance was everything👌
im not skinny but i have extremely sharp bones. its come to the point where i cant sit without a cushion unless i want to feel like im grinding my bones against concrete
I have long legs, after walking in a store some old people made fun about my long legs and asked if I won a leg contest against storks.
As a skinny person I agree
i am very skinny
That happens to me
Shoe lace for belt works better and does not hurt
I'll pop😎
"I can't dance" Proceeds to dance better than me
I dont think the lack of dance skills is because you're skinny but I understand the other comments. My foster brother was born prematurely and when I met him he was skin and bones despite eating a normal diet, just because his stomach couldn't digest as many things as a normal stomach and he needed more protein than most people. He had to slowly stretch his stomach to take more food. He eats like 5 eggs a day with lots of other meats for lunch and dinner, while exercising regularly, just so he looks like a healthy skinny person, and if he skimps out for even a week he'll revert back to looking malnourished. I've heard a lot of complaints from him over the years about the literal pains of being too skinny and your words very much echo his own.
Thare are probably 10,000 comments that say this.  This is 100% TRUE.  I am still skinny and suffering from Al these. Lol
This is the most relatable video I’ve seen. Especially when she said “go eat a burger” lmao
As a really skinny guy I can relate, but having been skinny my entire life I wouldn't have it any other way.
What the fuck were you doing standing on the wash basin
Yessssssssss!!!!!!!
I agree with all of these problems except, idc how skinny I am, imma throw the little ass I have INNA CIRCLE😂💪🏼
Same, I'm 17, 5'9 and way no more then 120 pounds. I actually think last time I checked was like 110 😬😬
This, we stan this
Same here society is the worst. :(
As a skinny person I agree however I'm never usually cold but to be fair my dad is like a radiator in the cold times so I might've gotten it from him 🤣😂
Do you think your life is hard ?
as an not skinny person, the problem is not the weight is the waist, I wear large pants but still have to make holes on belts because of my waist
She ways the same as me and I’m 10
I know how u feel I'm super skinny I'm not even 100 pounds yet 😓
Imagine being short and skinny... wait that’s me
Relatable. It seems like no matter what I do I can’t gain weight. I lost 5 pounds after thanksgiving.
Being accused of being to "picky" "she must be picky" "she must do drugs" "eat a sandwich or 2" I can not lay on my sides and have a man's leg on my leg it crushes me. Absolutely EVERYTHING she says is true 👍and have been said to me and more
100% true 👍
I agree everyone says if the flick me I would fly😵
the belt thing is so relatable
I weigh 77
Sounds about right for me, especially as a male, laying down hurts after a while, sitting for too long hurts my ass, cloths don’t fit sometimes, especially gloves, can’t dance, sums it up
It true_
She says she can't dance but then does the best dance ever
Ughhhhh I feel you
So true but you are full of life and that's what make you different from others.
Also laying on your side hurts your hip after a while
"I can't dance"
Idk bout chu but I’m skinny and I could get pretty sturdy😎.
Yes I agree as I'm very skinny
I get this so much.  I'm 6'4" and 64kg
The dancing is better than I could ever do in my life
I have the same issues and I'm literally the opposite except 2 and 3, technically not society for the reason she listed but the opposite like exercise, stop eating so much etc
Thank you so much for coming out to all the skinny people! We love you so much Jayus!
Well you not being able to dance is just lack of having rhythm 😂
Damn I'm almost two of you
i can't lie flat on my stomach because it hurts my hip bone things so much
I am skinny and for some god damn reason i do not feel the cold i legit walk around in boxers only and only when i touch my skin do i know i am cold prob a me weird thing but i do agree with the ribs and the society thing
As a skinny person myself I agree with all of this
In skinny and my family be saying that to and same
Go eat a burger go get some meat on your bones
that was me when I was younger
Eat something
You can dance
Its not really a problem for me😏
Idk, man. Some people be dancing worse that that and have everyone at the club hyped
The dance problem might be a you problem..
I'm 6'1" and 147.  Can't gain weight for shit.  I can lose about 4 lbs in a few days. Shit sucks
I bet you smell like cheese and onion
U join in basket?
Outside of the inability to dance, I have experienced all of this.
When ur a kid and get bullied for being skinny :(
If I hade her as a sister, life would be great
Bro- the belt thing...just wow... Like i had to poke a new hole like... A thousand times
This is way too relatable that I feel insulted
Omg I thought I was the only one lol.
My math teacher actually skinny shamed me once
The most relatable video ever
Wait- that’s a skinny person problems.. no cuz I really didn’t know, I always feel cold and sitting down hurts my ass and I can bruised in my chest if I lay down like that  My mom said I was over weight, it’s either I’m secretly skinny or it’s because of my sensitive skin
yes
I suffer from this so much
I’m the one that eats the most in our house yet I the skinniest
Tht last one is just a jayus problem lol not a skinny issue
I’m sorry, but being skinny isn’t the problem to your dancing 😔
I’ve been losing these problems little by little
as someone whos a literal bag of skin and bones, ive been faving these problems my whole fucking life. its not my fault that i have an extremely high metabolism and eat like a fucking bird. :)
Fat people can't dance at all
Could relate ✋🏻💀
How do you feel knowing people who think feet are hawt can look at every single frame of that dance?   How do you fall asleep at night?
You look like you'd peg your significant other
So very true, first time I've heard this being addressed.
Dancing isn’t about skill or practice it s about confidence and having fun.
Soooo true
Everyone can dance
I think you not being able to dance is your problem 😂😂 I am just kidding
Im wondering if the stomach thing applies if you have a big bust, im not really skinny but im curious
Im a big person and 2 problems I can relate to is society but society saying "lose weight" and the 2nd problem I can't dance for sh!t
Being skinny isn't unhealthy what thd fuck
😂 I feel this
Entirely accurate. Besides the dancing thing 😂
Im pretty fat im 6'3 257 pounds and cant fit anything
She might have the most unattractive body type I've ever seen on a woman.
did that say 66? ion know if that’s safe lmao
Very true
Ive disliked when society says "youre skinny omg, eat" to yall but when it comes to a fat person they dont say "youre so fat omg, run"
Idk about the dancing thing that’s just on you lmao
I agree very much, and the most annoying part is that one friend in specific literally tells me every god damn day “yOu ShOulD eAt MoRe” like bruh first I would have to hop over the moon of insecurities that are present and even then I would still need to eat that much regularly for a long ass time which is next to impossible when my appetite is smaller than a flea, and the worse part is that when you tell a fat person to eat less society draws the line there even though there tends to be a fairly equal amount of issues with both extremes of the scale
I just found out something your a girl
People have always something to say, when youre overweight or even just little weight or when you are naturally slim. In my school, all the other kids are naturally skinny. So thats like the standard and I was called names because I wasnt as slim as the rest. But according to my bmi, I was pretty normal. I was left to believe that I am fat and unhealthy and for a long time I believed that.
As a fellow skinny mf no one can ever understand the awful experience sitting on anything wood is. I literally just squatted on chairs.
Fast metabolism bois)
Can't dance...maybe not a skinny people problem...
Good to know it’s not just me
I can relate to all of these, and it doesn't help that I'm 6 feet 110 pounds and the end of my ribs stick out as f so I can't do certain work out forms cuz it hurt az f. I was sick in my whole life and that ment that I was un able to eat foods which contain too much fat or it will come out. Luckily I had medicine that helped me but I'm still skinny as F
Telling a skinny kid to eat a sandwich is the same as telling a fat kid to eat less sandwiches. It's fucked up.
ONG- skinny problems- especially when Jayus talks about the things people say- omg- I’ve had it ALL said to me😂 and fat stuff to me lol
I see you with that findex scale
Jaus im suprised you're not in the wnba
My siblings and I have been asked if we’re anorexic and I just- that’s so disrespectful??? You shouldn’t ask if someone is anorexic!! And for the record, no, we’re not. It’s GENETIC. 🙄
Crazy dance moves funny as fuck 🤣🤣
I am very skinny for my age.. Probably the worst thing is that when you lean on a edge- it just hurts, because you are so skinny and the muscles don’t really protect your nerves.
100% relatable.
As a person who has a disability that literally makes me not gain weight I can agree a lot with the first one
1000000 % I can’t gain wait and I get made fun of
You just named all my problems in one video lmao
😂
This is me 😢
pov your skinny and see this: the truth has been found 😞👍
I'm in my late 30s... and I **STILL CAN'T** gain & keep weight on!!!  I've been accused of being anorexic *MY WHOLE LIFE!!!*  And new doctors, *ALWAYS* think I'm in *denial* of an eating disorder and/or run 100 different blood tests trying to figure out what's wrong with me!!!  I've *NEVER* been 100lbs or more! And it wasn't till my 30's that I've even got to 90lbs!!!!
So relatable
Had a friend in school who weigh 105 pounds. We used to go to Sizzler. She would finish everything on her plate, my plate and empty the texas toast basket twice. The month they had endless shrimp, I thought she was going to get us banned. She didn't gain healthy weight until she got pregnant.
Just workout
U forgot how they wrap two fingers on your arm and say u skinny
"i can't dance!!" Me: Same. Nothing else with that.
As a really skinny person I agree
All of these points make sense except the dancing. You were fucking shmoving
Can’t dance 😂
You sure as hell look absolutely breathtaking.
As a distinctly not skinny person, I used to envy you guys. Now I just wish that my extra fat magically goes to those that need it.
Way worse as a guy. Gals aren't too often a fan of skinny dudes
Agreed
The 3rd one is so true and mostly now that the climate is changing
You can't dance because your white
Man i am bigger than fucking big smoke
She's 6 foot and she is skinny 😂😂😂😂😂
I have the same being skinny cow
Took me until I was 28 to be a healthy weight. People think being skinny is great, as a dude being skinny = weak so no tiz not the best
To me those photos ain’t even skinny I’m just on a different level
Omg all those things happen to me mate I’m a twig
*not sure abt the cant dance one, i'm ultra thicc and I cant dance either*
Skinny people gets hurt easy
So relatable, especially getting cold!!
I was the fat kid, compared me to every day kid in every movie. Had a fat complex and now I'm normal sized but it's cuz I work 50 hours a week and eat 1 time a day. I'd love to have been skinny cuz being fat sucked!!!
Hey, no! Those dance moves looked pretty good to me!! I feel like we'd have been vibing as teenagers!
As someone accurate, I find this skinny
I'm plus sized and always have been, mostly due to a medical condition, and yeah the comments are the worst thing to hear as a kid
Her I finally got to a healthy weight her 66 me 85 pounds and really skinny at 9
To fucking relatable
I'd say those are some pretty sick moves
SITTING DOWN KILLS ME IM GLAD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
Im fat and I get too hot very fast, I wanna be in the middle,skinny but a bit fat yk? I just don't wanna run for 10 seconds and get tired
Clearly you can dance, you just showed us you could
As a skinny person society is my number 1 problem cause people always think i shouldnt be well they dont know im trying, but as a skinny person i am really tall =)
Can’t relate been fat as fuck my whole life
That last one i can relate because im skinny as fuck and my mom still fucking taking me to dance
As a fat person it's the same but they call us to fat
Yet i still find you charming. I don't know why🤷🏽‍♂️
Lmao yeah it's prolly not bc ur skinny cause my sister could dance very good and she's skinny, but ur not alone cause many ppl like me can't dance either
I'm 13 I'm not skinny I'm not fat either Because I exercise and do boxing Also I'm a boy
Is she tall, or does she have short ceilings?
🙌 THE DANCING 🙌
No wonder I get so cold easily
Same here I rlly understand this ahaha yeah
As someone who's been skinny my entire life, all of these are things I can relate to, and I usually get comments like "You can easily become a model" or "You should be a model" from my family members (mainly my step-dad), but when I do gain weight to where it's at least slightly visible, I'm extremely happy with myself.
I had to poke holes in my belts because my hips are wider then my waist so I would have to pull them all the way up to my stomach and put the belt on since I have a smaller waist.
I HATE BEING SKINYYYYYY ARHHHHHHHHH😩
Nah that tryna do crunches on any surface and it still hurts hits different
Dude I can Donw 10 chicken wings and gain bearlt any weight
So true im 10 and im also skinny as heck-
I know how you feel 😂
Am 33 kg and am gonna become 14 this month in the winter i have to wear 5 layers of clothes even tho our winter is not the coldest i live in iraq
Well heck, you dance better than me soooo..
I'd prefer this content from you rather than regurgitated reddit bullshit
Chu mean your dance moves are the best
It can get worse, if ur way too tall for your age :L
So relatable
Man I just think you can't dance
Jayus got movesss
60 POUNDS? HEALTHY??
Poooooor you
I had the opposite problem I gained weight just breathing I have to work my butt off to keep my weight down to 200lbs and the medicine I'm on I freeze my butt off or sweat it off my whole life.. I understand you I can eat oatmeal in morning an a hamburger for dinner and gain 3 lbs
showed this to an aquaintence of mine and he looks like the guys in the floating chairs in walle
No offense but watching that dance reminded me of 201 ways to stay single. Love ur vids btw
I’m not really skinny and I can’t dance
Yep
yup i pretty much agree with all of these
Yes. Yes I these things. That sentence made sense.
jayus i think the dancing one might just be you X’D
Jayus weighs 664 pounds!
I relate to this on a personal level, no matter what I do I literally cannot put on any weight
I'd rather be skinny than overweight (ofc i still don't wanna be underweight, that's not healthy either). Its easier to gain weight than loose it if i do wanna get some weight added in the end lol.  (Only applies to me personally. I know some people also have trouble gaining. For example my friend doesn't gain weight easily even if she eats more or does what her doctor suggests.)
I relate to everything except dancing. Us skinny people can dance too 😎
Not being able to dance is a white person problem, not a skinny people problem. We can't dance no matter our size XD
cold one does effect me but the rest I agree with 100%
I can't tell if that says 66.7 lbs or 667 lbs  (obviously not 667, but when I first looked at it, I got confused)
All i can say is yes
Same
I think your pretty Jayus. Sorry you got problems but I hope self image isn't one of them. 😀
Not even joking I'm so skinny that one morning on the way to my bus stop for school, i got caught in a particularly strong storm and it no joke threw my ass 20 feet down the road. I had a 20 pound backpack on and i got thrown down the road BY THE FUCKING WIND ALONE.
She looks like my ex
im a boy and skinny but i have feminine legs im not sure why
The measurement of skinny growing up for me was somone wrapping their thumb and index finger on my wrist and if thier fingertips touched then im considered skinny
I'm so skinny too, and fr and can't do anything and it hurts and I'm trash at dancing
Me relating
Can 100% relate.
Same im so skinny and i can agree with theese problems
Same I'm skinny af
add-on to number 3: being 20 million degrees on the inside while also being -3000 degrees on the outside
Lol it isnt even that cold and I am FREEZING cold all the time
Oh my god finding pants that fit is STUPID hard
I'm built like a lead brick and I can't dance I don't think that it's just skinny People
Is she a lesbian ?
I would call my self skinny, but short. I have idiopathic short stature so holy crap do I get c o l d
The last point is the polar opposite for me. The most annoying thing for me is when people are saying things like "OMG, I wish I had your body" or "You're so lucky you don't gain weight, I'm jealous ". I'm still constantly fighting for a healthy weight and even nearly died of malnutrition once so comments like this really hurt. People telling me I need to gain weight is a nice change of pace for me and rather reassuring than annoying.
Same facs
I don't think no being able to dance is a skinny people problem. It's an only jayus problem
Not to be rude, but are you a boy or a girl
I eat 4000 calories a day and I can see my ribs  and I am always hot
Her dancing is still swag doe ngl ngl..
Ik I’m skinny
I was called the anorexic/one bean a day kid in highschool, and I have also had to put holes in my belts 😂😂 doesn't help either when I have people saying "you just need to eat more" like, you don't see how much junk food I go though a day? 😂
👩🏼👈🏻💥skinny
The new holes in the belt hit me for a second.✋😢
I've been skinny my entire 13 years of my life and all of this is sooooo true
People ask me if I eat and it’s straight up rude. They should see how much food I eat and it’s not healthy at all. And they say “you’re lucky you can eat and not be f@t” but being $kinny is just like being f@t It’s the like same thing. Not saying everyone does this but we need to learn that we are all ppl and we all struggle to have “the perfect weight” when that’s not a thing
As a skinny person, yes. I hated how people talk to me. I don't receive much bad comments now, that good.
Enjoy your young days with the fast metabolism. Once you cross 30thies. You'll be welcomed to the fat club😂
Alr so ive been really skinny since i was like six and everybody thinks there is something wrong whit me or that im insecure abt my body but im not its just that like i dont eat that much bc idk 💀
I don't think can't dance is a part of that
Are you reekid
Is being skinny considered healthier than being obese/fat?
I feel I little it better about feeling fat now (btw I never get cold lol)
Lol
Stop crying girly least your not A F A T LARD
This is so true it's sad
That’s me and as a 13 year old life sucks anyways and it’s hard to be compared. She got everything spot on
Try being a short guy...you have no idea...I am 5'5" and even at 64 years old people still make comments about my height...
You dance better than me lol
So that’s why I’m always cold…
the fact that bootcut pants don't fit
But for real eat a sandwich
The belt one is trueee
This is so true cause like I need to poke holes in all my belts.
This kid at school used to bully me he got bored eventually but he used to call me twig because I'm skinny
You look like a fcking non binary or smth... You are not a girl
I think the dance part is a YOU proble - _ -
My fast metabolism keeps me skinny no matter how much i eat
Here is a tip: buy the biggest size childrens pants with the elastics, or sew an elastic in the band!
I'm five two and 115 and I haaaaate all of this. I used to get the break in half in the wind the first time I was skinny because my tits were huge and I was about this size. Lost them the second time I lost the weight tho...😮‍💨  Jay tell me...should I just start buying clothes in the kid section??? THERE ARE NO SIZE TWO OR XS ANYWHERE. WHERE ARE ALL THE TINY PEOPLE CLOOOOOTHES.
Facts
I am always 65kg but a 1 month ago i was 1 time at 70kg  I just lost 5kg in 1 month with normal eating and no change of life style xD
Ey it's ok fat people can't even dance to we are same
I Cant ewen Dance
I literally have these problems
I’m so skinny that you can see my ribs, my friends thought that I was starving myself when I ate a burger with chips the night before 🤣. Nothing fits on me as well so I have to either have loads of room in the legs or the trousers are too short
Those are some fankey dance moves
I weigh at least 130 pounds and my older sister is at least 70 😶
I have a tall and skinny friend i like calling him skeleton giraffe.
Well ur wrong about one thing. U CAN dance.
I have the unique opportunity of having been through both I was skinny as heck my whole life until I had children so now I am fat so I know the ups and downs of both sides lol
Im chonky and cant dance i dont think it has anything to do with that
oh poor u

Last ones not a skinny person problem. I cant dance, either tho
I as a skinny boy this is true
The worst one is when someone says " do you have a eating disorder "
The Cant dance is so true when i do a dance good it just doesent look good and IM so pissed
Once I moved as a kid and went to a doctor for a checkup. They were so scared of my height weight they tried to get me to eat and drink more and conducted a bone density test. Nothing worked and they realized, oh she is just hella short with a godlike metabolism and can't gain much weight even if she wanted to.
I finally figured out why I’m always cold  Also I feel the “thats fucked up to say to a kid” thing because I always get the “you never eat” “You eat like a bird” “Are you anorexic?”  But I have a very high metabolism, I can eat like a king and not gain a large amount of weight, which I don’t mind bc then I dont have to worry about being overweight or losing weight. I lose it automatically 🤣
another issue is people complementing you on being skinny  for me this lead to me not wanting to get over a certain weight
The one about 'sitting hurts my bones' is so fk annoying
I love that dancing its the flipping best
Don’t worry, I am skinny too! 😊😌
Lol I am skinny as HECK like u lol by the way me only 12 I no eat that much fast food but u right about the cold by the way u is for you I just maked it smaller ._.
Fat people problems :Society,no pretty clothes,pain because your legs can't support your body,bulies, when you try something on and think your pretty and someone skinny trys it on and they look it looks more pretty on them,.......
“Put some meat on those bones” bro I eat how tf you think I’m still alive. For me to actually gain weight I’d have to eat every 4 hours. Not gonna force food down my throat when I’m not hungry every 4 hours
Ikr my granpa called me skinny but he never saw my bff she really skinnyer
I get u I’m so skinny I hate it so much
I feel this one
T doesn't matter if your skinny or not anyone can/can't dance
Going to try to confuse you...you dance like a tall person :)
Sheesh those dancing skills are amazing 👁👄         I also can't dance bud
Omg this is so relatable
Haha
You DAMN RIGHT But its nice to be skinny fit tho :D
Definitely would have offered to buy you a box of donuts
It's okay ill cook for you
These are facts
Stop talking like a sailor and stop jumping around like a clown. Eat cheese burgers.
Don’t worry age will take care of that problem. Before you know it you’ll be 45 and weigh 180 lbs.
Not being able to dance seems like you problem tbh.
I can relate
Im fat and my pants fall off so your logic is flawwed
Very true. When i was young people will always say that i'm skinny because my parents don't feed me. Wich is crazy because i was always eating the entire fridge.
You can dance better than me. Own it :)
Don't forget if we fall or hit something we do more damage to our bodies because we don't have any padding around our joints or bones.
Yes the ass thing is true it hurts
Skinny people can dance. Wdym
I can relate.... been the same as you all my life. My bones hurt! There’s no padding.... 😆
I don't think the dance part is part of the skinny part
W T ..... hell!
BikiniJayus🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Must have it very hard
yeahhhh i bet you've been racist your whole fucking life too
She's Hott!!! 🥰
This is so relatable
This is so true curse being skinny
I'd take those problems
Aww yes the old fell through the drain while taking a shower problem
My husband’s mom made my skinny daughter feel extremely uncomfortable with being thin.  she made her feel like she was sick and going to die because she was too thin it broke my heart she’s only 10 at the time she was only nine
Yeah and the comments...   Me : STOP I CAN EAT A PIZZA AND ASK FOR MORE! Can you buy me a pizza or 2 pizzas?  Friend : bet you can't!   Me : bet I can!   Friend : 100$   Me : I know you're rich but you really should not waste money like this  Friend : you're gonna lose   Me : ok don't blame it me!   Friend : ok **orders pizza**  Me : **eats it and asks for chips**   Friend : **gets me chips**  Me : **eats chips** more!   Friend : ok keep your 100$  Me : 50 for me and 50 for you  Friend : thanks!   Me : mhh.. Free pizza...
“That shit’s fucked up to say to a kid!” No, it’s just a burger mate... put some meat on your bones and eat past your limit if you’re that sensitive about it
Me being 14 weighing 188
Another very VERY skinny person here and yes I can confirm all of these even the dancing one
Thank you for understanding me
Be grateful fattys have it way worse
I thought she was a boy
Haha I got told to eat a milkshake or something like that by the end of the day by my doctor I weigh 81 pounds
But u still dont wanna be fat trust me
I'm hella fat and I've always wished to be skinny but seeing that people are struggling with what ever weight they are, I say just love yourself the way you are.
ass bones... ass bones..? ass bones.? ass bones? ASS BONES!?
Yeah I remember when I weighted like 48 pounds yeah I know what your thinking
I’m skinny no matter what too- and I eat a bunch
I'm just fat and it isn't going down if I exercise or not
Looks like you can dance just perfectly 🥰 to me.
What the fuck did I watch at the end LOL
As a kid I was super skinny and honestly, grown ass adults saying to 15 year old me "oh I'm so glad I finally got you to eat" in the school cafe.... where they see me eat every day.... that shit sticks with you... and my uncle asking me if Im bulemic *while* I was eating... in what world are they acceptable to say? Whether it's true or not it will just either cause an eating disorder or make it worse
Hi, Jayus. I feel bad for you about the comments. I get a lot.
The worst thing is when they tell you How the wind will blow you away or make comments like That. Sometimes i would laugh or something but they keep saying it and im getting rlly mad ( i dont show it tho but im mad )  And once i tell them that Its not funny anymore they just laugh
What do you even mean....         YOUR A GREAT DANCER!
As someone who's also skinny as fuck the, the dancing part is not real XD that's on you XD
Try working out though
well I can relate to this, I'm skinnier than her and I sleep on my stomach
YES FINALY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS ME!!!!
You can dance if you are skinny
Those dance moves were really good
I, on the other hand, was never skinny. I was the overweight one. And like two years ago I lost a lot of weight. Why did nobody told me I'm gonna get so cold?!
I cannot gain weight because I use more energy to eat the food than energy contained in the food.  BMI at the bottom of the healthy range and my doctor has no problem with me being a feather weight.
I used to be skinny af too and can relate to the belt part so fcking much lmao, well now I'm bulking
Bro the ass thing I feel that shit. God that shits annoying
I have these problemssss😭😭😭
Same! & seriously can't dance.  I call it terminal white girl syndrome
Ong bestie
I have the same problems  and the eat one was the one that made me cry when i was little and when people  hug me  my ribs hurt  because of how skinny  i am
So I'm naturally skinny, and as a result gaining weight is haaaard. So to put the into perspective for others, it took until my 7th or 8th grade year for me to hit 100 pounds and I had a mini celebration for myself. What's even sadder is I'm almost 19 years old and my 13 year old sister has more weight than I do and I eat a lot and laze around. Also it sucks not being able to stay warm and the rest of your family gets mad when they see you walking around in a blanket just because you cannot retain heat
I think you dance great :)
Skinny  problems im skinny and have a stupid heat
I would rather be skinny than over weight.
FACTS!!!! SAMESIES!!!
What do u mean we can't dance!?when my favorite dong come over I'm just yetting mu butt!
I also have been skinny my whole life, then i had enough and hit the gym, as well as eating more. In some cases it's not that simple to get rid of weigh problem, but it sure is not most of the time. If you like yourself the way you are, thats what matters
Dw I can fit my pinky around my wrist with extra space, and yet I’m one of the tallest people in my year and yes I eat way more than I should, I’m eating rn and yet I’m the skinniest in the year
Soo true I’m watching his in a blanket
I don’t have to worry about this I’m fat and sad 😔
I knew you were a best buy employee at one time!
Same girl
What exactly r u?
I weigh 80 lbs at 13, help. I am pure skin and bones cause i have a metabolism of a fucking cheetah.
I was that skinny that they nearly didn't let me go on vacation ( I was 10 and had 28kg). Hate it
THE WAY SHE DANCES AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IM WHEEZNG
That is literally me
Im very skinny
This is soo relatable! Sitting down hurts my ass too and the cold part 😂😂
Soooooo true I am 60 pounds
I grew up naturally skinny.  People were always making embarrassing and judgmental comments.
Haha
This is just proving how fat I am😐
Ok now do this again without the language it will be better ( just my opinion for those who want to grill me)
Skinny people problem that no one understands    Gets BLOWN AWAY FROM REMOTELY ANY STRONG WIND yes I have been blown away by wind many time, sometime up to a foot of distance from where I originally stood
I have the same problems 😜ϟϟ(๑⚈ ․̫ ⚈๑)ᵖⁱᵏᵃ ᵖⁱᵏᵃ
Skinny gang whear you at
All of its true , I deal with it everyday. I have eaten whole meals all day everyday and my body doesn't gain weight. It is what it is.
Only way to dance is a formal one
Ya except I'm overweight and it's the same way except somethings dont fit anymore can never loose a lot of weight and I've been told my entire life you dont need that youd be prettier if youd loose weight and all of it was from my parents and family ahaha
Better fancing than me.
I tell people I'm fat on the inside.
True
Yes
My dad's great advice for skinny people: go eat a sandwich 🥪
Idk what you mean that dancing was 10/10
Wow! Yeah being skinny is so bad. Give me a break. At least you don't  have to order clothes from special websites, or have to worry about people laughing at you because your stomach hangs on tables at restaurants. Get real onlyjayus. Being skinny is not an issue.
I agree being skinny is terrible because I used to barely eat because of problems I don't wanna get into but yeah I agree with all of this
Same here I'm skinny and I'm only 12
THANK YOU
The pain after sitting for long periods of time is the worst
I mean... You gotta eat more because you are tall
Wow... relatable
her: i can't dance! also her: *proceeds to shatter that dance industry with her moves*
Can't relate never could not even at my skinniest because I have body dysphoria :(
I'm in the water (9mins later) ME SHIVERING LIKE I GOT OUT FREEZING WATER
The belt thing is so real
Guys, I would just like to address that both “you’re so fat” and “you’re so skinny” are BOTH body shaming
Ay yo same
Fax
OMG SAMEE THAT THWTS WHY I CANT DO SIT UPS
As someone who is also skinny as fuck, I can agree on a lot of these things
I feel called out :|
Holy crab.... Jayus got titties...😳
As a fat guy, people complaining about being skinny is always interesting and(no disrespect, in the best way possible) laughable lol.
I can't dance even if I do get fat
Don't worry when I was younger I had to see the doctors 24-7 I swear I was fed I could just never gain weight
I don't think "can't dance" is only a skinny problem
Can relate. I’m 13 and weigh like 60 pounds no joke.
Am I the only who can’t lay on the floor because my hip bones make it extremely uncomfortable
My problems…. I’m super skinny and all of the things she said are true
You have less problems then people who have a little more meat
The quality after point 5 just turned into 8 bits so I think this video got a glitch
Maybe you should eat if being skinny is so hard lmfao
Sameeeeeeeeee, skinny people problems... I'm almost always cold
5 is so tru
Facts rights there! Society probably plays a part in my depression.
Oh ya that’s me
Literally me
All veryyyy true as from experience
Omfg i have This problem for 25 years
Don't know what you're talking about, those moves were 🔥 😂😂
All this is true for me except 5 cause I can dance somewhat.
I have a reason why I’m rlly skinny
Wait, are you dipping chicken nuggies in pickle juice??!?!!
*laughs in skinny*   Srsly tho its a pain
Bro I can eat like 3 whole pizzas with 2 steaks and 50 pounds of nacho fries and I will still be skinny
If can't dancing is a skinny person problem, call me skinny even though I weight 200 lbs.
You realy good the dance 😆
Ayy you can dance 🕶️ don't let anyone say otherwise
Oh so it's a girl!
Your skinny: Omg why dont you eat are you sick  Youre bit overweight: Ong youre so fat like why you eat so much
I am Afflicted with all of these as well
My sister is gust like you but she can dance
Skinny people are literally the definition of privilege when they have fast metabolisms and are born with it. You cannot tell me that they have a single valid problem over overweight people that are not quote pet peeves quote
Society is pretty fucked, you get bullied for being skinny and I get bullied for being chubby, just love yourself. 🤍✌
I can relate 🤣 but I’m part Asian so I’m smaller and my friends are like you good when I almost get blown away from the wind and some of them accidentally push me ( very lightly) and there like are you ok I also eat like a man my mom tells me. All that you said are true 🤣🤣🤣
My sister is skinnier then you
Same as being fat?
Ive been told my whole life to "put some meat on my bones" and that shit but I've tried, my whole life, I eat so much, I've tried different diets and all sorts, the only thing thats even remotely worked has been muscle mass, literally going to the gym, working out to gain pure fucking muscle mass, thats the only way ive been able to put a semi noticeable amount of weight on, and that was about 4.5 lbs over near 6 months, and I'm still underweight for my height and age, it sucks but I am at least fairly healthy. I just don't get why its so hard to put on weight
Just standing on a sink, as usual
Same here girl
Soooooooo true
😐
If I blew on you then you would fly away like a loose dead bush
All i tell skinny people is eat different food and stop being picky lol eat once a day and make it worth it
As another skinny person I 100% agree with everything
This is all so relatable XD I
Same with me
Epik dance montage
I have these problems too . however , i can dance a little but i get tired so easily !!
I feel the skinny problems and tall problems.
Yeah... I dunno abt the rest but I would prefiere to be skinny af :')
Me being fat and being hot: I wanna be very cold...
As someone who is not a skinny person I only relate to The 1-3  I visited the remember when I was in 3rd grade and the adult woman started criticizing me because I had a little Chubby like brow what the fuck I'm a kid
I like your dancing it would keep kids company and make them laugh hah
I thought that scale read 66lbs, but then I realized it was in kilos thank God.  Edit: YEESH you must be tall! So beautiful and sporty too!
Yeah im 24
Idk what you were talking about, Bc those dance moves were bussin.
Racist
literally my grandfather always tells me that he’s afraid i’ll blow away in the wind 🥲 it low key hurts tho
It’s so true
look.. as a plumpy person there alot more problems u dont fit in alot of stuff u feel uncomfy infront of people when they look at u or when u donthave clothes to wear bc they dont fit its hard too or when u wish u can look like thos girl or boy its hard ok
Relatable
I eat more than an obese person
I agree
It's called a fast metabolism, I know a girl with one, and some fat people have a slow metabolism, but most times fat people are fat because they're gluttonous
The fact that I did get blown off a small slope cuz I was skinny 🙂
Ah yes the racist making tik toks once again
You can dance better then me 🥲
Tall people problems
You could also try suspenders
Tall people probable
Probs gunna get hate for this but why is it okay for someone to say to someone skinny oh eat a burger but soon as anyone says to an obese person to eat a salad it's offensive?  It makes no sense. They're both equally as offensive
Felt all of that
You can't blame skinny for your dancing
Pure facts
Now people shall my struggles
In a world that loves thin people this is  a bit like saying " it's hard to be beautiful" but you look great enjoy it.
I can't dance either
She's 6'1" if I remember for a girl they gain lose and hold weight different.I am 6'2" and never had any weight till I got in my 20s but I am a guy but after I slowed down now I can't get it off lol. She needs to stop knocking on herself she was and still a pretty girl.
sitting down on a hard bench is torture...
Relatable.
Don't get me started on Rollercoasters
You poor thing 🙄😂🤣
Dancing is just you not knowing how. Most dancers are skinny
*all teenagers be like* relatable
Can some of my other skinny kings gang up with me and take over the world.
MY NEXT VIDEO RECOMMENDATION IS SKUNNY PPL PRIBLEMS WTF THIS SUS THE FIRST VIDEO IVE SEEN ABT SKUNBY PPL PROBLENS
I KNOW RIGHT
I feel the dancing thing lol
+ being tall
Same
The fact that I can relate to this whole video Edit:Also the thing about eating I eat like a shit load of food and I’m still skinny
Am I the only 1 that thought that was a guy
then how do i gain weight. my life is just messed up
I eat a lot and then 20 minutes later I'll be hungry again
Your white. We cant dance. Rhythm is the main antagonists to white society
Im not ever like..a pre-teen and like...i have 60kg..ahahahahaha...and the best part is I dont even look fat
Me sitting here chubby: 👁👄👁
My brother so skinny he’s ribs I can see bro like tf I tell him to gain weight like 10 pounds
I relate to this so much I have like ten pair of pants that are too big for me and I don’t have any belts but when I do use belts they also don’t fit and then I have to buy new pants but they are to small
This is no joke my life in a nutshell
Same.
I used to be morbidly obese at 312lbs and now I’m at 145lbs and so now I’ve known the struggles from both sides 😂 so much ass pain. AND spine pain. I literally had to buy cushions for my hardwood chairs lmao
I feel u
i love the dance tho
My little brother has more weight than that and is 12
BRO I AM SKINNY I ATE HAMBURGER AND STILL SKINYY!!!!
Same bro same
I feel the pain for them all especially 1,2, and 3
There is some things good about both cause you can eat whatever and not worry that’s one of the traits I wish I had but no 😣
I have a high chance of having a heart attack
I feel that but instead of people say go eat i people would tell me I had the perfect body which led me to feeling awful because I though I was making everyone self conscious
My entire childhood I was obese. As of the current year, I've reached a healthy weight of 140. There's still things I don't like about my body, but it's crazy how some of the things in these videos now affect me. I get super cold when I used to handle it like a champ, people tell me to eat, laying on my stomach hurts, and to be honest I've never really be able to dance 😭
I am so damn skinny and yet I take dance classes Edit: idk why because a ton of ppl say "omg how are you so skinny I wish I was you"
This always happens to me
I'm so glad to see someone who actually understands how I feel lol
my legs are so long and my waist is so small i can never find pants that fit
Yo that some good dance move
Its so trueeeeeå
I get u
I always eat but im still super skinny and yep these pretty true coming from a skinny bean
i realte
why the fuck are you on top of a sink? your not being edgy. that's just unsanitary and stupid.
So fat people can dance?
This is my problem I'm to fucking tall
True
I feel you. Ppl like us are meant to be muscular and ripped, only thing is muscles take time and energy to build, and even longer with this type of bone struggle. The struggle is reeeeeal.
They say I don’t have meat and I look like a skeleton
Yup
6’4” and skinny as hell can feel ur pain
As a skinny person I can relate
🤬
Awwww poor baby..
Im skinny but ord no problem to me
Same and True
After hearing the problems I still don’t care I wish I was skinny 😐
Girl u dance like good oof dieing oooof
I dont think that dance one applies
And people are nonstop asking about your weight and telling you " you are so skinny omg "
Same
It’s okay I’m skinny to I am so goddamn bad at dancing :)
My sister is skinny too and everything you just listed happens to her
You missed a side effect of skinnyness- swearing too much
You swear too much!
True
who care your so damn cool and awesome
Am i a skinny too
I am what I like to call a lamppost extremely skinny but I'm taller than the rest of my, and I cannot stress this enough 4 ft 11 family because I am 6ft 2
so true
My cousins very skinny but she can dance. But she isn't the best like me or my family.
Number 5 is something I've dealt with this for my whole life. I still deal with it, and it's gotten to a point where the parent's kids that are friends with me also tell me this. They think I don't eat but I do. I get so fucking depressed when they say this where I just completely ignore it by saying, "Yes I know". Example: Them: Do you e- Me: Yes I do and I try to get fat but I can't for some reason. Sometimes I just ignore them completely by just staring at them and not saying shit.
My life has been like this and I blive it would be like this forever because I'm very skinny and some people were saying you have to be grateful for not being fat and let me tell you it's not easy to be skinny/not fat just eating more food " is not fun or anything bc if you are skinny like me like I have been told be people "like do you have food at home?" "If I touch you you are gonna break in half" and for thous who eat Abit more is like "what is up *FATY" " "can just stop eating?" Please stop it's not easy I can't sleep at night just crying and dreaming about if I could jet get Abit meat on my body or for some people be like the same and wishing they were skinny stop that all I'm going to say 🙂.
I wonder why I never get cold 😔
Can’t dance is all of us I think
Finally… someone who shares my pain…
All of these apply to me.
You might have type 1 diabetes
Love The Dance Moves 💃🏾
I relate to all of these somehow-
This is so true whenever I would not be super hungry as a kid my dad would be like “ get some meat on your bones, your too skinny “ and it was the worst
Wtf were Those dance moves lmaooo
Dude the comments always get to me it makes me so insecure
I have bad news. Being skinny is not why you can't dance. It's because you think you can't.
No one cares
Omg she 660 pounds 😳
Same as me girl
“i can’t dance”  that’s a problem all white people face
This is me.
telling someone to eat a burger when they have issues gaining weight is just as bad as telling an obese person to eat a salad ✨
FAX
jayus=role model status
i have all the same problems im an eighth grader and societies comments are rlly messed and makes me hate the i look
I'm chubby, but I also get very cold all the time
I'm like this
THIS IS SO RELATABLE
I don’t know what people call it but they better than anyones moves I’ve seen ✨
Girl same-
Yeah lucky you ur too skinny 😑😒
That is so true especially the sitting down part
these things happen to me a lot-
EXACTLY
I noticed when I was somewhat fat, if I accidentally hit a wall or something it doesn’t even hurt lol. but now that I’m skinny every time I hit a wall my bones feels like they about to break
Yes I relate to this on so many levels!! Especially the first one 😂 and the belt one
OMG! I so relate to this especially the people comments one.
Facts
Girl, I can’t dance too 😔
Here, take my fat, if only it worked that way...
I wear tracksuits all the time so I never have to worry about belts.
Every week I at least get one comment about my weight, and I’m not ridiculously skinny either. My boyfriend was talking to a guy on a boat while he was fishing in front of our lake house and make a comment about me doing my makeup, the guy said “you taking her out to eat? It looks like she needs it she barely has any meat on her!” Idk why people (specifically men) think it’s alright to comment on other ppls weight and bodies?? Like??
Truthhhhh goddammit its so annoying AND ALSO people r always saying u look abnormal eat more blah blah blah AND WHEN I DO THEY SAY u mag be skinny but if keep eating like that you'll GET fat WTF DO U WANT FROM ME JEEZ
As a skinny person this is very relatable
I’m the same
I guess I’m skinny to
You can dance better than me lol
I relate to this on so many levels, I ate like so much food but because of my high af metabolism I would loose weight going up and down the stairs.
Nowadays its bad for people to be fat the people at school always make fun of my weight and it makes me insecure then some of the teacher do the same thing last week a girl made fun of me with a teacher it hurt but yeah all im saying is I would die to be skinny so yeah....
Those moves. They are too powerful
You are the best dancer ever!👌😃
Why you gotta lie about not being able to dance?!  That's literally my entire repertoire and you nailed it!
I only see a beautiful person with a great personality 😌
So relatableee
Lol
My dad used to tell me to stick my tongue out and then call me a zipper, and my family keeps on saying I’m vegan because I “don’t eat enough meat to not be”
The can't dance part applied to us non skinny ppl aswell
So true
Same for me
Wait... I thought she said she can't dance?
This is so true, I can confirm all of this is accurate except maybe the dancing bit, that might just be jayus. Also, saying that to a child *will* mess them up, don’t ever do that.
You dance better than I do.
I have always had a hard time gaining weight. I would vacillate between 95-100. At the age of 40 I decided to have a child (finally). When I got pregnant I weighed 98 lbs and worked very hard to get up to 140lbs for the baby’s health. After birth it took less than a month to lose all the extra weight but I wasn’t trying.
You rarely here of a person dying from skinny, outside of starvation. Being fat on the otherhand......
Look at those moves at the end
I’m actually bullied for being skinny My nickname is red headed stick :/
Roblox can't work 2021
That's why I'm glad I'm fat lmao
I know
no bc relatable and i hate people who call me skinny and a string bean 😍
I can relate to all of these🥲✨
"I can't dance"  Busts out the teir 2 dance moves 💃
I don't know the struggle for now but here's something about that: I am a trans women and just began HRT, and one of the drugs you take for hormone replacement therapy is spironolactone.   Spironolactone is an inhibitor of androgens and male sex hormones, i.e. testosterone. Once that's inhibited, it's steadily released as urine throughout your usage since it also effects water retention. But testosterone is also responsible for something beyond male stuff.  Testosterone helps manage muscle mass and, as you take spiro AND estradiol to become more femme, you start to lose weight through muscle degeneration or muscle atrophy. So I might not the struggle now, but check back in after two-four years and I'll be right there with ya lmao
It is to true
The last one actually hits home SO HARD
The reason why they believe there is no skinny problem is because you are considered more attractive compared to someone who is larger I don't not talkin voluptuous I'm talking beached whale cuz they think voluptuous women are also a problem being skinny fat they tried to coin that term because again they are considered more attractive than the beach whales that's why skinny people are dismissed from having problems within the body positivity movement it's all about being considered attractive as soon as you are considered attractive no matter what size you are you are no longer part of the body positivity movement if you ever were considered a member
I feel ur pain. I try to eat more but it just makes me taller
but tyat 100% me end is anoying
To all the people who say to just bulk up - I'll eat like 2 big macs and fries and all that weight dissapears the next day. Fast metabolism problems smh
all of these except being cold, i just don't get cold very often
bro same
I was skinny whole life and then boom hit 40 and now a little chunky
FACTS! This is so much facts
Looks like you can dance to Me
None of these relate to my 6’6 dumbass
Yes omg yessss
Don't forget about spontaneous pneumo thorax! Happened to me, but thankfully I didn't need surgery. That's the only time I've seen my older brother cry!
The belt one is so relatable.
Ever since I was really young my moms family would give me extra food and comment about how skinny I was pretty much trying to force me to eat more when I was not hungry those thing mentally and physically effected me to the point I would eat when not hungry and bloat myself to the point I felt sick and now I don’t like my body because of that shit they said so please don’t do that to people it will mess with them for years to come and really take a toll on them
the fact that she didn’t have anxiety showing her dancing in front of millions of people
Your dancing’s better then mine
O well I'm not skinny but a part of my body that is kinda skinny wich is the bones of my hips and so when I lay down on the floor stomach down the bones of my hips hurt
I understand this video so well, also you look great, not skinny or big, dont take crap from no one
I'm overweight... And I have the same problems??? :( WHAT AM I PLS
The wind one’s the most relatable and the worst
Laying on my belly hurts my bones alot and it makes me sad
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
I’m a 14 year old guy and I only weighed 100 pds :(
I just realized while looking her filming in the mirror that I’m more than a head shorter than her... which means I qualify as an armrest :))
She dances like me in the shower 🚿
Finally someone who i can relate too. I have been just bones for all my life
Dude my 10 year old sister weighs more then her
I have Cystic Fibrosis and an extremely fast metabolism. My weight plummeted last year. Now I’m 6ft, and I went from around 55kg (which is already low) to 50kg. Past few months I’ve been getting it back up and I’m about 62kg now but it’s so difficult to keep on top of it.
I relate to most of these skinny af bro
Those are the best dance moves I've seen all day
I can't Dance : Its Same for *Fat* People
Loved the dance
Another thing is, when it's very windy outside, wind can literally blow me up the ground, one time wind lift me up and I almost fell on my face 🙃, it's so terrifying I just want to couch on the ground. Also I'm really proud of Jayus 🥺💖💖 she could reach a healthy weight which is impossible for me 💔🗿
Always struggled with weight, even when I did put some on I had no ass. Belts have never worked, created back and stomach problems trying to get belts to work. Found Grip6 belts and life has changed
"I could break you with only my finger"  AHAH, super fun ! I never heard this joke ! It's fun when I say that I know 5 fat people and you are 4 of them ? 4 time in a day ? Yeah, I'm salty.
i’m a musical theatre student and i’m naturally REALLY skinny so i have been dealing with comments like “omg you’re gonna look awkward on stage”, “how can you dance like that?”, “is it even healthy for you to do a whole show?” and it’s super annoying because it’s making me feel bad about my body which obviously affects my performance, body shaming is actually the worst
Yes
Dude, I wish I was skinny
It was being called a twig for me
I am under weight average for my age I have the weight of a 9 year old and this very true especially the last one
I struggled with my weight growing up iv been skinny and the thing is words really do hurt like " im afraid to hug you cuz ill break your back" or the one my dad used to say( he was abusive) "i dont know why your so skinny theres plenty of food in the house maybe you need help) no the thing is i maybe skinny but its literally my metabolism i can sit down and eat 2 big macs and a large fri and still want dessert or i can eat a 20 oz steak and potato and still have room for more and im 115 punds at 26 its alot mentally
I have the same problem lol
Those Joey moves 😂
Bro I know how that is
Im with u, Skinny Squad forever ❤
I ALWAYS HAVE TO POKE SO MANY NEW HOLES ON MY BELTS JESUS
All these relate to me like I've felt so depressed cause people called me very skinny.
Can gladly relate. Although the comments people made didn't really bother me, I find them as a joke.
There ain't nothing wrong with being skinny. I've been the same size since I was in 9th grade. I'm 26 now
Yes, the entirety of my life xD the ass bones one hit home real hard
Bruh, you are better dancer than me, imao
So true I only weigh like 135 it sucks
Don't worry Jayus, no white person of any weight can dance.
Is he a girl
3,4 and 5 are so true 5 from my expereince atm im scared to eat anything cause bullying for years of ms and hs has left me rn in college with low self esteem and insecurity of physique (body dysmorphia i believe is what its called) tho im 147 lbs at 5’7 and 21 im very self concious from the hazing when i was overweight in ms form an antidepressent causing me to gain weight
I don't even know what a belt is
Also cause you’re tall af, it’s harder for your body to circulate blood, which does not help with being cold
It really sucks that many people think body positivity only applies to being overweight
Your a girl? Boy?
Same
SO TRUE
Well I've been told to get some meat OFF my bones you can have some ill be generous lol.
As a tall skinny male, in HIGHSCHOOL, I can confirm
I feel this on a whole different level, people always tell me to “put some meat on your bones” but I can’t like I eat a LOT trust me but I never seem to gain weight, I didn’t reach 100 pounds until this year and I’m 5’4
The same
People used to remark how skinny I was all the time as a teenager so I hit the gym and started eating properly to put on mass and now I'm a Greek God
Everything is true especially the belt one 😂😂
I've been chubby my whole life, I wished I was skinny.
I feel that pain I'm 95 lb or 43kg
You have a rocking body shape, respectfully speaking, gurl 👍🏻
What about when the wind blows AND U FALL OVER 🍃😭
Or when you put a belt on to much and you get  Bruises
SOO true
The dancing is a white person thing
I’m skinny and I can say this is true
I get cold easily but for some fucken reason i will wear a thin ass hoodie in a blizzard
I’m skinny as well and I can’t dance so I guess that’s just a skinny people problem
As someone whose 6'4" and 150 lbs I can agree with all of this 😂😂😂
The sitting down one is so true
This is really true
"Cant dance" Procides to dance like a greek GODESS
Awww poor baby.  Waaahh Waaahh waaah.
Cry me a river😒
Yooo this is so right
You are skinny? I didn't even notice.
I hate being skinny
I feel You
Jayus: I just got to a health weight of 60 something pounds at 6'2  My fatass being 132 at 5'4
That scale is in kilos i hope
This is totally why I'm fat. Not because I'm lazy. Ok maybe I am lazy.
Dang she got moves
Tbh when I was skinny I didn't care what people thought of me because I was too worried about my arthritis
I'm 7"3 and I completely agree lmao specific exercises like situps hurt my tail bone so much that I resort to other ab exercises
⚠︎︎𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻⚠︎︎  God loves you, and so do I! :) God bless everyone, and have a good day/night ❤️
sorry to say but… you actually cant dance-
Id rather have all those problems then be unattractive and unhealthy.
Beautiful dancing
So I am also skinny as fuck, but im a guy, im a gaint dude, around 6,2, broad shoulders and hips, I have the waist size of a woman if im right it was like 40 or something, and so I don't have the issue of poking in new holes because the belt doesn't fit tightly around my waist to keep the pants up, I have poke new holes because the belt doesn't wrap around my waist, my belt that I worn for years cant get to the orgianl holes anymore, I have to use the hole I made, because my waist got bigger, along with everything else, im a very big dude who is still considered skinny.
Girl SAME
You just perfect! ❤
Happens to me to
Belts... Come in different sizes...
This is so accurate I'm not even kidding
Naw you can dance beautifully
The thing is I'm the kind of skinny where I'm not proportionally skinny really, I'm just so small that there's no other way to describe it, so cold all the time
As a skinny man I agree with these statements
I thought these problems were just me😂
Well atleast we arent fa- canceled
There’s no need to curse
This is how to make fat people happy
Don't think dancing is a skinny problem
I RELATE TO THIS LIKE 100% WOW
This is so true or the wrist thing or I could break you like a twig but I don’t really get cold fast
I wish I could like this video twice, just for the dance
The comments are the worst
jayus. thanks for saying all this things to me cause i have been feeling like I'm fat asf and realise i have the same problem as you 😇✨✨
I was skinny when I was a kid like bones skinny but now I'm plus size I wud definitely like to be smaller not as small as I was then but like at least 50 pounds lighter mabye jayus is a nice size not to big and I personally at least don't think to small but everyone is always going to have a problem with there own body it sucks but it's how it js
Everything except 3 applies for being fat aswell
As someone who is freakishly skinny I can confirm these are true
LMAO THE DANCING PART😭 SLAYYYYY 😍🤙
I’m skinny and most of this is true for me
I've never been happier to be chubby
I am skinny too I am 12 and I weigh 81
Wht the fa*ck
I get the braid belts because of that haha
The way she danced 😂😂😂 I wish I danced like that
BUT YOU CAN DANCE
No you can definitely dance yeah
Yup. All of this is fax no printer
This is so me0-0
That last one was a lie
Who cares you're beautiful ❤️
This video perfectly describes my life.
Same
I relate to this to much I’ve heard the “I’m afraid your gonna blow away in the wind” and “you gotta eat more” way to many times
I’m skinny and I hate it when I get new good pants and they fall down and don’t fit
I have experience
As a skinny person I can say that all of these are true
Dancing is also a problem for tall people
Skinny people can dance 😂 Michael Jackson 🤷🏻‍♂️
I am 13 pretty skinny and I wheigh about 111.6 pounds
Relatable
😐,You hurt mee💔
Bruhhhhhhh I’m skinny too and I can literally relate
Can't dance are not just for skinny people. Just you
Truest thing ever
Soo you think I'm skinny 😏
Bruh I’m so skinny I’m 12 and I weigh 70 pounds 😂
Dude this is just so true
Not dancing is just a product of being white
As a skinney person wgo can dance, i approve of your moves theyre certified professional
I completely agree and the “eat something” is the worst cause I have a super high metabolism so even eating a buffet wouldn’t add weight but no one gets that so they think I just starve myself and are sometimes super rude about it
The belt one is too relatable
All about me
BEST DANCER EVER! I'd be honored to fuck the club up with you. lmfao
That's some nice moovs
High Metabolism be killing me.
Omg yes I can relate but I’m a healthy weight but skinny lol
I skinny as hell
As a kid, I had a lot of those problems. Except, I wasn’t skinny.
relatable asf
nahh bc i get cold when its hot🤨
I got one of those like ratcheting belts because I thought it might work better, but nope, and you can't even add new holes. I had to just pull it tight and hope to god the friction would hold it in place all day.
Oh don’t worry I weigh 53 pounds
Bro I weigh that much and I’m NINE
Like me I'm 12 year old and just reached 100 pounds
This is so true
Me: * happy and healthy * Family: “You’re as skinny as a twig. You should go get some meat on your bones.”  Me: * is 8 years old and thinks that I need to eat more junk so that I can gain more weight * Me: * is still skinny but is now unhealthy *
I’m not skinny and I can’t dance
I've always been super skinny and I agree with number 5. A lot of times I'll get comments about my body and it hurts. A lot of people don't realize that I'm actually consistently gaining weight but I get stupid comments all the time.
Also the fact that everytime I hit something, it hurts 10 times worse than what others feel
Look at my sis she is so skinny and she only eats salads she really cares about calories and she really wants to be skinny
Well Lesbians and Racists Normally Can't dance so....
Omg this is so true
Me who's very skinny and likes being cold: I have infinite power!
Girl ur body is better than me  I'm a man ok  From naruto
Bro I love your dancing it’s better then Chicken
Same with me but im still skinny and they tuant me alot
It’s ok bella I think your dance skills are amazing 😂
Wait she played basketball? And where
How tall are you
Being skinny is atleast better that being fat. belive me, i would know 😔
Why is this so true but also what hurts the most is when people say u are so skinny and they don’t see a problem with it x
All of that is true
The do you eat thing makes me sick they say that shit all the time. Or be like bro you need the lift.
I'm 5'9 200 ibs and I get these same problems
Truth.
Let's appreciate her dance at the end! Lmaoo😂😂
We also have the advantage of fitting into tight spaces
I can relate
Everything is true exept the part where I get cold...I guess its my metabolism...
The one with the jeans is so truee like i go to a 1000 stores just to find jeans
smooth moves
I was once underweight, never had any of this problems, now I am much heavier/ stronger. Almost nothing changed much at all, surprisingly
Damn she breaking it down
The last to are so true
I have a cousin who's one year younger than me but we have a 20 pound difference he is a very picky eater and just spends most of his day playing GTA V
It's worse when you're tall and skinny. Finding pants is impossible
As a skinny person, all of those are so true-
I just realized, how f***ing tall are you?!
Beside the belt one... these all happen to big people too. Skinny people have asked other skinny people if they eat. I've seen it happen many times at the restaurant I work.
Omg this is so reliable
I FEEL THIS SO MUCH!!!!
Same here :(
Where'd you get your pants?
Jayus: I can't dance (Proceeds to dance)
With all the dancing, you're actually rather adorable lol. Keep up the good work with the videos. They're awesome!! (Also I'm overweight and I still have the same problem with the pants and belt, for a fat guy, I have no hips or ass...)
Gurl you got moves don't lie to your self
THATS FREAKING ME
Are you a lesbian, just asking
Easy just stop doing crakk
The Dance 😂😊👏🏻
This is fucking fax 😗
I look like a noodle or a string bean and I'm the human version of a stick bug
You dance better then me lmao
Rel asf.. Laying on the back is a problem too
I have the same problem
I struggle with this every day I’m so skinny
I am skinny as hell and i won so many turnaments in dance that i cant even count them so if you are skinny it doesnt mean you cant dance
Omg same
Yes I’m skinny and I’m always cold, my sis is like it’s not cold YES IT IS
I'm skinny as heck and I can say...yeah this is true
After I lost weight, sitting in a chair for too long would start to hurt my back or my butt. 275-169lbs
U can dance
Oh my god.. this is so true
This is all facts
I’m skinny af too and I have to do everything and my mom all ways tells me that I don’t eat enough
I just want skirts that’ll fit me 😭
Bro you dance better than me 😩
AND THEN THE BELT POKES OUT OF YOUR CLOTHING
As a skinny, I can relate
Thick problems -stilling in chair with arm rest constricted  thighs and hurts sooo bad. -over heating never get to wear the cute outs I buy cause I’ll burn up. -laying down booba choke hold 😂 -finding clothes that fit conferrable and I look good in rare
Dude I know a person who is a female and they are 52 kg WTF!!
When u were dancing i laughed so hard (lol)
I can relate
Agreed.
I can relate
You're still a better dancer than me 🤣
My friends always tell me to eat a burger, it's sad but I guess it's fine for me being skinny, I relate to you mam
I’ve had people in school say that I look like a holocaust survivor even my teachers have told me this they are so lucky I have a dark sense of humor and carried around two xylophone mallets and told them to try playing megalovania on my spine 🤣
Fat perks
Lol same
66 pounds?!
Lmao #5 my grandma and mom would always say to me as a small kid
I like the way you   Dance! It's like I'm seeing an  Extra Triacetrial  Just kidding 😆✌️  Btw I really like the videos you make about facts and etc.
Use to be very skinny (I've gained a lot of weight now) and these are all true, especially the society one. Apparently people would make fun of me and my brother for being so skinny.
I'm very skinny and never cold, that one is just genetics
Is this a female version of npesta?
Don't worry dude u still dance better than me😌😌
I can't dance either
I’m also skinny as fuck. Back in 8th grade, we were doing weigh ins. I was 90 pounds or somethings. So my teacher recorded it and pulled me off to the side to ask if my parents feed me. I was kinda offended to say the least.
Last one is just white people problems
I understand you entirely lol.
K so like, how do I gain weight?
I can relate to all of these except for the dancing I can dance
My family doesn’t talk about my diet because I may weigh 160 but I eat what my brother father mother and sister eat
Oml I feel ya, but I'm 91 lbs and I'm 13
Personally I think that people asking if you're eating is good if you're skinny (when they don't make any stupid comments about your body) bc you never know what's going on. I know it might be annoying for the ones who get that question all the time but if it's asked genuinely with concern... Bc it's hard when people say things like "OMG you got so skinny you look so good now" and you have an eating disorder. Why is being skinny seen like it's the only good thing?  Maybe I went a little deep with this but it's just a reflection
I love your dance
Nah the last 1 is just a personal problem
Me skinny and plays a lot of video games
4 and 5 ARE SOOO TRUEEE
ITS SO TRUE😭😭😭😭😭
Seems like me 4yrz ago and female
Bruh speaking the fucking truth
Bro true I legit want to have to meat on my bones and I don't gain weight from eating 😩
Im skinny too
Me being skinny and dancing is my passion    *✨am just built different✨*
You just explained my life
The society one is so true. Once my friend’s dad told me that I need to eat more because I’m too skinny.   I eat all the food in my house all the time.
I was very skinny, all true but the dance, thats not an excuse 😂😂😂
Your belt doesn't fit. Is a fat person problem toooo. Lmao I have to poke extra holes cause the belt is too small. Sitting down hurts my ass fat. I ligit feel like a mountain half of the time. And I can't dance
So true but gaining weight sucks
Yeah
Ita funny cause my freinds call me a twig and have seen how much I eat and have inspected my body like im an alien they are always like "so your sure you arnt just a living black hole" "I'm sure" "YOU ATE THREE BIG MACS IN 30 SECONDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOUR NOT A BLACKHOLE"
Are you gay? Just curious.  Not a bad thing . Not a bad guy.  Just asking.
the fifth one is so relatable all my relatives are just forcing me to eat im only 10 💀
I'm curvy a.f and I can't Dance either 😂
Squid Game Dreams Edition-https://youtu.be/3fGorSqEtNw
Can’t dancing isn’t a skinny problem, you just need to learn
ur feet be big. like mine be big. feet are crazy.
As a skinny man, can confirm that I get cold very easily and shivering at a 50°f, and feel like I'm dying in 80°f with humidity. And I eat like a fat person with an eating disorder, no offense to anyone that actually is that, just saying that I'm still skinny af lol. We're also fairly easy to knock over. Can also confirm my ass bones hurt if the seat isn't cushioned and it's uncomfortable to sleep on my stomach. Not sure about anyone else, but I'm suffocating if my head is lying on more than one pillow, and yes I mean with my head on top of 2 or more pillows
I have all of them and everyone thinks yassss let’s be skinny I just want to say good luck
BRO I FEEL YOU IM SO SKINNY IM 13 AND I WEIGH 62 POUNDS WTF
Now, gimme tips cuz i too am skinny 🥺
Got this one right on point, I’ve been skinny my entire life and people are always concerned that something is wrong.. it’s just skinny people problems. Love watching your shorts Bella 👏🏻
I'm literally a stick I can relate 😂
Jayus: I can’t dance Also jayus: proceeds to be better than Michael Jackson
Preach miss gurl!! 🙌🏼 I literally eat like a hog but I’m so skinny omg 😱 I don’t understand
Just mainline some bacon then yer gtg
hahahahahahaha how can I give more likes ?!?!
The fact that all it true for me
another one is lower back pain a lot.Idk but i have this shit and its damn annoying
as someone who has always been skinny and who struggles to gain weight, the comments people make is horrible. ⟟ was like 6 and a grown woman told me to “turn to jesus and your eating disorder will be fixed” ⟟ didn’t even have an eating disorder at the time, and ⟟ was 6 so ⟟ didn’t even know what that meant.
That always happens to me I wake up and I always think my clothes are getting bigger
Dude, Im friggin fat and I can't dance. Your dancing is better than mine lol. 😆
Id still.marry you lolz
I can relate 100%
Someone understands
Bro i eat the same i always did and actually i was a lil chubby too. But as soon as a turned 13, i instantly turned like 5 '8 and since then I'm skinny as fuck
The end 😂😙
I… I thought these were an everybody problem ;-;
I feel the same ;v;
I'm short, hated head pats.
Thank u now I can show my cousins this so they do kill me
Actually a pretty good dancer
"Laying down like this for too long leaves bruises on my ribs" Uhm... I must say, I've been right on the line of underweight my entire life, and I've never gotten rib bruises by laying like that
This is literally me. I'm 176cm, and weights only under 50kg. It's hard to buy a good fit clothes, especially jeans. Good fit, the jeans is too short, long jeans, your bum is too flat
Im skinny but i can eat like 2 big macs from McDonald's
I’m skinny to 😿
ARE WE THE SAME PERSON?!!?
The belt is so true
Accurate as fuck
Someone get her a tripple whopper
Same problems
Soooo, kinda the same issues I have as a thick person?- but being made fun of for being fat as a kid?
10 our of 10 can relate. Currently wrapped in a blanket due to being cold since im skinny as can be.
Ur moves are still better than mine tho
Yep
This is so true
Yeah im really skinny to and yeah i could agree
Same
Jayus: I’ve bin skinny as f#ck Me: you lucky cuz I’m fat as f#ck
Been skinny my entire life (old guy). Last time in the hospital, a nurse told me I looked like someone had plucked big bird. She wasn't wrong. But still
A lot of people would tell me to go eat something. It was mostly people at school, and once I would eat something, they would make fun of me saying that I eat too much.
I relate to almost all but I dont bruises when I lay down like that
Wow the best dance moves ever 👌👌👌👌👌
Me too
to me its "your belt wont fit? oh you gotta poke new holes... oh your belt is too thick to poke a new hole? well too fucking bad 🥰"
Goin thru it ngl
Oh thats why im always cold
Yea I'm skinny as hell to it's like anytime I try to gain just a little bit of weight so I look normal no back to being skinny and literally 5 days
Omg bro the sitting down one I can relate to so much. As a kid it was like trying balance on a piece of hard metal while sitting. And every time you rock you could feel your bone and it hurt so much. 😭
I know how it feels
Dude just eat like crazy and you won’t be skinny anymore
Many of the examples doesn’t make sense, because it has nothing to do with being skinny
I k r QnQ
*I CAN RELATE TO ALL OF THESE.*  1. Sitting will hurt a little for me on almost anything besides things like couches and beds.  2.  I refuse to lay on my chest at all because i have pectus carinatum.  3. I have a giant fluffy blanket to keep me warm. And whenever i'm not in it, i'll start to freeze in my cold ass room.  4. There's a reason why i don't wear jeans.. Belts....  5. The comments are scary. People have always told me if i don't get meat on my bones, i'll end up in a hospital bed and get forced to have a tube down my throat to give me food. Which scared the living shit out of me when i was younger.  BONUS. I have a chest disorder called pectus carinatum. Basically my breastbone protrudes outwards. And since im underweight, i look like i'm being starved to death.  Any sort of pressure (like pushing) i put on my chest will hurt. But its not painfully hurtful.  I'm currently at around 5'6-5'7 in height, and the weight for any male at that height is around 130Ibs. And i weigh only 103Ibs. But i've been eating better, and trying to get up to that weight i need to be at.
This is so me
Not being able to dance is more of a white people problem
Girl you dance better then me
My brother has the opposite problem He's cubby as hell so gets hot easily ... We're filipino, we live in the tropics- Also I think this is a problem for alot of people, but fUCK my legs are skinnier than my thighs or the rest of my body so it get so cold easily
All are right
Another annoying thing: People doing this 👌 around  my wrist and saying "your wrist is skinny, like a twig"
I RELATE WITH EVERY PROBLEM!! 😂😂😂
Why Is Being Called “Skinny” Offensive Cause Idk If This Is Just Me But THAT IS A COMPLEMENT TO ME LIKE TFFF?? I’m Always Called “Fat” Or I Should “Stop Eating” LIKE GODDAMN I WISH I COULD BE CALLED SKINNY That Would Boost My Confidence Tbh CAUSE I’M NOT EVEN FAT That’s The Issue (I’m Not That Skinny Either I’m Like Ig Average I Weigh 110 Pounds) LIKE?? I HATE When People Say They Hate That There Skinny Or It’s So Rude If Someone Calls Them Skinny AT LEAST YOU AREN’T FAT
Think about it this way. You have more rhythm than my dad and I.
Yes thank you I’ve also been so freaking skinny my whole life and you can’t lean back on a plastic chair because it hurts my spine
Ummm hate to tell you but some of thoses are everyone problems
Us skinny people have it bad
I’m 13 and just hit 90 lbs and I had to poke a hole almost 5 inches away from the smallest hole, and man I’ve dealt with the comments so stay strong skinny squad!
Omg same  im really skinny all the stuff happens to me xD
Same
My new favorite thing to say when someone calls me skinny is, no I’m healthy, and if they try to say something else I say how when I go to the doctor, the doctor says everything looks good keep doing what your doing.
I get these cause I’m skinny as fuck to
Hello fellow string bean, glad someone else shares my problems ;-;
You be skinny asf but then wanna eat everything
I also eat a lot (adhd makes me eat less still though) and are still skinny
Yesssss. I literally had to poke a new hole in my belt a day ago
I mean it’s healthier than being extra fat, plus it’s not super skinny I’ve seen people who have like no body fat at all
I have this pain
MINE CLOTHES ARE TOO TIGHT- IMA CHUBBY TRANS-
I feel this
So true
It’s the dance moves for me get  it gurl lol I go through the same thing tho
Another skinny person here to confirm that we can NOT dance
Fat people problems always hot  feet   Hurting  always in the kitchen  when walking tired ?
All if this is true  I have to wear a jacket everywhere I go
all I can say is … FR
I'm just like you and been telling like some names like chpostick that hurts me sso much
I feel u
Yeeeeah, the "can't dance" problem isn't because you're skinny, it's just because you can't dance lmao
I have the same problems it sucks
I can relate to this lol I went to a hotel and took off my shirt to swim in the pool, next thing I know “This kid is literally skin and bones”
Exactly im too tall but skinny asf
Yesss all of these are super true. Especially the sitting down and the cold one. I seriously start shivering if the atmosphere is under 75
Plus, everything hurts a thousand times worse. Just think about it, you don't have layers of skin to cushion your nerves if you hit something. If I bump into a table it's hitting straight bone and it hurts like hell
Literally, back then the people around me kept saying I was too skinny and now they tell me I'm too fat.......LIKE MAKE UP YOUR MIND💀
So true people always say stuff like that to me
This is so true
I’m skinny too, I just started bulking up at my local gym and I’m already seeing results. Just got to eat right and stay consistent.
But you are tall
I can relate
the dancing my just be u
I have all of these problems
Si pasa
I think you just can't dance I don't think it involves weight...
omg yes everyone tells me to get like 3 burgers, when i sit the pain is real, i get lot of bruises laying down, i get freezing cold at night, and poking holes in my belt never work
So true
I am on ur gang 😂
The belt one hit
This is girl is soo funny 🤣
Amazing dancing😎👍
THANK GOD SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS
In my school there was one of my friends that was so skinny we used to say the shower at his house only had one hole
I'll trade you my fat problems for your skinny ones just warning they're pretty much the same just people tell me not to eat anything
I’m a fucking fatass and can’t dance so don’t feel bad
Relatable
I'd get jiggy with it
SHE SPOKE STRAIGHT FACTS.
BRO I HAVE THE SAME EXACT COVERS
I deal with this too :(
This is the single most relatable video i've watched all year long
Fax last year I was 5'5 90lbs now I'm 5'8 110 and I'm not made fun of as much and that was so fax
A fast way to gain weight, please help
Most relatable thing eveer
Am somewhat skinny :)
Skinny in a culture of calorie reduced food
bro i cant get my med dosage upped because of my WEIGHT BRO. “i don’t want to risk seizures” I DONT CARE GIVE ME MY DOPAMINE
Stop cussing so much....we get the point...
Nah those dance skills are on point
Problems of being skinny: Can't dance  K-Idols: Ha! Jokes on you!
Yep I have all these problems and I'm still a kid!
I would rather have that then being fat Wich is what I am
I know I am sitting right now it hurts
i have this problem to but yeah
That’s my mom like it’s sad
There’s actually a medication for that and I have to take it because of how thin I am and no it’s not forever just for like 3 months
Same here     Unlike yo mama!
Dats true
I understand everything you say except for the last one you cannot dance
"I can't dance" Fucking kills it
I am worry about I am little bit fat
Mhm yup these are all true
im not skinny but i have those problems
Bruh betting fat isn't all fun games like when you run like for 2 seconds you ducking sweat and it's always so damn hot like imagine being that one sheep with a crap ton of wool on it, it sucks also gaining weight is a lot easier then losing weight
But you CAN dance 😎😎😎😎 !!!
YES FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS
You can dance
"I wish I were as thin as you" no you don't. Its its own hell. Some people have a hard time losing weight. some have problems gaining it. Both is bad.
i lost 10 pounds so i used to be 150 a few weeks ago  im 12
Yeah it’s sucks I’m really skinny and people are always calling me a stick
Jayus:"I've been skinny as f#ck" Me:"I've been buff"    (Buff mean big ugly fat fella)
Nobody can dance
I get those comments and like I don't really care I mean I'm not proud of it but I'm not Really Ashamed I'm just used to it because my family makes  jokes around like that so I never took offense i didn't really know being called skinny would hurt someone because like people take it as a complement? Yeah but I thought being called fat was body shaming not being called skinny XD
So tall
I’m 12 and weight 28 kilograms. I’M SO SKINNY MY RIBS ARE VEEEEERY VISIBLE
So true thoi
It's never you who has the problem. It's always society that's wrong.
I‘ll happily give you some of my isolation. I can assure you, my pants dont fit either lol
You can’t dance because you are lesbian not because you are skinny🤦‍♀️
Anyone else eat the cheese of there hands when they eat stuff like gold fish
The dancing thing has nothing to do with being skinny.
My friend is skinny and says people tell her to eat more but now I understand her more now
That's better than I can dance
Lol I was the same!!! Gained a bit of covid weight tho
I think not being able to dance it’s just you
,,Skinny people can't dance" Michael Jackson : hold my beer
That’s the problem with me and when she said “that’s messed up to say to a kid” my whole family says that edit: all theses problems for ne
As somebody who gets made fun of for being to skinny, all of these things are so true, especially the getting cold one
when those little shits in school used to do this 👌🏾 bullshit around your wrist was the worst
I only see perfect dancing there. I dance like that too and everybody should.
This is a woman???
Jayus: I can’t dance Also jayus: pulls some of the smoothest moves on the fcking planet
Her : I can’t dance   Me : YES YOU CAN I’M THE ONE WHO CaNT
I’m shortest kid in class and probably skinniest everybody just picks on me I hate it
Thats som good dance moves u got there
66 POUNDS?!! DANG GIRL IM ONLY 11 AND IM FRICKING 87.6 POUNDS 😭
I agree ;-;
Me also being tall and skinny I can’t dance either 😭
Who else loves the dance moves
Yes you can dance you busting a move what you mean.
Bro I’m almost 15 and I’m not even 100 pounds. It sucks
Thats just me its just like  People: omg you ok? People:you look like youre sick? People: you look cold go to bed! My  mom: you are under 10kg!? My mom:you are so long i thing youre gonna break in the wind! Me:🐐😑
I’m the exact same way
I dont mind the belt thing lol, I like baggy clothes Theyre comfortable The bone thing hurts so that sucks The worst thing is I cant ever get beefed no matter how much I try to bulk up because I still look scrawny af
My friends mom always says im too skinny
I am skinny af and yes all but one I am a dancer and I am amazing at it
I used to have a bed that was springy. I would sleep in my stomach, and when I tried to get up in the morning, the springs had hooked onto my ribs because there was only skin protecting them. I'd try to get up and be stuck to the mattress for a split second
The dance 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😂😂😂😭
Why is this so true…
Go eat a hotdog
My poor friend has to go thru all of this- and then she's pretty tall for her age, so people always make fun of her for that as well
wish I could relate but I’m short and fat and you’re like 1.9m you’re basically skinny without even trying bro, for the rest of us plebs down on the ground that get fat at 1300cals it’s never going to be relatable
People say that they feel like when they hold my arm it will snap in half
When I heard "really cold", I thought "you better get urself that girlfriend quick, you might need the cuddles"🤣
Brooo thank you for this video
Me who can relate to every fucking thing 👁👄👁
Wait JUST EAT F#CKING COWS IM SKINNY TO AND I ATE A F#CKING COW
The eating one is so true I hate it when people say “go eat something you need it” like I eat a crap ton I just don’t gain any weight
This is funny because I can relate to all of this
Okay I had to suffer thru plenty of swearing but we finally got to the “go eat a burger” comment which is like super annoying comment bc I do eat a lot of food and I just don’t gain weight. It’s not a disorder Ig I just have a fast metabolism or whatever but some girl in my class called me “small and breakable” it didn’t hurt my feelings but it stuck w me.
Uhh it was funny when u danced
Same hereeee dudeeeeee
BEST DANCE IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
I am also extremely skinny have the same problems
Facts
Yep this seems about right  Don't forget getting easily crushed by others events you know running , festival rides , buses
Yep this seems about right  Don't forget getting easily crushed by others events you know running , festival rides , buses
True
I fucking hate being skinny it’s so annoying :0!

You should do Skinnys tall people problems
You’re 66 lbs and 6’ 2
I'm straight but this girl is just so..😫
So true
Same
I got called out
Facts SKINNY facts
Im also assuming like me moving causes your knees to crack like knuckles
I wish I had a perfect weight, tried to do push ups and when I successfully did it three times my shoulders want to DIE
Oh my gawd I found the female me 😅
I’m skinny too
Eating disorders come in many different ways but surprisingly people don’t know this
How about constantly being told you need to go to drug rehab...... When you've never done drugs a day in your life
The whole kpop Industry seeing how she said she can't dance just cause' she's skinny: 👁__👁
I don’t think that last one is a skinny person problem just a you problem
The end 😂😂😂 I fucking laughed so hard 😂😂😂😂
As a certified skinny boi, this is all true
I have the same problems
Welp I'm skinny asf too my guy
Thst was amazing dancing
I am 12 years old and I can’t find really any pants that fit me it’s always the waste in the leg sent it doesn’t make me happy and my legs went numb when I sat on the toilet for the longest time and sometimes when I’m laying down on the floor I have to put a pillow on my rib cage and lay on the carpet but it still hurts and I’m cold all the time and I can’t even talk about society
As a fellow stick I can vouch for all of these
Just say it what gender you are
I’m skinny to
I think you're awesome and not that bad of a videos of YOURSELF that you been doing keep doing what you're doing you will be great.....live on like a wolf...
You go girl
Bieng fat I can relate, to the belt thing
If you don't land in the very middle you get rinsed for your weight, I was slightly over weight, my friends where slightly underweight and we got the piss taken out of us for years
I Can't Dance she says me over here: girl that sounds like a you problem
I can confirm these, not as tall tho
I swear if anyone comments on my weight oNE MORE TIME IM GONNA COMMIT ARSON-
Sounds like fat people problems too lol I was 290 in highschool. You're beautiful
I feel everything except for the last one cuz my mom forces me to dance with her and my family every Friday night
I have the same problems...
Ok come on, that you can't dance has nothing to do with weight that's just you.
You perfect the way you arr
I love your vids they're friggin hilarious. I hate saying this, but you're right. You can't dance, but you sure do look like your having fun, so who the hell cares?
can relate
My mother tells me “your a skeleton girl” and it just makes me sad
Yeah but you can at least wear a belt if you really have to, now tall people clothes just don’t fit and I’m gonna have to special order shoes
I've done both. At 18 I was 6ft and  weighed 125 pounds even though I ate like a fucking champion. 5 years later I was 230 pounds
im also skinny but i enrole in dance class
Wdym Jayus? Those dance moves are badass B)
STOP DANCING  FOR EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😤😤😤👎👎👎😡😡
Another one: people really be complimenting you because they want to be skinny but god what do they know.
Fax
I’m short and on the skinny side so I feel your pain and short people pain
Ay yo! That picture with you in a swimsuit... That is as flat as the ancient people viewed the earth at the time...     But not gonna lie you're beautiful and cute... And...  [Deleted]
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS I have such a fast metabolism that I have to constantly at least snack or I get weak in like 2 hours... I have to go to the toilet really often too My kindergarden teachers called the police on my parents because they thought they did not give me food .________.
I used to really f$cking skinny now I am normal and everything she said is true
THANK YOU.
Buy a belt that fits they make them in different measurements
Literally ALL of this. Just told someone all these facts the other day. I've been at a steady 103-105 the last year or so and it sucks! Lmao
True I'm skinny too. 😆
I work out so my skinniness was solved by just bulking constantly.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS IM SKINNY AS HELL
Me too 😭
Nah the dance ones on u I’m skinny as shit and be gettin sturdy
me experiencing all this shit be like 😁💢 and still am 😀 and get made fun of
the same as always and my family even said i might not be from this family, crazy theory and my head just wanna be nuked evrytime i think about it, i eat like five burgers and just anything but the only thing growing is my belly, i hate it, my belly isnt even growing that much to, like 1 inch/5year maybe, i can control my belly to be skinny but how the hell do i move the fat on my butt cuz damn my but feels numb,
Everything else yes but I think dancing is just just u.
I think your ok at dancing 😂😂
Damn the sitting one, lying one and cold are so true
Same
Everyone is purfect
You are an ectomorph, if you don't know it already you might want to look up that phrase.
Jayus you actually dance quite nicely, those were one of the best freestyle moves ive ever seen.
I have been freezing all week and I trip a lot- and if I lay down like that its like someone killed me      *You Are Very Cool*
I needed this video
R u saying skinny or slim? Remember they have their differences  Ur slim, not skinny
tbh that was pretty good compared to me
Neither can I I can't dance but I'm healthy weight
Fat people problems are things like being denied health care, or treatment because doctors refuse to examine you and say come back when you loose weight then the problem is almost never related to weight
I cant dance
Yes I very much relate it’s soooo annoying
So at the end what your saying is the you need to be fat to be a superior dancer      Ps  no hate it’s just a joke
And people will grab you when wind flows ...... Because you'll fly like a kite  😑😑 LIKE IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME
I am skinny af also
Shits true af
Oh m god, this is so true.. even my own family members sy this🤦‍♀️🤣
"I can't dance" Me: well get it i guess...
now im actually grateful for my curviness
Now about sit ups…….
I just like you but I a kid ofc
Why can I relate 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is so true I'm skinny
Lel I am 66 kgs
I’m skinny and this is so relatable
Another one is, I am so skinny that I am afraid to take my shirt out in front of someone because there's just a layer skin over my ribs so you can see every single bone in my chest 😂😂.
We can’t dance because we are skinny and the air conditioner make it a tiny bit cold so your body just doesn’t move correctly because we lengthy biooosss
I feel you I’m literally one of the skinniest kids in my grade
Dancing....I think that’s just u?
No! You dance better than me i literally have to pull my drawstrings so frikin tight
What really I thought that being skinny is cool
So relatable 😂
This is so relatable especially the society one, I just started middle school and this girl walked up to me and was like, “do you not eat? Or do you just work out?” I felt so embarrassed, but I just said, “I’m a picky eater and I don’t workout” and when I was saying that I was just crying inside bc people are always saying something about me being skinny and it hurts me a lot, the same thing is with my forehead, people are always saying something about how big my forehead is and like I said, it hurts, then there is finding clothes that fit me, I hate wearing tight stuff on me bc it proves just how skinny I am and that’s exactly why I wear baggy clothing, so pls just love ur body, you don’t have to listen to other ppls comments on how you look, as long as you love it, wear it💕😊
I really feel like this lady is one of my people's.        I feel that cold temperature, I can't even hold it!!!
Yoo Word bro!! Edit: always getting called a crack head.
You can start a bulk diet
I totally am like this to 😂
Being tall and skinny is painful. Hits head on light in kitchen and almost knocks you over, cannot find a comfortable position to sit in and always hungry 247
So true
This is to relatable 😭
Im Skinny and i can relate to rhis
I am muscular fatish
Me and u both I’m supper skinny I’m in 5 th grade and a  3 rd grader ways more than me
Your a girl I did not know that
Yup!!! The belt thing hit home hard 😑😅😂
its sad because im a kid and my parents tell me to eat more but they compare to other kids so thats the reason im not eating then they yell at me to eat more and that im not live on my own if they died
Most of these apply to me
Damn she skinny.  The scale only went to 67 lbs!!!
Same
Damn im skinny
These moves are crazy
Better than I can dance
I don’t get cold fast I’m 5’4 and 85 pounds give or take depends on season
Why can I relate so much?? 🥲🥲
Saying fuck every other second is so funny hahaha
it's so hecking relatable like being skinny- and if you live in a joint family? haha your life will surely turn into a living hell by just "compliments" trust me dude it's fucked up
It hurts when i sit😭😭😭
I tried wearing watches but I just never could
I'm 12 and everyone calls me stick like I'm not even that skinny but like Uuuugh
Not me who’s as skinny as her
OMG THIS IS SO FREAKIN TRUE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM BECAUSE IM REALL SKINNY AND ITS LIKE NOT THE BEST THAT EVERYONE SAYS IT IS AND WERE NOT EVEN GONNA TALK ABOUT MY DANCE MOVES😩😭
Can’t relate but everyone’s got struggles
Brooo I thought I was the only one! My mom always has to sew or pin my pants!! And one time I thought I was dying when my chest hurt from lying down!!and I just thought that my house was just cold 🥶
That dancing tho lol
every thing you said i agree on
You can dance-
I'm skinny to
The getting cold one is so true
Onlyjayus: I CAN'T DANCE  Me: Well you can dance better than me
Same
My nickname is litterlly bones☠
I used to relate at 6’5, 140lbs, but now I guess I hit my second growth spurt and I’m at a healthy 200lbs.
Jayus: I CANT DANCE! Also Jayus dancing pretty good
But I'm fat and all of these are my problems too except I can't wear belts 🤣 and instead of being told to eat I was told "go on a diet" when I was literally a child and it really fucked me up as well.
I have the same thing I know what you go though
I CAN RELATE SOOO MUCH
I'd still like to be skinny.
Just the right one
All the skinny people I know dance really well actually….
My Aunty always tells me that I should eat something 😪😂
Lucky
😂 the belt I'm wearing now goes almost 2 rounds around my waist.
Soooo true
You can get your point across just fine without the foul language.  Especially using the Lords name in vane!  Very unattractive!
Wait you a gril?!?!?!
I felt this video so mf hard
Rather skinny than fat any day bro, fat is lifetime problem with everything everyday, be happy you skinny
I'm pretty sure not being able to dance is related to your skill level more so than your level of weight
Eat 93 Pizza's you will put on weight I know I'm a huge boi love your content and this is not hate
Same but except 5
In sweatpants and leggings I would wear safety pins, because nothing would fit me. And I sleep with 10 blankets on all year round.
What about how racist you are
same bro same 😔 even now as an adult, some random karen will come up to me and ask if i have an abusive family/boyfriend thats starving me and im like "tf???". My brothers who are also naturally skinny dont even get comments like that tho. Its always just been me who gets these comments. But as soon as i go out with my brothers? its immediately understood that its genetic :/
If Nurses And Doctors Can Make People Donate Fat And meat For Skinny Peoples I Might Be The First one to Donate 50% of my fat ._.
You dance great!:)
You are right        You can’t dance
Lmao it pisses me off when i see nothing but but love for people who are overweight but if you’re skinny, you must have it perfect so you need to be taken down a notch, it makes no sense. Im 18, 5’10, 140 pounds and i eat 3500 calories a day, i have a high metabolism and i never sit down what the fuck do you want me to do about it
Same skinny as me
I have the same or similar problems but I’m kinda fat not skinny at all 😭
I can’t sit for more than half an hour without my bony bottom hurting. And I’m always cold. It’s very annoying. Being tall and skinny is even worse lol. When I was younger I could NEVER find anything that I could wear without a belt and without it being above my ankles 😂
I don't know what you mean when you say you can dance, those are the most amazing moves I've seen in my life😤😌
That hurts to say I've been skinny since kindergarten and I'm still that size
Relatable asf. I skinny asf too sista
2 things: BALLING! I see you! #2: Never dance again 😑😂
FACTS!!!
Yeah, what about people that have had a beer belly since birth but never drank beer in the past lmao
Wtf is this me
I can’t lay down too long or my back and hips hurt. I’m skinny as shit too
The dancing is better than mine
I am skinny too and i can agree with all
Never dance again please,😅😂
My body )( what I wish it was more like) (
I agree 100% but I am still not at a healthy weight.
omg yes. Please. I fall into this category. It indeed sucks :/  Please don't come up to a skinny person and say "do you eat??" Its very rude tbh
Oh i eat alot but ughhh i get nooo meat i'll eat now LIKE OLOT MAYBE SOME ICECREAM
I relate to this so much, and as a skinny eleven year old child. Respectfully, stfu it's none of your business if I eat or not that's actually really upsetting and I'm gaining and losing weight and when I gain weight you say I've gotten so fat and I subconsciously stop eating pls stop. Thanks for listening to my rant, I have history homework and really bad day to keep pushing through, bys
I didnt expect to relate to this so much
Being skinny isnt bad stuoid
I was a skinny kid, now middle aged, the only place I put on padding is right around my middle. Still no butt, skinny chicken legs, willow wrists. I try not to look at myself in the mirror naked
Ok but i have underweight since birth and i can relate, i have a decent weight but i look like a stick, so is my brother (he has grown alot taller) but he is extremely skinny but weighs the same as my 18 year old sister and my sister is tall too they do have 2 years age difference tho-
I can’t dance either
I so skinny to when i sit it hurts me to
Ok 👍 good to know because I am skinny like you 😀
I hear your problems I accept your problems but know fat people problems are worse and life threatening 🙃
i've been eating thrice the amount of what i've used to eat and i aint gettin fat like theres a blackhole in my stomach. i look like a freaking lollipop 🍭
Yep I am very skinny and this all happens to me still
I feel like 6 applies to at least 97% of the population
I can't twerk for shit, I have absolutely no ass. And that pants and belts thing is way to accurate, even my watch has an extra hole. And my family talks about me being skinny and needing to eat more way too often-
I can’t believe ppl said that stuff! Don’t listen to them!
Her: I CANT DANCE Me:u dance better than I could ever 😫
As a extremely skinny person I approve of this message
Someone once said “your skinny you have no right to talk about body image issues”
That is SOOOO true!!!!
Yes this is true because i was very skinny as well but i have never ever felt very cold..
Jayus, you and your dancing skills. I almost yeeted to the floor😂💖
Thank you.
Please for the love of god dont dance again 😂😂😂
You can dance plenty well 😎
Had my school contact my parents when I was young to see if they actually fed me
I was fat as f when i was 11 i was 70 mf kilograms and people called me fat LIKE F'ER IM NOT GONNA DIE
That’s me all the time
IK IM SKINNY AS HELL  I LOOK LIKE A DOOR HANDLE 😡🥺😡🥺😡
Me toooooo
Better than being fat
Yes. This is all true. (I’m also very skinny and always have been).
You can dance better than me though😭
I’m rlly skinny too and I’m glad you said some stuff. Like whenever I say it’s hard being SUPER skinny something’s everyone’s like “you should be greatfull” and it’s like BRUH LIKE WTFF
No one cares
People call me…tooth pick, skinny mini, piece of air, thin pin……..someone help me.
not to be offensive but if you want to put on some weight you have to be like start eating healthy things for just a little while personal experience because you get real fat real quick
Why did the dancing part look like a kid on crack??🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 No offence I also cant dance
Im not even 18 and ALL OF THIS IS TRUE TO ME
I 100% get this
I haven't been skinny for some time, working on it, only a bit of fat left. My kidlet, however, has skinny person problems. They also inherited my protruding ribs so like you, we get bruises if we lay on our stomachs as well. Even with my little belly, my ribs still protrude. Quite annoying.
Literally, all of those are true
Im 6feet and weight 160
I also can't dance 😔✋
I can relate to this
Getting blown away maybe? Yall need some meat on your bones  Ps: that's not an insult by the way, im really worried
Can relate. Probably because I eat and drink way to little
People always commenting on my portion sizes so i stopped eating around them altogether. Wankers.
Society is Frickin Rude to everyone
I'm tall and skinny so it just makes things worse. I can never find pants that are the right length and fit my waist. I've had many people say something too assuming that I didn't eat and stuff like that. It really does hurt expessially when your a kid
can't relate 😎👌  ...yes i'm fat 👍
Clothes that work: Child size worked for me.
Relate to everything she said lol
Respect + same thing here
I’m like 3 and a half of you
Trust
Yep, im nearly 18 and i need to use a kid sized belt
These are all true.
The part about not being able to dance is just white people stuff
Omg ima watch the dancing part a thousand times and it still won’t be enough lol 😂
My suggestion of someone ever comments on how skinny you are and how you should eat just reply okay let's got the restaurant and you can buy me some food
Wow so skinny people get bullied by society to i mean im pretty fat and people say i could be used to make grilled pork or braised pork and when your too skinny they say do you eat???!!!!! Like wtf do they want people to look like barbie dolls????!!!!!!
Lol
As a fellow skinny person I can relate Edit:The dancing is ur provlem
No insult will be  Insult won't be worse than when I went to the pool and you could see my ribs and the kids called me Auschwitz
The moment I realized I was to skinny 😖
Man I wish I had those problems
This is very relatable because I’m so skinny that when I angle my shoulder down you can see my collar bone like a pole under my skin
I’m the same haha always been 9st and never can put on weight
76 pounds im about to be 14 🥲😢
I am skinny too and i can see my ribs
I was very skinny also when I was a kid. I I lifted weights and bulked-up
As a fairly skinny person I have to admit sitting on a bike IS PAINFUL
Now do fat people problems
If your skinny you can tell that your dancing but ifyou fat... I dont if your moving left or right or back and front cuz I can't tell BTW no offense to any of you cuz I'm not perfect too.🤣🤣
Me being fat I have much worse problems not being thin like a twig
I relate to this on a celestial level
“I can dance” *proceeds to dance like Michael Jackson and ascends to heaven*
That was me and now I have an extra 15 pounds in the middle. 😅
I tell myself that I am not skinny. But I always freeze, and you can see the outline of alot of my bones. I cant lay on my stomach at all. Otherwise I bruise from the inside to the outside. And I just cant sit still so there is no problem there
I'm malnourished and I feel this video ✊🏼
Them moves do
girl I feel you I've been struggling to keep 70 lb I'm 12
I'm 50 and can wear kids size 16 reg, and weigh 125 lbs. Imagine that!
I have those problems
you're so goddamn attractive
as a very skinny person myself most of these r true for me (i dont get bruises on my ribs)
Hello I'm an advocate for the Large People of the World. Be happy for who you are. Sitting down for us will break the chair, laying down for too long will cause our brains to think "yeah your staying here forever time to shut down your basic motor functions", We have too much insulation, We have to shop for XL clothes and our pants only fit ONCE then it's a gamble when choosing our pants that will cooperate today, The Comments I receive personally are "Damn Girl you thicc!" Then they see that I'm a guy and we are both feeling awkward, and our dances include: the Happy Seal, the Titty twerk, Michellen Man Mambo, and The Pillsbury.  Be happy for who you and fuck those haters.
I’m fat
Fat people rise up
I'm skinny to and I have the exact same problems
Ladies And Gentleman I Got It's HER NOWW OHH YEAHH !!!
I can relate very much to the sitting down
Being fat hurts my tailbone chest and back
Love it...I'm skinny as fuck too, always have been...the struggle IS real, my dudes lol
Just imagine I'm 6 2 and have to eat like I'm 400 lbs just to stay at 170
last week the doctor told me to gain weight or i'll have to get an xray and ill have to eat A NASTY FUCKING MEDICINE for 6 MONTHS and i thought my surgery and injury was painful
Skinny check
Yuhhh get it I guess
Gurl I think you dance so good.
Exactly
Omg i felt this!! Im always cold!!!!!
Im fat but have all these problems
No, dancing and weight aren't correlated, I'm heavy as all hell and can't dance, only difference is people feel it when I start to dance😅
I still think it's so obnoxious when skinny people complain about their weight. Like, so you'd rather be overweight? "No...". But if you ask any overweight person they'd rather be skinny. In the movie industry, and on social media, how many overweight people do you see compared to underweight people??? Like exactly.
Me, a skinny person... THIS IS ALL TRUE T-T
I'm so happy you made a video pointing this out. People think skinny shaming isn't a real thing. But it is, thank you.
Who is she?  Her aura radiates arrogance  and yet laziness
Yea I have this it is annoying
Why us it all true tho too
Really appreciate you for doing this because people do ask me if I eat because I am really skinny and I am glad you did this.
I don't think you being skinny has anything to do with you not being able to dance. I'm like 270ish and I look worse than your demo at the end.
Umm it’s better to be skinny than fat
I actually prefer being skinny than being fat. My weight fluctuates like the currency, and when i get fat, it's difficult to have a good sleep because my stomach feels uncomfortable when i'm lying to the side, and it's even more uncomfortable when walking and running because my stomach and chest are hanging. The only thing i hate about being skinny is finding pants that fit. My pants size is currently 27, and most pants start from size 30. When i get fat, though, size 30 doesn't fit. I have no problem finding clothes that fit, as most of my clothes are a little bit oversized.
Can confirm
Im 5’1 and 120 pounds which is healthy buy I am not skinny. My best friend is 5’10 and 110 pounds. LIKE HOWWW
Please be happy with ur self some of us i trying to lose weight  its hard choclate n ice cream is really good. Just enjoy it for me.
Last one was a lie, no?
Damn really made me like being skinny a little more😂
Sitting down sucks it hurts and schools don’t know it does so school sucks more that you think
Flat as Frick too I thought you were a guy the first time I saw your channel
But like actually moving against strong winds takes some effort
I'm legit sharing this to my cousin. XD
i felt all of these on a personal level especially the comments
pathetic I have been skinny for 10 years
The dance is irelevant and you dance better den me tbh ^^
I'm fat 🤣
You are really right
I don't care who said that you can't dance you have the best dance moves
Happened to me to, finally someone that understands
HONESTLY 😭
"I can't dance"  Laughs in Michael Jackson
nono jayus I think you CAN dance
If I’m being honest you might even be better than jojo
Fax
“I can’t dance”  *kpop idols* laughing in the back
Muscle works wonders. I was 125 lbs at 5' 9" until I was 18 and went through basic training. I finally put some muscle on even though I'd been lifting for several years at that point trying to put some size on. I shot up to 160 lbs in three months. Life is way easier when you have some muscle on your frame.
No one cares
I'm just happy now that I know she's a girl! I liked her content but it drove me crazy because she literally could double his Zac Hanson!
This is facts
Eat more I was 115 at 5’11 up until  4 months ago been 170 lbs since
Same I’m really skinny
Still, I would rather be skinny than be fat
when i was maybe 7 or 8 i was wearing this sparkly pink and black leopard swimsuit (it was also a two piece) and i just remember being at a 4th of july party at my grandmas house wanting to go into this little inflatable pool and my grandma goes “you’re too skinny to be wearing that! go eat a sandwich” 🥲
I eat so much, i even ate like a whole buffet and im still not getting fat  Also ate a whole pizza a burger, spaghetti and more wtf im still skinny
I get your pain. Also, the comments I got were weird. My dad said I looked like a starving Jew. He’s a weird dad
Sleeping is so uncomfortable, you just can't find the perfect sleeping position and it's so cold too
I used to have an eating disorder and would commonly get comments at buffets and BBQs like: "Is that all you're having to eat?" Yeah...thanks for making me paranoid for most of my youth. If I'm asked that now i reply "you're having all of that fat ass?"
1 and 4 are soooooo real 🥺😭
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Ppl always told me i was so skinny so im very insecure about my body now
Don't worry I'm skinny too
All of those are so relatable expect the last depends the song if it’s good I’ll jam out. But since I’m skinny I take my time getting abs I already have an outline
Actually my sister is really skinny and all these thing are true
Heyy boy
I relate to this whole video so much
I have all of those skinny people problems LMAO
Hell I'm 5'6 132 and it still bruises my ribs
The holes in the belt is SO TRUE. I always had to ask my parents to make more holes cause my waist is small.
The sitting down one is so true
Wait wait the last one 😂….also 👀hooper❄️💙
Then there are people like me at the opposite end of the scale who are taken advantage of because we have trouble with mobility, exercise, and are just genuinely ridiculed to the max. Society seems to have created a faux sense of normality for itself. If you don’t conform to it, there’s something wrong with you.
Me, fat af, feels cold too fast, ass hurts when sitting:......
This is sooo true!
FR EXACTLYYYYY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CANT DANCE WHAT-
Being skinny doesn't affect how you dance, fool. You just suck lmao.
I had been quite chubby, bordering overweight for a good chunk of my life, but the moment my puppy fat melted away at around 19 years old, it's so dang cold all the time. So. COLD.
I’m skinny but I don’t bruise that often on my ribs. Maybe because I don’t lie down like that. But the rest is so true lol. I’ve been told to eat a burger when I’m the one who eats more than them. I still don’t get fat idk why. It’s just more like a thing in my family I guess
Same
100 percent, I'm 6ft 3 at 150, cold is my life. The worst was trying to find pants to fit, and I look decent in men's extra small. I'm a dude.
The last one was the whitest thing I've seen
Same lol
Yes finally some one is like me
So true
For fucks sakes it's my METABOLISM
Im Underweigth.  My hands are sooo cold! Even is summer.  My sister is like: Bruh is summer your hands are soo cold! Her hands are hot everytime.
I'm short but I'm also skinny, and very underweight for my age I'm 19 and I weigh 110, also I'm 5'3 😭 but yah everyone is always telling me that I gotta eat like sorry that I have a high metabolism
Simple get child sized belts it’s what I do
Try being fat till you're in your 40s. Then drop a 100 lbs and learning the fucked up parts of being skinny. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to become a suspenders guy that carries something soft to sit on.
This is all so fucking true
Relatable
I feel you I have the same problem I'm so dam skinny it hurts an I can't gain weight to save my life like WTF
But then when u eat and get fat ppl will criticize you, if ur skinny ppl will still criticize u
Oml my butt is always hurting . It’s hurting now lmao
That last one’s just you that’s not all skinny people
I love you
The dancing at the end made me wanna jump off a bridge lol no hate btw
Samee
You can't sit on my lap.. lay on me .. cuddle super cute lol
THANK YOU!
My parents messed me up quite a bit as a child by making comments like those.
When I sit on the ground it hurts and when I lay too I’m not that skinny but ya
I like the bit about having a new hole to the belt but if your skinny and don't have much of a waist belt only pull your pants down faster
You can dance lol.
Fat people problems are worse
#skinnygang
im sure it must be sooo terrible being the epitome of society's standard
I don't get bruises on my ribs but pelvic bones are so protruding that i can't sleep on just any kind of mattress. One time my friend told me-If my legs where that skinny i would walk on my arms 😹😹😹😹😹😹But i can eat what ever the fck I want and stay skinny
Michael Jackson is skinny and can dance 💃
my least favourite thing growing up was people making it a glamorous thing, for eg. comments like "i wish i could be as skinny as you", "you would probably look so good in ____" or "your waist is so thin that's amazing" and then my mum saying things like "she gets it from her mother haha" and then entering me in competitions meaning more exposure to the public, it all made me so uncomfortable. its sort of an insecurity now.
I was skinny, but then I overcorrected into chubby.
I was skinny everybody was telling me like do u even eat Now I am fat as a blubber seal and now every body complains bout that too THEN WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO TO DIE?!
I could deadlift three of you lmao
Finally, someone understands me
I feel like you are my bf and I in the same person and it's killing me 😂😂😂
Well atleast you have confidence It's good to see you do well, Keep it up 😊
So true
Braided belt 👍
Ayyy what position did you play when you was on the court
"Do you eat"  Yes I eat twice your weight
Your dancing isn’t too bad, I’ve seen worse
my friend is just like that. everyone always says to her that she needs to eat and now she’s very insecure about herself. like, she was telling me that when she’s around other people it makes them feel fat because of how tiny she is
1:1 me
but im fat asf and i got so many problems
A significant truth 😞
I was like that in school still like that I can eat whatever the fuck I want and not gain weight but it was real bad in elementary school my teacher would ask me are you eating enough when you get home tell them yeah mom wouldn’t let leave for school without eating breakfast and wouldn’t let me go to bed without eating dinner
Yep. All true
Any tips on how to put on weight?
The sitting down part is so truee,  all my friends call me "refrigerator" and "flat as*" 😭✋
The a*s pain is the worst.
I don't think the dancing is an effect of being skinny. The rest are truths, poking new holes in belts sucks.
Better than my dance moves
A metabolism like this is a double edged sword.
This is a serious fucking problem no one understands it
I wish I was skinny 😭
I dont think your inability to dance has to do with being skinny
Being big boned my hip and rib bones stick out alot that laying down burns my ribs
So you are saying that only fat people can dance
Ok can’t dance ain’t a skinny thing it’s a white ppl thing
The only reason i ever had to poke holes in my belt is because i lost weight really fast during puberty bc i have an hourglass figure
Yeeep. As someone with the metabolism of a cracked out cheetah myself I relate to all this.
I’m not even lying if somebody called me too skinny i Might fuck around and call you too fat mind your own to unless you want to get butt hurt
Your inability to dance has nothing to do with your lack of fat.
Same as me im 14 6,,0 and it hurts
You move better than me. Dance like no ones watching.
Don't forget about leaning on any wall putting pressure on a shoulder bone or scapula. Finally fixed the belt issue with a grip6 belt which doesn't use holes. Still have to arrange the pants not to fold when I tighten the belt though.  We'll start a dance team and call it 'Trees in the Wind"
Fat people don’t get kidnapped
This is so relatable!!! I’ve been asked “do you eat?” So many time isg it’s so annoying
If you bruise by laying on the floor you have more problems than being skinny
The 'always being cold' one definetly relates to me. I once fell asleep slightly cold while under three layers of blankets on a 30 degree day...    At 3 pm
Bruh she can dance good
Get a belt that doesn't have holes lol. They look so much better plus they work for everyone.
This is true coming from another skinny person
It’s true I can’t dance either and I am skinny as it’s even worse when your short
I got told to stop eating why are you so fat  I was always heavier then everyone else
Whatever body issues you have girl... Trust ...you're fine. Physical discomfort from it is another ball game. But Stop pretending like you ain't or can't be en Fuego🔥  EDIT: So ..you wanna practical way to hold up them trousers—& at the same time make hunnies wanna drop theirs when they see your steez-o?!    Then here's a wardrobe psychology hack from someone who knows your pain, but turned it into Game....  [[SUSPENDERS]].......yip.....you read right ...Suspenders.... Don't underestimate their power to get females staring @ 1 direction... Your direction. And anyone who tries to clown you for rocking them can't pull it off themselves.
As someone with Shaggy levels of metabolism, yes, yes, and 4 more times, yes
My mom had to poke the belt so that my fat body could fit
I was skinny Guess what was my nickname in school . . . . . . . Anorexy
I know this personally.
As a 7 stone teenager I can confirm all of this is 100% true
And here i am 6ft 2 with a weight of 121 lbs. Why everyone keep telling me i'm lucky to have the "always eat never get fat" metabolism. I'm not lucky. Being lucky is always keep the perfect weight *regardless of what you do*
After Halloween or getting lots of treats I end up finishing them quick and nothing changes. *BRUH*
I have all of these problems (including the inability to dance) plus I am also very small so I get extra comments for that and everybody thinks I'm an annoying 15yo who's trying to lie about his age🥲👍
Say girl - think about washing that filthy mouth out with carbolic acid. NOBODY Wants to hear THAT many 'f' bombs in a row (& large people who have lost weight have most of those same problems to - except it's their BOOBS that hurt when they lie on their stomach too long!)
I was skinny too
Being big doesn't change the ability to dance
She can dance tho
'I cant dance' Proceeds to dance in a way that its worthy of an award (I'm not sure if that made any sense but you get the idea) P. S. I may not be that tall or old, but as an almost 5 foot seven 14 year old all of these are true. Except for the fact that I'm European so people were telling me to eat a few McDonald's.
and then there is me having a mental breakdown cause i am fat
Sooo...the dancing....not a skinny girl problem Sugar.... 😳
Finally our pain is being shared. I can stand the heat but as soon as I enter a slightly cold room I just shout down.
Ok that last ones just you…. I weigh 96 pounds at the age of 17 and I’m 6’2 which isn’t to good
Agree
No offence but when you started dancing I was laughing my head off 🤣🤣🤣
I know this pain too well
how she gonna lie saying she can't dance and then does that
That is me😁
I know the pain and annoyance of being too skinny or not really being able to put weight on easily. I'm a 29yr 5ft8 130lbs guy, and I've always struggled with putting weight on
The belt part hit me deep... Fuck. Good thing is I kept the same belt for years :')
Dont worry, i have all the same problems
I have to poke new holes in to my watch too
U can improve your dancing if given time. YOURS ISN'T HALF-BAD!!!!
I’ve literally been overweight/curvy my whole life and went through people bullying/commenting on my weight (including family) and over the past 3 years I lost basically all my weight by stop eating as soon as I feel full and now everyone comments on my thin body either that I’m to thin or they wish they were built like me and it fucking irritates me so much because I don’t want to worry about my weight which they make me do.
Everything is true
That's so freakin# true !!!! LITERALLY I'm 6"4 ft tall but only 16 yr old yet And im skinny as fuck and everyone judges me so much ?!
I relate to those problems, I didn't even realise it's was because I'm so fucking skinny (44 kg for 161 cm/ I don't know how many pounds for 5'3" in height, and that at 15 but it's the same since I was around 13 i think)
I can se most of the bones on my hands, feet and around my abdomen
Being fat is worse
Personally. I  think your great and helpful. Your energy is pretty awesome. I'm skinny and stay cold!! Dancing, it doesn't matter if your Usher or whoever as long as your enjoying yourself and letting your body go to your rhythm.  Peolpe are 10 feet tall when leaving comments and I get it.. Most important thing with your videos is your making people think and thats all anyone can ask for. Thinking creates dialog and people interact. It's a beautiful thing. I pray you always do you because it's inspiring. Cheers
I my weight is 21 hahahahahahahhehe
Huh. It's kinda similar to fat a persons problems
Bro my friends always say i'm so fat look at my belly and then i say yall arent fat omg stop saying that en then they start saying like you cant talk you really skinny like look at you
Wait, you are a girl?
Lol my bestie always be complaining to me about bruised ribs
I can 100% relate
All so true. Once I got sick at school and had to puke, my teacher came to me after class to ask me if I was bulimic. This has happened more than once. I'm not even that skinny. Wtf
True
“The belt won’t fit? New holes in your belt” never thought I’d see this somewhere else XD I can relate to all of these but the belt one always stood out to me the most
I'm not exactly skinny, but I always wondered why my bum hurts if I sit for too long and the seat doesn't have a cushion
As somone who is skinny as hell and has been since I was born. I’ve always been underweight and I understand this so much-
Im really skinny but I can't be normal for once I keep eating but I only eat the amount I can because if I eat too much I throw up 😃
Same struggles 🤣
Lmao
SAME!!!!!!!!! 😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😭😭😭😭
You dance fine!
I don't know, those were some pretty spicy dance moves 😎
Seeing a skinny white guy dance is a clown Seeing a fat white guy dance is legendary and would make anybodys day And chances are the guy would be laughing alongside you
That true but people keep say wow your so skinny and I think that nice but I eat so much and never go the perfect weight and it's hard
At about 7 (1st grade) I always got comments like that. And now people are bruised (I hit them )
My only saving graces are, am a thermonuclear reactor, no need for insulation just out produce heat, and i have retard strength
The best dancers in the world are literally skinny af...
I FUCKING FEEL THIS ONE  I am unholy skinny and no matter what I do I need sweats to keep warm enough and because it's the only thing I can fucking wear without it slipping, I am 6ft and I can't run at all my nee cap is cracked and didn't heal right so now I got a permanent problem that I can't fix because there afraid if they try I will break to many more bones, and I just don't STOP GROWING everyday is pain so pain meds to help my nees eeeee
No but I would love to be able to dance like that on parties the people would love me
I have a quick question     Do u have a celebrity crush 😩
An just hitting anything just hurts like shit even if it’s just walking into a door with ur shoulder
The eat more thing is something I said to a Friend once or twice. Like the dude Was only 15 but 6.5ft... but he weighs less than someone healthy who is only 5.10ft. Turns out that after I told him he asked his Parents why exactly he is so skinny.... welp the dude has a fking Illness? Problem? Something? That doesn't let him gain weight like a normal person
Id say those are funky moves
This made me cry cuz iv struggled growing up  with everything she explained  People just dont take time to ask before they talk.
im 14 and i weigh less than 40 kilograms so i know exactly what youre talking about
Omg. I can relate so much. Im also a cross country runner and I do track, plus I play competitive soccer to I’m almost constantly runner. I’ve never been a like a heathy weight. I’ve done significantly better I saying on the and weight level this year. But someone told me once “Oh your a runner and soccer player? You can’t possibly be a runner and soccer player at your weight. Go eat more and many you’ll be 100 pounds when your 20” that comment disgusted me. But I’ve always been skinny and I can’t help it. I use to do ballet and leotards that we wore just showed my ribs and everyone looked at my ribs. Honestly I’ve gotten use to being skinny and I do get a lot of comments about looking like a model cause of how skinny I am and the muscles in my legs, I guess it’s a good thing lol. But seriously this video just shows what skinny people deal with.
XD same bro XD
Races
Thank you!!! I have high metabolism and can't gain weight easily, currently I'm 20kgs underweight.. not fun
I have the same problems
Jayus, you're an ectomorph. That's your body type. It helps a lot to know this
I can dance but I can relate to everything else. However one of the things that pissed me off was when I bought chokers and they didn’t fit my neck right because it was too small after spending money on one.
The dancing part might not be skinnyness based. Kinda hard to dance and be tall
Can relate to most of that actually
Bestie ur not the only one <3
But cute asf and short
Ahah fast metabolism thats my issue
cant relate. im 15, 6ft, and over 160lbs
Slight tw here: Bro people would always say that im so skinny, so i ate, but no matter how much I ate I wouldn’t get any less skinny, so people would then say I eat like a cow and crap like that, and then I stopped eating, I now only eat around people because I feel pressured to. Thanks society.
Hurts when you sit, not getting fitting clothes and feel very cold, I can relate to these soo much!!
I’m so fucking skinny: I’m always fucking cold ppl always get belts for me so I have a pile of brand new fucking belts it took an hour to poke one hole in the wrong spot if you sit or lay down to long gives you bruises ppl always say go eat and I say I’m literally always eating cause I am and I quit dance when u was 2 cause I sucked
My 12 year old friend has more killograms/pounds than you 😭😭
And don’t forget that people will constantly put their fingers around your wrist and compare it to their own and then they’ll be like “eewww you’re so skinny” like bruh-  And people will constantly assume you have an ED. Wearing short sleeved shirts is a pain cus you know people will make comments about how skinny you are (even random people on the street wtf)
I'm not even that skinny but the sitting down one is so true, my ass is hurt
I hate when people tell me „do you even eat? You have such stick arms“
I eat like 3-4 k calories a day and drink a lot I'm 14 and i have 37 kg
Relatable but u r cute
As confirmed by a skinny person, this is true.
Relatable because I’m skinny too
ive been hearing this for 16 years "oh my gosh i can make a circle around ur wrist with my fingers!"
She still thinks she’s a guy
I used to be soo skinny as a kid and now I'm 20 kg overweight, so I kinda relate to both sides. I remember when it used to hurt if I lie on my stomach but now my belly is like a pillow and I ain't complaining
Wait why is this true even though I’m not that skinny-  Or maybe I am I-  Dndhajdsysksbd
Im sooo jelly like you're dance moves is just 🥳🤩
As someone who is also fairly skinny, I can relate to most of these Except the lying down part, for some reason all my fat decided to turn my boobs into two big round things that make it impossible to lie down on your stomach
I think not dancing might be a you problem, I'm skinny as all hell and I got 3rd place in local dance competition.
The whole fat acceptance movement is so triggered right now 😂
Lol
It is better to be skinny but fat af like me
Omg same
I would love to dance with you!
I do get cold easily and your write I have almost all these problems
Same, have 42 kg in 15 years
Go to the gym
Ikr
True.true...
Lmao same
As a skinny af person, I agree.
Im so skinny but but the people make me fell like im doing something wrong and they bullied me but know who wil bully me they would get some punchs
Wait. Skinny people really get cold fast? Coz I have seen skinny girls that wears short shorts in winter times.
That sitting thing is really bad I'm a student so 8 hours of school then 6 hours in library. After that i cant even walk
This is so true all of it but the one that I hate out of all of these is what people say because all my life I've heard people taking about me behind my back seeing things like "look at that girl. She looks like a twig. Her parents must not feed her." I was like 7 at the time
Eeee I relate too much I eat a fucking lot but I'm still skinny asf
This is 120% accurate!!!my ass bones hurt whenever I sit, I cannot dance, I get cold too easily,pants yeah even those r a prob, whenever I sit cross legged on the floor my ankles hurt....
Hmm I'm glad I'm not skinny now lol
Can relate I was 35 kgs when I was 12
That dance.... was beautiful....
Those dance moves were pretty fire tbh
All the time my belts has extra holes which i made
Wearing Watch and belt are my main problem
I agree lying down hurts ✨alot✨
Fr
Wait till your 40 n you get screwed alot....fact.
Im skinny too ayy
Why are you always standing on tables and stuff
Imfqt asf and get those things 2
The biggest problem is number 5. Whenever I told my primary school teachers about people skinny shaming me, they brushed it off. When students reported others being fat shamed, the teachers took their complaints seriously, and spoke with the bullies’ parents.
Thos are good dance moves what are you talking abt
Not to be rude or anything you just don't know how to dance sorry I am sorry If I was a little rude
God she is so CRINGE!  especially when she swears....
Agree with all of these. Love your videos.
I’ve been losing weight and my cold tolerance went down and I forgot that the more fat on ur body u have the hotter u gonna b. And since I’m losing that I now remember why I’m getting colder faster 🥲Bc I’m not used to being skinny lol
Nice dancing 💃
Doubt dancing is a skinny person problem, most people can't...
Still cute
My family used to call me “seagull snacks” because I was so skinny they thought I would get taken away by seagulls I didn’t think about it at the time but that’s a really toxic thing to do.
in my school the weight charts are skinny=Mascular god normal=just normal chonky= you already know
Can't begin tell the pain caused due to the people's comments "do you eat?"
Legit me
So true
I can tell im 16 like 1,60 and weight 43 kg and the comments are literlly everytime everywhere the same
As someone who looks like starving kids give hamburgers to me, I can relate to all of these
I feal that
Who the heck said she can't dance?
Yup i have those problems 😭😭
Bro my mom dealt with that
You dance better than me (but when I’m doing Ukrainian cultural dance I’m gonna probably be better)
Omg that's exactly how I dance too lol
Them dancing skills where perfection 👌
Wow that’s exactly how my sister dances
yes all are true i eat super much highly gain 5 kilo a year i have been recently goin to the gym to build muscle so i wipl gain wait and look more healthy
I can relate I can really relate
I forgot I used to poke new holes in a lot of belts 😂 now I'm just looking for some S - XS size of belts or whatever is shorter
The belt. So true
Do you know any shortcuts for becoming thin or normal because I'm 50 kg maybe but in 11 years also please if it's about eating try to tell veg @onlyjayus
My mom used to sew like a specific elastic band/ribbon in my pants so the can fit me😭😭😭
So true!
No wonder I can't dance cause I'm too skinny
Yeah I'm very fin to
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS💀✋
I was skinny to and every thing in this video is true
does being skinny also make you be racist or is that just your adhd
Okay... So uhm..... I'm also really frickin skinny.... And I weight rn abt 28.9 kilos? And I have been 30.1 kilos 2 frckin times in *MY WHOLE LIFE* why? I- I'm a eater and In school I don't eat a lot(becuz I live in Finland and I'm half Finnish and half philipino and I like philipino food more but my school doesn't have a lot of phi- U get it,I ain't gonna write a super long comment o.o) but in home I eat.... A lil I guess....
I understand you I'm skinny asf too
You look more fat then thin but i have not seen ur vids seen 2018 or 2019 idk
I ssooooooo get youuu and not a lot of people talk about it .
This is so relatable . Its like this each and everyday
so trueee I'm skinny rn and I can RELATE
The dancing was spot on very nice !
So relatable
10/10 dancing skills.
Had most of those problems but atleast wasn't sticky
Fat people have Siret problems
I've the same issues
I can relate
Bruh the dance is better than mine
I used to be obese but have since lost a lot of weight to the point where everyone thinks I'm skinny. Basically everything you pointed out is true, especially the sitting down part, and the lack of insulation. I used to find that I was always comfortable sitting down but now when I sit down I am basically just sitting on bones, and I am cold pretty much all the time now as well.
.......am I skinny.......
As a skinny person, it's 100% true
Still better than getting fat.
You are very right 😁
People were talking about BMI, got to me and just started making jokes about me being a two or less. At 17.2 I was literally less than half of the third lowest score.     I had to stop them from always coming to me for things that fall behind stuff.    Almost need tailored pants. Can’t find 28-32, go to fairs and shows for custom leather belts and most shirts that fit shoulders balloon when tucked in.    At 40, still eat over 3000 calories a day and only gain if I eat four full meals a day. When I get into an activity like cycling or paddling for extended times will drive up the fuel needs too.    Heaviest I ever got has been 142 back when I was 18.  5’9” by then and was in middle of growth spurt. Topped out at 5’11. Out of high school, no working out, no soccer, hiking or other activities. Had just finished a summer of Y2K desk work. Literally, would eat 5 times a day and sat around an office for hours on end refitting computers. Coworker always wanted to hit the cafeteria and have a snack. Filled the wait time on program loading and restarting.    Started college and the activity increased, food decreased (was still eating like a large pizza from papa johns by myself though and was in culinary school tasting all the time during labs) and was back to 130 before Christmas. My freshman 15 was negative.
I eat more than the average human and it just results in insomnia. No weight gain.  But yayyyyyy I don't get fat...  :(
U can dance but other dances like bachata or salsa
never been more happy to be fat!
Oh wow, I do some of the same dance moves
Iam fat and I can do these and my mom gets so cold but Iam not cold at all I like the cold but society is always gonna judge me either way :) and I just wear my mom's clothes and they will fit me even when iam older and I like big clothes
(laughs in fat)
I am way too skinny and it’s seemingly genetic as no-matter what I do I haven’t gained weight
I think the can't dance part comes with being white
I feel it . All of it. Finally someone I have similarity to. No matter what diet I m on how much I eat I never get fat. Shit body of mine
Yep I have all of those symptoms!
I know all these. I’m still dealing with my problems
Damn, I relate. Mostly on the clothes thing, but that's cause I'm fat and it's hard to find bigger clothing. And the exact opposite food-wise
1 to 4 are SOOOO realtable!!!
These are relatable. But the comments are easily ignorable. And the coldness is... too relatable... the best benefit probably is immunity to being called fat. You can just show your arm or something.
Some people are born that way, like they eat a lot but they are still very skinny because they just can't really gain weight 😳
I really felt all of this. I used to get bullied for being too skinny and now I'm bullied for being overweight.
Jayus: I can't dance  Also jayus: breaks out the cleanest moves ever
O mah gad the 5th one is so true😀 and now that i gained a bit of healthy weight people are saying that im getting to fat and i wanna be deadly skinny again😀🔫
i lost weight recently and the first ever thing i noticed was sitting on the floor legit hurts
Burger Burger Burger Burger!
Omg exactly people don't even talk abt this like we're going through some bad shit too and some will be like " you're skinny you have no problems" like bruh
I use a woven belt, so I don't need to poke holes.
Hey those dancing moves are atleast better than mine.
One more thing about being skinny FLAT FLATTTT  flattttttttt 😭😭😭😭😭😭 its saddd
Society part is worst for healthy people like..... you get 5 kgs more than the ideal bmi and you are the fattest person alive
As a skinny guy, I use this video as a bible
Wait same This is so accurate
Can't dance  I'm sorry but after that, I can't imagine you not doing a spooky scary skeleton dance after that.  Darn I just called you skinny again.  I wish I was skinny :(
I’m skinny and none of this happens to me
Same sis
It's even worse when you a guy, I used to be super skinny, now finally a manged to get some decent muscle mass but damn it was hard, but sustaining your weight is much easier, do if you plan on changing, just go for it.
Being skinny is atleast better than being obese ..
Your not the only one I'm so skinny as HECK too
I am 6 ft  and I’m ✨s k i n n y✨ but the hood this is I can make fun of my sis for being older by 5 years yet me being taller 😀
This is so relatable when i was a kid, my mom always tells me to be careful when going out cuz i might get blown off by the wind
When I was a kid I was skinny and wind swep me away
It's better than being fat
okay but bella got the moves
I get called skeleton
Same Jayus, same... As a kid though, the wind thing was kinda real: was Walking back home with an umbrella under a storm, and got lifted up from the strong wind, so yeah, wingardium friggin' leviosa irl (yes, i was lighter than the umbrella breaking point).
Yep I’m about 40 kilos and I experience most of them but I’m not cold like ever for some reason
I hate those fat acceptation people that think being obese is the only weight that is healthy. Body positively isn't just being the size of a planet its every size
People tell me to get some meat on my bones but i eat more than most people i just got high metabolism 💀
Literally what I get everyday
Not gonna lie, every tall person I know are like me, tall af and dam near anorexic
It took me a round a chemo and radiation to start gaining weight. My whole adult life been 155 and 6'1"  now I'm 185  8 months after chemo. .
I’m skinny to and people in school be like“get some meat on your body,you should be happy your skinny” like bitch you made me more mad about my body
Me to
The pretty thing about you is your body so you shouldn’t be ashamed or mad at it
At least its still better than being fat
I cannot telate since i been overweight my whole life.Yes my whole life since i was a child.And yes I eat healty and i do work out my body just never gets thin.I realte to the comments people make since i had to hear a lot of stuff from people and familiy like" you look like your pregnant" or "you dont even need too try that on i can see you got fatter" or "oh did you gain weight again" i also been bullied alot because of it.It sucks its seems like thst no body type is good enough theres always something to complain about isimt there?
I can totally relate
I am a child and is 62 kg
Atlast someone I can relate to !
Can't dance ,her dancing , me wtf
I'm very skinny and I'm not being overdramatic what I say this all of this has happened to me and I have never known why no matter what I am always freezing I'm constantly wearing a hoodie in 90 degree heat because I'm cold sitting down hurts like hell in laying like that makes me feel like I'm about to throw up
Same
YES SKINNY PEOPLE PROBLEMS!!!
I have all those promblems except the dance one coz I’m skinny because I dance abah. Like non stop proper training
Thank you. I have also been very skinny my whole life and i am ten years old and im not over 30 pounds. My cousin that’s four years old weights more than me.
The dancing? Nah bro. Dw about it. That's just a *you* problem
I am skinny af and I love the cold
I got all those problems, but not the 3. Man's not cold
As a fellow skinny person, IT'S A GIGANTIC THING PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT I mean, being overweight is always the "problem" but like skinny people also have problems like pls 😭
I relate alot
Yeah the comments ppl make really offend me
Yeah same
My cheeks do be clappin tho
i think the dancing thing was just you
You but  1 foot on the scale
I am skinny and I live on a high up bed and sometimes then I get out of my bed it feels like my legs are going to shatter I think it's because I have just woken up. There is a thing I have that not many people have it is were I struggle to game wate and some people struggle to loose it.  Soooo am I lucky or not.  Also I were a jacket all the time and my family ses take it of your inside. But I am freesing.    So I know how you feel about being skinny.
"i can make a circle around your arm"
describing my sister too the whole video: *so true*
Walking around with a pickle jar..  I like your style
As a tall skinny guy, yeah this is accurate
I’m a good mix of skinny and a bit muscular so I don’t get comments on “do you??? eat????” It’s more “lol small” cause I’m what, a 5’5 girl and hang out with huge dudes, but I definitely get sitting problems, clothes and belts fall off 👁 and I do horribly in cold weather lmao
Try being fat
Soooo reletable
I had got good dance moves(I think), buumt I am very VERY skinny
I never thought you were skinny, I did think you were a member of hanson
An interesting thing about me. I’m skinny fat. Basically I’m just stupid fucking skinny no matter how much I eat.
How does it feel to live my dream ?
I guess Michael Jackson was hiding his fat in his fat stash or something because he was skinny too.
Skinny people are easy to kidnap
Ah yes. my life
So f*cking true  I am 13 and How hard I try I cant gain waight.Every body calls me dried fish. And its always fat af mother f*cker
It was funny because my friend would be confused as to how I could have kfc every other week and still be skinny
I'm VERY skinny and I could say that, EVERYTHING IS TRUE
"I'm scared ur gonna break in half in the wind" WHAT.
Same my arm bends the other way
Well at least your not overweight
Great, now do fat people problems and then figure which one it worse.
so fucking relatable
I relate to all of these smmm my ribs and robs literally show and when I'm going to the doctors they're just like: TF SHE IS SKINNY UHM EAT?
Iam also so skinny and ppls comments about me always hurt af I also try to cover my hands and arms as much as possible BC Iam very insecure about them.
The cold one is true. My mom's skinny and she always asks for my jacket whenever we went out to eat.
Can't dance either, must be the lack of practice.
Omg the comments I get from people are so insufferable. "Wow, you look like a stick."  "Do you parents even feed you?"  "You look so fragile, I could snap your arm like a tree branch."  "Don't let the wind blow you away haha"   Please, just stfu
As a fellow skinny person, I can confirm these.  Except: for the dancing part... that's not because of being skinny.
You do look good though
You: Can’t dance Me: I’m thick as fudge and I still can’t dance 🤣🤣😭
Ur lucky to be skinny
Cant dance either. 😩✌️
I’m 12 and I’m vegetarian my BMI is average so I dont care
Being skinny and vegetarian. As a kid is even worse.. I feel the pain!!
I feal you ;~;
I get so may mean things about this I'm in 6th grade skinny af short af young af and I get bullied for it I'm still skinny but I started to workout so I have beaten some asses recently and been getting meat on my bones
RELATABLE!!!!!!
Ngl she’s actually a better dancer than me💃
Me too
Except for the bruice and cold part .... That's me 😂
cant relate-
Clothes are either to short or to thick. I'm also skinny.. I'm never cold, always to hot 😂 Same with the comments and dancing tho :(
Story of my life. Went from a size 34in waist to a 28in and the waist is still loose. To make things worst if i try a 26in waist i cant get the pants to fit over my butt. Im a dude and i never thought id have a problem like this but i do.
Relatable man 😂
I’m quite skinny and very tall and people at scl constantly call me a lanky bitch, that’s my nickname ❤️‍🩹
Can vouch for all of this.   I eat, breakfast, 10s, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, supper. All of which are good sized meals and I'm just managing to maintain 12 1/2 stone at 6ft tall    Oh and constantly being called skinny hurts after a while, especially when you're a dude that does a manual labour job.
Jayus: "I've been skinny as f#ck" Me: "I've been fat as f#ck"  Edit: I've just seen the comments. YOU ARE NOT UGLY IF YOU ARE SKINNY OR FAT SOCIETY JUST MAKES IT FEEL LIKE BEING FAT IS BAD.
I understand
She GOT the moves doe
This is too relatable
I'm not even skinny but I could relate to nearly everything lol
You can't dance cause of height. I also have height problem. I'm 6.5 and literally I can't dance front of mirror, slightly I have to bend and fuss dance is cockroach in water
True 🥲
So true im 16 and i weigh 50 kg or 110 lbs
Onlyjayus I have the exact same problem I just can't dance and the belt doesn't fit and all of that stuff ITS THE SAME like it's actually annoying like I WANT TO GET FATTER
I grew up being called a brainless twig :(
Lmao literally me also ur really pretty 😊
Yep,can relate
The thing is opposite for me with the same issues I'm overweight. Laying down and sitting also leaves bruises, I get cold easily but it's also annoying that everyone uses you as a personal heater and sticks their freezing ass hands when you yourself are freezing.  clothes that fit are hard to find and cost a lot and to find clothes that don't look like something my grandma would wear is even harder and more expensive. In general clothes are fucking costly, hell sometimes to find shoes that fit my wide feet it can cost up to 100 dollars for a decent pair that lasts yet again looks like something my grandpa wears. I get told nice dad shoes as if it's supposed to make me feel happy(as a girl it doesn't but I kinda vibe with them now I guess) and being told my whole life everything is caused by being so fat. I have health conditions that are genetically passed down for generations in my family that even the smaller 'healthier' people in my family have. Like doctors literally have told me so much shit and blame it on being over weight but after going to other doctors they've realized hey this isn't due to weight it's a medical problem that's g e n e t i c Also ever since the age of five my family talks shit about my weight tells me to eat less but when I do cause I'm not hungry I'm told I'm picky and I'm also told eat healthy when my sister who is  eats very unhealthy and stuff while I enjoy eating raw veggies and fruits and get told by many adults "wow I've never seen a kid like veggies like that before"I also work out and if I work out like anyone else it takes a long time to lose a lot of weight and being shit talked by family even what you considered you closes friends does fuck you up. Which is why I respect anyone of any weight and I don't say shit cause it's either a medical condition or something they choose or can't control and I shouldn't have say in any of it cause as someone whose affected by the words of people who have said shit it fucks a child up a lot and does cause many issues like eating disorders and a lot of stress and mental issues to be like this perfect image when perfect isn't normal and is when you feel like you are you and are ok and feel beautiful how you look and feel sorry for being so long to anyone who reads this far just haven't had the best day
See im a teen but this is all fuckin true
This is in fact true im skinny
i way more than you and im ten
Wait, Ik this stuff is serious, but...skinny people can't dance?...I, I just thought that skinny people can dance the most, like they are really flexible and also..... Umm...yk I am into kpop and some of the people be skinny af but dance like a dream
I’m skinny as well too I know how it is ;(
Bruh I wanna cut my body to look like yours though
I can relate I'm also thinking as fuck
I dont think the dance problems Come from the fact that you Are skinny😁
Agreed
Society - When u are like wider they say “your fat” when your too skinny they say “go eat something”. Like please stop saying this let us live 😂
I'm 6'2", 200 lbs, definitely not thin.   I overheat faster Run slower And I still have a baby face
I can relate so much…. Also when I’m with my friends at least one person will bring up weight and when it comes to me I’m like “oH No YoU dOnT”
Relatable
Omg that dancing 🤣 You made my day
I am skinny and I can relate the thing that hurts is when people laugh and say “oh no don’t go outside you’ll be blowed by the wind” it used to be hard it still hurts but now I don’t as bad as I used to 😐😭
Same
rhythm or coordination are not necessarily skinny problems
Me being skinny: yep yep yep
That dance tho 😍
Yep I am 10 and very skinny idk why but everyone comments are not helping
This is so true-
Lol i used to be so fat now im skinny and the chair always hits my bone like in the top of the ass like that is just so painful
For by grace you have been saved throught faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of God so that no one may boast ephesians 2 verse 8-9 🥰......
Pls dont use God,s name in vain
I have that same fucking problem and one day my neighbor ask my mom do I eat because I'm so skinny but in reality I eat more than my dad who's weights over 100kg 😂
I just bypass belts entirely by running a shoelace through the inside of my pants.
_as a skinny guy I can approve this_
I feel ypu
Your dance moves are fire
Telling a skinny person to "go eat a burger" when their comfortable and healthy in their body is like saying "go eat a salad" to a fat person who is also comfortable in their body.
No no remove the dance there You actually can dance! I can dance and im skinny And bro you just did good moves there Lmao
Omg pants never fit 😫 they either fit at the waist but are like an inch above my ankles or they are long enough and they fall down!
At least your tall ash 😂
Him I don’t think being skinny is why you can’t dance you’re just a very bad dancer no offense
It's okay I used to be super underweight too like unhealthy very unhealthy underweight 😔😞
I'm 17 and I weight around 45 kilograms
Confidence to dance recording-
uhh, you're fat? is that what you want to hear
Nice moves
Yeah short people problems I can agree I can do with the heat by wearing a winter coat in the mid hottest part of summer and it can feel like any normal day but when it gets cold out I got to be fully covered or also freeze to death
i litterally had the oppisite of this people told me to lose weight that much i actually said you know what i am happy with how i am and thats all that really matters is what you think of yourself
Fat people watching this 😐
I can confirm as I used to be so skinny you could see my ribs but now I'm fat as fuck and sleeping on my stomach is the way to go instead of on my back (also no we don't need big blankets only the sheets and a light blanket at most)
I never heard that i am beautiful from someone that I dont know like I am tall skinny I also have a s*it of nose and legs like stiks.HOW I AM SUPOSED TO BE BEAUTIFUL WHEN I AM LIKE THIS.(sorry for my bad eanglish)
Some pretty hot dance moves to me 😂
I am super skinny too and my family tell me to eat more meat but I don't like meat and they said that I am picky
Understandable have a nice day or night wherever you live
fucking loud as shit
I am skinny as hell I am so cold right now
No white person can dance don't worry
Almost every single person at my wedding said I looked too skinny and needed to eat more food. Like the day where I'm supposed to feel my most beautiful and get told I don't look healthy. thanks family and friends...
I know how is this like. i hate when someone says: why are you so skinny?! Me: do you think that I want to be like this??!! And the worst part is that my mother forces me to go at dance lessons :(:
I ended up getting tested because of being cold so easily, sleepy all the time, little to no energy. Turns out I have hypothyroidism 🙃
Better dance moves than me 💃💃
Exactly, literally according to the NHS I should be dead because of how skinny I am lol fml
The part where she explains why it’s messed up to tell a child if they’re skinny and that they need to get fatter and what not I get told that every single day and then one day my class had a field trip to the pool everyone started calling me fat this society is messed up
No one talking about how perfectly she is sit-standing on the sink
The thing is, if I do eat and try to fatten up, I get bloated instead 👁️👄👁️
Same im skinny
I'd kill to have that kind of body.
Wonder why skinny ppl date fluffy people ?  Yea , I found out .
Omg same
Same here and I fell so saddd
Don't forget that sitting on a bench hurts your spine
I AM FUCKING CONFUSED, I AM STILL VATCHING YOUR VIDEOS AND I FUCKING DON'T KNOW ARE YOU A MALE OR A FAMEL?!💘💋
Well feel bad for you
Agree! I was always on healthy weight but this year I went to bmi 18 because I was sick... And the chair part relate the most because I can't sit on college desk for too long without hurting my ass
thats some badsass moves, use them, it'll fkn work, sorry if this doesn't make sense, im completely obliterated rn 🤫🤧🤧🙌
Fun Fact: Thats How I Dance
As a skinny person can confirm
Despite me being a short chubby chick, why do I still find this relatable?
Okay.. i finally got the answer in why i cant dance-
I kept being called petite and hated it
I feel that pain
I am skinny but I have been eating a lot of calories how the hell am I still skinny and I have been eating meat for most of my life
Jayus: I CANT DANCE! Also jayus: (Dances better then me) Me: lies I have been told lies
Same for all of these. I'm 6'2" and 130 and done growing so uh, yeah.
She can dance
So true tho
Jayus:I CAN'T DANCE Also jayus:does the most graceful dance ever
Wait im overly skinny?!? What
My fat ass pushes my pants off and I can't punch and holes in my belt and I'm not about to go get a new one
Who asked
No more dancing
(laughs in fat)
YES IVE BEEN SKINNY IN MY HOLE FUCKING LIFE TO AND THIS IS RIGHT AND SO FUCKING RALETABLE
she is right I now that because i’m skinny like really skinny i’m 10 years old and i’m 24 kilograms
suspenders
*EXACTLY*
One of my friends straight up called me a shirt Hanger  cuz there nothing my shirt shows out but my shoulders
I can't lie down on the side on a hard surface without bruising my hips.  Finding clothes that fit is difficult. Especially trousers are often only available in too wide or too short. Shirts that actually fit have become a bit easier to find, but only if I'm not looking for particular colours.
Ik you probably won't see this but this is why I love belts like grip6 belts... No holes, always fits and it's super simple for anyone. Love the belt as Ik it will work with any weight, build, and pants 👌 10/10 would recommend
I'm very skinny That is right we do get cold fast as f*** #5 it's very true I'm still very young I'm still technically a child I've get this comment a lot it's really f***** up to say that kid. #1&2 are so true it does really hurt sitting down & laying down like that
My weight is 85 kilos and I have all these problem
That’s why I get cold easily 😭😂
I’ve fallen into this spot where I’m incredibly skinny and I can barely eat, and since I’m still having growth spurts it becomes even worse
So relatable 😭 I CAN'T DANCE EITHER, I look like slenderman trying to socialize. Hahaha
You are adorable accept it....
This is so relatable
IMA STIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK AND ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL OF THESE REEEEEEEESOOOOOOOOONS MAAAAAAAAAKE SEEEEEEENSE :3
Uhm- my friend is skinny as HECK and she is on the competitive dance team...   That might be a personal problem-   (This is all jokes btw)
Finally someone understands
This is so true XD
Okay, but I like ur dance steps 😂...
everything you mentioned is so damn true 😫😂
That's very true, I even eat noramally but I'm still skinny! :(
Jayus is the most confident girl I have ever seen in my  Just liking what she has
Random but, in my country they make fun of fat ppl. No matter how skinny you are they won't make fun of you. That's only ONE of the reasons I hate being fat
I'm 61 years old and I'm still getting the comments about being too skinny! Give me a break!
My grandma would say that I looked like mal-nourished Ethiopian kids
Lucky you
i thought i was the only one who had to poke new holes in watches and belts
BRUH what you mean you can’t dance? you dance WAY better than me-
Lol that last one… hit me different
I feel this so much I'm 15 and I'm only 75.38 pounds
Omg I relate so much 😩😭😭 I am built like a f😇ckin  stick I swear-
Yeah.. so.. I have the same problem- and it sucks. Your not alone 😂
Hey, that's me!  Wait I'm not skinny
Bro my mom And fake  friends  say all those mean comments to me ;-;
Being skinny does not effect your dancing.
I literally eat like a pig everyday trying to gain weight. I have gained 9 pounds! *In 7 years*
I HATE all of these problems (I’m extremely skinny)
Yup i can confirm the getting cold so fast part xd
🥵🥵🥵
My arms are as thin as a twig and im 9 and i relate  so much
Absolute same and I agree with every statement except the cold. I love the cold.
Jayus:skinny people cant dance   Lisa:***am i a joke to you***
Tbh i just did diet and got skinny  Now sitting is my worse enemy
Meanwhile my skinny problem: "jeez i ate 7 family combo meal but have gained a millimeter of weight"
But being skinny is the best. You just have a condition on your body or whatever. Healthy people who are skinny is what is called good. Being fat is not
So true
So fukin true bruh
the first and last one hit hard
RELATABLE AS HELL
Who is this why you can't dance is because you just don't got the moves 😂🤣 sorry 😂🤣🤣🤣
It’ll do that
I got a bit fat i mean healthy i think and i wanna go back to being skinny
I weight 87 pounds at 5,9
relate to this on a spiritual level. shit sucks. i’m 6’2 and weigh 140.
I can relate, to all of that. I'm skinny (like, unhealthy skinny) and people always say shit like "you should eat something, you're so skinny", yeah, i know, thanks for printing it out 🙄, or "oh, i wish I was that skinny", no, you don't, trust me, it's not that good, I'm aways cold, pants are aways falling, belts? Big nono cause they don't fit, even bras don't fit me well, it sucks.
I can relate to everything in this vid 😂
Poor thing :(
That first one is super true, I only sleep on my stomach so idk ab the 2nd one, and I don’t like belts already so- also, I don’t see myself as skinny, but I’ve been told that I’m super skinny TwT
I'm fat and can't dance
"You need some meat on your bones" is the one that has been said to me the most...
Jayus: I can’t dance!!!!! Me: Liar
Especially when laying on your back😩😩😩
This is complete facts
Damnnnn.... Fuck you how dat problem I'm fat and young
You are lucky girl
It is messed up saying comments like that because skinnier people have a WAY faster metabolism. You could eat like, 10 burgers and itll do nothing
I would say first world problems but I bet the kids in Africa can relate to not being at a healthy weight
I am so tried of ppl judging me for being so skinny or being like can I just be you personal I hate when ppl say that because then it makes me fill like the center of attention or like why would they want to be me. Or sometimes ppl will call me weak based off of how I look I can’t actual lift ppl I can do it by myself. I hate eating because then it gets way worse with ppl their like eat for I stuff it down your throat cause you need to gain some weight. I seriously hate it because it is torched to me. I hate sitting because I have 0% of an ass and it hurts to sit down cause you are so skinny and all you feel it your bones. Or like ppl are like you are never going to be thick like me. I hate it. I am the girl that where baggy shirt and basic skinny jeans everyday Bc something’s look weird on my and I get made fun of it is not funny either it is sad and can drive ppl to a point in like life toware you are just like why am I so skinny and you become insecure
Fat ass people like me have the same problems but oposite
What onlyjayus is a girl !!!!!!
True tho
Wachu mean you can’t dance?!?! You stole the show!!!
Isabell I'm skinnier then you ik these problems
Saaaaaaaaaaaaasme
Im skinny and i abuse this by eating many food
I don’t think the dance problem is from being too skinny! I just don’t think you know how to dance…😵‍💫
That’s why I can really endure the cold, it’s because I’m pretty chubby
Go eat a burger vs eat less fatty, which one is worse you decide
I'll definitely invite Jayus in a party 😆
I'm 22 years old and my metabolism is so fast that I have eaten 3 to 4 boxes of pizza and felt nothing
As kid I fuckin hate  society
SKINNY AS FUCK!!! same bro
Literally skinny people are suppose to be better at dancing because your body is lighter and you can move it faster and more flexible (not saying if you aren’t super skinny you can’t dance I’m just saying it’s easier with control)
"Can't dance"  Yo thats everyones problem
I am also so FVCKING  skinny and its the worst thing ever!!! And the worst part is, i cant take on any wieght!! So this is super relateable
Because I'm skinny. This is basically f****** true
9 out of 10 what you said in this video is true but there's some skinny girls that can dance and I know that for a fact:-)
I wish I was skinny like you…  I can’t stand the fact that I’m not and I always try to hide it
For real being skinny is a gift and a curse like i enjoy being able to have a great metabolism but sometimes id like to have a wall of fat protecting my ribs so i don’t have to worry about breaking one while coughing
"U get very cold easily" Me whos room is like an artic and im wearing shorts clothes : what wdym??
GIRL I FEEL YOU
Haha same but I’m a skinny guy .
The warm thing dosnt apply to me cause I’m always warm for some odd reason
You just need to practice the right moves then....boom...Dancing machine
I think u just trying to hard to dance just chill and vibe wit it 👍🏾😂
Omg I thought I was the only one who has these problems but Jayus also has them
I can eat a burger and full pizza and a full cake amd still be skinny and i cant gain weight
I can relate to all of these
I got skinny after my appendix
You look like girl and a boy also
You girl or boy???
Honestly people should just stop commenting on a kid’s weight. Just. Don’t.
Im 6'2 and weight 120lbs I feel all of this. This is extremely true and its the main reason i wear hoodies. Everywhere. Warmtha nd nobody knwos im built like a dead tree's limb
She's the best DANCER
I hate being skinny it’s horrible and so hard for me to gain weight I’m made fun of for how I dress to it’s so sad but least I know I’m not alone    Edit: whenever people ask if I eat I just say no I want to starve
Me when my uncle says you need to eat more your so skinny: ahh yes watch me eat these 5 big ASS pizzas 👍
All of the above....      ..... The DANCING THO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Thats about accurate especially if your still obsessed with it either way....
This is so damn relatable lmao
Fr I’m just like you in this situation :,)
Same lmao
You're mean 😖😖😖 cause im skinny and these are all problems
I've been fucken fat my hole life I'm still the fattest man on earth
I was skinny, didn't get bruises easy, didn't get cold easy. But im from the north, so i might just be build diffrent
I went from a skinny kid to a fat preteen and now I'm short angry and well normal size
✨Relatble ✨
Why is this so relatable
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣and look at the and🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im skinny and tall
I have the same problem
As for me I am skinny but I can dance I am not cold easily
Now I feel a little lucky that am fat
This is so true!!
I wore a skirt for Halloween. 2 days before It was fine on me. It fit, everything was fine. But two days AFTER.. it was too big. Like HOW-
I can relate to this totally and I’m 53.
😂
RELATABLE
I’m also a skinny person
You dance perfectly fine to me, plus i’m a little overweight and i wear shorts and a t-shirt int he winter so ig you’re right about the insulation bit
Agree
I could relate and it's very sad🥲
Jayus: i cant danceeee  **Their dance moves being hella better than mine**   Me: I- Ok-💀
Its ok jayus i feel you
I feel this
Use code cobble is there name
To be fair the belt with new holes thing is a big guy thing too when your fat but not so much that they make your size
Omg literally same
As long as your health is not in danger. Most would consider it a blessing, esp of you can eat whatever you want and not gain weight. That is like a super power, but just wait until you get older and you metabolism slows down!!!
Well on the bright side most people can't dance soo . I wouldn't worry about that one tbh . And about the being cold well try living in Ireland 🇮🇪 or in the Scandinavian countries in Northern Europe.
Wait Jayus ur not a Guy?!? I always thought that u were a guy
Fat people problems :  FUCKING PARENTS SCHOOL JUDGMENTALS  🏃‍♂️INSECURITYS  …what did you think I was serious..? Skinny people go through this too don’t think it’s just you because how you look.
60 POUNDS??? jaysus
This is relatable 😭😭😭
She do be dominating that dance floor doe.....
Plz no more dancing lol
You are the best dancer I ever did see -w-
THIS IS SO FUCKING ACCURATE
The dancing part lol
I relate to the arse pain and the jeans
Yep. My entire life I just heard endless negative comments about being skinny. Can't do a thing about it. Yay. 🤦
As a skinny person who can't gain weight. I can concur
I agree with everything except for the feeling cold bit, idk what's it about
Bro I'm overwait and in Australia and always fucking cold still WHAT THE FUCK
I'm fat as hell and they can dance better than me wtf they talking bout
No wonder it looked like you had a boy body
Same here
I’m skinny but the only thing I can relate to is the dancing part
I have the exact opposite I try to lose weight and somehow gain more it’s really depressing :(
That dance was epic! I don’t know what you’re talking about???🤷🏻‍♂️
All of this is literally me mainly the part where people think you dont eat and the think your starving yourself to look good mind you I was 12 when i started getting body shamed and skinny people get called weak like wtf
Correction: you absolutely CAN dance
This is....                      *actually relatable*
I still think I'd rather have to deal with skinny problems rather than what I have now.
I am skinny since childhood and i eat like a freaking dog and still didn't gained a bloody weight AND I CAN'T FREAKING DANCE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I dont think you can blame your dancing on being skinny.
Lol this is me right now
As a skinny person: I freaking hate those comments
I weight 30 kilograms
I used to be skinny like very now I’m fat
Aw, this was so relatable. Especially the part about people's comments. Everyone always talks about how bad you get treated being overweight (which is completely true and a good thing to talk about) but I feel like everyone just assumes that the skinnier you are, the better, and you aren't ever supposed to complain about it or talk about the negatives. A lot of the time, I do wish I weighed more even though I'm healthy weight for my body type and eat plenty. Anyway, sorry for the long comment, I was just venting.
True im skinny 😈
Ok this dance was cute haha When i was a really young kid i was very skinny... Like the wind would carry me lol. Than i got a kind of allergic reaction and needed to take a medice for a year. This medicine made me get cuteness kid fat, when i stopped to take it i lost some weight. Now im a almost chubby short teenager
The butt bones feel so much pain…
oh so that's why my hands our always cold
"I was skinny as f***"  I wish I was too
You just said everything that I am
Yo this vid straight facts 🤣
Assuming you eat marginally healthy, being skinny would help you live longer then everyone else.
Wtf do you mean you can't dance  That shit was sick
I love the dance moves
Me to
I have a sister who weighs I kid you not 98lb wet and she's ALWAYS cold when I'm sitting over here 195lb burning the hell up
Did the scale say freaking 66 POUNDS????????????????? Wtf
Jayus, you're great just the way you are. Just be yourself, I'm always going to encourage you.
I will take dancing lessons with you because I can't dance for my life
Just hit me in the feels. I've been 120 lbs since grade 7.
Damn... I just can’t lay down because of my massive schlong 😔😔
Ah yes because being skinny has to do with dancing.
I don’t think the last one has anything to do with being skinny
True
She wasn’t lying about the whole dancing thing lmaoo
I'm decently thick but I can't dance
3 n 4 are the worst
Hmmm
Same
I relate to all of these. I literally have an eating disorder because I forget to eat due to my adhd and getting way too distracted during the afternoon(my parents both work at night so one is always asleep and the other is at work), and istg my family will be like “omg you need to eat”. YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. I’ve forgotten about literally every meal of the day for so long to the point where I’ve developed an eating disorder. Stop telling me I need to eat because I literally can’t eat more than three bites without wanting to puke. At least I’m not a fattie that can’t seem to lose weight from walking on the treadmill at age 56. Like damn.. you’re not at a healthy weight either so don’t tell me what I need to eat. Edit: I literally haven’t ate at all today. Half a quesadilla is all I’ve ate. From Taco Bell.. like them things are tiny asf.
My mom always says that, and now I've become proper because of my sis, everyone says "eat something, plz! Plz! Just eat!"   Me: you want me to puke or something?!
Did she really just turned on the comments 😂😂
Don't care what people say about me, myself & I 🙃🙂
fat people be like: We are 20 light years ahead   And kgs.....
The belt one….. YESSSSSSSS  ARGHHHHHH
I have all of these and I'm fat. Somethings wrong
Ahhahahaha true
Man my pants fall down even if my belt and my pants... "fit"
I'm skinny but my lil bro is so FAT and like EVERYONE CALL ME BONE GIRL AND EVERYONE CALL MY BRO MEET MAN I'M SO SICK OF EVERYONE CALLING ME AND MY BRO THAT and everything your saying is all true ALL of it
i would still rather be like that then by fat ass. i was born like this and can’t change it. i know it might suck for you but it really really sucks a lot for me.
I’m more skinny then you also I way 69 pounds….
my mom wants me to be skinny 🤨
Ify ffs
Those dance moves are everything 🤣🤣🤣
As a really fucking skinny person, I can confirm this
I hope you gain more in the future (not in an unhealthy way but ye)
Isnt this the dude that said the N-word?
Looking good to me.
Never have I related to something so much. And the worst part is I can eat like 10 big macs, and I’d end up LOSING weight.
That's true lol
I'm 1,85 (6'1") and have been about 50kg (110lbs) for as long as I can remember lol
I've been the same way my whole life and I get made fun of being skinny
SO ACCURATE
No you absolutely can jayus
I can relate
Eat a sandwich
Same
All of my meat just went to my fucking legs so I’ve been super skinny but super tall I’ve just been a pencil
Im very very very skinny people tell me to eat all the time that kinda hurts its kinda insulting and yes all my pants dont fit lol my belts do...... Sometimes...... And i rly cant dance, when it comes to dancing im an embarrassment, im awkward and shy
Are you a girl?
Bro this is so true
You're a better dancer than me
omfg so relateable
Youve racist as fuck too
The dancing is just you
I'm fat and I cant dance for shit🤣
Ok I’m this is so true the 5th one was true as hell but the 6th one…..I’m literally a dancer and I’m the youngest person in my dance team on jazz 3
I think your attractive
👌
I just like you
my mom recently told me that "I'm whittling down to nothing"
People tell me to go eat something when I literally just a a hole pizza and I’m 10
Yaas I'm 13 and ONLY 80 pounds
I can relate sooooo much lol
I have skinny problems
I was a SUPER skinny kid, this is all true, but the main thing I always wanted people to get is: You would never say to a fat kid “you’re so fat, go on a diet” but for some reason it’s okay to say “you’re so skinny, go eat some food” THEY’RE THE SAME THING, making fun of someone’s weight KILLS THEIR SELF ESTEEM
Bro I called bony because I am skinny. Also the cold one is most relatable
hun kindly and respectfully stfu your problems are valid but they aren’t even close in comparison to the things that over weight people go through
As someone who is both short and skinny, I can confirm all of these, except for the cold one because I get used to it very quickly, but I prefer heat
Boohoo
you can’t dance because you’re white, us white people can’t dance
Question for all flat chested women. Why do you still wear a bikini top if you would literally look the same as a man without a shirt on?
Now I know why I cant dance Lol
Yes 😫
She needs to be cancelled
So true!!
Same though XD  I still fit in kids six's XD kinda a tight squeeze  now though
All of that does happen
Relatable.
I've had to deal with being skinny, and tall as hell as well.  It definitely sucks, especially the cold issue. But really glad I'm also finally getting into a better weight range.
Facts i hate being so fucking skinny
Damn I have fast metabolism so I pretty skinny
This is me
As a kid rn i really get skinny shamed alot by my mom. She always makes jokes about me being skinny and flat and names and it kinda hurts my feelings a bit :')
I'm a fricking twig lol and all of these are so true lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legit someone asked me if I was anorexic when I was in middleschool or high school. I was like, "Nooope. Just a high metabolism...."
I 100% relate to all of this
Every one matches me *EsPeCiAlLy ThE lAsT oNe* EEEEEEEEEEEEEE
As a man with a very high metabolism I can 100% say this is facts.
I think that last one is just a personal problem
The fact my friends brother ALWAYS makes fun of how skinny I am  every time I go over to her house
Butifly dancS
I literally had to get a belt cause I didn’t have any and I had to poke holes into it and it fits some days and doesn’t others
I’ve been skinny my entire life as well my entire god damn family is skinny-shaming me to this day... Sigh....
Thats so true omg
I'm skinny but not too skinny, even if i eat too much food i still don't gain weigh
The dancing is just a white girl problem
I relate to these problems on a spiritual level
Poke holes in your belt  So relatable😂😂😂😂
As a woman who is 5'7" and about 105 lbs on a good day. I can relate. I eat constantly (anything I want), I don't technically exercise except for chasing my 2 children around. I've never tried to lose weight.. I'm actually trying to gain weight so I can donate blood.. Yet I've had doctors accuse me of having an eating disorder which is the furthest thing from the truth. I hate the comments of "eat a sandwhich" "omg you must obsess about your weight". I would never make comments about someone's size. You don't know if someone has a medical condition, a mental health issue, etc.. Just don't comment on anyone's size..
The number 3 fact. NO WONDER I GET COLD FUCKING EASILY. LIKE DAMN I THOUGHT I HAD SOME WEIRD CONDITION. This is why i’m always in multiple layes of clothing 🙂
I’m going to be honest… I thought Jayus was a dude
As a former skeletor (alcohol, birth control, other meds and poor life choices made me gain a few lbs), I know this a little too well. As a kid my dad would say "you need to eat a burger, lil cracker" and my stepdad/mom would ask me to sit differently cause my butt bones hurt their legs... I was always called a "late bloomer." And in middle school people questioned if I dieted. And the belt struggle... oh the belt struggle. Only bad part about my weight now is its not where I want it😂 Edit: idk if it was just me but I broke 100lbs finally when I was in high school. I was teeny
😩 THANK GOD ITS NOT JUST ME IM 73 LBS AT 14
Me, who is all of them except for the last one
I’m 16 and I’ve been dealing with underweight issues for over 3 years. And nothing I do fucking works lmfao.
I feel you I have children belts that are way to big
I am 11 and I am 72 pound's sooo it feels like I am in in Antarctica
And you could see my ribs
I can’t dance… no duh your white!
I'm only fourty kilos and I am about 5.8 feet tall
Yeah I fucking felt this.
I feel you
Relatable as fuck ahahahaha lol:)
So true
She,s tall
Oh no you're skinny aw man
Are you a boy or a girl don't wanna be rude but I have been dieing to know
Facts
Spot on
Its fine who care what other's say
Can’t relate to any but number 6
i relate to every fucking goddamn issue here
When u skinny everybody can see in detail how your limbs move
I’m skinny but I have really big thighs and I don’t understand how that happened-
i can relate to this SO MUCH. literally i tried to gain weight and stuff but it never works, and my mom told me i am skinny from my grandfather's bloodline 😃
Why why this is the truth im a kid with skinny problems finnaly someone realizes the pain of a skinny person
True
I have this problem all of them and dancing the most severe one
Yep this is me
I can relate I'm really skinny too don't worry
BRUH I GET IT WEIGHT TRAINING TWAS A STRUGGLE M8
This is the only video I can relate to on here lol
I'm actually really skinny and yes laying on my ribs for too long leave marks and I'm cold literally all the time but everyone is like "Dude do you even eat?" And other stuff...
The last second was legit.. get called skinny or too white.. and it hurts 🥲
I’m tall and skinny but can dance. But all of these other things are true.
i knowwwwwwwwwwww im skinny toooo im 10 btw
I hate when people say they hate something good about themselves as an excuse to bring attention to it without having to brag.   It used to work on some people but now just no. Stop.
Better than being fat
Nobody can dance
Number 6: can’t dance Me: damn I must be skinny af
Eating two spoonfuls of Nutella with every meal is recommended by doctors for weight issue.
HEY NO BAD DANCEING I learned this from my teacher lol I'm in the 5th grade
As a skinny person this is 100% true including the Cant dance part
I’m very skinny and all is eat it’s just a body shape. No one’s perfect ❤️
I'm unfortunately underweight and just want a bit of a chub - everyone calls me "lucky" for my annoyingly fast metabolism
The dances might just be you tho
I’m rlly overweight. Becauseeeee. If I eat ANYTHING I’ll gain like a pound 😭 no matter how much I work out, walk, even eat healthy, nothing works at all. 😃
I'm also TOO SKINNY so I understand each and every one
I can relate to this so much im so skinny-
When you get to your 40’s, you’ll want that skinnyness, you whiner.
I’m exactly the same although I’m a dancer 😂😂😂
Is being 90 pounds and 10 going on 11 yrs old considered being over weight?
Agreed I agree with you I am literally like you
This is so true like It pisses me off so much when people say I have skinny privileges
Hah that's me
😭😭😭 this is truth no one believe in me but this is truth..  😭😭😩😒
I have a phat crush on you lol
I know how it feels to get cold really fast. I have no insulation
I was beginning to think I was the only one lol, jk. It is messed up to tell a kid something like that tho.
This be me and my life!
Thank you for making this video to show that someone like this exist   My grandma and society always telling me that my mom doesn't feed me it's just hurt 🤕
sometimes im actually scared that i will be blown away
I 1000 understand this. But try having an odd number leg length as a guy. My leg length is 31 in, my family constantly goes "are you sure your a 30 and not a  32." B**** I'm a 31 and I'm not going to get every single pair of pants I have for the rest of my life hemmed up or ask my grandma to do it for me when I wear boots all the time.
I don’t think #6 actually has do with being skinny lol just kidding you’re awesome
Same
My grand parents say eat more food all the time when I have already eaten a whole meal plus even more leaving with a stomach ache they say like you are way to skinny you need more meat like the rest of the family. Like dude no I am me you are you I will do what I want right now I’m my life thanks though
Being skinny is a bless  But people don't know how it actually feels  1. You can't participate in mostly sports activities⚽⚾🏀🏐🏈🏉🎾🏑🏏🏒🏓🏸🥊🏋️ 2. You can't find a dress that's the exact size of yours  👚👕👗 especially  Jean's 👖 3. Your butt hurts whenever you sit on a very hard thing 4. No 🥐matter 🥞how 🍖much 🍗you eat 🥓you 🍔 never🍟 gain 🍕weight 🍞🍟🍳🥘🍿🥙🌮🍦🍨  5. And the worst part is when people say that didn't your parents👫 ever feed you ? It makes mi so furious 😡😠
Its not cap
U cant dance because ur tall not skinny
Can confirm
As a fat person, a lot of these problems are fat people problems too.
That last one’s not a skinny person problem that’s a you problem
Is that why I am always so god dam cold
Not being able to dance has nothing to do with being skinny. Jus sayin
PLSS YES
I remember watching your clips when you tried to confuse people about your gender, and I could tell you're definitely a girl, a very attractive girl, tall and skinny, I imagined you might have been or still do runway model for fashion shows for part time work
Omg gurl same I am 10 and I Whey 70 pounds
The dancing part isn’t because your skinny lmfao 🤣!
I am over weight but I every one thinks I am skin I don’t get it
Can relate
Pressure just can’t dance thing is being really tall
Don’t worry not being able to dance ain’t just you or skinny people I can’t fuckin dance either
Amen
Jayus your dance moves are better than most people ever
She's calling me out...
As a fellow skinny person I agree with all these
I am also so skinny my sisters are to
I don't really need to be rude if I am but are you a boy or a girl?
Just yesterday I saw an ad for weight gain pills, that got me thinking
"Where's Jayus?" "..On the dance floor." *Whistle noises*
I have gf but watch you dance was so adorable and endearing that my brain was like "this is why you gay for women/ femmes". Asexual attraction is real man.
Can relate 🤠✌️
Damn, sorry. I have been called fat most of my life and didn't know the struggle...but if any skinnys come at me, thanks for the ammo.
nooooo too relatable
Or when total strangers ask if you’re anorexic because you’re so thin. No Karen, I just have a stupid metabolism
and people say being fat is bad....
Our problems are the same but In different ways
I'm the worst parts of both fat and skinny I can't explain it I don't know how I have a fat back a slightly chubby stomach thick legs thick butt the weird part is I'm a man a straight man a white man I walk too much every day and I only eat either one or two meals every day usually chicken strips french fries some days Pizza but only two or three slices of pizza and I drink three pepsis a day and eat snack cakes and most of my weight is still in my back I don't know why or how I have a flat butt you're smart what should I do with this information I'm telling you
Cool dance moves
Most of the time, I wish I am skinny, than just live my tenacious chubby gut.
As a skinny person, I got these problems ;-;
"i cant dance"  *completely shoots my ego on rainfire and chucks it down the drain*
i soo skinny too
You’re 6’3 but I’d still win on the courts
Fat problems: Body shamed   You eat celery and crap and never get skinny    Your mom says your kinda chubby    S .O .C I. E .T. Y.
You can definitely learn to dance! You’re not stiff at all and as goofy as your dancing was, you had some rhythm too
"I CANT DANCE!" skinny ballerinas: i am 4 parallel universes ahead of you.
I want to be a little bit more skinnier but I don’t wanna be like that skinny
Girls look good skinny too
I'm skinny too
YO THATS LIKE ME
As someone who is 65.9 pounds being a young teen, FACTS! Especially the society one- like.. IM TRYING DAMNIT- AINT MY FAULT MY METABOLISM IS SO DAMN HIGH!
So true tho
I weight 29 kg.  Im 13...
Yes this is just pure facts I am skinny AF to
We should be friends I'm super skinny to
That first one is way to relatable. School was a pain in the ass.
thats a whole mood
Lol thinking your not super hot xD fit girl goals
Its better than being fat like me
Can't dance? Bitch you a queen dancing! 👸
Yasss so relatable
No that’s just because your white just a joke don’t get mad
I’m 126ib and 6’0 at 14 and I know how it feels. I’ve been trying to get to 150IB throughout the years so I can’t actually gain muscle as well
Me: BUT IM FRICKIN CHUBBY, IM UNLIKE YOUUUU😭
I RELATE
Who in the bananas said you can't dance? You absolutely can and you rock it
The end is like that one time my mom came to my school to pick me up for a dentist appointment she forgot about on the day we had a school dance I was traumatized that day
my problems are society, especially my relatives "have you been eating? you're so skinny, that's unhealthy, you should eat more" and i didn't know the reason i get so cold is cuz of me being skinny
Her dance move is better than mine
The clothes not fitting it's also a pain when you're losing weight
I feel you I am the same 😂😂😂😂
100% True
The hate is real I was the size of a grown ass man at the age of 10 you know how weird it is to go trick or treating and you can't even find a kids costume but almost every door you go to people give you the stink eye like your way to old for this
Same, except I'm a guy so instead of bruising my ribs, it leaves Mark's on my knees and arms
Yeah about that last one
Yeah, besides for bruises and cold, that is every large person also
How did you learn the 2nd one?
I’m also short
TELL me about it, I’m cold so easily and people can fit their hand around my wrist
Same XD (when I was 9) Now I'm all fat and lazy
Wtf those move's XD
I was skinny as a child even tho i ate a lot of food
Can any one dance
As a member of the skinny society, i can comfirm this is true
Yes! I hate the comments people make.
I was told to eat a burger by my 5th grade teacher and now I don’t like to show my arms anymore
People call my place a bedroom with noo ac and a broken fan"a very tiny desert. ME:ah yes,the perfect temperature
How did you get up there at the starting of the video?
I’m extremely skinny and I don’t weigh a lot and people ask me “Do you eat? Are you okay?” yes, I am fine. I actually eat until I’m stuffed (which was a habit since I was little) and my metabolism refuses to make me less skinny.
As a person who was once skinny as hell and then became fat as hell, I can relate to this while also, having a experience of the opposite of most of it.
I get called don't you ever stop eating
Yes
That dancing is gonna give me nightmares... but don't worry... IM WORSE 😬
Being really skinny when I was younger these are 100 percent facts
Me too my mom thinks I'm crazy
Excellent vid. :)
To anyone else who is skinny do you ever look at your arm and think “Damn my arm is loooooooooooooooooooooog!”
Yes people always compliment me until I tell them all the shitty stuff that my body did to me
HOW THE HELL I AM 11 AND ALMOST 140 POUNDS
Yeah, when people says "do you even eat?" I always reply "probably more than you but I'm still fit"
I can’t relate cause I have always been kinda chubby hahaha but I understand ✨
66 is not a healthy weight for someone skinny and who is probably in their mid twenties, 85 I believe but 66 is too damn low
Fuckin hate it when people do that ring around you wrist thing
Truth😂
Same
fr I had a friend (now ex friend) who said to my other friend that they were gonna "break their malnourished arm" and uh a lot of not okay stuff so thats why it's ex friend
I got strong metabolism so I always look like I never eat even if I just finished a whole fucking feast
Well you definitely dance better than me.
That meat under you bones thing  I said that to people
Bru straight 📠
Idk if y’all noticed but she can kinda throw it back lol
So true why do I have to be so skinny
For real though no belts fit me and all my pants are to big
At least you’re pretty cute ☺️
For me it's the opposite. I'm 150 pou ds at 13, and I can't wear hoodies even in the fall or I'll sweat. No one bullies me(surprisingly) but I still really hate being overweight:/
I would much rather be skinny than a fat ass like me
I absolutely hate being skinny, made fun of all the time
Thank u so much I can't count the number of times I've been told "eat some more" or "do your parents torture you."
Facts,can relate alot,just not the cold one,I DO indeed get cold really fast,but I barely got cold,I mean im heating up in October
Wym u can dance queen
“I just got into a healthy weight like this year”  Scale: *660 pounds*
This is accurate in ever single way  people always tell me “go eat a pack of Oreos” and no belts ever fit me
⟟ can’t eat meat, SHARON! I’m a vegetarian.
I wanna be skinny
I have the same problems
SoOOo relatable
The bruise part is so true.  (I’m 6ft 2) and very skinny   Once I was going to go on a deep sea fishing trip, and I had to take a sea patch so i wouldn’t get sea sick the next day. Well all i remember was getting up to go use the bathroom at like 12:00 (we had to leave to go on the boat at 3am btw) and I don’t remember anything else except my dad waking me up face first on the floor, we have hard wood flooring…. Let’s just say I have several bruises on my chest and it hurt a lot when I would breath xD     Edit: all of these were so true  Great video
The skinny shaming really messed me up cause people would be so blunt to you and just say whatever and then when I started to gain a bit more weight everyone would say how much I’ve changed
I make myself eat until I almost pass out but in the end I gain like 1 pound
Look your dancing is better then 90 percent of people on tik tok
I couldn't agree more!  I have been shopping for groceries & have had so many ladies talk about me like im not there "skinny bitch"  like they have some rigbt to assume i try to be this skinny. I tried for years to just gain 10 lbs!  Lmao. Then menopause hit & now i gained 30lbs! 🙄🤤😅
No body can live in this people nor fat or skinny live the way you want and dont care abt otherw
Eyyy same
You're totally lying to yourself. You've got moves for days!!
I understand I'm 13 and I'm only 83 pounds
100% accurate, people’s comments are so annoying
Relatable
Some people get fatter harder than others
The bra confirms it. it's a girl
Not being able to dance is not just a skinny people problem 😆
Yeah my brother gets those comments all the time and he just says let me be skinny its not my problem your so fat
Same problems as you girl you're not alone 😔✊🏽
I got 1-5 and I'm pretty fat 😬
You still cute
Michael Jackson was skinny.
I’m still skin and I lost weight which I don’t know how but I have nothing else to say
I don’t think not being able to dance has anything to do with being to skinny but okay
You’re absolutely right! You really can’t dance! 😂
Relatable girl I is twig you touch me and 0.0000002millisecond later I had a bruise
I'm lik 400 pounds and I moon walk
actually best dancer ever lived
Until I saw your bikini I thought you were a guy
Its so true im crying 😭😭😭
The dance thing is all white people I don't know any who can dance and I can't either
Well, I would trade with you in a heartbeat. I exercise, eat healthy and live an active lifestyle yet I’m still fat. I have lost some weight, but not a lot. I hate it.
It's OK Jayus us fat people don't know how to dance either lol
Feel your pain I’m literally a bean pole
i dont care if im the width of a fucking stick my weight makes me want to die. i would trade so fucking much to be thin
I'm 14 and 70.1 kg
I eat so MUCH LOL
Trust me I cant iether that is not just a skinny person problem icant damce and I am NOT skinny im not fat either im just not skinny
Are u supposed to be a boy like thing person it thing?
Im paper skinny
My dad always used to say, when I was ten and under, “Oh my gosh go eat ice cream or something. Your so skinny. Get some meat on your bones. Your gonna blow away in the wind”😐
This is the most accurate video I have ever seen for me
Those are the BEST dance moves ever!!
Every single one of these is me☹
All of this is me
People... People actually have low weight and that's their problem. Currently i am 172 cm and fucking 115 kiloes, DOES ANYONE understand how hard it is for me to think about skinnyness as a disaster? 😂😂😂
she speaking facts
I use child sized pants just so it can fit, nd no one ever suspects it *S T O N K S*
Nice dance btw jayus
Actually tho this all happens to me
As a skinny person who was 60 lbs at 10 and finally reached a hundred lbs due to the lockdown 13 I can deffanently relate
I can relate a lot to the society one. My parents, my grandparents, my relatives or even other relatives that I never even met before in my life. They will all just shame me for being too skinny. They even put me a nickname about that too. I'm not the one who chose to be like this I tried eating alot like they said but I just don't weight. They even took me to the hospital about this but my doctor said that when I grow up I'll will weight. The worst part is that when I go to school even my friends and teacher talk behind my back about that too. And the time in class that I can't forgot is my teacher shame me Infront of everyone. I'm really pissed off when I'm thinking of it. Sometimes I can't take it anymore I just roast them for a bit than walk away. And also my neighbors is always talking about me when I walk aside. They should know better than this to not shame a child or anyone. I bet they don't even go through the same situation that I did. And thanks to anyone who reads through this it's very long and I'm sorry for my bad grammar fill free to correct me.
Plus more clothes will fit
Finally. Im 5"10 and 108lb, and I've been waiting for this
If you workout, it will increases appetite as well as increase muscle mass which keeps you warm. Absolutely NO NEGATIVES FROM WORKING OUT - GIVE IT A TRY
Wanna trade I hate being chunky
aww your dance was cute 😂
This is me like im not even joking
Me who's not skinny: ha
Hey I’m skinny and tall too-
LMAOOO number 5 and 6 so relatable
The other thing is its easier to lose weight than gain it
Accurate. All of it is accurate.
Combined with being 5’11” and growing and mens clothing doesn’t go below 28in
Im not sure which is worse but being fat isnt that fun either
Really good dancer
Ha ha ha I have an entirely different problem, I look like I have a healthy weight for a 17yr old, but when I tell people (especially the doctor) that I’m 240 pounds at 5’10”, gets a lot of raised eyebrows
The ass bone is so relatable
But im more flexible because of it.. I think
Yea I’m pretty much a walking corpse I’m cold all the fucking time and it doesn’t help everyone else is fat in my house and keeps the heat low as shit during these cold months
Dance better than I do.  I wish I had your skinny problem.
The cant dance is a you problem
Im fat my whole life :,D
This video describes my life.
Girl, I just roasted myself on my photo to take the power back, and I said the same things! Sitting down hurts, pants fall down, ass is invisible 🤣 But they always say, pretty face is more important when talking to a person. I mean, we don’t talk with our asses, at least I hope we don’t haha Happy to be on my recovery journey, it’s delicious 😌 Thank you 🙏
These are all things I have problems with too, I'm sorry Jayus.
You think fat people can dance too?
I know its 100% true cuz I am skinny too and the biggest problem I have which is not in this video is whatever I eat its not giving me fat to make me weight , it gives me height to make me look more skinny
The last one is just a white people problem
Lol I understand fully my youngest, finally got to a "healthy" weight of 109 lbs. Healthy by Dr's. Standards. She just that way by genetics, and I'm sure you have the same
I don’t know are you a girl or a boy
With the go eat thin I literally ate Ramin grilled cheese tomato soup a double cheeseburger from Wendy's and nachos and I lost weight
I mean being skinny is still better than being fat like me ;-;
THESE ARE FACTS!
I’m a teen and so freakin skinny
I’d rather be skinny than fat...
I thought me not being able to dance was just lack of talent
I get you life sucks when you weigh 120
That dancing scene was fucking awesome
I feel too big, I'm a guy and I have like broad shoulders, and I hate that I do, because I feel like I'm huge
Facts
My bf is REALLY SKINNY
U dance way more better then me I dance like I got electriccudit I mean I don't dance at all
Luck you, there are people that been fat all there life
When i was 7 we got to put new holes in my belts
My mom says I'm to skinny 😑😔
Also,though I’m a good swimmer I sink instantly.My totally overweight wife floats like a boat.It’s exhausting to tread water
As a skinny person, I can confirm this 👍
This is so true I literally ate a 20 piece McNuggets and a fuck ton of fries and my weight stayed the same
I’m very skinny too
no one after 2014 can dance
These are all trueee
Point 3 is so true!   The worst part is when the people around you say "its not that cold" while you are technically freezing
The end of times is near If u want to be in  the lambs book repent and be baptized and keep telling people  about God and Jesus Christ God  Bless
Stop the cap “can’t dance” you nailed it
You dance beautifully 😎
dude no matter how much i eat i still look like a freaking skeleton
i can relate on a deep level
Onlyjayus I can relate I am very skinny
I don’t think you can’t dance cuz your skinny lol 😂
First of all why tf are you always on top of a counter, second of all stop dropping f bombs every 2 seconds you sound like a angry 6 year old who lost a game of COD. 🤦‍♂️
And for the opposite of skinny you got comments like “fucking exercise fat bitch” even tho you were still young and growing. Being fat is not a choice because if it was I’d be Dwayne Johnson.     I walk an average 20,000 steps per day in elementary school but still wasn’t skinny nor was I gaining muscle.
I don’t like dancing so I’m fine with it
I also have been skinny my entire life.
You can't dance?!? Your dancing is better then mine jeez 😂😳
You don't dance? Person (idk you're gender) you got moves!!
She’s gonna snap her arm while doing the dance moves😂
Being fat is worse
When I was 11 and 12 I only weighed like 89.9 pound I just reasently reach the weight of 110.5 and true ur right it does hurt to sit, especially on the floor
I have all these fudging problems... I was told I was too light in the military so I had to legit eat ALOT!
Bro my bestfriend is constantly making me feel bad about being skinny  “Oh you can’t talk your skinny” “How does it hurt you you’re skinny?” “How are you tired from running you’re not fat like me” “Being skinny is a good thing I don’t know why you’re upset” And on top of that a lot of insults that she thinks are jokes  I’ve just stopped complaining about my weight cause I’m sick of hearing the comments..
Well shit you still dance better then me
Same
Nice dance moves better than mine lol
Lol, I have all these problems, I wear atleast 2 jackets in summer, and wish for another, and school only has 2 school jacket types, so I can't wear a third jacket, cause I dont own a third
Same here I have high metabolism and adhd.
I feel u
This is me. I eat 5 meals a day to maintain "slim". I burn fat sitting on the the couch eating chips.  Still would rather have this as an issue than being fat.
There is one way to solve the dancing.  Just snap with your fingers and move your head from side to side.  Absolute classic move. Everyone can do it.
I’m no bio major but if ur clothes don’t fit it sounds like you bought clothes that are to big
Yikes. Society
I relate to this soooo much
Nahhh them dance moves are perfect lemme dance with you- ✨😌💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🪱🪱🪱🪱🪱🪱
Oh mah gawddd bestie get it I guess 🙄😝
I seriously wish i had these problems
Yeah I can't pay like that for the life of me
ALLL MY SKINNY PEOPLE DROP A LIKE 🙌🙌
I struggle with all those… including the dancing problem! 🤣
Same gurl
The fifth one is like half the reason i havent gained much weight
I feel you that’s me
Tall skinny kid in a short Asian family :,)
no cap u act like a boy
I'd rather be super skinny then fat.. I've got thyroid issues so I can lose weight unless it's like 1-2 pounds a month or I can gain 5-10 in a week
Not me but I have a friend who's skinny that when he sits down and leans foward, you can see the outline of  his spine.
HOLY CRAP FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE SHIT I GO THROUGH!!!!
Me also a skinny MF "all is true also we break bones easier because we have basically nothing protecting them"
I'm a chonky guy and I still have about %80 of these problems
Agreed and with the comments people talk about how its wrong (which it is) to fat shame but its completely acceptable to skinny shame
I’m skinny, long legs, and wide hips so I can’t wear women’s clothing. Like I can’t find a good size. But I wear men’s clothing anyway because.. yes. But my family don’t understand that and BUYS WOMENS CLOTHING, BITCH IT DOENST EVEN FIT
OK...the dance was awesome
With all this Feminist garbage being shoved down everyone's throats, maybe getting out of that mindset would do you good.  I've always liked skinny girls, and doubly so when they have Bob haircuts.  So there, I said it, and if I feel that way, you know full well there are other guys out there that feel the same way.  Don't bitch about what you were given, find someone that gets into it!
agreed 😑
This is actually true.. I’m skinny and my friends ask me if I eat..
Shut up racist
am i the only one who thinks shes not that skinny? 😭
Finding clothes :(
Yo Jay I have all the same probs! can't dance too!! Like I'm 5'5 and I'm 13 and only weighed 100 lbs once in my life, then I burnt off 6 pounds by SLEEPING!!!! MY FRICKIN METABOLISM WONT LET ME HAVE ANY FATS STAY IN MY BODYYYY
What does she mean she can't dance ? I can also relate to all of the problems
I am so skinny I get bullied for being skinny one time this kid came up to me and shouted “why are you do skinny!” While laughing:(
I got told that if they blew at me I would fall cause I was so skinny
I relate to this on such a deep level! I am 6’5 and 165 pounds. I’ve been told my whole life that I’m too skinny and it’s freaking impossible to find pants that fit and I have resulted to wearing Skate belts that are adjustable or non-leather belts that are far more adjustable but then I get crapped on for not looking professional enough at work. Super aggravating and the comments people would make about how skinny I am and was sucks!!!
I think u look gorgeous and u look pretty too. 🥰🥰 I know it's the same thing but that's how amazing u r😍
I remember when I was 10 I think and I was skinny and my uncle said if you don't eat more your going to become a skeleton....I BELIEVED HIM AND I WAS FAT UNTILL I WAS 20
My mother was always cold.
Yes I understand that so perfectly
Omg me too! I’m ten years old and my dad Literary says that!!!!
As a kid that is VERY skinny, I can relate to this very well. The worst is people's comments about my body. Everytime a family member or my friends mom come over, they always say "eat well!! You're so skinny you look like a skeleton!!"
Most of these problems are fat people's problems. Just reversed.
You can't dance but you can twerk
Let me let u some cookies!
Wait... clothes dont fit average sized girls and plus sized girls now you're telling me it doesn't fit skinny girls either?? So who exactly are female clothes made for???? Now THAT'S a conspiracy we need to look into .....
I relate to this I’m too skinny and when I tried to gain weight and ate a lot (for me) the only thing that got fat was my belly so I was practically a guy with skinny ass hands and legs with a medium sized belly 😭
Jayus, Jayus, Jayus we all know you can't dance
You dance way better then me.
She is the best dancer I've ever seen cannot change my mind
i feel like being fat because of gentics instead of skinny is worse
Jayus: And I can’t dance   Me: I can’t either
As a man that usually floats around 135lbs, I have to go to the kids section when I need stuff that fits. And my work supplied clothing makes me look like a kid wearing his dad's clothes pretending to be an adult.  It's fucking embarrassing.
Saaaaaaaame jayus same
I am also skinny but how the fuck do I gain weight? I eat so much, and I am still skinny
The dancing looks pretty good actually
Damn Jayus! You got some moves!!
I can relate to every thing you just said
I know your pain I'm 87 pounds at 13
She looks healthy to me what's the issue I dont get it
I’m 14 6’0 and around the 120-130 lbs, I know how you feel but I somehow never get cold
Every type of person can’t dance Jayus 😂
If it helps Jayus, you dance better than Elaine did on "Seinfeld" !
After having kids, you're welcome to have my body fat...
Imagine like no offense or anything but when you are a normal weight or skinny but not where you would like to be, you always feel so jealous over those girls that can literally just play a sport and be literally so skinny like I’ll be working out to loose that little piece of fat at the bottom of my stomach
How do i get skinny 😅 im really overweight and i meed motivation and a diet plz, THANK UUU
am I the only one wondering if they’re single?
I know I’m literally a stick and every body says “eat some food” “many u skinny” and it hurts
As a skinny person this is super relatable
So triggered rn
And I HATE it when people say "Oh I can make a circle around your wrist" like yeah I know. DONT NEED TO KEEP REMINDING ME.
Yea. I had to go buy a leather awl for the sole purpose or resizing belts.
Y’all talking about reasonable things me just wondering why she is on the countertop in the bathroom?
Ya no she is speaking facts and she is a cool person
This.... this is so god- dam true tho
Dang I have to much fat on me so umm I can't dance either
Feel like the last thing is a you thing lol
Her:Go poke holes in it me : That’s what she said
I dig those dance moves tho
Girl, thank you! I'm 41, 5'1 and 100 lbs. I CAN'T HELP IT! I'VE BEEN LIKE THIS MY WHOLE LIFE! My butt hurts sitting down, freeze all the time and yes I can't dance either. Lol! And trust me I eat!
So true I have all 6 problems
The fat supporters on twitter are about to be on this video so fucking fast
It is not that skinny people can’t dance you just can’t  sorry
You’re not the only one
Littlelry sucks to be skinny and I have to deal with people making fun of me everyday and I have to wear a jacket almost everyway and I keep eating and nothing happens
Your dancing is awesome
Jayus: "can't dance" Also Jayus: fucking obliterates the dance floor
I definitely feel the plaintive had relationship end because I was to skinny
I am sure not being able to dance is a skinny issue
Had to wear kid-sized belt lol
You can dance
I can’t dance either. But I’m bout a hundred pounds over the weight for my age but I’m still always. COLD. I have insulation but it’s like my mom giving me a jacket in 20 degree weather and not wearing it tf
You can dance
I’m 13 and weigh 71 pounds
Like hell you can't dance
???? Cant dance???? IM FAT AND CANT DANCE FUCK YOU
I've been skinny ever since i was born,(my mom was also skinny) and when she died everybody around me "encouraged" me to eat so many food.. And if i say i'm full they will think i'm "overreacting" and doesn't like the food.. Like tf?   Now i'm in my auntie's care and as long as there are food, she let me eat(especially vegetables) She never stop me and i can eat when i want.. Before my mom died, she never actually forced me to eat knowing i will never gain weight..
Ok I feel bad for you because I’m skinny and I can dance and sing
Yes. Ugh.
Best dance ever
I used to be a stick but now I'm at a healthier weight and bit curvy and I SWEAR I HAVE AN ASS NOW BUT ITS STILL WEIRDLY BONEY AND IT STILL HURTS WHEN I SIT 😭😭 CANT WIN  also that belt one hit too hard lmao
Very relatable
Not being able to dance sounds like a you problem
Girl you're about the same weight as I am and I'm 8 years old
My arms look like actual twigs and the belt oml. I was really thin a a kid and barely fit pants like you couldn't see my legs. The belt needed like 3 extra holes 💀
Don't do that again you not a dancer not to be mean
Ooh I can relate
TYSM FOR UNDERSTANDING XD
Right I'm super tiny I'm 5"4 and 114 lbs it is so hard to gain and keep weight on I have no boobs even when I was pregnant I only gained 24 pounds in the pregnancy and lost it all a month later and it sucks being so small because people do not take me seriously a lot I'm not very intimidating even if I try to be but little do people know I've learned how to fight and I know how to kick someone's ass
As a boney person, I can relate to this whoooooole video. Even my family members tell me I should eat more or gain muscle. It hurts.
Everything is relatable except I can dance really well😂
BUT YOU JUST DANCED YOU CAN SO ITTTTTT
*intense relate*
100/100 relatable, I also can't dance, skinny people problems
Whether you're fat or skinny people will always have something to say. Ignore those people. The wholesome people will love your presence regardless of how you look!
I CAN'T DANCE
I'd trade being heavier set for being skinny anyday.
Bruh I had a belt with new poked holes in it and I have fast metabolism which means it's a lot more difficult for me to gain weight
Wait ur skinny?
I eat as much as my stomach can handle, but the next morning all of the food gone without a trace.
I agree
I've been overweight my whole life, like literally right at the line between obese and overweight (even though I'm pretty good at hiding it, so people don't notice). I feel like a lot of these problems are the opposite for me. Like I have too much insulation so I will sweat even in like 50 degree weather. During the summer I have to consume so much more water than the average person, just to feel okay. I was also bullied a lot for my weight. Looking at photos of me from middle school, I'm definitely a lot fatter looking than I am now (that's mainly because I got so much taller while maintaining relatively the same weight). I've also grown up my whole life wearing really baggy clothes to hide my extra body fat. Only tgis year did I decide to start wearing clothes that actually fit me correctly.
Girl no one can dance
I'm scared of your life and what it's like
My friend saying to a kid you could break in the wind is not fucked up, its not a problem.  It'll build character for the child
Yea same with me but at least I'm super flexible
Same, sitting down really hurts
I do not have these problems
Lmao this is her best video
U glow girl
I rather have these problems
I am a very skinny kid and I’m so glad you made this video😂
I’m skinny. And I can agree with all of these
i was 140 and 5ft then i grew a ft over summer was still 140 i had to eat two penut butter sandwiches with a protein shake b4 bed and start working out to bulk up to 180 and look healthy
I have all of those problems ;-;
My friend is skinny and all of this is pretty accurate and she is baby and everytime some one is mean to her I feel violent and it’s not even because they talk about how skinny she is it’s cause she would draw animal people characters and I know 2 people who would call her a furry for it and I’m like wtf is wrong with you >:/
Hahaha relatable tho normal adult size belts is too big so solution is go buy kids size belt . It’s works seriously go and try. This is coming from a person who weights like what 77lbs ? 35kg .
But personality is 1000
I can relate to this
I have experienced all but the last
Last I knew I was 66.8 pounds but I dance!
I feel you i swear
Relatable
My friends used to be like "do you eat anything your so skinny" ;-;
your a better dancer than me
As someone who's overweight and struggling to lose that weight, this feels insensitive even if it isn't, because there's a big stigma for women to be skinny and pretty.
Honestly I up this very much, I'm really skinny and my friends usually call me the Skinny King or Skinny Legend, I usually get bodyshamed by my mother about this cuz like I literally look like I'm gonna break my arm if someone poke it, my bones are slightly poking out so I wear a hoodie 24/7 to cover it up
Wait are they only 66 pounds? (Not meant in a rude way)
66
I can’t gain any weight
Who gives a shit. You're fucking incredible and one of the most gorgeous women I've ever come across and I don't even live on your continent. Fuck those people, even though it's hard sometimes hard. Not to mention your knowledge about everything. Just fuck 'em. Go Jayus.
I can relate
Your only 66 pounds? It said that..? Im skinny af lol 143 5"10 lmao the belt thing is so true
I was once compared to Eugenia Cooney and I didn’t get it until I googled her later on. She’s gorgeous, so I took it as a compliment. But the person meant it as a skinny joke.
Girlllll you can dance don’t you say that
Literally 3, 4, 5, and 6 apply to me VERY MUCH
Can’t dance? I guess we see different things. You def can dance
same queen
I used to be this skinny untill I got hypothyroidism
Ur also racist
U can kinda dance
I'm skinny and I normally don't eat at school and every one there is like "do you get enough food at home"
So true
Girl, omg same, being 18 and 70 lbs is problematic sometimes
Dont Take drugs Like Meth
I am very skinny and I F**KING BUY BELTS FROM THE KIDS PART OF A CLOTHING STORE AND STILL NEED TO POKE HOLES IN THEMM it sucks
Same I can relate to all but the cold one I've almost never been cold
They i think I will break and weak when I am stronger then them
no thats just you, im skinny as fuck and dance better than everyone haha     that’s because im cooler than you haha
Same...same
They wrap their fingers around your arm and say: LOOK AT THAT The other problems? Nah im ok But the fucking comments
Lol
I love being chubby
my mom says i have dead hands (most likely due to being skinny) because when im in a room with ac my hands are freezing, and everyone else’s hands are warm lol
I'm one of those skinny people   55yo can't gain weight
"I can't dance!!" It's ok me neither 🤣
I can relate to this I’m 11 and I’m only 55 pounds
Yeah but ask anyone in the world I think they’d rather be skinny than obese
Same
Being skinny yeah I have conquered the cold and belt still fits
I love the dance😂🤣 this also is happening to me lol
I relate to this
That all true tho and I'm skinny so I understamd
I do feel bad for skinny people as a fat person
Finally someone who knows my problems.
100% accurate I have a superhuman metabolism
Wym you can’t dance your so good!🤭🤭😂
God damnit I feel attacked
I say those are some pretty good dance moves if I say so myself
just go to the gym
Doing situps kills my spine so I can't get abs. My shoulder blades look like wings, my ribs show without sucking in, my ankles and wrists look bony af, my chin digs into everyone when I lay my head on them, I can't sit on laps because my butt bones hurt them. Also I grow super slow.
I know I ain't the only one who relates to the belt one. I still fit my clothes from 7th grade  😃🤌🏾
high metabolism gang 🦾🦾
That vibe when you get insulted for being doing but you will also be insulted for being fat
Are you pretty or just privilege?
Don feel bad im fat and cant dance
To accurate as skinny person
So true so true SAMMMMMEEEE
Fat people : we were raised by bears
As a skinny person, everything here minus the last one is all true! My friend poked my on thw shoulder the other day lightly with her rounded nail and it left a hecking bruise. At age 9 I was still like 55-67 pounds!
I just thought it was me ... I am 58.8 pounds at 12 :/ yea..
I relate to this to much
My lifw
Yes
Me: *eats 10 pounds of food* My body: Skinny. Take it or leave it.
The dance part is a you problem
what's worse is that I'm skinny and can confirm all of these as accurate
A strong gust of wind would have swept you away like a kite
Dude wtf how tall r u
The belt thing goes too even if your fat
Can confirm all of this: Sitting down true, I almost broke a rib by trying to do the worm, Summer I use a winter blanket, I have super long legs too I was 14 wearing 18 pants, I took a physical test and my muscles are very good for my age but I was less than 100lbs until I was 14, CANT DANCE FOR $100,000,000
#SKINNYLIFESMATTER 🤣
Meanwhile I'm chubby and still very cold lmao
It’s funny how people think that being skinny is also nice there’s problems with being fat and skinny and they say the coolest things that are meant to be a joke but it still seems offensive
Dancing is probably your fault
YO I CAN AGREEEEEEE
Being skinny is f-ing annoying, coming from a skinny persibn
I get called a twig all the time I weigh 78 and I'm 12
This is just so accurate
Me being super fat it’s all the opposite
Me all the time, finally I see someone who is explaining my life in one tiktok lmao
Yes omg
Im underweight but sitting amd dancimg is something I do everyday and it doesnt hurt  Maybe cuz Im 8 Edit: mistype, Im 9 turning 10 in 5 months
New holes - the story of my every single belt
Wait, you’re a baller?
I like the way you move :)
THIS IS SO TRUE. im 13, im very, VERY skinny, and i can confirm that this is true.
YES
I wish i was skinny tho im fat lol
I have ALL those problems 😂 I’m 5,6 94 pounds.
I really wanna see a fat guy do that dance
That's facts
I can relate
Don’t worry jayus I’m also skinny and I can’t dance
People are more harsh against skinny people compared to fat people because we live in a society
IM SKINNY TOO AND MY FAMILY LITERALLY CELEBRATE ME EATING SOMETHING THAT HAS ALOT OF CALORIES 😭😭😭
Yo honestly truly felt number four literally I needed a 26 waist and a 34 leg length in 8th grade, do they make those where I'm from, absolutely not
Bro parents and relatives be like do you even eat? You look so thin and skinny  Meanwhile me finishing a 3rd bag of family sized chips: *Yeah, I don't think so*
Same here this is the worst
60 freaking pounds
A couple of those also apply to overweight ppl 😂😂i felt so identified
the ribs one💀i absolutely can’t stand laying on my stomach because i can feel my ribs pressing against the surface of what i’m laying on and it’s so uncomfortable and slightly painful if it’s a hard surface lmao
:-: you weigh the same amount of kg as my 12 year old sister.
For my whole time watching u i thought u were a boy..
I looove your dancing
…and people think we control this we we to be normals we don’t like being called twig, paper etc.
All of these are so true 👍
Its not fucked up though
I like ur dancing😂
Oh wow poor you 🙄
better than being fat, can’t even express urself
Same
The fact that I’m _three times_ your weight kills me. I’m not even fat.
Did she just complain about being skinny 😐
To be honest I don’t really care if some says, you look like a stick etc. to me
I give this example to people I know. When we have lasagna, we make half the dish for me and the other half for the five other family members there. I'm 19 and just left home but still. I only weigh 144 lbs. I EAT LIKE THAT A LOT. I'm also 6ft tall.
I can relate
My dad always said if I turned sideways I'd be invisible lol
I SWEAR THAT IF SOMEONE TELLS ME TO EAT MORE I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY, BITCH I CAN'T, IT PHISICALLY DOESN'T FIT INTO ME
I too am skinny and another problem is that people think we’re weak. Which we are because we can’t gain any weight needed for muscle!
Same
Ur wrong(at 1 thing) u dance good as heeellll😂😂
“its so windy imma hold onto you just in case you fly away 😂” bro just lemme live my life
Bruh, I love her😂😂😂😂
1.I am skinny  2.has these problems 3.can’t dance
Ahh yes I’ve been skinny for a long time too and I’m now finally at a healthy weight
How do you solve your skinny
.....you know this happens to fat people too tho. ;-;
Meanwhile fat people start breakdancing and moonwalking
"i cant dance"  *_proceeds to bust sick moves_*
Geez...clean up your mouth!!
I was just talking about my skinny people problems to a friend of mine 😂
What do you mean you can't dance? Those are some moves
It’s true I’m skinnnnnnnny
I’m just gonna act like I did not just watch that dance and I’ll see ya later
Dont worie i am fat and i dont know to dance
I feel you! I’m sure I’ll gain some weight as I grow. I am 15, 5’3”, at 91 lb (I’m pretty sure that’s an average weight for someone my age, don’t really care either way.) I weighed around 100 lb when I was 12 😂 so idk. But, I relate 100% to all of these. 🫂
As a skinny person I refuse to do sit-ups because it bruises my tailbone
I mean, I would argue just work out. I used to be skinny like that till I started working out, but it's been a solid two years and I still haven't hit my target weight no matter how many calories I add to my diet. It's just so much easier to build muscle when you're already fat.
“Go eat!” BRO THTS ALL I FREAKING DO!🙄😭
As a skinny person, I can confirm  Don't know if it's good
No you're good, trust me you don't want to gain weight, if you feel healthy DONT GAIN WEIGHT!!!
i can never get fat even though i eat alot, so uh.. idk
“poke new holes into it” hit hard
Dont forget the watch i have to put holes into it
WHY IS THIS SO FVCKING TRUE😅
This is me, I'm not as skinny now but I'm still skinny. I get belts the have holes all the way around
I'm short, AND SKINNY, so I'm a ligit fucking twig, I will litirally break in half if someone pulls on my arms and my legs
That’s how I dance XD
As someone who was 125 pounds (I hope that’s right) when I was 12. Sooooooooooooooooo I can’t regálate
ME 💯 but I can dance ha
Im very underweighted and everything u said is soooo true x)
That sitting down is so true the bones poke your skin and it's painful af
Bruh, try being fat.
I'm a skinny teen and I can relate to ALL of these- 😭✋🏃💨
But your also still very handsome/gorgeous :)
It really is as simple as eat more calories in calories out
I completely agree with you
The ending. 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
O have these problems
My bones/rib cage at the bottom pokes out more than usual and collar bone (I'm healfy don't worry I don't have back problems BUT LAYING DOWN  AAAA
FACTS ON FACTS
This summer I went to a camp and met a lot a guy who was fairly skinny, and yeah, he is very sensitive with comments about how he's "too skinny" and shit like that.   If you see someone who is clearly uncomfy with smth like this, just don't say anything. Act chill with them, it boosts their confidence with you not commenting on stuff like that
So true
In very fat
Iol
I cant dance too...
I defenetly relate to the laying down thing and they can see my bones but ofc its as bad as anorexia
I'm so skinny that I have to make holes in my belt every day bec I have a fast matalieom but I do get cold like every 5 second even when I have a sweater and  I'm a kid and some kid shirts are too big for me
I’ve been extremely skinny my whole life and I can dance but I have an advantage cause I have been taking dance lessons since I was 4 and I’m now 11 so.
This accurate Especially the ass part
I can relate
i’m not fat but i’m not skinny either, but why is everyone commenting about “oMg hAhA sO rELaTaBLe FaT pEoPLe dOnT gEt iT” like that’s actually so rude people got their own struggles so stfu and just be nice dude
“Can’t dance” sure Michal Jackson
“Go eat a burger” The handful of times I fully ate a burger, half the time I nearly wanted to throw it up
Relatable
The reason you can't dance, is not that you are skinny.
Get any skinnier you'll fall thru your asshole
Do you think it's e!sy being fat? Half the time your on a bike your ass hurts you have low energy and all you want to do is lay down and people say to lose weight dont think your the only one with problems
If she was latina her grandma would take care of that
I feel youre goddamn pain i cant handle this twiggy life-
The last one is a you problem
I agree on the clothes and coldness
I am also a very skinny person, i am a man and i weigh 55 kilos or 120 pounds, and i look skinny af like my wrists are like 2.5 inches wide, my legs are like 4 inches wide, and my thighs like 5 inches wide, when i lifet my shirt up you can see all my ribs, the bottom ones like out a lot and it looks like if i had boobs or something, also i can't fit anywhere and be comfortable
Wow that dancing was a 10
The 4th one got me.
I can't relate to the belt one because the only belts I have have holes all the way around 👍🏾
When im skinny people say this to me have you eat when i literry just eat a whole meal i can dance i don't get cold that fast
I am skinny to and I can relate to all of these especially the last one
am 13%body fat and I can confirm
Slim is the best 👌
66kg she fat
I can't imagine being able to sit down without my ass bones hurting but atleast I can hot weather easier than others
Sameeeeeeeee
You think being skinny is bad I’m 210 lbs at 12 and have tried to kill myself because of how it makes me feel, I genuinely need help
That's all about me and I'm 11 but I. Am. So. F#ing. Skinny as well 😐
Lol I had to poke holes on my belt…. In the other direction lmao
ALL OF THIS IS SO RELATABLE
My mom called said I looked skeletal the other day. I’m very close with her, but no matter how close we are, no one seems to understand how hurtful that is. Also- every time I lie on my back or lean on something it crunches, so not only does it hurt, everybody else hears it, too.
Can 10000000000% relate
Why is this so relatable 😭💀
Someone who understands but I do dance and you can if you try, I’m not comfortable watching myself dance still
This hit way too close haha
Me at 13 weighing 70 lbs
Omfg the comments one is so accurate it hurts-
Bro same
I get blown around in the wind like I'm in a fucking gogurt commercial. Because I am tall and so skinny, I look like ive survived auschwitz.
Yeah the dancing is pretty bad.
My grandpa always says to me "Go eat something, if you don't your probably going to fly away" and I'm like umm sorry I have an eating disorder and I don't eat much
As a skinny person that lives in Canada, I can confirm that wind is cold asf and I wear a sweater year-round  Edit: 0°C PERFECT WEATHER
My life 🤩🤩🤩
YES, my family never understands when I tell them things like this!!
I am the same
FINALLY!! YES!! Also the last one explains a lot
Idc skinny>fat
i love jayus lol
The sad truth i can relate to
Facts
I thought it was just me😩🤚
I'm skinny I can't get cold fast and I can't dance Becuse I don't want to dance
Her dancing just made my day haha
I wish I was skinny
Would you rather be fat?
Facts
MY MOM LIGIT SAID MY DAD HAD TO PUT NEW WHOLES IN MY PURSE 😂😭
Facts
This is literally every day at school
Maybe have a boyfriend who's a little chubby
well a guy once roasted a skinny protagonist saying "Man get yourself some colors Fool and that haircut its embarassing to be seen with you"
I've been jealous of Jayus' body shape for a while now. How they're so tall too, I wish I looked like them. 😩
“I CANT DANCE“ me : I feel ur pain 🤚😌
I have all these problems but i can dance a little and i like the cold
As a skinny person I Relate to this on a very spiritual level
The last one may be just you lmao
I’m skinny af to
"I cant dance" *Continues to show best dances in the whole fricking world*
I agree with you soooooooo gad dam much
I'm small and skinny
I think your dance moves were ✨legendary✨
felt that on a spiritual level-
Every time my friends say "omg girl ur so skinny" I keep my tears in 🥲
5 is so true and annoying af
This hit way to hard
I remember having teachers pull me out of class to make sure that my parents were feeding me when I was a kid. I also have very distinct memories of other kids trying to break my bones because I was so skinny. Fun times
I agree
" YOU CANT DANCE "  proceeds to bust some funky moves
I suffer these problems 😭
Yep me to
That belt one is so accurate and I hate it
Straight up🤣😅😅we have to force feed like a mf
100% true
Your pretty good at dancing
Um, us bigger people cannot dance either it's not a skinny thing bub
Me and u are the same
OMG you are so right
The dancing part it’s just a white people thing
Im skinny and its great and awful at the same time.
I think the dancing part is a YOU Problem
Cannot relate
YES
naw bru i’m way more skinnier when i feel my arm i feel bone on both sides    also 62 pounds.     MY SECOND GRADE FRIEND IS 72 lbs
It was the Adderall for me :p
Same way
I'm skinny asf  All of these are my problems
I don't know what tf you're saying those are some sick moves!
Did it say 66.4 on the scale?
Literally me
i’m very skinny as well and i’m about 20-30 pounds under the average weight for my age
I can confirm. All of this is true, if you are natural skinny it's because you have a high natural metabolism.
All these are me but I don’t care about the cold part
Me waiting for fat problems so I can relate ;-;
Me lol
I'm not skinny
My BFF is realllly skinny! And this is all true
Best belt to use for skinny people is a tape belt, i have one, and i am skinny and it works
Yep.
I'm skinny as hell and my  cousin always says to me "have you lo s t some weight?" "You really need to eat more" Florence your going to get very sick if you don't start eating" I'M 11 YEARS OLD! He scares me so much and i don't like seeing him. As well as that he always says "your dad and Charlie only love you because your a girl" "you know that your dad is discusting" my mother is 31 my dad is way older and I have 3 siblings
You put it into words!
No, you're dance was awesome
Ok all of these are true but I can dance pretty well
I am soooo skeeeeny so i can relate and thay suuuuck
as someone who’s been skinny and have had many skinny friends, it is more than possible to put on weight. It’s not easy just like working out and dieting can be for others. But make sure you eat plenty of nutrient rich foods, even when you’re full just take a few more bites. Mix this with some exercise and you can even build muscle, basically a basis for bulking.
Dance either and I'm chunky but whatever you come up with as dance moves are your own dance moves don't let anyone steal them my sister always steals mine
Yea this is true I'm cold most of the time
I can relate. I was a fat fucker of 120kg most of my life, now I'm just under 70kg and I freeze, my trousers and belts NEVER fit abd my arse is constantly sore from sitting down.
Jeez, now I know why I'm always cold...
Yo I understand glad to know somebody else can see my pov
Me every sunday night dancin
Im... not skinny🤣 and I still can't dance so
I know, I hate my life right now because I am 43 pounds.😭😭😭😭😫😨
As a twig I can relate 😅
THIS IS ALL TRUE 😭😭😭😭😭
JAYUS IS GOATED 🐐
Im skinny and I can dance but that may be because I'm half Puerto Rican
This is so relatable and hard to grow up with people saying oh go eat something because  I don't want you to blow away in the wind or get some meat on your bones or its unhealthy to be so skinny this makes me cry at night because I eat but people don't understand
I'm still laughing I lost 80 lbs I feel like you lol but  lol
Pleeeaaaase y can I relate to this so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Us skinny people can eat a whole buffet and not gain a pound
Me being 17 and 78lbs. I agree with ALL of this.
Amen✝️❤️
You dance 1 million times better than me my dance is just the worm HAHAHAH a I am weird and I know
Same I have a fast metabolism
You can dance fine girl
I like you lol
And I’ve been very fat my whole life but that’s fine
Dude can we switch bodys because I have been fat my whole life and I have gotten to the point to we’re I would starve myself
I mean-- all of that happens to me but I'm * not * skinny 😬😐
My fat is is a warm pillow
True I have been so skinny that for my whole life people could see my ribs
Brooo so relatable
the worst part is when you had to go on long roadtrips and couldnt get up for hours. istg my ass bones were on the edge of life after those
Luckily I'm curvy
Everything make sense because I am as skinny
I hate it when people ask me how I'm skinny, I'm always like : Dude idek my body just likes me I guess.
Sitting down is so true. If I’ve been in a car for too long one of my checks will give out and it’ll feel like I’ve blown a tire
I can relate to this, people always mention how skinny I am
Im 135
Amazing dance moves
Happens all the time I skinny af and I can’t gain weight
I remember freshman year of track in HS, the first words said to my skinny friend by one of the coaches was “Get this kid a sandwich”
I feel you with the clothes one especially plus I am picky. I get called a stick at school
I don’t know if this is worse as a guy or a girl. I don’t gain muscle at all no matter what. I’m not as slim as you, but 150 on a heavy day is pretty light for a dude my size.  I still relate to every one of those problems though
You really put me out there lol 😂
Number 6.. RELATABLE 😂😂😂
Explain why I'm skinny, yet I've been dancing since I was 4
Finally, some relatable content on yt 😆
Not being able to dance has nothing to do with being skinny. It's because you're white
When I was like 10 I could do push-ups with 1 arm, not because I was strong, but because I weighted 20 kg (44 lbs)
The video is a basically a compilation of conversations I've had trying to explain to people why I don't do certain things like dance and sit for hours on end.
Holy hell you can dance well- I look like a very awkward wyvern that’s trying to do the worm.
The cold one gets me.
I’m pretty sure the last one is a you problem XD
I love being a thick girl after watching the problems skinny people have😊
This is all true i am SO scrawny 🥲 And when u use a belt on a big pair of pants the pants fold in all around the waist and it like just JAMMES straight into your side, it is excruciatingly painful if they are jeans too.
Big problem for me too lol, I'm 17 and haven't gained weight for years already, my 11 years old brother is only a few kilos away from me and he still got the small feet (I weight 38 kg)
I am so skinny so SAAAAAAAAMMMMMEEE!
true 1000%
Fat ppl haha im happy im fat
Don't worry I can't dance either
I ate a lot but my weight never reach over 45kg...
Can’t dance is not a matter of skinny I should know
These true af
I honestly think I might be skinnier—
All of those are true coming from another skinny person
Your dancing is amazing lol. You dance better than me xD
Same. That is all.
I am fucking skinny but i can get warm or cold on comand
Well is being skinny is idk very bad but still we too have advantages than those fat people out there
I had to put a new hole in a belt for the first time and felt so proud, hopefully for the last time though
I've nearly been blown away in the wind once on my bike in 30-32 kph
I have these problems too
I have the same problems
Me: skinny as hell even tho I eat 5 times a day
Please don't blame the dancing on being skinny
"Skinny people problems" I wouldn't know lmao
Same problems lol
I'm still waiting for the day her sink breaks
I was skinny until I started gaining muscle in high school. Now I'm fat. Lol
Finnaly I found someone like me SKINNY AFF
Gotta love having a negative BMI
I'm skinny and I can't dance too I think this proves it
Im fat and warm 🔥 wish i had a  girlfriend to warm up. 😔 No one wants the "Big" guy though.. If a guy isn't perfect then nobody wants him. Im 260lbs 5"11  and decent looking and i still have absolutely no luck at all..
Same here we have a lot of problems
I’m the same thing
You're better Dan me at dancing
Heh you call that skinny i can see my god damm ribs just standing still
Yes get it mama
I can relate to what you're saying one of our daughters always looks like we've never fed her in 6 months but that girl can sit down and eat a whole chocolate cake and not gain an ounce
It's hard to be tall as well
you can’t dance you say.. i’m not a simp but your not
i’m right here with you lmaooo
Advice: Don't wear a bikini
I seriously don't get how people can shame skinny people, like damn you must be so grumpy and sad.
Now imagine being a skinny chef, you get a lot of crap lol
FACTS, especially the first one, which is one of the reasons why I hate sitting down for too long.
Im not skinny my weight just fluctuates,one day,everythings tight,the other my clothes are falling off
Omg I found a solution for the belt problem, it's this laced stretchable belt where he can hook in any where
These are pretty accurate, I'm skinny too. Different thing is, I'm hot most of the time. It also sucks bc sometimes my classmates who's a bit fat comes up to me and say they wanna look like me, no, no you don't
Even if you eat, ALOT, you can't gain weight
"I can't dance" So does my fat self like when I dance my body wobbles more than a plate of jello
Make Fat People Problems
must be awful being skinny 😐
👌🏼💀💀 every problem I've ever delt with
Im kinda skinny but laying down just makes me dizzy, and somehow i don’t get cold fast but when i get cold i get COLD.
Omg so true
Society sucks
I agree I'm also skinny
Faaaaaacys
Your still beautiful
Man, i think the society is right... you should just lay back and eat alot
SAME!! i have diabetes 😭
Going to PE class makes these problems realy annoying especialy the people, they always say things like "A gIrL iS sTrOnGeR tHaN yOu" Its just so bad
I’m fat :D -sobs-
Been there I’m 52 lb but I’m 10
same
My step mom has the same issue lady out ate my fat 250 lbs ass in an eating contest and then proceeded to eat desert and mock me
The worst is when people say "just eat more "😡
What is that cainda dance hahaha he cant danc🐁🐁🐁🐁🐁🐁
You weight 66 pounds damn im 11 and i weight 106
The comments are so accurate. It kinda gets old like they say omg y look like a presxhooler.so little omg this wind is gonna blow u away. That's all I hear all day long. I get freezing cold. I poke holes in the belt very far down and same with watches 🤣 my doctor says I need to eat more...
Those dance moves are fckin good ngl
I relate to this on a personal level, and that includes the dancing
It’s so damn true 😂
Being tall as fuk (physically standing out from a crowd) do wacky things to your confidence in social settings
Oh god yes
These are so relatable, I have VERY fast metabolism and people come to conclusions 🤣🤣 People at my school are like: " Wow you must workout so much to be so small." Like , is it a compliment or-
Did that scale seriously say 67 lb? Or was it with one foot
To all my skinny people I solved the belt problem Buy a fabric belt Or Buy a custom groove belt
Very relatable, u can even feel ur bone touching the sit when sitting. Also people literally joked around me saying wind will blow me away 😒 kinda Annoying
Same bruh
All facts.
relatable but when I dance I dont really care how I dance so I can bend and kinda flex in a weekend rd
I eat alot alot and I'm still skinny.
Those were some sick dance moves😂😂
And when ur overweight(Like me) -Normal clothes dont fit or look shitty -Not healthy -Less persistence -"How much do you weight?83??? WTF??" -"fat fuck" -Cant dance either -Less attractive to most people -Always fuckin sweating at over 22° outside -Having to "hide" your belly so you look kinda normal -Cant eat larger portions without others thinking "no wonder hes fat"  Yeah I'd nuch rather be skinny
If your bigger ppl would say "put down the food"
Gotta hate ppl saying that they can snap your arm in half ITS JUST AS EASY TO BREAK YOUR ARM AS IT IS MINE SHUT SHUT
Hah been there and especially laying on floor because if feel being plank
Relatable
I love your dancing tho 🥺😩👑
Good dances
Im fat i have the same problems but opposite
Yooo facts I just got to my ideal bodyweight at 24. All but number six was me nobody really understood.
Fr.
Crazy how everyone in the comments is super skinny too. What are the odds...
Weighting 65LB I get everything on this lust
Everything is so accurate, my friends freakout becuase my wrists look like I'm a skeleton.
Me over here who can't relate because I all I eat is chips and mic Donalds sprite all day👁️👄👁️
I feel sorry for my cousin he's almost 18 and like 6 3" and he's only 60kg while his brother s are 100kg but then again all he does is play Minecraft so I guess it's ok
BRO STFU BC THATS THE BEST DACING IVE SEEN
I liked the dance. . . Just saying
The 5th one isn’t a problem for me cuz I legit find it funny when people say that to me especially with the appetite I had they’d be like “Where is all that food going?” To me it was hilarious
I KNOWWWW... its annoying
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who is so skinny they have weight problems
Skinny person here! Super accurate! I’ve been skinny my whole life, still am, and I can’t even lay down forward cause it hurts. My classmates have been telling me to eat more meat and protein because I just have NO MEAT ON MY ARMSSSS  Also am not strong cause no muscles
Are you a girl
Body shaming is still body shaming no matter what size body someone has. I see bigger girls make fun of skinny girls all the time. That shit is so sad.
My little sister is so  skinny but I'm chubby my mom says she wishes she could take fat from my body and but it on her it hurts the both of us and makes us sad
I can literally relate to all of this… sitting down on the gym floor while wearing jeans tho is painful… agreed tho it hurts to lie down on my chest for to long sitting can also be uncomfortable a lot
The dance part is most likely the over average height part to the skinny bones, I recommend sub sandwiches than a burger tho.
Jayus dance tutorials when?
Soo true I need to eat!
Same
Livin' for the Jayus Jackson
I'm 18 and i have been underweight most of my life lol, mostly due to having a smaller appetite (Not an ED, i just get full with 1 slice of pizza instead of 2 or 3).  I can confirm the belt one and the sitting one, as a guy that uses hats a lot, putting that under your as$ can help, but without it any non-cushioned chair means either scratching uncontrollably or enduring the itch and pain.
I feel your pain 😞✊
Couldn't agree more but at least It looks like we kinda have abs I guess 😆
I know and i am also skinny, i however get hot very quickly
I have heard so many comments it’s so dumb and I’m only 16
You can dance
What are u talking about ur the best at dancing
I can relate to every single one of these
Your dance moves are Better then mine-
That belt one hit different 😂 although being skinny has nothing to do with being able to dance
The first two are so true omg 💀   And o find it so annoying when my friends are like “your are so much skinner than me I’m so fat” like I can’t halo it okayyyy
don't know wtf you're talking about. you bustin a move.
I can relate
im the opisite on cold I go to sleep nah that = sweat everywhere
Technically the dancing problem is yours your problem my brother skinny and he can dance
I’m just over 12 and I’m just over 30kg
This. EVERYTHING about this
Damn I have bigger B**bs than her and I am a man
my friend told me i look like a dying vegan😅
And still fine as ever...
Correct
At work, my hips get bruised while leaning over the cutting counter...I guess that's what I get for being both short and skinny
I have been both.  Heavy when young, thin when I was in my 20's. I know exactly what you saying about the ass bones hurting, learned that the hard way.  She I had padding I could just plop my butt down, no problem.  I lost 100 lbs, dropped down and destroyed my tailbone. But I didn't get as much criticism when I was thin, but a lot more when I was heavy. You say "Do you know what that can do to the mind of a young person" Try being fat, and all the even more horrible things people will say to you, even when being young. Sorry if I don't shead a tear for you.  Being thin is not the worst tragedy, in a world where most people want to be thin, and hate fat people.  Even now a days, people are attacking Santa Clause, the jolliest person that never existed.  WTF
Same
Never can gain weight
This is literally my life
Tips for skinny people to get to a better weight pls
TRUTH
So true I'm so skinny to
Your better at dancing then I am
I’ve also been super skinny my whole life even now when I’m getting better I can put my fingers under my ribs and everything is too big for me
Yea, when i see skinny person, i always thanks to god. For giving me delicious food trough my mom, granma or near restaurant.
At least you haven't been called fatty for all your life (like I have been)
SKINNY PPL CANT DANCE??!  welp- guess that’s why I don’t dance😳
Bro I wish I could be cold all the time
Okay maybe but remember you are perfect just like you are
I have those problems but I'm not very skinny
I am so skinny my back is bruised from the chairs at school    Side note    I have finally started working out and my arms are starting look normal and less like twigs
I'm really skinny so everyone do you eat salad
You are perfect. The way you are 😉😉😉😉😉
I get told to eat more meat and stuff to get more bigger but I don’t think they understand that I try to get bigger but I can’t like all of these are so accurate idk what to do to get bigger it so weird
I’m skinny and my family always makes fun of it but I’m only a kid and just I haven’t started gaining more
Well now it makes sense why this happens  I'm just skinny
Facts to all of them tho, but you can actually definitely dance better than me 🤣🤣💜💜😍😍😭😭
Don't use God's name in vein please REPENT
Idk if not dancing is a skinny problem. Don’t worry imma crap dancer too
Facts
Ayo I think being a fat fuck isn't so bad now
YO SAME HONESTLY
Girl, those moves where 🔥
I know your pain I’m 14 and 5’9 and way 50 kg
I always talk about the downsides of being skinny, but everyone always says “Oh but it’s not as bad as being called fat” I think being called “too fat” or “too skinny” are equally bad. Just my opinion though don’t come at me.
I have the same problem
I see all facts here I'm skinny af also
Another skinny person problem is when you have bony hips, and whenever I go to lay down on one of my sides in bed, it gets very uncomfortable and it takes me a while just to find a comfortable position.
I realized when I get hungry my stomach like tenses up
My mom tells me eat something cause I'm skinny as fuck
When you are skinny and you eat junk food everyday: Others see it as a good thing, I see it as a loss of homemade food.
And you can't forget about bloating :( almost everytime I eat, I get bloated and it's really annoying cause I constantly get stomach aches.
As someone who never gains anything after ANYTHING, I know this is true for me
I feel like no one realizes how fat phobic society is at this point I would rather bury myself alive then keep living in my body because I'm fat and I can't do anything to change it because of heredity problems
I am so skinny that my organs Make my stomach go out because they don't have enough room. 😑
skinny people dance better imo when i dance i look like a chunk of meat wobbling
Being skinny is my lifelong dream..
I’ve seen stocks of corn with more physique!!! Makes me want to pull an ear off!! Keep pvt.corn stock away from strong winds (Movie reference, don’t get but hurt over it. I’m a skinny fuck too)
Relatable
Literally happens all the time it's so annoying 😑
When I was super skinny I never got cold.
This is so true I should now because I've been skinny my whole god dam life
Bro same and still is still gets those comments from my own auntie and cousins
I want to be skinny and flat
My parents friends will literally be like ‘do you not feed her’ ‘eat something’ ‘eat more’
You said you can’t dance and then proceeded to perform every move I know
Na ur just white non of us can
I don't skinny people that can dance that might just be because you don't have rhythm but you can work on that
Same here but the only good thing is I’m never fat and don’t gotta work out
And I'm always cold so
Every time I used to hear number five are used to get really anxious insecure and every time we had dinner I will eat like a pig
I was sooo skinny as a child, like literally i could die skinny, And bo matter what I just couldnt gain wait, even after a year of eating fast food every day, was still skinny (I started taking behavioral pill and somehow those helped)
So literraly most boys problems
Are there any more onlyjayuses in the world 😊
Jayus is cute fr      Never gonna give you up Never make you cry Never gonna run around and desert you
Same
This is too accurate. I’m super skinny and I get comments about it so long.
I’m a very skinny person and this…people need to see this and UNDERSTAND WHAT WE, SKINNY PEOPLE, ARE GOING THREW- AND WHY I SHOP AT THE KID/YOUNG ADULT SECTION
I've always been skinny and my mom wouldn't let me sit in her lap 'cause my ass bones dug into her thighs too much
Not to disagree but those where some pretty swag moves
Skinny problems have nothing on fat problems. At the end of the day we all got problems.
Can’t dance is an everyone problem
Bro I’m jealous I wish I was skinny. Be grateful 😭😩
I don't think the reason you can dance is because your skinny...🤣
Word everyone is on about fat acceptance but I'm just here eating triple the amount my peers do and having these problems
I eat like as much as my fat brother, yet my metabolism stops me from gaining weight.
The dance part isn't a problem I'm medium size as a child and I'm still a child I can't dance
i feel your pain, i am 11 and weigh 63.4 pounds ._.
😂 the break in the wind comment though
Imagine being skinny at all 🥲🤌
Lol I had the same problems and then I started getting bigger out of no where and can't dance bc I could when I was younger😂😂😭
Me as a skinny af 14 yr old can fully understand the struggle
Well, take the advice. Go out and eat some garbage. It's easy af to gain weight
Dude I feel all of these
Omfg it’s so true!!! I just hit 100 lbs and I still have these problems!!!
this is so true! I’ve been very skinny my whole life and all of these are so accurate!
I don't know if I should lose weight now that I saw this
Yes!
I get all of these problems but people still call me fat 🙄
I’m can feel you also.🤣😭. Everyone says I only eat ketchup for food
"I can't dance" Come on, you dance better than me.
This is to true
I'm 75 kg and considered skiny as fuck.. and I get the same things... Problems of being tall IG..
I feel this in my soul
My grandmother used to tell me how I would just drop in the floor dead at the dinner table because I was so skinny.... I was like 7🙃🙃
Wym you can’t dance that was AMAYZIN
Honestly I just ignore people that say “do you even eat?”
As someone who grew up fairly chubby as a kid people would ask “how many months?” as if it was funny, or “go on a diet.” I didn’t even grow up that fat, I’m just a little chubby. I’m nit exactly skinny but I’m not fat either. I also have big boobs and curves so people keep commenting that it’s bad and I should have smaller ones, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO????????? GO OHT AND USE A SHRINK RAY ON THEM??? I really don’t get it. It hurt my feelings as a kid but I just played along. Not fun. I feel ur pain.
“Can’t dance” Literally shows the best dances ever
Fr society is so rude to skinny people then tries to justify it by saying that we’re the beauty standard. Well clearly not
Oml I thought you were a guy the whole time I’ve been watching you lol I love your vids the picture that I finally realized you were a girl was the on with you in a bathing suit
Fucking thank you. No one ever tries to empathize or be relatable to skinny people because we're "the norm" or the beauty standard. We go through shit, just like everyone else and I wish it was acknowledged more
I love this youtuber
I use to be short and skinny still am And kids used to randomly pick me up I’d ask the to stop never would pat me on the head it was miserable
Just get a kids belt lol thats what I do-
Apparently I’m so skinny I make up 5% of people my age.
Do you know what was worse than society doing that to you, your siblings
Jokes on u im fat(kinda?)
Oh my god it gets so cold
Nobody who is tall can dance and look good doing it...
God I wish I’m fat
“U should go ona diet” that is also fucked up to say to a 10 year old
True me too 😂😂
People: "go eat wtf im scared you'll get swepped away by the wind"   Me:"geee i haven't thought about dat"😒
Yes me too I’m am 13 years old and 63 pounds
Yeah dude, my best friend of 25 years has had diabetes since he was 14. He's never been able to put on weight, even enough for a pancreas/kidney transplant. He's been doing dialysis for about 2 years now, imagine being skinny and having those issues. I think you're lucky and it could always be worse...
"Go poke new holes into it" is super accurate lol
I agree, I’m skinny aswell
Nice dance moves🤣 i’m not even that skinny and I still don’t know how to dance so you’re not alone🥲
My skinny ass feels your pain...
I’m skinny too,it’s true. I way 61 pounds- when I go to friends house or something the first things I hear are: “I can see ur bones” or “how do u survive ur so skinny?” Or “wow ur skinny-“
That last one is normal
Telling someone that they need to go eat something cuz they're too skinny is the same amount hurt that someone gets when you call them fat
I think you look great the way you are. I personally love the dance moves
Says can’t dance then dances better than Michael Jackson
I think the last ones just you
Onlyjayus is a past coworker of mine from a different dimension. Working at an autoshop she was short and definitely not skinny, same face just more meet on it... no no not in that way, she wasn't straight at all (first time i met her i didnt know if she was a guy or not)
Fact.
Everybody in the comments: talking about how they want to gain weight  Me: unless you have a legitimate medical condition it is much healthier to be underweight than overweight. And trust me, it’s much worse when you have a doctor lecturing you about how you need to lose weight than it is to have a doctor tell you need to eat more. Nobody will change my mind
Girl u a better damcer than me i look like a fish out of water
Ik it hurts
Anothe thing, when people say “go eat a burger” yeah cause 1 burger will give me 30 pounds of weight! Oh yeah if that would happen don’t you think we would have done it by now?
Im skinny but am i the only one who can sleep in the night that can handle the cold kinda strong or weak i dunno but i actually dont use blankets when im cold i vibrate to keep me warm it dont work but i crouch and vibrate to keep me warm(i am wierd)
Was skinny when I was in junior high but football and puberty hit me like a truck. I was about 5'8 160 in middle school. My senior year I was 5'10 205 my wrists are still small and my hands are wide so it looks so much worse
Still better than being mocked, harassed and ridiculed into oblivion for having any grabbable skin anywhere 🤷‍♀️
“I can’t dance” you can dance better than me, that’s for sure
So true especially the comments
Bro being tall and skinny is like annoying
My friend also has this problem but the only promblem is, and i dont kniw why, she cant gain weight. She probably eats the most out of all of us but still has this problem. But she does to 18 hours of gymnastics a week so that might have something to do with it but im not sure
So is he/she a boy or a girl
Same I am a skinny person and I have had all these problems
LMAOOO YES EXACTLY ALL OF THESE. The belt one especially is so embarrassing 😂   Also it's scary how blunt ppl can be to skinny ppl. Like its so rude and confidence shattering when full grown adults will start bodyshaming an 8 year old child then laugh about it with the other adults around...
Have you had a supportive family?
the way I relate to this :') my parents love to comment about how skinny I am, stick was even my nickname at some point. also, I hate how my relatives feel the need to stuff me with food, I met a relative I've never met before and they forced me to eat more food because i look too skinny.  also, 'you're so skinny, do you even eat food' comment simply annoys me, i simply try to brush it off now
Wait your a girl huh well I guess that’s why they say never guess a book by it’s cover
Same I have been so skinny
I cant run. Under 18 and I'm fucking 236 pounds, Last I checked. I need to fuckin stop.
Can you make one for short people....I mean, even tho youre not short.....but still 👉👈
Number 5 is definitely worse for people who are overweight
Bro I think I am neither fat nor skinny but MY GOD DAMN FEET AND HANDS ARE LITERALLY BONES AND ARE ALWAYS COLD Is that just me???  Yea? Ok.
As a skinny person I just get clothes that fit
I’m fat as fuck but can relate to everything except the bruises
Same
What kind of f***ing dancing is that
I Wish i was skinny
I KNOW!!!!!! We don’t have it easy.
Beautiful
I was really skinny too, although I worked out and started to do it as my daily routine and now I am actually not as skinny as I used to be. Of course working out may not work for everyone who is skinny. But it is amazing to do it and also very healthy to do it :) just hope if anyone wants to work out, you can achieve it!
The world is full of those who don't want to dance, and those who will try to make those people dance.  And you better believe that I don't give in because my dancing must be much worse than Jayus dance moves... https://youtu.be/imBxYbHleSg&t=128s
OMG LIKE EVERYTIME A RELATIVE COMES OVER THEY ARE LIKE "omg I'm so scared to hug you I'm afraid I will snap you in half" or "When are you going to start gaining weight??" And I just laugh along with it but I'm just a kid and it hurts
Your dance moves are on fiya
I’m skinny lol
I am also way to skinny and have those problems
I feel you. Especially with thoughts comments you mentioned 😥😥
I’m skinny and I feel this. The sitting part is true. And especially the clothes part. I have a belt for a kid because big ones don’t have enough holes.
God loves you all so repent and and be saved
Im not anorexic im just anorexic
Same
I have such a huge crush on her. ❤
My cousin told me eat something literally today, we FaceTimed because they’re in Turkey, and whenever I go there all of my relatives say that I’m so skinny
i also very skinny and clothes dont actually fit me..WHEN THEY SHOULD >:( its quite sad so i have to get 2 sizes smaller that my actual  age group
I'd definitely say you can dance
Ok, here's the deal.. I give you some of my weight, and you give me some of your dancing skills.. what do you think?
Same
Omg so relatable
The belt on is relatable 🤣😑
Ik it’s so annoying I’m really skinny
I Was Skinny Once But Now Im Semi-Fat
I feel like I'm skinny on the sides but the Middle where my tummy is I just feel like I like have a chubby belly 🥺
They even call me crackhead its aweful
As a skinny person, I relate to this completely
Dummy thick = Cushion
You cant dance be me fat sike dont be you can dance not even one move
Im going to be honest, she dances faster then me😬
You dance better than me  TvT
I am very well-insulated, but I'm still cold all the time (typing this from a fuzzy blanket)
Yes me too Jayus
Nah those dance moves fresh as hell ngl
I know how that feels
The laying one is so true! If I lay on my back on the floor it’s very uncomfortable due to my tail bone and my ribs always bruise. And yes, I’m always cold af
As a person who eats so much and you can still see my ribs and bones these are all true
Omg now i finaly i know onlyjayus is a girl. Edit. Or not i still dont know
Lol 😂 the dancing got me lol
Fucking almost 20 and I still hear “gotta get some meat on your bones”… thanks Linda, it’s been 13 years I’ll keep trying that
How do you block someone from appearing on your page
So relatable- 💀💀
I relate to all of this
I feel for this because I’m literally a twig. I’m super insecure about my arms and can’t do anything about it to bulk up. I burn energy very quickly
I used to be 98 pounds until 16 and then went to 210 pounds now at 21. I know about the belt thing, I remember being skinny and being called so, all the problems she mentioned. But none speak of the abolosute shit I’ve experienced being overweight.
I'm not skinny except for my legs  and I suffer from most of this stuff
how you get more weight? i have the same "problem"
Feel ya bro. Not the dancing part tho I can rock the place
All things fit for me cuss I'm fucking skinny my whole life  too still  not at a totally healthy wait but the cold part isn't true at all cuss I'm never cold I wear fall clothes mid winter
I've never related to a video so much in my life.
Hay, tou dance better then me come on
"I can't dance!"  I think that's a personal problem...
I sadly don’t own a belt so every time I wear a skirt I have to safety pin it 👍🏼
Why tf have I just got 6 “skinny people problems” videos in a row
I have been chubby all my life!!
EHHHHHHH 😭😭😭I’m so skinny 😭😭😭😭😭
You weren’t kidding when u said u can’t dance😂
You can dance better than me 😂😂
Yea you dont know overweight problems
But my Question is…. How old are u?
You got good dance moves girl
I can totally relate with this lol
thank god i’m fat as fuck
i'd love having a gf like you...
If brown up with these comments and still get them
What are you talking about those moves are fire
Of to litel veit
Your so funny
Very true also ur right my butt does hurt when i frakking sit
My frinde  olmost died
Go to Africa and you'll no
Jayus.. can I buy you dinner? Lol
This is hilarious but I totally get it.
Relatable
What do you mean your dancing skills are AMAZING
I have been really skinny for my whole life too,and all of these things have happened to me.
As a skinnyyy girl I agree like straight up I CANT. SIT WITHOUT MY BUT BONES FEELING just…HJASHJSJDJD
Oh noodle arms. What are we going to do with it
I relate to this so much hahaha
I know
The sitting down one isnt bc you're skinny, it's just bc of the placement of your tailbone. I have a phat rear end according to my family and it hurts like hell sitting down for too long.
Im made fun of constantly for being too skinny but i understand everything except for the being cold thing, im always hot. Another problem i have is all my bones stick out, shoulder blades, elbow, knuckles, ribs, they wre all visible
That's just why I stay fat
I've never had cold problems but I've had plenty of people tell me to put some meat on my arms. Now I have a potbelly and still my arms are skinny af. I've always had issues putting weight on my limbs.
I don't have experience with being underweight or skinny, it's always been the opposite for me. Though, all of these problems are the same but different circumstances (apart from sitting and lying down)
This is so true when ever I see a relative they always say you got skinner or your so thin you need to eat more it's so annoying...
My life:
Killer dance moves
Really tho
BRO THIS IS ME!
I thought it was normal for sitting to hurt    i am really fat but ive never really had a butt like to the point i end up with saggy butt no matter what and i always have a sew all the lags and but parts to my swimsuits and leatrds.
Honestly best moves ever
Me who eats meat 90% of the day and is still skinny
Nah bro being skinny don’t mean you can’t dance you just grew up with the wrong kind of white people
Yeah I know those problems, it sucks more cuz your tall so you can’t dance
How the hell they 6’2  and 145 lbs 🤨
I used to be skinny and people used to be like: Your so skinny do you eat ? Me: no bitch i live on photosynthesis type shit🙄 Like people are annoying as fuck what does me being skinny has to do with you just go live your fucking life before i end it or something 🤣
Your belt doesn’t fit.. wear another one. Oh? That doesn’t work? But kids clothes.
Better dancing than me
As a fellow (100 lb) skinny person, I can say that everytime I go to a restaurant, I always get cold! And my family doesn't feel the cold. So it's just me! Also, I barely fit in other clothes because it would either be too large, or too short. And the ones that do fit are ones that I daily wear. And I can't dance!  Glad to see I'm not the only one that have issues
The last two are the most accurate, can confirm, am skinny
Nah your dance move are 🤚🤚 Better than mine lmao
I can confirm
I feel you! I'm like ridiculously skinny!!! And its annoying cause I eat SOOO much but I never giant any weight. IM A WALKING TALKING SKELETON!💀
Yes
Well since your tall I would expect you to be skinny
I can relate to ALL of these
“Can’t dance “   Michael Jackson :😐
Same i have been skinny my Whole Life  even though I eat a lot of meet no no no not that type of meet
The worst part for me is when i sit in a chair with no cushioning on the back, it hurts my spine so much.
HAHA, I AM FAT!
Copped every bit of this my whole life, dare anyone to say it to me now. Snap u all in half
My uncle keeps asking when I'll get fatter
I have all these problems (expect people say I'm too skinny) , but I'm not skinny.
Ong only the skinny knows
So fucking relatable.been the same weight since high school....23yrs later
Not being able to dance is a white perish problem
Rather be skinny than an obese person who has one foot in the grave.
I’m so skinny
Is she really complaining about being skinny, try being fat, it kills self-esteem.
The belt one is so annoying As a kid people (including my parents and relatives) comment on how skinny I am
I’m on the skinnier side and I’ve been dancing for 6 years, I think that’s just a you problem
Bb saaammme I've had ppl go up to me and to the thumb to middle finger circle around my wrist maaaaannnny times a week
I'd love it if people told me to eat a burber all the time. Like YES PLEASE!
I can agree to every one of dem but the last one cuz look at micheal Jackson that man skinny and can dance
So true
Sooo right.
I can relate to that last one
I have a skinny problem to
Yo same
Definitely relatable, especially the ass bones😭😭
IM SKINNY):
U can’t dance wait till u see me
I can relate
That's so true
I can relate to all of this
I eas really skinny and thought i eat too kuch and nothing worked.then i learned to count calories and i realized that what i thought was too much was barely enough to mantain my bodyweight. Im still skinny but now i know why.
Same but I’m still skinny as fuck
I relate so much with this. I just can't gain weight. I weigh 125 pounds as a 6 foot person. I am so underweight. Everything Jayus said is exactly the same stuff that has happened to me
Bruh my PE teacher told me I need to eat a few more pork pies lmao
Dancing is a you problem
Me I'm so skinny and I'm a kid and like same
Skinny forever
I'm skinny an d im always warm
i used to poke holes in my belt bc there wasn't enough for me.  i was still heavier than jayus
Make another twerking video
I wish i could relate to this
Honestly she dances like me
⟟ make fun of my brother for being skinny but not mean way just when we’re poking fun at each other so he know the struggle
My ass hurts like even in car so 😂
I don’t like it!!!!!!!
I can’t gain wait either
What a pain in the ass this thing is
This is me
i have problems 1-4 but i still look very over weight and i do weight much. i just have all the fat at my boobs(bad) and at my thighs, which means i have the bad things a skinny person has while also having fat person Problems. its the worst. i get the bruises, can't sit long, am cold fast and my pants always slip and belts never fit. but i also need bigger pants because of the thighs which makes them slip even more, i need bigger and more pricey bras and people always tell me to loose weight.
#6 was a you proplem
Hit the jig
Everyday ppl say i look skinny but i weigh like 5kg more then them
Bruh same
So true
Me to
dont forget lying on your back on a hard ground and obliterating your tailbone in pe.
It’s relatable I’m about as thick as a toothpick
I’m super skinny, (40 kilos while most people my age are around 60 or 70 if their buff) but no one ever asked me if I eat, mainly cuz I’m always wolfing down food faster than your average American, I guess I just have super fast metabolism
i relate to all 😭
Im skiny tall and heavy. This vido is super relatable. And i have agresion Problems so don't Pis me of. Last Time somewone eine that i have almost schoked him to death. I Just pressed him against the wall. It was so satisfieing to watch him trying to ecape my grip around His throat.  He and His Friends couldnt do anything. Then i locker at my time scedule and saw that the teacher would be there in two in minutes. It was so funny sehing him schoke .He couldnt do anything. I could have just tigtend my grip a litle more to kill him... What satisfaction would it have Benn. Since then i always have a knife ready to stab somewone under the 4 rib of the left lung. They couldnt even Scream. Thats why i don't stab them . I want to hear them sufer.
I can personally agree with all of these especially the last one
Pros: dressed a slender man or a Xenomorph for 🎃.
That's why I think it's ok to be fat evolution of skinniness your warmer you can sit as much as you want like 4 hours on a bike uhhh you can lay down on the cold and it will fell much warmer you can lay on the floor but running sucks  so is showering since my face is round the soap with menthol in it keeps hitting my you know what lol and it hurts so yeah if your like average it's in between most the things idk lol
I agree with cold
What do you mean you can’t dance you can dance a whole lot better than me
I weight 79 pounds and have a high metabolism so gaining more weight is almost impossible for me at this point
Wow… being skinny… such a HUGE problem! Whoda thunkit?!
The cold is actually just a woman thing. Im 6ft 4, 190 lbs and my wife is always freezing and I'm just fine.
I have to punch 4 holes in most my belts.
All of these are in issue for me except the cold (I’m Canadian you get used to it)
I can agree with this
I have the same problem and everyone says I’m skinny but I don’t like it :(
This is basically the same for fat people your belt doesn’t fit? Just poke holes in it
Skinny people can dance you just aren’t trying to actually dance🥲😆🥲😅
I am also extremely skinny and underweight and alot of these are pretty true so yeah lol
Him: You can't dance  *Proceeds to dance*
I can relate soooo much
I have all of these problems
Skinny gang unite!!!!!
Ah yes, a new reason/excuse to not be able to dance
Can’t Relate 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Everything except for number 5 I can relate to, cause everybody is telling me where all the food goes
coming from a latin america family, i can’t dance either. and that’s a big nono if you want to date a latina
Ok I didn’t even notice you were skinny
Exactly
I'm still not on a healthy weight, but since last year it got a little better and it makes me fucking happy:)
Don’t worry, you’re not the only one who can’t dance. Not only skinny people can’t dance and skinny people can be good dancers too
This is why I hate  the world when I was skinny people use to tell me to eat some food now I have on a little wait people tell me to stop eating and kill myself  😒
Sorry Jayus but not even my self can blame the fact that I’m skinny on my horrifying dance moves…🤧😢
I'm glad to be chubby 🤣🤣
Most relatable vid I've watched in a long time
I am 13, ALL OF THIS HAPPENS TO ME BRUH
Same
as a fellow skinny person most of this is true to me
I understand the sitting alot its so painful
One time when I was like 9 years old an atletnative doctor (woman) told me I should be ashamed of myself for being skinny... I remember i got so mad  told her to piss off and left the room. She was fat af also
I used to be Skinny back when I was just bugs bunny, so I know how you feel
Well yeah… it’s nearly impossible for me to gain weight
One of my friends mum saw me and invited me over cause she thought I wasn't being fed
Got more moves than me tho
All true I can relate
1,3,4,6. Are my problem amd im skinny 😞
Wait what does dancing have to do with weight. And why did your last dance looked like a drowning penguin?
I cant gain any weight like im serious but my mom says that i should eat more even though i already do.
I relate to you one the point everything you said happens to me on the daily school home and everything
The fact that you stood on the sink without fearing the adhesive with give out 😂
The last clip is basicly me
I share every single one of these problems and all these things fucking suck
Same brother
I enjoyed watching Jayuses attempt at dancing  very much
I was super skinny for a while. I’m back up to a decent weight, but I lost a lot of weight. Like, 15 pounds in just over a week. Turns out I was in Diabetic Keto-Acidosis, which is what happens when your blood sugar gets too high as a result of undiagnosed diabetes. People would tell me to eat more, which was super terrible advice. It would only send my blood sugar higher and higher, making me even skinnier and more sick. I’m alright now, almost three years later.
Well, since I know All These struggles, I guess I'm a skinny Person trapped in a slightly overweighed body! 🤔😙
Thanks for reminding me
I feel you ..
I'd pick those over being my weight I think
So many people tell me I'm anorexic because of being so skinny, but I eat like a horse 24/7
I can't stop laughing🤣this isn't a insult
I have the same problem
The belt one though, I feel that.
I am 11 years old and I Waigh about 125ib
Yup I have a crush on you and I'm straight
I use to be very skinny till my doctor basically told my parents “Give that boy some fresh meat”  It helped a lot not and pretty much helped all the problems that everyone else is having.
Same, I’m 16 trying to eat more.
Wait until you hear what happens when we make a wrong move with our arms or legs.
Fuck that negativity.   You can dance just fine!!
Those dance moves were sick what are you talking about 🕺
You are wrong  You CAN dance
You can dance very well. Good job
These thing is happened to me as an kid and it hurt my mom and dad said stuff like that to me
Yes I’m a skinny person and my dad used to tell people I had to run around in the shower  to get wet and it was a good icebreaker but very embarrassing
You have these problems because you weigh 66 fucking pounds
Didn’t she say the n word
I have that same fricking probleme and i eat like for 2 or 3 people
That's dance is very great
I got used to being cold and “oH My g0D Do yOU EveN eAT.” NO SHIT ID BE DEAD IF I DIDNT
Thanks  for showing those pickers because i ben having a hard time telling if you were a boy or girl so because of your pictures I now know you are a girl so thanks a lot 😏😏😏🤨🤨🤨🙂🙂🙂
same here gurl😩
My only contribution to the world is skinny people should wear suspenders
Nice dancing:)
Ohhh, so it's not really my fault that I can't dance!
Same here. Gas it pros and many many cons
Glad I am the not the only one who dances horribly.
When I was 12 my parents had told me someone said then I was skinnier than normal AT 12 MONTHS
I once saw a video saying people that cant get fat might have a condition that makes you not have hearth problem (idk how true this is but im fairly sure i cant get fat i never was and i can eat a lot whenever i want)
Most relatable thing I’ve seen all day
Nikocado Avocado can relate
I have all thos problems
The one good thing about being skinny is your friend carry you when you don’t wanna walk
No You ArE tHe DaNcInG qUeEn At least compared to me lol
Jayus: "I can't Dance." *Proceeds to dance better than I can*
Relatable asf.
Why these are the same problem as being overweight?! I hate my body, i am so freackin fat
Wow I have never related to something more!!!
ITS ME
I'm 13 and I weigh 85 pounds. Is this normal?
Thanks s how my skinny af sister dances
better than being fat
It’s so true , Some times people call me a stickman
But like You dance better than me- i thought u slayed ngl
This is very relatable to me People would talk about my body same as me being a fast grower so people would comment "your so skinny go eat something" or "damn you have a bigger chest than me and your only 9?" Its fucked up to say that to a kid and you should never say that to a kid -Thank you and have a nice day/night/evening or morning
i’m 62lbs in the 6th grade and people in the hallways always tell me to bend my leg because i supposedly will “snap in half” i have maybe four people that’s don’t make fun of me for it. (my boyfriend, and my 3 besties)
I can relate to all of this
I'm 11 and skinny as crap and yes these are true.....My fake friends say that i need to eat more so when ever i stay the night at there house they feed and feed me in till i can't eat anything else and they think I'll get fat and I'm still skinny!!
Wtf? Fast food dosent give some meat on your bones. Go home and eat your Moms food and youll Gain some weight
Me being skinny and relating to all of them BUT the not being able to dance
Try 400 lb and my only bony spot is where a bike seat goes I've parked my car and written a bike for a year
This I can 100% agree with
Bruh same
Wait your a girl 😧
And when you fall......
I have the opposite problem I'm only 12 and ppl have told me stuff like "u should eat less"or they see me eating and say "dont u wanna be skinny" I try to defend my self but they say its "disrespecting ur elders" or "we are just saying this for UR own good" like IM AWARE THAT IM NOT THIN I LOOK AT MY SELF EVERY DAY🙄 my teacher saw that I gave my bsf a little of my lunch bc she didn't bring much so my teacher said "u don't wanna eat that? That's probably why Ur a little fat" idk why society is like this and I hope it gets better
I am so skinny
Bruh I’m fat as shit I wish I was skinny
I feel this
Somebody who understands the pain
Honestly I dealed with alot of people calling me skinny hah and when your an Asian and ur grandma and mom forces u to eat-
Yes. Am skinny too and those are real facts
Jayus….why do you have on your shoes inside??
And you assume fat people can dance?
It's not a skinny problem, it's because you a lesbian
I’m plus size but I still hate it when anyone gets shammed for there body. It’s hurts, so can y’all just chill out. We all have the same organs
Skinny af. All my life Literally can see ribs through my skin if I stretch Had Five Guys for two whole weeks straight, no sign of weight gain Both blessings and a curse 😂
I can relate
At least you aren’t fat
I don't get very cold and I'm skinny I was in 6 digress with feeling a little cold
my dad thought that i didn't ate in a year... he saw me how much i eat in a DAY ... im 40 kg and im 13. and all you have said IT'S RELATABLE.
I can understand I'm skinny as flip but i don't feel cold i infact feel really warm
Saaaaaaaame
So I have such a fast metabolism and what not that i cant retain weight from food or anything, I can confirm that all this stuff she said is very true
My Belt has far to many holes now 😥
Sorry to break it to you but the last one was a you problem
I'm 5'10 and only weigh 108 pounds so yes this is true
I think u we’re supposed to put “can”
My parents always said lions would ignore me cuz I had no meat on my bones
Is he a boy or girl??
you don't have to preach about having skinny girl problems anybody that's been with a skinny girl knows that shit hurts when pushing up on it
But you still look good
This is so relatable- I get called all these-
Every time i go to play a game i have to stand every 20 min or so cuz my butt hurts so much.
Are you sure that not being able to dance is just you
I can’t remember a time when I’m not cold. 6’6 and skinny as fuck
But i am fat AND cold all the time, do I need to be even heavier?
Dude I’ve hated that I hate having to explain to people that I just have a fast metabolism there for I don’t get fat
Yo wtf same Mainly the being cold one Fucking hell I live in England so when it’s cold I don’t want to get up. At all.
Are you a girl?
The first photo tho-
When she started dancing i died laughing 😂
A-FUCKIN-MEN!
Oh nice thanks for the excuse for my trash dancing. Also the go eat a burger thing really was fun while it lasted. My grandma decided I was to skinny and just piled on heaps of food I loved onto a shopping list and during Sunday brunch I ate like a king. Sadly that stopped since my metabolism is so fast it did barely anything so we went back to normal lol
Love her dance moves 😂
All of this is true for me and I especially hate getting cold and having a sore ass. But it is better than being obese and having heart disease.
Then when you sit weird and than the the teachers get mad at you for sitting the wrong way
Hahaha but there’s more better things  than bad things about being skinny. You can eat anything you want and never get over weight. You can run fast. You can easily run through a crowd. You can fit through almost any place you want. And (my personal favorite) you can get money from people by betting you can lock your own self in a head lock and still have plenty of room to breath. Lol.
Nobody can dance at this point
Stickbugs lives are sad
its much harder when ur fat :/
I till 4th grade.. I was 48 pounds, and the doctors were really worried about me, now I’m a freshman and I weigh 110 pounds, and because of when I was little I have problems with my body, and body image
That last part 🤣🤣🤣
I can TOTALLY relate.. I’m 12 and 70 pounds. Very. Skinny.
Facts
Can't dance she says  Proceeds to dance better than 90% if the population
In high school I had to do like 65 sit ups. I had bruises on the back of my hips, my spinal cord, and shoulder blades for a week. It hurt to lay down.
1 to 1, everything except the last one...  Edit: i say this because i was once nicknamed "sir bones" for a very obvious reason.
I'm a fat boi
I CANT dance me: not many people can that’s not skinny people problems 😂
I cant dance to
And i thought those things happen to everyone Only me ok
I can relate to this! I can’t dance, am always cold, and have to poke holes in my belts!
Still cute though 😜
okay maybe i am ok with being chubby
Ay those dance moves are sick af
Ayo someone call an exorcist
True
I can agree
Same problem I can wear two  hoodies in 108 degrees I'm told to eat me but can't the much
Your killing those dance tho
Yep, besides the clothes, all of my clothes are to small cause I’m tall
Actually it seems you can dance
“I CAN’T DANCE” **Proceeds to fuckin kill it on the dance floor**
She's Sexy as, I love skinny.
I’m skinny asf
I heard if you drink a Ensure it’s a drink that makes you full so you don’t eat and add fat to the body
Oh you can dance jayus 😊   You just suck ass at doing it
I love the dance
Dude I’m the opposite like I’m a bit over average weight not very much but not like super little and I have the exact same problems.
Bro I hade the same problem but I've finally gained com weight lol
Mlm
Im fat as fuck soooo
Hmm. I'm not skinny But I'm always cold. Wth
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO GETS IT THANKYOU
OMG I've been 55-58kg since I was 15(21now) and I would do anything to gain some weight
My metabolism was so fast Thats why i constantly ate mc donalds and junk food so i would  not be called twiggy or stitch ... im a bit chubbier now my metabolism slowed a bit but still fast ... i take any fat joke as a compliment
It's called celiac disease
I look like a twig 😃
Her: "I can't dance" Also her: throws some sick moves
Are you a boy are girl
The qorst it when the watch rips a few haurs
As someone who has been fat my whole life and never knew how skinny people are treated, I’ll just not judge skinny people. Btw to person reading this, you are beautiful!
I fell that
I was at a restaurant with some family members and my grandpa asked what I ordered so I told him and he was like “Wow you got something, it doesn’t look like you eat at all” I awkwardly smiled and my mom laughed, I was very uncomfortable at the dinner 🤨
Bruh same
I have the same problem thers a 100   Plates under desk and im not getting  Fatter
Lol finally something I can  relate to
Bruh I sat on the toilet and got bruises on my back after a while
I actually have a problem where I can’t gain weight so I weigh way less than everyone else. So one day this kid walked up to me and asked me if I ate or I was starving myself. I was like YES I STARVE MYSELF TO BE SKINNIER!! I literally weigh 80 pounds and I’m in 6th grade. But I’m tall and muscular!
Bro this is so true especially the ribs and ass thing!
I have also been skinny all my life and heavily relate to this video 😅
Sooooooo tru
THIS IS ME. FINALLY SOMEONE TALKS ABOUT THESE
Yes this is so bad I hate it😫
Pretty sure not being able to dance isnt a skinny problem, its just a problem most people have
No such thing as skinny problems. Just deal with it
Saaammmeee
I’m 101 ponds and I’m 11 and she’s 64 pounds
I also have this problem, especially the society one, I get it mentioned at least once a day, and I always wear a really baggy sweater
Your dancing moves are way better than mine and I'm not even skinny 🤣🤣
My body is not thick but not fat and it’s more then average but it’s also very thin so it’s really weird
I’m so skinny that me and my grandma had to hold onto each other to stay up when the wind was particularly fast one day, or we would have both been blown away
I only have sitting and laying problems
Also when random people used to just walk up and put there fingers around ur wrist saying, "wOwWw iTs So SkInNy"
Wait did you play volleyball
4. Belt struggles lmaoo too accurate😂
those are the exact problems (or most of them) that plus size people or just not traditionally skinny people deal with.
WHO THE HELL CAN DANCE????
Those dance moves are great
I feel this
I am 6'5" and 141lbs soaking wet. The comments are the worst pain ever... Everyone gets offended when you call them fatass but twig and skinny, or string bean are just socially normal. Forgot about walking barefoot and bruising your heels on the ground.
The dancing one is a you problem
Same jayus same
I understand this I’m very skinny
I way 75.6 and im 13 you can see my heart through my chest as it beats
I uses to be a little over 90 pounds I’m finally over 100
Sadly, even big girls can't dance, so we are in the same boat there...
Bro I’m skinny af and I have the same problems like this is relatable
Getting bullied and criticized as a kid made me grow a back bone. Let's bring bullying back
When I looked at her scale I thought it said 66 pounds and I freaked out, but if it's 66 kg then it's the equivalent to 145 pounds, that's a more accurate weight unless Jayus is suffering from extreme anorexia
The poking holes in the belt is very relatable
the most embarrassing time of my life was when me and my dad had to go buy me some smaller clothes since none of my others fit because i was so thin. he then had to buy me like 5 belts and punch new holes in all of them....and even worse—i realized that my shaky hands, exhaustion, mental overload, sensitivity to light and loud sounds, lack of appetite, memory loss, and severe weakness was because i had been starving, dehydrated, sleep deprived, hadn’t left my room much and always left the lights off, and hardly talked to anyone. it’s mainly because all i do is sit in my room all day and read. whenever i really stop to think about what i’d eaten/drank that day, i’d most likely say something along the lines of: “i had a cup of water for my adhd med, then i forgot breakfast—and i didn’t feel all that hungry at lunch time...i kind of forgot to get a snack so i finished my book.....then i started this cool new book called, ‘the many shades of blue’ but that’s besides the point....i think i had like a cup of yogurt around dinner time and for dinner i had two slices of pizza.” you can probably tell why everyone was so concerned. but anyway—yea, being skinny sucks—i’m working on it. bouncing back to a healthier lifestyle(eating more/drinking at least 8 cups of water a day, getting outside more often, being more social) is difficult, but it’s worthwhile! :>
dang that dance crack tho
I didn't realize that thin people had these problems till I lost a lot of weight people could just pick me up, made me feel kinda vulnerable. Yeah didn't realize those were issues and it's sucks especially the "wow you're so thin" in a mean judgemental way.
I think the last one is a bit of you problem
@jayus ur not alone im 6'1 and less than 100lb
You can’t dance because you can’t dance not because your short but I agree
I feel weird I'm so skinny I can see my ribs all the time
What do you mean you can’t dance I can’t dance
Thin people problem, rich people problem, powerful people problem, being a literal god problems. I understand
You’re not wrong about the sitting one
didn't have the money to buy much food last year and it effected my body terribly... i now know that walking barefoot on solid ground is terrible 😅 love to those struggling with weight! you'll reach your body goals, i promise :)
I now how you feel
Emphasis on the always cold part!!!
I feel u
For me this is insanely relatable 😭
LITERALLY MEEE
U can dance ur just not good😂😂😂
I’ve always been a very skinny guy, and a week ago I found out I have a nerve disease. Basically it’s impossible to gain weight.  People always assume being skinny is so easy, but you can’t do anything about it.  Here’s an example of how fast my metabolism is:   If I ate well the day before, my belt would fit perfectly in the morning, but towards the end of school, I’d have to keep pulling my pants up.  Lying on my back, is like laying on steelspikes.  I never really knowing what I can lift, or pick up.  If you’re fat there are infinites of ways to change it, but when you’re skinny there is nothing.
Lol I'm 5ft4 and I'm 10 and can dance idk why tho
OmG I UNDERSTAND
I have this exact problem
I have the same problem
I totally understand
Sit ups that's a  11th century torture method I can even do one without my tailbone being in pain
🍟Wow mean comments To You?! Your Beautiful 🍋
even worse if you’re extremely tall and skinny. like, I’m 6’3” (believe it or not) and I’m extremely skinny, everyone’s like “oH mY gOsH yOu ShOuLd Be A mOdEl” like n o
Why does being skinny make you a bad dancer? Genuinely curious?
I feel like I'm overweight but I have most of these problems. Maybe I'm just self conscious of my body
Finally someone spitting the facts revealing our daily struggles!! ❤️❤️❤️ Each one is accurate
I went from being slightly overweight and my mom always talking about how I'm gonna end up getting fat when I ate, from only eating one meal a day and just making the people around me feel insecure and me feeling more horrible now and missing the old days but I physically cannot eat as much as I used to nor do I have the will to. It kinda fucking sucks. (For context, the rest of my family is "fat")
Omg that’s the exact same think as me
This is so true I can relate
I eat the most in my family and am STILL skinny
You get cold because low BMI and low muscle mass.
I…I get cold…I can’t dance either….ha, I new my doctor was wrong…
I can relate
I have never felt so related to then right now!
I agree with this statements she made more than anything I am 6’6 and skinny pants are hard to find shirts the arm length is hard to fine door frames are a problem The only one I could relate someone to is the cold I always like the cold. I give this 6 stars for being real
I caught onlyjays in 4K She Wore a bikini   me as a bi:lowkey…
I can’t dance either so yea🥲
Ok thank you for pointing out the chair thing it really starts to hurt after a while
That last one is a you problem 😂
I don’t know what she was talking about her dance moves are snooth
I’m anorexic
I have twins for my best friends and they are skinny and constantly get comments of them being weak and skinny and they are. Called a twig
THIS IS WHY I CANT DANCE..also being called a toothpick is not a compliment. TY
I’m not skinny but that can’t dance one is a whole mood right there-
Hey I Know how you feel 😭💀... And I'd eat like crazy but I'm 110lbs.. 2 years ago I was 120lbs. I can't wear any watches. Clothes are too fat if they are long enough. My normal temperature is 85°F.. I get goosebumps at 75, even with a hoodie. But I'm perfectly fine outside when it's exactly 100°F and I'm wearing a black hoodie and black sweatpants. Oh, actually, even when it's in the 90s outside, I'm just fine till I take my jacket off and I feel shivers down my spine.. Too much😐
It’s funny because I’m 5/10 and way 150
Thant me it so hard I'm always on the skinny side 😭
Ok SHES A GRIL
I have the same problem as her-t0 the person down there
No one can dance
Relatable
Lol when you hear skinny cry about being skinny
Ah yes, I share the same problems, especially the insulation one
The dancing lmao
Also bracelets never fit as a kid
I would know
I’m skinny to and this is sooo relatable
Agreed.
Sameeeeee
You look like a guy when you dance
Hahah, all of this happens to me
Honestly, if your skinny build muscle if your fat lose that fat and gain muscle 🐸
Im a boy, 5'5" and weigh 100 pounds I totally understand and those comments about being "too skinny/small" do get annoying after a while. The amount of times ive been picked up by people bigger than me and called a baby is astronomically high rip
Can't dance cause I'm skinny. My friend Jaden who dances like his life depends on it.AND HES SKINNY
Is it just me or did you just find out she’s a girl     This didn’t change my mine about watching her I still think she is a good YouTuber 😊
Me: She just described me
That’s me
I have the exact same problem u can legit see nah bones fr💀
Ye totally same
That dancing one is a lie I’m pretty fat an I can’t dance
I can agree with all of this including the not being able to dance.
I am skinny for life #SkinnyForLife
I'm skinny and this 100% true
Fat people problems:I'm ugly
I totally get that so much. Except for the part about dancing lol bc I’ve been dancing for 10 years and I do pointe and a lot of people always tell me that I’m such a beautiful dancer so yea but yea I get that
I’m really f*****g skinny and I always have. But I’m really good at danceing, but that’s probably cause I’ve been doing it since I was 2!
Yeahhh people be making fun of you for being skinny but it’s not right to say anything if they’re fat lol. Then when you try to say they’re both body shaming the person tries to explain why its less messed up to make fun of a skinny person
It's better dancing than I could ever do 😐
This video makes me fell ok with being a chubby
Ok I am fat but I can't dance you're not alone
This is super accurate
I relate to the last one the most
I am skinny as hell and can't dance either lol.
Omg I can totally relate!!! People have said to me to eat more it’s not like that’s it Bcs my parent were skinny I’m not skinny Bcs I don’t eat it’s just annoying.
The moment if you eat more then every person saying it to you but you still skinny
JAYUS NO, im skinny af but am never cold
I'm skinny af and I can dance. Loser get better coordination. 5 head
You look like the type of person to vote for Biden ngl
This dude seems excited about something
I Just look at a Burger and i weight 2 kilos more
The last one is not gust a skinny parson problem😂😂
That’s better dancing than I can do
Literally me in 3rd grade 😭. I just wanna say..                I SWEAR TO GOD IF U MEASURE MY WRIST AGAIN WITH UR FINGER I WILL FIND YOU (lol sorry)
I completely understand. I'm the same way. I'm 16 yo, 97 pounds and I'm 5'7
So you have the dancing skills of Elaine Benes
I'm a very muscular skinny for my age and my wrists are twigs so whenever someone tells me I'm unhealthy I just take my hoodie off
669 pounds
LMAO I can't get past 81.4 lbs help
I might be skinny soon cause my mom has a horrible job that doesn't pay her enough to last till the next paycheck so I have to go hungry till she get paid
*me who was born chubby and stayed that way until I cracked down on it last year* : Uhh... YEAH! I totally understand your struggles.. *Fakes a shiver*
I was skinny as a kid and my mom told me to get meat on my bones and I loved when she said that because it always gave me an excuse to buy food 😋
Lucky I’m overweight af
I can't dance, was super accurate. As a skinny person no matter how I try I look like some kind of tree whenever I dance, I hate that
No one likes you racist
You're the best dancer I have ever seen
Same my ribs pop out laying down like that and my spine pops out I get cold 🥶 as fu**
This made me realize that shitty chairs don't hurt everyone's ass
Fax
Can relate
Man I feel this too much lol
And ain't much better on the other side of the scale either buddy. Same problems really just polar opposite. You can't get warm, I can't get cold.. hurts when you sit? At least you fit in the chair. Can't find clothes that fit? OMG I've never had that problem before... 😒
Thank God that u got food I can barely by my self a peace of bread
🤣🤣🤣🤣
YES GIRL I FINALLY FOUND OUT WHY IM ALWAYS COLD BECAUSE IM ✨SkInY✨
Eyo im fat as shit and i still cant dance
As a person who can’t fricking gain weight this is relatable except I can dance
You’re a loser
SAME
I feel you...I've been skinny since I was 3,hell I'm still skinny as f*ck now
YES!! I’m built like a god damn stick, and sitting down as a stick hurts for long periods of time, another reason I hate school
Is it bad that I’ve had every single one of these problems
So ... Well how DOES one achieve a healthy weight? *Asking for Myself. Im 29 and still cant figure out how to gain weight. I eat 3-5 times per day and no snacks like chips or soda 😭😭😭
The last one is a white thing 🤣
ITS THE TRUTH
Every thing she saying is so incredibly true
Jayus: I can't dance Me who is a walking toothpick: bitch that's a you problem
Being big also has its problems too just say so we both need to find like a middle line fat people and skinny people
you are a god dancer omg
Your not even skinny ur a perfect size but i am skinny im trying to get in better shape
Same but I can’t get to a healthy wait and my friends would say I’m like paper 📄
I have that problem
My step dad is underweight and has been for years, and we've joked many times about wanting to trade. He can't gain, I have a hard time losing. Hang in there. As long as you feel healthy, you're the right weight for you <3
I can’t gain weight so I sleep with like 59 blankets and the clothes part is soooooo true
I'd rather Have skinny man  problems than fat man problems right now
Girl same
i have the same problems but i’m super short to
So true
I'm not skinny and I also can't dance, must be genetic
I’m not at all skinny but whenever I want to eat something at least 2 people are going like, “don’t eat any of those chips, eat some salad!” “You shouldn’t eat that, go eat some broccoli” they take my food sometimes like I can’t control how my weight works I barely eat anymore but whatever…
Fat people problems:  You get too hot because of the insulation-  You have to add length to the belt Your clothes explode when you put them on And society, of course
You can’t dance cause you ain’t got no rhythm in you not cause you skinny, just got to get some rhythm in you and you good
Yes i can relate to this im very skinny i dont eat alot
Relatable
My whole life I have only had like 5% fat on my body and yes. All of these are true
Heard those comments my entire childhood and it really fucking messed with me. I'm the skinniest in my whole family and nonstop hear that, but I'm really not twiggy. Now a shake it off, but that took time and a lot of mental energy to not feel objectified.
I’m skinny and I can say she is saying straight facts
Ok, fat people problems. Most chairs are too small to fit in, if I lay down I may not be able to get back up, growing up everyone would tell me 'do you stop eating?' (Eventhough I ate the same shit they did when they did, and was more active than most of them). Clothed don't fit? Well can't go to a normal store to get new ones and where I have to shop charges X2 the normal price. Trust me you had it easy.
Oh yeah I know that I'm really skinny too 😒
I have the opposite of all of these issues, except... I still can't dance 😂
are you a girl or a boy
I’m glad this happened to you
Being over sized is completely opposite I’m always to hot
You forgot opening the window on a motorway and being sucked out the window. Seen it happen to a good friend of mine.
Wdym u totally can dance
To be honest with you I've had that same problem growing up
True true
I feel you, I was severely underweight my whole life, you could see my ribs and spine even when I wore shirts most of the time. It sucked, I bruised like a peach and constantly got comments from randoms and doctors about it. It sucked.
Girl same
I CANT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
I am like you I am only 9 I get cold when I have 5 jackets one
Just eat
I’m skinny too and all these problems happened to me
I'm skinny I can relate to all of this even the dancing
YEAH THATS EXACTLY WHY. That's it Jayus facts should be seen by my mother who thinks that these facts are cap. 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
DUDE I AM HELLA SKINNY AND U DESPISE IT
The whole bid is very  very berry true like everything in the video is right on point no detail was missed
I agree
It’s funny but I understand
My mum says go eat so much to me 😡😭😭😭why
This happens to me all the time I’m a bloody lanky noodle
Accurate
Bro being skinny is better then being fat like me… I have always felt insecure about it and now people are bringing it up more :( your lucky to be skinny (in my opinion) but! If you don’t like being skinny then it’s ok we all don’t like something about our body :)
My butt hurt
THAAaAAaaAaAAANKYOOoOOUUuU!!   People always ask me what I do to stay skinny, or what diet I’m on and other stuff LIKE A LOT!! And I’m just like WeLl HeRe We gO AgAiN!! IM JUST FREAKISHLY SKINNY And I explain the whole fast metabolism thing as well as having light bones too (plus I’m super tall on top of that so accentuates my skinnyness) so when someone picks me up with my super tall bony ass they almost always instantly look back at me with a whole lot o’ confusion as they did not expect I would weigh that little and feel as if I’m almost about to break!! But does anyone else have poor blood circulation cause I can’t sit on my knees, sit on my  legs, cross my legs, you name it!! because it’s bad for the blood flow and other stuff as well as the fact that I’ll always have my pinky toes purple and one or more that are pale white even when the temperature is average and I’m wearing TWO LAYERS OF BEDSOCKS UNDER MY SLIPPERS but the whole bruises things as well as everything else in this video is spot on!! I’m gonna end this here cause I would go on forever 😅
I've been told that I need to get some weight on me. Which yes. Being underweight is a somewhat bad thing. But telling me to gain weight is kind of uncalled for. But having to much weight can be problematic.
This is so true I'm also skinny as hell
Don't worry fat peope can't dance either
I still like u :)
Same here
I used to hate people’s comments…especially the doctors
Wdym you can't dance? Look at them moves
That's why I'm always cold also you can dance
I’m like, not super thin and I still can’t dance 😂 you literally look like me at homecoming
Relatable x
Is that why I’m always so damn cold ;-;
Im f###$ 12 and i am 114 kg i wish i was as skiny as you
Oh yeah you CAN dance
Honestly your lucky as fuck like dame am 12 and I weight 90
That dancing is amazing
As a six foot woman.. I really and truly felt this. Thank you Jayus
Being cold is so true. I used to be pretty fat and I loved the cold and was practically immune to it, but after I lost a lot of weight I am always so cold and I can never go out without a hoodie.
I love skinny tall girls 😍
FACTS
“i can make fun of myself but don’t you dare” lmao stfu
how im oppisite im fat
Ikr I’m skinny to
You dance better than me though
Ur nearly the same weight as me and im 9
Heck... your in the same issue as I am. I'm skinny and say under weight. 5'4 dude weighing 48kg age 20. Like people always tell me to eat more
Im coled
The dancing is just u
Try seeing your own ribs
I'm skinny to
Omg geez girl
I'm skinny aswell, and I can tell you all of these things are accurate. It sucks when people call us twigs or say "oh eat some more you need muscles and such".
Tf she is 67 pounds
This is entirely accurate
Me being skinny and short 😭
100% fact
I don’t think you can’t dance bc you’re skinny 😂😂😂🏳️
I've been skinny for my hole life and I eat a lot idk how though
I can’t dance either but welp.. I’m a teanager and i weight more then you… I uhm… I’m a little bit (much) over weight but that’s ok! I’m me your you be who you want to be and love yourself💕
About the cold thing, the reason my body is so skinny is because my metabolism rate is fucking faster than the speed of light and the energy released from my body digesting food that I ate which I also always have to eat constantly warms me up, I can walk around in sub-32°F Weather and literally not feel a thing. I know, It sounds like I'm trying to make myself sound cool, or rather the opposite but it's true
I'd get blown away if the wind was strong enough, doc says I'm pretty underweight have been for a whole probably and yes I needa poke new holes in like all my belts  It always upsets me when my pants don't fit also inner belts are great they ain't just there for decoration yo
Are you a boy or a girl
This is me I’ve been trying to gain weight for years and it’s impossible
Yes wtf that's right every time happens
Ya I'm skinny so I can't wear a normal belt...I have to wear kids belts
this is too accurate specifically the sitting laying and cold I'm in Florida and I'm in my house with a jacket and thick blanket and my ac isn't that low AND I'M FREEZING
Yep,that’s about right
Skinny person squad! :D. My doctor said that I’m too skinny for my age and weight XD
Like i am kinda heavy but like you can see my bones more than on another human XD
Nah the worst is when you want to lower the seat of your desk chair and nothing happens so you gotta hump the chair
There is problems on both side of the sectrum of weight
It's not that ya too skinny it's that you so dam lanky like dammm jack skellington ain't got shit on you
This used to happen but I was ashamed of being skinny so I ate more than become Chubby 😋
I think you dance wonderfully 😊
These are all so relatable plus have you ever tried useing a massage chair when your skinny, no? Well dont it fells like it’s ripping your bones out
Huh-  Well I guess I don’t have to be insecure thinking I’m skinny anymore
These are real its true and with pants im so skiny that my size is like impossible to find
what are u on about, that's dancing gurl
I have never heard anyone get made fun of for being skinny. Fat on the other hand...
I used to be skinny as a rake. Getting pleasantly plum sucks. You should cherish your skinny ass.
The being cold one is so fucking annoying I’m sitting under a cover now
how tall are you?
66lbs
When your over 6 feet and skinny you've reached lanky
You can dance dude.
You just put all my problems in one video
Best moves ever 😎
This is why i both hate and love being skinny
Yeah this is so me I'm honestly so glad you made this, people talk about obesity all the time but never about skinny Ness or whatever
I feel you.
Same 😩
Can’t relate😭
Bro same girlll
I don’t think not being able to dance is a skinny problem. Think that’s just a you thing
hit a corner and just no hip anymore
I seriously have the same problemsssss
I'm vegetarian and Bit Fat too ,When I tell them this They're shocked ,I reply them as ,"You're Non-vegetarian still you're thin as a Matchstick"
Pants falling down get a thing called suspenders
You're lucky you get to be skinny. I have to deal with being fat all the time.
So true cold cold everything is so true do
Someone told me to go eat a taco and called me a skinny bitch a few weeks ago, but how do I dumb down not gaining weight or not having meat on my bones to his tiny mind-
I feel the last one I'm not skinny I just can't dance
Okay I am skinny like that but I can still dance 😏
relatable
Try the same, but be short.
What do you mean you can’t dance those moves are fire 🔥
The last one is so true
I’ve been skinny with a high metabolism my whole life. I think I probably would relate to all of these when I was younger but I’d say now I only relate to the being too cold and society.
Ppl ask me if I have an eating disorder 🐻
I've never listened to a more true conversation in my life 😭
I’m still jealous. Being 18 with a dad bod is juuuust glamorous.
Literally were the same person
My brothers would call me a stick and when they needed a toothpick they called for me
I don’t think anyone can dance 😂
I can relate to all but the belt one, i guess my hips are wide enough for my belt to not be affected even though i have a BMI of 16.7
Same but the dance part
“I can’t dance” /proceeds to busta move
I lokey want jayus to get a gf, it'd be adorable and awesome
I feel this pain I eat all the time yet I’m still average weight so fast metabolism I guess
I can’t dance but that was awesome 😎
Yo my weight is 60-65kg and only because of my bones and my hight but I can dance otherwise I have the same problems as you and I'm eating a lot in a day and on the end of the day I'm 62kg light but after one hour of gaming 60kg again so I hate this problem
i know all of those problems even more than you maybe but thats also cuz of a musclair disease i have (and no wheelchair here can walk talk brown belt judo teacher here) but yeah i ate so little that i got something only peopele with and eating disorder get im not someone with an eating disorder either but yeah when i was 16 (that was like 8 years ago) i was 36 kg yeah now im 55 but rly i know all the struggles
U cant dance?! Thoes were some solid moves lmao
You are beautiful 😍😘
I been the same way all my life i eat and eat and i can still see my ribs trough my shirt when I pull it
Im underweight by two pounds tip for yall : always wear hoodies
Yup I have to get fat for three straight years and the pandemic hit. Now I need to gain a gym membership. It sucks😭
Something people always say to me “That can’t be healthy”
I,m 13 and my whieght is 80 puonds
Kpop idols listening to the last one :  Am I a joke to you ?
I have that problem :< which means I cant sit to fast
Exactly I can relate 1000%
As a skinny male I’m usually the smallest in every group (plus it doesn’t help that I’m 5’6 at 14)
Me, who has a skinny and tall boyfriend: *yup, these all sound very familiar*
I'm verry skinny to bit all the things are true but the dancing is just u
Facxzzz
Noone asked and noone cares racist b*ch!!
As a thicc person, you've helped me see the bright side of being large :]
Like that all hapends to me and I’m 10
This is so true Lmao I feel your pain
I mean you can see ab muscles easier so
As a skinny guy i can relate to this
You know what’s true? Society rarely considers skinny people being insecure and only thinks “insecure” means you have a bigger body. (only some people)
I don't think the cant dance is a skinny thing i think it's a you thing jayus ahah ily 🥰🤪
Same
Can relate, from one minecraft skeleton to another
Omg why is this so true I relate to every single thing she said
People don't get the calling someone skinny or fat is an insult.   I'm 16 and I have people constantly calling to young or not old enough to drive, people don't see this as an insult when they say it but it feels the same if I where to call them old when there only 30.
Facts for skinny people
I am not skinny but I get cold very fast Sooo yeah weird
Ok so like I can’t gain weight? Is that normal
I've experience everyone of these except number 3 I'm so fucking skinny some people say "DUDE GET SOME CLOTHES" and I'm here literally not giving a crap
Lmao I have a fast metabolism AGUS anorexia
As someone who is 57kg I agree
Jayus in a bikini was fucking terrifying.
I remember the belt thing from ehen I was a kid. the belt was too big, so my mom had tot poke extra holes in it for it to still serve its purpose.
I'va said it before and I'll say it again- why is it acceptable in society to skinny-shame but not fat-shame? it's like racism. Just another stupid problem with society
Being tall and skiny is a disability lol.
I can wearing 7 pairs of socks and  my feet will still be cold somehow
Wait till you hit 30. Thats when i started gaining weight now everyone tells me im getting fat
People are literally mean to me because I’m skinny and some people push me around and say I’m weak 😒
The bruises one, yess!! I've been on the chubby side my whole life but due to major surgery i've lost a lot of weight in a very short time span and suddenly sitting on a normal chair is like sitting on my hip bones. Hard mattresses hurt. I never knew how protecting the chubb really was
I can not hear the word society anymore, not even in other languages
same problems lol
That looked like a good dance to me
Well i dont get cold but EVERYONES LIKE "do your parents feed you?"
It is a blessing and a curse I can eat anything and everything and not gain any pounds but anything object can become a death sentence XD
all of those are so accurate except the dance one because i’m a dancer but i really skinny
Now compare with being overweight
A solution to the belt problem riger's belt   They are used by the military no holes. And they can fit almost every size just get one that's not too wide.
Frfr I've been tall but skin asf so I can feel u
I RELATE TO THIS SOOOOOO MUCH. I'VE BEEN SKINNY AS HELL MY ENTIRE LIFE AND LET ME TELL YOU I COULDN'T HAVE RELATED MORE.
I thought I was fat but thanks for giving me my true identity
I've been both, skinny as a kid and then got big after some health issues a few years ago
:(
I was the same until a couple of years ago
This is so true bro
Jayus in swimwear 🤨😩
I feel with you, I'm 1,76m (5,7) and got 55kg on me.  Blood stuff and all that us totally fine, I can eat as much I want but well, no sucess
I'm worse than you I'm short and skinny and life still sucks
This girl now has a place in my heart lol
I understand, it’s so hard for me to gain weight. And I eat so much- people are then like “ don’t eat so much your gunna get fat “ and I’m like “ that’s exactly what I’m trying to do “ also most people would say stuff like “ your so skinny you should eat more “ and then when I eat more there like “ you shouldn’t eat so much your going to get chubby “ I was around the age of 10 or 11 when people would say that- wonder why I have insincerity’s.
The dancing isnt bc ur skinny, ur just white
I'm sick of people thinking cussing makes them cool and relatable. Oh wait the best is that's just how I am. Guess I'm going to stop watching you because you cuss too much
I have the EXACT SAME FUCKING PROBLEMS!!! It's not even funny I have to put so many pillows on my damn chair so my ass didn't hurt and I constantly have to wear hoodies and sweat pants
Calling someone fat or skinning is still body shaming no matter what even if your trying to make it sound like a compliment
Normal for short people and kids to be skinny but not too skinny
All aee true
I hate it when people say “I wish I was as skinny as you” Like no I wish I wasn’t skinny
I eat 1kg meat and then we go somewhere the person there tells me to eat more
That is me
That is realllyyyyyyyyyy right Like seriously every thing you siad is true and it is about to be fact or it is already fact
Facts
You can in fact dance your legs work fine
Hey so yea i'm fat and still can't dance. I think it's about not practising and not about the body type.
Oh nooo it must be so hard being skinny 🙄
Thank you for making this 😊
I have the same problem
TRUUUUUUUEEEEE
Being skinny is worst but atleast your not fat and get hot for hours
Same. I literally shiver at random times of the day. I also can stress eat way too much sometimes I just struggle with putting on weight. Like it’s really tough and my wrists look soo skinny like it is weird.
And flat too
THE SITTING AMD LAYING DOWN ONE IS SO TRUE OMG
Still better than obesity
ngl those were some pretty cool moves imo
So relatable I am and have been very skinny my whole life so I can relate
I’d much rather be skinny than what I am rn
Love you as you are ❤️
I’m skinny and very underweight and when I am cold even when it’s not cold outside, my mother calls me grandma
I had the same problems! Like- I can dance… not to brag but… ye and also the comments!- yes true
don’t forgot your spine on the back of those chairs at school. terrible feeling.
Can conform this is real.
I have the same problem and all of this is true
Yes!! I'm 15 and 6 foot and I'm skinny af and I have the same problems
last ones not a skinny person problem yhats just a personal problem of yours
Omg I totally agree I’ve been skinny my home life and I agree with all of this
Exactly bro, People always rant about fat problems but sleep on skinny problems.
You also always get that 1 comment: "You're so lucky!" No. I am cold.
yeah it was that same things for me
Jayus just kinda vibin
I don't think that the last one is a skinny person problem im a bit overweight but you still dance better than I can
I'm a foot under all my friends I'm 12 almost 13 I'm 4f7inch and 70 pounds
What do you mean you can’t dance? Your The most talented dancer I’ve seen on YouTube shorts.
No one can dance
I WANNA BE COLD
When you buy stuff in small or even xs and it STILL doesn’t fit, cannot find a child size compression sleeve 🙄
jayus :i cant dance also jayus: *pulls of the best moves*
My dad always says I need meat on my bones. IT DISAPPEARS AFTER I FRICKIN HAVE BOWEL MOVEMENTS
3 and 2 are problems for me
She must be short
There's a problem in Switzerland where some shops think all. People are ✨SKINNY LEGENDS ✨
I’m sorry you fell that way. I think that everyone is beautiful in their own way💕💞💕
I’m also skinny af
I think you dance pretty well
Mood
My brother is the same size as you and he has all tge same issues
Your a girl with no shape it’s just bone
Now do fat people
Bruh I've been fat my whole life
Kinda make me glad I’m a little thicker
Yep every day i go down every one says do you eat ???
She said all my problems
I can relate with everything
Bro I swear this is painfully related to what I used to go through. When I was a kid I would bend over my spine would be so visible I would never sit down since my spine would stick out and my parents would say I'm too skinny, and I've always tried to eat so much but I be so damn skinny. One time I was at a movie theater and I ate a whole damn large bucket of popcorn. Still I was skinny AF. and I would always wish I would gain weight
I feel you
The Last two Things are still Traumatizing for me, People Often Say I Don't eat that much But I Shit you not I eat like an Alligator Finally finding something to Eat, it's just my Metabolism is too High for my Meat to Grow, The dance thing too, I'm too Stiff and Skinny to properly Dance.
Volleyball???
This is so relatable
I know how you feel
I'm a skinny kid 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can relate not to mention for me people keep com up to me like you're so beautiful and I wish I had your body up I'm like NO STOP IN NOT BEATIFUL YOU ARE sometimes I'm insecure be I make others insecure
Another one is sit-ups or anything like that hurts a lot on the tailbone
FINNALLY PEOPLE WHO R LIKE ME
Relatable
Those dance moves would definitely worked in the 80s
5 2 at 14 85 pounds Shut up
I love how the dancing has nothing to do with weight, it just got thrown into the video
YESSSS
PLS I CAN RELATE- i hate sitting in my Classic because my lower part of my body hurts so badddd😭😭😭
I can relate to so many of these but because I’m overweight since having my 3rd child.
I'm slightly over weight but dont worry  Im working been playing sports and going to the gym lately
Im not fat, just inculcated
I felt that when you mentioned the cold thing.
I think that last one is just you. I'm big and can't dance either.
I can relate to all 🤣😭
Used to have this problem until I turned 40...yeah the fat just keeps coming....
I have the opposite problem.
Yess
Sooo truuuue
This was exactly me growing up. Constant shit about being skinny from the family was the worst part. And now I'm like twice the weight I used to be. Yay...
Yeah but being slim is way better that being overweight cuz it won't cuz diseases or disorders in your body... So you better accept it 😂😂
It’s not because she’s skinny, it’s cause she’s white she can’t dance. Proof: Im white
🤣🤣I can relate. It’s not like we don’t eat. In varsity I get people who are always offering me harbal life for weight gain
How did you gain weight
Yeah I've heard the majority of these my entire life, the "meat on your bones" comments were a CONSTANT annoyance! I've had girlfriends who literally ate with me for every meal think I have an eating disorder, it's insane! I'd eat more than my friends but they'd try to make me eat MORE! If it's not okay to tell a fat person they're "too fat" then it shouldn't be okay to tell a skinny person they're "too skinny"!
Facts all of them
Im pretty sure being fat is waaaaaay waaaay worse but ok
Do fat people now
Soo trueeeee
Relatibal on everything
My problem is the opposite
I agree no one really talks about being to skinny. Everyone called me a twig, stick it hurt. I wasn’t coordinated or fast made me look awkward. People think its ok to make fun of skinny people
Your really cute!!!!
I have been skinny as fuck my hole life 2 i also recently have started to put some height but i am still 1.87 and 71kg which is not much for my height and i am only fucking 16 so i will probably add more height and the fact that i eat more than my family combined and a kid comes along and says go eat something triggers me and thw worst for me is the fact that my fingers are always ice sticks
the societal comments suck most,
RELATABLE. AS. HELL.
:)
I can’t dance either😂😂😂
Hate it when my school pants don’t fit and i gotta use a belt :|
I can relate
Sitting down for ages definitely hurts, lying down in the wrong position, rolling  waistbands of all my pyjama pants, even managing to find leggings that being too big on me and people giving me that ‘look’ when I only eat small portions and trying to stuff me with more food even though I just get full quickly
I'm fat but the first three still fucking apply to me wtf. The last one shouldn't, but of course it does because of my cold intolerance.
Bro I have the same problems and the things they say😔
Honestly, relatable. It hurts to lay down like that, I get blown around when the mph for the wind is over 50, and people always saying I need to eat more or workout. I’m 14 and less than 100 lbs
Dude Fr I’m so happy I grew out of being dumb skinny now I’m at 175 but I was like 130 at 6 foot lol
You're dedication to vids is elite
Ppl who dont know how it feels:colorfull immage Ppl who know : u have just decended to hell make ur self at home fool
This is the exact thing that happens to me and I’m 12 and 50 pounds :(
I have been fat for half my life
Dude this is so relatable, I HATE WHEN I SIT ON A WOODEN CHAIR OR SOMETHING 🥲
I can't really tell
Is nobody gonna talk about her incredible dance skills.
I have my dads metabolism and my doctor thought my parents were starving me as a baby
I relate to this so much 🥲
Every single problem is my problem too :,)
I'm kinda stupid took me too long to figure out you dont weigh 67lbs.
I wish I had those kind of problems 6.6
These are all soooo true! I bruise so unbelievably easy like opening a cabinet door or bumping into a door handle even lightly hurts so much and I’m like yep that’s gonna leave a bruise
That's me
I think being skinny doesn't corelate to you being bad at dancing
The society one is true especially if everyone hates u too
The last one is not a skinny person problem it’s a you problem
I thought you were a boy
Damm those are facts
"skinny people problems : can't dance"  Kpop idols, especially female kpop idols : 🧍🏻‍♀️
I don’t see how that’s messed up to say to a kid never bothered me ever
I don’t think not being able to dance is a skinny persons problem I think it’s just a you problem
But you were just danceing
Sheeeeeee
But I mean it’s still socially acceptable
Skinny peoples usually grab their bow and arrow when it's night time and shot random guy with blue pant and shirt on
Everithing is Real even the dance thing
I'm literally the same.
Same problem I'm tall as hell like you are and I've always been skinny. I'm 6'5" and weigh only about 165-170 pounds. So yeah, I feel your pain.
I'm with you on that me and my son have that same problem  when I was in the Navy they use to make me two to three servings per meal and no weight gain  it wasn't till I was in my 30s till I got to my proper weight Then I had an accident and by the time I woke up in the hospital I lost it all Two weeks in a comma is was down from 170-118 and I'm back to that weight after another 20 years. The other comment is where does he put all that food And getting tired quicker the further you go between meals   doesn't matter how or often you eat doesn't help But have you ever been All you can eat restaurant and they say you eat more than a fat ass   don't come back you freak But at least when I when I drop my pants I can see my #@$& not like fat people who forget they have one because they haven't seen it for years
This is relatable
Holy crap your dancing makes me so uncomfortable 😣 but I’m still a fan
The not dancing that's not being skinny I mean I can actually dance like full blown break dancing and I'm skinny asf
It’s so true
Facts
Lucky mate im only 14 and i weigh over 123kg
I once went to my family friend’s house and one of the parents said this to me as soon as they saw me, “wow, you got skinnier, do you still eat?” 😃
Ok thank you ppl always talk abt fat ppl have it worse and skinny ppl need to stop being so ungrateful abt thier body but it's tough both ways. And yes society's comment do hurt the most
How do I get taller I'm tired of getting called short
Same thing with me, I'm 12 and I weigh 96 pounds
Ah so relatable
Sick dance moves tho XD
I am skinny too so i can relate
Tbh I was like this when I had anxiety from eating
yeah when i was younger i was below a healthy weight i’m good now
This is literally me
Girl I feel you! Imagine being short WHILE being skinny!
People all the time say at school do you eat I like shut up when people say that to me but I don’t say it bc I nice
I am skinny as f#@k
The cold fact is really true I’m always cold for no reason
I’m cold every day of the year except the very hottest part of the summer
As a "skinny" person, i confirm.
Bruh just drink egg nog problems solved
There is this boy in my class and he is like a STICK reincarnated We all make jokes about it and he also makes jokes about it and doesn't mind it But now that I think about it years later he was probably just laughing so he doesn't seem like a party pooper...  But this other girl just said whatever she wanted and really hurt others feelings. She always found a way to be correct, even when she was  wrong. My class sucked lol
The dancing was kinda cringe NGL
I relate to all of these
R u girl or boy ? BC u wear boy clothes but then you wear a girls swimming suit
Yep you are right about every thing specially the dancing part I am 6 foot 4  And I look like like a ducking skeleton wobbling around not not even mentioning when I go to a public swimming pool .
Literally I have the exact same problems
To be fair, I'm 6'4 and 230 lbs. Sitting down also hurts my ass bones most of the time.
You dance like Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani.   The best dancers in Friends.
Jayus: skinny people problems  Also Jayus: *explains problems that have nothing to do with being skinny*
I love your dancing you can dance it’s groovy and I’m sorry people skinny shame you
Ahh, the most relatable video.
Bro this is so hella true,my mom calls me a skeleton and i honestly cry every night bc of how skinny i am. She forces me to over-eat and i just hate it but theres nothing i can do.  Thank you for all the support! and if i say no to my mom,she'll think it as im talking back and she would beat me up :/ And yes i have high metabolism,no matter how much i eat i never gain weight
You dance better than me😂😂😂😂
BROOOOOO I FEEEEEEL U (and my spine when I scratch my back
I had to poke holes in my belt cause my pants were to big and my belt wasn’t helping 🥲
I can reylate to everything she days here  Them school chairs hurt🤕
I am super skinny and NEVER get cold. Idk why but never
U were skinny bt fit i am partially skinny and have a bit of belly and heavy upper body the things that i get to hear on both parts i swearrrr!!!

Bruh I’m hella skinny to😩

NOBODY CAN DANCE ONLYJAYUS 🤗
If your scales in kilos and your 66.4 kilos that's pretty under weight
Why is this dude always goblin stooped I n the vanity top?
I’m skinny af as well, and this is so relatable
You can dance. Look at them moves.
Hey how tall are you . You seem to be quite tall
>"I can't dance" >Immediately proves herself wrong Hmmm...
She is racist
You can’t win in this world. If your skinny they make fun of you. I get called fat all the time by skinnier people than you and it hurts. Especially when your trying to lose that weight. Why does this world have to be so cruel.
My skinny friend can't lose any weight
Lol I have those isues too
"Can't dance" proceeds to do exactly that.
That everybody dance now song came on my tv at the same time in the video
Yo that is Me
Lets not forget that when u lay flat on ur stomach u hurt your pelvis bones
When ppl say to me go eat food your so skinny excuse me I eat so much I eat all the time I’m still skinny
Idk how much the sitting down is a skinny girl problem, when I was 200 pounds my booty bones still hurt sitting down!
I have part of my ribs sticking out I’m 13 and I weigh 88 pounds this is o true
This is so relatable im 20 years old 6'1" and only 170 lb
SO RELATABLE
Being fat is wayyy worse
It all true for me But I CAN dance 9years of it baby
So I’m like jayus. Tall asf, walking skeleton, I look like a praying mantis when I dance, when we I hit my knees on ground or a pole it hurts like hell, and worst of all I’m always hungry and I burn calories extremely quick so I never gain weight.
Please tell me that weight is 166 not 66 cause if so I think your missing some organs
I CAN SO RELATE
i’m the same way. another one is that my feet are really long but super skinny so shoes don’t rly fit
Skinny ppl problems like mine :(
Don't forget the pain when laying down on a hard floor
I have you covered. I'm cushioned for convenience. I also pump out the BTUs so keeping you warm is what i do. Now that it's winter, i'm going to start getting hit on by skinny girls. They only want me for my body...
Her dancing just made my day👌👌👌
It’s better then being fat it’s better being skinny when your fat no one likes you and the only way you can make people like you is being funny luckily I’m funny
TRUE!!!!!!
not being able to dance is not just a thin people problem
People still call me skinny vinny, like how tf am I supposed to put on weight all i DO is eat
it's okay my cousin has been skinny her entire life she's almost 16 and not even in the 70's
Big facts all all of these
Okay now im thinking about skinny steve in the beginning of CATFA this is so true for him
Dance moves increased*
I have all these problems but im not skinny.
Why are all these my problems all the timeeee
Me tooooo lol
Her: I can't dance  Me: yet you still dance better than me
I'm skinny but I don't get that cold even if I'm in a room at a temperature of 28°C for 3 hours I'm still leaving the room at a 36°C body temp
Not the worst dance moves
Are you a boy
I used to be so too.. when I was around 9.. I'm 13 and now 41 kilograms.  My 10 yo sis is 41 too. But I kinda look good like this..
Her in a slight breeze: 🦴💨🦴💨🦴💨🦴
Bruh I thin as crap too :)
This is too real
No Jaya’s you can’t dance Yes jayus  it’s because of your weight never let anyone tell you otherwise.
Atleast your dancing skills are better then my brother
Too easy
Your a girl Damn😂😂
Ha same all
Skinny people have some problems too, okay?  *cries in Minecraft skeleton noises*
same problem here... eating a lot but still skinny
Im also skinny and these are all the problems i have, it just sucks. My metabolisam is really fast so that sucks more
You're dancing is so funny
You dancing skills are on point idk what your talking abt
Same
I’ve dealt with it as a kid and it’s made me mentally hurt a lot and made me cry sometimes. But now I’m normal :)
Relatable
To first 3 abosolutly true
I remember there was like one story my mom and dad told me back then when I was like 3 basically the story was a about a boy that wind took him because he didn't eat anything and my mom and dad told me you're going to end up like him and I was skinny so because of that I am still scared of strong winds
She described my whole life just now
Ok, I don't know why, but I had a dream about you last night, and you were in a psych ward, and it caught fire, all of a sudden, and I literally just pushed you, and I  pulled you and grabbed your arm as tight as I could pulled u back, and we started dating, is that a sign I'm just wondering I'm curious
Facts bro this happend a all the times
I’m not necessarily light but I’m tall so it makes me skinny
I’m skinny and I can dance
I have all these problems
:) fat probs tho too skinny to me is cute🤪🥺 Be proud of urself
You see I am still growing and I am skinny. I have all of these problems. But, it really annoys me when people tell me I need to eat more or when they find out what I weigh and their reactions. Like it is healthy for people to be skinny and other people need to realize that.
My brother calls me a twig and says I'll blow away when it's slightly windy outside But on the upside I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want and stay skinny!
I have most of these problems
Society will put down all body types skinny to overweight
Why'd the video start off with her standing (shoes on) ontop of a sink? Wtf 💀
Thank you for noticing this
Everyone: you can’t dance  Me: Go JaYs GeT iN tO iT
This is all true for me but, I can boogy down
They would say i can put my “fingers around your wrist.”
Ya those are all the problems
Also eating more does nothing. I went from 105 to 90 pounds my freshman year of high school (aka went from borderline underweight to actually underweight) because of ADHD medications (ADHD meds are not weight loss drugs, lose weight healthily! Losing weight this way can cause your body to have the famine reaction). And I stopped taking vyvanse because of that, but it’s taken me FOUR FUCKING YEARS to get back to a healthy weight. I’m now over 110 pounds! And the belt thing is so real. You can’t buy children’s belts because they are too small or have weird designs, but adults’ belts don’t work cause they’re too big unless you want to cut your belt
As a squishy person, I can't relate
somebody who is on the fatter side tells me I’m too skinny and that I need to eat meat more and my brain thinks “At least I’m not fat like you”
“I can’t dance” *proceeds to take Michael out of his place*
Its ok im chubby and i cant dance either 😂
I HATE low waisted pants and when i try to wear high waisted pants they just slowly slide down me! 😡
YES YES YES THANK U FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO I FEEL SO SEEN
I’m 14 and weight more you 😬😂
Spiting fact
When I was a kid I was tall and skinny so guess what? I had to wear my dad's belt and poke like 8 new holes
The comments are the worst. Do YoU eAt I EAT MORE THAN YOU
I’ve never related to a video so much 😭
SO TRUE! All Of theseee especially the dancing one 😭
Casually having the same problem
Those dance moves were 🤌🏼🤌🏼
“Can’t dance”   * proceeds to absolutely kill the dance floor *
im basically a skeleton and for many many years my ribs were practically see through. And i'd get comments like "are you on a diet" "dont you ever eat" "i cooked less food for you because you have a little stomach" "why dont you eat more" like that is fricked up man
your dance moves are ✨immaculate✨
Same but Im average weight for my age?
I can't dance either and Ive never been skinny, lets make a club
Seriously the sitting and laying thing..... My spine hurts, my ass hurts, my ribs hurt, my neck hurts, EVERYTHING FUCKING HURTS. Also the Clothes thing is very annoying. I have hip dips and I'm quite tall so if the length works then the waist will be too big. Belts? Fuck them i poke new holes in each and every one. And even though i eat like a cow i still don't put on any weight because of my metabolism and get the "do you never eat?" comments.
I’m long and skinny lol + I have a long neck
As someone skinny I hate when people say "Just eat more", I would love to it's not that easy. That's why I feel fat people, tho exercise can always help you loose weight but it doesn't help as much in gaining it, you still have to eat a lot it just makes you hungrier
OMGEEE YESSS
THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME IM 5’8 AND 115 POUNDS PEOPLE DONT UNDERSTAND THE STRUGGLE IM ONLY 13!!!
Cant dance but at least your enjoying yourself 👍
It's not just the skinny people that can't dance. I'm proof of that 💀
The things about me, for example is that I'm overweight but I have the same sitting problems lmao.
The comments are always just the right amount of annoying, where you get mad but you can't say anything because it'll be an "overeaction" and it was just "a joke"
Omg I thought that I was the only one who was struggling with these problems.
eat moar
The always cold thing hits home
everyone would always tell me i was gonna blow away
Wow all of these are true for me except the society one XD
this is literally me
People call me twig, very creative you dumbfuck
Eat junk food easy
And it's very hard to get comfortable at times
Omg I’m also skinny and it’s soo true
Bruh you dancing was me at the rave last night ahahhaha
I’m 66 lb
Have you ever heard this one: A girl I dated in high school was so skinny her dad would say, "If you don't put on some weight you're going to slip thru your own a**hole and hang yourself." I still chuckle at that many years later. P.S...she filled out nicely and is married with two daughters of her own. 😁
I'm a 14 year old that just hit 100 pounds as a 6 foot tall human being, I eat like a hog that hasn't eaten in 40 years and I've only put on 3 pounds since January. And when I say eat like a hog I mean every meal is a 3 course meal that I usually get three helpings of! And the meals aren't even small, they are feasts! Plz help 😂😂😂
No belts ever fit me and I don’t bloody know why like I go past smaller than small
LITERALLY NO ONE WILL STOP ASKING “OMG YOUR SO SKINNY, DO YOU EAT???”
THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS!!! I'm sick and tired of people saying they want to have my motabolism, but it's COLD, MAN
idk if this helps but, i do prefer the skinny ones bc i'm really fat and i like balance in my life
Oh true
I like that 1st dance ngl
Same
My fatass (more like 77) can't dance either, so guess that's just a thing us peeps don't got the talent for
frrrrr me too
and everything hurts more
I'm skinny and I'm the same
That what people say to me
I can relate to all of these
Preach sis!! And ur dancing looks like mine . Lol I like though
I feel everything u just said
I can relate to that one
I’m also skinny and I feel all of that
Once someone was like "your such a stick" and I said "at least om not a circle" and just walked away
This is me
you have pretty privilege though.
Sheesh jayus pretty clean ;) that thic ass is clean
The belt one caught me off guard, almost spit up my water.
The world is bogus if you’re too fat people make fun of you if you’re too skinny people make fun of you it doesn’t make any sense
YO I CAN RELATE TO THIS
Facts
I TOTALLY RELATE. THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE FACT THAT SITTING HURTS YOUR BUTT 😭
This is me..
Relatable!!!
This reached me on a spiritual level, I weigh 90 pounds 🤣
I can relate
Wait I didn’t know I was skinny but I can relate to most if these- Also r dancing is very good ngl
you good? god damn
I get called chopsticks and twig lol
Calm down what about the F word stuff what is wrong with you
Yea that dancing thing might be a YOU problem 🤣😂😂🤣
i’m here. the good thing about being skinny is that you’re friends can carry you so easily
"put meat under your bones"
Nice i have 1,97 cm and 68 kg and 25 y and that what you said is really right
I'm not gonna lie people she got some issues
This facts
I don't think can't dance is a skinny problem  Cause I can't either
I have some meat on me now, but I was neglected as a kid and no one knew, so the comments would hurt ten times worse. Because I'm thin, I still get these some of these comments and it takes me back to when I was that small and frail girl. Shit really fucks with you as it is, but when trauma is attached, it can do even more damage. Wish people would just stop feeling the need to tell everyone what their bodies should be like.
I'm 15 years old, I'm 6 feet tall, I'm 235 pounds. I'm not fat but, I'm not skinny. I'm relatively strong but, I wish I had more muscle. I think I have a form of body dysmorphia because even though I know I'm not fat I still feel fat.
All of them are true except for the last one. You just can’t dance unfortunately 😂
Oh I know that
I can’t dance *starts vibin*
Yo, your actuly kinda good at dancing tho
Burh I feel this so hard
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING!!
Jayus: "I can't dance!"   Me: Ain't that White People Problems?
Omfg, everything she said it’s trueee, You see I was born a month early than I was supposed to, meaning my body wasn’t really ready, tho right now I’m 15 I’m healthy there’s nothing wrong with me, tho yes I’m extremely skinny people are worried about my health tho I tell them that I’m fine and it’s completely natural. And yes my pants don’t fit and no belt couldn’t fit either so I had to poke holes, I try to gain weight but over the years I never could the only weight I gotten was like 6 years ago today when I was 9 I was like 90 Pounds right now that I’m 15 I’ve only gained 30 pounds over the 6 years of my life. And yes I do get really cold easily. I went to go to the Dentist and it was I cold, I couldn’t stop shivering, even the hot blanket that they gave me couldn’t stop me from shivering.  Edit: Yeah I cant dance either, today for Band we had to do choreography about Thriller by Micheal Jackson legit tried all I could and it sorta went well but not as much as I hoped to, I really did try but it counts
Right
The Dancing thing isn't a skinny person problem it's a white person problem
We must end the skinnyphobia and skinny-shaming
Comin from a skinny person yes this is so true
I thought Being fat was bad but I guess not the only issue is that I can't do pushups and I'm not that fat
the worst is that no insulation, always feel like im in a blizzard 😭
hehe i’ll never releate
My mum's high school friends used to put rocks in her pockets so "she wouldn't fly in the wind"
I mean just workout and eat constantly but they skinny people say they do but you gotta do it a certain way
This is so true I am skinny AF I am 10 and I weigh 4 and a half stone
I look like a stickman. I eat a fucking ton of food every day. And if i eat less i start to get even skinnier, so shit.
Yea I can relate to all of these and my  dad constantly tells me to eat more all the time
Nah Jayus kinda got the schmoves tho
Bro im twelve and i could lift u up how is 66 a healthy weight
Frr
I totally feel this girl, I've been blown down by the wind.
Literally me.
I’ve been left with a very poor relationship with my weight because of people’s comments from when I was a kid. I  have body image problems now
I know how you feel
When it started going fast when she was dancing because it was funny
Being shamed for being skinny when I LITERALLY EAT LIKE A COW 🤣 but forreal pisses us off. Don't point out someone's weight REGARDLESS
I'm capable of eating 2 double big Macs in one sitting yet I'm still this goddamn skinny lmao
The dance tho 😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣
Who ever said you couldn’t dance lol
When I was little and if the wind was a little stronger everyone would say :„Be careful the wind would blow you away " like WTF people 😐
As a skinny boi, I can confirm this.
Seing point 5 as someone with to much weight be like: oh, not pleasant, sorry to hear about it😬🥺😭
I want to be skinny tbh
I’m happy I’m not the only one this happens to
There are 5- you olds that weigh more than me- 8 year old me, 2018
You dance better than me
I know I was damm fat then I started working I got skinny
Better being skinny then fat
I felt this on a personal leave especially one word looks like you need some meat on your bones
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂I've been fat my whole life never had problems
Such a hot chick!!
Dang it.....i was the slightly heavy kid, very slightly.....and now i want burgers
Thank you for relating to my life
So freaking true
It's pronounced "hot as fuck" not "skinny as fuck".
Jayus is a girl mind blown 🤯
She cute
I feel this pain everyday 😂 i am skinny asf no cap
My type of woman.
Can still dance better than me
Yeah I’m also skinny like you and all of these are true except the second one
Why is this so goddamn true I just barely reached 90.3 pounds this goddamn year and I’m 13
I can relate to all of this honestly
I was skinny and the cold one is so true not the sitting or laying down one i started to eat everything i see because of how i was always cold now i dont freeze to death
I'm fucking 16 and my weight is so much fucking lower the average like I'm about 45ish kg like my fucking friend is 65 btw in a boy just had to put that in there so you don't be like owww no you should be skinny cz your a girl and stuff like that
EXACTLY ....THANK YOU JAYUS! how about hitting your hip bones
That's basically me tho
I am skinny
I thought those were some groovy moves
Fr like stfu with the hate comments.
I feel bad that you have skinny problems Jayus but the ending with you dancing was just 😂 lmao.
As a skinny man who can dance,it's not because you're skinny💀
Is nobody else realizing the 3rd photo looks like dave from boyinaband? Also jayus you got awesome dance moves
I can agree with her it is really annoying having your trousers falling down constantly
The best world  dancer
I'm sorry I now take back the lost of people i can snap like a twig at my school
66 lbs nice
I think your amazing <3
All of this is so true
For real though
You are still extremely attractive 😉
WAIT YOUR A GIRL???
I've been skinny my entire life cause my body can't absorb nutrients plus a yeast infection in my stomach since I was born and all I can say is this video is completely accurate.
I been skinny af
I thought she was gona give advice on how to eat right I’m also a twig😂😂
NUMBER 5 ‼️‼️‼️
“I can’t dance” that’s just a white people problem
We look like praying mantis’s dancing
Everything here is so true it’s sad people always said to me and still do go eat something or your so skinny. It’s like yiu wouldn’t go up to a person on the streets and say your so fat but you would go up to something like me and say ong your so skinny. And I’m so scared your gonna get sucked up by the wind.
Everybody that's fat in the comments: 👁👄👁
I relate
I'm skinny too I'm really skinny so I don't but I do eat some stuff
Ur not 60 lbs lol
“I can’t dance”    That’s a you problem
lol so true like I CANT SLEEP ON MY CHEST I WILL INDEED DIE IS MY SLEEP also people think that you dont eat…i am naturally skinny
Im skinny and i cant gain weight. I hate when people say to eat more because i eat more than an average person
I've always been fat but it's so fucked up how people think they can just comment on someone else's body and justify it based on that person's size
Size 12 In men shoes
Yassss
I almost went kite mode in wales because of wind
JOKES ON YOU I DON EVEN LIKE DANCING (the worst of all of this is the laying on the ground parts)
Same as being fat but opposite
Meh you can dance better than me definently
The dance part😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ahort and skinny yay fuuuuucccc
Ayo twin?-
It's me
Okay, this is the most relatable thing ever. One thing a lot of people ( namely my immediate family ) is that they joke around, saying I'll get blown away but heavy wind. And I get body shamed like a lot for being so skinny
The belt one is spooky relatable
Pretty sure your dancing skills (or lack there of) is due to your lack of knowledge on how to dance, not related to your body mass.
People say that stuff to me all the time… I’m 15 And I’m 70lbs… for medical reasons…
I don’t think the last one is because your skinny
The dance part deadass me 😂😂👌
Shes like 7 foot tall btw
I know your damn pain!!😩😩 I've been dealing with that since I was Very young🤣
Fucking FACTS 🙌🏻 … exept the dancing part xD
YES YES YES THANK YOU BRUH I FEEL THIS WAY TO MUCH
What about skinny jeans they either to short or don’t fit well 😭😭😭
If I don’t have these problems, does that mean I’m fat.
Fr lol
I'm the same way lol
Have a borgir
Make sure you go watch my new vlog :) https://youtu.be/Qo0HfMIR_ME
I feel that
Also try doing sit ups on the gym floor. I'm so skinny and have bad posture so my spine sticks out and it BUMPS THE FREAKING FLOOR
Lov this chick! She's very entertaining
I was the skinniest girl in my class growing up and everybody would always make comments like "You look like a stick. Do your parents ever feed you?  I can see your bones throught your skin!"  Like they don't go up to an overweight person and say "You look like a cow" but they don't mind going up to a skinny person and calling them a skeleton" and making comments if they eat or not  Well that's how my class was like :/
Lol the last one I can't dance and can't relate to any as I'm a a chubby girl lol
Fr I've been trying to eat more but school and work makes it so hard to get more than one good meal a day in :( and ppl think it's better to be skinny than fat, no  society makes fun of you either way
OMG FINALLY SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE SAME FRICKEN PROBLEM. I mean ik some people want to be skinny BUT NOT AS SKINNY AS ME! My arms are s t I c k s. And I'm f l a t.
I’d rather prefer to be told go eat a burger than stop eating burgers lol 😅
Just get really really high and go to golden coral
Well you can take some of my weight i am a 208 lbs 13 year old
Try being fat 🤣 I can't even dance and I'm fat
I am skinny
How did you get that weight lol, McDonald's dont do anything, I eat alot of food, nothing. I don't eat McDonald's to try get fat I just eat it now cause I'm young but like it dont do anything
SAAAAMMMMME
Being on the other side always get annoyed when skinny people to complain but I think I can understand that we all got our problems just some more than others I’m a chunkers always have been always will be
The sitting down one was so relatable 😭
😂 true
I can relate to everything but the cold
The dance thing is just you
OK, I have the opposite kind of problem 😆
ALL OF THOSE THING ARE ALL TRUE!! It hurts just as much to be called skinny as someone calling you fat!  OMG AND literally none of my jeans fit without a belt!!!!  IT SO ANNOYING.  My "friend" tease me about being skinny.  Dont listen to people that are mean they are just probably insecure about themselves
MEAN COMMENTS ABOUT SKINNY PEOPLE ARE JUST AS BAD AS MEAN COMMENTS ABOUT FAT PEOPLE (why don’t people understand this???? if anyone is reading this, don’t say annoying stuff like “go get some meat on your bones” it’s annoying)
I'm just thankful I somehow wasnt deeply affected by my very endearing primary school nickname, "skin n bones"
How did you gained weight? Need help... SOS.
Jayus: I can't dance   Me: oh that's just white people in general.
Funny how people always highlight Hate against overweight people but completly downplay the hateful comments if you are skinny and this shit doesnt get taken serious
Felt all of it!
Same... im just like that 😔
Use a square scarf for a belt
When is the solutions video to this problem?
I used to be underweight as a kid due to high metabolism and my restrictive eating habits. I miss having these problems, honestly. I'm a lot larger now and I'm overweight and cant seem to lose it (I have asthma and can't exercise often and I have PCOS which makes losing weight quite difficult). I'm not obese or fat, just a lot chubbier than I'd prefer. I miss having tiny wrists and being able to see my collar bones. I miss not having a fat face and neck and I miss not having a weird layer of fat over my ribs. Not having stretch marks and not having my thighs chafe when I walk.
Me to don't worry
Te faltan cazuelas 😎😎😎
I am healthy with 297 lbs/ 135 kg and 6-2" height. Phewww....
U got grooves girl
i now understand my brothers entire life
I don't get the sitting one
Skinny people get cold real fast because of no insulation? Huh then the fuck is my problem I’m 270lbs and I get cold a little to quickly for a man my size 😂😂
Why wear the old style uncomfortable belt get a modern one the universal belt
And just when you think you finally put on some weight it turns out you actually weight less than before SOMEHOW
Omg my ass is 10 and I’m heavier than you and they say I’m under weight..
I relate to this
As a skinny person I can confirm that this is all very true
We still love you baby girl 👑
I can relate to all of this
I’m fat and I get cold really fast even if I wear extra cloths
As a skinny person, can confirm all of this is true! AND IT SUCKS!
I have the metabolism of a god and it's double edged blade   One side I like it and it's great to keeping a good figure no matter what I eat.  On the other hand I'm either burning up or freezing cold, constant stomach pain from hunger (I don't like eating a lot of big meals.), And I can't gain weight.
You CAN dance
Same boat! Finally hit 170lbs and got covid and hated food for two months. I'm at 148 lbs now. 🙄
ALL SO FUCKING TRUE!!!! LOL
Youuu look good at that shorts and bikini btw im a girl but you look prettyyyy❤
I can relate to everything she just said       And somehow to what she's wearing
One skinny person to another that's some pretty good dance
OMG TRUE
I mean, skinny people can dance. I think that’s just an individual problem that doesn’t have anything to do with how skinny someone us.
Same but I can dance and I eat a lot like a lot
Same like being fat
RELATABLE 😭
People: ohhhh poor you! Such an awful 'problem' to have! I wish I had that problem! Me, who isn't skinny at all: why the hell you saying that to people. That's so mean. 😭
Being someone who’s struggled with their weight their whole life I can relate to these, people are horrible. I’ve been told so many times “Oh I wish I was as skinny” “omg you’re a literal twig” or the the classic wrapping their hand around my wrist thinking it’s funny when it’s hurtful. I’ve even been told “Be lucky you aren’t fat 😒” like bro, first of all that hurts and second of all people on the other side of the weight spectrum from me are fucking awesome, they give literally the best hugs ever man. Also it’s literally something I CANT CONTROL! Also I can’t dance either Lmaooo
I can eat a lot of food but I can’t gain pounds it’s weird
I'm skinny to lol
Yeah the weirdest person in my class skinny is hell called me fat probably because I’m taller than him and not skinny af I still took it personally
When I went to California my great grandma kept asking me if I wanted to eat every 5 minutes.
I feel you
I have a problem like this. I'm very skinny but eat like 3. Someone ended up suggesting me to go see a doctor because they thought I was bulimic and throw up each time I ate
Everything.. you said, is SO true
Finally someone with the same problem
The honesty is painful  I know exactly how this feels
A few people have asked me if I'm anorexic. Now I have some serious body image issues ayyyyy
I feel this
I use to be like this but I went through a state of depression and gained literally 180lbs in 1 1/2 years
Ur not skinny
This me to a tee
Imma be honest not being able to dance with probably a you problem.
no way she got that courage to post that dance
Idk man, seems a more than fair trade off for getting to eat literally anything and not fearing turning into a balloon the size of a truck
Samee here
Ralatible
Lol good dance keep it up 😉😁
That sitting thing is soo relatable 😩 being skinny sucks
We eat so much food, yet we are so skinny probably because of the fast metobolism
Hah I can't relate
I can relate to the society one. Everyone always says “ you need to eat some meat or your probably going to die”
Omg yes y is this so true
I relate too much
But your dance moves are everything.
Guess I'm skinny too I don't know how to dance 😂
As a fat person, I can say, I CANT DANCE EITHER!! WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT????!!!
It is annoying
People are rude to me a lot because I’m skinny and there always like go eat skinny kid my parents have told me it my whole I just can’t gain weight. ☹️😩🥺
You thats messed up to say to a kid"  Me whos not even 15 +
This is the story of my life
YES.
Dear god I lowkey could fall in love with this person
I’m not skinny and at all and I have had the same problems except being cold lol
All of the above have happened to me
What do you mean you can’t dance or some killer moves 😂😂
This is me, But I’m still at an unhealthy weight
As someone who has been skinny their whole life aswell I can agree to the struggles. I just not reached 100 lbs and I'm very proud of myself for this. But that's not the point. The point is I have also gotten comments saying I should eat more, wear clothes that fit me, ect. But the thing I can relate to the most is getting cold very fast. I used to live in Alaska and with that ik the struggle of trying to stay warm way to well.
I am lightly underweight and my dance skills are no better than yours, I think it might be related...
no you can dance,, its just awful
My freind is smaller than me and as skinny as me and hes stronger than me and im scared to hop on her back becuse their skin feels fragile or gentle as somepeople describe
same here
Well, the last one is just you🤣
Nooo your dancing are now my go to dance moves
SO THATS WHY IM COLD ALL THE TIME AAAAAAAA
I am guessing you havent been fat
This is me
Still be dancing better than me
You are quite tall though  My mom is over 6' tall and she looks pretty skinny  But she's a normal weight for her height
Wow I relate to this so much. I use a really thick piece of string as a bet cause my belts dont fit me lol-
So true I can relate so much
Girl same and I'm short so people think that I'm in KINDERGARTEN I'm in fifth grade.... And when they find out I'm 10 they say " do you eat at all meanwhile I'm literally eating as there talking to me I just can't gain any weight....
I’m like 14 and only Weigh like 80 pounds
Why is this accurate
Do you weigh yourself in KG?
I mean, I also suffer from 6 but that might be because we're white
I'm skinny because of a health issue (cell disease) funny part is everyone around me knows about my problem but still makes fun about me and judge me insults me lol 🤦‍♂️
“i can’t dance” proceeds to be the best dancer i’ve ever seen
This dude is funny!
Ok to be fair my little sister who is tiny and thin AF literally had to hold onto my backpack to keep from being blown away in the wind. (She is 14 and still has this problem).
Lol I’m fat and still can’t dance. There’s for sure struggles with people naturally skinny and naturally fat. Society shouldn’t judge anyone’s bodies anyways because when we are old we all will most likely have bad bodies
Play DDR
It is f***** up to say put some meat on your bone or get more to eat cause my family been saying that same exact line to my cousin until he became overweight and after awhile he decided to do it again and said he isn't going to listen to that line again and told my family that too.
Jayus saying she can’t dance is a lie. She clearly has moves
Jinx
I don't blame her I can't dance either.
I was skinny my whole life, I'm finally kinda overweight actually (could stand to lose like 20lbs) but I'm so tall, you'd never know I was overweight. I don't feel cute in 2 piece swimsuits anymore, but everyone around me thinks I'm nuts for wanting to lose weight. The only people who understand are my side of the family and my husband. Everyone else says I'm fine, but I know how out of shape I am and I see my dad's weight struggle and I just wanna get to healthy weight again cuz I don't wanna have health problems like that. Especially when I already deal with colitis
This is true.
And when people do this thing👌to your wrist😅 I was in the locker room one time when one of the girls there told me that I'm tiny •v• I wasn't upset about that or anything, but I was just a little shocked at how straightforward she was when she said that😂
People dont see problems and think we are lucky being skinny we have just as many problems as bigger people and i agree thats fucked up to say to a kid
Bruh im 12 im skinny as hell and people say tjat stuff like your gonna fly away in the wind sometime and shit like that
I think the can't dance part only applies to white people
Relatable
I have this exact same issue. Like, I'm full grown and at most have weighed 110 lbs. And no matter what I do I can't gain any weight, and it sucks being cold all the time! Especially when my mom can't control her internal thermometer and keeps it 65 degrees in the house even in the middle of winter. Bumping into stuff hurts, I can't go on long car rides because it hurts my butt, and(I'm fairly certain this is connected to the lack of meat on my bones) going to the bathroom for five minutes numbs the entire flower half of my body
Okayy but that is so true 💀
Bro all of these are so true, especially the clothes not fitting part. I have really long legs but my waist is so skinny I have to either settle for super baggy pants that fall down or pants that are too short
oh finally, skinny shaming and other problems are a thing too people
Yeah, I faced the same thing growing up. Was always called skinny or weak. But I started doing calisthenics and I am gaining weight now. And because it is calisthenics, the weight gain is pretty much just muscles. By working out, your confidence in yourself goes up.
U can punch holes in a belt??????
I thought this was just me
I can relate to all of these lol
I can confirm 3 and 4. I moved to a colder state and started getting pernio.
No cap
Seriously though
On the plus side some of us   flexible af
Not being able to cuddle because our bones are hard and uncomfortable especially when we try to sit on people laps and our ass bones hurt the person we are sitting on.  This realization hit me a few nights ago in the middle of the night and I started crying
In my late teens early 20's, I would go to my friends houses and their moms would make me food. Even if I had just eaten they would make me eat. I am old now and still skinny.
Omfg ty 😂😖🔥this is me
I bet you haven't accused to have tuberculosis
The society thing is so true even tho im not skinny i had a close friend who was and she always got _compliments_ abt how she can eath whatever the f she wants and bs like "u need to eat more" it ALWAYS affected her
Yeah
I’m a skinny af and I’m like the only person that doesn’t get cold~
As a skinny person I can confirm
as a skinny person that in summer was in front of a heater for most of june, i can relate about the always cold thing.
I've been told that when I was younger too. My grandma would always get onto me for being so skinny. Honestly, it was because of my meds I was losing a dangerous amount of weight. Bit, I'm pretty chubby now.
BRO IT SO FREAKING TRUE
I have so many of these problems that I didn't know was part of my skinniness
Same with the cold, the good thing is that its not that bad when it's 100+ outside when you have to work
oh don't forget the really uncomfortable shoulders
I can relate jm 63 pounds at 12
All of these are true
She's cute tho
I feel you girl
I’m both short and skinny lol
Felt
Same
Maybe the dancing one isn’t cause your skinny maybe it’s the white skin
My ass bones literally do hurt when sitting its like not even funny
Good dancing
I'm vegetarian so I'm sorry that I'm to skinny
I was a fat baby but then I was a skinny toddler but then I was a fat kid in primary but then I was a skinny kid as a teen and now I'm average but maybe a bit on the bulkier side so I can say I've experienced it all in terms of weight lol. Never really liked dancing though and also never really get cold even when I was skinny I liked cold weather and could handle it
Silly question but how the not being able to dance part related to being skinny...
YESS ALL OF THESE WERE ME GROWING UP UNTIL RECENTLY 😂😂
5 is accurate, my grandma is still comparing me to other kids😐
Yeah yeah for sure, I can't dance because I'm skinny, that's what it is...
But amazing dancing skills
Relatable
This is kind of unrelated, but how come whenever somebody says they use any pronouns, they're only referred to by they/them or the gender they were born with, and nobody uses the opposite gender's pronouns?
Dancing skill +100
I relate to this on a spiritual level
U will break I half in the wind, birds will fly u, ugh !!! Eat something I haven't got a lot as I do eat shit ton but sometimes have even gotten that
Yea i can 100% relate. ESPECIALLY having no insulation.
Poke new holes in ya belt I felt that
New name emily
How is not being able to dance a skinny people problem?
Jayus is beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
She is cute
Yeah as a child my entire family have been telling me to eat more meat and to fatten up and I was so cold so I once got a HUGE hoody like twice the size of me and I still use it XD
I'm skinny. And I hate when we are in summer and I'm cold af. With a hoddie and still cold. People looking at like wtf it's summer
I don't have those problems and as a person with very VERY low self confidence, it makes me feel depressed
Welp now I know it's not as bad being fat
Same girl
I feel This
so relatable </3
You need to do tall person problems
It is nearly impossible finding 28w 34l pants. I have literally been told that I look straight out of Auschwitz.
Wym you can’t dance? Those were godly dance moves
As a fat person I can’t relate
My dumb-ass I used to be  303 now 135 and totally appreciate that whole your ass hurts when you're sitting down thing is frfr lol
I have Problem 1, 2, 4 and 5 to. 6 not, because I dont do it at all XD
And the ,,You can’t eat that” because it’s tOo MuCh for your skinny body
I can eat almost one kilogram of hamburger in one meal yet I weigh 125lbs with a height of 5'10". I am a twig.
I havent had the belt one but the rest if fuckin real
Omg😂 love your dance moves Call me anytime  We'll go out freak dancing together !
LITERALLYYYY OMGGGG I’m 13 going on 14 and weigh about 88-90 pounds and I understand all of this 😭
Tall and skinny? Good luck finding pants , but hey, for $70, there are some that may fit if you buy them online.
Your a graetevdancer
FINALLY A VIDEO I CAN 100% AGREE WITH. I'm 6'2 and medically skinny
The amount of times people told me I’m really skinny thinking it was a complement instead I would go home and cry about it.
I love you
No no you can dance .. just not very well
Relatable
I suffer from all of these and I’m skinny too
You are sooooo funny. Odd in a girl.
Skinny people problems am I right  I'm just gonna cry here in The corner
Strong winds legit freak me out, I do feel like I'll get blown away with them at times. Not something logical for a grown adult to think, yet I do! 😳😬😰
I felt this. I just now started gaining weight but that's only due to working out vigorously for a year or two lmao
No you just White
We feel ya dude 😅
Friendly reminder: Any comment about a body that isn't yours is fucked up and uncalled for. Even if you think it is a compliment, if it involves the specific structure of one's body just don't say it. :)
I relate to this way too much
My dad always told me I would blow away in the wind and always ask me if I ever eat at home and I'm 9
I have fat people problems, hehe, I'm in danger
So one: im sorry you went through that and two: my friends always cling to mw during winter cause I can go outside without a coat on and still be warm but I know what it feels like to be judged on what you look like
The being cold one is definitely true. I used to think that it was normal to almost always be cold, but after going it the gym for 7 months and gaining 25 lbs, I’m hardly ever cold
Same
Yes being skinny is weird
“I do eat a lot, I just have high metabolism” - Me everytime someone says I’m skinny and should eat something
Nah I say you're beautiful
Those dance moves🤣
The worst thing is what people say to you for being skinny☹️
That was some too good dancing honestly atleast better than me and I’m too terrible
I can relate!
Have the Same problem, i just can‘t gain much weight
I’m skinny aswell, I can’t dance, and I eat so much I SHOULD HAVE MEET ON MY BONES BUT “NOOOO”
Im 8 and your the same weight as me
I mean… that was some pretty fire dancing let’s be real 👀😂
I RELATE
Love the jeans
Why tf is she was standing in the sink
I can't relate but it seems harsh for people to go and say "go eat something , do you even eat?" im more like thicc but waist aint the big either
These are all so sadly relatable..
Bro this is very true I'm small and skinny and it SUCKS
Same
As a skinny person I can say is this is factual
Bullshat you dance like thr wind that breaks you in half
Hey your not the only one that can’t dance. I feel you there
#teamseas
U just did my life every flipping day
Im a skinny teenager who likes to go out in skinny jeans or something during winter
You get me
I died when she danced🤣🤣🤣
i feel your pain  I am always cold
Felt.
The dancing part I believe comes from being white, I was never skinny nor was I fat but I can’t dance for shit
Everyone in this country has more than two chins so they don’t understand and pick on skinny kids lmao
The dancing is just a u problem girl:)
I am happy that I am a pretty big guy
Its the same in the bath like ny elbows get in the way
I still don’t know if that person is a girl or boy 🧐
My high school girlfriend thought she was going to break me
All of this hits hard I'm 15 and 115 pounds lmao
These aren't real problems.
I'm really skinny and have all of the problems and just had a  big mc donsmeal
Damn I hate and love that I’m skinny
Squats for ass. WhimHoff for body heat. Squats for ass to assist holding up pants, or just wear a dress. Women of the past didn't have the hurt but problem because they padded the butt. Comments from others builds character. Dancing is a perishable skill.
No one can dance
Bro I feel you I’ve been like this my whole life I’m a freshman in high school and I only weigh 70lbs
Wait other people's sitting bones don't hurt when you sit on hard surfaces?
Last one is relatable
Same
I was a skinny male growing up who could never gain weight. I went to work for a moving company and that helped me to gain mass, plus it pays really good. I would recommend that to the skinny men.
Omg. So true, I totally Relate to all of these
YESSSS, SOMEONE SAID IT!!!
I still wish I was as skinny as you
"fucking twig"🤩
I can relate to, but for me it's worse, I'm what people call skinny fat, meaning parts of my body are thin while other parts are fat. Meaning I have to deal with both skinny problems and some fat problems! 😡
The last one is probably just u
the clothes, the cold, the comments too true
Beautiful dance
Yep skinny people are so oppressed   Shut up
Confirmed
The last point seems more like a you problem, not a skinny problem. 🤣🤣🤣jkjkjk
My mom is like this and EVERYBODY comments about it even the doctors. The doctors when we live treats my family like crap when my mom is the nicest girl out of her sisters.
Sitting makes dents in my legs because I’m chubby, laying on my belly pushes the fat into my ribs and stomach and other stuff like that
I’ve been skinny since I was a kid and my whole family kept on telling me those types of stuff now that’s why I’m insecure now
Abby: We should chat! (Dance Moms)
As a person who has always been skinny and only grows longer I can relate on a personal level
As a thin person I can relate
OMG this is so me, everyone tells me in so skinny and I need to eat more. And don't even get me started with the belts. Everytime they don't fit I just tighten them as much as possible and then tuck them into my shirt.
Man it a small world so true
Nah im fat and i still get SO FUCKING COLD and i still dont have any weighted blankets and i never get colds 😲
I don't know i think you can dance pretty good 😏 🤣🤣
Lol or when someone goes to hug you and they’re like “I feel like I’m gonna break you!!!” 😑😑😑😑
This happens to me all the time
Oh that’s why I can’t dance …
That’s me
As a skinny person I can relate, I just want some blubber :(
I always thought i was unlucky to not have a high metabolism and be "Fat" but after a while I learned that I problably still wouldn't have been happy.
The dancing 😭😭💕💕
“I can’t dance” That might just be a you problem 😂
I finally found out what gender you were I am now at peace
You dance a lot better then i could ever could
School is terrible after a while I just stand up and stop using the chair because it hurts so bad
I don't know what you talking about I'm fat and the belt still doesn't fit me is always too long
Cant forget about the spine when you lay on your back   Ow
Same
Same here I’m 13 and 67 pounds
I used to be cubby and got skinny almost 2 years ago and this LITERALLY describes everything that happened before i started gaining healthier weight 😂🤣
Aren’t you also very tall? Most tall people I know are also skinny. The ones who aren’t and are fat REALLLY had to work at it   Edit: tall to me that is. I’m 5’9 and I’m 6 feet depending which shoes I wear that day lol
Those is some smooth dance moves bruv
I think the last ones just a you problem
If Pete Davidson was a woman
Yeah while being a kid many people tell you that you re very skinny and that you dont eat A guy still tells me im smaller than his hand or he compares me to small things
As someone thinner than those Oreo thins I can 100% agree
I got cursed with my grandpa’s fast metabolism. People say it will catch up to me. He was 80 and skinny as fuck when he died. I weigh so little the doctors could kill me if they give me the wrong dose. And I can’t take kid’s medicine because it doesn’t work. And people always tell me to eat more. I’m 17 and I have the skinny problems. And I’m alway so fucking cooooold.
I’m too skinny
It’s hard for me 😅
Lucky
Yep thats nothing close to fat girl problem, i wish i would be fat for 1 day
Bro the belt one actually a tragedy for me, had to work in jeans, but the jeans were too big. Ok, got a belt, gotta make a new hole. How the hell do I make a new hole, tried a knife, tried a hole puncher, but nothing, just some circular marks. So work was fun that day.  Not to mention I have pectus excavatum, which just adds to the skinny factor. My friends are like, hey, are you hungry? And I'll just be standing there with my rib cage fully visible like, no I'm stuffed man.
Currently I am 12 and I usually trick or treat on Halloween and I couldn't decide what to be for Halloween and my mom was like "you should just be a scelencton because you won't need a costume'
I don't think the dance one pertains to only skinny people. I can't dance for shit
All of these are actually true
Fast Metabolism
When you call someone skinny, it's a 'compliment' When you call someone fat, it's bad......  What's the difference
Im skinny and i cant dance either i feel you!
If you asked my mom, she would say I eat ALOT but I don’t gain a single pound and if I do, I lose it immediately. So yes, I can relate 🥲
*someone skinny shaming me* *me fat shaming them back* Everyone: "not cool bro, they can't help it"
I am so skinny. This is my entire life
But the rhythm is there if you had a dance moves it would be great👍😁
I'm skinny but I have high tolerance for heat and cool
Ur in America r8? I thought every weirdo r protected there!  😂
I have all these same problems an my mom yells at me for it
Your kinda lucky tho I'm a 13 year old fat ass I weigh 200 pounds
Pop off
Imagine being fat
Yup,  pretty much.
Ok umm. I can fully relate to this. If I’m in a   onesie, covered in blankets, and have my oodie on, I’m still feeling like Antarctica. There is no way I will ever be able to dance. People always ask, “did you eat today?” And I normally ignore the question because the answer would be no. And if I did eat it’s a very small amount. I’m only about 60.0 pounds. Everybody else I know is either way younger than me and are half my weight, or the same age as me and weigh 75.0-156.0 I can still pick up my friends easily but I’m just a weak lil dude.
I hate the cold one so much.
Damn boii she got moves !!  As a semi-skinny myself i can totally relate . Also you dance a lot better than me .
I really would like you to share if you are a girl that like to dress up more boyish or if you are transgender or agender or gender-neutral cross-gender. You don't share a lot of your personal life it would  be great if you did
But our power is eating a five course meal in front of our big friends and still lose weight.
Dirty bulk is the answer
I felt that :’>
Confirmed.
All of those are me lmfao
i fall under the middle of the spectrum, so i sometimes get the worst of both worlds- like for example, i’m sometimes unable to lay down on hardwood floors because my ribs would get bruised; but in “society”, people tell me to lose some weight, i’m fat, even my own mom told me that i was overweight despite being healthy.  (not to mention dysphoria too)
And you get hot very fast
I have those problems except for the dancing part.  I can dance😂
Thank you finally.
Make a video about how you gained weight please
Oh my god too relatable
Me being skinny and short feeling all these but x10
I am also skinny and this video is so relatable
I'm skinny just like you, I hate the comments that people say, I get that I'm skinny, I try to eat, I actually eat a lot, I just don't gain weight, well,
That dance. Tho….tis epic
"I can't dance" Oh I beg to differ
IM SCARED YOU'LL BREAK IN THE WIND I CSMT BREATH 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂 ALSO NICE DANCE MOVES
I was so skinny that I got a virus because of how skinny I was 🤧😭
Definitely dances like a white girl. I do too lol
It’s so true
This girl is 6,2 can you guys believe this ....
I wish that i could get so weight of of my waist and my belly then i would look like my dream body
the inability to dance comes from ur height bro lmaooo
So relatable!
Last is just white people problems /j
Best dance moves ever whatchu mean
Jesus…so that’s why my ribs always hurt💀 I legit sleep on my stomach 9 times out of 10!!! I’ve been thinking my lady has been getting some cheap shots in while I sleep😂😂😂🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
Bro you dance better than me
Same
I eat so much yet im still skinny
I finally broke 100 pounds, I'm still freakin skinny
This is so true
Ngl, those moves are smooth
I can't dance either it's all cool  Also yes I get cold very easily 😭😭  But I'm also short so all my friends have to look down to see me as well.... Love your videos
She isn't lying, i have a low metabolism and whenever it is -3 degrees and I am not cold. People are like, yo, you good? Some of my friends are so skinny you can see their rib cage and spine spikes. Sheesh 😬😳
I am the same… I’m 76 pounds AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA only I can DANCE
Yeah I think the last one is a you problem 😂
Good to know I'm not the only ones skinny
Love being roughly 12kg under the healthy weight needed for my height
No lies here
Same
"I'm so afraid you're gonna break on half the second a stiff breeze comes along" bro I kinda feel bad for saying all this when I was a kid now.
WHAT SPORT DO U PLAY? I PLAY VOLLEYBALL
FINALLY!!!
The bruised ribs are a problem though my friends sometimes think I’m being beaten by my parents i mean they are terrible people but they aren’t BEATING me
I can relate to all of this shit lol
I get it
"I cant dance"  Uhm- The dance moves I just saw were the Mona Lisa IN DANCE FORM
Are you married because you have a ring
i can relate to every one of these 😭  my family is always saying things like “You have no meat on your bones.” “You need to eat” “you look like a stick” “You go straight down like a door” etc..😅   then- when they do catch me eating they just tell me that i’m always eating, and that i’m fat 😬??   it sucks aha.- my mom has never said anything like that to me tho since she’s skinny as well and it’s hard for her to lose weight. She has been called names like that as a kid and as a adult and knows how it feels so yeah 🥲.  (it’s mostly my grandma and my older sister calling me those names and just family members who i don’t even know that well)
I understand I will break in the wind
I've been called BAMBOO my whole life
Being skinny can suck sometimes but I’m glad I’m skinny
Jayus: No insulation Me: *Laughs in Fat*
Literally my life I'm 10 year old I'm only around 60 pounds which is concerning for my age cause I should start gaining weight and eat since I'm growing. I just don't eat that much I guess
Girl you can dance better than me
I have a huge stomach but high metabolism and I don’t gain weight and I’m 12 and weigh 62   pounds
I am fat as fuck and I can't dance
Feel that
Das fax
Im skinny af ,but ive gotten into a healthy weight, but km never cold, im just always hot
Plus size problems tho
Your dog must like what the crap
From Someone that weight 34 fucking kilograms this video is relatable
I feel that I have fats metabolism and I am only 6:00 stone or pound idk I'm british
I went down to 120 and the cold was an issue lol. I'm the type of person to not get cold but when I lost 50 lbs basically I was super cold even in my house. However I rather take being 120 than 170 any day
you cant dance? those clips beg to differ
Sittning down is a problem yes
All of it happens to me yet i wanna stay skinnny...
You explained me and I got bullied because of it and the comments keep going and I'm in middle school so there really mean
i mean your dance moves are pretty groovy
dance 💀
Everyone can dance       Just not well
I think the dancing thing is just you tho 😂 I love your videos tho
As a skinny person, this is very accurate. My cloths actually never fit me , and people make comments about my body 💀
Loving the dance moves.. I mean at least you tried ish
I am so skinny too and i can confirm all these things
I can’t dance either
Same gurlllll
My sister is skinny and PPL say stuff like do you eat and whatever 😐
I've been skinny all my life. At age 11, I only weighed 73 pounds
Lol that's how I am I'm super skinny
My dad won't stop asking me if I'm anorexic and won't stipe threating to take me to one of those places that help with eating disorders and it's really pissing me off becuase no matter how much I eat I'm still built twigggy
man im the same
"Can't dance" tf you mean you can't dance, you're fucking getting lit
I mean I'd gladly trade with you....I'd rather be stupid skinny than struggle to get off the weight like I do now because slow metabolisms a pita.....
Can't relate
wait are you 66 pounds?
*Laugh in chubby*
Why is her dancing the same as my dancing
Dont worry i cant dance either :)
I'm just like you
I can't dance either
Aye,skinny ain't got nothin to do with dance my friend. We can do it  👌🏽
I'm as fat as watermelon 😂😂
As a fellow thin being, I was waiting for someone to understand the struggles
yeah that’s...that’s honestly accurate
Now for fat people…
No more holes. Get a Groove Belt 🙃
I'm a fat dude and I dance exactly like that. Just be you.
“Can’t dance”, me dancing the skeleton
That stomach I need it
THIS IS TOO TRUE-
You forgot the one where people will go up to you and put there thumb and pinky around you wrist and say “oMg YouR sO sKInY”
The dancing one I feel you although I’m not skinny I’m over for my age but one good thing is that I’m tall still can’t dance:)
Felt that (including the not being able to dance)
Thats why she didnt choose to become a dancer tiktoker she chose to be a phsicolgist facts ones
So true
Literally me lol. One time i had to sit in a chair at school for 5 FRICKEN HOURS because of a big test, and my butt was in soooo much pain.
I thought the last one was just a white person problem
Me too...   Me too...
LOL you dont know but life being fat is more depressing.
My barber told me the other day that It looks like I don’t eat but I thought i was fat. So I guess that’s a complement 🤷‍♂️
Same when i was younger but now I'm starting to gain fat. Still can somewhat suck in my stomach to see ribs but not that much.
And your still good looking soooo chin up and rock on
Aw boo hoo, you are skinny, so sad 😥. I'd rather have all of these then the problems that come with being fat.
I can't dance either, but that looked amazing
We the same😌
I feel dat doe
I am skinny, but It was worse until I started having beer for a while.
As a skinny person, i agree with the whole list
Accurate.
that dance bussin' tho 😏
I feel all of those,  Im SOOO skinny
FAT PEIPLE PORMS P
That hit hard
The belt is #1 on the list
as a super skinny person i felt this
me who’s overweight and is extremely insecure about it 🧍🏻‍♀️
Same tho
I feel this in every fiber of my being....  Edit: except for dancing I actually can but I always wanted to breakdance but it's kinda painful to do so due to being a sheet of fucking plank.
I relate to this so much
As a larger person... I can't dance either.
Same
Fire moves! 🔥
“I cant dance” *proceeds to dance 200x better than i can*
It just blows my mind, that there are people who are too skinny, and have problems like sitting comes with hurting butt problems, and then there are people, like me, who just like look at food, and gain weight instantly. 😐
I wish i could be skinny being 6ft 10 in tall and being 275 pounds f ing sucks but my health weight is 270
What do you mean you CAN’T DANCE!? That was beautiful!
Wait!  That’s how I dance!! Does this mean I can’t dance ???
Me. But American and with tiktok which I'll probably never use. Lol 😆I'm from England
This is my life in a video 😅
This is all true
Wait ar you a girl or boy
I think not dancing is uh not a skinny person problem
Says Can’t Dance: tf bro I’m fat as h*ll and my dance is like flopping on the ground
Jesus christ, Jayus, first you give me life advice, and now you're being relatable, do you NOT want me to be aromantic?!
I feel you sis
I'm skinny and also I never get told the jokes but everything the same I wear small stretchy pants
Factsssss
Please don't use the lords name in vain
SAME- BUT MY PARENTS CALL ME FAT-
I am super skinny
Im like super skinny and this is just super relatable
I am extremely skinny and i make the jokes
I'm skinny as well and I can still dance
I can relate so much it hurts. "You look like a stick"
God why is this sooooo freaking relatable???😂
Stop posting you racist woman
I grew up VERY skinny and was like that until about 20 years old and I got the same exact comments from the time I was about 5, which is so screwed up
In your defense I can't dance and I'm fat
soooo true
I am not skinny but my dad is and guess who got my dads genes.....my sister and brother! My brother can eat the whole Thanksgiving Meal (if he wants to beacause he complains constantly) and we could probably lose a pound! My sister is the ice cream queen so she has been gaining pounds.
The “I can’t dance” girl you dance better than me
As a skinny guy, these are true
I’m skinny too don’t feel bad
I don't understand be happy weight or be sad that I am fat
Thats some pro dancing move right there
True I’m 10
Ngl that's some pretty good dance moves!
FINNALY SOMEBODY I CAN RELATE TO
My friends literally gave me the nickname skeleton. And I've never been a big eater so It's like impossible for me to put on fat.
OK, so relatable on a UNBELIEVABLE level. Damn. My parents say I can blow away in the wind and am lighter than a crisp packet
I had people tell me to save up fat from any meat we cooked and drink it at the end...
Same man same ngl I can't dance either I look like you when dancing
i went to a friends house and they kept it at 60 degrees fahrenheit i was about to freeze
I’m very tiny so…
Suspenders
You way how much- *sigh* time to go on another diet-
Better than me
Why is it so true though- I am just a heavy stick. I EVEN EAT A LOT BUT I STILL SEE NO CHANGES XD
To be fair that dancing thing may just be a white person problem
So ur a girl
Dude you are still skinny 😔
i felt this. people say shit about my eating everyday EVENTHOUGH I EAT ENOUGH AND THEY KNOW FULL WELL I DO.
I wish I was that skinny but I only have a bunch of fat
5th point (society) is so true, no matter what your figure or shape is, they will always taunt you every damn time, so fuck society comments and LOVE YOURSELF 💜!
Lmao I’m not fat but I’m not overly skinny but it hurts when I do sit-ups because my  spine hits the ground before my back ‘^’ can anyone relate?- please tell me I’m not the only one-
As a 46kg 15 yro, I can relate
Dancing has nothing to do with you being skinny. You just don’t have rhythm.
Goddamn thank god im not that fat and not that skinny
The last reason is becose ur white
tf these are too relatable, although I don't really get cold (inherited that shit from my dad lol), and I don't reall care about the pain whe sitting down and laying down. I always got the comments lol, and I eat a lot, far more than the average person, I just burn it faster and use it for growth I gues, I don't really get the comments anymore, but that's because I built a bunch of muscle. the pants falling down shit, fuck that dude, why are pants made for people with a mid-section diameter of 3 meters
I’m 6ft and 100 pounds this is so relatable
You forgot that pain can hurt like hell
“[I cant dance]” NO THATS JUST EVERYONE
Eat, Burgir.
Awww.
What about back lumbago
I don’t know about the can’t dance part. One of the seniors in my high school is skinny as hell and he has some moves.
I’ve been trying to gain weight forever now I need help!!!!!!
Thank God im fat
I can relate to so many of these
I got a small ratchet belt so i didnt have to deal with the holes
You just discoverd the life of my body :')
I don't know what it feels lile being a skinny person as I am fat as FUC--
Oh that's a skinny people problem, I thought my son just had bo rythem in dancing
Some really muscled people also have this, it isn't necessarily being skinny, just a low body fat percentage
change the room half the degrees and I can tell the difference🙂😢
Omg that is so true for me
I just want to say they make intertwining belts were you can put the skike thing anywere
Just have Protiens & exercise
Can't dance! You dance better than any person I know!!!
Kool dancing bro you can do  da moonwalk with Michael jackson
Bro your dance moves are ten times better than mine
Relatable till last year 🤣
That is so trueeee
I am a tall skinny person and I approve this message 👍
I think the last one was a you problem I am just saying I am not trying to offend someone
Being skinny sucks😖😖😖😖😖... I'm skinny too...
I can't even get skinny but I have these problems except the pants. And yes I'm 9
I understand the struggles for skinny people but I can’t be any sort of skinny and I get bullied constantly so love you self and your body
Just floss
This hits the heart
Same
1 and 2 i can relate to pretty much anything i can do leaves bruises although i look skinny as fuck im not
They told me to get fatter little did they know I could eat a whole fuckung pizza and including a meal with fries and 2 burritos
Ur so annoying
I'm in the exact same situation
Yassssss…
TvT so true
The last thing can be helped
Society: OMG Do YoU eAT Me: WELL IM ALIVE AREN’T I!
I don't get it, I would never take offense being called skinny I'd take that as a compliment
The society one 😭
Super thin too. Around 5'9" as of high school, 102 lbs. I feel this.
Hooo boy, this is your most relatable video so far lmao.  I've gone through all of these myself, no exceptions.
Only we know 😥😥😥
Can I ask something is he a girl or a boy or what because I don't if even a gay I have no problem with that I just wanna know
When you're chubby and have all of these problems: 🙂 *this is fine*
I can really relate cuz EVEN IF I EAT *E V E R Y T H I N G* IN THE DAMN HOUSE AND I JUST HATE HOW JUDGEMENTAL SOCIETY REALLY IS IT ALL STARTED FROM MY MOM AND THEN SOCIETY AND THEN I GO DEEP IN DEPRESSION like do they not see they are doing this to a damn 4 years old AND YET IT STILL HAPPENING IM LITERALLY 11 YEARS OLD NOW AND IT WON'T STOP LIKE HOW DO I FIX THIS DAMN PROBLEM onlyjayus can u please find a way to fix this cuz I can't find a solution to get out of - anxiety, depression, stress and insults.......='^
Nice one 😎
true
I fell u with the dancing I just can’t dance lol
same jayus, same
Those dance moves though  Immaculate
No it's just u can't dance (no harm)
I'm still under weight of the avarage 10 year old (70 pounds) so only good thing I know is that diets don't have to exist due to if you had one you would die of skinny
Ya get told to eat more then when you gain weight you're fat
I'm with you I'm skinny
Feel it tho
Jayus I actually think your dance moves are FABULOUS 🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSS! The ass bone! The cold! The pants!
Me have fat prolem and im only 12 year old  1. Runing I run very slow because of the weight  2. Tired I feel more tired because of the weight   But i have one thing that im good at is almost dont get cold and in reverse i Feel hot to ducking fast
Me to
“Can’t dance” nah you did better than me
Hittin walls etc also hurts like hell and my fingers never work good because they are fuckin cold and i can get blue hands at like room temperature
Im a boy and im skinny as hell since 13 now im 20 so you can imagine or might feel about my mental health 😊
I'm very skinny And I fucking love it
LMAO that "you gotta put new holes into your belt" thing I FELT THAT
okay worst one, i’ve been small my whole life but was hUGELY skinny as a child and my school called child protective services bECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I WAS BEING STARVED. I WAS JUST SKINNY
Please provide solutions for it
Honey I cant dance either
Sucks to suck 😌
Wow I um feel targeted
I'm actually really skinny like all of my tight shirts are baggy on me but I have an hour glass body figure so I don't really get those comments but I can't lay on my side on the ground because of how much it hurts
I am relate
How did you solve it tho? I have literally the same problem and as much as I eat my wight doesn't change at all
I'm still told that evn tho I've grown up n gained quite a bit 😕
I know that I’m 10 in 5 th grade and I weigh 57 lbs oh did I mention i’m almost six  foot so  it’s not that I’m short  lol. And yes I can’t gain weight
Dies of cringe
Was that weight accurate
Relatable 😔
Same to me
I know some people who are skinny and dance pretty good actually you might be able to pull of crazy stunts because your skinny
Bro why all those so true and I’m only 13 but still felt every word to heart
If i lay down my chest feel like getting pushed
I'm a 6 ft 1 man who is weighed 150 lb my whole life and literally my muscle mass when to my legs
I'm feeling you
I feel that everyday because I'm skinny
Society is probably the worst one when you're a kid people are still the same amount of judgey as they are when you're a teenager or adult  Like people be like " Ohh your too skinny doesn't your mum feed you?" Or "gosh tell your mum to give you less/healthy food and put you on a diet or your gonna die from your fat" like yeah that is very terrible to say to a person
Ye this is so true accept for the cold one cuz for some reason I don’t get very cold
Same here... I've always thought I was fat  when I could see my stomach wasnt flat
I have a story 1 time when I was in the 3rd grade and I was fat when some one from the 4rd grade says me this when I was eating alone in the park "hey fat pig go on a diet idiot" Then I was crying Lol😂 the the 4rd grader just left like it's not harsh for a 3rd grade like bro I just can't then my best friend just got to the park and ask me about the situation and then tell him every thing the idk how he beat the heck out of him like he was skinny as a skeleton like how did he do that the fourth grader was like 146cm and my friend was like 134cm and then I heard a screaming girl I was like wth was going on what I saw was not a girl but the 4rd grader I was laughing so so hard that fell and my friend just left him and says let's play Mario cart so casually and then we became best friends even from this day Damn ngl he was so cool and the I go in to a diet and then for 2 years I finally have a healthy weight
Style on u
Bro the real problems I weight 120 it sucks I have very high  Motabolism so I really don't gain weight even if I workout, and it's really hard to attract women as my body type even if I start working out and actually gain weight I'm looking for a healthy weight but more of a muscular lean body type
I feel this! In PE we were swimming and I was the only one who thought the water was cold, and I said “why is the water so cold” and someone said “because you’re skin and bones” that hurt so much. People don’t realize that being skinny isn’t really good
Gotta drop a like for that dance
i feel blessed because i have a thicc and i mean thicc butt my underwear doesn't fit my behind i'm not overweight i'm the ideal weight but my bunda is just big
Accurate
Like why, people think its fine to just say that. AND I'M SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY EATS EVERYTHING I SEE 😭. Yet I'M skinny
Number 5 is so true. Stop saying that to children.
I weigh more than jaus        And I'm 12
1 yes 2 yes  3 yes   4 yes  5 yes  6 yes Wtf is this so accurate
Looked like some fire dancing to me
“ ... can’t dance ”  kpop idols: baby i’m not even here, i’m hallucination  edit — the replies are kinda disappointing ngl
All facts I'm 21, 6 foot and 125lb and it's alwase cold and everything hurts you got no padding
So thats why im always in my dressingdown and blanket
Well... still you are Flat....
Lol I kinda feel bad for jade my body weight is perfect ,damn jade also you dance better them soul could
can't relate to any of this :(
32 kg?
like hearing my life story
Hahaha u should've looked at me I looked like a living clothes hangar or a Halloween skeleton prop🤣🤣  Everybody kept pressing me to eat eat and then I developed an ED 😑😬
Oh my gosh this is so relatable!! Everybody who sees me for the first time is like “ omg can i put my hand around your wrist???!” (Which they can with space to spare) but like bro
Having to puncture holes in my belt 'cause it doesn't fit is a pain.
You dance pretty good.
That last one is on you
Lmao when you gotta poke holes in the smallest belts 😂
I used to be so skinny that I can see my rib bones clearly But I ate lots of snacks everyday  I started eating ice cream every single day from 12-14 yrs old then I got back to normal
Omg same💅😩💅
STOP IT PLEASE LIKE JAYUS STOP STALKING ME
It’s even worse when your skinny and tall af, it really feels awkward. People look at you cause ur tall, AND THAT YOUR SKINNY AF. I H8 it
I feel that I'm also really skinny and I get bruises on my ribs too 💀, but I'm always cold bro
Finally someone who understands me 😭😭
That dance was swag
I agree
Omg ikr? I’ve never been skinny skinny but I’m not that much higher than underweight and I hate the heat but I get cold so easily so I can never find a good middle ground
I relate 👌
I feel that
I grew up with the impression skinny people were perfect (I'm a tad bit chubbier than average), and parents always compared me and my classmates like   "Oh look at how skinny they (Classmate) are! Why can't you be as fit as them?" Or "Wow look how healthy she (Me) looks, why can't you be like that?" (Coming from skinny friends' parents)  Both of us would always look at them like why the heck would you say that to your children, then we'd feel guilty about it and we'd start doing things at recess like skip meals or eat an unhealthy extra amount of food and end up skipping school the next day  Still happens, we hate it
A wise young man would marry this woman because when they get older and his buddies wives are all fat and gross his wife will be hitting her prime in her 40s and looking fine as hell.  Tall women with long legs can do awesome things in the bedroom.
I can relate
I saw a Reddit thread with everything she said in order, she kinda just read it like a script
Another skinny person problem: a lot of the time when I relax, I can feel my ribs on my skin and it feels weird. Sometimes I just blame small clothes I wear.
Me also being skinny asf: Ok, but why is this so true?
same bruv.
So true
Now I know why my moms trying me to eat more
I agree 👍
Relatable
Bro same my dancing looks like a skeleton destroying itself and I hate the sitting down and laying down and my classmates make fun of how I’m almost 36 pounds below 100 pounds
You would be a good ballet dancer! 😁
Makes sense, all those happen to me
I was almost 160 pounds and then I got sick and lost 40 pounds so now I’m 120. LET ME TELL YOU THE THING ABOUT BEING FREEZING ALL THE TIME IS TRUE. it’s fucking true and it’s annoying
I beg to differ on the dancing one
why do you wear shoes insideee😲😭😭
This is accurate
Fun fact:"no one gives a fuck"
I hate being skinny
This still happens to me
I'm fat as fuck and I can't dance
i'm not THAT skinny but fr i have all those problems too wtf xD
Cute as hell.
Can relate.
Bruh, I am 13 and I'm only 75 pounds
Damn she at least tried to dance
Im fvckin fat
Bro not being able to dance cause of your weight is the worst thing ever 😂
As a skinny person can confirm all of this
people keep making fun of me lmao and one time a woman thought i was anorectic
It’s funny bc you can’t say anything to ppl about being overweight but nobody has any qualms about telling you to eat more or making fun of how skinny you are. Like can we just not?!
As a guy I was 80 lbs/ 36.2874 kilograms in the 10th grade. Very skinny. I was always skinnier than my younger brother. Until I started doing yard work sometimes and started buying myself food. Now I weigh  more than either of my 2 brothers and have quite a few more lbs. than I need.
Seriously not fitting clothes is a fat person problem to same for peoples comments also im seriously cold fast still
I was like that, no matter how hard I tried I wouldn't put on weight.
cant dance? proceeds to dance
I’m not only too skinny I’m so short that I look like I’m 8 (I’m WAY older than 8 I’m a teenager)
Me: and in gym when I do curl ups my spine hurst
And how to be skinny as f*** 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’ve also always been skinny and the cold one I can relate so fucking hard people will never understand
Also, I have to CUT my belts, otherwise they'd wrap twice (sometimes 2 ½ times) around my waist and THEN I poke the extra holes. Same goes for watches and bracelets.
Don't worry dancing is moving to the music
So I’m built the same way. And I eat all the freaking time! I guess my high metabolism is where all the food goes.
u dont get cold if u born cold
Laying on your stomach while being skinny and have big boobs is THE WORST.
Well now I know why I can’t dance
My sister has had that problem. I have the exact opposite
:((. Wait what does dancing have to do with being skinny
When you gonna follow through on the black creator thing?
Jayus: I can’t dance! Me: Your moves are impressive. I’ll give you that.
Bruh true
As a kid I was so bulled a lot cause I'm 20 pounds under weight
How are you so right
I thought everybody's ribs bruised when they lay down like that O_O
God bless and may Jesus lord be with you
At least your pretty. I Was in 6th grade and I was the thinnest guy in school. I was also not that good looking, which did help my confidence. I am now in my junior year and I still have a hard time putting on weight, but I finally made it on varsity to my wrestling team
I thought she was gonna tell a psychology trick to overcome being one
My respect for you has grown tenfold for posting those sick moves.
JAYUS:I can't dance Also continues to dance like a legend
My brother has this exact problem so I feel for my skinny homies.
I just started feeling this, used to be fat but then I slimmed up. This is facts
Belt doesnt fit, wear overalls...oh wait.
Duck you for being so accurate to my life
Can confirm the last one, skinny people can't dance, it just doesn't work
society is the worst like YEA BRO I REALLY HOPE I GET BLOWN AWAY BY THE WIND THAN LISTEN TO YOU
What do you mean you can’t dance!!!!???👀✨❤️‍🔥 YOUR DOING GREAT SWEETIE-soccer moms
When I was younger, about 6-7, people used to always tell me that I was skinny. I knew it at the time. They always told me that I was going to die early because I was so skinny. And I hope I proved them wrong because now I am 13 & 120 lbs.
DAMN WHEN SHE STATED THE POINTS,, FELT IT😩🤝🏻
yesss like you have to be 110lbs to donate blood and neither me nor my mum nor my grandma can donate blood, my family just has a really fast metabolism. i’ve also been told “oh, you’re all bones” “you’re a stick!” “you better start eating ice cream to gain weight” like bestie im tRYING
Same
My clothes NEVER fit They are too wide and too short
being fat and sitting down still hurts your ass bones. i would kill to be as skinny as you were / are
" go get some meat " I'll give you meat
U r awesome
Lmao my family used to call me a twig and I'd cry 😂 and then my friend at lunch would say "please eat" I think she thought I didn't eat but I eat ALOT yet I'm still skinny and also NOW U REALIZE why I used to wake up with bruises if I ever slept on the floor
I m 180 and 56kg. Keeping this for 3 years. Didnt grow taller or wider 🥲 i ll turn 20 soon…
I was skinny and then I decided to gain 75 pounds I’m still aiming for more
I feel this on a spiritual level
OMG TOTES RELATE
Not dancing isn't a skinny person problem....I'm obese and i can't dance....plus I'm white....whites can't dance
I feel ya I finally got a good weight 2yrs ago
I relate to this, as a really skinny person who eats alot I've had people ask me "How are you not dead" or "I could snap you like a twig 😂" and not to mention the fact I dont like any fruit or vegetables makes people say "How are you not fat" its hurts when we get comments like this
She speaking fact on fact
JAYUS I HAVE PAIN IN MY ACHILLES TENDON, HELP
What I hate is that it’s acceptable to say “oh your so skinny yo u should eat more” but not ok to say “your fat eat less” it’s a double standard both of which is body shaming
How tf is she only 66 pounds
Preach. I have a litteral problem gaining weight. Always get those comments. IM A FUCKING TEEN I HAVE ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT
The last dance move you had it-
Give me some fucking tip to get a good weight
You nice
Ya being a underweight kid or overweight is really not fun no body just leaves u alone about ur looks
I don’t know about the last part but damn that sucks
Nah your dancing is pog
THE MOST RELATABLE THING EVER
Being skinny is way better than being fat nobody likes fat
Shes right!
As a skinny person, I can confirm this..😂🤣
Their dance is soo good.....u are a good dancer mam
I'm tall and lanky, so sometimes when I'm moving my arms, I smash my elbows into my hips and it leaves me gripping my side for a solid minute, or hitting the 'funny bone' nerve unreasonably often
As a very skinny  person.  These are all relatable
I understand well the sitting one for me actually is just if I sit the wrong way but other then that I do understand especially society because once I went to the doctor and the doctor was like “She is really skinny...are you even feeding her?”
You can dance fine
As a fat person, I'm glad I'm starting to have some of these problems! But I'm still far from skinny. Well, don't get me wrong, I don't wanna be underweight, just thin enough. I just don't wanna be bullied and judged for my appearance. I know skinny people get bullied too, and I know it's far from fun.
You say you can't dance but those were some sick moves
I also got into a healthy weight this year. I've been trying for year i can only gain like 1kg but i will loose it after a month and this year i hained at least a kg within two months but i lost that weight within more than a week because of stress with school.
Number five is so true my friend says he could break my bones with a tap
Ur weight is perfect, ik it hurts sometimes, trust me, im overweight, and it hurts me to move, i have to poke new holes into my belt too, life is tough, but dont beat yourself up
Finallllyyyyyyyy someone said this. So fucking truee 😭😭😭😭
Relatable
This is so true, same troubles
Not every skinny person can't dance
This is extremely relatable for me
So that begs the question, can fat people dance
This video is my life story 😭
I was really skinny then I just stopped moving I just put a chair in the kitchen and boom
I know what you mean. Give us a soloution
This is happening to me everyday 😂😭
YES!!!! THIS IS ME 100%!!!!
I'm 1,85m and 58ish kg... I approve this video
Me after hearing people complain about being skinny: damn does it worth it to be skinny? Also me being insecure about my body and wanting to be skinny 🤡
I'm fat and I feel good that am not skiny
She sayin  I can't dance    Dose epic moves 🤣🤣😅😆
I am skinny myself I can really relate to this tf why I'm still skinny hahaha
Same for me I have a hella fast metabolism no matter what I eat it’s getting digested and I’m skinny again
You right. You can't dance! 😜
The most annoying comment is: You seem to have lost weight, what’s wrong with you, are you sick? Fucking leave me alone!🤬
I’m skinny, I just choose not to dance. I JUST CANT 😭
Jayus: 😀    Her dance: 👹👹💀💀🕺🕺💃💃
SITTING HURTS?? that sounds like a nightmare I'm so sorry😭 - a chubby girl
What do u mean you can’t dance?!
As a fat person i can confirm we can't dance either.
I can relate to everything she just said. My high metabolism prevents me from maintaining a decent amount of weight. And I am 54 now. And I am still skinny. Everything she said is true. However. Her dancing was not so bad.
You're  so beautiful just saying.
Nah U can DANCE
After a while I stopped feeling the cold I know that am but that’s because my hands go pale af
Same I'm also thin like u
Atleast your tall  Me:being fat since i was 6
These are the things that go through my mind in like a second when someone says"uhhh, you're so lucky,I wish I could be thin just like you"
I can’t dance is not a skinny person problem because I can’t dance and I’m not skinny
I’m skinny as fk but somehow my clothes always fit lul
You're the best dance I've ever seen
The last one is unfortunately not only skinny people problem
I love you Jayus 🤣🤣🤣
I eat a lot, a lot lot but still not gaining weight, I think I'm losing more weight 🙁
Lift. Get swole. Easy
"I can't dance" Sorry but I think thats on you😂😂😂
Yes very relatable, when I sit on a metal chair my spine pokes out and almost roles on it.. it feels so fricken weird and painful
I'm skinny asf sad times
I relate to that last one you know because I'm skinny not because i have two left feet
I Can eat an elephant and be the same weight.
Bro preach
YES so True my Clothes was never fit and i am freezing
...same
Now i know why my friend gets so easily gold outside
Almost everyone I meet after a long time goes “don’t they give u food at home?” I mean- how tf do I tell them how much of a foodie i am it just doesn’t effect me😂💀
Not going to lie, those were some pretty sweet dance moves
I am a skinny person, Im like 5 foot 9 and I'm 92 pound
I don't know what talking about, all I see i excellent dancing
Oh my goodness the " I'm so afraid you're gonna break in half in the wind" is my entire childhood
I’m a bit built for my age so I never new people like that have those problems.     Me: writes that down
I'm a16 year old boy, and im only 106 lbs. I have heard every insult there is
I feel this in my bones, i can eat whole cows and look like a skeleton, i will be 130lbs for my whole life 😢
So relatable with all of them
THAT WAS THE BEST DANCING SKILLS I'VE EVER SEEN
You know it’s funny bc most of this happened to fat ppl to
I'm skinny I'm skinnier than you
Not going to lie, those dance moves were the best things I've seen in years
When someone tells you need to put on some weight just tell them they are enough burden for mother earth
That true im very skinny
If I could I'd give you my fat  fit big guy I'm active but I can't loose weight to save my life
Me to
I am also underweight lol, im a literal stick
Mate all of this is true.. I suffer from being cold in winter.  Jayus: I can't dance! *Proceeds to dance* Me: mate they are the best dance moves I have ever seen!
Fuck fat shaming wut about skinny shaming
skinny here 😔
Me too kid me too might not be sure about the dance part
It’s so true
“I can’t dance”  *proceeds to do the greatest dance number I’ve ever seen in my life*
Oh damn same, I have been severly underweight for all my life... And these comments are annoying like hell yea I eat a lot, I just have a high metabolism rate, you have a problem? I can legitimately eat one whole pizza with risotto and salad. By myself and I'm a child. My sport is just extremely taxing and my high metabolism rate isn't helping ok Also the constantly cold one, I feel you, I live in an equatorial country and uhh my teachers often ask me if I'm feeling ok since it's constantly summer and gets pretty hot.
Never met a skinny person that can dance
Rrrrrrrrrrelatable!!!!!!!
Lmao i love you girl dw you are perfect as you are! And you 100% dance better then me
Mood
I'm not skinny, but i can't dance either
Actually you can danse MUCH BETTER than me..
When you're skinny despite eating twice as much as your friends
Don't worry girl i'm skinnier, 6 ft tall and a boy...
what kind of pants she wearin tho, that shit looks good
Ah! Alas,A society I belong in 🥲
Oh god- Oh This explains a lot now-
My family constantly tell me to eat more, but I do, I eat a metric crap ton, yet I barley gain any wait.
Oh my god never in my life has any video been this relatable
AYO THICCC SQUAD, DAP BE UPPP
I'm 6'3" and 9 stone. I understand this
Dude, a girl took me out to dance yesterday and i used to have a decent body so i knew how to dance. But now that im skinny as hell i just look like a skeleton trying to do the macarena, so it was catastrophic.
I can't relate 😔 I would consider myself average weight but I always feel like I'm really heavy. I would not  eat for days and exercise excessively, I feel guilty eating even anything. I did a bmi everyday but I'm still not satisfied with my result even though the test says I'm underweight. I sometimes wonder do I have body dysmorphia but the chance is very low
4 5 and 6 we fat People have the same problem ok? I many Times had to poke new holes in belt 5 society is making fun of us like crazy and we and dancing ou brother only move we know is earthquake because we drop on floor and kill every body else
I dont think being skinny is the problem with dancing tho-
I deffinitely feel you
I relate to everything except for the society and the cold one. Im just a ghost to most people ;) and i am used to the cold
I relate to allllllllll that
i can 10000000% relate.
Can’t relate I’m fat 🥱
You know u can think the bright side and be a model and you still can now, because I am a model and want to experience your problems and eat as many burgers as I want to😭
Don't tell me you can't dance, that's Michael Jackson's cousin right there
Are you a boy or a girl
relateable everybody makes fun of me in school
This is freaking accurate. LOL 😆
I think you are perfect no matter size/weight ❤️
Could probably pull of a good slow dance... Lol I don't know anything about dancing *trips off dance floor*
Fast metabolism ppl be like👁👄👁                                                        🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗 next day:weigh less than yesterday😩😩
Doctors asked my mother if I ate. Well, become a regional truck driver. That will cause you to gain weight, become pre-diabetic, and... Ok, don't do that.   Um, those dance moves look like they hurt you, your dance partner, and spectators. Stop it. Learn ballroom dancing, Detroit style
that hit home with a baseball bat🤷🏻‍♀️😂what can i say ig being small is the same for everyone
ITS SO TRUE WHEN I LAY DOWN ON THE CARPET I GET SPOTS AND BUMPS LEFTOVER
omg wtf how don't I knew that 💀
So relatable
I found a stretchy belt that's braided so you can have a hole anywhere and you won't actually have to like ruin the belt
Phahahahah it is what it is
So relatable
Broooo,I feel this,I've been skinny since grade 1,and tbh people telling me if I even eat are the worst,like bruhh idek who you are.
I can relate to 3 and 4 really well.
As a skinny person who goes to a dance club I can confirm I'm shit at it. But I also have more cold resistance than my mum and she's pretty overweight.
Yes oh my god yes it would be 80 degrees and I would still feel the chill in the air and I'm like can't anyone feel that.and ya if your naturally skinny never show up to your mexican Grandmas house cause she will....WILL!! STUFF YOU LIKE A THANKSGIVING TURKEY.  Laying on my tummy too long causes bruises my ribs so bad I can't even were a bra cause the under wires keep pressing down on my bruises 🤣😂😭    Also you can dance jayus 🤪😀🕺🏻💃🏻
The cold problem was very relatable
The reason I started hate my family was because of all the things they would say to me for being skinny and if I call them fat back I'm body shamming them
Oh yes....WHY DO DESIGNERS NOT PUT MORE HOLES IN BELTS???? IT'S NOT GONNA COST ANYTHING SO DO IT (The rest is also very accurate, i'm fricking Elsa in the winter)
Honestly I'd rather be skinny even with all these problems because then i wouldn't have to worry about getting wierd looks whenever i go to the beach  P.S no one ever looks at me I'm just paranoid I'm not even fat, I'm just slightly over weight but because of certain comments that i get from my family i just can't shake off the feeling that I'm really fat
I didn’t come here to be personally attacked.
I can def relate, but not being able to dance is unrelated lol
Is she 💅?
I sometimes joke around my skinny friend that she can eat a truckload of food and not gain a gram while I breathe around a burger and gain two kilos :D
I was working in a restaurant before and some customers ask me if I ate anything and I said to them I eat like a pig every day , and everytime I’m bored I’ll just eat if I’m not too full. I just have fast metabolism and my family has 9 people in them and only 3 of my siblings have fast metabolism and the rest is just chubby and thick and they can dance. 😓😓 I really wish I could dance , my dance move are shitty
I am confusion, you are a male or a female
What are you talking about you can dance amazing 😻!!!!!!!!
When you have to do situps that its real pain
Lol join the club I can't dance either. #Onlyjayus your not alone
Yep so true these are the problems we have to face
Go eat a burger thats what everyone tells me
I'm not skinny at all, but i am tall as fuck so there are hardly any pants that I fit, because they are either too wide on my hips, or they are too short
For the past however long...I thought that was a guy!
I look awkward when dancing coz I'm skinny. They would say I look like a dancing skeleton like wth
THIS IS SO GOD DAMN TRUE.
I have a cousin who is very skinny. I am sometimes afraid that his hands might fall of his shoulders. Without going to gym, his abs are visible. ☠️
WE DANCE THE SAME
Being on the other side of that spectrum, it has always been difficult for me to hear skinny people complain about their bodies. But growing up and being around skinny people, I realized we have the same issues, issues that society has placed on us really. All of that to say, the grass isn’t greener on the other side - it’s greener where you water it.
I can relate every single point :D
Same... and being in my 30s you'd think I'd have gained some of that "adult weight" 😔😔 NOPE! My family has always called me a toothpick, asked if I'm "smoking that shit" (crack) 😒😒 and I look hungry. Honestly though I think it's because they all put on 100s of lbs as a unit apparently and I'm the odd one out 😂😂😂
Fr I'm 6ft and 130 pounds
I also can't dance! I just enjoyed being skinny while it lasted.  Okay maybe not enjoy it I was so skinny that it caused problems.  But I still can't dance!
You girrrrl  You look freaking beautiful  I have a hug crush on you for a long time now
That's why i dont like the fat pride movement thing... It hurts my feelings to the core  Im 180cm and 45 kg  I cant gain weight because of TBC
So true I am skinny and it kinda sucks some people think that I starve my self I am really self conscious because I am skinny
It's kinda the same but just opposite with being a fat fuck like myself
I have something buldging in my chest and I look like that one titan in attack on titan running towards you does that say skinny or just skinny limbs
Even if i'm not skinny, i still dance worse than u xd
Drink a lotta raw eggs. Same problem I was the youngest in the entire school and these old bastards would always pick on me, throw me around ask me if I’m sickles not realizing they were all at-least 2 years older than me. It only takes a few months to get bigger they didn’t realize so I remember the skinniest oldest guy and me being the youngest decided to embark on a “gain weight” mission  got introduced to raw eggs, and now I’m like a gain muscle local coach.
I went from 325lbs down to 190lbs (I'm a big framed person so 190 is really skinny for a person like me) and found out being skinny sucks just like being obese, so I settle for about 230lbs, plenty of cushioning and insulation but not hard to stand or walk all day. Though I do get heavier during the winter cause it's fucking cold but I can't wear a heavy coat cause people turn the heat up way too high. So it's a constant battle to not suffer a heat stroke or turn into a block of ice. But either way, losing weight can be just as hard as gaining weight and vice versa. But if it's in reach, best thing to do is find a weight your comfortable with and keep it there, and don't try to look like a model cause no one will ever look perfect.
"i can't dance" Dances better than me*
I’m still really skinny and people joke about how I could loose weight by eating MacDonalds
Bruh im so fat i can survive getting shot by an RPG and my clothes still go zadonger dododo yoooooooooo
What are you talkin about you got great dance moves😁
Yoo finally someone relates
My sister is always getting jealous because I’m so skinny and she makes me feel bad for not being big enough as to not make her sad🙁
I'm sorry but danceing has nothing to do with the fact that u are skinny
Gurl... SAME
Naaaaaa I would rather be skinny than fat
I'm also sk
I'm literally in a gathering with my distant relatives rn and the first thing said to me when I entered the room was "oh my god you're so skinny do u not feed her (*insert parents name*) it's like you can be blown away by the slightest of wind." What a coincidence I found this vid.
I’m so sorry you’re what is seen as perfect in this country it must be so rough #1st world problems we feel for you girl
as a small, skinny 8th grader (barely 5 foot, 70-ish pounds) sometimes it really does feel like i'll break in half in the wind. or, if i jump while the wind is too fast, i'll fly away and flap in the wind like paper stanley
I can verify this.
TOTALLY AGREED WITH THIS.  LIKE PEOPLE ALWAYS TELL ME TO EAT MORE AND TO GET SOME PROTEIN  LIKE BIATCH I HAVE BEEN EATING THE DISGUSTING EGGS FROM LIKE MONTHS BUT THIS GOD DAMN BODY DOESN'T WANNA GET WIDER A LITTLE. omfg lmao.
I agree with the last one.
I’m skinny… but I was 52.2 kg. Yes, I am actually really skinny
You are so Cute
Same though
I'm skinny, BUT I'm also really tall, bad combo if you in high school
I remembered when I was so skinny as a child that my dad will tell my siblings to put stones in my pockets whenever the wind comes (before the rain) do that I won't be blown away 😂😭😭😭.  The life of being skinny, back then. But now, I'm trying to loose the fat I have after I started eating just too well.
Skinny or fat stills make my wood grow
I feel that. I used be like that especially as a dude it's an interesting ride, but now I am no longer extremely skinny.
This vid is so funny
Bruh same
Lol, got to love how everyone of these happen to fat people too. Except for the cold thing, we get hot. Otherwise pretty much 1 to 1
That last one seems like a you problem
Cant dancing isnt particularly because you are skinny.. Its because you are white.
Break in half in the wind🤣👌
The dancing thing is probably a you problem
This is my whole life. Getting cool new pants only for them to fall of me when I put my phone there.
And that’s why I have a heating disorder yayayay, gotta love comments from people :))
I get you girl, I also have been skinny all my life and i cant gain weight and everyone thinks im not eating enough. I'm eating a looot but i stay the same....😳, but I love myself as I am and I don't give a fuck about everyone says anymore
As a Skinnian , I can agree with Every second
Yess the belt problem is LITERALLY THE WORSTT
As someone who was called pencil in middle school i relate to this video
I don't know who tf said you can't dance I'd love to do those moves with you 🤣🤣❤️ Honestly you can dance
I feel you 100 percent
This is so true and I absolutely hate when people say "Your so lucky to be thin"
The fact that she still can dance better than me is concerning to me
Thank you for saying this.
I've never related to something more in my life
I get all of these
Btw the dance was - um - im speechless___
I have the same problem it’s hard
You should make a video on "things people google about me"
I can relate
Sitting on a hard chair hurts everyone's ass bones I've talked to thicker people that's what they said
I'm fat and my ass bones still hurt
Bruh you dance better than me
Can't dance? That's the best dancing I've ever seen.
Oh god it hit me right in the spot
By the way, you're beautiful.
Not me agreeing to all of that
"Omygod do you eat?" "I eat all the fucking time and I still don't gain any weight, so stfu" Regular conversations
I feel you
Whell it wood be the other way with me a docter 1 time was like you are fat and tucht my belly
I feel ya XD
Meanwhile i get fat by eating vegies. Life is unfair🥲
I swear i could never have a conversation without those damned comments  Now i stress eat :)
Some skinny people eat more than bigger people and still stay the same weight.
Don’t think 💭 most people notice that, they probably notice your beautiful smile and the fact that your gorgeous. I think you’ll be ok. Lol 😝
Says can't dance..  :**Busts out moves better than me** Me: **Cries**
I was constantly called toothpick in yr 7
Me fat:
I bet you can't do this kinda video on fluffy people!
Id rather be skinny than fat
SHIT THAT BELT ONE HITS HARD 😂😭😭😭
Your pelvic bone vs anything that has a corner… 💀  🪑
The thing is she is skinny and tall at same time. She could be a model with height and figure
I felt this X10 my fucking ribs are always showing
I just want to say join army but dont i did it was okey but what ever you really fit and i like your sarcasm
Ummm u can dance 💃 and you are great at it
Also trying to put a chair down but you are not heavy enough
i am skinny cuz i got a virus in my blood when i was a kid byt my question is why skinny people cant dance pl tell me Anyone????
Same pants fell when I was in class 😢😢
Me pasa
as a fat person i can confirm that we have all of these exact problems in reverse. we overheat very fast, finding large enough clothing is always a struggle, people mock us for it and we can also not dance
All of this happens to me iam skinny 😢
I used to be skinny when I was a kid, got teased about it all the time, not I'm probably over the average weight for children my age
Can relate 100% My brother says "if you lose 1 more kilogram you're gonna disappear" 🤣
I'm very skinny and I don't have problems and I can dance
My cousin is skinny to!
Weird Story time, Once me and my family went to a resort, it was a breezy day. In the evening we went to play some football and as soon as we entered I literally was about to be pulled by the wind cause I am so skinny and under weight my dad had to hold me the whole time. In that same resort we went to a restaurant there and we met a old friend of my mom and her husband and that FRICKING DUDE TOLD ME DON'T YOUR PARENTS FEED YOU?!! AND I WAS LIKE BRO WTF. Ok story time over bye
JuSt EaT a BuRgEr i one time ate 3kg of lazanja and i am still the same over yhe years
Finally someone talks about it
I felt it when she said that she needed to poke new holes in her belts because he waist is super tiny. I automatically knew that my new belts aren’t gonna fit my skinny self😭😭
like wtf was even growing up thinking one day you're gonna take a walk and break to a fckn wind blow!!
Your not allowed to be skinny or fat
Lol why u start every vid by standing on the sink
I am a 17 year old male maybe 52 kg (114.64 pounds) and I can relate to it.
You really dance good well better then me I guess idk
Now ik i dont belong here but i was always on the plus size and i say one thing about pants: Now most of the pants i bought i could fit in them but one type of pants i hated is:jeans
One word: TRUE
I gained a lot of weight, but when i was thinner i always struggled with belts not fitting-
Bruh
You look beautiful ❤️
i expected the cold part, but the fact that being skinny is the reason i cant dance 🧍‍♀️
Jayus u r sooo freckung true I m really skinny and society and my calssmates makes fun of me , but now I don't give attention to them people are like don't u eat ? U should go into modeling cause u skinny 😂 but I personally think whatever shit ppl say don't take it seriously they are just wanting u to feel insecured so I m proud be skinny and yes skinny personally made me beautiful ❤️ so remember u r beautiful as u r like jayus she's just soo prettyyy gurll ❤️
Converted all my Fat for Speed, Being thin means being light, Fast Speed, High Jumps, and Swift Movements through tight paths
You can still dance better than me 😂
Exactly
I'm the same jayus don't feel alone
I am watching this sitting down☺️
I wish i was getting that skinny
Good to see you back on your feet, fellow skinny person
fat people problems
Seeing Jayus dancing just made my day tysm
That dance reminded me of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo 🤣
Do you ever eat a lot but you’re still so skinny people see your bones but when you see you’re weight you look at it and you realize your are heavy af?
Yuuuuuup that's me I am letlary underweight by 17 freaking keloes
I am skinny and skinny guys can dance very well.  Example: Michael Jackson.
The last one🤣 Oh also well my body is normal people say but something anyoing is when people say that i have got skinnier like why was i fatter when i was younger idk but i think im better now tho And my little sister is skinny and well people say to her like the air will take u ur to skinny or go eat u dont even eat like what   Oh and ur dance moves are cool
Y’all talking bout me?!?
She has the rhythm of a boiled noodle
That's so true lol
Everyone literally does that to me, and it doesn't really help with my depression.
I'm skinny and I cant dance
Oh! Bad joints combined with skinny.  Snap crackle pop. Hurts.
And if your fat its everyone says DO YOU NOT DIET
The belt one 😭
How become Charlie is skinny as fix half the size of you and she can dance
Girl dont blame the dancing on being skinny lol 5 I get tho
As a skinny person, agreed, can relate Another problem(for me) : BLOWING IN THE WIND, I LITERALLY BLEW ACROSS THE PLAYGROUND
That was the best dance
I’m so skinny when I sit or smt you can just see my spine-
Same same. I’m 5’10” and like 135 lbs. can’t help it! 29 years old
The dancing's fire
Yeah, I’d rather be skinny then fat.
Saaaame
I wish i was skinny like that...
Nobody : Me : **being fat and watching this video**
Great video...fall in love,  have a family ,  kids ...oh wait bring that smile as well... Thank you have a blessed day and be blessed..love you
I can agree with this
Im skinny and yes I get cold a lot
Do you know people told me every time is winter we can tell you gang or not wait huh OK last time you’re 160 now you’re 200 oh5 pounds damn I get a lot of weight I’ll lose it when the winter is over
I USE to be REALLY skinny and I had all these problems!  Good thing I finally got a little bit of fat on me so I don’t *f r e e z e*
Yeah I’ve been fat, skinny, skinny fat so I’ve experienced all the problems and it all sucks
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THIS!  It's so annoying dealing with people who don't get that skinny vibes with problems too!  Especially when you're like you and I where skinny is just a default state that we can't avoid because extra calories just get turned into extra thermal and kinetic energy none of which is retained by us naturally.
Me, skinny af and still was called Fat throughout school  But I relate to the rest of the Issues
So that's why she could sit on the sink
As a skinny adult male who can't put on weight. This shït sux
She: I can’t dance  Also her: dacing like deku🤣🤣
I tell ya 30 is nice
The last one is just because you're wite
just me being like this for my whole life :
Hi, it's me, 16, 6'3 and 130 lbs. Yes. Everyone of these are true. And anyone who says shit about it is very fucked up. It does hurt
"cant dance" thats some bs there
I am so insecure about being skinny, im so lanky
Monk girl it’s sucks having fat in only your stomach
Same
Kocham Cię!
Sameeeee
As a skinny person, I can confirm this is *ALL* accurate.
I hv a friend who's the skinniest in the entire school but she's heavier than i am😬
As a skinny person myself, I can confirm that this vid is 100% accurate.
My sis is still a stick
That hits hard as a skinny person
Trust me dude overweight peapoles problems are just way worse in both social and health ways
Me: *SKINNY AS FRICK*  Also me: *the best dancer in my class when I was in 6th grade*
Can't say no to that and it actually when you sit for too long and I can't even sit on the floor comfortably
So relatable!!!
Ok that’s cool and all but I’m more intrigued by why tf are you on a sink and how did you even get in that position on top of a sink
I got my skinny genes from my dad and he got his from his mom-my grandma- and people still tell me YoU cAnT bE a VeGeTaRiAn YoU cLeArLy DoNt GeT  eNoUgH PROTEIN!!!!!
I felt that 🥲
I’m 10 and I weigh 64 pounds my friend eight and he’s almost 100
Agree
The dance moves 👽
BESTIEEE SAAMEEE #SKINNYTALLLEGEENDDDD
Felt😔
Idk if it's the skinniness that prevents the dancing lol
DAMN I WISH I WAS A WOAMN! Hahaha
As someone who's been skinny my whole goddamn life   I've never seen a truer video
I believe the last one is no rythemides not contagious or deadly but genetic
I think the dance problem isn't related to being skinny
How old are you????
yea i know the feeling i am 6ft and just barely 60kg
Same girl a am so skinny
At least you’ll have be smaller target harder to hit in a shooting at 11:43:31 with 2 handguns a rifle a pump shotgun and an AR or just in general you know🙂…..don’t worry why the first is specific (:
Yeah about the cold one.
Better than being overweight you ungrateful person
Bro same here 😭
Ain't gna lie you really can't dance lol jp No really yoh can't..
I've been severely underweight my whole life and all of these are relatable
I have an advantage as a skinny person which is my neck is so skinny that people can fit it in half of their hand and they can’t choke me 😎

Im fat af but dam thats a lot of problems
If skinny people have problems too........        Then why does society have a problem with fat people only
Im skinny and can relate to some of these but definitely not the cant dance one. Im not a professional dancer, I just let the music flow and let my body follow the rhythm. Honestly all that matters is your having fun.
Solution?
The good thing about being skinny is you can stick big anyone any time so I am proud to say I love being a stick bug 😊
LMAOOIO I CAN RELATE
I have 4 of those problems and when I sit with my back against a chair my spine gets bruised, A LOT.
This is relateble I could not focus in class because I was busy trying to keep warm in the artict with no jacket allowed
Sooo true... Its just my problem.. I was so skinny so I used to catchup cold very quickly. Still I'm wearing socks and its nit even cold weather.. N yes ny bumbs hurt alot.. N one burger cannot gain your weight
Ngl.. You're pretty
As someone who has been pretty fat for the majority of my life, these barely sound like problems tbh
Nah you have good dance moves
And by the way I still think you're a knockout LOL
Boogie woogie boogie boog- *snap*
I feel you girl. I'm a former history teacher I used to teach eighth-grade most of the time. We had this one girl all the teachers left she was so sweet it was unbelievable she is great volleyball player good athlete all-around she was so skinny that a good strong wind would actually move her around times. We all hated to see your leave I mean we joked about failing or just to keep her. But by the time she graduated high school she had started to fill out and within a year or two she looked like a goddess. I mean she stole a friend of mine on on Facebook and she's married to a really nice guy now but she literally is just amazingly beautiful she literally just went from Rags to Riches and she still just as nice as she was. And I talked to others I've known girls that were a little bit heavier and they caught s*** about being too big or chunky or something it's not a matter of how skinny or how you're fat you are it's what kind of shape you're in. Are you healthy? And I saw from your pictures you flashed you were an athlete so I'm assuming that means you were probably pretty healthy. The lot of people are cruel they don't realize that it's more what kind of shape you're in then how much yo meet your kin around on your bones period hell when I was 8 years old I was already five-foot-nine and I only weighed 67 lb. I stayed that way stayed skinny as a rail I'm going to hit six right at six 4 and stop going up but I didn't fill out until after my first year college. I was skinny as a rail all the way through Junior High and High School but I was an athlete so I was actually very healthy
Lol 😂
Ohohoh go get yourself an happymeal you emo! Im 15 and weight 51 kilograms!!
I have a friend who always wears jackets because of how skinny he is, dang flash speed metabolism😂
Yeah skinny shaming is a thing and it is very normalized
Or you could eat
Same. Whenever I wear a shirt sometimes it feels like I’m wearing a very short nightgown.
The last one tho
Ikr it's like bruh even if we eat we won't become fat like bruh
relatable
Facts! I knew a girl who reminded me like every other week about how skinny I was by having what seem to be a mini freak out where she would end up putting both her your hands around my thigh and then take them and put them around hers and remind me that my thighs were just as thick as her neck and she was an average weighted person....
Yesss these are so relatable omg
I've started to get skinny 4 years ago  Each moves makes my bones do weird sh*t
You’re not skinny, you’re just skinny on a frame that is 6 foot 2
Hey now I’m 6”2’ 145lbs and I can dance very well
My friends: oh, have you eaten enough today? Me, who ate way too much food and had Nutella for breakfast every day: :] yeah My friends: wtf if ate I so much food I would become a ball Me: oh, okay... Sorry   No but seriously I often felt guilty bc my metabolism is weird so I don't easily gain weight. While some of my friend were struggling to keep their weight low and venting to me I always wished I could relate, but I had to keep my mouth shut because what could I say to them. "ah yeah I don't gain weight."? very supportive :/
I relate to all of these except the last one
I've always been overweight all my life (I still am), so I kinda know where you're coming from. The most relatable one was the comments people said because of my appearance. When I was in primary school, so many people would come up to me and tell me a variety of things, such as "Oh my God, you should lose some weight' and "I would be ashamed to have a child as fat as you" and "You should stop eating/go on a diet." All these comments left me hating my body for many years, which almost caused me to develop an eating disorder.  Another relatable thing would be the clothes never fitting. Instead of my clothes being too big, they've always been too small. It would be hard to find clothes that wouldn't hug me skin tight or enhance my fatness and make me look worse. Society in general just needs to do better with size diversity and acceptance.  Last thing: I have a friend who's really slim (she doesn't like the term skinny), and another friend who's the average/ideal weight. My slim friend has also faced the issues that you face. My average weight friend always gets compliments when she's alone, but when she's spotted with us, so many people make offensive remarks. Despite people always saying nice things to her, she ignored them because she knew they were saying those things since she didn't look like her other friends. She's a really good friend who's always been their for me and my slim friend, even if we're not the same weight has her.  Anyways, yeah. Sorry for it being so long, I just wanted to share my experience
That neighbor aunt: hey get some meat, your so skinny Me: atlest, im not fat as a elephant like you
True
Weight should never be a talking point, especially with kids. Skinny or medium, or fat, it does not matter one iota! It says nothing about the person. Nothing about their worth. Their health. Their character. Nada. All it does is make kids self conscious about themselves and jealous of others for randomly having characteristics they feel they should have too/instead.
I've said things such as that to a skinny person without really knowing how hurtful it was. I didn't mean it in a rude or mean way, and I've wanted to apologize to them for a long time but I can't get in touch with them anymore.
Im 29 killograms and man people tell me to eat But maaaaan i eat (im 13)
Lol me no skinny me big
Been told to go eat a cake 😂
The 3rd fact is not rlly through im damn skinny and im a good dancer lel
I don’t think dancing is a skinny person problem… lol I’m like a morbidly obese child and I can’t dance haha 😂
Your beautiful 💯
Spot on
My aunt have been telling me that, but I know she haven't done this just to hurt me or something.
IT WAS THE PLAYLIST FUR ME
I used to be skinny as a little kid and had these problems ;-; but since ive started puberty uhem T~T its not fun being curvy either
I'm skinny
I'm also skinny and this is so true
Oh gosh I relate to all of these, also I love all your videos
can relate
Nah you just cant dance😂
Her dance was actually amazing. Chaotic, but amazing.
Oh sorry. Eating whatever you want and never gaining weight. Meanwhile I starve myself for days and then feint. I've had these skinny comments when I lost lots of weight sometime and I could see my ribs. Giving bigger girls my jacket on a night out wasn't possible lol. I'm back to being chubby again
Mani have the same problem but my metabolism is just so fast I can’t get fat on my body and I’m way to lazy to go to the gym a lot..
Born 2 months early, underweight my entire life. I got tired of hearing people say shit about my lack of weight, so I started telling people to find original content. If somebody ever called me a skeleton, I told them "That's Sir Skeleton to you."
i wish i was skinny.. :(
Feel cold is ready annoying when you feel full faster every single day.
Same
Same and to make things worse to make fun of me they would pick me up and then say wow ur so light then I ack them then they called me short skinny monster like wth
Anyone remember how your stomach visibly grows whenever you eat and you think you're getting fat but after a few hours it goes back to normal? Lmao.
Why this content is so much relatable 😅
What’s really messed up is that people say to obese people go loose some weight then when you do people are like you’re so skinny go gain weight. Like what the hell do people want you to look like. Never hate your body, you are beautiful no matter what people say. And if some says something harmful to you say something nice back then they will think it doesn’t affect you and will stop bothering you but society is a really messed up place
That’s the issue with being 6ft plus lol
Can you tell how to fix that skinny problem? I am skinny too.😦😦
all of these are true for me but i’m always over heating so umm not rly the cold one lol
Jayus dance moves: infinite/10
IM PRETTY SURE EVEN IF YOURE CHUBBY THOSE ISSUES WOULD STILL APPLY...HMMM LETS SEE HOW...IF YOU DONT HAVE MUCH OF AN As$, IT STILL HURTS WHEN YOU SIT TOO LONG,  WHEN YOU LAY DOWN YOU MIGHT NOT GET BRUISED, BUT YOU PROBABLY WILL HAVE A HARD TIME TO BREATH CUZ  LUNG WILL BE SMOOSHED, CHUBBY PPL GET HOT, NOT COLD. SO YOUD SWEAT(NOW HOW SEXY IS THAT LOL. SKINNY PPL DONT HAVE THAT PROBLEM), PANTS FALLING DOWN CAN APPLY TO THE NO ASS PPL ALSO., BELT TOO BIG...CHUBBY PPL NEED TO MAKE HOLES ALSO IF BELT IS TOO SMALL STILL. AND IM PRETTY SURE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE SAID  ARE WORSE TOWARD A CHUBBY PERSON VS. A SKINNY ONE. 🤷🏻‍♀️ IM JUST SAYING
I find it funny how much the ass one relates to me
Omg, I didn’t even think that some people don’t have to deal with this. I thought this was just everyone.
nice dance moves
....I'm skinny but I can dance 🤡
Can confirm All of these are very true
Opposite situation with me sister.. I'm 100kgs
Or, when all of the girls would complain about their appereance and insecurities, and when you start complaining about something you don't like aboit you body, they're like "omg you're literally a stick, shut up and stop making everyone insecure🙄" or smth along these lines
my entire family is the same when it comes to judging me being skinny and just why
As the skinniest kid in my school ik this is true
Bwb5
I can relate 😅 I’m 5’10 but I weigh 53kg and I’m super skinny 😂
Oh man the sittin down hurting the Butt bones Is relatable af
I'm not skinny and I deal w some of these problems wtf ?             No it's not the mirror I legit weigh 200 pounds
"Do your parents even feed you?" "omg i can literally feel ur spine if i put my hand on ur back" "u look like a stick" "omg u need to eat more" are some of the most annoying things people said to me 😃
No jayus you can dance you just dance white
the end is amazing.
That skinny shit I heard far to much growing up
I would call that dancing, cause honestly dancing is whatever you want lol
"I can't dance" *Proceeds to tear up the dancefloor*
I don't think dancing is influenced by being skinny. Your moves are amazing tho
I've been both 🥴 when you're skinny you get people being jealous, saying you could be a supermodel (for no other reason except that you're skinny), people telling you that they feel like they're gonna break you (the guy who said that was smaller and skinnier than me ??), ect. When you're fat you get awkward silences over weight/eating, ill fitting clothes, rude remarks, unwanted advice, ect. But I prefer being skinny cause literally all clothes look good.
Me who is 14 and weighs 45kg: Huh, Relatable.
You are beautiful the way you are
"i can't dance!"    Me having the same problem but still can dance:i am inevitable.
I get all of These
I have the oposit issue with belts- it so hard to find one that fits
Bro go  outside you hand inside to much its unhealthy.
ahah i cant relate cuz im not very skinny owo. im not at like an unhealthy weight or anything at all but the problem is that im just insecure and i wish i could lose a few lbs. well if i wasn't insecure i wouldn't feel fat even tho im at a pretty average weight
Me too im also very skinny
Michael Jackson would like to disagree about the last part
i got that problem as well
I've been underweight and overweight. Skinny every time lemme tell ya
You should try growing up larger than most. You get plenty of grief & the clothing is wicked expensive
Tall people unite!
I’ve been kinda skinny for about 4 years now and people ask me if I eat. When they do this I tell them how much I eat and it surprises the fuck out of them. I mean I have an extremely high metabolism and I have to eat a lot. Even if that bunch of food is at least 5-6 burgers
Dude the cold one is so true man I live in the north of England and I can get really cold out here and being skinny suckkks coz I get too damn cold way too quick
I have a skinny friend. I weigh 30kg more than him. And on a windy Day it is Terribly funny that I have to grab and support him from not getting blown away XD
I never get good belts cause none of them fit me without poking holes
I don’t think being skinny is why you can’t dance
When I was younger people would always tell me to eat a burger and I never really thought it to be offensive till recently
I was a fat guy and I hated that but no I'm skinny
Im skinny af and people call me skinny all the time ill be honest i dont give a shit. I eat a lot. Like a lot. Its because the food dissolves faster  than normal people thats why i dont gain weight 🙃
5 and 6 is soo accurate for someone skinny who ate a whole plate of rice on me
I know one being racist 😁
When you will NEVER be able to relate to this haha 😂
These are so true. Rip the skinny ppl
i was vibing with the end lmao
You described me
Always getting stuck in the middle back seat because “you’re the skinniest one”
Im soooooo god damn skinny   im 11 years old and i have 28kg
Ya and for me as soon a puberty hit I gained some weight and was then called fat
Facts. The first time I rode public transportation, a random person sitting down wrapped their hand around my shin and started laughing.
The comments are especially bad when you're a guy, when I was in middle school I was SUPER skinny, so I got a lot of shit for being weak and a "stick"
I got these cute pants the waist did not fit by the time the waist did fit me when I was a little older they where to short
I agree with all of these.
Relate with about 4 out a 6 of these
If you can’t dance get in the mosh pits at a Metallica gig
Honestly people who can't dance but still are having the time of their life are way more fun to be around than people who can dance and just.... Dance....
I like wearing big t-shirts cuz im insecure about my weight i only weight 48 pounds is that normal for a 10 year old like me?
Am 21 but still 39kg 🥲 they call me stick sometimes toothpick yeah 😂😂🥲
Once have i never related so hard to a video
Dude you look like the girl from season 2 on the show YOU  on Netflix
Still....being skinny is better than being fatsoo🙄😐
How tall is she?
Wind once pushed me over because I had not weight
ah come on, that's dancing! well it is!!
You can dance better then I can, I have a very good music memory but can’t sing worth a darn I almost never even hum either lol.
Hey Bella, I think your amazing , you always make me laugh, smile and learn new things every day, no matter how weird the facts are. You help me through everyday life, and I can’t thank you enough for that. Keep going with what your doing, you are so incredible at what you do. I really hope you see this comment because I love you ❤️
Don't poke more holes  Just cut it from the buckle end  Remove the buckle then cut it to size
Yo jayus's moves do be slapping
Hey, you're perfect just the way you are🥰✨
Don’t lie about the dancing part ok
"I can't dance" proceeds to bust a move
I mean these sound bad but the other side of the coin isn’t too fun either
Jayus dancing in the end of the vid was so freaking funny and cute. It made me happpy as *jeff* for some reason.
Ahh yes, our troubles finally addressed
As a 95 pound 15yr old I agree with everything in this video well maybe not the dancing thing
HELLLLOOOOOO
Oh would u look at that jayus is not walking with one leg anymore-
This reminds me of my friend Aydan. His biceps are like my wrists. He always has to go to the doctor to check for anorexia or whatever it’s called.
Last 4 moves were vibes
When I was a kid, i used to suffer bullying because I was too skinny, that leaded to depression, for 2 months, but I’m good now
Okay, as a fat dude, I can relate to the cant dance. When I dance, my fats rolls look like you take a water ballon and shake it violently
Bro those dance moves they good well better than me *OK!*
I still wish I were skinner. 🥲
Hey, I always win dodge ball, so thats a plus.
my SO of 13 years got all of these... more so as a teen too. worst was if someone was cooking for her, they'd try to feed her sickeningly large portions like that'd plump her up. Fucked with her relationship with food imo.
When i was a wee lad (2-5) i used be very chubby and almost all my relatives were like "ah you so cute" but when i was about 12 visiting a family reunion, almost all my relatives were like "who are you? Oh wait your *insert my name*, you used to soooo chubby like I could hug you everyday now i can fit my hand around your wrist now. Make sure you eat lots of meat everyday so you don't starve a lot"
I’m the skinniest person on earth, all of those are true except number 3.  Then again I am like really hairy
And there's me who even if he eats one potato chip my weight will bombard and I even tried to control my diet for at least 5 years but no improvement even though I workout this year and now I have started to become muscular and attractive 🙂
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
So  true cuz I'm also skinny
jayus:"i can't dance!" me: same
Its true :(
skinny people can definitely dance, I mean look at Lisa👀
As someone who is skinny I can say fax
One time in middle school gym a girl asked me how i stayed thin and i had no proper answer. it felt really weird cause at the time i was pretty self conscious about such a thing being pointed out.
Thing is true for me at least I'm like a twig but human
But that dancing though...
Ur dancing better than me
Many People don't understand the troubles as a skiny person, I have always been very skinny and I feel guilty of it because every one is comparing themselves against me even tho I don't have control over it, and when I talked to my best friend that is overweight, he was like, "how can being skiny have any problems?, you are literally living your best life without any bullying because of your weight unlike me" and i am the type of person to not be able to explain stuff when I'm in the right so people always win against arguments when I'm in it because of how bad I am to express myself. So anyways being underweight or skiny isn't any better🙁
close but there are a few missing ones that are bigger issues
Not being able to dance has nothing to do with your weight 😂😂😂😂I’m fat n I can crackhead dance
10000% true
im chunky as hell with T H I G H and im still cold
God I relate so much. My bf and I are both underweight and one of us is constantly underneath a blanket xD
Hahaha me
Awesome dance mov8
im average weight ig but I could relate to some of these
I'm skinny and I can dance better than my whole family
Bruh, so true. I am still skinny ever sense I was little to now
No offense, but I think the dancing problem has nothing to do with being skinny🤣
i’m fit and fat he live for that 😌
My parents always worry that I'm not eating... but I eat like the very hungry caterpillar. But damn if it ain't the worst thing to hear
So relatable
But look good
😂😂😂🤣🤣🕺🏼
I can relate
🤣🤣🤣
As a big person I can say that I've never experienced this problem, but as a big person I get hotter a lot easier, I'm like a bear in mid summer during a heat wave
You think that’s bad try being fat like being called a fat fuck Is a common  practice for me
#im_attacked
I have the exact opposite problems-
I am skinny and number 123 is cap
😂
Yep, i ate 5 meals and still skinny in the morning, its just gassing food-
That counts as dancing, doesn't it?
Skinny People cant dance ...whattt!!!! I Wonder how k pop ídolo are so Good at dancing
I am really skinny
Bro my class mates like watch out your going to break him and I tell him that his cheek are chubbier than me because he’s cheeks are so chubby
Same here
They can dance better than me
I can relate I can't even sit for too long or it just starts hurting, and I constantly get lots of bruises and comments on if I eat or not. Like no matter how much I eat I just can't gain weight
Bella: *says they can't  dance* Also Bella: *busts a fucking move that no one else could ever accomplish*
I totally relate! AF! Especially the wind picking me away phrase! And the dancing part? "What are you doing?, You might accidentally stab someone with those elbows!"
Too relatable
I have never been super skinny or over weight but I can relate to most of these finding clothes that fit me properly especially jeans is difficult and most of the time I always hated I was just in the middle and not supper skinny but I never realize that they have problems just like me
this is exactly me, that's why I started working out and at first NO ONE thought I was working out(I wear baggy clothes) so one day I say EFF it and pull out my arm and flex and everyone goes DEAD SILENT, it was glorious
I’m skinny as heck (my friends call me toothpick sometimes) and it’s nice to know I’m not the only one with these problems.
I’m really skinny and I’m only 13 and u wouldn’t believe the amount of times ppl have called me skinny. I’m also an athlete and the worst one iv heard is “I bet the wind just pushes u to the finish line” like gurl that’s my hard work right there don’t ever say that
fr i be eating a lot and barely look like i eat 😭
same 😂😂😂 so relatable my pants falls down so much i get so freaking angry if im public and my fucking pants started falling
Bro. Why tf is this so FUCKING TRUE??
So fucking true
I know she's a lesbian but I am in love with her, marry me
The dancing thing was the best and most relatable part!!
I am 🙂
As an skinny person all of this is true, especially the cold one. Where i live it can get rlly cold but my anxiety and fear act up when i turn off my air cooler so i gotta sleep with two blankets. I built a cold resistance since i deal with ice a lot but i still prefer my double blankets.
I love how all the skinny people are oh my gosh being skinny sucks I wish I were fat😂
This is so relatable. Literally everything you have just said happened to me.
What nah you can dance 😌
All of these are so accurate especially #5. While I was eating (I have a hard time eating alot because I have a small stomach) my aunt asked me if I was anorexic because I was so skinny. A couple times when I would hang out with her she would always make remarks about how skinny I was.. That and what other people said made me start to force myself to eat way more than I could and I was always (and still am a bit) insecure about how skinny I was.
This is too relateble
I've never been so understood in my life. This is too relatable
Have that same problem with my belt they always think I’m trying to sag
How come i get hurt all the time and people are like "your fine"  like it hurts much worse as a skinny person
Bro I’m so skinny and yes it does hurt sitting in chairs I feel you and I also get cold so much that im shivering
Just drink a lot of water while sitting with small sips🙂
I am soo skinny
I’m skinny and thought I was a mildly good dancer but she just done the moves I use
Dancing isn't a skinny problem, just get good scrub 1v1 me in Minecraft coward
DUDE ALL OF THESE HAPPEN TO ME 😭but I don't wanna gain weight cuz I'm not sure if I'll like my body. I've actually been trying to lose weight. (just for info, I'm 180cm and around 62kg)
1 To 5 Been Trough it all
YES 😭😭😭 I’m wearing 2 robes right now!
Me to.
My brother and I always joke about eachothers weight, I'm a little over and a little shorter than him, he's very tall and lanky with long dark hair. He jokes that if I were in a book I'd be a round character and I tell him he looks like something Tim Burton left on the cutting room floor. We both are trying to stop it, and I'm trying to lose a little weight, but I just felt like sharing.
I'm 48kg and 15, can confirm these things are very legit. And no I'm not just super short I'm actually average height, just skinny
Can't dance huh? what does that say about me who that was good enough and far better than anything I could do...
Losing fat only is really hard as a teen bro... Because of what others say, it makes you feel like youre doing sth bad for your body. It can seriously make you fucked up. Im not that skinny but i purposefully got lean af, and everybody acted like i was killing myself. Acting like this with a skinny person is just like fatshaming someone in their face
Dude I’m so insecure about my weight
I can relate. Especially to the comments about my health
Ty for this
Damn I wish I was skinny you people have it easier than us
You dance just fine jay
Oyy Michael Jackson being skinny danced sooo smooth but yea being skinny absolutely SUCKS🥲
my brother is one of these guys who eats a LOT  and is still skinny
As a former skinny turned slightly overweight person, people, make up your goddamn minds.
as a skinny person i can confirm this is very true
I agree with all of this except for dancing that's not a skinny people problem that's a you problem
Yo i feel ya girl I'm the same. I heard that shit growing up as well lol.
Break in half in the wind is something ive never heard before. Thats creative
Let’s not forget where if you accidentally hit your hip bone on a table edge that’s a different type of pain 😩
You can sponsor your own funeral by using your ashes for fire works
She looks so pretty tho
I uh... don't think the dancing is related to you being skinny. I think you just can't dance
This-this is so true
I am skinny rn and tbh- those some good dance moves 7/10 👏👏👏
I’m fat as shit
As a skinny person, I can relate a lot. Especially to the belt one. I have 7 added holes in my belt.  Tho, at least I don’t get cold easily.
This end 🤣
I love this. I’m the opposite and I can relate. I am big person, 6’6” and 240 so I’m not too bad but we have insulation up the wazoo hahaha
I can’t dance so that’s why I choose ballet instead if I can’t get in the groove and I don’t have to worry about my weight  But I’ll have to worry about expenses
I have seen so many of her videos and now I think I am in love
you got the moves 😁
I’m happy that *they* said this because this is ME
Sameeeeee
I've had every problem, and with #5, my grandma would always say to my parents: "You need to put some meat on that boy's bone so he can fight." That was sweet to hear, but this: "Are you on drugs?" Is the opposite.
Soo same, all of those things
Fax no printer
her moves are fly af
No 5 people tell me that soooo MUCH
Whas that 66 pounds or kilograms
ELITE sameeeeeeee
This facts and especially 5 I hated that
Just be proud that ur skinny like me… and tell the people who laughed at you that at least your not as fat as them, they will try to get skinny to beat you but fail cause of their family dna which makes them can’t be as skinny as you cause their family dna cannot change from fat to skinny
Every single one of these is true. Especially the sitting down. Ugh! I can't do situps properly because my tailbone always gets in the way. And as a result of that, every belt I have has extra holes in it. Add all of that to a 6'5" dude and funding clothes becomes nearly impossible. I shop for clothes on Amazon. Help me find pants. PLEASE
My life y'all ❤️🙃
As a Skinny person, I confirm
"I can't dance" precedes do drop the sickest dance moves ever seen
Bro I'm short and thick as all hell, AND I STILL CANT DANCE!
They all true, except the dance  I have been dancing my entire life
Yes that's.
Fun fact: some food(like frog bone) when consumed a large amount over a long periods in an early age can drastically change a skinny body metabolism to a fat one. Sources: Myself - a skinny ass kid cant even lose his rip even with diet of 3 whole adults then being stuffed with frogs at the age of 5 growing up to become fat with just eating broccoli.
Litterally all the same and still to this day it’s so hard to gain weight
Oh poor skinny people
Omg so trueeee
Don’t forget when you have to play something with a ball, and you get hit. Pain is 100x worse..
Only Janus saying I have no insolation so I get cold because I'm skinny. Me: Gets a bottles root beer and jumps in the snow with my underwear and does snow angels, and walks bearfoot in the snow.     Here in aMerica
Im not skinny im fat :(
I got 2 words for skinny people, kids clothes
As someone who has been fat my whole life and is now almost underweight, i can see that both sides have bad sides LOL
Yeah I'm a skinny af guy and I can confirm all of this is very true and is made even worse by my height. 5'4" 120lb. can be the worst in the winter.
why is this so true
I love the end 😂🤣😂
Tell us how did you gain weight
Maybe being overweight isn't a bad thing all the time
I used to be 60 lbs and now I’ve doubled that and tripled my dancing! Lmfao
Oh the sitting one. That was the worse. If you sat to hard it's like it rattled your bones all the way to your teeth
I wish that was my only problem in my childhood, I used to be skinny until my parents divorce and I started to get overweight and was made fun of all throughout middle school and junior high, about to graduate and I still haven’t gotten rid of all the weight, I haven’t been made fun of as often and I’m relatively normal now but there’s still a lot of weight I need to lose before I’m actually skinny and then I need to start gaining weight to be a bodybuilder like I’ve always wanted to be so
Being skinny is really exhausting for me
You dance better than me😭
Bro same I was like 60 Ib in 7th grade
Seriously, cite your damn sources when you cite “facts”. It’s annoying. You could totally be making things up.
When I got a uniform I had to get girl sizing 😔
jayus i like the way you look I fell in love the way you are💞I'd love to meet you one day
The cant dance part yeah das yo fault. Practice is good especially if you get forced to dance in the school studio by your gay strict teacher and you get first place in the dance fight.
I have put my self on a diet to put on weight and yet I am still not putting much weight on 😣
As someone who's a good 3 KG lighter than someone a whole year younger than me (I'm only  12, so it's actually quite a bit difference) I can agree with everything, particularly the last one
This is true I’m super skinny
What do you mean you can dance like a god!!!
I like how society is an inconvenience 😂
Brooooooo that first one. Holy shit.
Is it bad to see most of your ribs? Like I've always been like that and people tell me I need to gain weight but I think I got too much weight :<
Hey, did you know that you don't have to punch a new hole in your belt? Well, actually, you need to, but on the other side. Unscrew the buckle, cut off the excess of your belt, punch a hole for a buckle and assemble it. Here you go, you can still use your premade holes in your belt that are much stronger and not damaging the material.
can anyone truly dance?
So relatable 😭😭😂
You're a better dancer than I am in the shower
Same
I’m skinny as fuck but because of weird genetics i’m also super warm..I got it from my dad somehow! My body just creates more heat than necessary to the point i’m like a portable heater for others (it only really sucks when i have something on that holds body heat well enough). I also cannot dance..  Also a weird thing about the “blow away” comment is that during windy days I actually struggle to walk because I’m so thin and weak it puts up a decent fight. It’s honestly exhausting on decently windy days! I’ve never blown away but the struggle is there.
yo feel me, sister
Dont where a belt wear suspenders
Bro this is me, fat runs a lot in my family but it didn’t get me, so when it’s winter I freeze my toes and fingers off, while my family’s says, “huh? It’s not that cold”
same lol
YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, and one more yes for good measure
At least you aren't so heavy that ur joints are going to collapse
Most of problems are faced by obese people also but slightly differently
I'm tall and skinny so I get cold in like 5 secs
don't forget walking barefoot! it hurts, even on grass (if the grass is thick enough)  people's comments are always so hurtful, the amount of times people have circled my wrist with their fingers or said they were jealous of my weight is too much to count. i even got called "anorexic" once :(
Skinny people are cute
I know the pain
I think the last one is just a you problem 🤔
I don't know what jayus is talking about, their dance moves are fire
Me:u can atleast dance better than me
I know how it feels like. I mean when I was 6 or 7 years my weight was 17kg. It was becuse I did not eat.
The funniest thing is someone telling you to eat more, and when they see you eat an entire days worth of food in 20 minutes, its either a "how do you eat all of that" or "i bet your gonna throw it up afterwards"
Bella: I can’t dance  Me: Rocking  back and forth in a corner  drinking my drink and hoping no one will see me because I can’t dance😐 *Bella can dance better then me*
I guarantee you can get very fat very quickly
I'm 6'2 and I weigh 113lbs this is so fucking true ;-; everyone is always like "oh I wish I was as skinny as you, your life must be so easy" all I got to say to them is "no you don't"
in skinny and i thought i just couldnt dance- AT LEAST ANOTHER PERSOB CANT DANCE TOO
Dang your lucky your light I’m 90 lbs and I’m  10 but I do sports but that does not do much
yup
I wonder if she reads the comments But yeah I’m skinny. Agreed.
Damn straight up facts. I deal with the same problems.
Belts not fitting is one of the most annoying problems ever
I can relate to this and it's dum
Very true. Body shaming is horrible. I ama quite unhealthy weight I'm afraid about my health but the worst things is the comments people make.
https://youtube.com/channel/UClFgdoV5GQq3EguNg_dZmCQ tune in man
This is accurate for me except the very cold one cause i have very good cold resistance lol
OMG when it’s like 70 degrees out it feels cold. I need a blanket whenever I’m anywhere for a while lol.
Steroids 🥴
Bruh i am 6 foot by 200 pounds and i, like, almost NEVER feel cold. For example: outside, 69°F (nice), everybody with jackets, me with only a shirt and some jeans and i just... Caren't
I swear onlyjayus the female representation of tyler the creator
Yeah it's sad being skinny I don't fit any of my clothes
*This video explains myself very well*
It doesn't make sense just ask slightly overweight people our problems are so much more i personally i can't breathe properly like i was when I was skinny just 3 years ago be thankful that you are in a healthy weight
As an extremely skinny person, I can relate. One of my family members cleat I have high metabolism. My other family members say I’m cold blooded because I’m almost always cold blooded 😂
I can relate to this cause a lot of people when I was younger used to all me easy and I would always like cry cause none of my clothes would fit and people would tell me to gain weight and become fattee
OMG ITS THE SAMEEE
Omg.... yes
You need to do some squads to have some sickness
I'm fat but I think I'd rather be skinny
You dance just fine XD
I relate
FUCKING THANK YOU, I’m 12 and I’ve never hit more than 70 pounds and I can relate to this so much
Belt one is the most accurate one
I don’t know what the fuck she’s talking about because I’ve literally never seen better dancing then that-
Me putting on a 3rd hoodie: im skinny and cold lol my bro:ur fat and ugly go on a run
I was told by my grandpa that if I didn’t get at a healthier and heavier weight I would get food forcefully shoved down my throat by a tube. Welp I believed it and that definitely scared me. I was about 10 btw
As someone who sweat very fast and have bad BO when I’m sweating  I want to be cold al the time not for my sake  For other people sake-and for not embarrassing myself
I can relate also my legs are always sore
I don’t know what you’re talking about, that looks like beautiful dancing to me
Skinny people problems are so real. Like more people are all like 'im so fat' or 'its okay you're not fat, you're beautiful' but I see very little people talk about how it isn't always a fantastic thing being skinny (as shown) and I've had people tell me personally that in skinny and shouldn't have any insecurities or issues.
I had no idea u played basketball, do u have any clips of u playing?
i have a skinny friend and even she told me that she's afraid to hug me cause she's scared that she will break me in half :(
Mr to iam skinny as fuck
Bro ngl. She dances better than I do
Those moves tho
As someone who was borderline anorexic that used to break dance, these all applied heavily
my cousin is exactly like this. she had gotten a sickness named icloi or sun a while back and still hasn’t gained her normal weight. shes 12 and 64.8 pounds. her doctor says to eat more but she’s gained more weight so everyone’s proud of her
You're a great dancer!
Am so skinny I can put my hand under my ribs
Yea I’m short and skinny(about 73lbs) out the worst thing is my legs are were most of my height comes from but my waist is way too small for the pants I need
I don't think I'm that skinny but I did hurt myself laying on a slide..  But I can easily dance, you just gotta feel it man
My god lol
I can dance maybe it's talent  i am skin y tho
I don’t judge you for being skinny
I’m one of those people
Nice dance moves Jayus
Unsure if the dancing is a skinny problem.🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣
I can relate to this
Lean gene you Mean gene me Jayus I love you!
I’ve been fairly big my whole Life and when I started dropping weight in wrestling I realized Losing fat makes you very cold
Ive been ultra skinny for my whole life and everyone always says (get some meat on your bones)
I am literally a fat stick can’t move no dancing   I just realized that a fat stick is a turd well u feel great
I never knew this was a skinny people thing always thought it was a m ME thing this was t TOO relatable
I wish that I could get back to when I looked like this. Now I've got the skinny fat deal going on
I felt this. I've been skinny after my whole life. I'm a 6 1 dude and I've finally hit 170lbs I weighed 138 2 years ago
Ok those dance moves were fire idk what u mean🔥
It's worse when society calls you fat and to lose some weight in kindergarten
As a skinny person  This is 100% accurate
I can't relate I probably have like 5 in on every bone that is exaggerating of course
Are you a girl or a boy?
Still dance better than me🥺
Thought I was over until I saw this and looked in the mirror 😂
Finally!!!!!! Something so relatable.
All the skinnies out there want you to make a video on gaining weight too
skinny issues are real
Fr especially the people talking shit
Me to
It's so goddam true !!
No, you can dance. You just showed us some moves!
The last one isn’t a skinny problem Most people just suck at it me included
i can relate totally
you probably cant dance because ur white im not trying to be racist
“I can’t dance” *proceeds to fucking break it down*
Not Sure the last one has to do with you being skinny
As a skinny kid yes this is true
"I cant dance!" *Proceeds to dance better than my sister*  She's paralyzed btw
“That’s really bad to say to a kid” Yes, when I was like 4 years old and I still get told, but I was told that I needed meat on my bones all the time and that I looked like a fricken piece of paper.
Alright i was born skinny and physically can't change this (medical stuff) BUT NO ONE TOLD ME HOW YOU WILL ALWAYS BE COLD like I've been skinny my whole life and I dont mind the comments about me but to this day eating ice cream is amazing but also feels like I'm about to have internal frost bite
If you are skinny, Just gain weight 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
This is so fucking true.
THis is just too relatable. I've been skinny my whole life, even today. I struggle with these ALL the time. The thing most people say is that I'll BLOW over and crack into a million pieces in the wind. like that's ever gonna happen.
When she said she can't dance  Bitch you can dance better than me😔
As a skinny person who goes to school The sitting one is hell it self
I've never seen something so relatable
I have a bony butt and I feel like I'm always cold - except on the middle of summer, then I'm overheating to the point of getting sick. 🙃
Astro See her dance 🐶: nani  fuckkkkk run
its true!
I’m skinny, and I beat the cold, as long as it isn’t extremely cold
I’m super skinny and it’s crazy I play hochy as a goalie and people say this stuff to me and say I would play badly but when I play I am the best goalie in my Area
Skinny people just can’t dance?
Make one on tall person problems 🤣 I'm 6,5 and my life is hell ☠️
this happens to basically all the skinny people and im also a skinny guy so yea i can also confirm
The dancing situation might be a you problem
I can confirm
The best thing was the most accurate thing evvver
So no one else gonna comment how absolute fire those dance moves were, I had the fire department predialed just incase it started a fire
Great, now she just stated the Skinny Community!! 🤣
Uh I thought your dancing was pretty good
I have all of those problems. I get that comment too
pretty sure i can dance thats a you problem
Fat people: damn, I’m doing the right thing
Same but I can dance
My teacher once commented on me being skinny because I never eat breakfast and sometimes skip lunch and now guess what, I'm still fucking mad Ms. Besnecker, yeah, you, fuck you!
relatable every thing you said is true and i am still skinny as hell
Same
True.
Can relate 100%, except I can dance 😂
it's so dumb that people think we don't eat, actually so fucked up.
That’s me I’m 12 AA hockey goalie and not even 80 pounds
Your dance is lit 🤣🤣🤣👌👌
I’m not skinny but I have the same problems 👍
I'm a skinny bitch and have no problem dancing, it just takes some practice.  However you're super spot on with everything else 😊
Do some tall people problems😅 I can’t even wash dishes without my neck hurting
You know it’s funny cuz im skinny af but like my friends tease me not because im skinny but because i eat so much i never get fat
Totally relatable 😂😒
Yep same here I usually get called green bean or toothpick it's really annoying 5 is super accurate
I can relate, my ass bones hurt sometimes when I sit.
Omg I relate to this, although the last one I'm not sure
As a guy being skinny it's made me feel really trash and weak, I workout all the time but just bad genetics
True
Well everything in this video is straight up facts and yet I'm still suffering 😭
Everything you said in this video is relatable
Yes
U are spitting facts about my life it's hard
I HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS AHHHHHHHH I KEPT SAYING YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!! (except the dancing part😅love that)
I've been skinny all my life, and honestly people can make you feel bad for being skinny, I can't help it
You can definitely dance dude
Just saying, as a slightly larger person, I still can’t dance. I’m not overweight, just extremely tall,
yes these are all true. I have high metabolism so i never gain weight. I am in middle school and weigh 80 pounds lol
Me too
I have all of these problems because I’m a stick
Approved by me so......
I have these issues but I am not skinny it's just I'm 4,10 so like 🤪🤪🤪
Yo those are some sick dance moves
I think the dancing is just you
I completely understand
I literally relate to this entire video other than the not dancing part and I honestly hate it when people tell me to go eat something because only my close friends realize I eat a ton but I don’t gain any weight so when people say you should eat more/ do you eat I just get so mad at them like seriously 😒
I know all of these
This might be the only time I'm grateful that I have a fat behind because it cushions so well
Same here
Oml I relate to this my friend is always like “oh my gosh did you even eat?”   I think I should get new friends
😂😂😂
I think I'm skinny? I've been weighting myself in these days and all I see is something between 40 and 55 I think? I also get cold very easily, like I've to really close my room's door, but I also have Macrocytic Anemia, and I'm also short.
Jayus is the goat
Bro all of this is so true. Especially the ribs T3T so please, people out there, please DO NOT SAY THAT BEING SKINNY IS AWESOME AND PLS PLS PLS STAP TELLING US TO EAT A LOT!! We’re trying T~T
Yes u can dance
This is just me, this one is so damn relatable each and every part off this video
She’s right
Them dance moves tho😍
All of these are true 😂
Try skinny and short
Omg same I’m 12 and weigh 89 pounds
My sister is skinny too and she literally has all these problems like she wears a hoodie in 90 degree weather and everyone always tells her to eat something  …also she can’t dance either lol
Wth did I watch at the end
And booty, ur pants always look saggy
Here here
Being made fun of for not eating enough is so ironic bc I eat more than most of my chubby friends
Me the overweight- Bruh we people can't even MOVE.... You guys are 1010019394884487403939939484874 times luckier than us  But that common thing remains- Skinny- go eat a burger  Overweight- don't evem try to breathe the nitrogen of the chips packet it'll add 7 kgs to yo mass
As a skinny person, I can say that all of this is true...oh,and also, I don't know if it's just me,but I can feel some of my bones. And I'm 6,8 and 18 yrs old...dang,
I've lost a lot of weight recently and started getting really itchy. Maybe it's an unknown allergy or I spread around a bit of poison ivy I have but I don't think it's either of those and that Im just really skinny. Can anyone relate?
And kneeling…it feels like someone is driving a screwdriver into your bones
You forgot to mention the fact that when you sit down when you try and use the back rest it hurts your spine
Your better than me at dancing lol
Did that scale say 67 pounds lol nah it gots to be in KG
Fat problems: 1.) Death at any time.
Omg so accurate
I can absolutely relate to that
I'm pretty skinny so I don't weigh much even though I'm kinda tall, but recently I've found the best solution is muscle. That's right fellow lazy gamers if you don't want your butt bones to hurt after saying "One more game" you need to put some muscle between you and the outside world. If your an introvert even better! I sadly will be leaving the skinny community and get some muscle (not really I won't miss this non-existant group)
That dance has to be one the best things I saw, ever
Jayus is so pretty.
0:43 the best dance I've seen in my entire life.
I can agree I am very skinny
Yeah sounds right I can eat eat and eat and then have very little exercise then not gain a pound been trying to gain weight since I was 12 and I've been 140-150 for ever 4 years now
Dancing had me dead 😂😭😭
That’s a beautiful dance
I can relate to most of these and I'm in the overweight category if that makes you feel any better?
Next video should be: Problems with fat people
You r hot
Haha metabolism go brrrrrrr
Clicked like as soon as i found that it was not my fault that cannot dance.😢
She still sexy before and after
A guy literally told me "next time wind blows, hold someone's hand so you don't fly away" bruhhhhh
When I was rly young whenever it got super windy I literally found it difficult to stand in place, I’m such a stickman that I was just blowing away in the breeze. (AND I HATE SITTING OK THOSE HARD PLASTIC SCHOOL CHAIRS FOR HOURS AT A TIME)
Oh man, WHAT A BUMMER.
My mom and big brother would always say #5 to me as a kid 😂
SAME
Me too
I can confirm that all of this is true In my life at least
Im 6'1 and weigh about 60kg and all mates when ever we are out or some thing just having like a little get together will tell me to order a larger meal or something like that cause im the tallest and the lightest
Why is this so relatable everytime I sit down my but gets itchy and it hurts and I also get cold very fast
My mom always skinny person. When I was 17 and she was in 40 and she was skinnier than me. But she passed menapause and bam she's not so skinny anymore lol
I HAD TO POKE NEWS HOLES IN A 28 WAIST BELT AMD I'M 145LBS
YESSS THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THISSS!!!   My sister’s boyfriend came up to me one day and says “uhhh do you eat much?” And I was “uh yes” and he was like “ohh so you must just have a very fast metabolism” and I was like 😑
I CAN'T DANCE  *proceeds to dust me on the dance floor*
I have the same problem buttt I eat alot but I don't get fat and idk why frjjjkyyejhsjrdhfr
I Felt This..
Yea poking holes in the belt is definitely one I do
That dance tho 😂😂😂😂
All of this is facts
Still cyoot tho 🥺👉👈
Jayus: I can't dance!  * start throwing some moves *
Omg I am skinny too I hate it when I literally just get into a pool and then I have to get out literally the second after
Bro what are you talking about??? You needa go to America or Britain's got talent show thing cus you got em dance moves
Yup feel the same
Why can i relate soooo much
Why is FUCKING WOLD DO LOOK MY CRUSH
The frick do u mean “cant dance” ur good 😎😂💅
i am 5,3 and Way up to 95 pounds but i am soo skinny that i get comments like that
As a skinny person this is relatable like extremely relatable
So true
Im 13 and only 80 Pounds and I used to be 60 when I was 12 I can relate to this so much
I don't know. I feel like ya got da moves Jayus my friend
I can relate to all of these 😂 I’m trying to fix it I just like forget to eat- but ofc I’m starving at 2 in the morning.
As a skinny person I can agree
SAME
I have been fat my whole life and cannot relate to these specifically but can relate to having to deal with people's stupid comments
na you can dance better than me at least
Even if you are a normal weight. If you have a flat ass and you are a guy, you pants with still fall. Squats do nothing when 😂😂
The dancing part is not a skinny person problem…
Skinny gang! But yeah jayus, I don't think if you're skinny you can't dance. My sister is a literal bone and she can dance. And I can't. I think it's just our inability to dance.
she can DANCE🤣
Yhea I can very much related but I agree with everything till the dance part that not cause you skinny
Skinny with an eating disorder (I wouldn't eat at all) NOT FUN!! -9999999/10 do not do!
I can relate to ALL of these
I CAN RELATE 🥲🥲😢😭😭😭😭😭
I was always told to eat more growing up cause I was so skinny..
OMG SAME! So I’m like 4’11 and I’m 59 pounds so I’m like SKINNY like skinnier than the the letter “I” so ppl always say “eat a burger!” “Do you even eat at all?” “Omg I wish I could be you.. but I’m scared I’d break in half LOL” and I’m 11 so that’s just- anyways, I do dance and I’m flexible and some of my friends and kinda fat and so anything where I bend in half, their like “NO GIRL YOUR GONNA BREAK STOP YOUR HURTING MY BACK BY LOOKING AT YOU!” So that always makes me sad😢
… I think the danceing is just you
And we CANNOT get comfortable if we lay down on anything, because there is no meat on our bones to lay on.
I can relate completely
I now how it fwels
I am short and skinny making me physically smaller than the vast majority of the people my age
Jayus, you've got nice moves, they're kinda like mine
Those dance moves tho🤣🤣
PURE FACTS.
I’m short and skinny and I’m a junior in high school and my friends say hey go eat more food. Well I can’t because I’m not hungry it’s very annoying
My nana's friend asked if I have an e.d... I dont
I am really skinny person but somehow I never get cold
This is to relatable
The society is the worst part, makes me mad. Also I’ve poked so many holes in my belts and watches
Can't dance  Skinny damcers be like:👁👄👁☝️ I-
Get pregnant and you will get fat.
Damn that’s relatable.. my family will never truly know how much of my disordered eating came from their comments about me being so skinny
as a skinny person, THIS IS VERY ACCURATE
You need a fat bf to insulate you
The dance is just a you problem 😂😂🤨🤨😭😭😭
i relate to the clothes one and the cold one 😂... and the dance one... 😂 😭
Can’t dance  *proceeds to break it down*
As a big person, I’m scared for skinny people’s longevity on this earth
Legit same
I feel so bed for people who can't control their weight especially because people make comments about them like stuff about them starving themselves which really is not ok but also if you fall there is nothing to cushion that fall so it's gonna hurt so much more and falling already feels like I'm about to die so I just can't imagine how painful that would be if it hurts to sit falling must suck
I can relate very much. And it hurts
This was relatable
I am skinny lad
You can definitely dance.
As a skinny person I can relate
Maybe you should focus on the positive. You can jump on a sink without breaking it
The belt thing 😂 ugh i wish that memory wasn’t just unlocked.  watches too! To this day i struggle with watch bands even though my weight is way better
There's also the comments "oh my god! You weigh so little! You must be soooo healthy!" Like I am close to being a legal adult yet I've never weighed over 90 pounds. That's not healthy.
You can still get the D 🤷‍♂️👑🧖‍♀️💋
Jayus,  I admire your style.
Yeah same girl I was so tiny when I was a baby and still am I had to be put in one of those amulets but it's a helicopter when I was baby cuz I was too little to breathe because my mom had smoked when I was in her belly
Yay skinny problems. Fuck I can relate to EVERY SINGLE ONE of these
All my life people have been telling me that I was but this happens to me 24/7 I just now realized that the people in my life are pretty toxic Should I get a therapist
I was ridiculously skinny until maybe 5th grade, and I guess I kept up my heavy eating but my metabolism slowed down so now I have the physique of a twice divorced, middle aged accountant
"skinny people problems" lift weights  lady.
Wow. Finally confirmed if OnlyJayus is a guy or a girl. No joke I literally couldn't tell
I can relate to you,but no bruises on my rib's,and I can't dance either...and that's fucked up to say to a kid 😂
As a 46 kilo skinny noodle, I can confirm
Same girl 😩😭
AYO YOU GOT MOVES
Ummm is being fat bad or skinny...comment below
But I’m over here fat as hell
I relate.
Shes the kind of crazy girl you'd want in a party lol
I'm 5'1 and 85 pounds (38.5 kilograms). The worst part is that I'm 15 years old Edit: I'm male
My mum called me a monkey, short and scrawny
This is very true
Every con you just named is my Pro
I mean like i dont really pay attention to anyones body shape bc its not that really important
I'm glad I subscribed to your Channel. Keep up the good work. Love your videos. Btw you're absolutely beautiful.😉
Skinny ppl problems are fat ppl problems but the opposite
Man, I’m not skinny (nor am i fat, imo) and sitting in certain areas hurt
Just one word.....True!! 🌟🌟
200 pounds under 14 feelin obese *eats a dorito*
As a skinny person, can confirm. Also, you dance a lot better than I do
Ikr, one of my friends mom, the first thing she said to me (every time I saw her) she would say you need to eat a cheese burger, and I'd just smile and say ok
i recently hit 80 pounds and im 14
What?! But I've seen her twerking video and I thought it was lit...lol
Yes but as a teenager you eat so much even more than those that are less say a bit to big and you weight the same like 2 days later
I need to bleach my eyes after see her dance
Was told I was skinny growing up. Tbh I didn't mind as much, and I understood it was out of concern, cause I was REALLY scrawny with a big head😂 And it not like I was gonna be angry with my grandparents, especially if they're taking us through Macas drive through every other day😍😂
I have those problems. I've been wearing a size 10 in jeans for years. And it doesn't fit. I wear them because they are the onky thinhs that fit my waist. All the other problems i can relate to too
As a 5,2 skinny AF!! Person I get this and good the someone finally talked about this
As someone who's been 105-115 most of my life... This is was too true...
I don't think being skinny has anything to do with your dancing skills Jayus....  Jkjk ❤️😂
As a skinny person I cannot dance either :(
1,2,3 and 6 all happen to me and i am not skinny by anyone’s standards
I wish my body was thin like that. For some reason, It’s never good Enough. We’re either too big or too small. Clothes don’t fit. I’m too big. Can’t eat right to lose the weight. Can’t seem to stay small. I’m not weight healthy and I look fat. Yet I try to eat ok and excerise. Why can’t my body just be thin? I gain weight so fast that I shame myself for anything fried. It’s a mental struggle.
As a fat person I can’t confirm
i wish i was skinny im ugly asf
The dancing part was just an excuse
You just have a high metabolism.   Funny enough, every female that thinks they are fat want to be like yourself.   That's how life is...
I have officially liked every...single...video...that jayus has done...  I checked
The last one is crab or a bad dancer now because you’re skinny I’m sorry but it’s true
You are sooooo pretty honestly.Not coming across all freaky Bundy type of way hopefully🤣but always watch your clips before work and not only are your videos funny and informative but your honestly sooooo pretty.Hopefully im not coming across like the King of Cringe!!!!!!
Yes omg so relatable
Well I’m skinny, and I don’t know how to dance either so.. yeah
I agree with all these things besides the cold one, I go out in winter wearing summer clothes and I am just a ice cube, but I never notice
sitting on a couch rn and i can vouch that my ass hurts
The biggest assumption you getting being skinny is that you have an ED
It true so I purposely gained 125-72= ya ima a math freak so do this simple equation to find out
whatever man, at least I can still go thru a chair that's 4 inch close to the wall 😌
Kpop idols on the last one:......
Me at 6,3 205 can relate to not being able to dance
It me. 135 pound skinny dead inside white Boi. It me.
*sigh* finally
Most relatable thing ever!!
I can relate but not for last one
All of this is a fact for me
I don't understand skinny shaming. Being skinny is GOOD and healthy. It should be encouraged, not shamed. Most of the US is REALLY obese.
I'm *s l i g h t l y* fat but you can't really see it. My friend is also very skinny and she is always cold and I'm always hot. So I'm basically her warm bag. But I also have another skinny friend who is like me and never gets cold. It might be cos of her genes or because she ice skates so much.
I diagree with the one about your dancing, its amazing i dont know what you mean
YESSSS PREACH BRO PREACH
As a fat guy I cnat dance either😂
Was a skinny person i thank you for this
as a fat person. i’d rather be skinny af than be fat af
You know, I’m 5’4/5’5 and I weigh 145 pounds. I weigh as much as my bf and it’s embarrassing. Yet, I’m not over weight or underweight and I’m not big boned. It bothers me a lot because friends my age and height weigh less than I do. 😩
This girl entitled af!!! Saying she has no moves when girl was busting down 😤😤😤 she can dance on me any day 💃
Im so skinny my ribs are kinda visible
She got a body of a cereal box  *starts to wiggle and dance to da song/the sayibg*
Never experienced number 5, but the first four I have/ do and it’s annoying
I can relate been skinny my whole life
this makes me feel better for being *big* *PLUMPY* and *T H I C K*
The poking holes in the belt was so fu*king relatable
I just saw a little of the 90's  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW3IsjEA6Bg
I’m also very skinny and this is sooo true
Literally today my 300 ppund patient told me I was small when I asked if she wanted to use me to pull on to stand. I have carried this woman up a flight of stairs on 3 occasions (with help cuz I like my spine) for us fast metabolism dudes and dudettes, even if we hit the gym and can bench press 3/4ths our body weight we are still fucking skinny under all this corporate baggy clothing
I'm 46. Every time I run into someone I know they say, wow you're so thin. No sht. Same as the last 30 yrs you've known me.
Yep! As a skinny, it's relatable to me 🙂
I hate it when people are like "you're so skinny I can fit my hand around your waist." and I can fit mine around your throat so enough with calling me skinny
I don’t get the bruises on my ribs sense I don’t bruise easily but I do get the butt pains which sucks... and my pants fit lol o guess I’m just lucky idk and can anyone rlly dance good? Rlly? It’s just moving ur thingys In a weird way... which I can’t do nor do I care that I can’t do lol
#teamseas
Don't worry man. I'm fat and I can't dance either lmaoooo
A skinny person I can relate
I’m fat and I can’t dance
As a skinny person myself I can confirm all of these things are true especially the cold one
Im 13 yo rn and now im 5,9... AND IM FUCKING SKINNY I ONLY WEIGHT 38KG
Everyday i deal with this my guy i feel for u. Also me parents keep the house freezing
I should tell this to my mother maybe she woudnt keep on fatshaming me 😊
Onlyjasus is always right believe me I’m skinny and clothes are such a pain
I get this so much I'm so skinny
Yep, skinny bois for life And you wouldn’t believe how much I eat and exercise believe me I’m trying everything to get “more meaty”
Do another one about racist people problems
My ADHD meds fuck up my appetite, and that's why I'm skinny 🥲
I would give you half of me if it was possible and/or legal
This connects to me really much lol
You only way 66.4 the hell am I seeing shit
as a skinny person I FUCKING RELATE
Skinny person here. I approve this message.
get the hell down from there
As a whatever is the correct term for the opposite of skinny, this is very interesting.
I'm curvy and chubby but I still have those problems because my waist is really small
That dance is cringe
I've been skinny af my entire life and I'm just 13, I eat the most in my family (tbh I could be a mukbanger if I wanted to lmao) and all that weight converts into height, I've been getting rude comments from my relatives since I was 6, and now they wonder why I don't talk to them 😐
Ha oh god don’t forget that we eat even more than normal people and doesn’t effect us at least not me..   Am I sick..?
As a skinny person all I can say is yes
accurate
As a skinny short person I can relate to no insulation so me and blankets are soulmates🤣
The dancing one you where great and like if you would take dNce classes you could
As a skinny person I agree
Yep I'm 19 and I'm 110 lbs
Big person here *I have the belt problem I have weird waist shape maybe-*
finally a video i can relate to
What do you mean bad dancing?
Ooooooh wow it’s so hard to be in shape….
Your an amazing dancer
I'm skinny and it's the coldness pants like 3 time the comments and I Really don't know how to dance
The belt one is relatable my belt has like two wholes that i liked into it
I am 6’1 and 110kg, I’m not fat but I’m not all muscle, I’m in the middle somewhere and I can’t for the life of me find clothes that fit, people are scared to walk past me on the street and I do all the heavy lifting at work :/
I relate I am almost 13 and I just hit 90 pounds and 5 feet
How do you stop headaches I get them a lot
Did that say 6_ or 600
I’m skinny sooo the one thing I hate when people say is how ever much food u are eating u need to do time 2. Like I’m 16 right I eat two breakfast two lunches and two dinners and I don’t gain a pound sooo like how does that work 😂😂
As a very tall and skinny person can agree many cons many pros
I am skinny I can relate
you got the moves like jagger
As a skinny person  All of these but I can in fact dance
Me at 5 10ish and 120 pounds: Can relate
It’s the worst being called skinny or short I get that all the time not only by my parents or family it’s also my friends
I’m 15 and just got 100 pounds but I still have a slight fear when ever it’s very windy that I would become a plastic bag in the wind and just fly
You should get a grip belt, they are fully adjustable, and they feel nice, I am saying this cause I have one myself
That's pretty much me but i LIVE on the cold
1. Flat chested 86 pound (39 kg) 13 year old.  2. It’s hard being underweight- like this is a bit irrelevant, but I’m always cold and that’s definitely a complaint of mine 3. I fking hate myself sometimes; I’m so skinny and I’m a late bloomer because of it 4. I was walking to my house today when I actually started getting blown away 🌚 🔫😁🤠👹🔪👍😔✋🥲
you can’t dance but it will keep girls/boys away from you in the club
I am skinny to lol neither can I dance and my pants fall down and I'm cold 24/7
Trust me your not the only one who suffers
As a skinny person i RELATE TO LITERALLY EVERYTHING SHE JUST SAID
52 kgs here male
I love the cold
These are relatable
If belts don't fit turn to suspenders they will always fit
Skinny shaming is the same as fat shaming I wish people would stop I've been skinny shamed my whole life "maybe you wouldnt be cold if you had some meat on your bones" 🤨
I had no clue how to dance. Went to clubs (many years ago) and just copied what other people were doing. Seems to have worked.
Yeah growing up everyone felt the need to tell me how skinny i was.....got really old really quick
This is relatable afffff
I am pretty skinny and all of these are true. Especially the society one, I have sooo manyyy people telling me, “oh my god, go put some meat on your bones. Go out some meat on your bones.” And it hurts wayyyy more than people think cause you try sooooo harddd
I hear some people call you racist are you
I'm currently 16, 5'3" and 100 pounds. I'm skinny af basically and underweight. No matter how much I eat, i dont gain weight. I've gotten so many anorexic comments from my classmates. It doesnt affect me but it's very rude to assume such things. For example, a very troublesome guy literally called me the other day "an anorexic bitch." I explained to him that I'm not anorexic, I just have a fast metabolism but he said I'm either lying or anorexic. It got on my nerves but I didnt say anything. So yeah that's what I face everyday
This is soooo me
I am trippin or is this a repost? There's been a few, with your old hairstyle..
I think the last one is a you problem
It really does suck having a extra extra extra fast metabolism
As a super skinny person I can relate to every single one of these 🥺😳
Being a little fat (like I'm 10% fat) I also can't dance BC my stomach just goes dizzy
Same but is twerckinf count as dancing cause I can do that
I have joined the siky club I HAVE 1% OF CLOTHES THAT FIT
I feel your pain
I realate to this so much
And what sucks more is even if your do eat alot, you're still skinny!  Mentabolism, slow down a bit! I'm tryna be in a healthy weight!
Fr fr the only I don’t agree with is dancing
Being skinny i so relate on bright side we have few good perks down side is what you said and its so hard for us to even gain weight no matter how much we eat or do as we also typically  have a ridiculously high metabolism.
Six foot two woman can dance well
the dancing made me smile, thanks for that💖
i was underweight before, i was 18 KG for 2 years straight, no joke.
Well I’m happy to be husky cause I’m used to being cold a lot
Another thing - knuckle push-ups are impossible
As a skinny person this is all very true cause I've had people tell me to quit starving myself when I'm not I was just born really skinny
I can comfirm
Yeah, but she do be groovin tho
I'm fat and I still have to put new holes in my belt😭
FAAAAAACTS
#skinnypeople 😞😤
Aaaaay. Blue shirt.
As a fellow skinny person who just now hit 160. I think of it as at least I'm not going to get fat like everyone else.
I fuckin love you bro 💯
The part where you can’t dance I CANT DANCE EITHER
This is facts I’m small as hell but I got bigger over time
I eat alot but im still skinny sa fuck??
Ok
I can agree with this, I swear this happenes almost everyday
As a stick, this is very relatable. I was about 70 pounds but 5’4 in 5th grade lol
yea this is relatable
Yeah I'm overweight now for a reason I was skinny my whole entire childhood and I was always told "gain some weight" "you're so skinny" "go eat something" "do you even eat" and I got into the habit of eating all the time and multiple snacks and now I'm overweight and can't lose weight
I am the same I hate this even getting cold fast
I dont think others realize how hurtful it is to be told you need to eat more cuz you're too skinny. Thanks for bringing up what I'm already self conscious about. If you only KNEW how much I ate 🤣😂 I've been called "sickly" once 😒
All facts
I am 2.7kg away from being underweight
Omg so tru The ass thing,the rib thing,the belt and everything Thank god im not alone.
Ugh I'm tall and skinny and I hate it
Me the other way around
Oh my goodness the dance moves are so funny I feel bad for this girl😁😁😁
Too skinny? Have a Mcdonalds!
Love the dancing and I’m trying to get to a healthy weight I’m 12 and 61.9 lbs
I'm thicker than a Bowl of oatmeal and cant dance
Can confirm except the dancing part 😂
F yeah. I'm also skinny.
Omg the dancing tho🤣
I’m kinda in between, I don’t get bruises but the butt one is SO TRUE it does hurt after sitting down for quite a bit.I get SO COLD and the belt one AHHHHHHHH relatable😩!!! And the people saying things is why I’m SO ANTISOCIAL   I CAN NOT DANCE AHHHHHHHHH😤
Thanks I just lost my ass after laughing at the dances. I hope you're happy now.
Yes to all of it. Also, I eat like a hwrd of pigs. IT DONT HELP
Don’t know what your talking about but those dance moves are better than mine
This is so relatable
There is nothing worse than being cold all the time, especially during winter
I slide down my chair so I dont have to sit on my ass for long
literally so relatable 😭💔 and I've been bullied still... I'm only 15 chile..leave me alone 😭 I'll eat more and I'm trying
It’s ok I’m 175 and 14 and can’t dance
I wear a hoodie everywhere I go because I'm skinny and everytime I take my hoodie off when I'm outside it is freezing cold 😩
I'll give you some of my weight. I finally got to under 200 pounds.
In certainly not skinny but i have a lot of these issues as well 😅 i think its mostly just extremes of both sides have problems. Like for a big guy it gets hot fast. The comments when being a child are very similar but you know the fat version. And suprisingly fat is NOT A CUSHION it does not help in anyway. Anway appreciated the video
So tru
OML YES MY GOD I get bruises every where so easily. I wake up every morning and find a new bruise somewhere on my body -_-
Why is this so relatable
That and the fact that I’m short 4’8 to be specific
Gril same
#1 worst thing, bone doesn’t cushion, you bump your elbow, not your funny bone, your elbow, have fun having pain for the next 3 days
Like dancing ain’t just skinny people problems
I just hit 115 pounds this year and I can say this is all true
I would rather be called skin and bones vs fat Mammoth / oh my God there's an earthquake / you need to go on a diet /anything else?   And part about sitting is incorrect because the same thing goes for me and I am overweight.  Maybe the ribs bruising is realistic but I rather have that happen then not allowed to be on a ride at a theme park.  So the society part is incorrect because most people don't make fun of you if you are skinny.  I'm not saying being overweight is worse than being underweight but socially it is worse and with most over weight people it's mentally hard to deal with what people say.  Also it's hard to have my clothes always be too small and every other month I had to buy new clothes because the clothes I have are we too small for me to fit.  And let's say I'm walking down the street I hate having to just be wearing the shirt because it shows the side of my stomach popping out ( love handles) (look it up if you don't know what "love handles" are it hurts because everybody can see and when you go to a gym you get people that stare at you and then say oh why is he here he should be at McDonald's eating a Big Mac.  P.S. - no hate comments and please leave your opinion down below!!!  Have a wonderful day!!!
i relate.
I'm not quite as skinny but I am not very tall and have small but long hands and feet and finding well-fitting rings, bracelets and shoes can be pesky. So many rings are too big even for my thumb! If the shoe is long enough for my foot, it'll often be too wide, so if it doesn't cover the top of my foot it needs a strap or it'll fall off when I walk! Also as a kid I totally had the pants problem, and to top it off i have long legs (basically I have similar proportions to Sailor Moon) so pants ended up too short if I wanted the waist to fit! Also so much freezing my butt off especially in schools and restaurants!
forgot the good old "omg i can wrap my hand around your wrist" a classic right there
it's not the food that I need,I need exercise you fucks
One time during spring break I didn't  eat for 2 days OH BOY DID MY STOMACH  HURT AND OH BOY DID MY POOP BEING GREENER THAN A FRIGIGN SWAMP , your welcome for describing 😊💚
I just have an ass that I didn't want man 🤣 but yes short has its perks
Oof that sucks I'm fat
I agree😔
Lol. Same I have these problems. My nicknames at school are skinny mini, stick, line, some thing like that I hate it
I got the comments about me being skinny my entire life, but the shocker is my grandpa on my dads side threatened to sue my parents for child neglect for not feeding me even though I’m just skinny.
For my relatively low weight I've got a dump truck of an ass, and it still hurts to sit on hard surfaces for extended periods of time.
I can relate 💀
bro the ass bones part is facts>>> same w the cold and also being tall and skinny sucks bc u can’t online shop for pants🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
So true I’m vegan so people use that against me too but I’ve been skinny my whole life too so before I was vegan but I’ve never ate a burger
Uh why not uh eat more like overweighted ppl (well, to the point where you are no longer too boney)
I don’t know WHY and HOW. No matter how much I eat, I will NEVER get more meat in my chopsticks arms, like my mum’s friends wishes that they could still be skinny/fit no matter how much they eat like me. BUT IT’S LIKE FALSE HOPE
Felt this 😩
Still cute tjo
Ass a skinny person who eats a lot I want to thank my ancestors
Killer dance moves! [said the skinny person]
Gunnery sergeant in mcjrotc was cutting belts and he told me to eat a cheeseburger cause I had to get 14 inches cut off😭
When someone says “ hang on to her she’s to skinny she’s going to fly in this wind”
Try metal shows! You looked like you would fit in perfect at one of those dancing lol 😂😂🤘🤘❤❤
Im a skinny person but i love the cold
I know how it feels I’m barely 100 pounds at 5,9  and the ass cheek statement and dance statement is true it’s not the best being skinny but there are a ton of things good about being skinny
Laying down happens to I think everyone
Those dance moves tho 😏
Lol I thought I was the only 13 yr old getting made fun of cuz I can't dance haha
As a skinny person I have very small wrists and that small bone that make a little lump on the outer part of your wrist (what ever it’s called) my friend once thought it was a mosquito bite. I had to explain to him for a few minutes that it was a bone not a huge mosquito bite 😂
The chaos in ur videos lmao
People used to say that to me when i was little (Put some meat on your bones) now im chunky
I used to be very skinny, UNTIL I STARTED EATING 50 MEALS PER DAY. But as a former skinny person, all of these problems are facts
As a person how can see my rib cage through my skin I can confirm
Yes
This is a me :(
Be careful what you wish for💀
My grandma always commented on how skinny I was a kid (im still really skinny though) but it caused me a lot of anxiety so I always wore baggy clothes all the way up to middle school.
Same
Not dancing is not a skinny problem my friend
I eat low but I'm getting weight so fast
I've been called Skeletor forever 💀 it's not fun and it can be painful and shit it's cold
I can’t relate, I’m fat af ✌️
I'm skinny 110
I'm skinny and people tell me to eat more I can eat more then anyone I know
Not being able to dance is just a white person thing don't worry it's not cause your skinny
Same but I get go eat but I est a lot and I have like 5 new holes in my belt
I can’t dance either
"I acnt dance" im skinny, i can dance, thats a you problem jayus
I'm plus sized as fuck and you're not alone in the lack of dancing skills lol
“Go eat” only goes to my stomach  And there’s the skinny forearms so a lot of stuff doesn’t fit snug
The dancing is because you’re white.
You’re dancing looks like a skinny white guy’s dancing when he’s real high and definitely not sober
i love this video, as a skinny person!
I’m currently 13 and people used, and still do, think I have (or had) a eating disorder. I won’t have huge meals or eat a lot but I’m not hurting myself and it makes me feel like I have to eat a lot or big meals 😕
Btw some of the reasons that people say that your so skinny stuff like that is bc there jealous of your weight I just asked a lot of people and they said that sooo-
So relatable
do you know that where I live almost all the girls want to be as skinny as you
Teachers would always take my jackets so id just have to freeze in the sun
I’m skinny my entire life and these are all facts
I DONT GAIN WEIGHT NO MATTER WHAT I EAT
MAN I POKE NEW HOLES ON MY BELT COOOL
You absolutely cannot forget when people put their hands around your wrist and say how skinny you are.
Lol I wish I was skinny tho, cause all I do is eat and I get so frikin fat tho
All but the last,being skinny there's only 2 moves that work,robotic dancing or popping 😁👍
Hahahahahhahahahahahahahaahahahaha
Eat more
Me who is skinny and in shorts and a tank top in the snow :)
I think your adorable
I have the same problems except for number 3 I’m always dying of heat
Don't forgot getting picked up by the wind as a kid
I was 64lbs when I was in 4th grade
My least favorite thing anyone has said to me, being skinny, is " Oh my gosh, you're so skinny! I can fit my hand around your wrist!"
Me, a chonker: ah yes, relatable 👁👁💧
I would rather have these problems than my fat*ss problems
this is extremely true
These are all 100% skinny people problems
its 100% true, im very skinny
I straight up look like a skeleton you'd find in a dollar store
Can relate
We have the same name, and we are both rlly skinny and like the same style. Literally every thing here is relatable. XD And I weigh like almost half of what im supposed to. XD
as a not-so-skinny-person i’m actually kinda glad i have some meat on my bones even though i wish i was skinnier
Awesome dancsr!! Shut up!
Bella, I just know wtf is just wrong with you. I mean, you definitely got the good/healthy attitude (well I guess) in your videos. I just wanted to say, I love just exactly how you are, whatever you think about yourself ❤️❤️❤️
I vouch this
I'm skinny and o agree with all if these
I weigh 80 pounds and I’m 5ft
Even worse when your "friends" are complaining that "you are sooo skinny", even if I like eat pizza and hamburgers....
Yes
Even as an obese person, I can relate! But I feel most people don’t realize the "hate" against thin people, in my case, it's almost expected that I have been bullied because of my weight, but so many don't see the same thing happening to Thin people😥   As an obese person : Sitting down: not fitting in chairs Laying down: hurting (never know why, but can be my chronic illness) Clothes don't fit: most of clothing brands don't make over XL or XXL... And belts never fit either, so you will have to poke holes at the very end, and often it is still too tight Society: I mostly eat healthy, but is overweight because of chronic illnesses... I could never eat something around people that wasn't pur salad, people would comment: should you really have that? And give the most hurtful look ever (thanks to this I now have an eating disorder, that people don’t take seriously, because I'm overweight) Can't dance either: looks horrible, even though I can some steps, but just looks horrible🙈
Im skinny it true for me
The rib thing sucks tho- like even laying on my side at night, I'll wake up with bruises on my ribs ☹
Who would have thought the youngest Hanson had real life issues
That's me
i get told i’m too skinny and i get told a lot i need to eat but the doctors say i’m a healthy weight TwT
I’m skinny but I can dance
IM CAN SOOOO AGREE SAME
as i am 'skinny' i confirm.
I'm not under way too and I'm not trying to make you guys feel insecure or anyting but I have the second problem because I have a very large rib cage because I sang and I did do a lot of sports as a kid and so my rib cage grew to get the air in oxygen that I needed and I'll say this it hurts like s*** yet again this is just a problem I have is well I just wanted to point out that I am at a healthy weight do a lot of people say that I'm too skinny simply because my rib cage is large however the rest of my body is completely fine fat wise
1,3,4&5 are issues with me and I'm not skinny. Though, no matter a person's size people should not body shame. Not cool.
Than learn how to dance
I really struggle with finding clothes that fit it sucks
Okay but that last one is a you problem not a skinny people problem
That was the sexiest-worst dancing ever.
I disagree your a great dancer👍👍👍
Same
been underweight my whole life, the struggle is real man, because like, WE HAVE NO TITTIES, TITTIES DON'T EXIST FOR US
I'm not unhealthy but u just gave no body fat. I try but nothing works
So true this is me for sure
*-vibes in 6 foot 6 and literally only 120 pounds-*
I only make mean skinny comments to people who say mean things about me being chubby
Nah you can dance
As a fatty its nice to hear the other half problems we all have insecurities when I lost my weight the insulation thing was so true god same that shits cold haha great vid
Same here all my life 🤣🤣
Yeah whatever I'm skinny too, but come on guys jayus is FIT
Well atleast I now know why I can't dance but as a skinny person this is all real
That's my Lil bro
Im like the only skinny person in my family of 8 bruh how unlucky is that?!?!?
We need more before YouTube pics!
Dancing is not a skinny problem
I relate to outing hole in my belt, but not being skinny tho
Im too fat :(
Its these freakin Bones we can touch through our skin like wtf
I dont think not being able to dance really only a skinny persons problem I can't dance and I am not skinny at all lol
Lmao my skinny friend we told em that we gonna make em eat and it worked too well he went from 120 to 154 in a year then he joined the national guard now he weighs 130 sum in a healthy way he's fit now and will be coming home tomorrow today he graduated from the training he needed to do
I can relate to this being the skinniest out of all my friends and family.
OMFG ITS SO TRUE!!!
As someone who's been skinny their whole life, I can confirm these are ALL true.
Wtf
I'm skinny to and your definitely right 😂
I used to always basically have to wrap my belt around my waist almost two times if I had one, either that or a shoe string cause I wouldn't have one.  Funny part was I ate way more than anyone I knew and I just did not grow.
I agree with you, but you are still beautiful
As a fat person, the stuff I hear is way worse
You dance good
I love you girl lol
me being a skinny person, these are all so true except I can dance 😂
These are all problems in skinny person I'm a skeleton. Seriously watch one of me in person vids.
I’m skinny and I relate but I can dance
Facts
Literally all of these times 10
I dont deal with the cold because I burn like a forest fire I'm comfortable below zero  And I weigh 90 pounds
When jeans start to fall down, i know i lost weight 😂
I can confirm all of this
as a skinny ass person, i can confirm this is true
This was me before my metabolism stopped. I used to be called a tweaker because of how malnourished I was growing up.
Sooo true i get cold fast with level 2 fan
You got no Feet’s 😂
Your ankle better Jayus?
I HATE IT SO MUCH WHEN PEOPLE TELL ME IM SKINNY!! I TRY TO GAIN MORE WEIGHT BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN EAT!! People please stop asking me
I am skinny too but I’m vegetarian so it a lot harder to.. u know
Yeah this is my life summarized
I relateeee
i can confirm          can’t dance either
Not skinny or I don't think I am, but need to new holes in my belts
As a person who takes of a skinny persona and is friends of a skinny person and has hugged a skinny person and hugged a tiny and skinny person All of this is true
Confirmed, I finally reached a "healthy weight" at 50 😳 (so they say) and the rest of me AIN'T healthy enough to flaunt it😂😂😂 You're So skinny that,,, You have to run around in the shower to get wet! If you stand sideways and stick out your tongue, you look like a zipper You have to put safety nets over the drains. During a hurricaine, you could hide behind a picket fence. The list goes on and on🤣🤣🤣👍
For Halloween I might as well go as a skeleton- a quote from a skinny person
Never related to anything more.
Cant be skinny cant be fat pick a area society!
I only started to get a bit of fat since 2019. Its such a difference.. It still hurts to sit down though, and lay down, and put the elbows on the table, etc.  Cant breathe when you’re laying down lmao
The struggle is real
Most of these are true, especially the pants one same goes for skirts for me 🤣
Wdym u can’t dance that the best dancing I’ve ever seen 🤣
this is too relatable
BRUHHHHH THIS IS ME ON A DAILY BASIS
I'm not skinny but I can't dance
I just love you?
People call me “stick” 😂
YES THESE👏ARE👏THE👏PROBLEMS👏I👏HAVE👏 I've had these problems for most of my life. Except when I was a baby. BUT AFTER THAT I WAS SKINNY AF
Really just go and eat
You need Jesus Christ how dare you speak His name in vain? REPENT please before it’s to late!!
Lol Same Dogo
This is pretty accurate 😂😂 but as a skinny chicken legs i agree this is our problems
Same as 🤣🤣
You are only 2 poundsheavier than me and I'm only 11
Skinny is okay, but you need to have fat to insulate and help you during stressful situations, skinny people die more often in survival situations. I feel bad, because if you don't have a healthy weight you'll definitely die easier.
No one is not gonna be bullied for what they look or what they wieght. To fat,to skinny no one is perfect but what matters is your perfect in your own ways
I know how you feel, I used to be really skinny
Im constantly cold and hungry my metabolism is very high,3x higher than normal person
The clothes one happens to me all the time cause I lost like 20 pounds recently
Ha I’m chubby never experienced any of this but wouldn’t mind being skinny
ayo your leg is finally done working  gud
I know this down side as well.
Same.  Been skinny all my life as well, still the same now I'm 34 literally don't care cause I know who gives A FUCK not me
I can agree with this because when I was young I was skinny asf. But like in the summer of 2019, for some reason I got into a eating habit and I could not stop eating. I was always hungry. By the end of summer when school started back I had gained about 3 whole pounds in just that summer
Gurl i gain 50 pounds BY JUST LOOKING AT A PIZZIA
Very much especially the trousers and belt one, I have recently got a uniform for this organisation called the ACF and I of course am in the army cadet. So I get my uniform and I sort everything. My trousers giant at fuck and my belt is too fucking big. Now most of my uniform is second hand but bloody hell, I had a struggle sorting my belt. Never mind my 3 sized too large jacket because they didn't have my size. (The jacket is second hand). Bloody hell, Idk what I am going to do, I have a camp next week and the Rememberance parade in 2 weeks.
I'm on blood thinners due to health issues so I get very cold easily, and finding men's pants to fit me is a major hassle (29 inch waist) 😞
These are the most true things and relatable stuff I have ever seen in my life
All accurate
being skinny ended up being pretty good for me when I joined cross country
I cAnT dAnCe Does the best dance ive ever seen
Same :'(
0:43 how introverts dance when they're alone
This is sooo first world
I can’t control how skinny I am I’ve got fast metabolism I eat like shit and no matter how much I eat I look like a fucking twig
Im a fat ass and I still can't dance
I knew I would like your personality 🔥
So true
Yup fellow skinny person right here and i can totally agree
As a former skinny person i agree...
You are just like me
I adore you! You are really cool but perfect the way you are. And thank you for your random bites of info ❤
Recently I've been upgrading from twig to stick
As skinny person, can confirm
I didn't know calling a kid really really skinny was bad... Not that I've never said it, but my Mexican grandparents and some of my aunts and uncles would say "Oh my god you're all skin and bones, you really need to eat or you'll be a skeleton when you grow up!" Or "You'll fly away with the wind if you aren't careful!" Also some of the kids at my school would call me skin and bones. Didn't understand why my friends were mad when people said that. :/
Them: Do you even eat, go put some meat on  your bones Me: *eats more than most people I know* Me: *zero difference*
worst part is the unfitting clothes. Like honestly? I'm 6'1 and 150 lbs and finding proper clothes is difficult. Pants are always too wide even when you go with slim fit models...
Just eat
I’m fat and I can’t dance either so
I feel this #skinypeopleproblems
"Can't dance", proceeds to dance and it was AMAZING! Also, boo-fing-hoo, try being fat! Don't get promoted, people think your dumb, can't date attractive people, etc etc etc
I'm skinny af
I’m not skinny but I’m not exactly thick( I wish I was)  either so I get comments for both sides like”you need to loose wait” or “ omg you look like a twing go eat more”.
I still remember when we had to get jabs for something in high school and while one of the nurses did mine, she thought it would be a great idea to say "Oh wow, your arms are really thin, hopefully I don't HIT THE BONE." I am not and was not scares of needles or jabs or anything but that scared the hell out of me 😂😂
I am fat and still can't dance
I am also very skinny and I do get very cold very very quickly quicker than other people. These all happen to me apart from the dancing one
As a skinny person with a decent ass can’t relate dude
I totally feel you- I like, actually get somewhat picked on for being short
But.. but... That's how I dance 🤣🤣
That’s a solid dance to me
How is your ankle feeling ?
You built like a praying mantis
I was really skinny about a year ago and about my whole life. But now I finally don't see every bone in my ribcage, so I would say that's an improvement!  So every one that is struggling with being under weight I believe in you! And to every beautiful chubby person out there, you shouldn't feel like changing yourself because of beauty standards, you are beautiful. But seriously if you experience health problems (both skinny and chubby) take care of yourself, okay?!
People always be asking us skinny people HWO YU EATT SO MCH AND NO FAT OR WIEFHTG?!
The not being able to dance is not just a skinny person problem lmao
Can't dance is a fat thing to and I'm good waight for my hight I can't dance worthbshi
I'm not a skinny person I'm mostly the opposite but people will literally bully you for no f****** reason and they'll be like haha you're so fat because like when I was younger I went to another school like starting in a new school and it was traumatizing really because my teachers actually send me to this doctor which was supposedly to get me on a diet and I thought that was offensive because I was  like 10 p over the recommended and I'm still 10 lb over the recommend so like it was I'm still traumatizing from school so like and most of the time I wouldn't go to school so yeah oh and another thing I my hearing is really bad so like people could talk bad about me and I wouldn't know I don't know how many things they have talked about me but all I know is that in third grade I almost carried one of my teachers so like being fat isn't bad because at the same time you can be a bit strong and when I mean a bit I mean a lot
skinny ppl gang we all know we dance like sims
This happens to me a LOT. My friends (that are guys) always ask me why I pull up my pants- THEY DONT KNOW THE STRUGGLE
It probably doesn’t help that you’re so tall. Especially the last one
OMFG IKR
I don’t agree with 6 cus im skinyyyyyy and I’ve been a dancer for 8 yrs
R U APART OF TRAM SEAS 🤔🤔🤔
So cool that I’m fat like a fcking hippo
As a skinny person this is true
Dancing seems like a you problem
This is true asf
My mommy ALWAYS said that I was thin when I was little
I look skinny but the scale says other wise
I'm a skinny person but I don't really get that cold easily
As a fat person: idk what to say about this.
WHAT i want these problems
I get bruises on my hip bones if I lay on my stomach for too long 😣
As a very skinny person I agree and feel for ya
My best friend is really skinny. He’s always so cold lmao. I constantly have to give him my jacket but its fine cause I’m overweight and pretty warm most of the time.
Yeah I’m the same my friends literally called me a white African
💯 Relatable
You are the best dancer I’ve ever seen
Like I always have to seat with a pillow when I am sitting on the floor
Been skinny my whole life up until covid. Plus being 2,08m is not a very good combination. Now finally having a healthy is very great. Just my dadbod is still always unusual to see for me.
The thing about cold isnt really true
Me too
I love being skinny. I've been told get meat on your bones hard to do I can't eat alot but, I can eat a good portion.
Damn now I kinda don't wanna be skinny
Fucking facts
I like your dance moves 🕺 💃
I wish I was skinny lol
I’m the 1,000 comment
Mow
Seriously been skinny hole life and umm can’t get cold unless it’s THAT bad
I’m so proud to be skinny  now. I dance perfectly.
FINALLY SOMEONE TALKS ABOUT THIS
I'm so skinny, I can eat two pavlovas and still be skinny
As someone who has never been thin. I can't relate to this. But I gotta say. People's comments are worse for fat people
The aaa bones not only hurt yourself, IT HURTS OTHERS WHEN YOU SIT ON THEM
As a 13 yo girl currently at 120lb always wishing I were really skinny instead of really fat I realize how it might be better to be heaver than skinny
I’m fat and disappointed why was I born
Sadly no
I still think its better than being fat
tbh I am kinda fat and looks like you can dance not trying to be mean btw love your vids keep up the good work
About clothing I agree, same problems but dancing, girl you've got quite some moves even if they goofy
True
I can confirm. I also can’t dance
Skinny kid here, this shit is soo great to hear because I thought I was the only one
Cute. When I was skinny I would get not hungry but really irritable and anxious. I've been eating ice cream every day for half a year and now I have something to grab on to on my belly and my mood feels more stable and my body has inflammation from all the shitty ice cream.
Yeah I eat like 500 pounds of food a day and I still have an 18.6 bmi
you're a great dancer hush
Fasho
I'm the opposite My mum body shames me I never fit into any clothes Apparently I have super huge feet that called flat feet so I feel really insecure now My sister is a literal goddess : She fits into anything cause shes so skinny She has amazing hair  And she is always fitting into any shoes she gets Why is life just so unfair sometimes 🥺
My best friend is soooooo skiny to the point when he was 11 we was 60 70 pounds but when i was 10 at the time i was 100 pounds 😂😂
I’m skinny and I’ve dealt with all of this. And I’m 12. Now I’m dreading adulthood even more.
Me wanting to be skinny  Me: not anymore
I can also confirm this 😅😓 very annoying 😒 but true but at least😏....... I can dance Tho😎
I get this!! I'm glad that this is there to tell people about it!!
As a skinny person, yes
As a fattass I can't relate:(
This is so true. Ive always been skinny and can't get into a healthy weight. All of these are true for me but when I was a kid people would always say things like oh careful theres a drain i don't want you to fall down it! And oh its windy you better not go outside youll blow away. At school there was someone who nicknamed me stick and on my year 6 lever t-shirt someone wrote im anorexic on my back. The comments still happen. Sitting on the hall floor in school at assembly's hurt so bad!
As a person who weighs 74 kilos and can’t get the belt to fit tight I agree.
Ya people tell us to eat all the time
I'm a skinny person, and these are all so fing true.
I dont care, but your cute
You cute tho👍
Yes 😂
As a skinny person and I heard the eating comment alot
i think the last one might be a little false
As skinny person #2728 in the comments, can confirm
Can confirm
You have turned into an absolute cashgrab. Only fans when?
I cant dance either T^T (im chubby and im allways warm and i eat alot)
This is so fucking true, just the society problem gets way too annoying if you love in a country like india
I agree with most of these
I know your skinny, but it won't make roblox come back
I am skinny af and I can relate to many of these
It's ok I can't dance to
You're not the only one who can't dance... and I'm not a skinny person
Cmon.  U can dance
This is soo true! I also used to not be able to get up if I was sitting on the floor because my shoulder blades would touch the floor and it would hurt 😒.
6'2, 70kg still cold all the time >:( mean
I always poke new holes in my belt XD
As a skinny person I can relate, btw I love your dancing:3
As a skinny girl, I agree 💗
I Can confirm as a 13 year old 37 kg
Can confirm
FAXXXX
As a skinny  person I can say that this is true
I'm friends with this guy 2 years younger than me and I'm so small and skinny compared to him. He can lightly pat me on the back and it will cause me to go forward
Being cold and bruises on my knees from being too skinny. I’ve been told to eat more even if I was full!
This is soo true. Dkinny people have these problems and bigger people have other problems but the thing that never changes is that society never seems to treat you right. Im a little on the big side and society never treated me right and thats the same with skinny people seem to forgett people like us still have feelings and talents but never get a chance to show it. Society just treats us badly. Remember just because society says oh you look like this or that doesnt mean you cant look good. Skinny people can look beutifula and like onlyjayes gaid some wieght to. And to all my fellow people pn the bigger side remeber. You can always loose wieght and look beutiful!! Life is about getting where you want to be. Not what someone else wants you to be. Have fun. Work hard and i hope this made some peoples fay a little better cause personaly i would need to hear this everyday before school for a little self asteem boost lol
Apparently I am skinny
At least you’re vibing to the music😂
My brother eats more than me and he's way skinnier than me
Ima like this because of the dance
You can't dance because you have no since of rhythm not because your skinny
As a fat ass person, can't relate
But there are issues as well with fat people like me!
God I’ve never related to something so much
Can't dance Michael Jackson 🤡
LMAO... As a father person who was once very skinny... Sorry but many of ur complaints only get worse when ur fat. Then comes the inconveniences, discomforts, health issues, and fat jokes to add to ur few  minor issues. But being fat the butt hurts more. Still cold if not worse, maybe that's due to age not weight?
So skinny my bones do extra damage in a fight 😭
As a person who was very skinny, but with a very Tasty and Juice "Buns", i must say:  I understand
I'm 13 and I'm jayus height and weight based on the scale and this is all facts
Skin shamed my entire life fr i thought shit was normal damn. Welp skinny and tall ain't got shit my ass hurts just from sitting in class and when I stand up it feels like i just passed nirvana cause damn that sh uncomfortable
As other generic skinny person I agree
Yee
All are fat people problems too lol. Chairs can pinch, get stuck, and we have more cushion to get sore. You fat and lay down, good luck getting up. It sucks. I havent been able to a push up since first grade. When we lay down, our fat spreads and flattens out. It doesnt stay close to our bones, so they get exposed. Chances are, there is no muscle to protect. Then weight can cause bones to pop out, because they arent meant to carry so much.  Insulation is just the opposite. 90 degrees and up is the same as saying hell. For clothes, either length/width dosent work. If not then how low/high the straddle is. I would rather add holes to belts than need to buy a new one. Society says we will die in our 50s. Cut back and eat healthier, workout, even though many do. Too heavy to get on this ride etc. As for dance moves, we got the jiggle, or chunkle shuffle. Fat and skinny are 2 sides of the same coin, it sucks either way.
Same
Shit all is true
Legend
As a skinny person this is 100% accurate. Being shiny is one of my insecurities plus stuff hurts me 10x was worse
As a skinny person this is true and i confirm
As a skinny boi myself, I can relate to 100% of these. I get cold in 60°f. weather.
I feel like the last one was just in general, that being said I’m fine being a happy medium but a healthy medium for body size.
Don't worry you've nailed the dance thing lmaoo
I left a dislike for one reason.  OnlyJayUS IS NOT TOO SKINNY.  Are you happy doing you do? Are you happy the way you look?  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY  I am a 6' 9" black guy, and I personally think your dance moves are pretty nice.
I’m underweight
I can’t dance either
As someone who weighs 40 kilos and has done for the past 6 years whilst going through puberty at the same time, I can confirm that being very skinny is not fun, no, you do not want to be as skinny as me, you do not want to be a twig that gets bruises from lying down
I am a little on the heavy side and I have these issues too
those dance moves were God Tier
Comferation.
im a skinny person, and this is all true. especially the belt one 🥲
Skinny people can dance. That has nothing to do with body size. lol
I can remember being so underweight one time that I could put my hands under and behind my rib cage
Bro, people called me ‘underweight’ ‘stick’ ‘Do you eat?’ ‘Are you ok?’
EXACTLY
You should gain some weight and workout so the fat weight gets turned to muscle weight
I am skinny. My body won’t let me put on weight. I can eat as much as I want and I’m the same.    AHHHHHHHH-
Oh fucking hell listen to this everyone stop calling me fucking skinny like a twig it really puts me down. 😔 ppl think it's banter but it's much more than that
I think the dancing is just you…
Your dancing is pretty okay though 😌
Omgg dude I went from fat people problem to skinny people probelms
Society judges any body type. People think you’ve got an eating disorder when you’re skinny (my friends said they’ve had that said to them) and people think you’re unhealthy and ugly when you’re overweight (been told that ever since I were a child.)
Lolz I can relate hahaha
I can confirm
I honestly prefer the terms underweight and overweight because when people use terms like fat and skinny people end up weight shaming the person
I was severely malnourished as a kid and i have a bone deformity that made my ribs curve however they wanted, so people could literally see every rib i had.
Yeah I'm very skinny and have a 6 to 8 pack but one I flex it's like muscles gets teleported to my arms and I'm 12
My friends mum said she can't be my friend coz she would "catch" anorexia...
I RELATE TO EVERYSINGLE ONE ! lol
Yes
Same
I’m skinny, but I don’t sweat very easy because my genetics, so I’m always warm
I can agree with this
As a more dense person, I can confirm all of those the exact opposite lol. On point jayus
You dance better than me
Not only sitting but STANDING OH MY GOD I HAVE TO STAND ALL THE WAY THROUGH CHORUS AND MY HEELS HURT BAD AF
Can confirm except for the being cold thing for me it’s heat
Confirmed ✅
Sans: I’m gonna have a bad time…
As a skinny person can confirm
The last one is why i chose to be a DJ So i dont need to dance
I’ve been there
Why you make your voice deeper every video?
All i can say is facts And I still feel hurt by comments
I am 42 kg at the age of 13 and i am 1,65 so i can relate with everything you said.
Idk what you're talking about, those dance moves were top tier. 😋
"I can't dance" sweetie.. I love your channel but you can't blame that on being skinny😅
Seriously! There was a time when could eat like five helpings of food, and put on any weight. It all went into height. XD My piano teacher used to tell me to stop fidgeting, but I couldn't because I no ass and it hurt to sit on the piano bench. XD
Looks like dancing to me.
Plus you can't resist wind very well
I have to cut my belts in half for them to fit
She do be brake it down
I have never been more proud to be fat 👌😁👍
You should do a fat people problems cause fat people don’t only have benefits of being fat.
As a skinny person I can 2nd these statements
I legit have the same problems
I am so skinny and yet I eat way to much
I hate it when people tell me to eat more 😒
You are fricken funny girl
I suffer from this too... I confirm this video has real facts
These are all absolutely true
Finally. Someone realizes how COLD I get. FINALLY!
I am a skinny person and I eat so much fricking food and I am still a skinny rat
Lol I tried becoming fatter so people would stop telling me I'm skinny and now I look 4 months pregnant-
is that why i’m always cold? now me and my 3 weighted blankets know the answer
I me i eat a LOT im at puperty and pretty tall like 6ft smthing and 50kg
Omg same, but I like the cold so I’m not to bothered to get cold easily, but yeah i’m called a stick a lot, and I call myself that to but it does hurt…
This is soooooooo relatable except the cold in fact I think I'm mainly skin
Skinny person here! Can confirm all of these except for the dancing one, but that’s probably just because two years ago I asked a really cute girl how to dance and she proceeded to show me. If that wasn’t a gay panic moment I don’t know what is.
As a skinny child it true!!!!
Perfect 😊
I’m skin and bones my friends say it’s weird that when I itch my sides that you can see my ribs ;w;
6'1" 130lbs can confirm every point in this is true af
ANGEL ARMY IS TAKING OVER YOUTUBE  EVERY SUB I GET I WILL COMMENTS THIS ON A RANDOM VIDEO 10 TIMES COMMENTS 743

GO MAKE ME A SANDWICH
As a skinny child, o agree i sit on my legs so my legs hurt instead of my butt
Help, this is so true, especially the 3rd and 4th
As a fat person I will never know this problem personally, just through the experiences of others
You were a hooper hooper huh
Relatable. Except my parents never thought I was skinny and compared me to other kids. So, being 10 years old and underweight, I tried to lose more weight to become like them ⚠don't do this ⚠
Can comfirm
well, can't say I relate, I'm pretty chubby
Oh my lord Jayus. Thank you for outlining these things for us, especially the belt problems.
Dodmfkfkkf IVE BEEN SO SKINNY MY WHOLE LIFE AND THE COLD ONE IS SO TRUEE BUT ALL OF THEM ARE TRUE
This is extremely accurate. I struggle the most with the cold situation and the societal comments.
I relate to this so much I-😭😭
You can dance perfectly fine…. Just don’t let anyone else watch
Im skinny too!!! I just got a healthy weight this week do to stress
Those are 10/10 perfect dance combos
So relatable
i don’t know what you’re on about i’ve never seen someone dance this well in my life
And i still want to be skinny
Tried to lay down like you demonstrated. My ribs felt uncomfortable so I tried again. Tried to get up the second time and bent my knees the wrong way because my knee caps are the first body part to experience the hard floor.
I have all the same problems, like I am cold all the time, and most of my pants don't fit me
This is so true
Lol
Omg this happens to me cause I’m in middle school and really skinny, and one time someone said “Eat a burger” and I was like “your just mad that I can eat so much and still look skinny”
As a skinny person I can also agree but people always say the wind will blow me away. A doctor threatened to call social services on my mom saying she doesn't feed me
That dance. Legend
#teamseas
Confirmed.
Me being sad being fat
As a bigger person you skinny people also get boyfriends/girlfriends more than us bigger people cause now all anything almost anyone cares about is appearence.
I wish I could dance like that
As a fat ass cant relate
I don't think obese people are considered 'good dancers'...
I feel proud that I weighed more than you when I was 9
It’s also horrible when people compare themselves to you and make you feel like your making them think their overweight I honestly makes me mad how others treat us almost in the same format as it is for a bigger person
As an underweight person, i can easily confirm this
I have the hardest time finding pants that fit me.  The waist is too big or the legs are really big so it kinda sucks sometimes being skinny
Are you a girl or boy
Speaking of problem the seas are in trouble #teamseas
As a fat person, I can confirm the exact opposite of these. ( except for the dancing, can’t do that, but that might just be a me problem )
Eat estrogen woman hormone
I thought I was the only one
EXACTLY
Do you mean skinny or scronny these are things scronny people experience
#teamseas
I used to be insanely skinny and now I’m 195 pounds 😐
Bruh I’m still skinnier than her, HOW HAVE I NEVER SEEN SOMEONE THINNER THAN MYSELF.
Amen
As a big man myself, I wish to have most of this power
Whaddya mean you can't dance, you're a regular Ginger Rogers
Miss i don’t care in still jealous of you skinny people 😭
I have auto immune problems and it makes me skinny and it’s annoying when people say they wish they had my problems loll
This was a great birthday present
thoes dance vibez were LITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
When she said that she can’t dance I literally said “what do you mean?” As she got down and astonished everyone here
Ok you can't dance but you can twerk
She can't dance bc she has nothing to throw around 😂
Did that scale say 664lbs?! lol jk you look great
O
Last one don’t apply to me that’s jus you everything else true tho
Urgh the sitting one annoys me so much 😭
“Your belt doesn’t fit” soooo relatable!
Omg sameeeeee
Happens to me lol
Idk if I'm skinny but like yeah I feel u
Omg you described my life its worse when your parents say it too
I can't dance Kpop : excuse me😏
i subbed for relation to not be able to dance cause im skinny
Can relate, it sucks af
I dont think not being able to dance has very much connection with being skinny...
As someone underweight I can confirm  My dad's favorite thing to call me is "skinny bacon" No matter how much I ask to stop
people's comments were definitely the worst. I've tried explaining that yes, I eat a lot. No, I don't skip meals.  also when people comment "oh your so skinnyyy" they might think it's a compliment but it's honestly just awkward. Please stop.
I can confirm   I am skinny
amen
Don't worry I can't dance either
Yes yes and yes. I’ve had all this issues my whole life. I’m a 20 year old male and hates still looks slightly thicker than me lol. I have not been taking very good care of myself for sure. It’s strange. Normally people get fat when they are stressed. At least I would think. Instead I get super skinny and weak
No, you just can’t dance
The amount of times I bring up skinny people problems and someone gets mad at me saying I'm bragging about thing skinny and at least I'm not called fat
Okay fat problems when
The last one is just you, and maybe some other skinny people who can’t dance. I know some skinny people with SERIOUS dance skills.
All true i always need a blanket
Finally someone speaks up for the boney people. It's not ok to body shame fat people but say whatever to those that can't gain. The worst is when they tell you to eat more, you list average daily intake only to get "I hate you" as a reply.
My friend in like year 3/grade 3 told me imma die In a month if I don't eat more... He was wrong
Is he a Boy or girl???
I have all these problems but I’m fat
Jayus got the moves
Onlyjayus, you can dance! You just made my day! And this video explains a lot lol
Another issue, most of us have really high metabolisim as the cause, so just eating won't make much a difference.
Me being a little bit  chunky: maybe my fat isn’t completely useless… interesting
Yep, here are names ive been called:toothpick, noodle, one of those noodle things that you blow air in to, twiggy,paper
Yep
I’ll say for all the psychopaths we all can’t dance
I'm skinny too I have the same things happen to me
You say you can't dance but...  That look like every other white person dancing
Funny how fatshaming is a bad thing but because we’re skinny it’s ok to make fun of us when it’s not even the fact we don’t eat it’s just hard to gain weight
Can we swap metabolisms please
Thank hod finnaly a mother skinny
This is true I just don’t get made fun of because im also super short so that’s what people usually make fun of me for
I can’t relate to any of these because I’ve been severely overweight my entire life
All of them are true. Which is the reason why I’m staying in my personal, secret laboratory made out of very unprotective walls to let people know what I’m doing as I’m not actually doing it. A.K.A my room.
Yes this is very true
"These are problems i will never have" - introvert
So true the last one 😂😂😂😂
"I can't dance" * starts dancing like an expert *
YESSS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING SOME AWARENESS TO THESE PROBLEMS!!!
😕😭
Can you do a video on gaining weight
And I want to stay that way
I am skinny
Just let it out girl
THANKYOUI I REELATE
Yeah being tall and young and verry skinny and being under weight is not fun
Confirmed. People always buy me lunch because they think I'm anerexic (I don't know how to spell it) and it hurts but I mean I get free food so that's something
I'm skinny everywhere but my stomach
As a fat person, I can't confirm.
My friends are always commenting on how veiny my skinny arms are. Like over half of the circumference of the large veins stick out. And they’re always telling me to drink more water but they won’t accept that I’m just super skinny and super veiny.
ONG UR DANCING IS SO GOOD WDYM?
"Go eat a burger" Lmao people said that to me all the time. I play so much soccer and do so much karate that no matter what I eat/do I'm always skinny.
Try being skinny and then getting really fat and then trying to lose the weight
I used to have high metabolism so I was basically losing muscles for a while till I got outa highschool so I could eat all I wanted😂
Jayus, I don't think bad dancing is your width's fault
As a skinny person I have people bully me for being skinny and people telling me to get some meat on my bones and I’m 10 yes old
Yes
That last one terrified me
Smooth moves
This would be why my skinny ass always has a sweatshirt on
The worst part is the snapping bones is true
i’m a really skinny person but idk why i eat like everything i can
Not dancing is a u problem as a skinny person 🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺I can dance
Am I the only one who thought that the dance moves were kinda good
As an overweight person, it feels weird to be jealous of an equal problem
*Being skinny is as bad as being fat…*
Can confirm,I eat a lot but skinNy✨✨✨
Worst part is my weight is almost 66 even tho I make hole in my belt to fit in
How dare you call me out … _with every part_  I eat like a dump truck, it’s not my fault I have *the fastest metabolism in the west*
As a skinny person I am have lived like that for my whole life and I am only a teenager so this is 100% accurate 😂
Relatable
If anyone disrespects you for being skinny, just reply: at least i have manners.
I’ve been everything in this life, I’ve been fat as hell and skinny as hell too, i think the next step for me is become an animal
I can relate to this
The most relatable video on the internet for me
That last one 👌🤣💃💗
I can 100 percent relate, lol
Rather be skinny than over weight
i could never be super skinny like that its just weird, im down to 218 and i feel weak and i have to lose like 20 more lbs imagine 🥸
This is so true 💀
I can relate, I WISH eating a burger fixed it (because yes I do eat lol)
Going to bed I was tired seeing Jayus dancing...literally made my day, can sleep peacefully now ; )
i am skinny as fuck and i can agree
No, you can dance, you just can’t dance with out making it weird.
Bruh I am exactly the same 🤣
Sounds more like a "You" problem.
I'm really fucking skinny so I can relate
Your perfect the way you are. (Im skinny and i eat just as much junk food as the next person)
As a person who's been skinny for the entire 17 years of their life (currently about 48kg even though I'm like 5'10"), I can defo confirm all of this (maybe not the dance part- that's more of a social anxiety issue for me). Being told "you're just skin and bones" or "you need to eat more" from like the age of 5 coupled with the fact that I'm too skinny for any clothes made for people over 15 years while also being too tall for all children's clothes (the belt one hit a bit close to home tbh) hurts your self esteem so much. Worst part is I'm way too self conscious to go to the gym or anything to help fix it as well. :(
ahhhhh is for this that i cannot dance, it’s nothing wrong with me 👀 i’m just skinny 🤔
My mom is a literal SKELETON she’s always cold and says her back hurts all the time.
Me too
As a male which weights 49kg at age 16 this is a MOOD
I get the first ones but the dancing is just you sorry
I think you can dance very well. 🤩
I hate it when u just sit down and have to shift every 5 minutes bc it hurts
Same
I have most of these problems, didn’t think I was that skinny
I'm fat and I can't dance either. I can't even get up actually
Yea uh i confirm as skinny person cuz i got body shamed for it
I am 14, 142 pounds and I have the skinny @ss hurts after sitting for to long problem what is a good weight
I use to be obese, went from 280, to 170. I’m pretty tall too, so I think I look skinny. I’ve noticed, sitting is less comfortable, and I get cold a lot faster.
Did that scale say 659 ????????
As a skinny legend i can confirm 😂 *people's comments are hurtful sometimes*
Last one seem kinda like a you problem
I indeed cannot dance
I ony thaut that skinny peeps dident have problems wif ther  bodies
I'm skinny, can confirm. It's all pain.
As a skinny person i can confirm besides the cold thing.I am king of the cold and can go outside in shorts and a t shirt at 10°C
Tbh she dances better then me
Not only that, but no matter how much you eat, you don’t get fatter. I know this as I am skinny as well.
Well you can dance it’s just not up to standard
Dance good though better than me
Love your videos
The cold one is good cause my fam is like well fat and I am skinny and I get cold QUICK andy dad doesn't understand why I'm cold
another problem is the FAST METABOLISM i can eat a entire pizza and still be skinny
Bruh this is so relatable
I’d much rather be skinny than fat, but I do see the downsides
“Go eat a burger” dude I’ve already had THREE!!!!  That’s me.
Michael jackson was a skinny guy since entire life and he can dance
That dancing thing is literally everyone
I’m so skinny, and my belly is chubby, and I’m really short, and all of these I can agree with
Her moves do be fire though
As a skinny I can't dance to😭😭
Yup I can confirm  this
I love your Dancing
BROOOOOOOOO!!  CAN CONFIRM WITH EVERYTHING!!! LOL
My sis was so skinny in high school the teachers told my parents that they thought she had anorexia. She didn't.
I am skinny but VERY heavy.
I’m skinny af, yet I somehow feel like it’s hot af here in the nordic where I’m raised & live.
All are true,I would say
whenever i sit down for too long it hurts so much until my ass just goes completely numb 😐👍
Why does the last dance look like something someone would do in Charlie brown
As a fat person…cannot relate, but I feel for you.
Can relate, also you can dance better then me lol. The comments from my parents such as “eat more” even when i wasn’t hungry. Anyway touch grass and drink alot of water ^^
OMG SAME
I relate to all of this as a skinny person
Its okay .its normal. Its not something out of the ordinary. 😎
To be fair, the "can't dance" part may just be a terminal case of "no style" and "complete lack of funk" !
You just described my life, my entire fkng life lol
bro i have had to poke so many belt holes so many times
I'm skinny I dont have that last problem or maybe I do I just dont relise
Haha I have similar problems since I lost some weight a few months ago I was 223 now I'm 210ish and nothing fits I have poked 4 new holes in my belts and my pants still don't fit
fuck i feel this in my soul especialy the pants and being cold thing
Fax
All of them but the food
I used to be super skinny, then my mom left with us for a year and ate spaghetti every day. I hate spaghetti
The holes in the belt is too accurate 😭😭
as a skinny person yes it is true and I can't dance either
Very true too true
As meee
Im skinny for someone who eats every good snack I find
Both of my brothers are skinny but I've always been big not fat or tall just big, which is funny cause I'm a giant softy but I could probably lay you out with one swing 😂
I'm not exactly skinny (but I was when I was younger) but I've always been crazy tall (6'7') so lots of similar things...
i love the dancing. honey ur gorgious skinny or not =)  u look like a super model. dont let the  comments get to you. love ur videos btw.
What the heck do u mean u can’t dance like u got them moves
You also look like beef jerky with ribs when having a tan. I had/have Hyperthyroidism. And my i was growing to fast for my body. With 16 I was almost 6feet with ~50kg. I was always an optimistic guy so i never had emotional problems with my body or smt but i felt the lack of stamina and the overall inertia (Hope thats the right word)  Geting no muskel mass or fat in general no matter what exercise i did  or what food i ate was the worst part in puberty but i could always laugh at myself. Now I am almost 6'3feet and proud of my 82kg. My family and and get always shocked when we look at old holiday pictures. We knew I was skinny but we never noticed how thin and unhealth I really looked. The contrast is real.
This is literally my life
Why is this so accurate😥  Btw i love all youre videos
My but bones hurt after five minutes even with like a pillow under :(
You know im skinny and things that people say to me and how my clothed never fit me properly is really hard but i just live with it and accept my self as who ill always prob be.
5 is sooooo trueeeeee
I'm quite small and weirdly built for a guy, and I can soo relate to this  I'm 177cm tall (like, 5'9 and a matchbox)  40in chest a VERY skinny waist (27in)  I have literally NEVER found a belt that fits without me having to add extra holes, and people always poke fun at me for complaining about it. The most common offender is the "I wish I was that skinny, stop moaning". Like, I get it, but still, being a guy at this height and waist size is annoying. My chest is like the only normal thing about me
hol up did that scale day 66 pounds or 66 kilograms?
I’m like 45 kg but I’m fat af
I’m tall and skinny at 14. My pants never fit because I have a 27 inch waist but my inseam is 34 inches and those kind of pants don’t exist. But I am 130 pounds so my organs must be really heavy. And how tf is 66 pounds a healthy weight
1 - I have a personal space on the couch that I like to rest my back on.  2 - Laying down like that in general for me feels like I’m gonna die. 🙁 3 - I just now realized this. 😳 4 - My dad literally gave me that advice yesterday! :) 5 - I don’t have anything to say about this but it sure as hell sucks to hear in general. Hope you have a blessed evening. 6 - We all lookin like cartoon characters. LMAO.
I’m also really skinny, but I don’t get cold easily. My clothes and belts also never fit which is the worst, and the sitting you kinda get used to/find ways around, unless you have to do workouts on the floor and then some become impossible even with a yoga mat...
As a skinny person, I relate to all of these
Yep, my friends often call me a bean pole. For good reason. I am very skinny.
Very true
THIS SEE THIS THATS ME
I've always kinda been in the middle. I'm skinny enough to not be considered fat, but too fat to be considered skinny.
I confirm all if this especially the cold thing
bro as a skinny person my dad tells me everyday to “get some meat in my bones” lmao
What in the world
Comment from high school teacher: do you have an eating disorder or something?   Um no I'm just naturally this way...jerk.
Me: *laughs in fat*
All of this is true
Hey at least she can dance better than me. Also, these are all 100% true.
As someone whom has been both skinny and chunky. There is issues with all weights. And everyone will always judge you at any size 🙄
Im short and skinny so i get 2 times as hard lol
Skinny gang wear you at
I got them all but I’ve learned to live with it
i am the opposite of this #getrekt
I am a twig with limbs. I can confirm.
Me who is just to fat…
*Laughs in fat* *Dies from heart attack*
I'm a chubby person, and I have similar problems
I'll disagree about the dancing one. You were busting some sweet moves, there.  I'll agree about the cold one, though. I've lost close to 100 lbs in the last couple of years, and I can confirm that not being fat in the wintertime... SUCKS
I have skinny problems too
People don't know how us skinny people suffer
But in all of these things the number 5 one literally made me insecure about my whole body :'''')
BRO I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY OJE WIT THIS PROBLEM OET THE FUCKING PEOPLE KNOW
I can relate I'm almost 70 pounds underweight
It’s alright to be skinny I love everyone
As a non-skinny person I think not
People made fun of me for being skinny and weak, so I became bigger than them
Yes I am very skinny and I agree
YESSSSSSS
I can relate to all of these ESPICALLY the cold and society one. I get cold super fast and people say "gain some weight". I've been underweight my entire life and when someone says "just gain some weight it's not that hard" I get super annoyed. Right now at 16 I'm 5"10 and 125 pounds. My goal is to be up to 130 but who ever knows when that will happen.
Yes
All are the right but the last one I’m some what good at dancing
Still better than being a fattie
I can relate
Yes
As a 6' man who until 5 years ago weighed 140 at my highest in school when I was weight lifting twice a day every day(max bench was 180). I heard all of the worst comments about needing a sandwhich and breaking under a feather. Slim shaming is a thing and it's not as disgusting as fat shaming hut it is still just as bad.
So being Fat isn't half-bad.
I'm so glad I'm not skinny in real life-
This is extremely relatable
I have that issue i can not gain weight
If anyone makes a comment about your weight if you're "super skinny", just say you have high metabolism. They will prob be confused but its true.
Ayo miniminter? Is that you fam
I think I just had a stroke watch jayus dance😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
as a fellow skinny individual i understand
I've had healthy weight, then diabetes (type 1) kicked in. Lost all my fat and can't get to the healthy weight, even thought I am pretty tryharding it.
So true
The eating thing 🙄, I eat really reaaaally much over the the day my but I'm still skinny af. Really don't know if my stomach has superpowers
I feel you so bad omfg my like since i was 11 years old ive been like 40-53 kilos thats thin and the belt thing omfg
I'm skinnier than you and I have been for the last 45 years and I never get cold, matter of fact I still have my air conditioner on the winter when it snows
oml I relate-
I mean, I'm close to 100lbs overweight and I can't dance either.
The insulation fact is so true like I can’t walk thru the shade on a hot day without catching a chill.
I am tired of the color green
Love the dance moves
As a fat person I can say most of the things are the same for us . But we don't get cold but warm
Yeeeeeassss I am sooo skinny and all of this is so true
As a skinny see my ribs person these are true but for me the cold one isn't which has always confused people but I actually get really hot and can be in the snow in shorts
One skinny person problem I've recently run into is all those "fixing art" stuff where the artists say "look I made the body type realistic!" But they just made the characters chubby/fat. Like skinny people don't exist. It's weird but it gives me a small sense of insecurity, like it's not normal to be skinny (it's not a huge problem, just something I wanted to mention)
Wait BOI do u have Raynolds disease since ur cold easy ?
As a skinny person, I can confirm these are all true
As a chubby person I'd rather lose weight but my brother is still under 110 and he is 20
I can confirm x10000000
So true
the extra hole on the belt is a classic, needed to do it everytime i got a new belt (am skinny af too)
honestly same except I'm always 1000 degrees to hot
please stop standing on your sink
This is so relatable
As a skinny person, I too struggle with these Curse my genes
I'm not skinny or fat but I can sit down on a hard surface too long or I'll hurt my butt and it also can cause temporary pain if I sit wrong. I might just need to extrasize my butt muscles more.
U can dance better than me 😂
This is the most relation I have had to a video I have ever had
To the very cold one as a skinny person, doesn’t really happen to me..unless it snows
i still hate how i look because im way to overweight and all my parents do is call me fat and when i try to get normal my parents laugh at me, ever since i was 4-5 people called and laughed at me, i hate myself and have thought of killing myself at points and still do, this video just makes it more painful to know i’ll be a useless fat pig in the future, its not fun. I basically cry everyday because of how ugly i look
"Hey look, I can make a ring around your wrist with my fingers!"
I cannot dance, my trousers barely fit , it feels like my ass bones are actually touching the chair and I am always wearing hoodies unless its summer. And even in summer I sometimes wear hoodies because I'm ginger and sunburn can eat sh!t.
Unless a jump on the seat my ass doesn’t hurt I can lay on my stomach for eight hours and then get back up and feel completely fine I’m almost never cold and most of my cloths fit fine.   Im also fat as fuck
I was actually skinny growing up so I can conform this thats why I buffed up
As a fat person, i can laught about you
im fat. Im warm all the time. I can sit on a pillow without a pillow. I can lay on a bed without a bed.
Beats the alternative
No no *sigh* Jayus u can’t dance for obvious reasons
Just so you know, I’m skinny and I,be won countless dance competitions
Hi
I can confirm to all of these lol
Yep this is true
Don't judge me now but I tough you were a boy
Me 😔
Unrelated but I have a big fat crush on them 🤝
God jayus my life is the same I'm 15 and still get bullied and being skinny has nothing to do with it I'm also an amazing dancer 😂
As a fat person i can confirm that we are pretty much the opposite but i cant dance XD
Skinny since I can remember here. The worst was in 4th grade when in gym and the teacher couldn't get the BMI pincher thing on my arm to measure me and all the other kids started chanting that I was anorexic. I didn't even know what it meant at the time. But also the eat a burger all the time. I got to the point where I'd say, bitch you buying? Gimme 2.
I’m skinny and this is true
I am skinny af, these are all correct apart from yes. I can dance - it's basically all I spend my time doing
SAME
Yes. All of these are true (except maybe the dancing part…. I’ve always danced lol)
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me, a dumb fat person, (at least that’s what I think) feeling depression bc I’ve always wanted to be like that.
Confirm
As a fat person I must say  Sounds awful, we have it worse
Same tho i gotta shop in the kids section 😂 I recently moved onto the teens, working out 🤬
I feel you and you you also feel me then like
Plz don’t use Gods name in vein plz Jesus is coming back soon
As a tall skinny person pants in your size not a thing they either are long enough but they fall down or there too short and they fit your waist
#relatable
Are skinny people trying to be oppressed now? It also comes with so much privileges lol
I'm sorry but I don't think being skinny has anything to do with dancing.
From a skinny person, I agree with all of those except for the dance one because I do dance
Hey, I'm fat and I can't dance as well, and I people comments when I was growing up we're the worst as well so... Yeah
Number 3 is not a problem for me but everything else is true
Not being able to dance isn’t a skinny thing😂😂😂😂
can confirm that these are all VERY true
I don’t know why the hell your taking about, those dance moves were stellar
I hope you are still giving out about being skinny when you are in your forties . Also you are right, you can't dance 😃. Great videos tho
Boo hoo.
Im a 51 kilo dude at 176 and i relate. Im not even fully grown so i may be 51 at 190 😁 Edit: however i dont get cold much, i think each person is different, also whoever tells me to go eat i tell them i could probably eat twice your body weight and not gain a single kilo.
Yea that sums up everything 😑
Everything you said is the same as me
As a Halloween skeleton I can confirm  Also I can lose weight so quickly but I eat like kirby and gain almost no weight  And I need to sleep with 2 duvets because I get so cold
What about when you slightly bump your hip or elbow on something and it feels like you just got shot
I can totally relate literally im a  senior still in high school and i still Weight 45kg!!!!! Its a blessing but a curse at the same time...
Im sry to say this but as a fa-non-skinny person I cant relate.
Im not skinny and she can still dance better than me
That's the way I dance!
Thanks for confirming that u can’t dance
Yes
People body shame fat people the most but they shouldn t forget about the other extreme
As a skinny person these things are really annoying
As another very skinny person I definitely agree with this and that society thing is so true its what my former friends would say
ngl your tall
hey atleast your not ugly like me
VERY SKINNY AND THIS IS SOOO FREEKING RELATABLE
Can confirm
TEAMS SEAS
TEAMS SEAS
Off topic but I have wide feet that point away from each other, so since I was like four I have had so many “clever” jokes about how “you walk like a duck!” And it doesn’t help that I had a duck themed room as a kid.
The belt one can defo confirm I can only wear those belts which don’t need holes in them, lying down one can confirm too, it hurts alright, pretty much all of it can confirm
Can relate to #1. Once I lost some weight I noticed just how uncomfortable chairs really are.
I am cold a lot and I can’t dance
I was both skinny and chubby when I was a kid and I would say that being chubby is way worse.
Trust me me, being overweight  is also kinda bad.. you get fat shamed and also most of us can't dance either (that I've seen) and most people can barely dance oh this channel (I THINK) like were all a family of people that can't dance..
Hehehe I'm too fat to know what it's like but I do wish maybe one day I can be at least 200
I love how hard she is dancing 🤣
I eat a lot and I weigh a normal amount but my body looks like paper
I'm a teenager and just recently got to about 90 pounds, I'm really healthy but people telling me I need to eat more really makes me mad.
Ummm im skinny but  im alwais hot like when its like 4celcius i just go oit in t-shirt 😢😑
Pretty sure doing ppl take the dub when it comes to dancing buh 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hold on- 66kg? I'm under 13 and 62kg 😭
I agree with you... But the dance thing is on you lol
I'm in middle school and I'm considered "thin". I can still relate to all of these except the laying on my stomache one
The dancing isn't because you're skinny it's because you're white😂
This is so relatable 😂😂
I confirm this
What about fitting into your dryer? 🤨
Sameeee I can relate so much😂😂😂 Im thin as hell!🤘
The sitting one is so true and I hate it so much
This is me
I always took being skinny as a compliment lol
Yeah it’s annoying thing is I’m still called fat that’s the worse part yet most of my life I’ve been under weight and just your really bony when your skinny so my shoulders look huge
the third one isnt true
As a fat person, I get very cold easily,  seats hurt my ass too but it's because all the weight of my body is forcing my ass to support it so wood chairs hurt, I can't dance for shit either (best I got are the cupid shuffle and cha cha slide and even then, everyone can do them), and I got bullied by peers and family alike because of how I was heavy, so I feel you, I really do. Just make the most of it bc unfortunately things happen
To be fair Non skinny people can’t dance either
I find it funny that people complain when people are too skinny and then they also complain when people are too fat
*CAN dance 😳
I dated a girl like you once. The only one I could have fun with standing up with her legs wrapped around me 😏😏
I’m not sure if u just describes me or not but I’m not skinny I’m obeast
I keep my room 76 degrees, and just curl up on my bed and soak up the heat. My bones are hungry for the warmth
I am skinny but my pants and belts fit also I can dance amazingly
So relatable for me
Im so skinny, i can see my heart beeting
As a skinny person doing sit-ups hurt my tail bone,
i used to be super skinny and now i have problems being insecure about having too much weight /:
Same thank you I’m 5’3” and 84 pounds and I DO NOT HAVE any eating disorder which is so annoying and I eat so much ughhhh
Jesus fuck they almost didn’t let me join the marines so I had to put on so much weight. It’s honestly not good at all, I wanna be chubby.
Awww boohoo
Stop being relatable goddamnit I’m getting flash backs
4 and 5 are way too real
I totally find myself in this, thank you. There are always Videos like „Problems of small/Tall People“ but That… I can relate a 100%😊
Me tu I tried tu get fat et desent work
Same boat
Everyone always talks about fat people and tell us to eat but if a skinny person told a fat person to stop eating then that's a problem
you can danceeee lmaooooo u go dude
As a skinny person I can confirm
I am SKINNY and I CONFIRM
FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT
Don’t tell yourself that, Janus, you’re great at dancing
💗💗  As A Skinny Person This Is Very Accurate
Well this is my childhood in a flash back
My BMI is 14, so yeah, I relate
THE POKING HOLES IN THE BELT HIT HOME  Every single one of my belts has at least 4 holes poked in them
The ass bones statement is 100% real, and yes it definitely hurts to sit down for too long. If you also have issues being too tall, then you’ll find out that it hurts when you stand for too long. It’s a never ending battle between the butt bones and the leg/back/neck bones, and boy oh boy you never win.
I mean she dances better then me
and add the fact that's she's 6'2" or 6", skinny peeps are commonly tall and long.
What you mean you can't dance? Those moves were slaaaaaaay gurl.
As a skinny person I can agree another is walking bare foot hurts after about 10 mins and becomes unbearab after a bit but as a teen social media is the worst especially if your like me and your skinny because you have an eating disorder people just don't care what they say to people anymore
True
Had the same problem, developed bad eating habits as a guy, now struggle with mild fatness
omg this is so true like my extended fam would always be like “have you been eating!? Ur so skinny!” or “ur like as skinny as a stick” and then I had some ‘friends’ who were like “omg ur literally as light as feather picking you up is soooo easy” and the worst one “omg I can wrap my fingers around ur wrist” and it always made me feel so self conscious abt my weight and sometimes it still does
Imma chubby person
People make fun of me for that but this is what my family calls me a walking twig. It hurts me whenever they say that and I'm a little kid ish and I EAT MORE THAN THEM
I can relate to this in every possible way that I can as a skinny person who is also significantly underweight.
Ur a great dancer
Fun Fact: In Germany we call this type of dancing and overall lets say "movements": Körperklaus which means Body-Clown
Same… plus people secretly hate you  If bitches ain’t hatin’ you’re doing something wrong 👀
i can tolerate the cold pretty well and i'm not skinny or fat so i'd honestly rather be more cold than i am now than have to deal with hating my own appearance lmao  plus those dance moves were sick bro
Love the dancing
I'm 6ft tall and I weight 115 lbs,and I can confirm that this is accurate for me ,except for the getting cold one.
I am skinny as and I have ever problem you are talking about so I can can confirm
As a skinny person working construction I can confirm.... people tell me I need to eat until they see I eat 4-5 full meals a day just to keep at 125.....
as a skinny person and so as my brother, we both relate to this.
Yup. And God forbid you're one of those people that loses weight due to extreme stress and depression. I've literally been accused of being on drugs because I've always been lean, but I lose like crazy when I'm stressed 😩
Most people i know that are skinny are the kind to go out in a tanktop when its snowing.
Same, I way 79 lbs and I’m almost 15 😅
this is soo true it’s not ok
All is True, I am 186 cm tall and I can't dance. Even after I had dancing lessions
Confirmed by a skinny person. Not only that but if we try to squeeze a part of our body it just feels like a mossy statue. AND IT HURTS
I think I just fell Inlove
Weak mindset have better genetics be fat like me but still somehow weigh 55kgs  Edit am 72kgs now
you got some moves wym
This video just raised my confidence about my body just a bit cuz I'm not skinny😊
I am not skinny but hearing what the disadvantages of being skinny are, I don't wish to b
That "get some meat!" Hit hard
they used to tell me "did your brother eat your food?" i still remember
That dance comment was false you were straight schmoovin
As a very skinny person, all of these is accurate.
I used to be underweight a few years ago, at a healthy weight now. I was on ADHD meds which maybe DID play a TINY bit into my appetite. I've been off my meds since March 2021.
Cant relate 😐
(Me standing up after being seated for a while) People: why did you get up? Me: Oh, nothing... My bum: AAAHHH ! THE PAINNNNN !!!
don't forget random ppl coming up to you and trying to pick you up, or putting their fingers around your wrist and laughing at how skinny you are when their fingers touch each other
I wut rader be skinny than fat:(
As a skinny person who is a teen and has the weight of a ten year old and we eat as much as we can but we ain’t be gain by weight and the clothes and the comments mainly were relatable
These are all true and people only told me that "your skinny so you're attractive. Brains and muscle don't matter" I wanted to have friends so I thought bring skinny would help. I was wrong
I feel you on all this has a skinny male it’s dam near impossible to find my pants size
I am 12 and I am fucking 62lbs!!!!!
i am skinny and that is because i have fast metabolism and i loose weight every time which is a bad thing for me because i barley have any muscles.
i can confirm every fact. especially getting cold
I can relate to all of these until a year ago, and all of this is medical problems and stuff like that, but the dancing thing, that’s just because we can’t dance I don’t thinks that’s because of anything else.
His is sooooooooooooooooooooo true!!!!!!!
It’s so true for us skinny people
Video aside, Jayus' dance 👌
I agree as I am a skinny person
Kickass dance moves.
I like your dancing 💃
I wouldn't say I was born skinny, but due to some EDs, I got really skinny for at least a couple years. Its still such a pain to sit down or lay on hard surfaces, it SUCKS!!!
I can relate to all of this
WHY ARE WE THE SAME WEIGHT AND MY THIGHS ARE LIKE 40 INCHES
As a 25yr old 5ft female with a high metabolism..it took me forever to get over 85 pounds
YES!!!.   One year I was changing out in out for cross country and this popular girl I knew and her friend came in and said "Oh my gosh can I get you a burger" and I didnt know it was offensive and they were making fun of me and I told my parents later and they said they were making fun of me. I DIDNT EVEN KNOW!!! I way 73 pounds and I'm in highschool
The dancing at the end  … smh
Stick people unite
Number 6 is just joy incarnate lmao. Y'all ever wanna have a good time with somebody: go dance with Jayus!
honestly, i think all body types are hard for everyone. every body has its pros and cons
I am just like this except u can dance well
I'm fat... and i love skinny girls. For obvious reasons there can only be one fat person in my relationships and that is me
The comments are the worse, till this day I still feel uncomfortable and insecure. It’s fucked being a guy too because other guys try to fuck with you because you’re smaller and intimate you
Yeah I know this is real I am really skinny 😃..
It was always a blessing to me cause a new hole in my belt was worth being able to gobble up multiple cheeseburgers with no regrets.
“I can’t dance”  *proceeds to do the most elegant and beautiful dance I’ve ever seen*
I can’t relate to any of these.. but it really seems like no matter your weight or body type society is going to find a reason to ridicule you. Also pros and cons for both
As a fat person, I can confirmn't. Like seriously the entire opposite is true
I'm chubby and I relate to some of these
U can dance. I on the other hand can't
I'm 6'1 and weigh 130 pounds...ive managed to reach 150. Can confirm the comments were the worst. Of course I eat you fucking idiot. Piss off.
Still dances better than me
Fast metabolism + being born into a family that is naturally skinny = people thinking that I'm not healthy so I wear mainly baggy shirts.   Legit my mom's friend asked me if I had eaten today like a few years ago and I was like "I ate 205839 different things today???" and she made me get on the scale. That was embarrassing tbh.
I like how people come to me like "wow! go eat something"  b!tch ive just eated an entire cow and im still skinny
I think you did great at the dancing
Oh don’t worry as a part of the pretty big size community I say that because I’m not fat but I’m not skinny either or have muscles I can’t dance either
God as a skinny person these are all normal to me but I only realize now how these just wouldn’t apply to others lmao
As a non skinny person, id perfer these lol
SO TRUE
Idk if im skinny or not, like sometimes i’m like damn im skinny i gotta eat more but sometimes im like shit im too fat ill eat less. like wtf
Same, fully agree to you
I used to be skinny but I didn't have any problems and I was very young. But I'm FAT now
Flat chest still toh. Sry
8th grade me winning a national dance competition despite of being skinny: 👁👄👁
Agreed
The belt one tho…I get grommet belts bc they have hole EVERYWHERE. It’s awesome.
The worst part is trying to gain the weight
Post ur basketball highlights
Most relatable is how cold u get
I can relate. Lol
Yeah not being able to dance isn’t a skinny problem trust me I’m a bad dancer
Almost all these fit on me and im fat😂😭
Welcome to the skinny society
as a skinny person, i cant confirm the cant dance thing  i dance like a fucking cockroach after you spray like teza on it
same. exept im skinny bc of D E P P R E S S I O N
This is so relatable lol especially the last one somehow
Don't worry, I can't dance either. And I'm 4 times as heavy as you are Edit: unless your measurement was in kilograms, then I'm only twice as heavy
yep
onlyjayus dancing blessed my life
“Do you even eat?” And the worst of all “Are you anorexic?”  just why would you even say this to a teenager
Cant relate.
As a skinny person I can relate...
If your skinny than stop by my restaurant
Wow I always thought there were mostly perks but I think this Is just people who are under the average weight
Omg I relate
yes
Lol my own family makes those cracks like “Do you even eat!?” Or “You’re basically skin and bones!” So that’s fun 🥲👍
As a fat person, I cannot confirm.
I have a skinny waist too.   I’m a guy, lord help me.
Bruh I still weight 39 kilograms... When someone sees me eating they be like omg you can eat?? YES BITCH I ALSO AM A HUMAN
Not gonna cap the last one as a skinny boi mighttt not be true for every skin person cuz you know I be dancing like a champ or so i think XD
Yes
I think No.4 is just a her problem. Love the tips keep up the good work.
I can relate. However it’s easier for me I think because I’m not a giant like you 😂
Witch one is the worst for you guys?
yo wtf this is so dumb 😭😭 yall wanna have problems so bad
The last one is how I dance 🤣
I can't dance either, each time I try I look like a chicken trying to run away.
We both got problems. Whenever I where jeggings the  area always gets lighter over time because  my thighs rub together or they get those little lint things on the thigh area. But it’s easy to fix. Cant wear jeans because I have a Fupa :,). Everyone in the comments are skinny legends and me......not so much. I mean I love my body(except my Fupa). I could work it out :). Never heard a skinny person complain about these problems. It’s a first. I’ve been called fat 2 times in my life. But I’m not a person to get depressed about. Call me fat it’s ok but at the end of the day I’m going to curse you out and going straight to the principal. Cause your not gonna call me a name and not expect me to say nothing . But thankfully I haven’t been bullied. But if I ever do I know how to handle instead of crying about. Thx for coming to my Ted talk
Evil joker be like:we don’t live in a society
If skinny people could dance it would still be awful
So true.
Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up so I mean no one‘s gonna be skinny for long
god i wish i had those problems
I love to dance, and those dance moves were pretty good if I do say so myself!
nice
Hi Bella!
I eat more than anyone in my family and an still damn skinny, can relate to all of these 😔
bruhhhh all true
Jokes on you, I’m fat and I still can’t dance
Suspenders. Suspenders are the way.
i was eating cake and my stepdad’s sister told her daughter to leave me alone cuz i needed to gain weight. so yes, i can confirm this is true. 😭🤚🏻💔
i know you're gonna tell me different but im fat and feel like it would be better for me to be skinny

Other than being skinny, Bella is also clumsy asf 😂💀
