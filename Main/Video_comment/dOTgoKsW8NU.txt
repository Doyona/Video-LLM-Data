Ref needs Specsavers
He doesn't just handle it - he pushes the ball towards the goal.
What are you guys talking about? His hands were down, it would've hit his body regardless
The 1st goal 🤯🤯 handball ref
Kurt zouma wishes the ball was that cat
Bournemouth robbed here Var needs binning
dont think Bournmouth had anything in this game Zoumas goal was shocking
Horrible game with two bad teams.
Shambles.
If that’s a pen then travelling should also be given as a pen.
Even the penalty decision,  is he meant to slide with his arms behind his back ?
What is happening to football, that is a joke esp the first goal. West Ham better not moan about referring decisions for the rest of the season.
Don’t support either team, but that ref needs investigating
No one gonna talk about how bad the Sky highlights are? At least 3 other incidents and numerous other moments I'd liked to have seen.
Never a goal. Ref was a hammer fan!
from a westham fan us lot have had crazy var for and against us...bourne mouth had it hard this week but that game vs chelsea was just as bad
Got to be worst var decision this year goal should not have stood
Micheal Jordan would have been proud of that pass.
I have to say as a west ham fan that the first goal was desgusting
handball x2 1-0
Were the West Ham fans booing Zouma? 🤣
Up the Hammers it is about time we had a bit of luck on our side ⚒️⚒️
Var/ refs should be held accountable for these errors to the many thousands of punters who lost money last night on the first goal, handball all day long
Benny Best player on the pitch Love him 🔥
Zouma the cat kicker / animial abuser , what a man !!
Ironic they appealed for a handball
Shocking VAR decision. I support the use of VAR, but what were they smoking in the VAR Hub?
So corrupt.
As a Hammer, that should have been disallowed...
West Ham scored from a handball against Leicester to last minute equalise, stole the three points from us
How inconsistent are the refs this year with handball and pens.... shocking
West Ham love playing a bit of volleyball in the penalty area. Craig Dawson scored with his elbow last year vs Leicester...
Premier League referees are something else. I hope we don't get to see any in the world cup!
Moyes crying about the Southampton goal the other day but has nothing to Say on these… typical moyes cry baby
DONT FORGET CALLUM WILSON HANDBALL AGAINST US 5 YEARS AGO FOR BOURMOUTH SO HAVE SOME OF THAT HAHAHHAA
Premier league’s rubbish
First goal was a crossover between football and volleyball 😂
VAR 2 Bournemouth 0
😸 🐱
The kitty kicker scoring🤮
So handball is or isn’t a thing? I’m so confused…
So we can all play volleyball in the box now can we. Cool!
My god what an absolute joke.. these referees need rounding up and sacking on the spot. Get the lot out, along with all the VAR officials too. It’s like they’re just having a laugh at this point seeing how much they can get away with it
Kurt Zouma abuses animals. Bad man.
I don’t even know what the rules are anymore. Just seems like they make it up and change their minds week by week
that was ball to hand not hand to ball shocking refereeing
It was all just too easy. Bournemouth down by feb
How is Zouma still playing?
West Ham & Newcastle are the two surprise contenders this season and not forgetting Arsenal who have started this season with a BANG! (It’s no longer just a two horse race between Man City & Liverpool (after the international Break we will see who’s got what it takes.........& who hasn’t!
That was flat-out cheating, he actually used his arms to guide it towards goal, you see him physically turn and push it towards goal..  Shocking decision.
VAR dead in the water...what a joke of a decision.
Someone's paid for the bots to simp for Bournemouth then 🤔 It could've been given as handball and wouldn't have been overturned, but his arms are down and it doesn't directly lead to the goal as a Bournemouth player heads it next. You can see the difference between that and the penalty
I am under no delusions about our first goal. What on earth… and why is it Zouma’s goal? Listen, we’ve had some really rubbish decisions against us this season, some truly unfathomable ones, so I think it’s fair that we get one back, but… how have we got that? How is that allowed? Well, I think the second is a penalty, and I think we deserved the points, but that first goal is definitely… just wow. On a more positive note, I’m always happy to see our youngsters making their move into the first team. Get in, Flynn! ⚒️ Come on you Irons!
To all those saying hand ball in the first goal learn the rules hand were close enough into his body that it wasn’t a handball just like Eder militao vs Liverpool
Joke league 😂 supposed to be the best in the world 😂😂😂
Var,bury it now,they make it up as they go along,if that was a pen the other was not a goal.
Shocking decisions. Premier league is getting worse to watch than ever before. No consistency unlike the Champions League and other european leagues. Referees pretty much have a huge hand in the scorelines. It's a joke. Football is meh at the moment
I’m sorry but I am laughing at the decision cos it’s a catastrophe if the decision is against you but you love it when it’s for you. I’m a hammer and it shouldn’t have stood but I can’t help but feel like a hypocrite 😅
Could someone explain how ever after a VAR check, that first goal stood?? Ridiculous.
volleyball allowed in the PL now
The penalty - the hands were in a natural position.  When you slide, your hands go upwards to help you do the action.
WTAF VAR Is becoming a jk
Csnt the referees make there own decisions rather then rely on var. First goal should stand as hands weren't in unnatural position, standard
one of the worst var decisions i have ever seen
Stuff like that's why I'm dreading VAR in Scotland.
The first goal was given because Bournemouth have had 2 opportunities in that build up to get rid of it but the West Ham players have won all the aerial duels. It's in fact the Bournemouth defender that heads it straight back to Soucek. Had Zouma flicked it in straight from Kehrer var would have ruled it out
Glad there was a second goal for West Ham. I think we deserved to win but I disagreed with the first VAR call. Unlucky Bournemouth because there was probably an argument against the second goal however I thought it was the right call.
Penalty was harsh I thought. How do you fall to black a shot without your arms raising? Especially with no time to react at that proximity
The second one is just as bad if not worse. Given that gabriels identical handball against Liverpool was not given. This is coming from an arsenal fan by the way. This will definitely be a season to forget for VAR. they’re taking it game by game. There is no consistency at all from game to game, it gives off all the wrong impressions, like they’ve chucked the rule book and just play it by whatever reaction was to a previous contentious decision
Don’t really understand how it can be handball 😭😭. Where can your hands be. He’s not made his body any bigger. If his hands aren’t there it hits hit body the exact same way. They should of had a red for that challenge on scamacca so we’ll call it 1-1 on var decisions.
These handball rules are becoming a joke- there’s no consistency with VAR
Lovely goal by the cat botherer.
How sean dyche and the spitter carragher could say the first goal was good is beyond belief give them some specs the player 100% played the ball with his arm had no intention of heading that ball . As for penalty disbelief as a neutral
Some Happy Hammers in the VAR room tonight😂 COYI
West Ham's first goal was invalid. A handball of the attacking side, albeit nondeliberate, is unacceptable.
The amount of people that don't understand the laws of football but have the gall to complain about refs is HILARIOUS
That’s the worst var decision I’ve ever seen sort it out premier league 😡
Little bit of magic from Thilo
Both VAR decisions were contrary to the assurances made when VAR was introduced: the first was a volley-ball set and the second was ball to hand.
The only reason I can see for the ref allowing that Zouma goal is that the ref hates cats too
When are we going to stop thinking that arms not tucked by ones side is automatically "arms in an unnatural position". Every time someone jumps, slides, etc., their arms are going to be away from their bodies! Makes zero sense
Always west ham getting goals that should of been ruled out but they stand just look at them against fulham all 3 goals they scored were controversial 2 handballs and a pen that fulham didn't even do
First goal was a handball
this is getting ridiculous. a more blatant handball you'll never see. Needs investigating now properly. check bank accounts for sudden deposits
finally a goal from corner..i missed it so much lately..keep doing it and keep winning
Any where else on the pitch and it’s a handball
Its nice now players can play a little volley ball and provide an assist to score a goal - keep up the good work VAR and Refs
Amazing what Moyes moaning at VAR every week can do to help decisions eh?
Does anyone know what is, and what isn't handball in the modern game..???? ...
Bournemouth may have had a surprisingly good start, but they're now well and truly back in a relegation scrap.
Do they just pick up these VAR officials off the steeet an hour before kick off? Absolutely laughable
How did that first goal stand? MADNESS!!
Penelty
surprised Zouma Didn't do the cat celebration
The ball headed towards the goal after the contact with the hand. How the hell is that not handball.
VAR 2 Bournemouth 0
west ham must love var, another handball goal
Yet another poor VAR decision that could cost a club millions!
First goal is the definition of handball
Honestly , what is the point in VAR
Refereeing was TERRIBLE
Well according to the laws of the game as written the first one is not a handball, the second one is not a handball either, but when you have totally spurious and subjective interpretations you get nonsense like this. I want the refs to tell me specifically what about his arms for the second one was "unnatural"?
what was Alan Smith on about with the travers save on rice`s volley it was dipping and moving and he got a solid fist on it and pushed it out to safety, Allison or Ederson would do the same thing in that situation too risky to try catch a shot like that
If Zoumas goal counted rashford against Everton should have
So we're now adding the rules of volleyball to football right? Worst VAR decision all year, unbelievable!
Shocking, 1st was handball, 2nd wasn't...thats a natural position when sliding in surely? Just saying Liverpool fan.
This handball rule is still silly ... as a defender you can't even tackle with your hands by your side .just not possible .... as to the goal .it hit his hand in the build up to the goal .so shiuld of been disallowed
What even is the handball rule anymore? I don't know if it's just me who thinks this, but I honestly think the first was handball and the second wasn't. Of course, I can also see a reasonable case for them both being handball or neither being handball; but for VAR to ignore the first and give the second is just mind boggling to me.
Poor game Bournemouth had terrible decisions go against them.
VAR is totally spoiling and killing the game.
See stevie wonders been put on VAR duty again. 🤦🏻‍♂️ shambles.
Oh dear referee you got it so wrong.
When did the rules change to allow handball?
I'm a west ham fan and that's just funny
VAR is great stop complaining
Even the second one was bad, the guy has to put his arms up for balance when he goes in for that tackle!
First goal never should have stood, I heard the ref explanation and it just seems so stupid. Also how is it a penalty for the hand ball later when that wasn't a penalty for Liverpool against arsenal just two weeks ago but I guess it also was a penalty the day before that but I forget what game it was. Where is the consistency with the decision making.
1:36 - if that's not handball I dont know what is 🤔🤔🤔🤔
as a bournemouth fan i have to say we were outplayed but i think var and ref were definitely not making the correct decisions as far as the first goal goes
Neither goals should have stood. However, west ham dominated and deserved the 3 points
how does zouma goal stand but the handball in the box before the penalty stands. wow, bournemouth robbed
As a fan of football, VAR is NOT needed. What we need is BETTER REFERRING
Alan smith is awful. Makes a meal of it … keepers palmed Rices shot well out wide !
Didn't realise volleyball moves were OK
Two very different handball calls here. Deliberate? Non-deliberate? Can someone clarify what a handball is?
i support westham but var needs to be scrapped asap, when the ref gave the goal i said to myself "that wasnt a goal tho"..var is a joke i will not accept a win like that, i felt no joy with the win... VAR 2-0 BOURNEMOUTH
When is handball NOT handball ?
We may aswell scrap VAR , it clearly isn’t being used properly
I don't follow cricket and rugby so much, but never seems to have such issues over these sorts of decisions.  Is that true? If so, why? It seems every week (every game?) These sorts of things are happening-and its not even 50/50  calls-so many are baffling!!
No way that first goal should have stood. That player intentionally moved the ball towards the goal with his arms. Dreadful decision.
That was a volleyball move for the first goal
Two terrible VAR decisions got the goals
If there is one job that needs replaced by robots, it’s referees!
the handball rule is a complete joke this season
You give a goal then a penalty discraseful
The ref is a west ham supporter.
As a WHU fan I feel for Bournemouth I thought both hand ball decisions were poor and West Ham didn’t play well at all. I think a draw would have been a fair result as both teams weren’t great.
That Zouma goal is a joke, VAR needs to be 100% correct otherwise get rid of it, the Championship is far better to watch than the Prem due to this.
This League is being ruined by the incompetent VAR officials
VAR 🙈🤷‍♂️
It's called a 'dig' in volleyball. I didn't think it was allowed in football, but obviously it's ok.
VAR is just awful, just go back to before. WHs first goal he basically volleyball passed it towards the goal
1th goal not correct. What is var for ?? That is how you do points at "home" ..and we heart so critic about influences in Anfield . Refferees in uk are disgrace for fotbal. Blee..
Not the most straightforward of West Ham wins, but oh well.
Can someone explain why West Ham got a penalty for that and Newcastle didn’t against Tottenham for the exact same thing?
Wilson did it to us years back with he’s arms so call it pay back
Stone wall handball, if that happened outside of the box a free kick would be given, and it went to var and still gave it. This is wrong
NO WAY ZOUMA’S GOAL STOOD! TERRIBLE
How was Rashfords goal against Everton chalked off when the ball was almost caught for Zuma's goal.
So what I've learned over the past few weeks is arsenal and West ham are allowed use their hands and get away with it. The decision refs are making you'd think their told what to give to certain teams
The better team won... end of.
That was the most synchronised handball call ever heard
Are you tall?   Nah I'm solanke
I amazed the first isn't a handball as he clearly directs the ball,yet the second one is a penalty!? still what do i know i am only a humble land worker.
Zouma... went in by a whisker!
I don't understand the handball rule anymore
No surprises here. David Cootes was doing VAR when he thought Jordan Pickford's assault on VVD was not a foul. Absolutely shocking standards now with PL referees with absolutely no accountability,
Terrible atmosphere
Refereeing and var has been shocking and amazingly inconsistent lately. Absolute joke
Meow
Man just get rid of VAR. It's ruining the game.
VAR has completely destroyed the joy or football and refs have lost the ability to see and to think because they rely on it completely. Used to be such a good, spontaneous game...now it's a bureaucratic nightmare.
var is a joke
The rules of football seem to have changed. Week by week.
Football or Volley ball ? Dunno but what I do know is these refs need sacking top to bottom
WTF VAR, it got both those handballs wrong, first one was handball, second one wasn't.
Thats the trouble with the handball new laws for the first goal     Hands by his body,not out,  I doubt whether if it was a Bournemouth player doing it it wouldnt of been a pen    Second handball for the pen,the defenders arms not in a natural position ???  How else can you dive in to make a block and keep your arms beside your body ??           2 bad mistakes in my view ,and thats coming from a Hammer
That second handball is almost identical to Gabriel’s against Liverpool that wasn’t given…
agree re first goal but second one was OK. also WH have been on the end of some terrible decisions this season.....still tough on Bournemouth though...
The problem isn't the referee here, it's the rule. The rule is stupid, not the referee's interpretation of it
west ham making moves 👏 top 11 now
😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺😺
How was that penalty any different to Gabriels against Liverpool?
It’s obvious that the referees don’t have any discussions with current or former players before or during the season to agree on what is handball and what isn’t. No common sense is applied at all
These refs are making the prem unbearable. Honestly, if you watch the German league, you will see how right they get it (with VAR and officiating a match) English officials are beyond terrible, goes to show how the English can't do anything right. Take the foreign players away from the league, it would be worse than the Danish league
Thing is the refs/var are following the rule. Goals can’t be given if directly affected by a handball. That rule is dumb asf. Man U vs Boro fa cup last season was the most blatant handball but the player didn’t score from it so it counts.
What a contradiction, two hand balls and Bournemouth get done by both decisions.
Handball rules are completely and utterly broken. How the West Ham goal can be allowed, considering a very strange handball diverting the ball towards goal, yet Bournemouth can be penalised for a ball being blasted at him from point blank range, whilst making a genuine attempt to win the ball, is laughable.
Ref shud b sacked as a west ham fan
I have no problem with the penalty, but Kehrer deliberately hit the ball towards goal with his arms.
They give the penalty but allow the first goal? How inconsistent do you want to be? People who control VAR have never played a game of footie in their life
Penalty was a carbon copy of Gabriel in the Liverpool game and that wasn't given. VAR has zero consistency and that's what's annoying fans the most
This ref was paid
that was a great set up for the first goal... we are playing volleyball aren't we?
You didn’t need VAR for the penalty. The defender’s face said it all.
I actually thought var have to it wrong twice in one game .  Ruined football.  And it's you TV pundits what have caused this mess , wanting it . Now you don't . Just concentrate on your job and stop interference and let the fans enjoy it .
Not a fan of either team, two ridiculous decisions. VAR clearly not eliminating/reducing errors, it's creating them. Is there a boozer in Stockley Park?
Seems like both teams were playing handball today ✋️
All i can see is empty seats
FIFA are gonna have to write some kind of rule about 'consistency' in the officiating
First goal was more of a hand ball than the second one !
That was Volleyball
The guy handballs the ball to go up
What footballer naturally crosses his hands in front of himself unless playing volleyball ??? Shameful decision.
@SKYSPORTS ! Please PUT THE SCORE BOARDS on the highlights ! thanks
Wtf that is shocking
Nothing wrong with the Zouma goal in todays rules but the penalty was harsh
Time to get rid of these corrupt referees! Not a fan of either club but it is getting silly now
All these nonsensical VAR decisions highlight just how bad referees are in this league - way below the level of football being played.
“Magic”
Both goals are controversial.disgrace
Everyone complaining yet his hands at are his torso and guess what.... it made NO impact whatsoever as the last touch came off a defenders head before leading to the goal. If it came off his hands and then immediately went to another teammate then you can complain.
Shame no one gave zouma a booting.
Is this football highlights or volleyball highlights?
His hands were in front of his stomach were they aren't usually and it bounced the ball up for the goal 100% should have been disallowed
good to see the prem just continue to make up how we interpret rules differently each match
Tough VAR on Bournemouth...1st goal absolute shocker
AFCB don’t fit the prem narrative, so blatantly corrupt
How has that first West Ham goal counted 😂😂😂 looks like the most obvious handball call yet it looks like Kehrer is playing Volleyball rather than football lmaooooo
And their fans are saying that the league is rigged for top 6 teams and they are the ones always being robbed, yet they scored two handball goals lol. Bunch of hypocrites
Ain’t no way they have that first goal 😭😭
VAR was on point this time. It have lot of hiccups but it done it's job atleast once.
Don't blame West Ham but the refereeing and VAR are a joke.
Makes a change to have luck on our side for once,I can’t believe they gave us the first goal that was handball everyday of the week. I am going to spec savers in the week and I think the ref and var team should come with me and perhaps we will get a discount 😊. Coyi bring on Man Utd.
Am I blind did zouma actually even touch the ball 😳 serious 😂
Sorry what 😂 VAR is so shameless this season it’s beyond a joke now
I’m a Newcastle fan so have no bias here, but you got to feel for Bournemouth. What a ridiculous set of decisions, a deliberate handball allowed then a clear accidental handball given as a penalty? Another VAR shocker.
Solanke couldn’t wash the kit never mind score goals he’s rubbish… and the first goal decision is even worse how is that a goal VAR gets worse every week it’s incredible it’s so bad from the officials I’d love to take home half they get paid to sit there and make decisions like that wtf it’s atrocious
i may just be a biased west ham fan but surely if his hands are down and are in a natural position (by his side) it isn't handball, what am I missing?
Cresswells been on it lately, into the FPL team after the United game 😉
If the ball accidentally hits the hand it's a handball, but if you control the ball with your hand, is not a handball.   - VAR
Amazing VAR
What a load of crap that first goal was. It hit both his hands .  Footballs gone crazy now.   What a fix
He hit it like a volleyball and that isn't handball? What a joke
Take nothing from West Ham but it's VAR rearing it's very ugly head again, proving just how irrelevant it is as it does more damage than good, week in week out. I know it's the human error that is ruing the technology, but with no attempt to fix this and only getting worse, there has to be some form of protest from the fans to force change.
That's karma for Wilson's handball goal, in an offside position for Bournemouth's equaliser in the 3-3 game.  Didn't hear any Cherries fans complaining about his "magic" touch on that day!! Those 2 dropped points could've been very costly seeing as Bournemouth finished 2 points above us that season.
Up until now I’ve been in favour of VAR , but stuff like this is making me question it. How do you give a penalty but not chalk off the first goal?  It’s all starting to unravel. The first goal should have stood and the second was no penalty. Neither were intentional handballs with hands in an unnatural position.
Manchester United had a goal disallowed over a similar handball against Everton (I'm an Everton fan). VAR with its double standards again! Definate handball!
That is absolutely unbelievable. Forest fan here and first of all cat kicking Kurt shouldn't be allowed to play in general, second that was the worst var decision in the history of Var. Absolutely never a penalty either. He couldn't do anything about it! Bournemouth deserve better treatment
Need new manager shocking few weeks for Bournemouth!!! Sort it out waste of my hard earned money!! Players are not good enough need signings of over 50 million in January or we will go down :(
Hand Assistance… 😂
One is handball and one isn't, Prem Ref☕️
God i hate how smug Zouma is
All VAR has done is create problems that never existed before. The phases of play around a handball is just ridiculous - you can have ‘phases’ for offsides as being in an offside position is not in itself and offence. But a handball is a handball. End of.
From a Hammer, can't believe that first goal stood. But since Bournemouth are a snidey team I'll sleep well tonight.
The fact that the first goal was not given as handball but the penalty for handball was given in the same game is a shocker. Mike Dean on VAR. Fool
That decision for the first goal is ridiculous. There's no way the FA can justify that.
The moral of this video... A handball is only illegal if it happens to Bournemouth 😂 This whole officiating VAR nonsense is becoming ridiculous. Great idea - incompetent referees using it 👎
Tough game that for Bournemouth with the decisions that we’re made. As a West Ham fan that wasn’t a nice way to win the game. However COYI
If Zouma was an Arsenal player that would have been disallowed and a red card would have been shown 🙄
See it this way: At least we had some entertainment in an otherwise totally boring match!
West Ham fan here, I’d be fuming if I was you tonight. I don’t know how the first goal was given and the penalty was debatable. Ok the other hand, I don’t know how Lerma didn’t get sent off for his challenge on Scamacca. Poor refereeing all game.
Even in highlights clips the VAR takes ages.  If we don't have people who can run it, we should keep goal line technology and scrap the rest.  It's ruining the joy of a goal being scored when the ball hits the back of the net.
Poor Kurt, confusing cats and balls again. Cats are for hands, footballs are for feet.
Shoutout to this commentator by the way, he’s absolute class
I thought that was a fair decision
Liverpool literally had the same situation vs Arsenal yet var say one is a pen ones not
That first goal!? WTF. This game we called football, is well and truly dead.
Has cat abuser scored ?
Var is destroying games for real
Me just thinking why should the goal not stand but after seeing var I realise how bad var really is
West Ham (and friends) 2…Bournemouth 0
I don’t support each team but I cannot believe in a million years how the pussy cat man’s goal was given unbelievable and I mean unbelievable
What is the point of VAR if we're going to allow a blatant handball?
If a handball in the build up of a goal is allowed so should a foul
west ham get favourable decisions every year. the league LOVES the narrative of a rough and tumble midweek game and them forcing home a corner controversially. it decided the outcome of the title last season. most blatant foul on the keeper (alisson) you will ever see
VAR still killing the beautiful game...
So much bs
Did moyes say the var had to go to spec savers today or was he happy?
Var screws up again cant even get a handball correct who is doing var a blind man
How in hell was that first goal given......they need to seriously look at these crappy VAR decisions lately.
Not a West Ham fan,but come on,he used both hands together to ease ball forward,as a result they score a few seconds later, absolute joke VAR
He kicks the ball as well as he kicks his  cat
Meow
Once again robbed by var, I’m not even surprised anymore, the prem clearly just don’t want us around.
Var needs to go. The people running it have really poor judgement pretty often and we aren't really seeing a benefit anymore. Football has become worse with var, not better.
Benrahma was just shooting on sight for whole game lol he must’ve had like 10 shots in total but I’m happy he got his goal in the end
Ref should be sacked after that ngl
Benrahma was awesome tonight ⚽️⚽️
When does it get to the point you sack all these referees who have an agenda against Bournemouth
Boo!
Both decisions are very poor. The rules of football these days are crazy
The first goal was given for playing Volleyball and the second one a penalty? Rubbish referring!!! Absolutely shocking...
First Fulham now Bournemouth, what is going on?
Var was shocking today
Support West Ham as well and that first goal given was shocking
What kind of game was it tonight from West Ham Two One Tick and One Cross Var decisions for West Ham to win this game what is this is it the giving West Ham the win or something
So the handball that actually led to a goal was deemed not to have had any affect on the goal being scored. Then a handball that no one has a clue whether a goal scoring opportunity would have resulted was deemed to have been serious enough to warrant a penalty. Why do they not allow indirect free kicks for accidental handball? Better than this mess.
The var is blind 😅
Both shocking decisions. And I'm neutral
That First Goal shouldn't count it was a deliberate hand ball where the ball landed on his hands when the corner came it shouldn't of stand VAR didn't look carefully and therefore referee should of gone to the monitor and disallow it but unfortunately the decisions that VAR gets worse
handball and a penalty West ham lucky there
the goal was allowed since one of the Bournemouth defenders headed the ball after kerrhers handball so the passage of play in which he handball it was different to the one zouma scored in a definite handball though and I can see why Bournemouth fans are frustrated
why are Sky Sports PL posting volleyball highlights?
1. its not deliberate. thats the only reason the goal stood. since its not the scorer, var cant do anything. blame the laws not the ref. 2. its a penalty. i cant see it any other way.
Handballs, bloody handballs 😥😥😥🍒🍒🍒  I mean, by the letter of the law, I *suppose* VAR giving the goal is *possibly* correct. Mephan heading it back out from goal I think was the clincher, it interrupted play, so it re-booted the passgae of play as it were. But taking a wholistic point of view, it was defiitely a handball and it happened seconds before the ball was in the net. I get he wasnt making his body bigger, but they were totally unnaturally positioned.  As for the pen, probably had to be given. Others this season and last that were similar have also been given. Zemura knew it too. But its never easy having them go against you. If he'd been maybe 2 or 3 inches closer to Coufal then perhaps he would have been 'too close'.  Margins!
Wow...I don't support either side, but that has clearly handball that led to a goal and it wasn't a penalty. Should have been 0-0.
As a West Ham fan i say VAR has had far too many bad decisions against us over the last couple of seasons for me to worry about tonights decisions that went our way and i defy anyone to disagree with me.
I'm just beyond words at this point. It's like VAR is staffed exclusively by concussed gibbons.
How has that first goal stood the man was playing volleyball in the box
How have West Ham got away with that first goal 🤦‍♂️
Are West Ham fans booing zouma??
Three handball decisions, two by West Ham one by Bournemouth, all three in West Ham's favour.  Bournemouth is a small club, not liked by the FA.
some of the decisions from refs this season  shows their not sure of the rules due to rules being changed every year. Hand and arm moved to direct the ball towards the goal.
Awful game, even Robbie Earl was bored
The premier league and sky sports pundits want Bournemouth out of the league because of our unattractive small stadium. Football needs to change, fast. Rules no one clearly understands, no care about fans. Moving the Manchester United away game to a normal working day. Seriously might consider supporting a small non-league team. Would be much more enjoyable to watch with little or no bias. We desperately need to change the handball rule and the rule makers should be ex footballers who know the game.
As a West Ham fan I am over the Moon with those two absurd VAR decisions.  West Ham are going to struggle this season and those three points will help keep us up.
On the way home zouma bought a bag full of cats to celebrate with
lets hope the hammers get a win at old trafford next 😂
VAR is beyond a joke! How can a ball that travels 30 yards, hit a hand of an attacker & get knocked towards goal & lead to a goal not be handball but a ball that travels less than a yard, which the defender has no idea where it’s going gets given as a penalty?!?  Teams are simply going to stop trying block the cross coming in if they are in the area, it’s the only way to stop giving penalties away! Embarrassing!!
Too bad thought Bournemouth were gonna win ☹️
That first goal is fine... in volleyball
Oh... I came here to watch the football highlights but ended up watching Volleyball highlights...
All these fake west ham fans claiming it was a handball is hilarious. Armchair fans. Go watch cricket or something. We were all over them. Suck a dummy.
Rodri goal disallowed due to handball, then this stands, wtf is the standard of refereeing in this country????????
The 😼 kicker should be banned from playing
That penalty being called but jota and Gabriel wasn’t is the height of corruption
I’m a West Ham fan and I’d be fuming with that first goal lol but we have had more than our fair share of bad VAR calls that have cost us points. Great penalty by benny though 🔥⚒
Absolute rubbish, how was that not hand ball
Zouma pounced on that like a cat   Oh wait
Both decisions  involving the goal were really dodgy
Referees and var lately are shocking
Bournemouth were extremely unlucky - first goal was a clear handball, while the penalty arose from a marginal handball.
Was that a netball trial I saw?
How is the first goal not a handball!?🤣 honestly it's like they have a get out of handball free card at West Ham  Ref- see the 2 goals they scored the other week!🤦‍♂️
First goal as a West Ham fan was a joke of a decision
There should be red card for referee as well. That ref is a joker and should not be allowed in any PL game. How can you miss that  volleyball doublehand pass in VAR ?
So a handball two seconds from the goal was too far back but a Haaland push way further back in the Liverpool game was counted. Mmmm.
Kurt Zouma with the reflex's of a cat there 😺
disgusting decisions vars a joke
Didnt know you could punch the ball now
That was a deliberate handball for the 1st goal, how did the ref and VAR give it
Perfect volleyball set up by Thilo, from a West Ham fan ⚒😂
Was good today. Playing 3 defensive midfielders is not the way forward tho. We didnt really have a choice today with cornet and paqueta injured but i hope when they're back we play 4 out of the 5 (scammaca  benrahma bowen cornet paqueta) in the team. We need more creativity going forward.
Kehler put hands on that ball like it was Zouma with his cat.
VAR has ruined the game
'Sail into top 10'? Honestly, two appalling decisions. Yet Sky pundits happy. The pundits are as inconsistent as VAR. Haaland push on Saturday and Wilson challenge equally bad decisions based on previous ones.
That Wisconsin volleyball team would be proud
How is that animal abuser still allowed to play
I feel bad for Zouma still getting booed.
Ridiculous War decisions. Nothing more to say!
Can we just go back to linesmen and refs ? Having more humans involved just created more human errors…. It’s either incompetency or match fixing and either way these officials should be sacked
VAR karma for the equaliser goal wrongly disallowed against Chelsea earlier in the season.
Rumours are 2 Alsations and a Labrador were In charge of the VAR.
Zouma had the reflexes of a Cat scoring that goal
1st goal Bournemouth are unlucky as the handball led to the goal so VAR well done for being shocking but at least you got the penalty right VAR is consistent and being inconsistent
*steal
How can the West Ham goal be allowed, but the penalty given as well 😂😂😂😂
Refereeing seems to get worse and worse - the simplest decisions don’t just take an age they are then ever more frequently getting them wrong
Absolute farce or VARce of a game
first goal shouldn’t have stood nor should the second one have been a penalty. I mean where is Zemura suppose to put his arm? he was so close to him that he wouldn’t have been able move his arm out of the way.
Funny refereeing
And that kids is why you don’t leave the stadium early
West Ham deserved to win over the course of the whole game HOWEVER we have now had AT LEAST 10 VAR decisions go against us this season IN 12 GAMES! How many have gone in our favour? 0, yes that is right, ZERO for us. I know they don't want us in the premier league, but can they at least make it a little less obvious? Feels like we are playing against 19 teams, however many refs AND VAR. Oh and don't forget when they turned the goal line technology off which also helped send us down last time.
Upton Park how i miss you. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👍🏼❤️
Ref vs Bournemouth
There's no point having VAR if it's still gonna be ruined by idiots, may as well save time and be rid of it, genuinely shocking decision for the first goal and the second one shouldn't have needed it
Volleyball is now allowed in football. What a joke that is. So it is handball but because it happened before a Bournemouth was able to head away its not handball. If Mepham then just ducked under it and let it go in are they saying it is handball then?
Really feel for Bournemouth to lose to two handballs must suck
How dumb is this handball rule now. The goal literally couldn't have happened without the handball and it led directly to a goal
Massive win. Wasn't the best performance, but it was all about the 3 points today. COYI!⚒
Absolutely shocked of a VAR decision!
This handball rule is so inconsistent :/
Hammers need a strong midfielder like Partey or Tiago, Soucek is so weak. Bowen was terrible and should have been substituted earlier, Antonio falling like a snow flake. West Ham got away big time. Benrahma man of the match.
this is why i don't watch football
Wet Spam
Kurt the cat kicker... Sounds like the local smackhead
Top 10 😂
I know why the handball was not given, it was so crowded in the box, you couldn’t swing a cat in there.
Congratulations to the cat beater
Wow, even in a season of terrible VAR decisions. That first goal might be the worst yet.
Where are his hands supposed to be?
VAR is an absolute joke when it comes to handball
The first and second goals clearly demonstrate when it is and isn’t handball. Kehrer can’t cut his arms off!
Shocking decision, how was that first goal not handball?
VAR is beyond a joke at this point.
we have had enough of this crap disgraceful refereeing. the organization needs to be called out properly week in week out var does what it always does
What’s the difference between their second and the disallowed (Gabriel) Liverpool vs Arsenal 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
how is that not handball? i know it was unintentional but the ball only ended up where it did because it bounced of his hand
The fact that Zoumas goal stood is nothing short of a Catastrophe
Disgrace that Zouma is still allowed to play.
I don't see what the issue is here! Both of his hands are tucked into his body. The ball might as well have hit his midriff or chest. Bournemouth have had the chance to clear it immediately but failed. Not contentious at all. If his arms were out, then fair enough. But both are tucked in. Common sense prevails for once.
Bournemouth was robbed these decisions is driving me crazy.. I'm not even Bournemouth fan
My guy literally sets up the goal with a volley ball shot 💀
This is Just the matter of refs going who’s bigger
I hope this season can be used as a reform for English referring as a whole, some of the worst decisions I've seen and were only into October.
i love how they pick and chose when the proximity of the hand ball applies haha
Wow. VAR wtf! That is a clear hand ball! What is going on! The premier league is a disgrace
the first goal should be absolutely disallowed. the referee standard is poor in recent matches
3 handball goal for the Spammers, not bad....
Someone explain to me how that goal was given 🤣🤣
As a hammers fan even the first goal should have been ruled out I believe Bournemouth were pretty hard done by that
The first one the guy is playing volleyball his arms are not in a natural position, his gluts push forward and his right leg lifts to steer the ball towards goal. That is an absolute disgrace yet again from var. How they can then give the second is beyond my comprehension the guy had no intention of stopping the ball. I’m a neutral by the way but seriously biased against var at the moment as it’s ruining the game with its corrupt decisions.
Southampton have ruined Bournemouths season watch
As a West Ham fan, I think none of our goals should have stood, VAR IS RUBBISH EVERYONE NOES IT.
Honestly don’t know what the handball rule is nowadays 🤷🏻‍♂️
HOW IS THAT NOT A HANDBALL???
This weekend has had the worst refereeing decisions I’ve ever seen. Shameful
He loves kicking cats! He loves kicking cAAAaaats! Kurt Zouma, he loves kicking cats!
Yep. VAR crap once more although tbf it’s about time WHU had one go in their favour. Or two? Not a hammer btw
For any fans of either team, by the laws every decision was right in this game. Arguably lerma shouldve been red carded tho
It's physically impossible to make a sliding tackle, like the one that lead to the penalty, without changing your upper body shape and the position of your arms. You'd think that VAR's would understand this and be able to differentiate between a deliberate handball and an accidental one. It's getting ridiculous how many penalties are being given for these types of decisions.
2:06 If that went in
West Ham played basketball against Fulham now volleyball!  Bournemouth sawn off by VAR !
Nice that VAR found on our side for once. COYI.
Unintended olympic volley ball pass  Or Before VAR ball to hand maybe
awful var
Two handball goals against Fulham, now one against Bournemouth. West Ham are lucky asf
We were shocking tonight, we tried a new formation and it didn't work plain and simple. Too many backwards passes and 2-0 massively flattered us. Hopefully we improve soon or we will be mid table at best.
As Bournemouth would know “it’s magic”
Glad to see zoumba back on his feet
VAR could be so good if it wasn't used to poorly
even as  a West Ham fan the first goal decision was a shocker!
If VAR doesn’t stop this pathetic horror show, I’m off to Germany where VAR actually gets it right.
Come on hammers
This is the Bournemouth we all know and truly love.
Let be honest. David Moyes has kidnap ever single Referee' wifes because of that Chelsea game.
He assisted with his hands. ?
Payback for the 3-3 draw thanks to Wilson’s hand ball goal a few years back 🙌🏻
I feel bad for Bournemouth 4 handball decisions all of them against them
Superb game of volleyball there
Wow this league is awful! The referees are terrible😭 and as for VAR they give a handball to West Ham but not to Bournemouth😂😂
The inconsistency with var is unbelievable. Liverpool never got exactly the same decision at arsenal a couple weeks ago for the hand ball for the penalty.
i still think asrenal will be top
We got lucky
West hand utd
Zouma
1:14 Watch the hands move TOWARDS the ball. That is blatant handball, not accidental. Disgraceful from VAR to not disallow it.   2:40 It is impossible to not dive in to block a cross and not have your hands out. However these are given nowadays more often so that one being given I can understand. Still angry it is but it's not an incorrect decision.
I hear a job vacancy is coming 😊
how is that a pen
I predict 6th PL finish and semi's Europa for the Hammers
It was a pen hands were in unnatural position
ONLY TOOK 40 MINUETS TO UPLOAD
Forgot volley ball was allowed in football 😂
First
VAR is having a shocker
Suiiiiiii
This league is a disgrace relegate us now
First
