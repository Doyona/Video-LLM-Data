That must’ve been embarrassing
Does anyone know what the films called where theres a scene with mila kunis and she is ripping up paper?
I love Mila.  Ashton is one lucky guy
"I'm gonna pass on that one my friend" 🤣 lmao
Shes got so much class, absolutely loved how she reacted with everyone.
Anyone familiar with charley chase?
What a douche asking for a selfie without a mask.
Mila wont sign the provocative pic but didnt have a problem taking it at the time
Her too Mila...
She is very pretty in nice
random
Guy had the balls to tell her, “Can I get a picture without the mask on.” Smh
Wow she’s so nice
I think her acting has surpassed Natalie Portman.
OMG i love her! Looool
Mila, Megan, and Olivia Wilde. The kinda look alike anyways
I can't change you either
Mila is the best, love her style !!!
This is just sad. I don't get the celebrity worship shit.
Class at 100%
Mila Kunis is a sweetheart
She passed on the sexy one. Why pose that way then?!
I swear some people just ask for autographs and take pictures with celebs just to say they did or sell something. She's so sweet tho. Absolutely love her.
“Are you a Mets fan😐?…”
Who cares
Wonder why she passed on that picture of herself?
She handled that like a pro. What a class act!
Lol Mila is great! Mila is more sexy than fox
I would have said the same thing. You all are beautiful!
Mask sheep.
I love her! Ashton is so lucky
Mila is so much prettier than Megan. Megan messed up her face with surgery. Megan looks eternally morbid.
And that's how you treat people 👏🏼🤍
I like that she didnt wanna sign the sexy photo of her.
Who cares, hug a real MotherEarth tree
That happened in I ♥️ Huckabees too and the models did not even resemble eachother lol.
Really? Wtf cares who she is? I don't even know her... she's not famous everywhere
He must be blind
Still wearing a mask. 😬
so fucking nice.
Damn if someone would have had her sign a Dominoes box that would have been the most hilarious thing.
Ahhh the cost of being famous, I'll take a hard hell No thank you! Ghost writer is as close to being famous as I'd go! 😋
Ew
😃💜💛❤️🔃
what. a. pro.
Who tf wearing a mask in 2022 😂
This looks exhausting
She’s better than Megan fox
Shut up meg
All a bunch of low lives
That looks like an exhausting nightmare.
Imagine having to deal with these "people" every day. I'd lose it.
Why am i even watching this trash
i wouldnt even sign those 😭
woah! she is a total pro at whatever that was! haha, Mila Kunis is a national treasure
If somebody is wearing a mask don't ask them to remove it. It's really fucking rude.
"I'm going to pass on that one" ... why?
autograph hawks are big time losers.
She's super polite.
She seems pretty down to earth.  Cool lady.
oy veeeey
She's a muzzled mask moron, then she complains about people not able to recognize her when her face is covered. Idiot.
Why has she got a mask on
You agree with posing in lingerie for money, but when people ask for an autograph on that specific picture you're gonna pass on that? Hypocrite.
She seems really cool
I couldn't be that nice to this many strangers wanting my attention.  Not even for 1 day.
She's so nice
Queen
