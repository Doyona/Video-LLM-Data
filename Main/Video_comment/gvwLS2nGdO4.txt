Just such lovely children!! So well-mannered I love how they're being taught all the ways of the world today not how it used to be but how it is right now they're an amazing family what an honor it is to witness!! Much love ❤️ and I just have to say how absolutely adorable are all three of them!!!
When we share love in child..
It is important to teach your children such values. Helping others doesn't hurt, but rather fulfils you. Because only by appealing to ourselves to make the planet a better place and passing it on to our children will the planet become a better place.
風邪ひいてしまったからゆっくり休むね😢
Since she is princess of wales, I am hoping she might be able to do something to bring Anglo culture and language and Cymru (Welsh) language and culture together for a better future, I mean considering Brythonic people are the early settlers (natives) to the british isles I would hope we could celebrate this more. In usa the natives seem to get more credit and appreciation as they just built a whole area to celebrate them. Food is still better back in britain though, hoping if donald trump wins he will actually get bad chemicals out of food in usa but probably a lie to win votes since these politicians lately just wanna play gender politics. Going off on one here sorry but yeah even translations of welsh towns to English ones are not done right. I think Great Britain needs to stop being England, Cornwall, Wales and Scotland and start being Great Britain but we can only do that if everyone is celebrated and appreciated.

I Love You The British Royal Family From United Kingdom London 🇬🇧 ♥️🤍💙 🔴⚪🔵 🟥⬜🟦 😀❤️😃😍💖💝 And I Love Prince George , Princess Charlotte , And Prince Louis Of Wales 😀❤️😃😍💖💝
They look so much like my cousins. I guess it feels like adopting them since my uncle decided not to have babies in his marriage.
The royal children are enjoying themselves.
George
What a great experience for those children to help out with this awesome charity. I can only imagine the excitement on the children's faces when they get their gift bags.
Fabulous!  :-).  Well done maam 🙂

2人はご褒美とか考えたことある？小さな事で言えば宿題が終わったらお菓子を食べよう🍪って🤤そういう考え。私は社会に出るまで自分にご褒美をあげるって考えてこなくてお小遣い制でもなかったしお菓子は家にあったからかな？でも今思えば期末テストが終わったら夕飯はこんな料理を食べたいとか言って見たかったな？😊今みたいになんでも調べて買うみたいじゃないし、なんだか私の思春期の頃はテレビがおもしろくってそんなにストイックじゃなかったのかな？勉強しなさいとかも言われなくて耳をすませばの雫ちゃんが親が何も言わないのも寂しいものだよって祐子ちゃんに言ってたのいつも共感する🥰🩵🩵
🇬🇧👑️👑️👀🧚‍♂️🥰🎠🐘🐘🐘🐘❤

Have you try the DIY? I often watch my sns  forginers change the wallpaper by myself! Wallpaper is cute flowers or cute colors! Almost Japanese use white wallpaper! So I am surprised that. You can change wallpaper! DlY is not popular in Japan! Japan is popular how to store!😊🍙 I want to watch the store to sell the wallpaper 🌷🌸🐹
How is the weather in London? In Shizuoka cherry blossoms are blooming later than usual! It’s hot this year. You go to the private school 😊Is it busy to study? Do you enjoy school?

Do you like candy? sweet? I prefer eat somthing rice eggs meat as snack. If you like me, I try to make onigirazu. I hear the are poplar abroad.
Kate❤❤❤❤❤
постановка в студии, неужели не видно этого
Kate is not a Real Princess !. She is an ordinary person like any of us. Ann, Eugene, and Beatrice are real princesses !
Amo ed ammiro molto questa Famiglia Reale che cerca di condurre una vita più normale possibile e più vicina alla gente comune. Spero tanto che Kate superi in fretta questo difficile periodo e che possa ritornare a dedicarsi alla Sua meravigliosa famiglia, al Suo Popolo ed alle persone nel mondo che Le vogliono bene....Forza Proncipessa Kate....❤
Donde estaran esas criaturas!que dios los proteja❤
Miluji Ketrin i keji rodinu 👑👍👏🌞🙂🙏😇🌺🇨🇿💯🌹
🎊🌹🌷🎈🎉👍❤️🇹🇼
Te dzieciaki to dobrze wychowywane w tym próżnym świecie brawo 😊❤
A good lection to learn
Thank you so very much for calling her Catherine Princess of Wales !🙏🏽🌸🌎
Please sleep a lot, you feel satisfy!!😊Today I eat shurinp fly. I want to you try japanese shurinp🍤fly.George would like it🩵
The kids obviously more comfortable without Charles, especially Geroge.
Rewatching this after the big announcement.
Hahaha mga obsessed makita ako lmaof🫁🤳
2人はどんな時が1番楽しい？私はやっぱり小さい頃も今も旅行とかが好きかなぁ？日本人の国内旅行ってその土地にある特産物を旅館で食べて静岡だったらお刺身とか海のものが多くてそれから温泉♨️に入って小さい頃は肌がむけるまで海水浴をしたよ😊懐かしいな❣️2人に会えないのは今はすごく寂しい😔けど家族で沢山これから楽しいことしたいな😃🌊ジョージ王子は太陽のように明るくてルイ王子はさくら🌸みたいに少し儚げなイメージがあるよ私がお母さんだもん❣️きっと合ってる❣️
今日は12時まで寝ちゃった😅自分でもびっくり🫢ジョージ王子もルイ王子も学食でお昼食べてるのかな？😊お弁当文化ってないと思うけどお弁当って沢山お母さんとの思い出があるよ🎉例えばアルミホイルで包んだおにぎりは冷たくても美味しく感じたりお母さんに🐙タコさんウィンナーにして欲しいってお願いしたり✨幼稚園の頃はお弁当を暖房器具？で温めたのを食べたりとっても大切な思い出🩵🩷ピクニックに行く時はお弁当🍱🍙作ってあげるね！約束😋
Sifat dari ketiga anaknya sudah kelihatan,, george like mother lebih tenang dan tidak banyak bicara, Charlotte like father periang, dia aktif sedangkan terahir louis ini saya kurang tau karena dia pemalu mungkin sifatnya dari kedua orang tuanya baik ayah atau ibu....this family so beautifull
今日は日本は祝日だったよ㊗️デパートで買ったプリン🍮を食べて小さな幸せ😊たまに贅沢なものを食べるとすごく幸せな気分にならない？男の子は違うのかなぁ？ 2人とも輪郭だけ私に似ていて私の輪郭って遺伝子強くてびっくり🥴🫢きっと成長してくたびにお父さんに似てくるね✨
何か嫌なことがあったら自分の心の中に隠さないでちゃんと今はお父さんとかいいやすい人に伝えてほしい。納得できなかったら何回も相談してほしいし他の違う人にきちんと話してほしいって思ってるよ！私は両親に負担になってしまうと思って学校であった嫌なことを相談できなくて随分と損な人生になってしまったと思う時があるよ！親や大人に嫌な気持ちをきちんと言える勇気を持ってほしい絶対に。自分で自分を守らなきゃ！！
They are all wearing these same clothes as the “Mother’s Day” photo. Went out of their way to change the colors in the photo but the same exact clothes!!
また明日のお昼頃ラインするね😊
どんなに自分にとって辛い状況のなかにいても人に優しくできることってできるのかな？きっとできている時もあれば辛いから人に当たりたいって思ってしまう状況もあるよね😊でも人に言っていいことと悪いことってあるでしょ？人を傷つけたらお母さん悲しいな😭💔 2人の髪色がとっても個性的に見えて同じ兄弟でも全く違う人というところがわかって私も育児に参加したらきっと2人の髪色を見て違う個性を持った2人だから👦って考えて精一杯育児をしたいな🎵雰囲気も顔立ちもそっくりな2人がどんな青年になっていくか寂しいけど楽しみだよ😊きっとお父さんみたいに海外に行ってしまいそう🤭
What a lovely family. I hope Catherine is okay.
私は子供の頃大人にウソをつくときが心の限界だったバロメーターかもしれない😊大人って2人からしたらどんな存在？私は時代もあってかすごく怖いというか近づきがたい存在感があったなって思う🤭でも自分の体が大人に近付いていく年齢になったことで段々大人の人と話せるようになってきたな☺️今日は沢山英語を勉強したけど2人と早く話せるようになれるよう頑張ります👍
甜心術後 保重身體多加休養 雖在皇室家庭 但你是有智慧女性 相信你們會處理好一切  健康快樂永遠是首要的(無論何人) 😘😘 💙Home sweet👦👫👧🧒home💙💍                                                   十      🖐                                       (你對戴安娜奶奶的愛)
Am so appaled at what has been thrown at Catherine, the Princess of Wales, lately. No one is owed her private information and she is definitely deserving of time off for her health and well-being, just like anyone else. Am not much of a fan of anything, but somehow felt the need to express my (insignificant) sympathies to her. She certainly doesn't deserve the things she had to endure and has to again. The press are maggots and only the unhappy ones are lapping it up.  For what it is worth, am wishing all the best to Catherine and the rest of the BRF. 🌹🍀
今日は街へ出てショッピング🛍️と映画のフライを見たよ😊フライはもうイギリスでは公開されたかな？家族の中のお兄さん鳥🦆がとっても勇敢でジョージ王子を思い出してみていたよ！お父さん鳥も根は臆病な鳥🦆なんだけど鳥1番家族を守る気持ちが強くてウィリアム王子、お父さんを思い出しながら観ていたよ🤭でも男性の弱いところも女性にとっては魅力的な部分に映るよ🩵🩷きっと家族だから許せちゃう部分もあるよね🎉みんな魅力的だね🥴
今日はバルト三国のエストニア？よくわからないけどYouTubeで見てカラフルな建物とかすごいいいなぁ魅力的だなぁって😊みんなで行ってみたいな🎵日本から今ヨーロッパに行ける人って限られた人だと思うけど両親とも行ってみたいなぁって🤭父が3月で定年退職するから旅行行きたいねって話してる😉
子どもはぜったい渡さないから。触れないで！！！
私の画面から現れないでほしい。デリカシーのかけらもない？
2人はどんな香りが好き？小さい頃はお母さんが晴れの日に干してくれたふっかふかの布団が大好きだったな🤔そういう時はいつもより寝やすかったな😊子供の頃に戻りたい✨
Please make this video go viral.
Hey look, almost the same clothes they're wearing in the now infamous Mother's Day photo, just through a color filter.
She looks so exhausted and unwell . I hope she’s ok
Anyone else here to see the clothes matching up with the Mother’s Day photo? 😅
Who's here after the Mother's day photo debacle?
they are all dressed the same as in the famous photo of Kate with the kids. so you won't be surprised: a white turtleneck sweater is very easy to change into a blue one. why?
Where tf is Kate 😂
今日はなんだか疲れてしまったからおやすみ⭐😴😊
Wearing veeeeery similar clothes to the mother's day photos in this video. Going to go grab my tin foil hat. Brb
Dear Princess Kate  It's obvious something serious has happened to you recently and both your loving family and the British press are 'circling the wagons' to protect you.  Please take all the time you need to heal and be away from the nastiness of social media and be around your beautiful children that love you very much.  I wish you nothing but the best.
How are you  Take care from the heart.. Mom & 3 babies ❤GoodDay& GoodNight & GoodLuck. Have a goodDream's
I go shopping to the city. I ate Japanese cake called dorayaki😊 it’s in sakura mochi. There are a lot of sakura products in Japan!! Oh It’s Louis season now 😊I have been thinking about George and Louis!!!! I never forget that. I will watch the baseball game and basketball game tomorrow. What is your most favorite sports?🤭🥰
I am thinking about Milton. This is called Japanese. I don’t know how to spell in English. I want to make miton for your father. This is my late goal. I love him and you! What is your goal? I want to know what your goals are. I wanted to make your baby clothes! You are so sweet and cute when you’re babies!!!
ジョージ王子とルイ王子はどんな学校を選んでいくのかな？男子校だったり女子校だったり。お父さんは男子校ばかりだったみたいだし、弟できっと思春期の女の子がどんな感じかわからないんじゃないかな？違う学校を選んでも楽しいかもね😃 お父さんは学校の話聞かせてくれる？昔は寄宿舎なんて😢厳しく育てられたのかな？
松田聖子さんってアイドル知ってる？私が生まれる前くらいにデビューしたのかな？私の母くらいの年なんだけど。その歌がすごく3人にマッチしてて！青い珊瑚礁がジョージ王子、チェリーブロッサムがルイ王子、赤いスイートピーがお父さんへの歌！！🩵どんな歌詞か細かくはわからないけど曲調も3人にピッタリだと思って🤭もしよかったら聞いてみて😊日本のトップアイドルだよ😊 息しててね💨
They are awesome
ずーっと女の子の名前ばかり考えてたから男の子ってこんなに愛おしい存在なんだぁ🥰って思ってるよ😊生まれ変わってもジョージ王子とルイちゃんを産みたい！！2人とも比べられないくらいかわいいし😍会えた時にずーっと抱っこしていたい😊いつかはお嫁さんの元へ行ってしまうの…すごく寂しいけどジョージ王子とルイちゃんが幸せなら嬉しい😆
私の親は小さい頃喧嘩ばかりしてたよ。とっても悲しくて😭でもまだ子供の頃ってそれを誰かに相談しようとか友達のお家は喧嘩したりするのか聞く力がなくって。すごく悲しい思いで毎日過ごしてたの。きっとジョージ王子やルイちゃんの友達にも家族のことで悩んでてでもお友達には相談したくないなって気持ちの子もいると思うよ。いっぱいいっぱい悲しいけどやっぱり友達にお母さんやお父さんのこんなところが嫌とか嫌いとか絶対誰しもあるでしょ？100%幸せな家族ってすごーく難しいけどそれは子どもにとって。でも親からしたら子どもが毎日息をしてくれてるだけで100%幸せ😊😊ジョージ王子もルイちゃんも今は辛い思いをさせてしまってごめんね。きっと大きくなれば大人を許すことはなくても納得できる日が来てくれればいいな。
昨日考えたら私はやっぱり金曜日の夜が1番ワクワクしてるかなぁって思ったよ😊 日本はどんどん暖かくなってるよ🌻 今日はすごくお腹が空いて私もパスタ大好き！！！ビーツのポテトサラダが大好き！！！味覚が似てるなんて面白いね🤣うれしい😆💖
2人は学校に通ってるでしょ？😊何曜日が好き？私はきっと金曜日が1番嬉しいかったんじゃないかな？今となっては思い出せないけど😂やっぱりカリキュラムによるのかな？学校じゃなくても給食に何がでるとかかなぁ？
If I say Kate is beautiful does it hurt to prince
明日はお雛様🎎を出す予定だよ😊女の子が幸せに生きていけるように赤ちゃんの時に買うものだよ☺️そうやってずーっと親って子供の幸せをいつもずっと祈ってる。私もジョージ王子とルイちゃんが苦労なんてしないでずーっと幸せに生きていってほしいなって思ってるよ😊
The real Princess ❤❤❤
お父さんがミッフィと同じ誕生日🎂って知ってた？🤭日本人は大人になってもキャラクターのものを持ち歩いて外出するのは当たり前だから日本ではミッフィ大人気だよ😊🐰お父さんがミッフィと同じ誕生日なんて日本人はあまり知らないんじゃないかな？世界的に人気なキャラクターと同じ誕生日なんてなんだか羨ましいな🎵日本でもジューンブライドは多分今でも人気なんじゃないかな？日本は梅雨の時期☂️だけどきっとイギリスはすごくいい季節にお父さん産まれたんだなって。✨おばあちゃんまだ若かったのに病気のなかよく産んで大変だったんじゃないかなって。お父さんとってもいい季節に生まれてきてくれたんだね🩵🥰
2人はお父さんみたいになりたい？きっとこれからどんどん大きくなってお父さんそっくりになってくれると嬉しいな🎵人はみな悲しみを背負って生きてるんだって。でもその悲しみって小さいほど気持ちが楽だし家族みんな揃ったらきっと1人で悲しみを背負わなくてもみんなで協力して悲しみを背負って生きていきたいな😊家族仲良く暮らせるようになりますように🐢😆✨
男の子は学校でどんな話をするんだろう？🤭会えたら学校終わったら嬉しかったことや悲しかったこと話してもらえると嬉しいなぁ☺️できたらだけど🎵それでジョージ王子とルイちゃんのことたくさん知りたいな🩵🩷2人は宝物✨
Genuine good kind hearted princess if wales who is instilling decent values in her children and it shows , just wonderful, god bless them all, Catherine you are loved beyond measure we all respect love and adore you and truly deeply appreciate everything you do for us , take all the time you need  to heal, as much as you missed  we all want what is best for you and your family god bless 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤❤❤❤❤
今日はお花を買いに行ったよ😊あおい花にしてみたよ😆ウィリアム王子とジョージ王子をイメージして🎉ルイちゃんのイメージした花は芝桜っていう品種があったけどどうやって育てるの😱って思って😊ルイちゃんは芝桜のイメージじゃないな😅青から水色のお花ってとっても爽やかだしキレイなイメージで2人にピッタリ❣️❣️きっとルイちゃんも男の子らしくなっていくんだね😊ジョージ王子もきっと爽やかな男性になっていくね✨✨
👍🙃👑👑👑👍
🌷🌷
明日はお母さんとバス旅行に行くよ😊ルイちゃんは誕生日プレゼント何もらうのかな？ゲームとかしてるならゲームかなぁ？海外のYouTuberのお母さんは年頃の子には現金って言ってたからジョージ王子も現金なのかな？自分がどういうものにどれくらいお金をかけるか考えるためにも男の子なら現金もいいなぁって思ったよ☺️絶対女の子の赤ちゃん👶が欲しいって思ってたけど男の子ってこんなにかわいいんだぁっていつも思ってるよ🎉
This is so sweet 😊
私が学生時代に後悔してることはボランティアをしなかったこと😊毎日の生活に精一杯だったけどボランティアしておけばよかったなぁって思ってるよ😉きっと勉強やスポーツや友達関係で楽しかったり気が沈んだり…強制しないけど私はやってたら人生変わってたかも知れないって思う💓すくすく育ってくれてありがとう😊毎日幸せに思ってる！
🎉🎉💜💜💜💜💜🎉🎉
❤  👑
私のお爺さんはとっても礼儀にうるさい人で私には厳しくなかったけど姉はいつも怒られてたな😅お爺さんがテレビを見ていると他の番組に変えてほしいなんて言えなかったし言おうとも思わなかったから昔は保護者のことも父兄って言ったり家の中に大人の男の人がいるとその人が第一優先だったけどイギリスはどうなのかな？イギリスといえばレディーファースト文化ってイメージだけどもう古く感じるのかな？日本にレディファーストの文化は全くないよ😊
2人は土日どうやって過ごしてる？😊私は小学校の時は土日でも早く起きちゃうタイプで中学生になるとお昼までずーっと寝てたよ←成長期😅4月からルイちゃんが日本に住んでたら小学校一年生になるとっても素敵な年だったね💓ランドセルを選んだり入学式には家族みんなで桜の木下で写真を撮るの！私は小学校一年生は歌をよく歌っていたよ😉あとは運動会ではちびまるこちゃんの踊りを披露したりしてた😊ジョージ王子はやっぱり昼まで寝てるのかな？男の子ってどんな生活して過ごすんだろう？自分のお腹から男の子が産まれてくるなんて想像したことなかった😆絶対女の子を産む気がしてたのに生命の神秘だね💓
happy valentine😊💕日本の藤枝市は2月と思えないほど暖かくて不思議な感じ😊イギリスは寒いのかな？きっと冬は私が経験したことないほどの寒さになりそう😣イギリス映画といえば！！私にとってはブリジットジョーンズの日記なんだけどあとラブアクチュアリーとか！！若い頃はラブコメが大好きだったんだけど最近は日本では映画を観るのに2000円かかるから←日本人にとって高い イギリスは映画観るのってどれくらいお金を払ってみるんだろう？ジブリって知ってる？最近放映された君たちはどう生きるかって映画とっても素敵だったよ💓若い頃のお母さんに会えるところが羨ましいなぁって😊2人は若い頃の私に会いたいと思う？今よりずっと元気いっぱいで笑ってて毎日楽しいってほどじゃなくても今の私とは全く違うから見せてあげたかったなって😂でももっと母親らしくしないとそんなこと思ってくれないかもね😅
❤ Wonderful Family ! ❤🙂👍
昨日イギリスのお寿司調べたらWASABIってお店が美味しそうに見えたよ😊でも！！！やっぱり日本の高級なお寿司も食べてみてほしいな🎵同じ魚🐟とは思えないほど美味しいよ🤤日本の北海道でニセコって場所が外国人に人気みたい💕日本のテレビで見たよ！北海道行ってみたかったから家族みんなで行きたいね😊スキー⛷️ができるみたいだけど…ニセコなんて場所初めて聞いたからまた調べてみるね🤭行けるかわからないけど夢はいっぱいあったほうがいいよね🎵3人はどこに旅行に行き たいんだろう？みんなで意見出しあって決めたいね！😆
今日の夕飯は回転寿司のお寿司🍣😊最近日本はお寿司がくるくるまわってなくてタッチパネルで注文したものだけまわってくるんだ🤭イギリスもそうかなぁ？私は生の魚だと醤油をべちゃべちゃつけたくなっちゃう！！食べれるけど得意じゃないかなぁ？ウニとイクラが好き💕😊イギリスにもあるのかな？やっぱりサーモンが好きな子ども多いなぁ☺️イギリスにも日本のお寿司屋さんってあるのかな？調べてみるね！キンパっていう韓国の巻き寿司が美味しくって作ってあげたいな😆でも巻き寿司の他のおかずはなんだろう🤔やっぱり子どもがたくさん美味しく食べてるところを見ると親は安心するよね🎉最近は2人がどんなティーンエンジャーになるかなぁって考えてるよ🥰
学校楽しい？楽しくない？ロンドンの学校は多分だけど色んな肌の色の子や髪の色の子がいてそれを見ているだけで自分には自分の個性があるってわかるのかなって？日本は日本人だらけだし肌の色も髪の色もみんなほとんど一緒だしみんなと一緒じゃなきゃって追い込まれる雰囲気があったような気がする😅 色んな肌の色がいて髪の毛の色がいるってとっても素敵なことだと思うよ😊個性を大切にね😉苦手なことも少し頑張ってやることもしてほしいな🎵
Thank you for teaching the future King about truly helping others in a meaningful and hands on way
イギリスって9月入学🏫みたいだけどそれって公立と私立で違うのかなぁ？やっぱり太陽☀️が出ないと生活に支障があるのかな？ 2人ともお父さんの髪色にそっくりだけど少し濃い茶色があって私に似たのかな😊？遺伝子っておもしろいね💕🤣私の頭の悪さは似てほしくないな…やっぱり男の子は頭がいい方がかっこいいもの😉
2人は運動好き？🏃🏃まだ子どもだからたくさん食べてたくさん運動してね💃おじいちゃんのことは残念だけど今はたくさん治療法があるから大丈夫だよ😊昔に比べたらすごい医療って進んでいるから✨
ジョージ王子くんのイメージカラーは水色🩵ウィリアム王子と一緒😊ルイちゃんのイメージカラーはピンク🩷やっぱりまだ赤ちゃん欲しいなぁって思ってもできなくても2人が宝物だから運命を受け入れる😆神さまのみ知る🤭今は学校かな？
ルイちゃんは今年はピンクのケーキ🎂ジョージ王子はやっぱり水色にしよう！黄色と迷ったけどやっぱり水色にするね😊ルイちゃんのピンクはさくらでジョージ王子は空の色をイメージして水色にしてみる💕
こんにちは😊節分って日本の四季が春になる1日前のことで鬼は外福は内って乾燥した大豆をお家の外に投げたり家の中に投げるの👹その大豆を年齢の数だけ食べて厄除けするみたい。私は小さい頃厄除けの意味は知らなかったけどジョージ王子くんの年くらいまで年の数だけ乾燥大豆を食べてたよ🤭結構美味しい😋だからジョージ王子は10粒でルイちゃんは5粒だよ🫘日本は雪国のイメージかな？それともやっぱり暑い🫠イメージ？私の住んでる町の藤枝は雪は降らなくて雪を見てみたいって思うくらい！ロンドンはどうなんだろう？雪が積もるくらい沢山雪が降るのかな？日本は小さいけど日本海と太平洋側？で海の🌊イメージも違うし小さいけど地域によってすごくイメージや特産物が変わるの！きっとイギリスもそうなのかなぁ？ジャガイモ🥔が大好きだからイギリスのジャガイモ食べたいな🎵主食がじゃがいもってお腹空かないのかな？間食が多いのかな？って考えてるよ🥰今3人ともランチ終わりかな✨また何か思いついたら💌するね！！今日本は22時だよ🤩
今日は日本は節分だよ😊👹鬼は外福は内っていうイベント？なんだけどまた調べて💌するね💕 ルイちゃんもうすぐ誕生日になっちゃう😢4月は日本では🌸が咲いて暖かくなってとってもいい季節だよ🤭イギリスにも桜🌸あるのかな？きっとそばにいれたら誕生日ケーキ🎂とプレゼントをラッピングしながら寂しくも健康に育ってくれたルイちゃんに感謝するんだろうなぁって。今は会えなくてもこんなに楽しい毎日が過ごせて本当に心から産まれてきてくれてまだママにはなりれないけど本当に幸せな気持ちにさせてくれてありがとうって思ってるよ🩷🩵自分が産まれてきてよかったぁってようやく思えたよ😊ママにしてくれてありがとう💛💖
日本は今22時半😊いつもより🥱眠い💤おやすみ🥰
2人は土日何してる？ジョージ王子くんくらいになると塾に行ったり部活⚽️やったりするのかな？ルイちゃんくらいだと〜まだまだお友達と遊んだりしてるのかな😊早くみんなと公園とか行ったりスーパーとかお買い物に行ったりしたいなぁ〜🎉どういうことができるのかな？やっぱり家族みんなで過ごせる日ってみんな楽しみにしてるよね😆ジョージ王子くんとルイちゃんのクローン赤ちゃんがほしいと思ってたけどやっぱり2人が1番かわいい🩷🩷🩷
イギリスって授業参観日あるのかな？🤔お母さんが子どもたちの授業を見学に学校へみに行くっていう文化なんだけどもしあるのなら見に行ってみたいなぁって思って😊恥ずかしいよね子どもからしたら🏫 あとはもし日本にくるとしたら何がしたいのかなって！やっぱりポケモンセンターとか？海外にもあるのかな？あとはやっぱり歴史を少しみんなで勉強して京都と奈良に連れていってあげたい🤭私まだお寺と神社の違いがよくわからなくてでもお寺や神社って歴史を知るとすごーく面白く感じるの！！！ヨーロッパにあるお城もきっと観るだけより歴史を知ってから見た方が面白いのかなぁ？島国なのにユーロスターがあるなんてすごく恵まれた地域だよね🥰
2人の好きな教科は何？😊私は図工と家庭科がリラックスして受けられたな🤔あとは社会も好きだった😊たまに先生が中学の時にプロジェクトXっていうNHKで放送されていた番組をクラスのみんなで観る時間がラッキーって思ってた笑🤭すごく面白い印象だったよ！イギリスは何歳まで義務教育なのかな？きっと日本とは違うよね日本は15歳まで義務教育を学校で受けなければならないんだ。そもそも義務教育って言葉イギリスにあるのかな？携帯で調べてみるね🥰
ジョージ王子の身長は私よりもう高そう😭イギリスでは日本のアニメって放送されてるのかな？私は男の子のアニメだったらワンピースが好きだよ🤭ドラゴンボールとかはあんまりわからなかったけど😮 ジョージ王子はサッカーをやっているってYouTubeで見たよ😊サッカー好きなのかな？ルイちゃんは何を好きになるんだろう🤔2人でポロを習う時がくるのかな？馬を操るなんて意味はないけどイギリスらしいなって思ったよ🎉イギリスのスポーツじゃないのかな？
2人は学校行くの楽しい？私は幼稚園も小学校もすごく負担だったし行きたいって思ったことなかったな😊行きなくなくて色々考えて冷蔵庫に入れば風邪ひくかもしれないって✨きっと自分が2人の側に居れたら学校帰る前までにおやつを準備して夕飯を考えたりしてたのかな？日本のお母さんは夕飯何がいい？って子どもに聞いてなんでもいいって答えてお母さんが悩むっていうオチがあってその言葉にもきっとお母さんに甘えている言葉が含まれてるのかなって😊イギリスの男の子はなんて言うんだろう？🤭毎日の献立に悩むのも大変だけど後から振り返ってその時が自分の人生の旬だろうなって。ジョージ王子もルイちゃんも今生きている1日1日を大切にしてね✨😆だけどあんまり大きくならないで😢本当は赤ちゃんに戻ってほしい😊きっと夢のような日々だったって思えるから🎉
2人はどんな動物が好き？私は小さい頃動物番組が大好きだった😱ライオン🦁が他の動物食べたり😱犬なら短足犬が好き🥰シーズーを飼ってたけどもう動物を飼いたいって思わないな😅高校生くらいまでハムスター🐹を飼ってたよ😉
私は2人姉妹の末っ子だからお母さんが男の子を育てているのをみたことがなくってどんな遊びが好きなのかどうやって成長していくのか今から楽しみだし少し不安があるよ🤣2人が赤ちゃんから幼稚園くらいまで何が好きで何が嫌いなのか早く知りたいな🎵抱っこしたかったなぁ😌あのかわいいかわいい頭の匂いをずっと嗅いでいたかった🥰💕
Какие большие внуки у Дианы 😊
日本はもうすぐバレンタインデーが待ってるよ😊日本のバレンタインは昔は唯一女の子が男の子に告白してチョコを渡す習慣があったんだよ💕今はもうそういう雰囲気ではないけど🤭ジョージ王子くんにもルイちゃんにも女の子には優しくしてあげてね✨大人になったら女の子も守る強い男の子になってね😊イギリスのバレンタインはどんな感じなのかな？イギリスの冬はすごい寒そう⛄️暖かくしてね🥰
GOD bless you always prince and princess 💖and your whole family 🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️
Very good future king and queen❤
今日はルイちゃんの好きなビーツでサンドイッチとコンソメスープを作ったよ😊サンドイッチ美味しかった💕ジョージ王子くんのカルボナーラがまだ作れなくて焦ってる笑🤭主婦になったことがないからまだ試行錯誤だよ😅家族みんなで色んな料理食べに行きたいね✈️日本料理もたくさん食べてほしいな☺️私もパスタが好きだからイタリアのパスタとピザ食べてみたいな🤤
日本のチーズは匂わないのに海外産のチーズは気持ち悪くなるほど乳臭くてびっくり😱したよ。🐮 日本は便利用品沢山あるんだよ🍝日本人は便利なのが好きみたい😊 明日はビーツをちょっと生で挑戦してみるね🥔
As an American, I can only imagine how proud the late Queen would have been of both your Royal Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and instilling in your children your values and incredible work ethic.  You have both given so selflessly of your time to the causes so close to your hearts.   We loved the late Queen and also will never forget the lovely late Diana, Princess of Wales.  We will never forget her compassion and her hard work for her many charities, especially the children, she loved so much.  She would be so proud of you, Prince William!    We Americans have so much respect and admiration for both of you for standing so strong in the face of the relentless, unfair attacks.  Sending Princess Catherine best wishes for a speedy recovery.   Much love to all the Royal Family from Houston, Texas!!!
私いくら嫌なあだ名つけられても誕生日ゴミの日なんて言う事しないのに😭
ジョージ王子くんは画面に出たらもっとかっこつけなきゃ✨
ルイちゃん咳😷治るよ💕
very sweet but 大個女‘要有儀態’不要在公眾場所俏皮
ジョージ王子くんの赤ちゃんの頃の動画かわいすぎて笑っちゃう🤭
Princess Catherine was born to be a queen she's an amazing mother too
たくさん遊んでたくさん食べてすくすく育ってね。風邪🤧ひかないでね。

I love Princess Catherine as a whole ❤
💙💙💙💟💟💟🤍🤍🤍
to me in consideration it was like a tightly controlled expeiment of some way but not educationg morals straight.
well..  I am happy with various things.. but   its not like there is too much progress  and it is to think about how wealthy i wanna live? artistic progress is lacks.  children as young as 4-5 would know the word love.. and the fact how much they have or not.
yeah.. the problem is that it would be there at the post where the passport would be checked with a machine produced..  and however it is proudced with a machienlike or if it has any writing on it.. at the guardhouse.. where a camouflage soldier there is.. or more  so then those soldiers never see such pamflet narrow film implants put onto their braintissue that is. me neither but meh.  alright.. then.. however they are shown that they don't see that.. by youthfullnes there   and on the other end too.. arriving to the border.. through young.. and leaving through young.  which is like.. don't hire young.. or if so.. then  just have young placed somewhere.. but at border it is visible.. that young maybe  and have to do something.. but not with pamflets. just viewing..  in theory.  but if viewing and then only doing pamflets.. its like.. the country from Hungary was not suspicious not walking inside or anything?  it is already a threat.. so it is some threathening.. and then.. hungary is not suspicious to me?  so yeah..  the idea would be to consider more liver degradation of these faux or makeshift motorcycle gangsterlike nobodies accross the border.. so yeah..

Buongiorno ❤😊
❤ yes!!! Now that is so sweet.

Sbaglio o dietro a kate mi pare di avere visto chiara ferragni che impacchettava i pandori per i senza tetto?
Royal kids are given the lessons from their childhood .. so nice to see them blossoming into great characters with so much compassion. Hats off to the royal parents , price william and princess kate ❤
Princess Diana showed her kids very good examples of charity work, duties, tried to do what’s right, glad to see younger parents raising their kids right, in such tumultuous times!
Children are dying in Gaza
I love that George wants to come back!! And Charlotte laughing at the little baby outfit and Louis calling that toy a "big guy' shows all three of these kids have intelligence, wit, compassion and love from having such amazing parents and close bond with all their grandparents and cousins!! Sweet
Prince George looks so mature, maybe because he's the oldest between his siblings, God, time flies so fast I feel like yesterday I just watch his parents getting married at television
Well done, Catherine. Excellent job involving the kids. I am very glad you and William found a method that works for you.. and it works because your beautiful, well mannered and happy children are a testament to you both. God bless and keep you all ❤

I love this royal family.
So lovely 🥰
Love this woman and her children 🥰👏
So much abubdance in UK. Our poor children never get to even see any of it. The British looted us Indians and are now spending on themselves and their Commonwealth Realm as Charity.
Cate is channeling Diana,by having the kids become volunteers,to get the kids in there to pick out and pack gift bags.   Just as Diana did with her two boys,she took them to places where everyone else goes in public! The Wales are a wonderful young family,that know how to give back.
🎉🎉🎉
I wish we’d see more of this content from them.
🦍❤🎉😊

This is so precious. Thanks for sharing.  Lovely family. You're lucky in the UK to have respectable royal leaders to emulate.

Half-brothers fighting Ishmael and Isaac (Issac is of the Jews Israel and Ishmael is of the Moslems the Arab nations). All the other mostly Western nations who profits from oil and desire to gain contol of Israel because of its Spiritual importance will encourage war over peace.
サンタ🎅さん来てくれるといいね✨✨何をもらうのかな？ 日本は今クリスマスイブの朝です。😊今からマリア様をきれいにしてお祈りをします。
this is beautiful  what a mother !
i love this family❤
I'm fairly certain if William and Katherine had been on the throne in 1776, we Americans would have had absolutely no reason for the American Revolution.  😊❤🎉
Such a good way to help others and to also give back. This is very good character building for children. ❤Merry Christmas to the Wales!
They volunteered without the prying eyes of the world. It looked like they did this either early in the morning and or late in the evening.  It's hard.  They are so well behaved.  I wish them all the best.
We love you Princess Catherine your children are as caring as you and Prince William 🇬🇧💕🇬🇧
Super love the Wales Family. ❤
all the good thing Harry and Meghan could've done, but no. we need to do a netflix special and a podcast.      the work of the Princess and Prince of Wales is infinitly more worth than anything those other 2 could ever dream to accomplish!
やっぱりジョージ王子くんには美術頑張ってほしいな😊どこの学校でも🏫
Think about Palestinian children as well. Speak and take a stand for them also.
We are so proud of Princess Catherine. She's doing such a wonderful job with her children, keeping their feet on the ground, also, and putting them in touch with the wider real world outside royalty. Kate is doing a marvellous job, aswell, of fulfilling the role of our future Queen. That's a difficult job under such global  spotlight. Our family are so proud of our beautiful,intelligent, compassionate Princess of Wales. A solid person, human,  wife and mum.❤
It’s makes happier all over the world those who generous enough to less beneficial babies, but our country has not such process to poorer children, they are suffering whole lives. No one cares
Super
Zakat for Santa 🎅 claus ❤ 2024
William chose well…….❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ It doesn’t get any better than this.
She is showing them the right way.  Beautiful!
i love this family so much~
Apparently fans of H&M are saying the children are being exploited 🙄 no clue. Diana took the boys to volunteer programmes to help them see the world outside of their bubble, educate them and get them involved. This is no different. Wonderful to see and well done 👍
Gdzie surogata tych bękartów
Charlotte has Diana's face 😭🤍
Love their compassion. I just love them.
Love this clip. Thank you for normalizing the help. :)
👍❤️🇫🇴✌️🦋🦋🦋🐾🤗
These children r so humble and that’s thanks to their great parenting . Catherine and William are awesome hands on parents . Diana would be so PROUD of William and of course Catherine .
❤
William and Kate are my favourite
No one word about the war boring people
Wonderful ❤
Very sweet. On an unrelated note, I’m always curious what George’s personality is like. Outwardly he appears the most shy or serious of the three. I wonder what’s going on in his mind. Does he bear the weight of his future? I’m sure he’s well loved but I wonder what he thinks of his life.
So beautiful seeing the children helping others.  Love this video!  I’m an American and I love the British Royal Family…especially the Wales family.
This is so lovely. Wish I could volunteer myself
❤
❤❤❤
I love her she's my favorite Princess along with Princess Dianna
Deberian ir a los barrios y dormir al menos un mes pa q vean q una bolsita y ese poco trabajo no es nada ❤

hmmmm
The real working Royals are so giving of their time. It's nice to see Princess Catherine teaching her children to do the same. The young Royals were so well behaved and genuinely helped. They did not make it about themselves. Very touching and needed during this time of year. Great job!
They are doing wonderful work!!❤️
The Prince so adorable, emotional intelegent like his mommy, his leadership such his grandpa, his itellegent such his grandma, his wife so lovely like his mommy, it's new hope for world peace future modern diplomatic
Prince and Princesses on duty of" Christmas is for giving"  Huge ...huge.. respect! The way they carry those gifts is melting my heart!
Beautiful to see what global leaders the Wales family is and how Princess Catherine sets a wonderful example for her lovely children by involving them in her work.
Well done Charlotte for recognising the Welsh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 baby vest.
They are a great family. Catherine gets family. As an American she inspires us too to be truly hands-on charitable. 😊
Great work❤
Magnificent family.

His grandmother Diana would have been very proud of her son's wife, and happy with her grandchildren.
The kids are lovely and the Wales Family had such warm hearts bless them.
Diana would be proud ❤
😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖
Thank You For Sharing Princess Royal :) Lessons in Character Are Important For Royals. Granted.  Impressive in These Times Where Giving Seems So Important Especially The Kindness of Gifts for Christmas. Sincerely, Sir Graxus.
Precius Kate ❤ amazing
Kate and Guillermo I love ypu forever ...saludos of PERU 🇵🇪
You are fabulous! No bs! You are speaking from the heart!
Girl stop u r nothing
Why don't they send humanitarian aid to Gaza?
I hope Palestine child happy too
Parents ALWAYS ALWAYS play a vital role on the outcome of their children. ALWAYS ALWAYS teach your children well.
It's good to know we live in a country that pays for a royal family but won't pay families fair wages or to lower the cost of living so that we don't need baby banks, or food banks, or warm banks, I mean what's next? Clean water banks? Medicine banks? How much more are this government going to bleed us dry?
This is beautiful. When I was young my mother and I would go to our local retailer and choose a family in need and buy them all Christmas gifts. That feeling has stuck with me my entire life. Giving back during the holidays is such a lovely thing🎄♥️
❤❤❤❤
I am not simply impressed that these kids are willing to do such good work with their Mom. I am shocked that 3 young royals even know how to fold clothes. William and Kate, you are doing a magnificent job with your children. Good on both of you, for keeping things as real for them as is possible in your positions and situation. I wish you all the Happiest and Merriest Christmas and a safe, healthy and joyous New Year.
Wow we need caring people in the usa like this
William and Catherine have done a fantastic job with their children!  I have so much respect for them. Keep up the GOOD work!  Much love from the US!!!
She'll never live up to Princess Diana, she's uncopyable.
Aww Priness Charlotte looks so much like her late nanny, Quuen Elizabeth. Cant ever imagine or seeing Harry and his wife and children (if they exist) doing this.
They have grown up so fast , wonderful showing them it is better to give, than receive- to remember the less fortunate  during holidays & how to be thankful for what you have - counting your blessings with your family
This made me cry. You are raising their children the exact way that Diana raised her children -- as real people, not just royals. You are the least royal of all the royals, which is why people love you, and you are amazing parents who love their children and actually spend quality time with them. I'll bet you when William is king, his kids won't have to make an appointment to see him like Charles did. I love Queen Elizabeth, but she put country before all -- even her children -- and that's why they are so messed up now.
These children are impeccably behaved thank you for sharing hope more people will consider helping bank banks
🥹 so precious. Well done all ❤
Diana would be SO proud!
❤ a wonderful example x
One day the recipients may say "A Prince or Princess" picked this just for ME!  GOD BLESS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESUS❤❤❤❤❤
Proud the family of princes of walles so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
The parents are fully aligned in their roles and responsibilities, which in turns resonates with their children. It's so very clear.
What a wonderful video. Princess Catherine is definitely living up to her late mother-in-law's actions. She seems to have taken all the good bits to heart and is inculcating a sense of giving and duty in all her children. She seems to treat them according to their individual characters and doesnt seem to "treat them all the same"....which imo would be a huge mistake. The same mistake Diana made. You have my respect and admiration Princess Catherine. It cant be easy being a wife to the future king as well as the mother to another heir to the throne. God bless you all and the work you do. Wishing all here a VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS 🎄. 🩷From Bombay 🇮🇳
Oh ! Can not belive before l see  Thank you Father Son and The Holy Spirit  solie deo gloria
Gotta love this woman! She’s the epitome of class and also has a warm heart👑❤️🙏🏻
They mute any negative comments
Free Palestine. Children in Gaza deserve to live the life that you enjoyed!
❤❤❤❤❤
Wonderful to see the privileged mingling cheerfully with the downtrodden.  So heartwarming.
Louis has really grown up and matured!
“George wants to come back “ 🥹
What well-behaved children, and kudos to the Princess of Wales for teaching her children from such a young age, how important it is to give back to others less fortunate. ❤️
Kate Duchess do little should stop copying  Duchess Meghan and come come up with some ideas of her own.  Kate and William no longer have Harry to hang on to so they could   shine in his glory.
بصحة وراحة
Catherine said many months ago during a visit to the this charity she would bring the children back and here she is with them, a woman of her word. So rare these days. William seems to keep his word as well. So a great example  Happy Holidays! Merry Christmas! Feliz Navidad! Bom Natal! Joyeux  Noel! To all and may we have peace ☮️ this year around 🌎 world, not fighting or strife…❤
C’est un superbe exemple ! Bien que Royales , les enfants apprennent que tous , n’ont pas cette chance d’être nantis …👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
🥰✌🏽💐.
💕 lovely Princess Catherine with her children !!! ❤
What a beautiful thing to teach them
Wow you’re children are amazing it must be hard to be under the spot light but going out and helping others in need is amazing wow thank u

Just amazing parenting.
love everything about it🙌🌲❤️
These babes are growing up too quickly! It seems like yesterday we were waiting on gestations...❤
God bless you all and merry Christmas to you . The children are doing you proud.
George doesn't have a personality. Let Charlotte be queen.
Beautiful❤🎉❤
Love them and my Louis ❤
This is so lovely! I don't have children of my own but I'm so proud of all three of them. Their parents taught them so well ❤
What about the children in Gaza???
Allow them to stay at Buckingham Palace; taxpayers cover the expenses, so let the underprivileged children have the opportunity to spend the night there
Beautiful,!! Special mom and children and father  too. Good example grazie for your normality.
Initiatives are fun. Aren’t they Kathy?
Consistently genuine, and everyone knows this about Catherine.
So so cute of the kids to do this.❤
Beautiful to see. Their grandmother would be so proud of them ❤
Do you know I would much rather you spoke out about how badly this country is being run, what has gone wrong that baby banks and food banks are even necessary. We look like a third world country.
Our sweetheart  Prince Louis was and is a total sweetheart! I bet the bags he filled will be wonderful if he added his special  touches.
Perhaps we wouldn’t have to have this kind of thing if we didn’t have to pay for the royal family’ extravagant life style. This kind of thing makes me furious.
Love this👍
Makes me cry thinking of those at Christmas who are suffering - all year. The princess and her children are amazing bring this wonderful initiative of angels to our attn.
I wish a have long life to see coronation of king William and queen kate of Great Britain 🙏🏼
👍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
So happy to see that they’re following the way Diana knew kids should be raised.
Sweet kids. How long do they stay for these engagements.
God bless this family 🙏 they are a very humble family ❤
Uhh!  How proud would Diana be to see this!!!!! This is her and Williams legacy not the Royals. I think she would be so proud of the way Catherine has stepped into her shoes without missing a beat. She has followed Dianas example so well. I know I'm proud of her.    Diana had to forge her way in secret alot of the time but, she never gave up and  now Catherine can publicly show the world in her own way and her own time and I think it's beautiful.  Dianas memory lives on in those children. Finally, the work she so faithfully did  pays off. I just wish she could have lived to see it.  Diana won!
Oh my, they are growing like Topsy... look like they enjoyed doing charity work! I made sure both of my sons gave back. It made them well rounded and aware of others' needs.
I want to cry, your mother-in-law the late Princess of Wales would be so proud of your family! Prince William was blessed to find someone like Princess Catherine to carry on her dreams.
Why don’t they share their millions with kids living in poverty?
HRH Princess Catherine is so beautiful inside and out 🌹...and her children are just like her. It is so wonderful to see😍🤩🙏👑. Also, the volunteers there are great. What a wonderful cause❤.
One conflict diamond in Katie’s crown could fix so many of these problems she’s building foundations for.
Teaching her children to give back. Great Mum. And Diana would be proud of them all. Well done!❤
Much ❤ from the  USA!  I absolutely adore Princess Katherine!
This is really heartwarming.
I live in Prince Edward Island. It was sad when the queen died. But it's sad what Harry and his wife are doing to this women. She is not racist.   I don't want my future Queen to be considered that.  Harry and his wife need to lose their titles. That is what the people want.  I cant see a future for the Royals if they dont fix this and drop them losers for good.
真實❤甜蜜💕🏠😊
What a beautiful family. God bless them for their love and charity.
❤❤❤❤ so beautiful God Bless
I could have only ever imagined being as good of a parent that Catherine is. She is truly inspiring!  ❤️ ❤❤❤
I love princess of Wales❤❤
O lovely to see them working, working🎉 Prince Louis frumbling some clothing..😂well, he knows it should be 'packed' in the bag🎉 !
Elegant, caring, down to earth, humble and all things brilliant is she, The Princess of Wales.
Prince George has a gorgeous hair
I was so impressed by the children! They were so focused, helpful, and interested. It was lovely to see!
Such a great mom ,teaching her children a liason
❤❤❤❤..helping hands really can change someone life
👏👏🙏🙏❤️❤️
They should donate at least half, if not all, of their property to the poor and needy.
Princess Diana is smiling❤❤❤
I'm so glad she is showing her children the gift of helping and giving . ❤
According to Telegraph, princess Anne conducted 457 engagements in 2023. Whereas Kate had 128 engagements only. However, Kate receives much more exposure than Anne, who's actually doing the job.
The Best video
Redistribute the wealth. Starting with the Windsor's illgotten pile🤔🤔
Katie working her fingers to the bone as usual
Instilling a sense of community in her young children is amazing, wish many more parents did the same! Showing her children how giving your time to organisations is so important! Compassion, empathy & integrity. Kindness matters. Our late QEII would be so proud of her great grandchildren ❤Always donating too. ❤
Kate is so down to earth and the kids are much like their parents. All 3 children seemed so very keen to do well
Thanks to Catherine & your adorable treasures for shining a spotlight on this amazing initiative! You guys rock ❤ Our future Queen 💜🥀George wants to go back, God love him ❤
We Chinese living & working in UK, just love the British Monarchy and it's thousand years of history ❤❤❤❤ The Young Royals are too cute 😅😅😅
George has William's Mannerisms and Charolette has Kate's.
Such a phony. Not impressed by propoganda
kate is so pretty
Ils débarquent avec leur lange rover de luxe pour fouiller les vieux chiffons 5 minutes devant les caméras? Ils auraient dû offrir aux les vêtements de luxe que leurs enfants ne portent plus
American here. God bless you for always doing the right things with class.
How awesome
This is lovely!
Those children know how to fold clothes.   Bet Mummy makes them fold and put away their own children.
Catherine, your doing a great job👍
Kate Middleton is one of the fallen angels/ demons that got kick out from heaven for their rebellion. A lot of them are in this generation ( celebrities, politicians, scientists) Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon🙏🏼❤️🕊REPENT, believe in the Gospel, Be Born Again
Bet most of these clothes will go to nonwhites, but yet they will continue hating whites. A good reason why not to help them.
Beautiful family....i think theyre awesome ❤
Very good initiative.
This is the kind of thing Princess Diana  would be excited about 😊 Teaching her Grandchildren to understand the world outside their own privileged life x
Pretending to be normal people
Kate is really one of my favourites, she's warm, down to earth and just a wonderful person ❤
How sweet. Keep those kids grounded.
This is a wonderful opportunity for the children to appreciate what they have and empathize with those that do not have either family or things,,, We were raised to share and help out, doing things with mom and dad are some of our favorite memories ❤ Good on you  Prince William and Princess Catherine ❤❤❤
Diana would be SO proud!!
I  love Kate..
This is what we want to see more. Helping normal People. And doing normal thinks for the Community.
Just as Diana did with her boys.
Good initiative by the Royal family.
Princess Charlotte will make a wonderful Queen one day, just like her mom 😊
William needs to get on his knees every morning and thank God that he has been blessed with this gift.  It's a shame that his father didn't realize the gift Diana was;  maybe if he had, she would still be with us.  I can image that the world would be so much better if she were still here.😢 I'm happy that my daughter )Catherine) shares the same name and is a great gift to me.  Thank you Lord!
So sweet they are beautiful children
Great initiative coming from such a lovely  hearts! ❤️🌟
LOVE LOVE LOVE Catherine, Princess of Wales!  She’s the epitome of everything a woman could ever hope to become. ❤❤❤❤
❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
🥰🥰 Princess Charlotte, doesn’t remember, she was also that small one time . Royal kids are learning well by exposing to different kinds of activities. 👍
How lovely . Following in there grandma’s foot steps !🙏🏻. Wonderful parents 🙏🏻.
Love, love, love
We need this in all countries to support babies and their families
Catherine and William are doing such an awesome job raising their children.  Teaching kids the importance of giving back is so important.  They treat their kids like normal people, not snobbish kids.  It’s absolutely wonderful to see.  Love the Royals!  ❤❤❤❤
I live in the US and i dont know why every 4 years we have to have a new president. If a person does a great job as president i think they should stay president if thats what the people want imo
Bravo Catherine and children 👏👏👏❤️ lovely gesture and great for your children to realise some kids get very little!
Klu Klux Kate "worked" the equivalent of a single month in 2023. And her "work" was unsuccessfully cosplaying Princess Diana and Meghan at 1-hour or less photo ops where she deigns to flash her bony smile among the riff-raff she couldn't wait to separate herself from. She and her dollar store mama plotted just to get KKKate into the side-piece position.
Princess Diana's Legacy for  helping people and bringing awareness lives on.
I absolutely love seeing them give back to the community and country to those less fortunate than others around this time of the year and all year really ❤
So touching to see her showing her kids compassion ❤
Raising your children to be compassionate and have empathy is  the best teaching a parent can do Bravo Princess of Wales
Crazy.  This actually brought tears to my eyes.
Beautiful 👏👏👏
I Hope the Royal Family also Write a BIG cheque!
❤ these children
If this was Meghan and Harry with their kids everyone would be mocking them and saying they have a camera crew. If the Wales family really were doing this to help they would have done it under the radar with no cameras in tow.
I am in the middle of watching a video with Prince William and one of his charities on homelessness. I would LOVE for you to contrast this with Better Up. What a real charity is like of Prince William's and Better Up with Prince Harry. The Wales' charities, even just one of them, blows the Harkles out of the water.
1:11 Louis! 😍😂
wonderful
Giving back ... irony....
wonderful her Royal children learn how to help others, those are good seeds in there, Blessings to them 💕💕💖💕💖
❤❤❤❤
It's about time she done something  she don't do much
3 fantastic kids with parents who genuinely care. A brilliant team and a good example. Thanks for everything you do. Merry Christmas! 🎄
Catherine and William and family rocks !!!
I really LOVE and RESPECT  the way they raise and show their kids to  love ,share to the others.God bless your family.
Beautiful family ❤
Sweet.
There where she is, princess Diana must be proud of his elder son, the wife that he has chosen and their amazing children I can’t help crying, of joy ❤❤❤❤. One day prince Harry will find his own way too.
Simply splendid....such a wonderful charity and to see all 3 of the beautiful Wales children was such a gift. They did a marvellous job and the Prince and Princess of Wales your children are a credit to you both. Merry Christmas and God bless to everyone volunteering their time at Baby banks, thank you for all the work you do.
The Wales children are such little angels 😇. Catherine is a good mother. God bless 🙌 the British Royal Family.
She is such a great mother ❤❤
Kate is doing the same thing as her mother in law, teaching her children that there are people & children out there in need. Kate has the same elegance and pure heart as Diana.
😊❤️❤️❤️🎄🎁
What an endearing video. ❤
its too little, too late. not just for her, but the entirety of society. Lookit you guys.. you CREATE poverty using economic policy and income gaps.. you create the criminals, with the laws you lay down, for people to live with, without a safety net. You've enslaved the whole of humankind. Doing it with smiles makes you a worse barbarian then that nahsees of the old past. lol. Still nahsees!
Wie süß sie sind!!!💘💝💖💫🌲💐 Euch allen frohe Weihnachten, meine großen Lieben und besten Wünsche.🌲
Adoro questa famiglia ❤
This is so sweet!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Absolute *Hypocrites* !!!
Diana would be so proud of Kate Middleton, such a caring woman who's helping families and raising her kids to be humble,respectful, and strive to help poor communities. P.S I hope this comment ages well see...
The Princess of Wales is a great Lady. 😅😮😂
It is good to see that the young princes n princess are learning to care, to love, to share n be compassionate to those who are poor n struggling in society by learning from the wonderful examples set their parents Prince William n Princess Catherine. May God bless them abundantly!
I just love Kate she is so so sweet and very beautiful, minds me of how diana was.
The Princess of Wales is raising her children well, especially Princess Charlotte, she is always enthusiastic in charity work.
Diana did this with William and Harry, however, I think she spent more time with William because of the fact he was going to be King.  The difference between these mothers is one kept it quiet, and one is choosing to show by example and there is no wrong between either.
If you are able, please donate a gift, all donations are very gratefully received, no matter how small.
I love this family who represents the monarchy with compassion to others. I wonder if they did in medieval times?
That is REAL parenting. Teaching your children compassion, humility, generosity, love, giving, and always remembering that not everyone is as blessed as you.  May God continue blessing and protecting them all.
Wonderful,  caring family.
I love this family even though I am not from the UK.They are so genuinely caring.God bless them.
Fantastic way for children to see that not everyone is so blessed, donating to your local baby bank is such a great thing to do.  I try to make pram & cot blankets for mine and last year bought baby clothes in the January sales with gift cards I had received, passing the love on.  Catherine, William and children are a shining example of the good and right things to do.
Lovely . Beautiful family
Beautiful family doing great things! 🇺🇸❤🇬🇧
A wonderful family
Good for her well done Princess of Wales! ❤
The children are a credit to there parents
Maybe if the monarchy paid their fair share of taxes we wouldn’t end this charity.
Not buying presents for your cousins is wild.. but go off😊
It’s almost 2024. Can someone explain why the monarchy still exists?
This is so refreshing that she and William are teaching them this important part of life. You may be privileged but, not so much to help others who are not . Great job Kate ❤
Кэтрин... живёт в роскоши, безопасности, легко и никаких проблем!! Что бы так не жить...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you and your beautiful kind family Princess Catherine and Prince William! 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
Wonderful and heart warming video. Beautiful family. Well done to them. 🥰🥰🥰
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🙏❤️
It is so incredible how generous the royal family are at helping other children who need help
Wonderful watching the Royal  kids, they are so well brought up, God Bless them!
Wow, George is very much like his father!
❤❤❤
Heart warming 💜💜💜
Didn't realize the poverty rate in the UK was so high.
So where  are the  sussex kids? Forgot  they don't  like to be in the public eye, someone  might abduct  them lol.
Bravo!!!👍👏❤️🎄🎄🎄
Thank you for all your amazing work.
The Princess of Whales and Prince of Whales remind me of Princess Diana.
Ik they're being filmed, but that literally brought tears to my eyes how cute those kids are and what a nice thing they'e doing.  It's so great that the princess of wales includes her children in these charities.  And actually a great idea to have them pick out the toys for kids their age.
The Princess of Wales is a blessing not just to the UK but also to the whole world... Edit - all of us can be great because all of us can serve.
Bless the Wales family. They are wonderful and kind human beings. I am so proud of the children for being respectful and helpful. Princess Catherine and Prince William have done an amazing job instilling good values in their children and teaching them about compassion and empathy for those less fortunate. Bravo Wales Family ! ❤️
So sweet! She is such a good Mum.
Beautiful moments 🥰
What a great experience for everyone- the joy in being of service and helping others.  Love this Royal family! 🙏❤️🇨🇦🙏❤️🇨🇦
I think it is wonderful Kate is exposing the children to many different "life" scenarios that schooling couldn't provide. Very very valuable especially being the children are Royals who up till now aren't usually exposed to the commoner lifestyle.
I’m not crying, you’re crying 🥹
Fantastic ❤🎉❤❤
👍
This is about her feeling better about her extravagant wealth.
About time she did some work !!!!
❤❤❤❤❤ Absolutely 💯 love how Princess Catherine is teaching the children. Through actions. Helping is the right thing to do.
Wonderful to see you starting the children out young to be volunteers to give of their time for a worthy cause.
❤️❤️❤️
Love them
❤❤❤❤
Meri Kirihimete from New Zealand . Beautiful family beautiful cause and very inspirational ! We can all help someone at Christmas , let's all pay it forward .
THIS IS REALLY VERY GOOD,KIND,HONEST,HELPFULL❤LOVE FROM TURKEY❤
I'm from the USA and I love the Wales family. Parenting and charity done right! 😊❤
Abolish the monarchy.
Lovely family doing what needs to done. Humble and compassionate. Contrary to the grifters overseas in Montecito. Keep shining princess Catherine!
Well done to everyone!
Bless the princess and her amazing offspring  God bless 🎉❤
❤
The Wales children are absolutely wonderful!!!  So are their parents.
This Wales family is different. They are connected to the people ❤️
This is fantastic and needed for the few ppl who struggle ❤❤❤
Beautiful, & a Blessing ❤
Beautiful family, and what a great charity!!!
What a beautiful video. The children are a credit to their parents. So lovely to see them chatting and volunteering ❤
Absolutely beautiful family and wonderful initiative ❤
Such a beautiful and inspiring video of truly important work. I love that Catherine is teaching her children the value of service and charity and the enthusiasm with which they showed. Well done George, Charlotte, and Louis! And kudos to the staff at the baby bank for the work you do every day 👏
I like how Princess Catherine drove them herself, and they brought donations as well.. ❤❤❤❤
Beutiful Princess of Wales❤❤❤❤
So great to see the Wales children helping others.  Well done Mom and Dad.  Great job!
Love this!
Catherine may have come from an ordinary British familly, but she is an extraordinary woman. Extraordinary Wife, Mother, daughter, sister, daughter inlaw. Extraordinary royal doing the royal familly and her country proud ❤
💯🤍ICON FAMILY OF ROYAL👼🏼👩🏼🧑🏼👱🏼‍♀️👱🏼✨💪🏻♥️
💯🤍PERFECT BEAUTIFUL FAMILY 👼🏼👩🏼🧑🏼👱🏼‍♀️👱🏼✨💪🏻♥️
the Princess of Wales did set a good example. How to use the privilege well and how to teach the children to be grounded. Well mannered, too. Those children seemed to understand the assignment. Well done Her Royal Highness ❤.
Great job!💙💙💙
🌐👏👏👏👏👏👏🎄☃️🎁🎆🙏
25% of families with a child under 5 living in poverty !! It is an awful figure !
Wonderful to see Catherine bring light to the work of a grassroots organization and at the same time teach her children hands-on the importance of helping others. This is truly worth of a Princess.
She is doing an amazing job. These kids are so kind, generous. I watch this video and the Christmas card and is impossible not think in Diana and how proud she will be of William, Catherine and their children. Im a huge fan of the Princess of Wales and the job she is doing.
I'm an American and I have great respect for the Royal Family and the wonderful Wales family.
Delightful Kate ♥
Love this!  I see lots of us Yanks commenting on this video - voicing our appreciation for this awesome family!  Katherine really is an amazing lady and I'm glad to see that William chose such an outstanding future queen!
Heartwarming to see such well brought up children & know they will be leading members of our Royal Family in the future.
Brilliant

Catherine is an amazing mum. Educating her children to show respect and compassion for others who have far less than they do.  The royal children do it so carefully and considerately. They are an inspiration. ❤
The princess is really an asset to the family ❤
How can you not love this family❤️ Kudos to the Prince and Princess of Wales for raising well adjusted children! They are doing an amazing job!
Such a beautiful initiative.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
💙💙💙💙💙 Beautiful
To the princess of wales smash
💖💖💖💖🙏🏻💖💖💖🇬🇧
Che bel gesto tanto di capello da una persona che veramente ha un cuore d'oro e per il ruolo che ha è veramente apprezzabile....❤
I love this family! I'm so proud of Kate and Wills for raising their kids right.
Brilliant!!
I love the energy between Catherine and her children. I heard a quote by Jennifer Lopez where she says she tries to raise her kids with roots and wings. Catherine I think is doing the same thing ❤
✨Beautiful hearts✨
❤
What a wonderful video! Kate is just amazing!
This is what amazing parents do! how sweet, Kind this is! she is really one of a kind! God Bless you Beautiful young Princess and your family! keep shining as God is on your side! the world love you and your family! ❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Brought tears to my eyes. I love the Prince and Princess of Wales and their precious children. Catherine and William are teaching their children to care for and help out the less fortunate 💕
🙂
I am absolutely devastaded to her that 25% of ALL families with a child under 5 years of age live under the poverty level. Do not say nothing can be done about this. Yes this gestern of donating christmas present can be considered nobel but how about concrete efforts to permanent improvement of this situation.
☮️🙏
She is one the princess, who she is teaching her children as this tender age, to give a gift of love some time to charities is wonderful thing to see. Well done, Kate pouring a great foundation to your children.
The reason for the high poverty rate is the systemstic replacement of the Western Christian Paideia with the rampant Progressive Marxist Paideia.
This is such a wonderful video. Thank you to all of the volunteers and people who contributed to this wonderful cause. The Royal children are learning a valuable life lesson. What loving parents they have. Well done❤
It was high time at least that her children keep up to the reality a little bit !
As if I couldn't love her any more, Princess Catherine continues to shine a light on a rather dim world. Bravo for setting an example not only for her children, but those worldwide. HRH Catherine, Princess of Wales, is a gift to all humanity. Christmas greetings from America!
Just love are beautiful princess Catherine, and the way she’s bridging up her lovely children to care for other people in need ,it’s just amazing. God bless her and her beautiful family💐
Love this family ❤
That's beautiful! Love our Royal Family! 💖
This royal family wonderful, Catherine is wonderful mother's,she teaching his children the meaning of love, giving and appreciating others.. At the beginning of the duration clip in the parking  I Thought Prince George was Catherine's assistant..Apparently the eldest son of the Wales royal couple..It feels like time is flying quickly. The three Wales children have grown up.
I absolutely adore Charlotte! She's so sweet.
我在此也是說very good！
Prince and Princess of Wales are really good parents!!!!🫶🫶❤️❤️❤️❤️
They are just in every way the perfect family.
After Princess Diana I never thought we'd see another 'Queen of hearts'... and yet here she is Catherine the Princess of Wales our beautiful new Queen of hearts, teaching her children the same values 💕
Kate is great, love her!
Wondeful.
Heart warming ❤
Catherine involving her children into these projects is spectacular.  They will forever embrace the idea of giving and helping others less fortunate.
Love this.
Congratulations to Princess Kate for teaching her children the right way and you will always have humble children remember it rubs of well done lots of respect for her.
Have a great trip with your warmness family, Baby Whales😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
👏👏👏👍🇦🇺
Wow, judging by the comments this propaganda actually works! You people are being mislead!
Beautiful and kind family and Princess Catherine is a loving mother and wife late Diana will be so proud of prince William and Princess Catherine and they beautiful children..❤❤❤❤❤
1 in 5 children live in poverty because of Britain’s lingering class system. The monarchy is a core part of this problem. Don’t fall for this propaganda, the monarchy and all royalty must be abolished if we want an equal and democratic society!
Wonderful❤
Diana started it and William and Catherine are continuing the legacy of about bringing up royal children in the real world. The Wales children always look happy to participate and help without a fuss or bother.
I love this ❤️ So love watching a new generation of Royals growing up, I grew up with William ☺️
That's lovely 🫶
Louis has a brilliant little personality! 😊 speaks his mind!
This is beautiful!
I was gonna scoff “Hey, not much of a sacrifice by these immensely privileged people, okay?“ - until I remembered Harry and Meghan. I mean, some royals really don’t bother. So, cheers to the Waleses. Sometimes, simple decency is exactly what’s required.
Completely lovely.
Wales Family ❤❤❤
Did the kids wake up early to help? Wow
This is beautiful! God bless them.
Am I crazy or does Charlotte remind anybody else of her great aunt Anne ?
Christmas is a time to remember those that are less fortunate and how important it is to spread kindness. Charity begins at home and donating to causes like this is so vital. Thank you for sharing and raising awareness.
Love THe Wales Bless em!!
Love, love, love this❤. Princess Catherine dedicating her energies and focusing on the younger years, the future of our precious world.  One compassionate act at a time makes so much of a difference.  Wonderful to see her pass on her passion and dedication of royal service to her children.  This is what we should be seeing.  Positivity and care.  Thank you 🥰
We love you Catherine❤
Perhaps,if we weren’t forced to pay for her palaces,her food,her clothes,her private schools….we wouldn’t need charities. £86.3 million a year clearly buys a lot.
How divine. What a wonderful example Catherine is setting for her three and for such a worthy cause. ❤
Our Future Queen 👑 🇨🇦🇬🇧
How can you not love this family. I just know Diana is looking down at them smiling.
How lovely to see the children getting involved in this and really taking it seriously. Bless them ❤
My Goodness...how lovely the children of Princess Catherine and Prince William lead by example. My daughter, now 33, always said...Manners are the glue of society...
🌹
Gorgeous family  makes me proud yo be British 😊❤
My goodness! The kids are big now, they grow so fast! Your Highness-es, Thank you for sharing this moment to us. It's so lovely to see your children.
The Prince and Princess of Wales are raising their children well.

So wonderful to see this family supporting those less fortunate. Well done the Waleses…
This is so beautiful and I watched it over a few times.  The Wales's are a beautiful family, kind, caring, down to earth and totally lovely.  This is the right way to raise children, fostering compassion and kindness.  Such a great job, Catherine, George, Charlotte and Louie. 🥰
Wonderful ❤
I love our country! our future is bright!
What a truly wonderful family ❤❤❤
The sincerity speaks volumes to the commitment to community
❤
Many times I think that Diana, after the divorce, wanted to stay within the monarchy and work intensely to change it (not destroy it), because she knew  that it would be her children's future and she had to make that institution somehow better and mark a path on which William and Harry would walk safely and be loved by the people by addressing and working for it. I think William is walking exactly on the road created by his mother.
How cute 💖💙
I'm not even from the UK but I am already excited when William and Kate become king and queen! I am near Harry's age and my family eventhough we're from the other side of the world follow the RF most esp when Lady D was still alive.
The royal children are really really interested in whatever they do. They’re great kids & will grow up to be great adults. Hats off to their Mum & Dad for instilling great values.
From the way Prince Louis (the third and the youngest child of Prince and Princess of Wales) reacted to the big one for present..he seemed naturally rejoice happiness for others, celebrating honesty and generousity..his siblings also happy with the event..they're good royal children. Their parents raise them well. Very young parents and a good example of parenting.

If Meghan and Harry think their kids are getting a normal upbringing, they really need to see this.  These youngsters are royal, but also unpretentious and yes, normal.
Such a terrific effort by Princess Catherine’s children helping in this way.    ⭐️⭐️⭐️👑👑👑👑.
Eu amei o vídeo !
This is such a wonderful, caring video.  Princess Catherine bringing her children to volunteer helping with the huge job of sorting of dividing the donations for families in need.  Not only have they learned the positive lesson of volunteering, but more importantly, they are learning about the thousands of children and families who are struggling and will be so happy to receive this loving outpouring of support from their communities during the holidays. The Wales children are caring and loving just like their wonderful parents.  💖
This is the kindness & beauty that HRH Princess of Wales reflects. Her children, when taught the importance of serving the community and giving, will be an asset to the RF.
Just love Princess Catherine, she is what other mothers look up to & her children r so delightful to watch & learn from their Mum to help families that don’t have. Just love TBRF ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just such humble and beautiful attitudes. Well taught, well behaved, and happy. Kudos mom and dad
This is such a good example of helping people starting at a young age! Thank you!
POYA
The late Queen would have been so proud!🥰
The classic family Christmas, Catherine is definitely a perfect princess from a very respectable family it show’s in every move she makes…God bless her and her family…
Brought tears to my eyes,beautiful
Princess Di would be so happy. These children have been raised well and are being taught by their parents that service is the hallmark of a resilient monarchy.
The Prince & Princess of Wales children are absolutely gorgeous & Prince George has grown up so fast since the Kings Coronation as he’s almost at Princess Catherine’s shoulders so this time next year Prince George will be the same height or slightly taller than Princess Catherine but they are so well mannered, polite, Prince Louie is going to be the funny Prince when he grows older as you’ve seen what he’s already done so can only hope for more of the cheekiness from him , well done Princess Of Wales Princess Catherine you have done a great job on your early years project & I can only see it getting better as each year goes by 🌹🎅🎄🌹🎅🎄🌹🎅🎄
i would like to see stores like Toys 'R' Us, WH Smith, supermarkets and others to step up and donate (if they arent already)
Beautiful ❤
They're adorable
parenting done right. really hit me in the feels. Princess Diana did this with her boys, included them in helping the public in need. I am heartened that Princess Kate and Prince William are continuing to do this with their children.
Love 😘❤🔥💎🦁🤟
Most wonderful video of the Wales’s I’ve seen to date. Bravo to HRH the Princess of Wales for leading her children into joyful service of caring for others. A blessed and happy Christmas to your lovely family.
Those 3 kids do the monarchy proud, Catherine and william have taught them well.
Omg! They’re so well brought up children.
Adoro George, spero che cresca da vero leader sapendo che deve essere presente, ma non deve perdere tempo.
Awesome! This family is just awesome!
Whoa..... I have a goosebump to see your kindess, caring and loving for others. Especially how to involving the Prince George, Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte to do the services.  That's awesome way to bring joy and happiness to other who need it.  God bless Prince and Princess of Wales, and family🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 God bless all BabyBank's team.
I just love this family. I love that Catherine is teaching her children how charity works. Yes, charity starts at home.
Lovely ❤❤❤
Love this so much ❤ God bless and Merry Christmas 🎁 from Texas, USA
Awesome! Kudos to Princess Kate's kids.  Keep up the good work!
I am really proud of princess of Wales, I am Indian but I see what she is doing Andi live her and her family, teaching kids to do good work as a mom should God bless you.
This is beautiful to watch!! And Catherine's voice is lovely to listen to. So glad to see her raising her children well. They have opportunities that not everyone is privileged to, and they are doing good with those opportunities. Bless them, and all who are involved with this ministry.
I love princess Diana since the day i knew her.
This is so lovely ❤
There is no such thing as Royalty. Royalty is a made up Socioeconomic group so Parasites can have a reason to reign over the Mindless. There is not one single Human being that ANYONE should bow to Look up to or worship. Remember, you are actually applauding a enter Family of Welfare Recipients at the highest level. Let that sink in for just a hot second.
Those who want us to be a republic with a president don’t understand or accept that a Monarch is trained from birth to be the Head of State. Queen Elizabeth and now King Charles show us that! Prince William will be just the same and so will Prince George when they are Kings.  They have relaxed the marriage rules so that an heir doesn’t have to enter into an arranged marriage if they are forced not to marry the person they do love!   I think we will see William and Catherine giving all three of their children the balanced upbringing they need, I hope George’s siblings will support him just as well as Princess Anne and Prince Edward support King Charles.  As the world has evolved so does the Monarchy. I’d rather have a Monarchy than a republic!
The British people must be so proud of their Royal family. What a wonderful way to educate children to be kind to others.❤️
Somehow I don't see Prince Harry doing this because this is what Royals do.
It is *so* lovely to see Princess Catherine bringing her children to work and showing them what volunteering and charity is all about. She explains each step to them, they listen beautifully to the other volunteers, and even little Prince Louis wants to come back to help. *That* is raising the next generation in a positive way.
God Bless The Wales Family. Thank you, Catherine, for being such a wonderful mother to your magnificent children. It is a delight to watch them grow.   Much love to you all. Merry Christmas from 🇺🇸
Love all the charitable work you do, and bringing your childern along to contribute to the cause.❤ Bless you and your family for making a difference to these charities.
Gorgeous and beloved family. Thank you for all your hard work to uplift others.
Princess Catherine is so exceptional and what she is bringing to her own kids and many others is what an ideal world would be.Amen and God Bless.
M.     S.     N.     'S heroine family from aroura illinois big brother program keeps trying to epstine me with there kids to cover up there dope
❤❤❤❤❤
Ahh I love this how sweet is this .The does Monarchy is leading by such a example Thank you from the USA ❤
You have your Mother in law spirit 🙏 in you so beautiful 🎉🎉🎉🎉
My heart is full knowing that these three young royals are being raised to be good citizens of the world.  Their parents William and Catherine are doing an amazing job, Diana would have been proud.
❤❤❤
My favourite family…
How lucky and blessed is this entire family ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh, P. Catherine is the sweetest person on the planet and a wonderful mother, teaching her children good. And theirs no doubt what a wonderful and compassionate Queen she will be one day. Ur my American Princess for sure.
👩🏻‍💻It is so good to see Catherine, the Princess of Wales taking her children and teaching them to serve. I got my kids to plan and prepare a meal to give to one a family having a new baby. When they learn to serve when they are young the children grow to be empathic and compassionate and to look around outside themselves. It is so good to see such an excellent example of guiding her children and being a leader for the world. 🙋‍♀️😘🥰🇺🇲🇬🇧
Aww so cute ❤
God bless Catherine bringing her visible children up right. She’s not showing up wearing thousands of dollars of designer clothes and jewelry and Spike stiletto heels and clown make up like her skanky sister-in-law. Catherine is a genuine treasure.❤
She is so inspiring 😍😍😍
So lovely.  Best greetings from Germany ❤
Great mother, great wife, and great future Queen of the UK. Princess Catherine works hard to carve out her own roles and create her own style of doing things. It is never "look at me, ain't I a great humanitarian;" we can see her humility, dedication, steadfastness of purpose, and tremendous hard work. Thank you Catherine; we are lucky to have you and your family.
This is so touching 🫶🏼 Kudos to these young royals for helping for a cause 💟
Oh my god time flies soo fast, those children are grown up now😢😢
Example its the only way to teach . God bless you.
Such a beautiful and loving family, the children are so awesome, royal or not you can see the caring and loving hearts ❤they have. Again beautiful family. God bless. Much love from Chicago 🥰
Love everything about this. It’s exactly the sort of thing Diana used to take William and Harry to when they were growing up. Thankyou Catherine, George, Charlotte and Louis and other Baby Bank Volunteers for allowing it to be filmed and posted on YouTube. Hopefully more parents will take their children to give back…not just at this time of the year…but any time of the year. Happy Christmas everyone.
William struck gold when he chose this one, what are marvelous Queen she will be.
🥰🥰🥰🥰 So adorable!!!
I didn’t know about Baby Bank until I watched this video. Wales family is so dedicated. It’s wonderful that Wales kids inspire other kids all over the world.🥰🥰🥰
Ella es una verdadera princesa. ❤
Brilliant ❤
This is so beautiful.
They shine together with beauty that shine with love like a bright star ❤😊💯✨️🙏😇🫶😘🙌👏😉
Catharine, By doing this , you are giving your children a good habit as a mother, have a nice day
Beautiful
It’s one of the best things a parent can teach a child is to think about others and only when the child sees the parent walking the talk that it will create an impact on the child. Catherine gets all this glory because she’s in the limelight, there are many millions who do what she’s doing and raise good caring families without all this constant show to the whole world.
Beautiful. Very important for children to learn about the reality of life and the hardship many endure.
What a amazing lady. And teaching her children to love 💕 and to care for other people. My respect and love 💕 for princess Catherine just growing every day more and more. In my eyes she is 💓 the queen. She and William is a mean team. Love 😘 you guys a lot.❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mixed emotions of pride that our Royal Family gets stuck in to help unfortunate children and rage that there is a need for it in the World’s sixth largest economy. A quarter of UK families live in poverty? Get a grip UK it doesn’t need to be this way.
The Royal Family is amazing.
It is such a wonderful thing to see ❤
HRH Princess of Wales doing what she knows best working for Monarchy to reach the less privileged God bless the Wales family 🙏💯👑👑👑👑👑
Such a wonderful family❤️👍🙏
I love the Wales family
This woman is remarkable in every every way. What a role model for her children , the British people and the world. ❤
Beautiful! ❤
❤❤
This is the legacy Diana left for his son and his family to carry out with genuine heart and grace. ❤
Lovely kids!
One child policy
…And this is how you ROYALLY drop the mic. When helping others is of greater importance, than a book, direct attacks to one’s character, and attempts to discredit one’s efforts and values… Catherine, I am not British, but I’ve seen you grow through the years into this majestic person. May you and your family continue to receive good fortune, support from the British people and from people around the world. 🇵🇦🇬🇧
This genuine relationship between a mother and her children, and this genuine interaction between siblings can’t be faked at such a young age. These children will grow up with a balanced perspective on life.
The Wales children are so lovely.
You are Amazing! God Bless You
So beautiful…. I could cry….lovely Wales.❤❤❤
It great for the monarchy help people
Heartwarming
This is an amazing family! It brings tears to my eyes of emotion to see them contributing to the less fortunate, specially the way they are teaching there children to give so much love to others. God bless them always 🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
Meanwhile, over in Montecito....crickets!
Gosh! I love this woman even though I'm in Nigeria, I say hat off to the future queen!!! ❤LONG MAY SHE LIVE!!!🥰😍
This is what Royalty is about. Helping others, learning of the issues the people have and getting involved and helping , using your own hands on approach. Thank you for teaching your children. ❤
This is so precious. Princess Catherine is such a wonderful role model not only for her children, but to us too! There's an air of elegance and humbleness with her and the children.
Such a sweet and beautiful family, no better thing then to raise children who are kind and generous to others
How wonderful that Kathrine is teaching her family how important it is to help the needy among other things. She is a great mother and a humanitarian.
What a beautiful family ❤
Speechless! This is beautiful! Getting kids involved with helping others early is so valuable. Keep up the great work! 🇺🇸
❤❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶
What a lovely treat for us to see the children being taught to think of others.
What a blessing you ALL are to those in need, and an example to others.  Your efforts will bring joy for so many families. God save the king, and may God bless you all.
I like how the children are involved.
Amazing ♥️♥️♥️🙏🏻🇺🇸
Just an amazing lady as well as being a princess and future Queen, she’s teaching her children, that not everyone has everything they need and donations are greatly needed ,they also  all took in donation packages themselves,maybe we should all learn form this wonderful family
You don’t see the Meghan and harry doing this with their kids.
Wonderful many blessings 👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️🇨🇦
Lovely.  Great to see Catherine bringing the children along and getting them involved as Diana often did with William and Harry. They're so big now! Wow time flies!
We are SO lucky having Kate in the Royal Family. She is continuing what Diana started.  Kate is definitely a queen in waiting, in behaviour and style
Love this family, they have genuine empathy and it shows....
This is so lovely to see! Catherine getting her children involved in helping people who are less fortunate than them!
Well done and thank you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That's a princess, and her beautiful children ❤️ ❤❤❤❤
Catherine is like an angel from heaven
Beautiful.....the Wales kids are adorable......I watched this video like ten times 😍  Happy Christmas and a wonderful New Year🎉
Another Princess of Wales showing her children how to interact with ordinary people. Diana would be so proud. 💖
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏
And this is what we had all hoped that Harry and Meghan would have done for the world.  Obviously, not.  It's all about them.
Catherine is doing a great job as a mother.  ❤️
SO GREAT to see Kate involving her kids in charity activities.   Hope it CONTINUES over decades.
Love love love the Wales!
I love Catherine Princess of Wales teaching her children to give! Not just materials things also time and effort to do these things. To care and love fellowmen, be selfless. That’s what a mother does. ❤❤❤
Little to those children know a future King, Queen, and  Princess signed their card too😊
Love the Wales family ❤❤❤❤
Wow that's wonderful❤
That's wonderful that Catherine Princess of Wales brought the children. What a great life lesson for them.
Inspiring!!!!
HRH Princess Catherine the children’s PRINCESS!!! ❤❤❤
"THIS!" ❤ Princess Catherine raising her child amazingly.
AHWWWWW DOWN TO EARTH KIDS
❤ Bless your hearts royal family and thank you all working at and for the centre. My best Christmas gift seeing all of you joyfully packing those gift bags. A very happy Christmas to you all and G'day to you all from VICTORIA AUSTRALIA❤,
I love Them
Love how “ George wants to come back”! Yes momma, train them to serve and care about others!
What a simple message - to get out there and help, in any way!  It is good to see the future royals learning how to help.  In the US, we have a few organizations, one is Toy for Tots.  Police Dept's , Fire Dept's all get involved, as do individuals to help out.    There are many other organizations too:  for single parents, for runaway teens, for the animals, and those in hospitals - so many ways to get involved -   :)
Wonderful.... God Bless the Princess & Prince & their children.
Prince George helping his sister with the paper bags... so sweet and gentleman..
They raised them Well... ❗🔥👏
You guys are such wonderful parents and have such wonderful! ❤❤❤❤
This is a beautiful thing the Princess of Wales is doing and I love that the children are involved and getting hands on experience. What a joy to see. Thank you to all for your hard work with Baby Banks.
This is so wonderful. Catherine teaching her children at a young age to give back. I love that they took boxes out of their car to give as well.
That is so sweet. She is bringing up very fine children. They will have good human values.
Brilliant to get the kids involved! Love our new Princess of Wales
Princess Lottie is so adorable! The whole Wales Family are awesome 👏
Love this family!!
Hopefully, everyone who can is doing things like this regularly.
Love them!
Oh but the security….
So good to see!  They are going to do great work when they are older.
How about giving some of their excessive wealth to those in poverty?  Are we supposed to be in awe because the kids out toys in bags?
Nothing better than seeing a child share for lesson fortunate. This is got to be instilled at a very young age. It’s a beautiful tradition to have.
As lovely as it is to see the Wales’ children do this, isn’t it awful that in our world we have children growing up as royalty while others get their presents and food from charities like this?
I absolutely love ❤️ this!! The Princess of Wales is priceless! She’s such an amazing and inspiring beautiful woman with a heart of gold 💛 and she’s an absolute incredible mother. I love how she’s slowly getting Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louie out and about in the engagements that they are able to be apart of and letting them help out and teaching them how to navigate the public life. ❤
Catherine, I must tell you the love and support you have from around the world is amazing.  The amount of lovely heart-warming messages about you and your family that I see on a daily basis melts my heart.  You are one special lady and we are proud of everything you do and we are blessed that you are part of our wonderful Royal Family.  Bless you and thank you so much ❤
Diana taught William and Harry well about volunteering at that early age…thus Catherine and William picked a great charity to teach their children.  Then when they were teens… Diana had both sons sleep in the streets in a tent with the homeless.  Diana’s heritage continues.
I see you Kate Kadeshian.
Fab
S7ch a fantastic mom,teach8ng their children the importance of supporting the most needed ❤️
How does this affect LeBron's legacy?
well rounded children... kudos to the parenting style of Prince William and Princess Catherine
A lovely and natural way to teach children to think of others and have fun in the process / that giving and caring is an enjoyable thing to do.  And the princess of Wales driving them herself, no fanfare, no obtrusive security, no airs and graces.
I remember Diana taking Wills and Harry to homeless shelters at night to show them empathy for others.  This reminds me so much of this and allows the children to see for themselves and participate in helping others.  People can be cynical but you can see the children are eager to take part and put consideration into what they are selecting to pack...Beautiful ❤️...
🙏👶🙏
❤❤❤❤
Catherine is just bowling us over with the great work she is doing with her charities.  And she's getting the kids involved as well, and that's what it's all about.  ❤ kudos to our future Queen.
Great and inspiring project! Congratulations! ❤
Baby Louis is not a baby anymore 😢
Catherine is raising an amazing future king. She is such a classy woman
Princess is such a role model for all young women everywhere. Definitely NOT celebrities.
These little things like Christmas presents and clothes can make a difference for a child.
Totally warms my heart ❤️
One request: please start adding the name of the soundtrack to these lovely collage videos. They perfectly capture and set the mood for the video's message, and I'd love to listen to the entire sound, or more by the artist who composed it. For example, Since September 2022 when the Queen passed, I've been unsuccessful in finding the name of the soundtrack to the video the Royal Family YouTube channel posted that commemorated her life of service. It was so powerful and emotional and I absolutely adored it! All I found was that it was composed by Dredstudio, but no title to the actual soundtrack. Either way, I loved watching this. Keep the videos coming. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to the entire royal family in the UK.
It's wonderful that the children are becoming somewhat comfortable with a few photos. I noticed it at the Christmas Carol event also. Such a lovely family.
Beautiful ❤
What a beautiful video.  You can clearly see how the kids were so interested and involved in this project.  ❤
Well done Kate and her 3 little helpers so lovely to see charity work by the royals.
❤❤❤
Love them so much 🇮🇩  Where you guys from? Show your flag down there: 👇
Lovely. My late parents were Salvation Army officers, and as chikdren, my brother and I spent countless hours with them while they helped others. We were blessed to learn the value of helping others. Very heartening to see the Princess involving her children similarly. She is gifting them with the knowledge of the needs of others. It will serve them well as they age. 💖
You can tell Charlotte knows how to fold clothes.
Teaching by action. ❤
She is exactly what Queen Elizabeth would expect. Great job Princess Katherine, you are paving the way for future royalty to be generous and kind
Merry Christmas to you and your family. I love that you are teaching your children the importance of volunteering and helping your community. 💖
Soooo sweet! Watching from Texas.
Beautiful love this video ❤
It’s so wonderful to see the royal children involve!! Love it!
I am very very relieved that GB has this genuine woman as a future queen!
This is beautiful ... ❤❤❤
Great way to get the kids involved.
The kids sure looked like they enjoyed it.
Que família linda e fazendo um belo trabalho voluntário ❤ as crianças estão tão grandes!!!
She is such a beautiful person, inside and out. What a great role model ❤❤
Warms the heart to see.
I wish the monarchy could do this good work everywhere, we hardly see them in commonwealth countries such as Australia.
Very nice ! The children are very polite and the parents is teaching empathy and gift giving !
❤❤❤❤💐💐💐🙏🙏🙏
Wow!  And to think she could have just reneged on a contractually obligated Spotify deal.
Nice job there mom, teaching your children the power of compassion. These are the traits that will serve them well.
If this isn't the most touching video I've seen lately. What a beautiful initiative.
Can you imagine the smiles on the kids faces when told who packed their bags? ❤
Great❤
Harry and meghan this is work . Helping others in need , this is finding live hard when u sat I'm ur mansion making out u r hard done by
They finally came with something in hand.
Gen Alpha royal
Well done! I love the kids got involved in volunteering.
Lovely 🌹❤ They are being taught well.
Oh my God how beautiful to see how these darlings are growing up with a super mom like Kate!! Just so heart warming! ❤😊
The royal family is so useless... it's ridiculous how the support them.   The UK is as ridiculous with the Royals as the USA is with Trump.
Beautiful so natural❤❤
Catherine is a great teacher to her children…simple as that!  Just having them aware of other human beings, like themselves.
Louis is becoming such a well mannered youngster obviously from his brother and sister.
This was amazing!!  American here!  We see you.. we SEE you!  Keep your chins up and keep doing the good work!   I’m a fan!!
Thank you. 🙂 You've reminded me that I wanted to donate a gift to a local collection but forgot. I'm going to write myself a note now!
Catherine is such a lady i just love her . She is a class act. God Bless her.
Their sweet voices have me tearing up 🥹 Kids are so well behaved, parented by loving and nurturing parents. I hope all 3 get to do more charity work together soon!
What a lovely idea  and so needed right now. ❤
This family makes my heart sing
Catherine, Princess of Wales is showing her children compassion and kindness for children they do not know!!!!
❤❤❤
To teach kindness..is the best gift A Mother can teach her children. Thanks to those who are kind....it's the gift of gifts. 😊😊😊
I L♥️VE that Kate is continuing Diana's Legacy, by taking her 3 Children to Charities to Give &. Help out, others less Fortunate in Life.😌
THIS is how the monarchs start their children off for a life of public service. THIS is what their grandmother, Diana, did with her children. Very heartwarming.
Oh how beautiful it is to the Wales children help with putting bag's of toys and clothes together for the Baby Bank. They are being brought up to care for others less fortunate than them. God bles the Prince and Princess of Wales along with their kids🙏❤️🇺🇸🇬🇧
Love this so much!
Jamaican here ! But AMAZING ALREADY A QUEEN ❤🎉
It would be good for media to spotlight the English families whose children are doing these things all over the country.   I know here in the Cotswolds indeed they are!!   Merry CHRISTMAS to all
It's nice to see the Wales kids are old enough to help out for such a good cause.  Also, it reminds me of when Diana took her boys to the homeless shelter.  Diana would be proud. Catherine's a good mom.
Absolutely wonderful, Merry Christmas 🇨🇦
They seem like nice children and very aware of less fortunate and clearly have caring parents ❤
What a special way to teach children the value of helping. Well done! Example not preaching!  Love her generous heart!
Good initiative! Happy to see the Wales children's participation in this noble cause!
amazing.. such a beautiful family
Brilliant!!!❤❤🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
The Princess and her children showing the Christmas spirit by example.
A lot of people compare Princess Diana with Princess Catherine but I think while she certainly looks to her late mother-in-law for inspiration, she has truly become her own person and a very much beloved public figure. I love that she seems (from what I have observed) to be raising three well rounded individuals while teaching them to never take their privelaged life for granted. Have been a William & Catherine fan since the beginning and she just keeps proving the naysayers wrong
It’s so good getting the kids involved in helping less privileged children . Reminds me of Something Diana would do
So well brought up💙💙💖
Such a very positive human being . Always kind and pure .
I love that Louis chose that gorilla. Such a precious video and precious children. Well done William and Catherine. And BTW not a bodyguard in sight.
Lovely lovely family ❤.   The young king to be is perfect.
Just when you think you can’t love Catherine, the Princess of Wale more, this. ❤ How adorable the three Wales children participating in her mother’s initiative. I hope they also had a good time picking toys.
Thank you for sharing Baby Banks.  A wonderful thing to participate in. Princess Catherine of Wales has been doing this for years. The children pick out items for their age groups. Prince George and Princess Charlotte know how to fold clothes as they are sorting wearing casual clothes. Prince Louis was quite excited when he found the dinosaur to gift to another child  The Wales family is truly representing their Country. Many blessings to all of you🇺🇸🇺🇸🇬🇧🇬🇧❤
They seem like most not-spoiled kids
The Wales Family are so wonderful . It is heartwarming to the children work together to help their mother. It warmed to my heart , love all ❤
Catherine is a great mother and does charity work because she wants to not for publicity it was amazing to see her children helping out and learning about people in poverty they are very well mannerd and respectful William and Catherine must be so proud of them I know the late queen would would have been really proud of her grandchildren I am sure philip and the Queen are smiling from heaven on those lovely prince's and princess hope they have a peaceful and lovely Christmas
Those children have a wonderful mother. The princess of childhood. ❤ Merry Xmas from Mexico to all 🌎.
Thats a good way for them to get more involved within the community. They should get more involved with Kate & William.
Wow these royal children are really so very well brought by their gorgeous mum the Princess of Wales !   And they will turn up to be caring, kind and generous people!!
🦘🎄🇦🇺.The children are awesome 👌 👏 👍 They just shine ✨ wherever they go ❤.
I love how the young Royals put these Social Media clips on to highlight different causes. ❤️🇦🇺
A  Blessed Christmas to Everyone! Thank you for the touching, encouraging video. What a beautiful Family ❤
Wonderful family Kate is like Diana helping others and now Kate and Williams kids will follow hopefully great children ❤❤
How absolutely lovely thank you for sharing this worthwhile work❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is great Kate, showing your children there are others less fortunate that are in need.❤
This actually brought me to tears, this doesn’t just show what kind folk can do to those in need esp this time of year but the the Cambridge family, they are not just Royals they are humans & have hearts & the late Diana would be so proud of them. Well done Katherine 👏🏻👏🏻 we love you x
What a lovely scene, beautiful mother and beautiful children doing beautiful work.
I hope this builds on and that they do this every year for lots of other charities as well.
Crazy how 5000 children are murdered in Gaza yet no condemnation from the royal family - instead they condemned HAMAS for defending Palestine! All the sycophants in the comments below praising these 3 children whilst thousands of children are being slaughtered and nobody cares 😣
What a wonderful thing to see and the fact that the children knew how to fold clothes speaks to their down to earth and caring upbringing, it's an absolute credit to their mum and dad.
There is  hope  for  the world  ....I  am in tears ❤
Thank you Princess of Wales ,I’d  never heard of a “ baby bank” now I know ❤️
So gorgeous!❤
Falow Diane's foot steps beautiful show the little one hwo is done Bravo ❤❤❤
How lovely to have the children helping such a worthwhile cause! ❤
If only our politicians took a leaf out of this familys' book.  3 months in a food bank and 3 months in a care home before they even got to stand for being a councillor, never mind an MP !
This melts my heart. I love how Prince William and Princess Catherine are raising their beautiful children. Diana would be so proud!
Great job raising the future! William and Catherine have really put in the work to bring up happy, well adjusted children. 🥰
We need more of this! Thank you for using your "power" per se, to do good things- and shine light and do work with important causes. Thank you! Elegantly and gracefully, as well. :) A Merry Christmas to you all.
Just amazing 👏🏻👏🏻🎄
Catherine❤❤❤❤
Cool, driving an Audi,😁👍
This American loves the Princess of Wales and her beautiful family!❤️
Charlotte is such a little lady!
Absolutely Wonderful ❤ 🙌👏👏
Just a lovely, loving family… warms my heart
This is how William was raised by his mother, seeing how other people live, so he would understand his duty. The next generation is being raised well.
Great job with love and resources
Princess Charlotte already looks so confident and in charge of what she is doing at 8 years old. She is going to be a force for good when she is older
They are great kids and a credit to the royal family. No pompous look-at-me attitude at all, just mucking in and having fun.
❤❤❤
I absolutely love this family!!  Queen Elizabeth ll would be so proud of Prince William and Princess  Kate and their children. ❤❤❤❤
Now that is Christmas Spirit !!!❤❤❤❤❤
Sweet, precious children! ❤
Got very emotional watching how down to earth the Wales family are. Catherine PRINCESS of Wales emits beauty from within. The interactions between herself the children, and the people surrounding her  Is genuine and regal.  💕The children are so naturally well behaved. May God bless them. The Wales family is built on solid foundations and stability.
Adorable ☺️
So heartwarming ❤
I am American and I love this family.  Princess Katherine is all class. None of them reeks of self-entitlement. Instead, they are about service to others.
This brings tears to my eyes.  Princess Diana would be so proud of them. Thank you for carrying on.
And this is what their biological grandma princess diana wanted them to learn
From the Christmas carol service to this video I have never felt more proud to be British. The young Princes and Princess Charlotte bring a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes, what a fantastic family unit they make with the Prince and Princess of Wales. How lucky we are to have you all and all the amazing things that you'll do to look forward to❤
This is a beautiful video and I just keep on watching it!  Well done!
❤👸🤴👸🤴🙏
👏👏👏
Brava Catherine !! Brava !!  What a wonderful example you are setting for your children !  I courtesy to you ❤
How sweet! I would do the same with my children! Absolutely love Katherine!
This is awesome. Such kind, well behaved and beautiful children. Prince George is growing into a very handsome young man. He is going to break some hearts
Those children are already learning to be the real prince and princess who care and protects their people. Katherine and William are doing so great as parents, allowing their kids to get involved in charities and public events with them and not hide them from the public.
Wonderful! It's such a pleasure to see the Wales children so thoughtful  and attentive and very sweet!
This is beautiful. So happy to see your beautiful family and being taught how to give and help others and the children and babies in need in the U.K. thank you Princess Catherine, Prince George & Princess Charlotte & Prince Louis...you brightened this granny’s day watching this.  Happy Christmas to the Wales’ and Royal Family 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧🎅🏻🤶🏻🎄🎁
❤❤❤
Ahhh very beautiful very beautiful for the small babies ❤ God bless and Merry Christmas
This idea was brilliant! ❤ The royal children are not feeling like they are a spectacle, it's like being Santa, coming in at early evening and quietly understanding the task at hand, and doing it for children who otherwise would be without. But, done in an understated manner. Very , very well done!! ❤ 👏 👏 👏 ❤❤❤roses 🌹  Thank you, western Massachusetts in America 🇺🇸 🙏 🇬🇧  A very Happy Christmas 🎄  with 😊
Wow. That is how it's done. Thoughtfulness, kindness,understanding,volunteering. Well done!!!
Teaching your children respect and moral that is a great ❤❤❤❤❤
lovely family..❤🌹
I hope someone will stop those nonsense attacks to these 3 adorable children's mother.  You are too cruel to hurt them.😢
Omg I have watched this at least 10 times. Thank you Princess Catherine for being such an incredible mother and thanks to your beautiful children too for warming my heart today ❤
I’ve read that Catherine has set very strict working hours until the children are grown, so she can do all sorts of normal things to prepare them for knowing what real life is like outside of the castle.
Princess Catherine is following in her mother-in-law’s footsteps.
So beautiful. Princess of Wales truly is a very kind soul. You can tell from the way she talks and interacts with others. And you can also tell she is a VERY hands on mum. The kids are raised beautifully. Great job to her and Prince of Wales for raisimg good kids and not spoiled entitled brats like their uncle Harkle is.
Gulp!  Now flipping crying.  Well done kids!  Thank you Princess Catherine, you make such a difference.  With love from Australia x
These royal children are going to be such a huge asset to Britain.  They are being brought up with respect and manners by their caring parents.
Amen Amen Amen God bless you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ from Missouri USA
These parents are so amazing raising such beautiful children
The Wales family are a credit to the UK.  Thank you all😊
A quarter of families with a child under 5 live in poverty in the UK. Wow. That's more like the US than Europe. 😢
Kids learn by example! How awesome! They're learning to pay it forward 🙏🇺🇸😁
What a lovely example to set,  Princess Catherine and her beautiful children ❤.
why i have goosebumps and teary eyes?❤️❤️❤️
What a wonderful family
Wonderful. Old school values. Beautiful children.
George just like his Dad loves volunteering
You realize that they are  not doing anything that any other Brit would do. They are raised with rules and regulations and are a wonderful testament to young people's ability to be respectful and kind.
❤❤❤❤❤
This is what make’s Catherine the POW and her family so special. God Bless.
Beautiful Royal Children.  ❤
Thank you for highlighting this great charity. It’s also wonderful seeing the children get involved and let’s all us parents remember that we too can bring our children on these great sharing and caring experiences. Even if it’s just to have a good closet clear out and go with you as you drop it off you’re still including them and helping them to understand helping matters.  Loved the video!
Notice Catherine was not dressed in tens of thousands of designer clothes and jewelry!
Im so proud of Kate and the children.  Diana must love her so much ❤️
THIS is how you teach compassion; this is how my parents taught me, and how I have taught children over the years … by involving children in tangible acts of charity, you teach them humility and grace, and help raise compassionate human beings.
I'm loving seeing Louis! It's like he grew up over night !!
Absolutely beautiful

Princess Catherine - Bravo 👏 Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to the entire Royal Family 🎄💜😇
So lovely to see-well done
This is lovely to see. THIS is compassion in action.
かわいい子たちだね🥹ただそれだけ✨
What a great thing she is doing with the kids!!!
Great effort!
God bless these kids -- such amazing copies of the Prince and Princess of Wales -- and the people all over the world who support charities to help the less fortunate.
I love how they interact. This was such a joy to watch.
Good job! Such an amazing charity! Love love love it!
,👏👏👏👏
So sweet to see the care with which these children took to their volunteer opportunity. Helping out the community and their mum.
How many parents take their kids to do any kind of volunteer work especially when they can sit back and relax??? This is family is just superb…They are NOT racist!!!
I love that  Princess Catherine and Prince William are teaching their children  the values of giving to those less fortunate. It’s a wonderful gift and blessing. Love from Lusby MD USA 🇺🇸
Truly Royal.
Fabulous family.  These children are so lovely and enjoy helping out and getting involved in doing things to benefit other less fortunate children. It is wonderful to see them mixing quite naturally with everyday people from all walks of life and what a credit they are . Prince William and Princess Catherine are great parents. ✨
So lovely the children help,good up bring
Louis 😍
Princess Charlotte saying "Ooh lala" and "So sweet!" in the beginning while Catherine is explaining what they're doing at the baby bank is so cute!
Thank you to the princess of Wales and her children for helping 🎉
Great job ❤️
So beautiful - love the Wales’s family❤
Excellent video! Happy Holidays from Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania
I believe these children are brought up to understand the privileged lives they live yet are taught the value of service to others and show that they are so willing to work to make the world a better place for others.  They are an amazing family. ❤
Bless bless you beautiful beautiful family!!❤
Merry Christmas time everyone from America/CA. May God’s love and blessings bless this sweet Christmas time program for such a good cause. 🎄
❤
Not all Reptilian Overlords are mean, they can be very nice
As an American, it is lovely to see how hard the Royal Family work to make a difference in the lives of others in their country. The  Prince and Princess of Wales are remarkable and are raising their children to be amazing individuals as well.  Thank you for all you do.
Prince William and his lovely wife are teaching their children the lessons that his parents taught him; his mother through her work with AIDS patients and his father through the Prince's Trust. It's a beautiful legacy to hand down. From those to whom much is given, much is expected.
What a lovely and natural vdo of the Wales children, they are growing up with great role models as parents🙂
William and Catherine s children are amazing no moaning woke why me me just happy to help , wonderful parents
To the Good People of the United Kingdom;  Indeed, how very Blessed you are, to have Their Royal Highnesses,  Prince William,  Princess Catherine,  Prince George,  Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, as Your Line Of Succession !  Blessed, beyond measure.
It made me cry. It reminded me of when Diana did things like that with her boys. It’s sad the way it is between them right now. Diana would be so proud of her grandchildren.
What a beautiful family. They are so down to earth. The Prince and Princess are raising wonderful human beings❤️❤️
This is amazing. William learned from his mother how important it is to help those less well off and he and Catherine are teaching their children too. It’s wonderful to see.
I love the fact that she shows up, driving herself and her children in her own car. No big deal.
So heartwarming to see those children in a common setting and behaving just like any other child.  Big hugs, warm wishes and many blessings from Idaho, USA
There should be Baby Banks across the Commonwealth ❤️
Brilliant, that’s how it’s done, well done, all❤❤❤
What are they doing for the Palestine tragedy UK is responsible for.
What a beautiful Mum Catherine is. They all look like they are having fun and learning the importance of giving. Delightful, darling children.
You see this, this is here is why most UK ppl love those kids.
I cried- Diana’s Legacy is living on through Williams children.  I am so proud of William and his wife Catherine.
Is it me or does it seem like George, Charlotte & Louis are growing an inch per minute.   They look so tall. Super impressed with the work ethic the POW has instilled in her kids.
I applaud the P&PoW for the way they’re bringing up their lovely children. Action speaks louder than words. People need to see good works being performed rather than listening to a bunch of word salad speeches that mean nothing from a certain other couple.
What a lovely family the Wales' are
❤❤ so wonderful you are sharing your passi9n with your children and they are embracing the Spirit of helping others like this. They are a credit to you and your beautiful husband.
Awesome!!! That is parenting. Teaching your children how to contribute their time to the less fortunate and instill that what they do can help so many.
And the Princess was driving no security Harry and Catherine is the future Queen.
This video brought tears to my eyes.  How wonderful Princess Cate is teaching her children.  They will grow up to be outstanding people because they are outstanding kids.  God bless PC and PW their dad.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Qué hermosos niños ❤🙂
Absolute amazing idea!  Bless our Royal Family.
Our wonderful future queen teaching her children that not everyone is as lucky as them love them🥰
I wonder how much she'll soend on her children for Christmas.
So uplifting and caring!
Beautiful 🥰🙌🏻👏🏻♥️
It is so very important to teach our children the value of service and giving to others in need, and even more so for the children who are born into wealth. This lays the foundation for compassionate dedicated service to others. Thank you, Prince and Princess of Wales for setting the example for your children to follow. Good parenting is priceless.
So much  care an love  ❤️  give to them giving  them comes easy😊❤❤❤
👍to the Prince & Princess of Wales for raising such great children! They were so helpful and enjoyed doing it!❤
I so love this young family. Bless them all❤️
Fantastic getting the children involved. So they can appreciate what some families have to go through at Christmas 🎄
Good mom teaching her beautiful children about giving their time
I love this woman! She’s fantastic!🇦🇺💖💖🎄
Lindos❤
It made me cry watching this video, it is so beautiful. Thankyou Princess Catherine, George, Charlotte & Louie for giving your time & love to children in need that will be receiving gifts this Christmas.❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not me crying 😭 😭😭. This is a great initiative
best princess of all time 🥰
I just adore this family! ❤
Real housewives recaps
That was a fast paced video. For older folks it’s a blur but I suppose they don’t matter it’s aimed at thr younger generation.
A beautiful family, bought tears to my eyes
The way to raise 'em! 👏👏👏
🙏🙏🙏
Nice is good to teach them early on about giving during Christmas.    We do an annual 'Toys for Tots' get together.  Always a fun event to be with family and friends and gather toys. ❤
What a joy to watch, HRH Catherine is an amazing lady, & excellent mother, & the 3  kids are just outstanding, well done to our gorgeous Wales family, this video really made my day thank you so much for sharing this withus, lots of love From Scotland ❤
Very nice! ❤ I think Princess Diana would be proud of her grandchildren! She was all about the less fortunate!
Her mother in law would be so proud
I always watch the three royal children with so much pleasure. Well-behaved, good-natured, socially minded at such a young age- this is the result of a very good education. The Brits can be proud of the next generation of Royals. Btw, what beautiful donations at that Center- given by people willing to help others who have got less.
I love they are helping people who are poor to  have the stuff they need desperately. I can’t believe how tall and grownup Prince George and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are now
Copying Meghan again. Did she come empty handed again?
❤
What a wonderful future Queen consort. Her majesty Queen Elizabeth would be proud.
If all parents took their time to educate their children like this we would have a better world!!!
I teared up when I saw how wonderful Princess Catherine is as a person.  She is teaching these awesome children to be gracious and generous with others.  Such an awesome mother.  Princess Diana would have been so very proud of her son and his family.  Prince William chose wisely.  💕
Ella donó a los niños pobres Meghan obliga a los niños pobres 😮comprar su libro que cuentos
What an example, thank you
Perfect! Exactly as I’d imagine this family would be. Great staff too, behaving just as they’d do with any willing volunteers.
Utterly adorable kids, learning all about reality and understanding that not everyone has.  🤗💕💕
Love the Wales ❤ from USA!  Genuine people who care about others
So proud of the Wales fam
Charity always starts at home. You can see that prince William and princess Catherine take their duty to their country and commonwealth seriously. They take their charity seriously. I remember when Diana took William to the homeless shelter. This is absolutely amazing to see how princess Catherine is showing the children at a young age how privileged they are and to give back to the country. Duty and service. Like the queen. This is beautiful to watch.
I wish we had The Prince and Princess of Wales in Mexico 😍
I cried. Thank you Princess Catherine for instilling Kindness, Giving, Generosity, Unity in your children's lives. We appreciate kindness in everyone. Respect and Blessings to you, ALL Children and babies, ALL Humanity ~  Suse & Crew Vancouver Island BC CANADA ~*~
That will be a sweet memory for the children.
Am tearing up seeing Kate talking to George about giving back.  Reminiscent of how Diana would have done the same with her two boys and how proud she would have been to see her grandkids doing the same.
I love Royal Family🥰 I miss Princess of Wales Lady Diana.
How endearing!  I like to think of a saying I once heard--"It's NOT what is TAUGHT; It's what is CAUGHT!"  If our children are exposed to giving through groups or communities, they also get the joy of giving in their hearts, too.  What can be a bigger legacy to grow up giving to the poor, AND a warm blanket for a baby, too!!
What a touching video.  Long live the Prince and Princess of Wales.
She is an expectinal mother mentor and human
Wow. Princess Kate is so amazing. Kids are a blessing.  The Country blessed to have this family doing so much for all of you.  Diana would have loved her.  ❤
Wow and wow 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💕💕💕💕💕what a beautiful family 💕💕😇😇🙌🙌🙏🙏🙏💕💕💕much love from Australia 💕💕🇦🇺🦘🦘
Good on you. Teaching the future to care for others needs and provide hope.
Making a difference Bravo ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCESS CATHERINE OF WALES virtuous woman hardworking intelligent empathetic teaching her children VALUES
Princess Catherine and Prince William are doing such a great job with raising their children. Happy Christmas to all.
❤❤❤❤
This, was absolutely WONDERFUL.
With his hands in his pockets George is his father all over 🥰😂
This is so sweet! What well rounded children they’re raising. They’re so well behaved and it looks like they enjoy helping 😍
❤❤❤
I think it’s wonderful that you are teaching your children from an early age the importance of volunteer work. Very commendable 👏🏻
Thank you!!!  All of you are wonderful !!!❤
This moved me. The children are growing up with an excellent set of values.  They are charming and polite, and even for an anti-royalist like me... utterly disarming. Well done, Mum Catherine, you have done a wonderful job!!
Nice video
Though sges raising these children with a nanny. They are being taught the value of life and how to contribute to the welfare of others.
Kopikat 😂
This lady ,Catherine Princess of Wales, is so forward thinking in intervening  in young lives  makes for healthier in body and mind ,teenagers ,young adults and adults ,she is right on the button here ,really admire her work and as a mother and wife ,she is beyond hard working and a gift to the r. F.  From an irish fan from the south  of ireland 🇮🇪
Visiting homeless shelters is how William started with his interest in helping the homeless… hopefully the memories of this visit will spark something for the future in the Wales children ❤
As if we couldn't love them more?? What a beautiful family the Prince and Princess of Wales are raising! So lovely to see them helping out with real pleasure!❤
Such a Beautiful Caring loving family , I send my love ❤❤❤
The Princess of Wales is creating a legacy which will be reinforced by her children when they are adults. It is wonderful to see the family on the frontline,  physically making it happen. Words are cheap, but actions speak volumes. 🇨🇦🤍✌️
Love this family ❤
They have involved the children from a young age so that while they appreciate how privileged they are, they also appreciate how others struggle and these baby banks provide additional support for those not as fortunate as them. William and Kate have done a great job to date in raising their family and the families awareness of the have's and have not's in 21st Centaury Britain.
Such a worthwhile cause to support. Well done on the Princess of Wales and her beautiful children for helping the charity.🐨🇦🇺🦘.
How wonderful and well taught the Wales children are.
This is heartwarming to see. The Wales children are learning, they are being taught to contribute, to give back and understand how lucky they are but that they must serve, work hard and to make a difference (just as a human being, one step at a time) ❤
This brought a smile and tears to me! What a loving, kind gesture from the children.  Their parents are raising them well!
Those children are beautiful. Thank you for sharing. God Bless the Royal Family. I’m so glad William was born first.
Why are so many families living in poverty?
<3
Love this, wonderful way to teach your children how to give to others that don’t have anything,
Those children are precious! What a wonderful thing they are doing!! 💞
Princess Katherine has such a wonderful heart and she exudes elegance. You can tell she’s a little shy, but passionate about certain causes.
Admiro mucho a Kate como madre, esta haciendo un gran trabajo 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🤍
Crianças educadas para o bem. Parabéns aos príncipes de Gales.❤
It’s wonderful how Kate has involved the children, let them know how they’re are less fortunate people in the world.
You are raising extraordinary children in an extraordinary environment. Well done. Merry Christmas to you all.
Wow why to go random acts of kindness ❤we need to get back to the days of families and childern helping out to teach skills for when they become adults ❤🎉
Good role model 😊
Then we wait for the harkles children to be out as well but with their backs only on camera. Cause someone is envious… as usual 😆
Inspiring.  My eyes were tearing up.  Such good lessons, starting with think of others where ever you are.
Diana would be so proud!
Oh my gawd....so precious. How beautiful to see a bit each of the children and their take on everything.❤
Reminds when Princess Diana took William and Harry to see  the homeless. Catherine as a heart of Gold bless her. And what lovely children.
It is lovely to see these children given a purpose for the things they do to help others 👼👼👼
What a wonderful worthwhile  initiative  .  The children were more than happy to  get stuck in . ❤💜💙👍🇬🇧
Well done kids ❤❤❤❤❤
So lovely watching this ,the lady  so relaxed  with the children .
👏👏👏👏👏
I love this!
What a great initiative.  Catherine teaching her children important values
This is lovely! Merry Christmas from across the pond Wales family! ✨️💖🎄💖✨️
Ahhh while babies children women elderly bring murdered in Palestine by a Zionist state with the support of USA and Uk. The irony
Children never lose the foundational values that a grounded family life instils in them!❤
How Lovely ♥
This was so lovely to see. The children look as though they are really enjoying themselves. All privileged children should do this to understand how there are children in need and how lucky they are.
All right, I cried with this.  Loved it.
The Prince and Princess of Wales are teaching their children so well! These lessons of helping others who are like them but without their privileges will stay with them I am sure. I love seeing them as they learn these important life lessons. Catherine and William are an incredible asset to the country.
Very nice.
❤❤❤❤
If only the Royal Family could end the dire poverty in the UK, the King could force a general election to remove the Tories. Another PM by the end of the week no doubt.
Both discipline and charity start at home.❤
I love the whole family. Beautiful.
Bravo Royal Family❤
😘
This is such a special moment and wonderful teaching experience also. Beautiful family and love watching the little glimpses we see of these beautiful children growing up. ❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚
Absolutely wonderful
Amazing🎉power to you princes🎯💯🫶
You can see how the kids are really into it. Kids love to help and they are learning at the same time. And, they are showing up in their own vehicle.
Wonderful to see all the family helping out, it reminds me of my youth helping in Military thrift shops - the experience will remain with you all your days. It was just a simple task, but we had fun and felt we were achieving so much even though it was very simple just giving up some of our play time. Well done to all of you,
❤❤❤
Wonderful example for us all
So wholesome. A great example for everyone.
Did u see all that? When they arrives no security details tailing them! It means they are all safe! Right?
🌲☃❄🎄✨🕯
Such beautiful children!:
Lovely family!!❤️
Princess Catherine and Prince William are doing such a great job raising these children to be caring and giving individuals it would make their Grandmother Diana so proud . I am sure she is smiling down from up above .
People make criticisms about the Monarchy however I have never seen a President teaching their family  to give to others time and understanding and be so humble. All of them Georges Charlotte and Louis are really committed and seem to search  in all items what they could choose and understand the importance of these moments Kate in simplicity honors  her Royal family she built  a strong and sane family ❤❤❤🇬🇧🌷
Beautiful family.  Thank you for helping those in need in your country.
That is what Meghan and Harry don't want to do, work, Meghan wants to be Diana of the magazines but not the Diana that works in charithies and hospitals
Lovely ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I admire this family and all that they do for others 💜🙏🏻🕊️💜
xox
It is an important and simple act for children to share the value of helping others from a young age at different stages of life. 👏🥹💙🫅👸
This family is such an inspiration. Kate is a wonderful Mum and she will make such an elegant Queen when the time is right.
They just turn up with no fanfare...and get stuck in. Love this family.❤
The Princess of Wales is a woman of substance and grace.  Her children are so well-behaved and you can see how loved they are.  Princess Catherine you are divine, your beautiful family the love you have for them is wonderful to watch.  Love the Wales family.  💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
They're the best ❤👑
This made me cry, I dont know why! It is so sweet ❤
❤❤❤
It’s so lovely to see the next generation learning to care about those similar to themselves but in less fortunate circumstances.  🎄🎄🎄
Thank you to the Princess of Wales and her children for helping out at the baby bank, packing gift-filled bags, for children, this Christmas, 2023.  Merry Christmas to everyone.
The children have grown so much. Prince George especially. Beautiful thing to be doing for Christmas. I'm inspired too 🎄❤️
Que lindo exemplo. Amor ao  próximo,  generosidade, educação. Parabéns ao Principe e a Princesa que antes de tudo se sentem pai e mãe.
Your such a lovely sister in law
They are splendid children.   So sweet.   George is growing into his role ❤
I just love this lady. She makes me smile.
I loved it when George said he wanted to come back... Reminds me of Diana and William visiting a homeless centre, and William continued with the visits after his mother died.
❤👏🏻
Thank you for this lovely video highlighting the great work these charities do. 🥰🥰
What a wonderful organization! William and Catherine have done a beautiful job raising their children. They are  kind, well behaved and respectful. They are a real credit to their parents and their country. This reminded me of when Diana would bring her boys to different functions to help those less fortunate.🇺🇸🇬🇧🌲🎅🤶
I can't believe how big the children have gotten. It's nice to see that William and Catherine are being inspired by Diana's influence when raising them
Katherine is such a great parent to George,  Charlotte, and Louis. Teaching them to give back, is so wonderful.
William and Cathrine reminded me so much of Diana ❤! William has learned from his Mom when she took him and Harry out of Kensingtonpalace, deep in the night to look after the homeless peoples on the street ❤❤. Diana would adore Catherine so much for the great mother she is ❤. These 3 Kids are so down to earth ❤. William had lost his wonderful Mother once 😢but to me it seems he now won the lottery in his life with his wonderful Wife and Kids ❤.What a blessed Man he is ❤.
Children are a blessing, thank you for sharing this moment with us
Absolutely wonderful. The children are learning so much by being involved!
❤🎄
Just like Diana did with Will & Harry - she took them to the world away from privilege.
Trying to be like princess diana but nah. I still respect what shes doing tho. Props to her and the kiddos. God bless ❤
I think Charlotte is the most adorable lil thing in the world!   I love her to bits and it makes me sad to see her looking so grown up!    She was the cutest toddler (except for my own) in the world.   But I’m sure she’ll be as wonderful as her beautiful mother
❤❤❤❤❤bless them doing such lovely things for others ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is so amazing to see. Makes me smile thinking of the children who get to open these gifts and for the Wales children to learn the gift of giving your time to help others and see how Important that is. It’s so lovely, especially at this time of year. ❤
They are getting so big!! Beautiful well behaved kids!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼♥️🇬🇧
Fantastic cause, such wonderful well behaved children helping out too 🥰
Diana would have adored this woman!
What a wonderful family ❤🇦🇺🎄
Kate for Queen!
Don't see any security???
💖
Love love love, this family, Catherine and William are teaching their children, that other children are not as lucky, as they are. Just like Diana taught her sons, to appreciate their life, and privileges by taking them to homeless charities. Glad to see William passing on his mums teaching, to his own children.
So heartwarming to see them. Princess Catherine and the children are pure treasure. God blessed the monarchy and Prince William by bestowing Catherine into their lives.
Lovely REAL Royal Family ❤
It’s amazing how the Wales family can do things without the big fanfare.  They are so down to Earth❤
They are such a beautiful family. Merry Christmas from the USA
NONE OF MY BIZ, 😢. BUT, isn't there anything that can be done??!. PLEASE, "bring peace, to the middle east?!. 😮😢 I am from across the pond, (make a right). Keep going, pass Plymouth Rock. Keep going, 90W...😅. Just tell your people. BINGHAMTON, NY. SURELY, THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE. Thank you. Love your beautiful family. GOD BLESS, HAPPY CHRISTMAS.❤😊
How much £££ did the royals donate?
Merry Christmas kids Love from Australia
Lovely family doing wonderful work.
I loved this video very much 😢🤏🏼🤏🏼
👑✨❤️❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼
❤❤❤❤
Great parenting teaching these lovely children that not everyone is blessed, just a the late POW taught her sons.
Kate's beautiful such nice person❤
This is soooo Lovely 🌹🌹😍😍❤❤
Just beautiful.
Those little children are so like Diana. Such a credit to their parents and such a contrast to the endlessly whining, angry and ungrateful American duchess and her dark prince
You are the good members of an otherwise troubled Royal Family. Probably the smartest thing Charles could do now is relinquish the throne to you two, imo. (ツ) ☕☕(ツ)
Wow, I love this. ❤️  Diana would be proud.
This is an example of “walking the talk,” being genuine and open to the needs of others, offering what you can.
Gorgeous children. It is nice that Catherine takes them with her to see what goes on Louis' little face when the other lady was talking to him.🥰🥰
This is what all families with any means should teach their children.  Princess Kate is doing the right thing.
This is so lovely to see! I also volunteer in a similar charity.
Wonderful and Beautiful... and what a lovely charity to highlight.  Love it!  Great job, everyone.  Much love from Australia.
What a beautiful family ❤
Love this💖
This is so special.  The Wales children have two amazing parents who love them very much.😊
They are the best parents ever! Such well behaved kids and helping out. Well done!!
Princess  Catherine is so mindful of the values she teaches her children on a daily basis…we could all learn so much from her as parents and human beings ❤️
Diana would be so proud 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Heartwarming...almost as much as your yourprom channels, Kätä.
i love this
Família linda! A saudosa princesa Diana se orgulharia muito desses netos! Kate e William sabem criar seus filhos! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was so moving! The Royal children are absolutely adorable, and a credit to their mum and dad. ❤🎄🎁🇬🇧♥️
Its amazing but whereabouts are these baby  banks
It was brilliant, and wonderful to see the children involved. It is exactly what our RF is about. Merry Christmas to all x
What a delightful thing to see!  These children are being reared to care for others, and they will carry this tradition on.  Thank you for showing us this beautiful thing that the Princess of Wales is supporting.
Love this ❤
I absolutely love how the Wales family, especially Princess Catherine, involves their children in such meaningful and compassionate initiatives! 😊❤ It's heartwarming to see George, Charlotte, and Louis eagerly helping out and learning the importance of giving back at such a young age.  🌟👏
They are an amazing family.
Beautiful! 👏 👏 👏 ❤
You are creating incredible human beings congratulations 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Very much an echo of Diana with a modern take. Catherine is lovely. The children are lovely. Big thumbs up from America.
They all seem so excited to be helping out at the bank. They are going to be very responsible people when they grow up. Rhey are learning by example from their mother. They are three children to be proud of.
Giving always feels amazing.💯💯💯
This is wonderful! It brings awareness to others so more people can help and be empathetic to people less fortunate.
I am an Israeli fan of the royal family! Since October 7, I have been waiting for their condemnation of the disaster that happened in Israel and... not a word! And that's it...they don't interest me anymore!! There are enough antisemites in the world... after trying to clear themselves of the charge of racism they will clear themselves of the charge of antisemitism and defend...
Kate That is so nice of you to go there and offer help with kids
Catherine, Princess of Wales, advocates for all children and is a wonderful role model to her three precious children.  Bravo!
We love the Wales family in America!
❤🧡💛💚💙
Princess Catherine is absolutely wonderful. I love how she is teaching her children how they can use their unique positions to help others and be a service to others who aren't as fortunate as they are. Instead of letting them live in a bubble of entitlement she is teaching them about kindness, compassion, charity, and humanity.
Thanks to the Borland Nannie’s I would say
Does anyone notice how normal this is for the whales children doing voluntary things and helping where need be and we get to see them on Harry’s kids we only get to see their backs if that ??
Princess Catherine is absolutely wonderful!❤️. Those children are caring, loving and amazing!  What a wonderful thing they are doing. The future of the monarchy is in great hands ❤️
What a wonderful charity and it is great that the Wales Family is involved with such a worthwhile cause. Having the Wales children help out teaches them on how to be truly charitable.
Beautiful
Such a delight to see Prince George Princess Charlotte and Prince louis helping out. Beautiful family.
How heartwarming to see the Wales children excited to pick out gifts for children in need. Charlotte must be the pride of Wales by pointing out one of the gifts was Welsh. ❤
What a wonderful initiative and it ties in so well with Catherine’s early years project. Heartwarming.
And this is how you do it! Actual putting in the time to do something practical to help others.  Harkles take note There are No word salad speeches about being ‘ compassionate’ ‘ reaching out to communities’ but not actually doing anything. The wales family are fantastic. H your kids could have been doing this too with them.
They are a beautiful family ! This is the future of the Monarchy, Queen Elizabeth 2 would be so proud ox
Great job done everyone. Its good to share your time
It is very important to promulgate the value of service and teach our children to serve. Example speaks louder than a thousand words.❤❤❤❤
Gosh this filled up my heart bless them ❤️
LOVE FROM CANADA <3
I feel sorry for Princess Diana because Princess Catherine has been blessed with the life that Princess Diana dreamed and longed for which is the love and devotion of her husband
Truly inspiring mother, this is how to teach your children by showing not telling. It gives me hope for a future generation of compassionate, thoughtful leaders ❤
Such a good activity to do with children. Provides a whole new appreciation
Catherine is a Gem ❤
When I look at Princess Catherine all I see is blessing after blessing from God up high but she did work extremely hard in return
To teach the younger generation, especially in this case a future king,  compassion for others who are less fortunate and how helping is a privilege and an honor. She teaches them through not only with words but actions what being royals are about: it is a duty to serve and love your people. It is a job to be taken seriously and sincerely. Bravo, Princess Catherine.
This is just how children learn, teach by example, teach them young, show them you care about others no matter the way.  Well done to the Prince and Princess of Wales your children are just beautiful
How could anyone possibly call this woman a racist. She is exactly what this world needs. I think it is fantastic that she involves her children in this cause.
Not in a million years did I think that there would be another Princess Diana
Wonderful
God bless our BRF. They are always working on charitable causes. I don’t think they receive the credit they deserve for doing so so much good in this world.👑❤
So proud of this family. ❤❤❤❤
Princess Di would be so so proud of her lovely daughter in law and beautiful Grandchildren for continuing the work she loved doing... 🕊️
Wow that made me cry. Great idea to have a kid pick some things they would like to have or play with or wear. Bravo Kate!
I love the Princess of Wales … she and her gorgeous husband the Prince of Wales are truly a wonderful family ❤️❤️❤️❤️ the children are so loved .. they are raising them with love and affection ❤️❤️❤️
The Wales family are so warm, loving, and charitable. This Christmas Baby Banks initiative is phenomenal! 💜💜
Why are ppl praising them when that’s the least they should do? They’re stealing their ppl’s taxes 😂
Beautiful and very moving ❤❤❤❤
When life gives you lemons 🍋…make lemonade!! What a great way to create greater blessings. ❤
👍
Beautiful, thank you for your service !
Wonderfull it bring tears to my eyes to See this no wonder they call Her the princes of the people 😂😂❤❤❤❤❤ a good role model for Her children ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍
Bravo to those beautiful and kind kids and their great parents.
How awesome she can bring her children with her to work. And teach them valuable lessons at the same time.
So beautiful ❤
Princess Catherine is the embodiment of a very simple woman but with confidence courage and grace to do things which she thinks can help others with care and kindness, teaching her children humility and compassion to those in need and to be happy in helping others for they’re so privileged. God bless and protect the Wales family ❤
Precious.  William and Catherine bring the focus on so many good works.  They are wonderful representatives of all that is good in Great Britain.  Love from the U.S.A.
Love love love this! ❤️
Hermoso😊
Sweet
That the way to teacher your children!
This was so heartwarming! Thank you YRHs for all you do to help out those in need <3 <3
They are awesome
Wonderful!! This is not just a good parent thing (from the Middleton side) but it’s also a Diana legacy for the RF. Teaching your children that there is NO feeling on earth like giving to those who need and are trying. It makes your heart smile!!
Prince louis is so handsome
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Charlotte is my favorite❤
How lovely to see Catherine and her beautiful children absolute credit to our nation
Teaching kindness, charity and goodwill to others is a beautiful thing!
Can I admire Catherine more today than I did yesterday? Yes, yes I can.
Beautiful.  Prins George, prinsse Charlotte and prins Louis. Learn fron the best. Great work. We saluut you. Be blessed and a blessing where evee you go. God bless the royal family.
Amazing  the way you are giving your children such a grounding! Well done there!
❤❤❤❤
That’s so great
What a cute family giving back!
Lovely  children
I love that the kids are so in to helping out with the kids that need a helping  hand  I can not stop being thankful for the royal family in the uk  fit what they do for their children and country  thank you your HRH royal family
Wonderful to see you bringing focus to those less fortunate
Shouldn’t be such things same has food banks.get a British pm with working class roots.
How heartwarming to watch these lovely children learning how to take care of those less fortunate. ❤
What beautiful children so caring like their parents 🎄🎄🎄🎄🙏🏻🙏🏻
What an amazing princess you have! Cherish her. Best wishes from Lithuania 🇱🇹❤🇬🇧
Charlotte has rizz 🤌
Love ❤️ the Wales - god bless them all
Love this!!!!!!!!
What a SAD indictment today that we have baby banks ,food bank's etc in this country ..shame on the government's that let THIS happen!
We love the Wales family.😊
I absolutely love the Prince and Princess of Wales and seeing their children helping out like this is so cool to see. It reminds me of when Princess Diana took her children to shelters and such and it’s neat to see that the current Prince and Princess of Wales are teaching their children to help others. They are so polite and well mannered. Well done to Princess Catherine for taking her children to the shelter to volunteer like this. Pure class and respect. On a side note Prince George reminds me so much of Prince William!
This is wonderful! Princess Catherine taking the children with her to show them the other said of life, where they can help and learn to support such a wonderful initiative. Princess Diana did the same with William and “this one” and William still to this day continues to support the charities his mother took him too. ❤❤
brilliant,
Princess Charlotte was all business! Beautiful!
This video absolutely warmed my heart.  What a wonderful, special family the Wales Family is. Loved hearing George, Charlotte & Louis talk. How lovely that Princess Catherine is teaching her beautiful children to have compassion and volunteer to help others. God Bless you all and sending lots of love.
Truly wonderful to see our beautiful Catherine Princess of Wales with her adorable children volunteering to help and learning about those less fortunate. Love the Wales family.
This is amazing, what a wonderful way to introduce your children to the importance of giving to those that are not as privileged. Rock on Kate!
What a wonderful Mother and children.  Teaching them to always help others in need.  Louis was really getting into it and loved to hear Charlotte laughing.  Well done, Princess Catherine.  😻😁😻
Love princess Catherine,  such a lovely woman, and mother ?
Well done.
Bravo
This brought tears to my eyes. You have a beautiful family & those beautiful children are an absolute credit to you! I’m so proud & grateful for the future of our monarchy 💜
Beautiful video in support of a worthy cause!!
What beautiful children God bless ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
From the US- You are so fortunate to have people like this. There is no one in the US to take the place of your monarchy. This is love in action-Bless them and bless you.
Love this initiative and I love that William and Kate's children are so involved and focused ❤️
Princess Catherine is a beautiful person.
Beautiful, caring, wonderful children raised by equally wonderful and caring parents. I wish everyone had hearts as the Wales family, what a amazing world we'd live in <3
That was lovely.
The children are enjoying helping out. It is genuine.❤
I have never heard of baby banks before and I think it's absolutely amazing.
What beautiful children, prince and princess of Wales are doing very well to raise them god bless them as family
Just simply amazing.
What a treat to see the children in such a natural setting , just being themselves. Wonderful!
Kids are adorable
Awwe i love them. This brought tears to my eyes.
How wonderful to see this with the Wales children. What compassion and awareness it's building in their young lives. Hooray to Catherine for spearheading such a project. She's even more wonderful than I thought, and I've always thought she was wonderful 😊! Well done indeed.
Well done Diana and Catherine, working in unison. ❤
The late Diana’s teachings still live on. Not in the two wayward loser wannabe celebrities in CA but in her authentic grandchildren and her favorite son who is the heir to her legacy.
This was a beautiful video of Catherine showing her children what she does when she's away from them helping others, now they understand why their mother is so special 💞. They got to pick things children their ages would like instead of someone just handing them things to put in a bag which made them feel part of the gift giving 💝.
❤❤❤
What would be better than buying presents is improve the economic situation for them so they can buy for themselves
Beautifully and Brilliantly continuing Diana’s legacy of helping those in real need, caring and being generous a genuine at heart! ❤️
How wonderful to see these children being raised to help others!❤
Why not build up the middle class so the poverty will be reduced dramatically.  There are the haves and have nots. Bad economic policies.
Such a lovely mother and her children
Great stuff!!! Well done everyone involved.
I know I will say something terrible, but only Charlotte looks quite someone to be friend with... the two boys IN MY OPINION are not so able to convey humility.
These kids really know the meaning of being humble and stepping up to the call of service, like their GG did. So refreshing
❤❤
Fabulous - this is how you teach your children to be grounded and grateful for what they have
I just love Princess Kate! ❤
What a lovely initiative
Wonderful thank all the volunteers 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩💖💖💖💖
I'm American, but I'm thankful for the lessons Princess Diana taught her children. Before her, the RF was so out of touch. In my opinion, u can't truly "rule" your people unless it's through example. PW & PC are doing a great job w their children. I'm sure PD would be extremely proud of them.
🥲I had tears in my eyes when I saw this video the first time. ❤ I'm from Germany and have no connection to Great Britain , but it's soo wonderful to see these Royal children with such a wonderful behaviour, how they want to help, have fun there and on the other hand to get to know the poorer side of life.  The side where their Parents and Grandparents put a lot of afford into getting it better ( I think).❤😍❤ .
I love them those kids are so well behaved and I’m sure feel good about helping others.
Simply heartwarming ❤ 🇨🇦
❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤ love seeing the young prince’s & princess
Thank you Princess Catherine for encouraging all of us watching to give and volunteer. 🇺🇸
❤❤❤❤🇦🇺🦘🐨
It’s so great to see that the Princess is involving her children to such generous acts. 🙏 I hope we see more of their family doing this.
So cute ,cute ,cute,......😊
Good on you, Kate!
George, Charlotte & baby boss Louis are just adorable, they are very well-behaved. William & Catherine done a great job raising them 🤍🤍
That family is precious ❤❤
Wonderful!
Catherine  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Those beautiful children are already learning a life of service from their mother and father. They were very diligent and having a good time. Bless them❤🤗🎄🎁☃️ Connie G.
Billionaires dabbling.
Sweet
❤
Gorgeous hearts. ❤❤❤❤
Very glad to see this, and to see HRH drive her own car; well done!
And that’s how it’s done. The young ones are a credit to their parents, just chipping in. Reminds me of my kids coming to help us set up our church-sponsored overnight shelter. Just chipping in.
That is so beautiful.  Catherine  is amazing  and the Queen  snd Prince Philip would be so proud of The Wales Family
Now take them to a soup kitchen to feed the poor
Wonderful!!!
You can tell those kids have folded clothes before! Their parents have done a wonderful job raising down to earth kiddos!
did they drive themselves? and in the dark?
Just a lovely family, and such a worthy charity❤️
I's an Arizona Cowgirl that thinks the UK is extremely lucky to have ambassadors like the Royal Family. Catherine, Princess of Wales does a fantastic job trying to help parents and their children, she along with the rest of the working Royals, are national treasures.
The princess is such a kindhearted person....can't help but adore her...❤
PCharlotte knows how to fold clothing. shows not everything is done for her at home😊
A gift to the world when this type of leadership is rare and so needed.
What a great project. Catherine POW is making sure her children know what community service is all about.  I am sure she has pointed out how extremely privileged they are and why it's important to give back to those who aren't able to give their own children gifts for the holidays due to whatever the circumstances are. Koodos to the POW.
Volunteering is so valuable for everyone on all levels💟
Marvelous ❤❤❤
Beautiful family. The children are a credit to Catherine and William. They are a credit to Britain. 🇬🇧
There are many poor families around the world with many poor children. Everyday life must be made livable. You are spectacular, but that is not enough.
The Royal kids are taught early by their mother, Princess Catherine , how to be responsible & compassionate! Wow! They are truly the best kids any parents would be proud of! Their grandma, the late Queen Elizabeth is smiling for sure in her grave!
❤👍👍👍👍💯
I think I saw some Lego in one of those bags! 🤗🇨🇦
Those children really are a credit to the late princess Diana ❤️🙏
This warms my heart to see Catherine and William as parents setting the example of hands-on giving at a young age.
She is teaching the children to be kind,caring humans.Learning by being involved in service to others.
The Prince and Princess of Wales are such wonderful parents.. their kids are so well behaved and have a sense of duty! They will be wonderful adults without a doubt 🥹🥹 the Monarchy's future is safe with the Waleses ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a beautiful and caring place.  And to have it beautifully presented with the Wales family will give it such positive press. ❤
That was heart warming! Well done to everyone involved! 👏👏👏
❤️🙏
It is Catherine & the Children that are carrying Legacy that their Grandmother Diana, left behind. The care for the Babies, Children, Elderly & those in Hospital. She took William along with her so many times when she visited the Hospitals & Care Centers! William & Catherine are teaching their Children to be Examples of the "Love" part of Charity! Diana would be proud.
Absolutely brilliant. I am in the USA and have no connections to UK but have greatly admired the tremendous efforts of the Prince and Princess of Wales in supporting families, especially when they include their children in the efforts.  Empathy, kindness, and a genuine desire to help others begins at home.  Thank you for the wonderful role models you are not only to the UK but to the international community as well.
Just beautiful. ❤️ Merry Christmas to all. 🎄
❤❤️🥰🙏
Grandma Diana would be so proud of the 3 of you and for what a great daughter in law William has chosen!  Catherine is such a great example for her children.
This brought tears to my eyes because of their GENUINE compassion for others.
If only all the privileged and people in power would do this…. We all will be in a much more better place….🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤❤ The future of leadership is bright 🔥🔥🔥✨
😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰👏👏👏👏👍😘
Beautiful! Well done George, Charlotte and Louis!
What a wonderful lesson helping others who are  less fortunate.
Beautiful. Beautiful kids. Beautiful mum. Beautiful family.
Such a beautiful gesture,  when my granddaughter grows up I want my daughter to do things to help others just like I taught my daughter.   It just fills my heart with joy❤❤
This is wonderful work but i wish it was unnecessary. My dream would be fur all families to hsve a better quality of life and better financial supoort available
This is so wonderful!
William and Harry learned much from their mother, and clearly William and Catherine are instilling the same values in their children.  A joy to see!
🇬🇧👑🫶❤️
Beautiful...makes me emotional
As a mother who has needed to rely on wonderful programs like this, it brings a tear to my eye to think that the princess and princes are being shown how they can help others on such a beautifully personal level. Thank you for showing the world how to be a wonderful loving mum!💚❤
I just love louie
Giving and sharing is the key to heaven on earth
They're choosing presents for less fortunate kids. That's actually very awesome & really nice of them. Now, all those kids are going to want what George, Charlotte, & Louis picked out. -🇺🇸
Son niños adorables, muy bien portados y atentos . ❤
Bless your beautiful hearts and the wonderfully good example you are for the world 🙏🏼💫
The Prince and Princess of Wales have brought their children up brilliantly and in touch with the real world! God bless them  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Maravillosos los príncipes.
God bless all the children of the UK this Christmas. Thank you Princess Catherine for all you do for your country, your children are precious.
Princess Catherine is such a beautiful and humble person. Prince William chose carefully and very well, and together they are raising three beautiful children. George, Charlotte and Louis are a credit to their parents.
Oh wow Royal yet down to earth and caring and above all enjoying visiting areas of life where others don’t have a comfortable life.  Well done too Catherine, George, Charlotte and of course Louis, thank you for highlighting the needs of those less fortunate than you all🥹
The gorilla, Prince Louis is hilarious
The Wales Parents Are Raising Their Children, The Same As William’s Mother Raised Him. To Care For Others.
❤
Giving back as a family!
I think, she is a good role model for her kids. Giving selflessly to the less fortunate. But still, it is necessary to eradicate poverty.
This is a brilliant project! I love everything about it.  I went to a Catholic school and in 5th grade the students in our class took turns serving meals at the local soup kitchen at lunch time. It has had a lasting effect on my life. Both the giver and receiver are blessed. Well done.
Heartwarming
It was moving and wonderful to see how Princess Catherine explained to her children how important it is to help others, and the young Royals looked to be enjoying it as well. A truly wonderful family ❤❤
Diana would be so proud of William and Catherine for raising her grandchildren to be so much like she raised her son Prince William ❤
this is so amazing!  this is what it should always be!   always thinking of those in need and doing great caring things!  thank you Princess for always be you and raising your kids the same way!  you and William are the example of what the governors should be.
George vii will be a fine king someday!
Princess Cate and Prince William and Princess Charlotte and Princes George and Louis, thank you for your service, and your continued blessings for those who are in dire need, that is why God blessed us, so that we are a blessing to others, wishing you all a happy blessed Merry Christmas and New Year and God bless you all and keep you all in His grace, mercy, guidance and protection in Jesus Christ amen.
She works her tail off !!! And they are bringing up those children the right way . What a wonderful example !
George is becoming serious, like William.
Lovely to see the family helping other and no fleet of sis security aroung them
As false as the day is long, never anymore than half an hour given, waken up Wilmington. As if they drive themselves anywhere without the police cars and the rest, not even Charlie gets around this way, chopper for that boy since age 19 or so, he even gets in the chopper to go 8 clicks up the road, no waiting for him, ask any journalist out there they know.
Good lesson for children. I wonder what number of the 25% of poverty stricken people are invading their country as refugees taking resources from the British people. It is a problem and is the only going to get worse.
Thank you Kate for instiing  good values in your children. Merry Christmas to you all
Beautiful!! ❤❤❤
A family to be proud of. Go Catherine and William, you do the Commonwealth proud.
So nice!  Kate is teaching her children well!
She sets a great example for families and service.❤
The children’s Princess 👑🙌🙌🙌
Spectacular parents who are raising generous, gentle kind humans.
Wonderful ❤❤❤❤
This is so so lovely!! 🎄🥰 Thank you for sharing! Merry Christmas and greetings from Costa Rica 🙌🏼❤🇨🇷
Diana would be so proud ♥️
God bless the beautiful Princess Catherine and her 3 beautiful kids. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. What they're doing is absolutely amazing!😊❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏
The children are the the mirror image of their parents ❤️
Love this, raising her children for a lifetime of service.  Beautiful to watch.
Why did this bring tears to my eyes…… so precious….
We should follow HRH Catherines example 2 give back to the less fortunate in the😊 community
Dear Princess Catherine. Your goodness and thoughtfulness shines through! What beautifully raised lovely children. Congratulations to you and The Prince of Wales for doing such a wonderful job!!! Happy Christmas!
Amazing my Queen Catherine ❤
the babies are so grown up. it's wonderful to see them help out for a good cause
Well Done to the Wales’!      Such a beautiful, loving  family🤗    Merry Christmas!🎄☃️❤️☮️🇺🇸

I'm just wowed! What a great way to teach the Wales children about giving and their future duties. Long live the Wales Family!
Love this.
GOD bless the Royal family 🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏
Every time I think I couldn't love the Princess of Wales anymore, she proves me wrong.❤
I love this! ❤️
Wow these wales kids are amazing
Kate is a great ezample cpaching her kids and being a dood mother, t
It's a wonderful video,  but at the same time does not address any of the reasons for why so many British families are impoverished in the first place. It all starts and ends with the British government's financial and political related policies that have had a direct effect on the wealth of the British people, and that includes the open border policies that also have had a massive impact on the infrastructure and resources available in the country.

My heart melted.
People from all walks of life benefit from this form of generosity and kindness. Thank you to all for your selfless support.
It's wonderful to see Princess of Wales explaining to her children the importance of giving back, and they're the volunteers for the evening. I can see why early childhood is her SUPERB project close to her heart. Very proud indeed.
Christmas was very much a mixed blessing in my childhood, as my dad never did any of the shopping (never knew what mother had bought us from him) and would almost invariably blow his top on that day with yelling. Far from coddled, Between those Two Ferns, he never bought me any birthday gift ever. Sometimes didn't even remember the date.
Having the children helping with things like this will give them something that resembles the work Elizabeth, Margaret and their parents did for families and children during and after the war, which I believe helped Queen Elizabeth become the devoted and compassionate leader that she was. They have to have hands-on experience in order to empathize with the people they will serve and lead later in life.
What a lovely thing to do with the children
If she wanted to help she could give 100 million to the families then we see 👀
Power to their elbows. Well done in learning the children first hand that some people will and do need help.
LORD HOLY GOD JESUS CHRIST IT IS THE TRUTH
Gosh, that made me tear up. Thanks for guiding your precious children in the right direction Princess Catherine ❤
Wonderful family
I'm so happy to see the princess of Wales teaching her children that though they are priveledged but other children and families live in hard times,hopefully they will follow in the footsteps of all the Royal s who give generously of their time and giving
These children are beautiful humans!!!!!
❤ Lovely family!!
I have goosebumps! What a beautiful wholesome video 🥹❤ Princess Catherine was born to be a Mum and born to help others. Those three amazing children are a credit to her, Prince William and the BRF. They are polite, well-mannered and you just know that they are aware of what they are doing there and how lucky they are. Thank you for sharing and Merry Christmas to all xox💕
Se puede ver que es una gran madre y tiene una conexión con todos sus hijos, me alegro de que ya les muestre el mundo real y les enseñe a ayudar a los demás 🥰✨
Just the fact the kids were having fun doing something so meaningful and that George want to return is fabulous
O kadar samimi ve iyiler ise Gazzede ölen çocuklar için neden bisey yapmadılar hiçbir kral kraliçe devlet başkanı kısacası kimse kimseden değerli ve özel değildir her bireyi Allah özel yaratmış ve her birey değerlidir insanlar arasında ayrım yapmadan haksızlık nerede ise karşı olmak gerekir  krala kraliçeleri özel şartlarda olan insanlara değil herkesin aynı değerde şartlarda yaşamaya hakkı olduğunu bilmesi gereklidir benim için her insan değerlidir kim olduğu önemli değil Gazzede ölen masumlardan tüm insanlık sorumludur
❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
This is lovely - and mom and dad are the BEST examples of loving thru compassion, and providing service with compassion :) 😊
What a wonderful lady Princess Katherine is. Beauty inside and out.. Wonderful delightful children . Christmas joy to all ❤
Such beautiful children.🥰🥰🥰
God bless Catherine, Princess of Wales for being God's hands and feet on earth putting love in action.
Why do people breed when they can’t afford children?………idiots.
I love your post and sharing of this, definitely your  Mother In law, Princess Diana ( the late one ) i just giggling, happy,  - from heavens , just seeing you Kate and her Grandchildren on this sharing as she was on this generous of  ways of giving and sharing , embracing the less fortunate ones. Keep it up, Greetings from U.S! Please KEEP IT UP!!
Such a beautiful family and what a kind gesture to volunteer for Christmas!🎄☃️❤️
First time I've heard of these I think.
Love your family for doing what you do 😘👏💕💕🌈💐
She's so much like Diana.  I love this for the kids and hope it brings a lot of publicity and help to the Baby Banks.
Princess Diana is Smiling Down right now.I remember hearing stories about her taking Prince William to Homeless shelters and showing him that Helping people can make such a Difference in someone's life.
This beautiful family always warms my heart 💜
The Princess of Wales following the example of the late Queen by teaching them the importance of giving and caring for others.
Love the Wales❤

What a wonderful way to teach your children Princess Catherine!! And what a wonderful gift, that we, in America and around the world get to watch your children as they take this very seriously, and seem to thoughtfully find just the right gift, and happily put the bags together.  Wonderful! I think you are a wonderful Mom and that Prince William is a wonderful Father!  That comes across very clear! Thank you all!!
How beautiful. Catherine and her children set such a wonderful example of kindness and empathy.
WhT a wonderful mother is Catherine
Merci Prince et Princesse de Galles d'apprendre à vos   enfants le don du partage ! C'est merveilleux car Noël est l'amour offert
I love how the children are being included and learning at an early age to be of service to those less fortunate than themselves.
Carrying on the tradition of the last Princess of Wales, encouraging the next generation to others and recognize not everyone is so fortunate. A very important lesson to all of us, thank you for being a living example.
God bless you
Seeing the children fold clothes is a sign they have chores at home. They are raising their kids right
I hope they will be doing something like this for abandoned and rescued pets in animal sanctuaries too that are waiting for their forever homes. Please give them the  word to help homeless pets as well! Bless all animals!
This is beautiful.
Stunning!  It is clrar they take their tasks seriously and give 100%.  I believe they have hearts of service, as their parents.  Beautiful 💚
❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
OMGOSH if I could love her even more 🥺🥰😍❤️❤️❤️
I admire Princess Catherine so much because she is very down to earth and is rearing her beautiful children in the same way. God bless this beautiful Royal Family.
Louie was well into it ,he liked everything and was filling the bag he had for a child his age.
Lovely bairns! Can tell they really enjoyed picking out the gifts. Charlotte spotted the baby grow with the Welsh dragons. ❤

The Wales children are wonderful and well adjusted and humble kids. Well done to Prince William and Princess Catherine on raising their children to respect the privilege and responsibility they have been born into and to also be able to interact and engage so confidently with people from all walks of life. Inspirational family🙏🙌
Awesome mum Princess of Wales with her three wonderful children doing Christmas parcels for other children gorgeous cute and so  sweet  fun caring loveable (family whanau) God bless and a  jo❤yous happy jolly Christmas 🎄 🎉🎁😄🌹💕💯Wales famy ❤
How cute! Princess Diana would have been so proud of the grandchildren and daughter-in-law princess Catherine !!!!
.....and this is how kind, generous, thoughtful members of society are formed
The Wales children are wonderful and well adjusted and humble kids. Well done to Prince William and Princess Catherine on raising their children to respect the privilege and responsibility they have been born into and to also be able to interact and engage so confidently with people from all walks of life. Inspirational family🙏🙌
This made me cry! HRH Catherine, the Princess of Wales is simply amazing and beautiful from the inside out. She and her husband are outstanding in their roles as parents to these 3 precious little souls! Oh, Prince William...your mother would be so proud. Just fantastic!
We are so lucky to have them❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Few reasons why I found this video, very good and inspiring, firstly we all know the importance of the work done by all kinds of banks across the country, and its obvious its definately a passion for Catherine, but also, this video, is a first whereby George, Charlotte and Louis looked genuingly happy, excited and was totally natural around the camera, I think this gives us all such an insight into them, and I genuingly feel the compassion from everyone involved ..... well done to the Camera crew, editors, and of course HRH Catherine, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Team at the Baby Bank, for highlighting and giving us a real behind the scenes look! THANK YOU ALL!  Wishing HRH William, Catherine, George, Charlotte and Louis a very happy christmas! Regards Paul @MrPaulHolton
I love this family!!!
What a treasure the British Monarchy is. Watching these children contribute their help with their mother Catherine for such a great cause is heartwarming, especialky as she explains to them what this charity is for.
Thank you Princess Catherine for involving your children in giving to others!❤️
THIS brilliant  to see Princess children doing this like caring about others God bless them.all.❤
How can a person like Princess Catherine be racis? I strongly support her. She is epitome of empowerment
Absolutely wonderful, teach them when young makes all the difference 👏🏻👏🏻🇬🇧
Princess Catherine is a terrific mother to show her children the gift of caring about others.
God Bless them. Action speaks louder.
This is beautiful. This is what Christmas really is about. Spending time with family and helping others.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Great work, well done to all
Can I deposit my baby here and have 1.05 babies in a years time?
Just adorable children and Catherine, Princess of Wales is an example to everyone. I'll donate👏👏👏😊🇬🇧
A lovely family and a lovely reminder of what this season is truly about. It's nice that Princess Catherine and Prince William allow us a glimpse of their beautiful children, and we see them growing into kind and giving people. And yes, there seems to be a lot of the late Queen in Princess Charlotte!
Merry Christmas 🎄
Amazing ❤

Such a good cause this time of the year! They are so inspirational to all of us that are privileged to give!
This is beautiful, brought tears to my eyes. Bless the POW and the Royal Family ❤
How truly fantastic and inspiring the Princess of Wales and her children working together to create a Happy Christmas for children not as fortunate as many. I think it’s truly wonderful that the children are participating at a young age, they truly are a wonderful family. Lessons that are learned by doing. 🫶🥰🇬🇧🇺🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
how beautiful and sweet that they care and do such human actions
❤ that's such a nice thing to do especially at Christmas time, showing love and compassion to others, and supporting those in time's of need ❤ Merry Christmas to you all 😊 ...
that's so nice please do the same for children in GAZA
How lovely! Such a special family and George, Charlotte, and Louis are absolutely precious! ❤
I love how many toys Louis has crammed into his bag! 😊
"This is Welsh"  😂
I'm a baby boomer 75,  so my early years was  post war UK.  Toys were re-cycled, hidden away about November, repainted\secondhand\dolls house (that sort of thing)  Dolls lips repainted & new clothes made by mum,  I remember a very old typewriter, who knows where it came from, Noah probably had it on the ark - painted light blue.... as I recall so was the kitchen. Old stocking with an apple & orange and other fruit & candy-shapes.  WOULDN'T CHANGE those MEMORIES for the world.
She is so personable and kind. I love that she does these things with her kids.
Love how George wants to come back ❤❤  catherine doing an excellent job of raising a future King.
Wonderful to see this, what a lovely family.
Lovely children, lovely family. 🎄
The Princess of Wales is such a beautiful Mother in all ways. How wonderful she is raising the future King and heads of the Monarchy!
God bless prince of the wale amen
Like mother, like daughter and sons. Warm, kind and empathic.  💓
This is what it's all about. Amen.
Meghan and Harry have taken this away from their kids to be able to go and help their cousins to do work like  this for people of England.....
💝💝💝💝💝💝
This is such a lovely heartwarming video. Something to watch over and over again. Thank you!
These children seemed to be very mindful with their intentions of what they were doing and what they were selecting ❤❤ Job guys!!!
What an amazing video! It helps to motivate others to do great things in theirs community . Many blessings 💕🙏
Well done children, well done 👏🏻
Beautiful… I am proud of your Wales’ family
Wonderful. These  kids are the future of the monarchy and already  have an ingrained  sense of duty. Blessed
Reminds me of the days watching Diana take the boys to various community support events. So pleased to see William and Kate continuing that selfless legacy. They are a family the UK can be proud of.
GOOD JOB KATE. SHOWING THE KIDS HOW TO DO IT .
Love this ❤🇦🇺👏
Wow what a lovely family
What a shining example.
Excellent mother😇
Great to see children learning to give to others most important lesson in life.  Be a better person.
God bless prince of the wale amen
Just Waaw amazing
Whenever I see Princess Catherine in action with her Children, I feel uplifted.  God bless them.
Princess Diana would be so thrilled to see her wonderful grandchildren volunteering to help others. Her legacy lives on.
G*d Bless this beautiful family🎄for helping put Christ back into Christmas❤And a huge thanks to all who think of & support others over the festive season🧸🎈✨⛄️❄️✨🎁🎄✨🕯
God bless prince of the wale amen
I LOVE LOUIS!!! this little boy its so funny , charismatic
How lovely to get the children involved. The family is so genuine and in touch with life. What a Prince and Princess of Wales we have
This is an example of a humble perfect family with a perfect upbringing. Content with who they are. Blessings to them. May they flourish with great joy.
May all that you do inspire all of us to do more. There is always something or sometime we can donate to people in need.
Fantastic Children - with brilliant parents.  A credit to the Royal Family and our Nation.  Thank you for your service.
That was truly beautiful!
👍💥💥💥👋💖💖💖✊✊✊👼👼👼
Great jobs Princess Charlotte, and Princes George and Louis. Looks like they enjoyed doing this and good to see them be encouraged to be helping people less well off than them. Good lessons in life for them. Great parenting Catherine, Princess of Wales. 💖
Princess Catherine is the epitome of love and kindness. God bless her soul. I live in a Commonwealth country, and I’m proud to say that she will be our Queen one day. Merry Christmas to all❤❤❤.
Fantastic to see this. Thank you.
Good for her for getting her children out young and teaching them what it is to help others who are less fortunate...great lessons at a young age will last a lifetime...Great job Princess Catherine!!
Eso niños los enseñan para servir al pueblo a las instituciones qué sus padres representan y está muy bien. Dios los bendiga 🙏
Much love❤
Well done!
👏
❤
ARRÊTEZ VOUS. KATZ EST TROP MENSONGE ET TROP COPIE BIEN AIMÉ MEGHAN.  ARRETE KATE CA SUFFIT
❤❤❤❤
How beautiful 😍 Thank you for all you do ... Bless your babies for their beautiful lil hearts 💕
It looks like the kids had fun volunteering! Beautiful family
So wonderful to see your children being raised to be thoughtful, caring, helpful of those in need. They are so cute.
Beautiful.  This truly brought tears to my eyes.
Such a great family 😊
This is the family that King Charles should be looking after .
How beautiful watching the children learning that to give back to people is a wonderful feeling ❤
I hope there are plates being thrown in Monteshitshow watching this😂😂
Bless them  they are  learning to enjoy  doing for  others so that they realize they are lucky . BRILLIANT FAMILY  . ❤❤❤❤❤
This is so lovely ❤️
❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏Well done Katherine.  I know how hard to get the kids to behave and be enthusiastic in public engagements outside their comfortable and privileged space. George,  Charlotte and Louis seemed enthusiastic and authentic in enjoying themselves.  So, it shows that its something taught and practiced at home also. Praying for you and family in a role God chose for you and the act of service and love is what we are all called for.  Strength, perseverance and protection for the Wales family.
I am from Austria and adore Princes of Wales and her work for charity’s ❤
It’s a brilliant way too teach the children that other children aren’t as fortunate as they are & that they can help others from a very early age & then onwards throughout their lives. Beautiful children learning lessons for life from their beautiful parents. Happy Christmas everyone 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Well done George Charlotte and Louis and Catherine ❤
Thank you for raising the next generation of British Royals to be so mindful and kind.
Very sweet
Their voice makes me smile.
This is absolutely LOVELY! I love that her childrren are engaging so young in helping others and SEE that others NEED things that they might have and enjoy. Bless them and MERRY CHRISTMAS ALL....
❤️❤️❤️❤❤❤
This was such a beautiful thing to watch. I am sitting here crying bc of just how wonderful this is. William and Catherine are doing such a wonderful job in raising their children to help and respect others.
I think this is such a beautiful family!! Catherine, the Princess of Wales is doing a great job with the upbringing of her family!! God bless them and protect them from evil people that are aiming to harm them.
Wow - wonderful. Princessin Charlottes laughter - so sweet. Lovely children, wonderful initiative.. It is so sad, that we have no Monarchy in Germany 🤣🤣😉😉😍😍
💝💞 Happy Holidays!
Ahhhh....... well done everyone.  The children seemed to be enjoying it.
Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful Princess Katherine.
I want to see more videos like this with Wales family. It's just so beautiful to watch. It warmed my heart, and I know it does to a lot of people all over the world!!! ❤❤❤
She is a wonderful mom teaching her children about helping others. She has class and grace. She will be a great Queen one day.
Love this!
Heartwarming
I love you guys so much!❤❤️ Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas!❤️🎄 I'll be donating to the Baby Bank from America!🥰
Beautiful. Thank you, Catherine, Princess of Wales and to the Princes and Princess. Wonderful!
I love the children serving as the personal shoppers.  Kids know kids.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The children of Gaza are now dying from the cold. Protect the children of Gaza 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👶
Beautifull gesture! Beautifull family! Children learn better by their parents' example. Good job. Keep going❤💪💪
Beautiful family ❤️
Thankyou Catherine for being you and raising your children with awareness of the world around them 💖💖💖
My those children are beautiful, inside and out. I love Kate and Lottie's relationship.  They are too cute together.
Diane would be so pleased.
George and Charlotte grew up overnight! Louis is still growing, but George is catching up to Kate’s height and pretty sure he’s probably taller than me because I’m only 5”0. 😂😂😂
Absolutely lovely!
Wow. Heartbreaking to hear how many families are in need of support, but how wonderful to see that there are organizations such as this one. What a beautiful video and initiative
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just love this family more and more. From “overseas” 🇺🇸
The Princess of Wales and her family ate just really really great people!!! Princess Catherines voice is so lovely and warm! Lots of love from Salzburg 🎄❄️☀️☃️🥰👋🏼🇦🇹
If you’re donating to a local baby bank…don’t forget teenagers…they’re often overlooked.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Such a worthwhile cause, thank you for sharing.
Beautiful kids. Love from Italy 🇮🇹
Thank you Princess Catherine for teaching your children how hard life can be for so many other children.
Ooh and look...no ostentatious jewellery  or designer bags on show
Woow. What a role model. She has really brought them up beautifully 😍
Wow this is just amazing! Thank you Kate and William for creating a future Royal family that is thankful for their blessings and in touch with what the people need. I must admit I got a tear in my eye. 👌
It is so wonderful to see parents teaching their children the value of helping others. I know that this is part of their learning their duties as Royals when the grow up, but it is a lesson that should be taught to everyone. The children looked like they were really enjoying helping out. Prince George picking out gifts with the most sincere serious expression to get what a child his age might want, Princess Charlotte is a little mini Catherine. She was working hard and spreading laughter sand Prince Louis was really into listening and learning! A very lovely video!
If only every country had a monarchy! Why? Because it wouldn't be a generation of lying politicians trying to fool the people from right and left. A noble, believing family, who would rule by birth with such media coverage, would mean much more to a society.
Love how she and the charity  are getting the kids involved  already teaching them the difference  between and others along with empathy ❤❤❤
Good for her, even though it was Meghan's idea, and  Meghan did this a couple of years ago.
Lovely to see they are helping out and seeing another side of life. Katherine is a wonderful mother.
Oh my heart.....I can't...they are so precious, bless the Waleses!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
And did you notice that Catherine did NOT wear $20,000 worth of jewelry while doing this, unlike some other person I could mention.  I always did something similar to this with my children each year with a charity local to us that helps local families.  These types of experiences will serve these children well throughout their lives.  Those children may be privileged, but they don't  seem like they are spoiled.
Amazing.
My Queen♥️♥️♥️♥️
They are not living in poverty, they are very poor, the two things are wholly different.
This was wonderful to watch, absolutely wonderful ❤️  God Bless the Wales Family
We are so lucky to have Kate as our future Queen & William, they are clearly teaching their children that there is another side of life completely different to their own privilege life. Thank goodness we have a monarchy in waiting that are far more in touch with the reality of normal life.
This is such an absolutely beautiful thing that The Princess of Wales and her children are doing in giving to others in need. The children are already working royals-love it! She is such a tremendous mum.👑❤
I love this idea. I had so much baby stuff to donate but struggled to find anywhere to take it
I love how delighted Princess Charlotte was to find a Welsh patterned babygrow, she seemed genuinely excited 😊
God bless Princess Catherine for donating her time to this charity,  and also for teaching her children, who were born to privilege, to always help and think of others whom might be in need.   To see this speaks volumes as to her character, and also to her most important job of all, that of being a mother. Job well done, Catherine!   From one mother to another, ((hugs)).
A heart warming video especially when George, Charlotte & Louise add a person touch with a hand written message to the recipients of the Christmas presents.  🎄✨🎄✨🎄
Princess Catherine and the Wales family are amazing.  I love seeing how close knitted they are. Great to see them out and about and doing their bit for Christmas.
They are so sweet and serious you want to cuddle them all, Charlothe , Georg and Louise
Sending so much love to this family from the US and wishing you a very Merry Christmas! 🎄 ❤
This is so perverse. Symbols of entrenched privilege marketing themselves through acts of ‘generosity’ towards those whose necks their boot rests upon so as to further entrench their privilege and maintain the status quo. Bit of a mouthful I know, but that’s how the princess likes it…or so I’ve heard😮
Aww so sweet❤❤
Beautiful video 🥰❤️🥰Catherine Princess of Wales with her gorgeous children, teaching compassion for others less fortunate & highlighting charities that help so many 🥰❤️🥰
george is sooo big already!! i remember when he was a little little baby!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This really touched my heart. These future king and queens are learning what's like to help others in need. What great Parents they have for teaching them this at a young age. You can't even tell they're royals here. Great job William and Kate. We love you :-)❤👑
Truly heartwarming. Happy Christmas 🎄
Absolutely Wonderful !! The Royal Family already make the World a Better Place ! How lovely for the Royal Children to spend time at "Baby Banks" at Christmas !! Love it ! Thank you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The kids are really enjoying themselves getting stuck in there.bless them ❤
This is the most beautiful and heartwarming thing I have ever seen
Princess Catherine is such an amazing and loving wife of Prince William and loving mother of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis and loving daughter in law of King Charles and Princess Diana. The Royal family are so blessed to have Princess Catherine in their family. Thank you Lord for Princess Catherine and Prince William their both amazing couple.❤❤❤❤
Love this and seeing the children growing up so well rounded is such a blessing.  May God Bless the Cambridges.
What a wonderful tradition for PW PC Kids to do for Xmas. PG, PC, PG picking out toys, clothes for poor children.. A wonderful experience for PC and kids. British people are very blessed to have RF that is HELPING so many. ❣️❣️❣️
Well done .
Great family learning to GIVE   Not  TAKE  Catherine’s a fantastic intelligent caring mother three   Children she can be proud of ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Princess Catherine is such an amazing woman ❤❤❤❤
Wonderful! ❤❤❤
Oh bless them, such adorable children who know they are privileged but have concern for others due to their parents caring nature. I just love 🩷 William and Catherine and their beautiful children.
This has brought tears to my eyes. Catherine is such a genuine and lovely person. It’s wonderful to see the children joining in.
The future of the British Monarchy is in safe hands with Prince William and Princess Catherine and their children at the helm.
Just when you think it is impossible to fall any more in love with Catherine. What a marvellous initiative. Watch and learn, Mrs Harkle. Watch and learn.
your a very special women kate
Thankyou guys for everything you do and happy Christmas x
Lovely to hear their voices
❤❤❤
Love it. She is the princess of the hearts and down to earth. Teaching her children to give back is the most important thing. Beautiful family. Merry Christmas to you all 🎄
WOW!!!!  what beautiful wonderful amazing kids the Wales’ are❤️❤️❤️   You can tell they truly care for what they are doing for this organization!!!  The Royal Family and Monarchy are in such wonderful strong hands and hearts with the two future kings and future queen, and princess and prince!!!🇬🇧
Absolutely love this, can't believe how quickly the children are growing though, I am defo growing old!! My goodness, just a really lovely video.
😍😍😍
Blessings!
Lovely…
Big ❤ for the Wales family from France
You are just wonderful Princess Katherine and your children are just so lovely. Bravo to you and Prince William for all that you do. Merry Christmas!
I love how Princess Catherine has her kids involved in this with her. They will learn empathy and compassion for others less fortunate. This will help them be grounded and well rounded, now and as adults. Great parents her and Prince William.
I’m American and this personifies what the royal family means to me❤
I'm from the U.S. but I love Wales'...and look at Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis... all grown up and giving of themselves like their parents 🥰🥰🥰
Absolutely wonderful. ❤
Thank you so much for everything you do 🙏❤️am in floods of tears here and prayers being said for struggling families  (including my own.) We love you all so deeply! God bless And Merry Christmas. May we hope for everlasting  peace on Earth. 🕯❄️🌲
❤❤❤❤❤❤
How nice for her to get out of Buckingham palace and help us poor folks lol
❤❤❤❤
How sweet and such a good example!❤
Wonderful
All the more reason to applaud Catherine,  Princess of Wales.  She, and those around her, are raising a future king of England.  That will be the burden Prince George.  Getting "real" as it were, both for Prince George,  but also Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis,  demonstrates what is the duty that the Royal Family are tasked with: being responsible for the care of all in the Commonwealth.  So many seem to forget that much of the British Empires charity system is based on the patronages, foundations, and a desire to serve: take the RF out of England and the affect is likely to make Brexit look like a walk in the park.
Helping out others. She’s teaching them so well.
Precious and lovely family ❤❤❤❤
These children will be well rounded and in touch with the world more than those before them. Thanks to Princess Katherine!
.....🎄Absolutely beautiful seeing the 3 children are genuinely wanting to be involved in such an important cause , how happy  they all are and being raised by amazing parents .......it shows ❤🇨🇦❤
It was amazing to see how the 3 royal children are really helping, and the fact Prince George wants to go back to do it again is wonderful. the princess of wales and Prince William are raising their children to be kind loving human beings.  I love all the working royals ❤.  They do work hard . Thank you for filming this.
I think that I’ve never heard the actual voices of the royal children yet, that was kind of a shock, I’m really used to see them, but I’ve never heard them talking, they seem really nice and well educated, I’m really really fond of these royal generations!
My gosh! You can see both William and Diana, very strongly in all of those children. God bless the Royal family this Christmas 🎄
❤❤❤❤
Diana would be proud of her daughter-in-law and grandchildren!  Never forget the "little (real) people".
Hi. I'm from Latvia, but have been living in England for 5 years.  I'm big fan of Kate.  It's so nice to see you doing so good things ❤ God bless your family 🙏
Wonderful.
Just love this family and applaud how much they care and work to help others ❤
The princess of wales is the epitome of a future queen 👸
I love how the royal children are helping, they are so genuine and caring.
It is heartwarming to see the children being involved in helping others less fortunate.
You're doing such good work! God bless your family!
Beautiful souls! Brought a tear to my eye.  I hope everyone will have a Happy Christmas and may the new year be better for all of us! ❤
Amazing way to teach your children! Wonderful mother!!

Dear princess of Wales, you are the people’s princess here in USA 🇺🇸 we love and adore you, you will make an amazing queen 👸 😢
What an amazing example of service and giving your time to help others….kids love to be involved and help and feel useful so this is a great way to teach them how to live a life of service
Reminds of Princess Diana with her children…
❤
This is a great way to showcase one of the many initiatives the public can get involved in to give back during Christmas season ❤
What a wonderful example for parents and the children of all ages to learn from in encouraging kindness, compassion, giving of yourselves to others less fortunate.❤ This should always be reflected not only in this season but through our daily lives. Kind hearts are rewarded in due time when least expected! JESUS IS THE REASON FOR ALL SEASONS! 🙏🎄💜
I particularly like that Catherine, Princess of Wales is including her 3 children in this charitable activity.
yup
Terrific job, mommy Catherine!! You are  RAISING WONDERFUL HEALTHY CHILDREN!!!
Let your good work speak for yourself...
What an amazing video thankyou Katherine POW and family
Charlotte has Kate’s mannerisms to a T!
Brilliant ❤ Nice to see.  I do get the feeling that Mrs. Carparkle is getting her trainers on for another pap outing.
Nice work. 💖
Me entro una basurita en el ojo 🥲
Simply, precious. ♥️🇺🇸❤️🇬🇧
Such a wonderful mother who came along with her beloved children to involve them with charity work 👏👏👏  Love it ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

The things Katherine and William do for people often brings tears to my eyes. GOD BLESS
😂This is what people want to see royals taking part like Diana did here's to the future!!😅🎉❤❤
Amazing work everyone 🩵💕
Yeiiiiiii🎉🎉🎉🎉
Thanks for being a light of hope and virtue in this turbulent time. It’s funny that you are not only bringing joy to the UK, the world is feeling grateful to have this family setting an example for serving others and communities.  Stay safe and stay happy
Absolutely love this, such a beautiful family ❤
We are so fortunate to have the Princess of Wales, she demonstrates genuinely kindness and does so effortlessly.
Aww being British living in America, this made me so Proud. Thank you, Princess Catherine, Prince George, Princess Charlotte & Prince Louis. This is lovely what you are doing. Can you thank King Charles for me many years ago he saved my Mum's Life in Malta I am not sure he will remember it's a memory of my mum's I will never forget. ❤
Que lindo gente 😍😍😍😍😍😍
What a wonderful family 😊❤
What an amazing thing to do very well done you are all amazing ❤❤❤
Wonderful! So genuine and helpful... what a blessing these children are! Thank you to the Princess of Wales and her family for doing this!
❤❤❤❤❤
We are so fortunate to have the Royal family (Canadian here)
❤️
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤
The UK and the commonwealth are so fortunate to have Catherine. We’ve nothing like her in the US. What an exceptional role model she is. 🇺🇸
Wonderful example Princess of Wales Catherine and George, Charlotte and Louis ❤❤❤❤❤
What a beautiful video! The Princess of Wales is a wonderful, kind-hearted lady! It's very sweet to see her with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis helping the children have a nice christmas❤
It seems like she’s teaching them what Diana tried to teach her sons. That is, you may be privileged but not everyone is. Just because you’re privileged doesn’t mean you shouldn’t help others and it definitely means you shouldn’t treat others differently. Hopefully they lead a life of charity.
❤❤❤😊
Bravo princesse Catherine et les enfants ❤👍👏👏👏
4k views in 40 minutes and 4k 👍... Simply the best.
I really love this family… God bless u❤
Absolutely wonderful 🥹💜
Lovely seeing the beautiful children and so well behaved and thoughtful. 💖💖💖
❤❤❤
God bless them 🥰🙏🏾💐👏🏾
Take care first of your own family, your blood brother, and your sister-in-law and their family!!!.  God is the God of Love and Justice!!!
The richest family in the country playing at caring.
Omg! X❤
❤❤❤❤❤
The Wales Family is the embodiment of compassion! God bless you all!
It's so nice to see Catherine, carrying on traditions in helping those who are less fortunate.  Her children will do the same.
Catherine will be an extraordinary Queen Consort. She is so solid, empathetic, smart, talented, she bends down with 4 inch heels 😱 and gets right back up. Kidding aside, she is a great mother and role model to her children and they are already so well behaved. She’s the daughter-in-law that Diana would be so proud of.
This is so precious 🥰🥹🙏
So beautiful❤❤❤❤
What a wonderful job you guys are doing! Happy that UK has you and your family! Keep up the amazing work!
Simply Perfect Every Time.  The Wales Family Do give Back time and time again.
O my, those kids are so big now!
A great opportunity for the Wales children to give back to the local community.
Great initiative!! Wonderful to see that ❤👍❤ Nice job those children did and their mum is a 👑 queen!
What a beautiful family ❤
I'm pleased she took the children. It's so important that they learn there are other children who are not as lucky or as privileged.
A marvellous and valuable life lesson for everyone involved. You are all first rate❤
Aren't they a lovely family?
She is really training them to have empathy and care for others. What a great mom.
What a good mama. I’ve been super impressed with her from the start. England is lucky to have her.
Oh my gosh. This family is just beautiful. ❤
ohh prince george is sweet and getleman there helping his sister with paper bags... sweet big brother
Gosh, it's just like Kate and her children are just real people....hats off to William and Kate....they are going to be  great as King and Queen....Di and the Middletons raised fine people...🇺🇸 🇬🇧
💜
The children are so awesome - thanks to their wonderful parents!
Que fofura grau máximo!!❤
Excellent  and beautifully  done👏👏👏👏👑👑👑🎄🎁
Now this is how to raise children properly.  Well done.  American here by accident of birth but extremely proud of my 93.6% British dna.
So wonderful ❤
Beautiful family ❤
very down to earth  royal family   helping  out  kids  in need
Love everything about this ❤❤❤
This is what boots on the ground looks like....wish we had an administration that did things like this. Where's our first Lady and her family? How are they contributing to all the homeless families in our country?
She and the kid are a wonderful family and cheers also to extraordinary work of all the volunteers involved which are not that famous but count as much ❤Blessing to all !
I think Meghan should learn something from Catherine.
Why not help the parents. Why not end poverty. Why do they keep helping but never fix any problems
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Simply lovely.
Bravo to the spectacular Princess of Wales! God bless the Wales family!
So, proud to see the Future Queen Consort Catherine, Future King George Vll, Future Princess Royal and Future Duke of York working for such a beautiful charity and i think William is such a lucky man, he did the best thing by marrying Catherine.
❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘
This is one of THE best videos you have produced.  An example of what, and how, everyone can help!
You can see Grandmother Diana, Grandfather Charles, Mumny and Daddy, and The Middletons in these children. They are being rsised well.
Princess Charlotte is going to be a beauty like her mama. She's such a little lady. ❤
Just like Williams mother showed him and talk him about the plight of the homeless, Catherine is teaching her children about the very young children who are less fortunate.  Bless them all for highlighting this, and I saw they brought some stuff of their own for the children as well.  These children are going to be as kind and loving just like their mother and father.  Beautiful family. God Bless them all.
Lovely video ❤
George, Louis and Charlotte have zero idea of the maximum level of privilege they've been born into. It's not their fault. Diana did Harry and William a HUGE service by humbling them. I'm really glad to see Kate carry on Diana's legacy.
So proud! words can not cover it! So proud!
Georges voice 🥹
How wonderful of Catherine to have the children involved in this way. Teaches them so much. I love this family x
I love these videos!! So sweet to see the kids joining the princess. 💗
A beautiful family. She is going to be an amazing queen one day.
Good job.
Omg!!! How cute is this 💗
This is so wonderful! What a beautiful charity.
Greetings from USA....I love the way how the Princess of Wales taking her children to teach them how important to help poor people in need.   I am glad the Wales children was able to support the charities.   It is nice to see them doing their tasks without any complain.     Thank you very much.
My wish is to do the same when my son is old enough. What a fantastic initiative!!
prince george really looks like his dad!!!
Nice video thank you.
WOW WOW WOW... this is so sweet and heartwarming, great initiative and I love the children's reactions to the toys! just priceless.. The princess of Wales and her family are so amazing!
I bet they have so much fun together
Sweetness GALORE! ❤
Q Deus me ajude
Thank you very much Princess Catherine for shedding light to such an organisation. I pray more people will come support this noble cause of bringing smiles to countless unfortunate children
Brought tears to my eyes seeing them work together to help others. May god bless them always.
This is how you raise children. Teaching them how help others and caring for other people. Love that the princess of Wales is doing this with her beautiful children. I wish tje video was a bit longer. We all enjoy these amazing children. ❤❤❤❤
I loved it!❤ its perfect for teaching them about others and also getting toys for children their age.
So wonderful watching the kids picking toys for children their age . Helping their mom with this charity 🙏 thank you for all the good you are doing
Amazing family. Will be proud to call Catherine Princess of Wales our Queen on day. This is teal service.
Wonderful👑🎄🎅🏻
This is such a lovely video! It's so good that the kiddos already have their introduction to the charities that their mom and dad do❤️
This is amazing!❤ On the side note, the camera is too shaky. I know handheld camera brings more genuine/natural aspect to a film/video, but in this video it's a bit much. I'm honestly kinda dizzy watching it
Grounded kids.
These kids will group normal, down to earth, and kind. That's the result of good parenting.
This is so wonderful!  Thank you so much Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales and Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis!  God Bless!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
God Bless the Princess of Wales ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow, just wow. How can I help you guys? ❤️
Unforgettable memories! Catherine Princess of Wales, You’re doing an outstanding job in the most important role as a mom! From one mom to another I feel so proud!
How the precious children have grown, especially Prince George. Such a responsible young man 😊
She's awesome  mom  and PRINCESS ❤😊
Beautiful family, these adorable children are being raised so well by their wonderful parents. Loved this!
I love the idea of involving the children in this! Amazing!! ♥️
Lovely thing to do x
It is wonderful to see the kids involved in charity events.. They are being well brought up…😊
Those children really  Helped. They put their hearts Into it❤❤❤
This is what the late Princess of Wales used to do: bring the children with her, let them experience and make them understand. I'm so touched to see the Wales children there with Princess Catherine continuing this line of service and duty.
Beautiful and heartwarming video that reminds us Christmas is about helping others and even more lovely that this sentiment doesnt go unrecognized The Wales Family. ❤❤❤
Great to see .. how you raise great human beings
Not much time for the Royals But this is Joyous  Helping the Underprivileged   💞💕
How beautiful. Such sweet children really enjoying checking out the toys, so wholesome and perfect ❤
Absolutely lovely ❤
Sweet Lord Jesus, just when I thought I couldn't love her more!
The way to do it
The kids really enjoyed soing this. They are a beautiful family!
How absolutely amazing. ❤
Beautiful ❤
This is awesome. Very heartwarming
It's great to see the children helping and learning that they can enjoy their life yet still have compassion and help others. I believe these three will do some great things as they get older and pull in their cousins to help.  The Phillips, Tindalls, Mapelli Mozzis and Brooksbanks. That's quiet a solid crew
Мне 51год и не раз дорили подарки на новый год может в детцтве пару раз и всё.родители самые замечательнве у меня  мамы нет уже😢.спасибо принцеса ты делаеш огромное дело для детей❤❤❤❤
This is really lovely that they are expose to this and are made to HELP AND UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SO MANY LESS FORTUNATE PEOPLE AND CHILDREN THAT HAVE NOTHING. KEEP THIS IP Catherine till they reach their adult years. This will make them much more grounded, aware with hearts of concerns for the less fortunate . Hats OFF princess of Wales and the royals WALES'S for a job well done!!
Imagine Meghan, Merchie and Lillibucks doing the same. 🙄
Love this ❤️
❤❤
What a wonderful family.
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful family!!!!!
This was so heartwarming to see they are learning to care for other people… great job !👏
Whoa!  That was so touching🥰
Great job , respectful family ❤
The kids fold clothes better than I do!😊 Wonderful to see.
You’re remarkable!! The children we’re really into it good job ❤ You’re a remarkable Princess and Mother ❤
OMG!!! I almost lol hearing Prince George say, “yeah”.  I guess being American I would expect the future King to say, “yes, Mummy”. I swear he is so adorable. My grandchildren are his age.
Best mom ever! HRH
What a beautiful VIDEO!!! .
It is so heartwarming to see the Wasle children helping others and being made aware of families less well off than theirs
That's Royalty at it's best. Catherine shines 💖
Thank you for highlighting this and many other amazing charities. ❤
What a wonderful family !
Great to teach your children to be kind and think of others.Diana did this as well.👏👏🙏💕

The Middletons are a class act and have brought so much to the RF in the form of Princess Catherine that has been wonderfully brought up. ♥️♥️🇬🇧👑
Wonderful ❤
What a great initiative. I love how she is teaching her children to care for and help others in need. ❤
Lovely family ❤
I 💙 Louis and that "big guy" gorilla! His bag was stuffed full. 😌
Great cause and lovely video of the Wales children getting involved
I don't even know what  to write. Absolutely amazing ❤
God bless the Wales! Much love
🥲  It makes me feel so proud of the Royal children and  their parents, and I'm an American!
❤❤
The sweetest video. Getting the kids involved is beautiful!
The Prince and Princess of Wales are the most wonderful caring parents teaching their children how to help others less fortunate. It’s lovely to see how well they work together and were really helping do everything themselves. What a wonderful future the Monarchy has. 💜🎄🎅🏼🎁
Catherine the Princess of Wales always does everything so PERFECT !
So wonderful! ❤❤❤
So lovely! A future king and siblings serving others.

It’s truly beautiful to see caring people working together for such a good cause. How lucky they were on this particular day to have such excellent help. All of you working together is heartwarming. We’re never to young to help.  It’s just lovely to see.
UK is so lucky ❤
Teach them from young about the spirit of giving.  Truly heartwarming.
What sweet children, so cute too, thank you for your sacrifices and services to the Wales family and all of the Royal Family, we appreciate, respect and love you ❤
Lovely and inspiring. Such a sweet family. 🎄♥️✨
Growing up, my parents always had my brother and I help out at the holidays putting together food boxes, gifts and treats for families.  I worked for a fire department, we adopted families and collected toys and brought Christmas gifts to families in our area.  So wonderful and the best way to celebrate the season and help others out.  Thank you to the Princess of Wales and her children for doing their part to support parents and families who need the extra help this Chirstmas season.  And thank you for bringing back wonderful memories for me.  Happy Christmas!
Lovely ☺️ We must love each other.
I'm glad the Wales' are including the children in some initiatives.
I feel great pride in this wonderful Royal family . They're like a beacon reminding our country about what is important .
What a wonderful video!! So heartwarming
That is so fantastic! Thank you…❤
A great cause for those in need.
Princess Catherine you sure are a great Mum, your children are really delightful helping with Christmas presents for under privileged children, you show them how rewarding it is to help others, i wish you all z fantastic Christmas 🎄 ❤
"This is a big guy!" Prince Louis 🦍🦍🦍🦍
I got goosebumps. It is such a great and selfless thing to do and makes a huge impact. I'm in America and I just admire Prince William and Princess Catherine. I love how they are involving their children in initiatives like this one. They truly seem to be good people.
Your lives and your work have an impact on so many Thank you Princess Catherine, Prince William and your beautiful children ❤
Time to teach is, when they are young, These children where having fun picking out what they would like, to give to other children. I would say, This is perfect Santa Helpers. My daughter and I, just last week went threw closet of grandchildren to see what was to small but gently used, also toys and books out grown, donated to local church far closet that helps families in need.
❤❤❤❤❤
Wonderful initiative! Love seeing the kids during Christmas time.
I love everything about this video! Absolutely heartwarming and beautiful
Those children are so well behaved and polite, a credit to their parents. They get stuck in and Catherine explains what it's for and why it's important. It looks like they brought donations from home too. How worthwhile.
Love you all so much ❤❤❤
This is so amazing.
❤❤❤❤❤
EXCELLENT!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loved this so much. The children are so well behaved and were genuinely involved in the work. You can tell they are being raised well. I saw Diana’s spirit in all this. Kudos to the Princess of Wales
Seriously impress by the Wales children knuckling down and helping sorting the mound of donation , I am sure the parcels are going to bring much joy to the recipients 🥰
Thank you for sharing this. Good Showing what children around the world can be doing.
Thank you to the beautiful Wales family from New Zealand. KiaKaha Catherine (Maori: stay strong). We love you.
Good on them, learning life lessons that will make them better people.
OUR  PRINCESS  OF  WALES  CATHERINE  IS  SOOOO  CARING  AND  DUTIFUL  WONDERFUL
This just warmed my heart! Such a beautiful thing to see and wonderful to know about the work the charity does and how it impacts others.
❤
Está hermosa familia son realmente agradecidos por compartir con los más necesitados. Saber que, haber nacido en una familia tan importante conlleva un gran trabajo en unión familiar. Felicidades a los Príncipes de Gales por educar a sus hijos y enseñarles valores humanos, que es lo que nuestro mundo necesita… amor, compasión y respeto por el prójimo.
"You see how rewarding it is to help others" Princess of Wales❤❤❤❤❤❤
God bless the Prince and Princess of Wales and their beautiful children.
I'm a Brazilian living in the USA , I have no connections to the UK , But I think the British Monarchy is such a gift, specially this family! The way they support charities, highlight problems without any political dog in the race warms my heart. Thank you to the Wales Family and for those who volunteer around the world
Such a wonderful initiative. Merry Christmas. ❤
I love her!❤
Oh so lovely. Made me tear up. 🇨🇦😢
meanwhile the Sussex couple teaches their children that they need to be called prince and princess.... and how to disrespect their family elders', how to publicly humiliate one's family, and include third parties in the process...
The more I see these children,  the more I love them. They're being brought up to understand they have s privileged life but that others amongst us are not as fortunate. It reminds me of how Diana used to take William and Harry to homeless shelters when they were young. It looks like William took heed judging by him selling The Big Issue the other day and showing his children what life can be like for those less fortunate. William and Catherine show kindness, warmth, compassion and humilty.What a shame that Harry doesn't share any of those traits.
It makes ya wanna cry.
Great Job!
Absolutely wonderful parenting! The monarchy is in safe hands for generations to come.❤
👏👏👏👏❤❤❤
This is so lovely.  Thank you Baby Banks for all you do. Thank you to the Royal Family for having a giving heart.  I am from the United States and I absolutely admire you all.
Brilliant to see how happy and excited George, Charlotte and Louis are to be helping. It warms my heart. Happy Christmas to all!
Bless Princess Catherine.  What an outstanding mother teaching her children about giving back.  About helping people who need a helping hand.  Incredible!  Bless the Wales family as I'm sure Prince William is in full support of his wife and children.  Just beautiful!
This is amazing!!  What a wonderful, caring family.  The children are all so grounded. Fantastic family!!
How incredible, that's what I love about William and Catherine involving children in causes that are important to society ❤
Love seeing a whole family volunteer together!  The Firm is in good hands Ma'am
What a moving and beautiful initiative. The royal children clearly had a wonderful time and really got stuck in. I hope that the children who receive these gifts are able to enjoy them
Wonderful video! Thank you for posting. 💕👑💕
God Bless em all. Look what a difference it made to Will when his mum took him to projects that helped out. These three children will remember when they are older and hopefully get involved themselves.
We love the Prince & Princess of Wales. It’s so lovely to see the Princess getting her children involved in helping other families that are struggling. 🇺🇸❤ 🇬🇧
Beautiful family!
These children are having the best childhood and the best upbringing of any previous royal children in history. George is going to be a wonderful King because of it and Charlotte and Louis will stand by him and play their own special parts.
OHMYGOSH ...MY HEART 🙌
❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏
Important, foundational experience for the children. This is excellent
Love love this family! Our Princess Catherine ❤
Warms the heart , good work 🎉 Happy to see your lovely children busily helping out ❤
This is so amazing. They are already making a difference. Giving back to the English people. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
absolutely fantastic. the spirit of christmas flowing into the next generation. beautiful family.
Absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much for helping and showing the hard work these charities do.
This is absolutely beautiful! Thank you for sharing, giving, and teaching your children to do the same. Love from the U.S.
, wath a great idea to get her children  involved. This is a lovely idea , Catherine is an inspiration to all wemon out here ❤️
Diana's legacy. Just as she took her boys to volunteer, so are her grandchildren learning compassion and volunteerism. The ripple effect.🌟
Thank you Baby Banks for everything you do.💛 Thank you, Princess of Wales, for giving your support to this organization and continuing the cycle of volunteering. Bring your children to volunteer will help them in their conviction to volunteer and will hopefully inspire others to also volunteer and give. Thank you.
Seeing charity first hand. Learning yo give back feels good. What wonderful parents the Prince and Princess of Wales truly are. Leading by example. Giving their children a well-rounded experience.   Princess Catherine is a hands-on mom.  I admire her so much.  It can not be easy raising her children to be good people living in a fish bowl
Absolutely brilliant seeing the children helping, a wonderful cause.😘
This is wonderful. Your children are so precious. You do so much good for children in need, and involving your own children will give them such a firm foundation for the future lives as royals. Merry Christmas to you all ❤❤❤❤❤
Gorgeous family, thank you for sharing, wishing you a Merry Christmas  x
Beautiful! Thank you beautiful Princess!
What a wonderful trip for the children to take with their mother!  What a blessing for them to learn life isn't always easy for people and help.
💕💕💕
I love this video! Princess Catherine is teaching her children the importance of helping other children who are in need. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing this lovely video. It is so important for children to learn about volunteer work. I recall going to sing at local nursing homes and filling care packages for soldiers as a child. I'm in my 60s now, and still volunteering.
I love the Prince and Princess of Wales, and I adore their children!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year ❤❤
Diana taught William well.  Her legacy of compassion lives on in the Wales family.  William and Catherine are wonderful parents.
Great to see their children helping out.
Chicken soup for the soul, watching this, so important cause, it'll fill your heart with joy, by giving joy, full circle!! Keep doing the best, love 💜💜💜💜💜
Bravo Princess Kate 👏👏🇧🇷🇧🇷
Omg love this so much ❤❤❤
What a wonderful mother teaching her children the value of giving back to others and recognizing those in need. There is not a greater gift than compassion for others, and while I am sure Catherine and William teach many private lessons on selflessness at home, it is good to see George, Charlotte and Louis in action. No doubt these children will live lives of service and respect for all.
How inspiring to other young children to see even little princesses and princes help those less fortunate. Well done to the prince and princess of Wales for raising them with compassion for others. ❤
THIS FAMILY....JUST BRINGS TEARS OF JOY TO MY EYES.......MERRY CHRISTMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM ACROSS THE POND IN CHICAGO, IL!!!
Bravo and Awesome...❤
Such a lovely family❤️🥰 Princess Catherine is an amazing mum x
Wow The Humility ❤❤❤
not the princess of wales, shining light on 1) the good cause, and 2) the future of the monarchy, rather than wanting to hog the spotlight... <3 isn't she lovely? just have to love all of them!  (also: wonderful work of the editors, as per usual, very, very nicely done!)
Omg i love this.  Catherine and william u are doing such an amazing job
Que lindo ❤ me encantan todos
December is really hard for struggling families. Wishing you all the best
This is how Diana raised her two boys. She'd be beaming to see her grandchildren doing this. What a good mother Catherine is to show them that not everyone is as fortunate as they are.
Very beautiful
This is awesome!! ❤
😊👼👼🇬🇧
Tão doce❤
I truly believe she would be doing this with her children even without the titles she has a kind spirit! Thank you for sharing this.
❤❤❤❤❤
Catherine is wonderful, bringing her children along to help sort presents for other children who are in need. To give them an understanding that some children are not able to have the things that they themselves have. It’s what Diana did with William where she showed him how other people live. Keeping it real  ❤️ 💕❤️
What a a wonderful mother Princess Catherine is. Raising her children to have love and compassion for all people 👏👏👏❤❤
Fabulous! Well done! Love seeing the Wales children getting involved! The Prince & Princess of Wales truly understand the most important values in life are caught not taught! Exposing children to these activities is invaluable for their learning!
🌹🌹🌹
Wonderful. This is just wonderful! A huge THANK YOU ALL! for all these lovely people in this great charity - - - and for the Waleses who not all shine a light on it, but are giving all their helping hands.... THIS is Christmas as it should be.
Beautiful and wonderful the children are learning to help others less fortunate than they are ❤🎄
Just amazing and loved seeing how excited your children were to make another child happy on Christmas.  Well Done, George, Charlotte and Louis!
I love the video. Thanks for highlighting the crucial help that so many banks need and how the donations make such impact in the lives of others. Thank so much. 🥺 The Wales children are amazing.❤
❤❤❤❤❤ ❤
This is AMAZING!!!! Watching Catherine, Princess of Wales with her children!!! They’re learning so much about a life of service and the roles they play. Look how happy they’re helping their mother helping others! 🥰

Catherine, thank you ❤
👏👏👏
So wonderful to see the children helping out. Such a lovely family. ❤
This is wonderful.
So lovely to see the bond between Catherine and her children and them all doing their bit for those less fortunate. God bless them.
What a wonderful gift they are giving their own children.. Showing them the love of giving and caring for others.  Greatest lesson they are teaching their children. ❤❤❤
This is wonderful!! A beautiful cause and so much work to be done, but with the extra hands of royal Santa's helpers, its getting done efficiently and with so much love and care! Just beautiful! Merry Christmas everyone ❤
I really love how George and Charlotte and Louis work together to help their mother pack and carry things! It's very rare for me to see something like this! And the first time I saw this video, I feel extraordinary closeness and warmth in the Welsh family ❤ thanks for sharing this video!
I love this!!❤❤
❤🥰🥰🥰
The late PD would be very proud that the new generation has the same compassion as she started when with the RF❤.
This is so beautiful ❤
