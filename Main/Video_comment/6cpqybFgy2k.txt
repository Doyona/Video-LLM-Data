It's been 2 years
🥺🥺🥺Boss your are liar
totally klopp leave 2024...
want go back to then…. miss you Boss …
And now 2024 is here…
HE IS LEAVING
Whoo Would Have Expected 2 years old From now Klopp Will Leave😢😢😢
German newspapers wrote "Klopp would quit in 2024" And now it's a reality 😢
Looking forward to seeing you next season JK 😂
A year later he's decided to call it a day doesn't make sense really 😂😂😂😂
this got recommended for me i was so happy and then saw when it was posted
U are the best
That didn't age well
losing out on bellingham sealed it. he wasnt up for fighting like mad through another season while other managers get big money to buy new players in. Im glad hes going as a united fan, but i respect the man more than any manager. he would be great craic to get drunk with too. ten hag  is a boring old git
I wish this was today's news!
Came up on my recommendation and its from a year ago ffs 😪
tears
Why am I getting recommended this now? 😭
😢Nooo!😢
Seeing this just after he announced he’s leaving makes me sad
This didn’t age well. FUCKINGHELL.
De Klopp split up with Ulla
This didnt age well 😂
Should have see it coming, a 2 year contract and true to his word he is leaving 2 years later- absolutely gutted to see him go!  But like he said from Doubters to believers a man of his word… and now we give it our all for one last dance, one final push so the greatest Liverpool manager of all time gets one final hurrah - YNWA
I cant.....2024 and this is his last season
2 years came by too quickly...  😢😢
What for you signed new deal if you want to rest??? Giving false hope to us, please change your mind, you will make us so happy again if you just finish your current contract with Liverpool
Hahahahahaha this didn't last
1 year later 😢. His leaving! Gave us the best 9 years of our lives. Thank you Jurgan! YNWA
Thank you boss
hello there 💔
And then a year later...... He is retiring
Whos here after the heartbreaking announcement?
The algorithm is being cruel to me by recommending this now 😢😢
I guess this is the latest news
It shouldn’t have recommended to me when he decided to leave at the end of the season😭😭😭
Jurgen says "0:35 = German newspaper wrote 'Kloop will stop in 2024, his entire career will finish here. " Yes its true and now 2024, he will leave the club. So bad news for me...
:(
This aged like warm milk
2 years went too fast . . Thank you Jürgen ! Irreplaceable ❤
Danke Boss!! For everything....😢❤
Thank YOU BOSS❤️❤️🥺
Lies
Anyone here after finding out Klopp’s leaving🥲 will always love you Klopp!
Cheers mate I’m crying
thank you jurgen klopp.. thank you
He’s leaving now
He’s leaving now
😢
😢
Who’s here after he’s announced he’s leaving
2 years later he's leaving, wish him the best ❤❤❤
Here after the announcement today. 2024 really was the year. This is such an awful day
You lied to us 😭😭
I come back today …
Me watching this now😔😢
what happened?
Damn I never have thought he’d leave this soon
Who's here after the devastating news this morning?
Watching this after him announcing his leave in 2024 and I guess that’s really what he felt like he said another 2 years from 2022 is 2024. Very sad day but happy also that hopefully this gives the players and fans to rally around this team and klopp for 1 final push to win everything and go out with a bang ‼️
well that lasted
man you lied to us
This does not age well :( Thank you Klopp, we sure we'll understand your decision, it's just really hard to process that this season will be our last season with you and how Liverpool is doing well so far this season. We always love you and forever will, wishing you good luck and hope this season will be a special season for Liverpool. YNWA!
Now he is leaving at the nend of the season 😢
Best bit of business we ever done. We owe so much to this legend
In Klopp we trust 😊
Jurgen please stay longer........
I've never felt any kind of passion for any team but recently i'v been feeling a lot of connection with liverpool, his history, the way his fans support, the "you'll never walk alone" but specially Jurgen Klopp, my favorite manager and I'm almost sure I will be a fan of the club, I still love a little bit barcelona because of messi but honestly I dont feel anything for the club unlike liverpool Please Klopp stay some more years cause I want to enjoy my favorite manager at what's becoming my favorite team
Lovely office Mr Klopp  You have a lovely approach to all types of 😊😂 people
The Gaffer ❤
WE LOVE YOU 🔴
Yay. Great news  .God bless  you and your family  Jurgen. Amen 😅
Looking at this in the middle of a dreadful season and still so happy seeing this, the best thing to happen to this club in 25 years
Trent needs to go, almost ALL goals are scored through him....
Please stay Kloppo! We love you so fucking much❤️❤️❤️
Jurgen Klopp for head coach of Germany 2026😍❤️💪
My favorite manager. 😍
my hero.. Thank you Klopp
Jurgen Klopp
The great man, The great ⚽️ coach.. 👍🏻👍🏻
Boss❤❤❤
Jesus bless you Jurgen. U know that, it’s your faith in Him.
Words can't describe  the love I have for this man
We are blessed
I know it’s 4 years away but the thought of Klopp leaving Liverpool in 2026 scares me more than any player we have leaving. What a man, what a character. Us Liverpool fans are so incredibly lucky ❤️
Blink twice if you are being held hostage
Best coach we've ever had!!!! We are in a good moment < We have momentum
罗伯特·罗哈斯
Julian Alvarez
Best man on the planet
I come back here once in awhile to ensure that I wasn’t dreaming. It’s true. The greatest manager in the world and in our history is staying for another 4 years.
at least he can think about how to beat real for 2 more years
Stay forever, viva
Love her
Godd,im in respect of youre Woman
anyone who doesant want klopp to stay,is not a liverpool fan,,as i put in my klopp song a year ago "make yourself at home,youll never walk alone"
THANK YOU ULLA!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Remeber when this nonce tried to compare covid jabs to drink drivers... How many heart attacks of athletes now? The man is a bell end
Legend
The normal one ❤️
I'am so glad that Jurgen is a red
Most loved Trainer in the world,  he has sharm energy ,
Yessssssss!!! The beast coach stays 😆😆😆😆😆

Who wouldn’t like it? Probably the opposition.
Liverpool has won everything under Klopp.
Thank you BOSS we love it and thank you to your wife
🎵🎶IM SO GLAD THAT JURGEN IS A RED IM SO GLAD HE DELIVERD WHAT HE SAID, YOU KNOW JURGEN SAID TO ME YANO WE'LL WIN THE PREMIER LEAUGE HE SAID SO IM IN LOVE WITH HIM AND I FEEL FINE!!!🎵🎶
Best coach cant change my mind
2 years? more please🥺
Fantastic Guy wished Arsenal had him
What a man!
That office look like Richmond FC
G.O.A.T
One of the greatest move in club history Klopp is a legend
...dreams didn't make us kings. Jurgen Klopp did....
Bester Mann,top
I heard that you shouldn't score first and that it would be a trap set by the opponent. Anyway, I urge you to protect your boys. Here's one solution that I propose: it is to study the adversary well. Take the time to study your opponent well. Concentrate well in this exercise because secrets are often difficult to penetrate.  Either way, I trust you completely. It's just that the fan's passion often leads to a fanatic, not to say fanatical, attitude. Thanks ¡i¡
Ulla need a statues :))
whoever was responsible for lighting klopp should be fired / retrained. Poor effort.  Love klopp though! 4 more years!!
Zzzze….
Ulla Klopp what a legend she is!!! YNWA❤
❤️
Da müssen wir wohl noch warten bis es heisst klopp ist Nationaltrainer ^^ Glückwunsch liverpool
I miss the yellow teeth from 2013 Klopp.
What a hypocrite. 😤
as a Man U fan, im happy his wife loves England 😂 anyways the main news today is chelsea takeover, I trolled their comments saying they are getting relegated now
This man breathed such a life into the club, the fans, and into our lives. When he arrived, though this club has always been special, he has taken us on such a journey - breathtaking, exciting, and although we started winning trophies, one shall always be thankful for the way we got there. The experience of the journey itself. Nothing can replace that, there is no price on it. So thank you, Jürgen. You and your team brought to so many happiness for a lifetime. You took care and still to this day continue to take care of our club, and we were fortunate to have you as our coach. Thank you for all the memories, the trophies, and for all the laughs and kindness! You really are a special person. Wish you here and forever from here on happiness and health, and to your loved one's as well :) <3
Love u!
I would like to play football for your team if possible.😊🥺
Hello coach, I have a dream. I am an ordinary child. I want to play football in your team, especially with Muhammad Salah. I am one of your ardent fans.
Proper bloke.
Jurgen will you please ask ulla will she stay for ever please we all love you
👍
thanks Ulla
The coach came from Bundesliga and dominated EPL and still does. Stop calling Bundesliga 'farmers league' please.
Great job Klopp 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 My name is Hamilton, I'm talking about Brazil!
10 years and only 3 trophies. Another 2 years of arrogance, complaining about the schedule and insulting other coaches
Liverpoll is my very very good gowlceper s team who he suports
I am a Scouser who lives in Canada, and have continued to follow Lapool FC. Loved them as a kid, in the 70s, and continue to enjoy watching, you are Shankly incarnate!
Eh wait what I'm a Sunderland fan who isn't going to like klopp adding another two years 🤔👍🔴⚪🔴⚪
great guy !
Biz senden raziyiz Rammstein reyiz
You know Jurgen, the reason i like you as a person and coach os because you are humble and a person who likes to laughf and be funny without beeing in the " picture " all the time. Secrets for success * the above components
🙏🏻🙌🙌🙌💝
Good luck at final CL 👏
Congratulations to LFC from a Dortmund supporter! YNWA 💛🖤
Feyenoord ultra's want you to stay till death. Great person ,best football. 👍
No. I will not stop watching now. Very excited about you staying for two more seasons. YNWA!
Big thanks to Ulla 👍🏽
Congratulations Jürgen, i wish you, your team and your players all the best. Greetings from the Netherlands!
Best Liverpool news I've ever heard.(Except winning the title at 19/20)
The only thing about this man that I don’t like is that he is not Real Madrid coach 😂
FML. It's like your ex-girlfriend never wanted to marry you even though she pretended to be in love with you but she marries her new boyfriend after the second date...But as a good ex-boyfriend we say of course: COME BACK HOME, BORUSSIA NEEDS YOU!
LFC should build a statue in Ulla's honour
The MAN💯💯💯
I am a Madrid fan but I have to admit that If Madrid do Not win the Champions league I will be proud of Liverpool and their coach, this fantastic coach but a better person Jurgen Klopp
Klopp. let out the Díaz beast
He has been appointed coach in 2015 and some people say he did not won many trophies. In my opinion he has won everything. He made a mid-table team return to its glory days by not investing too much. This man gave footballers with no hope the chance to give their all and that paid back. He IMPROVED players. He won the PL title after it was missing for 30 years. He is in the third UCL final, from which has won one and lost another by misfortune and everybody knows that.  He has won Uefa SuperCup, EFL Cup, Fifa Club World Cup. Is in the final of FA Cup, 1 point behind in PL and in the final of UCL. Which club is doing better? Liverpool fans must feel safe and proud  because this man will bring some glory days. Best of Luck Jurgen Klopp! I wish you crush that 90+ min Madrid team this time!
We want you to stay forever Jürgen!!!!!!! What a great husband, what a fantastic manager but most of all, what an amazing human being!!! From a born and bred scouser, I salute you!!! "Im so glad that Jürgen is a red" YNWA ❤️❤️❤️
yeah he looks like Dwight from The Office but he's proffesional good coach :D
Glückwunsch! Freut mich für dich und auf dass es so weiter geht.
He’s the closest thing to Shankly. Love the man.
I could tap the like button all day. 🎶 I'm in love with him and I feel fine 🎶
This man. This manager. This club. What a time to be a red ❤️❤️❤️❤️
These German coaches are proving to be worth it. Only Pep threatens their complete dominance.
thanks from Greece.
He’ll sign for another few in 2026, absolute legend and I love him so much
Jeergen 😁👊🏽
Benzema is waiting for you on May 28th!
Kabar yang sangat baik...boss
How many plastic surgeries did he have?
You win that champions league for us lad!!!
The best men in the football
What's in a name.... kLopP
Alles Gute für Dich lieber Jürgen auf all Deinen Wegen..  Liebe Grüße aus Mannheim..  😃👍❤️
Want him for another 10 years not 2😂
❤️❤️❤️ super klop
Can't help but smile every time I see this fella. I'm so glad that Jurgen will stay a red.
first of all... as a german I will tell u... never trust german news 99+% are bullshit just talking
such a Boss <3
Fantastic and the best news for LFC 😁
Good choice Jürgen!
I continue to watch this because I'm overwhelmed that Jurgen has signed an extension........his passion and love for liverpool fc is extraordinary...........the love the fans and team have for him is phenomenal...........his statue is already being carved and ready to take pride of place
Huzzah!!
I love this man!!
Kloppo 😍😍😍😍💪🏻👍🏻
Why diddnt ulla say "man i really liked dortmund, lets go back there".. jokes aside I love to see him in liverpool and he seems to be pretty happy in life .. all the best for jürgen! you are the best coach we ever had in dortmund and you are a blessing for every club you train! much love!
Great guy, great coach, great news for LFC - nothing more needs to be said!
The best anouncement 😭❤️
You mean everything to us YNWA
This news was like the best news the entire week
We love you men ! Don't go never!
I dont know why i thought about Walter White while watching this video 😂great news for all the football lovers !
Your the best manager in the world best of luck in the champions league
Come to AJAX.
This news trumps Salah signing his extension. Without Klopp, there is no Salah. With Klopp, we will get the next Salah!!!!
As a Milan Fan normally we had two very hot UCL finals, but i start liking Liverpool, not cause of your success, but because i like how Klopp turned Liverpool into the best squad in the world. Like literally watching Liverpool play is so astonishing and absolutely beautiful. May you win many many many trophies!
Yes, what a great Coach !!! We Germans want him back !!!!! to our Nationalmannschaft to win the 5. World-Cup 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Ehrenmann!
You can celebrate this more than a title lowkey
Alex Ferguson of Liverpool
Fancy coming to Barnsley instead Jurgen???
I dont want to be the partystopper, but the club will fall in a big  hole when he leaves, every coach from now on will compared to him..  and its almost impossible to deal with that.. we saw it Dortmund  i guess you need a athor Legend like Gerrrad to  deal with this..
To Klopp's wife, thank you. ♥
“The city is big enough for two clubs; the real one and the other one”  You are very lucky to have him , best coach in the world
This dude is as real and as nice as it gets... You guys are lucky to have him around.
BOOOOOOM HA HA HA! : D
This man could stay til 2050 and the fans would still be sad to see him go, he's a true legend and the foundation for making the club as incredible as it is today. From a struggling team never really challenging the top dogs, to world beaters who challenge for everything there is. Absolute class
Trust in Klopp....one of my reason...why I support Liverpool, this guy is a great great manager
I don't know you or your wife but I love her even more now. Liverpool will always carry you in its heart.
Easy decision. Very nice!
YNWA Kloppo and the reds ✍️❤️⚽ Ever since he came at Anfield in 2015, he created this unbelievable culture 🔴⚽and winning mentality 🏆🔥 We're lucky to have him and his coaching staff! ❤️⚽
This man I wish he was a new cancellor for Germany 😍
JURGEN.
jürgen alles richtig gmacht. ❤ gruss aus münchen.
even as a Chelsea fan, how can you not like this guy? Please win the prem because I hate City with a passion
Und danach kommste noch 2 Jährchen nach Dortmund zurück :D Wir brauchen dich auch!!!!
you've made my life such a treat Jurgen, love you forever!
As a BVB-Fan i'm so happy for our friends in Liverpool...! But i'm not gonna lie: We (the fans of Borussia Dortmund) would KILL to get ihm back...! But that will never happen.  Even after 2026...!  But anyway,  Liverpool FC deserves Klopp because LFC ist by far the greatest club in England!!! It would be cool if LFC-Fans would have a little sympathy for our BVB in the Bundesliga! I know, Bayern Munich is probably more interesting and definetely more succesfull, but Borussia Dortmund is trying as hard as they can to be competitive, even with way less money.
Haha WUII HAHA WUII AHAHA WUII
Hope you're still at our great club after 4 years. YNWA
Im a Juve fan and came to say Congratulations great man
Till 2026 then
Boom
U are the best manager in the world, and Liverpool FC wants u forever
Christmas came mighty early this year.  I remember the Brendan Rodgers era, I couldn't have even fathomed what this man would build in the future.
Some will like it and some will not, stpo watching. You see haters don't comments Klopp said.
(From a West Ham fan) if I was you lot, I'd be trying to get him to sign a contract in blood that states he is the Liverpool FC manager until he no longer has a recognisable pulse
Best!!!
Best coach in Europe!!! Huge character ... se u in Madrid 2023 ;)
We love you!!!! In KLOPP WE TRUST!!!!
YNWA ✊❣️
We can’t stop people to like and love Jurgen.. but all LFC fan’s love Jurgen Klopp.. That all u need to know..
God bless you Jurgen!!
Bester Trainer der Welt !! ❤️❤️❤️
When you retire mr Klopp would you kindly settle in Norfolk and come and give our local canaries a hand ?
All the "Klopp Out" plonkers from last season...  Eat your heart out!!!
Why just 2 years? Sign him for at least 10..
He inspired Ted Lasso, he MUST be a good guy
One of the Best coaches in football no one can deny !
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
In every comment section on youtube: "I am not fan of Liverpool. But i love this men". Literally every comment section!
Ulla hat entschieden ^^
I want to see you fired soon. Fingers crossed.
He and Pep are the best coaches at this moment, I think. And.. if Louis van Gaal will win the World Cup 2022 with The Netherlands he's a hero too. He already is in The Netherlands, but than he'll be the best Dutch coach ever. Maybe he already is, but many Dutch say the best was Rinus Michels. Michels won many prices with Ajax and made the Dutch EC in 1988 (team with Gullit, Rijkaard, Koeman and Van Basten 👌🏻). Just some random information.. haha! 😆👍🏻 But congrats mister Klopp! Happy you'll stay longer at Liverpool FC! 🔴
This is the single most important news for any LFC fan. It means we are guaranteed a bright future and will hopefully lead to more silverware. YNWA.
Dortmund made a huge mistake when they fired him after 1 bad season. But at least he joined to a traditional club and they rised together, not with an oil and/or cheater "club"...
Mantap
Everybody loves you Jurgen. :)
WEEEEEEYYYY!!!!
As a Manchester United supporter, I f'in love this guy. I have nothing but the best wishes for Liverpool FC with this guy at the helm because not only has he rejuvenated Liverpool's footballing community but also brought magnificent football, amazing comradery, ethics, decency, humour and love alongside a masterful display of wisdom, maturity as well as silliness and a palpable talent which every club in the world could only dream of having.  If this man does not remain at Liverpool until his retirement from football it would be a crime. He *IS* Liverpool and can gracefully and rightfully stand next to every legend belonging to the clubs history. Best wishes Jurgen.
Maybe we need a petition that Ulla moves back to Dortmund🤓
Jürgen bekommt von Stimme und Habitus so langsam leichte Jörg-Wontorra Einschläge. Zum Glück sagt er aber inhaltlich substanzielleres.
Man u fan here, congrats Liverpool. What a great manager
well done liverpool ynwa this man is a breath of fresh air
Ehh
Thanks ulla for Jurgen 😄😄
<3
Kloppo 🤓
Sei ihm gegönnt !
南野を出してください　for Japan
I'm so glad you're staying. You are the best
Good luck, mister! Da BEST!
Yeaaaah !!!
Best coach in the world 👍👏👏
Liverpool FC, the city of Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp are a match made in heaven.
Рад что Клопп продлил контракт . За многие годы привык его видеть в очках, а тут совсем другой человек)
From an Arsenal fan, he's the kind of manager that can win trophies even with Spurs. Nothing can be more legendary than that.
My hero! ❤️
Im so glad that Jürgen is a red 🎶
Make Salah the captain of liverpool pls pls pls pls pls   Salah is my 2nd fav player Pls
Thanks klopp!!! Thanks klopp!!! Let’s go!!!!!!!
Fab!!!
Come back to Dortmund
I love you! I always knew you would be a great fit from dortmund
letsssssssss gooooooooooo
l love it!
Meeggaaa 💪💪🔥🔥
What a fantastic bloke, who wouldn't want to run through a brick wall for him. Such a genuine person and deserves every success. YNWA
Sick
perfect match gratulations to both LFC and Klopp
Past,Present,Future ! YNWA <3 In Klopp We Trust ! <3
You really see by now how this job drained a lot of lively energy from him, at least off the pitch. Compare his energy to 2015… I guess the english media stress really f‘ed him up a bit
Ilks you  the best manger 1🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇩🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇩🇪🔥🔥🔥🔥
The legend lives on
More trophies and triumphs on the way to 2026
more cups on the way cool
Yes BOSS! Now let's go win some trophies.
All round top guy top manager
Amazing coach. Wish he coached a team I liked. Well done Liverpool.
Heloł gurła
I'm in love with him and I feel fineee
🟡⚫️ best coach still miss this man in Dortmund
Go on Klopp boy
THANK YOU SO MUCH JÜRGEN. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
I had fallen away from football for a number of years until I came across Klopps Dortmund team in the late 2000s with Weidenfeller, Hummels, Subotic, Schmelzer, Błaszczykowski, Bender, Gotze, Großkreutz, Kagawa, Lewandowski and I couldnt believe how good they were, the football was incredible, the high pressing and fast intricate attacking. Then Reus, Gundogan, Perisic were added.  Anyone who knows football will know thats a whos who of world class players although at the time they were not big names like now. Dortmund were mid table when Klopp took over and he built what imo was the best team in Europe, who toppled Bayern, and he did this while turning a a big profit in the transfer market. It was a minor miracle what he achieved with Dortmund. I remember the first season in the Champions League they were very unlucky to go out in the Group stage and I told anyone who would listen they will win the Champions League next year. Nobody agreed and I backed them at 50/1.  Of course they lost the final to Bayern and I lost my bet but it was a great bet and I was on to Klopp very early as someone special, I even learned some german just to listen to his interviews because what he was saying in English was so impressive, and to see him now at the top of the football world is nice.
Dont support Liverpool.... But this guy is just superb... Great manager and a great person.... So likeable..
Your speaking shows that you are really intelligent. I love the way you tell about something. Wish all the best for you!
Kloppo wir lieben dich. Danke für alles, was du für diesen Verein getan hast und tust. Mein Vater ist BVB Fan, ich LFC Fan, unsere Familie liebt dich! Du bist der beste Trainer der Welt. Danke!  YNWA
Legen what a coach 👏
Vielen Dank, Herr Klopp, Ihr Dienst für den FC Liverpool war hervorragend, und als lebenslanger Unterstützer ist es ein absolutes Vergnügen, Sie "den Normalen“ als „The Boss“ zu haben! Hallo aus Neuseeland.
Yeah best news ever!!!
And after 2024 pls come back to Dortmund ☺️🖤💛
Yes
👍👍👍
its good yah
Sack him now.
LFG!!!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍💪
We like it Klopp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You transformed Liverpool. Now buy Ronaldo.
MADE IN MAINZ   🔴⚪️
Nice !!!
Pep is the best….
Make sure we’ll get the win premier league….
What a horrible, sarcastic and hypocritical individual.
Thank u 4 signing
If we keep performing at this rate you will manage liverpool  20more  years  and you will be greatest manager in history above fergusion and any other manager in the world. Liverpool is the best home to be jurgen.
Writing history absolutely a legend
Hey Klopp! Please recruit Heung-Min Son. He will be a huge help to your team.
As a Leeds Utd fan i think it's brilliant that he's signed an extension, as a league we should have the best in the world managing our fantastic clubs, Congrats Jurgen.
yeaaaaaaaahhhhhh
amazing coach ! good news..
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jürgen! I am not Liverpool fan! But I wish  you make a unique history in Europe. Because you are hard worker! Really! you are the symbol of German strong psychological Challenger!
Best Coach ever,Greetings from Dortmund.
I'm so jealous! I wish you were at Tottenham. You're a lovely man and one of the best coaches. Your smile is infectious and you are like a father to your players.  Good luck Sir. I wish you all the best!!
Mr.Jürgen Klopp  congratulate  😃😃😃👆👆👆
YNWA
Im so glad that Jürgen is a red!
Anybody know what brand that off black/navy shirt is?
Ok then I am a Liverpool fan for two more years
I’m city fan but ,i really like this man
Even if I am an Arsenal fan in the first place (Liverpool is a close second), this is a very fruitful and great marriage.  Congrats to Liverpool and Jürgen, it is a joy to watch your cooperation and the way you play the games. I am happy for both of you, and it is great news for football alltogehter!
Even as a City fan I have to love and admire Klopp. I mean, who doesn't? He's such a good manager and a genuine guy.
Will klopp be like arsene wenger?  This questions must be answer!
as a Chelsea fan, I am glad to have him longer in the Premier League, that will only make our league stronger and more attractive.
Klopp is like Tarantino and Pep is like Scorsese. The two are great, but Pep take incredible players to do incredible work while Klop makes the incredible with normal players. With his direction, players from smaller clubs become world class.
When wifey say: We stay! We stay, there's no other option.
Lets hope that Ulla will miss the Ruhrpott someday and we see you in the Westfalenstadion again :D
Nein nein nein
try not like this Gentleman what a human being
Please bring harry maguire in liverpool.
I’m so glad that Ulla is a red ….🎶
Hopefully to Bayern right after those 4 years ;)
Freut mich für Sie Herr Klopp 👍🏻
Fantastic human being and a fantastic coach YNWA. May he stay forever 🤝
in Thailand  so happy !
The greatest bad smell in football ⚽️ I love this German fella YNWA JFT97
This is some of the best noise I've had of late. That's saying a lot as I've had some great news of late. But I love what this guy has done at my club and I know he'll win us another title 👍☺️
Yes! Good für Liverpool and the Fans! I hope, Juergen and Liverpool will win the Champions League 2022 and than, maybe in 2 Years, Juergen will go to Bayern Munich  and later to the german Nationalmannschaft to win the World-Cup!  Love from Germany
Best signing we ever made 👍😎
You are welcome once again  I wish u good luck with our club
Iam so glad that Jurgen is a Red

You make my day Jurgen
Big thanks to Ulah (If I pronounced wrong sorry about that)
Why does it feel like he’s telling me that the tumour is benign and I’ll be ok?
Unbelieable. It’s been already more than 6 fantastic years. It’s great boss.
I want that "The Normal One" mug he has! :) Totally happy to have him extended his contract!
I think he should coach Norwich or Watford and make something out of them if he is that good. Only then we will know how good he is. Even I can coach Liverpool or Man City!
Klopp is a boss...a legendary coach.
ARE YOU WATCHING PEP?
Best football coach ever
Best news - thanks!!!!
Thank you for all the great memories! Always behind you Kloppo!
What a legend
Thank u Ulla Klopp!

It's amazing that such a phenomenal coach is in fact an even better human being.  We are truly blessed.  YNWA from USA. Go Reds!
Tqvm Jurgen Klopp and Ulla. Ulla we love u so much for convincing Klopp to remain stay with our beloved LFC Family. It is really the biggest news than signing any big star player. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WooHoo!
I thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me Love was out to get me That's the way it seemed Disappointment haunted all of my dreams  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried  Scousers have a way of getting under your skin. F'kin brilliant
🔥
Who wouldn’t like it??  People who like the shitness before he arrived?
We love you Herr Klopp!! Danke schön für alles!!!!! YNWA
00:20
How much do PL managers make these days?
Man, Danke. Du hast mein Bruder glücklich gemacht. Er ist Liverpool Fan seit 15 Jahren. Mach’s gut!
such good news for Liverpool fc what a great manager
After his work as a manager, the club have to give him a job in this club. He lives Liverpool fc in every cell, he identify 100% with the fans with the Philosophie, and how he transformed Liverpool, he diserve it, and I think the fans will love it, if klopp stay  in Liverpool FC for lifetime.
Man... I'm so glad that Jurgen is a red
So humble... hate that I love him. Utd fan here
Im a United fan but what a signing he was for Liverpool. Truly an unbelievable manager, best in the world without a shadow of a doubt.
ALTIJD WELKOM MIJN GROTE GABBER !!!
Well I guess the only ones who don´t like this announcement are the fans of other clubs who would like to have Klopp as their manager :D
Ggmu
Normal one. Really love the club. The atmosphere. Everything.  Selamat Hari Raya! Raya awal taun ni. Encik Klopp datang lah rumah kami ye. Makan kuih bahulu...semperit... Rendang... Main mercun... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The German scouser, its an honour to have you here
Best manager in the prem. Best manager in Europe. Best manager in football for a while
Announce klopp
I’m a United fan and I’m sh*tting myself righ now, no no no no
He broke the charisma meter !
THATS class❤❤
even though we haven't win a lot of trophies yet, ever since Klopp arrived in Liverpool he definitely changed Liverpool to be a better team. Really love the way he handled all those great talents and as a fan of Liverpool since Michael Owen era, for me (at least) he is the best. even if we didn't win any trophy, I do really really love how Liverpool has been playing since Klopp became their coach. Their football is so fun to watch and made me enjoy watching football again ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best signing of the last 5 years
Cool. But the title of the video is a bit misleading. We didn't get to see the boss, Ulla?
Now Jùrgen don't go blaming your other half! Tell the truth you have the best job in the world and you know it baby! You were made for LFC and not only do they love you but you just Lorve it to.All the very best from Dublin Ireland. You are already a bloody legend and the casting should already be in place for your very own little statue!✊YNWA💖
The best coach ever you fix CL title after 15 years waiting you fix PL title after 22 years waiting Love you man
Thankyou Ulla❤️❤️❤️🙌
Liverpool fans are very fortunate to have this man
Made up
Ulla-pool!😉 Forza Jürgen!
Love you Jurgs
Come back to Dortmund and make thsis team good again
I’m an Arsenal fan but I can’t imagine Liverpool would want anyone else. As for Jurgen I think he should stay for as long as possible to build what is already a fantastic legacy there.
Guardiola & the Man City hierachy of course WON'T like it!
I'm not a Liverpool supporter but how is it possible to not like this guy. Good job Liverpool
As a lifelong united fan, I hate to hear this news!!! But what I hate even more is catching myself enjoying watching liverpool over the past 4-5 years. Hopefully Ten Haag turns out to be another Klopp! Because I think united are where Liverpool were 6 years ago. Time will tell.
Please find me a man who doesn't love jurgen, I'll change his mind I swear, it's so easy)))
Stay where you are and never come back to Dortmund.
W Wife
Lets Gooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
I bet you no one stopped watching
So humble... wife wants to stay, so we stay.
This is why we love Klopp so much! It's not just the success he's brought us, it's that it's so obvious that Liverpool isn't just another job for him, he genuinely loves the club and loves the city. It's a match made in heaven, I can't remember ever seeing another manager and club bond so deeply. Klopp will go down in history as one of the greatest Liverpool managers of all time, not just because of what he's achieved here but because he lives for Liverpool; future generations will hold his name as inseparable from LFC in the same manner as Dalglish, Paisley or Shankly!
If Pep signs another 2 years we will continue to have top-tier football and rivalry between these 2 clubs!
Hello everyone, please help to save up for at least cheap boots, I'm from Russia.
I'm an Everton supporter and I am so jealous
Very Happy for you Liverpools Fans. I am a Villa fan but Always had a soft Spot for Liverpool and I love Jurgen Klopp and the fans! lets hope you win the UCL!
4 MORE YEARS!!! YNWA!
As a fan of a historical rival, I'm happy for Jurgen and Liverpool. Strong EPL teams attract more great coaches and players.
If he ever quits at LFC there is only one other job for him: President of the world. Please do it!
FANTASTIC NEWS
Greatest man in football right now. Brilliant managers and personality!
Klopp come back to Germany ;(
👍🏻
достойный тренер достойный клуб
Bester Mann
Everyone likes it jurgen don’t be silly  We love you mate from Australia 🇦🇺🔴🔴🔴 YNWA   Big up Ulla ❤️❤️❤️ Big up Klopp
Kopp lives I  the only part of england where his English is more fluent than the natives
YNWA Thanks YOU are the best so happy COYR
Liverpool is good because Jurgen is good  -liverpool
I get a feeling the best is yet to come! Yes Jurgen lad!
Fantastic! Thank you Jürgen!
YES!!!
he took over dortmund when it was a mess, he turned the club around and brought titles and a CL final, then he did the same with liverpool. he is a people changer, he make people give their lifes for him because that’s what he is doing.
Buenos días y felicitaciones.
Kuss jürgen
Pep better put that pen to paper now
Legend

God I wish we had him at Utd.
Happy days Jurgen you legend YNWA 💥💥⚽️ 💥💥
I LOVE THIS MAN
Dear  Jürgen Norbert Klopp -   You have been a wonderful inspiration to us all ... The football you play is wonderful, the spirit is contagious, and the attitude is humble ... It has honestly been magical since you arrived. Klopp and the Kop were a match Devine .  Thank you from the deepest place of my heart   Steven Benitez
Great thing for English football! Amazing coah! - Newcastle fan
Wonderful news 👏
My god I couldn't love this man anymore.
Kami dari Indonesia sangat mengagumi kepelatihan Jurgen Klopp ... Dan kami sangat mengharapkan Liverpool juara UCL
This Guy deserves a Knighthood I don't support any team in piticuler but such a humble guy and great sportsman 💯
Glad his wife feels at home in Merseyside
Liverpool fans are very lucky to have such a manager. I personally admire him.
Найкращій тренер в світі!!!
Irgendwie erinnert mich seine Redensart an Peter Lustig
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿😁
Another Champions League and Premier League title and I don't mind if he resigns. I always loved Klopp all the way back from his time in Mainz and Liverpool is one of my all time favorite english clubs. These times will be remembered.
I'm in love with him and I feel fine.
tottenham fan here but even I know he is a great coach and a great person. this is probably the best thing that can happen to liverpool fans. best of luck to him!
The only ones who don't like that are the other premier league teams.
Klopp forever ynwa
🤟👏
Why not 10 years?
DANKE KLOOP.  You’ll Never Walk Alone. Great Manager and all the teams behind. Don’t Stop Believing.
the utter humility to suggest that some LFC fans would not like this message, pure class this man.
Best signing for 2022/2023 so far.... Wow
Not even a pool supporter but this guy is class!!
Bravo Jürgen. Darum lieben dich die Menschen. Du stehst für Ehrlichkeit, Treue und Respekt. Auch wenn wir dich in Dortmund immer noch vermissen, deine Legende die du in Liverpool erschaffst ist so wunderbar. Viel Erfolg weiterhin, bleib gesund und erfreue uns weiter mit deiner Mannschaft und diesem Vollgasfußball. Schwarzgelbe Grüße.   Well done Jürgen. That's why people love you. You stand for honesty, loyalty and respect. Even if we still miss you in Dortmund, the legend you are creating in Liverpool is so wonderful. Continued success, stay healthy and continue to delight us with your team and this full-throttle football. Black and yellow greetings.
Impossible to not like him Even as an Arsenal Fan i love this guy …. Congratulations Liverpool you got a good one
I "officially" became a Red because of him, his style, energy, charisma, good to have him at Anfield for as long as possible. YNWA🔴❤‍🔥 Greetings from Brazil.
Greatest coach ever to lead Liverpool to glory. All hail the Klopp 👏🏾🎉

Can you imagine what a better world will be if there are 2 copies of that man
I'm not a Liverpool fan but who doesn't like this? He is probably the best coach right now, even for the rivals is a motivation to play against his team. Congratulations for the new contract for both Liverpool and Klopp
Love it 🎉
YESSSSS top class manager
The charisma of Juergen just loving it more
Thanks ulla, the cheques in the post. ..
Viel Erfolg & dir und deiner Family viel Gesundheit !:)  Auf geht's Kloppo❤

I'm an evertonian   respect to klopp. He is a fantastic manager and a really good person.
There is a saying that behind every successful man there is a woman, It appears to be true.
Ynwa!!!
take over PSG bro
Thank you
Yeah, some will like it some will not, I'm one of those who didn't like i. As a Real Madrid fan, I dreamed of having Klopp in Madrid, so that is why I'm not happy with this news. But I also do like Liverpool and wish the club all the best (when not competing against us) so I'm happy for you all Liverpool fans. And hope you win the deserved PL this year.
The Ceaser "Jurgen Klopp"  ... Y N W A
Thank you Ulla.. thank very muchhhhhhh..
Congratulations Jurgen Klopp and his team👏👏🎉🎉🥳🥳
i dont like it.... I LOVE IT!
❤️
I started watching a season or two after Istanbul. The past 6.5 years is the best that Liverpool has ever been for me. I love the passion, the community, and the ideals. I had been preparing myself for life without Klopp and am beyond happy that we can all put that line of thought off for another couple years.
you can double that time for me our Jurgen xxx
Sub Indonesia
Great bloke speach!🙂⚽️
Soundest boss lad
Congrets Jürgen! Good decision👍✊

Hail to the chief!!
Great coach! Glad that he is still the „normal one“! 😄
Amazing klopp as always 😍
What a wonderful man
thank you Mr klopp, liverpool legend all ready
GO BOSS!!! Its so good to see the Reds thrive this season 👑👑
Klopp : Some will like it , some won't Who'll like it: 1 PL team Who'll not : 19 PL teams LEGEND.
It is possible for klopp to be a coach until his retirement from the video, he need encouragement and he need the fans to support him Because of several reasons, Borussia Dortmunda's performance was very bad in year 2014-2015. It was a risk for Relegation.  Many fans fucked klopp and that was the reason why he left.
He should voice audiobooks — or get a podcast.
The best
liverpool and klopp fit together perfectly! <3
yes1111
Thx pls new contract with Salah❤️
No puedo ser más feliz por tenerle aquí. El mejor entrenador posible para el mejor equipo posible
Jurgen Klopp signing a new contract is good news, good news indeed.
God job mr klop
Wake up now

As Arsenal fan congratulations:)
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Would love to ban Klopp from ever retiring, absolutely love him! Hopefully more trophies to come. 🤞

I'm happy for Jurgan Klopp and satisfied at the same time. He deserve this for the things he has done for liverpool.
Jürgen Klopp eine bodenständige Legende 👍

You'll never walk alone, Sir
Great news Jurgen! I am delighted. You've resurrected this great club. I've been with Liverpool since the FA Cup final in 1965 when I was just 7 yrs old. Liverpool could not be in better hands.

Klopp superb news and thank you for committing your future to Liverpool and creating a legacy and a new era for the club.
Congratulations 👏🏻👏🏻
Something is not right, in my football Manager save, Jurgen always goes to Man City and Pep takes over Liverpool. Klopp is not sticking with the script!  All the best Jurgen, you make football better for everyone and wishing you and Liverpool even more success in the coming years.
Who said Germans don’t have a sense of humour? Genius all round.
Ulla sandrock greath wife, thanks ulla👍🏾👍🏾
This is era liverpoll..
Ten Haag is shaking right now

Tq Jurgen ..
Love this man more than my own parents
YNWA!
What a gaffer ❤️
Best coach in the Premier League hands down. Can make a player from second division in Sweden look world class under him. So delighted for him and Liverpool. The passion he has for the game. The love and respect he has towards his players like Mané and Salah during the fast. Such a humble person. Schooled my Arsenal many times but I ain’t even mad because we are learning so much after every defeat. Made Anfield a no-go-zone for any team in the world. I hope he wins the league over Man City.   Good luck on the remaining fixtures Liverpool. Hope you get it!   Coyg!!
Greetings from Colombia ! YNWA
So geil
Wow 👍👍👍
Stay as it hurts them. Enjoy the being at Liverpool
If Klopp is this era's Bill Shankley, then I hope Pep Lijnders would soon be Bob Paisley and Steven Gerrard shall be the new King Kenny.
Good smell that's sticking around! A delightful smell of victory. Best news since Shanghai lockdown.
Excellent coach…
thanks boss and ulla.
What a great coach and lovely man. His vibes so click with me, and really love to hear that. God bless u Jurgen 💜💜💜

Komm zurück nach meenz! Hier ist das Wetter besser und der Wein ^^ MAINZ 05 💪
Best coach in the world (im not a Liverpool fan)
What agreat news from our coach, more throphies will come soon.  Love from Somalia.💔
He’s the closest coach to Ted Lasso 😂
As a Liverpool fan since 1976 from Bulgaria I had the privilege to adore Bob Paisley, King Kenny, Alan Hansen and all the giants from that era in my childhood. Thereafter, my dreams have never been tossed and blown. When Klopp arrived, it was so easy for me to remember that Liverpool style of dominating football from the 70s and 80s of 20th century. Now in the modern times Liverpool is back where the club belongs to  - among the Greats. Thank you Jurgen and IN KLOPP WE TRUST!!! We adore you and we are convinced - you will have to book a constant team of repair workers for the titles wall at Anfield.
Klopp is the reason I support Liverpool, before that I was not supporting any English team.
So happy u stay u keep liverpool going I so proud to have you have a manager
Gutted its only two .. twenty would of bin better !
Yessss yessss yessss
Please never leave us😩😩🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Nice one fantastic coach...we love you sir, God bless you
What a class guy! A true role model.
I like this club because of this Coach.... Thanks for bring many exciting games for us...
I win the lottery yet this cheered me up more.
I love you coach

😍😍
im going to use this as a defense of all German Folks as a Scot living in Germany. when someone says 'Germans have no sense of humor'  i would consider using the Klopp as the best example of how Germans chuckle...its subtle and its almost sophisticated. yeah they dont do sarcasm so well but the big man should be used as a benchmark and he is doing your club and also the Premiership proud !
Thank you Jurgen and Ulla
Awesome news!
Thank you. Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
On behalf of millions of Reds.. Thank you, mrs. Ulla Klopp!!!!!
I'm proud to be a Kloppite, Everton will have 5 managers in the next 2 years
Hjvjd8x
Did anyone noticed he has changed alot since he took over Liverpool 6yrs ago.. The work at Anfield must be stress, and he sacrifices his whole life for our club.. God bless Klopp with long life and prosperous health.. 🙏❤️
Юрген, ты - лучший тренер и, уверен, отличный человек!
my dad
What a great man.....sorry: wife of Jürgen!  :-)
For real the english and the germans are a perfect match.... No mentality fits better together.... Same tribe Ango- Saxons.... no matter what West Ham  fans rumbling against Frankfurt.... 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇩🇪✌️
In you we trust sir. YNWA.
Powerful people make places powerful Liverpool FC 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yes boss zeke
In Klopp we trust. Heavy metal football for another 4 years 🤩🤩
Wie er sich über die zusätzliche Million für diesen Clip freut. Ja, fein bist du, ein Feiner bist du, braver Lumpi, brav. Da hat er gut zugehört wie man richtig absahnt.
Looks like Chuck Norris
WE LOVE YOU, KLOPP 😍🥰 & WE LOVE LIVERPOOL TOO 😍🥰😊😇😘😘😊😊😘😘
Happy for the Reds 🤗, I am.  But another two years for my hope...😎  The Boss returning to Dortmund.
Heil Jurgen!

Happy tears!
Hammertyp und guter Trainer.
Couldn't be happier, In Klopp We Trust
F*ckin' love you Jurgen. One of the best things in so many lifes!
Brilliant news 👏
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.   (Luke 4:18-19)
Get in! Love it.
Love you Klopp! Our best ever signing
He is World number one coach I'm woching him for sri lanka.. livapool take the best out off him an be strong..keep him as long as you can. His thinking an thoughts are very much different from others.. he is a good reader.. see the team what he has put to gather..

Ok. We'll put up with you a bit longer. 😂😂😂😂👍
what a great new, I am not Liverpool or man city fans, but EPL have J.Klopp in Liverpool and P.Guardiola in man city is what an exciting competitive race. both of Liverpool or man city in 2nd also feel pity....
Now to hope Guardiola doesn't renew. We'll have the league to ourselves for 3 years if that's the case.
Jurgen.I.like.it.very.much.good.luck
One thing i admire about Kllop is that His height
Klopp for the Kop!
Legend nothing else to say
Liverpool🔥🔥
Klopp and our owners are taking the right step and making liverpool a power house 2 more years and maybe more
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.   Is a lamp bought to be put under a basket or under a bed is it not to be set on a lamp stand for there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.  And he said he who has ears to hear let him hear.

My coach, my hero."Up Liverpool up". "YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE "
As a Chelsea fan I've gained so much respect for Liverpool as a Club and even as a fanbase. You lot are in for some magical years and I'm jealous as a mother f. I wish Chelsea would just start operating like Liverpool. Big up to Klopp Can't help it being happy for him
We love you Klopp
A measure of Klopp success at Liverpool will culminate with Pep Guardiola running away from Man City. Which I suspect he will do in 2023, after a string of defeats and realization that he can't compete for the league title as well.
Hope he will be National trainer in germany after that cause he is simple the best
Not a Liverpool fan here, but damn I just love this coach! :D Best of wishes Jurgen!
Thank you Boss Long live Klopp  Long live Lfc
May the City Council of Liverpool honour Mr and Mrs Klopp the Freedom of the City.
Alhamdulillah
Bravo Ulla !!! You done a wonderful job and the quality of soccer played by the team is superb. Wishing you and your coach staff more success and all the best wishes. Hello from Australia..

I know Liverpool destroyed Barca at Anfield and as a Barca fan it's embarrassing but yeah.....very glad to see Klopp signing new contract with Liverpool . Salah and Mane should do it too quickly ( by the way it will be better if salah comes barca 🤪 just kidding 😂 )

Just know though I am a mere Liverpool fan, but you have made me to actually believe in my self that I can actually acheive all my goals in life. This is as a result of seeing jurgen and his team with standing all the hardships and pressure here and there and they still get the results. Just know you are a gift to my life. Long live papa

such a weird bloke
Bravo choice! In Klopp We Trust!
Legendary status
Good news. It is very difficult for us to lose an amazing manager like you. You brought Liverpool to their habitat and the dedication, mentality and energy you put at the club is something we really appreciate. The achievements above are much more important. And that's what makes trophies and awards to come and every trophy you get is always special because your path has never been easy in building this club from the very beginning and Liverpool are also not a club that likes to spend money like other big clubs, but you can maximize it all. you are amazing
Super nice to hear that , Thanks Jurgen 👍
Yeee... Congratulation....
that's the way to announce a contract thank you very much Ulla and the kids for wanting to stay and showing love to our club and the city of Liverpool
Good job
Why would he want to leave! The 2 best managers in world football at the moment will continue to go toe to toe for years to come! The Klopp/Guardiola battle continues...
Best news
the boss know what he want
How about Salah and Mane
Statue for him is a must
Music to my ears. I hope with this new contract from the boss comes new trophies and titles for liverpool fc. In klopp we trust. YNWA 💪💪💪
That's is good news
Who the hell not like it??? Come on... This is definitely the best news ever!!
Amazing news!
CMON❤️
What ever the result with u... if we get all the trophies or not all our respect to u.. we started to dream beyond the boundaries.. You will never walk alone..
That's the best news. It's an honour and a privilege to have Klopp as the manager of the greatest football team!
This message really cheer my day up!! This is the BEST signing of Liverpool this season (I know Diaz is great...but still nobody top our boss)!! Love this guy so much and am really looking forward to the next 4 years of exciting ride!! YNWA!

Klopp is the best signing in the history of Liverpool F.C.
Thank you so much Mr.Klopp ! Danke!
Absolute Legend!! What Klopp did with Liverpool, how he transformed the club from an average team to the best team in the World (beside City, of course) with nett spending of only   80 million (!)  in the process, is something unbelievably impressive... One day, a section of the  Stadium at Anfield would be named after Klopp...100%
Simply the best in the world stay for life
Good coach 💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️
He transformed Liverpool from a mid table club to European Champions, the best manager in the world.
Means pep will stay as well
💪👍👏
We love you Jurgen, Regards from Cuba 🇨🇺…YNWA

Best ever signing in Liverpool premier league history!!!
Love my Boss from Thailand❤
We are really really lucky to have you Coach.
THE BOSS
I am a Man United fan growing up and still hoping someday in the near future they will bounce back.  But oh man, can stop watching Liverpool's game and "You will never walk alone" always gives me goosebumps and energy to boost my life. Still remember Klopp's sign up conference speech. He is such a smart but most importantly genuine person. That's probably why even the opponent team fan like me like him. All the best Jurgen!
We are the one who feel lucky that you are with liverpool
Brill . Best news . Now for salah and mane new contracts ynwa
who??wont like this,Boss
Humans should not place other mortals on pedestals. However every now and then one comes along who is adored and revered beyond normal bounds..... Liverpool, the club, city, and global fan base have such a man in Jurgen Klopp. His appeal is not only due to the team's achievements on the field. The personality of the man and his obvious gift of moulding a team of different ethnicities and religions into a harmonious unit performing to their highest potential is an example to all modern societies of what is possible with good leadership.  Congratulations LFC and Jurgen Klopp.
I love you Klopp.
Oh so glad he finally signed a new contract for another 4 years.
WHAT AN HONOUR FOR LFC FANS TO BE ALIVE NOW!!!
Thank you Jurgen extending your contrct staying at Liverpool FC he's the best manager for the club LFC YNWA

I am French, but I will tell you that in English language: "with this announcement, you have made my day, Jürgen!"
I still remember after the Derby me nephew's dad bursting through the door at 12am singing 'Ohhh Jurgen We Love You!' - was that 6 and a half years ago already!?

this the quadruple needed!!!  4 more years!! YNWA
Thank you
Live long and prosper Klopp and long I hope you stay at our beloved club! ALLEZ ALLEZ ALLEZ!! YWNA!!!🔴🔴🔴🤙🤙
Remb folks, we support Klopp in good times & bad...almost nothing goes up forever & so shd our club goes south at some point when he is still ard, we must continue to support him! 🤟
"If the wife wants to stay, then.... I stay"  Love that..
I guess Mrs Klopp had a big part to play in all of this.  😁 🙏🏾
🥳🎉🎉🎉🥳
As a Liverpool supporter of 60 years, I’ve seen the Shankly era, the Paisley era and witnessed the pain of many years where the club meandered. The Klopp era has been one positive step after another. If Shankly is watching he will be delighted to see Jurgen “Make the people happy”. Long may this culture continue.
We just did Salah to sign his new deal.😍⚽🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
What a coach. What Klopp is doing for Liverpool is amazing and exciting. He came and brought Liverpool from the wreckage back to the top. We Liverpool fans thank Klopp very much for his great contributions over the years. Forever love Klopp and Liverpool ❤️
I love you bosssss!! What a great news !!
Im very happy ❤️❤️❤️
You make us happy, danke Jurgen!
lets kick MU again...
The more time Jürgen spends at anfield, the more super January transfers we’ll get👌🏻🇩🇪
You are doing well Sir. You are liverpool legend. After winning that EPL title, your status should have been built by now out side of Anfield.
I am not a liverpool fan, but I am really happy regarding the news. This is a good news, not only for liverpool, but for football world. What this man did at liverpool was amazing. Beautiful game at its core. As a football fan, I really enjoy liverpool's play under him, such a beautiful flow moving football that every football lovers wanted to watch.
It's a very, very great news from our great manager. I am very proud of him and the club. God bless you coach. YNWA.

*YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Danke KLOPP*
So very happy Jurgen and his team have extended; up the Reds!
Good Job 💪💪
is ok to be a small club when we can keep on push on and winning matches after matches....looking forward to win  more trophy...
Mo Salah said about his contract extension; ".....I have one year left. I think the fans know what I want, but in the contract it’s not everything about the money at all. So I don’t know, I can’t tell you exactly...." I think the reason is this...Jurgen stays for another 2 years...Thank God He's A Red..
What a coach and legend.  You most certainly made Liverpool great and cool again. My only regret is that the board didn't give him a 10 year extention
He made liverpool a top tier team again
MAKE A STAUE FOR ULLA!!!!
Eid gifts... Alhamdulillah
In Klopp we trust. COYR's...
KLOPP for THE KOP 🙌
Humble as always!! Ulla Klopp thank you. We know what it means when a strong woman is behind a strong man. Here’s to 4 more years!!! Jurgen said to me ya know…🙏

Here's to another 4 years of The Normal One!
As a Liverpool fan for 55 years, the only news that could have been better than when I heard that Jurgen Klopp had been appointed the Manager of LFC is that he has signed a contract extension (Stay forever : )  Brilliant news !
If there was ever a better example of how to lead without using fear or an ego, but to instead be approachable, I’m yet to see one. This man is amazing. Take football out of the equation, there’s nothing not to admire.
I wonder who will win between klop vs sir alex vs guardiola..
Klopp to the kop
ഈ മൊതല് വന്നതിനു ശേഷം liverpool വേറെ ലെവൽ ആയി.. Worldclass coach.. JK ഇഷ്ടം....
so we should thank ulla.
Who's next Jurgen?
Who will not like you we all loves you
LETS GO!!!!!!
This made my day! The Klopp ere at Liverpool will be forever remembered by Reds fans as one of the greatest times in the history of this amazing club. I'd hate to have to play against him. YNWA ♥️

Congratulations Liverpool and Klopp From Algeria
Brilliant
Thank Boss!!!
He has achieved a lot with Liverpool. Let’s hope he will continue. To Liverpool fans when things get sour remember what this man did to you. Don’t be like ungrateful arsenal fans who chased Wenger unceremoniously. See how they got finished. It’s even a miracle to be fighting for top 4 finish for them now.
😍🥰❤
Bad news for rivals.... but good news for the LFC family around the world 😁😁😁
Thank you Ulla!
Thank you Jurgen. You are the architect of all these beautiful stories and events in Liverpool
Yaaas 👏💪⚽️

Thank you Jurgen! This is bigger than any trophy! YNWA
I'm Arsenal fan but I like Liverpool and love you
thanks a lot, Mrs. Klopp 🤩🤘🏾 for influencing this great man to stay longer ♥️ not to forget, thanks a lot Liverpool citizen, for creating perfect atmosphere & positive ambience for these families of Liverpool squad to have a perfect circle of society ♥️♥️♥️
Best summer signing we could of hoped for before the window is even open , Salah to follow and hopefully finish the season with the best possible outcome. No matter what we stand by this man. YNWA
Lovely jubbly
YNWA 🇮🇩
😁 This is the best news I have heard... Klopp you are the best.. You are perfect for Liverpool and Liverpool is perfect for you👌
As a fan of 33 odd years I can truly say that U Sir are by far the best thing to happen to us, words truly fail & thank you Mrs Klopp.
Finally !
Come on Boss!!! We love you - YNWA!! COME ON!!!
GET IN!!!!
The best coach!

Thanks Klopp ! We love you very much, YNWA
Oh, you’ve made my year!. Since you arrived there has grown a positivity at Liverpool. I especially admire the comradeship and admirable values you instilled within the club, players and fans. There is a humanity and collective spirit that other clubs just don’t get. Thank you for your commitment and your shining example to the young people of Merseyside, both blue and red.😉
Two more years to keep on loving you, thank you Jurgen! And thank you Ulla! ❤❤💗💗❤❤
Ooo I love him)
Making history   Each game at a time   We appreciate you Jurgen! Thank you
I love you
As an Arsenal fan I'm glad to see Klopp stick around. We haven't fared great against Liverpool in recent years but that doesn't mean I don't respect them and Klopp any less. Looking forward to more competitive encounters with them.

KLOPP TO THE KOP❤️❤️❤️
This man lives and breathes Liverpool, I'm grateful I've got to witness his reign as manager.

Hier ist der deutsche Kommentar den du sucht. LIVERPOOL MUSS KLOPP EINE Statur bauen einfach Legende der Mann
ABSOLUTE LEGEND!!!!!!
Yes you’ve made my day 👏🏽🥰💜👌🏽Thank you Jurgen 😀😀
OK, that gives me 2 years more time, to visit Anfield.  There 's only one problem: at what time you _scousers_ start speaking english? (just joking)
What an amazing news this is 😎😎😎
Brilliant news! Great decision! 😁🔴
Soooooo soooooo happy!!!!
We love you klopp ..thank you
YESSS THE BOSS..... YNWA
Inspite of being a Man City fan I admire this man a lot and I don't hesitate to say it aloud like Manchester United fans.
My manager 🙌🏻
You should of stayed on till 60 Boss
We want him till his retirement….ynwa
We will enjoy the time together Boss !
Brilliant!!!
Gonna be one of the greatest manager of premier league
We love you at Liverpool Jurgen!!! YNWA!!!
L❤️ve you Jürgen. You have made this happen you legend. YNWA
Have supported this club for 40+ years and I am overjoyed that the "German fella" is staying. YNWA.
❤️❤️❤️
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Hope they pay him whatever he wants!!
Best news ever absolute legend off a human being  and manager
What a legend, who wouldn't be happy with him signing for another two years !
what a god Husband
YNWA Boss ❤️
I wish he wear his eye glasses again. YNWA! Danke!!
please make a statue and a museum for our trainer.. trust klopp
❤️❤️❤️
That’s the best way to start my day. Thank you LFC, Jurgen and your coaching staff. 🙏🏾
Thankyou klopp.. thankyou liverpool
YNWA
Great news 😊 greetings from Azerbaijan to big and fantastic Liverpool family 😊👍
In klopp we trustt
MADE MY DAY!!!
The coach after him will have a tough time I imagine haha
Thank you mrs klopp for staying your husband is a legend
Great news!👍🏻😊
Absolutely fantastic news. Great manager, character and most importantly a lovely human being. Liverpool are blessed to have him in the charge. 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️YNWA Jurgen 👍
Thank you Mr Klopp.
That shows how bad german media is working. Because all we get from them is that he will either retire OR go to Bayern Munich after a sabbatical year.
Get in!! 😍👏🏻🤗💪🏻 🚩 YNWA 🚩
What a coach ❤️❤️❤️
Mantap Klopp! Lets's marching on, onwards & upwards! together!
Brilliant man-manager and tactician! Let's enjoy the ride with him and the team while it lasts. After he is gone, it may be  quite a while before another like him....... comes along. YNWA!
Best coach of the world
Somelike dsai
Spurs fan here. Very happy to see him staying, very good news for the Premier League.
Let the good times roll on!
Thanks ULLA!
Waouh it's so privilege to have a manager like klopp for Liverpool club and i am so happy to hear this we all appreciate your hard work to this club💪💪💪💪
He gave me such great and happy moments.. Danke Jürgen, to you, your staff and the boys on the pitch!
v think some one should buy Mrs Klopp a giant bunch of flowers  to show our thanks to her for telling him to stay
LETS TALK ABOUT SIX BABY!!!!
I think that there is no LFC fan who does not like Klopp😎 He is the best thing that happened to the club❤️
thank you missis klopp
In the bigger picture, this is perfect. In the next 2 years, when Mo, Mane, Bobby, Hendo, Virg, Joel, Thiago, Fabs etc, are all getting further in to their 30s, Klopp will still be there to see the transition phase from them, to our existing young players, or any new transfers coming in.  If he decides to move on after the next 4 years, whoever comes in next (hopefully Stevie is doing great things still, and can be a success at Liverpool) is already in a perfect position to hit the ground running.
One of the best days of my life
YNWA
Yes love that Koop your the best coach go Liverpool I live in Aus and I watch them at 2am and also you waved at my grandad
The man who make Liverpool great again..🙏🔥
Mensch Klopp die Heimische Liga brauch dich. Und bitte kaufen Spieler aus England und Spanien in der BL wurde genug rausgekauft das muss jetzt erst nach wachsen 🇩🇪🇩🇪😅
I was LFC supporter since I was 10(1972) u one of The legend couches..thanks for everything you done..
Best news made my week
It is great for all of Liverpool, not just the football club.
YOU DANCER 🥳
Mator sakalangkong klopp
I can't believe the magic continues, I really hoped Klopp would be going after seeing what he built. It was not fair for him to build the team, this time is time to enjoy his hard work. He built us from from the bottom up. We will always love you Klopp more than our own family sometimes
👊🏾❤🔥💪🏾
Pelatih seumur hidup 🤣🤣😌
OK, now MO will sign the contract for sure🖐
Tanx Klopp
BEST NEWS I COULD HEARRR!!!! BEST MANAGER ITW!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so glad that jurgen is a red.🎶
Whole staff stays, most important thing. Klopp hand picked almost all of them, they don’t get enough credit for the success of this club
Couldn’t be happier😘
Mohon kepada manajemen liverpool, tolong buatkan patung klopp, this is legend 👏
Paisley, Shankly and Klopp! Thank you for everything you’ve done for our club! You made this club a family again!  Thanks to Ulla and for another 4 amazing years ❤️  YNWA ❤️

Alhamdulillah, ramadhan mubarakk...
GET IN
Who the hell, wouldn’t want this? Belong in an asylum if you don’t like it
overrated manager, ten hog gonna bring united to top
Lothars wife wanted to stay at inter. Lothar divorced her and went back to bayern. 😂
this comments are literally 100% positive. unbelievable
Best news ever....dont care about salah contract saga...really care about klopp more than anybody..build a statue for ULLA
Ulla deserves to be alongside JK when we make his statue
Best news everrrr, pls stay forever jurgen!!!!
I'm not a liverpool fan but Jurgen Klopp is the best coach ever....Congrats Liverpool for securing this amazing coach
Who doesn't love this guy?
I met the guy when he first came to Liverpool and on hearing him speak about his vision for Liverpool and himself I was just blown away. Being an old fan i had seen it all and maybe my love for the game was starting to wane. But I walked away that night with all the old passion and feelings for football once again. The football that we play now is up there with  the best from the 70s etc which is a joy to watch . He hasn’t just brought us football he has made us realise that if we want something and work hard together as a unit we can achieve our goals but not as one but together as one team. Jurgen , thank you . I wish you success and happiness
What great news for LFC  brilliant Manager in Klopp and all his Coaching 👋 team and brilliant Players I hope Best Luck for rest season 👍 👏 you'll Never Walk  Alone 😔 Liverpool Fan also Sending you  some  Irish Luck 😀 👍 😉
Great News
Wow I am so happy, I've been wanting this for age's. When you are ready sign for longer please jurgen.
This is an early Christmas present for all Liverpool fans around the world. Live it, thank you Liverpool, thank you Jurgen. Absolutely wonderful news.
Please bertahan lah di Liverpool dan jdilah legenda manager di Anfield
They made a right decision!  Come on REDS!!!!
Agaa war asal ah waye Jürgen
The people that was saying his time was over last year, they don’t deserve him, he’s such a humble human being with a lot of love and good heart. He is a Liverpool living legend
Thank you so much Ulla!!
I'm in love with him and I feel fine ❤️😊
Ulla better get a statue somewhere in the city too!
Only two??? BS, make it two decades man!! Life won't exist without Klopp at the Kop
Bos Klopp nanti mudik gak ?
Yes yes yes yes
Even if u do not like Liverpool. U love klopp just a fab human being as well as being a great coach. Liverpool are blessed to have such a lovely man
Best news I’ve had this year!  Mrs. K wants to stay so that’s what is happening.  Anybody who has been married for any number of years knows that when the Mrs. is happy everybody is happy.

Welcom welcom again boss
An extra 2 years? You can stay an extra 200, if you like!
I will thank the person behind all this, the person is Mrs Klopp. If she doesn't share the same vision with Jurgen Klopp, if she doesn't make him happy or not support his stay at Liverpool, there is nothing our good manager can do, everything will just crumble but thanks to Mrs Jurgen Klopp for support this great man.
I'm so glad jurgen is a red!!
Good decision Mr Klopp and Mrs Klopp .
Best signing ever 💪🏻
Great news for Football Liverpool And EPL
Stay for long plzzzz
You could extend it by a lifetime and I wouldn't mind. Best manager in the world, best club.

I muss your loud laugh. Best way to stay in Liverpool.
I'm a neutral when it comes to Liverpool, (I'm a Benfica supporter) but I cheered this announcement as if it was in my club. Why? Because I love football, and I love what Klopp has been doing for Liverpool. It's a joy to watch their football.
Thank you Ulla!
I hope that they win the quadruple. That would be really amazing to see.
My life will longer as long as you still at Liverpool

Would have been gutted if he took the break when his contract would have ended in 2024 but he's earned it, glad to see he'll be staying a little bit longer.
I will enjoy
Best manager in the world! So happy he stays
OMG Thank you "Jurgen and Team" for staying with us longer❤❤ God bless you all🕯my Beautiful Liverpool YNWA
Wow what fantastic news. I only just watched another video from yesterday saying that Liverpool, and the Klopp team are in discussions. I'm over the moon at this.
YES MAN!!! I wasn’t ready to take a risk on a new coach because I don’t want our club to turn into Manchester United.
A great Coach in the best team. What else we have to ask for! Enjoy four more years of blessed football lads! Congratulations from Colombia, the land of Lucho Díaz. Thanks a lot for giving the colombian fans the honor of being part of this great club. You'll never walk alone!
💋💋💋
Time for Mo’s contract next
Love jurgen ❤️
The best signing this year so far. Thank you Jürgen

Yes! Thank you Ulla. YNWA.

i just wake up and see this news im so happy ain't no cap,WHAT A COACH!
Thanks Ulla!!!
Pep and Klopp must resign from premier league. Please 🙏
Yessssss as good as any on field signing this 👌👌💪💪
For me , Jurgen klopp is the best manager of the world now
The signing of klop is best signing.  He made normal players in to world class players.
So will stay till 2026 right???
A lot of title are not a dream
I knew that Jurgen Klopp is not  going in 2024, not even in 2026. He may end his career in Liverpool. The love affair between Liverpool and Klopp or between Klopp and Liverpool is too strong to be broken.  This is a big disappointment to those huge money clubs waiting to buy Klopp. It's not about money when it comes to Klopp and Liverpool. Best match. Marriage made in heaven. YNWA.
What ?????? Hell no this is outrageous what do you mean  2 more years in Liverpool  ??? I was hoping another 10 more years .. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yess..!! Thanks you Mr.Klopp..
Couldn’t be a better news, thank you for letting us to continue enjoying the beautiful game and to bring  even more success to LFC .
That’s amazing news! And after that Jurgen, can you be our Prime Minister…? 🙏🙏🙏❤️YNWA❤️
Great news for club and fans. Congratulations Reds
Love you big man! ❤️
Just a FANTASTIC COACH 🏆
he's the reason I'm I'm liverpool fan.  and mo👑 of course

Best start to the morning!!! Wonderful manager and human being. We are all so lucky to have him
I preferred all players sign out but the boss stay because he is the main factor of this years success and trophies
What this man has managed to do with our club is absolutely ridiculous. He really does deserve a statue
I grew up watching some of the greatest players led by the greatest managers....I actually got a little teary eyed when I heard this, this man has become a legend on par with the greats of our past, I wish he could stay forever and i could live forever to watch him and this amazing team he has given us.
So happy for LFC and Jurgen Klopp!!!
Best manager in the world
Brilliant. Such an honor.

🎶 Jurgen said to me you know, We’ll win the Premier League you know, He said so, I’m in love with him and I feel fine…  I’m so glad, that Jurgen is a Red, I’m so glad, he delivered what he said🎶
We are alone without you .thank you  JK to stay another 2 years.
Well done Klopp. Well done. We trust on you. 🔴
LETSSS GOOOOOOOO
I think every single Liverpool fan is absolutely delighted to hear this announcement. The job Klopp has done so far can't be described in enough positive words. It would be an understatement to say the last 6 years have been amazing for our club. Looking forward to Liverpool's even brighter future.
Good husband 😁
Thank you Jurgen🙌👌👊
Nice one gaffer.
Kopp thank you♥️♥️♥️♥️
Klopp! Klopp! Klopp!  Why? Why? Why?  Why every day Mane? Yesterday he was able to score again!  a little respect for a player who made you win a lot of trophies.  Every time he is a little ahead of the race for the personal trophy, you cut him off.  the truth is that you are a racist, and you know that Sadio is indispensable.                                 you are racist because you have a small memory.  you are racist because you quickly forget.  you quickly forget because you have no culture, to know good manners, and to be able to respect and appreciate the expertise of the other.  Whether you like it or not, Sadio is the best player in Africa and one of the 3 best players in the world with Benzema and Mbappé.
⚽️⚽️⚽️🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇
Thank you Ulla!!!
Love you Jurgen great news I am so happy. Ps your misses has great taste in where to live. YNWA!!

Respect Jurgen .... That is a hard job. Respect to your wife and family also. Great for you you deserve  to be happy.
Klopp! Klopp! Klopp!  Why? Why? Why?  Why every day Mane? Yesterday he was able to score again!  a little respect for a player who made you win a lot of trophies.  Every time he is a little ahead of the race for the personal trophy, you cut him off.  the truth is that you are a racist, and you know that Sadio is indispensable.                                 you are racist because you have a small memory.  you are racist because you quickly forget.  you quickly forget because you have no culture, to know good manners, and to be able to respect and appreciate the expertise of the other.  Whether you like it or not, Sadio is the best player in Africa and one of the 3 best players in the world with Benzema and Mbappé.
Best day ever!
Mantaaaab coach....
I'm Just So So So Extremely Happy & Delighted 😀🙂🥲 it's Good News for we Kopites & Team Liverpool we wish you a long healthier life Klopp To you we believe & Trust It's gonna be Awesome forever man 😉😀
Lieber Jürgen, alles Gute aus Dortmund und weiterhin viel Erfolg 👍
We all way “Trust in Klopp “
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I wish I could like this announcement more than one time.
The Best coach
Jürgen Klopp is looking more and more like ernest hemmingway.  "It takes a person two years to learn to speak and a lifetime to learn to be silent."
Why not get the owners to sign a  big money deal for 10 years,  its a non brainer, let's dominate
I absolutely WORSHIP this man! <3
I'm so glad that Jurgen is a red!!!!
Liverpool Happy and face it... The Premier  League is happy also.... The Face of the league...the face of the Club.. OneDon
👋 THIS NEWS IS BETTER THAN A BIRTHDAY PRESENT X2. KLOPP 💯🙏
Great news for all lfc fans Bad news for others....lol...😎

🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Mbah Klopp♥️♥️♥️

Signing Jürgen Klopp & Co. has been Liverpool's best deal of decades
Its his new song that has made him sign his extension🤣...we need to add another verse now...  Jurgen's glad that he is a Red....2 more years on his contracts what he said....Ulla wants to stay you....take us all the way you know, she said so....I'm in love with them and I feel fine...   We are in such a lucky period to have Jurgen at our club...he has built and will continue over the next 4 years to build a squad that can compete with the very best for the next decade to come.
Thank you Mrs Klopp, you’re the MVP.
Jürgen Klopp, you are my hero
❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️ Thank you Boss I love you 😍

Ok, we're fucked for next couple years to come 😭😭
Thank you so much especially Ulla. 😍😍😍
How is there any doubt about this man being the best. Tbf to pep, he has never had the challenge of building a team with less money so maybe it's unfair to judge. But klopp has pushed the limits on an average premier league budget, what a manager!!👑
He's the best thing to happen to LFC in my 33 years.
Thank you Ulla! Thank you Jurgen!!!
That god for Klopps wife! We all feel lucky to have you Kloppo!
Legendary coach other than alex ferguson ... Congratulations Sir.. 🇮🇩 LFC INDONESIA
Absolutely delighted Klopps staying!
Give Ulla a contract too! Klopps our biggest signing! We'd be lost without the boss
Still as modest as ever!  We're so glad that you're a red.
Thank God. Congratulations sir. I hope Salah and Mane will offered and sign the continue contract soon. Together, they'll creat great achievements and become legends of LFC and EPL.
As a Red's fan, we honour to have you here🤝
Dear Jurgen Klopp, you are the reason I am more passionate about football and togetherness. Your values are just pure and bringing those values to the club takes hardwork. I salute you and thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything that you gave us Boss. I'm feeling like I really have a huge family now.
Finally some good news in 2022!
Yesssss let’s goooo kloop come on🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴

We should rename the Kop end the Klopp end! What a man. I hope you stay with us for another 20 years! YNWA.
Great coach 👍 have to admire him and his achievements at Liverpool, from a man utd fan

I'M GLAD THAT JURGEN IS A RED  YNWA
Thought he was going to announce that he was going for the Man Utd job
One hundred percent (in Klopp's voice) 😅
whatever happens over next four seasons, klopp will continue to be a legend in my eyes.

Fantastic news. Knowing Klopp will be at Liverpool for 4 years wont do any harm to contract talks will new and existing players. Timing is perfect.
The right man, in the right place, with the right skills, and the right attitude towards his position and especially his players. This can only yield  more success, and aren't we lucky to be able to witness this story in the wonderful club that is Liverpool!!!!!!
Danke Jürgen ❤️👍🏻

Bester Mann der Jürgen 👍🏻
Great news! Hopefully Pep L can stay long term and not get headhunted for a Manager role 👌
I´m having a rough time at the moment (struggling with a depression episode like I do every year) and watching LFC these times is one of the few things that brightens up my day and make me smile. This announcement made me cry my eyes out...and I´m still sobbing...Jürgen and his staff have no clue whatsoever what this means to some of us...it´s just pure hope, joy nd happyness...I can´t express my gratitude to him, his wife and all his coaches. I´m so grateful for this human being.
Best export of Germany..Best ambassador  Thank you so much... German quality n efficiency is indeed proven again
Love frm India ❤️ 🇮🇳
Well in lad!!! Klopp has been a big part of Liverpool making regular players a lot more recognizable and a lot more better. Keep up the good work!
The biggest Legend already, a bless to have a coach like you. Before we had you as our coach i was shure you will succeed here if you join. Look what happened.. thanks to you and also your stuff! Its not only you, the whole coach stuff, all stuff, players, cooks.. thanks a lot.. we love this club! Forever!
best thing that happened this year!
What a Manager. Love from Bangladesh  🇧🇩🇧🇩
Thank you jurgen! Its an honour to have you as our manager!
I’m so happy to have best coach
👏👊💪
Great news. Looking forward to another news announcement in 2 years time.
This will attract more players wanting to play for the Boss.
Thanks a lot boss ,
We more than glad that you guys are staying,we thankful🙏
Not a Liverpool supporter (Tottenham for me) but this man is a person you can’t help but like. Congrats Mr Klopp, good to have you in the Premier league.
When he arrived, he took Liverpool from having no chance of winning the title, to a few years later 'can Liverpool win the title?' to now 'can Liverpool win the QUADRUPLE?'. That sums him up and how much he changes other clubs and this club. The recruitment since he came in has been absolutely off the charts. He can't possibly do much more and we couldn't ask for more from him. I was worried it was coming to an end with his supposed upcoming departure in 2024, but this news is delightful and a gift to us Liverpool fans. We appreciate everything that you have done for the club. Long may it continue Jürgen, we absolutely love you! ❤ 💪
Thank you Lord for Ulla and Jurgen❤
Inilah yang kami inginkan sebagai penggemar berat Liverpool dari Indonesia ,,, bahkan kami berharap Jurgen Klopp akan lebih lama tinggal di kota Liverpool ,,, sampai suatu saat nanti akan ada patung Jurgen Klopp di sudut stadion Anfield bersama dengan para legenda ,,, sebagai bentuk penghormatan yang akan di kenang untuk  selama -  lamanya ,,,
congratulations and thank you!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fantastic news the boss getting a new contract. Proud to follow this fantastic club .thank you Jurgen for everything you do for us reds . Love from all Liverpool supporters in Argentina YNWA 🇦🇷❤
Love you Jurgen.  You're my hero.  ❤️❤️

Need to have a statue for this man ❤❤ YNWA
YESSSSS~~~~~~~ YNWA
We need a statue of Klöpp next to statue of his Wife in Anfield.YNWA
I am so happy 😀 you are staying wonderful news I love ❤️ it
I feel that once Klopp retires Wayne ROONEY would replace him
thank you boss!!
I am in spain on holiday , it is raining  but i dont care less "as the boss is staying in charge " 😛😛
Brilliant news ….all the best… hope we will win lots of trophies.
boys who coming to party 🍾 for Jürgen🥳
Great news! awesome news!
👍👍👍
best of luck
Was the world expecting Liverpool FC not to retain Kloop? Of course they will retain him for he is an asset, not a liability... He is good for sure!
That is wonderful news. He is a wonderful coach with a special gift for buying players
i think liverpool should contract him until he retire, he bring fresh face on football and bring great tactic and enjoy to watch, depth squad is unbeliavable especially forward
A smile from ear to ear watching this 😄😀
Yessir ♾️🙌🏽
I’m so f**king happy,weight off shoulders has been lifted and time for more fun with seriously the best human in world football. Cheers kloppo! ♥️
HUAAAAA!!!!!!!!
Best signing in this century
Legend
King klopp.
BUILD A STATE FOR ULLAH ASAP
I just don't see him anywhere else after what he's done with Liverpool. It's like he was born for this club
What a manager what a man 4 more amazing years with this amazing manager YNWA ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks Ulla i guess! :)
Viestur! Are you happy???
It’s great to have you gaffer. More happy 4 years. Seeing you guiding reds to their best. 😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‍🔥
I'm so glad
Liverpool well stay in the top for more 2 years
Boss is back 🎉🎉🎉
Good to hear boss
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Thank you boss ❤️
Allez Papa Jürgen!!
Was hoping he would come take care of arsenal lol
Yes come on Jurgen what a man!!! ❤️❤️YNWA
Yeeeeaaaaaaaah !!!!!
Not enough!.. LFC should also tie down both sadio mane and mo salah fit at least another 3-4 years. Both are 30 years of age, but I strongly believes that the duo can still be a force to recognized at least until they are 33 years old. Besides that, LFC should also continues try to sign more speedy and talented players around the globe. Just don't stop this hardworks yet!. YNWA💪👍🇲🇾
Badly wanted him as Next Real Madrid Manager  😥😥😥... but so what... Liverpool are doing very good... so best of luck to all of them
Well done fella. Doing a fab job👍
Congratulations. Great news.
hes like a father figure in football
Great News, love you boss.
Cool. When you think it's time to move on, could you come up the A565 and see if you can sort out Southport?
Boss! 🇺🇿❤️
Best signing the club has made in my lifetime , Klopp the German Scouser YNWA
Congratulations, great for Liverpool and great for all Juergen Klopp

♫ I’m so glad that Jürgen is a red…
I can't believe it I'm absolutely thrilled what a legend Jurgen Klopp 🔴❤️Y.N.W.A
YES!!!!
Awesome, News.
Thank you, Ulla 😀
German medias hiding their faces now. Bunch of idiots. Jürgen Du bist einfach der Beste 👍
YESSSSSS
We will have a great time together.
👏👏👏👏👏 What more you can say about this man absolutely woow ❤️❤️
Congratulations 4 years of pure excitement signed. As a lifetime fan of Borussia Dortmund who wasn't interested in PL that much, Kloppo as we called him changed this. I guess i better dont mention how boring the Bundesliga have been the last 10 years... PL is way more interesting 🤷‍♂️ You deserve this man, great Team, You'll never walk alone!!!
We still need you a lot
The only people who will be unhappy at this extension are Utd and City fans, Chelsea too
I'm aggressively fist bumping the air with a couple tears in my eyes. That's how incredible the journey has been so far, so happy we're getting a couple of extras seasons of this ride.   YNWA
You can stay as long as you want
I love this team
Great new!!! I love the work you're doing 💪
Damn! A dagger through me heart When is it gonna end😢

Just 2 more years? That’s too short.
great news for you the fan's and club
Definitely done as a push for the lads to try and get the quad! Nice one!
Thank you Ula 😊

Best news this year
You Liverpool supporters are sooo blessed to have THE BEST COACH in the world. Im from Germany and know Klopps legacy from Mainz and Dortmund. He is also one of the veeeery few Coaches in this world who never got kicked as a coach. What he has done ind Mainz and Dortmund was already amazing. The football he lets his teams play is the most enjoyable to watch, and Im saying that as an Arsenal Fan! Congrats Liverpool, Klopp is gonna bring you more  Trophies this season and the next 4 seasons to come. But more and most important for all the Fans, Liverpool will continue to play the most atrractive style of football for years to come! Congrats from an Arsenal Fan!
Legend all ready, And a lot more to come fantastic news . Bad news for the rest of the league 💪😃🔥

What a good news to LFC and the fans. Thank you Jurgen for choosing to stay and as a fan, we can see Liverpool continous winning. YNWA.
Klopp is a phenomenon. He comes to Dortmund and build that Club up to world class. He comes to Liverpool and build that Club back to world class.  When he leaves, Liverpool will hopefully do better than Dortmund.
wow terima kasih untuk berita bagus ini we love you jurgen klopp
Yesssss
Love you klopp!
NICE NEWS MISTER..
I watching it and i smile all the time, till the end :)
The Goat !  YNWA
Should I start worrying already what would be after 2024 !!!
What a day
As a Gooner, it gives me hope. A bit of time, a true vision regarding where the club goes and a personality like Herr Klopp's can work wonders. Congrats Liverpool fans. Cherish this man. He is your Wenger. Hope a bit of time also makes Arsenal true competitors.
Love you coach! The best coach in the world! 🥰
It's a crazy good news, Thanks so much BOSS ..... Yeahhhh
Mia San Mia
Omg!!!! Yes!!!!!!!!!!! Danke!!!!!!!!!! YNWA!!!!!
Yes!!!!!! We always support you from everywhere in the world 🌍🌎
we love you to Bro!! Just need Salah to sign next and we are set!
well it will be 4 years of rebuilding because he's got the oldest team in the PL right now. Call me a cynic but coincidentally Simeone has also extended his stay at Madrid by 2 years, meaning Klopp will now walk into a £50m salary 2 years later than planned
I love this man! So humble but also so driven. After so many heartbreaking years of "almost", I appreciate everything he has done for our club and will never take a single moment for granted. Never a doubter, always a believer. 4 more years!! ❤❤❤❤
I love you Jurgen ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🤟🤟
Is right Jurgen lad brilliant news 4all us reds not sure about any1 else doe haha
Well I can't believe anyone would of not liked it really best liverpool manager in my lifetime by far great news hopefully Salah will be next to announce something similar YNWA 😎😎
Wllhi the moment he said that he will stay for more 2 years I shouted to the loudest of my voice & that is what they call adrenaline
Yeah... Klopp for the KOP... greetings from Indonesia. Love you Klopp..👏
his smile is very re-assuring . Happy to have you here
Алиллуйя!!!!! Да здравствует Юрген Клопп!!!! YNWA!!!
Thank god Ulla wants to stay! 😁
Christmas comes early at LFC.

YNWA
Brilliant come on klopp
"My wife wants to stay so like any good husband..." and "Like a bad smell, I'll stick around."  Just the most humble and self effacing person in football. By a mile.
No other manager can do such smart signings what he has done over the years. His moto is not to go for the buzzing players rather he goes for hard working players.
Jurgen klopp pls win The quadrupal so that mane can win The ballondor
Yess..done👍👍💪💪
👏👏👏👏🔥💪
Thank you Ulla Klopp <3
Yes,yes,yes Thankyou Ulla & Jurgen. YNWA ❤️❤️

🔴❤️
Wouldn't be Liverpool without Klopp. Thank you Jurgen for the incredible job you have done so far, cannot wait to see where the team and you get to at the end of the season let alone end of 2026!! Already a special team, every game is a final, every game under Klopp is a delight to watch, a very special moment in this club's incredible history. Go be immortal!!! YNWA
Man Utd fan here, this news excites me and annoys me! I have always loved this man, so to see him on the screens longer is great, but nooooooo why Liverpool!! 🥲😭🥲😭

Good news , all was waiting  for it .
Klopp the Kopp
the best signing ever! <3
Get in!
I love Klopp's honesty with everything and anything. He will never try to deflect, or make things up to seem bigger than he is just because he is the boss. That is the sign of a true leader, someone who is not afraid to show their human side. That's why Liverpool has, and is, doing so well - Klopp has built more than a team. He has built a family.
Ураааа🥳🥳🥳🥳
The best thing for me untill 2026  Love you jurgen  I hope one day I'll sit in that iconic stadium be a real kop and scream loud as mad to your punch in the air , it's just a dream  YNWA ♥️

Love this man to bits ❤️
Omg such good news, he feels lucky, we feel lucky and his wife is a legend ❤️
🥰😍🙏
Best news ever....thank you jurgen for everything
He's a legend.. Top man.. but an there is a but 😬 he's still only won 1 premier league title so if he leaves with only one that'll be shame cause the squad an style of football is class.. And after all those years when 2024 comes 1 premier title would that still be classed as success?? I think City will take it this year an next..
We love you boss YNWA
The best news for any Liverpool fan anywhere
Only nut jobs wouldn't want jurgen klopp to stay he is the definition of a world class manager he has charisma,his a very exceptional human being, he is humble, he did what he promised us when he signed for the club most importantly he turned lfc into a world class football club from a struggling club and is still improving, to Jurgen I salute him
when i want him to be in liverpool many year ago many people told me he is not good enogh and now he will stay with us that is the best news i get in this year
we want you to stay forever
That's the best news any Liverpool fan can get!🏆🔴⚪️
Very happy. I follow from Miami. That  gives me four more years to go to Anfield 😊
Love it
ynwa boss😘😘😘😘😘
GET IN !!!
Trying to outlast Pep so liverpool can get a chance to stat pad premier league titles😂
Letttss goooooo
Tolonglah jorgen klop,beli striker 1 lagi yg sangat tazam,🙏, the best for you liverpool 😘
Why only 2 years more 😭
Jurgen would make a great Father Christmas. Always giving presents.
Lucky for liverpool, disaster for other teams😂😂😄
All hail klopp and his coaches !!!! Ooooosh
Brilliant man!!!!!!!!
the best thing that has happened .. since a Time ... Ich freue mich sehr
Oh my gods this is the best news ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best coach in the world
Best signing....
Love you, Jürgen. Thank You
In Klopp We Trust 💪🏾🔴  Build that statue now!!
You are really the normal coach. Great coach by all standards. You made me live Liverpool ever and ever and ever
V.good and all the best
Thank you JURGEN!!! FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS💕 💞 ♥️ 💜 💙 🧡 💕 💞
Legendary is the only word that describes him. Thank you Jurgen
If commitment was a person.  Thank you for making us believe
Ive been a liverpool fan since i was born (29 years ago) Jurgen you are my hero 👊 YNWA
Love this coach and club 🙏🏻
YES Awesome!
Woow great news to all of us Jurgen. All the best to you & the team.!!!!!!!
To be honest this is the best news I have received today.
El mejor entrenador del mundo..
😊 yes , what more can you ask for
Im united fan but im very happy  about that information
This is the best thing to happen since winning the Premier League. I have been going to Anfield as a fan since the days of Bill Shankly, these days my seat is in the Main Stand. I think they should make this great man a part owner of the club. He is the best leader that anyone could ask for and an even better human being.
Jurgen want to stay, the couch want to stay and jurgen wife also want to stay. Nothing in this world can stop him now. Maybe I'm a bit SELFISH but I'm hopeful jurgen can stay much more LONGER maybe another 5-10 years contract extension to rebuilt liverpool golden dynasty Era. It's not fair, we have been absent for about 30 years and I want to enjoying this journey together for much more longer period of time.
Brillant this man
Yeah! One of the best manager that I see in this moment. Really happy about this announcement. Thanks Klopp!
what a wonderful message 😊🥰😍💪so happy💞YNWA❤️
💚💚💚💚💚
That’s great news 🥳🥳🥳🥳 such a good coach
Mr. Klopp just gets it doesn't he. I'm in love with here and I feel fine, he said in the clubs press release. We are too Jurgen, we are blessed to have you and your team with LFC. YNWA
Good job Kloppo..... Everybody hoped this..... wow including Ulla. 😂😊😎
Best news ever. Thank you Jurgen for everything 😀😀😀😀😀😀
I am still searching for that one person who doesn’t like this. Love you Klopp!   I'm so glad that Jurgen is a Red. I'm so glad he delivered what he said. Jurgen said to me, you know. We'll win the Premier League, you know. He said so. I'm in love with him and I feel fine.
love you boss
More fist pumps, more hugs, more trophies! What fantastic news for Liverpool!!!!
Was waiting for this day🤩🤩🤩🤩
Congratulations to the LFC organization and fans!

2 more years is exactly what I wanted. So happy. Now let's beat Newcastle.

I think klopp will continue adding 2 years everytime the contract almost run out, until he finds his being is an obstacle to liverpool growth and the club stagnated
OMG can’t believe it. The best news of the season. He is much much more important than any of the player
Wow Jurgen Boss Klopp ,you don't know how excited I am over the news you have just announced. Please pass our word of thanks to Ulla for wanting to stay for four more at Liverpool . Please note that we love you all at the Reds family.🙏🙏🙏🙏🤚❤❤❤

Herzlichen Glueckwunsch, LFC. Ihr habt den Besten Manager im Fussball, den man sich wuenschen kann. Toller Typ, exzellenter Fussball Fachmann, und eine durch und durch ehrliche Haut. Als Deutscher bin ich ein bischen traurig, dass er erst 2026 Nationaltrainer wird, aber ok, gut Ding braucht Weile :) Congratulations, LFC. You have the best football manager you can ask for. Great pal, outstanding football expert, and through and through honest man. As German i am a little sad that Juergen will not become national team manager before 2026, but ok, great things have a long way coming :)
We need you, coach! For other endless years!
I Love Kloop
YNWA

THANK YOU  MRS KLOPP 😘
YEEESSSSSS
The fact his wife is fully supportive and wanting to stay just goes to show the influence the club has had on him and his family. Having support from your partner is extremely important, but I bet this makes him extremely happy and in turn, the family homes happy. Thats the most important thing.
Awesome. Awesome.  Now, Mr Klopp... I have ONE major request.. KEEP ORIGI 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  He wants more regular football n he wants to leave esp coz World Cup is coming up. He is only 27 n he is our lucky charm and a lethal striker.  Unfortunate that his style of play does not suit our style of play for 90 mins. But he is the supersub we can NEVER replace!  It took u almost 6 years to finally create this squad-- the strongest Liverpool has EVER been. Your last piece of the puzzle was to bring in Diaz in January, after Konate in December at the start of this season.  We are perfect now. We r lucky with injuries and suddenly everyone is saying we have the strongest, deepest squad.  And Origi is a big part of that.  NO clubs in world football can ever claim to have a 6th forward with such qualities as Origi. And then we have Minamino and Elliot and Gordon too, to boot, and other youngsters-- some who r on loan.  But Origi is the secret ingredient for our recent surges and achievements and it goes without saying.  He and Minamino have played very important roles earlier in this season in Cup games. Otherwise we wouldn't be at the threshold of something so special now... The Quad is not something easy.  Whatever happens this season, next season, esp if Tottenham don't make top 4, ManCity will be bringing in Haaland and/or Kane.  Unless Liverpool are going to replace Origi with Son Heung Min, please tie up Origi.  We will really regret it if we lose the dynamics we have now by allowing Origi to leave.  Want to keep him HAPPY? He is. He just wants the club to want him enough.  Games wise, just rotate a bit more. In some games u should be doing the reverse substitutions which u rarely do. Allow Origi to play more Cup games and in just a few more league games n I am sure he will be banging in more goals and be very happy, and that gives u a much better chance of all your forwards being fresher and avoiding injuries and also bang in more goals at the end of games when opposition legs are so tired, and imagine Salah or Jota coming in then, after Origi, Mane Diaz or Firmino have already sealed the game by killing it off.  Imagine that.  Origi is an important piece of the puzzle. His attitude is irreplaceable.   I dare say there r only 2 players Liverpool can bring in now realistically that can fit and improve this squad...Wijnaldum and Coutinho. We can get them for much cheaper n I am sure both regret leaving n would have learned their lessons n would want to do more. No harder runner than Wijnaldum...  not many players capable of magic out of nothing from outside the box than Coutinho.  Our midfield needs hard workers and not just magicians and while age is catching up with both of them, if we add these 2 players, we regain that extra we lost in midfield without a doubt.  But I know there will be naysayers esp because of the age factor.  I do believe your team of coaches and recruits have done an excellent job, so if those 2 r impossible, no prob.  But please...Origi is 27.  No excuse there. I have already said how he can get just that few extra games he craves and deserves.   That will really work in favour of more success and less injuries for Liverpool.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

The best thing about him is the lads are totally excited to play under his management, you can see how much do they like him, how strong connection do they have. I believe he works with the guys as if they were his sons, there's mutual trust and that's just a great environment to work in. We already have a great team and he keeps bringing great guys every season. I'm just glad he stays.
Stay for ever & ever "our man" 🙏
As an Arsenal fan I love this guy......

BOOM baby!!!!!!  + 💥 💥
In Senegal, We love you dear Jürgen Klopp. Everybody behind Sadio Mané loves you. We only need you to understand us. Our nation is not a homogeneous one. All the Senegalese pretending to love Sadio Mané are not sincere. For a better understanding of this situation, you have to know a bit of our actual history and of our current actuality. Things are very intricate here. We just want to let you know that everybody who really loves Sadio Mané, loves you dear Jürgen Klopp as well. As for this new contract of yours, You deserve it dear coach, you deserve even more. We know you are like a father to our boy. And for that we are not going to ask you anything. Because we know that you already know what is good and what is best for him. We only pray that your career would be wonderful and marvellous so much that in your oldest ages no one wants to let you retire. Be you lucky more than any other coach in all the European championships ¡i¡
I love this man with all of my heart
Nice ! We the Kop gonna be on top for more 4 years
You guys are soooo lucky to have klopp. U can't hate this guy
You might as well pack it in now kloppy,  because Eddie howe's black and white army is taking over the prem next season..
Hope he can stay 20 years more
What a great coach
I love you. Glad you will stay for another two years. Glad if you stay in Liveprool forever. But I'm writing this for a very simple reason; first and foremost, as a note-reminder towards myself.   If you decided to leave in 2024, which I had thought about it a lot, I had friends ask me about it (knowing my unending love towards the club but, more importantly, seeing themselves that "match made in heaven" of  Liverpool and you) - I would be fine with it. Really. You have given me so much joy;  and sometimes during the most difficult personal times. But times like the ones we are correctly living in aren't personally difficult. They are difficult for all of us, in so many different ways. The whole world has changed. And you, and this team, are the only constant of beauty- or, if that sounds like a hyperbole, one of the very few.  I don't know when every fan fell in love with Liverpool. It depends on their age. For me, it was during the Gerrard years,a bit earlier. I have experienced real lows for this team, with this team. I have cried my eyes out seeing this team crumble, fall, underperform, playing appalling football at times. I have cried all half-time long in Istanbul final, and rejoiced at the end. The word "rejoice" doesn't really say what I felt that night. Neither I can find a word for Gerrard's equalizer against West Ham. I have seen great players, loved them with passion, cried when they left.  I have never seen anyone being the living embodiment of what every true fan of Liveprool didn't even dare to dream. You are that embodiment. All us fans owe great moments; moments we couldn't even imagine before you came.  You really, really make a difference. Yes, it's "just football". But you are responsible for making it something more than that. Liverpool has become a fountain of joy, a stream of happiness, an ocean of true,original positivity. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you. You have given everything and then some. If you decided to leave, I would be glad we had you. I could never feel greedy and ask for more. But I'm as glad as I can be that decided to stay.
Thanks God
Thank you Ulla 😁
I’m so glad that jurgen is a red
Happiest time of me life
Couldn’t be any happier! YNWA boss!
What a coach@
Nobody will stop watching this video because Jurgen Kloop is the best manager in the world. Those people who don't want to watch is MC, MU, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham fans because they know will lose to Liverpool all the times.
Is there any way to make him the permanent manager 🥺
The best move Liverpool has done in the last decade
IM SO HAPPY
He is top, his wife is top too! We love you!♥️
You rock 🔥🔥🔥
Your wife is amazing 😅
IM SO GLAD THAT JURGEN IS A RED
Yeah! Love u  YNWA
"Some will like it some will not" who the F doesn't love Klopp. I will fight u.

Congrats boss
I've been a Liverpool fan for as long as I can remember but what Klopp has done with Liverpool in a short amount of time is just amazing.  I too am also a heavy metal fan and welcome more Heavy Metal Football.  Thank you all at Liverpool Football Club for the joy you bring me and all fans.
Getting those news after a hard day of work. Nothing beats it.
If the team gets more success he will stay more  in world best football club

Yeeeeeesssssss YNWA 👏👏👏👏
WE NEED A SONG FOR MYSTERIOUS ULLA!!!!!!!!!
Worldest best manager of the world 🙌🙈
This is the wrong decision, Klupp.  Liverpool is a mediocre club like most English clubs.   An English club biggest dream is to win the local league becuase they have been consistently smashed whenever they cross the channel to Europe. 🤷‍♂️
literally few days ago i was thinking, we're trying for the quadruple and it'll be amazing if klopp signs another contract extension. suddenly it really did happen, wow maybe a bunch of people manifested for this exact moment <3
Senior Coach 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Im so happy he signed a new contract. YNWA❤❤❤
Best Christmas ever 🏆🏆🏆
Kloppp legend
Good news 😎
you heard it boys, have to go and beg Klopp's wife for another 2 years after this 😂
Kloop Harus jadi legenda liverpoll..❤️❤️❤️
In the interest of cost-savings, while we're putting in the order for bronze for the statue of Big Div, might as well double the order so we're prepared for Jurgen's.
Yessss! Finally we got it.We,the whole liverpool fans were waiting such kind of day and eventually it has reached. What a good news for the liverpool family. Come on,guysss!!
KlOPp King.

Micro-management is the right word for your style of management. Keeping check on every player as well as your staff and never forgetting to cherish your fans. Managing media as well. That's a complete CEO package in a single person. Klop is the CEO of Liverpool.
❤️YNWA

We are blessed beyond words - the closest link between a Manager, his Players, Staff and Supporters in World Sport and we have this ride for another 4yrs. He represents everything about us and it feels greedy to ask for more but he's happy to stay and return the love we have for him - what an incredible Man. It is truly a great time to be a Red. Thank You Jürgen.
Best ever signing for Liverpool. I am so glad Jurgen is red
I'll stick with him all the way... Up's and down... He gave me the satisfaction of Liverpool winning the league... Something I've never felt being a 33 year old person and supporting the club for more than 25 years... I'll forever be grateful... YNWA Jurgen...

Yesssss
Yipeeeeee !!
❤ ❤   L.F.C  Long  live Klopp YNWA
You're amazing for this club. God bless you boss :
Dear Jurgen & the coaching staffs,  You have no idea how much joy you brought to my life. These past few years has been a downfall for me. Covid came, lost my job, lost my relationship, and the worst of all, i lost my father. But because of the joy i got from watching every LFC game eversince you & your coaching staffs came, it washed away my pain. I have been a happier person because of that. And when YOU are the manager of LFC, im not worried of what player the club would be signing, coz you could turn any player into a world class player. YOU are the most important signing of LFC, the day you leave i will cry like a child. I have never felt connected to the club as much as i do right now, eventhough i live thousands miles away. You have made anyone associated with LFC feel like a big family. I still remember what you said in your first press conference, "Its not important what people think when you come in, its more important what people think when you leave". You WILL leave as one of LFC's greatest legend, IF you ever leave.  YNWA From a LFC of 26 years, from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)
We don’t like it! We love it!! ❤️❤️
Great news!!! All I smell is the sweet smell of success!
This is the best signing Liverpool have made since signing Klopp in 2015
Please stay for another 20 years!
best news 👍🏻 woohooo!!
. We Love you Jurgen.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOSS 🙌🏻🤩
Each contract klopp has signed for liverpool will have been the most important signings the club have made.
Liverpool is lucky to have you as coach❤️💯

Nice speech! Thank you Mr. Klopp!
Boom! 🔴 Up the Reds
YNWA
Alhamdulillah, dapat memperpanjang kontrak 😄
Legend! Glad to see he’s still here
YNWA Get IN let’s go…fasten your seatbelts 🙏💗💞💕💞🔆👏🏻👏
The world is a bleak and depressing place at the moment, but Liverpool FC and Klopp are managing to make me smile every single day, that's quite an achievement on its own! Even if they fall short of the quadruple by 1, 2 or even 3, it's still a hell of a ride to be on for the fans and I'm sure we all appreciate it.
The man who turned doubters into believers ❤️
Great news, should have been longer
Hell yes
Welcome to Anfield!

Long Live Emperor Jurgen Norbert Klopp YNWA 🙏 👏  🙌🏼 ❤️   You've written new stories for years to come we shall look back on such legendary footballing journeys, highs or lows by drilling in your knowledge, ideas,instructions,beliefs,hard work, ethics,desire,hunger,passion but most importantly love for our beautiful game our beautiful football club nothing can stop us now. Thank You Emperor Jurgen Norbert Klopp
Thx Jürgen ❤🇵🇱
Im so glad Jurgen is a red 🔥
Thanks for all you have done for our club and the pride and joy you have given us! Great news you have decided to stay for longer.  Just being able to challenge for the trophies again, and 'give it a try' as you say against clubs with endless oil money and resources has been a miracle!  I will not be disappointed if we don't win anymore trophies (despite the stupid media hype) as the journey is just as important and it has been fantastic!  We are one of the most exciting teams in the world to watch!  YNWA
Thank you Jurgen ....  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I miss Mr. Klopp with those attractive glasses
Thanks Jurgen, to more years with a fantastic person like you, how I wish I had a Dad like you, I just love the way you treat yr players on and off the field , u evn  turn average players into super stars....YNWA.. All the way from Zimbabwe♥️♥️

Drooling
Klopp is the SOUL of the Liverpool.
Good night everybody it's 10:16PM at Nepal 🇳🇵❤️
Liverpool
Its 12 pm in Toronto
Wow
Liverpool and Klopp are a match made in heaven. The club has an certain ethic to it, and so does the manager. Manchester City is only successful cause of daddy’s oil money. This club has heart.
Thank you!
I’m not even a Liverpool fan but this is better than Salah signing a new contract. Klopp has done an insane job at Liverpool and without him the only player in the starting 11 that would be there is Henderson. Aswell as all this his net spend is one of the lowest in the league.
Get in we can all relax safe in the knowledge we're gonna be living our best life for another 4 years😍
Bosss 🔥🔥🔥❤
no jurgen, the lucky one is us. thank you. ynwa
I don't mind Klopp staying at Liverpool for as long as he wants, one of the best football manager we ever had. _In Klopp, We Trust._
Wow Big Boss and Big News 😍
wow
HALLELUJAH ( a la Handel) Prayers answered
this is a very good coach for this team
Jurgen is the best coach, he makes us love football, it doesn't matter if you are a liverpool supporter
Christmas is now officially the 28th April! Just the best news ❤️ YNWA
The wife 😍😍😍 loves to stay so he is staying
A true legend! Hope he stays for even more
🙏🙏🙏
I love You, Boss♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
We love you Klopp.❤️  Love from India.❤️
Boooooom!
I am 100% fine with the decision😅
❤️❤️❤️ I can’t put into words how happy this makes me. I absolutely adore Mrs Ulla Klopp!!!!
Yesssssses
So we have the best manager in the world who will complete 11 years in 2026. What a privilege.
Thank you Jürgen! We love to here this. YNWA

My idol 🔴
Yes yes yes so happy
LEGEND
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY , You've made my day Jurgen , Thank you.
Klopp 4eva mate
Thank you Mrs. Klopp!
❤️
Excellent decision 👏 🥇⚽️
yessss...
Fantastic news. People saying he would likely leave to awaken another sleeping giant like AC Milan cannot grasp the effort that it requires, he has done that at two clubs before, and it would need a younger version of Klopp to embark on a fourth adventure. Here he knows he has no pressure, he even managed to get through a six successive defeat streak unscathed so why leave? Players like Henderson, VVD, Thiago are taking new players under their wings so a heavy burden is off his shoulders. It's time for him to get more trophies because he deserves to.
I love this Club and I love this man! GERMAN FELLA
Good decision boss
Love it ❤
Good to know Jurgen is just like the rest of us - he does whatever his wife wants!
the club's best signing within the past 10 years!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Best day ever 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Yeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssss . the best boss all over the world 🌎😁
Jurgen you gave us a very very big hug,thank you so much BOSS
If Jürgen completes this new 4 year tenure at Liverpool, he will be 3rd on the all-time list in terms of games as an LFC manager. He currently has the highest win percentage of all LFC managers and he already surpassed Kenny Dalglish in number of games won. With 4 good years, Jürgen even has a slight chance to surpass Shankly and become the top winning manager in our history.  We're witnessing history here. What a time to be alive, to be an LFC fan.  Best of luck, Jürgen! We are with you, all the way. Greetings from Israel.
Hello boss!
sarange hae young won hee
Yes Yes Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good news, I'm banking on more PL titles and we'll surpass ManU

The best new ever ever in the world

Klopp 🔴🟥🔴🟥🔴YNWA
I’m a united fan and I want to cry 😢
Thanks Ulla !
Thank God
Best news I’ve heard all year, we love you Jurgen.
What in THE hell!!! Seriously??? I can't handle 4 more years of bloody feckin quadruples!!!!! C'mon Jurgen old son have a heart! Like in JAWS.... "we're gonna need a bigger trophy cabinet"! Apparently Ulla loves the weather it seems... and maybe that Jurgen serenade.🤪 We have 4 years to get 4 quadruples.... some say poetic.... Reds say.... destiny is our byatch and Jurgen has the whip!😋
Love this Jurgen. The coach, The Leader, The man......
Yessssssss 🙏

YESSS, JURGEN IS STAYING!!!
YNWA Jurgen
This really is turning out to be possibly the best season ever for us reds. Great news.

NOW Mo will sign….

😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Thank you!
Omg thank you so much jk ❤ YNWA 💪🏽
I love our club as well, yergeeen. . 😁 Yesssssss! What a happy news!
Amazing news! I remember when he signed trying to explain the gravity of it to one of my friends who didn't watch much football. I said it's like Messi wanting to come to 7th place Liverpool, when he could go to any team in the world. I've watched Liverpool since '96 and this is by far as good as things have ever been. A possible third CL final in five seasons feels almost normal.
this is great news, players can come and go but a manager like klopp is indispensable for us. YNWA
made my day!
I fucking love this man so much
Well done klopp u absolute football legend
We love you Jurgen I’d happily let you have my kids 😍🤣🤣
YNWA❤️❤️❤️
Great news
Mr Klopp, i want to thank you very very much for bringing so much joy and happiness in my life. I believed in your success as our manager from the moment you first signed that contract.  As a fan, as a person and as a man who is looking to hold on to something that can take me a little further out of the demon called depression, i salute you SIR.
Great news !
This is the greatest day ever <3
YES BOSS…… love it YNWA
Bless the Klopp family for wanting to stay
Liverpool's best signing, no asking!
