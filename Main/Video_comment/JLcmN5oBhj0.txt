What do you think of my brand new office & the Sony INZONE M9 Monitors & H9 Headset?
Vikkstar it looks amazing
Links?!?!?!
Bros pc is insane
c-c-can i come over?
This is so sad compared to JJ’s setup 💀💀
The amount of money these “influencers” get paid is honestly baffling like imagine getting paid this much to not contribute to society and even hurt it… and I’m sure people are gonna I’m salty or to cry more but y’all know deep down I’m right lol
Bro urdu
Builds his ultimate game setup and has been MIA ever since 🤦🏻‍♂️
vikk kinda look like (Funny Uber Rides)for some reason
all that extra stuff just to have one monitor
VIK it is time for an updated tourrrrrr
All I can say is … get a life
RalphStar456
Nothing is impossible ❤
10:42 It was sooo hype when I saw you at EDC Orlando, it was legit a childhood dream come true and I didn’t even see it coming
This setup is better than mine Vikk,Good job u deserve it
when is part 2 of this video coming ?
What desk is that
Thanks
Built this just to not post no gaming videos for a year on here
Update on houseee
What is the best gaming laptop for 1.5k pounds
anyone know whats the name of the chair?
Aaah a man cave every introvert men’s dream
Sell the play buttons to jacksucksatlife 😅😂😂
his is miles better than minister's setup!!
Where’s the new updated house tour?
This set up is prob worth more than most people houses
I love the setup but I think as a cod player I’m a bit sad to see he didn’t add the London royal raven led
Yeah, I'll be copying this setup at some point in life.
Vol got them gta dances down
You built a gaming setup and never uploaded playing games ever since.
I like the paneling that’s cool!!!
Vik and Simon easily have the best set ups in the Sidemen.
Worst of the sidemen
*The dude just made this huge setup only to not upload…*
I like before more than after
Your house and your everything in your office is great vikkstar123
You deserve it Vikk, enjoy!! ❤❤
For the record his pc costs over 7 grand to recreate!! 😅
I’m not even a gamer but this is unreal
Damm Vikk should upload more. Plzzzz
What’s the leds?
Steep
damn man, well deserved
What led lights are those
Where is bro
This dudes setup will let him detect the players future moves and predict the future
Much more cooler than my set up!
Are you guy from among us my name was arab muslim
I remember how you were just a regular YouTuber starting and now look at you😭
why he stopped postin
What type of LED lights are those?
damn vikkstar really got that kone pro air   you know he has got a drag clicking mouse
Can you upload a new video already, do a house tour soon pls
why did you turn to the dark side vikkstar, i trusted you with everything...
this year they should do a new music video to christmas drillings with vikks remix! that’d be amazing!
This is the best one
guys why hasnt he uploaded recently?anyons know
Enjoy enjoy
Wish techno had a room like this man used to play like a god in a closet
My Hello’s Happy Holiday’s🎈🎈
I know this is extremely off topic but some guy at my school is literally your doppelgänger wtf same haircut same glasses same everything bru
put a pool table in the back of your kitchen room and you could get one that can turn into a  table
I love your videos
crazy 3 months later still no videos
Bro built the god setup just to not upload/stream.
eagerly waiting for the updated house tour
144hz is not maximum
Vikkstar you should do a collaboration with tos girls a 2 hour vlog an hour for them and another hour for the sidemen because it would be the next great video of the sidemen do helping out the girls go big too so please if you do read this please consider this in future because I can’t wait for it too happen and it has too be your video for sidemen Sunday
You go live please Vikkstar
Ksi being racist cancel the sidemen. Keep spamming this message. To ksi It's not a mistake when it's toward the black community ksi overeacts and plays victim but for against its fine. Look at the double standards and hypocrisy.
Cancel sidemen for racism.
Noice
Do I let your friends say the word Paki in there and just laugh it off.
And that was the last Vikkstar video ever, He went to go work with the sidemen and leave his own channel. Sad
You are my I am big fan big from big the fan
A nice setup for the videos you don’t upload!
Vikkk I line you setp
Hi vikk if ur still located in london can i please come for a tour of ur office cause i am a huge fan and i have been watching ur vids since day one
Anyone from India🇮🇳????
Vik's setup is still better than all of the sidemen 🙌
I never thought anyone could top Vikks new set up, until I saw Simons. It’ll be cool to eventually see all 7 sidemen with an insane set up like JJ, Vikk and Simon
simon bettter
No god but Allah   Islam way for peace and real monotheist  Search about the truth with honest heart
Crazy 😮
Thanks!
Mm7
Yo
hes such a cutie pie omg
7 fucking play buttons wowow
That setup… it’s like something from a sci fi movie that was bought into the real world. Nevermind 10/10, I’d probably give it it 11/10.
Vikk definitely has the best taste in cars/houses/decor
Aye just watched the sidemen roast n honestly your ability to laugh at yourself as well as supply the bet jokes is top tier forever a legend
Mm7
Vik is the true mvp.
Play hargwards legacy multiplayer with all the sidemen please
Vikk you’re the man, I’m sure you’ll make your fiancé very happy
Vikk actually spent money lol
When Vikk posts my day goes even better 🙌✨
Where are you bro
to be fair though
F
man i remember your cod commentarys with like 50k subs then i lost track of u now look at this big mansion and almost 8m subs what a legend
Scared vikk isn’t posting this year
better fps with headphone😂
just came back from vikk getting jumpscared by an fun snap
you see the track at 9:40
You deserve it vikk
Look @ our boi winning #itsthe123 ♥
*kon built my dream office and setup*
Yo I just found out that my teacher is your cousin
Vik is the GOAT
boshhh
Anyone know where I can get those textured hex panels?
ark 2 coming out soon you trying to play
Can I please get a beefy Sidemen pc🙏
do a sponsored wedding , a pretend one with fake wife or husband ...... marry ethan , instant family
New intro to all videos should be "hey guys, it's the 123"
this is sick vikk ur one of my fav youtubers ever                                still f u u curry muncher
Vik knows how to flex
vikk teaches Kai rap
Man this looks so sick
Now use it 😂
Where's the piano at? 🤣
vik is STONE COLD on the decks and the best sidemen member
I'm happy for Vik and all, he deserves this. But is it not a bit out of touch to post this when you make less than a video a week now and it's mostly just sponsored content?
you looking a bit smaller you need to hit that gym consistently brother that's what you got it for afterall
I'm curious if the Sidemen will ever address Logan's crypto scam that stole millions... I love these guys and they seem to genuinely care, but if that's never addressed it will be a bit disappointing how much they promote Logan (who hasn't grown up since the suicide forest like he makes out considering this crypto scam he was a part of) I'd hope they at least talk about it if not cut ties with Logan going forward... idk how JJ can be a business partner with a scammer
Could u play elden ring?
I love technology, especially tech without blades
Love the decks bro! 🎶💯💯🔥
Vik ❤
@Vikkstar123 Why not hang the YouTube Sub plaques around the XIX neon light on the wall?
Play PUBG vikkstar
Pioneer setup of dreams 😍
Vik looks like Seb from too hot to handle season 4
i want a man cave too
never liked JJ to be honest
We Love Vikkstar
Bro copyd and pasted ksi's vid
guys Wht is his twitch name bc I looked it up and his last stream was 5 years ago is there a new channel
Wickstar 👳‍♂️👳🏽‍♂️
santa got put ina spliff lmfao
love u vik i remember your old setups from 2014 you’ve come so far
v
*I built* my Dream setup  Kon:😮
Kon did it I
Nova Lu killed you in fortnite
should've kept the skylight, or make like a hidable skylight
i think its real
I love vikkstar 123 setup congratulations 🥂🥂
His electricity bill 📈
Vik it would be cool if you return to ark because it has changed a lot
Bruh Vikk is so cool
u should play gta rp
You didn’t build it some other guy did
Wait a sec, I thought vik had more than 10 mil subs ngl
We need a new house tour Vik
Well you didn’t, kon did
I like it
Damn... I have seen a lot of sponsors from lesser companies, but Vikkstar over here sponsored by Sony.... Congratulations, bro.
Best setup i've ever seen, any chance of u coming back up to Sheffield?
you didnt build it
Ngl this is a FIRE GAMING ROOM, very well done.
You built?
Congrats on the new setup Vik!
where did you get your desk and what name is the coolor on it? ps awsome set up :)
I love vik
Swear vik doesn’t even upload anymore ?
This was the best
The sidemen must do a hide and seek in vikstar 123 house
wow snakeing con like that yh
So proud of how far vikk has come , defo favourite sideman
OMG just subscribed amazing  just amazing
To be fair tho, vik has the best house and office of all the sidemen😂
No way it’s about to be DJ vikk star
Pls more house updates
Love your gaming room
Thought he deactivated this channel it’s been that long
have you got a link for the desk plz
Man has alan walker as a tutor, that's how clear he is
It's the 123
Inspirational beyond belief, congratulations Vik, thoroughly deserved. 👑
Anyone know what mouse vik uses ?
Personally what i would do with all of the plagues i would hang them up on a wall and little distance apart and put text on some type of material above it saying when the channel was created and what it is about, you could also add for the Sidemen ones the names of all the Sidemen
CodyCo’s DJ video makes a lot more sense now.
You feel some YouTubers deserve it and VIK is one such!!! Congrats VIK
To have a setup like this is actually my dream, everything about it is so cool hopefully will be able to do something similar to this in the future
Totally deserved Vikk! I hope you will enjoy them!
Nice one, keep it up! 🔥🎵
nicee!
This is like... the ultimate mancave *_*. I think even if I had the budget, I still wouldn't have the ingenuity or knowledge to achieve such epic results. Congrats. I'm currently making major changes in my home office, and I'm trying to get some inspirantion on Youtube. Btw, I think I need a monitor like that for my new Protractor desk from Manhattan Home Design. Thnks for sharing this!
Vik is always classy with everything
He couldnt wait to make this video before his monitors arived?
UPLOAD SOME CUBECRAFT MONEY WARS PLSS
for the 1,000,000 placks you should get a trophy case... just a idea
jj crying
its safe to say that vik has the slickest fucken office in the uk
sick setup whats ur pc specs?
Curry power!!
congratulations Vikrant
DJ Vikkstar 123 sheee 🔥🔥👑
kon is a legend
The 7 "One Million Subscriber" button seems more like Messi's Seven Ballon D'or
Where u gonna workout now
Vik defo has the best setup in the sidemen
vikk is so boring
best setup of the sidemen
Looks good! Only criticism; that ceiling fitment looks a little poor. Could they not have built the drop down in a single piece with individual holes for the optics?    Also, that Sony camera is overkill 😂 some professional photographers would be envious of it.
Ayo Vikster what is this madness?
casual 7 gold play button flex
You can use maximum 123 height for streaming vr games like vr among us
Anyone know the round chair sofa thing name
it's the 123
Nah you didn’t make this con did, give credit man
"I built!" Kon: He can't keep getting away with it😫
yall compare Vikk's and JJ's but both office are different in so many ways. JJ wants easy / small cause he records only reaction and try not to laugh videos but Vikk wants cool / spacious cause he's a gaming youtuber and he knows he's gonna spend a lot of time in this. their office serve their purpose.
Bro gaved shout-out to Alan Walker.
You didn’t build it lol.
Hello
bro stole kons vid
2:05 The legendary line
Vik really made it😭 so proud
That is so cool 💜💙💗👍
You did it Vik! Youve built an amazing office and gaming setup that any guy would dream of! Youre an inspiration to all of us smaller gamers out here and Im so proud of how far youve come!
how does he have 7 one million plaque doe
i might do this exact same to my room GOOD JOB 👍🏿
Kinda sad how he didn’t really mention kon that built this for him 😢
This setup shits all over ksi's setup
Jheeeez speechless
this guy is the GOAT
I love how he use to be in a small room setup years ago, but know look at him now. We are all so proud of your rising Vik. Hope you see this :D
Get Lando to teach you DJ'ing
best setup ive ever seen i consider my setup good but your setup make mine look like absolout garbage oh and i would like to see you play more fortnite and gta
best sidemen setup
bros clear
2:26 i thought that was a chalenge to react faster with the green freeze frame ahahahahaha, thought it was gonna be special then realised it was just the star projector light :(
The EDM christmas drillings remix is the best so far out of the remixes! :D
Office is sick. But the H9 Headset is actually so ugly lol
Clear of jjs
we need to get this man to 10 million subscribers
love the setup but whoever plastered your walls needs firing plaster is supposed to be smooth and flat almost like glass seeing shadows just above the lights shouldn't be a thing
With the plaques, you should do like a whole wall mosaic thing with just a wall of plaques in rows lol
Good for you well done
We already saw this on Kons channel,  You should talk to him about click baiting the Sidemen.   You could have gotten alot more views if Kon respected your content.
and here around the corner this is my shop
8:35 the wall to your left, our right, the flat rectangular one, set all the plaques in a 3x3 grid with gaps in between. You could run backlighting, or just do some decorative bordering
smashh
we love you vik
FUND MY ONE "ukMRBEAST" <3
Crazy how I’ve seen this in kons video  and vikk gets sponsored by them straight away 🤣💯
To be fair tho
love how kon built the whole thing but the title said vik did it
Bro just stole kon’s work from him with just 1 clickbait💀💀
JJ and Vik live in the same house? Office is the exact same layout
This is so clean for the 123
this thumbnail legit looks like he's being held at gun point
I'm so proud that you went to Finland! Eventhough I feel the experience was maybe cringe, you still did so many amazing things.
DJ-STAR⭐⭐⭐
coldddddddddddddddddd
cold af
Harry's old apartment was good but this is better😂
*KON BUILT MY DREAM OFFICE & GAMING SETUP**
Vik, you are not lucky, you are rich and should not say "sorry" for that
kon built it not u son
I never knew vikk actually djs
I think he means "Kon built" lol
“im excited to try out standing” spoken like a true gamer
Hmm. Too dark imo…the  render looked way better. But as long as you like it
TB fair though
DJ Rajesh
The best one out of the lot I love the dj system I won't
This setup feels like a Sickick-Batman-ish cave and just with a pinch of Hans Zimmer Music,  This Setup is gonna make Legendary VIdeos
Boy had two monitors in 2001 🤣🤣 goddamn
Well deserved
There’s no way kon’s video got more views than mr 123
😶😶😶😶
What kind of table do you have? What name on the table?
Damn fine room but my man your pc spec sheet is a pure mess😂
I would love to show this video to 2014 vikkstar
Not my style but atleast a consistent theme.
all very well deserved my bro
I’m sorry but look at how hot Vik looks. The haircut and his beard madness
It’s cool, personally not a fan of these overly dark set ups but still sick obviously
Its the 123
No one deserves it more! Congrats vik.
So good to see how far you’ve come my guy. Big up to you. 🥂
5:02 has a stack of 1 mill play buttons just laying on the ground, vik is balling
hey troom troom! i learned so much more from these. i'm looking
Vikkstar123 djing a club is mad 😂
the discount code unfortunatly is only for the UK The headset look nice and I wanted to get it for cheaper, guess I'm paying full price
Should have been kon build my set up....and not better than jj's
So so annoying they just missed out on a Christmas number 1 that lad baby is a proper cringe guy
the amount of times he said absurd is absurd
Now this is a good Christmas present
Need a Vikkstar DJ channel now
ITS THE 123
How 7 gold play buttons?
It Already Looks Fire 🔥, Doesn't Need Any Deco IG
Dj set-up added cherry on cake...... Lit vikk
i like how vikk has the all the sidemen plaques
I like this better than jjs
Kon made it so stop taking credit
Love the cheeky 1 million sub play buttons flex
Vikk's setup > JJ's setup
Another Common Vik W
Should’ve waited for the other monitors
damn only 361 k views put some respect on my boy lets get him to 1 mil views
*kon* built my dream set up 😂😂
bro...he wins 1v6 in the sense of decorating 😲...this looks nuts🔥🔥
Vik’s 🅾️FF
I cannot stand for this vik, why would you do this to JJ. You will be cancelled days after this for flaunting on the homeless… “Keep the change you filthy animal”
Looked better before
why are u saying that u build it aha we all know konstantin build the ting
bruh the render came to life
*Kon* built my dream office & gaming setup
W Vik
Kon probly didn’t want a shoutout in the title anyway.
Looks awesome, good job man 💪
Kon has more views than vik lol
Yes vik
click bait!
U mean koni did it
Why are these setup videos so rushed?
Watching vik without his skinny arms is mad now
u built? kon.
Looks fucking sick man.
Think you need to grow up your an adult not 6
2hr gang
Each one of the sidemen getting a glow up to their offices and pcs.
W Vikk L Ksi
This year was Vikk’s year
Please Vik, I beg of you to pronounce the letter "H" correctly
FINALY😂😂
FINALY😂😂
Like the video quality of video is dope... Vik going through informations looks so classy man.. U should go n be a professional sales man head of a top firm bro
Nowadays vik=aesthetics...
"I BUILT MY DREAM OFFICE & GAMING SETUP" vikk u didnt have to do that to kon
Insane setup!
Tacky. Very on brand for you.
Nice
Glarses hooking up the sidemen
wow
Shout out glarses
he has topped jj like hoowwwwwwwwwwwww
Kon is crying 😅
I love Vik's videos ❤
love you vikk 🥰🥰🥰 very good work
You shure that "you" built it
did he say Alan Walker??
I saw a tiktok someone posted and that caption was something like  " Did Vikkstar Just Start DJing at the club" or something like that
A man of class.
kon built it not u
Awesomely fantastic 💯
Just Krazy man
Laptop from Glarses means finally another video from glarses?
Don't compare JJ and Vik's setup. Wait for TommyT Josh's setup. It's gonna be lit. 😂
konstantin built my...*
Vik play pool with Ali-a bajanCanadian and Jerome
This is better than JJ's lol
This office and set-up is in different league to all of the set-ups I've ever seen !! Congratulations bro 👑
8:57 bro just casually shouted out Alan Walker 😶
JJ's is shite
I'm homeless you greedy dog people r only happy when they have $$
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
The office looks absolutely amazing!  Whoever did the rendering took ALOT of inspo from Tech Tesseract old office. And they have videos on how to fix the problem you got. :)
What happened to the roccat sponsorship lmao
vikks so smart man I swear , He's the actual breadman of the sdmn and keeps it so lowkey.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
NO YOU DIDNT KON DID YOU DIDNT HELP AT ALL
Bro I was watching the vid and I was wondering why your room was so blue, turns out I had the page highlighted. Whoopsies
Vik please get them speakers turned around and raised up. They're monitors they're supposed to be faced to you not played out to the room.  Also a little tip if you want to improve your djing. Don't touch the sync and put tape over the bpm display. Learn to beat match by ear. When playing out use what you want but being able to pinpoint what's out of time and by how much is a key element
This set up is so nice! 🔥
Vik’s wordplay is getting stronger ngl
And now Vik just needs a displate sponsor lol
To many lasers scoping at u 😂
Shameful you didn't list PC specs! I was curious if you have a 4090 in there x D
Omg vik finally posted
I love Vik.
Keep the keyboard it matches your blue black wall theme. He could have did a royal blue/dark blue and black
The royal ravens logo would look sick in there and help break up the darkness of the blues, gray, and blacks
Kreek is here
This is the best office so far the 3D wall panels look so good!
⭐
The best Set-Up out of all of them! How chill is that!!
Nunya Group! Lets go! Thanks for the shoutout Vic!
MaD vik
ive been subbed for the majority of your youtube career and all i can say is, you deserve the life you have, youre humble and even though im 27 if i ever get to meet you ill probably piss a little
10:26 bro thinks he’s Kanye
What are those projectors? I really want some
Petition for Vik to create 3 more channels just to have 10 1 million plaques
He finally got out of his green screen office
dayum sick
Vikks office should be called the starship
Kon done the gaming set up
How the Setup was built Link https://youtu.be/oN9GpYnkTV0
That spec sheet is a bit confusing whats going on there
Without kon i dont think anyone wouldve been able to make insane setups <3
Man’s energy bill could power a city
Come on
love how this setup looks, so clean and minimalistic, but whoever wrote the specs for the PC should be looked into xd
Now we just need streams!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Better than ksi
this setup looks very similar to another setup, aside from some placement
Does anyone know who Vik’s editor is? Because the editing on this video is incredible
Vik has just handed JJ an L Damm
Still don’t think people realise how breaded this man actually is
After the monitors vikk went full on salesman
bestest setup in the WHOLE SIDEMEN hands down
Best Sidemen Setup. No doubts.
Its 123
anyone know what speakers he had on his desk?
ouh
wooooooooooow when i grow up im gonna  get a setup like you!!!
Set up is crazy
so cringe no one needs or deserves something like this
There’s our answer to who’s richest in the sidemen
I'm baffled
all that lovely natural light and he paints the walls black :(
Kon crying in the corner😂!
setup is sick I've been wondering why viks headset is massive lmao the sponsor explains it haha
2 cdj 3000 ! Jealous iam vik
So sick man! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this for you! You deserve all these great things! 😊
still waiting for a video with your fiancee ? how long  at least make a Q&A
Vikk just won the setup game....he's so clear now
Look at the stars, they’re all yellow!
Random idea but no one has done this I don’t think make a coffee table with your play buttons that would be so cold
Lol just had to add the fact that he had the star ceiling before jj. Weird flex.
you need to start streaming valorant and show your gameplay people will love it
Love to been watching you since the pack days keep up the great work
...and congratulations to you. Congrats to you for not giving up. Congrats to you for putting years of hard work in. A hard working man like you deserves the best. You earned it. Enjoy!
What speakers do you use for the mixer?
Vik is effortlessly the best Sidemen
I'm sorry but this is Rishi Sunak
vik i dont think you can be a dj with whose awkward hand gestures
Really violating Kong like that, building the best set up out of the sidemen🤣
vik can win a office room but jj's house its like a 7 star hotel
Sponsored, there’s a shock lol
How did you learn the DJing?
2:16  Framerate from a monitor?
The giga chad entered the setups race. Meanwhile kon crying in the corner
I can feel a Konstantin video coming up
Waaaaay better than jj's
this is more fire than jj's, keep up the good work vikk!
Now I know why Vik has been wearing this ugly ass headset lately
Has vik got a lisp? lol
Jjs looks so cheap when the brown guy pulled up
This beats KSI's setup
Shed a tear for Kon
It’s the 123
Damn vik rich rich
Im still running that 11 year old setup nowadays lol
I love the office! Also it’s like Vik has turned into some sort of villain after the JJ incident, with his whole theme of house being black 😂
Weird to compare Vik and JJ when JJ is in a flat in London.   Vik has bought a huge long term home so ofc has more space!
that before and after was mad.  looks incredible!
Its123 🔥
Why dont u talk about ur chair , it worth like my car
actually such a sick set-up
vikk is really bringing the 123 brand to life these days
mate mentioned his puppy before his fiance 😂. Vik we love you 😂
god daym
its looks so good without lights wow
happy to see all the boys doing so damn well wow
Bro still has Dreams.
Amazing Setup! it looks like gaming area has definitely taken inspiration from the @TechTesseract gaming setup
vik, B2B set maybe? 👀
Broo this guy just wanna beat jj but if jj want he can buy him completely like tf broo jj house living room is like an hotel reiception
why us viks hair like messi , hes got messi cut lmao
2:55 formatting took a major L
How many times have you built your dream setup?
Dude got a new office now should we expect videos regularly
It's the 123
We need a vik dj video
The Punjabi one upped the folabi
the 123 one upped  the olatunji
Smashed it Vikk, fair play
heech DR 600 Sony heech 9 headsets hex eye hex
JJ punching the air right now
meanwhile kon is crying bc he lost a video 😂😂
Common "W" for our one of the most loved internet personality "WIKKSTAR"
2:56  Whoever did that list clearly had no idea what any of it was😅, it should say -Intel Core I9-13900k (24-core, Max 5.80GHz) -ASUS ROG Maximus Z790 Hero (DDR5, LGA1700, USB3.2, PCIe 5.0, ARGB Ready) -64GB (2x32GB) DDR5 5200MHz CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB -24Gb NVIDIA GeForce RTX4090 👍
Can we all appreciate the transition at 10:24 ❤❤
Sick
The G
😍😍
One of the best YouTube gaming rooms
W Vid
One of the best offices out there so good
He worked so hard to get here and still maintains being so freaking humble! Whatta amazing man ❤❤
Remember that video where a girl said Vik looks poor? Bruh who's poor now?
Dj 123
It's hard to believe that I have been watching you for 10 years now that OG set up really brought back a lot of nostalgia. I'm so glad you're doing well vikk
7 plaqs flex
after seeing this i think kon and that other guy literally robbed ksi 😂 they took like more than a year and used 3x 144hz monitors 😂
This makes ksi's setup look shiat 😅
"Ive been playing for a few months and now playing in clubs" legit some DJ play from like 13 to like 20+ and never get a chance in a club lol gg
Vikk has the best office.
🥶🥶🥶
By the way the NXS suffixed behind the DJM-900 is pronounced as NEXUS. Pioneer DJ tend to suffix the tag behind their flagship products when they iterate and upgrade it around 3-6 years down the line. Sometimes, the improvements are small, others they are huge.
Miss the days of 3-5 videos a day but he deserves to chill now
Ego
Nah this has to be better than ksi’s setup
This smoked everyone else’s set up
So we know who's richer now.
vik come hmu when you want some wins bud 🤣  put them up on the wall behind you in sequence
Vik has the best
ohhh man jj's gonna be so jealous😆 He'll be like "Naah.. It's fine guys, It's calm, I'm ok" But he won't🤣💔
Bro. Got dj setup 😍🔥
Bro vikk is glowing up after the drillings!!
Looks like jjs
This is a sick setup vik !!
Can’t wait for talia’s reaction.
miniminter should react to your dream office & and gaming setup.
vik with this longer hair is fine asf
Never expected a DJ Vik
To be fair though
I still can't believe this is the guy I watched play pixelmon and hunger games. Crazy really. Big inspiration for myself and many others!
If I was a gamer I'd want this setup, otherwise I'd have JJs
Hands down the best setup out of all sidemen
BEST PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE EVER!!!!
Petition for vikkstar to make another channel or post on this channel his remixs/mixtapes
this is way better than JJ's setup
No one gonna mention how sick it is Vikk is becoming a better DJ
Nice Vikk will we see you post now
this video kinda proves that Vikk has more bread than ksi.
Gr8 bro ! { now stop eating beef
ben got no credit
bruh that's so much better than ksi
I thought nobody can top JJ's setup but damn Vikk
And we thought jj had money lmao
His setup is better than JJ's
goated room goated youtuber
W setup. 123/100
Hopefully we get a kon video for this too haha
VERY COMMON VIK W 🏆
Who is copyrighting Christmas drillings it's his song
closing the skylight is sinful
It’s better than ksi office dammm

v10 mixer would’ve been so much better especially for club setup
This man deserves all of this and more! 🙌🏽
Finally
to be fair thou
this is so sick, lol i love how he put a spot for his fiancé and dog to come hang out too
Ayo turntables!!!  DJ 123 in the houseeee!!!
Anyone notice the decks said drugs vs anytime
Folks Let's go for the "10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS " ♥️♥️10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ♥️♥️ Make it happen..
Anyone know what Desk he's using?
Keep doin' such videos....
The GOAT Vikkstar123
It's the DJ 123
This is the sort of setup I can only dream of having. You deserve it Vikk. Super nice guy and you've put in the work. Respect.
maaan....I want a 1990 version of a spaceship as a office space too :(
This is a MANCAVE 😂🤯🤯
ITS THE 123
bro the discount code does not work
its about time vikk invested in a proper setup, he's old setups were usually pretty bland and the face cam was atrocious. big moves vikk
Jeeeezzzz ok vikk you ask now okayyyyy
looks amazing ;
Big W
JJ wasted so much money on his just so the 123 could come and drop this beauty
We want a sidemen video in here
Best gaming room not setup tho
That mix was lit, better be on spotify
the mental thing abt this is chances are this set up vid prob made him money. The sony ad the ad rev during december as well as the ability to write this off
You can put the million subscriber plate in subtle glass led boxes, built in at the custom panel wall in the chill area.
The 123 on the grind, bless you g
So proud of you man❤️❤️
Been waiting on this one 🤞
❤❤🎉
Vikks trim looking fresh
So proud of you Vik! Can’t wait to see him as the new KSHMR on the EDM charts ❤
Aight... we know what's Glarses's new vids gonna be
You deserve this man
Looks sick
What’s the DJ kit I wanna buy it?
goat
Vik I love you man big ups
get some plants in there
Make Ralph a YouTube and try get a gold plat for him
Ngl it's better than jj's and he also got the star ceiling. Unfortunate Mr, ski
Best setup out of the sidemen guys no doubt😮‍💨👑. Looks sick
WE all love the 123
Nerd
Sponsor my studies , im gonna pay u 10x
It's the 123
pls do some ark or h7m
🔥 Best sidemen setup by far!
Another banger from the 123
Well that new remix makes sense now
Its the 123
Hopefully we finally get some consistent content now 😅
Wikk
Kons fuming 😭
How has his PC already got 13th gen Intel?
go for 10 of those million plaques
KSI's room looks like poo now
The dj set is sick
It's 123 😂
Its the 123
Big up yourself big man Vikk, I enjoy your content a lot
Seems like vikk got a house gym and stopped lifting
Looking forward to Vik actually doing some gaming on the regular again, miss those lockdown warzone streams
this guys bills are gonna be hella expensive
mans gone clear
I honestly can’t believe his LEDs aren’t his iconic yellow
HE SAID THE THING!
jeeeez!! Vikk is looking fresh these days
Funniest thing is how good the room is and the main thing I wanna know is where did u get the blackout blinds from for the windows 🤣🤣
Lets get this og king to 10 million. We all love our boy Vikkstar123, since his beginnings.
does this mean kon releasing set up video
bro just did KSI room but so much better ngl.
Are we gonna see a Glarses video making the keyboard with you, that would be so funny!
Damn got that 4090 graphics card
People get this man to 10 million
This setup is the best 😍
If you needed a rug, should've went to JME
Vik didn’t rate Kon’s work and decided to do it himself
This might be the best setup i ever seen...
Vik thought forget kon I'll do it myself and show him how he is better at it then him ahah
It’s the 123 😎
Vikkstar proved why he is the GOAT. Best setup of any UK youtuber
Bro is in a spaceship
still wont be able to sort his audio for AmongUs
Anyone else completely thrown by the ludicrous PC components layout?? Lol
10:12 Definently edited in
Looks like whoever did this setup should have done KSI's lol
Jj is gonna need to re upgrade
Cold
Why are your DJ monitors down low and facing the opposite way to you?
ITS THE 123
Vik's tours and setup videos are elite
1:37
really, really cool
TOBALD INCOMING
1:03 Love to see the 3000's in the setup. Really cool piece of gear...
waiting for kons vid on this setup
Well-deserved, this man is the one and only GOAT
he's LIVING ⭐️
Vikk is too bougie, I deeped it
Big up Vikk
love ya vik! been watching you since i was like 10 or 11. glad you’re doing swimmingly. v proud of my favorite sidemen member. doing some great work man. ralph is one かわいい pupper!
‘Money cant buy you happiness’ gotta be the dumbest quote fr
Konstantin has competition
DJ123
Hope to see you do more dj sets! would be sick!
Looks 🔥🔥🔥
Vikk looks like mahrez
Vikkkkkkshtar
Its the 123
We need to get vik to 10 mil
Big up for you bro❤️❤️
Your setup is so sick mate your not gonna want to leave that office. Your a real inspiration to smaller gamers like myself.
Is lighting in the room good ? Staying in the dark too much will worsen ur eyesight
That spec screen is so cursed, PC builders will know.
4090😍😍😍😍😍
Ayo vik loving the trim
Now play Warzone, been missing the vids Mr. 123
Only one question, can this handle ARK ?
It's the 123
Syndicate will kick ralphs face in
Yes another video
4:04 vikk gonna be playing MW2.0 like a lil kid lmao
This is what I’ve been waiting for
JJ's vs Vik's Setup, which is better?
Its so nice when youtubers are so humble even though it was there hard work
Yeah I think it's fair to say the Sidemen are starting to have the sickest setups
as if you didnt get kon to do it on his channel
Man just dropped alan walkers name like it was nothing. Big big glow up to vikk and I'm loving it cause he deserves everything good coming his way.
This brought a smile to my face. what an amazing setup from the vikkster himself. ur a huge inspiration much love from the US <3
Vik living his best life... Love to see it!
We need to get vik to 10 mil.
The quality of the video is insane 🤩
Gonna be smashing out the DOTA on this one 😂
ONE OF TH3E BEST SETUPS IVE EVER SEEN CMONNN THE 123333
so drip
Ksi probably spent 100k on his setup while vik probably spent 25% of that and it’s 10x better wow
Vikk just one-upped ksi’s office. I love him
Tbh better then ksi
i want to know why vik have all of the sidemen youtube buttons ?
I am so happy to see you doing well, I have been subbed for over 10 years, and you are one of the few that have never sold out, been in major controversy or just given up. I’m glad to see that 2023 is coming up all Vikk !
BETTER THAN KSI HANDS DOWN
One of the best offices I have seen this is sick
It’s mad because I don’t even know vikk but I’m so proud of the guy he’s grown into and how he’s constantly smashing it 🎉
Really well done.. looks very clean & beautiful.
Happy For You Brother
Kon punching the air rn
Better than jj's
Why a sony a7r? The r lineup is for photography, you will be using that camera for video (facecam, stream) so im confused.
you can buy this headphones cheaper in Currys and on Amazon 😢
Im jealous of the dj gear
Rishi lookin younger by the day
We need that next diamond plaque
This man deserves everything in life, one of the most geniune and hard working ppl
Og.
this man doesnt deserve this much success                          u expected a “he deserves more”? hah                        …he does
Is there anyone in INDIA who does this kind of stuff ?
Vikkstar’s House is way too SICK🔥🔥🔥
The best sidemen office and the rest aren’t even close 😮
I want those CDJs so badly
better than jj's no doubt
vikk having the best set up and being the only one that kon didnt do lol kons never getting hired again the big fat bum
The richest sdmn
Vikk stays winning!
Damn this is way better than JJ's
I dont wanna be mean or anything but vik is kinda washed like look at the amount of views that aint my good old vik
brilliant lad
I can smell a Glarses video
Odds on Vikk doing a dj live stream
Wikkkk beating JJ’s Eaz
better then all the sidemen setups.  W vik as always😁
Woooaahh That's better than JJ's setup. congo brother 🔥🔥
i think you should blackout your windows like those white parts because theyre kind of taking all the black theme out, just a suggestion, soo happy for you vik great setup btw i think its better than jjs
Christmas drillings vikkstar club remix dropping soon?
lil vik about to be sippin lean in here
Im a very old VIKKSTAR viewer and i am dj as well I always knew he would become a dj eventually! Super proud of you Vikk❤️
Love vik playing the puppy card 😂😏
Can't wait for kon's setup video for this
Bro has way too much money
Sorry, but HDR600 is not HDR.
jeeeze
It looks amazing ❤
No piano in the office?
Bros setup costs more than my car
W setup
Vikk, JJ and Simon all have insanely cool offices, I guess that's what happens when you're friends with Kon lmao
In for a little b2b set Vikkstar 😜
When he says "I'm vikkstar"  it sounds so majestic 😭😭
Million subscribers plaques on the ceiling! 👌
What are those LEDS called
This man has the office every guy dreams of! Best one out of all the sidemen yet! Absolutely love it.
luv u vikk but cringe thumbnail...
Anyone know any similar pink and purple lights like that for cheap?
If he didn’t have to film sidemen vids, vikk would never step out his yard
The custom paneling was well worth the wait.
;⁠)
Shows how much money he has when his set up is better then Jj's
he already mentioned that he had them waay before jj in case nobody say that he copied jj
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yo that's a maaad setup vik I wish I could have a setup like that
Yooooooooo
Whats behind the door?
AND THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT IS 123? WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?!!!
vik studio > jj studio
vik won !!!!
this man deserves this office
Vik is honestly too underrated in the sidemen, big up Vik 🐐
It looks so cool I'm just left speechless honestly
That office looks so good and I am still surprised there is more to go like 1 2 3....😄
To be fair though.
Better than JJ's
Vik Office > KSI Office
Vik is goat, now he  has a goat office. Best in sidemen
sponsored and just straight to the setup, needed to show progress
damn
It's the 123
I'm surprised vikk never pushed for 10m on his own channel.
To be fair though..         Vikk's setup is wayyy better than jj's
It's the 1 2 3, man will cut down your christman tree!
The best one by far and not even close.
What's the music used at the end?
COOOOLD also FIIIIREEEE Set Up I love this and a big W video 🤩🥶🥶🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👌. I wish they had a star button so I could smash that star button for this video and set up is just Crazy and Mad Welldone Vikk congrats and your doing so much its fantastic to see and be a part as a fan to watch and experience it I love it😁⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️123.
Bro Vik himself is looking so f'ing sick!!!
it is the 123 with a new video suiiiiiiiiiiiiii new top g
Mr.123. I'll cut down your Christmas tree
man's office is a spaceship
congrats vikk setup looks fire 🔥🔥 waiting for new videos created in there
I love your DJ setup. I can't wait to see how good you will be in the next couple of years
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST SETUP IVE SEEN NOT TO OVERBOARD VERY SUBTLE AND POWERFULL AT THE SAME TIME ❤️
Viks setup makes jj’s setup look like a regular room
Am i the only one waiting when josh is gonna change his gaming setup
Vikk really has the best office out of all of the sidemen
Congrats vikk amazing setup brother lots of love ♥
was literally just watching viks gym tour lmao
Vikkstars gym is sick.I kind of expected vikk too have a sick setup already lol
Clear
I pray i get to this level in life. Happy for you
W vik
Sick  vic man
Vik’s DJ arc
I think we can all agree that this is the best setup that exists! The vibe though😍
i want to see a DJ Vikkstar X DJ Lando mixing session
sickkk setup !!!!!!!!!
damn so kon ain't got a vid could've been an easy 1m views
yeah this is by far the best setup in the sidemen
Seeing all of this is so wholesome and inspiring👏
The goat Vikkstar, 🐐 looks incredible
Absolutely love this. GG my guy!  The only thing i change is probably showing some love to the PC by not having it on the floor. Shoutout @TechSource
Coldd
The green lights are a bit much
The electricity bill 📈📈
Petition to make "IT'S 123" as a new intro.
Feeling like a proud brown brother rn...Congrats,Vik so happy to see you achieve your dreams like this,you deserve this mate
That dj setup and whole office setup is fire 🔥
only one monitor  💀
Konstantin crying in corner!!
best setup in the sidemen
Omg cool setup 💓
jheeeez
Hard 🔥🔥
You got all the space in the world and chose the smallest space for your office. Tbh you got too much going on in small space. However, all the equipments and designs are fkin cool.
i guess we all can agree that vikk’s office is shitting on ksi’s setup😭😂
Better than ksis setup ngl
now we wait for kon's vid
This is waaayyy better than JJs
Which one do you think is better guys?  JJ's setup Or Vikk's setup?
Viks grind should not be forgotten. Used to have 8 videos a day for years, huge respect for the bloke. He didn't have a bedframe for 2/3 years haha
It's better than JJs
What's your sound system?
Totally not over kill 🤣✌🏼 … DJ channel? 👀😁
❤ you VIK
To be fair tho
insane setup vik
Vik's big time man
Man just annihilated KSI's setup
i can't believe vikk just one-uped jj's office damnnnnn
Everyone Loves A Daily Dose Of Vikkstar Right?❤

Fantastic setup and office and well deserved, you are a youtube legend. I'd definitely say you have the best out of all of the sidemen. Love the custom work and panels, the room is great.

Been djing for a few years now and then decks Jesus talk about buying the best
Common Vik W
Vik doesn't post much but when he does, it's usually sick
this is so sick bruvvv
bro is looking so leng lately
The king has returned
I'm very pleased that Vikks office is complete and something is off the list, but progress takes time and the time will come for everything to be complete
This is way better setup than KSI's
Damn bruh this man upload just to flex his setup💀💀
wow I love your office is excellent
Wassup yall
Best office out of the Sidemen by a country mile.
If you’re seeing this on upload day, theres still a few hours left, get this man a Christmas Number 1 to help decorate his office
Kon's fuming.
The most humble flex I’ve ever seen😂👌🏿👌🏿
Here within 9 mins kinda on smoke with this channel rn 😂
Awesome job vik thumb up 10/10.
Claim your here with in 3 minutes here
Mad setup insane from where it all started
Trim looking nooiice👍🏻 should keep it like that…
Personally, I'm not a big fan of the whole star thing but I get why Vik got it and to be fair though
Hello 👋
The most gamer setup in sidemen
This is arguably the best sidemen set up ever
Breadstar123 > JJ’s setup
Jheez vik flexing on us with those 7 million sub plaques

Is your PC on the Carpet floor ? Massive L

This is probably one of the best setup
JJ: I think I have theee best YouTube room/office  Vik: Hold my rupees
ITS THE ONE TWO THREE 🔥🔥🔥
I've been a Vikk fan since 2012. It's sad to see how much of a sellout he's become. Very disappointed
W

The office looks nice vik can't wait to see the rest of the house once it's done
Office setups = quality videos. Vikkstar123 = the best channel on YouTube.  Both = heaven
You should have had kon do this for you to keep up the tradition
Hi
So this is why the KSI setup video was so long, Kon had to do double duty
Vikk, this looks awesome! I can't wait to see this full finished house
The ravens won’t be there long considering KOI bought out Rogue, and apparently want to move the franchise to Spain instead
Wikkstar
This goes so hard. I dream of having a room for gaming half as cool.
I can allready see the razing JJ's gonna have after this 😭🤣🤣🤣
