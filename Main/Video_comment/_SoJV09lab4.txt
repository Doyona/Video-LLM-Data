Clarence and mod are such a funny combo I'm weak asl

Hey Family! You should check out ruggable. They have washing machine friendly rugs. I have several through out my home especially in high traffic areas. I do have one under my dining room table and kitchen table. They have pretty cool designs too.
I like your show

Makeup and skin care tutorial from queen 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 The past few videos I’ve seen your skin is glowing glowing ❤❤
Clarence is me my sister be doing that shit I’m getting anxiety I be telling her  fuck that I am not ordering nothing
I love the bond between CJ and Clarence, having two fathers is better then having none for a young boy so he is very blessed 🤍
Queen gotta get the brown back it just hits different
He is a real ass dude and I appreciate that for you and your family. A real man would do what he can to protect his family. And people question if love is real or not and this goes to show that Love ain't easy but it definitely does exist.  He is a great role model for black men out there that actually give af about falling in love and supporting his family. I wish nothing but the best for y'all thank you so much for being so vulnerable and open with us as well as being apart of your journey together.
MO DOODIE
Men never want an umbrella I don’t get it
CJ be way too hyper lol does he have adhd or is he just naturally hyperactive? 🤔
Get a generator. Y'all got money

Mod won  😂😂😂queen is funny
😂Queen ❤ “No it’s not” 🤣
I love Selena ❤
Beautiful queen

This  video  Awesome❤❤❤❤
Cj meant he can learn and do work that can help him in school. Work on school projects yes he deserves
lol it’s queen saying CJ being too excited but he is literally her 😂😂 they are the samee
Loving the consistency
Clarence is me😂 Queen done worked that man up ordering that food him getting out the car trying to get back to his calm place such a Sagittarius 😂
Yall can take some of the oil out by ski.ming the top ..all the other ingredients will sink to the bottom so it makes it easier to skim the oil off the top ..
18:53 hell naw he dont need a girlfriend he need a ass whoopin fa be so triflin... call his mama so she can bop him upside his head fa being so nasty... girlfriends are not molly maids👎
11:15 absolutely hes doing good in math and in school as a whole so he deserves it👏🖥🖱⌨

I love Clarence hat!! Queen your beautiful ❤
You need to add more CREAMS & NATURAL NUDE COLORS! Get cream colored Pillows and a cozy cream blanket to have on the couch!!
Don’t pour oil down your sink! Pour it into an empty bottle and toss it instead. I miss y’all’s friendship! I was wondering what happened to modd
kids have a light in them that hasnt gotten burned out by society. thats why they move sm when they talk, why they ask so many questions, why they have sm energy and can be themselves.
or a dark grey to match the cabinets for the carpet.?
I love queen’s sense of humor 😭🙌🏾
clere bear lmao and mod are stupidly fuuny
cj is so big now omg🥹🥹 he def gave 3 good reasons for getting a PC
Where does CJ ask Clarence about marriage to his mom?
Nice bright colorful picture on the wall by the bench table in the dining room.
For cj’s age yes it was a good answer
I haven't watched in over 3 or so years. It's crazy how legend went from being a baby to a toddler that can speak and CJ is elementary age. may the children grow up to know the LORD JESUS CHRIST.
Eat from another person plate without  them noticing is crazy😭 made me think of the hungry hungry hippo game😭😭 then mod saying Clarence can do bite ups they killing me😭😭
Damn I wanted to steal a piece of that chicken off the grill😂
Yessssss
THEY STILL AINT MARRIED.... WOW THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES IF A MAN DONT MARRY YOU 6 MONTHS TO A YEAR IN HE NEVER WILL.
I’ve been in fast food for over 13 years  You right about that queen sometimes we can make somethin shake and accommodate orders
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Gota cute those grapes in half mama. So many kids be choking on grapes, look it up.... not hating in any way, just trying to help. Love yall
I can't believe how big legend is, he was a baby the other day, now he's talking 😂
Getting a generator is definitely a good idea.   Enter safe than sorry
Cj deserves to get it maybe wait for Christmas though make him think he not getting it lol 😂
Your children must not be messy eaters
😝
Queen is a goddess 💯❤️
23:30
Definitely 3 good reasons !!!!
Cj has so much personality lmaoooo he too smart tho
i think u should go with a dark grey or even a light grey to match ur kitchen!

I miss Crate & Barrel. West Elm is cool too!
Yooooooo! I just love this family. I been watching them for years. Queen since the red couch and Mr. NYC since the basement. Hey! Yellow is the NEW color = HAPPY! Love from the Bay 💛
I think you should add some royal green or red pillows on the sofa lol
Pc for cj ❤❤

Tips for young boys it’s important to cut their hair and keep them cut until they reach 12, short hair will improve their masculinity, then during teenage years they will decide what type of hair they want
I’m a say yes for Cj
I love y’all. ! The boys are getting so big wow & cj is so smart ❤ love the bond him & Clare has ❤ Love how the gang is back together! MOD just complete everything ❤🔥💥
You should really add some color to your beautiful home.
❤
Absolutely invest in a generator you won’t regret it and when the time comes that you need it you will have it instead of having to find one while everyone else is also trying to find one here in Cali we’ve had tons of outages the last couple years especially during summer and we bought a generator seriously worth it even if it’s just to run the refrigerator so all the food doesn’t go bad
Y'all look good in Yellow 😍
QUEEN!  get a dark grey rug to match the kitchen cabinets! Your welcome 😊
Omg legend should definitely narrate books or be a voice actor he was so animated when reading off the Mario characters
Queen should have kept her booty chin cause Cj has one just like her, aww. 20:57 Yesss! This is one of my favorite songs.
I love the way Legend talks 😍 he sounds so intelligent
Get him the PC
Dark color rug b/c of food stains
Get it for him he is a good kid🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂 when u lot we’re roasting each other
Lmao I felt Clarence with the anxiety on ordering...  my husband does the samething as Queen!! He will literally create a whole new menu when placing an order.
I love y'all bond y'all proved all the haters wrong🙌🏾💪🏾😜
Omg Legend reminds me of one of my babies always thanking Daddy when Mommy did it😂🤷🏽‍♀️😁
Oh no did baby CJ just tell Momma Queen 👑 to stop laughing that's a BIG NO NO TO TELL YOUR PARENTS THAT
What do men have against umbrellas 😂 They rather be soaked
Cj is so smart omg ! 😁❤️🙌🏽🙏🏽
CJ just like his mom making those funny faces
29:40 MOD said "naw now look at you"  Clarence couldn't do nothing but laugh tears rolling from my eyes

25:06   Legend should get into cartoon voicing , he definitely has that cartoon voice or YouTube unboxing voice 🔥🔥🔥
okay Clarence when you getting marry you heard cj

I haven’t finished the video yet but I think you should get a dark rug. It’s practical for the space and will fit great with the dark surrounding colors
You do know just because their yellow their still rose's
Buy CJ HIS PC!!!!!
Yo Cj is really on it. I was typing it as Queen said it lol. My first hurricane I wasn’t prepared being from Ny too. It made me get prepared before the storm hits. Rack up on non perishable foods. Get loads of cases of water. A generator is definitely a must when you own a house. The power went out on us one year and we lost power for 4 days. It was awful we appreciated that central air after that.
Yeeeepppp! Great reasons!!!! He needs a PC!
That roast session had me in tears 😂😅🤣🤣🤣
He done got so bigggggggg omggggggg 😩😩😩
Yellow rug for a pop of color
Legend is so handsome!!!!! 😍🥰
yesssssssssss get him the pc
Olive green ??? For the rug
I love the relationship Clarence has with both boys, but the genuine love he has for CJ is beautiful to watch…it shows how much he loves him that the kiddo wants him to marry his mom…y’all are so dope! ❤
I saw a post of a man interviewing a couple who were together for 5 years . He asked the man, when was he planning to marry his girlfriend, and he responded pretty soon . The interviewer asked the man if they lived together , the couple said yes , does she cook for him and wash his clothes , and clean up around the house , the couple said yes . The interviewer said “ then why do you think he’s going to rush and marry you , if you are already doing everything a wife does . 😳🥴 That hit deep . He has no reason to marry her because he’s already getting all the benefits of having a wife.
adding chairs to the end of the table would be great
Next time try white vinegar some lemon with salt and pepper 🤌🏼
Yes
Omg legend got so big 😍😍😍🫶🏽
Queen Girll YOUU Look Sooo Beautiful 🙏🏽✨🎉🎉❤️❤️💕💕🫶🏽
Omg Cj ❤️😍😍Your So Big Now
Can’t nb tell me nothing, but legend will definitely live up to his name. He is a freakin genius, the way clare was hitting him with the random mental math problems and he answered each question correctly when they was driving in the car. He’s very smart. And CJ just grew up on us, so smart and intelligent himself. I love each and every one of them. ❤
C & Mod Reminds me of my friends & I high throwing jokes 😂😂😂
Hey Mod Da God
Medicine song stuck in my head
Queen glowing no homo
Only get him a PC if he screen n upload it so we can see what they do ever now & then
Cj talk so intelligent ❤ still wondering how I’m just seeing this vlog
I can relate to Clarence getting out of the car with my family 😂.  We love you all but sheesh 😅
Those were perfect reasons !
I hope Cj got that pc he deserve it
Get the pc for cj he deserves it !
Cj’s explanation of why the hurricane won’t be super impact to y’all was great

It’s always good to ask questions and potentially get something you would want instead of settling, sometimes you can get what your asking for it’s always worth a shot. I don’t think it’s that serious or something you have to work on to change Queen !!
Queen looks so house wife

I won’t lie I feel Clarence during the drive thru. My sister be the worst ordering so indecisive I get so much anxiety. Like damn make up your mind !!  Haha still love you Queen ! Been a supporter when you first started YouTube
When Legend said "Rainbow!" and I noticed he arranged the colours in the exact order of the rainbow 🤯. That's a genius baby!
Y’all roasting each other is hilarious 😂😂😂😂

Mod cooking might be his path❤
Queen that yellow looks so pretty on you 💕
Ugh 28:58 😍😍😍 these two

cj dont need no pc its just another device he barely will use lol, he smart but like a xbox a Nintendo and a ps5 lowkey got a lot more options
y'all should do royal blue accents since its white and black and grey
Cj should have got to phone a friend lol I would’ve said he good in school he’s a good big brother and helps clean up sometimes.
Hey CJ I love that question you ask your mom’s boyfriend or your brother father.
He has 3 good reasons 😂🥰 just get it for him😂
Soo happy Modd its back ❤❤
Legend grow up wow he so big and cute❤

CJ deserves his PC
The roasting session at the end has me in tears. Lol Modd said chin ups hand me in tears. Clearance said your neck looks like it grows back. Bruh I screamed.   And no I like the grey patch.
Queen look good af . That’s definitely her hair color 🔥😍🥰
The boys are so cute! Cj is adorable cute lil personality and legend omg his face is gorgeous ❤
lol clearance and Modd took a smoke break before making the salad dressing for sure.
Black rug!!!! It’ll complement it well!
Poor cj…acting up bc he truly don’t get what he needs from his parents & attention is #1 So sad to see.. & Queen is distant + constantly annoyed with cj but peep there’s a difference with her energy towards legend tho🫣🤦🏾‍♀️  Honestly seems like Queen & Clarence are concerned with cj’s odd behavior not knowing what to do or understand that boy is internally hurt from everything hes seen & hear/heard on top of his dad & moms toxic break up   Just bc a kid is small & young doesn’t mean they don’t see, hear & absorb! Pay attention  to your kids feelings, emotions & behavior thru your bs situations
I can’t believe how big CJ is now omgggg I’ve been watching you since you was a baby
Lmaoo this whole video was comedy. From the kids to Clearenxe anxiety over ordering the food and Queen’s laugh is everything. Modd’s apartment is sweet. I love the patio garden. But baby why the towel made of cement tho? Lol
Winggssss tf when Popeyes get them 😂
16:44 Lmaooooo right who’s back there making u spicy nuggets 😂😂😂😂
yall are so funny i love yall
Beautiful family x
When Clarence brought Queen that stiff ass rag when they was at mods 😂😂
😂😂😂 I love this vlog so much Queen and Clarence at Popeyes got me so weak
Lol these 3 are hilarious 😅
Yes CJ NEEDS the PC !!
Cj is so damn goofy 😭❤️
Ik Queen gon be happy when she finally have a baby girl
You need a pop of color for the rug.
Happy to see my family
The food ordering stressed me out just hearing y’all talking about it😂😂😂 too much chaos.
Whhyyyy is CJ so big 🥺
Green rug would bring outside scenery in doors n add enough color
Yall look like an east african family lol so cute🥹
Poor Clarence y’all stressed him out in that car 😂
Buy that generator Queen 😂😂
"You look like you do bite ups"😂😂bro they funny asl
Buy him a PC
Y’all should get a puppy

Black rug with cream design
It’s so good to see the crew back together. Mod and Clarence… I can tell they’re both genuinely happy to have their friendship back on track.
Those are 3 excellent reason!
Get my boy a PC. Can’t believe how grown and handsome CJ got 🥹 I can’t take it.
Talk about I love my family but they drive me crazy 😂😂😂. I love it ❤such a beautiful family love to see it
October 20th is my birthday 💕 (forgot to add that )

#GIVECJTHEPC 😂
Lmaoooo I’m jus like Queen when it comes to me ordering food 😂😂😂
Get him the pc he deserves it. You guys have great children
Get him the pc
Get CJ a pc, he’s been good in school so he can use his pc to learn more. He also said he can play with his friends maybe some of them don’t have consoles & the third reason is, he just really likes it (this shows honesty) Lol fighting for little man. Didn’t see much people in the comments mentioning it. Like this to get CJ a pc.
Awwwww CJ looks even more like queen now aww 🥺
Everyone needs to own a generator fr
get him a PC!!!!
I think a white rug
Good question CJ 😆
This was so nice to see feel like the old days and cj had good reasons for a PC ❤❤love yall
Yes, his smile is the biggest reason
Legend looks like queen
CJ deserves the PC !!! Get him that PC !!
Wow! Where have I been! Still as beautiful as ever look at how big little man is!!! ❤
CJ is hilarious but we gonna need  3 more reasons😂
I can’t get over how big the boys have gotten, I tell you the times fly by so fast.
😂😂😂😂 man I missed ya three together.. I laughed so much with ya lmao 😂😂also the way Clarence smiled and looked at CJ during homework was so heart warming ❤❤❤❤
These three is always a vibe I swear.
Y’all look so cute 😩🥹
Cj should get a pc
No man should ever agree to be a step father. Find you a young beautiful wife and make your own biological children. No man honestly wants to abandon his biological children. There is something that woman is not telling you.
wow cj so big moe
The roast session literally took me out 😂
Ain’t gone lie everyone need a generator.. good investment
Yes he gave good reason
Y’all should set the camera to the side so we can see u all laughing and cutting up
Queen u got a normal size head they cappin girl ur beautiful 😂😂
He said he can do  Bite-ups 😂😂😂😂
C and Mod at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
cj got big
She said look like I’m in Yemen 😂😂😂😂😂
Clarance and Mod look so happy now they back together I love it ❤❤❤
I can’t help my 2nd grader with her math at all it’s so confusing to me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Clarance gotta be the litest step dad ever
CJ teeth look so good and white he looks just like Queen ❤❤❤❤
C don’t know what to think about Legend wanting a doll house 😂😂
I swear Legends the smartest kid I ever seen frfr❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
CJ-I wanna toy Clarance- I thought u was past that 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are you Clarances wife yet?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Legend like my kid focused on the tablet and nothing else 😂
That tablet or iPad does have a volume button 😂 turn it down 😂😂
Omg I love Legends hair he’s precious ❤❤❤
Click bait? I didn’t hear it
OMG I love that living room rug I want that
I’d get a rug the color of your kitchen cabinets
He got so big omg 🥹🥹🥹
Next time jus add some vinegar to it and it would have been real salad dressing #caribbeanstyle
Teach him how to stream on the PC
Nah he should have said he clean his room 🤣
I'm super duper excited to see you and Mod talking again. Happy tears....
Cj deserves to get a PC.
Get him the pc Clarence just because he’s good in school!!! That is good enough.
Definitely get my boy a pc
YES!! Get my boy a PC!!
Cj so cute 💚
I think queen is narcissistic, that’s why Clarence is always irritated , Clarence has more clarity and clarification of his thoughts and emotions , whilst queen can be careless and emotionally unstable …
Queen ima fan but you got some healing to do bro and CJ rubs Clarence the wrong way … idk the energy is off and weird … I feel distortion within the family , everyone has built up tension and rage from suppressing their thoughts and emotions …. The family needs more clarity, more honesty, the love and support is there and like any family needs some work but def something to point out , this ain’t a hate comment just a concern 🥴
When u have kids yk chicken nuggets are VERY important along w pizza 🤣
Navy blue rug under the dining table
Aww I love y'all back together ❤❤❤
7:30 please put a similar rug to this pillow in your dining area. A touch of black would make the new table pop! Love the new crib!! 😍🔥
He has queens personality for sure😂😂😂
Get my boy CJ the PC
I love Spicy gang so much. These videos help my day not going to lie. Legend and CJ are so precious and hilarious. Queen is giving Selena vibes with the hair color. I love it all!! The roast session was the icing on the cake!
Yes for the PC
They not just good reasons they great reasons
You should put a TV on that wall in the dinning room you could always play a background play music I think it would be dope
No Mod should not dye his grey patch he looks like a sexy skunk but a handsome chocolate one
Both of the babies got on the Travis Scotts like what are you sayinnn ! Lol too cute
CJ got bigggggggggg❤❤❤
Nah yal was banking on the storm for the vlog. 🤣
Yes
Broh, I felt like I spent just a few months I haven't watched their channel, and now I have come back and see CJ is like a giant?! When, where?
“Why y’all keep spinnin”😂😂
I prolly would’ve left out the crib after seeing dat rag @ 18:50 haaa
If you added vinegar it would of tasted pretty good

I was in a coma for the longest.Who is Legend?is it Renzo?
He can use PC for school. So if he being good in school that’s a good enough reason lol.
The Hermes pillows are fire for the contrast. It’ll bring the couch rug island table and fireplace together.
May as well buy a generator. You can get one for a thousand+
Clarence has definitely matured a lot more, good for him
CJ act just like his mama 😂😂🫶🏽
Lmao my kids be tryna have a conversation mid cartwheel. Kids are so damn disgusting with that but I really love it 😂❤

That gray patch in MOD hair is probably his birth mark. Bc i was never born with a birthmark on my body. Just a patch of gray hair at the age of 5 😭
What a beautiful video
Clarence needs to order his food first & then Queen..Queen just got to be last 😂
I was weak as hell when that man stepped outside taking deep breaths 😂🤣 That is so me. Anxiety on 1000

Yes those were great reasons, get him his PC!
Yes Cj deserves the pc
Solar panels too lol! I loved this video even though I’m still watching 😂❤
Queen I think you guys should remove one of the benches from the sides and add a black chairs. The new trendy ones that are cotton looking and have a round back . I think that will help the table area pop and go with the kitchen as well
Go buy a generator foreal, he’s right about that! It’s better to have than not.

Everything about this video warmed my heart and that smile Clare gave Cj was priceless💙
One thing I learned as a homeowner is that every home needs a generator. Your home should have a connection for one on the outside. I know most newbuilds in ga have them. Cj is so smart, by the way, and I love seeing him grow from the little baby to a handsome boy
Yes

Y’all don’t understand how much I miss these vlogs literally .. seeing all of them from the beginning of their YouTube journey ❤ from queen way way back in the day on her many eras of YouTube to mod and Clarence in the basement .. when queen first had cj and when they announced the pregnancy with legend 🥹🫶🏾 seeing all them back together is such a beautiful and genuine thing ! I love how Clarence and mod both are with cj and I love how they let legend pick any toys he wants no matter what it is as long as he likes it ! True parents true love it takes a village 🥹🧡

Oh my God

13:30-13:50 QUEEN is Me, I am Queen lmaoo
Y’all were in the middle of the hurricane he said 😭😂
I literally cannot with how stressed Clarence was 😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
Kids are a resemblance of Clarence and Queen…. So cute.
29:50 Queen Selenaaaa ❤
Give CJ a pc!!!
I’m literally LOL clearence say “why do y’all move around so much when y’all talking” Because my daughters do the same thing like do y’all have ants in y’all pants ?😂😂 .
Those are three great reasons 😂 not too much on him
Cj looks just like Queen
Get CJ the PC! Three great reasons🩵
Not white or cream because it will get dirty in the kitchen go with a colored rug or do a darker color or like the frost gray you have in the living room so it doesn’t catch all the dirt
The way Queen get on Clare nerves 😂😂 it’s so cute ❤❤
Black rug
Yes lol get CJ a PC he deserves it
@28:58 the way Clarence is looking at CJ is pure love. That type of affection can not be faked. For all the naysayers that were saying he didn't care for CJ, well here is the proof.  Those two have a real authentic bond and it's heartwarming.
The end of the video did damage to my chest...BITE UPPPPSSS😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please keep posting,,,,when I'm having a bad day yaw vibe definitely makes me feel more down to earth.
CJ deserves a PC ..... That is all lmao
Queen encourage ckarence to get one       Genesis generator look into that Clarence you do need one
Get him a pc
Get that young man his PC,  Queen and Clarence had me dying while they was at Popeye 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
I just love watching this family. A family that loves God and family that is fun and funny to watch. And yes get CJ that PC😊
Oh my gosh!!! Legends hair is so long
Lmfao when queen did that awwwwww at the drive thru 🤣 😂😂😂 💀 I rewinded it 5 times
Nope...jkjk if it's for educational purposes than yes with parental control notifications. Not because we don't trust CJ, but because the world is a creepy and scary for that age. The saying that goes, if you don't teach your kids, life will and it's ruthless.
Queen got me cracking up on how excited she got for Popeyes “oh yeah oh yeahhhhhh”😂😂😂😂 she already thinkin how good it’s finna be
I ain’t gone lie home doing good is school is good reason what about cleaning his room and you his favorite other then that give him that pc lol
awww please get him that PC lol he was trying hard for those three reasons
We ran out of very important things like chicken nuggets 😂 I never laughed so hard cause it's relatable as a mom 😂
Yes that Baby deserve a PC
They rib session was hilarious 😂😂😂
24:35 Clare said that’s a BIG WHO? 😂😂😂☠️☠️☠️ cus he ain’t say Mario 😂😂
He did he’s best  ☺️ he deserve it 🙏
FAMILY IS SO IMPORTANT! THIS IS BEAUTIFUL AND HILARIOUS AT THE SAME TIME! LOVE YOU GUYS🥰💖
I take that back about the black carpet. I thought your cabinets were black.
definitely suggest some placemats for that table!! oil is unforgiving on wood tables like that
CJ WAS SPITTIN WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT HURRICANE.  he so smart!! he def beat Clarence in that moment 😂
yes cj deserves his PC he thought long and hard for his 3 reasons
I think he deserves a pc
3:20 y’all gotta put some flowers in the center
Let lil man get the PC
black rug
Love this video im like cj i dont think the hurricane will be as bad as it is on the coast but the power for sure can go out. With the dining area get a grey rug so it matches the marble in the kitchen then get black and grey pompi to go in the corner. You can get black vases with grey pompi or get grey vases with beige or white pompi that will be really cute.
Yes, CJ reasons are good!🙌🏾
If y’all don’t get Cj that pc lol 😂😂😂😂❤ he definitely deserves it 🥹
In queen’s defense Popeyes did have spicy nuggets a few times lol
Naw “BITE UPs” is krazy 😂😂😂😂
WIFE HER UP CLARENCE !! 🎉👰🏽‍♀️💍
They did use to sell spicy nuggets and they were BOMB!
He deserves the pc 🥺
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
X-mass is coming up. 😅 that’s a good reason

Now Clarence know damn well he experience Hurricane Sandy in NYC (2012 or 2013)
Lol they are smackedddd
It’s so refreshing seeing all of them together. I’m cracking up throughout  the video w/them 😂 #upcomingyoutuber 💕
You need some color. I suggest yellow and silver or red
You always need a generator NGL
MANE CLARENCE GIVE MY BOI CJ THAT PC
My guy cj so smart 🖤🤘🏾
Cj looking like his mommy with that smile aww!
you guys should put accent chairs at the end of your dining table instead of a mirror on that wall, and add a picture then curtains with the vase in the corner and pampas
Queen always been beautiful but I swear she just gets prettier and prettier 😍
Y’all slap happy capping on eachother at the table had me cryin😂😂
Godly cj look just like his mom ❤️💜

Dw queen, I'm just like you when I order. 😂❤
Queen looks amazing
Looks beautiful, I would recommend for contrast & to bring everything together do a rug that matches the color of the cabinets. A black or a dark grey with some matching vases or decor for on top of the table
Black and grey and beige rug would be nice under the table or if you guys want something more bright try doing. A accent color to place all around the kitchen and dining area
Cj personality just like his mom😂😂😂😂😂so gooofy!
Get a generator!!!!!  Better safe than sorry…. Boys need responsibility.. keep room clean, take out trash to earn a pc!!!

Sell those other systems and buy him a pc. You can always upgrade the parts and when he gets a older and needs it for school work he’ll have a pc for that too.

Clarence getting a lil chubby 😂😂 eating good I see
The rug should be the color of the cabinets or a marble type rug to match the countertop
Give that boy a pc
The rug under your dining room table should be a similar color to the kitchen cabinets.
Sound like 3 good reasons to me 🤷🏽‍♂️ I say get him the PC 😜
Leave queen alone she’s a Libra we’re indecisive asf 😂😂 I do the samething when ordering food like I’ll see the menu and still ask if they have something different in the back

Legend isn't as smart as CJ was at that age I'm sorry I said it

Those three good reasons CJ. Get that boy a PC but he gotta keep his room clean or it gets taken CJ 🫵🏽 ~internet cousin 💕💕
There is no better trio than y'all.
Them roasting each other at the end had me dying laughing 😂😂😂😂
Yes I love those bench tables for the house 11:42 NOPE CJ you have all the others do you keep your room clean do you have to be asked several times to do something to you get mad when you don’t get what you want when you want it can you take no for an answer without throwing a fit or getting mad these of course are for your parents to decide if you really need one right now
“A nice lil long cucumber crazy” 😂😂
CJ gave some really hard hitting and persuasive reasons as to why he deserves a PC 🤔 I stand with CJ and would go as far to say that he NEEDS a PC 🤷🏾‍♀️
CJ and legend are so handsome !
Voting yes for cj
1:35 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Cj brought so much light and hope UNTIL that adult SAGITTARIUS ♐️ THAT THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT AND PREPARE THEN CAME THE DARK CLOUD IN THE ROOM CJ LOOKING LIKE GUY  THAT WAS A LOT IN ONE BREATH NOW HE IS CONCERNED 😂😂😂😂😂 AGAIN GUYS FROM A FEMALE SAGITTARIUS ♐️ IF THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY THERE IS NOT COLD REFRIGERATION THOSE ARE PERISHABLES
I’m So Glad He Asked Clearance that Question Because They Are Successful they Pretty Much Have Everything and Can GIFT Eachother pretty much anything But i Have Never Saw ANY Intention, Committment, or a Desire from Clearance to Marry Queen And i Love Them Both Together and Being That They Have a Family Together i DONT See what’s Holding Him Back Honestly i Know Queen Loves him and Wants Marriage But There is Definitely Something that is Holding Clearance Back because if she is the woman for him and don’t want to lose her he would have beeeennnnnn sought to Marry Queen To Make her His wife  Same With Sean And Jhene Aiko and Ari and Money Bagg People DONT think Deep Like This What is Keeping them from marrying these women
Don’t get that boy a pc lmao he gives he gone gone play w it for a few days n then forgets about it vibe 😂😂🤣🤣🤣

CJ grew up so muuuuuuch DAMN i’m shook
Those are 3 great reasons CJ.  🎉🎉

Sooooo happy Clarence and Mod are friends again ❤️ I live in NC and they put us in a state of emergency too but it wasn’t really anything to talk about but when we went to beach in SC that weekend the hurricane turned into a tornado and a man lost his whole roof to his house and a car flipped over smh

Clarence has temper tantrums lol
He better get the PC
Like a gray to match the cabinets and a big picture with all the color schemes of your home. You can diy your own big picture, that would be dope!
Yep good reasons get the pc
Picture and maybe a jewel tone rug for table
the indecisiveness is most definitely a Libra thing🤣🤣🤣🤣 i’m a libra and i can’t make my mind up for shit! 🤣😭😭😭
Yes give the boy a pc
W on the generator
Purchase a generator.. if you live in a house you should have one

I feel clearance he probably gets over stimulated quick that happens to me
That’s definitely 3 good reasons! Give Cj his PC 😊
Clearance Get Cj A Pc, Hes A Good Boy & Deserves One!! 😊❤
The Roast Session Sent Me 😂😂😂
Queen put a accent color in there 2 make your furniture & rug pop, like lavender or purple pillows or yellow or blue pillows & get the vase in that same color, even red, those colors will make everything pop!  Trust me girl !
The ending had me in TEARSSS😂😂😂😂😂”bite up” 🤣🤣🤣

That look like a outdoor park bench
Cream and black abstract rug and black and white art
Grey patch looks good different and unique
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Clara said like you can get out of a in between a fence I'm dying over here got me rolling too hard
I honestly have court in a few hours and need to get my mind right but these vibes right here to real😊
Clarence sounding like a news castor I love it💚
You guys roasting each other had me crying. Y'all should do a Try Not to Laugh Roasting Edition😂❤
Love the vlog. I still think you guys need an interior designer to bring all of your ideas together, but you guys are making good progress.
Omg CJ is so big now 😢🥰
I’m glad y’all back together ❤
Cj acts just like his mom lol
Queen looks so gorgeous in that intro🥺😍Damn mama
Yes Clarence get it for him !
Love Selena too ❤❤
Yes that was 3 good reasons
We been through a lot of hurricanes in New York lol. Where you been? 1:02 hurricane sandy in 2012 , hurricane Katrina lol all happened
Yes I'm so happy to see all them together ❤
The best 3 good reasons I’ve ever heard!!! #TeamCJ❤️
Cj is so sweet 🥰 I vote yessss for the pc!
“We are in the middle of the hurricane” 😂😂😂
Yes to CJ’s PC. Y’all need to order food online and pick up because that was crazy. Lol. I felt Clarence. 😭 Love seeing the family altogether. Everybody looks so happy. 🌶️
Those 3 reasons were good 😂 get that young man the PC ❤
I say yes to getting cj a pc if he is consistent and takes care of it some kids want it all and then it collects dust as far as cj going back in forth from mom to dads maybe a steam deck (portable pc) will be a better fit 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
I love Legend little voice . CJ getting so big i can’t .
I think cj gave three gooooood reasons 😂😂
a black rug?
Them vocals when she sang "como la flor "🎶 😮❤
CB looks just like his mom 🥰
Y’all better get my YouTube nephew a PC 😂❤❤
Get the baby the PC 😂😂😩
Cj needs his PC is better.  Like he Said
I heard 4 good reasons lol
Get Cj a pc… I say yes lol
Get cj a steam deck
"I love you Always." So genuine and sweet from Legend....Your Virtual Aunties and Uncles love you always too!❤
Every family should have a Generator In their home. Shout to The Bear for the Trader Joe’s run 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 that’s definitely the spizzy💝 CJ deserves a PC. It’ll give him better Access to educational learning! #PCForCJ
No PC tell him wait till he 12 lol
0:53😂😂😂
Omg i think a black rug would fit so well
PCs are definitely better than ps5 and Xbox as long as the pc is built with good parts. If he’s been good than I don’t see why not. Maybe give away his other consoles , like one or the other type thing.
My daughter sound the same exact way as Cj, with the moving and spinning while she talks and all 😂 it’s that age lol and her reasons would’ve sounded just like that too. These kids are just too funny! You should have him write a story or do something creative to explain why he needs a PC!
36:31 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He has queen personality 😫❤️❤️
« Who’s making spicy nuggets back there?? » 😭😭😭😭😭
Yesss he deserves it!! ❤😂 11:18
I honestly love how you guys could afford to just go buy it, but you guys show your kids discipline first and that it takes hard work, dedication, and sometimes waiting to get the things you want. And showing that because you want something doesnt mean you need it right away. Great job mom and dad!🤍 keep going! Your doing great!
Leave Mod alone Clarence🥺
The ending took the cake with the jokes!! Great video overall!! Yes CJ deserves the pc great 3 reasons!! So good to see you and Mod enjoying each others company! Queen your always a vibe!! Keep them coming!!!
Love you queen and clearance and cj
Naw hes right about the generator though.
Awww omg if legend ran up and hugged me I’d die he’s so freaking cute !
Yes get him a pc because he does great in school
Legend, needs his hair going back ….you have beautiful boys keep up the wonderful work
I was waiting for him to say to study or do homework 😭 but his 3 reasons was good 😩😭
Those are 3 great reasons lol PC is just good. Innanet nephew could use it for a lot it’s fast too 😭🩷🙏🏽
i think it would be nice if cj got a pc because he can use it to do hw or study on it as well as use it for recreation.
Ayo😂😂😂 "Bite ups" is crazy 😂😂😂 I'm in real tears 😅😅
I think a black rug would look best in the dining area. Since the kitchen has black cabinets it will tie in with the kitchen. Also if y’all are eating at the table and one of the kids drop food or something it’ll be easier to clean than a lighter colored rug
gray rug
Y’all should get one of those Waterfall wall things
Solid reasons to me ☺️
Stop playing and buy that baby his computer he deserves it!!!… specially because you know his dum daddy cnt 😂😂😂 lol get him his computer
Queen’s hair color is everything. It suits her perfectly 😍
Need a generator yes smart  NYC think smart.  Didn't need a blower  lol but you do need a generator 😊
I love Clarence for real man. He’s a good spirit. Can’t believe how big the kiddos got!
Get that boy a PC those reasons are good😂😂❤️
Yoooo y’all got me crying this morning 🤞🏽😂😂😭😭
Yesss get cj that pc 😂❤️
He said I'm not gone lie being a man is hard 😂😂
Don’t put oil down your sinks it going to stop up your pipes
BOTTA PUT EM ON THE ULTIMATUM
A pc is a big responsibility. You will have to take extra security measures. Especially with all the weirdos online. Gotta protect the kids at all cost. He has to be a serious gamer to get one. And please please monitor everything CJ does. I have a family member who's nephew was being lured by a so called teen girl and the girl was really a adult.
Clarence is so dramatic😂😂😂”queen been through like 3 hurricanes” bye he’s hiliarious😂😂😂😂
Anyone else been waiting for this video because WHEN TF IS CLARENCE MARRYING QUEEN?? Y’all got a whole kid and been together for a fatass minute and he’s STILL NOT PROPOSED?? stalling …
Cj looks like ah teenager... if times don't fly...auntie proud of you baabybwooy ❤
I haven’t watched you guys in a long time. When CJ just started talking and showing his personality I literally lost it🤯🤯. I remember the small CJ with short hair😭😭.
queen looks soo beautiful
Clarence n Mod mad smacked 😭😭 fuccin up salad dressing
I love how queen surrounded by boys all day 😂 she literally the queen in her crib
i love how cj and clare always playing in the bck of the videos😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Cj tried to calm Clarence down telling him they’ll be okay during the storm ⛈️ you can tell lil cj loves Clare ❤
I love how she’s a huge star but still so humble and genuine/relatable ❤️
most definitely need a generator fam
Get him a pc he a good kid and have good grades
Definitely get a generator it definitely will come in handy if a storm occurs or if the power goes out won't regret it at all
Proud of Clarence! Just the amazing growth . God Bless Him
I smiled all the way through, y’all have a beautiful blessed family ❤❤ AND GET CJ the PC those are gr8 reasons 😊
A red rug would POP🔥🔥 or orange / blue or a bright/rich color..BUT grey or white would def be 🔥 too
Yes CJ should have a PC because he's my sweetheart and I like him but remember you have to get your grave all A++++ if you get a c- that's ok but if you also get B- 😢 NO PC FOR LIFE!!!!  YOU WOULD SCREAM LIKE THIS NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! Lolol
CJ definitely deserves a PC . He smart kid, very well behaved and very good in school.
He deserved it that was a good argument CJ
That hair colour is EVERYTHING on Queen, she looks absolutely stunning❤
The indecisive-ness is definitely a Libra thing. 😂😂
Them joking each other had me weak 😂
Them roasting has me dyinnnnn
No I hate that if it’s not in menu don’t ask for it and know what want before you order don’t get up there and do that
You should put some live plants in there
CJ is definitely queens child.....lol😂😂😂😂😂 goofy
MOD look like he can have a fight with a giraffe
7:50 aw Leggy 😭
OMG look how big CJ has gotten.... His smile is so cute
Those were amazing reason 🤷🏽‍♀️ 11:31  plus he gone be good in school🫵🏽
Black and white designed rug modern rug
Yes it is good get CJ a PC ❤❤❤❤
Cj is Absolutely 1000% Queens son 😂😂😂😂😂 I’m lovin that new color on Queen and I might be old but PC? What is that? And don’t laugh at me y’all I’m old school 🥴🥴 and Mod that damn  wash cloth tho 😂😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️. I’m so glad Spicy Mafia is back. I literally forgot how much y’all feed off each other. I’m glad that Queen and Clarence relationship never changed the dynamic of their bond of 3/4. The only person missing is Lee. Lee just dipped and Never came back. Should we all start a WHERE IS LEE CAMPAIGN? Lee added a calm smooth dynamic evening out Mod and Queens goofiness and we also need some more episodes of Pio and Tio ASAP (story times,games,pranks etc) Us OG’s Miss You Lee we know you’re working hard behind the scenes Rockin Out but we need some time to 🤷🏽‍♀️🥴
I know is taking a long time to get the crib set but is going to be worst it for sur e
Vinegrette minus the vinegar!
I need that Yellow KidCudi Sweater Clarence, is wearing ASAP 🔥😩
Not Clarence outside the car tryna relax like some shit I do lol I’m not the only oneeee 🎉 life be lifeinnnn lol

Clarence smiling at CJ is everything ❤ get him the PC
QUEEN YELLOW IS YOUR COLOR 😭😍😍😍😍
CJ acts just like his momma
Yeah , get CJ his PC … those were great answers 😂

The roast session at the end is my favourite 🤣🤣🤣🤣 bite ups took me out 😭😭
Lol yes, get our Nephew a PC 😂 and aww Legend we love you always too 🫶🏾 welcome back MOD ! We missed you ❤
Black😍
It's so good to see you guys. The kids are growing up so quickly. Your boys are adorable and handsome ❤❤
I hate when ppl outside of our YouTube family has something to say about y’all not being married but we’re in no rush for you guys to get married take y’all time ❤❤❤❤
Get lil man a pc
Yessss get him a pc getting good grades is enough ❤❤❤😂
CJ is so smart. A PC would be great for him to do future research when doing school work and other research about hurricane and essentials that’ll be good to have during emergency situations. Lol
I think a cream colour rug Queen
Get my boy a PC
Y’all beautiful 🤩
Get Cj the PC 😅😊❤ Table 🔥🔥🔥
So sweet!! A generator would be a good investment, bc anything can happen.  I believe a dark rug would make the table pop bc your cabinets are dark or whatever color your fixtures are esp if they’re good.
Legend hair long as hellll
I am not going to hold you I don't play with natural disasters at all. I take them all serious even when they're not coming in my direction but especially when they're not sure of the trajectory I stay ready. Nothing wrong with being prepared Clare! Blessings over all and your beautiful families ❤
Those are great reasons cj ! ❤😂
Legend so cute naming all the characters so clever 👏 ❤
Yes, CJ gave you 3 good reasons as to why he deserves a PC!
Ask 3 questions related to the bi le for cj if he answer correct get him that PC
Cj's reasons were killing me 😂😂😂😂. He deserves it because he likes it. Gotta love the innocence of children.
Omg look at cj 😢he getting so big
With every house you should get a back up generator it’s a lifesaver seriously
Love these vibes💙
Yes those were 3 good reasons to buy CJ a pc
Mod and Clarence had me weak the way they was cracking on each other 😂😂😂😂
The replay of him rejecting the umbrella after saying he was soak and wet 🤣🤣🤣
Get that man his pc he deserves it 😂😅
Yess get him a pc

Yea get him one
Black rug fasho
Clearance get that generator fr. It’s not a bad idea
😂😂😂😂😂
Yooo Clarence and mod relationship too funny 😂😂😂
Mod definitely needs a cooking channel!!💯 and I just love this whole video!! Thank you, guys, for giving us such a long video! I love them! Great vibes and laughter. I love to watch you guys! I wish you all more blessings, safety, happiness, security, positivity, prayers, and love!
The roast session at the end was lit
Legend’s pronunciation is too good for his age 👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾
13:35 😭🤣🤣
😂”Mass Confusion”
Picture and vace and  Pompous grass a little bit of green sense its by window a plant like a little gold yellow would be nice with the black and white
Y’all gotta try the roasted garlic and pesto frozen pizza 🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂
best vlog i've ever watched, had me so weak love ya'll. I been here since the story times n soundcloud iykyk. genuine love fr
Beautiful vlog
What CJ meant to say was, 1. I do well in school 2. With a P.C I can start my gaming channel 3. The PC is multifunctional. 😂❤
Beautiful family love your vibes ❤ Clarence was distressing earlier and ended with LhisAO.
Yes!!! Hey our nephew that PC please!!!
CJ is googling what is a good reason to get a PC 😂😂😂😂 too funny… yes he gave 3 good reasons… team CJ to get a PC
Legend has a perfect cartoon voice omg
Yes cj can get a pc
Yess them is good reasons CJ!!
Love the gang back together you guys have me cryinggggg
YESSSS GET HIM THAT PC 😂❤
YESSS GET HIM THE PCCCC 🤣🤍
Omg it’s been a while since I’ve seen your videos Cj is soooo big 😢
Lol I know it’s clickbait, but what made y’all want to use that as the caption?..
My wife and I purchased a whole home generator last year! The best investment, ever! Especially, after being in a drafty house with no heat for 3 days.
The way people speak bad about Clarence is really confusing lol this guy loves his family and loves CJ you can tell by the way he looks at him and plays with him and just speaks to him! Clare really wants the best for CJ! Also I just love how Mod just fits in the family dynamic, I missed all them together it’s like Mod was the missing part at one point, when he wasn’t around it felt weird you definitely feel Mods presence 💯
😂😂 I understand the anxiety part
Cj deserves the PC!
Do a black rug in the dining room to tie everything together
Yoo y'all is mad funny had me rolling 😂😂
Queen is the biggest 🤡 . A man knows when he wants to marry you and it doesn't take long. Good luck with that one 😂😂😂😂
This was a great video, you guys are hilarious!
Nah Clearance is really mad funny lmaooo
Green like grass for the rug
Hello fam I hope your guy are okay , thanks for the content , your nails look nice
As Y'all would say, this video got me tight...lol!    Idk Hooda agree with, Hooda counsel first, Hooda worry about, or Hooda feel for or what????  I guess my anxiety is up too Clair!  Ok, this is one of those vids where I have to start from the beginning and pause at intervals of importance!  (I LOVE Exclamation points ❣ so its going to be ok!)  hahahaaaaaaa  I had 2 little Virtual Grandsons that used to come over almost every weekend, and now they're gone, so it feels so good to see the boys with their cute little matching do's, and just bouncing around all over place.  That's why I love boys, they are very rambunctious!  YET, you have to start, right now, teaching them when it's a time to SIT STILL, and when they can just roam freely.  They have to be able to goto others houses without breaking things and allow you guys to have down time.  You both do a great job with them, so far!  Thanks so much for letting us see the house.  It is spacious!  Q, I'd say you have Michigan, warm and cozy fireplace, romp around with the boys by day and snuggle up with your man by night taste!?? Good choice for dining table since you seem to like everyone to be included and not feel left out of anything.   I might suggest you flip through magazines, take some pics of a couple rooms at a time and go sit down with a couple designers, or maybe college students (NO, Privacy) whose taste you like, and just pay for their plan, then take from them ideas about where to put things, but then use and improvise as you see fit.  It's just about getting ideas from as many sources as you can stand!  rest later... gotta do some crafting.
I love that y'all will allow Negative, Hatters ruin y'all family or relationship ✔️💯🙌💜💙 Clarence have alot of trolls and Hatters when it comes to his Queen 🧐And he shake them Hatters off and keep them trolling👏Grown Man shit..
Love the family❤🔥💪🏾
I really enjoy seeing y’all kids .. I love when kids are loved properly. So beautiful 🥹❤
Had to comment again. The house is beautiful 🤩 Definitely giving rich rich 🤑 The kids are beautiful 😻 If y’all ever have a girl omg 😩😍

I glad you’ll doing YouTube because you’ll be having some good content and you’ll YouTube channel if you say that you’ll don’t want to do YouTube anymore I think I wood cry❤️

It’s so good to see you guys all back together again 👍🏾👏🏾🤗❤️🥰
Yes good reasons
lol my son says those reasons are really good reasons.
I think he deserves the pc 😀
This is so random but I also got a table from west elm and have three boys. I had a glass made to add on top of the table to protect it from spills and bangs from kids toys. Best decision ever get yourself if you guys would like a glass top for that beautiful table. Also make sure it’s tempered glass.
Queen! when ordering do what i do.. my man be mad because i have to get 2 things from every place cuz i cant decide. It gets him so tight! 😂😂😂😂
Loving the energy and vibes in this video😍
*I’m so happy that Mod is back!! 😊 Love that hair colour on you, Queen!! ❤️🔥 And YES for CJ getting a PC!! Lol!* 👍
I like the table nice. I like the connection clarence has with clarence. And yes cj deserves a pc lol using paper towel soak up olive oil should add vinegar or could of put in blender blend. Ya around go pumpkin picking with the kids and go in corn field maze be funny
The end 😭😭😭
What’s crazy is I didn’t even notice that grey patch on Mod’s head until Queen said something 😂😂😂

The hiking session had me weak 🤣🤣🤣
Call my name and save me from the dark 😂
Fire escape neck is craaaaazy 😂😂😂
Aww y’all gotta get CJ his PC lol 😩😩😩
Y’all actually do need a generator lol. Most people in the south has one. You hook your fridge, phone chargers, and things like that up to it, so your food isn’t damaged. We bought a portable AC unit( not the old fashioned window AC units), and plugged it into the generator to keep the house cool. Oh and buy lots of board games
Yes he deserves that PC because he’s a great kid ❤
Y’all are so Funnyyyy lmao 😂🤣 it’s a genuine vibe just watching y’all videos 🫶🏽i love y’all real bad 💕

Queen looks tf good 😍

Their friendship definitely didn't miss a beat
What about orange 😂 for the rug
Only New Yorkers be roasting each other 😂😂😂😂 I’m crying. Clare got an old man laugh & Queen got the aunty laugh who sound like she got asthma 😂
Get my nephew a pc
Mines is a lil smaller but I have the same table different color

A 40 minute vlog…yess. I think those were great reasons for a pc lmao🥰😂.. that’s sweet that he want them to get married tho. And I think plants are a great idea for the shelves. Y’all can get candles for the shelf too and other designer books or just regular ones and bearbricks which are similar to the kaw figurines y’all have   Edit : if y’all a more luxury feel to the living room neiman Marcus got stuff but if not I’m sure some place like home goods got nice decorative stuff

Yes cj deserves a pc
lmaoooo Queen in the drive thru 😂😂😂😂

Just also be safe with generators also
My Jesus… been watching queen since day 1 & cj has gotten so big it’s crazy and makes me feel old af. 🫠🩵
Lol. I feel you Clare. But you can always get the house set up with a generator wired up, so like when the lights go out with a storm the generator will kick in. Most people in Florida have it done when they get their houses done.
7:47 legend so cute😭
Yes he deserves it
2 of the answers was the same
Nah this vlog is HILARIOUS. I was really dying laughing when yall was going in on each other 😂
Y’all recorded this before the hurricane and obviously we know now that the “hurricane” in GA wasn’t that bad. When CJ said it , I was like that boy smart AF!! Hurricanes don’t really affect us as much here in GA.

You should order Goku for him because they don’t have that in store 🏬.
The table scene and jokes was so good😂😂😂
Dark forest green rug for under table? 🧡🌲
You should add upholstered end chairs for the kitchen table
Pearl white for the rug.. Peru 🇵🇪 in the house ..
Order Queen's food last....solved. Get interior designer for living room and master bedroom. Give those figurines to one of your young supporters or CJ, yall are too mature for that.  Love the rug, I  like the table, but it washes out with the floors, need some color...maybe a centerpiece ir table throw. Love that Spicy Gang is back. I didn't realize how much I missed seeing everyone together again. ❤❤❤❤
Queen looks beautiful!!! She looks like a Latino with her hair like that!! 😍😍😍

I really appreciate the back-to-back videos from my FAVE!! The boys are growing up so fast AND handsome!  So happy to see the gang together. And I love that grey patch in Mod's hair.

Yes get a generator
Clarence and CJ relationship had grown so much,It's to amazing to watch.❤

Poor Clarence 😂😂😅😅
Those are 3 GOOD Reasons yes
Glad everyone is doing well.
First, Cj is super smart. Secondly the no food, water and power happened here in Texas during the winter storm and it was insane I went exactly two weeks without power. Stay safe!
Cj definitely deserves the pc because he does good in school, he’s respectful and just a good kid overall. 😊
It's cute! Put a mirror and maybe a black and grey rug with a cute centerpiece on the table!
Get the generator. A Solar one!
I think Cj earned the PC Clarence...Love this vlog. Yall had me Rollin
do a navy and like nude/brown/cream rug to match the kitchen.. Queen you look so beautiful I love the hair color
11:40 get cj that pc
Navy blue rug!!!!! Cause what if you drop food on the cream rug!!
I’m soooo glad mod & Clare bk ! Yes 🙌🏽 CJ WEDDING 💒 we need it …Queen looking good in yellow
I think it’s smart to have a generator on deck. Just in general
Cj definitely was trying but them was only 2 reasons buddy 🥹🥲🤣🤣🤣🤣
CJ is getting so big Omg I can’t even take it anymore 🥹🥹🥹 slowwww downnnn kiddo
The roasting session 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣my stomach was in knots
I think we need to revisit the question in 3 months lol
Watching ON MY TV ❤
Where did Clare get his sweatshirt from
In the living on the blank wall. You all should take some professional black and white photos. You should do a family wall of pictures
Oh my goodness c j has gotten big He's so handsome
Those were 3 GREAT reasons CJ
Valid reason!!👏🏾He deserve it you should be like "do some research first" and surprise him ❤️
He acts just like his mother 😊😅😅
I love the dinning table. Since your kitchen is black would wood accents. I love the neutral colors like black, cream and gray. You can always accent would gold and a pop of color. You can do royal blue, burnt orange, yellow. I agree Queen a nice tall one plant in the corner.
Yesss get him one
Yes cj get a pc because he very respectful to others
CJ is so big god bless him you have two handsome boys 🙏🏼🙏🏼

Beautiful family❤ Queen you looking all gorgeous i love that color
Aye. In her defense they don’t add everything on the drive thru menu. I download apps for all places because they always have extra items and specials.

I been waiting for this
lmao that anxiety be so real on the outside we seem fine but on the inside it feel like everything is panicking and everything turns to tunnel vision. if you don’t have it you won’t get it
We missed MOD 💙
My kids be spinning all day 🤣 boys don’t stop moving
“Daddy” “you welcome son”😂 that was a genuine moment  12:00
Also y’all definitely need to a family picture for the house and I think there’s books like that Tom ford book from Louis Vuitton YSL and HERMES
Legend voice would be a good commercial voice for kid toys.
Yess
Those reasons are good but my 3 reasons are because he is respectful, he is well behaved and he is very loving!!!
that hair color on Queen suits her so well!  CJ is so big now & so adorable😍  Clarence is so funny bc why do kids move around so much while they’re talking?! like🗣️sat down & be still!😂😂😍
Let him Get a doll house
CJ! Stop growing up so fast 😭🥹… please 😢
Clarence needs some peace 🤣
Is it a New York thing or swag with the sweater or long sleeve shirt with shorts?...I always wondered do Clare be hot.. Enjoyed the video.. hope we get like 2-3vlogs a week.. let's gooo❤❤❤❤
A dark rug. The cabinets are dark and the dining area is light colored already.
Clarence... I feel your pain. Just order first man... order your stuff. You know what u want, handle that and then move on to them. Because what I have found is that they won't mess up the first order. It's when you start going back and forth... adding, subtracting, multiplying etc that they start messing up the orders.
Always have a small generator period
❤

Queen looks soo good🔥
Cream rug
Seeing y’all 3 together again is EVERYTHING RT ❤❤❤❤ohh yeah CJ definitely deserves the PC 😉
Yes. Those are great reasons to get CJ a PC 😊
The bromance is back
Tell Mod I’ll Holla at him lol we both single 😂
The way Clarence got CJ’s approval for your hand in marriage >>🥹 it’s such a blessing that they have a beautiful bond and CJ gets to be raised in a healthy loving two parent household with his baby brother whom he could now play with in this gorgeous new home. Then Mod coming over for family time is just the missing piece that was needed, everything just came around full circle ❤
Yes buy him a PC
Do a darker rug to match your cabinets! Dont do one to blend with the table.
I like Mods gray patch! It’s 🔥
clarence reporting live driving in the rain is sending me lmao this day was an emotional rollercoaster for him lmaooo
Wow.. I was thinking the same thing as CJ watching your last vlog. 😂
I enjoy watching you guys so cute. Boys don't play about they momma❤😂. Boy&Girl mom
Keep the patch!! Now he can go from Patty to just plain Patch!! Or we can call him Patty Patch!!
I'm loving these consistent videos 🥰
Clarence and .. Queen need her girl.. Sometime soon..if not wedding 💒 yet..

A generator is definitely needed. My hubby bought one about a year ago, it was expensive ,but the best investment ever.
Not bite ups!! I’m deadddd!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where has the time gone. I remember when CJ was a baby.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌷🌷🌷🌷💐💐💐💐💙♥️💙♥️💙♥️
The end was jokes 😂. U should do a spicy gang roasting battle video
Cj speaking facts it’s not as bad w places farther from water hurricanes
I have missed this crazy crew!! Sooooooo happy that the gang is back together!! Got mt stomach hurting I’m laughing so hard!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️
Its so good to see you all together and CJ is so grown and love how him and Clarence are close.Legend has a unique personality and is very smart little boy.The generator idea makes sense as if the power goes out,what are you going to do,love from England❤💯🙏
I’m an interior decorator.  Brick red or midnight blue rug

Good enough for me ! Get that boy a PC lol ! Team CJ
Did you just look up why you deserve a PC 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CJ so handsome....he gone be taller than Queen soon...Damn, Legend  done got big too. Seems like I haven't seen the boys in forever❤❤❤. Handsome boys
Cj deserves it because he deffinetly is a GOOD student, u can tell he’s very well behaved!!, and just an Awsome kid all around!! Get the child that PC! ❤️
LOVE you too, Legend!!! 🤍🤍🤍
Keep the gray patch. It look’s distinguished.
Just the math alone❤yesssssss
Definitely a pic in the lil dining area by the kitchen. I’ve said it before but Queen is just GORGEOUS omg 😍😍😍😍 it’s like she gets more breathtaking each video and this hair color is def my fave ever on you girl!  Love y’all’s lil family and patiently (not really) waiting for the wedding 🥰

Queen with the Beyoncé bday hair ! Mmkay!
I love their hair❤ they are so handsome i ddnt know cj hair grew back so fast
Get cj the pc 😡
“We have food” 😂 w kid
The Roasting session at the end killed me
Yea I ain’t gone lie that would make me tweak out if a person kept doing wat queen do wen ordering food 😂 like wait until the end wen they repeating the order don’t just cut me off smh cause now I’m confused my patience running low n I’m irritated
CJ deserves the pc
I missed seeing y’all together! #SpicyGang 🥹❤️
Clarence shut up talking about the rug 🤣🤣😂😂 we know my son
he deserves a PC
Dude probably ain’t want to get married, so he can smash as much women as possible… or he should have been lock her up..
Get married already
Awww❤❤❤❤
You need a darker rug to contrast.. the floor and table  are light
I think that's 3 great reason for cj to get a PC ❤
CJ getting big Woww that’s crazy…But let CJ have it cause he deserves it…If he do good in school why not 🤷🏾‍♀️
Voting yes for CJ to get a PC. 🙂
🥳🥳❤️❤️❤️
Aww get CJ that PC❤
To avoid that drive thru situation, I just park in the lot and do a pickup order 😭😭
CJ deserves it for the explanation he gave about the hurricane 🌀   Get him the PC Clare!!
It should be a grey n cream rug i seen one b4 it was designed it was really nice
This was a good video!!  It's good to see y'all!  Oh a little decorating tip!.... You guys have a large beautiful home when you decorate use large items  !! Put some large art to fill the open spaces, bring pops of color to make it welcoming !  It's coming along though
Legend’s voice is everything he’s so intelligent 🥹 both of the boys have grown up so fast!
you guys should hire a professional decorator
Aye I feel you though Queen, I do that too. Your not alone and it has nothing to do with privilege I've always done it and my mom used to when she was on this earth. It's just kinda like, you really don't know if it's possible if you don't ask because there are a lot of times when it is possible fr 😂😂
Queen and Clarence, I loved your family video. Especially you all with Uncle Mod. Bring us back to the old days.
YES! You better get that baby a PC!!!😤💀💀
CJ deserves a PC😊
Yes, those were 3 GREAT REASONS
All I  know is he better hurry up and Marry queen🎉😂❤
Peace ✌️ ❤❤
get my boy the pc😂‼️
If CJ is behaving in school, getting good grades, AND behaving and doing what he’s supposed to do at home. I say, hook him up with the PC! Have it all set up afterschool and surprise him. 💕
Omgeeeeee, CJ has grown up so much!!! Awwwww, and Queen gets prettier and prettier every video❤️❤️
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES 4 CJ. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽😂😂😂🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
GET BEARBRICKS FOR THE LIVING ROOM 🔥

Cj deserves a pc .he is smart , respectful, and like he said does great in school lol . Give my boy a pc 🎉
Idk if Queen acts like her  child or if cj acts just like his momma 😂😅
Put a picture on the wall and a rug the color of the cabinets

Bite up’s is crazyyyyy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 36:46
A pc is the new thing why you got him tryna play a Xbox his daddy got him a PC lol jk jk 😅😅
LOOOL give our nephew the PC Clarence those were VERY good reasons tbh. Clarence doing the woosah is killing me because he’s dealing with three versions of Queen 😂😂😂
Legend hair hella long omg he’s so freaking adorable ❤
Cj doing good in school x100 is the only reason he should get a PC 🤍😭
I miss this❤ who knew
A generator is a good thing to have no matter what
Please do a champagne colored rug and decor for the table
Cj explaining the hurricane was too cute😂❤ he gave some valid points give ‘em his pc😂p.s. y’all been hinting about marriage all year and Clarence been saying wife a lot something must be coming 👀and i think Cj wanting them to be married is so cute he must see and feel the love❤.
Legend is sooooo 🥰🥰 🥰🥰🥰
Yes get him the pc
I genuinely love they relationship haha ❤
They have grown so much. Hair long af. CJ looks like he’s going to 7ft y’all. Legend about to have all the girls drooling. They both have bomb parents. Y’all are just a beautiful family. Y’all missing a little girl though.
There’s a different glow about the whole family it’s beautiful 💕
the way he pointed when queen asked who the oil in has me crying 💀
Cj deserve that PC for explaining that hurricane that good😭 he had me shook fr🤣
Omg leggy hair ❤❤
lol cj said I’m looking up the answers
Clarence is so men but queen does seem spoiled lol
Legend is too damn cuteeee
Clarence get cj the pc so u can be the Big W step-dad award but make him keep up with chores
Legend needs one of those toy opening channels!
Y’all should have him read a certain number of books to be able to get the PC😂 (he going to hate y’all but thank y’all in the future) then have him read what the book was about. How to spell words in the book and look up the definition and read it out loud too
Yes he seems to be quite an honest young man but I just love you all so much very handsome family ❤💯🤗
Okay cj very smart cuz they ain’t that serious lol
Queen is so gorgeous
Love the video
Queen looks stunning

CJ gave 13 great reasons I think you most definitely should get him a PC.

Love the 41 minute vlog 💜.
Queen definitely a passenger side princess 😂❤ Ian never seen her drive
We getting back to back videos ✨the kids are so smart. Definitely have to get Cj the pc lol
Nawl Clare, that's not special cause some times the cooks can make it work for u and that why I tip them. cause they love the job enough to care about how ppl want their food. That's what keep ppl coming back most times too
I think he deserves it
Yes
Gray rug!

Get him the pc!!!!!!
CJ DESERVES TWO PC’s just saying 🤷🏾‍♀️
Cj and Clarence playfulness lol 😆🥲❤️ and cj reminds me of my nephew in the looks department and smarts 🙈 it made me melt
Legend, voice sounds like he can be in a movie or something
Every time I see y’all y’all got a new place and showing it lol 😂 I be like I understand y’all known but dang y’all stay moving. Clarence should have been locked you down though smh we still love y’all together
An over 40 minute vlog, what?!? Love Love Love how y'all aren't stingy with content ❤️. It just warms my heart 💙. Love youuuuuuuus 💋🌟🪶
A rug would definitely be nice underneath, I would either add a credenza to one side of the room with decor etc… OR you can add fancy dining chairs to the ends of the table with decor on the walls.
Clarence don’t do Tina no more so it’s anxiety is threw the roof lol 😂
Them shorts though, lol!!! 😂😂😂
They're talking about no phones and game if they have no power but that also means no oven or microwave and stove unless they have gas
Clarence that I love you too with the laugh is  crazy 🤪
Def get my son Cj his pc😂😂so adorable

Those are three good reasons! CJ indeed deserves that PC once you doing good in school it’s an automatic YES to anything
Queen so pretty 😍
So what y’all preparing us for is, Clarence buying Queen an engagement ring for her birthday 💍🎉… Got it ❤
Clarence is right. It’s always good to have a generator incase the power goes out. Clare don’t listen to her lol
Yes, those are good reasons to get him a PC.

I think you should add a throw blanket to the couch and some pillow, maybe a snack place on the kitchen corner and black and white artwork also maybe some big candles on the table
Get that baby a PC 🤍😂

He really looked up reasons he deserve the PC 😂 but yes his reasons are valid
Get him the PC bro
Love the dining room table but I would absolutely go dark for the rug so you will have the contrast from the table and it’ll tie into the dark cabinets in the kitchen
I’m so happy Mod backkk😂😂
