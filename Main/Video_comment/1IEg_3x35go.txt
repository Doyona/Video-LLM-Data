Deus mandou te dizer 2mensagens! 1 boa e a outra má! A má é que: Ninguém nasce aqui de boa com Deus, todos nascemos pecadores, inimigos, separados de Deus por causa do pecado de Adão e Eva! Ninguém nasce como filho de DEUS e sim como filho de Adão! Por isso que herdamos o pecado e as consequências do pecado dele  Mas tenho a boa notícia que para sairmos dessa condição ruim só precisamos crer em Jesus Cristo e depois aprender o que ele trouxe que é a palavra de Deus para podermos caminhar em obediência! Quem tiver interessado nesse ensino está disponível, e é de graça, é só me contactar!

Stuff like this is my muse
The way trav is moving got me crazy 😜 I like this clip so bad ✨✨👌🏽😍 look at this dude move on the beat I like when they screamed “talk to me nicely “
Thugger’s hair looks like Popeyes chicken strips
Somebody know what the microphone he used?
what is first,second and third beat?
Can you just take a minute to realize that some people have sense and know god and know what you did when you performed at your latest concert ?  The world knows your not human.  Your a joke honestly. And I know god never brought you into this world.  All of these people wondering why  And it’s because your an animal and you have no heart, serpents have no soul - they are careless selfish and feed on greed and evil - that’s you.  Your not a human. I don’t believe it for one second.  Your something that needs to be in prison and awaiting his days honestly.
Travis is the goat

Hey Travis why don't you make full live stream of making music 🎶
Gayest song from him
All together united, parents and children, including grandparents, let us turn to the Eternal Father !!! * Therapeutic indications * www.padreceleste.com * Dear brothers, instead of useless thoughts including other worthless projects, we optimize everything and therefore I take this opportunity to offer you a mutual and collective collaboration carried out through prayer. Let me explain immediately: together with some of you, I formed a prayer group that I baptized "Trinity Network", which consists of a communion of universal brotherhood based on the love of God the Father. Every evening after dinner or in any case before to go to sleep, we each carry out the prayers from our own home together with the other participants, scattered in different places of the world. The prayer takes place by kneeling and with hands joined, beginning with a moderate voice with the Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory to the Father; (Important ... let us not separate our hands, since the Eternal communicates with the soul and we lose contact). As we begin to pray, we may be disturbed by external forces, such as thoughts, useless things, digressions and more. Through several repetitions of the prayers, the whole moves away, since even if we wanted to think something, it will be impossible to do so. Later we will begin with a greeting addressed to God and with the phrase "Hello Eternal Father."; below, there is an account of the problems or problems that worry us, with a request for help from the Eternal. Our prayer group draws from the church the three main prayers, Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory to the Father; (the easiest and most known to people) and empowers them with a familiar conversation with God, in which you can talk about everything with the Almighty, ranging from everyday trivialities to serious problems, in a word a real dialogue at 360 degrees . It is necessary between one anecdote and another and at the end of the conversation, to repeat once our Father, Hail Mary, Glory to the Father. For this reason, by praying together, the presence of God is simultaneous in all hearts and this facilitates His intervention. Having felt the benefit, it was decided to repeat the prayer in the morning and / or afternoon. Obviously, if the commitments of everyday life do not allow you to pray in the morning or in the afternoon, do not worry: you can move it to another time of the day, the Eternal understands and knows why you do it.  However, it is essential that the evening prayer be made without delay. I guarantee you the absolute benefit of the teaching used up to now and I assure you that dialogue with the Supreme frees the soul from impurities and brings peace and well-being. I enclose my most sincere greetings, in my name and in the name of the other brothers of the prayer group, hoping to be more and more numerous. A hug Afareen Kadivar! I received this prayer teaching in a social network from an Islamic girl, who advised me to read it carefully, not to delete it, to offer it to family and give it to friends, because it will be appreciated better than any good food, as it is useful for improve the soul! he sent him to make God known I enclose your prayers! The sign of the cross, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, Come your kingdom, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Help us not to fall into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen Ave or Maria full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women and the blessed is the fruit of your womb Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of Jesus, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen  Glory to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, now and forever and ever. Amen
Imagine owning a music studio and the whole crew just pull up and make this.
Everybody talkin bout that second beat but does no one care bout the first ?? That first one is crazy🔥🔥
I want UTOPIA NOW
mia ruined this so hard 😞
1:16 It looked like Travis was engineering for Thug there for a moment. In reality Thug most likely had Tumay or some other cat do his cutting and Travis is probably working on the arrangement of the song with Thug listening.
🙌🙌 YESSSSS
This inspired me to do something similar Im almost done with the project..see you in March
That fist 3 sounds could be a song like SICKO MODE
Esse beat é brb pprt 🔥🇧🇷👽💨
2021 Travis Scott

People complain that they don't have a good enough setup to make songs but Travis over here made NO BYSTANDERS with a blanket over the mic and he uses more than one different studio most people have their own

Ears bleeding
Why tf are people going crazy over the beat at 0:04? Not that it sounds bad it just sounds so simple idk why people are going wild in the comments about it. The beat at 0:00 on the other hand, holy shit I’d kill to listen to a trav song with that beat. That shit better be on utopia.

No these niggaz did not make this banger in the telle? Yo and this shit came out banging! I love the behind the scenes of a song. Makes you respect the art more. I don’t listen to either of them separate much. BUT they just have a dope vibe together that connects. Respect to both these nights man this shit go. I appreciate how they remade this shit. That just goes to show you they know their hip hop. Some of the youth respect the music that came before them. Good shit!
Everytime I see thug outside a song, he's always looking at something on a laptop while standing
I love Travis Scott Im a big fan of him

Question: "What are the essentials of the gospel message?"  Answer: The word gospel means “good news,” which is the message of forgiveness for sin through the atoning work of Jesus Christ. It is essentially God’s rescue plan of redemption for those who will trust in His divine Son in order to be reconciled to a just and holy God. The essential content of this saving message is clearly laid out for us in the Bible.  In the apostle Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, he lays out the content of the gospel message, “Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:1–4).  In this passage, we see three essential elements of the gospel message. First, the phrase “died for our sins” is very important. As Romans 3:23 tells us, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” The reality of sin needs to be acknowledged by all who approach the throne of God for salvation. A sinner must acknowledge the hopelessness of his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take place, and he must understand that the “wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). Without this foundational truth, no gospel presentation is complete.  Second, the person and work of Christ are indispensable components of the gospel. Jesus is both God (Colossians 2:9) and man (John 1:14). Jesus lived the sinless life that we could never live (1 Peter 2:22), and, because of that, He is the only one who could die a substitutionary death for the sinner. Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice. Therefore, either man, who is finite, must pay the penalty for an infinite length of time in hell, or the infinite Christ must pay for it once. Jesus went to the cross to pay the debt we owe to God for our sin, and those who are covered by His sacrifice will inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king (John 1:12).  Third, the resurrection of Christ is an essential element of the gospel. The resurrection is the proof of the power of God. Only He who created life can resurrect it after death, only He can reverse the hideousness that is death itself, and only He can remove the sting that is death and the victory that is the grave’s (1 Corinthians 15:54–55). Further, unlike all other religions, Christianity alone possesses a Founder who transcends death and who promises that His followers will do the same. All other religions were founded by men and prophets whose end was the grave.  Finally, Christ offers His salvation as a free gift (Romans 5:15; 6:23), that can only be received by faith, apart from any works or merit on our part (Ephesians 2:8–9). As the apostle Paul tells us, the gospel is “the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile” (Romans 1:16). The same inspired author tells us, “If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).  These, then, are the essential elements of the gospel: the sin of all men, the death of Christ on the cross to pay for those sins, the resurrection of Christ to provide life everlasting for those who follow Him, and the offer of the free gift of salvation to all.
They wonder how their music leaks when they got all those people around

Force travis ✊🏼
Hopefully them beats in the beginning make it on to utopia
that beat at 0:00 sounds like the song " The London"idk maybe its just me
When trav starts adjusting his hat he turns into cactus slatt
dang that earrape tho
0:04 I hope this becomes a song👀
The crazy song
Why has no one listened to this track yet: SAAZ - Naughty Girl. I have never heard this new sound. all the more so he writes the text, mixes and makes the master himself.  I'm sure we'll see it in the top of the charts soon. let's support him!!!
travis on Ableton?

travis heard mia's vox in the studio and was like  yea this is trash drop it
reminds me of the scene from hustle and flow

this like jesus and moses coming together to split the red sea im proud
Not one face mask in the room🤣
1:42 utopia tracklist

They should have wrote her verse. The paper planes song was fore tho 👌
Lets grow together : Comment who need subscribe and we help each other
The first bit was harddd
travis i love you but please don't smoke
Which DAW is he using? Looks like FL.. but I know he hates it.
2nd beat hard
La escucho y sigo moviendo la cabeza 🕺
Blonde Hair Thugger is back!!!!!!!!!!!
What I really wanna see are those vocal preset and amp settings he blurred out
A Like if you like Cactus jack 🤎
0:28  and 1:05 whats on the back of travis' microphone? ive seen a lot of artist with whatever that bulky block is on the back or their mics and i want it!
Its fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Leyenda 💙🌎
Бомба !!!!
The real question is at what point did Travons say he needs MIA on the track!
are anyone else's headphones having a seizure?
0:04 beat though
Young MA fucked the song up
Travis looking like he's living his best life.
Cactus jshlatt*
Headphones blown OFF!! Lol
Admit it we all love when Thug gets real serious leaning over the computer
how hard work looks like
the second beat was so disgustingly fire. whoever made it utilized that 3-6 sample flawlessly
If you look closely to the end of the video is that (Juice WRLD) on the right side next to Young Thug!!!!!!!!!!!
Hype and flame
He run across beats and instead of finding a flow he creat a while song lol travis is a gem brah
2 goats
Stop using drugs , it's bad for your health.
me to
the beat at 0:05 OMFG THAT NEEDS TO DROP
Mesmo que uma pandemia queira me parar, eu continuo avançando..
Why does it sound like thug listening to a reference track🤔
This man does not make his own music lol
This is what I love to see! THE PROCESS OF A MASTER AT WORK!
Like how he blured the bored with his next album
What equipment is they blurring out so much
What a Damn Vibe! I love this song! Love from Brazil!
That distortion is too much :) but i like Cactus. big up from Slovakia.
The second best in the beginning though
He rips off utopia idea from Lil kudi  https://youtu.be/5oJVb6YxWBw
This the new video of him making sky fall with metro booming
Cactus slatt new joint album
How'd they go from this to adding m.i.a on it
Real Travis fans will like this🌵🌵
That 1st beat travis played he needs to hit that
YE YE YEAH
#Redelephant #traviscott 🔥🔥🔥🤯🗣️
> @travisscott.quotes
Travis just rappin off the dome 🔥
this got me hype & its 8 am hahaha
Bro them beginning instrumentals were 🔥
When your smallest video can get 1 million views then you know you made it
phonk
Who else wish Travis was the only one on this song
🖤🔥
I dead forgot travis produced... lolllllll.. Kanye rubbing off on him
I wonder what they blurred out
Young thug at the computer🤣🤣🤣🤣
He don't need no autotune
Wow.
i love these insights. to see all of you vibin and shit. MORE PLEASE ♥
i don't understand the people that disliked this video
How cool is this we get to see the masterminds at work
0:04 🔥
i hope travis make a song with 00:04 beat
Talk to me NICELY
We NEED a collab tape from Travis and Thugger called Cactus Slatt 🔥🔥🔥
raw
M.I.A has left the chat😪
Rollin thru Holly Hedges like..
So he wrote thug verse
I like this version better.
Yo) check out my clip in Scarlxrd's style https://youtu.be/udgbuTdjvW8 Have a nice day🎯👌🏽
jordan pippen anyone?
his speakers spit thicc base
I wonder why they didn't show mia
Seeing this makes me wonder if they are making a ‘Utopia’ documentary
TALK TO ME NICELY 🌵🤎🔥
Oportunidade pra Vocês.. https://www.youtube.com/c/DaFéBeatsInstrumentais01081997
This is INSANE🤤🤤🤤
Lol I love that this is Travis's vibe and that it works kind of does like real trippy s*** that doesn't really make sense but still somehow sounds hot and then everyone flocks to it, it's genius and ITS LIT
0:09
WHATS THE THIRD BEAT!!!!!!
That Playboi Carti flow
FINALLY NO MIA VERSE
Only real fans will notice Thuggers verse sound a bit different than the released version on this... On this one he says "I'm higher than a plane, where the clouds be" instead of "where the Skypes be"; and at the very end he says "talk to me nicely, yee", instead of "Princey in his prime, yee".
0:41 what is the name of the sort of grainy 80's feel style of filter, Travis loves it
So fire but then that other verse messed it up, I get she had songs that slapped before but it didn't fit
AYYYEEEE!!! My two FAVORITE collaborators! I love when they get together, it's always straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is Woody travis scoott is miuic
When travis said "please" i felt that
my chopped and screwed rework was removed from soundcloud for being superior to the original so i uploaded it to my channel for the real screw heads out there 😈😈
I want captions
where's miaaa?
😍😍😍
Is he using protools??
Get MIA off the song Bruh
Rio travis scott

platinum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2IAVEnh8M&feature=push-lbrm&attr_tag=YiYiSQ2YZn5uU7to%3A6
I don’t get it... is this kid friendly now? Computer programming beats??? The futuristic ? I just simply see no song in this it’s more commercial like? It doesn’t even bass out that good at my 🔊 speakers. Sorry, Travis explain 💔
Do you play fortnite?
Only problem is that the song is so bad !
to cook up wit a view like dat
Who came here for the among us reference?

Can’t believe it only took him 30 seconds to make the beat
NEED THE 2ND BEAT ASAP
Who else knew this guy from fortnite👇

SKEPTA'S SOUND!
Where all trying to see MIA thinking her rap was all that
Rest In Peace 😣

Trav and thug had the chance to make the greatest trap album back in 2015 when they were at their best creatively
What happened to cactus jack channel
Ngl that first beat, goes HARD 🔥🔥
That first one though can’t wait 🔥
I hope coryxkenshin will met Travis Scott
I wish it was just Travis and thug take mia off
I really hope we see the second beat again. Was heat

Inspirational ash shit ah WHOLE MOOR💯🔥.
On the 30/06/2020 my younger sister Olebea Sinclair (Crissana) died under tragic circumstances. She was only 28 yrs old leaving 3 kids behind. On that day when I came home and saw her life less body on the ground I started crying and from then on I never stop shedding tears. I lost apart of me and I keep praying and hoping that one day I may find the strength I need to heal the continuous pain am feeling inside daily. I have been doing music over 15 yrs so i did this tribute to her life and memories, this has been the easiest and hardest song I've ever did. Take a few minutes to listen and feel free to leave a comment. THANK YOU!!  Produced by K.M.T/ O.N.P Distributed by hapilos21  https://youtu.be/KJ9w_mSjdDE

Back in 2015 i use to be homeless, sleeping on people floors in sleeping at greyhound stations I use to get kick out by Secturiy, carrying my clothes in a black plastic bag. wearing the same clothes for days going to sleep hungry in tears in my face.   I had no money  I had no car  I had noting   But now I’m doing better I started my own book label to self publish my books, my first book I drop last Halloween 🎃 name is                Green Eyed Monster   It’s on amazon right now, my 2nd book is dropping on my birthday 9/29 my social media is   Instagram - Ivan_romance89 Facebook - Ivan Romance Email - Ivanromance@yahoo.com   The main character of this book name is Eason he is from Jamaica 🇯🇲 he grew up in poverty if you know about Jamaica poverty it’s worst then American poverty   But he wanted more in life, he’s actually is skilled in soccer and his dreams is to go pro in play all over the world.  Doing his Jorney he will meet different women that will enjoy his company, if your into ZANE Books then you will enjoy my book,   I also had the book re- edited, also the main character of this book is   6’4 Dark Skin  Have Green Eyes Long dread locs  220 pounds of muscle   The sex scenes are very detail in the story line is good, here is the link to buy my book off amazon    https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZS8PWZ8/ref=mp_s_a_1_29?keywords=green+eyed+monster&qid=1572524233&s=digital-text&sprefix=Green+Eyed+Mon&sr=1-29   Also I have free short stories posted on my Book page on Facebook here is the link to my book page the stories are posted on the wall.   https://www.facebook.com/lightSkinMonster/   Travis 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
