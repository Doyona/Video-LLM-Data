Listen to Out of Character: http://sprtspod.fox/OOC
The fact that hill now doesn't want to be with the dolphins after the fact that the chiefs went back to back, this aged beautiful for nick not so well for anyone else in the media
Nobody has won the Super Bowl since this moment other than the Chiefs and now there on their way to potentially 3 peat
2 super bowls later  Yeah Nick was right bozos
And it’s 2024 and the Chiefs still haven’t lost a playoff game since
Kansas City got Karlaftis , McDuffie and Leo Chenal and we gave Hill to the AFC EAST, so Miami can beat the brakes off the Bills!
Nick is a time traveler 🧳 minus OBJ and thank God for that one!
Here we are…TWO MORE SB WINS later! 😂
Nick was so on point here, hes like a clairvoyant lol
Good move
Much love Nick
Wrong Stupid
Cowherd never knows what he’s talking about
Look at all the geniuses in these comments 😂 DYNASTY!!!
Never a doubt.
Nick with a classic category 2. Love to see it
Greatest trade in nfl history 😂
Things that don't age well...
Going back and watching these and listening to people sleeping on the Chiefs is funny!
Hey Colin, how do you feel this year?
JuJu was underrated. KC did get better. Love looking back at these clips.
😅😅😅 KC came out smelling like a bouquet of roses!!!! 🏆
This aged well
Nick was right all along a year later. Chiefs still had the 2rd or 3rd best offense in the league and won the Super Bowl without Tyreek Hill. Colin was wrong on the Broncos, and Chargers.
Lots of comments aged like milk here. 💍✌️
Coming back to this segment, Nick sounds like a prophet today 🤣 😂 ❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️💛
who is visiting this after the chiefs just won the Superbowl?
It's a team sport. K.C. doesn't need a  "pay me  or trade me" player.   It worked out well. Mahomes got better and Hill and the Dolphins were 1 done in the postseason.
💀
Big W for Nick
Love coming back to watch this.
I love going  back listening to all them doubting the Chiefs
We won the super bowl lmaooooo
this didn't age well . Colin said there not the best roster even in the west an they are behind the broncos an chargers ?? prolly shouldn't listen to colin next year for his football prediction !
February 2023 Oops
a fun watch 10 months and a SB later
We were supposed to be bad and now look we play the SB today
Coming back to this and realizing how right Nick was here lol
One Super Bowl Later...
I revisited this post just to see how wrong these pundit are.. they never know what they're talking about
This has aged well
Anyone watching after the chiefs got the #1 seed in the AFC?
They just helping the Bengals win Superbowls now cause that's the Bengals only competition
Nick really just doesn’t know anything… I wish I could get millions to talk stupidity
This was the best segment ever of the herd. Pure comedy & passion!
Nick Mahomes is still behind Brady and Rodgers NOW
It hurts the chiefs next season and maybe longer,  Travis deasnt have many seasons left. Buy trading Hill maybe they may go backwards  more than one season.
I just can’t believe Nick Wright genuinely thought the dolphins would trade Waddle there would be no reason to go after Hill if we couldn’t keep Waddle
Ease up on that dynasty talk homie.  3 chips is a dynasty
Why the zack wilson hate bruh....
One SB does not make a dynasty.
Nick Wright will never have robot legs!
Anyone can truly be an analyst nick wirght is so delusional I love it
Why in the world would you think the dolphins give up a first AND waddle for hill? Ridiculous
Nick's hurting he just doesn't want to admit it.
"They might lose Tyreek Hill" ....what a tool
Nick got so much Chiefs Kakk down his throat  the lack of oxygen is affecting his judgment😂😂😂😂👊✌
I've been at Kansas City Chiefs fan for 40 years and this is one of their classic moves shoot themselves in the foot
Although irritating, there is something likable about Nick! It's like you want to give him a slap & a hug at the same time!
Mark this comment Nickie . Chiefs will be lucky to win another SB.  Chiefs have been to 4 AFC Championship games - 1 SB win , and that was with Tyreek. Nickie Mahomes will never be The GOAT.
Y'all really believe that the Chief's will not be good because of hill leaving just wait.
Chiefs aren’t in danger and still the best in the league. Veach knows what he’s doing. 5 picks. Take that all day. Tua can’t get that ball to Hill 65 yards down the field. We all know that.
Hill isn’t the best weapon on that team. Lol.
Break out the abacus🤣🤣 watching nick melt down live on tv has made my week
There are really few guys more ignorant in football than Nick Wright on TV football shows.
Are we just going to ignore them shitting on Valdes Scantling for thirty seconds, ended this man's life on live television
This sucks.
"The Raiders are hoping derek Carr becomes who derek Carr isn't"..... The Qb with the most crunchtime wins and 4th quarter game winning drives since 2012? The man that lead the most dysfunctional franchise in the NFL last season to the playoffs, and was driving down to possibly go to OT with the eventual AFC champions? The Man that broke record with Davante Adams at Fresno state for 2 years?   Nick scared shitless rn/.
Go away Nick Wright!
Big mistake trading Tyreek Hill. We could've gotten at least three or four more seasons out of him. Productive seasons.
These two are so good together.
I’ve never seen a meat rider like this guy
Absolut clown
People acting as if the 29th pick is a high first lol it’s practically 2 seconds with fluff. The dolphins have tyreek locked up for 4 years. If tua does not improve, show me a more appealing destination than Miami for free agents. This is a good move for Miami. They still have two first in 2023 draft. Grier has essentially turned tunsil plus the dolphins 2022 first into waddle, hill, 49ers 2023 first round pick. I’ve given him a fair amount of criticism and deservedly so, but this is a great show of managing a franchise IMO.
The way every team had to double Hill opened up The chiefs offense so much. We're gunna see what Mahomes and Kelce can really do now. I know Mahomes is the man but Kelce might be exposed this year
You have to win more than one Super Bowl to be a dynasty …
This is to funny. 🤣
I should not be this happy about Nick Wright's obvious denial and pain....I wish I were a better person but I'm not....
Nick Wright started saying Mahomes is the goat is he wins the last 2 playoff games, a SB and SB MVP. Lol his NFL takes are as bad as his hair
Chiefs will never see the playoffs again.  I’d have a hard time playing with a high-dollar qb that throws games as Mahomes has done at least twice.
This is the most dangerous thing to do
WHY would KC trade Hill?!?!?!?!!? WTF?!?!?!?!
What an absurd take that Chiefs are behind Broncos because of this? Our other WRs are worse than Hill obviously, but are the Broncos WRs significantly better than ours?  Does he think Russell Wilson is better than Mahomes or something?  Does he think Broncos coach is better than Andy Reid?  Yes, the Chiefs got worse in the moment with this trade, but they have a lot of picks and money to get better before the season starts.  After 6 years in a row, they're the favorite until somebody beats them at least once.
Mark my words it's a done deal for KC.not another Superbowl,maybe a playoff but no more bowls
How weird is this
“He is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, the sheep in his hands. If only you would listen to his voice right now!” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭95:7‬ ‭CEB‬‬.
“Go and learn what this means: I want mercy and not sacrifice. I didn’t come to call righteous people, but sinners.”” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭9:13‬ ‭CEB‬.

Chargers are the best teams in the division now.  Sorry don't see it with the broncos.
Speaking as a nobody how tf is nice wright given a platform he fits right in with all us nobody’s
As a chiefs fan, Nick just becoming completely incoherent is hilarious 😂
Chiefs always beat themselves.
Them eyes look a little misty fam!!! 😂😂😂 <<<<<no pun intended.
Its amazing how wrong Nick can be... Its hope that any of us could be on tv and talk like a fan and make big bucks being wrong..
Two guys one football
nick getting high ...higher ..
Nicks gonna be like i never liked the chiefs i was Always a bills fan or dolphin fan for years
Dolphins give Tua protection and weapons.  Colin's take away:  "Well, they're moving on from Tua next year."     lol you're unreal, bud.
Carr is a top 10 QB.
I like Nick Wright, he’s quick witted. He’s obnoxious sometimes with the delusions of grandeur about Mahomes, but at least he is honest about his fandom for KC.
I think the negative impact will be slightly overblown, but overall I think the Chargers are the class of the division. In fact, I think they might be the best team in LA next year .
Are we sure Nick Wright is really sipping on coffee this morning? Lol he's fired up
A monumental failure by the Chiefs.
Calling the Chiefs a dynasty with only 1 SB is comical
Bros hurt
nick wrights a CLOWN LMAOOOOOOOO
“ mahomes still their “ then why did y’all rule greenbay out when Adams left packers have a better defense and Aaron Rodgers is far better then mahomes
I love watching Nick keep lying to himself year after year 🤣🤣
Had to see it live
It’s Great !!! When Teams make Moves Like This…Why Not Be Competitive With Some Of The BEST TEAMS…Players NOW Are Not Dedicated To Teams/Organizations Like Of OLD…So If The Market Will Pay Me Good*** To Play Somewhere Else…and I Mite Help Them Win A Championship …SO BE IT…
Nick forgot his time in houston Tx when Texas Tec with Patrick couldn’t win a bowl game. We’re about to see the Pat of TX Tec. Go UH Coogs !
Nick is delirious
Nick. Relax. It's ok. First time??
I miss the old days of Stuart Scott and Dan Patrick. These dudes aren't funny, and are extra corny cornballs. A stiff breeze could knock Nick over
alternate title: Chiefs fan overdosing on copium
This dude really called the chiefs the current dynasty 🤣🤣🤣🤣  How do people like him get gigs to be national broadcasters with such clear biased and over rated options and takes
Hahahaha this kills him inside, you can see the head spinning to rationalize this
Too bad kc isn't getting waddle lol
Nick Wright it such a biased clown !!
Hills speed made him great but avg hands and routes. Wasnt a top 5 WR according to PFF in any of his seasons. He was always at the top of the list in drops and led the league last year in int resulting from passes with a 70% catch percentage. Congrats to hill on getting his money and congrats to KC for not overpaying for his speed and getting great compensation. KC has never had the best roster on paper, that has belonged to the Chargers for years now and hows that worked out for them? Nick saying they are better is dumb though, right now they are definitely worse but lets see what they do with the picks and extra 20 mil.
Wait, Did Nick Wrong almost sorta-kinda give the Bills some praise?
The Bills are number 1
Everybody hates Nick Wright
You can't possibly call the chiefs a dynasty without a second ring
Five picks is a TON we will be ok...
Rules to live by. Don’t trust a guy with a pinky ring.
That boy nick tweaked out on live television 😂😂😂😂😂
The Patriots model is Tom Brady makes everything work
But can Tua's arm strength deliver the range or velocity to get the ball to Tyreek or will Tyreek's speed be hindered because of Tua's physical limitations?
I have never seen Nick so flustered.
Jeez way to stay cool under pressure
Chiefs fan here. I don't think Nick, or Chiefs fans in general, are as upset as the world seems to think. Obviously no one is celebrating losing Tyreek, but there IS an undeniable upside to this. Much needed cap space, premium draft picks, and potentially reloading the WR core with multiple weapons for Mahomes, while having the money to add much needed pieces to the defense. Again, this isn't a moment to celebrate, but the vibe in KC is optimistic. Tyreek is 28. Paying him $30m a year would be stupid.
I wish he would've told him they didn't trade him to see his reaction  😄😄😄
DELICIOUS TEARS NICK! DELICIOUS TEARS
Raiders Chargers Chiefs Broncos
Watching Nick panic being on air as the trade becomes official as he has spent the past 3 season telling everyone that the Chiefs are a Dynasty 😂
Lmao, he thought he was getting Waddle in return. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a chiefs fan it sucks to lose tyreek. But he’s almost 30 and we aren’t paying 30mil a year for a wr,sorry. We have Mahomes and Kelce still. Plus 2 1st round picks and 2 2nd round picks and 2 3rd round picks. We’re reloading on the cheap while still having a top 2 QB  top 2 HC and a top 2 TE. Boo hoo.  4 straight AFC Championship games is pretty amazing from a fans point of view. Go Chiefs
Nick Wrong the idiot is so delusional it's embarrassing to the company.  They need to take him off tv.
Colin and Nick are the best 2 personalities on espn. I’d watch these guys every day.
The chiefs need defense thts what they really need
This what happens when u give your qb over 200 mill u can’t pay to keep the weapons u need
Nick with the copium and hopium lol
LMAO.  Nick is delusional!
So much copium from nick lmao
Valdez-scantling is really good. (FANTASY SLEEPER)
Extremely happy as a bills fan. KC downgraded incredibly, and Hill goes to a team with a QB that doesn’t push the ball
Nick Wright before Hill trade:  Chiefs will go undefeated in 2022  Nick Wright after hill trade:  Chiefs will go better than undefeated
If there is someone I hate… it’s nick wright
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nick Wright is a clown
I’m with Colin. This year we’re not going to be as good, but long term this is the right move for the Chiefs.
This is great, I want people to remember this moment when Mahomes wins the division again and give him his credit.
Hopefully this clip will be used to educate children, showing them what it looks like to lie to yourself..
The Chiefs will have the best quarterback in the world for the next 10 years? I can’t believe Buffalo traded Josh Allen
Only the number 1 pick is a big deal.  Established players are more valuable than draft picks.  You just lost the division Mr Wright.  And maybe the playoffs too
Gonna have to disagree with you Nick on the future looking bright. You’re in this position because your QB signed that 45mil a year contract. I’m not saying he doesn’t deserve that money he’s a phenom. But the reason Tyreek is leaving is that he can’t be paid comparable to his peers. KC will have cap limitations because they have one of the most expensive players in league history. It’s interesting how Nick points out the cap limitations with other teams but ignores Mahomes. We’ll see now if Mahomes can make anyone great. There’s no doubting his talent, but so far he’s jumped onto a team with Kelce, Hill and Sammy Watkins, all of whom made Alex smith look like a top tier QB, gave him career numbers and lead the league in passer rating. So we’ll see if he can do it on a budget.
I have the Chiefs missing the playoffs this year.
Has Nick been crying?? Or did he get a shot of mace to the face? Eyes are awfully red and swollen. Just sayin.
Deep down, Nick would still loved to of kept Tyreek
It’s sad how the Dolphins just improved +1000 % and all they want to talk about is the chiefs being the underdogs…. WHAT!!!  Miami has Jaylen Waddle and Tyreek Hill… The media REALLY HATES MIAMI. The true underdogs. Cant wait till September!!!
Great take Nick! Not!
Hot take: Denver is still gonna finish 4th in the division and Raiders find their way into the playoffs
As a bills fan, I’m hoping we get something similar for diggs. No way I’m paying him that.
Wright is a damn homer, Chiefs are going to be mediocre next year, they already don't look as good as they have in the past.  They just keep getting worse.  Now all teams have to do is focus on Kelce.   As a Bronco fan, I have no doubt we will win the division now.
Are we still pretending like Nick's hair is real
nick is freaking out
Stop it nick. This loss changes the dynamics of their entire offense. Devastating loss
"Best Quarterback in the league for the next 10,12, 15 years?" He could end up being right, but Mahomes wasn't even the best quarterback in the league THIS year. Now, he has a worse offense and a worse defense (arguably, I suppose) and is supposed to stay on top? Last year, the Chiefs couldn't win the AFC against a second year QB coming off of an ACL tear. Now they're supposed to remain dominant after losing their best offensive weapon and the Broncos, Chargers, Raiders, Bengals, Browns, Bills, Dolphins, and (arguably) the Colts getting better? Pure delusion lol
What happen to Mahomes catching Brady? Done LOL
It’s going to be harder to run the ball and for receivers to get open without him there. With his motion and ability to take the top off the defense it was such a big factor. Maybe Pat’s brother will dance to distract the defense
Tyreek hill is a shiw off and a diva if he doesnt get the ball he is a cry baby thats why Mahomes and chiefs had a blowout vs cincinati and the forced it in to tyreek hill
Nick crying himself to sleep
Raiders flying under the radar.
Colin says Miami ain't paying tua next year already taking shot .tua may ballout and give a friendly deal
Joy Taylor your a fake dolphins fan don't try jump back on the bandwagon stay ashore we good
Nick knows mahommes will be exposed without hill in that offense.
Nick: I’ve never in my life been hit by a bus Colin: Tyreke has been traded  Nick: Damn, I just got hit by a school bus 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nick Wright is spiraling
Total meltdown Nick wight
He keeps saying dynasty when did 1 super bowl win make you a dynasty oh yeah he's obviously delusional
Look at that nose…
HE DID COMPLIMENT PATRIOTS? AHHAHA totally out of control, NICK WRIGHT HAHAHHA
Colin “I like Tyreek Hill” Cowherd. Burns and Rips Mayfield for being immature but likes  Tyreek Hill who punches and chokes a pregnant woman.
Icing on the cake 😂
Why is the Chiefs beat reporter on FS1 so much.
Yessss GOOOOOD muahahahah, spread out the tallent in the AFC! MUAHAHAHAHA  - A bills fan
GET READY FOR PAIN KC FANS!! YOU'RE NOW 4TH IN THE DIVISION!!
Hill is gonna ba rich but will be irrelevant...
You guys have great balance wish you guys had your own show no fake news here Perth Australia
Love to see it. “Dynasty” with 1 ring😂😂😂😂.
Nick Wrong is so mad lol
him making fun of marquez is gonna bite him when the chiefs sign him lol  Edit : they signed him. Lol
Nicks 5 different reactions had me dying 🤣
I’m not a fan of Nick Wright.  But I appreciate his hustle.
Nick's face at 5:08 that feeling of losing Hill really sinking in!!! 😭🤣🤣🤣
Joy laughing in the background is hilarious.
Smart move by my Chiefs overall
Nick is hurting inside 😂
Colin thinking Tua is going to bust but I'm not so sure about that. Finally has weapons and an improved line
29th and 50th overall picks are decent but nothing phenomenal. Trade makes sense for both teams.
He really thought they was getting Waddle in return 😂
Mahomes might become Aaron Rodgers with great accolades but one ring. I will give them props if they even get out of this division
he was right about one thing, the chiefs got the best QB for over a decade.
Even a homer as deluded as Wright couldn't hide his anxiety here
Jew
Some of you are not getting the sarcasm from nick lol
Nick's trying so hard to spin this I'm dizzy lmao
They were so unprepared for this news
Nick Wright is top in the list delusional fan. LOl
He's about to cry 😂😂😂
The Chief's window is RIGHT NOW.  Why trade Hill?
You thought you were getting wr in return? Haha
They didn't give up waddle.. LOL
Cant wait for the chargers and broncos to clown the chiefs
Wright thought he was gonna get Waddle 😂
Seeing Nick's reaction live just made my day. LFG DNVR
Must have there eye on someone in next month draft !
Nick is so delusional 🤣😂
Nick wright is one of my favorite commentators on first takev
Nick is delusional about the Chiefs man!!!
Nick should be s permanent co host. Give Skip & Shan a run for their money
He is soooooo not fine. Lol
The schadenfreude seeing Nick Wright meltdown is so unbelievably juicy and delicious. Truly, the best form of medicine. Soak it up, Nicky boy.
This is hilarious how shook Nick is!
Nick is pulling his comb over out live on air..
THAT WAS A FAST DYNASTY 🤣🤣🤣
Colin's laugh while Nick pour out his thoughts just makes this more entertaining lol
The players around mahomo is why he seems so good
No jalen waddle 😂😂
This dude is an idiot. He said the Chief’s defense is good??? 27th out of 32 teams last year is pathetic, just like @getnickwright
This is so great I had to watch it a second time! 😂 2 times is not even enough 🤣 Nick Wright is in SHAMBLES 😂
Nick is insufferable. Here’s hoping his new show means he’s replaced on First Things First
Seeing Nick say this is fine is literally the real life equivalent to the dog in the house fire meme
Cow herd is a 🤡
Is it me or is Nick such a whiny lil b&-*!
The best quarterback in thew world is... Aaron rodgers. Stats plus talent. (yes we know about the NFC and playoff chokes)
Nick Wright is delusional
Greatest video ever. Nick crumbling is *chefs kiss*
Nick actively losing his mind and dying inside is just incredible content
I hope the jets play the chiefs and whoop them .
Buffalo is gunna smoke chiefs this yr lol
You can hear the panic in his voice. It’s amazing
The Davante Adams trade destroyed the Chiefs Kingdom before anyone threw pads on. RN4L
Nick has completely lost his mind 😂😂….he so hurt rn
Wtf ...
I'm a Chiefs fan. My expectations are low for this Season. If we do well, then I'll be happy. If we underperform, I won't be surprised 😭
Nick looked like he just showed up for work, got fired on the spot before he could even punch in and acted like it was fine; but went to his car and cried about it. Poor Nick!!
This MF is so delusional that he still thinks that the chiefs are a dynasty still lmfaoooo
Does anyone like Nick Wright?
Now we will see if Patrick Mahomes is a top 3 QB n the league cause to say tyreek didn’t open the field up for kelce and make it easier for Mahomes u kidding yaself but we will see
Nick need to be real with hisself losing tyreek definitely made them 3rd n that division now maybe 4th
Nick Wrong wears a pinky ring, on his pinky toe too, and smokes with a cigarette holder, drinks with his pinky finger extended!
Who TF cares what Nick Wrong has to say!
Chiefs will be ok.
I can’t believe hill is out he will never have a season like he had in kc his number are going to drop big time
My favorite part as a Raider fan, is that trading for Adams and giving him his extension directly had an impact on the Chiefs being unable to afford to keep Hill. Nick has always acted like the Chiefs were going to win the next 10 super bowls, but he's just now entering year 1 of trying to build a super bowl contender while paying your franchise QB 1/7 of the cap. Nick loves his numbers, tell him to look up how many super bowl winners in the past 25 years have won the super bowl while paying their QB that percentage of the cap (then tell him to subtract Brady any years he qualifies because he's the outlier).
Nicks voice turning to a tea kettle was surreal...first things first is must see 📺 in the morning..
Nick got off the camera and started crying 😂😂😂💯🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Nick the man, but he dresses like a used car salesmanship
Nick Wrong never gets it right.
Tom Green must be trippin.....theres no replacing tyreek.
Nick is the jinx to chiefs kingdom get him outta here
Raiders #1 in division this year. Tell me they aren't in a comment down below 👇
Wait till Nick finds out Waddle wasn't part of the deal 🤣
Yoooo this guy been crying fr fr lmaooo
Bravo Nick Wright !
Lmfao love nick having a mental breakdown
Nick the Chiefs suck balls
The moment Colin liked the trade Nick should have known this is a problem.
Yawn..... Enjoy all "the talk" nxt 5 months of off-season.   As Chiefs walk to a 7th straight AFC West Title & 5th AFC Championship game apperance..
Nick is not fine with it
Nick is getting all veiny neck squeak monster over this lol
The Raiders are going to run through the west...
Patrick Mahomes?  26yrs old and still a Chief? (12-5)
They didn't get waddle.... 😂
Childish.
Dolphins gave away to much for a player who doesn't touch the ball on every play.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂!!!!!
Alex Smith had Kelce & Hill 2 seasons.   0 Playoff wins. ....  Mahomes 4 yrs as a starter?   4 straight AFC Championship games hosted / 2 OTs fr making 4 straight Super Bowls!   Lololololol hate break it to y'all KC haters? Yes Hill was fantastic but this success?  PATRICK MAHOMES   (Hill is 30 and Mahomes is 26.....Goodluck on stopping Chiefs fr winning a 7th straight AFC West Title and making a 5th straight AFC Championship game!
Chiefs are over the hill. 😂
Nick Nick Nick. What dynasty?? The Chiefs never were a dynasty. They won one super bowl. This guy is delusional
Nick wright is the worst.
Yesss, squirm nick! Squirmmm!
Tom Green doing a great Nick Wright impression here
A wonky Tom Green
nick dosent believe one thing he said
omg joy honey no
The GB Packers got a 1st(#22) and 2nd(#53) for Devonte Adams, the Chiefs got a 1st(#29) 2nd(#50) TWO fourth round picks plus a 6th. The Chiefs got a lot more for Hill than the Packers did for Adams. I'm good with this trade.   The Chiefs now have money(26M) to go out and pick up a few players, PLUS, the Chiefs have TWELVE picks in this years draft. Two firsts, two seconds, two thirds, two fourths. With those 8 picks, the Chiefs should be able to vastly improve the defense.  And, WHEN the Chiefs restructure Mahomes contract, that's 17M more to spend on FA. Big picture boys, big picture.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 picks don't mean anything if they don't give you equal value or better. Chiefs are a playoff team and that's it. There head coach ego too big and he refuses to run the ball and defense is trash 🗑.
What if they trade kelce as well... Well, nick might commit suicide...😞
He has a son.... poor kid
I swear nick Wright is high 😂
This is like watching a old building implode
Lol poor nick.  The afc championship game loss melted his brain
Hahahaha  Chiefs are finished
Lmfaooooo @ Nick saying “no” at 3:17
Dollar goes further in KC, 😂😂😂there is a good reason for that. And it’s not like OBJ is thinking “man my budget is hurting buying a house in LA”
Goodbye chiefs hello browns!
Nick is going crazy
Nick Wright for POTUS
denver HAHAHAHAHA
Today was just a great day, both Nick and Mark on the same day. 2 Amazing segments, Colin's chemistry w them just hit different
Does anyone remember the cowboys Hershel Walker trade? And what happened ?
Big loss for KC. As good as mahomes is, he will stills need weapons. Pats had the same issue after trading branch to Seahawks. They suffered from not being able to replace that. Brady missed branch in the years following 04-06 till they got moss and Welker and 07.   Bill sucked at drafting wide receivers, if KC doesn't replace him then they're an injury to Kelce away from being not where near the offensive juggernauts they have been in recent years. AFC is stacked and regardless of the picks, KC became worse in a day than other teams even in that division
We kept waddle 💀💀💀
As a Raiders fan, and true Raiders fan from the 80s I still believe Chiefs are first in our division in till we sweep them.  Chiefs  Raiders  Charges  Broncos
All those picks will not even come close to replacing Hill. One pick might be good the others they draft will be a bust. Nick is a bandwagoning blowhard.
The KC fanboy is trying so hard now.
Nick out here trying to make himself feel better 😂
Nick is so annoying
He wants to cry 😂
Thought I was gone have to wait for tomorrow for his reaction this is gold 😂😂
yes I don't know how he did it, but Nick has become one of the most entertaining people in sports
As an avid madden player….Thank god
Jaylen waddle…lol that WOULD of been nice wouldn’t it if nick?  Lol
Nick hates Denver…man does he hate my team.
True enough those last 2 picks aren't worth a huge amount given how unpredictable drafting can be but it's still potentially worth a punt trying them out.  However it's more likely that they'll use those picks in future trades.
Nick why don't you swallow Mahomes for breakfast you worm🧐
if the Dolphins were only offering #29 and a 2nd... that must mean that the Jets were only offering two 2nd round picks and no 1st round picks.
This trade probably ends Mahomes shot in the G.O.A.T debate.
Please keep this in mind at the end of the cheifs will always be in tension to get the superbowl or be in The AFC championship games they proven that already for the past 5 year even tho they downgraded they can still get key pieces in free agent and through drafts moving Forward don’t be surprise even if the chiefs downgraded if they go the AFC championship again
As a bills fan I'd actually be more nervous of Baker with Mia vs Tua. Tua isn't special but at least baker has had success in the NFL
Of course Nick will say he’s fine with it. What else is he supposed to say. Lol
Chiefs won't make the playoffs this year.
As a Vikings fan this is reminiscent of the Herschel walker trade
Nick is about to overdose on Copium. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
nick is a loud mouth joke.
I wanna see Nick Wrong cry.
Breaking News! Seattle acquired Baker Mayfield and 2 first round picks in exchange for a half eaten ham sandwich.. (cheese was not included)
Lol ok nick , rams just traded Krupp but they will be ok. 😂😃
Hes panicking cause KC hasn't done anything this off season
DOLPHINS TO THE SUPERBOWL
The chiefs are toast !!!!
Has Nick been watching too much Jeff Goldblum? 😂
Nick so delusional thinking my Phins would trade Waddle😭
Defense are figuring out Homes game big wideouts the answer with a better safety  core
MEGA COPE
F them picks
Colin has been pumping the Donkeys for years..Says they are good and got all this talent but yet STILL SUCK.
So glad Buccaneers beat the Chiefs in the super bowl and watching Nick cry the next day
Nick wanted to cry eyes watery and all😂
Damn shame Dolphins got rid of Flores right when he could've had a Tyreek 🤬
It's so weird that EVERY team in the AFC West took strives to get better in the off-season and KC has gotten worse.
Last name Wright but rarely is. Lol
This guy lol just cuz we traded hill we ain’t the best ? This guy is dumb
💀💀💀😭😭😭😭
This will expose Mahomes
Nick loves his Chiefs. Let's see how PM does with new tools.
“I think they might have gotten better” 😂
Nick was on point about dolphins giving up a lot to get him
Always wonder led who nick wright reminded me of! Kinda new to watching him so I’m sure it’s been said, but he’s the nerdy boss guy from grandmas boy😂😂😅
10 years but he might just end like Aaron Rodgers.. Most talented QB but only with one ring
Lol Nick is so butthurt 😂😂😂
LOL nick was close to tearing up
I really liked Hill but not for 4 year/$120 million.  This was not a short term move, but it was the right move.
Nick is absolutely delusional and in denial.
Lol Didn’t get the trade he wanted…
Best part about the Chargers is they didn’t even go all in, they lost a 2nd the whole time and still have cap room
this is what every fan of a team does when their team makes a questionable move
Nick is the Sole reason I love the Chiefs losing.
Now Colin and Nick are all about picks. Lmaooooo.
We all just witnessed Nick going through the 5 stages of grief.  I felt this way after Khalil Mack was dealt to Chicago.  Everyone has elevated Denver to the top?  😂  Keep selling my Raiders short...again.
I was kidding about this last week and now it's a legit take. Can the Chiefs come in the last in the division?.
Wish him the best in Miami after 6 Seasons at Kansas City
Raiders, Chargers and Broncos all make the playoffs and Chiefs miss.
4th/6th Rd picks arentvery useful. Bit dolphins will miss their 1st Rd pick, could've used it on their flimsy O Line.
I get it on paper. But tyreek is the most dangerous weapon in the NFL
theyre actually a really funny combo
Nick Wright is 100% correct get out early and have the best QB... But a big NO to Odell
What if the chiefs sign Julio , AB or Odell 👀
Zzzzzzzz!!!!
Crazy off season so far. Buccaneers got to get back and win the SB.
Why does Nick Wright get so much attention.  His takes are bad and his voice is annoying.
This is why Nick is on TV. Stole Bayless and SAS playbook. Be a hype man for massive biases and go crazy for insane takes.
KC messed up big time
Knock ✊ knock
Nick had a mental  breakdown  on live TV
I like Nick, he's a fan who just happens to be on TV
Doubtful that KC will ever get back to the SB. The competition is way higher.
Nick is the best!
KC will be fine.
This could be a very interesting season
Tyrek is a big loss but the Chiefs do draft well, this may help the Chiefs long term.
Without Tyreek the chiefs are already +14.00 in the bet lines
my boy nick started sweating😂😂
LOL NICK 🤣
He's delirious, you gotta get him to a hospital, he's gone into shock
Even Nick is laughing when he said they widened the gap over the Bills 😂
Nock head gonna pop off
Haha collins Laugh though 😂😂😂😭😭
Mahomes the best QB in the world? Really?? Top five for sure, but the best?
With all these teams trading first round picks, there’s gonna be like 10 teams that have all the first round picks
I'm a huge chiefs fan and Nick gots me believing we may be better lol 😂
This is what I’ve been saying too. Mahommes walked into the league with the best pass catching duo in the league by a mile. His contract was going to cost him dearly within a few years and this is going to be the start of Mahommes becoming a very good but down to earth player. No more 480 yard 6 touchdown games. Without hill there won’t be anymore explosive quarters. I don’t expect Mahommes to become average, he’s still great. But all qbs at some point have to do it with less than stellar talent and most don’t live up to it
Lol I almost bought that nick is ok
Best Nick wright video ever
Stupid. Hill was awesome
Dolphins still have two 1sts… it was a good trade for them
they did get 5 picks, which they need and they had to move Tyrek hill because of the salary cap and they can draft WR in the draft, sure Hill unique but they would probably lose him eventually and get nothing for him they get something.
Nicks favorite team is done
We know it was business it wasn’t personal, otherwise you would have retired here, Go secure bag 💰💰💰Bro, Which u and your family much deserve!!! I ain’t mad at you, Everyone from Kansas City & Chiefs Nation Thanks You!! And regardless whatever team you play for your a Chief for life!!! God Bless you and your family and may you continue to  prosper!!
SHOCK WAVES .... THRU OUT KANSAS CITY!!!!!
Nick Wight wasn’t the person for this interview.Have fun with pick 29 and 50
Looks horrible
They don't have a burner in the passing game and they don't have a thumper in the backfield.  The Chiefs are NOT more dangerous than they were before. The pressure is on the scouts to make these draft picks work.. M
Colin “he can do the jet sweeps, he can do the bubble screens” Cowherd. smh he’s a lot more than that
Why does Nick's nose look different??
no team from the AFC Weat will be in the Super Bowl
Nick Wright, you are so disillusioned. Trading Tyreek Hill will hurt the Chiefs on the field this season but you can build for the future. Give more respect to the Bengals, Bills etc...
Nick is freaking out and it's hilarious
These guys perspectives are way off. They're still riding the Chiefs. They cant see what's real or what? ...These guys get paid to talk sports and they don't know what they are really talking about....Chiefs handled this situation BAD... it's all bad for them ....big mistake big loss....
Oh Nick Wrong got his feelings hurt!!!!!
5 picks for a receiver is a excellent but for a cheetah 🐆🐆 you lost the trade Big Time. Chiefs lost the division with this trade.
Chiefs are taking a big risk on this draft coming up because what if the five picks they got for him turn out to be melons…
Nick is on a roll, saying Michael Jordan is not athletic and now the Chiefs are better without Tyreek lol.
Ask the Seahawks if they like being in the receiving end of a Jets trade
I love nick but that's hilarious that he thought the chiefs would get waddle. That's just goofy lmfaoo
Pinche nick is like the kid whistling in the graveyard trying to convince himself that all is right with the world 😂.
Nick Wright is one of the best entertainers in sports, hold onto him Fox
This was so satisfying HAHA
MVS actually is really underrated.  people just dump on him because they want to make excuses for rodgers.  he's a 6'5" tyreek just without amazing hands but he can catch.
I’ve been waiting for this day for a while . This clown is delusional and desperate
Nick: "I'm just ready to go here" You got that right. Right to the rubber room, baby.
According to everyone but true Chiefs fans. The Chiefs are over and everyone else is better. The Chiefs are about to do what all the other teams have done. Build a team with younger better talent. What will be the excuse if the Chiefs beat you and you spent all your money trying to beat them SMH
Copium at it's finest..
I'll be the first to say I have the Chiefs missing the playoffs next year at 9-8.
Nick Wright, who I usually enjoy, literally embarassing himself in real time. What a petulant child trying to ignore the fact that the best receiver in football just got traded, and acting like it’s nothing. Put some respect on the people in Miami who worked hard to make this happen, you don’t even mention them? Horrific, biased journalism from someone who I usually enjoy watching…no more.
The KC ride is just about over
Wright is this close to a 15th floor ledge.
I am astonished by this.. Are you kidding! Tyreek makes this team go. If you think Nick is having a meltdown, wait till you see what Patrick Mahomes does. This *&^%$ up the season for KC. WOW, Cleveland upgrades. The Ravens upgrade. The Chargers upgrade. Look what Denver and Vegas did. Have the Chiefs given up? Poor Nick. HID anything sharp. Nick is on suicide watch.
Joy Taylor Laughed Loud at that Joke 😂
This is gold
People get traded everyday B
The real loser of this deal is Hill
Hater Wright, KC worst
😂
Sorry tyreek hill is a huge loss forget everything else the chiefs have won so many close games against the chargers alone because of hill punt return tds so many more the AFC west should be excited.
He looks more and more heartbroken as it goes on lmaooo
Lol nick
It’s all Buffalo now in the AFC.
Dude lost his mind if he thought waddle was gonna be a part of that deal😂
Nick is like the annoying kid ,we used to say shut up!🤣🤣🤣
Strange man that Nick.
Do ur homework homie..Patrick Mahomes numbers in the 4 games without Hill? 378 yards passing per game..11 TD's and 109 paper rating
Nick's grief is real
whaaaattt?????😮😮😮
Lmao that is one of the largest doses of copium I've ever seen
Tyrann was right chiefs fans are mad toxic they tryna convince themselves tyreek aint good im praying for y’all 😂😂
They got a haul of picks for one player chiefs are reloading and will be far more scarier
Nick couldn’t wait to go home and cry in bed.
D's have worked out how to dull Hill. Waste of money
I love Nick Wright.  Always entertaining
Lol. Mahomes isn't special. Hill stretched defenses and was the best player on the team, followed by Kelce. Juju and the rest of them are basically possession receivers. Hardeman is OK, but is nowhere near as fast as Hill.
Reid knows what he is doing.  He has something up his sleeve, he always does.
Dude's pathetic. The division is wide open. Either of those teams could win the division now.
This was fantastic😂😂
The 2 deep safeties were killing Mahomes and this offense. Now teams have no idea what to prepare for
That Nick energy from the past two years has quickly shifted for his beloved dynasty 🤷🏾‍♂️
I’m been a chiefs fan since beginning of my life this is not a problem speed don’t last it is what it is
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Nick is a Fool😂😂😂😂
Boy!!! Was Nick singing a lullaby or what!!! Man..well ya do what a need to do, to go to sleep at night!!!
We will absolutely stink ! Get out of KC Veach Reid, and the owner go too
These two are clearly great friends
Chiefs front office thought players would be willing to discount their services to play with Mahomes, like a ‘Mahomes discount’. This proves that thesis so wrong.
Please let Travis be traded
Worst trade in NFL history, we absolutely won't win 8 games! Sad day in chiefs history
I love it when Nick tries to convince herself
@getnickWright - You'll love this stat - Mahomes WITHOUT Tyreek (5 games in their career) Patrick has a passer rating of 102 with 1700 yards, 18 Tds, and 1 int... again, WITHOUT Tyreek...Chiefs will be just fine with 6 picks in the first 3 rounds
I hate Nick wright
Randy Moss was trash in Oakland before he was traded.
best QB in the world? HAHAHAHAHHAH
Nick went through it
As a chiefs fan….watching Nick loss his mind is hilarious
Nick wright is such a dam joke.
Nick Wright is wrecked right now Lmao. I feel for you brodie
Bro just watching the literal LIFE leave Nick Wrights face after the trade happened, and than watching him ramble like a mad man may be the best thing I watch on TV for the rest of the month
Chiefs and dolphins took a big L the way I see it
Hahahaha this is what you get draggin my giants to sign baker, nick! Tyreek went for money to play with tua, is he outta his mind!? 😂😂😂
WTH wrong with the camera man….Put JOY BACK ON THE SCREEN🗣🗣
Miami has no QB, but he can run reverses all day
Every team outside the raiders in the division have had the better overall roster the last 5 plus years lol. They just choke
The best thing about Hill being gone is that it does make KC the underdog and I like that.
Dunno who this Nick person is, but he should be bawling his eyes out.
By October...Nick will be on suicide watch
I've never seen Colin laugh that hard hahaha
Probably my favorite Nick Wright take ever.
OBJ needs to be somewhere hot. Cold weather not good for bad muscles and joints
Mahomes never wins a sb with the chiefs again.......Tom green is a 🤡
I would love to run into Colin and Nick and have a drink with them. They're cool asf
Nick can retire and burn his custom chief's color blazer.
A whole lotta pressure on tua
Nick you don't seem fine... Sorry brother I get it I live in independence and drive by the stadiums to work everyday
You can slow the video down and see the precise moment where his heart breaks into two
I don’t know who is more annoying to listen to. Skip Bayless when he talks about The cowboys and Tom Brady or when Nick write talks about his man crush every day LeBron James and the chiefs. Lol
The chiefs defense also got worse
Look Mahomes is great but his greatness has been propped up by Kelce, Hill, and Andy Reid. Without either of those pieces he doesn’t have the success he had. We’ll now get to a better glimpse into who Mahomes really is without Hill being 10 yards open from any defender or taking a 5 yard pass 40 yards down field. The good news for them is this is the fastest average WR class maybe ever.
Nick seems to believe K.C. is a dynasty.  They're not. When you lose a player like Hill,  it is hard to replace him. The Chiefs will be 2nd tier next year,  Mahomes notwithstanding.
LOL, not getting Waddle dumby.
nick def doesnt even believe his own words. this trade is killin him
Cheifs so overrated
Nick is hurt right now 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
The trade is understandable. Chiefs couldn’t afford 30mil. But that trade package SUCKS!
2 picks in each of the first four rounds ... I'm excited about that. Sky Moore and George Pickens .. physical receivers with strong hands. Grab some DBs, a coverage linebacker, a developmental RT to make up for losing Niang to injury. A more physical Chiefs team. LFG
Kansas city is a dump
Watching Nick react to the Raiders destroying the Chiefs is going to be soooooo satisfying
Dumbest move ever keep hill at whatever cost in my opinion
Nick over here sounding like Ross on Friends when Ross found out Rachel was dating someone else- "i'm fine, I'm fine"
Dissed my Jets hard 😂😂😂
Denial is an early stage of mourning. Poor Nick Wright probably on suicide watch.
Chiefs had to play a 4 game stretch when Hill was injured. Chiefs went 3-1 and Mahomes threw for almost 1,400 yards including a 500 yd game and two 300+ games and 11 TDs. Hill was second in the AFC in dropped balls last season including several that led directly to Interceptions. The Chiefs got FIVE picks for a receiver who's almost 30. Gonna be fun watching these fans faces when the Chiefs going 13-4 this season... gonna be like...  wha...wha... happened? Chiefs supposed to be bad this year. 😅🤣 Sad so many posting don't actually watch or follow football to know Andy Reid and the Chiefs GM Veach don't do anything without a plan. They know who they want in the draft.
Andy Reid is a genius
There is going to be 4 really good teams not make playoffs in AFC next season
Tom Green rocks
You’re secondary is suspect and you’re receiving core. The idiocy of this man blows my mind. And pat finished 10th this year among qbs and Kelce is a free agent next year idiot pay attention
Raiders… winning 🏆
Dude really thought he was getting Waddle 😂 🤣
Best qb.. i beg to differ.. Burrow beat him 2 times last year... without the talent
My man Nick Wright will not be coming in to work on 3/24 !!!
Nick Wright is the best. His weekly segments with Colin are incredible.
Nick , Nick , Nick - talk fast , take the role of a whinny foil to Colin , it pays so ? But dude if you want to be Colin you must have something sometime worth value
This was my favorite segment I've ever seen between them outside of their candid talks on The Volume because this was genuine reactions from both of them on air -- Nick having to defend his team while Colin splits his sides laughing at his misfortune. Love it lol
The queefs are done for
Nick Wright tears 😢 😭
So great! Without hill defenses can play without committing a double coverage every play and force mahomes to play from the pocket and mahomes is bad from the pocket.  Chiefs D is still going to suck and get even worse. Andy is an offensive coach, in nfl coaching standards he has no idea how to play defense or prepare a defense week to week. Lol so great!
Nick Wright gonna cry in the car.
Odell Beckham should go to Green Bay
I hope the chiefs go 0-17 next year just to shut nick up. Go raiders
He really is shimp from  the  three stooges
Nick is shook.
Not crazy to think the chiefs could end up 3rd or even 4th in the division. Not only did the other teams all get a lot better. Now the chiefs got considerably worse. This could negatively effect Kelce, Mahomes, and Smith-Schuster. Tyreek made all those jobs easier.
New dynasty? Nick is so delusional lol
Bih said 18 years Mahomes doesn’t have anymore weapons once to double Travis lol it’s over that defense sucks as well
Watching Nick Wright crumble on live television in real time is incredible
I can’t wait for tomorrow show to her wilds and Chris lol
Denver has Talent nothing special,  SD  KC OAK  Denver
the dynasty that never was will never be.
Nick is sad boy lol
Who else thinks Nick Wright is tipsy?? He looks lit and its funny.
Chiefs not making the playoffs 100%
"Chiefs Dynasty" 🤣  IMO there have been 4 dynasties since the 70s;  Pittsburgh in the 70s, Niners in the 80s, Cowboys in the 90s and the Patriots which lasted for 2 decades.   Don't get me wrong, the Chiefs are dominant.  But can we not agree that a team needs to WIN at least 2 Superbowls (IMO 3) before throwing  the term dynasty around?  If you only have 1 Superbowl (ahem, Chiefs), you're no different than the Nick Foles Eagles, Joe Flacco Ravens, Drew Brees Saints, or any team that has only won one.  One is not a dynasty.    People talked about the Seahawks having a dynasty prematurely.  What happened?  They won one and lost won--no Superbowl appearances since.  That's where the Chiefs are at now.  Now they COULD become a dynasty, but that remains to be seen.    And they just lost Hill and Honey Badger.  Kelce is 32.  And the AFC just got really stout.  Sorry Chiefs fans, the odds of it aren't good.
NFL PRO-TIP:🏈 Just 3 words for the CHIEFS.  No Super Bowl
I wonder if Nick believes a single word he said this segment.
I wonder if Nick believes a single word he said this segment.
I hate nick wright
What are the odds of watching Nick Wright, The Numero Uno Chiefs fan, on his weekly "The Herd" visit and Nick's Chiefs trade Tyreek Hill while he is live on National TV. Probably 100-1. I think it was a smart move for The Chiefs. I think Andy Reid will find a good WR in the draft for a whole lot cheaper.
Nick is broken
mahomes fanboy is upset 🤣🤣🥴
Jets not giving up ish
Yeah, Nick just entered therapy this afternoon...I am in line right behind him...sigh...    Go Chiefs...ugh
The chiefs don't have a ton of needs... WHAT?? THEIR ENTIRE DEFENSE IS MADE OF PAPER
Mmmmm yummy nick Wright tears
Cowherd I just unsubscribed, u AH.
😂 Go Broncos
Is this trying to be a comedy show, because it certainly isn't a serious sports show.  Either way it's a fail.  Why would any show have that thing nick on?
God dang it, Nick......I don't want to hate on Mahomes but its gonna be tough without Tyreek.
Nick Wrong: "Thats OK, we gotta be frugal!"  Chiefs: "Hey Mahomes, here's $500 mill!" 💰 🤑 💸 💲
Why everybody keep forgetting about mecole hardman nick said all they got is juju , scantling and a rookie nah u forgot hardman
Mecole Hardman stock shot up ☝ 🚀 🔥
Farms for all that bs he been talking
Mahomes isn't even the best QB in the division. lol.
This dude's so so so delusional. Like, it's a bit right?
Wait... the chiefs get waddle??? No waddle and tyreek???
I’m confused. Haven’t listened to Nick since fantasy football days and he was the big time Browns fan. Is he no longer? Is he a chiefs fan somehow now?
Damn this guy is annoying!  Not because he’s a chief fan, well that too, but he is hard to listen to.
Looked like Nick was crying just before logging on to his zoom call
Seeing him heart broken brings me joy.  U can see the tears in his eyes
Nick is the most annoying caster of all time. It's funny how worked up he is, you can hear it in his voice 🤣
Phins #2 seed in the AFC East?
1:39 Nick has been on the receiving end since Brady announced last week that he's coming back.
He said MVS is underrated😂😂😂😂
As crazy as it sounds I do think the chiefs will end up becoming a better team from this. They have 3 picks out of the first 50 in the draft they are definitely going to get a couple if not three great players because of this.
Collin is the WORST
Tyreek one of a kind and the badger will be missed but but paying like 5 people qb money limits the depth and our wr core past tyreek has suffered and that was evident. Chiefs draft well nowadays they'll be able to supplement. Live long and prosper tyreek ✌❤
Nick wright = Tom Green with a broadcast journalism degree
Deviated septum should stop snorting bias
Nick lol 😂
What happened to 7 rings 🤣🤣🤣
How's that $500 mil contract working for the Chiefs?
Nick hurt 😂😂
Nick knows tyreek saved Mahomes. How many times did Mahomes just randomly throw the ball and tyreek went and got it? Mahomes can’t play with normal receivers
Love to see Nick thinking the dolphins would give up Jaylen Waddle 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
- so Nick, what's your reaction to the Chiefs loosing TH?  - yeah well the Jets and the Dolphins suck
I like Nick but he gets the most butthurt about the chiefs
You’re whole division gets a lot better and you trade your best receiver? Make it make sense
The new dynasty 🤔🤔😂🤣 the chiefs win 1 Ring like 3 years ago that it. I don't think chiefs win another Super Bowl the AFC is loaded
Annnd Mahomes will now slowly start to have to actually struggle for a change. Mahomes will struggle harder and harder as reality sets in. Slowly but surely pieces taken away. Oh nick still showing effects of LeFraud never gonna be the GOAT syndrome
So let me get this straight Nick, getting Devonte freakin’ Adams is NOT going to make Derek Carr a better QB?  Right…
I love how Nick thinks his chiefs have been doing this for decades it’s been 4 years buddy, before Pat the chiefs were pathetic
Nick really thought they was getting jaylen waddle😭😭
Nick Wright, ooh man 😂🤣
nicks live reaction. goated. this needs to be the headline lol nice interview
Keep in mind tho the chiefs hired Matt Nagy as their QB coach so expect to see a version of Patrick Mahomes that can easily overcome the loss of Hill
Don't get me wrong, I love tyreek hill. But 5 picks with Brett veach is great (we had 3 of our draft picks become probowlers including the 6th rounder Trey Smith). Save 20mil on the cap and don't have to pay a WR 30 mil a year. Thanks for the ring cheetah. Good luck in Miami ✌🏾
I’ve never liked nick so having him go nuts it’s priceless
Is the character Nick Wright is playing supposed to be like le or purposefully annoyong?
Nick Wrong somewhere crying.
Nick looks like he’s been crying. That, or he’s high lol
How can give up on a guy named the Cheetah? Chiefs have no WR now, JuJu is a bum
Colin knows nothing
Nick Wright now looks like a worse off Howard Ratner in uncut gems 😂
Colin has a nice laugh
Dang! Tyreek is a game changer... He's worth it
Chiefs definitely the worst in the division on paper 🤷🏻‍♂️
Was anyone talking about Hill before Mahomes?
Underated part of this segment was nick casually calling joy out in the middle of it
Hill won't be the threat he was in KC. He's got the athletic skills but you have to take into account the coaching and quarterback not to mention TE and other WR's that keep defenses honest. Now teams will simply double team Hill or play a high low scheme. I don't blame Hill for going to Miami for the money but I think we're going to see many Hill tantrums on the field when his production drops.
Expect Kupp to be next
Lol Nick gets to deal with Jackson and juju tiktoks all year now
Has teh chiefs already lost Tyreek hill?
Nick doesn't want to admit it,  but he's scared.  He sounds scared on his reaction 😂
Overrall the AFC West now will be   1. Broncos 2. Chargers 3. Chargers 4. Raiders
I like Nick Wright, but as a sports analyst/journalist, I don’t like he acts like basic adolescent, moronic fan. He acts like he’s part of the chiefs and he has nothing to do with them.  Brothers gotta be more professional and objective.
i’m convinced nick was tipsy during this😂
Ravens still going 16-0 colin?
Nick is on suicide watch 😭😭😂😂😂
I think all hope is not lost for Kansas City. They still have Mahomes, and Kelce. Andy Reid is a creative mastermind, and they got plenty of draft capital from that trade. I feel like Jameson Williams is drop to them at the end of the 1st Round. If they get him they have "The Cheetah 2.0"
Lol, I think Wildes is going to have a field day with Wrights feelings tomorrow.
Nick wright is Foxs Stephen A Smith 😂😂😂
In all this excitement, I forgot about the Nick Wright crying bonus. You go from fanboy to Baghdad Bob if you claim you like losing Tyreek Hill.
I keep waiting for someone to tell Nick he is a tool
We need to see nick Wright take the other spot on First take
I wouldn't bank my entire future on the draft. You could draft quarterbacks defensive backs lineman and miss on all of them. They just traded away a sure thing that they had who was a perfect fit for their quarterback for hope cuz that's what draft picks are. You could show franchises year after year missing the draft picking players and never getting better. Kansas City is hoping that Patrick Mahomes can turn any player into something special that doesn't always work
Nick is officially the best sports ‘analyst’ to root against now, replacing Skippy. “They might have gotten better…” delusional but entertaining!
Nick gone cry in the car
wow
Nick is such a repulsive disgusting person.  He's totally delusional by trying to put a spin on this. Chiefs are worse now than when the season ended  and Nobody improved more than the Denver Broncos! That's a fact. The overrated Chiefs have won 1 Superbowl in over 50 years!!! Big Deal! They're not a Dynasty and will never be a Dynasty. Broncos own the AFC West now.
If KC paid Hill 30 million a year, then they would become the Packers. One great receiver and no one else. It’s not a recipe for SBs
Cry Nick....CRY!!! 😂😂😂
That’s it….Chiefs won’t make another SB.
Broncos are better than the chiefs
NICK, JUST TAKE THE L ON THIS ONE BRUH
The Chiefs have McColl, Josh, Powell, Jo Jo, Fountains, and new WRs. The Chiefs need defense. Short and Medium range passes will be used.
They aren't replacing that production or just the fear and respect of him being on the field. Nick Wright is delusional
Damn Nick you hit that pipe hard before coming into the show.
Nick is on suicide watch
Nick going to the bar after this
Is Nick high or is he about to cry lol? One of the two.
I'm glad the Jets didn't make the trade,but nick is in denial
Chiefs got fleeced
Nick hilarious 😂Colin, handling it well 🏈
I'm not worried. . . He's  worried!! Haha
THIS DUDE IS CRYING LMAOOO
Dude always hating on my Broncos hopefully we can rebound to shut him up.
Why didn’t they show Nick’s face when Colin broke the news
These 2 are so fun to listen to.
Chiefs are trading six-time Pro-Bowl WR Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for five draft picks: a 2022 1st-round pick (No. 29), a 2nd-round pick (No. 50) and a 4th-round pick, as well as 4th- and 6th-round picks in the 2023 draft, sources tell ESPN
Nick is fooling no one but himself.  A bird in the hand, and a lightning fast one at that, is worth 5 in the bush.
I hate this guy
My boy Nick wright hit a line n got on air . Tru professional 😭
The Chiefs should have kept B, Pringle as another very good WR.
They didn’t trade Jaylen lmaooo
That Christian Kirk deal did all of this!
Joy is looking absolutely beautiful today!
I don't like Chiefs but I like Nick he very comedian
nick thought he was getting jaylen waddel 😭
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again…Nick Wright is a tool. 🔧
nick : THE CHIEFS ARE BETTER WITHOUT TYREEK
nick sounded like colin did in the past 5 years. leave receivers, it’s just the icing  on the cake
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again…Nick Wright is a tool. 🔧
Colin is wayyyy too enamoured with Wilson. He's not on Mahomes/Allen/Burrow level. He's just not.
Hilarious! You can hear after the fiscally sound talk Joy dying in the background .
You don't find Tyreek Hill's speed every day of the week. In fact, you might find it maybe once every 5 years. This isn't a case of KC staying "ahead of the curve" and being smart about their future. I know that KC offense. Mahomes depends on Hill. That play in the last Bills game where Hill took a 10 yard in route and blew past Buffalo's defense 80 yards to the house doesn't get made by Hardmon, Waddle or any other WR that KC might get with all the picks they got for Hill. This was a bad move by KC. I'm not sure if KC will be able to use the same offense they have been using now that Hill is gone. That could be trouble for Mahomes
Dudes stressin big time. No need to fake it
God Nick just got that more annoying.
Now you will see the real Mahomes when Tyreke leaves... Mahomes is a FRAUD
I would’ve rather traded with the jets yeah you would’ve had a better deal but not no first 😂🤣
Hair really makes a difference!! Nick went from looking bullish with low haircut to kinda handsome wt the long hair!!
Wow, chiefs don’t want to win anymore?
He thought the chiefs are where getting jalen waddle or any of the jets top 10 picks 😂 this dude lost his mine you could’ve got those seconds tho
Lmao look at Nick by the end. We officially saw Nick Wright meltdown 😂
The copium and s real
Massive overpay by the dolphins, cheifs made a good move for the longevity of their dynasty. Plus this years draft is completely loaded with WR's
Lol this guy was melting down in real time. This is was delicious to watch
Chiefs have a grand total of...wait for it...one (1) single SB victory under Andy Reid. they're losing stars/key role players, while others will be a year older and more injured at start of next season. Their division has quickly morphed into the consensus best 4-team grouping in football. amid all of this, Nick Wrong persists in calling KC "the new dynasty"
It made sense to not pay $30 million  to a WR whose production depends on speed. When Hill loses a step, he will be an overpaid 5'9" receiver.
BASEMENT!!!
Miami will now have Hill, Waddle, Wilson (from Dallas), Gesicki and RB Edmonds on top of other personnel.  Good luck covering that.  Tua really won't have any excuses for underperforming now.  He's got a goldmine of weapons.
The Chiefs are winning.....nothing...this year.
This is wild nick looks like he just saw the girl he asked out she said no and the next day you see her laughing and giggling with another guy 🤣
All I can say is what will Cooper Kupp going to get he had 1800 yards this year. He had the best numbers this year and Superbowll MVP. offensive player of the year.
Nick can’t even talk, I’m loving it 😂😂😂 Let’s Go Buffalo 🦬
Nick , Hey you only lost the dude who beat his pregnant girlfriend.   Won't mahomes talent still shine through?
Nick said something very smart. If everyone is going all in, some of those people are going to be disappointed. Very true.
Nick, is absolutely out of his mind. I like Colin because he knows stupid when he hears it. Raiders have the best offense in the AFC West (Maybe the NFL.)
very irritating voice
DENVER WTF come on collin youre better then that
Kanas City is reloading the stable, watch out. Zoom zoom
This dude is so goofy
Nick having a meltdown
Getting Nick to react to all of this live is the best things that could’ve been on TV today. Pure gold.
I saw a different look in mahomes’ eyes this past year, they aren’t feared anymore.
Nick is the funniest guy in the business
He called it nervous I was, I was, just got beat my Burrell Nick who is up and coming. Still a clown
Nick looked like he’s about to cry 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The amount of copium from this video is legendary
Nick is Waaaaaaaaay too optimistic after Hill leaving. He’s sweating 😓 like crazy on the inside 😂
The Dolphins never would've traded Waddle
Lol all the chiefs fan like well we got some picks it's gonna be alright. Right? 🤣🤣
This dude was in complete denial lmaoo
Lol. Nick Wright thinking that Adams won't make Carr better. He was in the MVP conversation at the beginning of the year until Ruggs was gone. He had no legitimate deep threat and Waller was injured for several weeks but he still managed to get over 4800 yards. Now that he has a deep threat, Waller and Renfrow have more room to work in the middle.
i knew we weren't going to be able to hold onto Tyreek. because he was always going to ask for Highest Paid Reciever money. i love him but we werent going to be able to afford to keep him.
So patty homie is going too they are married
Had the chiefs third in their division before this. Now it's definite. 3rd in their division.
Ju ju is average. Hill was way better. Steeler fan
Who is Nick lying to?...Us or Himself?🤔
But, but what will Mahomes do without Kelce left, Tyreek right in the last 2 minutes of EVERY close game 😆 🤣 😂
The chiefs are finished. The chargers will easily win the afc west.
Nick in da nile.
If Nick Wright wasn’t completely biased and insane about Chiefs I might take him serious on any analysis. No idea why he’s on this show.
Personally as a Charger Life Long Fan, I think this is a GREAT A++++ move for the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs ad underdogs are scary af, plus in the draft there is multiple WR with 4.3 speed you can replace him with that second round pick and then get more depth for the offensive line it’s a great trade and I don’t see the Chiefs not winning the Division.  1 Chiefs 2 Chargers 3 Broncos
Just behind Denver while ignoring the Chargers its takes like that, that led me to only watch the clips nick is on
Lol and then they didn't get Waddle out of it all
Colin just laughing is the best part lol
Honestly getting a 1st and 2nd for a wr...thats a great trade plus u don't have to pay that amount for a wr that isn't a good route runner. Im sure they gonna find a guy in this draft
The dolphins almost beat the chiefs when they came to miami.. with the chiefs at full power. Tua atlt qb. In fact I remember. The chiefs going for it on 4th down to not give the ball back to tua  cause he was COOKING THEM.  Nick doesn't watch tua
This is just phenomenal 😂😂😂😂😂
What about  the Browns Owner messing up the Market . Talk about  that
Nick has to be the biggest loser in sports media
And as of now…. Tyreek Hill’s career is over. Imagine going from Mahomes to Tua 😂
Just cry already lol
4:33 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let me get this straight, they re-signed Frank Clark who sucks but get rid of Tyrann Matthieu and Tyreek Hill.  Sounds a little self-destructive... and oh boy, a 1st round (29th pick) and a 2nd round (50th pick) and some change.  He was worth 2 early firsts and a good second at least.  This is arguably the best current WR in football.           !?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!
The fact the dolphins were able to keep both first round picks in 2023 draft by only given up one first in 2022 draft is where I like this trade for the dolphins
That FREAK NICK WRIGHTS SHITTING HIMSELF THEY'LL NEVER REPLACE HIM IN THE DRAFT
Oh by the way Nick they still  got waddle. He is not the best we see he.look ordinary  when everything  is not perfect  around  him.
NICK WRIGHT is RIGHT... Called it all season last year and the years before Real deal here.   GO CHIEFS
This is amazing LOL   As a Chiefs fan, watching Nick basically react the same way is hilarious. Nick the era is over LOL
And we kept Waddle 😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐬⬆️💚🧡🐬⬆️💚🧡
Nick knows  the chiefs  going down bad even their  fans know it . Stop it Nick your embarrassing  yourself.
T hill is not replaceable, his speed was one of kind. As a raider fan, I'm happy he is gone.
colin is right about the broncos being the best team
Nick is BIG MAD!! 🤣🤣
Chiefs are done Pinocchio
Love you Nick Wright
5 question marks or the most dangerous ...PROVEN....weapon in the NFL??? Um... I will take Hill...KC has the worst roster in the West....... KC doesn't have needs? Um... Defense....
The NFL had figured out the Mahomes/Kelce /Hill triad. When the Chiefs gifted Patrick HALF A BILLION, I knew it would take some moves to pay for it. The Chiefs couldn’t win the Super Bowl or the last AFC Championship game WITH HILL, so many holes will be filled with new draft picks. Nonetheless, Thank You 🙏🏼 for everything #10!
Wow nick Wright is delusional.
Nick going to cry as soon as this shuts off
When Collin gets excited his voice goes crazy high. Lol
ha I love it, told everyone chiefs are done, have been, they aren't even top 3 team in afc anymore, meanwhile brady is still better
I think Tyreek was a key piece to Kansas City's offense. It will hurt there offense, Hill was a Beast!! Now they got a haul in picks. We will see who they get in the draft. Miami gave up WAY to much for a Receiver!! Miami is all in on there QB!!
It was truly entertaining to see Nick Wright go through the 5 Stages of Grief from losing Tyreek.  1. Denial - "I thought he was kidding..." 2. Anger - "I didn't love that..." 3. Bargaining - "Jets, Dolphins..." 4. Depression - "Underdog Chiefs..." 5. Acceptance - "I feel great about the Chiefs..."
The Dolphins gave up the 29th pick to get the Chiefs best player. The "Dynasty and GOAT" losing makes this great. How quickly their fanbase became so toxic turned a feel good team into toxic waste.
Lmao....horrible compensation. All those picks suck. Lol!!!!
Climate crisis > football gossip
This man is on the verge of tears talkin bout "I'm alright with it" 😂😂😂.
Both of y’all please keep this same energy about my Raiders
meltdown Nick
Fins Up!! LFG! #10
LOVE NW!!!
The dolphins haven’t had this much coverage since Marino damn lol
Nicks eyes got watery lmao
Nick is so delusional. Mahommes will be exposed. Giving the ball to tyreke hill for ten yards and him taking it sixty isn’t happening anymore. His gaudy stats are gone.
Then nick cries off air.
Reid coaches for 3 years tops, Mahomes has issues deep in playoffs now, Kelce is Old, Odell is NOT healthy Wright is very very wrong. I DO like his take on chiefs buying low selling high like new England
Nicks red teary eyes, mans obviously been crying
Hello 4th
Nicks Tiers turning into Nick's Tears
Wow the chiefs must not want to win stupid trade
Did this clown just say the dolphins would give up Waddle lmfao!!!
chiefs will draft jameson williams who will step right in and replace hill.
love this duo
Chiefs are done. Let's see what Mahomes do without Cheetah ✌🏾
Wake us Chiefs fans when Mahomes wants a trade. Say goodbye to Tyreke ever sniffing the playoffs, much less a Super Bowl with the Fins. He will have an extra month to count all that money in South Beach after the last regular season game has been played for Miami.
Why was the camera only on Colin when he was breaking the news to nick? Great camera work guys
Well, no more Super Bowl rings for Mahomes. Oh well. He got his one.
KC doesn't have Recievers... Kelce is best up and slow..  NOT A HATER.
Its interesting to see how nick is in for all in, in the NBA but against it in the NFL
Nick wants to cry and I love it, dude was tearing up 🤣🤣🤣
This is Great! Nick Wright finding out live and having to react 🤣 🍿  Tyrese said ✌🏼
Tough look when they get the Dolphins 3rd best first rounder ..
Mahomes still thinks that's his baby..... that's your qb bro. Cmon man
Kelce isn't going anywhere....he's older than Gronk.
LOL they didnt give up Waddle, lol.
Nick is honestly so good at television at this point I’m not gonna argue w a word he says
lol this guy is funny. Like another Tom Greene..
Colin does not like the Chargers
Chiefs are the worst team in the division now  At least the worst offence
why is nick even an analyst... he's clearly incapable of being logical and removing his bias
Dolphins gave up too much and they're over-paying.    Do you really believe in Tua that much?
How does he feel now that barely any of the picks were worth anything lol
It's over for the chiefs nick we saw how Patrick Mahomes played with Hill injured
LIFETIME CHIEFS FAN IVE BEEN SAYING TYREEK WAS GONE ALL OFFSEASON
Patriots plan Buy low Sell high Cheat always
At the 3:18 mark, Nick Wright soul just left his soul... And I love it 🤡
Raiders taking the AFC West!!!! lol
KC might not make the playoffs. I think tyreek is that good & that important too that team.
Chiefs & Andy Reid have worked with less in the past like the 2015 season with Alex smith didn’t really no WR fr had some average Rb’s they started 2-5 finish 11-5 made the playoffs as wildcard lost in the division round basically I’m saying I wouldn’t count them alway out plus still got the draft   Still can make some trades
Does Colin understand Waddle is under contract for 4 more years?
So funny seeing the trade compensation after and seeing only picks, and dolphins at 29th pick lol
Nick is annoying
You can hear the desperation in his voice.  Knowing that his boyfriend Mahomes can only win with talent around him. That's why he got dismantled against Brady in the Superbowl.  Cause the talent around him flopped. His favorite player is slowly going to ruin his team dollar by dollar.
The Dolphins still have 2 first rounders next year btw 😂😂. I dont think they have a problem giving up those picks for a Hall of fame receiver when they still have a pair of first rounders next year
"MVS is underrated" that part was too funny
Another WR going for amazing weather instead of money
How are we still ranking chargers over Raiders when we beat them in the clutch the chips online smh
No way Nick thought they were getting Waddle in that trade
This is great to watch Nick's breaking down!
I told you so!
You guys are so fing high. Mahomes won’t be near as good as he is with hill. Denial denial denial. Raiders Broncos Chargers are all better now.
they got a bunch of needs on defense. like the whole secondary lmaooooo
3:04 looooooooooooool the high pitch
Nick comment about Zach wilson was legit and that was not that bad either way
I love watching Nick go backwards on everything he "knows" about sports.
I think the Chiefs will be just fine. Knowing Brett Veach, he will make a few more solid moves with the $34m in cap space they get from Tyreek and Honey badgers departure. Plus the draft capitol they have is top tier
Nobody likes this Nick dude he's a crybaby
Poor nick is losing his mind 😂 he's trying so hard to not be worried.
"I'm fine with it" Nick says  But his face is saying a completely different story.
They'll be fourth by the end of the season Nick 😂
Omfg Nick is unbelievably insufferable.. get over yourself the Chiefs just took a significant step backwards
Yooo Colin never laugh this hard thank you Nick
Hill by himself was responsible for a bunch of wins against the Broncos!  The AFC west is officially up for grabs!!!!
Hill better get used to losing.
Tyreek's already got his Superbowl & now he's got his K'changalang. Next!
That guy is delusional, the Kansas City queefs suck and that nick guy sucks too
😂
Good thing that Nick Wrght's career isn't based on him being right.  Denver and Oakland are going to be extremely competetive.  Tyreek Hill in a league of  fast runners can still run by everyone,  that's special.  Between his horrible tone deaf comments about Lebron being the GOAT and everything else somebody is looking out for Nick Wright.
No Chargers! No Raiders! Broncos Over Rated!! Nuff Said!!
But the upside is the Chiefs can use their $30 Million in cap space and picks to build up their defense and get some more receivers
Omg this is greatest segment ever watching nick explode into a million pieces knowing his chiefs are DONE!!!!!
WhoOt?
This is a huge shock and devastating loss. The Patriots way works but not when the AFC loading up like they are. But the upside is the Chiefs can use their $30 Million in cap space and picks to build up their defense and get some more receivers
Reminds me of the Hershel Walker deal and recently Ricky Williams... some favors are being paid back with these stupid deals
So according to Colin, the Chiefs can “just draft 2 receivers”  But, the Packers are “DONE FOR”. Make it make sense Colin
You mad bruh LMAO 🤣
You can tell he's dying in the inside
Nick seems like a duck on water
Tyreke will not do anything in Miami.  Mahomes will be fine.
Waddle? LOLOL. How you likin' it now, Nick?
Are Nick Wright and Skip Bayless related to each other?
They didn’t get Waddle I’m sorry Nick lol
Olave will fall to the Chiefs
Oh he gonna cry in the car
Nick Wrong trying to keep the game face on......the break up of Hill and Mahommes just opens the door even further for the bills
If you have never seen the 7 stages of grief, this is it!!!
This dude thought we was giving up waddle and a 1st and a second!!! 😂😂
🤣🤣
Nick is delusional lol
The Faster Nick talks. The more he is worrying😂
Nick wrong!!!! Queeefs nation💨💨💨💨
Nick must not have heard that Brady isnt retired anymore
Colin u seriously need to stop bringing this nutcase on the show it massively hurts the credibility of the show. He had bad takes on all sports, I would much rather hear Joys take in things
PM=Overrated
.Nicks lit 🔥  up Kansas will be lucky  to make the playoffs.
Lmao nicks eyes tells you the whole story, he is petrified. He knows the "we chasing 6" dynasty is not happening 😂
Nick doing his best whistling past the grave yard act
He thought they were getting waddle 😂
Aha.. Nick thought they were getting waddle in KC 🥴🥴🥴🤣🤣🤣
This was beautiful to get his live reaction. Super shocker trade for KC
Wait until Nick has to react to Miami giving up pennies for cheetah 🤣
Nick right of course being his usual delusional self
What was Nicks reaction when we didn’t give him Waddle and they only got picks.
KC is at best 3rd
Dynasty ..... DENIED
See over there? Yeah, that's how far he pushed the goalpost
cannot wait to come back to this video in like October/November
He gonna be mad when he finds out chiefs got robbed
Nick just mad tho, might be the 4th best team in that division over the next two years
When you give one player 12% of the payroll
THIS WAS GREAT
I'm okay with it one moment later......oh my goodness 🤣
Nicks talkin in circles 😂 😂
The laughter from joy in the background @5:50
Chiefs really let TY leave?
4:28
The Chiefs still have a better roster than the Broncos and maybe even the Raiders.  If they can draft some impact players for their defense, then they will still make the playoffs next season.
Well they didn’t give away a early first at all and they still have waddle
Nick Wright is currently sweating bullets... Tyreek Hill leaving KC means the AFC West will have a new king next season.
6:03 Party-with-Joy-Taylor-order-champagne what now???
Sorry Nick , they got the 29th pick, and no Waddle
I’m a Chiefs fan and Nick is delusional lmao Bad trade but we didn’t really have a choice
KC won't be the same team but they still on top of that division lol
Nick has been on the copium ever since Russ went to Denver
Jets and dolphins are desperate, they payout more than they should
Nick could be Cowherds child.
As a raiders fan, we’ve got the best offense in the division
Seeing Nick Wright lose his mind, and sarcastically be optimistic about the Chiefs trading Tyreek Hill is the best thing I have seen in 5 years from him since I started watching FS1 in 2017 lol....priceless...
hilarious
Beckham would go new orleans before KC. The first round pick is san fran's pick they traded
This man thought he was gonna get waddle 🤣
Well you didn’t get picks AND Jalen waddle lol
This is a classic
Long term this is a great trade but short term not so much because now Mahomes will have to build a rapport with the young guys
This is why uncle Colin doesn't have a debate show. All good arguments thrown back in his face.
He wants to cry
If you have to do mental gymnastics to make you feel better Nick its not a good move! KC about to be Cellar Dwellers
NICK WILL NEVER SHOW IT HE IS LOWKEY HURT, HILL WAS A CHEATCODE FOR THAT KC OFFENSIE
This has probably been one of my favorite segments to date😂
Dude really thought he was getting Waddle and only gets a bunch of late picks🤣 L trade
Loved to see how Nick would Cope with this lmao.
This is what happens when you max out the QB. You have to move on from from really nice pierces.
Damn nick is hurting
Colin does have a point. They wont extend tua. They can bring in an elite qb next year. They still have 2 first round picks next year
oh I can't wait to hear nick🤣🤦🏿‍♂️
Chiefs won this trade.  Reid is savvy and can win with Stinkston & Trash.  Chiefs are still the best  team in the division.
nick huffing mad copium lmfao
RIP Super Bowl for Chiefs
Of course Collin finds a way to twist the situation and throw a dig at tua
Chiefs are now 2nd in the division. The entire chiefs offense was BASED on Tyreek taking the top off. So idk where they go now.
Nick is in shambles
It is so much fun when Nick gets mad! 😅👍
Funny thing is I have to deal with Nick Wrights bias opinion but my twin brother is the same exact way lmao it's like a mirror man tbh lmao funny af 😂😂😂
if you just keep looking at nick's eyes it looks watery like he's about to cry which is very funnyAHAHAHAHHA
Seeing a man suffer on the inside in live time
Chiefs don't only need more defense. They need better O-Lineman or Mahomes is going have another year of running around like a chicken with his head cut off. Piling in more receivers is not the biggest need.
So much Chiefs hate in these comments, see y'all at the top of the AFC west this fall!!
So this is what watching someone having a nervous breakdown looks like 🤣
Nick crying his self to sleep if they trade Hill
I understand what nick is saying who tf is going to pass it to tyreek 😂😂
They're done. Tyreek was the X factor...
I love Nick Wright, as a Chiefs fan like him, he at least make my mood a little bit better. IMO, Chiefs should have negotiate for more picks though
Nick must’ve forgot how the Jets swindled 2 first round picks from the Seahawks for Jamal Adams. And how the jets were about to trade only a 2nd and 3rd for Tyreek. Jets aren’t the same old Jets, they would’ve fleeced the Chiefs.
Nick is hurt. Lmao...
Nick definitely crying 😭
Nick is in denial
This is going to be like in Tennessee with Marcus Mariota and Ryan Tannehill, and we know how that went with them 2 🏟🧸👀🤷🏽‍♂️💯💯🐬🆙️
I agree Nick
Tua is like Adam Sandler character Bobby Boucher, from the movie The Waterboy, minus the talent 🤭😁🤣🤣
You just gave carr a actual WR other than Renfro
The chiefs know the have no chance in the division this year with the chargers and Denver taking 1st and 2nd place.  I had the chiefs 3rd but they will be last this year after the trade
I love seeing Nick Wrong seethe. Chiefs done and Bron ain't seeing another chip, I'm blessed.
Ayo I felt like I could hear Nick holding back tears 😂😂
The Raiders are now favorites to win the AFC West
Nick wrong in shambles 😂
Waddle wasn’t part of this deal DA
This is kind of funny, watching Nick being nervous about tyreek leaving.
Hate this geek Nick Wright
He thought they would get Jalen Waddle back?? Lmao
Kansas city chiefs still Afc west favorites for now
Nick Wright has officially lost it😂 😂
So amazing this happened during this segment.
Kansas city chiefs get dolphins picks replace Tyreek hill in upcoming draft and other picks get to good defensive players
This is what I been waiting for nick’s reaction to his invincible chiefs!!😭😂😂😂
Poor nick.  Mental Breakdown occurring Like watching someone lose a family member at Christmas! He unveiled his tiers.    Now he’s in tears
Great trade for the chiefs.
Nick Wright is shambles rn
Bills better
Lmaoooooo🤣🤣🤣
