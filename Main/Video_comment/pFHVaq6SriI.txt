I remember watching these vlogs everyday 5 years ago after work. Now I’m a YouTuber, I’m coming back now though
Love the clogs being back...   But What happened to the U.S. syndicate original website. It says that it gotten taken down?
Another sick vlog, never failed to make me smile over the years. Also, this whole video needs to be on the out of context Syndicate Twitter lol!
Love the wind breaker! Missed your face!
Tom you have no idea how happy it makes me to see Karl and other friends in your vlogs. It really feels like what I have been waiting to happen for the zombies community on YT. Keep up the awesome vlogs.
Nice to see the vlogs are back 😎
Oh how I missed the vlogs I was just telling my friend about how I missed the vids hope your back for good
Looks like some one got enough memes
Literally went here the other day, small world
I could be so wrong but is Tom hinting at Alice having a baby
Karl is a legend
Glad to see you all back can I ask about how your grandad is ? Loving your new vlogs hope to see you back in uppermill now we are free to roam ,,xx
Holy shit, what I'd do to have been there with you lot.. I'm fucking laughing in silence trying not to wake anyone up!

Glad your back mate. Missed this.. But how the.... Are you going to remember an Epipen when you lose your golf ball instantly?! 5:10 Killed me the moment realization hits and stops all train of thought..
Missed this so much ! Laughed all the way through. Alice and Carl made such a good appearance and always have !
Not liking the new iPhone's mic on those being filmed. Seems really quiet.
The putter flip was absolute poggers

The production value in the South Park transition 😂
I literally spat my angel delight everywhere at that comment
The people watching Karl in the background is so funny 😆 what a goob
Tom do u think u would go daily again with the vlogs ?
Tiny fact my dad is the assistant manager of the American golf next to this
Mini-golf reminds me of vacations with my family.
Just think; us 'merican's are gonna be able to do this in another 3 -months- years, at this rate.
0:14 But then, everything changed when the 'Rona nation attacked!
We havnt came back out of lockdown idiot, I swear people think that u kinda people just gonna make us go back in
Loved it guys - thanks for the video.
I love way out videos and streams it helped me get through when my step dad had cancer keep up the great work
i went here and nearly passed out because of that stupid stench also mini golf is deadly
Omg Tom I've missed this, so hilarious and takes my mind off of life! You're brilliant Tommy Boi!
God I have missed Carl he's so funny
That’s Lewis Hamilton dig was saucy 👀😂
Finaly Tom is back 😛🥰🥰🥰 love the vlogs and the family 👪❤
I have missed you & Karl so bad the last year. It's so good to have you back vlogging, literally the content doesn't even matter at this point! Laughed the entire video.
HAHAHAH THE KIDS IN THE BACKGROUND AS KARL DID THAT HAHAHAH 7:52
Fucking loved this one
Only elite F1 meme from Karl there 😂😂😂
Glad I wasn’t the only one who laughed at the dinosaur fanny when I went
I needed these back in my life!
THAT'S YOUR SISTER TOM!!!!!! xD
3:50 that scream had me in stitches😂😂😂😂
Imagine going to Dino Golf Manchester and seeing Tom film someone "golf clubbing" a dinosaur ahahahah
Yay we can be Epi-pen buddies 😁😂
Was is just me who noticed Tom say '2,3,1' at 8:05
You had me laughing throughout the entire video 😂 How i've missed this!
Wellcone back to daily vlogs fringers crossed
9:17 the putter just defying laws of physics for a second
DO MORE CAR VIDEOS!! GTR
I’ve missed these so much man
Tom you're worse than my brother whenever he plays Crazy Golf... and he cheats by literally chucking the ball across the fucking course hahaha
Not sure if it's a stupid question or not but are Karl and Alice dating?, or are they just friends.
Wasn’t expecting the South Park transition
The 66 dislikes are related to them dinosaurs
Not only is tom back but Karl's legendary laugh is back defo missed the banter between you guys 👌
This haircut ages Tom so much 😂
Warms my heart to see this! 🥰. HAPPY TO SEE YOU VLOGGING AGAIN! Been watching you since  BO1 days.
love the south park lmaoo
It’s good to have it back
Orion smashed it he editing again
man it nice to see homie back to the vlogs
Why does toms South Park character look like guenther Steiner
One of the most enjoyable youtube videos I have watched in a while so funny
THE MACK IS BACK
Tom & Karl Together is just gold. So glad these are back smashing it again Tom
That walk after the hole in one sent me into orbit, I had to rewatch it and all the air left my lungs and I sounded like a kettle. Missed you!
Well Tom my country back in lockdown
You don’t realise how much you miss something until it’s back! Damnn I’ve missed the vlogs and the positive energy! The best youtuber
i was literally at the driving range. heart broken
I need explosionssss !!!
Tom and Karl consumed a few pints together in probably months and there are already fisting dinosaurs. 🙈😂  This gonna be chaos (in a good way) when the whole crew is together in the pub. It's great to see you back Tom! 🤙
Another great vlog. Always look forward to seeing them
happy to see the vids coming back
Thank you for not being that guy. I legit had the why is your nose not covered thought then you commented on it.
Didn’t realise how much I’d missed the vlogs until they started to appear again. Just something about them that distracts me from my day to day thoughts and I have to say thankyou for that :)
Good to have Karl back! He’s been missed
so good having you back!
love the vid Tom, glad to see the vlogs back g much love from salford LH
Fricking love this vlog as always! 💛
okay i didn’t know how much i missed karl, his laugh is the best! 😹
He looks like idubbz with that hat on
I am not going to lie last time i watched tom was when he had hair like ninjas(who copied him tbh) and may i say hes still quite striking!!!
I’ve missed so many giveaways just cause I don’t have Twitter 💀
I think this confirms Alice was never actually his sister but instead his neighbor who he’s been dating for years
4 years... time flies 😱
12:18 man i’m in bits
Will be rewatching this one!!
My mum says that we should go to that Dino golf place every single time we drive past but we never go lmao
Great video Tom, glad to see you enjoying yourself again - too many people in the comments hating the good vibes
Kallllllllll
Omg I love rudding park spa when did you go last time !!!
The lads are back! This just made my day! Also everyone hit that 👍 🍻🍻
So glad to be watching you guys again. Tom and Karl are like dumb and dumber 😂 poor Alice.
Good see  you back vloging Tom keep up the awesome vlog
I've never been there but even I missed The good ol' Grapes
Oh my gosh I couldn’t stop laughing you guys are awesome I’ve missed the content
“They said sorry and gave me a bag” Wish I could say I was in that situation :(
Bro I’m happy now
The ease on lockdown is temporary... Trust me they will lock it all down again soon. The tyranny will be even more intensive. This isn't about a virus its about global Communism.
I wasn’t even there and I had fun thanks Tom 😂
It’s Kaaaaaaarrrrrrl 🙌🏽
Ohh have i missed this 😁
i've missed this
The hardest I’ve laugh in a couple of months and I have missed you Tom
💯👊🏻
Yeeeaaaah Tom join the freedom states of the USA 😎
I couldn't breath with that alabama moment😂😂
Watching Tom on YouTube makes lockdown so much easier thanks Tom 👏
I like ur cut g
Tomass
Love it! Everyone back in full style!! Aaaaw love the Doxie She is so pretty and looks like my Bella!!
Hi have both of my vaccines I had one and two of my cOVID-19 vaccine so go get yours now that you have your EpiPen I have mine you should be caring yours I carry mine everywhere cause I’m Allergic to wasp 🐝 and many other things mainly wasps🐝
8:48 how many times did he say nine 😭😂
I just got done watching South Park and was super thrown off by the South Park animation lol for a minute I thought I was still watching South Park
That’s not exactly how epinephrine works but I only know because of medical school lol. Your description made me chuckle. Nice to see the vlogs back Tom!
Comedy gold 😂😂😂
These videos definitely make my day cheers Tom for making videos again
Laughed all the way through but Twiggy stole the show! So glad you all enjoyed some normality!!
Tom go snowboarding in the chill factore. Nice bit of fun there.
This vlog was so funny, you 3 are great together
Bet and if, Orion loved editing this
Hole in 1or ummm 2 holes in 1!!!!👍
my god i've missed these, they make my day
I took my little lad to this mini golf place last week, good to get out doing normal things again. Great vlog 👍
That fucking volcano though
“Hole in one in her” lmaoooooo
I’m so happy there back oh my dayssssss
I’ve missed this xD
What camera you using Tom? Soooo good to have the blogs back. It’s a new dawn, it’s a new day.
SWEET HOME ALABAMA

LIFE OF KARL

9:17 golf club stood up on its own, good to see you back out and about :)
6:33 I felt that haha. Can’t wait to have the normal vlogs back with the legend. Too funny
Was Orion on furlough? 😂
This brought a happy tear to my eye! It is soo good to see iconic duo back together again! I've missed you guys 😁
Oh how ive missed that banger of an outrow song 😍

Oh my gosh I was crying the whole way through this!🤣🤣
Chill factor is better!!
darude sandstorm
That’s next to Chille factor right? So happy I got a heart on the last video!!!
Awesome to see!
You should probably get a couple more Epi-Pens, Tom. My sister used to only carry one with her wherever she went and the ONE time she needed it, she left it in the glove box of the car. Better to have extra and not have to worry about leaving the only one you have somewhere
The fking Southpark part hahaha I'm dying
12:03 toms had a stinker
I have missed these vlogs! Felt strange not logging in daily to watch this
Absolute comedy!
This truly truly changed my day around, yeah I was enjoying the last few vlogs with Alice but seeing all the old faces just cheered me up so much, I cant even imagine how Tom feels! On cloud 9 I'd say! In Ireland we still can't do anything but essential shopping so its nice to live vicariously through people in England having some fun :) Thanks for the vlog tom x
Laughed a lot at all the innuendos! Excellent video 😊 thanks for making me smile!
Karl is baaaaack baby

The king has returned
9:15 we jus gonna ignore the fact that the golf club almost stood up?
ahhh the merc then the sound effects came in lol
As someone who watched Tom attack a wasp nest in LA, I’m so fucking glad this muppet has an EpiPen 😂
I think I was more impressed with the gold club standing up for as long as it did after Toms hole in one than the actual hole in one
OMG dog has gotten so big
Damnnn that southpark car ride got me good!
i dont think im gonna leave the house yet, went to the shops and so many people are out,  just anxiety and anxiety
i really missed these vlogs. Thanks for starting up again
There is something about the vlogs that make us all warm and fuzzy inside so glad they are back. ( that sounded better in my head )

“Get it Out” What does Karl do? Go for the flying lesson. Right, own up, who kidnapped the Southpark animator?
