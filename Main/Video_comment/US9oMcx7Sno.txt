Γιάννης;ης;the most criminally underated player ive ever seen before in ΝΒΑ and thats because they want to leave Μιλγουόκι
dashie sucks
franz sucks
shai ight
kelel ware sucks
Notice how @0:22 he gets back on defense so fast after just scoring that he almost beats the camera
1:45 years he walked
Myles is Giannis' mistress 😅😅
Oso kaliteros ginese toso xeirotera ginode ta adelfia sou
jesus how many free throws did he do in this match
Exactly one year and still full steam ahead. Giannis is something else.
Not a Giannis hater but geez so many free throws and they kept him in being up 20+ halfway through the 4th.
it feels like he is travelling every time
I’ve never seen someone get to the rim like this man
if the bucks can’t beat the east go to the spurs
which shoes is he wearing chat
The final dunk at the end was so epic even the PA announcer was hyped 🥳
They say the most NBA players could give you 50 any night but giannis will give you 60 and it’ll be the easiest thing you’ve ever seen.
This game will always be remembered when players almost fight because of the game ball. Bucks want the ball of Giannis career high, while Pacers want the ball because an unknown rookie scored his first point.
His strength is insane. Bully Ball!!!!
Imagine giannis..ad....wemby... same roster 😂🏆🏆🏆
What could’ve been 🥹
Game 6 hope he comes back.
I was at this one live

Good job King
Giannis drops 64, Embiid gets mad with that, drops 70p. Luka tells them "Hold my beer" drops 73!!! What's going on with them?  Everybody got crazy?!!!!!! We witness greatness!!!
Giannis is Great but whatever happened to Traveling Call in the NBA???
The greak freak bro the mvp is giannis I love giannis really much because he is  the best dunker and defender
That  Women Voice Sound horrible
yeah he just cheats by travelling though
81>64
‏‪1:47‬‏ יאנייס פשוט מטורף ❤
Must have passport at all times
So what  it still 64 points
Dude shot like 30 free throws 😂 that's ridiculous smh way too many free throw attempts smh
Why shooting 3's when you can Dominate the paint 👌💪
Give that ball to GIANNIS
He has no moves. Its all dunks.
If he develops a consistent shot, it’s over
Bucks need better commentators, these guys are so boring
He gets so far in 2 steps you'll think he traveled 🤣 I stayed pausing the video the man got spider legs man!
Bro making money for lil bro
THE GREEK FREAK 🔥🔥🔥🏀🏀🏀🏀
crazy guy! 64 points!
Shaquille O'Neal, Karl Malone and Michael Jordan were tied for the most points in a game with exactly 0 three-point attempts, with 61 points.
Γιάννης θα λέτε και θα κλαίτε
The first clip was a travel😭
good game by giannis but lol so many uncalled travels
In the NBA and FIBA, when a player has taken more than two steps without the ball being dribbled, a traveling violation is called. this is directly in the rules 1:25 for the next two plays Giannis does exactly this, so are the refs not familiar with the rule book or are they picking favorite's?
Big woop. People forget Kobe and wilt
Why is it historic???
so many uncalled travels omg
pathetic
Look at the final score, this is why today’s basketball sucks. All offense, barely any defense
Show class and take him out the game
poor Turner
This is all Giannis. Its not like he was fed for the points.  Getting this many FT is insane. Its his points avg
king of travels
Pls u NBA media should give Giannis antetoukoumpo the damn MVP he deserves it
When would people stop with the "Greek Freak" moniker? what if I told you he's from a tribe called Yoruba in Nigeria just like myself? would we all accept the truth? because last time I checked, an Asian elephant brought to a Canadian zoo doesn't make that elephant an American elephant overnight does it?
I really really like giannis atetokonmpo because he my favorite NBA player in the world
Bro ruined a good game by being a douche and stealing game ball
Lol plays when there up by 30 lol
I guess he's already best ever power forward. who else is there? Duncan, Garnett.. Freak is beta
Better give that man his game ball!😂😂
Best player in the world. Argue with yo momma about it
Amazing performance the league will be in great hands 💯
Great traveller
Чистокровный грек, сразу видно))
a 64 point game today is like a 54 point game in 2008 probably
🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷ετσι
Would have been under 40 if they called travelling anymore.
The Greek Freak ballin
He can't shoot😂
Good to see Giannis make his free throws
🔥🔥🔥🔥
He's dominant
my bagless king 😤
Giannis travels all the time
Giannis on a mission to be a winner next year…Dame in good hands
🚨 it is official: you can’t hack him 👀
That's impressive. Then you realize everyone on Pacers is 5 feet tall... all dunks and FT. 😏
So the Pacers stole the game ball from Giannis. He scored a team record 64 points for the Bucks. The Pacers took the ball for a rookie who hit 1 free throw. Think about that.
this man is a beast💪
Τι κάνει ο παλικραος ρε...?💪💪🤯
1:14 he carried from past the letter, R to below the top of the key. keep up the bull 💩@nba
giannis the carrying greek traveler
24/32 ft 🤫🤦🏽‍♂
did he take a jump shot?
well done sir!  maaaaan... lots of power dunks till the end.. and if you add post-up fades, and post-up hooks... i dont know how they going to stop you
gameball gate
He did run it up at the end. I get why Ty felt some type of way
How unusual is it for a player to hit 64 points doing it inside the 3-point line. Now that's tough even if Giannis made it look easy......
They already won the game, could’ve took him out at 5 mins in the 4th but they just had to embarrass the pacers even more
64 points against the worst defensive team in the NBA lmao and he wanted the game ball lol what a loser.
NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL SEEING AS THOUGH THE PACERS ARE THE WORST DEFENSIVE TEAM IN THE LEAGUE LOL.
He wouldn’t be doing this is there was an someone actually guarding the rim
brook lopez 6 blocks? lets give him some props too
No one can guard him in the pacers 😅  Come playoffs
HOLY SHIT HE IS NOT HUMAN
Podcast of the year right here https://youtu.be/4FbV_v7OzWQ?si=yklzq4y2UPB2m37e
not one 3 pointer. yee!
👀👀👀👀 video game numbers
0:30 left foot on floor when the ball hit the groud. Then right foot step, spin, left foot step on the floor and right foot step again. Expkain me please, whats goin on  And 1:16? Ball hit with the right foot step, then the first step by the left foot, second step by right and finally jump with the left  05:40 ? Is this legit 0 step?
Giannis is just a beast is that simple
If joker shoot a free throws like a greek or embild,every game Will be Moore then 50 points,cm 30 free throws?really
Fully healthy and looking to prove a point this season. Beast
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is Giannis traveling?Of course he is-he is travelling straight to the throne of NBA's best player of all time !
Never before in the history of NBA has any player been in THE ZONE for a whole game-Giannis is the best of the best and he is still so young!!!
Travel travel travel SO many times. NBA is no longer basketball
This is not JUST a franchise record .....it's the MOST POINTS EVER SCORED IN AN NBA game WITHOUT 3 points .That guy purely bulldozed em hard! 20 2 points and 24 free throws!JUST INSANE!
Bro, he traveled for few time.  His size with the unclear footwork is truly unguardable 😅
Gianni’s is if shaq stayed in his rookie shape and played as a SF instead being a typical old school center
🤩🤩
Dame did not show up in season tournament
Giannis is if shaq stayed in his rookie shape and actually developed his ball handling skills
28th Ranked Defense.
If your this big fast strong you don’t need a bag. He is a large athletic freak with a good touch around the rim. You don’t have to have a bag to be a lethal scorer
He could’ve had 72 if he made his freethrows. Giannis is like a modern day slim version of shaq
no need to show the free-throws and 9 replays of certain buckets for crying out loud. This clip should have been 5 minutes long! We got work to do here!
Τι εκανε ρε παιδια;!
i need to know what pacer did something personal to this man for him to act like this.Mind you this is the second 50+ points game he gives them this season. i can also remember one last year or something. this is crazy.
Got to keep a bean a lot if those points were just stat stuffing.
Most of the points were from dunk and layup shots. It is more fun to watch Luka scores.
Traveling on every drive
they are a lot of travel
he's undeniably insane at basketball but gets away with traveling and palming more than any player in history.
ΜΑΣ ΚΑΝΕΙΣ ΠΕΡΗΦΑΝΟΥΣ ΡΕ ΜΑΓΚΑ 🇬🇷
Can't stop admiring this man's work ethic.
free throw merchant
3:22 major travel
now tell me that lebron  is the greatest...
Giannis is what people thought Wemby would play like his rookie year😂
Mega❤ Giannis 💯
Giannis has my favorite dunks. Throws that shit down every time
The king of elbowing! In FIBA he would be faul ejected in 10 min
Giannis took it personally. He wanted that finals vs Lebron.
Beast mode give this man props
when you are leading 18-20 in the last 5 minutes of 4Q and you dont pull out your superstar :)
Good defense for the Pacers! 😂
Fantastic
Good job Giannis 🎉
64 Points, 14 Rebound, 3 Assists, And let alone 71% FG   Now thats MVP Level status Giannis Deserved the MVP 30+ points this whole season so far.
Best player in the league
referee out there?
he had 32 attempts, missed 8 had ne made all (prob no but) he wouldve had 72 pts
Sadece turnike at başka bı bokun yok dikkatli izleyin pota altı olmayan takımlara karşı sayı atabiliyor böle uzaktan şut 0 bombos bı adam
You pairing a 64 point giannis with 71 point lillard... Bucks are dangerous
Do not poke the bear.  The points are the less impressive things in this Giannis game.
Not one 3🤯
It's a form of meditation. Constant awareness. For him time slows down and thinking goes away. That's when it's fun.
Incredible
Giannis, already in the top 100 of all time scoring ! Already! Great game here ... The NBA should stop shaking hands after/during free throws now ...
His legacy is already better than LeMickey Blames's one😂
Dame gave him the assist for 60....nice!
32 FT?  Jokic needs 6 games to have 32FT!🤦 FT so far in this seasom 23 games Giannis 260 FT 20 games Embiid  232 24 games Jokic 144
he shouldn't be playing most of the 4th quarter with such a big lead...he would have ended up with about 40 pts
how much steps on 1:44 ?
Bro that final play at @8:58 was so fake, the pacer player literally nonchalantly handed the ball to the Bucks player to further pad Giannis stats LOL... it is so obvious.
Wow!
Hali commits his 1st turn over
MVP
1:15 the travel thats crazy
bro is traveling lol
This guy on the pace to becoming the greatest driver in history
He is a fucking crybaby
Lol I love Giannis but that last free throw took a min to release that’s good ole fashion home cookin
34 free throws. NBA are pushing this dude just like they Are pushing embiid, while they let People beat Jokic up literally and when he says "call the faul Motherfucker" to refs he gets ejected. There is no travel or carry calls against gianis either. Thats why he dominates, but when he plays for greece nt where there is real basketball rules he is half the player he is compared to NBA.
Somebody tell Gilbert Arenas to GTFOH ,,see that shoulder fake at 4:51 ,,that 50k was worth it
you know me better than i know myself
Gamai Kai dernei o Giannhs:-)))
The footwork has improved
This year it’s either Giannis or Luka for mvp with the way they’re playing it’s a sure thing 1 of them is going to get it
Dude ate his oreos before the game
If Giannis wasn’t scary before his new found ability to make free throws surely is.
If Giannis wasn’t scary before his new found ability to make free throws surely is.
A lot of travel
The way he acted after game was childish and the way he was talking to Halliburton was completely disrespectful. Lost a ton of respect for him last night.
Hahahahaahahaha.... It's REDICULOUS...
What's amazing is that nearly all of the points came from the paint.
HE ALWAYS GOES SO HARD !!!! EVERY SINGLE PLAY EVERY SINGLE MOVE HE GOES IN SO SO HARD !!!!
Got damn, every game I watch of the bucks refs call bs lay up and 1 calls. Either there helping to push a league up or slowing the game down cuz they getting blown out. They are being carried by the refs. I mean some of these calls Giannis is throwing his weight around and they still call the other player for foul. The dude had made at least 20 pts at the line.
He is unstoppable!!!
8:00 why he foul? 🤔Got out n to get back in. That's why they took the ball😂tf
literally every play is a travel wtf
Giannis, owner of the Pacers franchise lmao.
N they were home n got game ball taken. They ain't making it far in playoffs unless that sht fuel the fck out them
That’s Phenomenal🔥🔥🔥
This season issssss 🔥🔥‼️😂lotta action #loveit #bigbballfan
He is one of the greatest of all time!
Nba using Giannis to atract interest despite not liking him,too much hate in nba
This video was so powerful, thank you for sharing.
64 and yall think he’s god, but when 2 guys under 6’4 215 score 71 it’s “the league is different, scoring is easy” makes sense
BUT DID HE GET THE BALL THO😂😂😂😂😂
Assassin Giannis💪🔥👌👑🏀
Bully ball. If they say Giannis would be as great as Michael Jordan i would say yeah he's nearly there. His tenacity, his a fierce competitor. He's like Russ in roids.
And all most people will remember is his crying over a ball 😢
giannis might be the best in the nba rn tbh
Jeez, another one of these games? Someone is gonna break Kobes record at this rate. No fuckin defense.
how many of his points required travelling to the moon?
Post moves like hakeem
It amazes me how he travels 90% of the time he touches the basketball
Giannis is a rare specimen, He's like the reincarnation of the 90's tough player that play in a buddy buddy handshake era.
Waiting patiently for the day that he will score 💯
Apparently 1pt >>> 64pt
64 points without hitting even one beyond the arc...
Mvp
It's crazy to see someone in today's nba to score 40 points in the paint, without scoring any three or mid-range shot. Giannis is unreal, but lets be honest, the Pacers defence was horrible tonight. This was like a game from 1950's when Wilt was harrasing those plumbers.
Miles Turner need to get a 3 games suspension for his defense in this game
Too strong and too fast
Never been the biggest Giannis fan but man i cant express the amount of respect i have for him as he is 1 of the very small % of superstars who really has appreciation for loyalty to his team instead of selling out to a big market
Que facilidade em pontuar, uma aberração!
The Greek freak is the Greek god. The best superstar in the nba. The greatest buck
Adam silver needs to eject and fine ginnis.His finger in the pacers coach face!!! That man was embarrassing in his own house.Disgusting,and is really a coward player .I really don't care for him now.
That in season tournament lit fire in that man he gone MVP this year
revenge🔥🔥😈😈
Every game on this night produced more than 200 point over a 100 per team.  Has the NBA officially made defense against the rules ?  Just 1 more reason the league is losing viewers.
if giannis truly wanted to, he could do this every game.
Dude traveled on at least 20 of those points.
Bro got lots of uncalled travels
Το παιδακι που καποτε πουλαγε cd στηνΕλλαδα για να ζησει....
So underrated
Giannis is the pure embodiment of a legend. What a player. One of the 10 greatest players of all time for sure, and at this age. A guy who didnt go hopping around the league for the biggest team even though everybody wanted him to because it would have been so lucrative. But he stayed with the team that drafted him and gave them one of the most impressive Championship runs ever. And he is still going. Baffling and speechless. Greatness personified. It does not matter that the american media does not give him the credit and attention that he deserves since he is not american, that does not change the fact that he truly is the best player in the world.
Giannis The Great GTG
All he  does is travel.
Amazing lebron havent done that. Whoa!
One of my fav players fasho them spins moves and athleticism is something else and now he hitting free throws
Giannis is turning into the player that Shaq had envisioned. You are a dominant player. So dominate. Take the ball into their chest get 3 the hard way. No need to take unnecessary 3s. That is Dame's job to take the 3s.
Lot of traveling haha but not complaining that’s are guy
my favorite player, great work
Best player in the world and its not even close. No discussion. And he's humble and one of the nicest guys out there too. In this league with the most disgustingly power hungry egomaniac refs.
Bro Giannis traveled all game wtf. Not one call lmfao.
NBA seems so fake, no defense, easy points
RIP Pacers, hope that game ball was worth it 💀
Giannis on his villain arc from last season 🥶🥶
So boring to watch free throws and layups😅
And yet, I feel like he is getting ignored for this year MVP race
If Giannis had a lick of a shot don’t see no one seeing him!
I love Giannis and he's one of my favorite players ever. But the amount of times he travels during a game is actually INSANE.  Guess that's the NBA nowadays though 🤣😅
Out of interest, how many steps is Giannis allowed for a 'gather'?
I am happy to see Giannis the Great destroy this worthless team who refused to aknowledge hus greatness by giving him a simple token of it. Well played. He will destroy you for at least 15 more years you fools.
*his IQ on how to breakdown a defense and isolate a defender is Guard-like....as well as the perfect balance between when to use his length and when to use brute force....i can't say I've seen another player like him ever, he has it all now.*
Why do they keep calling travel
Credit to Thanasis and the rest of the end of the bench crew for giving us what we all wanted by blowing half the lead instantly after they tried to take him out at 58.
Da man👊🏽
🔥🔥🔥
Giannis literally beast
RIP Myles Turner😥
1:57 I'm not one to call travels but wtf is this if it's not one 😂😂
4:26 "Οποποποποποπο" 😂
Half of those are travels lol
Turner needs a massage after this game. Feel bad for him he couldn't stop Giannis. The only way to stop him is to foul him lol
Monster play!
Pacers so salty they didn't let him have the game ball
Amazing performance but still a boring player to watch at least to me
Is that a travel on the last part?
lol  first minute and a half of the video and the Pacers bench is calling for travelling almost every bucket
Hindi matanggap Ang Pagkataon Nang EST..
Giannis changed his freethrow form.. Looks good though... 😊
Sayang Ang 64 pts kung Ganyan Ugali Ni Giannis Hambog...🤣
Wish he would have took 1 more dribble on that last slam lmao
ヤニスのスピンムーブって誰が止めれんの
He improves his freethrow shooting 😭.. I'm happy for him that he make it because of his hardwork...❤
Aquí es cuándo me hace gracia que le gente diga de LeBron que es solo físico!! Este tipo solo metió puntos en la pintura ni un feedawey ni un triple
こわい
Este si que abusa de físico el choca siempre y sólo penetra  tremendo tanque
there was a guy from the eightys sitting close to the mic, shouting "travel" at every move...🤣🤣🤣
32 fucking free throws, what the fuck?
Is defense forbidden in the U.S?
Michael Jeffrey Jordan had 69 and 19 rebounds in a game that mattered. He was 6'6 230lbs...
this is how much Shaq would average if he could make FTs
Bro the description really say daman lillard😂
Wow Giannis making his free throws so easy. This is awesome. Go BULKS
Defense? Really? So many games with 140 or more points, is this still basketball?
Why exactly is that “HiStOrIc”…. Not like it’s never been done.  MJ put up 69 points and 18 rebs in a game as a 6’6 guard.  Not a 6’11 PF.
It's about time to see Giannis break Michael Redd's previous record. Been waiting for that.
poor pacers bench..... greek freak is allowed to do garbage time scoring...... fake humble forever
Was that zero Jumpshots??
Not a Greak freak, he is a Greak God.
This is the dude that had 50 in a finals CLOSER game. He's beating this record at least one more time in his career so STAND BY
1:14 The most obvious carry I've seen in a while.
Giannis "WentBananas" Antetounkonmpo
Best player on the NBA not even close
he still breaking the 10 second ft rule? what's that counting?
I swear to god Gianni’s had like 40 something with like 6 mins left in the 4th. Unbelievable.
Turner has been cooked the past couple of games. 40 from AD and this 64 from Giannis.
Bro could have scored 70 easy 😤😤😤
Giannis came to play tonight
5:00 What's happening there? Why are they all standing out of the 3?
Can he do it on a cold and rainy Tuesday night in Stoke
A video like this from embiid would be 10 minutes of free throws 😂
*I have the impression that he travels on half of his dunks.* But this is only a feeling...
Tyrese Haliburton probably cried himself to sleep knowing that there was one night where he didn’t get all the attention
damn Turner got destroyed by AD and Giannis in less than a week hahahah
Pacers really tried to take the game ball away because some scrub scored 1 point when they knew damn well that Giannis just set a record
Did they intentionally foul him? Jesus, 28 foul shot attempts?
Well, he didn't really need to stay in the game after about 50 points. They were up by like 20 with 5 minutes left. He had a great night, but no need to pile it on at the end.
He's a very athletic player, but there are too many travels...
That dunk at the end gave me goosebumps 💪💪💪 whatta guy
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO#34 .. THE NBA'S 🏀 BEST PLAYER ..
The pacers are soft defensively.
can anyone explain why 1:26 isnt a travel?
If giannis master's the jumpshot its over
That was personal😦
Giannis was amazing here 🔥 But its crazy, that there just exists no travel anymore 😅
Did he even shoot a jump shot lol
This was an MVP winning title game
Its just unfair, Myles turner acting like a kid next to giannis
What a travel😅
There are 8 travels in this clip only. Plus the 32 free throws. Giannis was in his bag.
daam
Nice numbers, but 32 ft, c'mon 😂 Why only Embiid and Gianni's got refs respect and not Jokic?!
Giannis w/ free throws > Prime shaq (the only right answer)
How many points were scored when he only took 2 steps?
Wow and he is better than perfect
Half of the team points are from him. That means the rest of the team played bad and he needed to step in. This is typical for all top class players such as Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Lebron etc. When they score a lot of points it means they just had to level up the game since the rest of the team is not functioning as they should.
No resistance from the Pacers  Dribbling violations such as:  1:15 Lifting 1:25 Travelling 3:55 Palming 7:05 Lifting  These are just the obvious ones; could be others upon closer review.  32 FTs from home-friendly refs  Yeah the NBA has become a circus
Think about how many points shaq left on the floor because of poor free throw shooting.  Side bar: zion!! This is what basketball shape looks like my Boi
My favorite player but man so many travels and ball carries not called
Superteam merchant giannis. So happy beating pacers in a regular season game 😂 When it’s matter, got knockout like thrash 😂
Gianis stat padder koumpu
Seeing his stats when he makes his free throws just makes me wonder how shaqs would’ve looked had he made his
7:13 call him the highest paid cheerleader ever. But it was wholesome seeing his brother so hype
So much history that the pacers steals the ball XD
And after that only once in a while show, on his home court, those nobodys from Indiana snatch him his well-deserved game ball! What a class act!
the one day i forget to change my lineups for fantasy
3:25 can someone explain to me how is this not travelling?
Giannis’s brother gotta be the most expensive cheerleader in the world
😊😊
Bawaya..
At 0:57 i wonder what Haliburton was thinking looking at Giannis!
Little Child
but he can't perform under pressure lost to the pacers when it counted
It’s funny AD had 40 on the Pacers and now Giannis just had 64 🤣🤣🤣 they need more big mennnnnnnn 😭😭😭
CJ could never
Giannis has the all-time team record with 64 points,what a performance!!!
64 pts and 2 hours at the free throw line
Amazing stuff from Greek, but he travels too much!
The NBA oughta give Giannis an extra point or two on the night for chasing down that loose ball after the game ended. 😉
Look at that thanasis man, so inspirational
4:03 Is it just me or is this not a carry.
Best steal of the game was from the pacers team stealing the game ball and made giannis cry
Giannis learns the 4 steps lay up from Lebron and levels up to 1-dribble-6-step lay up
Giannis 👍👍👍😊
Best running back in the NBA!
Gainnis is so strong he's unstoppable, they deliberately fouled him,but to no avail, where is their humanity through sportsmanship, listen to pacers coach in the interview. They simply don't ve a answer to Giannis mighty onslaught. Observe closely the game.
This man is travelling HARD
Fuck you youtube i don't care about your fucking ads
Giannis is an absolute king 👑 staying up late to watch this guy tear it up was the best decision I have made in a long time 🍿
Giannis is going to make Myles Turner retire 😭
A talented triple jumper
OMGGG THE LEVEL OF DOMINANCE IS SCARY! THEY CANT DO ANYTHING BUT FOUL HIM!
Giannis and Embiid combined in the last  2 games have more FT attempts than Jokic in the entire season 😂😂😂  NBA really trying 😂
All the greek people are proud of giannis
64pts without a 3pt. GREAT GAME GREEK FREAK !
Giannis is like Shaq if he stayed in shape but shorter
Damn monstar
He didnt make any jumper 😂
All of them in paint, dunk,... 😢 Hmmm, he can do more for an ex-mvp. No midrange, no 3P shoots...He seems very atletic but still limited. 64 pts is impresive too!
No jumpshots? Cheap points
64 points and dude still cant shoot. Impressive.
Oh my Giannis. Kobe is watching from somewhere and smiling 😎
It’s hilarious the pacers thought they could guard him with their pathetic front court
1:35 nice travel
NBA is so easy for the best European players 😂
Da Greek Freak 🇬🇷🦌
Giannis drops a career high & franchise scoring record and they WON at HOME and the fucking Pacers tryna give the ball to some no name rookie who scored 1pt “iTs HIs fIrST BaSkeT 🫨”
but its against the Pacers, its like scoring 45 in a normal game... irrelevant
Πωπωπωπωπωπωπωπω...😂😂 Beast mode..👍
90% of his movements are traveling..he cant do shit in euroleague ..
Exceptional but if this was LeBron people would kill him for still playing in the 4th quarter as his team is uo by 20 just to set the record
You can tell when he beat his career high he knew by his face he could get a bit more
Giannis finally in the top 10 for mvp this season
Free throw merchant
How special is he? In a league filled with elite athletes, to toy like that with everyone..is just insane. 64 points with these stats is video game material!
Imagine 64 with no 3pts
Been waiting for a while now. I know Giannis Antetokoumnpo will do things like this and he will score more and more points as time goes by. It's like NBA2K Giannis 60 PPG
All scored in the paint that's insane 😂😂😂
harden would have 70 with that much free throws
everyone loves giannis shooting free throws but hates harden shooting free throws 🤣🤣 still congrats to giannis for the bucks record 💪
Give giannis the MVP
Giannis got that stack of points lmao
GIANNIIIIIIIIIIIS! 🇨🇱💪🏼❤️
Scored 20 of his points in garbage time 😂😂😂
good
Yannis is incredible but still…if the NBA were serious about elementary basketball rules….lot of travelling in almost every situation and not a whistle. That’s a pretty standard situation overseas but this falsify even huge performances. Already defence in NBA struggles because of the advantages given to the offence, but travelling is an enormous one in a quick play
no BS three pointer, no BS 2 steps back jumper, no BS logo shot, just no BS go right at the rim i hope he develops his post game and hook shot though free throw has improved, still we can see there is a slight pause before he release...but as long as he makes it
Giannis wanted that 500k 😂
Bully MODE😂😂#34 Giannis😊
The pacers got no body to do anything defensively to dude.
Μας καύλωσες πρωινιατικα παιχτουρα
The way he fell make me laugh 😂 3:56
Giannis hit them with the Greek 'po po po po' hahahahha
Giannis ruined his performance with that cringe fest that followed
🦌
Enough with this woman speaker!👎🏼
MVP!
G-Wagon is tired of the disrespect. He's a top 10 all time player.
Γιαννη και Θαναση ,σας χαιρετω απο την Γλυφαδα Αθηνα,συγχαρητηρια . Απο την Ελλαδα Παροκολουθουμε τους Milwaukee Bucks   γιατι παιζει ο Γιαννης και ο Θανασης🔥🔥🔥Gianni and Thanasis, I greet you from Glyfada Athena, congratulations. From Greece We follow the Milwaukee Bucks❤    because Giannis and Thanasis are playin❤
call varejao no points
GREEK FREAK IS ON A MISSION
WTF did the Pacers do to piss off Giannis?
1:40 travel?
half of the vid is him shooting free throws…
30 free throws to one player?? In Euroleague both teams don't get that many free throws. Regular season is really becoming a circus.
For a second I thought jae crowder was burna boy lmao
Someone comparing Giannis to Wilt Lol, you made my day. Wilt can be the worst player in this generation
쿤당탕탕 지려따
Since when giannis has this type of bag 4:03 probably what he learned with hakeem,  if he develops the spin fake its going to be lethal
Can someone who knows basketball(I don't) explain travels to me? Because on some of his moves(maybe its just one and that one stuck out to me) he takes like five steps and its no call?
32 fouls called on Giannis. Really though. That seems a little suspicious. lol.
Greek goat
Such a beast, best player in the world right now (I love Jokic, but this sport is played on both ends), my favorite player. The NBA is in a pathetic state, the weakest level of play since the 70s... but Giannis is one of the few positive sparks of this circus
This single performance clocked a gamescore of 57, the 6TH GREATEST INDIVIDUAL GAME OF ALL TIME. Guys, this is history.
Giannis has THE balls
Giannis 💪
Oooo ΜΠΑΜΠΑΣ σας!!!
The most boring 64 points ever 🥱
Did he attempt or make a jump shot in this game?
32 FTA... Bruh! lol, who gets 32 free throws?
boring
Absolutely amazing!!!🐐🐐🐐
This young Pacers need to be humble a bit,
Trash
No 3s, in a 3 ball 🏀 ERA, is crazy! 😤
Sencillamente increíble... Es un jugador de otro mundo.... Con ese giro 360... Antes de volcarla... A esa velocidad... Es un fuera de serie.... Y el es... La razón de porque soy fanático de los Milwaukee bucks.... Siempre es "está noche juega Giannis"....
A legend is born
MVP (all I gotta say)
I´m not a huge basketball fan but imo its not the skill that made this so impressive but the energy he showcased consistently.
mvp incoming....
he can average 40 if he shoots his freethrow like this
Giannis was electric tonight
32 ft 😂hahahn
Aint miles turner post to be a great defender???😂😂
Giannis "I TOOK IT PERSONALLY" Antetokounmpo 64 points edition 😆 🤣 😂
He made Turner look like a baby  😂
30 from FT is a menace😂 the next James Harden😂
Crazy to think Giannis could do this game in game out if he really wanted
64 point with 0 three points made
Never before seen levels of statpadding. Smh have some shame nigga
Bro hates the pacers 😂 he got 3 50 Pt games against them 😭
Holy sh**
This man is a one traveling violation band lol
Indiana is no longer the problem. Boston is next.
The key for a Bucks championship is and always has been Giannis' shooting. If he shoots bad they're gonna lose, if he shoots good then you're screwed. If he develops that shot its a chip no question.
I am new to basketball and my friend told me you can only take two steps without bouncing. I am so confused as every highlight I see people taking three steps. Is it allowed to take three steps inside the box or something ?
Giannis is the embodiment of average skill but overpowered strenghts
Great game by the big fella!  I still laugh watching the NBA, at the leniency on travel calls, though.  His last dunk game after 3/4 of the court and one bounce.  LOL.
a very efficient 64 points. Legendary stat for a legendary player
He might make a run for 82 pt game tbh.
Giannis cooked Turner all night lol
Giannis on his mvp mode
Giannis taking notes from AD and Lebron. Just attack them in the paint they ain't gonna do nothing LOL
give this man his game ball
Please give him game ball😂
THATS INSANE!! What a night! What a year!Love from Greece Giannis❤❤never missed a game.I told you night in and night out his prime is  S C A R Y !!
kahit e benta yun Kay boss Toyo ang bola malamang bibilhin yun babaratin nga lang 😅😂
Same pacers Bucks lost to in the semi finals of the In-season tournament 😂. We all know that loss was bullshit
Give this man his ball! What a performance!
They should’ve gave him the game ball 💯
Honestly this game makes me realize how terrifying shaq would have been if he could shoot even a little bit
He should start bullying the league
Giannis is too much for the pacers hes averaging 50 points against them yikes 😬😳
next game he will be sitting out. load management 😅
garbage time points
This is really MVP then Embiid
Giannis 101 Travels 61 pts 12 rebounds - Triple Double
The only reason why this video is 9 minutes long is the same reason why watching the bucks is difficult.  It ain't normal how long it takes for  Giannis to shoot a free frow.
Dude missed 11 free throws. He could’ve had 70 something 😂. That’s some Shaq shit 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
@NBA i think you mean Damian Lillard
Im an OG giannis fan (since draft) but he did travel at 1:27, Myles was right.
Why is he in the game when they’re up 20? Chasing a career high lol. Man was counting his points too, gesturing the 50. Worry about the chip buddy.
It’s  almost like Giannis was angry and had a score to settle with the Pacers 🤔 I wonder why that would be?
Not that impressive
this pacers bench yelling travel everytime giannis is busting their rim
This is Definitely Get Back From That Tournament 🤣🤣🤣
@7:33 ... That's real brotherly love
Imagine this. Giannis best scoring game ever in his prime.........Kobe on retirement night after 20 seasons on no knees!
Not to hate but this has to be the most boring 64 point game…
Shooting guards/shooting power forwards mostly can do that 60+points game definitely they were 3pt shooters...but Giannis 64 is insane...most points came from inside the paint...
I love Gianni’s.. yet .. this wasn’t that impressive
Greek Freak🔥🔥🔥🔥
that kids last name ajax was greek name and his team up with greek freak
Giannis is a Nightmare!
this is fun and all but i rather see this in crucial moments... needs to pop off in play offs more
steph still better lmao
that's what you do when you get eliminated in play-in :D
Dude did he get 64 without a single jumper?
After the game pacers took the game ball and ran to the locker room so giannis couldn’t have the game ball on a franchise record night on 70% fg shooting while dame also became 5th all time 3pt shooter the same game. The pacers excuse was they wanted to give it to their player who scored his first point in the nba on a freethrow after losing the game😂. They were being petty and I now hate this team except Tyrese. Y’all know y’all didn’t deserve the ball, y’all was just salty that giannis humbled y’all after all that talking in the in-season tournament
5:00 There’s a guy counting how long it takes to shoot a free throw, he got to 12 seconds 😂
Funny they call him bag less cause they just don't understand how he comes up with this performances ... incredible 64pt at the rim ❤
I wonder; has this ever happened before with no 3-pointers?
lol its all dunks, layups and freethrows. Compare this HISTORIC performance with any Jordan, Kobe, Bird, Curry +50 game and you'll see a difference. (I didnt name lebron or shaq bc they're mostly like giannis, brute raw physical power over any kind of tecnique/skill)
According to ESPN Stats and Info, Giannis Antetokounmpo's 64 points came on only 28 FG attempts. It's the most points with fewer than 30 FGA in a game in NBA history.
Luckily the pacers bench made it a close game and brought Giannis back into the game
Lebron knew that Giannis was gonna drop 60
So they took Giannis out on his 58th bucket....he was done for the game...then the Bucks got torched  so they had to bring him back in..🤣🤣🤣
I just watched 8 mins free throws high lightz 😂😂
τιποτα το εχει τερματισει το μπασκετ καιρος να τα παρατησει και να μαθει κιθαρα.
reality check game for the pacers. 0 defense in the paint :) , good team with offense but no defense in the paint just like the WCF mavs
ben simmons should be learning how to shoot
He heard everyone talking about AD 😂
I choose him over Shaq
No hate but, i hope can do this kind of physicality in playoffs, every playoffs, he gets softer game by game lol, just like last year
Μπάσκετ αλάνας. Ότι να ναι
🥲
4:26 definitely saying " pw pw pw pw" 😆😆
lawls...so he gets 24-32 fts and ppl think this is special? The very same ppl praising this was giving Harden shit.
Giannis 64 was skillful, finesse and power, not cheap or phony...  No 3 jacking. All  2's  and  freethrows. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Ayo didnt the pacers get a 60 dropped by klay too lol 😂😂😂😂 dawg 2 players score 60 when the pacers havent had nobody close in this century 😅
They're supposed to be the lakers opponent on in-season tournament finals but pacers denied them so it was a sweet revenge
The way he scores is more like Westbrook. Scoring this way becomes difficult as you get older. It seems that the Bucks will have to rebuild in the next three years because they cannot win a championship.
5 more would’ve been hilarious. Giannis would’ve definitely had something funny to say about it.
Follows every LBJ moves. Way to go boi
best player in the world currently ..for about 4 seasons now
No jumpshots amazing 🤩 pure bullyball for greek freak
Between the lakers game and this game Myles Turner has given up over 100 points lol I know he wasn’t on the floor the while time but still
James Harden highlights?
why tf pacers got the game ball? it's not even their homecourt
He's way more likeable than lebron. Everyone roots for him.
Giannis is a generational talent and plays the game how it’s supposed to be played.
Best player in the league
Giannis dribbling is so weird that I don't know if he travel or not.. he just need 1 dribble from half line to make a dunk, is that normal or illegal? wtf
It looks like he adjusted his free throw routine.   Elbows are tight, the “delay” before he dips into his free throw shot is much shorter. That long pause must stop his rhythm.
This is why the League needs to get bigger and stop thinking small skinny dudes like Victor or Chet are the future.  Dudes are too small.
Bully Ball
glad he didn't get ejected from celebrating that 64 points dunk
Coach: we’re up 25 take a seat. Giannis: I’m breaking the record
My GOAT
No defense, no credit
Giannis is no match to buttler. History repeat itself.
Giannis was on fire tonight!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nba 2k onlin3 team up shit 😂
First player to have 60 and 10 rebs in a game with zero 3 pointers since prime Shaq, literally the modern Shaq
This is what happens without 3
Imagine Damian now he can finally help and watch his team winning without being him the one who carries, he came home that night like baby, I'm not tired tonight it's dame time for u 😂
Absolutely amazing!
🫡🫡😮‍💨
myles turner getting cooked, AD put 40/20 on him the other night haha
Come on now 64? Up 19 with 2 minutes left you keep him in? Either he wanted revenge or this is just unsportsmanlike straight up
WOW! 64 points from a player that has no skills (according to James Harden)
Guys, tell Giannis I know where the real ball is.
Wait till he plays his daddy kawhi leonard..
40 ft attemps is wild,well done n a
This season's "insane" players are going to be Giannis, Bron, Curry, ... in your opinion....?
He is amazing, but how many times can this man get away with traveling! Gather 1-2-3 on so many possessions.
Mamaw talaga
BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA
Only thing the pacers did tonight was call travel
when it came to the playoffs, butler beat him😂😂😂😂
Finally Giannis is now part of the 60+ points gang   Welcome to the 60 gang Giannis34!
Damn Myles  got his soul snatched
man i love giannis but good lord does that man get away with travels
I was really glad AG put Giannis and the starting squad back into the game to ensure the W and also give Giannis an opportunity to add more points to the legendary scoring night. 58 was good but 64 is much better! Congrats Giannis and GO BUCKS!!! ☝😃👍
Sheesh
8964❤
0:25 that Hakeem spin.
Pretty crazy that every single basket was at the rim and he still scored 64.
Don’t poke the bear tyrese. Ur not that guy cause of a good run of form. Giannis gave a reality check of the difference between good players and the best in the world.
He can score 100 points easly but he also tries to pass so・・・
Statpadding free throw merchant
I'm a huge Pacers fan been since Reggie Miller but everytime I look at the nba we look nice but somebody always gonna score 60 points on us😢
Lakers showed them how to beat the Pacers. Pound it in the paint and they can’t stop you since they’re too small.
Hardest earned 64 points ever...he goes so fast and takes all the contact.
those first plays you can tell he was going for something, i mean that first dunk was scary just wow!!
All i am going to say is 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭😂😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 👍
Giannis always destroys the pacers, lebron always destroys the raptors, curry always destroys the rockets, Luka always destroys the clippers!!! Let me know if I’m missing anyone else!!!
Giannis and Thanasis get 64points ！！incredible😮😮
FT!!!!!!
Give the fans something to see......that's y the pacers kept game ball  ..salty
hate the fact that the Bucks still let Giannis stay on the floor when they were up 20 with only a few minutes left, that is just pure stat padding and not letting the bench players have their time.
Revenge is a great motive guys, learn from this!
I love seeing that.  So many times I've had arguments with idiots who claim that 3 pt shooters are more valuable than post players because even at a low shooting percentage they score more points and therefore you can't win without being 3 pt dominant.  Somebody wake me the next time Steph Curry goes for 64 because it hasn't happened yet (no matter how many shots he's jacked up).
Lillard will have a 50+ game this year watch but they don't have enough to win in my opinion  boston is better
Giannis eventually is going to score 101 points and beat Wilt and finally shut all of you haters up. Dude gets body slammed WWE style by Aaron Nesmith and gets hacked all night having to take 32 FT. Dirty ass trash Pacer organization then steals the game ball for the franchise record and personal record then lies about taking it and not thinking about it. Hell no.
The carry at 1:15 LMAO, followed by 6 steps, gd how the rules have changed LOL!
The narrative killer strikes again
The amount of violations he gets away with and the amount of free throws he's given is unbelievable. Refs and NBA doing tricks on it
Myles Turner is barbecue chicken to Giannis or whatever his favorite Greek dish is lol
Why not show the shot that led to the free throws? Who ever makes the highlights in this channel is trash
Loving the old school style of playing in the paint!
I sure picked the right night to bet on Giannis going over the O/U. Thanks Giannis.
Shaq performance - dominance
Godness
Happy for Giannis, but ge could of had 70 if he made more free throws 😮
32 free throws, 😂😂😂 I remember Shaq and how dominant he was, but he never get more than 15 free throws. I watch Denver games, no calls on Jokic, then move to Bucks and 76 and Embild and Giannis get 20 free throws a night 😝😝😝
Giannis is comparable to Shawn Kemp!
Dame gone break this record
Getting to 64 with no 3's is CRAZY 🤯🤯😵‍💫😵‍💫🥶🥶
After the match Dame looking to Giannis like “Bruv i scored 70 points in last season, its nothing”
Miles Turner was the workout partner today lmao😂😂
And Fantasy owners all over the world celebrate!
Dude not human….phone home‼️👽🛸
can't take trips to Greece and have an open bar and ONLY get 62...doodooo
He came back again with 2 minutes to play? The the pacers make a run at then end with 5 minutes left?
64 master peace the dominance bro is another level he literally is the modern Shaq all this without threes
The Greek Freak  . The MVP. 👏👏👏
Its a stat pad. The game already done early but still playing.
What??? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I still needed those 6 rebounds my boy ..🙄
PETSOKOMMA!!!!!!!!!
Insane performance, funny how no one could stop him. On top of that, they had to wait 10 whole seconds on all of those 30 free throws. That's 5 minutes of waiting for him to shoot haha
If he  continues to make his free throws at the percentage he did tonight. He won't be able to be stopped
Did he shoot any ?
It's FTA man!
32 free throws is crazy
Nice stat padding giannis lead by 20 points and play against the second unit ...
Game ball should be giannis that's the good thing 😢
and also the carrying of the ball
Some traveling going on here...
Giannis and Lopez combined for 70 points tonight 🔥🔥🔥
man always get away with travels. the Nba should do something about it
Rip the pacers
how about you watch his every dribble and steps
No defense holy shit
Congrats🎉
run and dunk man ran and dunked so many times he broke a record. Convince me he doesnt drop 100 in wilts era
Most boring 60 point game ever
What’s scarier is that if he were to hit his free throws consistently like he did tonight we’d be seeing a lot more performances like this 🤧
My step dad personally knows Andre Jackson Jr
I bet he won't do it in the playoffs
MVP
58 points I made it let myself out without any hesitation that’s the greatness
https://youtu.be/F8pWTRWWrRY?feature=shared
Bucks AND NBA Legend ‼️🦌🐐🐐🐐
he spins like he's 5'9", that shit is crazy
“So when they come to Milwaukee…”
64 on 28 shots LOL thats just dumb
kool
Honestly why I stopped watching the NBA, scored 64 and only had good to average defense on a few buckets. Zero defense, soft
Thats your number one ranked player in the NBA.
ペイサーズオフェンス終わるの早いからその分攻める時間が増えるからこんなに得点できるんだよ！
Half the points off the line is crazy 😂
The foot work 😱😱
Giannis footwork and body control has improved a lot. Amazing how he continues to work on his game even after winning MVP and the Championship
this is the real power play .. not like zion 🤣
64 pts and not a SINGLE jumpshot 😭😭 how do u stop this
I thought Giannis was this generation's Shaq, but I just watched Giannis hit two free throws in a row and I realized I was wrong.
He don't need 3's. Just be consistent ft shooter already enough to be a monster!
he should only have 58 though if he didnt come back in d game
Goat-y, to me 🐐
No hate but 32 FTA is absurd
I was there at 55... this is insane.
It would be impressive if he didn’t shoot 32 free throw attempts this game.  That is as much as the entire Pacers team took.  If one player shoots as many FT attempts as the opposing team, then something isn’t right.
At 3:57, Giannis once again drops his shoulder right into the middle of the defenders chest throwing him backwards, NO OFFENSIVE FOUL CALLED!!!!
But where's the ball?!?
Monster Giannis
Giannis is so damn insane. Love the free throw improvement too. What a game!
Nba needs to raise the rim to 11 ft. It’s like playing on a fisher price hoop for them
at 1:58 giannis travelled.  you can only take one step when you catch the ball not two.
Very proud of Giannis ♥
At 3:11 Giannis puts his elbows up and completely barrels thru the chest of the defender, NO OFFENSIVE FOUL CALLED!!! The NBA is such a joke
Giannis é fantástico dominante ele todos os anos está no mesmo nível 🏀
6:00  Is that Doris talkin like that ? I see you gal
If anyone can get 100 it’s him, because he gets more easy layups than anyone since Wilt.
Travel god. Lebron started the trend and giannis is taking it to the next level.
Man they just let superstars get away with everything 😂😂 man was reaching hard asl in them steals… whole body pressed on the offensive player
I really like to watch his defense. Not so much his offense as he travels in EVERY SINGLE PLAY
how i wish he had 20 boards 😮 great game gianiss
No game ball. All that Doesn’t mean anything.
Tem que trocar o aro   depois do jogo
LOL PACERS 😂😂😂😂😂
if  he wins another  2 more chip,2 finals mvp and 1 more mvp  he will be better than Lebron all time. Stick to the grind and wins with what he had on one team
This is what happens when you  PICK THE GREEK FREAK TO RUN THE “PACERS TEST”!!🤣
MVP
Giannis so good tonight he's making haters cope for real. 😂
Damn Giannis was piss he needed his get back and boy did he do it
When I first looked at the thumbnail i thought it was from a combine of games but it’s actually from just tonight. What a incredible single hand performance Giannis 🙏🏾
Godzilla!
He’s going 2007-Lebron mode this season league better watch out !!
Wow no threes and still score 64. That's a bad mad man
Mvp
PRIME GIANNIS !  HE GONNA BE HOF FOR SURE !
Once he put that shoulder into u, ur done
The very next highlight, at 1:26 Giannis takes 4 steps and and a pivot, NO TRAVEL CALLED!!!
3 more than Shaq’s career high 👀
MIles turner would be so good if he stopped being soft
Are the pacers getting exposed? They getting wrecked by big physical teams
1:17 Giannis right out in the open cups the ball and swings it from behind his body on the left all the way to the front right side of his body, NO CARRY CALLED!!!
8:59초
They need to get rid of miles turner ASAP!!!!
Bakaw KC Kaya NAKA gawa Ng ganyan ...kawawa UNG MGA kakampi....
❤❤❤👏🏼👏🏼
Giannis better then LeBum
The 360 spin before the dunk was awesome. What an amazing performance
You won’t like him when he’s angry
Yeah the Pacers pissed him off for sure
Giannis brother is one expensive cheerleader
2014 lebron 61<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<2023 giannis 64
Stop Giannis they're already dead
They just let him get away with shit
I didn’t watch the game, why did they take him out just to put him back in and stat pad?
This should be titled "When Talking King Shit Goes Real Wrong." Haliburton is a very good player but after he dunked an Giannis shouldered him he should have turned the volume down on his mouth. Some people don't play that shit.
I’m not a bucks fan but give this man his flowers. Best player in the world IMO
Congrats to Giannis on reaching a career high 64 pts! But man my Bucks bench needs some work. No way the starters should have come back in to finish the game.
Now I understand why elite players don't get faul calls,alot😂🎉
Giannis AMP-UP-THE-TEMPO
1:45 is the one of the biggest travels I've ever fucking seen. Turner should've just subbed out at that point cause you ain't winning vs them type of no calls in professional basketball. takes 3 steps after the gather with no dribble, STOPS, pivots with the left foot used for step 3 to take a FOURTH step, and then lays it up. what a fucking joke.
they upset him on his birthday so he took his revange  by breaking a career and franchise record, what a player !
Historic night for Giannis, but 1:40 that's traveling
The NBA uses MAGNETIC technology and fans still can't tell
For a man who doesnt shoot 3s
bet he took this game personal
Every time I think I play an AMAZING game on my local court, i come back to these videos to humble myself
Wtf 😳😳
That man is a GYRO
He gone get drug test tomorrow
Pacers are the new Memphis Grizzlies. Tasted a little success and becomes cocky as fuck. Gooduck when you meet Giannis in the post season. He's gonna average 50 on you guys
Amazing. Very much legal. Opposing team can never complain if they get beaten by this much till the last second
Haven’t seen Giannis play in a minute, really impressed with the free throws! Hopefully he can keep it up!
Dude almost dropped 70 sheesh
Giannis just showed how much better he is compared to Lebron. Lebron was barelly dropping 30, on less efficiency; while Giannis does this.They need to start talking about guys like this and stop talking about guys like Bron
GIANNIS WOKE UP AND CHOSE VIOLENCE!!!
Celtics, Bucks, Suns and others weren't taking the inseason tournament seriously, LeBron fans jumping for joy over a meaningless trophy lol
Greek freak
what I dont understand is why giannis is still in the game in the last half of 4th quarter when they're up 20.. that's why we don't see players like Klay drop 80 that one game when he only played 29 minutes..
The Greek freak different if knock down a few more free throws the man could have had 70pts easily but he did good overall on the FT line 😮
what a day to bet the over
The man the myth. Giannis you absolute beast!! Give this man his flowers dude bleeds Milwaukee
Giannis, Bron, 90s Shaq and 80s Jordan are the best players I've ever seen when it comes to transition scoring and half court paint pressure.
He scored more points in a game than James Harden has. Not bad considering Harden said he’s 7ft with no skills
Look at Giannis, so inspirational wth that 64 points .
All in the paint and at the line not one jump shot is crazy
These female announcers don’t sound right calling nba games …low pitch ..no real electric broadcasting experience lol im just sayin
1:13 .. that is literally something only Giannas can do. That drive is impossible to stop.
Damn just damn
that time with Hakeem paying off...
Theres a hit out on the pacers now 😂😂😂
This is the 7th most points game by player in the NBA EVER .. Kobe watching from somewhere and smiling 😎bro
The media really got this man 6th in the MVP ratings , y’all better give this man his 3rd MVP ,stop playing!
Video game numbers😮
Some pretty weak stat padding at the end
35 freethrow attempts is absured
Most dominant player since Shaq
Real mvp
Bro didn't have a single three and had 64! GREEK FREAKKK
This is what happens when Giannis makes 24 of his 32 Free Throws.
Not trying to rain on his parade, but why risk him getting injured?
Real MVP Giannis❤💪🔥
Wouldve had 70 if he had a halfway decent 3 ball😂
Bro was so good not even the security guards could guard him😂😂😂
Nice to see Giannis make his free throws. It's really been his achilles heel
The Greek Freak  💪
Stop wasting time and give this man the season MVP
GIANNIS DESERVES THE MVP GREATEST PLAYER IN THE NBA!!   64PTS!!!!!!!!! 😱😱😱😱  🔥🔥
Is the Greek Freak friends!!!
This was a revenge game for Giannis against the Pacers. Go Giannis 💪🏽
Giannis MVP!
Bro had as many fta as the entire pacers 💀
Incredibles travels
32 free throws is very suspect
he shouldve had 60 the first time they played when he dropped 54
Pacers can't defend bigs at all their too small embiid is gonna have 50 on them
Giannis holds a grudge like a 90s nba player
ANTETO👉 KRATOS SE LIBERÓ LA BESTIA😤💪🇩🇴🇩🇴
The best player in the NBA rn.
32 free throws lolll
Y’all are not talking about how this man shot 32 free throws.  Y’all talk about Embiid foul baiting.  When has Embiid ever shot 32 free throws in a game??
This man is literally modern day Wilt man lol
That was extremely shameless stat padding by Giannis but who knows when you’ll get 60+ so I respect it
The Pacers took game ball to their locker room after the game and Giannis chased after them 😂
worst 60pt game in nba history
1st 60+ point game of the season. Not bad for a “bagless” man
Some casuals don't understand that he just have those amount of freethrows because they can't stop him. he would have even more if they wouldn't foul him
See What happen you make ya free throws ❗️GREATNESS
Bro took the loss in the tournament personally 😂😂😂

Giannis Is A BEAST!
I love how they don’t include the footage where he was mad (for some reason) after the game lol he was arguing with his teammates
Adrian Griffin is dirty for putting him back in the game😂
