Somehow his image got even worse after this
Man, we watched his actions in his games. That all told the whole story.
Scrolling through to see all the fanboys opinions aging like milk lol
I think this brother is just overwhelmed with everything,and he is over thinking things Im an artist and sometimes i think so much and have so many ideas that i can't even draw or create,but im very great at what i can do,but some of the greatest talents out there just don't have the drive to be the greatest,some people have the potential to be the best,but something hold them back,it took me years to break that cycle 🙌🏾 but i finally got over my crap,it took awhile,but i got through it💪🏾💯 For instance,if i know someone that know how to fix cars,and i give him a garage with all the tools in it to be successful he won't want to run the Garage,he'll come to work in the garage here and there just enough to get through,but he won't want be the boss,he just want beer and cigarettes and pay some bills,but he has all the potential to be the best Car Garage around But It's not his passion,i think Ben Simmons is misunderstood,i hope he get it,i have faith in this brother,many blessings Ben 🙌🏾
Nice to see he hasn't made good on anything he said he would.
Still waiting on those jumpshots and 3s ben lmao
Ben Simmons seems very unlikable
Fun fact he’s putting on an American accent he was born and grew up in Australia
This is…. fascinating….. to say the least…….
EVERYTHING BEN SAID ON HERE CAME FROM AN HONEST PLACE TRUST ME
He a 66 overall on 2k rn
JJ get this man Ben simmions via trade and make history!!
"You were hurt obviously" LOL
Send him here to Portland. Our fans are so heart broken they hate the owner, the gm, and the coach. It’s perfect. Jerami and brogdon for Simmons straight up.  Dumb and dumber style.  Fully redeem ourselves. So your saying there’s a chance. Yea!!! It’s Portland!
The most boring interview I have seen, Ben is not interesting at all
Almost 2 years later and nothings changed. What a shame
Ben Simmons looks good in retirement he looks like he could still play now .
Here after he's been ruled out for the rest of the szn, nothing's changed
Came back to this and nothing has changed lol
Here in December 2023 and nothing has changed since this interview
Just reddicks podcasts are great to  listen to during work shifts
Not calling out Simmons for the soft wuss that he is.
Im here to see if he is worth drafting in my NBA fantasy team, 🤘🤘🤘
JJ Redick should have zero credibility when it comes to interviews and what is said on them. Players go on his show because they know it will be extremely easy and sympathetic to them. Redick is a hack who will never ask players difficult questions and is a shill for the NBPA. It’s pathetic.
h,
I hope Ben can get his mind right and come back and prove us all wrong. If he can get back to playing winning basketball and having fun out on the court while doing so, I hope he takes the fines for refusing to speak to the media ever again.  That wouldn't just redeem him, it would redeem him in the ballerist of ways
come to new orleans Ben!!!
Lol. It looks like an ad for a bunch of products. That guy sucks and the nets sucked.
This was the greatest scam I've ever seen pulled on NBA fans. This actually had people convinced Ben was being treated unfairly lmfao he should've been treated worse by 76ers fans.
Welcome to Guangdong Ben! NI HAO NI HAO
Ben is actually more skilled than lebron, lebron is just more athletic
This interview made me lose interest in JJ's interviews, unfortunately. This was a big deal at the time of release, but it is a total soft ball interview basically criticizing everyone else and we don't really get any insight on what Ben was thinking. Like I get being nice to a struggling man, but why make it a podcast? It seems a lot more simple to think if you are being paid 40 mil a year you can't just do nothing.
This person is absolutely delusional
Guys, Simmons isn't delusional. He's not going to outright admit that he has zero confidence left, he's going to deny those accusations despite it being obviously the case.
SOFT
at the end of the day I would rather keep my friend then be correct about some dumb basketball conversation
Simmons needs to get out of his own head...and just play....
All y’all supporting this dude are the problem with the participation medal mentality of sports today. The city of Philly’s problem with Ben was always his   lack of TRUE accountability for that series, how he pouted and quit on the team and city afterwards, and his overall refusal to get better at ONE SINGULAR SKILL over his entire career so far. Every athlete has road blocks when you reach a high level. It’s how you respond during or afterwards. And he decided not to respond. Oh and made sure to get his money for sitting at home 🤔 can’t do that either
This is a poor show. JJR needed to ask Ben Simmons some tough questions.
Came back to tell the Philly fans that they were right and i apologize. I'm holding my head in shame for even thinking Ben would attempt to be good this season.
Wow it took this guy 3 years to realize it's important not to turn the ball over? Any 10 year old could tell you that.
Damn this did not age well - only 6 months later 😬
You can tell JJ is walking on eggshells, he doesn’t want to make Ben feel like he turned on him. So he’s being a little cheesy with him. JJ is very intelligent. Ben is really over sensitive you can see it in his eyes when asked anything remotely near the hard questions, most of his excuses are what other people are saying about him. Idk if his one way upbringing made him very sensitive and not be ready for the real world and his mind and emotions can’t take it. Idk if he’ll be ever to play at a high level again
Shoot it ben!! 😂😂
And now he's recently "injured". Yeah f*ck this guy..
This interview really aged well lmao, I like neither of them challenges what Ben claims
he quit on the nets to I thought he was gone be a great player he never worked on his game
this is when jj officially became washed
LETS GO SIXERS
Ben is baby bro, how do you need help from your teammates?? Soft
Ni hao
I always go back to this interview to laugh
Ben recieved a lot of hate last few months he is one of my favourite players and I believe he can get back to playing on all star level
Fast forward to now…yikes
As a Nets fan I coming back to this interview to give 76ers fans their flowers......u guys in Philly deserve my regret
This interview aged poorly
Never trust a person that throws away their natural accent (for him, Australian). They crazy people trying too hard.
He’s gotten worse this year . Love jj but the last thing Ben needed was u being a yes man . The shooter that u are u could’ve advised him much better
SOFTBALL QUESTIONS
Love JJ , but this interview was a joke. To see he's gotten worse this year shows why we all view Ben as the most delusional athlete known to man.
Ben Simmons is trash
Would be a DAWG, if his confidence translated to the court
Would love to see even year 1 Ben Back, you know he’s got it in him
Interview is trash
This aged like JJ s fine wine 🍷
This interview didnt age well
4 months later and this interview aged like milk lol.
“You should be at the gym” 😂 people are so entitled.  70% of sports social media is just the public shitting all over athletes, non stop comparisons and fans taking everything an athlete does personally.  Get over yourselfs ya egotistical pricks. Have some spaghetti
Bottom line. Ben is soft like applesauce. This generation is breeding weak men like rabbits.
This interview hasn't aged well for Ben.
Ben Simmons so fine
People needa lay off Ben a little bit. He’s a 26 year old young man trying live his dream out. People are way too hard on this dude.
I’m a Sixers fan and I’ll say this, I’ve always rooted for Ben, I always thought he was gonna be great, I never hated him or wanted him gone and I STILL root for Ben Simmons. He’s a player that we really don’t see too much in the NBA. He’s an all star, period.
Wish this man was as confident on the court as he is in interviews
glad to see he’s doing well 👍
great depth in the conversation👏
Ben Simmons was a beast in 2k21 no 🧢
This change things I kinda like Ben Simmons now,I mean im from NYC and he still can’t shoot, but the narrative change he gang  🤟🏽get us a chip, get ur first chip!
This dude is such a delusional little cry baby. I can’t count how many times he said I just want to win. But if you really wanted to win you would have learned how to shoot
Good interview, still does not change my mind about Ben.  Of course JJ is going to make him look good, JJ isn’t here to make players uncomfortable.    From everything Ive heard and read about Simmons, he’s an uncoachable baby.
Mess around and be a bust
All that time off he still got a mental block hard to listen to him talk, he really needs some help and take it serious
I honestly feel like JJ throws softball questions to everyone he interviews. He interviews them like his intentions is just to be able to get guest’s. Not to actually get them to reveal what everyone wants to know. Which is why most people watch.
Lol Ben not shooting threes this season
Screw Simmons. Hes a punk. He wasnt mental when he accepted the money These asswipe prima donnas make me sick
Awful interview. No hard nor direct questions. Just J.J playing the defend the player at all cost. I'll never watch this podcast again. Two thumbs down.
Disappointing to see how much JJ is telling Simmons what he wants to hear instead of what he needs to hear tbh. The last thing Simmons needs is Yes Men.
Back injuries is from a lack of conditioning we don’t feel sorry for you bro
He right tho the kyrie and kd elites players in the nba ain’t no guarding them jus gotta hope they miss
If he himself can’t admit shooting issue for him now ben Simmons gone be out the leave before he 30
51:55 Y’all are pretty corny and weird for playing it up like some attack on Ben specifically. Gerald Huston (the guy who did the prank) is widely known for doing this fake name mixup prank with celebrities and random lookalikes on a regular basis. It’s only “objectively not funny” to you because you think it was a personal attack at Ben exclusively. Also pretty convenient that Ben discovers an interview the guy did later but missed the part where he does this regularly (including doing so to Dejounte Murray right after the Paolo beef on Instagram).
Everyone has a story to tell. The real one though. . nice job you did it JJ. . mental health is not easy to deal with you need someone to help you come back to reality. . its not a joke. Media now a days is so hard and its too much. I hope everyone just keep your faith and better share your problem than being crazy solving it on our own. This podcast is helpful not only for Ben but to everyone and the lesson you get here. God bless everyone! 🤗👊 Thanks anyway to Jay Williams, I hope everyone has a guy like him.
Awwwww i kinda feel bad
Yes man Redick. Nice to make Big Ben getting worse. He is so trash in net, lmao
Ben is such a cool dude… he’s the key to the nets reaching this next level, hope he rediscovers his Sixers self 🗣️🗣️😤😤
When with this interview out people still be hating 💤💤
How about now? Yes tell a player that gets 40 million a year it is ok to be scared to shoot. How about his defense? The worst efficiency. Jj you know better. Don't Stoke his ego
Soft interview... Soft interview.. how you not go after him.. it seem like you were giving him a soft spot to land ...never liked you as a player .. anyway white boy who only shoots 3 point jumpers lol JJ you a clown factssss
i really like how tommy brings in perspectives from a non player's point of view
Ben gets cuter every time I see him😩😩
🧐🤨🧐🤨 All I see is praise
Coming back to this after his debut it only solidifies my point that Ben Simmons is the most pampered NBA player in history. You have Steve Nash talking about him like he’s a make a wish kid
I wish they talked about him playing for Aus
As an Aussie you can tell he is one of us by how much he says fuckn
F the stephen A’s skip shannon’s etc. With their stupid opinions…. JJ knows how to do it. 💪 pretty refreshing to hear simmons talk. Wish him te best and hope for him and the nets to have a big season.
That thumbnail 😂
woa I totally expected to hear an Aussie accent.. that was weird..
So mental health is the reason ben hasn’t  improved shooting for 5 years in the league.  Shooting has been trash wasn’t just that year.
Listening to this interview seems to me that Ben's looking for a mentor, and someone to support him get over this mental hump. Kind of reminds me of the pressure Lebron was under prior to joining forces with Wade. He's been in the league so long I forget he's only 26. He has a lot of potential if he can overcome his current challenges.
So nobody is gonna talk about 26:50 😭😭😭
Bens actually a really likeable humble dude
Just how Gilbert got rid of his first co host jj needs to do the same
Does anyone know what JJ's microphones are?
The groupchat thing is actually so funny bc if it's an iMessage group, there's glitches all the time where people in the chat randomly get kicked out without doing anything and it says "so and so left the chat" 😆😆
This guy is so fake, he can do an entire hour interview and say absolutely nothing, He doesn't even know how to be authentic and just articulate his thoughts. Every fiber of his being is wrapped up in trying to put on some sort of image. Everything is completely vague and clear he has never thought about it seriously for a minute. He has no clue about himself, he can only hope to say the things he thinks will make him appear likeable.
if I close my eyes I think it's Seth Rogen talking not ben lmao
Man if Ben went out there with his mindset of winning, and also the confidence to take high percentage shots when they make themselves present.. wow. It opens up the lane more for him and opportunities for his teammates.
Celtics fan here saying I wish Ben Simmons the best of luck. He’s easily one the most potentially best players in the league. Already is really, with some more confidence, some more composure, a smoother jump shot, and the right environment, he’s gonna be a top 5 guy easily imo.
28:00 yeah we missed on picks by drafting Ben smh
Still cant hit a free throw, hit a jumper, & even make a layup 😂 🗑🗑
He represents each facet of a snowflake
Anyone know they name of the wine?
14:13
24:40 thats all I need to hear. We want you back in Louisiana.  But that's neither here' nor there. I'm still  able to build a career around you in NBA2K.
If anyone is confused about the medical terms used, as a physio, I’ve made a video to help you understand it better!   Ben Simmons, back pain and whether it's bull?! https://youtu.be/dRMki5kTdWM  Hope this helps the basketball community understand back pain and Ben Simmons more!
Great interview excited to see what Ben does this year cant wait!
👍
I like basketball ever since I knew what it was... =)) I could hear the eye roll... you don't like it enough to learn freethrow and jumpshot?
Good
The video of the dude calling Ben Russell Westbrook was hilarious. Y’all trippin😂
That is why he never got better. He got to the league with the "I belong here" mentality. He is a great player. But he could be a Giannis level player, instead of an all star.
Ben Simmons... what a nice guy! I wish him the best in everything he does.
You need John wall
Yeah great interview and stuff...BUT most important for me as a sommelier: How was the Valentini Trebbiano and which vintage was it ?
At 25:06, YES, just go ahead & give em what they're asking for, Ben! Cool interview 😎
it was mental health and Ben wasn’t happy in Philly. that’s why that happened ✌🏻
See..... That's why it's hard to be critical of this man in-person: WHO DOESN'T want to look like the best version of themselves, or look like Ben Simmons?
aye man he’s a really chill guy bro, wish him the best bro
https://youtube.com/shorts/9RgN8aaapXo?feature=share
We need another BI interview
The Media in the 80’s and 90’s talked about true events Etc. Now it’s all made up stuff. I thought the Media had to speak truth. They just come up with stuff…   Ben S thanks so much for speaking your Truth. Game Time…   JJ Go Duke…
Interview Scottie Barnes
If you look at that play again he clearly saw Trae Young as he caught the ball in the post. The dude is a floor general and an incredible passer - are we really to believe that “all he saw was a jersey” once he spun? These lies and excuses really rub me the wrong way, I don’t see any growth in him.
Super
rootin for ben🫶🏾
It is a great video  for the gift.
Some few things that I found questionable… How does someone mistake a “Jersey” in a pocket for a phone???, he felt that it was a good enough of a excuse to skip weights because he was the strongest on the team?
Ben is so soft
As frustrating as it was for a lot of fans of basketball to see his lack of shooting, it was still unreal to see Ben play. I was more on the boat of if you look at all his accolades and what he's achieved at his young age, the ridicule is white noise. I miss him being on the court as one of the best guards and I hope he comes back fierce for Brooklyn and does well in his career. Having 2 of the best iso players in the game at Brooklyn and one of the best facilitators with 3 pt talent should be great for his game!
Let's go Ben 10. I'm rooting for you good brother
Did he take any accountability at all? Lmfaooo
There was no hard question dude baby 🍼 Simmon 😒
Remember no one, no not one man or woman is perfect
It's going to be interesting to see Ben comeback this season & seeing how  he's able to deal with the fans & media..... The Nets could be a threat if he's just at 80%
46:00 This Bozo totally made up that story about how he injured his back. You can just look in his eyes and tell he's lying🤡🤡🤡🤡
Ben Simmons is arrogant and takes no accountability as far as basketball goes.I have zero respect for him in the NBA. He does perhaps seem like a decent person  overall outside of the kids game he plays for $.
Glad Ben had a safe space to continue to avoid taking accountability for any of his actions.
I don’t want to toot my own horn smh I can’t with this dude that’s all his does
Oh it’s fun but he has not played in 2 yrs or what ever disgusting
So Ben isn’t mentally fit to play in the NBA.  Give the money back and go play cricket in Australia.
This clown knows exactly how to big himself up he always talks about himself in glowing regards but folds over criticism
Ric bucher is such a liar idk why people ever listen to him
soft
Imagine if Ben had JJ's shooting. Lol Lebron 2.0
Hearing him shoutout Escalade brought a tear to my eye…RIP big fella
You can tell they are actually really good friends and close. They both act diff around other people. JJs much more serious typically. I don’t think kd and kyrie and Ben have this type of relationship. Nor do I think kd wants one. Kyrie seems to like him better though.
great episode
JJ does a great job helping Ben dodge accountability
Dying for D Book
Crazy how clouded some people’s judgment can be. This interview changed my entire thought process on Ben. I feel he truly is a standup guy
Man I don't like having reasons to respect Ben Simmons
Not all Phillie fans, but more commonly than other places... They abandon their stars and treat them like trash.  Did it to Ben, did it to Iverson... Its a hostile work environment, they got to loosen up, or they will continue to run their success out of town (like they always do).
To me seemed like Ben was a reserved quiet guy it’s cool to see this side of him
You guys don't even know owner politics at all.  The process was an excuse for the money game the hedge fund owner had the GM playing for um using rookie and sophomore contracts, and getting bonus pay that significantly out performed his contract, and any GM's contract. Local media turned the process into Embiid, and Embiid adopted it.
Simmons favorite word is fuc lmaoo
Intro gots to go
Is this dvmbass gonna finally start shooting with his right hand? I was just rewatching Game 7 of Toronto n Philly and all his baskets came with the right hand 😂. Like he deserves all the criticism ever for not being better.
I been say this for years let any normal person or athlete have a back issue let’s see if you can get back on that court they did the same this with Dwight Howard. The body is so temperamental I herniated my T7 getting pushed in the back playing basketball and never been the same.
What are they drinking? Champagne or white wine?
During the process, did Ben’s 76ers ever get to the conference finals?
76ers take the East this year!!
Ben cool af wtf
I didnt know JJ was so good at Soft ball
Westbrook is better than Simmons so I’d take that as a compliment
I really like ben a lot more after this interview
Ben u are a snowflake
this dude is the biggest fraud in sports he came to get paid FOH
Dope
One thing i learned from this interview is that Ben is an excuse maker.
People confused a cell phone for a jersey like they are the same size 🤔?
JJ should bring lebron into the podcast & we’ll finally get to hear how anything and everything is affecting his legacy everyday
we need a AD interview
I’ll always be upset that we’ll never get one of these w/ Kobe. These are so amazing and shine a light on athletes in a way that is very unknown to the fans. This is the way modern media needs to transition.
https://youtu.be/zmoorYN8gvY ..Can we show this to Ben?
He said I was actually going up the stairs 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ben that nigga yo lol
Finally  we hear from Ben Simmons
Man it’s good this guy finally spoke. Because he seems cool as hell! He should market his personality. And his game is nice.
I love that hat Tommy is wearing!
He talks finally! Sometimes the worst place to be is inside your own head. shows that he’s working through his isht! good luck with Brooklyn,Kev & Kyrie definitely aren’t your go to’s ,so surround yourself with a good support group.
Known for defending but didn’t step up against kawhi and got sent home
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?   (Revelation 6:15-17)
“Huerter had 27 pts, and I was guarding the best player”. Ben did you just through your CURRENT teammate Seth curry under the bus for not playing defense well, but then barely take accountability for the loss in the series? Or am I just a 26yo person, the same age as Ben, hating on him. Or is it really not that hard to take accountability at that age???
My nets got a good one 😎
I hope he puts his misogynoir and bRo code aside with his step brother to mend his relationship with Olivia. It’s disgusting the way that whole family threw her in the bin and sold her out to side with a white privileged liar who abused her. Considering that whole family disowned her and her two kids for speaking her truth, to protect Ben’s  ‘brand’ and his scumbag lying half brother on his payroll, she is doing well to keep it together. Come on Ben- do the right thing by Liv. 😑
Rubbish interview. I love Ben and wish him all the best but he has to start taking full accountability for both his past and his future. He's not a victim.
😭😭 he really said hunter was the best player on the hawks, and this why I don’t listen to his BS now 😂
They should help him in the early stage, one footballer by the name Buffon (Italian )  which  had a legendary career there are phased which he depressed, the detected and attend to it
Lame
This whole podcast was just an opportunity for Ben to create more excuses for himself lmfao.
It's interesting how JJ said. Brett Brown told him, your the point gaurd. No one would care about the shooting if they were calling him a power forward. And I wonder if they did this because they knew it was not a good fit with Embiid.
One of my favorite interviews ever, and I've been watching the NBA since 1991. I'm surprised by how wrong I was about Ben as a person.  Really glad he did this with JJ, and it's kind of nice to know I can still be wrong about people every now and then. And it also serves as a reminder to not always believe what you're seeing on TV.   I've been in similar positions as Ben has in the past, so it's great to hear that he's doing better. Seems like a good young man. Sorry for pegging you wrong, and good luck during your rookie season.
Doesnt give a F about the money  But procedes to files a grievance to get money back like this guy is a joke and will not succeed 😊
Well Simmons coming out and doing this interview made him infinitely more likable.
My boy goin to the finals 😌
JJ this new one is not what I’m here for.  Too much first take making you a softy to active players?  Active players often get baby soft tasks…this is another lame one.  This wasn’t honest open or candid.
I’m appreciative JJ was able to do this interview, I also understand you must strike a balance between being a respectful Interviewer and asking the tough questions or pressing an issue. With that said, it was a solid interview, however JJ still allowed Ben to get away with answering questions by putting the blame on anything else and not take responsibility for his own actions in the situation. My opinion hasn’t changed on him, he lacks the ability to take accountability for what he does or does not do. Durning the interview Ben was able to pen point key actions the Sixers took that he felt was wrong, Spoke about Doc making him Practice during Practice (Let’s not forget he didn’t go back cause he thought it was the right thing to do, he went back for that 8 mil), talked Doc and Jojo saying they didn’t support him after the game with the Hawks, no they supported him and also held him accountable, they did not disrespect Ben in any way, then he talked about no one was gone to get on a plane to see him until last minute 😳, Ben grow up, might have been last min but they were still willing to come out to speak with you, they also have family and friends. Now when it came to himself, came to his faults and errors and time to be a man and be responsible, all he had to say was “I did something’s wrong on my end” he owned up to nothing. I understand the mental health issues and having nothing negative to say around that issue. Ben Simmons needs to grow up, drop the child like mentality and be a Man.
hearing simmons refer to Philly as "we" is certainly interesting
Too many softball and non-journalistic questions. Will anyone hold this young man accountable? I guess not.
Is that a bottle of Penfolds Grange in the background mate?
"you were hurt, obviously" hit different when Ben don't get offended
Anyone got a link on jjs glasses?
I’m a sixers fan , and I really hope Ben get back to being his old self if not better basketball wise . I always felt he didn’t deserve to be dragged the way he was
Never discussed if he ever told anyone about his issues if he wanted everyone to reach out? Communication my friend
This was an awesome and much needed talk with Ben Simmons. It is nice to have him able to speak his side of the story, clear up some total bs that got mixed in with whatever else happened. He seems like such a refreshing nice person. Someone who deserves a fresh start. That said, I think he will be great on the Nets, it is the best team he could have landed on. I'm really looking forward to seeing their games!
Yea JJ, we definitely wanted to listen to you drone on about nothing for 5 mins to start the show. Also it's kind of insane how Ben Simmons is more likeable and less douchey than JJ
Listening to this interview made me realize how dillusional Ben Simmons really is. I've heard about his lack of self awareness, but to hear it out of his own mouth... Dude thinks  he is God's gift to basketball and can't acknowledge any of his own faults. Glad I saw this, because all of my previously established opinions about him were validated.
Bro we wanted you to play basketball nothing more 😂😂😂
lol
That guys name is Gerald Huston or Gerald hudston. He does these pranks on celebrities all the time. Like he call Rajon Rondo Chris Paul.
shut up bro you literally have not owned up too anything, just excuses.. and need pitty SMH!
Everyone who sees this: You're beautiful, and never give up your dreams, you are in this world for a reason! Lots Of Life 🙏
Here you see the pros and cons of a pro player podcast.  It's good to have a former player's insights into the game, but then you also have a softball interview like this where it's mainly fluff and patting Simmons on the back.  It looks like Simmons has learned nothing from the past and still takes almost zero accountability and is still playing the victim and having excuses. Would have preferred if Shaq/Barkley did the interview.
Plumbers and firemen have stronger mental fortitude then Ben
NBA and and 1 two different things make sens is mentality. I thought his dad played?
Simmons is a bigger w@FEhashtag than I thought,your no winner you're a Sook it up lo$er
His work ethic if doesn’t change and maybe kyrie and kevin can spark something different . And maybe around a very more talented team will hold him back . It takes more than he knows.
This showed a lot Ben wanted it easy all I kind of heard from him that’s extremely tiring and he wanted easy buckets. The way people play phila that was never going to happen and I’m not sure if people play New York harder but interesting to see how he fairs in ny interesting conversation felt there were many over the head puns too but u know lol we miss u jj def I’d take steph and jj back any day
He's gonna..WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE GOT HERE, Me to death😂😂 I swear
Why didn't he mention imbied
Chump.
I gald he got out of Philly philly is annoying
Never stopped being a fan even though everyone turned on him. Philly fucked him over bad by making him a PG in the first place. Then they turn around and throw him under the bus while knowing all along he was having mental issues prior to the whole debacle in the playoffs. Then they turn around and demonize him and allow the media to do it as well. I can’t wait to see him come back and remind people he averaged 16/8/8 that same year they tried to say he was trash. Embiid is also a major a-hole that hides behind jokes and being likable. But he throw his teammates under the bus quite a bit.
Winners don’t make the same mistakes in the playoffs for multiple games.
JJ’s glasses?
I am glad Ben finally spoke his piece after all this time but he still sounds like he hasn’t learned anything and very immature and not holding himself accountable for anything he did in Philly besides the shot he’s laughing alot and not even serious half the interview otherwise good work JJ for even getting him on the show
Didn’t expect shots fired at my pacers lol
D’ing luka all night is crazy, pause
Thank you guys
😢
Kawhi is my favorite player, but I must admit King Kawhi 🤴🏽 did get a running 🏃🏿 start. Hey it happens....🤣
Haven't watched yet but I will say this. My frustration with Simmons has always been on court related. I thought the jokes were funny at first but how many times can y'all laugh at the same burn? And it became pretty obvious that something to the degree of anxiety or panic attacks was going on. It's not funny at that point. Good riddance, he was never gonna grow in Philly but that don't mean i wish him ill in his personal life
This man ruined something that could have led to NBA history apart from a title in Philly. We could have watched teammates be MVP & DPOY possibly at the same time…
This had to be the softest interview ever. Bro..  get it together.
JJ is an excellent interviewer and doing a great job with the podcast, but he's got to get rid of this other guy. Adds zero value, and just randomly blurts out extremely dumb questions that create an awkward environment. Like if you're not the athlete you got to at least be the super smart knowledgeable one.
The thumbnail is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Whether fake or not, he seems like a better human being then Ive ever been able to give him credit for, like his ego isn't as toxic as it has seemed since he was drafted into the league and I am from UT
I’m quite disappointed that there was no questions about Simmons bailing on his country at the Olympics. That matters to us and is where he lost the majority support of his home country.
You can’t say he’s lying about wanting win. Dude is pass first and said defense is Fun lmao. Sounds like a great teammate to me
Ask some real uncomfortable questions man stop trying to be everyone’s friend
Would've liked to see him accept some of the responsibility in what happened. Don't think he's a bad player or bad dude but you can't exclusively blame others, owning up to making mistakes is the best way to move on.
Typical softball interview from the pampered athlete…guy sits there and calls out everyone but himself for the 76ers collapse and NO ONE thought to follow up on it??? Whatever
I see why Jimmy wanted out of Philly 🥱
This was not an interview..... It was a babying behaviour to Ben from JJ.... I can understand their relationship, but for us, the viewers, totally useless.... They talked about Shaq hating Ben.... has Shaq anything to earn from all this? One thing came out from this "interview"... Ben can't be accountable for his actions.... spoiled guys... Preriod..
When you ask him if he has a specific moment he remembers from the 16-0 its very clear he doesn't remember it at all and is just bullshiting
What's with the American accent Ben?
Thank you for getting Ben Simmons on. I gotta say, I feel bad for Ben now. For all the stuff he was going through and the fact that I was just like everyone else and kinda hated him too.  Really hope that Ben is in a good place now and that would make some really interesting basketball to watch with KD and Kyrie.
So this tommy guy thinks he gonna talk junk to shaq🤣🤣  sweet Jesus what is this world coming to😂 personal attack?? An analyst who is paid to talk, talked about an nba player.  Omg!! I cant believe an analyst did that😂
Nice video
49:40
My boy Gerald Huston with the plug in the interview 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 workin and btw it was funny cause Ben got in his feelings 😂😂
Very good Interview
Ben: “No one’s guarding Kevin”   While he got shut down vs Celtics 1st round last season…
Love the episode, glad you're back! Would be nice if the copy for the TommyJon underwear ad was more sensitive and not using/emphasizing the word SAVAGE in that way. Really feels insensitive to Native Americans.
He may not have handled everything perfectly but I didn’t like the dogpile. I never doubted the injury
Finally! Simmons is back.  It is crazy how underrated he is/was.  He wasn't a scorer but affected the game in many ways.  It does seem with all the injuries and the talks, it really got to his head so its good to see him back and hope he expands from there.
Love the show but guys please get a line up!
I'd love to see a big three of Ben Tre and Jalen Brown they literally cover each others weaknesses perfectly and if Ben plays the center with two solid team defenders (KCP and Jae Crowder for example) the team would be unstoppable
Tfw bootyhole brian robinson, being shot and all, comes back before Ben Simmons.
Respect to Ben! Mental health is definitely not easy to get out of.
Ben Simmons was given everything. He not only does not appreciate how easy his life has been, but refuses to work hard to become more worthy of his position. I can shoot better than this dude. A lot better. There is no excuse. Stop capping. Ben Simmons is a physical gift who doesn't try hard to build his skill whatsoever. A spoiled bratt.
JJ Barea is the man!!! Best basketball podcast right now!
Fire interview! JJ youre the best at this bro
I appreciated his accountability. It's a very endearing piece.
Whats the brand of sunglasses?
Great Listen JJ and Tommy .. gained a lot of respect for Ben and it was nice to hear his side of things and to get to know him better
As a Philly native born and raised Ben definitely helped bring the flare back to Philly basketball because it was bad for at least 5 yrs
This was great
Ben is intellectual and well rounded however he is not a black American and I believe that's why he doesn't have that dog in him to go over the line.
Ben is the Aaron Rodgers of the nba
0 accountability and we keep making mental health and buzz word in cases theres no accountability
People made a big deal of the Trae Young pass because it was reflective of his play that series. He averaged 9.9 points a game with 4 of those games being single digits.  I think what bothers me was that he wants everyone to validate his feelings but can't validate the frustration from his own teamates with his play.
1:13:50 Is this tampering?   If so, as someone who is broke and has no power over anything, I'd like to declare myself podcast commissioner.  You have both been fined $10k, please DM me for payment. (Seriously it might save me from going homeless).  In all seriousness, great podcast. As someone who has dealt with a lot of mental health issues in the past I can wait to see Ben overcome this season. I just wish they'd trade Kyrie so it would be easier for me to root for his team too. Either way I'm still rooting for ya Ben...
Hi
I feel the half truths and half lies hes working with. If it wasn't about the money then why fightbto recoup the loss?
Sounds like B/S needs to hear more from 76 side
Served up a lot of softballs lol
You know as a young NBA star that you're going to get that money sooner or later, so it's not a high or pressing priority. You made big money already and still have time to make up for any money lost. Most people can't think like that because they don't have that kind of money and can't make that choice, or they could lose their home or even their life.
I am glad that he is finally opening up and talking.
He dosnt sound like he has a confidence issue
I didn't realise how shallow and dumb ben Simmons is until this interview.  my 8yo son is more articulate than Ben simmons, can BS better than ben simmons. He cannot even explain the job of a pg properly. poor nets.
He just is 26 and he was what like 24 when he made that mistake? Philadelphia is ridiculous. Give the kid a break and stop being loco.
Nets need and can just rely on his strengths. If he adds a great jump shot great but they don’t need that. Just play off what made him a star.
Keep deleting comments to cover up this weakass bum .Doc defended him every game before that last game. Snowflakes
way too much meat left on that bone, at least challenge him a bit   I see now why Rob Parker is always bitching and moaning about these player to player interviews.
I think I speak to many that tommy is annoying and doesn't offer much.
If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on Brooklyn this season. They might have the most talent of any team in the league.
Told yall media screw over black players  for more ratings
Great interview.
Damn everyone is so quick to forgive Ben. Oh a handsome charismatic millionaire speaks 'his truth', of course yall are gonna trust him. But actions speak louder than words and just cause he might be able to sound sincere, his actions say otherwise. Dude has had serious motor questions his entire career, and his play has warranted all the criticism hes got. He quit on his team plain and simple and from the outside it appeared he used 'Mental Health' as an excuse once there was no other options.   Ben's prob a cool guy and whatever but almost all criticism held against him was been warranted and he doesn't deserve sympathy, another chance maybe but no sympathy.
Cmon JJ, Pacers had a great team from 12-14
simmons is a cry baby, don’t believe in all that he said. mofo full of excuses
JJ a gem but his pacers take or comment about being up there is the process just don't do what the pacers done past 20 years stupid lol almost took out the heat very close series w PG
(Lumbar vertebrae) Lv4-Lv5 degenerative discus. Sciatica. I had the same thing. I know exactly how that felt, and I’m not even an athlete. Looking forward to see your game, Ben!
I have nothing against Ben Simmons. And I'm not even a Philly fan or have a fav team. I just like watching the games. But all I heard was excuses. He was clearly shook and not himself in the the Hawks series regardless of outside influences, you have to play better or those criticisms are valid. And they clearly were. And then he doesn't play for a whole year to be able to prove critics wrong. So as far as we know, he is still that guy who will get shook in big time moments and can't shoot. And everybody should have that opinion of him till he gets on the court and proves people wrong. Even doing well in the regular season should not change people's minds. He's shown to be a great regular season player but when it really matters, he's nowhere to be found. So the only way to prove people wrong is to make it to the playoffs and do well in the playoffs. Until then, I still think Simmons is a dude who gets in his feelings and pouts till things go his way while not even playing great or playing at all.
"My peace is more valuable than money" 🔥🔥🔥
We as sixers fans wanted him to be great.  I was fine with him not shooting but if he wasn't going to shoot he needed to drive to the rim and create 3pt play chances that way. So that means he would need to hit free throws. Then eventuallyhe would collapse the defense and hit easier open looks for dimes on the perimeter. Like lebron does. We needed more out of him.  We were always shown clips of him shooting in the off-seasons and it just never happened.
Hey look!! It’s the guy from 2k!!!
GREEDGLE
I don’t think Ben is a bad guy or bad basketball player but he lacks accountability. Just isn’t that humble for a guy who hasn’t played in the NBA for 1.5 years. He will be humbled again, but I hope he eventually figures it out.
Ben Simmons: I don't care about the money lol
I've always thought Ben was great, annoyed when he didn't play last season but man is a talent, and could conceivably build up a jump shot
14:56 and this is boring... Looks scripted.   I am clicking away this is boring
A master class in the humble brag
Simmons hasnt learned much.
All yall owe ben a damn apologize
After hearing this, I hope people look at him in a different light when he gets back on the court.
Glad to see Ben interviewing and talking things out.  I hope his journey back is filled with nothing but success...except against my SIXERS!!!  I still going to boo the sh!t out of him though.
17:42 I'm sorry 😂
Ben just a chill dude fr
was looking forward to a draft
Can we agree Ben can do everything except shoot? Every other player is at least trash at 1 thing if not 2.
Ben still one of my favorite players
Cept he didn’t travel
I do not mean this as a dis, but this is exhibit A on how dumb that one and done rule is
"Brooklyn net Ben Simmons" still sounds fake. Lol
Great podcast episode.
This is the most bias interview I have ever seen, like damn jj your babying him thru every question to try not make him uncomfortable 😒 just let him answer the tough questions with u kissing his behind before every question
im so happy so see him talk and listening to his side of the story im deff looking forward to see what he does this season
trae young 200 pounds had me weak lmao
“I couldn’t guard these guys when I was 25! What are you doing to me?!” 😂😂
👑 💪🏾💪🏾
This interview can be a blessing, a curse and a reality check.  The blessing is that he is telling his side and how he has felt over the year and a half since what has been his defining moment in the NBA.  Unfortunately, the curse is having to replay that moment over and over again in your head and know you passed up a chance that you may never get again.  That in many ways is why he waited so long to talk about.  The reality is everyone goes through something but it is how you handle the situation that defines you ultimately and the last time the world saw Ben Simmons in an NBA basketball game, the moment defined him.  He will have every opportunity to get back to being the  player he was but when that defining moment presents itself again, what will he do?  The answer lies within himself but will he seize the moment, only time will tell.
It definitely felt great to watch Doc and Joel fall apart in the playoffs after blaming him for the teams melt down.. hopefully he can cone back and have a great season with Brooklyn..
I’m curious about all these fini pizza boxes
All you are hearing is excuse from someone who wants to be cuddled.....weak minded individual but was not when cashing those checks
I get the interview but I didn’t hear them address his shooting, the reason why people started disliking him is because he never would shoot, all the parts of his game was great and people wanted him to shoot so he could be a threat inside and out so it would open the floor!  With a good shot opposition don’t know if he will pull up or drive to the basket, and it would force double teams if he had a shot, to get others more open. I didn’t hear JJ ask him why he didn’t work on his jumper, but we saw him shooting in summer pick up games online? Why?
This is a good interview… well balanced and took up all the supposed issues and scandals… even the candy store! keep grinding JJ … lose the glasses next time though.
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine 💖
Geaux tigers
$63,000,000 , he didn't work a single day.. and he's here complaining and asking for sympathy. What a douche.
The wine ?
I can’t imagine KD being open and Ben Simmons taking the shot lol 😂
Why were the Spurs successful?  Bruce Bowen guarded Kobe.  If Brett Brown was smart, he would have used Ben more in that capacity.  Instead he asked Ben to be PG AND guard the Kobe of each team.  God Bless Ben!!! Go out there and win DOPY and a chip this season!
Worth the months wait💪
Shoutout to JJ for being a good dude and rooting for his friend. I still don't believe Simmons and think he's just trying to spin the PR to his favour but good interview none the less.
I love the way jj wear sunglasses but we ll still can see his eyes from that angle😀🤣
Clicked on this so fast mannn.
JJ is lying he’s wearing shades to hide his laughing and tears 😂 lol
Ben just go and play.... and do what you know you can do!
Soft
I just cam because Ben Simmons has the sweetest face just look at him 😍
Of course he’s not gonna give his buddy the tough questions
Its not that you’re creating shots for other players,, its the fact that they’re leaving you wide open and you wont shoot the damn ball.. Like that open dunk you passed up!!
Say what you want about, when you do say something about him, make sure you mention that he is a DAWG! 6’10 DAWG
Chronic pain, and especially back related pain and injury is no joke. And if you've never dealt with it, I can't imagine you'd ever be able to truly understand.. glad to hear Ben has had it addressed. I hope he stays healthy.
@17:30 “You’re D’ing Luka all night ..” gotta pause old man
This is a joke
good to hear his side....
To all the people saying we don’t need a players view of things, you’re so wrong. Do you really believe media was in a good place for things like the Athletic or pods like this?
I been rooting for this guy. I was pissed when the knicks didn’t grab ben.
It was not his jersey in his pocket
Why my guy sound like a 40 y/o surfer
Excuses excuses boo hoo point blank period he needs to stop acting and playing like a bum 🤷🏾‍♂️
He’s so arrogant that it’s tuff to watch him talk
The audacity to come on here and say shaq and Charles are meanies. He has been in the league for a while now and can't hit a layup over trey young embarrassing. You are one of the reasons your team lost you were the other superstar on your team and you haven't worked on your game in years. Matter of fact you haven't done anything period until you do something they don't have to respect you. Respect is earned.
Great PR job by a quitter. But let’s celebrate him for coming on a podcast keeping make excuses for himself.
Him and Claxton out there that’s gonna be a pretty good line
Ben Simmons has the best chance to having a triple double this year with a healthy season.
Great episode, can't wait for that first game :) Go Nets
I love this interview. This reinforces my belief that a number of NBA players nowadays just want to be coddled. Come on, man. 😆
An hour long interview of him not accepting any blame from what happened and not addressing his teammate Embiid loves everyone else except his former costar and possibly the fans doesn’t even mention Embiid once 😂
Dammit, I’m a Ben Simmons fan now.
sofT
Oh what a fkin baby
ben softer than charmin
I actually want to believe this guy but he just makes it so hard. He says the biggest thing was getting his mental right and not about money but when he was asked why he went back to practice he said he wanted to do the right thing. What are you trying to do right by coming to practice when you already told the team you didn't want to be there? Instead of getting your mental right, you show up to practice on a team you don't want to be on and with teammates that you said you felt weren't there for you when you needed. Why put yourself in that situation when you could be getting your mental right? If money isn't the answer then what is it?
When you are making the amount of money Ben is making, you have to be more than a defending and passer. Work on your game young man. On offense you are a liability and until you become an offensive asset you are an overpaid Scottie Pippen.
CLOWN
“Mental health” is a buzz word nowadays and mental health is VERY important. Respect to Ben for sharing his side but some of it does sound like a lot of excuses. Regardless, he is a great player and sending positive vibes for a wonderful career. 💯
Shout out raf stone for not bringing this fruitcake to the H 🚀🚀🚀
Happy for Ben but he still doesn't understand why the media and people are telling him to go to the gym instead of posting car photos on IG. Lol. Guess why Joel, KD, Maxey and other stars can post cars or whatsoever on IG and don't hear any negative comment from them? Guess what? The dude still doesn't understand that he has to improve.. smh
Looking forward to seeing you play in Brooklyn Ben, even though not a Nets fan.
Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as a niche and within it a lamp: the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a star Durriyyun, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth, though no fire touched it.   The exact translation of the saying is, “I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”
There is nothing Aussie about this guy
Is it me or did Ben still not explain why he wanted out from philly? let me tell you the real reason since he doesnt want to say it. Dude was scared of the backlash once he came back because of the atlanta series. He knew he cost them that series and was scared of heat he was about to take after what he pulled that series. Im still mad about that and glad hes outta here. We are much better team without him in my opinion
I have never seen a player treated so unfairly. And even if I have doubts about the Nets for the upcoming season, i hope Ben is healthy and can show what he can do. Good luck!
Ben is always made out to be the villian but yet Doc has never taken responsibility for being the root of the cause of the problems they had with Ben.  As a coach, you always keep your opinions to yourself if you don't truly believe in a player you never tell the media that.  Those critical of Ben would never accept if their boss criticized them publicly so why expect someone else to do that.
i must be high ash . i sat there and listened to them spam saying “that’s money” for the cash app advertisement 😭
This mans the biggest fraud out 😂😂😂 softie
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
Thank you JJ. I don't think Ben would have gave this interview to anybody else. You brought the best out in him you made him feel comfortable you were an ultimate professional. It's nice to see him with a little bit of confidence and smiling again I can't wait to see what kind of season he has
Enjoyed that Cash App ad at the beginning waaaay too much
He's full of s#*t!!!!! He's just pushing his narrative. He sitting there acting like he never did nothing wrong in the situation.
How many excuses will this guy come up with? Grow up and stop moaning. Boring interview with a lot of pampering…please!
Thank you JJ for providing Ben a platform to express his thoughts freely.
JJ goes MIA then comes back with a Ben Simmons interview...... master class
I can't wait to see Philly beat the Nets this year.
Reading these comments.he has all y’all fooled.and using mental illness as a scapegoat is weak.he will never change as long as y’all keep making excuses for him.
What a shame. This was a great chance for Ben to show accountability but he did not own up to his behavior. JJ and Tommy did not do Ben a favor by avoiding criticism and blaming the entire world except Ben.
Kevin is open nope I’m pulling up for 3 next season 😂 dope interview
Salute ben he will be just fine stay focused ball out this year a lot of our favorite players ain’t get a a 3ball game till later in they career I can go down a list
Don't need this interview to support you. I am a fan aways
this man is as soft as tissues.
Tommy asking a question just gives me second hand embarrassment. Like cmon dude structure the question appropriately.
Intro gangsta asf.
What is seriously sick douchebag
Is that a set or a real kitchen?
No one wants Bum Simmons,  why would they , he’s soft AF.
Great
can u pls get book on
JJ Reddick, Jay Will, Grant Hill and Jay Bilas should have a halftime show (their own network) called “Blue Devils” that cover different basketball games college or nba maybe WNBA
Does anyone know what the brand of sunglasses JJ wears for this interview?
Phillys biggest problem was signing Tobias Harris over Jimmy Butler smh
The problem with this new media is they don’t hold players accountable. I still hear a lot of excuses. I hope ben can talk to a real one without any agenda but to tell him what he did right, and what he did wrong.
love everything about this
A jersey in his pocket? Pfffft. Yeah right.
BBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNN SIMMMMMMMONNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
As someone who’s had two lower back surgeries. I get how his back has just blown out and how painful it is. Always felt he was getting way to hard of time
The algorithm blocked JJ after Jerry West Flamed him… welcome back this is fire.
I hope he wins MVP DOPY award Comeback player award and championship to shut up everybody up
Literally everything he said was a lie...  Especially the jersey part. I laughed so hard at that.
Dude saying his draft night was long as the #1 pick speaks volumes
Just one thing, shaq and chuck criticized embiid, they had a short back and forth and eventually Embiid accepted the criticism from those guys.  He been an mvp finalist since.  Just saying, and shaq and chuck are not doing a wholesome charity for players they are payed to criticize you as they deem fit...
Didn’t hear much accountability and JJ never pushes back. It’s just one big yes man conversation. Like ask why did “mental health” only come up after and why he filed a grievance to recoup his money if he didn’t care about the money.
the come back is going to be sooo strong. Nets chip
I love doc rivers as a coach but he handle the Ben situation wrongfully if thybul or whatever his name go 2 for 2 at the line do we still have that conversation ?? NO !! Doc shouldn’t have called him out if you feel he was that bad bench him that’s what a real coach would have do no matter who he is !!! All and all I’m glad he in a better situation
I thought JJ did a poor job here. Ben seemed to be open but JJ and Tommy didn't ask any tough questions or follow ups. They really missed out on giving Ben the chance to tell his side of the story.
Great show n interview.  Good for Ben being able to field some soft questions.    I can see him turn into something like Andrew Wiggins story. Which is good cause Wiggins still getting a bag for being 3rd best on a championship team n made it to an all star game.
Great fuckin interview
Bens not american either
Agree with Shaq. Let's keep JJ doing the asking and keep Tommy as the decor/NPC.
So Embiid voted JJ off the island for his boy Jimmy. I hated when JJ got traded. He was to the team exactly what Ben describes. Love his knowledge and energy!
Ben Simmons is a diva
So pretty much JJ confirmed that he’s a fraud
Simmons is fake asf
🔥🔥🔥💨💨💨🥶🥶🥶💣💣💣💯💯💯#NETS#LETSGOBEN
JJ Reddick is a Real One, huge Ben Simmons fan glad he was on the podcast and I guarantee he will have a great come back season.
This is such an American attitude to the game. You ask the Europeans, they don’t care if they play shot as long as they win and they don’t let the outside effect their game. An American who’s been hyped up since a teen, when they’re not an instant. NBA is broke because people forgot it’s a team game
Mad respect for saying his peace in this interview but man he still has a lot of maturity to build...
Not gonna lie Ben seems way cooler than I thought
understand the mental issues...but dude is SOFT...sorry...this generation is way too SOFT...Ron Artest, Dennis Rodman had issues too but they went out there and played at a high level without any excuses on the floor...he was exposed for a lack of shot and not growing his game and he crumbled
basically he say he´s not accountable for anything...
🐃🐃🥃🥃🌱let’s go Simmons
This is a buddy buddy interview didn’t ask the tough questions
Ben acting like the dunk was the only problem and not his record breaking awful free throw % too
I don’t believe Ben.
ya'll aint gonna talk good about Ben after listening to what Shaq had to say about this recently and Austin Rivers publicly called Ben a liar after this podcast. Ben Simmon is a joke and dude doesn't deserve any money in NBA
Wow hope Ben goes hard af this year
this is what we all wanted hearing his side I'm excited to hear what he has to say
habitual liar, and all 1st team crybaby. rooting for his downfall
It's easy to see why the Players go on these podcasts; they don't attack each other, while still asking pointed questions   It's good to 👀 that he seems to be better mentally, which I'm hoping translates to the floor.   Good Luck this coming season Ben!
It was a Jersey?!?????!!! #jerseygate #phonegate No wonder this guy has "mental health" issues...
Why is this dude lying? So he wants us to believe that an adult jersey was able to fit inside his gym shorts? He wanted to leave the Sixers before the start of his last season. But he doesn't want to tell the truth and keeps putting on the comments made by Doc and Embiid. He also lied about the Gerald Hudson candy store incident.
I think it’s great we finally hear some of what Ben was going through and his thoughts. He’s a great player and we want him to do well.  However also,  I think JJ and the podcast coddled him a bit through the interview and there was a lack of real accountability.  BOTH sides Philly org and Ben were wrong in some ways.  Still seems that Ben is deflecting the real issues instead of saying “look I did x y z this was wrong , I can do this better by etc” I didn’t really get that. You can tell he’s still thin skinned.  This is in no way discounting mental health issues because that’s real!
"I am who I am"..same words he used after that game 7 debacle vs Hawks
Ben needs to focus on assists and rebounds..no need to worry about shooting with Durant and Kyrie there. Maybe a few lay ups or dunks a gm
pacers fan here, its trash man.... nobody cares we made the playoffs 20 years straight or whatever the hell it was
These comments seem so generic lol.
how is dude saying he's gonna work on it and get better at shooting when he's had years to get better?!!! Just get better
This dude says that Shaq shouldn't speak on things that he doesn't understand..... How can we understand Ben if he never tells anyone what his real issues are? Guy is full of excuses.
But why should anyone guard you in the half court when you're on the perimeter?
Best interview from JJ so far
Sounded like excuses. Who cares dunk that mfer and yeah you cost that philly game vs Atl Trae is 6'1 bruh 😂
I'm glad he did this interview. Is there another floor general that defends the best player and shoots?
I honestly didn't know much about him other than being a good defender,being drafted high,and the collapse against Atlanta. I like him more after this interview.  Edit: Also,is he gonna play forward for Brooklyn?
Great as always - a great new media format, addressing all relevant topics, no dissing and giving players a fair platform, quality talks and fun to watch while being relevant on all content and conversation topics
As nice of a chat this was, it was mainly an opportunity for ben to look great on camera, not much else. Ben still does not show any accountability for his behavior, does not seem humble or that he learned much from that situation in Phily. It seems like that he sees this situation as something that is happening to him and not something he has created and his whole approach seems to be to learn to deal better with the outcome and not change in the first place.
Let Ben be the PG and Kyrie at the 2, Ben will Ball OUT!
Respect
ben simmons still ridiculously soft and contradictory... check out shaq's response
the beginning of this interview hearing him toot his own horn makes me sick. you can tell hes perfectly content with who he is right now as a player. when kids gain so much success so early, whats the motivation for him to get better? its not money, its not his teammates. the answer is nothing. he is what he is and thats enough for him. desire is what seperates the good from the great.
Every team is gonna send him to the line next season when the pressure is on.
Well start apologizing to your daddy Jerry West
Happy their friendship was able to finally get him to talk
At least the Pacers actually truly competed against great team's. 76ers couldn't even compete against trash team's.
Ufffffffffffffffffff 🥰.. https://youtu.be/7Icb-HAgbDc
I see a whole lot of deflection here, I predict this guy hasn't stepped up his game one bit yet another season... We shall see
This is a great interview, but this sounds literally like Ben being Ben. As a sixers fan and someone who's been emotional attached for decades:  Sounds like JJ was going soft, which I understand cause the politics.  But seriously as a sixers fan, this sounds like the same  Ben.  Don't believe this bs. Ben is and forever will be an amazing player who underachieved and brings too much drama for what he's worth. Period.  People need to stop enabling him and coddling him like JJ did in this interview. We all know he's good. But that doesn't matter everyone in the NBA is good. He's gotta be better. Period.
I'm sorry Ben just soft...if he needs people to like him in order to play basketball at a high level it's only downhill from here
Sen Bimmons
Brilliant interview. Thank you for this. Respect
He comes off as really annoying
this dude is just so full of it. i cant take anything he says seriously. f
We waited a year for this trash PR interview. Where is SAS or someone that’s going to get some real questions.
His worst mistake was getting rid of Tinashe. I will let the shooting struggles slide. But Ben Simmons not trying to be with that dime, he is a fool.
Lol I give it til the All Star break before he fully wears out his welcome in Brooklyn too
Beautifully done, JJ💯
He’s ready
Just here to leave a friendly reminder that this interview was trash, and ben simmons is a lying piece of garbage
A lot of respect for Ben after this interview. Hoping he has an incredible season and the Nets can silence all the doubters.
Ben Simmons is cool asf.
I honestly wasn’t a fan I believed the slander. Now I’m rooting for Ben.
He finally didn’t pass on a interview
Ben Simmons is so soft this dude never winning a chip ong
hate wat happen n Philly but i stand by that he's a top 15 player mid range away from top 5 3 pointer away from top 3
Love these inside stories from players. So much hate on this man and others in the league. Remember they are human. Also, anyone know what hat JJ is wearing? Need that in my life
Even if Philly made it to the finals in 2019 they wasn’t beat the warriors
Jj love this !
Yawn 🥱
As a pacers fan from Indiana, I did like that part where you said you don't want to do what the pacers did, it was something I've been frustrated with and didn't hear many people talk about. Why be just good enough to make the playoffs if you can't or won't make it out of the first round and it doesn't look like you re really going to get much better. I'm glad we finally started a rebuild. Long time fan of JJ and Duke. Love the podcast.
Low key most of the criticism was fair in my opinion. They only talked about Ben because he was the #1 pick and an all star on a contending team with clear and obvious holes in his game. If Ben was on a mid team with no expectations no one would care. But because he was on Philly with expectations we wanted to see more. We have seen Embiid raise his level of play and want to see Simmons do the same because he was massive potential! Him not shooting from the perimeter and shrinking the floor for his teammates throughout his career plus then passing up that layup....what else you want people to say? Then when Embiid says we lost the game when Ben passed up that shot? Come on 😭
Ben needs to be on the warriors
As a real fan I respect ban 2 way but as a hooper you gotta improve hit at least 2 3s a game is not crazy
this dude is 100% cap
I believe 37.2% of what comes out of Bens mouth.
JJ podcast top 5..... Let's get to it!!!
A great interview, but JJ missed a perfect opportunity here to give Ben a chance to react to the single most important criticism he gets:  - @20.30 Ben is defending his decision not to shoot because he's trying to "win" and make "winning plays".  JJ needed to put to Ben that often - particularly in pressure playoff games - the winning play for Ben was to be aggressive with his shot to take pressure off Joel and other scorers who were being shut down.  Those are the "winning plays" Ben has never wanted to make, because he doesn't have enough confidence in his shot, and his fear of being ridiculed. The sad thing is even a shot and a miss would be better than no shot at all in many of these situations. It would have been nice to hear that question from JJ.
Well done to JJ and the other guy for creating an environment where we can see Ben Simmons as himself for the first time maybe ever. Ben comes across as a genuinely likeable guy and I wish him all the best. As an Aussie who only wants to see him succeed, I wish we could see him talk like this more often.   That said, JJ missed a perfect opportunity here to give Ben a chance to react to the single most important criticism he gets:  - @20.30 Ben is defending his decision not to shoot because he's trying to "win" and make "winning plays".  JJ needed to put to Ben that often - particularly in pressure playoff games - the winning play for Ben was to be aggressive with his shot to take pressure off Joel and other scorers who were being shut down.  Those are the "winning plays" Ben has never wanted to make, because he doesn't have enough confidence in his shot, and his fear of being ridiculed. The sad thing is even a shot and a miss would be better than no shot at all in many of these situations. It would have been nice to hear that question from JJ.  It's clear from this interview that Ben feels extremely defensive about having to justify his merits as a player, and who could blame him considering the barrage of criticism he has faced since entering the League.  Ultimately though, I think Ben would personally benefit from being less defensive in his reactions ("I guard 1 through 5! I do other things!") and instead just openly accept his weakness (shooting) needs more work if he's to elevate to the next level. Some open honesty there would go a long way to fans giving him an easier time.   This interview was literally the first time I've ever heard him admit shooting is a weakness for him, so credit to him for that.  Good luck in Brooklyn Ben I'll be cheering for ya.
If Ben plays well as a PG the Nets goin to the Finals
Much appreciation to You Three Gents, and everyone involved for this. That was clarity in perfection.
Peaky blinder reference - 40:09 Myself talking to myself (partial quote) Full - “Just myself talking to myself about myself - Tom Shelby
The fact this got pulled off with Ben always being quite and kinda elusive makes JJ the goat. Enjoyable episode
Was always a supporter of Ben.....I wondered about the truth and now I know....the only issue I had was they keep saying Embid and Doc threw him under the bus...just plainly not true....  If you transcript the podt game interview you see Doc supporting most of the interview, even saying "he did his job" when a question about Trae Young stats came up there was only one part pused after when asked if Simmons could be a championship point guard for them he said honestly he did not know.  Could that mean he could be better at another position and this was after peppering him with question after question where he did not criticize Ben.  Concerning Embid.....he said when asked about the turning point that it was a Trae three, the not taken dunk and him turning over the ball......so he was not pointing at only Ben but he also said he, Embid,  had to get better.  So I also think they were influenced by media repeating things instead of the facts.  But I still have my Ben Simmons doll in my office and jersey....he could easily have been thr next Lebron James.....lets see what happens now.
One best thing about dude is that whenever he achieves something, he never give credit to himself. He always respect us, the audience the most and his team too. He is always polite in every of video. We congratulate ourselves for this achievement. More to come and everything comes. We always with you rtzg
Let’s get an Anthony Davis interview! Would love insight on his injuries and NBA journey. Can see similarities between Ben and Davis’s stories.
People need to live through perspective…. now every hater is gonna turn into a supporter at the cost of Ben having to endure all the BS
Shout out to JJ. Imagine how bad ESPN would've spin this on their platform
yeah ,thanks so much

Great interview and im glad Ben is in good spirits with that being said watch out for Brooklyn Nets this year there gonna be dangerous
Severely disappointed in these guys for allowing this to play out the way it did. Essentially held his hand and guided him through this.
I hope Ben figures it out..because literally the only thing he's missing is a steady consistent jump shot and go to move.
Funny guy, awesome Patek Philippe watch, good talk. You did bring the best of him out on the screen.  Great job, I missed your podcast
If he doesn't shoot the ball this year's app hope is lost
32:37 This literally explains Ben’s game. Skilled like the AND1 players but no shooting
Your commercial cutaway puts another 40 on your age JJ, lol cringey
I thoroughly enjoyed this entire interview. Ben doesn't seem to be the bad guy the media and fans made him out to be all this time, people just don't like to wait to hear the other sides of stories. Wish him all the best in his NBA return.
Its crazy how people switch up all the comments are supporting ben simmons now💀
Tell his side of the story- where has he said his side of the story? Dude gets paid 200 million of dollars and fails to take criticism on his chest and creates one of the biggest diva dramma in the nba ever. Also „i want to get easy buckets” - cuz u cant get any other buckets. I dont like this dude, period. In my eyes he is a celebrity type of a player.
Just why have a non basketball player talk about basketball ???
The real story is going to be a doc on Netflix in 2043.
The background isn’t it.
He even has a mental block shooting his tweets and DMs out… 👀
Probably nothing.. but I’ll be that guy. He left his former teammate “Seth Curry” out of his new teammate mentions.. hopefully an oversight but still notable
As a sixers fan who hated on him during the hawks series and the trade sage, I really feel bad for the guy and glad he got to explain his side of the story. I'm glad he got better and wish him all the best.  But I sure as hell still want Embiid to destroy him the next time they match up tho lol
He didn’t even know he was an accomplished athlete. Speaks to his humility and will to win against stacking accolades. Much respect to this guy
The stories about letting Doc know he couldn't play and then Doc putting him straight into practice and then consequently booting him, the leaked story of the "phone" in his pocket when at training, the 76ers "punishing" him because he wouldn't work with THEIR psychs, the personal vitriol he received from sections of the media, egged on by the leaking of info by the 76ers, it all paints a pretty damning picture of a young man in a bad head space who, for some reason, many people of the NBA (and 76ers fans) felt comfortable beating down on. Let's hope if you or a loved one are having mental issues that those arround provide the support and help needed, not grow their clicks by being disrespectful.
I’m excited about the Nets this year after this 😁
He doesn’t force himself to be anything he isn’t. I respect that
Suuper good episode!! He starts a bit arrogant the first twenty minutes but then he gets more comfortable and the last I felt half an hour was great!
Great interview JJ. I'm from Australia. I was lucky enough to be at Wells Fargo Arena for the game you mentioned in the interview. When Ben went toe to toe with Lebron without Embiid and destroyed them. The atmosphere was electric and Ben had that city in the palm of his hands. They loved you mate.
Ben:"No one's guarding Kevin or Kyrie ..."   Celtics (Tatum, Brown, Smart ): 👀👀
Crazy I’ve never heard bro voice before
Why didn't u ask about him and joels relationship?
One day someone will hold this bum accountable I hope. How you even fix your lips to say "All I care about is winning", when you damn sure know you are a Gigantic Liability in the 4th Q in playoff games. Gtfoh Benny.
Ben is fuckn awesome!! #lovh8terz
Longest jerkoff session I have ever seen. Hope JJs arm is okay. Funny how biased these ex athletes are. Thought I was watching this for unbiased story's not PR for Ben. This a joke interview.
This man does not love basketball. He wants to play COD for a living
Based on the beginning of this podcast Ben needs to make his way to the warriors lmfao. Ben Ben pls. Do your worst this year or make the warriors give up wiggins and a few young players…….. There’s ya first ring bro pls.
He's definitely lying his "mental health" got messed up right around the time lane Johnson went public about his depression. Ben used it as an excuse to leave the team. Disappointed in JJ not challenging him at all in this interview.
Drinking game: drink when Ben says “locked in”.
Ben Simmons was already one of my favorite defensive players, but now he’s most definitely one of my favorite players in the league rn. Glad all my time spent defending him didn’t go to waste😅
"It's easy to guard guys who all they can do is score"  I bet it's even easier to guard people who can't score, Ben.
i only watched ben played basketball two times  the hawks series and one night vs dame lillard .   hawks he was terrible but i never seen any body defends dame like that . i was shocked that was the best defense i ever seen . and am old head who grew up watchin pipen and jordan era. if i was ben i would least  take 10 shots a game .dont matter if i make it or not fuck it .  even the late great kobe  had to airball free throw  who cares . you gotta trust yo shot even if you going miss
Why this nigga just lying 😂
Go to the Lakers and play with LeBron and get a chip and get us to greatness otherwise become an rest of overpaid talk guy
Get rid of your FEAR brother. Everyone fails, who cares?  The problem beyond my below comment is your influencing kids in a negative way - not by having a mental issue that is not a joking matter, but by not showing up and not choosing to play based on fear or something else is a bad example for kids who look up to you.  Face it all head on go out and if you don't play well at least you play that's a better look.  Good luck man you got talent use it if you fail, don't play up to your own vision of how good or bad you are so what? Most people are sitting here living nine to five jobs wishing they were in your shoes and it doesn't mean your shoes are easy to fill. Uncross your arms, get off tiktok, stop blaming the coaches and team for things like working out (they don't do that necessarily only to make players stronger it is part of a holistic approach and a big part of that is mental and the team that's why you show up regardless) Good interview
When Ben starts talking about the issues the public and Philly had with him, you start to realise this is not bens fault his human and he has been bullied for years.  I seriously can't wait to see him play for NY i really hope he carries them to championship.
Social Media is a PROBLEM in all domains - Sports, Politics, Business etc.  Lack of Discipline to stay OFF your phone has caused a massive devolution in basketball. It's now a bunch of guys wearing tights and man buns worrying more about how they look on Instagram versus playing hard. Harden wouldn't last one game on a D3 team back in the 90s let alone where he is now. Diving, flopping NO HEART influencing younger guys to play like that is also a serious problem with the older players not realizing they're hurting the game. This poor kid is a victim of society let him heal leave him alone, this generation is being forced into weak mentality because of this point of diminishing returns we have reached with technology.  Sports at any moderately high level have embedded pressure but you have these kids being criticized by nobody's hiding behind a computer who have never reached the high level and have no business commenting. Good luck kid you got it
I started off feeling sympathetic for Ben, but as it went on I became extremely annoyed what little responsibility he takes. It makes me feel like he hasn’t really done all that much work.
I’m rooting for this guy
I feel like the 2 largest things or subjects that hurt this dude over the last 2 to 3 years has been his health and the perception that he is soft or mentally soft, which then snowballed into he is a diva or he is being a baby to leave Philly. Simmons is damn good man, no he isn't a pure scoring guard, but if u  put him in the correct situation he will thrive.
Ben is full of shit but he's with brooklyn now. No one has questioned his IQ, his skill on the court they simply asked that he work and improve his shooting cause if he did that for philly they would've been unstoppable and simply he didnt. The Sixers were basically playing 4 on 5 late in games. Even if he developed a middy in 5 years the sixers would be champions at some point. And he folded. It wouldve been different if he tried and failed he didnt even try and in front of that fan base they lost all respect for him. the only thing i agreed with was shaq putting his message out there and not being a lsu brother. I get that but they also aint gonna support a phony or a player leaving their team out to dry.
Great interview .
How in the world do you make the only cut in the interview when he is describing his time away from hope? WTF!?
Ben is getting away with fooling all of y’all man lol. Please stop the insanity. I find it funny that this all could have been avoided if he’d just spoke out when all this was happening. It’s just like in a relationship, if you don’t speak the f*ck up then the other person only has your actions to go on. If he had balls he would have just set the record straight YEARS ago. Why let the narrative get out of hand? He’s a coward lol. Foh
NBA's last 2 minute report on Raptors-Sixers game 7 confirms there was no traveling. JJ Redick, get over yourself and accept the truth. Even if that shot hadn't gone in, the game would be tied going to OT and you would've had to beat a championship team that was leading you for most of the 4th. Chances were, you were going to lose and you LOST!
This man needs a specific coach. And not necessarily a player’s coach
Sometimes I forget how young he still is. Austin rivers is already calling some stuff out and obviously the mainstream media will jump on this. But wether or not every story is true ; it’s still his perspective. Personally speaking I don’t think I’d be able to deal with the shit he’s dealt with. And looks like he’s powering through it. Kudos
I would love him next to luka
knowing most of these people hating on Ben are philly fans is mad funny 😂 cant wait to see him ball out in brooklyn - Raptors fan
As a sixer fan, i fucked wit Ben heavy, prolly my fave player on the team. I remember seeing him and Embiid at Made in America walking through the crowd. He had so much potential sucks how it went down but fuck him he a opp now lol fuck BK
Thank you for this interview have Ben the first time ever really heard him speak sounds like a really nice guy And the media portrayed him as a bad guy… So thank you again and I will be rooting for Ben this winter Thank you
GREAT INTERVIEW. I UNDERSTAND BEN SIMMONS SIDE OF THE STORY. CANT WAIT TO WATCH HIM AND THE REST OF THE NETS GO OUT THERE AND PLAY IN THE UPCOMING SEASON. 🎉 Warriors in 6
I love you giving Ben the platform to tell his story. I'm not a Nets fan in any way but now I'm a Ben Simmons fan. I want to see him kill it this season.
He called Trae Young a water bug lol
some fat lies in this podcast going overlooked lol
This interview changed my mind on ben
F Ben Simmons... He doesn't wanna be great, if you want the other team to guard everybody, then why TF didn't you shoot in the game.... You turned your back on our city, you not Philly, you not part of Philly, we don't want you here, stop trying to claim us.... All you had to do was shoot the f'n ball and help Joel in big games but you were too much of a coward... Foh, stop bringing our city up... You ain't 1 of us
The reason why Michael Jordan is the best player in the NBA is because he is both dominant in offense and defense which is rare in todays game.
I love how this interview came out man fr just getting to know the story of Ben of everything that has happened its nice knowing the actual story!!!
Great Humble Interview, Ben Simmons Is So Likeable i can’t even Front
I applaud Ben Simmons for choosing the interview forum to craft his image his way, similar to Aaron Rodgers.  And of course, this was a puff-piece interview.  Not once did JJ mention Ben's free throw shooting during the Atlanta playoff series.
This so the most gaslightingest thing I have ever seen
He has a smug on his face like everything he says is a lie , u can see how he raises he’s cheeks every time , you can’t trust him. I can’t be the only one seeing this
Bro what is this softball ass interview lmfao wtf. "How hard is it to be you bro?"   Cool to see regardless..
I'm pretty sure Ben's mental health issues first started from his biological sister accusing his half brother (agent) of sexual assault when she was young. He is really close with his family and it caused a fraction. It wasn't really reported in the media. I remember he took a personal leave from Philly and his numbers after really suffered.
“I want to get free buckets” passed up a free dunk on trae young. Kind of feels like it’s a offsettting statement, I’m not trying too troll just want to understand Ben
Oooh, Ben burns Seth Curry about his defense on Huerter and they're teammates on the Nets ... Actually, when he was talking about all the players on the Nets did he mention Seth?  Seth and Ben beef?
At 46:35 he talks about exactly what I'm going through now.. The pain.. the foot.. the nerve issues.. I'm getting surgery for this next week. Wow.
im here just to say: f*ck you Ben, you are a snowflake.
no ones guarding kevin or ky... well the boston celtics did and they swept the nets
1:04:00
What a great listen
It's always nice to hear the athletes side of the story. We always hear what the media is saying and most of it is bullshit anyway.
CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE THIS GUY PLAY IN A BROOKLYN NETS UNIFORM!!!!!! THE SILENCE FINALLY BREAKS !!!!!! I THINK WITH KD AND KYRIE HES GOING TO DO JUST FINE !!!!!!! NETS 4 LIFE!!!!🏙🌃🏙🌃💯🙌🙌👊🙏🙏🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🗽🗽🗽
Ben thinks Trae is 6’11 300 pounds 19:17 that’s why he passed the ball at the sight of Trae  😂😂
Ben needs to play with the Dubs before Curry and Klay are out their prime. He could split the 4/5 along with Dray.  Imagine to the defense between Dray and Ben?? And them two running the break with the splash bros and all their shooters??? 🔥🔥🔥🔥   Nets gonna break....
Ben, I'm not a Philly fan so I thought the worst of you. But you present yourself very well. You should perhaps consider speaking a little more because you represent yourself very well.
He's never playing again He still lying about his game... 14 points lol thats not going work
IM SO PROUD OF HIMM! 😢 LETS GO BEN!❤
This man is fake ass dude, I believe in him for all these years that he was with our 76ers, believe in him when every fan of ours had it and wanted him out, I believe that he was going to get his shooting up and help our 76ers win a chip because of him being able to shoot the rock and it never happen!! A lot of the off seasons that he had promising videos of him shooting and say that he work a lot on his shooting and then the  regular season would come and this man never even try to shoot the Ball and us fans just sit their and believing that one day he would start shooting the ball and it never happen!! 😡 then because of his poor shooting and  we lost the series against the young ATL team and that shit was not fair to all his teammates and us fans. After that he wants to be mad at all the comments about him and he was mad at JOJO and doc for what they say after the series that was totally bullshit. BEN YOU ARE A inconsiderate man being mad at people that you never help out while they was doing everything to help bring a chip to our city while you was being scared of trying to shoot the rock 🤦‍♂️ JOJO CARRY THE TEAM FAR INTO THE PLAYOFFS WHILE YOU DIDNT DO SHIT!! I glad you the hell gone and took your damn problem to the nets cause Now we have a team that could content in the playoffs and bring us a chip so we could celebrate it!!! You WAS A WASTE OF A PICK BROTHER THAT WE SHOULD OFF NOT WASTE OUR TIME AND EFFORT WITH YOU AND Markelle fultz TOO 🤦‍♂️…….
Kind of amazing that he Kevin and Kari have all gone through so many similar things they must be able to relate to each other on so many levels. All Hayley heralded probably the three most criticise players in the league all have battled mental health and constantly the idea of fans get also supremely talented with amazing potential. If these guys can get it together in Nguyen, it would be a big F you to everybody else I hope they do well
Ask him can he dunk
Can he make a shot yet??
One thing I will always love and respect about JJ is that he’s not afraid to essentially call out his interviewers for being too politically correct or trying to slide away from saying names. When Ben was talking about G7 against the Hawks, you can tell he wasn’t really comfortable bout name dropping, but JJ was able to guide him and allow him to speak his true self by saying what we all know to be true—Doc Rivers and Joel Embiid threw him under the bus.
I was wondering how long it would take for "12 points" to release his next video.   Twenty years from now people will look back and judge the league that was filled with podcasters and soy milk vegans.
Ben Simmons should do an episode of Deatail, not for laughs.
As a Sixer fan I wish I Ben did hold himself just a little more accountable about him not living up to his full potential, because at the end of the day thats all Philly really wanted from him & I’m sure they would’ve loved to have Ben & Joel work out & eventually bring a Championship to Philly. Happy his head is in a good spot though nonetheless, he’s going to ball in Brooklyn for sure. But JJ, you should try to get James Harden on the podcast, i would love to see that interview, keep up the great work my guy
What wine is that?
Your my hero
41:10 Didnt he  come at rudy gobert ? isnt that kinda hypocritical to say he didnt like the bad media attention then do this. anyway glad to hear his perspective
Peace... Great Interview
Bruh ain't halfway thru the interview and he already 🍒 👀 and sloshed... Giving up gubment secrets...
More of this please. Our society needs it.
Ben is a cool dude and super talented
Anyone know what sunglasses JJ is wearing? Gotta find those
So Shaq was being phoney af when he said that “LSU brother bs”
Im so mad at myself for actually hating on him for a while smh. Its amazing how when a player is given the oppurtunity to speak freely it can change the whole narrative. So sorry Ben hope u get back to an all nba level again
I just don’t believe anything this guy says he seems so fake
the way jj has talked about ben in the past im surprised ben is here
https://youtu.be/XB1-wlCBFys
Ben Simmons - In Australia it isn’t like this  Australia- Nah G , don’t put us in it
Put Cade on the show
Fbs
JJ YOU SELL OUT
Great pod , JJ!
It’s good JJ humanized Ben to the public
This interview is so good and I totally understand what Ben Simmons have been through. A lot of us experienced this kind of path but I can't imagine the difficulty to find the peace you need when it is public. No blame to Shaq and others who criticized him, like he said this is just ignorance and also a lack of empathy. But you have to know what it is personally to understand the difficulty and the complexity of that. I can't not wait to see one of my favorite player on the floor again and so happy to hear the wiseness he bring to the table here.
Shout out BRENT SIMMONS
who's ever reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day.
As an Australian… I’ve given up on this guy. Bball IQ my arse. His career is 1/3 over and he hasn’t changed at all since his rookie year. He came back for his 2nd season (3rd year) and had regressed already shooting wise… seriously google it ben shot jumpers as a rookie. Now, I just call him timid or weak. He has no heart for the moment. He has excuses instead of reasons to get better. And then to sit out and demand a trade when ur a max contract? It’s plain to see he doesn’t love basketball… he loves celebrity. Dude is putrid.
JJ is the perfect example of never burn bridges and always be a good teammate as well as a good person.
Thank goodness and thanks to all the active and former players with podcasts.If this was another time we would have NEVER heard Simmons' side of the story.....until he retired
Wow, back with a bang
Incredible conversation. Great to hear from  Ben
Something weird about Ben when he speaks idk man
Redick 2024
Men and women that make 50k complain FAR LESS than men and women who make 50 million.
I really hope Harden is one of those players he said he has coming up!! Somebody needs to get him on a podcast
when he said trae young might be 200 IBS lol his IQ was revealed
He didnt really say anything from what I heard. Wish he was pressed a bit more but I understand.
"In your first rookie season you broke your foot" 😂😂😂
Much respect to JJ for this interview. Asked all the tough questions people wanted to hear, but he also was emotionally intelligent enough to validate Ben's feelings and give him a space to be comfortable and tell his side of the story. Commend Ben for being vulnerable too cause that's never easy. Wish the best for him going forward in life and his career.
Ben Simmons is an  More athletic Draymond Green
Watching the interview...I gotta post about the dunk in the Hawks game. Sure the question got asked.  I guess there's balls in that. But neither Simmons or JJ really addressed why that play got scrutinized except that Simmons acts like it was just any other play and he's got no idea why anyone cared. Everyone cared because it was the capstone example where all of Sixers nation was begging him to be more aggressive and consistent and at points it just seemed like Ben said f the world, he's going to do what he wants and he was basically uncoachable... just like the shooting issues too and maybe it even got Bret Brown fired. This was never asked or addressed... the idea that if he'd have tried even a little bit to listen to anyone and not be so headstrong...toward if not cowardice, at least softness... he might have had more support. And that's another thing too. He acts like the lack of support from everyone came in a vacuum.  He never acknowledges from that from other people's point of view need been a pain in the ass so many times just not being willing to do what was asked.   So that lack of dunk attempt was the same as he'd played all game where he just refused to accept responsibility as a primary scorer. He's always got an excuse. He explains this away by saying "he just wants to win" and doesn't care how he does it.  Ya Ben but there are other people besides you on Earth. BBall is a team sport and your team needed specific things from you that you refused to even try to do. That lack of a dunk wasn't just one failed play. It was a final giant FU to the fanbase, the coaches, the teammates who begged you for years to be more aggressive at times and not back off of scoring... but you just still weren't gonna do it. And until you get that... every team you play for has to worry you'll do it again because you seem to not even understand how you it is you pissed everyone of so much. Read this. Own it.  And then progress might get made.  (Believe me I'm not going to start holding my breath after it's gone this long and no one even addresses the heart of it to this day...)
Where was this Ben with the Sixers. All I ever saw the wooden, stone face and sullen Simmons. If he was this engaging maybe everything would have turned out differently. Even if after a win at press conferences he never spoke like this.
Ben Simmons is so over hated!
What type of wine are they drinking?
https://youtu.be/paDOpTpbXaI this is all I gotta say tbh rip
I can't wait for the Season to start
This was the best podcast he could’ve came to mentally lol.. Former teammate + comfortability. Easy interview for him.
I respect Ben sharing this💯 but I can tell a lot of people are gonna hate on this🤦🏾‍♂️
I'm a 76ers fan since the 1960's (Go Wilt!). I wish we didn't have to draft Ben. Everyone agreed he was the overall best player in the draft but I didn't want him on my team. I remember his LSU teammates talked about how great a basketball player he was but none of them talked about what a great teammate he was. He injured his foot in his first summer league game and missed the season. He missed all of last season as well. So in six years, he played in 57% of all the games the 76ers played. Add to that he never really worked to improve his deficiencies (shooting, three point shots, free throws). It’s not just that Simmons is a poor shooter. It’s that he is an unwilling one. As a rookie, Simmons attempted 21.4% of his shots outside of ten feet from the basket. His last season in Philly, that was down to 9%, and in the playoffs it went down to just 2.2%. Simmons just hasn’t shown growth in his game over the years, and that’s an issue.  The bigger issue is that he doesn't take ownership of his weaknesses. He is a marvelous defensive player but he doesn't seem to care. Also, I've never seen such an emotionless player. Seriously, have you ever seen the man smile on the court? Does he even enjoy playing basketball because after six years, I have no idea.
Tommy looks like DJ Drama, always wanted to say that
so great to hear ben's side of things!
JJ knows Simmons is full of himself and cut him lying multiple times and deflecting criticism instead of man up. You can see in JJ’s face he wanted to say something but then he stop because maybe he made a pact with Simmons or maybe because he was his ex-teammate. But honestly disappointed of how JJ was making excuses for him and he went soft on him.
Joel and Doc did not throw him under the bus. Stop the nonsense.
This was a really great interview and while he certainly isn't innocent (whatever that means in this context) with how it all went down, I completely get where Ben was coming from.  Pretty shitty for your co-star and head coach to just throw you under the bus.
The pacers comment was so painfully accurate
Ok as a lifer 76er fan, I’m going to wish Simmons, good luck…
Well He's was open honest I understand him..hes gonna prob have a great year in BK
ben soft as hell
Someone kiss JJ on the lips and let him know he did a GREAT JOB WITH THIS INTERVIEW.  I have been curious on how Ben has been since he left us. Glad to know he is ready to roll for the new season!  - 76ers fan
JJ wore the glasses so it could be easier to ask the tough questions you ain't slick 😂😂😂😂
His excuse for not dunking was that he was guarding the best player of the game is lame, look at Wiggins he was guarding the best player of the game also and he dunk on Luka, and he wasn’t afraid. OK you are afraid of shooting because is your weakness, Wiggins weakness is free throws (and unlike Simmons) he didn’t let it be a mental block in the playoffs and affect his game, he went hard to the basket, wasn’t afraid of getting foul and go to the free throw line because he choose helping his team than being selfish.
Props to JJ to be subtle and proper when having to interview. It allowed players to open up and made it safe. Sometimes we never realise how special and take Ben for granted. He is an amazing player. No judgement and keep moving forward. Forget the pass criticism and play the game you love. It’s more than a game
First JJ Reddick is on his way to an Emmy. Next I have always rooted for Ben Simmons. I always felt it was a lot of microagression happening behind the scenes.
Dudes not taking accountability. We’ve gotta stop this trend of people being immature, and all of a sudden having a “mental health problem” it takes away from people that are really going through it.
BEN SIMMONS OFFSEASON WORKOUT!!!! https://youtube.com/shorts/VCBrtBr-l3U?feature=share
Dude is a legitimate 15 to 20 point a game guy  arguably the best defender i. The league cuz he can defend 1 thru 5  and will dish 10 assists a game and is still a baby and has  exponential growth room and people just write him off
28:34 actually the Pacers went to the conference finals three times in the last 20 years so I feel like Philly would take that every time lol
Since Ben was drafted i always picked and chose him as my favorate player...always watched him play and do his thing...ofcourse he had moments where he didn't perform that well but still i kept supporting him💯 and now i'm very glad for him to see him in a good place again and being himself...i hope he has a succesfull season💯💯💯👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Jerry West owns you.
“You was hurt obviously”😂😂😂😂
ik exactly how he feels about his back cuz im going through the same thing right now that shi is so painful
Big upz guys, and to Ben for sharing his travels through this time. Hoping for a killer season from him to shut all the experts up.
Absolutely love this and been waiting for this . Ima huge Ben Simmons fan and although he did make a questionable decision, he gets way more criticism than he deserves. There’s only a handful of guys in the league that can do what he does. Appreciate what he does instead of what he doesn’t do
Ben Simmons came off as likeable
Hope you enjoyed your Valentini Trebbiano. What vintage?
You got people with no gym, no pavement, using rocks and crates training and this dude *refuses* to shoot or play after getting 100+ million. Nah no excuses.
Engagement
Incredible episode…
“You’re saying Kevin’s better than me.”
I gotta say I really do not believe Ben when he says he was trying to do the right thing by showing up to practice and getting kicked out, and that has a major effect on me believing anything else he said in this podcast.
People hate this dude cause of the media.. the nets are gonna be a problem in the east. I can see them coming out of the east maybe winning it all if healthy
Ben looks skinny as hellll
This was good.
Such a great interview. Well done JJ. I’m now a Ben Simmons fan.
The stache aint it, JJ.  Grow that beard back out.
This video is severely underviewed lol congrats to JJ for getting Ben on the show 🔥
I think the break between pods was good. It kept you from falling into the pods full of bs that clog up our feeds on the off season.
200 pound trae young would be the best player in the league if he kept his quickness
That cut after “Huerter had like 27 points…” lmao.
This was good to get out and talk so we can see the person, instead of what the media wants us to see as a “story”. Philly fans aren’t easy on people and I totally get it, but the media is a bunch of bs mainly too. Use the dude for what he is good at, keep him focused mentally and see what happens for once.
I think this is the first time ive genuinely heard him converse with someone. Its crazy I watched him in Philly from the very start and never really saw this side of him
Is it just me or does he come off pretty conceited from this interview?  Every opportunity he gets he tries to blame others and promote himself.  He's had a hard year but I don't think this interview changes many perspectives for BS
Great interview. My perception of Ben has been right he’s a non confrontational guy that lacks competitive spirit and needs to be coddled. He’s saying how he was hurt his contemporaries on the team didn’t aide him thru that hard time but his contemporaries on the team all bear the heavy expectations he does and I’m sure mentally they were all in bad places.   Also, he doesn’t address things publicly and although you have no obligation to respond to the critiques, you also have an equal amount of fans out here arguing on your behalf. Speak to your fans who do try and uphold your name.
Shut up and shoot the damn ball
This is the third time JJ has had a player that I hate on and makes me a fan of them. This show breaks down the wall of these cultural gods into real people and it’s awesome.
After hearing his perspective of basketball god have mercy for the league next year with all the shooters the nets have
"no one guards kevin" except JT
Let’s not over inflate the dunk that he didn’t make and ignore that he barely took any shots in the 4th qt in the Whole Series
I feel ashamed of myself for hating on this guy just through basketball he seems like a nice guy
Damn, Ben Simmons is a likable guy. Hope he gets over the yips and breaks out again.
This dude is extraordinarily arrogant and...I actually don't hate it. He is supremely confident in his talent...but then thats why I don't buy his "mental health" excuse. Listen to this guy talk about himself...he doesn't seem like he has had any issues with confidence.
Says a lot that he choose a podcast oppose to a big network . Good for him
Been watching JJ since Duke!
This is excellent. Hope you could guest Zion next!
@jj redick is my favorite duke legend
1:00:00 ok so why did u sue the sixers to get $20 million that you didn’t earn?
JJ (nonchalantly) “You absolutely shoulda dunk it” 😂 that went over Bens head
Ben Simmons is Garbage.
banger
I know Ben Simmons is soft so JJ needed to kind of tip-toe around a lot of these topics, but I think JJ is gonna lose some respect for absolutely coddling him, holding his hand and making excuses for him this whole interview long. He shoulda let Ben defend himself, not the other way around. Wayyy too player-oriented to be considered real journalism to me
Cinematic video on my channel 🔥💯🥵
Hey Tommy and JJ, can you guys get Ime Udoka as a guest on your pod next week??? I believe he's available and ain't got nothing else to do.... If he declines, perhaps get Nia Long instead??? Kind regards
Man Ben is a real stand up guy and we’ve all been judging him not knowing what was going on behind closed doors. Shaq really a punk for leaking dms lol.
👍
This appearance from Ben was great, all we get as fans is the filtered crap from the mainstream media agendas and the on court moments. To get a genuine, real look at who these NBA players really are is awesome!  Changed some opinions of mine about Ben!
Lol he know he regrets that play. He was scared to take it because he didn’t want to miss. O man was I the only one watching that game. He better ball this year if not will always be known as the biggest choke in basketball history lmao😂😂😂😅
Glad to hear his side of it. A lot of people kicking him while his down. From the team staff to the media going at it it’s hard to stay sane with all that negativity around you
Dude just sounds like a wuss tbh. He's lucky he's like 7 feet tall because if he was a foot shorter he'd just be some dude that you wish would stfu about his problems because nobody cares.
glad this interview is blowing up.  ben simmons is ultimately a great basketball player and he comes off as extremely likeable here.  killer podcast, jj.  listened to the entire thing.
JJ the best in the interview game
Ben Simmons avoids the press unless he knows the interviewer is actively biased in his favor. JJ can only get him to come on by spending the bulk of the episode complimenting him and trying to make him look good. You get to hear Ben Simmons' side of the story, but you pay a heavy price along the way. In the old days, when players had to talk to Peter Vescey whether they liked it or not, we got authentic responses without having to wade through an hourlong circle jerk
Great interview ❤
those glasses JJ got on are hard
Ben actually wanted Steph or Klay but he had to settle for JJ...Just kidding JJ. 😂
🔥I am a YouTuber 🔥 ❤️🥰My Tech channel 🥰❤️ 🔥😍!Ap ko mara channel sa help mil sekhti hai!🔥😍 💯 Good video 👍
People also need to get off his back we all human at the end of the day and basketball is a game not life💯
Cant wait to see Ben suit up this season for Brooklyn gonna be a fun/interesting season after this long offseason!!
I need to hear Doc side now cuz something is missing 😂
Hey JJ you were great as the villan in the netflix movie "Gray Man"....i didnt know you were an actor too
Bens shoulders do all the laughing.
Great interview… and Ben is right it’s always been everyone vs him.
I think anyone that knows basketball for what basketball really is, knows just how valuable a player he is, especially in this league. His style of play is refreshing, and more than that, how he describes his style of play is refreshing: wanting to win and including his team.  I’m a huge fan of Ben and love what he’s been able to do on both sides of the ball!!
Top 15 player in the league!!!!! Still!
Yo😮 Great interview also very deep🤦‍♂️ Mannnn! This was a dam good interview to anyone who is reading this👏 Diehard #dubnation guy but Ben definitely made me worried about Nets this this season after watching this interview. Was worried about the Mavs a little bit but definitely more concerned about playing Brooklyn in the finals😅 Can’t wait for this season to start cause this might be the greatest season of basketball we’ve seen in a long time🏀
I’m ngl I’m not on the NBA level as a pro athlete but I Am a pro athlete I participated in big boy ben simmons slander but I still reminded people he’s an all star level player but ima Philly fan at first. I tried to understand but I was at all those home games that mfer was point shaving but as i stated before can’t deny what he’s done in the league
I’m honestly shocked I’m here hearing Ben’s side of the story
looks like he cares too much what people thinks. No need to defend what you do, just gotta improve your shooting and confidence
I sometimes forget that ben simmons is australian lol
looks like he cares too much what people thinks. No need to defend what you do, just gotta improve your shooting and confidence
The fact that no one mentions that in the post season (playoff runs) he has underachieved dramatically is mind boggling. It wasn't just that one play or the lack of shooting.  He was under performing in almost every single category in the playoffs. He is fool of himself and I'm very disappointed in JJ for making the interview so soft. Every playoff run I Waited for Ben to step up and turn the corner and he didn't. I waited for 4 years patiently thinking that he would help the team win in the Playoffs. I was rooting for him, but he did not step up when it mattered the most. He helped us get to the playoffs, but never stepped up in the playoffs. Look at his playoff stats. Every team knew his weaknesses and strengths.  They took away his strength and since his weaknesses where not developed during the off season he under performed. If he would have developed his FT shooting percentage to high 70 he would have been a difference maker, but he didn't and rherefore it seemed liked he was scared of getting fouled.
Most Overhated Player in the NBA
Who knew all Ben needed was a hug or to cuddle with Doc....🤡
Narcissistic personality disorder is found more commonly in men. The cause is unknown but likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms include an excessive need for admiration, disregard for others' feelings, an inability to handle any criticism, and a sense of entitlement.
“In the moment I assumed Trae was gonna come over” Ben knew it was Trae smh. Did anyone else catch this ??? Come on everyone. SMH
SMH needed more follow up questions and realness
Sorry, don't need his ""side" of the story, we saw it on court. After years in the NBA he never worked on his shooting. Dudes 26, he should be able to shoot by now. He is paid millions to do that job but he was too busy chasing that stupid Jenner girl and partying. Ben passed the ball standing under the basket in the playoffs, that's all you need to know about his game. The guy has no heart or work ethic. Maxey is a huge upgrade over Ben, dude is fearless and can shoot.
I have been a Philly fan for as long as I can remember. Living in Europe and getting up at night to watch my team compete and experience the resurgence with Ben was amazing. When all then turmoil unfolded last summer, I must admit that I was disappointed and somewhat disgusted. But now, listenen to Ben and hearing his side of the story, he got my respect back. All that media hate, and the dude didn't return punches, shows his true character. He's a chill dude that just want to be happy in life. Think we all can relate. Best pod to date for sure. JJ making a great environment that players feel safe in
one of the best ones yet. so cool to hear from him!
most disappointing sixer of my lifetime... enjoy Brooklyn young socialite
46:49 “ I had constant back flare ups too “ I’m sure you did jj you were like 40 years old lmao
Your peace is worth more than anything... Preach BEN
Doesn't seem like any Sixers fans commented on this.  A lot of details left out.  1.  The reason he didn't take the dunk is he didn't want to go to the line with game 7 in peril.  2.  Never went into the Jimmy Butler mess.  Heard Ben had something to do with it.  3.  Taking a private jet vs traveling with the team.  Coach said no so Ben went over his head to the owner.  4. Refusing to listen to coach on fixing his shooting.  Brett wanted to assign him a coach.  Ben refused.  5. Never went into why he had so much trouble shooting free throws and the hack a Ben strategy from other teams.
Good interview, Interesting to me that Ben puts the blame on pretty much everybody else but I wish him the best! I personally would never want him as a teammate but I I really do hope you lights it up this season!
Reggie Miller is the MAIN GUY WHO OWES BEN A BIG ASS APOLOGY! I don't care, Shaq lame ass does too. Reggie saying what he said was uncalled for. Apologize to this man.
Being a die hard sixers fan I went into this thinking I was gonna hate Simmons more than I thought I already did, but I can't lie... dude came off completely genuine and I respect him for it. He admits he could have handled it differently, but the organization could have too. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm pulling for him in BK...he is too good of a talent not to pull for.
I’m a winner and I want to win is very different
Mann I brought a Simmons Philly jersey before the trade... now I need a refund so I can get a Nets jersey. smh
This is amazing
When asked about anything personal or his personal history, he seemed to contradict himself a lot. Not saying he is intentionally being deceptive and I always enjoy JJ but there was almost no follow up questions asked in the situations where he was being really vague with his answers.
Fantastic interview jj
hahaha joo this break was actually quite good but now watching this episode (I am at 30 minutes and the raptors travel thing came up) its good to have you guys back ahahaha. Just fun listening to this besides work
Bout time we find out what's up with this dude
Forgot the drops JJ? 😎
Может хватит нас гнобить, сукины дети
https://youtu.be/m1m7WmKJZyQ
Awesome interview!!!! I respect Ben even more.
Hey JJ,  If you can get Micheal Jordan 23 on the show, it would be beyond🔥!!  Even Lebron too.  In the future
A hour plus and we STILL dont know if this man going to play opening day🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️this guy just wasting everyone's time 🙆🏾‍♂️
Ben just got a new fan… Blazer fan for life but definitely rooting for this guy this season
The Jewish Onslaught the secret relationship between the blacks and Jews. It's a great book. Written by a black professor.  Dr.TONY MARTIN
I honestly get low IQ vibes from this guy
The fact that he thinks 200 lbs is lightweight is scary lol
JJ's great but calm down people. Ben revealed very little in this interview
Hit the bottom in Philly had to experience that before he could appreciate the success he’s about to enjoy.
Ben was a fairly typical athlete. No disrespect to him.  He opened up a little bit. Nothing too interesting. Wish him success.
It wasn't that single play when he didn't go up for dunk. A wide open dunk at that. It was scoring what 2 total points in all the 4th quarter games. Which is what killed the 76ers.
Brotherhood beyond the game, peace better than money😎 can't wait to see the thief out there
Here we were thinking Ben is an unsharpened Lebron, when it turns out he's just quiet Draymond. Honestly, I can appreciate him a lot more after this. Thanks, JJ!
Now this is how you interview someone!!! Great Job!!!
Pacers are in hell and it’s miserable to be a fan of them, but unlike the Sixers, they’ve made three conference finals in the last twenty years. Both teams have the same number of rings in that stretch so I’m not sure how preferable The Process is to the treadmill of mediocrity.   Reddick has some strange enmity toward Indianapolis. He once called it the most boring NBA city, which I think is debatable considering Charlotte, OKC and Sacramento are in the mix, no disrespect to any of those cities, I’ve only been to Charlotte once because of a flight delay. I’m sure all three have some great stuff to do, but they’re not as lively as say NOLA, Miami or Los Angeles.   Some might throw Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee into the mix, which I think is unfair, but generally I find something to like about most places I visit.
If PHI doesn't make a finals with Harden, this may go down as one of worst trades ever. They got Ben, Seth and picks for days
Has our society gotten to a point where someone "who is there", tells you what happened while "they were there" and people who were not still don't believe what they say?  Just asking for two friends, a hamster and some skittles.  And it's interesting to hear this stuff directly from the player's mouth and not SAS or the other talking heads.  Which is why I enjoy players on these platforms because you hear it directly from them.  There are other podcasts that I've seen where players have told the real story behind what really happened in the situation they were in.  AB's with Ryan Clark ("You and I know...."), Plax Burress on what really happened with the gun, nobody in mainstream media talking to Kwame's former teammates (Etan, T-Nes, Jahidi, C-Whit) about what really happened in DC, etc.   To me, I'm cool with criticism of performance but not when it gets personal.  Take about the stats and the game and not someone's mental state or whether are selfish or weak or whatever.    And then when he says that Shaq could've reached out to him since they LSU brothers, then the first thing Shaq does is post a timeline of the interview.  I think that Shaq is one of the greatest players to ever play and one the greatest and humblest people but instead of posting timelines, have Ben on your podcast or have JJ set up a call to talk it out.  I don't see what Shaq accomplished with posting timelines.
36:57 me and JJ had the same exact reaction 😂
JJ i like you...but you should have held his feet to the fire.    This was a Softball interview.
You know before i watched this i always looked at Ben Simmons as maybe a lil lazy or stubborn but after hearing his story my opinion is much more positive. Keep putting these videos out JJ they speak volume!
Great interview. Actually made me remember Ben was a human… until we got to the Sixers situation. Then I remembered he was Ben Simmons.
Good to see Ben out and about .
remember a time not too long ago, when players addressed their mental health by ‘taking it out on the court’?
he really said that Lebron is not that athletic??
Tommy John is the truth
Interesting perspective! Let's see Ben back on the court everything hinges on that! Hopefully he gets support
I cant believe they dont know Gerald huston 😂😂😂
I can’t stand JJ yes it’s a Duke thang lol but he’s growin on me.And he should still be playin
“It’s not about the money” — Files grievance to try and get millions for not playing
Remember, he used to have an Australian accent lmao
Just a great great interview. Props to JJ for this. Happy seeing this version of Ben again.
Comment before watching: This dude better explain himself
So many fake comments
Everyone got into his head and made it tough for him to play basketball. Then everyone made their own narrative when he had his mental health issues. Your mind controls your movements and rhythm. If it’s not in the right space, u cannot function properly and be at 100% regardless of physical health. Happy that he can open up and look forward to play. Hopefully shut people up and we can see the switch up after. I’m not even a 76ers or bkn fan, but I want him to succeed after all this turmoil he got hit with. Nice pod as always JJ
Did this interview really tell us much that we didn't already know from Klutch's reporting of the situation?
This was a great interview. I'm glad Ben was given a safe platform to tell his side of the story. JJ, your platform and podcast is much needed. Rooting for Ben to have  a great season!
Damn I saw the video & it had 400k, came back to watch it and it’s got 600k
I real life love jj podcast I’m back 12 hours later still leaving comments 🤣
Who guarded hurter BLAME THAT MF 😂💯
This interview made me like Ben Simmons a lot more. The old media, living off buzz-headlines & shock phrases, made this guy out to be a lot worse than he seems to be. I wanna see Ben hoop again; especially so he can lose to my MIAMI HEAT!
What a great interview. JJ is going to be doing this for a long time and I am here for it.   I'm definitely guilty of being down on Ben. I love his game and loved watching him play.  I'm rooting for him to get back to ballin out. GL Ben
“You’re d-ing Luka all night.” Excuse me sir?
Does anyone know what kind of glasses JJ is wearing for this interview?
Probably the most real podcast I've ever heard. Rooting for Ben this year!
JJ is different for this one really one of the best podcast
There are some people that just want to hate, but I all I wanted for two years was some sort of explanation from him.  I'm looking forward to listening to it today at work.
oh Kevin's wide open? naw imma pull that 3 🤣🤣🤣 bruh this man funny as hell
Softballs and no real follow up.  You’ve got to be kidding me.
You can't put out videos all off season showing yourself shoot the ball and don't expect people not to criticize when you don't do it during a real game. I didn't care if he missed, I just wanted him to attempt shots. You did that to yourself Ben. I wish you the best though.
JJ is the 🐐
Naw Ben Simmons soft as hell
This is a great interview.  So glad you were able to finally get Simmons on JJ.  I dig your postcards and interviews.  Also, you have such great podcast voice.  💕
Great interview .. people get so wrapped up in the athlete.. that they forget we're all human ✌👊🍻
Softball interview but a step in the right direction so nets fans should be encouraged.  I'm glad Ben is getting back on track  @1:00:00 mental health or not, He didn't want to work but wanted to get paid.... Let's keep it a buck and say he very clearly gave AF about losing that money.   @59:00 in regards to being "thrown under the bus" Imagine you're in a pitch meeting with clients and your coworkers completely freezes up and the client decides to pass on your pitch.... Mental health or not, of course your peers would be pissed at you.
When they told Simmons he achieved a lot and he doubted it….ngl feel bad for the guy
Look Its good he finally spoke for himself but I aint buying it. Everything he said is good, when you make mistakes own it and move on people gone talk if it's bad and talk when it's good. Ben you were not criticize that bad compared to Westbrook, KD, LEBRON and JT getting slammed and made the finals. Alot of that was self sabotage cause all people wanted to know was what is going on.
That 'non-dunk' pass to Thybulle has to be the most over-blown, over-analysed non-incident that I think has ever occurred in the NBA.  Had Ben dunked, it would have been a regulation 2 points that nobody would have ever remembered, but as it was Thybulle got 2 free throws and drew the foul, which is actually a better result than the former.
to soft for real life especially nba or even worse play off loking forward to some comedy with the nets - he wont change only interest is money  - rich waste of talent
Ffs JJ do you really have to advertise underwear ? I guess USA hit rock bottom...I will donate you money , just f.... stop 😁
Great interview but you guys watch 1 hour of Ben and change your mind lol.   Dude has been in the league 6 years and refuses to work on his game to get better.  He didn't want that ball in his hands cuz he was amazed to get fouled.  Half court defense shut him down and he choked every series we got knocked out in
Jj gives you what you want, it’s nice to have someone break down real time issues.
https://youtu.be/IoLM_KnA-5g
Okay interview but this easy for him jj doesn’t ask tough questions to anyone he needs to talk to someone who’s gonna ask real question
Dude I am Nuggets fan, if we had Ben with his defense and IQ, multiple chips guaranteed!!
Pretty soon JJ is going to be the only one who can get an honest interview with NBA players. Regular journalists and reporters hairy way of villainizing athletes because they think that's what the higher ups and the fans would rather see controversial reporters.
https://youtu.be/eUVKUHNY5Mg
Nets from the ownership down to the players need to support Ben and show him love it will bring the best out of him he's one of those ppl that need that in his life to respond the right way. Nothing wrong with it at all ppl who never suffered from mental health can't relate let's go Ben show them what they all forgot!
Great interview!
Another thing Ben touched on it  Why would he put up low % shots when he can pass it off to an open man for a much higher 3% shot,   Even if Ben to Improve and became a 35% 3 shooter, on most teams he’d have guys around with up to a 10% higher chance of making that shot, why pass that up, if the time clock allows for it etc etc,   shit SGA only had a 30% 3 shot AD 18%  Fuck jimmy Buckets only shot 23% regular season  Those are low % shots, some people aren’t known for their 3, and THATS OKAY  Like it’s the only way to score the ball  Dunking is a much much higher % Shot, and the efficiency of three dunks vs two 3 attempts..
This is trending number 2 for a reason. He’s a star, people always want to know about him.
✅✅✅
Not sure if I am the first one to mention but that Tommy John ads in the middle is surprising enjoyable to listen to.
Wow that's incredible interview but still wish he can at least try to shoot some midrange or wide open threes.
I always said he is an accomplished athlete people need to stop listening to the media
When I say I’m excited for this
get Patty Mills on next
how many pizzas do you want in the background? Ben Simmons: Yes.
lets go
Just a little bit of this makes me feel that had the Warriors actually gone ahead with getting Simmons, they'd have become even better. With how they turned around Wiggins, I have zero doubts that it would also have happened with him.
Great interview. Good to hear his side of things. Glad he's in a good space!!
Smash 'em up Benny!!
Here my view on scoring and defending   If you put up 15 points a game but you’re the reason 20 points DONT get scored  Your Point net rating to me is 35.   If you Put up 30 PPG but you’re the reason 20 Points are scored, because you don’t or Can’t play defense Your Point net rating to me is 10   Think I know which one I’d rather have
Ben has been my favorite playing since he’s starting playing in the nba that one mistake didn’t change anything for me
Excellent interview. I'm excited to see him play this year
LET’S GOOOOOO last time I clicked an Old Man & The Three vid this fast was the Curry one. Love it
This was a great podcast we never knew we needed
Ben is cool but from what he says I still feel like he has to take more accountability, he points the finger a lot and makes excuses, champions don't do that.
No one deserves to be slandered and ripped apart the way Ben was over sports. People need to grow up.
Ben going: Great not having to guard Kevin And Kyrie. Every practice be like: Oh shucks...
I'm happy Ben is in a good place now. He seems like a great guy
All of y’all that judge him have never been through what he has. Mental health is real and y’all are blessed not to have experienced it. For the rest of us that have suffered from mental health, we understand and take him serious.
He said the ONE x-player in media to reach out was J. Will.? That's fucked up. Thats horrible media coverage.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCkLljN1rLH9ZHHZgywXnEUw
Great interview JJ & crew! I am excited to see Ben play this season.
Missed y’all JJ welcome back this was a great listen
This some BS! Calling out a guard that WON'T shoot is not "knit picking".
Ben is a great ball handler 😳
Give the money back you fraud
Best segment for jj, props to not being one-sided knowing how close you are with ben.
I think it’s not a stretch to say that this interview has completely changed the narrative around Ben
5 a game until they tell me to stop..........lmfao
All Philadelphia fans are eye rolling this entire interview.
Happy for Ben but I didn't hear a single word of self-criticism. He didn't handle things the right way and by listening to what he says, it was ONLY Sixers' fault. He praised himself for the (many) good things he can do on the basketball court, but never admitted there are things he needs to improve. Hope he'll understand it one day and become that lethal weapon he can be.
Seeing Simmons side of the story clears a lot of things up  Shout out to JJ for being a good teammate on and off the court
Ben always been a real one to me, people always feel like they can speak on what they would do this and that when literally only he is in his shoes everyday, we all have our own lifes everyones isn’t meant to walk da same exact path! Fans n media really put sports above real life and being humans first! Especially for brothas basketball is an escape or a way to help our families typically we have 10x more real life pressure going on then some basketball game🤷🏾‍♂️💯
Jj has 2 glasses of wine and gets on the waters
Amazing interview 🙏🔥 Looking forward to seeing Ben ball in Brooklyn!
No one’s gonna mention that they keep cutting away when he’s about to say something crazy about Philly.
Love fest, safe landing interview, good luck Simmons on new chapter
Half a mill views in Less than a day !! You know everybody been waitin on this Shìt. Would’ve thought it was a music video 😂
Can't believe we're finally gonna hear Simmons' side of the story
JJ is a really good interviewer
Ben should rebrand himself as a "dish and dee" player
As a Philly fan I let the media get the best of me and was a big hater. Thanks for explaining and with you well!
First time I’ve heard him speak extensively about everything… Seems like a nice guy and I wish him the best!
The Process was interesting... but I hear him saying even though they were tanking and taking on talent, they were lacking leadership and experience to welcome the new talent and make them better, show them. That sounds about right
Bout time JJ.
Great interview. Where was the question about KD handing in a trade request? Would have been interesting to get Ben’s perspective on that.
Ben will continue to blame others for his failures and never be a great basketball player again. It’s over 🙅‍♂️
Lol. You know the podcasts gonna be bullsh it when they start out saying they’ve had the chance to watch Ben grow 😂 I think the reason he’s in the situation he’s in is most directly related to his lack of growth as a basketball player and man. Thanks for coddling a dude that’s been coddled his entire life 🤦‍♂️
Lol. Dude has millions of dollars but it’s up to the 76’ers to get him help with his mental health. Poor me generation strikes again 😂🤦‍♂️Dudes a baby in a man’s body
Cant wait for the season to start & see the Nets ball!!!!
Thay all fried 😂 we know why u really got those glasses on JJ 🤣
We want a John Wall episode. Please JJ
I been defending bro for years literally saying the same exact stuff he’s saying i can’t wait for him to come back and go stupid
JJ went soft on this... It wasn't just the one pass in the playoffs. How about shooting 34% from the field and running from the line for the entire series.
Fantastic work, JJ!
Glad to hear Simmon's side of the story. It's unfortunate that nowadays people think athletes are not humans just because they make crazy money. And  the saddest thing is that  the worst criticism and hate is from former athletes.
Kevin’s wide open…NOPE! 🤣🤣🤣 Quote of the podcast!! Loved every second of it. Bens going to ball out this season 🙌🏼
This is such a great interview, wish Ben gets a great new start with a new team and really becoming one of the greats, he definitely has what it takes. Props to joe Tsai on taking the chance he’s a great owner
nothing you can say or do can redeem yourself in my eyes Ben.
Definitely rooting for Ben.
He was emotional he just got traded to the nets? He doesn't expect it? For real dude.  You asked to get traded and refused to play.i wasn't to like this guy but u just can't.  He's really young so I'm sure he'd  going to going to be better with age.
GOD bless❤❤
what a fruit cake
Judah recognize just because they look like us don't mean we have same plight
Gerald “Hubert” Huston really got Ben in his feelings lol no matter how many times he does that and flirts with girls using song lyrics, it’ll be funny
Ben is not one of us.
Thanks JJ and Ben, as an aussie myself i can defend Ben when he said all i want to do it is win, i dont care about my stats, growing up from a young age in Australia, your family/coaches/ mentors of what ever sport you play will always say "winning is the most important part of the game" and his play styles says that out aloud   love ya ben and have always backed ya, go easy on the magic big dawg
Get Joel on next week
If you're not injured, you play. That's always been the case in professional sports. It's only in this weak woke generation that they get to excuse themselves with "I'm in a dark place" bs.
I still don't understand why they want him to shoot?
this is easily the smartest career choice ben has ever made
Why did I click on this 😐
***ON FAR ACROSSSSSSSSS THE BLUE WATER FROM EAST ->>>TO WEST ***FROM NORTH  TO  SOUTH ->>>ETC...
That smirk
He did all of this Just to say he doesn't have mamba mentality.
I hope Ben sees this, do what you do best and fuck the haters.
Raptors fan here…. actually really love you.
He seems like a really good kid. But still: you are 6 years in the league and can`t develope a half way decent jump shoot? Posting all these videos during off-saison and then dont shoot the rock? And what was with all these contradictory statement coming out of his camp during all his absence?
***BABIES ARE THE FUTURES *** !!!
I disliked merely for the fact that Ben Simmons was on. Can't respect him.
JJ think he slick. They for sure smoked some of that ganja before the interview. 🤣
Jj is gonna change the way simmons play
Someone tweeted that JJ looks like Paul Rudd & now I can’t unsee it
I like how they got Mics like it's a post game interview.    JJ getting these players more comfortable and acclimated to the podcast.    He even brought out the shades indoor to emphasize he's hip like the young cats like Ben.    Jkin I'm just busting balls.  New listener and am looking forward to more.

Yo momma was brought to me…. by CASH APP!! 🔥
Can't wait to see Ben out there with two of the best scoring threats to compliment his game.
Bens a cool guy
The dude has shown zero improvement in 5 plus years of nba basketball. At best he got a little better on defense. People will see again this year in the playoffs the dudes a liability. In the hawks series he shot under 40% from the foul line. He’s a basketball player and Philadelphia asked him to attempt to shoot a basketball and he cried and threw a fit. Dudes satisfied with just coasting off his natural gifts. If he truly applied himself he would be worlds above where he is now. He beat out Donovan mitchel for Roy. No one would take Ben over Donovan anymore because Donovan works.
Ime Udoka next? 😂😂😂
I’ve always like Ben. He’s had some unfortunate events but he’s still valuable AF. Good to see him happy
Brookyln love you Ben can’t wait to see you shin here
Can’t wait to fucking see Philly vs Brooklyn bro Joel and ben are gonna go at each other bro😂😂😩
happy to be part of the 21k likes and oh, look at that 0 dislikes  amazing content
I love this show they're two great guys
The hawks series, everyone forgets the brick 3 pt shot that Embid threw up after Bens missed dunk.  Then Embid had another turnover.   After the game Embid throws Ben under the bus. That ain't a leader & Embid will never win a championship cos he's such an individual in a team sport.  Good to see Bens still got his confidence, can't wait to see him dominant.   Most of all I want to see Simmo leader the Boomers to a history making gold medal. Boomers culture is team 1st culture, like Ben was saying at the start of this podcast. It's about the team & winning.  Go Boomers , Go Benny & Paddy  💛💚💛💚
Great content. I’ve never seen Ben this open & comfortable. I think he will have a breakout season if healthy. I expect the Nets to make some real noise this year.
Great pod!
This young man winning ROTY.. book it!
Is it me or does Ben look high??
#1 trending on youtube, gorgeous work
So cool to hear from Ben on what has happened. Go get em this year man! (come back to Boomers squad ASAP!!!)
I wish him the best with Brooklyn
as a sixers fan i love and hate this man at the same time
Durant Kyrie and Ben about to win the title and the league is about to go crazy that Ben Simmons took two years off and won before emiid
50:04 breaks me. Dude is shit on so much he doesn't even believe in his own resume
Ben can easily average 12 assists this year no cap
I have a new found respect for Ben after this interview. You can tell he was talking from the heart. I don’t agree with his hold out, but I understand why he thought this was his best way forward. Best of luck for this season
That was fire
As an Aussie, this was awesome to watch. Great to hear Ben speak about this so candidly and get a better understanding about his situation. Will do a lot of good for his public perception I think. Hope he commits and plays for the Boomers at the next Olympics 🙏
Excited to see Simmons get back on the court
get Lebron bald ass on here soon lol
Devin Booker next?????
So glad to hear from Ben.  Seemed so obvious he was getting a bit of a bad rap.  Hope to see him shine again.  Great interview JJ.
Yes JJ! Kawhi Traveled!
JJ didn’t challenge Ben in this
Cap
Good job JJ and now everyone pretends they love ben simmons but I'm still annoyed as a 76ers fan. My criticism is on his game and passive playing style never cared if he missed free throws but attack the rim please at all times. He did the 76ers wrong and they also did him wrong so best that both sides now have a clean slate for this season. I never wish bad upon a player concerning their personal/off court life glad ben seems better mentally but also good riddance for the 76ers
Great interview but I wished they asked more about the nets with KD trade request and kyrie and everything going on there
Ben Simmons reminds me of a lightskin black Keanu Reaves.
ben im callin bs on some of what you said but carry on
Bro my wife threw her back out one time just trying to take a sweater off and that had her unable to do anything for months. And people are out here hating on Simmons because they think he couldn’t hurt his back unless he’s playing in a game? Ridiculous.
Ima winner is crazy
https://youtu.be/PTzVyuQRxvo
Cant wait for next season. Simmons and kahwi are probably the 2 players i want to see most next season.
glad you guys are back
#1 trending 1224am eastern
I said it before and ill say it again.  If Ben starts taking 1-3 threes a game even at a 29%30%.  Him running the point for the net with the two cobras at the wings in kyrie and KD.  Now that will be fun to watch.
Damn lol dude really still hurt over Philly fans realistic critique when we supported ole boy for his entire career here..bro every athlete gets the same treatment here..you weren't the first you won't be the last.
LeBron needs to come on this podcast. It would break the entire internet.
Not jj got a cashapp sponsorship
Best interview on youtube rn everyone wants to hear this
Good luck ben
"does everyone want to watch film with me... I can break down every play if you want..." That actually sounds really amazing. I'd be so in!
I like how he brought up the dude who called him Westbrook lol. Good stuff😂
Every comment praising JJ, not saying it isn’t deserved.. but thank you Ben for being transparent 💯 everyone knew/knows your a hooper!
55:27 pretty funny how he says if I’m hurt I’m hurt I’m not tryna sit out yet he sat 6 months with the sixers with no reported injuries until he came in one practice, fooled around, and got kicked out.  Dudes a snake, I don’t believe half of what he says.  Can’t wait till bum Simmons is back in Philly, we’re boutta treat you like the circus 😂 don’t punk out this time
He wish he was 5 yrs younger .. lol your output is what it is!! Stop it lol
Hi, i wanna get reply...
@JJ Redick, there was no travel on Kawhi’s drive. Let it go bro!! Lol
Glad to say I never joined the Ben Simmons hate train..dude is a great young player & a real competitor. I really can't stand the nets but I hope Ben has a lot of success.
God bless Ben Simmons ☝🏻
You could tell Ben loves Bron’s game he mentioned it a few times😂💯
The long awaited explanation
Ben Simmons is actually a really cool, knowledgeable, driven guy. Hearing him talk about the game is awesome. I’ve had so many misconceptions about him because of fans and the media, and I’m okay with admitting that. I’m hype to see him come back motivated and refined. He has so much potential. 🔥
Prayers for Ben Simmons strength. I'm going through a complete rebuild in my life and I've realized how hard it is to deal with the pressure that we put on ourselves. The entire state of Pennsylvania pretty much hates this kid and maybe 60-70% of New York. You can't be who you are destined to be until you can forgive yourself (not taking lay up/dunk) and believe in yourself again even when everyone doubts or even hates you. This interview I'm sure is exercising his demons. Once he says it out loud it becomes easier to believe and trust.
i still believe in him.
I actually have some sympathy for him now
that was really good
If Ben comes back 100%, couple that with an angry KD ready to take over to shut doubters up and Kyrie during a contract season in another prove it mind set. Simmons defending the best player on the other team, then KD n Kyrie taking turns on offense in paper is REAL interesting 🤔🤔🤔
Great interview - I legit hope that Ben Simmons just shows the world what an amazing player he is!
Dude is whiter than a pale brown paper bag
This guy is a cry baby. Mental health is real but this nigga couldn’t handle being called out by his colleagues..fragile bloke
Ben might be that missing piece for the Nets! 👀
Mastermind
Unpopular Opinion: Through it all Ben is still one of my 3 favorite players in the league. I just want to see the man redeem himself and shut everyone up sooooooo bad. But i guess all my favorite players are some of the most hated, 1. KD 2. Ja 3. Ben…… Im a Wizards fan but i’d be lying if i said i’m rooting for anyone more than the Nets this year
…it’s a trash organization let’s be real. The end
JJ should’ve asked tougher questions

Nets roster on paper is sick 1-8 although Bruce Brown is an underrated loss imo. If all healthy and available though going into playoffs they’re going to be a very tough out!

In the last 4 games of the season, Ben Simmons took 0 shots in the 4th quarter. In the entire series, he attempted only 3 shots in the 4th quarter. Ben had four games where he failed to even score double digits. Across seven games, he scored a total of 69 pts. In the final 3 games he has 19 pts. He scored 6 and 5 pts in their two elimination games. Season on the line, and he can only take 10 shots, and only score 11. 5.5 pts per game in elimination games. He barley scored more than Matisse Thybulle. Thybulle. The guy who scored 3.9 pts a game this year, and played half the minutes Ben did. He shot 25-73 (34.2%) from the line in the playoffs. That rate is the worst in NBA history with a minimum 70 attempts. He missed 48 FTs. As a team, the Nets only missed 28. He took 45 Fts in this series. He only made 15. Iff he goes 50% at the line, he would have had 20 more pts in the series. 89 pts in a 7 games series would still be bad, but it’s the difference between 12.7 pts per game, and 9.9. That is almost three extra pts a game. They lost two games this series by 3 pts. Even if he doesn’t take any extra field goals, just being mediocre FT shooter, might have been enough to win them one more game. But instead, he was the worst FT shooter ever, and the Sixers lost in 7.

Hi, i wanna get reply...
This is awesome. Good luck Ben!🙏🏼 well done team.
Depression and mental health is no joke and as much as the nba community rallied around Kevin Love and Demar Derozen when they were struggling with their issues, Ben got little to no support with his. Rooting for Ben to bounce back this year.
I am not sure about the new NBA theory that each day I sit on the bench I get better
BS new name is Candy boy
Nets abt to be soooooo filthy
Their is always to sides to a story. Glad he was able to clear that whole mess that happened in Philly.
Ben sitting stiff asf
Really hoping for Ben to have a sick comeback season. He’s the perfect piece on the nets and what they needed most
I live in ATLANTA and we all collectively don’t like Ben Not because he is not good, but because we don’t want him to play well because of Hawks. Watching this, I have all respect towards Ben Simmons and I can’t wait seeing him back It’s good for basketball and everyone who loves the game  JJ Redick is the best “journalist “ out there. Super smart, always open questions, never fake  Love it. Please let us know if you are coming to Atlanta  Also, would like Bogdan Bogdanovic interview  He is Olympic silver medalist, European League champion and respected NBA player  Thanks
Is this the fake " Drink Champ" ? Why are sport figures in the kitchen like chefs drinking white wine behind the scenario of red wine. JJ , you are not all that in Philly, stop acting like you're all that in Philly. We didn't win a championship with you or bs and his BS, you will be forgotten. ASK TOUGH QUESTION ,FAKE   DESMOND GREEN.
Finally !
Great interview, glad to see Ben in a great headspace. Can't wait to see him back on the court.
W Interview Ben!  Can’t wait for the comeback this szn😤
I tried but I couldn't! I couldn't get through the whole interview! JJ the whole time in this interview always finding a soft space for Ben Simmons to land in case he might run off and cry to his agent. So frustrating but not at all surprised. Ben chose this interview because he knew JJ wouldn't expose him. This is why "New Media" is Trash!!!!!
The problem with Ben with the general population is he doesn't seem like he cares , he is basically the same player he was when he walked into the NBA
The media really made him look bad like dude got some underserved hate for almost everything he's done but glad he's okay now. Also think some of the shooting hate is his guard positioning despite players like Draymond who's pretty much a point guard for gsw gets less slander for his shooting.
Ben Simmons takes no accountability on what happen between the Sixers and him....... honestly pathetic to watch all this manipulating instead of just being real and owning what happened
Brooklyn has so much dynasty potential if everyone gets in sync and accepts their roles.
Only dummies thought it was a phone! Shit was clearly stuffed with something else.
Good luck ben
Need an ime udoka podcast 😂
https://youtube.com/channel/UCkLljN1rLH9ZHHZgywXnEUw
This dude settled with the 76ers now he can talk. As long as you do your little part and make sure that my guy Kyrie the GOAT gets his due respect. You are just a side piece in the GOAT’s story. Once Kyrie wins the 2023 MVP, 2023 ASG MVP, 2023 Finals MVP, and 2023 scoring title, and averages a 50-40-90 seasons, all you vaxhead haters will shut your flabbing mouths. Ben Simmons, just stay out of the way and don’t mess it up! Get ready to guard CurMickey!!
NEW MEDIA 💪🏾
As a Sixer’s fan, and a Ben Simmons supporter throughout his career, it’s nice to finally have the questions answered that caused the disappointment I felt for Ben since the Hawks series, I never let the media sway my opinion of Ben because I knew it was all biased bs trying to get them clicks, but that off-season made me start to question it all, and I still never hated Ben I was just disappointed. But I still hope he has the best career he can have, just don’t win a title before Philly does.
Ben Simmons is a really cool guy
I loved this! Been rooting for him and defending him heavily! Generational talent! Glad he spoke out and is in a better space.
i absolutely love JJ Redicks podcasts
I’m assault and d
Great episode Guys, I appreciate y'all creating a safe space and allowing him to talk
Him or Zion the second coming of Bron!!! Plus shooting...
Hope you have a great season Ben10
As a former collegiate athlete and current athletic trainer - I have so much respect for Ben after this interview. In the past, mental health was not even a discussion in the realm of Mens Sports and shun in the locker room. So it’s great to be at a place where athletes can express and confront their challenges. We just don’t know what people are going through or what they’re enduring from day to day. I, as a fitness professional, we have to identify the mindset and push our athletes to another level AND be able to keep their mind in balance. Not easy. JJ, (Go Duke!) great interview! Kudos for providing a safe space for this young brother. Great job overall. This is very inspiring for me and all those who are watching and the youth out there. Let’s go BROOKLYN!!! 🏀 Much respect!! ✊🏾💪🏾🎯
wot about Ben being a dad to lana rhoades baby. he's her baby daddy
Interview Russ next when he leaves the Lakers
Still think the dude is soft. All I hear are excuses. Remember the timeline…
#1 ON TRENDING!!!
damn he barely owned up to anything
I was never on "a side" when it came to the Ben Simmons "drama" because I knew theres always more to what was being presented. But after watching and listening, Im officially on his side. I hope he plays  exceptionally well in Brooklyn
This guy is a bum... doesn't even know how to shoot a 3 pointer. Never gonna win anything. Not worth any money.
This The Ben Simmons Conversation bc this sure as hell wasn’t an interview.
“You’re saying KD is better than me?” 🤣🤣🤣 I swear I never thought I’d rock with JJ (don’t like Duke 🤷🏽‍♂️) but man he’s dope as hell. Great show, great pod
That Pacers dig was crazy 😂
Nigga look like a high school kid on the thumbnail
I just want to see Ben play again in the NBA. Play good basketball.
Ben just isn't a very good player. He makes excuses, doesn't want to improve his game......he's just not THAT guy.
JJ is such a great host. I felt comfortable on behalf of Simmons.
Is it true he cancelled on doing this interview 20 times due to the no spine injury??
Is JJ still on ESPN?
Am I crazy or did they not once mention Embiid?  Thats insane considering he has impacted both of their lives, maybe this was a bit more curated interview and asked not to mention certain people?
He’s young and immature- taking very little responsibility.  I’m not buying his good guy act.
Tommy is a W co host, great pod lads
This interview was what I needed to confirm what I suspected, that Ben Simmons is a 304.
47:26 PAUSE!!!!
Its a good interview,  but doesn't address a lot of the key issues around Ben . Free throw shooting fears,  pressure in the Finals,  the Offseason videos of shooting vs during the season . Rumours around Ben's work eithic. Not training much. How did he pass a physical @ Nets trade ? JJ let Ben off the hook a bit and Ben deflected.
How was draft night?  Ben Simmons - “It was long” JJ responds - “Long? You were the #1 pick. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
At 23:28 the claim ‘he didn’t respond’ is garbage. Actions speak volumes. Not playing for a season says more than any tweet.
Softball questions….would love to see Simmons do a challenging interview w/a Stephen A Smith or someone who’ll ask the hard questions.
As a Pacers fan........fuck that hurt lmao. It hurts because its true🤣.
Basically everything the media said was coming from people who were making up stuff. Ever since I started watching this show it has made me realize the media knows very little.
Rooting for you Ben ! Exciting times
He needs reps on the floor not a shrink. He is gonna stink
This interview gotta address the Michael Blackson allegations
The intro ad thing in the beginning was hilarious.
Great interview.  It was nice to be able to hear Ben’s side of things.
Ben finna be the same player.
I regret giving this p**** a view, not reddick, yall know who I am talking about, just here to comment, ***k this p****, WEAK, NO ROOM FOR THIS IN TODAY'S BASKETBALL. WEAK.
So pretty much this guy did nothing wrong at all lol
This is why Ben Simmons been my favorite player since his rookie year..
Yea JJ go play for the nets 😏😏
Ben and his team should be paying JJ & his team for the best PR Ben has had in his entire career!
I dont think I've ever head Ben speak. He sounds just like Steve Adams
You know how many comments ive got on tiktok asking me how our podcast went? lmaoo
Assuming not only the Sixers would have beaten the Bucks in the ECF as Toronto did, but assuming also that the Warriors would have suffered the same injuries it's a long shot for sure. The "what if's" of the Matrix-Narnia alternative reality are sick af
While whole basketball world waits to see if he will play....Whole Australia is waiting for him to dropp that fake American accent he is rocking to look cool!  Camon champ you were born in Australia and only moved to states few years back..HILLARIOUS
Agree this was great.
JJ- who the fuck is Timmy alter?  How did you become friends? He adds nothing- drop him or at least explain why I should care about his opinion?  Who is that dude?
Omg who is he? He looks familiar 🤔 😄
Still salty lakers didn’t get to draft him that year
Sure helps to hear Ben Simmons talk after all the messy gossip surrounding Ben last year.
dude played the victim. “i was guarding the best player” that’s why he he couldn’t shoot free throws in the Hawks series
Ben will be great next season just watch.
Jersey was tucked in your pocket not your phone GTFOH😂😂😂😂😂
I can't wait for this nets team to play. Just as Kyrie considers himself an artist I think Ben is an artist in an incredibly unique style of the game. When he talks about its easy for him to pass and his b-ball IQ is sky high it's his form of artistry and I can't wait to see nets big 3 create a symphony together.
Jj, pass the cake buddy🤣🤣
Great f@cking interview... As a Warrior fan I'm scared of these cats...
Don’t diss my pacers we trying
Can we see his back if he really undergoes surgery on his back
Bravo JJ and Ben
JJ is a legend
Why this edited and transitioned like a 2k mycareer cutscene LMAOO
I respect the questions and energy they all have
Every player in the league knows how soft Ben is. Now we all know how soft JJ can be when he really wants someone on his podcast to get them views. When all timers like Shaq and Chuck, who defend players all the time, are smokin this dude then you know it's the truth. This interview was weak as hell.
1:09 I need that cutout after Ben mentioned Heurter having 27+ 😂 someone got aired out
I’ve always thought Ben was spoiled mixed with entitlement and throw in immaturity. I believe having all these issues could lead to depression. The public scrutiny, i’m sure, was also a factor in his mental health. Good luck, I’ve moved on as a sixers fan.
Can't believe that he experienced all that personal matter while also dealing with so much hate because of basketball, Can't wait to see him play and I'm so excited for him!
Respect can be lost if of a gossip group
JJ KNOW DAMN WELL HE GASSED ONE UP WIT BENJAMIN SO HE LOWER HIS “ANXIETY” 🤣🤣🤣😎
Wow crazy episode 🤯 #2 on trending only behind BTS 👏👏
Just watched this a second time today , To me it just proves the media is the enemy of the poeple politically and in sports. Kinda sad they always try develop some false narrative. JJ you gonna own this next part of your life/career in the podcast/ media world.
JJ is brilliant.  The best interviewer in sports.
Ben is a good player but I don’t think he should be a point guard I feel like it’s limiting his ability and potential
Too bad Ben has never been a winner since high school and college. His biggest draft knock was being a non winner who doesn’t take criticism well, surrounds himself around yes men, look how that’s tuned out.
This is *Journalism* , JJ has graduated past being "media". Fantastic interview JJ and Co 👌
What a great interview. Was looking forward to hearing Ben’s pov. He is such a gifted athlete but because he isn’t able to respond to the crap that is posted about him people believe it.  Can’t wait to see him, KD and Kyrie going at it.  The Nets look good. Hoping for an injury free, trouble free season from this squad.
Brooklyn Nets winning the championship this year
Anyone know what sunglasses JJ is wearing? Too fresh
Was i the only one that googled Trae Young"s weight lol
Hi Raptors fans :)
Thanks for this podcast. It's so difficult to get chances to hear what a person got to say, when the media just tends to get the "stuff" they want out of you instead of listening to you for real. As the man has said himself, Ben Simmons definitely didn't handle the situation well back then, but JJ makes me able to understand more about what's ACTUALLY happening to him back then.  Majority of the media these days look for punchlines, views, attention and we start to get blind to what's happening behind the scenes. Crazy thing is we are getting used to this and personally I have to constantly remind myself what I hear might not be even 10% of the true picture.  Keep up the good work JJ, really appreciate what you have been doing and I am sure lots of others feel the same way.
hi my  names ben simmons, i make 500x your salary but love making excuses to not work, please gimme money
Well done JJ, awesome exclusive, Ben looks comfortable and happy something that was missing the last year or so while in Phily.  All the best for the season just around the corner.
He really said he wouldn’t do anything different!! and basically keeps pointing fingers like he did nothing wrong!! He didn’t learn anything. He’s a lame
So wait... A coach and star player dumping on their team mate in public and offering no support was the main issue, rather than the narrative that Ben was a petulent baby. Noooooo waaaaaaaay.
Does anybody like Ben more after this podcast ? I’m a Knicks fan and my answer would still be yes
Why couldn’t Ben just talk to the fans like this in Philly
I have to say I am witnessing one of the most brilliant actors in human history.
I can’t see Philly winning a chip before Ben does I feel like doc fucked the whole situation up
I feel like this is the first time I'm hearing Ben Simmons speak
I respect Simmons for calling out Shaq. Shaq himself said he never kept in touch with Kobe and several people that he knew making excuses saying how busy he is and after Kobe died, he said he would reach out to people more. Simmons is the perfect example of how much trash Shaq spews but never backs it up. Can't even have a man to man conversation and ask Simmons what's going on and see how he's doing but goes on camera and throws the kid under a bus.
He’s definitely not the same guy we seen in his last philly press conference I hope all is well for him Ben is definitely one of the best young talents in the league just extremely aloof
jj needs to get russel westbrook on this it would be amazing
Ben Shooting or Not Nets will still be in the finals this year. Ben Simmons starts getting buckets it’s gone be a three peat
Great interview. JJ is the GOAT
Ben will prove the haters wrong!
I don’t know why, but this is interview feels the least natural of all JJ’s episodes. Like it feels like a typical interview as opposed to his signature more natural banter he would have with other guests.
I'm so excited to see what Ben and the Brooklyn Nets can do this season. All that pain for Ben is going to lead to something promising, trust and believe that.
Whenever you feel bad, remember Every struggle in your life has shaped you into the person you are today. Be thankful for the hard times, they can only make you stronger.🤞🏽💯
This guy’s a tool on and off the court… One of the most arrogant athletes I’ve ever had the misfortune of meeting… So glad the 215 is free of this malignant tumor…
This was a good interview
Check out my tribute to the King of Pop!  https://youtube.com/shorts/d_nZJmwgJlU?feature=share
We finally get to hear what Ben has to say
Talk ya shit Ben !!!!!
JJ is the 🐐 for getting Ben on his podcast
Great to see Ben Simmons happy and in good spirits. Thank you JJ and team for providing him a forum to speak freely and get the real story out there. All the best to him this season. Hope he crushes it.
21min Ben: “But it’s for sure one my my weaknesses. What am I gonna do get mad at people for saying I’m not good at something. Cool. Imma practice and get better. It is what it is.”. WTF?!? You cared heaps about it m8, and your weaknesses on offence got worse not better.
Gained a lot of respect for Ben hearing all this it takes a different kind of person to not respond ONCE to all the media n all that negative mainstream can’t wait to c him play ball again like JJ said if he’s out at the 5 w all his abilities the Nets will either b the 1 or 2 seed in the East easily
So boring to listen to
hair products from sephora is crazy LOL
Wish you asked him when can we see him in an Australia jersey next! Stay strong Ben ❤️
Ben is so underrated Embiid choked
Freaking serial killer working the camera
wow!  finally you are back!! I've been waiting for u JJ - a fan from South Korea
Not a lot of guys would sit down with Ben Simmons and ask good questions.
They guys start capping around 57 minutes
No matter the regular season shot creation statistics, it's undeniable that Ben needs to get used to shooting and being a threat outside the paint if he wants to handle and distribute the ball. I hope he understands this and takes the challenge head on, because even with a poor outside shot, he'd be an incredible player if he was willing to at the very least keep the defense honest.
Plot twist: jj offers his shooting superpowers to Ben Simmons
The best thing about the podcast....JJ's ads. DUDE PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO AD
I bet he will play maybe 20 games than out for season again
this BS interview is full of BS. i didn’t know the interviewers job is to help illustrate lies. ben literally said he knew trae was coming over on the help then jj says to be fair you didn’t know it was trae. like what. ben literally just confirmed he knew trae was there 😂 new media is so phony
Ben Simmons paying his fines through Cashapp...that's money
He seems like a cool person. But he definitely questions himself too much & expects high praises. I can See KD struggling on how to communicate with Ben with out hurting his feelings.
52:00 geraldhuston 😂
Ben did you say Bron is not athletic?
The name is B. Simmons. And the B stands for beeyotch. What a weak slack jawed mealy mouth wimp.
Ben fuckin 10😤🔥
Been watchin since the first episode and now your podcast is the number 2 trending video😂. Life’s crazy but keep on grinding JJ💪
Tremendous
This dude said kawai went robot mode 😂
Bruh when JJ said you are an accomplished player Ben face lit up…I hope bro come out and ball so hard. Everyone isn’t built the same and that’s okay bruh✊🏾✊🏾
my opinions on Ben..  *before watching:* could’ve been an MVP LeBron-esq type of player but he never developed or added anything to his game and now is using mental health to hide his obvious deficiencies and lack of accountability.  *after watching:* I was a supporter up until the hawks series and this didn’t really change my thoughts but I honestly can’t wait to see this man play in Brooklyn so he can silence everyone’s doubts and criticisms including mine.
You guys are the goats with this one ❤️❤️❤️
No accountability still. Can't wait til we face this clown. Maxey is our guy now! We good! You are not a part of Philly and never was! Stop it!
I didn't watch the whole thing. Did they ever ask Ben Simmons that is it okay to him that a million dollars paid basketball player cannot make simple jump shots?
oh my god im turning into a Ben Simmons fan help
Always been a Ben fan, hope he bounces back this year
❤! Check out this video 👉 https://youtu.be/JieFtfvnNe8
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱BORING!!!! HE'S  SOFT  LIKE  TISSUE,  HE IS CHOKER!!!!!!! HE IS LIKE CARSON WENTZ  HE GAVE UP ON 76ERS  FANS!!!! GO SIXERS🏀❤️💙
Tommy and JJ make it so easy to like players
Translate in French Please !!
Great interview. Nice to see Ben open up to some really hard topics there. I can't wait to see Ben back on court and run an absolute muck. I really hope Ben has one hell of a season to silence everybody that has doubted him
The sixes will never win a championship with Harden/Embiid combo. The east is not weak.
I love Ben Simmons despite all the criticism. He didn't need to explain himself he's a good dude and people  will never understand when you are going through mental issues.
Damn, Ben cranked those softballs way out of the park. Great pitching JJ.
I hear a lot of finger pointing from Ben. He blames the 76ers organization and his teammates and took no personal accountability.
41:00 😂 I’m sick of this shtt
I wish you’d asked him why he’s never suited up for the Aus team, no real hate for why he hasn’t, id just love to know his reasons as I feel like the culture and the old heads in the Aus team (Jingles, Patty etc) would have been great for Ben, probably would have been a boost to Ben’s confidence and his ability. Keen to see him play again!
About time he told his side. Too talented to let media keep beating him up for what they feel he should, as opposed to appreciating what he does so well.
Anyone know what wine they’re drinking
JJ a real one 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
get Gregg Popovich
13:45  "I wanna get easy buckets" *passes ball out 5 feet from rim*
I can’t wait to Simmons back. Great interview
I watch the hole interview 🔥
I’m a 76ers fan But I’ll never understand hating anyone   I was sad they couldn’t work things out   Best to Ben and his loved ones
No mental health issues his rookie year lol guys full of lies 😢😂
This is what I was waiting for. Ben is a good dude
This clown WILL claim "back injury" and "mental pain" ALL year.. and get paid!!...watching the games from the bench in neo/orange tracksuits wit blue shades on ..or did i jus make all that up..🤔😳😐🙄
On top of that the whole mental health thing was disgusting and wrong. He completely lied about that. It’s awful people use that as a cop out. Go get engaged again and order another Starbucks Ben. No one fux with you lol you don’t have respect from many
Ben doesn’t sound like a guy that will ever be a star player.
Ben Simmonds this is Mitchell bade.. I have zero respect for him. White Pickett fence life and then a lil confrontation left him shoooooooook. Ben’s a scrub
Ben Simmons handled this really well.
This dude is weak I’m not even watching but it came across my feed. Mental health? He played scared and couldn’t handle the criticism.
It’s amazing that you can change from disliking to liking someone after hearing their story and perspective. Major props and respect to Ben for doing the pod. I was surprised he did this.
JJ: best basketball podcast out there. Period.
19:04 Ben really shading Trae Young 👀
I have never felt a comment more than when JJ said “You don’t want to be in the middle and do what the pacers have done for the last 20 years.”  As a Pacer fan there has never been a more true statement and why it’s the worst team to root for 😂. Painful mediocrity
Goodness. What a child. Grow up. Smdh. What a bum
After 25 mins in I glad I got to here from Ben yo I respect bra
JJ you are the goat
This interview was kinda lazy on bens side little to no context
The prank guy is Gerald Houston he is hilarious 😂😂😂
Only JJ can bring the best of everyone huge shoutout to him for making Ben feel open and safe
Pretty sure my grandmom wrote most of these comments.
So many questions that just were not asked… why did Ben not mention that he was physically injured until after he was told he would be fined? Follow the timeline
Geezus jj is so far ahead in the podcast game, damn
Ben looks to be in a better space. Good luck Ben.
These guys did a great job with this interview They asked all the questions that needed to be asked but weren't a holes about it
oh man ben simmons boutta remind the world how good of a player he is. im def excited for him - he's a beast, he can do everything harden could for the nets plus plays incredible defense lmao thats just crazy
Crazy I was at that Cleveland game. Legendary 🔥🙏🏾
he said he wouldn't do anything different is kind of ignorant.
cant wait to watch this king play for my brooklyn nets baby lets go
Whoever's reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone have a fantastic day! Amen
S/O to Gerald Houston lmfaooo
Fantastic show guys! Best of luck to Ben....looking forward to seeing back on the court.
Damn you guys didn't ask him if he thinks he shoots with the wrong hand?
As sixers fan I can’t be mad at him as a person . He seems like a good dude . But what he did to organization sitting out the entire season is hard to forgive .
A+ content JJ.  Simmons is a good guy  but he’s been a little out of touch it seems.  He’s bright and a thinking man and I think he can get back to the very top
I’m a Ben Simmons fan
Gerald hudson is the guy in the candy shop 😂😂😂 he does that to a lot of celebrities. I thought it was staffed at first because he’s constantly “running” into celebs
Bro, best interview I have seen in a long time.
"in your first rookie year"😭😭😭
Ben using the word "Dickhead" - he's an Aussie, bless him ! Great chat - good to see him well.
Bout time JJ we fucking missed you guys
This lame video is the reason mates shouldn’t interview each other. Was really looking forward to this video. What a let down. It was so underwhelming.
My boy ben we miss you playing bro
yall should bring on alex jones and andrew tate. that would be a podcast
Been here 17 mins already and I’m just waiting for them to talk about Ben’s willingness or lack there of to shoot the basketball… it comes in round the 21-24 min marker correction
“Don’t talk if you don’t know!” Wise words from Ben talking about Shaq. Commentators should take heed. Great interview and getting to know Ben and his journey. Happy that Ben could feel relaxed with his friends in this interview. JJ hits a home run again! Always helps players bring out so much about their lives and journey. It’s been impossible up to this point to understand what went on for Ben. HAVE AN AWESOME SEASON! 💥🏀🏀🏀💥
bruh finna come back a demon! mark my words 🤞🏾
I still stand behind ben, and still think hes waaaaaay better then Draymond green.
I love the old men and three but i think we need someone else who is not too close to Ben and interview him. Ben and JJ are friends.
*Still afraid to shoot you overpaid BUM!*
JJ  and Tommy know how to phrase the questions so perfectly. Im sure he didnt share all the details but they got Ben to talk about some deep sh*t. Glad he finally came out and shared his side about the past year
im suprised people rsleeping on the nets
we need the video on spotify. not just the popcast voices
What an interview to come back with JJ !!!
I definitely appreciate Simmons for finally talking. I have to say that after hearing him talk, it seems like he'll just be the same player he's always been. No better, no worse. I think that's just the level of player he is. I don't expect him to be an all-star again, now that there are some much better point guards in the east. Nonetheless, I think the Nets will be very good, and I think Simmons would make a great small ball center. I'm curious to see how Simmons will handle the playoffs, when teams stop guarding him. That's where he's typically struggled the most
JJ Redick is the GOAT
Here's the thing. I completely understand and agree with everybody's criticism of Doc and his handling of the situation. From the post game interview after the hawks series to kicking out of practice and a bunch of other stuff. HOWEVER! I really hate this narrative of Joel throwing Ben under the bus. The moment everybody talks about is the post game interview when they asked Joel "what was the turning point of this game" and Joel talks about Ben passing up the shot. The problem is that is just a clip of his full answer. Joel spoke about 3 moments that lost them the game; Ben passing up his shot, Joel getting and turnover and Matisse fouling a jump shooter. That was his full answer and it's %100 true. Those three plays happened consecutively and they (together) were the turning point.
Ben Simmons not being able to shoot is not a “ narrative “. It’s a fact based on empirical data
Mental health misconstrued
Immaturity comes out right away with him
it's easy to guard a guy who refuses to shoot
Ha!  When the candy store incident came up, it sounded too much like Hubie.
For me personally, I need him to be more specific about what he was going through for me to believe  that this was about his mental health and not just basic pettiness. I had my own break down and departure from work due to depression and anxiety a couple years back. I think the way he describes having been in a certain state, and having recovered from that state, I can understand. His behavior could very well have been erratic and unexplainable, even to himself - when you're constantly in that fog of mental illness you make irrational and emotional decisions mainly out of self preservation. You can't think through your actions clearly, you are just trying to alleviate any stress and pain possible because your system is overworked to the point of extreme exhaustion. So. If he can intelligently speak on that side of things, I'll support him wholeheartedly. But the vague references, the demanding his paycheck despite not playing, the history of non development in terms of working on his game or giving effort. I just can't take him at his word when his actions prior to his absence were lackluster, and his reflections now are so very shallow.
Ben happy for you Fam good luck on this 22-23 season bra
S/O to JJ for serving them softball questions at his friend, gtfoh man.
Yea he’s ready
him guarding the best player on the other team has nothing to do with that play on trae ... he still hasn't come to be accountable for it smh
biggest bust in sixers history... how can someone make it to the NBA and can't shoot... I don't getvit
Great to finally here from him. He has shown a lot of maturity and composure not lashing out at ridiculous claims from the media. If he comes back healthy the Nets are dangerous.
Man I love hearing Ben's side of certain situations. Seems like a cool dude that's misunderstood. Glad he agreed that he didn't handle some things right
“It’s fun guarding the best players in the world” that’s why I will always love Ben
0:14 legit doing that right now lmaooo
Got me crying at the end of an OM3 podcast. What an interview. Thank you!
No matter what you think of him, I guess it's nice to see him in this 'new' vibe. I'm a 76ers fan and I really wish he can get it together and change the momentum of his career.
The way Ben smiled after receiving the compliment from JJ. W Mans 22:08
JJ didn’t ask the real gritty questions, positive PR MOVE for Ben Simmons and Rich Paul
JJ being super modest about his defense... Used to put the CLAMPS on Harden like Ginobli did.
if this man could barely walk limping everywhere the nets should have immediately ruled him out for the year. everyone was just saying he wasnt mentally ready.
Great interview. non athletes don’t understand injuries, and amateurs don’t understand nba level physical mental pressure. Have to say, Ben comes off as a righteous guy. Humble, nice and aware. I’m rooting for him.
so glad to see Simmons grow from his past struggles. Hope he's able to get to his best
Nobody guards Kevin and Nobody guards Kyrie......first round exit...
Booooo! This was lame. I always like your interviews but this was not that at all. Every playoffs, for years, he was ousted in the 2nd round. Why? Because every year he would end up standing in a corner afraid to take a shot or get fouled and unable to actually perform his basketball duties. It didn't just happen in that last Atlanta series. It happened every year in the playoffs. This is why the fans wanted him to shoot. It's not because we didn't appreciate his talents, it's because his talents were not effective in the plkayoffs when the games were on the line. Where was that question? This was a puff piece plain and simple. Booooo.
I hope Ben Simmons comes back this SZN and has a good year In Brooklyn and put the past behind him.💯
Great show. Great interview. Excited for Brooklyn and Bens new journey in basketball. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kd definitely got Ben talkin his shit
th/u JJ  and Tommy for showing bens true plight and not like the other drama media
More podcasts than 3 pointers itself
Very weak, JJ. You’re becoming a member of the media more everyday, shame.
See you in the conference finals Ben. Happy you're better.
Wishing Ben the best, and can you explain how he passed the physical to be traded? Peace.
Looking at comments about Ben from instagram and other media forms over the last couple years, I'm so glad that I'm not in the public eye. It seems literally exhausting. I mean dang, no matter what he say or what happens to him, people are gonna continue to kill him. But we always talk about how "men should feel comfortable expressing themselves." But when they go through it, who's the main people shooting them down? The fellas. Thats why I'm glad I'm a nobody, because they always have to hear "oh well they're not dealing with anything major. You wanna talk about real problems, look at what normal everyday people go through." I think we forget rich people are normal people too, with real feelings and emotions. They make mistakes just like we do. And until we can treat them with the same level of human decency and kindness and empathy that we treat others, we as a society are never gonna progress. And I know someone's gonna say I'm soft and exuding weakness or whatever. But who cares.
I’m glad I finally got to hear Ben side of everything
Im expecting to see some mid range jumpers from Ben. I believe this season is gonna be his best yet, so many people doubted him and now he's locked in
Breakout season. I can feel it
whatever his issues.... we all know the Front office and the coach of Philly are extremely overated
Gerald huston the guy that was in candy store usually goes up to people n say they a random celebrity they look like or if they’re famous he calls them a different name its just a troll lol
I really enjoyed this. It was awesome to hear Ben’s side. I’m really confident in the type of player he is going to be. He is in a good place mentally and excited to play. Brooklyn got this 🔥🔥🔥
JJ and Tommys ad reads have got to be the worst/best of any podcast out there. Guys sound like AI trying to speak with human cadence but its so fucking funny. Love the pod guys.
That candy store prank was definitely funny
did Ben really say Huerter is the best player on the Hawks?? 😂😂 1:09:23
Y u all even talking too him his career is OVER!!
One of my favorite players in the  league I hope he casts out some demons on the court this season and balls out.
completely!
30:47 us Raptors fans dont hate you JJ but stfu about it haha
JJ I love you bro. Of course I don’t know the guy personally, but I can smell bulshit from a mile away
Ben should’ve done this interview much earlier. Not saying there won’t be hate but he needed a PR consultant to help with his image when he was in Philly. He got the bag already so let’s hope he revitalizes his motivation. On a side note, I hope owners take back control of their organizations and not let the players play GM any more.
I have been a lifelong sixers fan. Before this interview I had a not so great feeling about ben and his non shooting and all that. The Atlanta hawks game and shooting 3's. I am so glad I saw this podcast because it gives me a whole different outlook on the whole ben situation. I just wish he would have said most of this while still in a sixers uniform. I now wish him all the luck in the rest of his Career. Of course another player that will be way better after they leave the sixers. Guess it's part of being a sports fan it's bound to happen.
This man is a liar. Jersey was in your phone? You didn't care about the money but file a grievance for 20m when you didn't earn it? nah Ben, you cant slide with this.
We need doc rivers side of the story
What a great video! Thank you for this Gem! Brooklyn Nets are going to be the 2022-23 champions.
great episode. When is the footage you cut out gonna air? Hard cut right in the middle of the Atlanta portion of the conversation. We want Ben unfiltered followed by Joel unfiltered!
Awesome seeing Ben speak freely on a trusted platform. Great interview 👍🏾
I enjoy these interviews JJ...thanks for the content because its been too long since basketball talk.....still waiting for the season to start...taking forever
As a veteran it's great to hear an entitled athletes take on mental health.
Glad to see this guy is in good spirits. I was neither a Sixer's fan nor a Simmons fan but I've never been an advocate for straight up hating on a professional athlete. He's had to put up with a lot and I hope he comes back stronger next season.
1:14:40 this is that craziest shot JJ was talking about  https://youtu.be/tUZe8VgS_0Q?t=80
I wish Ben was with the clips I’d take Paul over Ben
Yooo Ben simmons kinda movin like the Milkman
When Ben took a sip of wine as soon as JJ mentioned "the narrative" is indicative of him hearing all the noise, similar to first month's rent smh..
Nets would do really really well if they used Ben like the Spurs used Boris Diaw. Set Ben up at the free throw line so he can hit shooters or cutters while still have the option to score in the best way he can, which is in the paint.
Could you imagine randomly playing golf with jj reddick
i actually respect Ben alot more from this podcast.  Doc seems like a douche given what Ben explained.  Trying to set him up for failure.  Some leader Doc is.
Listening to this and thinking back to the way G Arenas the whole Simmons situation last season you can tell he was someone held back in defending Ben cause he  he always wanted to say more but didn’t want to until Ben was ready it will interesting what he says now that Ben spoken cause he could end saying more than Ben did
The conflict between team management and players about injuries is REAL. As he said if I’m hurt I’m hurt bro I’m not trying to sit out.  I have been diagnosed wrong just so I could be on the court and then they hit you with the you’re not wrong mentally when you’re complaining smh.
A NBA player that is worth millions really has ads in the middle of a interview? I’m not talking about the YouTube ads, the ones JJ voices over… not needed.
Awesome awesome, let bro talk
Great interview. Good to hear Ben talk his piece
🔥🔥🔥🔥 jj back
Ben is a cool guy
Only critique, Ben keep your head up instead of looking down when you speak.
So why did he file a grivance for 20 million? And why did he really want out?
I'm happy Ben is in a better space today I definitely am rooting for him to do well this season. Great interview
Damn bruh ain’t score once in the hawks series bc he literally couldn’t and he was forced to play 💀 then shitted on by the fans after risking his health 💀💀💀 ima heat fan but I miss healthy Ben on 6ers
I’m not gon lie, I feel like he said a bunch of nothing.
Joel & Doc let him down
If i got anything from this interview its that the media can really over exaggerate and make situations seem worse then they are bro looks like he’s in a good space
Ben such a chill dude … i see why he pulls all these baddies lol pause but it’s facts
The problem he will have with the nets is kyrie and kd do not move well without the ball and kyrie is a reluctant passer.  Defensively they'll be fine orebs wise weak. They'd best use Ben in a mid post game where he plays point forward. They might be best in the transition game. Transition wise he offers similar to magic . Frankly,  though he can guard 1-5 its best they pick one and use him as a 3 and D guy. Except in certain spots as a defensive rebounding 4. Ie let him guard 2,3 and an occasional 4 otherwise he's a help defender who can be great as the doubling man. Unique and awesomely different skill set. The play is the " moment " but it wasn't the only moment . It's highlighted because it was "  one of the last moments " of that contest fans were hyped and it was anti-climatic.
This is great to hear. Been anticipating the return of OM3 - great guest as a return in Simmons. Love the balance between relating to and realism with the guest.
Ben Simmons when healthy is the best defensive player in the league
I actually really like this guy. I fw him.
This dude is chill he just needed to have someone support and listen to him like actually listen to him!
Amazing pod JJ! Thank you for giving Ben this platform, it was great to see this side of him.
Ben seems like cool dude. I feel for him. I wonder why he didnt talk about his dad, he is clearly who he got his height and basketball IQ from. He talked about always knowing he would go to the nba since a kid, well yeah. your dad is a 6'9 brotha from the Bronx.
@ Ben Simmons can’t to see you back on court bro keep grinding
If you like women's softball this is the interview for you to listen to.
Cuz , you don't have no friends in Philly. Your not part of Philly. No one in Philly likes you. You still don't get it. Go back to Australia. #bum.
A healthy Ben KD and Kai gone be 🔥🔥
ben real for dis
The explanation for the non-dunk in the Hawks series is a prime example of his lack of accountability. Constant deflections & revisionist history. I'll always appreciate Ben for what he did in Philly & wish him all the success, but dude obviously hasn't learned anything from his experience.
Guys vote yes on prop 27 !
Seems like a great dude, happy he’s in a better place.
as a life-long Sixers fan, its great to hear Ben break his silence on this. Great job JJ, as always. Ben, as you said, you wouldn't be here if not for the roller coaster ride in Philly. I truly hope things are on the up and up with you my man...!
Good interview but we definitely want to hear a conversation that goes a bit deeper. Still was fun to listen to, thanks yall!
I think that having Jimmy Butler there for a year was probably the worst thing for the 76ers. His attitude and "Im the only real MF" mindset rubbed off onto Joel and its split the team. The chemestry has never been the same since he left and how Joel expects to make it work with Harden, who doesn't care about winning, I have no clue.
Casual penfolds quantum in the background 😂
Pacers , correct except for 04 2012-14
So How was his phyiscal pass then? Somebody please explain.
Haven't put a pod out since Jerry west  said GTFOH 😂😂😂
i hope dude go crazy next year! too much hate on bro
Looking forward to seeing what Simmons does this year.  Simmons and Durant will be fun to watch.
19:17 Trae Young weighing 200lbs is hilarious 😂
goat podcast
Glad Ben is feeling better mentally & physically. I'm a big fan of JJ reddicks podcast, however I feel this interview lacks alot of tangible questions, they just danced around the whole Philly departure fiasco, JJ could have pressed for a bit more like current relationship with Embiid, Doc etc. The interview lacked some closure but glad they got him to seat for a chat
Good stuff. First time I’ve seen this. JJ seems to ask the same question I wanted to hear from Ben. I hope you go far JJ 💪🏾👍🏾
I hate u Ben Simmons
Thanks JJ for making Ben Simmons seem more relatable, likeable and humane. Seeing him on the bench wearing those ridiculous outfits when his team got swept by the Celtics pissed me off
What. An. Interview.
This interview showed me how soft Ben is smh I'm glad he gone
JJ you a goat for this. I never heard anyone say Kyrie is a Scoring Guard lmaooooooo
The wonders of a good interview to take back control of a narrative he even got went for the conservative look wool polo with the pocket 😂 his PR team did good work but naw this was a good interview tho athletes deal with a lot behind the scenes and the media just does and say whatever tf they want glad he chose to speak up finally
Rebuttal on the process , JJ said “they missed on their picks” let’s have some context here, the person who acquired those picks was pushed out by the NBA and the NBA but Colaneglo  in charge and he put his pathetic son in power who, drafted Fultz instead of Tatum and harassed his own players on Twitter through a burner account. The process could have won if the NBA didn’t sabotage it to send a message.
Can’t wait until the day Tommy asks a question without mentioning that they talked to other people about it first
Love hearing about self doubt. No matter where you are in life you will always have a moment where you're questioning yourself especially in your career.
lol have to change the name of the show after this
Great interview. They acknowledge their bias. Humanize Ben. Pulls the viewer behind the curtain. I also want to shoutout Tommy: his interviewer skills have shot up this season, less timid, visibly more comfortable, salient questions. Love to see it.
this dude ruined the nba
People really need to relax about Ben Simmons shooting. Jason Kidd couldn't shoot for shit til way later in his career and he was still considered a HOF before then. Simmons is still a really young player he can still evolve as a player
Look at that smile. He is like I got paid for doing nothing! Thanks for Rich Paul for overhyping my potentials when I won’t and can’t shoot. I am terrible at the free throw line too!
The sad part of this, is that media, won’t apologize for their childish behavior and speculation. Perk, SAS etc… espn.. made money on criticizing this kid, hopefully these people, who ridiculed him, don’t run into karma..
Feels like that Penfolds bottle was strategically placed. But maybe the Amaro Nonino wasn't?
Great interview fellas. Being that you guys had a prior relationship with Ben he was very open to your questions. I’ll be rooting for Ben, just not against the Knicks😂
Ben Simmons is a 🐱
I had no idea tommy alter is actually a big time producer
This is your daily reminder that ben and Kd are gross together. Ben Kd and Kyrie??? dumb.
The “Who’s fault was it?” Counter: Everyone else = 18462038 Ben Simmons = 0
As Sixer fan it’s good to finally get his take on the situation. Man if only Ben could’ve gotten in the right space sooner. I like our team now but if he grew into his potential with us it would’ve been a problem.
Tatum would have won that ROY over Donavan easily
Im glad we get a chance to see Ben Simmons just relax and give his take on things.  He gets alot of hate and in my opinion Alot of it is unwarranted.  He does need to work on a jumpshot though but besides that he a has accomplished a lot to only be 26.
Thank you JJ and Tommy! This is how you interview, just felt like mates hanging out and chatting. Keep up the awesome interviews. All the best for Ben this year and happy to see him in a good place. 🔥
This was a s**t interview. Soft!  Player media not asking any of the hard questions.  It's not even media.  Kiss a** interview.  We deserve better from JJ.
Even though some of the criticism is fair, I think people put way to much hate on Ben. Honestly after watching this he seems like a very nice person regardless of his on court abilities
The sound is horrbile... please try to fix it for next time.  Great podcast!
👏🏼👏🏼
Bro this might have been the biggest bromance ive ever heard….sad that as smart as JJ is he would be so gullible to fall for a narcissist. Must have been a favor for someone to butter him up for an hour…
Okay great interview. Ben said he felt like his teammates threw him under the bus, but then he said he was guarding the best player on the Hawks Team and added that Kevin Huerter had 27 points! I feel like he said more on the recording but it was cut. Was that not throwing Seth Curry under the bus? Or because it's him that can be a simple critic?  I feel like he is still not taking responsibility for what he hasn't done but was expected to do for a player of his caliber/value... Also why didn't they ask him about his relationship with Joel Embiid today?
JJ finding a really tiny excuse to talk about his game winner. His ego really shows. Not complaining though.
Damn what savage and inaccurate slam on my Pacers.  We had several contending teams over consecutive seasons.  We hit a real rough patch with injuries these past 3-4 years.
Hey man, watching your videos get me through work so I’m thankful that y’all are back. I hope you guys enjoyed your break.
I was surprised that he actually got that confused from coaches about taking shots.   I remember when I started playing I could not shoot to save my life but I would chuck up at least 3-4 jumpshots a game because I played on principle not IQ meaning I wasn’t a knockdown shooter but I would still take open shots & some forced shots.   Eventually I learned through that when & how to shoot which seems like something Ben hasn’t really gotten down in-spite of being a pro but maybe he played with the coaches in his ear too much. Just my observation
BORING
Good interview
Shout out to ben !! Always takes guts to go on and take a interview regarding personal things that happened and he handled it all really well and jj is always the man!
Interview of the year in the sports world easily people been tryna hear from this man for over a year now and jj was the first
What a wonderful interview, which is NOT unusual for JJ.  Wishing Ben the best!
can some one do time stamps
What a great interview. Can’t wait to see Ben back in the NBA even if he’s shooting 3s instead of passing to an open Kevin 😂
Happy for him fr
This kid man. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Great, great, interview!!!
kawhi didnt travel you salty bozo lol, great pod tho
Ben Simmons is displaying some really selfish, egotistical, vain and childish behaviour in this interview. Examples: - "Things come easy to me" and "got fined for not lifting weights but I'm the f***ing strongest in the team" naturally gifted but doesn't want to put in the work to improve. Opposite of a Giannis type player, who is all work. - "Wanted to do right by the team" but turned up to training camp and didn't work hard in training. - "They could have flown out to LA to see me but they didn't" egotistical and wanted everyone to come to him. - Pass in Atlanta game "but I don't know why it was a big deal" but listen carefully, he didn't say "I made the wrong read and should have dunked" he skirted around it like a teenager.
Great interview old man and the three podcast is on its way !
I didn’t think Simmons should have won Rookie of the Year. I thought Donovan Mitchell should have. I’m not a Ben Simmons fan but I hope mentally he’s where he needs to be. Now he has to prove it on the court and I hope he has a great season!
Donovan REAL ROY
If it wasn’t about the money, why did he sue the Sixers for $20 million? Genuinely curious here.
Legendary episode Y’all need Giannis on this pod
It’s funny cause that guy pulled up on Ben with the russel Westbrook joke has done it before to rondo calling him Chris Paul and I don’t know how they haven’t see it
One of montverdes finest
Don't let your emotions overshadow your talent 💯💯💯
1:10:00
Good to get him...  He should have spoken up A LOT sooner tho & stopped ppl's gossip.  ; Would Be NICE To Get A Lil' More 'Family 'Friendly'  versions  tho  guys....  ; Be aware that there are tons of Dads  wanting to watch,  w/  little 1's  around the house.  ; )
Not being a willing shooter, or a poor shooter, or a inconsistent shooter is one thing, but NOT shooting at all as a team's  2nd beat player will never work. He HAS to shoot the ball
Thanks for the interview with Ben. Really appreciate the inside scoop when there was all the drama going on.
He knew he was always going to the league but never worked on a jumpshot???
He the worst Hardden would of got us to the conference finals worst trade in NBA history
I think Ben is going be on his James Brown...Big Payback tour this year.
Lord. Watson, Simmons... I'm tired of all these new waive athletes needing to sit in a shrink's chair.
They better give him rookie of the year this season
This is so much better that mainstream media.  Real conversation. Kudos to you guys! Very good job! I hope Ben finds his happy place! This goes beyond basketball! ❤
He sound like young don
Before I finish this video I feel ben looks like he is in a better place as I loved the 76ers he is now in a better role at the nets which we need defensively. As an Australian im truly proud of you Ben through thick and thin mate  you pulled through the rubbish time to show what your truly made of
As a Sixers fan , screw u Ben
He seems so cool why people hate em ? I dont get it
legit preparing a snack just to sit here and enjoy this
He called trae young a water bug 💀💀
I got no sympathy for Ben, he said he's the strongest on the team which shows me he still doesn't get it, it's a team and he isolated himself and made everything about him.  The problem with this guy mental health is that he's selfish, plus embiid didn't throw him under the bus, he's literally blamed himself the entire season.  You took your issues and did the same thing in Brooklyn and it's part of the reason Durant wanted to leave.  Your a weak mentality player,and now you hold this media. Podcast as if your a 20 year veteran looking back on his career....weak, all this does is make me believe that your career is down if in a coach or a GM I'm staying clear of Ben Simmons
Best basketball podcast hands down.
Thx JJ ! Love the videos! Been watching bronco fan podcasts & it’s getting outlandish ! This was a refreshing episode
Trying to find out what wine they were sipping on.
JJ good to see you're back but please STOP DUCKING JERRY WEST
This interview is gonna help Ben’s public perception so much. Besides the fans in Philly.
Yoo now I see Ben in a totally different way fr, the media made him look like a bad guy
And no one is hating on smfh lol
1:00:18 lies he don’t care bout the money? 🤦🏾‍♂️ u clearly did bc u went after them for ur salary can’t stand Ben and I’m a Nets fan
Devin booker please
Bro Ben is a jump shot away from being lebron James
How can anyone defend this clown 😂
U gotta love Ben simmons
Ben Simmons is the perfect example of doing what you feel instead of doing what expected 💯💯💯
Love Ben man, glad he’s doing better
Thank you for this, finally Ben gets to speak out and knowing everything know all the Philly fans should feel other ways and everyone who just blamed him for that one play not knowing what he was going through.
thank you jj. A man of the people
honestly glad i heard this. much needed perspective on the Simmons issue
It was Trae Young and Hawks that was a better team cause when got a better coach💯 Trae was amazing that whole playoffs run🥶🥶🥶🔥💯
Subtitles in Spanish please i am a Spanish fan
excited for this episode! y’all gotta get harden or ibaka on this podcast one day
6:28 You was just what 🫣😂😂
I've only been to one NBA game in my life. Was stateside for a few days and saw Lebron was in Philly. I had to do it. Paid 1000$ for 2 tickets and drove 10 hours to get there. It was the game JJ said he remembered most from the winstreak. Lebron missed a free throw to send it to OT. Ben and Bron and triple doubles. Absolutely insane. Bron had a dunk on Ilyasova that is on his all-time reel.
Stephan A Smith owes Ben Simmons 500 apologies on National Television, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TicTok and wherever else he spit his bs and hateful rhetoric about this man!
Sonned Shaq without disrespecting him
Ben came through more likable in this interview. But to be a perimeter player of which opposite players would just sag off is not nit picking. There is no real evidence that the dude is trying to improve himself. He is just playing through areas of basketball in which he is comfortable. Not even trying to shoot from time to time is really making opposing defense job much easier.
That was awesome it was good to hear Ben's side God bless him and much success to him. Wish he was on my team. BLAZEERS if it does not work out for the Nets
Great interview, Ben having no idea what a smaller guy like Trae Young weighs was honestly hilarious to me
Jj not gonna say how lebron missed the clutch free throws to lose game  vs cavs
Ben cry baby Simmons please don't waste your time JJ HE IS A LAME!!!!
Honestly just showed me how lame he still is
anyone know what kind of wine they are drinking
This completely changed my perception of Ben Simmons. Thank you JJ!
17:40.   Ayeeeee yoooooo
see 24:00 JJ confirmed that Simmons has actually been constantly working on his shooting. but then "experts" all over the internet just keep saying "simmons not practice shooting OMG not mamba mentality". people need to understand we all have different learning rates. you could study physics 24/7 for straight 5years but youd never be suddenly as smart as einstein after that 5-year period. Is Simmons a bad shooter? Yes. Is it for lack of effort? NO.
Joel is def the reason why kawhi even got that shot off
I wonder what kinda deals went down behind the scenes with Ben’s agent. Just felt a little more censored than I would have liked. Not really askin the big interview questions that we want to hear. 😢
This was definitely my favorite episode so far, Ben is hilarious and seems to have a very good grip on reality and who he is. I’m glad he’s finding the light at the end of the tunnel and hoping for nothing but the best for him in Brooklyn!
Ben saying "good days" or "good times" every-time they reminisce on a moment shows how much he misses being on the court, bro cool asf too
Knew this would be a good one
Imeh Udoka next.... Lol
Love this. Gotta get your mind right first always 💪🏻🚀
His level of comfort took me by surprise. His words & body language seem to resemble peace.
mad respect for 25/10 🙌🏼 Shoot / don’t shoot doesn’t matter #legendsinthemaking
Gets to the shooting part, takes a swig, good on you Ben 💪
What’s this other dude do?
Great interview and mental health need to always be taken seriously no matter who you are. However, Ben Simmons is also lying about some known facts (like being caught using phones in practice) while smirking a lot talking about his supposedly serious mental issue that prevented him from even working out with his teammates. I have never seen a happier person talking about their most recent crippling depression
I bet it's a bunch of poor been comments In this bishhh 🙄🙄🤦🏿‍♂️
This was a great interview.  As a Sixers fan I was disappointed in how everything went down and how it appeared Ben handled things.  However, hearing his story and the various things he was dealing with, I wish him well and hope people think more about what people may be dealing with before reacting.
Que lindo verlo sonreir, ojala este año vuelva a su mejor nivel.
Glad to see you guys back, especially with Ben
i still love u ben ❤ thank u jj for allowing the real story to be shared
Great to see Ben happy and in good spirits.  Thank you JJ and team for providing him a forum to speak freely and get the real story out there.  All the best to him this season.  Hope he crushes it.
Ben Simmons obviously had inner demons he was dealing with and he really trust and respect JJ…Respect
We miss Ben
This guy is so misunderstood
This interview was enlightening for me. I kinda want to root for him this season instead of getting a good chuckle from the jokes about him
Ben's alright
That boy was a bucket at u18 nationals for Vic Metro 😂
This dude comes off so arrogant and extremely unlikeable.
Whats the sunglasses all about? Also Mr Simmons should be very thankful for JJ to trying to redeem his image in the public.
Philly would won a ring if Jimmy would of came back Jimmy that guy
Cool to see Ben in a different light other than what has been shown during the drama. Hope he proves the haters wrong.
This gone hit a million 💯
Then why allow your reps to come out and say anything about you playing for the nets in the playoffs just come out and say I can’t play instead of giving fans hope that your gonna be able to play fyi this isn’t me trying to attack BEN I’m a big fan but this is nyc and I know how our fans are
did i miss it or JJ forgot to ask him if he's gonna be able to play when this season starts??!
Top NBA players that in there prime 1 Ben Simmons 2 Joel embiid 3 Anthony Davis 4 Klay Thompson 5 DeAndre ayton 💯💯💯
Who is this?? I remember his name, but the face I don't recognize.. His a basketball player?
Great interview!
Tale away from this is JJ is a super high quality guy.  I've always been a fan.  He absolutely gets Philly and that says a lot.  Ben was as relaxed as I've ever seen.  He is not a bad guy but, a spoiled, out of touch guy.  Would you do anything different?  No.  That pretty much says it all- be humble even if bs.  He couldn't even do that.
a lot of deflecting lol i think ben does good this year tho they won’t win the chip but 2nd rd exit at the best
Ok. So what's the timestamp for the questions people actually wanna hear?
Basketball season right arounf the corner boys !
This is a great episode!! only complaint ben’s left side of mustache doesnt go down to his beard like the right side ocd kicking in
People are human. We all don’t do things perfectly. Very easy to get on social media and critique without going to the experience. Would like to see more commitment and fire from him hopefully this year.
Ben is a monster. This year he is going to destroy the entire league (except Giannis).
If he be aggressive and just try to score he will be the next lbj because he Is pass first player like lbj   If been just attempt shot's this man going to be unstoppable I'm telling yaaaaaaaaa I think kd them going to make him shoot
I’ve always felt like Ben Simmons would thrive in the Warriors system. He can play the 4 & do what Draymond does.
Sounds like he has that mindset now (even mentioning LeBron getting to a space if he wants to) that the fans in Philly always knew he could reach one day. He had to go through all this to get there and sadly it couldn’t happen in Philly, but as a Sixers fan, I respect Ben and I hope he reaches his potential. I think even as abrasive and rude as Sixers fans might be that’s all they really ever wanted for him
so good
Honestly this really humanized Ben Simmons and made me feel bad for him. JJ what a good podcast
5:22
Feels like they edited out some good parts
I was feeling everything he said until he said that he didn't have a phone in his pocket and that it was actually his jersey?! #FOH
Ben Simmons is a unique player he's sensitive and  timid but he has a confident fierce about him that makes you wonder i think he's still trying to figure out who he is 💯
It's nice to see Ben talk about all of this in the context of a normal conversation instead of watching these drama infused reporting that traditional media and some fans create. It lets us see that he's just a human being trying to do what he feels is right for him.
I’m glad that it seems like Ben is doing better. Hope he can play this year and move on with his life and career.
getting on the floor was his priority, yet he didnt play a single game...
I dont wanna be that guy since all the comments are so nice and all but all imma say is I’ll believe it when i see it. This it how it goes every year
Wow. Ben took no responsibility for everything he did wrong
i’m a huge fan of ben, hope he exceeds expectations this year and comes back even better than before!
Millenials!!!  Ben Simmons is a privileged ungrateful brat!  He's had a hard life!!  Laughable.
maybe doc and embiid said it was ben simmons fault, because he played absolute trash and did not do what was expected of him
must be tough being a millionaire and having to play a kids game where some other kids will talk smack to you. omg it must of been so hard. gtfho
Great interview
Move KD to Small F
Since you deleted the video where I first posted this… someone needs to educate Simmons on ‘Emotional Bypassing’. He’s saying a lot of the right things in response to a mental health crisis, but it should be obvious he hasn’t got to the root of what’s got him down. He needs the right people around him; I imagine a lot of folks in his circle either look up to him, or depend on him in some way, and people who have a stake in one’s career can’t always be trusted to do or say what’s truly best for that person. I wish him well.
What’s with the sunglasses JJ??!😂😂😂
Nice to hear his perspective, but man he doesn't seem to have a competitive bone in his body. Hope is healthy moving forward, but I don't see how he's going to survive the inevitable future adversity that comes with an NBA season and the expectations of contending for a championship.
From someone who is dealing with L4 / L5 back pain for last 6 months I totally understand why Ben couldn't play.  Damn, it's hard to sleep with pain much less walk or run
JJ I'm a Tarheel but I really love the person you are man.
It's nice to finally get Ben's genuine side of that whole situation. Hope things pan out for him in Brooklyn.
Love your channel jj but you don't need this scrub on here
I went from hating Ben to respecting him alot. The power of podcasts is real
He aint injured to go to this interview huh?😂 tell that 6’10 max prestige lightskin get on the court and get a ring
Rooting for this dude. So excited for his contributions to Nets Basketball!
Ben trying to steer the story to make it seem like people in Philly are delusional. It wasn’t the one shot he didn’t take, it’s the fact that he didn’t shoot in four straight 4th quarters, culminating in the dunk he didn’t take. That was the icing on the cake. Anyway, great interview, kinda wished JJ would’ve touched on his relationship with Joel but it is what it is.
JJ is the GOAT for creating a safe space for players to come and really tell their story
I really can't believe ben simmons actually agreed to doing something like this. He regains some of my respect
This interview was insightful and love how JJ adds a personal touch to the interview. “Long” you were the first pick in the draft. “If you cared about academics why did you pick LSU’”. As a Raptors fan I’m so glad that shot went in 🙏🏼 #wethenorth
Best POD out. Don’t leave us again.
Have it or you dont
nah the westbrook video was objectively funny
Your built with court vision
I got a clearer understanding of this dude and feel where he is coming from. Seems like a good man and any person who struggled with mental health can relate.
damn ben is turning me on
mans so self centered
This episode lives up to the hype. Amazing
subscribed for a year now, this interview convinced me to unsubscribe, other interviews where usually decent, but yeah, no longer wanna listen to this bs
Really rooting for Ben. He is an unbelievable player, he will thrive playing the 4 n 5 this season with the shooters Brooklyn has. He seems like an awesome dude.
HE SAID I WISH WE HAD YOU MY ROOKIE YEAR NOT A ROOKIE CONFIRMED
“YOOOOO ITS RUSSELL WESTBROOK BRO”🤣🤣🤣so funny
Simmons is going to have a field day with Seth curry and Joe Harris l
always been a big fan of ben, rooting for his success
A lovely interview!
you have to score more to win, so scoring is 1st in priority and stoppin them from scoring is 2nd, gotta get ur priorities straight
This interview would've been a 10 if they directly addressed Joel Embiid. He(their relationship)  is the elephant in the room and It was avoided or edited out. Other than that, pretty decent watch. We didn't learn anything new, but it's good to see Ben is in good spirits. Philly in 5.
Wish he would have asked him about Embiid
Is this the dagger? 😏
"I'm a winner, I want to win" says the guy who gives up on his team because he was criticized for his apparently over-looked basketball IQ.
every other sentence coming out of ben simmons mouth is him praising himself
love to hear bens side of that play against the hawks, respect 💪🏼 admitting it looks bad and he messed up but it is what it is just a mistake was made
jj has jokes
Screw this jerk off. Poor poor Ben Simmons.  F him.  Sits the bench and gets paid millions.  Oh its my mental health, oh people didnt support me  Whine somewhere else moron. Christ these athletes are nothin but prima donas
wow i listened to that whole fuckin thing.  as a sixers fan i feel like someone missing their ex now
Man that shot at the Pacers hurt me 😂
To me, Ben comes off as someone who is past it all but is also aware of the things that happened and how it affected himself, and everyone around him. Outstanding level of maturity and some new found confidence. Really rooting for the dude. Can't wait to watch him punch it home in a Nets uniform and work for the Larry O' B.
46:53 back injury
Taking care of one's mental health is equally important as one's physical health. Kudos to Ben for taking action and speaking out about it. Everyone in the world would benefit from making that a priority in their lives. I hope he has a great come back year playing alongside KD and Kyrie.
Ben Simmons said in da video he wanna win I can't tell he did nothing for the Nets he didn't play in 1 single game.
Philly fans are terrible! I wouldn’t want to play there either! They’ll turn on Embiid soon just wait on it!
1:06:15  Right here is where I see that he's actively working through things. I relate to this hardcore because while it's not a perfect answer, it's an honest one and it shows that effort is being made to focus on making himself right. Props to Ben Simmons for showing his genuine side during the long journey of becoming the best version of himself.  Also damn props to JJ for making such a safe space. You can see Ben open up throughout the chat. It was incredible.
bounce back gonna be fire MIP otw
Nets in 5
Great podcast
Jj Redick is ELITE. He got to the bottom of it without aggressively prying. Salute to good humans beings. Real is rare. Loved this episode jj.
Definitely gained some respect
1:09:22 facts 27 for huerter wtf
Redick wild for putting the best interview out first. Thanks king.
My god I can't believe how many people are willing to co-sign anything they hear whether there is more evidence to the contrary and no evidence to support whatever story you co-sign
After watching this interview…I can see Ben has ZERO accountability. I totally understand the mental health issues but he is way too nonchalant about his lack of development..and it shows in his lack of production.
After watching this I respect Ben more. As a Philly fan I will forever be annoyed with how he handled leaving. Especially after having had his back since he got in the league, I wore no. 25 bc he was my favorite player and then he basically gave the finger to the city. How things went down between him and management is different and we’ll never know the story but he owed the fans more respect. Pretty much like Carson Wentz. Philly is a tough city to play in but it’s also simple. Work hard and respect the city
Still quit on the city. A city that wanted the best for him.
I feel when JJ and Ben are talking about back issues. I too have the degenerative disc disease and had surgery on my L4-L5 disc where I missed my whole senior year of basketball and I still have problems to this day 5 years later
People forget he's human
Best pod yet JJ! First one I listened to all the way through. Glad to see Ben doing well. A good reminder that we don’t know the whole story or what people go through.
I want ben to do well no hate
I love how Been is excited to play in BROOKLYN 🙂
respect for ben simmons💯
Been told yall Ben wasn't the problem sixers still couldn't make it out the second rd and only one person been on team the entire process
LOOKS LIKE JJ'S BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
I'm sorry JJ. I was scream tweeting at you for not posting anything in a while because I was stuck with traditional sports talk garbage. Only for you to come back with this great interview. I'm ashamed of myself. Please forgive me. 🌹
Hey dumbass.You disappeared COMPLETELEY in the Hawk Series.Not just one play.The whole SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ben is still my favorite player
He seems so chill and down to earth. I truly hope he conquers his shooting demons.  I’m pulling for bro!
More like the old man and the lay up 😂
Ben seems like such a chill dude, I really hope that he has a great year next *year
He’s still a bum who can’t shoot
My god this is going to be gold
I feel so bad for saying this because I love Ben, but I feel like he says so much, yet so little. Some of his answers are so superficial
Way to ask no questions about embiid
Wasn’t Ben a DPOY candidate ?
I listen to Wondery + every morning on my bike so look forward to access there!
50:00 man i feel bad for ben, he always gets slandered and you can see he appreciates this compliment
Love this episode we got to see the other side of Ben and I like that he want peace and happiness
He said “it was my jersey in my pocket not a phone” but when he walks away you see the light from the phone screen…
Thanks JJ! Appreciate you Ben for coming on the show.
JJ rubbed Simmons balls the whole interview. Biased much?
JJ gonna get kawhi on here, watch
PHL vs BKN. Official!
"Lebron brought them back to 1 point "
Listen, I love Ben. I wanted him to pull through and stay with us forever in Philly. We supported him through his shooting struggles his whole career. When everyone in the NBA didn’t show him respect we stood up for him. And I really don’t think it’s fair that a frustrated Team and team leader (Joel) aren’t allowed to show displeasure with your quality of play, lack of shooting and how he handled The Who situation. We have all been deflated where no words come out so the whole thing is a tough situation.
If he can shoot next season. Sheesh, all I'm looking for from ben is to be his former defensive self and to be aggressive on his cuts.
All respect to Big Ben n I'm a Philly/Jersey dude. You show maturity and I wish you much success in your career. Just not against the Sixers, but continue to be you, bro!
Great interview. Makes me want to see Ben bounce back to his best level next year.
We need to have Russ on a podcast a similar situation to Ben Simmons where they both bring a ton to the table but are over scrutinized over the one aspect they don’t do as Elite as the other parts of their game
Great interview
Just having Ben talk from his perspective makes everything so much less...dramatic than a lot of the sports media segments have made it out to be...his mental feels very strong presently now as he expressed. Good for him.
Respect to ben for this
This best ball podcast by a mile. “ keep that in there” JJ on pacers had me rolling 😂
Ben is the reason why I decided to start doing sports mental health therapy
They back and with a banger too
8:20 Ben finally took some shots
That Pacers comment cut deep..
1:09:21  If Ben claims he was guarding the best player on the team & that player drops 27 pts does that mean he did a good job guarding that player🤔
dude if you dont even know how to do a layup you cant claim you have baskeetball iq
Great interview! Honestly he got unlucky to get in a team where the main star is a center. See Draymond, no one talks much about his lack of shooting or would even think of kicking him out of GSW because he’s always played with Steph and Klay. Hope for him it changes with Nets. It surely will of everyone plays.
Bennnnn YOU SHOULD OF BEEN SAID SOMETHING!!!!! NOOOOOO!!! WE WOULD OF LET YOU SLIDE ON THAT BACK INJURY 🤦‍♂️ SMH WHY SAY IT NOW. COME BACK TO PHILLY 😩😂👀
Shaq is not hating on you bro, he is old school and is trying to light a fire under you.
Red Velvet lit up that Sixers team lol
As 76ers fan I wish him the best and hopefully he becomes the player we all know he could be
Rooting for Ben.  I hope he comes back real strong with the Nets. He’s underrated. Great interview.
Respect
I like him.
Jesus Christ why are you Cuddling him so much. Ask real questions man.
don't let this distract you he used mental illness to get out of playing ....
Making mad excuses.
Nets  win in 7 !
It comes down to genuinely knowing who you are. Not trying to sweep things under the rug and cover it
Pulling for Ben, great episode!
I really hope this doesn’t make me like him
Haven’t heard from JJ since The Logo owned him
This ain’t giving us the answers we want. JJ talking to him as a friend not as an interviewer trying to get all the answers
Lets just see how he acts on that court
Oh No! He sounds rational and ready to compete. Hopefully Kyrie and KD will continue the drama and weaken the team's talent . GSW 2023 CHAMPS!
Come on Ben, backing you on having a BIG comeback season
Did Ben Simmons just end the interview saying he’s more athletic than Lebron 💀he is rn but it’s hilarious how he slipped that in there
Simmons is a real one 💯 can't wait to see him back on the court...
It's a good thing that he finally spoke up. We might still doubt some of his answers but he sounded candid and sincere.
"To me that's basketball" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bro, you were the problem, not Joel. That doesn't change no matter what you insinuate.
I’m a Sixers fan but I’m rooting for Ben!
Nets are my favorites
I definitely wanna apologize cuz I didn’t know Ben went through that. Keep pushing for real and I’m excited to see you get on the court
Didn't know he had this personality.
What I wished JJ would've questioned Ben on is his lack of development in his game. We've all known Ben's weakness since the 2018 playoffs against the Celtics. He still has not figured it out. That part Ben is not taking accountability for.
JJ, get back on First Take!
Huh…came out of this a big fan. Best to Ben
Get it all out Ben. We hear you we understand. Now please get healthy and play. Do that and people will stop hating
When your in a flow state passing is easy cause everything slows down or your processing speeds up
Sensational stuff.
well well well...
This gave me a new perspective on Ben he truly is the softest human ever🤡
Simmons is the ultimate non-factor.
Big baby
Bennnn
Ben Simmons is still my fave player
Great job JJ and as person that is not a fan of Ben Simmons, im glad I got to hear his side of the story and am now more understanding, hope the best for him in the future.
Shoutout to Simmons for keeping it real also calling out Chuck & Shaq
So we supposed to believe this isn’t scripted when everybody is avoiding talking about Joel beyond a brief mention?
That Philly team was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He could’ve easily come out and said why he wasn’t coming back, a year ago. This is all bs to me.
I bet you the league will file a suit for Ben and JJ since he admitted tampering 😂😂😂
man this brings me back. what could have been…  good to see Ben in good spirits, rooting for him in BKN.
Honestly the sixers fan in me wants him to crash in burn so bad in BK.  But the basketball fan wants me to see him be great.  He just still seems like he says the right things but I dont think he really cares about bball enough to figure out what he needs to do.
26:30 oh brother
elite healthy Simmons idc if he can score that defense iq rebounding passing is insane with a Kyrie and Durant but health is a issue for all of them
1:09:27 Seth Curry caught a stray 😭
It is really sad to see Ben leaving a toxic work environment to join another toxic environment (Nets is not the best situation for him) 😢 hope everything works out for him.
This interview was much needed I just glad NBA players have podcast because he never would have went to media for this
One of the least likeable athletes in history. Really hope his career is over. A total fraud.
Look man, all Philly fans wanted deep down was Ben Simmons to succeed, he says he was confused on if he should’ve shot or if we wanted him to shoot but we made it clear we wanted him to shoot, said he couldn’t shoot because he wouldn’t shoot, at first I wanted him to not succeed wherever he goes but I would like to see him succeed, it’s nice seeing his side for once, I don’t think it’s a Ben was in the wrong or 76ers were in the wrong, I think both sides had mistakes that lead to the fallout, mental health is real, love Philly but the way our fan base is wasn’t what Simmons needed to succeed, Gerald Houston calling him Westbrook was funny asf tho 😂🤣
It’s not about the money? The money doesn’t matter? Bro you don’t have to keep on playing? Obviously it’s doesn’t make you happy. Retire do something else that makes you happy. Playing professional sports comes with a sacrifice. Any high paying position where you work for someone comes with some sacrifice. But….no one is forcing you to do it. It’s your choice ultimately.
JJ's interviews/conversations are natural and his questions are genuine. He doesn't push any agenda and allows the person interviewed plenty of time to answer without pressure. He also asks really intelligent savy questions👌🏾
the absolute opposite of First Take b .s. TKS
Hope he balls out this season
I’ve never heard him speak before, that was NOT the voice I imagined he’d have!?!? Ben has such a great radio voice!
“Get off my case” we all know what word he wanted to say 😂😂😂😂🍆
Just goes to show that never trust what you see in the media. Same goes what's been said about Kyrie etc.
John wall would be a great episode
W Ben
Before watching this I was indifferent about BS.   Now, I’m hoping he can bounce back and have a year this year.
The NBA in trouble my guy “Ben 10”
DAMN - I loved this interview.  Thanks for giving Ben a platform, I think this was a long time coming.  HE needed that.  Looking forward to seeing BK again. - a Celtic
JJ is such an incredible interviewer and I think it boils down to empathy… he cares about the players that he interviews…
Bro who’s the camera guy
It’s cool to see how much energy and joy Ben Simmons has when he’s around people that care for him
1:00:05 well that’s a lie because you tried to get money back
JJ the GOAT bro.
Well, if you think you had problems in Philly, just wait for the dysfunction in Brooklyn.
I'm happy for him. I wish him the best with Brooklyn. He deserve it!
Tommy Alter, the nepo baby
This is why shows like this are so important for athletes today. My perspective on Ben has completely changed all because of context and hearing the words come from his mouth. Media and Twitter will twist anything for clicks.
this dude just doesn't have it. You can see when someone has it
Great to have you guys back!  Interesting to finally hear Ben’s side of things.  Looking forward to a awesome season of pods!
Best episode to date.
Amazing interview, 10/10, JJ you are a great host, to talk about those difficult issues in the way you did, with Ben being comfortable to talk, great job. I think your best interview to this day. Congrats!
Tobi objectively had a worse overall series against the Hawks than Ben did, and it wasn't even that close.    Ben was just put on a poster a few times.
ben def needed to do this for his rep  but nah ben u needed to dunk that. shame
Can’t wait for Ben to shut up all his haters this next season!!! Including my friends! Once Bron retires he will be my favorite player!
Ben Simmons Cold. Hope he comes back strong and Mentally Healthy!!! Brooklyn a problem if he plays.
Narcissists and sociopaths are experts at charming us and spinning the narrative to fit their precieved victimhood. Judging by the comments most everyone falls for it.
I love the interview up until the 59/60 min mark j.j Reddick was not impartial he made an error and was called out and you call it throwing him under the bus bro that's accountability
Always amazed at how players are way more likeable after doing JJ's podcast. I never thought I would say this, but I hope Simmons has a great comeback year.
Ben, we all know that wasn't a jersey in your pocket bruh.... We aren't stupid and you came back so you wouldn't get fined. Right after you said you don't care about money (great setup by JJ). Over all great interview and he seems like a good dude. That's taking a ton of heat and handling it pretty well.
I played against Ben and Dante at the Nations. I was already impressed bruv was huge and he was shooting stepback 3s. Nice seeing him closer to be at peace.
1:14:48 found dat play🤞🏾  https://youtu.be/FVeXVkyGrms
man, this is some public relations bullsh&t. I don't believe this guy at all.
Good luck Ben
He said Trey is 200 lbs 😄😄😄
Welcome back JJ and team. Well done as usual. Big fan.
You’re d’ing Luka all night. Did he really have to word it that way
W
21:47 *"There is just not a perfect player"* Well JJ, I guess you've never heard of a guy named Larry Bird. You cannot point one single weakness in a guy like Larry..  Not one! Some people say his defense was his only weakness,  well go look at some stats and then come back with what you find.  I can't even say Jordan because Jordan was just a below average 3 point shooter, but Bird?..... Not one weakness and I'll challenge anyone on this.
Total waste of time. For the love of christ, ask the real questions. Why does a professional basketball player feel like he is above learning how to shoot a basketball? This nonsensical narrative that all anyone cares about is the passed up dunk is ridiculous. It's the arrogance that he thinks he doesnt need a shot.
When are you doing a live podcast in Philly?
good job jj
I’ve been super critical of Simmons like everyone else. That said, it was good to see him in good spirits. I’m a LeBron fan, but the Nets storyline has me rooting for them now….AFTER the Lakers though! Lol
"no ones guarding Kevin or Kai" . Marcus Smart and Grant Williams beg to differ Ben.
I respect Ben. He admitted “obviously I didn’t handle things the right way, but the team didn’t either”. Admitting fault is huge. I’m rooting for bro. Great interview JJ!!!!!
Extremely excited to see this team play, could be absolutely amazing or a complete shitshow. Hopefully the former.
Can’t lie even tho he was victimizing himself and as a Philly fan I have a new respect for 25
Philly was probably the best place you could’ve ever placed Ben. If you can go through the ringer that is Philly and come out a better person, you can deal with any fanbase.
Anyone got a time stamp when they talked about his shooting?
He seems like such a genuine dude. I'm rootin for him
I’ve never heard Ben Simmons talk before…
“Got thrown under the bus in game 7”  The dude literally scored 1 point or less in the 4th Qt of games 3-7! He was absolutely horrible when he was needed most. Miss me with that “I got thrown under the bus” narrative. Dude has no desire to win. Simmo is no Savage
Great interview brother🔥
hearing Ben touch on everything has clarified so much and he seems to be in a good place right now, I'm rooting for you man!
Y’all got ben simmons on a podcast that’s HUGE
The interview starts at 5:22
Cool spot... where did you record this?
do you think you could get gregg poppovich on here?
Yo looking back. That 100% is a jersey not a cell phone haha I kinda feel dumb bc I thought it was too
Great interview
I never wish anyone death, but i wish him no success in life
Ben Simmons need to shut the f******  up and go somewhere and hide  he needs to be embarrassed the way he performed his last 5 years in the NBA hes a  Max player who never lived up to his potential , play scared  ,  He passed up that dunk because he was afraid to go to the free throw line because he stunk at it,  Yes everybody wants to analyze your plaey because you don't shoot a open jump shot that's part of your craft to shoot a jump shot that is part of being a elite NBA player like u think u r and getting paid like,  Stop blaming everyone else for your failure step up  To the challenge and handle your business you're already a rich man so you don't care what the fans think  you're set for life and this is my last time even thinking about your punk a**
Your gonna see Philly on steroids....
I actually like Ben Simmons now
I really wish the media would be cool and positive with all the players the way you do JJ.   Hopefully they follow your lead
This vid made me gain so much respect for Ben Simmons. Goodluck this season
JJ you shouldve asked about his relationship with Joel, cmon now
N O   O N E   C A R E S   A B O U T    B E N  A N Y M O R E!
He is still deflecting here and how many times can he bring up him guarding other teams best players and his basketball IQ. He did not guard trae young exclusively in that series. Plus, they ran pick and rolls every play. Guy is a narcissist.
Ben, you're right handed. You had been holding the mic right hand the whole time. That could fix your freethrow woes(more than the 3 point shot) & hack-a-Ben.
"It's not about the money" that's a lie considering he's suing philly for the money he was fined
JJ was the first and only person to get Ben out of his shell. Thanks JJ. Salute.
Great Show guys !!!
Clearly he doesn’t like Embiid
Great interview...glad to have Ben on my team! 👍🏾
Here we go!!!!! Dying for this episode, hahahaha.
The wine bottle branding bait is genius! BRAVO
Ben is looking good
Clearly most people in here have never worked in behavioral health before; Ben didn't explain anything lol. Just a bunch of fluff that apparently is being eaten up by simps. Oh well, we'll see how he fails his team again next season
He should’ve been did this, he’s a really cool dude it’s easy to not like him based off basketball related stuff but kodos to him
Love this man. These guys are more than just athletes. They are human just like the rest of us.
Gerald Houston trolls everybody like that. You’re not the first one Ben. That’s what he does.
The couch warriors forgot how good Ben is on court because the he was apart of a TEAM that folded against ATL ( wasn’t just him ) and the off court 💩 but Ben in BKN is a good fit
Great!!
Watch Ben Simmons this season wins finals MVP. And is considered better than KD
2:56 Ayooooooooo. Pause bruh 😂
This was awesome
Phenomenal interview 👏🏾
Sounds like Ben Simmons will fit in perfectly on Warriors roster. But I wonder the synergy that would create with Draymond on the court.
Let's go! Welcome back 🙏
Monster season loading ……
This was an amazing interview. Well done fellas. And best of luck to Ben 🤙
Happy for him he’s gonna be successful
Ben is so chill man classic ep 🤘🏽
A lot of people here are close minded but me personally, I want him to get a big comeback. He also fits very well in BKN.
Shoutout to Ben simmons
A+ as usual JJ and Tommy. This conversation lived up to the anticipation. This show was missed during the offseason! Can't wait to see Simmons back on the court!
JJ was deffo stoned 😂
Ben Simmons is a fanoik
Donovan is the same age as Ben anyway lol
ben is a cool dude, he gets too much hate
The fact that JJ even was able to get Ben on his podcast just proves how good JJ is at this
Legendary interview JJ!
Love it....Ben Simmons is awesome
6:43 how coincidental that Ben's Australian accent came out a bit on that "properly" as he was describing how his accent comes out when he's trying to articulate something
This was awesome
Love Ben Simmons. Dudes a human like all of us. I’m rooting for you always. Great pod
I can't blame Ben for the Atlanta series. Who tf let Kevin drop 27 points. Doc should've made adjustments. Plus Embiid wasn't healthy.
Paaaauuuusse. “Your d’ing Luka up all night” “your gonna have to d him up all night” 😮😮😂😂 I’m childish lol
Just wanted to pop by and say thanks for watching. This is one of the best conversations we've had on the pod and we're thrilled to be able to share it with everyone. We've got some great guests coming on soon so be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already. Thanks again for watching.
Feels good just to see Ben smile wish all the best for him
Man I miss watching Simmons and JJ on my Sixers
Ben Simmons said he just wanted to tailgate college football, party, then get to the league 😂
Benita Simmons cant play basketball he is on is period its really sad
We IN PHILLY have been waiting for this 👀
Philly had butler embiid simmons reddick...crazy team and did not won it...just imagine how hard it is to actually win a title...
I am pulling for you Ben. So glad you were able tell your side of the story. Great interview!
I will miss Ben in Philly he really did a lot for the team…I didn’t care he wasn’t a scorer I just wanted to see the attempt. And if he wasn’t going to take the attempts then at least attack the rim more because of his height because Joel has had tendencies where he would get comfortable with his shot. As you watch Giannis grow I wanted the same for Ben because I thought he could have been the next face of the league
Interview of the year! JJ and Tommy, y’all are cold! 🙌🏾
I was not ready for the undies ad
What if the coach is Ime 😂😂😂
I haven’t listened to it yet here’s my prediction , Ben takes no accountability.
No time stamps? 😭😭😭
Putting in perspective how much Ben takes on night in n night out, along with other contributing factors, I can somewhat see how he probably mentally broke down. Guy seemed to have had alot on his plate..Just my opinion n observation
I still love Ben the guy and the player but it’s still F U for that philly stunt
No disrespect but the pacers have had more success then sixers have the past decade. As good as Philly been they haven’t been out of the second round for numerous reasons. Those early pacers team, the heat were the only team that stopped them from playing in numerous nba finals. Their best team in 2013 were better then any sixers team this past decade.
20:30, 25:00, 28:30, 42:00, 51:35, 1:13:25
naw, them LSU white girls were GREAT!
Ben Simmons as a philly fan is like that girl you really like and thought you had a future with leaving you for the cooler guy… it’s like you know this guy cooler than you but hating cuz it ain’t you…. So yeah 😏
W
I want a whole Ben Simmons documentary with all the truths revealed; names/ dates/ places/ stats/ calls - we need to know how or why entities get away with destroying legacies and they go home sleep in bed w/ no worries of their negative impact.
Absolutely zero personal accountability. I blame Doc and Embiid as well. But Ben played a HUGE part of this.
Can ya'll get Russ on the podcast? Would LOVE to hear his unadulterated view on his situation along with your perspective. I think if there's anyone he'll talk to without feeling constatntly attacked, it JJ.
Hats off to JJ for having a platform that gives Ben space to reveal how he sees and plays the game authentically
Softball interview between friends. JJ's podcasts are cool if you want an insight to players (I do not care, put the ball in the hole better), but not great if you want players like Ben to face the hard questions
Watch JJ pull welfare queen Brett Farve on Monday's episode
Ben high asab😭 ain’t no way his eyes is red and he hasn’t cried or anything and he cheesing 🤣
Interview starts at 5:20
Dunking the ball on trae would’ve also helped u win
Ben still went out like a scrub in philly so it’s still F Ben Simmons but I’ll be routing for him quietly cuz I actually do like this man🙄
I think defense is fun too
Radiates fake confidence
That Pacers comment hurt JJ 😭😭😭
That's wine not truth serum.
You are not part of Philly. GTFO.
Woke up and clicked on this so fast
I never posted anything about Ben Simmons but I hate I ever even had a bad thought about basketball player I fw. makes me realize I shouldn't be influenced by the talking heads. glad you came out with this bro. glad your a black man speaking about talking and mentalhealth. publicly rooting for bro. a real knicks fan here hoping you turn up bro.
Ben 10 getting a ring next year
Ben never explained anything. Dude is just a celebrity i value his money game. Hes made the nba pay him.
JJ 💯
W
Great podcast!!Still waiting on the episode with Bron
“I’m a winner I wanna win” literally doesn’t play after a new contract, bails on his teammates, goes to BKN and still doesn’t play, cleared to play for playoffs, leaves Nets player group chat when asked if he’s playing in playoffs. Softest pro athlete of all time.
The Klutch bots are out and posting today!
Nah JJ really goated for his NBA relationships. Like bro gets anyone to talk about anything 😂
I can’t wait to see Ben and Brooklyn man. ECF vs Milwaukee
Ben still has hall of fame potencial
Its great JJ gives guys who are perceived a certain way in the press the opportunity to be themselves. The dialogue surrounding Ben has only been one sided. Shows like this are needed to give the other and real side.   New Media is needed and this interview is prime example as to why
best podcast hands down!  You know what i'm subscribing right now! Let's go champ!
This interview didn’t move the needle for me on Ben. A few questions though:  Why do you guys have corded mics in 2022? Why isn’t this channel at a million subscribers?
I just wanna know if he’s gonna play this season 😩
I think this was good for Ben's mental health.
Everyone needs a JJ R to interview them
I think if Ben Simmons averages 16-8-8 that’s good why don’t we judge players like bam adebayo and Julius randle and draymond for not being better offensive players? Especially Julius Randle he’s also a poor at defender at the foward position and can very efficient on offense. Yet y’all stay disrespecting Simmons. Ik this is only one aspect of what happened but still.
What a clown 😂😂😂😂😂😂
yessir certified banger
I still think trading for Jimmy ruined that team
Money doesn't matter but you sure as hell didn't give it up. JJ, that was soft AF. Ask the tough questions, FFS.
great interview, and glad to hear Ben seems to be in a god space. Have been a fan of his throughout the whole NBA career, and hope he has a great/healthy year
need that cap tommy!
Yeah I ain’t trying to hear this BS I’m out.
Soft
Ben trynna get his stock up. I'm 15 minutes in and they all can't stop fluffing the dude.  Omg this dude's dumb. He's talking about how nobody wanted to play in Philly? Bruh you were tanking why would free agents wanna go there? He talks like him being drafted somewhere that needed him and failing is ok because they aren't tanking anymore. He just sounds sooo dumb. Kyrie been rubbing off on him.
Thank you to all of you for shedding more light to this entire situation and bringing the attention that is DESERVED to the mental health discussion. You are truly changing things, it is incredible to see 🙏
The hard cut after “huerter had what, 27 pts?”
Great job guys. Looking forward to have Ben back on the court. Wish you all the best.
The long-awaited episode.
Wait a minute…. This is how he sounds ????????
Great interview, Ben seems like a great guy, hopefully him and the nets have a big season, would have been good to hear what his relationship with Joel, kd kyrie is like
What wine they drinking?
Rick Bucher is one of the worst NBA reporters of all time. The NBA world will only be a better place once he retires.
Raptor fan here, still got love for ya JJ LOL!
Philly - The Scam that is Doc Rivers ruined your franchise.
Just shoot bro lol that’s all we ask for. U don’t like getting buckets with that 6’10 frame? 😅
Who is this guy? He plays in the WNBA?
Been waiting on this!!!
I always thought the media was super harsh on Simmons. I’d feel the same as him if after a playoff loss the teams best player and coach both came out basically blaming me for everything and taking no responsibility themselves
Revenge season #netsworld
I don’t think I can get over how JJ says appreciate 😂
Wow! Nice scoop
F*ck dude!
Not to nerd out, but I’m digging these camera moves frfr 🤷🏾‍♂️😀
Get Joe Harris on 🙌🏻
Naawwwwww!  That was the cell phone in the pocket!  Lol!
this is crazy
Did jj ever respond to getting dunked on by jerry west
52:20 Gerald Huston does that to everyone lol
I’m so happy JJ did this interview. Asked the questions that we all wanted answered and, through that, showed the bias the media has had toward Ben for the past 2 years. Praying for a great season for Ben to prove the haters wrong
Forget Ben can guard 1-5 it’s gone make it easy on KD not having to b that dude to guard the best player on the other team
I for one have changed my tone about Ben, this interview was needed for him. Dude never responded to critics. Much respect for Ben.
No. Way.
Please reach out to Russ Next🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think this is the first time Ben was so open ! Good stuff !
JJ: "Is there anything you wish you handled differently while in Philly?" Ben: "No."  He's always been enabled to see himself as the victim and dodge responsibility, and this podcast is a continuation of that. Can't say I'm surprised.
If Ben is truly healthy mind and body BK should be scary this season. Let’s see what Nash does with it.
My son higher than a kite
Let's go Ben!  All the best man!
My only thing is how is he saying he doesn’t care about the money but is now with Brooklyn and still fighting philly for partial of the money they fined him for 😂
I need to do some checkups I’ve spent some good 30 minutes under the impression that those pans in the background were tanks
If no one has to guard Ben then it’s not 5 vs 5  lol he’s giving do much space for years. Try a pull up idk 🤷🏻‍♂️
Being in Brooklyn is different??? He hasn’t played a game yet
Damn this interview is going to be good😂💀💀
Sooo, he still can't make ft's
Ben just said "Good days"
This my favorite player, if he’s locked in the nets can be scary!!!!!!
Why are they in a kitchen?
I think Ben made a good point about how fast things go in the playoffs. You have to make quick and accurate decisionstmost of the time to win, but there are times u make the wrong play like him. Many people slander him for it but I doubt most of people have been in that situation, game 7 of a NBA playoff series. Anyone can just say if I was Ben I would've easily dunked it, but they'll probably never understand what it's like to actually do that. I'm not saying it's an excuse for him not dunking it, but it's just not right to slander him for one play while he's still young and can prove to be better
BS interview.... All us Sixers fans wanted you to do was shoot the ball, not make the shots, just shoot it.   And also dunk it when you were right there at the rim.
Is that the grange in the background? If so hope you enjoyed it
Why you gotta bring up the Pacers like that JJ 🤕
I hope he's able to start shooting from further away to expand his game and make it easier for him to attack the basket and find his teammates. This injury on the back could be troublesome in the future if he doesn't find a way to play forcing it as less as he can while producing.
Foh Ben
Trae young
Ben, great young man and definitely rooting for you. As a basketball fan and someone who’s never reached the elite levels of my profession, much respect. If I were a trusted advisor to you, I would tell you to come off the candy, stop the wine, and if you’re not already doing it, focus on a stretching regiment that will enhance and prolong your career. You’ll be JJ’s age sooner than you think…and you don’t want any regrets about what could’ve been.
I genuinely like Ben after this interview… he’s a good dude… gl brother!
You gotta admit.. JJ has the most interesting guests in the NBA. Far better content than anything on ESPN or Fox.
"that's" 1hr ad?
Bens winning dpoy this season calling it
Some of y’all corny asf this was a conversation.. y’all want JJ to straight up attack this man to fill whatever hole you have in your personal life.. grow tf up it’s a damn game at the end of the day 🤷🏽‍♂️you’re not gaining anything from watching besides entertainment
the random drive-by on my Pacers... hurtful, yet true
Such a great episode
As a Sixers fan, Ben Simmons is like the ex that you're obsessed with and you still stalk that ex like you miss her so much.
Simmons tough
This guy can’t play ball. He can’t play. His hands are too small.
Camera movement and angles were horrible
THE PEOPLE FROM PHILLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE KILLINGS AND THAT FENTY PROBLEM
This is gonna be good *grabs popcorn*
Bro seems happy as hell. Good to see
hope they’re working on getting kai and slim reaper soon this ep was dope💯
This dude doesnt deserve an hr of my time.  Does he take any personal accountability or does he continue to use "mental health" as an excuse
That’s hilarious 😂😂😂….  “Kevin’s wide open- nope!”  “Be careful what you wish for”  If you have the greatest shooters around you why take shots away from them? If their greatest asset is your weakness find the balance.
That dude does that to all the celebrities he meets he's just pranking them
Great listen. I had so many questions regarding Ben & his work ethic. And a lot of them were answered today. Like one commenter said, JJ does an amazing job humanizing players & giving them a platform to clear the air. I've made a video criticizing Simmons' actions and there's a lot of stuff I took from the media (since Rich Paul had spoken more on Ben's behalf than Ben himself). Thank you for giving him the space to address it all! I promise you this did way more good for the narratives surrounding Simmons than you think. Cheers!
Kyrie, Harris, KD, Simmons...sheeeeeshhhhh Simmons fills all of the Nets flaws
Dude is lazy and puts in no effort. His gpa was below 2 in college and he played softer than a pillow during games despite being a number one pick
This says basically don’t even bet on his points over or under on any Sportsbook 😭😭😭
Can you put time stamps please?
The rare sighting of the greatest 🤡 on 🌍
Great to hear from Ben Simmons himself and kudos to JJ for giving that safe space for Ben. Can't wait to see him bounce back
5 minute in….thank you!! Glad you’re back!! 🙌🏼🙏🏼
All I hear is the Rock
God even when he’s lying Ben comes off so cocky and arrogant. I’ve never rooted against an actual player so hard
Damn Jj where da hell you been bout time!
Bro Ben cool as hell
“This the moment we all been waiting on playboy 🐰. We here now”- Puffy voice 😂
His iq was never over looked. Just when it came down to assert himself vs certain matchups.
show starts 5:22
JJ is sensitive to players, which is why they feel comfortable enough to open up.
This is going to be good
Wonder if he plays more games then shots he he takes this year
Ben gonna do work in BK. Can’t wait 😎
JJ you goated for getting this interview
Zero accountability
Ben is an excuse machine...
He's right though. He really brings a lot to winning, minus the shooting. And yet, the media and "sports experts" really pointing out his shooting weakness..
I can’t wait til we see Ben, KD, and Kyrie! It’s literally a perfect fit! Ben for defensive player of the year and comeback player of the year!!! I’ll be rooting for you good or bad all year Ben! I’m saving up for tickets for a Brooklyn game so me and my girl can see you guys cook!!! Have a great day sir! And thanks JJ for getting this interview… it’s great to see him in such great spirits…
Russ next
Great interview guys... huge shout out to Ben... proud of you guy. Like many fans I was disapounted in your rapid decline, but I never doubted your ability to bounce back cause you've been such a good player and a good human being. This is big... a big important part of your positive come back. Next, get back on the court and play with a vengeance and ball your butt off. That will make the haters shut up and the doubters bow down and your redemption back in full swing. Best of luck guy!
⚔️💔
I’ll watch the film with you Ben. Be sure to add ya free throws
Been waiting on this one for a while 🔥
Maaan I wanna know what they cut out at 1:09:30. Seems like he was about to get something off his chest. Great interview regardless.
Great podcast Ben. Have fun this season!
I learned NOTHING from that interview
To sum it up:  “ wah wah wah wah wahhhhh”
Gerald Huston is the YouTuber who pranked Ben calling him Russell Westbrook. He’s done that to many celebrities and nba players
Lemme see what Ben talkin bout man. It’s early af lol
Great interview
Simmons needs to shoot mid range shots at times point blank period
Jj the goat
Bruh F**** with the Intro🔥🔥
A few minutes in, excited to hear his side of story opposed to medias narrative
Pacers fans catching strays but... facts. Great interview
man say his basketball IQ is high he know where everyone is on the floor could not realize that was Trey young and he should dunk to go up by 3
Ben Simmons is a great man honestly
"it's not about the money" says the guy who sued for the money.  F'ing Fraud
thank you JJ for giving this safe space for him to share his own truth. as a fan of basketball, it's beautiful to see how much ben has grown from all the things he's been through. i really hope we can all give him a second chance, to embrace who he really is a player, and shine in his own way to help his team win
I was big mad that y’all weren’t putting new stuff out but when I saw we were getting the Ben Simmons interview, i realized that it’s the off season and JJ literally just retired so we gotta give him a break if he works slower in the summer lmao.
production and quality is up boys! Congrats of everything. Need more Ben too!
Been waiting for this! Thanks JJ
seems most including Doc were fine with him just facilitating until sixers were knocked out
The media dehumanises players… watching him in a natural state reminds us he is human. Good for him to come to terms with the past and look forward, excited to see him on the court!
Awesome interview!
Finna be in the shadow of this Udoka news for alil lol
JJ looks like he has been living his old duke frat boy lifestyle
Jj took the summer off to kick it off wi Ben🐐🔥
Yesssssssir🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ben Simmons is delusional
i hope Gerald see this interview and that part about him callin Ben Russell
BEN10😈
My opinion has always been that you can only blame the coach and the best player for losing in game 7. If you wanna blame Ben Simmons for that game, you have to admit that Ben Simmons was better and more important than Joel in Philly.  Like, imagine Joel thinking he’s the leader of the team and he’s throwing other people under the bus. I wouldn’t want to play with dude. And follow him if he’s gonna blame me in the post game press conference. Imagine if MJ was like “it’s Scottie’s fault we can’t beat Detroit”
Soft ball questions but good podcast overall
Still some unanswered questions.
is it just the shirt or does he looks so thin?
I need Ben's therapist...now
HAHAHAH HE SAID HE WANTS TO WIN LMAO... ALL HE DID WAS CHOKE 😆  I GUESS THATS FUN TO HIM... All I know.. when he comes to Philly. He'll still get the biggest boo's in basketball history. I can't wait to see it. He was a really big let down.
BumassNga
Thank you JJ 🙏🏾
did you guys get enough pizza though?
JJ looks like he’s nursing a hangover
I remember when he first came into the league you could hear hints of his Australian accent, you hear none of it now
STILL BELIEVE HE CAN BE A TOP 2 PLAYER IF HE JUST SHOOTS THE DAMN BALL AND COME JOIN THE LAKERS PLEASE
Ben Brickons 🧱🧱🧱
54:37 shots at Joel
The amount of lies thrown in Ben's direction by the media these past 2 years is insane. Finally he got to tell his side of the story.
This guy is super fake...he acts a role it seems like..sounds like a totally different person when it's in front of certain crowds..👀
Watching this interview made me realize Ben Simmons is a cool dude ion know how people can hate him
JJ you’re the best journalist in the NBA
Someone work on the time stamps so its easier to watch the video, I highly doubt anyone is going to watch, 1-2 hours of ben Simmons, just the juicy stuff
💯
Simmons will finally play his natural Draymond green/amare Stoudemire role
Ben Simmons is a dumbbell. Just a big, stupid rellowfaced dummy. Apparently the only people he's smarter than is the brain trust in the NBA.
Ben is the X factor for brooklyn, everyone sleeping on ben
JJ a Goat getting this interview
JJ is the new media. Great content.
Glad we finally got to hear how Ben feels about the whole Philadelphia situation, great podcast once again JJ🙌🏻
Why are u sweating in your pants like a savage? 😂😂😂
Just ask him why doesn't he shoot!!!!!
Best episode yet
A1
Dude didn't take any accountability to anything he did, Everything with an excuse, yea everyone can get injured it's not in your hand but Bro when you are on the court you have the say on what you do Just being childish and entitled
You have  to respect JJ man he brings the best out of everyone.  Ben I hope ya have a great season man.  Mental health is a serious thing,  I hope all these shows take note on how JJ handle it.
This video should have time stamps. Everyone wants to hear that infamous dunk that he passed on.
Your show blows any network sports talk shows out of the water.
Best interview on 2022 and I haven’t started it yet. Shout out to JJ. Players player
Damn you called my pacers out now we not mid we are rebuilding 😭😂
JJ AND TOMMY BACK LETS GO!!!!!
Tell me why i forgot about this podcast and  was like How?? then I realize they haven’t uploaded for while 🤣
The boys always get great content. Love the pod!
Before I start this episode, I just wanted to comment my expectations lol! Please grill about Philly, shooting the ball, and wtf happened with the nets.
I dunno if I buy the whole humble routine going on here. This dude been spoiled his whole life. Ben better back this talk up and have a great season.
This guy without Joel over 60 games averaged 18-9-7. In the playoffs without Embiid for most games averaged 19-11-8 vs Miami and 17-7-7 vs Nets. If that paint was open at Philadelphia he would have been the ideal player. Ben playing “with a bunch of white guys” showed that 😊
This dude is soft... J.J pitching this dude soft balls.. This dude is a fraud...
i was not expecting to get the candy store story YOU ARE A W JJ
camera work getting better Jason!
22:00 Very interesting insight. Can't shoot 3s, but #1 (over 3 seasons) at getting 3s from a teammate.
You can hear it in his voice he’s not confident enough to shoot 3s
A big thanks to the Old man & the Three for guesting Ben and let him speak his side!! I wanted to see Ben in this podcast since y'all started in the bubble
Great interview 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Nice to hear this dude speak out but as a Sixers fan I can care less about him as a person as well as a player. He is a fraud .... unfortunately in real  Life facts speak louder than words Ben Simmons!
That was wonderful JJ. Happy to see Ben smile after all this time. This goes way beyond basketball. I'm a hardcore philly fan (from France), so I hope the nets aren't too good this year. But seeing you guys talk so openly and with trust was a wonderful experience that made my day. Ben, you're a hell of an athlete, you have all the talent and the skills to be a perenial all-star. All the best to you in your future. And bravo to JJ for an honest interview with difficult questions that many would have been afraid to ask. 10/10
TIMESTAMPS JJ! TIMESTAMPS!!!
20:42 that’s such a lie. If Ben really wanted to win you would Improve the holes in his game. It’s one thing to not be a good shooter, but Simmons didn’t even attempt shots. And when the going got tough, he quit and took a sabbatical year. Doesn’t sound like he knows what a winner is
Shoutout to Ben Simmons man,been Waiting for him to shut these stupid rumors up
I don’t think they will win over there the championship. No leadership Ben at this stage is gonna be the greatest utility player ever remains an all star just not a no .1. See Andrew Wiggins once he was able to just play ball with no expectations he’s gonna be great as a role player.
You haven’t been on the court for about two years
Let the ben simmons rehab tour begin. Get on the court and ball out....shoot the ball....or it's gonna be a long season.
As a Philadelphian I would have liked to see him take a little more accountability. Notice everytime he said the word "mental health" he cracked a smile.
Ben sublimely trying to recruit JJ to NETS while JJ is professing, he's a broken player lol. I mean we lost Coach Korver, JJ can be a shooting consultant. huh? JJ? Yes?
This man really not taking responsibility for anything at all 😂 I wonder if kd and kyrie will coddle him like everyone else. It's crazy because everything he's saying now he said about Philly until they "threw him under the bus".
If Ben and Kyrie are good and focused I have the Nets as favorites easily
dude has a max contract without playing or shooting and he still thinks people overlook his basketball IQ. everyone knows you have a high basketball iq?
What an amazing podcast with Ben !!! Can’t wait for the season and see this nets team come together
Finally! Been waiting for weeks for you guys to return . Welcome back and thanks for delivering a great first episode after the long break 🎉 cheers from Malaysia
Those early teams were lit. I was mad when they let Dario and Covington go. They had something going.
I think we do respect what he bring to table. Nobody in Philly ever said you wasn’t really really good but he can be great. We expected great.
Omg JJ look amazing with that mustache
First few minutes of listening to Ben he needed a real OG / mentor to guide and protect him through his NBA career
“In your first rookie year”😂😂😂😂
great episode!
Raps fans don’t hate Simmons! We hate smart and embiid lmao
That was a great interview. Feels more like a therapy session for Sixers fans haha. Closure for Ben's tenure in Philly.   Truth is, divorce was hard. Sixers FO and fans loved Ben from the beginning, wanted him to be better and achieve greatness, was disappointed when he came up short, and never wanted to see him go, and did not want to lose 50 cents on the dollar in the break up...
Favorite episode by far. Rooting for you Ben. Get that Chip.
Just look at the smurk he has on his face during the whole interview 🤣
Wtf is up with all of the pizza boxes??? 😂😂
I like what JJ said about the pacers, like they haven’t reached more conference finals than Philly has this century lmao
Bounce back year for Simmons !
I'm sorry but I can tell that he hasn't taking work out very serious this summer.
Da truuuutthhhh!!!!!
Bro I can not wait till the season starts 😮
I needed closer for Ben Simmons leaving Philly. Thank you JJ.
I aint seen the interview yet so I dont know how straight forward and honest he was. But massive props to Ben for at least sitting down to address all the issues he had last year. It's the first time in a while you can honestly give him props because of something.
You can tell how much Ben trusts JJ. He’s talking to him as a friend. Only JJ could’ve gotten this interview.
This is what they call in showbiz a 'Puff Piece'. Fuckin hell.
“You don’t guard Kevin “ 😂😂😂 why does everyone say this exactly when asked about Kd
Everyone in these comments that fell for Ben’s act here is pathetic
Zaza Reddick🍃🍃 , that’s why those eyes blood shot lol
did he learn how to shoot yet??
Not for catching the weekend crowd and capturing interest
Can’t believe it ! I have been waiting for this . Ben keep your head up !
Looking forward to the return of weekly episodes!
The fact that he acts as if we don't know he can do all the other stuff it's the shooting and folding in big moments. We know you can play d we know you can dish the rock. We also know that you will fold in big time moments and refuse to shoot or even practice free throws
I would love to see ben in Dallas with luka.
Wow, Finally! Welcome home Ben!
I sympathize with his mental struggles but he still cashed a lot of checks that would otherwise have gone to players who would have laced up and took the court.  That’s why people don’t respect him
Love the podcasts because it eliminates the disconnect we have with knowing someone from afar. Hearing Ben and his experiences allows you to empathize what he’s went through and it changes your perception and presumptions.
I know for a fact alot of people acting excited and supportive in these comments were haters it's crazy how the world works
Being a diehard Sixers fan, I have for sure MF’d Ben many many times but getting to hear his side of the story and the way that he handles himself is very eye opening into how hard we were on him and how good of a mindset he has. Of course him not adapting his game to be able to shoot was one thing but I love how he carries himself and talk about Philly after everything we did to him. I wish Ben the best of luck!
Despite they might go down as the most hated big 3 in nba history, I’m rooting for them.
Thank god you guys back, missed you guys!
Can we get drose on one of these ?
maybe JJ can teach him how to shoot
W Ben Brooklyn going to the finals for sure
Great interview.  That’s why JJ, Matt, and Stephen are the best former players to do podcasts
So funny all the Bron haters say “he dosent make his teammates better he’s 4-6” yet all the players KNOW and the players say otherwise. Facts over opinions
I love Ben Simmons game! I wish he would’ve been able to come over to the Pistons! When Philly didn’t want him anymore. Detroit would’ve loved him, just like we did Ben Wallace.  we love defenders.
It's good the fact that he's even coming out and discussing it. Maybe he is done hiding.
Best team they had was Ben Ersan JJ Marco etc. then Clown Embiid ruined it.
This remind me of that florida trashcan situation.
We’re back!
Not this niqqa 😂
Ben Simmons needs to go to San Antonio Coach Pop would max out his best abilities
I wish Ben all the best. But I wish he were still in Philly.
Wonder what was cut at the hour 2 minute mark
That dude from the candy store does that to mad famous ppl. It’s a prank
These Aussies funny as hell what are they feeding people
The nets going to be so scary people forget how damn good this guy is
It’s been amazing listening to people talk about Ben’s basketball game like he’s just a marginal player 🤷‍♂️
This gane against Cleveland in 2018 Simmons had 27, 15 and 13, on 70% FG%. Monster game. Not to mention his defense. He is underrated.
I'm so glad we've got Redick to do an interview like this. Simmons has been the butt of the hyper judgmental nba social media gossips for the past year, and I don't think anyone else would have been able to treat him fairly or get him to come out of his shell like in this interview. The Nets are a clown show this off season, but Simmons should have a chance to prove himself once he gets on the court. I hope he has a good year.
Listening to this whole interview just makes me feel like Ben Simmons didn’t deserve the amount of vitriol he receives online. It really does go to far
Boy oh Boy
This is crazy!! Can’t believe you got Ben on here this is going to be a good pod
they obviously threw him under the bus, why you talk about your players in such a way?
I knew Ben Simmons is one of the greatest defensive players ever to play when he said that “defending the NBA’s Elites is FUN”.😂
I'mma winner I want to win ... So what happened in that Atlanta Hawks game we could've won😐❓
Missed y’all
Wish he did this earlier, public perception would’ve changed drastically
Great to hear the other side of the story. Good interview.
Good interview all around
You know what is NOT money? Ben Simmons’ jumpshot
Is it easier for Ben Simmons to adopt Steph's or Jokic's playstyle.  A point Guard or Center ???
Ben couldn't take the pressure of that Atlanta game yes he can pass yes he can play defense but after that game he couldn't  cope
Ben has lots to prove this year, I hope he mans up and has a healthy year at minimum
Ben KD and Kyrie 🔥🔥🔥
Usually a fan jj thought u were little soft here didn’t get the question off that should be asked
DAMN!!! Well I'm a Ben fan again, let's go get some pizza
"I'm a winner"............LMFAO!
Come on Brooklyn... conference finals should be the floor
Everything from this interview makes me not want him on my team. Juice isn’t worth the squeeze.
The Problem I believe most people have with Ben apart from him not living up to the expectation of being “The Next Lebron” is that his game is very limited for the amount of money he makes.
Enabling at its finest and I get everybody’s friends but stop it.. excuses… you came to practice cause you wanted the money. You had a chance to be a good teammate a million other times but you didn’t. I get it thou, this is to protect his image so good interview nonetheless
Trasssshhhh
Being a knicks fan we are used to the excuses as to the lack of performance.... but to see someone who holds back is absurd. My team is on the verge of getting sent home you wouldn't even know about my injuries. We nitpick Giannis BUT HE GETS BETTER GAME BY GAME. Simmons is every teams draft nightmare; I want out so fckkk the fans...... stop cottling this guy
🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
Ben Simmons  Respect++
both of you guys really need to step up your lighting game. it looks terrible.  still love your content tho!
Breaking news Ben Said he's out for this Season because of a Bad Sore Back 🤔🏀😭😂🤕🤔🙄🙃
“D”-ing Luka all night must be nice 17:40
JJ Reddick a Goat!  Bringing Bricks Simms outtta from under his Rock!!!  Good to hear from Ben tho.
JJ so biased when he likes the players 😂
the guy in the candy store makes those type of videos he does that to everyone lmfao he’s a tiktoker
JJ looking like a undercover cop 😂
FINALLY THE BEST PODCAST IS BACK I BEEN TOO BORED LISTENING TO THESE TRASH ONES
Been waiting for this.  Really wanted to hear his side  So I listened and he is quite likeable. Wish he spoke earlier. I dont think JJ asked enough of the question I wanted to hear especially when it felt he was restating his position on the issue. We heard it already just ask the question and let the man talk. Biggest take away is once you hear the human being he is pretty relatable and yeah we would all have handled that kind of thing in a similar manner. He also admitted he didn't handle things the best way so thats nice to hear. I wish him well and hope the injuries abate.
I can’t stand this dude Fr
@25:13 JJ giving him the blueprint in such a home boy way! Salute JJ!   “Make a goal to shoot 5 threes a game”
Can’t wait to see Ben10 out there playing in the black and white this year!!
Exhausting....😂😂😂😂 try working a real job instead of playing a game for a living. This guy was slated to be the next LBJ, on mag covers but yet he's consistently commenting on what's tough for him. We don't have tears for you. Get your sht together.
17:40 Ayoo?? 🤨
I knew when they said Ben had a herniated disk why he was out for so long. I have a herniated disk in my back that flareup every once in a while and completely understand the debilitating pain that just makes you immobile for weeks sometimes and takes months to heal back to normal. After so many years living with a herniated disk you will know the queues that cause them to flare up and avoid them but I wish Ben the best next season with the Nets.
how does this interview not have a million views already?  Let's go champ!
Between JJ and Jxmmy my hoops addiction is satisfied for the summer
Great content fun and easy to watch
They’re not guarding everybody smart man because you not scoring. Which makes it harder for the rest of the team right?
boring couldn't watch the entire video..  he wasn't gonna ask tough questions and his arrogance oozes with every word....
LSU definitely paid him😭
SO MANY SOFTBALL QUESTIONS AND MEAT RIDING BY JJ
People really disrespected this man and his name, if you have never had back pain especially one this debilitating, please do not judge someone and their character. Sixers were widely out of pocket, Embiid and Rivers really need a reality check as well, throwing this man under the bus and doing some of the stuff they did was just not right. S/o Jay Williams, shaq still my guy too even though he thinks everyone should be diesel minded like himself.
Had to press it right away w interview
Crazy part we still go love for him in Philly smh
I’m still not hearing any accountability from this guy. Once Shaq hears that you want him to “protect you” he’ll even be more upset.
I’m tired of it . Stop saying you’re trying to win. Moral is Philly could have won had you scored and shot more. So no Ben you weren’t trying to win
Im just hear for him to acknowledge everythings that’s happened
Can't believe we are finally gonna hear Simmon's lie of the story
Lets goo!!
Love the podcast, but you guys doing this all in one sitting (interview, ad announcement, general overview) would make things much cleaner, concise, and simply better and would position the conversation in a better/easier/less show type of light. Also, not sure if a synopsis of what you guys talk about literally right before we watch the conversation is needed
I'd only do interviews too if I knew they'd be nice to me 💆🏽
Wonderful interview, enjoyed every minute. I'm glad Ben is in a good place.
1:08:50 he was literally looking at Trae after the spin. As in face to face. That's why he passed the ball. Because he thought he was giving his teammate an easier shot because it was Trae Young in front of him. Stop lying.🤦
Jj is interviewing call of duty streamers now?
Ben10 nice
TLDW ben thinks the specific play wasn't the main problem but he thought the whole series he didn't perform to the best of his abilities as he was already going through hurdles mentally throughout the post season.  Personally I can agree. Ben and the rest of the team just didn't play as well as they could because if they did the series wouldn't have been as close as it was and that play wouldn't have had to happen
This Guy toots his on horrn he's a clown Durant will see it
I’m rooting for Ben, start a new life in Brooklyn ❤
The way Tommy just let them catch up with forcing his own question >>> great co-host
He said "i was just fuckin" lol that was an iso statement
Thanks for being the most authentic conduit for nba insight. Don't sell out for more clicks. Play the long game. There are 14 year Olds that want to be on your podcast one day. You're the gatekeeper of one of the most followed fraternities in the world.
I wonder what Ben's making for dinner? Looks like beef stew in a red wine sauce...
Dear Ben Simmons Forget what people say about you your alright in my books
Does anybody have a link or know what game at least JJ’s craziest shot is in?
this guy is a thief been in the league for 5 yrs and still cant shoot
He says he doesn’t care about the money but then files for grievance months later…
Ben:"no one is guarding Kevin!" Tatum:"Huh?! Hold my beer"
1:01:59 I’m getting fined for not lifting weights but physically I’m one of the strongest players. This guy is a 🤡
This interview sounds Rehearsed.
That Philly team was so stacked. Really wanted to see them run it back.
Gained a lot of respect for him after this
Benn going to win a championship with NETS
I just gotta say I love Venmo.
Overall it’s good he left philly cus they dragged him through the mud to the point it was over anything
great episode.
You and Draymond make all the other media look soft af.
Man I hope the top coach in the NBA is Ime Udoka 🤣
Watch him ball out this up coming season and shut the haters up
18:30 ice trae still got that man shook 😂
Get tf outta here the process been over..soon as we traded him we proceeded.   Talking bout winning a championship isn’t guaranteed… yeah if your PG won’t shoot.   We got to the second round every year and you not wanting to grow is why we stayed stagnant…we didn’t see progress in the team, and when you are the star that wasn’t showing progress it’s only logical to blame you.
For around 30 minutes of this interview Ben was asked about some topics before the whole sixers debacle  and all he kept on saying was “I didn’t worry about it too much” and “it is what it is” like he seriously doesn’t take any accountability for anything
Rap fans don't hate you. Old school aker fans might. But we don't
Great Interview, thanks for that! When JJ said that he's sorry for Ben it actually kinda touched me cause I felt sorry for him too. So Ben, if you could read this, I'm really rooting for you this season. You seem like a great guy. Best wishes from Germany.
Good content fellas and great to hear from the man himself
Philly messed up lost a good one
Awesome to hear, the young man was in need of some help and was openly seeking it. Good for him to understand this in life. New found respect for Ben and looking for ward to this season.
Mate you can tell he double takes when mentioning when he last played Atlanta. It seems to be the  first time he's actually come to terms with what happened. Literally a foot taller than 5'11 trae but refused to dunk on him.
Great interview. Good insight! Ben has always been one of my favorite players and I hope he balls out this season!
JJ should be honest with him and tell him that he needs to just start shooting. He's got a mental block and needs to develop a no fear mentality. It's not the end of the world if you miss a shot. It's normal!
Jj the goat for this
Alll the hate I had for Ben completely gone tbf  Now I’m rooting for him  I think we all forget how good he is
Man as one the biggest summons fan, and sixers fan., let’s hear this
Wow I've been waiting for this so long.
10:30  i’m actually so happy this got highlighted, because this is the beginning of my love for the game, i watched the last game on this run with my dad, probably the first nba game i’ve ever watched, and they won by like 30 or 40 points.. ever since then i loved nba ball
Man I can already see Stephen A and all of ESPN talking about this interview on First Take, SportsCenter, NBA Today, all of them. Great interview here JJ, this is major
Nets nation 💯💯💯
The new media 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dumpster
Firstly, huge fan of the pod and JJ from his Duke days. Content is amazing please keep it up! Request: is it possible to consider having timestamps for every episode going forward?
Damn jj no time stamps 😢
Hate this guy. But I guess I’ll watch lmaoo
This interview amounts to a fluff piece. JJ clearly didn't ask any hard hitting questions or stuff ppl really wanted to know. It's just a chance for him to showcase his friendship and get a name for his platform that nobody else can get. I get it. JJ basically answered some of the questions for him.
This dude is a clown and this interview changes nothing. He lives in a delusional world.
What Ben10 brings to a team definitely makes up for his shooting but like he said it ain’t about nothing to practice and get better .   Remember he is stopping your best player from scoring too 😏
J.J. sending strays to the Pacers. Chill my guy. 🤣🤣🤣
Whole lotta words…his actions tell the true story.
Not gonna lie, been a Ben Simmons hater for a while but this interview changed my perspective on a few things.  Hoping he has a good bounce back season.  Also, karma to Doc Rivers for throwing Ben under the bus 😂 bro got caught slipping on Twitter
Ben Simmons = the most underrated star in the NBA
ben still doesn't get it with the shooting thing. He refused to even try to shoot, Giannis tries. It hurt the team. Dude is clueless and I was a big Ben fan
Hold on I gotta roll up first
I am who I am, it is what it is. This bum is trash hasn't grown at all since the trade
I see my fellow Sixers fans aren’t here to breakdown this bs yet
Ben, your my favorite player in the nba and I was disappointed by your performance in the playoffs. But I know you’re an elite player who impacts winning far beyond your scoring. I just hope you come out this season wanting to change your narrative and prove the haters wrong.
I feel like I really know him now, I think people ignore the 'human' qualities of celebrities and famous atheletes which is really sad. This man had an immense amount of pressure on him and instead of people giving him the help he needed, they trolled him relentlessly. Even as a Philadelphia supporter, I hope Ben can bounce back stronger than ever before.
Love how y’all release these fast like that much appreciate 🙏🏿
JJ,   can u please start mentioning the brand of wine being drank in each episode? I feel comfortable speaking for other wine enthusiasts, that we all would appreciate this!
If he can shoot free throws, how come he missed like 70% of them in the playoff?
This is a terrible interview , JJ throw him soft balls the whole interview and just 0 pushback .  Bro got some points but nah this ain’t it put somebody up there that’s not a fanboy JJ talking to him as if he already a knows certain stuff but as a viewer nah we wanna know .
Remember this interview the next time the talking heads crucify a player
What weve All been waiting for! 🫣🙏. Popcorn is ready
I cant wait to see ben play i might shed a tear hes my favorite player n i missed him all last season. Im not missing a game.
as a sixers fan, you know we tuning in to this BIG TIME
I say this with a lot of love and kinship with Ben's game, the case and benefits for a player to shoot underhand free throws has rarely been this exciting. Theres almost no player in history with a better case to make the switch based on the combination of his best traits. I don’t say that with a belief he couldn’t improve his shooting, or think its as big of a deal as many make it. Its just that the underlying numbers based on his other skills makes the case better than most (although he is not the only one). Even Giannis would be wise to make the jump even if he's brought the foul line conversion to plus points and is an MVP talent. If this interviews tone is true then really screw the haters and break the dumb stereotypes Ben!  By almost all metrics it’s a more feasible and repeatable approach with higher percentages. Especially factoring hand size. It doesn’t mean Ben cant shoot regular and or stretch range in a conventional shot as well. That said the focus on the 3 is dumb, and isnt really necessary, its the stripe that should be his focus. Someone is eventually going to make the jump and look like a genius for doing so. And considering Ben's ability to get to the rim exceptionally, 80% at the line not only helps production but also possible spacing and gravity with players wary of sending him to the line. The geometry could could look totally different. Simply this change could vault him to an elite offensive player.
You would think the people hating on him live a perfect life. Lmao
What's with all the Fini Pizza boxes?
Interview dope af. JJ is amazing. Shout out to Ben Simmons
We cyberbullied this Millionaire just so he could rise up as an underdog, gtfo here y’all hypocrites. He could say whatever he wants but his actions said something else.
JJ and Tommy doing what no one else can, get a sit down with Ben. Jeez 🔥
59:40 I was waiting for the mental illness excuse to come up. If the 22k/yr Walmart worker with 4 kids can't use mental illness not to come to work, how can the 30 million a year NBA player use it as an excuse? 90% of elite sports is mental toughness. So if you are mentally week you should not play. You can't have it both ways.
Ben seems cool as hell!  I hope he balls out this year!
Ben didn’t score in the 4th quarter for virtually that entire Hawks series…
Ben, rebbel sports and other outlets sold yr jersey like kristaps...
NBA = NETs Basketball Association 💯❕🏀
BEN 10 let’s goooooo
Why do people forget that Ben Simmons had his team as the 1 seed in his last full season? Simmons has always been elite in the regular season. He needs to prove he can be effective in the playoffs.  But I do have to say in the play-offs the guy is just mentally weak or something. My guess is that his fundamentals are just wrong and that can be ignored/forgotten about in the regular season but is a huge issue in the play-offs.  Let's hope he can bounce back and prove all the doubters and haters wrong and I'm sure he will. I really do wanna see him back on the court doing well, leaving the past behind.
If your goal is to win then you need to know by not being able to shoot free throws, your team is much easier to lose.   Simmons is spewing all of his media training on this one.
simmons practically stole money from 76ers & nets last yr & even had the audacity to sue the 76ers for loss of pay when he sulked & sat out
The shades do look cool
That was a great interview. I'm glad Ben got to explain himself. JJ is really good at this. Shout out to the other interviewer as well.
Been waiting for this
As a Philadelphia sports fan, despite how Ben downplays it. the anger comes from what is looked at as a lack of effort to improve. No one questions his talent. I can't root for him to succeed now because I will feel even more cheated because he didn't do it here when the only thing holding Ben back was Ben. And I am really tired of all these made up stats.....There are far to many made up stats.....How do you measure 3pt shots "created" for others?? Who's to say they were open because of Ben when Embiid is the guy getting double teamed??
i actually really respect how he’s handled this entire saga and came out of it more mature and toughened. regardless of his flaws and any mistakes im rooting for him to succeed (even more)
This is what a lot have been waiting for Ben Never spoke on nothing
Been waiting 18 months for this, good to hear Ben is in a better place.
Definitely rooting for Ben Simmons, he comes off very humble and respectful. Pray this upcoming season is favorable for him and he’s able to make a monstrous comeback.
Too bad they didn't really address the Philly break up that much. JJ said it and Ben agreed but he didn't really open up about it. People can be so nasty I'm surprised Ben is looking so composed now. That's a seriously hard recovery process. I think a lot of the evil Fan response was driven by Ben's flashy rich style that rubs a lot of average people the wrong way but they don't want to admit it. I wrote a bit about it at Raptors Slander on Substack defending Ben when the Raptors looked to be interested in picking him up to clear a designated rookie spot for the Nets to trade Durant.
Ben can say anything but his actions will tell if he truly humbled himself and is working on his game. This is the same dude that was rude to TMac at the draft
I've never seen Ben so happy before love to see it after all the drama
This was a great episode that I didn't expect hearing ben talk was excellent mental health isn't talked about enough especially in men, hoping he has a healthy season and keeps looking after himself
Oh if he doing interviews he definitely playing this season
It’s good to see Ben comfortable too hopefully he balls out this season and shut the doubters wrongs
And thats why the NEW MEDIA is taking over. Players are just more comfortable around ex-players rather than a journalist.
He is right he brings a lot to the table I think he has got his mind  together and he is gonna have a big year
This is a big one JJ. I do hope this improves the sentiment on Simmons since he's not devoid of criticism but he definitely has that potential checklist coming out the draft.
Glad Ben Simmons is moving to the 4/5 Position Sixers Misused him also shouldn’t have drafted him he never was a good fit for Embiid
Yes lord! We needed this! As a Kd fan, Ben said he will shoot threes this season! I’m holding him to that.
Anyone wanna drop a time stamp for when he starts asking the questions we all want to hear?
76ers fan here and a fan of Ben. But this interview shows how much he continues to deflect blame to others and does not accept responsibility for his wrongdoings. Like he said himself earlier in the interview, Philly fans would not have cared as much about his shooting if we knew he couldn't do it
Hate to see him leave Philly. I’d rather have him over an aging superstar, but it is what it is now. Hope he has a great year!
Mornin
It's interesting how he slipped up several times during this interview and said "we" in reference to the Sixers. Guess he's still adjusting
Plss have timestamps
ALL THE BEST BEN!!!
Still hate Ben and probably always will but thank you JJ for getting this interview
Now everyone wants the best for Ben.
This guy is the mentally softest superstar in NBA history.
Nets in 6. Revenge szn
Missed you guys, started wondering about status.
44:40 just ask Boston 4-0 😂😂😂
“I’m 6’10, I can make any f*kin pass.” Love Ben man.
had L4/5 surgery myself, people will not understand what it means when you don't feel your feet or can't walk. After 4 months started working out, getting back to the court and everybody is acting up that you are weak and can't deal with your stuff.
Ben was defense player of the year a couple time when he got in the league and he need to be the same when he start playing the Bklyn . Ben bring ur A game Ben to Bklyn
W
Joel didnt throw him under the bus
Ego hasn’t changed. There’s not a humble bone in Simmons’s body.
Just how many pizzas did JJ had the night before?
Can someone put time stamps for this video?
I remember going to a Kendrick Lamar concert and they were chanting F Ben Simmons I think this city hates him for life respectfully and I’m not even from there
So they aren’t going to talk about the 150 billion open threes he refused to shoot? Oh..okay.
only jj could get this interview
I don't like watching interviews of sensitive people. U know the interviewer is using kid gloves
JJ is a hypocrite him and Stephen a used to crush and destroy Ben together 🤦🏿‍♂️😂😂
Ben Simmons would be the perfect fit for the warriors. Him in the Draymond green role would be a cheat code
I'm almost afraid to watch this
Very happy to hear of more content
Ben Simmons will literally be an MVP if he just has a post game and can sink free throws. He has literally everything else to be a generational talent
Anyone else counting all the green pizza boxes in the background?
I rewatched that shot, and he started running and took 3 steps! Wow haha. Sorry Philly fans
It's great to see Ben is in good spirits. I like this side of Ben
IT WAS FUNNY
Yeah they missed on picking Ben and Fultz
To me these were soft ball questions, but also noticed he didn't ask him anything about Joel .
This gon be good bru
Did he ghost you guys before when committing to do the podcast, because he ghosted the national team when he was on all the billboards for Australia vs USA games before the World Cup
If you guys could ever get Russell Westbrook that would be unbelievable
I don't expect a new topic to come from this about Ben, But you gotta listen to hear at least a few juicy tidbits. I'd love some honest stuff about who all he could specifically say he didn't get along with and/or when this manifested.
He only talking because he scammed Philly out of money that sh!t sad
Way to go JJ
JJ and Tommy are The goats
Only dumbass ang overrated can't appreciate Ben Simmons talent. Realtalk.
ben simmons has the most punchable face of any athlete. Seeing his stupid face immediately changes my mood for the worst. So glad he's not on my team. I haven't disliked an athlete's face like this since tyler hansborough.
Biggest episode of the podcast! I’ve been waiting for this for years! Thank you JJ for having this man on and telling his story in a comfortable and friendly environment. Something he’s probably been denied for a long time.
Dang JJ can I get breakfast first 😂
Great job jj this man still one of my favourite player
Weak excuses from Ben and sad pandering from JJ and that other dud.
this is the big one
NBA fans treat players like robots and don’t understand that they are humans and go through things just like us. hearing Ben talking about his challenges with his back and his mental over the last few years. I hope the best for him going forward.
Now this is something I've been dying to hear.
This guy is the biggest JO in the world. He was a disaster in Philadelphia. He sits here and acts like he did something great, complete fraud.
This is one of my favorite no nonsense basketball channels. Pure basketball talk
Wants to get easy buckets but missed a wide open lay up
Ben Simmons basketball IQ is never overlooked. Because without IQ, he'd have nothing left.
20:45 Ben really inspires me with his answer to that shooting question 💯💯 “I’m also not good at it so I’m not gonna get mad at what ppl think I’m gonna practice and get better at that sh”
They cancel Andrew Tate but analysts on espn can bash a man about mental health/ rehab and still have platforms 😢
17:42 ayo tommy what did you just say😳
Okay JJ,I been waiting on someone to get hold of this young bright star. Ben has been through it. He dug deep and now it's on like a pot of neck bones. Super thrilled to see him back. Great interview and a outstanding player. Thanks
Yea let’s interview a self hating racist who would rather chase WP bevsyse he hates himself because he wishes he was white. Great interview choice
Ben is still a clown.
The media is gonna have a field day twisting this interview up! Philly does look like a bunch of cnts after all. I Hope Ben comes our firing this year he’s been through it.
That Ben Cleveland game is up there with my favorite Sixers games I've ever seen in person. The energy was so electric and Ben played phenomenal. Those were the good old days. Wish we could go back.
I think that play when Ben passed instead of going up on Trae Young was what magnified the shooting. Just imagine if they wouldve won how different things would be. You know how fast ppl forget when you win. If you dont believe just look at Lebron. He had Legacy defying games that would make us look at him completely different had he lost some of those finals. But since he won the storylines that wouldve been no longer exist
That's hilarious they brought up the Gerald Huston video in the mall 😂.
Shut em up Ben
Still one of my favourite players, still believe Ben has the potential to become a modern day Magic Johnson type player.
Interview starts at 5:22. Thanks for this content JJ I’ve been dying to hear his side of the story
Good for Simmons. Philly fans will have a response though.
Never thought I would see the day this episode releases
Big fan of ben. Awesome to see some positive media about him, can’t wait to see him play again
Ooooooooh let’s go
Great interview JJ. I see Ben is still not taking accountability
Sounds like Ben was talking to Kevin Durant 🤔
Sixers by 100 next game Simmons plays in against them
Ye Ben dont get compared to players like draymond or other defensive giants, he getting compared to giannis, lebron, etc. And like he said for the future in brooklyn, is he really goin to get a decent chance to improve and get shots up with kyrie and KD on the team? lol. tough spot really but i hope he grows into whatever role he wants to play and remains comfortable with that.
explains a lot, Shaq a dog
Part of having a hi ball iq means not over passing and know when to shoot it. That is a very important aspect of playing point! Shooting is a part of ball and you must get comfortable or you will hurt your team in the playoffs.
I knew Ben was arrogant, but WOW
So Simmons actually wants to a glue guy („I just play to win and bring a lot to the court apart from shooting“)  Does he want to get paid like a glue guy too ? 🤔
Boston Celtics ran a clinic on how to guard Kevin and Ky
you can just tell the first response in bens a head is to tell everyone what he thinks they wanna hear, then he actually gives HIS answer
JJ you shouldn't have! Big ups to you!! Thanks Ben for coming on. Great interview
Big Sixers and Ben fan and wished it worked out in Philly.  2022-23 season will be fun to watch with the Sixers and Nets.
hell yeah jj, this is why you’re the best. Simmons wouldnt trust anyone else for this type of chat.
If he doesnt care about the money.. why sue to get it baaaaaaack? Draaaaaake????
Thank you for defending MP jj 🙏🙏
🥱😴
I love how Ben Simmons is talking about his side he has to because many people will never understand why he did what he did.
Ben still playing the victim…dude quit on his team and blames everyone else. Kick rocks man.
It's a wrap the nets winning the chip
There is pictures of the phone in your pocket. No one made that up. JJ you didn’t hold him accountable. I’m glad he is in a better mental space but he is not taking accountability for letting the team down. The city and the Team supported you for years.
yooooooooooooooooooooooooo
He's a bum
Thank you Jj
dont worry BEN we love and root for you here in BK. #ScaryHoursYear4
Ben sending shots at Joel at 54:34 👀
Not watching this bum
OLD MAN AND THE THREE IS BACKKKK
Great interview
I’m so happy you and draymond back in “podcast lab” 😅💪🏽
Let's goooooo!!!!
WE BACK BABY!!
Say what?! @17:38
One the next four players gotta be Derrick Rose, bro 🌹🌹🌹 🙏🙏
Ben must really like jj
Ben shows and highlights the fact that he has been mentally weak on and off the court. It's still concerning that he doesn't see why he was criticized by Philly fans and the team.
He’s still the same imo
Jj gave two months talking points for espn guys by doing this interview
Great interview and it's exactly what i wanted to hear from Simmons.  Hopefully this  year he will get back on track and be the best version of himself that he can be.
Bro better start shootin lol
He’s actually a cool guy . I though he was a stuck up Lightskin dude
I'm not a hater, but what I think, this guys earn a looooots of money, the least he can do is to learning how to get better at shooting. Dont get wrong, he is a great player, all star caliber and all defense team all day long, but at least he can do is get better at shooting, see lonzo ball, he was a bag o sh*** shooting and he Improve so much, so ben can do this too
Hope he’s streaming video games on twitch getting ripped for being soft.
Not gonna lie, Ben seems like a really chill dude
JJ is the best interviewer in sports
I’m rooting for the Ben Simmons redemption story. Go get em young man.
Man how good is this podcast
You can tell Simmons never faced any adversity in his life which is likely why he’s not respected by his teammates or anyone.
Ben Simmons is soft he’s not a shooter that’s why he’s not a part of the 76ers you got to be strong to play in Philly
They couldn’t wait to get this out
Ben if you ever check these comments I love you man and I want you to know you have full support from nets fans we all want you to play how you play and be u. You’re a fantastic player and we all know you will bounce back from the unfortunate adversity that the unprofessional franchise of the sixers forced upon you.
Juicy news
20:00 big gulp of wine as the shooting gets brought up 😂
Love how JJ actually understands Ben instead of critiquing everything he did
Let's gooooo!! Welcome back boys!
He won’t shoot
Of course we dont see him ballin 😂
Jj we want Dbook plssssssssssss
He is goof
Happy to see Ben in a much better headspace
sidenote: is Tommy the one I'll see periodically on Desus Nice's instagram? lol
Man, dudes like JJ Reddick and Pat Mcafee really make it hard to ever go back to ESPN or Skip & Shannon! I'd much rather listen to players breaking down the game then these puppets on TV
Ben just has a ton of haters and if he ends up being successful all the haters will find another player to project on..
Some will still hate him, but he’s in an amazing spot to bounce back this year IF (big if) things go smooth in Brooklyn. Hope he’s really learned and grown from all this. Mega talent
59:25 I hope Joel never speaks to you again JJ.
is it just me or do i remember him having an Australian accent when he was drafted
The new and improved fresh prince has finally arrived 🙌 #lithour #bennyboyback I've waited for this my whole lifeee
5:22 🤝🏾
JJ has a nose hair sticking out
It was such a breath of fresh air hearing Ben talk openly, relaxed and honest. It’s easy for us as supporters to hate on any professional player but man it must be hard when it’s about you. Unbelievable job getting Ben on JJ, frighten awesome watch!
so hype
Great for JJ on pushing back on the “it wasn’t about the money thing” and questioning why he showed back up, even if it was a discreet pushback
As a sixers fan I don’t wanna hear it. I refuse to watch. He’ll regret not sticking it out here. Everyone grows at different points in their lives mentally. Just wish he did sooner… I’ll listen when he’s retired and more understanding.
BEEN NEEDING THESE PODCASTS THANK U FOR COMIN BACK JJ AND THE CREW
Tre young 200lbs 😭😭😭😭
Jj back? I love the show but he sure is made of glass lmao can get on espn and flame people if he gets it back mildly he splits
The guy did the same thing to rondo called him chris paul thats like his gig on ig 🤣🤣
Despite the progress we’ve made as a society, the conversation around mental health can always be furthered. Thank you Ben, JJ and Tommy.
Noice
My boy Ben bout to ball out
This should be good 😈
Ben still refuses to take accountability. I'm not even surprised
“Long?” Dawwg💀💀
Early bird gets the worm
He called Trey young a waterbug 😂
Already 20 minutes through this video and I hear Ben say four times about "wanting to win". Yet he didn't take his craft seriously and he could never take accountability. He had a great opportunity to win in Philly. He also stated that he cares more about winning then his actual numbers yet one of the reasons he wanted out of Philly was because he wanted to be the "guy". If I remember correctly during one of his last press conferences in philly Dei Lyman actually question him about his lack of scoring the ball and being aggressive and his answer was "how many assists did I have tonight?" or something along those lines. Hopefully he has learned from his mistakes. Kevin Durant and Kyrie ain't gonna have that. They will be able to see right through him if he pulls any of his shenanigans. If he thinks he had a tough with the Philly Media then he's in for it. New York is the MEDIA CAPITAL.
Time stamp where u at
Oh God
49:15 Nerves don't grow back. Otherwise there would be no paralyzed people ever.
JJ the damn GOAT
What position do you see Ben playing this year?
People sunglasses inside shouldn’t bother me this much
Thank u JJ for getting my morning started right ! Smart man
Really good interview
Ben came off nice. Good work JJ.
Ben Simmons was calm and collective on his interview
JJ is asking great questions, JJ is the man.
Paused after the intro to come comment before watching the rest… I feel like I’m about to watch the huge season finale of a show or something. The anticipation of it haha
Dude is lost he think trae young weighs 200 lbs 😂😂 at 5’10? That’s why Ben was scared to attempt that layup he saw trae in super saiyan 3 form 😂😂.
This dude so fake 😂
Jump cuts and avoiding the real tough questions, this interview didn't do it for me.
Ben's Stats this year, 15 Pts 12Ast 10Rebs 2.5 Stls 1.5 Blocks ! Book It!
Athletes arent human remember - i think everyone forgets that every now and then
“I just want to win”  If this was true, you would put in the work rather than complain that people don’t respect your game enough.
Seems like they didn’t ask the real questions so they get my click but I’ll save myself an hr and half
LETS GOO
"no one is guarding Kevin..." Boston Celtics is entering the room...
I don’t like this guy
Getting on this podcast is the best thing any player can do for their reputation.
Been waiting for this
Man JJ can save anybody’s career
Breakfast club
I'd bet new media won't ask why he turned to biatch simmons. Or why he doesn't work on his game?
rooting for you ben
Great interview guys . People forget Simmons is a x3 AS
The media bouta chop this interview up
I can’t wait to watch him on the court again
Mans talking about winning yet passed up a dunk.. 🤣
What i noticed just 5 mins in…He cuss a lot in his natural speech…smh mofo just like me 😂😂
J.J clearly have the situation for nba podcasting give this man is flowers
Get Steve nash on
Release the pod at 3am the only way to avoid Jerry West?
Great interview guys can't wait to see 3 Australia born players in and some team and two number 1 picks from Melbourne -o-..
Redemption season or bust
The pod. Is. Back.
Thank you JJ!
The audacity
I almost kinda like him after this. Hope he’s healthy and actually plays this season.
I don’t hate the guy I just hate his laziness and lack of accountability he knew his lack of shooting was a big problem and one of the big reasons teams stop them in the playoffs and he still came back the same player yes he plays defense really well and is a great playmaker but he was given those gifts naturally you have to work on your game and get better at your weaknesses he chose not to and got held accountable for it and instead of stepping up he quit that’s why he gets so much hate and that’s justified
This has to be the TOUGHEST interview ever. U know how sensitive u have to be when rolling off an hour worth of questions to a sensitive human
Watching the first 27 minutes of this interview, it makes me more confident that Ben Simmons is going to make an all-out effort to make the Kevin-Kyrie-Ben Big Three work. It is a little sad that KD made it awkward by demanding Sean Marks and Steve Nash be fired, after he and Uncle Drew already got Kenny Atkinson fired, but what's done is done.  Can't change the past, and it's time to move forward. 💁🏻‍♂️🏀🏆
Great podcast !! Really good to hear from Ben when he isn't being so defensive and can speak just truthfully and freely
Dudes a clown
That BIG SIP of wine Ben took when JJ was getting ready to finally ask about his shooting 😅
Never been so excited to see JJ post probably until the day Giannis is ever here will only match the way I felt 😂😂😂
Great episode. I think I speak for everyone when I say I’m excited for more to come and the start of the season! NBA basketball is so close to being back!
Jj just hit a shot from half court with this one
“I just wanna win. My goal is to win”  Dog we just wanted you to shoot the damn ball every now and then
I don’t like the pre show JJ lol   5min talking about what you talk to Ben about, nah…
No matter what is said he still a scrub.
Overrated
Kevin’s wide open? NOPE! 😂🤣😂🤣
This is a very PC interview but you’re still my guy JJ
I thought JJ only interviewed current NBA players
Where’s JJ? Is he hiding from Jerry West?
missed you JJ!
Kawhi going robot mode is a real thing lmfaoo
Bens MVP season begins
Dude looks happy, hope he has a fantastic season!
Ben is  back 🎉🎉 doing the media run came to JJ first!
Now is the best time for Ben, KD and Kyrie to prove the doubters wrong just like how Golden State did last time. These guys have what it takes to win it all. Good luck !!!!
Tommy is so great in these interviews. I hope Ben crushes it this year, he’s awesome to watch play
JJ went quiet cause he knew the next one had to be big…
22:40 nobody has to guard you. You can’t shoot
Just woke up, rolled up a Phat blunt, now it’s time for the Ben Simmons interview! Cheers from Houston! Mad love JJ
for his career, Ben Simmons shoots 52%FreeThrows in Playoffs...  fax!!!
I kinda always believed that Ben was the DPOY of the 2020-2021 regular season, surely over Rudy Gobert. His defense in that season was hella good! Maybe that award could've been a confidence booster for him and would've allowed him to pursue new things in his game.
It is what it is on what happened to him in the past.  He paid for that financially and it'll probably affect him in the future (possible last max deal for him).  As a pro athlete still in his 20s, Ben has the opportunity to improve and find a home for his game.  His perimeter game is what it is as well.  Wherever he plays, they have to work around that as a team and exploit his strengths.  If his back has recovered and the rest of his body is healthy, its all mental from here on.  On a side note related to all what happened, I got his Philly jersey on 50% off the day of his trade.  Bought Harden's as well with the same discount 😊.
JJ the 🐐 For This!
Thought he interviewed basketball players 🤔
Is that a bottle of Penfolds Bin 98 Quantum? That is made in my home town and is like $500-$700 USD.. Ohhh Australian wine lol.. Good one JJ. Try Adelaide Hills Wines, natural cab sav, trust.
I’m 9mins in and I love the energy y’all got me smiling like I know the feels and relationship y’all got 😂
Let's see what the kid has
ben is gonna be the demar of this season, perfect fit
Someone needs to make a gif of the moment JJ says "let's talk about the ATL series" and camera cuts to wine pouring :D
57:22 what you came for  I think we could do a whole separate interview  of Ben detailing what was true and what wasn't
thank you for this interview, nba fans neeeeeeeeed it
I see the comments fell for the PR lmao
He's going to destroy all the haters this season
Im never used fun and defense in the same sentence 😂😂😂😂😂
THEYRE BACK
Throwing up from pain, I felt that
Great interview. Glad the season is starting again, but happier knowing that there are platforms now for this to exist. Keep up the good work.
Ben has more in common with Westbrook beyond their playstyle. They both project their over inflated ego by insulating themselves from any negative opinions. The problem with this is that it detaches you from reality and makes you lash out at people just trying to help you. ffs westbrook fired his life long agent because SOMEBODY had to tell him last season didn't go so well. It would be nice if Simmons could come back, but let's be honest if he was capable of rapid change he would have done it already. Dude is washed and I don't expect him to play to the level of his pay grade for the remainder of his Nets contract.
I always thought Simmons would be the perfect teammate to Kd and Kyrie
wow Ben is actually a humble and nice dude. I hope you do well this season man!
He didn’t say anything bad about Philly and he has made peace about the past and what he needs to do. Wish him the best and glad to be able to watch him again.
not one question about Joel Embiid, such an L and waste of an hour and sixteen minutes of my life
now i want them to do russ😂
Tapping in from Kenya . Big fan JJ
i cant believe they didnt touch on the "new host" trailer.... that has been one of my fav pieces of content ever
Hearing him talk about having the mentality of a winner seems contradictory
Ngl never doubted Simmons weird watching him ngl
Jj should bring cap and shades on first take while he proves everyone wrong lol
Coming back strong!
Simmons has a very good chance for DPOY
Finally JJ I’ve been itching for a new EP
You can tell jj and him are boys. Ben seemed real comfortable here nice interview
He still a coward
Still unbelievable Nets got swept by Boston. GOd damn disgraceful, if Ben Simmons can bring an ounce of leadership to this team, he'll be a hero to NYC!!!
Love this JJ awesome content.... But still all talk  I want to see all his talking translate on court. Just play show them show results.
JJ you guys gotta add time intervals to your vids!!! That’s the only thing left, you’ve completely everything else perfectly!
Thank you JJ for this
I think this is the first time I've ever heard Ben Simmons voice
You all dropping 6 A.M. is so smart regarding national media being able to talk about your show
Being someone who lost myself mentally I stick beside him cuz I understand these players have actual lives so I always believed him and supported him. Money does not fix your happiness
Lol did jj call trae a roach point guard 🤣🤣
Khawhi went Robot Mode 😂
Get Jerry West on the podcast.
Great interview man , Ben Really Misunderstood he's going to be great this year
This interview alone shows JJ’s ability to not only build long lasting relationships but also bring out the human side of these players. It’s so much easier to ask the difficult questions when theirs mutual respect.
Good luck to him! I'm looking forward to watching him play again. Interesting that Ben does his best not to dump on anybody and keep it positive.
OM3 is back! And with the most coveted interview. Started listening to NBA pods after Dray's legendary post-game 6 of the finals. But the quality of JJs is just elite.
Even if he sits out the entire season, I really think Ben has the best chance at winning Rookie of the Year this season. 🏆 🏆 🏆
Smh. Cornballs.
I think he just wants to win.
So the main highlights I learned from this was:  1.  Rick Bucher completely made up the story about Durant and others in the Nets team chat asking Ben if he was playing and him quitting the chat. (No surprise... Bucher has history) 2.  Ben's mental health had been in decline way before the Atlanta series. 3.  JJ and Ben agreed that he had been thrown under the bus by Embiid and Doc Rivers after the Atlanta series. 4.  Ben wanted to leave when he realised that he had mental health problems he needed to sort out and that certain teammates and those in the team that should have been there to help him did the opposite.  (Didn't name them but we know who they were) 5.  Ben was in LA for 4 months and that nobody from Philly reached out (Even when they were in LA themselves)... but suddenly when they realised he wanted a trade from the 76ers they were suddenly claiming to have jumped on a plane to see him (He claims nobody was on a plane to see him...) 6.  Ben turned up to Philly practice because he felt it was the right thing to do (after trade demand)...and told Doc Rivers before training he didn't feel mentally fit to be out there... but Doc pretty much deliberately put him in straight away against his wishes.  Team was also fining him for any little stupid thing he would do like not lifting a weight... so decided he could no longer be in that environment anymore and had to focus on his mental health. 7.  Admitted he also did some things wrong that he shouldn't have but wouldn't change a thing because its got him to who he is today... which is a much better person.
Good to see ben looking happy and chillin. Funny a lot of people talk smack about him but if I use him on 2k im cheating lol😂
Time to pick up a couple of rookie cards
I love Ben Simmons. Can’t wait to see bro hoop again!!
Looks happy finally .. let's get it 💪
I'm ready to move on from the Ben drama saga - looks like he is too.  Hoping he can bounce back and get to playing ball again at an elite level w/ none of the extra baggage that no one needs.
Lol dude deff ain’t gonna put up 3’s next year either, he’s been saying that for years 😂😂
Philly is literally the worst city in the country, unless you're a heroine/crack addict, then it's Disneyland. (Look it up if you don't believe)
I hope he has a ballin season and shuts up all the haters, rooting for the guy.
His goal is to win but sits out an entire season on a contender in the East ?
Youre still trash ben
Ben blaming everything on mental health is bogus as hell, just own up big fella... withstanding pressure is part of your job. This interview doesn't make him look any better.
KD, Ben, and Kyrie are some of the weirdest dudes. I’m glad they are on a team together. Lol.
FINALLY WERE BACK ….
change my view on Ben for sure
Can’t wait to see Ben on the court for us this season. I think he has so much potential still and has one of the best IQ’s in the league. I know we have had a rough year as nets fans but we really gotta cheer Ben and pray this all works. I hope he continues to work on that shot of his because I have been saying that having him kd and claxton on the floor could be a defensive nightmare for other teams because of the length and speed they all have. Only worry for me and many nets fans is Steve Nash is still here.
Ben, KD, Kyrie & a bunch of great shooters gon be a fun squad watch.
It's nice watching this during my workout!A real great interview and you can see the authenticity
BEN AND KAT ARE CUT FROM THE SAME HANKERCHIEF
Good damnit I've missed this podcast
Oh yeahhhh
Time stamps please
This show never ceases to deliver
Timestamps?
As a pacers fan, thank you jj for calling out their consistent mediocrity 🙄
Wished it worked out in Philly... He still a b***h though
Respect, Ben
I know the missed dunk gets highlighted but it was your lack of aggression during that entire series that fans we're frustrated with.
JJ...You KEEP your pod #1 man. Always must-watch.  Looking forward to another season of insightful interviews. Thanks for this.
He indirectly compliments himself the whole time in this interview..
Timestamps? 🙏
Ben has a real potty mouth.
Good morning everyone 😀
Ben comes across as really likeable in this interview. Lowkey rooting for him. He definitely got overly criticized.
Never really Hurd simmons speak this was a good listen shoutout to JJ for this one
“You were hurt, obviously” - ouch 😂😂
Bout time he showed his face. Good job.    With Kd and kyrrie. They should compliment him well.
Soft interview, lol,,,no hate.
bullish on a Ben Simmons comeback otw
Historical pod
he should of did a nojumper interview
Knowing JJ, he won’t hold back with the questions. This is gonna be good.
u guys are paying him for this episode right? or else he'll sue u guys 🤣🤣🤣
It's no surprise that the most enjoyable basketball that both JJ and Simmons said they had played in that 17 game win streak was because it was the 17 games that Embiid happened to miss through injury.   Quick ball movement and passing is much more enjoyable and successful than watching Embiid pound the ball for 15 seconds every shot clock.
Great episode, gained more respect and hype to  see Ben play
And I had just woke up for the morning deuce - this seems long enough to last while I handle that.
My best mate growing up moved to America & eventually got his American accent but his Australian accent always comes out when drunk…. Also Bens father played for my local NBL team too.
JJ media 🐐
Jj how’s the plumbing business
big ups to ben for this
Ngl I’m 15 mins in and I’m already a Ben fan. Appreciate you guys giving us this look into players.
Ben "BS" Simmons
Jj this is big man 🔥🔥🔥
Glad to have you back, but I am going to be honest. This was one of your weaker interviews and felt more like a PR talk than a natural conversation. Ben calling himself a "winner" all the time was just weird. Wish the dude the best and a successful comeback, but this interview felt unnatural
Here before the chaos 😂 who’s with me
No excuses Ben 10! Soft
A hour in and realizing they aren’t asking the real questions we want answered. Why sis you quit on the Sixers? Why don’t your shoot?
The whole ESPN analyst should take note on how to ask questions and run the show like JJ doing so far.
Blicky got the stiffy huh
I was like so excited for this episode just hear Ben out. I feel like he’s really going to have a bounce back season with KD and Kyrie really and have a better mental approach.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLAYER!
Ben seems like he’s in a good mental state. All the best with the Nets
The Ben Simmons Redemption Arc begins
It has been a long time since I have seen Ben smile
Ben Simmons is really showing how up himself he is... "game is easy for me" attitude. Just goes to show he's not willing to put the work in to get better.
lemme see if this mans gonna annoy me cuz he been annoying me for 3 years now…
Sixers fan will never be happy
97.5 the fanatic brought me here
I guess it’s time to focus. On the nba again
If Ben Simmons had the opportunity to be coached by Jason Kidd, I truly believe Simmons would have had a better path in dealing with all the narrative surrounding him re: shooting. The media narrative around Simmons’ shooting is very similar to a young JKidd.
Philly management and the media messed with Ben’s head. Shouldn’t have affected him as a pro but he is a human being.
I can’t wait to hear what Spike and Mike think about this interview 😂
JWill a real one for that
Congrats J.J. for always having Ben's back and never going against him ever in that whole drama, what a great vet and a good friend!
Never thought I'd actually hear from Ben Simmons in this manner! Kinda just accepted that us regular people will never know what he truly thought about the 76ers situation!
Great interview guys , go get it this year Ben and F the haters . Revenge is sweet 👊🏻
Now this is a great way to start the day
Damn, Honestly Thought I wouldn’t like Ben 😂😂 Bruh Seem Cool Af Tho. Good To Know he Playing This season Too
I wish Ben the best. He was picked 1st overall so whenever he made any mistake people were quick to attack him. With all the hype around him calming down he could focus on his game in a more healthier manner. I’m not giving up on Ben cause at the end of the day he is 6 foot 10 and with access to world class training facilities even if he can’t shoot 3’s he can still excel in the other categories(assists, rebounds, blocks,).
Great to finally hear from Ben himself. When you let him speak he's got a good outlook on everything thats happened, he's only human.
Love to Ben, I hope you have an amazing season
Rooting for Ben. Wanna see this guy win.
It's a shame his antics over the past 18 months has overshadowed how talented he is especially defensively. Probably top 5 defensive player in the league.
This gon be an all time great and I ain't even watch this yet... 10k views in an hour and it's only 7 am my time... Sheesh.. i guess we do care what ben has to say... Goat interview
Thank you for humanizing players JJ🙏🏾
Still holding my save the cat sign, cheering a missed free throw-rooting you on. Cmon Ben we are with you… (thanks dude)
Welcome back jj n tommy🙂
“A different between just guys who go out and put up numbers and winners” coming from the guy who tries his hardest just to get numbers and is it a winner.
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeee
My favorite NBA player!!!! I'm excited to listen!
We don't need you to shoot 5 three's a game Ben but if you had a jumper it would help the spacing on the floor and make your teammates better. Ben you clearly had the yips and your pathological inability to talk about doesn't help them. As a sixers fan Thank you for the great years of basketball, I wish you well. But brother look in the mirror.
I remember them being up 38 in the preseason going into halftime and he launched a 3 and cashed it…almost a statement that he was gonna be shooting them it looked real fluid.. and he refused to shoot ‘em regular season…it definitely messed with him
There’s still no accountability from Ben, just excuses, it wasn’t just one play, it was 7 games and he fouled out on purpose in game 7.
Great interview. Hopefully Ben grows both as a player & a man from all negativity he's experienced in which he caused.
He’s gonna shoot %45 from 3 this season
Here before all the bitter Sixers fans crowd the comments.  Good luck this season. 👍🏾
Luka got more talent in his left pinky toe than benjiman simmons has in his whole body
44:00 Philly vs nets just got more exciting
Ben giving mid answers lmao jj ain’t really get on him enough for me
Seems like a solid dude, hope he regains his confidence in Brooklyn! Should be a good situation where he can focus on doing what he's best at & let KD & Kyrie do what they do best. We'll see how it plays out!
simmosn get his teeth fixed? ii dont remember him looking like this or am i tripping?
Here before this blows tf up
Id give this man two thumbs down if I could
Philly time stamp?
Which wine are they drinking?
been waiting for this😫😫
Miss Ben on the sixers.
The Boy’s are back🎉🎉🎉
He needs to go to a team like the heat
Jj thank you for these pods they keep me sane. Old man & the three is a 🐐 podcast
the goat is back LETS GOOO
Tommy's posture bruh
Ben's idea of "basketball" doesn't equal to winning. He's had amazing teams and they do not go anywhere. All professionals in any field are expected to be masters of their craft, all I hear is petulance and no accountability.
You’re right Ben, jj was a winner. And you are a winer. No one to blame about how things turned out but you. Until you take responsibility for yourself nothing will change. Not rooting against you just wish you had handled things more maturely last year
Who woke up early? 😂 lezzzgooowww
Oh boy
This interview made me gain alot of respect back for ben hope he balls out this year for the nets
The most safest interviewer he could have done,... So soft and scared to answer the real questions
I am so proud of Ben for agreeing to do a long form sit down interview. knowing Ben and the anxiety & stress that he goes through, agreeing and following through with this interview would have been difficult.   Part of the reason why the narrative around Ben is so toxic is because he never talks. Ben is not a bad person, or someone that doesn't care about basketball -  In fact the opposite is true.  Ben just doesn't have the life skills to deal with the difficult challenges that one faces as a high profile professional athlete.   if there is any advice that Ben should take on for the next stage of his career and life is to continue to do things outside of his comfort zone. Refraining from shooting is Ben wanting to stay in his comfort zone. Avoiding long form interviews is also part of his comfort zone. This is a good first step of hopefully many more.
I’m hoping for his sake that he has a redemption arc this season. He’s in an ideal situation so he has no excuses.
Damn...he showed up for once!
Good morning y’all. Perfect way to start our day getting ready for work/school!
As a sixers fan we didn’t care that he didn’t shoot we just wanted him to be more aggressive
Wow
Get Lebron on the pod
Great get JJ . Really looking forward to hearing Ben finally talk about his time in Philly !!
in time for my morning drive, appreciate y’all for that!
I'll be surprised if this podcast is good, all of JJ's talent for interviews can not make Simmons interesting
"Mental health" lol
I just want Ben  to win soooo bad !! The amount of hate he get is ridiculous
gaming
Simmons might be in a great spot right now in the nets, got him surrounded with shooters and KD. We’ll see if they don’t implode like last season
I never knew JJ Redick made others better :D  "I'd rather be who I am than not being on the court" - Well you haven't been on the court for 2 years  You didn't care about the money but you sued them to try to get your money for not going to work haha! The guy has an excuse for everything.  The interviewers were soft and didn't give ask and any hard questions . What a waste!
The comments are going to be sooo savage. I hope Ben has learned that his followers on his instagram want to see him working in the gym for the game of basketball. For awhile it was all Ferrari’s n models basically the things that the game has done for him. Posting that stuff would be fine if we actually saw growth in his game since lsu. Ben gave up on lsu and the sixers, some ppl aren’t team players. I got mad respect for Ben but let’s just be honest you love what basketball provides but Ben is not a true hooper if he was you would see more growth. Less Ferraris more basketball oh and the video games omg
i just want to see this man play
Ben Simmons has more Call of Duty minutes played than in the NBA   ▪ COD: 9,784 ▪ NBA: 9,326
There are plumbers, there are fireman and there is Ben Simmons.
It’s 3:44 am man wtf
Time for excuses and lies lol

Nice and early 🤠
This is going to be your most viewed interview JJ good work
Early
This reminded when he put 42 on Gobert’s head. #enjoy basketball
Birdie to close out the 18th.. JJ knows money 👌🏽😂
Good luck Mr Ben

The `fuckn` coming out. Strayaa stand up!
I want to hear Philly fans opinion on this interview!!!!
My guy Ben man still my favorite player idc
First
Ben we all know you will never find peace until you resign in Philly, come full circle, and win some chips.
This is hard to watch because it was all sucking up to Ben. Ben was harder on himself then both. It was all soft balls after soft balls geez….
DO NOT TRY TO MAKE THAT NIGGA A SYMPATHETIC FIGURE!!! Get better weakass 😡
Ben going to have a crazy season 🔥💪🏾
This guy severely lacks self-awareness! His smug demeanour & arrogance will obviously be his downfall, since he clearly has a short memory
So what are you going to say about the Jerry West situation?
I just started watching. This should be the best off season interview this year. Maybe all time
1:08:15 and 59:20, JJ covering all the comment section in 2 moments
Niceeee!!! Much love from China
Starts at 5:21
Ben Simmons has female tendencies. He's addicted to social media, never takes accountability, and he lies all the time. Never trust a man who acts like a woman.
7:40 basically shows how often and how easy it is for players to play together
Ben Simmons has no clue they went on a 16 game win streak does he? Lol
That's a great comeback
It's 3 in the morning but idgaf jjs back!!!
Man does one interview and all of the sudden is all love 😂.
Ben thinks he’s above everyone else goofy dude
Ben gon shine next year
Timestamps?
Can’t wait to hear this one.
New sponsor: pizza boxes.
Nice to see JJ diversify and bring people outside of basketball
Meanwhile this guys being paid to do nothing 😅
Ahhh the most fined player I’m the NBA
I’m tired of hearing media drama on players. I just wanna see them play
This is the most I’ve heard Ben speak
this is what gen z calls THE TEA
I was waiting for this
positive energy your way Ben. Love this Ben is a real one
Thank god im an insomniac
"im a winner" said Ben Simmons 🤡🤡🤡
What a waste of a podcast. I understand JJ doesn’t want to rock the boat too hard because people won’t want to come on if he did that but this is just a sympathy show that does nothing more than stroke bens ego. Signing off from newcastle, Australia, where ben is from just fyi.
JJ the Goat
The amount of coddling this man gets is insane. 6 years in and he's a worse free throw shooter than Shaq and Wilt.
🍿🍿🍿
I hope Ben Simmons does well in retirement prayers for that brother .he deserves to be happy outside of basketball .
Didn't expect to see Ben on a podcast, like ever lol. JJ a goat
No matter how useless you feel, just remember Ben Simmons wears a shooting sleeve every single game…
Some say till this day Ben Simmons is still scared to shoot.
Getting ready for work and listening to this ... morning can't get better
Yessir! The episode we been waiting for. Bright & Early!
Can't believe we're finally gonna hear Simmons' side of the story
Please, please please. KD, Kyrie, and Simmons all have reasons to want the league crushed. I am absolutely here for it.   Um, what did Steve Nash do this summer? Hopefully he crammed basic coaching every damn day. Because he's trash. Friend of the GM, is why he's there. Why wait? Fire him now.
I'm early af interested in seeing what Ben's got to say 🤔
BEEN WAITING ON THIS POD TO GET BACK ROLLING ENTERTAINING AND INFORMATIVE PERFECT PODCAST KEEP GOING PLEASE🩸🔥🔥
