Kung Fu Panda (2008)  Kung Fu Panda is a 2008 animated film produced by DreamWorks Animation that follows Po, an enthusiastic panda who works in his father’s noodle shop but dreams of becoming a kung fu master. When Master Oogway unexpectedly chooses him as the Dragon Warrior, everyone is shocked—especially Po. Master Shifu and the Furious Five doubt him because he has no formal training and often struggles during practice. Meanwhile, the powerful snow leopard Tai Lung escapes from prison and returns to the Valley of Peace to claim the Dragon Scroll, which is believed to hold the secret to ultimate power.  As Po begins his training, he experiences many failures and embarrassing moments, but he refuses to give up. Master Shifu eventually realizes that Po’s love for food and his playful personality can be turned into strengths. Using creative methods, Shifu trains Po in a way that suits him, allowing Po to improve with his own unique style. When Po finally receives the Dragon Scroll, he discovers that it appears blank and only reflects his face. This reveals the film’s central message: there is no secret ingredient—you are the secret. Real strength comes from accepting who you are and believing in yourself.  Overall, Kung Fu Panda is more than just a funny animated movie. It explores themes of self-belief, identity, and destiny. Po begins the story thinking he is not good enough, but by the end, he proves that his uniqueness is exactly what makes him a true hero. His determination, creativity, and heart help him defeat Tai Lung and protect the valley. For students, the film offers an inspiring lesson: anyone can achieve greatness if they work hard, stay true to themselves, and have the courage to believe they are enough.

Kung fu panda 2 recap
Whoever holds this scroll is gay😂
The animation is zany, but the surroundings are seriously beautiful. Oogway be doing that weird squeaking(?) at 1:49, and the foreground has all this gorgeous color and detail in the rock and tree, with the stylized petals even shaking more intensely the moment Oogway disappears, while the sky has a smooth organic gradient. The contrast of texture between sky and rock sells the distance of the background in a way that physical painting would have trouble doing. Truly a great example of quality digital art
wow noice animation

1:48 a
どこまでも続くような青の季節は 四つ並ぶ眼の前を遮るものは何もない アスファルト 蝉時雨を反射して きみという沈黙が聞こえなくなる この日々が色褪せる 僕と違うきみの匂いを知ってしまっても 置き忘れてきた永遠の底に 今でも青が棲んでいる 今でも青は澄んでいる どんな祈りも言葉も 近づけるのに 届かなかった まるで 静かな恋のような 頬を伝った夏のような色のなか きみを呪う言葉がずっと喉の奥につかえてる 「また会えるよね」って 声にならない声 昼下がり じめつく風の季節は 想い馳せる まだ何者でもなかった僕らの肖像 何もかも分かち合えたはずだった あの日から少しずつ きみと違う僕という呪いが肥(ふと)っていく きみの笑顔の奥の憂いを (憂いを) 見落としたこと 悔やみ尽くして 徒花(あだばな)と咲いて散っていくきみに さよなら 今でも青が棲んでいる 今でも青は澄んでいる どんな祈りも言葉も 近づけるのに 届かなかった まるで 静かな恋のような 頬を伝った夏のような色のなか きみを呪う言葉がずっと喉の奥につかえてる 「また会えるよね」って 声にならない声 無限に膨張する銀河の星の粒のように 指の隙間を零れた

After witnessing the recoil on that thing, it's no wonder Tai Lung woke up
ffbb
Bro going up the stairs is how I breathe when rolling outta bed
If you reduce the speed of the video by 0.5x at minute 1:08 the scene becomes more epic, Po's scream when he gets kicked in that place after saying the beautiful phrase "hello young lady" but as if it were in slow motion, makes this scene so emotional that it makes the "Mclovin" scene in Superbad cry in the shower        I'm Brazilian, and I dream of being a great film director 🎥
You olso put hamud😂

- i don't know why, but I laughed from the moment where Master Oogway died.
- 3:43 тhe ending music didn’t have to be this awesome, but honestly it is.
- тhanks for the memories and also thanks to make Tai Lung a litteral block!
- 1:47 literally the most saddest death.
- аs funny as this cartoon was, we can all agree that the кung Fu Panda franchise was pretty freaking good!
- нearing the tortoise's mating sound sent my sides into a black hole, that and the freaking goose had me on the floor, that was hilarious.

♿😂😂🤣🤣😅😘😏🙄😶😑😐
0:54
Well well well
My my my
Lol didnt know u have a music box
You know, a panda style of kungfu could easily be created. Using superior strength and size, to throw around your weight with hefty grapples, throws, and pins while deflecting and rolling hits to reduce damage.   Basically a fat drunken boxing.
kskskks manooo
Pls do Kung fu panda 3
Po: Hello, young lady The Furious Five: *Peace was never an option.*
lol is that delay lama at the credits?
1:09 hello young lady (hit) OOOO
I really want a full version of the ending credits song, that unironically sounds good.
delay lama kunf fu fighting is the ending song
"not for kids" jokes on you I'm still a kid and i dont even care about violent
1:30 xd
That “monkey” from Oogway really spoke words to me.
i hear the delay lama in that ending and its beautiful
.
I CANT STOP LAUGHING😭 3:00
Would you consider doing PRIMAL?  I know part of the joke is these are kids movies, but Primal has so much weird and amazing stuff in it too.
The turtle moan killed me XD
The cover of kung fu fighting at the end actually kinda slaps not gonna lie
Bro the part where they kissed i y was spechless.
1:08
1:50   ajaj   xD
Do you guys remember angry bird? This cartoon reminds me
what app do you use?
1:02 3:25 I'm sorry what?
The scroll has an Arabic video 😂
.
.___________________________________.

0:23 YOOOO I REMEMBER THAT GAME
1:47 The most remarkable words said by Oogway.
2:50-2:56 That Hamuood Habidi made me burst out of laughter. It reminds me of a Rickroll.
1:47 *P A I N*
1:08
1:01
What's the reference at 3:25?
1:20

monke
I died at the Rhino clapping his ass cheeks.
This video cured my depressiob
1:30 Minecraft twerking
The goose was a stroke of brilliance.  I'm a little bit stuck on the skadoosh finger since Tai didn't die for realz. Banished into the spirit realm more accurately. But that's just a nitpick.  Overall good video.
why you gotta do oogway like that man
1:24 got me rolling🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:26 wtf is this
The fact that the animation was so incredibly smooth helped me roll with laughter even harder because it was just one after another hitting me clean and busting my gut up.
3:13 wtf

1:09 lmfao
Is the outro an actual song?
🤣🤣🤣
The fact that Po’s dad is the Untitled Goose is amazing
Untitled goose game
Okay this is a little too accurate..
It may be a recap but I still feel inclined to ask; What the f*** just happened?
This is seriously the first time ass clapping has ever made me luagh... cuz its an actual tuant and insult but animated so goofy and well.
I love the part when the panda made out with the villain
mmm.... *Monkey*
The 3D effects on this video are the icing on the cake, extraordinary
3:13 ok that one left me speechless...
:D make one about five niths at freddys!! your animations are cool
2:28 Weeping angels in Doctor Who be like...

1:23
1:08
the outro song is bussin
1:08))))
heloww yang ledi
Maybe add the "not made for kids" sign before starting the video, not when you shot someone. But if you did place a warning before the video I deeply apologize for not noticing
Sus
I loved the untitled goose game part
Imagine fighting a full netherite armored player with thorns on it Hahahahahah
I love how the white tiger just one punched a whole squad.
3:13 eyy yo 🤨📸
Was that a Delay Lama piece at the end there?
As funny as this cartoon was, we can all agree that the Kung Fu Panda franchise was pretty freaking good!
3:14 *wth* 💀😳
Where can I listen to that credits theme? Shit is hilarious.

I like kung fu panda  spongebob and regular show :)
The thing is, no matter how hard Tai Lung tried, he just couldn’t hurt Po. Then Po simply bounced back after a super punch from Tai Lung and punched him straight through a wall, which Tai Kung miraculously survived
1:46
bro the dudesons minecraft thing had me dyinggg
🍲🍙🍘🥠🥡🍜🍢🍣🍚🥡🍥🍝🥢
The only reason Kung Fu panda works is that Tai Lung is slower than birds

Personal favs: 0:20-0:58 - Goose, the ways he runs, and monke 1:21 - just watch it 1:47 - Gets funnier with the context, that it's turtle mating sound. 2:51 - If you know the meme 3:37 - hue hue

Why is That outro so fire
It's really not for anyone John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God./Inspiration+ The only way a man can enter the kingdom of God is through becoming born again. How is one born again? Through receiving salvation by accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. There is no action outside of salvation that can save a man. Salvation through Jesus Christ is the only way./Prayer+Dear God, I thank you providing us with such a sure and secure way of becoming born again – through your son, Jesus Christ. Thank you, Father, for making this process so simple for us. I know how much we don't deserve your kindness but still, you have given it to us so freely. Thank you, Lord. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.

Japanese culture be like
3 weeks ago 11k comments, and we have another one of the classic ca van de pol animations. Ok idk why I thought I could come up with a creative comment. Anyway. These animations really don't look like something you'd see nowdays. Theyre so good. The comedic stuff is really creative and kinda cool. The actual recapping seems like an actual person who watched the stuff and knows what the thing is about is making them, it actually captures whats important. Also, the people who didn't watch still can watch and still not actually get spoiled on the way everything is. Awesome stuff.   Also, a thing I wanted to comment for quite some time: a Matrix one could be cool.     Hi future me rewatching and reading comments.
The one we got was a fake this is the original one

What is he doing?
Matthew 25:31-46 New International Version The Sheep and the Goats 31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.  34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’  37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’  40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’  41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’  44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’  45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’  46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
The Greatest Commandment 28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”  29 “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.[e] 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[f] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[g] There is no commandment greater than these.”  32 “Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”  34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.

Ephesians 6:10-18 New International Version The Armor of God 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.
Acts 2:17-21 New International Version 17 “‘In the last days, God says,     I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy,     your young men will see visions,     your old men will dream dreams. 18 Even on my servants, both men and women,     I will pour out my Spirit in those days,     and they will prophesy. 19 I will show wonders in the heavens above     and signs on the earth below,     blood and fire and billows of smoke. 20 The sun will be turned to darkness     and the moon to blood     before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. 21 And everyone who calls     on the name of the Lord will be saved.’[a]
Romans 1:25 New International Version 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
that was amzing

The problem is that I have a friend that is like the Pooh of this video(I'm not joking, the facial expressions and the way he run are exactly like him).

La tortuga en vez de venirse se fue :v
2:52 Hamood Hamood!
0:54    I'm so confused at this part. The point is he used a Master Oogway meme clip "monkey" but he's pointing at Po to be the Dragon Warrior, but he said Monkey when Monkey was right there, so was there an accident that Master Oogway was wanting Po to be the Dragon warrior but accidentally addressed him as Monkey, or was he wanting to point at Monkey but couldnt because on his limited motion that only limits to point a Po, only to mislead people that Po would be the Dragon Warrior when Monkey was supposed to?  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!
"Bla... Bla bla... Bla bla... Bla bla..." is my favorite part

We solved the main problem Po is skinny!
Hey Cas! Listen, I'm slowly becoming a content creator and I'm just trying to understand the whole copyright thing. You had a distorted version of that Rocky song, but it was removed because why? For a video I made, I have three whole songs which don't belong to me but I didn't get copyrighted. Do you know how it works? Does anyone know? Thanks! Also, what does 3:26 reference?
the untitled goose thing is genius
Kung Fu Panda was my favourite movie to watch when I was young so seeing this made me die of laughter
3:35 Dying in Terraria be like:

Gdi, they did it again. Cas was forced to overwrite the music training sequence.  Why do these companies care so much about a single 10 second section of their shitty song being distorted?

This one's real funny 1:46
I cant believe you had to remove the off brand shitty cover of the rocky theme because of copyright
Жаль, что на тренировках панды предъявили авторские права за музыку.
Я гусь, во всех анимациях снимусь
The backgrounds and smooth animations are insane!! This is movie quality
NOOOOOOOO THEY REMOVED THE SOUNDTRACK AT THE TRAINING SCENE.

Wait they changed the song on the scene where po and shifu was training..
What is that 3:15

Yo Cas I have an idea for your next video you might like wanna hear it?
I love the fact that he used Delay Lama VST for the outro LOL
Melhor canal que conheci
This is your best work so far I loled so much
So what's very bizarre and kind of upsetting is that when this came out the audio for when master Shifu is training Po was a warped Rocky theme and when Shifu is smacking Po with the wooden paddle you would hear the sound from it...I'm going to assume YouTube must've told the creator of this something right ? I fucking swear YouTube is such trash now
I'm so glad oogway chose monkey to be the dragon warrior
Honestly I almost shat my pants this is so cute
Hamood~
She gay
why did he change the music in the training part?
Ss uuuuu ss uuuuuu ssssss UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

Unfortunately, there are a lot of clips that indicate p*orn and this is not funny 👎🏻
He really got copyrighted from a distorted Rocky theme. What happened to Youtube?

The funniest thing is Master oggway point Po but the name he call is MONKEY. Hahaha Nc recap hahaha
We ignored 2:51

I missed when the training montage had the Rocky theme.
He changed the training music
Hi
That smug-a** look on his face as he f*cking erases Tai Lung
I swear the audio changed for the training scene, I've recently watched this a dozen times and now watching it once more, I noticed the music changed during the training scene?? Am I correct?? did anyone else notice??
Genius
master tigress is so cute!!!
00:28 2:07 3:01
Perfeito/ perfect
At 3:14 it messed me up
PK XD
RaaaAaaaaaaahogi 60 seconds
So starting from 1:56 that training music scene,  I noticed the sound effects duing the music are gone ( from panda ). Was there some reason it got removed? or was the music to close to the rocky theme and needed to be changed? either way its funny but was wondering the change.
1:59 F Music 😔👌

The off brand Eye of the Tiger was so on point!
3:26 is this part a reference to something?

Cas changed the music of Po's training section, or It was just my impression?

wgy did they change the music
F*cking hamood how the hell did he appear in this video?
NoOoOo the Rocky music 😭
Say the line, Oogway! Oogway: MMmh, Monke
You got copyrighted for the music right?
Wondering why did I waste 90 mins on original
Jack black bowser
@ 2:02, did the Rocky music get copyrighted??
CAn anyone tell me what this sound is @ 1:01? I recognize it
what happened to the original where there's sound in the training
Forget my Kung Fu Panda video. This is what the Kung Fu Panda fandom truly needs.
Who remembers the rocky music?
Hey the music changed
F.cking copyright

The rhino
RIP Distorted Rocky Theme  2021-2021
If someone makes a pin of shifu and oogway as he dies, I would buy them in a heartbeat. Is that weird?
the way he runs up the stairs
This is my third time watching I just now noticed mantis you made him so small
1:58  Not even 5 days and copyright already hit Glad i saw it before: that distorted version of Rocky was gold
YouTube must really enjoy torturing Cas Van de Pol by forcing him to either recreate his videos or replace clips of his animation. YouTube just sucks 🐴. Susan may have made a lot of money for YouTube, but its no excuse when she sucks at keeping YouTube mainstream as before!!
1:46 it’s so sad
Are we gonna get each kung fu panda movie like this
real struggle to find mantis
Palabra invariable que modifica a un verbo, a un adjetivo, a otro adverbio o a todo un período; pueden indicar lugar, tiempo, modo, cantidad

Wait but the outro music,!
You should do Back To The Future
😂
I love how Cas literally has to spell out the phrase 'not made for kids' in splattered blood to make YouTube understand.   If only there was an option you could check to tell YouTube your video isn't made for kids.
Master Oogway is a mad lad in this despite rarely appearing in this cartoon.
I like KungFuPanda very much. This piece has a great detailed story, which I can't reproduce in this video alone. Master Oogway's drawing is very similar to this one. Please make videos of 2 and 3 as well.
part 2 and 3 more pls
love how he cursed the music in order not to get copyright claimed
Its so funny from the start because how he climbed up the stairs he went like (>=<) up the stairs XD
3:26 I NEED to know where this originated.
You're actually pretty good at animating a funny fight scene.
The use of Delay Lama in the end credits is on par with Timmy Trumpet’s ‘Freaks’

i would have loved ti lung as po's controversial love interest  in the sequels
1:23 yeah I was kinda expecting tai lung (or whatever his name was)  to uppercut his titanium rhino cheeks to the sky but instead I have to watch that ass clap three different times 💀
0:54 Oogway: M O N K E Monke: Wat? -_-
Cute viper
Okay, I was almost about to dislike video until I saw this hilarious scene of dying Oogway. That instantly changed it to like.

The Rhino tweaking actually got me cackling haha.

1:46 He came then turned into petals, saddest shit Ive seen
“Hello young lady!” *proceeds to get beat up a two frames later*
1:09
Hamood 😂😂😂

Heyo! I’m quite sorry to ask, but the scene where Po walks through all the boxes and smashes everything, does anyone know the name of the music that plays in the background?
3:26 dafuq is this

Mating sounds or not, I still teared up when Oogway ascended
Can’t believe that you didn’t use a stick bug reference.
Me at young age: "cool film" Me at 9: "cringe" Me looking at this: *I feel both ways*
Great as always. And that intro is made from dreams and nightmares

Most people are talking about either Oogway's "Monke" or his mating sound. Some talking about the dad being the Goose from the goose game. Others with how relatable Po not being able to run up the stairs is. ...  I am talking about that Minecraft in Real Life Prank throwback at 1:08

Cool cartoons 😍
Absolutely love this animation, that Tai Lung sprite is just - perfect 🤣
Can you do tim Burton's nightmare before Christmas ultimate recap?
Yeah basically
Lol
When you hear Po's "boing" sound effect being repeated EVERY time in the movie, you cannot unhear it. It's like a tired sound man just copy-pasted it all over the place.
1:39 Gunter?
Wow
1:35 love that part.
The ultimate shrek recap cartoon
Best and funniest one yet!
1:48 En lugar de venirse, se fue
Those character designs are my favorite from your videos. You can always tell who they are but they're always fitting so good in your style. I love that so much 😫
I’m pretty nostalgic for this movie. So you have to understand when I say that this is exactly how I remember it.
honestly those songs slap
I feel like it's gonna be a running gag with Cas and occasionally making something gory just as a clear indicator that the animations doesn't make him a kids channel
Where's the compilation of Cas going "BEEEEEEEH"?
Is there context for this?  3:25
Every one of these recaps are like remembering a movie during a cheese induced fever dream. ....and i love every second of it
Goose Game goose is best goose
But I don’t like Kung fuu panda
I fucking can't
3:43 OMG DELAY LAMAAAAAAAAAAAAA
What is 3:26 from I need to know
3:25 What the hell is this referencing?
For some reason Po's animation reminded me to those old Bunny Kill animation
All the other school kids after running a mile in PE class:  ...  Me with my Asthma trying to not die: 1:47
Do animation penguin of madascar
This is the right level of not made for kids, enough to stop coppa while not making a really excessive amount of uncomfortable 18+ things.
Pasado de burger
I would definitely pay for the entire ending song starting at 3:43 - 4:04, because there has got to more than 1m 42s. Ya got me hooked darn you
2:51

The end credits song was actually bangin. Can someone help me find that remix?

Always a treat when the Delay Lama makes a surprise visit in those credits. Boppin'!
1:49 The mating call (or something) in oogway's death was kinda funny when it was long

Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Al guíen de aquí es de México

1:47 cooms and dies

Tai Lung looks like he came straight out of Kayne’s I Love It music video

Oh god the master Oogways Ascension makes me cry any version
hamooooooooooooooooooooood
Cas: “Not made for kids” Literally kids these days: 3:40
*.........yeah*
1:34 3:02
The way that Oogway ascended into the afterlife is exactly how I wanna die
“All I ever did, I did, to make you proud, tell me how proud you are Shifu, tell me!!!”  — Tai Lung
This is my favorite one of these so far. The twerking rhino will not leave my head
I both love and hate that you have to animate someone’s brains getting blown out at the beginning of every anim just to tell YT “hey don’t let kids watch this”
Surely, I can't be the only one who found Monkey's shocked expressions funny! What a sight gag! {=👁⚫👁=}
._.
PO looks sans at the last part
1:02. TVs at bowling alleys when you hit a strike.
3:03 THINK SHIFU THINK!
Every frame is litreally an art piece i can hang on the wall, i really love your style cas keep it up
1:08 made my lungs collapse the entire scene is perfect
Did u rly just slip in "Can you feel the love tonight" at that moment? xD
Omfg when master shifu got smashed into the floor i just had to save this video in my favorites
the chunky in po is the real deal bois.
I like how Po and Tai lung randomly start making out during the fight
Tropa que veio depois do tik tok?
1:23 I have the feeling that the same thing will happen to this scene as that of Mort of Madagascar
Exactly as i remember

This confirms Ping would've mopped the floor with Tai Lung
3:26 reference here?
The fact that you make the protagonists incredibly stupid, and nobody’s talking about po’s climbing noises
We need the sequels now.

Po

Hamood was uncalled for
Kkkk 2:52
1:00 that sweet Really3d music
I will be like in the background screaming beat each outher you giant fat muscled worries
Everyone! In 2019, there was a show called the Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. A prequel series based off of a 1982 movie called The Dark Crystal. A dark puppet series set in a world of Thra, where the Gelfling find out the truth of the Crystal and the Skeksis rulers and begin a rebellion. This show was everything, amazing fantasy, great worldbuilding, good score, great characters, etc. Then Netflix cancelled it. I know Covid made things harder for companies but this show doesn't deserve the fate it got. Jim Henson would've been proud of this series. So tell everyone about this show, show this comment, anything. Let's convince Netflix to bring it back or sell it to a company who will. #ForThra #SaveDarkCrystal
Monke
I didn’t expect the shotgun 😱

The references on this particular recap cartoon were enough to make me want to rediscover the true meaning of love.

There are a lot of comments about Oogway's mating noise and I'm wondering if I'm the oddball for not knowing what tortoise sex sounds like offhand.
This is so freaking funny words alone can not describe how much i love this

Totally made for kids because is so funny
Shifu fucking died
3:43 - is that Delay Lama VST singing Kung Fu fighting??? LMAO
I’m surprised that Cas didn’t take advantage of the scene where Tai Lung’s face is literally engulfed by Po’s asscheeks

You should make your own animation that is not a recreation but an original animation
im really impressed with Po's Big the Cat impression at the end
3:34 I legit think this is what actually happened.
I don't know how its done but every single cartoon is funnier than the last and leaves me surprised. Untitled goose game? Genius. Rhino clapping cheeks? Hilarious? The final fight scene belongs in a museum. It's all so good.
*Monki*

The end song is the best!!
How did you do Po's dad? That's the real duck model from the game, right?
🐢😭😭😭😭😭
I don't know why, but I laughed from the moment where Master Oogway died.
Nedt can you mack a toy Story one plz
But where is: Simba?
2:25 The final test 😂
This is the kind of video that is funny but ruins your childhood
Outside of a joke, it is very well animated. it feels too fluent.

Po's dad as the untitled goose is just 😌👌
Wait, is Coppa still a thing you have to worry about on Youtube?

Shooting someone in the face with a shotgun should be enough to say its not for kids
The way how Rhino was shaking his butt is beyond funny for me

The twerkin part tho
why is the rhino caked up though?
Fung Ku Panda
I feel that he went a bit of an extreme, in humor, to make sure that IT"S NOT FOR KIDS. But the problem with this humor is the same as with previous "Mort Feet Scene". A bit too much to handle.
“There are no accidents” as Master Oogway said before he turned into flower pedals
Raimundo Raimundo não sei oque Raimundo

Me seeing the notification: "Oh, I hope he'll make Po really fat- AHWW YEAHH BOI!"
I DID NOT EXPECT HAMOOD HABIBI HAMOOD
The fact that I watched this and then I saw a FRIKIN Po toy Infront of me!?!
I've watched every single one of the recaps so far, including the king Julien feet scene.... Somehow this was more disturbing
Ultra Instinct Shaggy is canon https://youtu.be/Ptm1Rnx_FsE
What happened to the Madagascar one ? I was about to watch it.
😮😮😮+9000 Social Credits 😮😮😮
I love the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, but the scene where Po and His goose dad talk about how Po was found always gets me 😢❤️
1:48 EaahhiiiAhhsSsS 👹👹👹👺👺👹👹
3:13 ayo what
I just noticed that the video border color is the same shade of desktop youtube's dark mode, and I presume same goes for the other ultimate recaps for both dark and light modes. It's so underappreciated, the vid's borders look so seamless and epic because of it
Its a good day when Cas uploads
I love this so much, it's just perfect
2:21 sus
Hamood
2:52 حمود حبيبي حمود حمود حبيبي

KUNG FU PANDA 2 AND 3 WOULD BE AWESOME  CANT WAIT...
Good

Looks like you and meatcanyon or friends
My childhood is ruined
All of that for Hamood
If wide Po had wide Putin's song this would make my day
Maybe even your best work yet! I absolutely love this!
We need more lol
Actually Art.
The ending made with Delay Lama perfection.
I like how the Furious Five just jumped my boy Po like that.  It was really like that in the movie. Even Shifu kicked him down the stairs.
When he walked through the hall and broke everything I died laughing
This is the best recap ever! Completely captures the whole movie! ❤
I hate how i instantly recognised delay lama
"I wonder if there will be a reference to Lion King Recap. Maybe even a 'SIMBA.'"  3:13  "Oh my..."
....I can’t decide if I love it or I hate it
Yea
Damm have i missed these
wow i love the song
1:24 What the fuck-
Hello darth vader 😤🤕
😂🤣
Tri monsters versus aliens
3:34 I love that this is what actually happened in the movie but offscreen.
I didnt know "Monkey" was Chinese for "This ones the Dragon Warrior"
I was *really* hoping it had 2 and 3, ngl.
Monke
Rhino bouta make me act up
I love how his cartoons are so meaningless yet they recap everything in plot perfectly. Thank you for another great animation.
These backgrounds are astounding. Also great jokes, these only keep improving. I hope to see a recap of Kung Fu Panda 2 as well!
I’m gonna tell my grandchildren this was the actual movie script.
When I was younger I cried when Oogway Ascended. I’m also crying now on the floor screaming my lungs out laughing hearing Oogway get one last one off before he passes.
哇哇🌹
Po struggling by running up the stairs: *can relate*
I don't know why, but I laughed from the moment where Master Oogway died.
Holy shit the wisdom in the scroll
Literally the best video i ever saw on youtube. Had me deadass laughing 🤣🤣🤣
3:25 for a second i thought he grabs a second xD.
I like the background at 2:32
Full version of that bitcrushed Kung fu fighting track? That SLAPS!
Rocky porody
No one gonna talk about the 2s make out session Tai Lung and Po had amidst the fight? im in tears
Tu utilise quoi comme logiciel

As a person who watched this movie many times as a kid, I can assure you this is accurate without needing to watch the movie
Real kunfu panda 🐼 https://youtu.be/Ls66oP3LN-k

2:50 im dead! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
03:16 Did Tai Lung do a greninja/cloud final smash?
Thats what i was wating for :D
Just how I remembered it
The little flick that caused the rhino to LITERALLY DISINTEGRATE caused my sides to ilplode
Make a plushie tai lung
1:08 Exactly how I remember it
God tier parody
Is that the fucking delay lama in the end credits
“There are no accidents.” -Master Oogway
Epik quality

Hamoud habibi Hamoud I didn't expect it🤣🤣
I hope one day TerminalMontage will collab with Cas
For a second I thought Poe was doing the Wooshi finger hold on Tai Lung’s nipple
At first I thought Oogway's making strange noises until i saw the comments...
😆👍
Po looks Cute
Uhh I’m late since I was at a friends house  I hate people
0:51 : "hmmm *monkey* " 😂😂😂
Hammod video was so random but i love it🤣🤣🤣
My favorite parts in this recap include the butt shaking rhino, the PO and Shifu doing the Rocky training montage.
Po just got hammond
Anyone gonna talk abt how kungfu panda and black tiger thing just kissed while fighting-
Not gonna lie what hell he makes next I’m waiting for

Kung fu Panda full movie in just 4 minutes 😅👌
Id love to have a link to that song at the end, or something. I love it.
Yesh..another one of your animations  Pure perfections
Kung Fu Panda 2 is the best Dreamworks movie just for Shen alone.  I also love how vaguely historically accurately the movie gets with Shen talking about how he will harness the destructive capabilities of Gun Powder to become the new Emperor of China.  Centuries worth of destruction were caused all across China between rivaling factions all because people figured out wars were decided over who made the biggest explosives and who had an abundance of them.
Can you make Kung fu panda 2 its my favorite Kung_fu_panda movie
3:07 Is this footage from Morial Combat 12?
bro, esto es lo mejor que eh visto en mi perra vida... es perfecto en todos los sentidos :'D
Cas doesnt miss, love his videos
Yeah!! Kung fu Panda 😍

Always fun to watch all the animation, always make me laugh
Imagine if Jack Black watched this, his reactions would be priceless.
THE REFERENCESS🤣😂😭I CANT

Video: Says not made for kids. Youtube is probably gonna mark it as for kids anyway like they've done with Rick and Morty videos.

Are we just going to ignore the fact Po and Tai Lung were making out?
how is the jiggle so smooth
The delay lama music at the end is great
Love the delay lama effect on the credits song
yESSS THIS WAS SO GOOD PLEASE DO THE SECOND MOVIE I NEED TO SEE YOU DRAW LORD SHEN ILL CRY
PLEASE DO EMPIRE STRIKES BACK NEXT
My only complaint is that Mufasa wasn't inside the scroll. Otherwise this is golden! Animation is ON POINT!

0:29 He could use a bit more torque...
3:43 I'm glad that the Delay Lama is getting used more often, ever since it has appeared on the popular song, "Freaks."
I hate China much. So, I want Panda extinct with China all together ASAP.
Thank you for yet another phenomenal work of animation, Cas! :D
Heh
HHAHAHAHAHA 😆😆😆
I didn't realize the sexual tension in the fight at the end!
I bet jack black would love this LMAO
This person deserves so much more subscribers, honestly, he puts so much work and time into everything he's made and it needs more recognition.
Kung Fu Panda is such a great movie.

half expected the dragon scroll to be a rickroll or a gnome
I love how the licensed music was just absolutely massacred.
do the ultimate captain underpants recap next
1:31  JESUS HOLY SHIT! HIS MUSCLE MASS SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME!
Oogway making the turtle mating sound and him fading away while the sound dies down emotionally is one of the greating fucking things I've seen from Cas yet.
The animation more smooth and also 3D look great; do you best I love you animation
Pure gold
is it normal that I'm laughing a lot at this?
Props to this dude who never strays from the actual story
Foo
the 3d models work so well for all these
The detail in the background is so fucking amazing, holy shit.
Who needs to watch actual movies when Cas can recap them beautifully
"Mmmmm, Monke." -Master Oogway.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not even 24 hours in and this is already a great start to October.
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting
No panda sitting on Tai Lung
I just love how good Poe looks
I love the detuned music
could just be me, but this seems a lot more meme-y than the other ones.
The ultimate "Rango" Recap?  A meme video based on a meme movie, can only be good
Ki my panda
I just wanna say King Fu Panda was my childhood movie, thank you you made my day
3:25 pense que eso era un pezon ._.
*Please make it more gory, and more swears*
1:23 Why?
I love how Cas doesn't make this for kids, it's nice to see blood and guts flying everywhere once in a while
This slayed me and Delay Lama was the final straw
1:02 “Incredible”
i loved the kiss scene
2:52 !!!!!HAMOON!!!!!
We need part 2
These backgrounds are astounding. Also great jokes, these only keep improving. I hope to see a recap of Kung Fu Panda 2 as well!

Perfection.
At first, I thought the Wuxi finger technique was being done on Tai lung's nipple; that made it even funnier to me.
2:38 Did Ty Lung just perform a Shoryuken!?
*Cas to YouTube every single time:* Just because I make cartoons, doesn't mean I'm kid friendly! I actually do look like one... But not because I make cartoons!
0:09 well DAMN, if that's how we starting  then.....
Me watching the epic fight in 0.25x speed 😂🤣

Nice
Tiger King Coin($tking) is going to be worth 100x what its currently worth in 2 months from now  It’s Joe Exotic’s official crypto and Tiger King season 2 comes out November 17. Its already up over 100% from 10 days ago  Also, current market cap is only at $10 million
I don't see how this is not kid friendly by my standards.
The most high quality animation in the world 😂
Kung Fu Panda is my favorite

What's up with the rayman music
Ficou maneiro cara e o mais legal é que agora eu posso saber tudo que oceis falam com a tradução automatica ai , agora vocês não escaparam tailandeses e filipinos.
I like how they just start beating po up
What did I just witness: 1:23
Flat Stanley
You watching TikTok 2:51😂😂😂😂
Shi fus death had me In tears
the 3D stuff is so awesome :o
Legendary
Jesus Christ..
1:48 OMFG LMAOO
Fun fact: Po beating Tai Lung by killing him brutally is actually the actual ending, minus the blood  The finger hold canonically sends people to the shadow- I mean spirit realm, which is where dead people go. Po literally killed Tai Lung.
"Hearing the tortoise's mating sound sent my sides into a black hole"  Words cannot express how much I love Po’s
1:24 WTF 🤔📸bro?
Where is Mantis???
Good
0:53 monky
Today is my birthday and I couldn't ask for anything more
Turtles. Fuckin.
1:46 even in his death, Master Oogway was having a good time
Nooooooooo my memories
this is great
That goose lmao can't breath.
pfffft
sick delay lama moment
3:23 Was I the only one who taught Po grabbed Tai Lung's nipple here? It fits with this channel.
May I suggest Sam rami Spider-Man
this was very well done!
I love how Oogway says “Monkey”, yet Po is still chosen as the Dragon Warrior instead of him.
3:07 the best fight I saw in my life XD
...
I nearly shat myself looking at the thumbnail.
the training montage slayed me. That initial slap just had me reeling.
I'm a little sad that oogway didn't do the peace out meme
THE UNTITLED GOOSE
1:45 kinda sad sounding though..
1:21 Cursed
This video is cool and amazing
The lengths cas must go to tell people it ain’t for kids
Mmmm wonder where is wall e movir
hello young lady
Mmm… *monke*
Yeah the first time i watched the rhino clapping i laughed too 100% accuracy with the part of po obliterating his opponent
Lmaoo I didn't even notice Mantis was a part of the recap until my third time watching this.
0:11 not made for kids? What gave it away?
The goose!!!😂😂😂
I loved the untitled goose game reference
post credits master's still laying there smashed.🤣🤣
I love how Po’s dad is a real goose while everyone else is animated 😂
Expected Po to fire off some Tenacious D swears
1:21
We asked for Wall-E / Tarzan in the last compilation
Please make a recap of the Sam Raimi Spiderman
1:48 XFarganxYt would be proud because tourtle was moaning
😍😍😍😍😍😍
You should do how to train your dragon next.
N O T F O K I D S
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yay!! Finally.
Turtle noises
You've outdone yourself this time, Cas.
I love your animations so much, you should totally do How To Train Your Dragon if you haven’t already!
Holy shit the music at the end was actually banger 😔
THE FORSAKEN HAMOOD SCROLL HOW COULD HE
man I was kinda excited for that lil kid to sing "everybody was kung fu fighting" but I can still appreciate the talk box cover
No one's talking about the fact this is Cas's 69th video.
Did he have to throw it back tho 🤣
😂😂😂😂
1:22 is very accurate and scary
And that was the greatest movie to ever exist in the history of films.
................................more ON THIS ,,,,,,,at our- music show:   http://piaf.triaccess.org/fv.aac
0:22 best part
3:26 is this a reference?

Hmm monkey (Everyone cheering) 🤣
🤣
WHY WERE THE GUARDS CHEEKS CLAPPIGN SO LOUD
Jaja la pelicula de mi infancia  Muy bueno
The Final Battle is just as epic as I remember
1:46..🐢
Lo key, I kinda think this vid was made for kids…
Anna Engels better be getting the biggest share of the ad revenue, those backgrounds are incredible!
So beautiful 😩
This was absolutely hilarious...but what's the reference at 3:25 ?  I feel like I know those cursed-sounding sounds but I can't place it.... ...actually this is the internet...do I even wanna know?
I wasn't expecting to laugh this hard these are always the best.
we really need a full version of the outro, please
The new artists you hired really showed their stuff! I loooove Anna Engles, so seeing her do the backgrounds for this was a really nice surprise!
2:52 The scroll do be like: This meme is from the future you wont get it
Obese
You should do a space jam 2 one
Uhyvuvu
2:52 Lol what called this original video? That funny but a bit weird...
Do Shrek 3 remake next
All the music in this video was exclusively sung by people with holes in their necks
I couldnt stop laughing while watching this, thank you for making it
Predator????
My favorite one so far :)       And the stairs run lol
1:24
Role 1.24

I was seriously expecting, when the scroll was opened, to hear, "Alex the Lion, What the H-"
this is one of the funniest yet
Wow

Aaah, that complete and utter 'Fuck You' to Youtube Kids in the beginning. It warms my heart!
imagine the animators pain by animating Po
This is how i remember the movie
Aunque la animación está súper el resumen últimamente me parece más flojo   Creo que es por eso por la animación que parece requerir más tiempo 😐👍
Spirited away recap please
Hamood is old yet a certified hood classic
I'm glad that this took so long
lmaooo not untitled good game💀
ngl that Delay Lama cover of Kung Fu Fighting is low key super fire, id love a full version!!
I love the way cas used 3d objects with 2d characters
1:03 budget: -100K
Everyone else: Untitled Goose Game, tortoise noise  Me: HANG ON, DOES THE OUTRO USE DELAY LAMA!?
Yeeeeeee
Untaild gose
the leg part with King Julian still the best.
That fight at the end was STUPIDLY GOOD!

Man, at the end Po gonna be used as a surf board now
Hamod habibi are you konw  what is this song

3:32 ORIGINAL ENDING
Do the original spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire as one video
Oh my god
1:11- when you tell the teacher if we get homework and your friends get mad:
Po’s fight is when that one guy spams counter
Cas van please read this but here's something funny for you to see and for everyone else
Panda.
What’s the sound bite at 3:26?  I absolutely love your animations but I’d appreciate it if you linked where you got the audio for some bits
3:07 top 10 anime battles
0:30 goes speed 0:33 still speed I think this the right spot

Describe Cas van de Pol’s characters in one word:     1:24-1:30, 2:20-2:23  THICC.
Ok we need to take a minute and appreciate how beautiful the backgrounds are in this one
Oh thank you it’s been so LONG
1:24 I lost it there
What the? Why the PO is so big and soft
New video yay
Easily your best work so far
Should put a rickroll on the scroll bro
Thanks for reminding me the sounds the Jurassic Park raptors make are the sounds of tortoises mating
PO TURNED INTO A SURFBOARD LESS GOOO
I do miss when these didn't have to go out of way to be gory just to get youtube off cas's back
1:03   Yo I think he took pain killers in this scene
Made it here in 11 hours

You have to do a Shrek one, at some stage
The bit with the rhino was fucking great
3:02 whoever gets this reference you are 100000000 IQ

JACK BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I appreciate  you adding not for kids as well as adding old meme as well so the newer generation doesn't vibe with it, NOICE
1:22 He got them Minecraft cheeks
This... This might just be the one that broke me.
You can’t convince me that making out with Tai Lung isn’t a successful battle strategy
Had to take a double take on the intro
I hope YouTube doesn't remove rhino scene
1:26 that rino got me acting up 😳
The ramifications of the final skadoosh mean that the spirit realm is likely not painted with greens and gold, but rather the reds and whites of blood, viscera, and bones.
Хамуд хамуд Хамуда хабиби хамуд!!! Хамуда хабиби !!!!!!!!!!
I thought I could make it through this video without laughing.    I was wrong.
I need the Kung Fu Fighting end song in full!!
Po literally became a surf board
the scene where master oogway heaves his final squee is legendary
Finally, someone acknowledging the power and wisdom that Hamood bestows upon mortals
1:24
I can't believe Po was Bowser all along...
Why is that everyone just beat up po at 1:09 for saying hello also funny video by the way
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES😀

That was... *AWESOME*
I freaking love this guy’s animations
I believe this is the best video of all time!
Am I the only one who got Omnislash vibes from Tai Lung during he and Po's fight-
My favorite parts are how over the top you have to be in the beginning to show not for kids.
Me: Enjoy seeing po and jaguar making out with lion king music Hell: Your time has come

Мастерами кунг-фу не рождаются~~
1:16 I'm probably wrong on this but is this the same music in Godzilla 2014 when Godzilla opened his eyes while he was resting in the city's rubble? It's got the same flute sound and everything but I don't know.
Warning This is not made for kids as you saw in the intro
Uh wot why the kiss?
I like how Crane keeps his deadpan starts h the rough out the entire thing.
Oogwey speaking facts

the sad part is that he takes over 2 months to make 5 minutes of a masterpiece. this is great and im sure many of us waited for this video. be fucking grateful that he is busy the whole time making 60 frames per second just for us to laugh 2 times and remind ourselves every time of that one moment and burst out laughing in the middle of class. BE FUCKING GRATEFUUUUUUUUU
anyone want cheese
mmm monke
Yk what i'd like to see? Osmosis Jones, or Shark Tale like this lmfao
I feel like it would have been better with less memes...
The original film: A Whorty Opponent!
Yeah, that’s cool, but where’s my boy wall-e?
I came here for "Monke" and was not disappointed
I love how so many jokes depend on knowing about a thing or two on the internet. This animation sent me into orbit.
3:06
I can't believe Oogway fucking nutted and died.
kung fu panda looks a little more different than i remember...
0:30 when I go to school
Dude this is so good!! This honestly has to now be my favorite movie recap you did!! GREAT JOB MY DUDE :D
Is the outro made with Delay Lama?
0:31 That is highly accurate
What is the reference to 3:25 ?
Yes, like this i remember cartoon when i watch it in younger
Primero me quede sin amigos antes de que sacaras un nuevo recap
Hamood

HANMOOOODDD HABBIIIIBBBIIII
1:00 is that what he thinks Jack Black sounds like?
KUNG FUUUU PAAANNDDDAAAAA
Alternate Reality to Kung Fu Panda be like:
I legitimately can not believe what I just watched
Meanwhile in the House of evolution 1:34
EWW I SAW THEM KISSES
1:50 i KNOW what that sound is and i am NOT OK with you using it 😂😭
The sound of fucking turtle 🐢 😂😂😂 no way
Cool
teacher: if you are confused look back at the textbook  the textbook: 2:51
This Recap makes me want to watch Kung Fu Panda
anyone get reminded of terminalmontage's "something about.." series I love this kind of humor
Did you get K.K. Slider to sing the cover of Kung-Fu Fighting? Because that would've been catchy.
Lol
Always having to remind YouTube that this isn't for kids makes me remember that YouTubeKids is a thing that should have been enforced. Instead, YouTube decided to market the whole site as "kid friendly" and now every creator has to suffer for it.
BEST animation so far loving it :D
1:01 This is beautiful.
Yeeeeeeeeeee
When I saw Untitled Goose I immediately started laughing
You should do the croods next
I wonder what happened to that rhino jailkeeper’s tail.
This may be the best episode yet
The ending song made with Delay Lama xDD
This just captures the entire essence of Kung Fu Panda better than Kung Fu Panda ever could
🤨Bruh
This is what the movie would look like if it was all a Noodle Dream
Finally new video
Why you gotta disrespect my boy oogway like that😭
Animation ↗️↗️↗️↗️
I love the 3D elements implemented to animation
This one is my favorite one by far
Love the experimental stuff... Keep it up
Goddamn that rhino tho
You were horney when you made this weren't you?
O dude this is art
I think this is your best animation
Idea  with a goose from the game and his father is brilliant
Omg ye
BROOOO SHREK NEXT!!??
Do a madagascar escape 2 afri plzzz
Gotta say, I think this is the best one you've done yet! (Though I pretty much love all of them)
Viewers: How many memes can you fit in a recap? Cas: Yes.
It’s a lovely day in a Cas van de Pol recap, and you are a horrible goose
Cas you really outdid yourself on this one. Great video
Nice untitled kung fu panda game
The turtle moaning lmfao
Watch as its labeled for kids
Mufasa: SIMBAAA!!!  Master SHIFU: PANDAAAA!!!
When Master Oogway said “ÂĒØÖÕĖGH” I felt that
the tortoise sound got me
Me da mucho coraje como por  culpa del asqueroso copyright no puedan poner la canción de Rocky bien para terminar de hacer perfecto el meme
YouTube isnt good enough for this content. These guys should get a lot of money and time to make something great
Pls make 2 and 3 Kongfu panda
Tus animasiones me dan risa🤣

3:14 WHAT THE F(BLP)K
*Mm Goose*
Great job equals touch grass equals bad dragon fighter equals bad Teacher equals death
i want that song 😂 3:43
I think it was the best repacap cartoon i've ever seen
Recap: The duck tells shifu the bad news. Shifu tells Oogway about it but he passes away Shifu tells the furious 5 with po. The 5 went away to face tailung. Shifu trains po.
That delay llama at the end
Why…
The small makeout season while Po was fighting the Leopard makes me think that Cas Van de Pol will never be the same after animating Mort's foot fetish scene
Didn't know i'd see Oogway 'Horny Scream' himself to death today...
terminal panda
the end sounds like a papers please cover of kung fu fighting
Where does he get all of these shitpost ideas?
I died when they just started making out, i laughed so hard I think my lung is stuck in my throat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amazing as always my goodness

O /|\ / \
1:45 I have a tortoise and this is just...correct
Well, both of Poh's parents are dead
Haha yes
Rhino guard got me 😩
Monke should hate Po the most. Oogway was clearly favoring choosing him when Po got in the way.
Dude i feel like your animations starts to be mor fluid
3:35 imagine if this is what happened in the movie if they decided to show it.
Hamood habibi hamood hamood habibi
Tylong looks like an absolute unit
Master Oogway's turtle nut to oblivion sent me.
Definitely expected higher caliber homoeroticism, but loved it all the same

3:14 xD?
By far one of the funniest recaps I’ve ever seen XD
despite the parody..the background is beautifully drawn
2:20 Okay, I could make so many jokes out of this, let's see...  When you pay for an overzealous Dominatrix- No, no, that doesn't even have a punchline, it's just kinda there... O-Okay, uhhhh.... Talking back to your Dom be like- no, that's not it either... fuck... Maybe something about Catholic schools a few years back? When you... When you say, When you say fuck....uhhh... when you say fuck in a...I...When she wants to test out... When- when.. Oh, "Babe, I swear, they told me that was a cutting board!"... GAH! fuck it, I give up  The punchline is "Kinky". Work your way from there

So... Oogway busted a nut to death?
1:22 Nooooooo x,,,D
You gotta ease up with COPA crap to be honest. Yeah, I know what happens with enough infractions or whatever, but your stuff is becoming stale. I have been subscribed for a while, I will stay subscribe and continue to check your vids because I've always loved your work. The Bambi recap being my favorite. However, I personally hardly even chuckled on this one because of the repetition from trying to avoid the COPA. Gun. Murder. Gore. Sexualism.
that intro had me on the floor rolling
Missed the 'Simba' in this one.
man I loved Kung Fu Panda as a kid! I think I still have the PJs? also I love how Po is still a pancake at the end
the duck....... ohhh the duck.
Do pirates of the caribian Next 😄😄

the untitled goose game got me lmao
I have never once again seen Kung Fu panda since when it first came out when I was 6. Yet this recap actually makes me remember everything about the movie plot lmao
1:35 that was amazing AND horrifying to watch
Pls add the ouuuuuuhhhhh sound when the jade antiques and weapons break
Holy shit, the Delay Lama cover of Kung Fu Fightin’. Fucking incredible.
0:20 existe un multiuniverso
1:02 THAT DAMN VIDEO

Awesome background arts, cool goose design and very funny hamood joke
Them kissing mid fight made me laugh harder than I should have
Hahaha XD
I could barely breathe during the training montage!
Nederlands?
This one was dope
You know what would make it even more cooler? Scene where Tai lung looks at the dragon scroll, and doesn't see hamood and gets confused.  Like only a destined one could understand that stupid meme.
stop
So, no one gonna talk about 3:14
Oh god that kiss was the best bit. Did not expect it at all lmao.  That and the spanks uwu
HAMOOD! IT'S FUCKEN HAMOOD! My 7 year old self is partying rn and my current self is really confused where you got it from, holy crap

3:13 ay que ricoxd

Okay so Flashgitz, TerminalMontage,  Cas AND Lumpy Touch all uploaded today, so I think all my fave animators are trying to give me a brain aneurysm because I can't handle this amount of quality 🤯
1:04 What is the song name?
Blaaah blablaaah blabla bla blaaaaah...
3:27 what the fuck is this from?!!??
That wushi finger hold was nuts.

Simplemente hermoso xD me encantas estos videos
The guards are hella thick tho
I love it!
😱😱😱👍👍👍🔥🔥
the goose looked like a green screen gameplay footage for a second really well made
I love this dude. 2:46 was like a whole cool scene with his staff & the water, and he just does that...
1:51 he finally came
It will probably get deleted
Percurso para dela

|тот же самый комент для поддержки канала |
Last music.... 👍🤟
A legend, I see.
Seeing Po Kissed The Tiger was so much worst then Mort Licking Feet
The integration of the Untitled Goose and the amazing shattering class effects was so cool.
THAT GOOOSE I CAN"T XD !!! Amazing job !!!
Tai lung went *dead*
So cas will there be wall-e recap cartoon sometimes
Haha yes
Those noises Oogway was making tells me he enjoyed dying *way* more than he should.
:D
These are always so impressive
This is the perfect noodle dream indeed, made my week!
Shiiiiiiit! I've just played the Goose Game 🤣
0/10 jack black didn’t say “FUCK YOU!”
How did you get to the Hamod the oldest Arabic meme Jesus, am not sure but this one was before Rick roll shit
you know what would be great? Ice Age
Frickin' Delay Lama at the end LOL
I saw the Goose and knew this would be a 15/10!!! Great work!
ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Like si pensaste que le habia agarrado un pezón 😂

Ok but viper is so cute in this

Wow! It's in 3D now!
1:24 I am fucking dying
Loved how mantis was just a still image the whole video. PD: How to train your dragon recap when??
The way the tortoise died killed me.  Very funny.
Delay Lama ending song, best song full version when?
PO the Panda
Awesome
9/10 Just because you lost a perfect chance: you used that meme, instead of a *"Rick Scroll".*
MONKE
Why....Hamood....
Omg he did a dudesons refrence
I love how he just flat out punched shifu to get the dumplings.🤣🤣
The prison scene with the rhino twerking was something I don’t know I had to see
0:46/4.11
حمود حبيبي حمود حمود حبيبي
i feel like jack black would appreciate this
that "hello young lady" always making me laugh
This is a masterpiece
Can’t believe Po didn’t consider BLJing up the stairs, especially since his dad must be a true gamer. I am already so hyped for the sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2 is unironically my favorite movie of all time
*_Why the rhino got all that cake_* 😳
HAMOOD 2:51
Faz uma animação dessa do Jurassic park
that rhino is THIQQQQQCHEEE
is it just me or is Cas' animation skill really improving? He's doing a great job mixing 2-d and 3-d animation.
A LAUGHED MY LAUNGS OFF🔥
i died from 1:48 😂😂😂
1:58 Holy shit, that out of tune Gonna Fly Now is bad. I need more! Edit: NOOOOOOO, it has been changed :(

WOOO yeah baby! That's what we have been waiting for woo
Cool Music
Just what I needed
😂😂😂😂😂
I NEED a full version of that delay lama cover of "kung fu fighting"
I can't decide if i want or dont want the source of that audio at 3:26
Just how I remember it in the movie  Tai Lung and Po kissing mid fight
Ah Kund fu Panda, just as good as i remember it being , *Po on crack , Rhino clapping ass cheeks to assert dominance , oogway trolling with da hamood , shifu getting fking squished and po being a puching bag for every entity in the multiverse*
Master Oogway just auhh auhhing himself into the next life was pretty hilarious. Also the annoying goose and the Po running animation was awesome. I've watched this one so many times already. xD
1:26
Where’s mantis
Id recognize delay lama anywhere, sick ending song
0:54 Oogway: *monke* Everyone: LES GOOOOOOOO1!1!1!

2:52  WTF BRO I was shocked that’s an ancient Iraqi meme where the hell did you get it from  Translation: Hammod? Hamood? ( a name )  Hamood my beloved one (and he just repeats it)
A little disappointed we didn't get a rendition of “Kung Fu Fighting” from Zahr!

The 3D animation of the Po's Dad is most impresive than all Pokemon Master Journeys

1:23 to 1:31 made me laugh so hard I couldn't breathe
God damn I love these

The animation got so much better !!
Did that tortoise just orgasm himself to death?
The dad being the annoying goose was too funny

Hamood coming in with the save
Nobody:  Me in my nightmares: 0:30

Can we just take a moment to appreciate the beautiful animation of the goose? Seriously that was amazing 😉
Wait didn't he said, "Monkey" 😅😅😂😆😆😆
I really hope Jack Black sees this video someday.
The way Oogway die is so stupid
1:48 this sound is from 2 turtle mating meme 😂😂😂😂😂😂
oh, no Zahr cover?
Vas you ok man I mean I loved the video but geeze
Why is this so damn glorious 😂😂
the amount of quality references in this one is insane
I love Po’s run cycle for when he’s going up the stairs
Any time you make a cartoon recap the more inappropriate it gets.
I didn't enjoy it
Oh yeah just like I remembered

The fight between Po and Tai Lung was the perfect, it was what you'd expect from this channel, but as epic as Kung Fu Panda.
2:08 Who knew Master shifu was secretly nana from Madagascar?
the decision to use the dudesons audio clip is genius
Best moment is 1:46 - 1:55 lmao
1:48 When the turtle is sus!
Who wants him to do a toy story recap, raise your hand! 🤚
would've been fantastic to just use jack blacks voice clips (from everything except the movie)
IS THAT FUCKING DELAY LAMA AT THE OUTRO?  I hate you. But at the same time, it's magnificent.

91 views  36k likes  you good youtube?
Master oogway as the moaning turtle was the best part for me  Instead of co(o)ming he left us XD
The noises Oogway makes around 1:52 are likely modeled after the noises turtoes and tortoises make when getting off. Nearly pretty sure.
Po: well hello lady  Furious five: so you chosen getting beaten...
view 91❤️
The fact that this animation made me thought about a Po and Tai Lung ship makes it Genius 😹

Yeah my boy
Oogways death tho XD
Wow,It´s amazing
Awww I was hella looking forward to “everyone was kungfu fighting” cover by his niece ToT
I did NOT expect that rhino to literally clap cheeks
This was hilariously violent. Especially love that Viper and most of the villagers had the OwO face in most scenes. That really adds to the absurdity of Po getting beaten up in 1:12 while the tiny snek is all OwO the whole time.  Nice work!
Perfection
I'm glad you stuck to the realism of what a turtle sounds like when he is dying hahahah
I FUCKING LOST IT AT 1:47

Tai Lung reacted very weirdly for having his finger hold by Po.
Poor goose
This is the must cool animation i see ever
The training sequence 😂😂😂
1:02 I recognize that "THE INCREDIBLES 3" by really3d reference anywhere
This is so cursed. I love it
Your recap Kung_fu_panda is better than Original
From the initial shotgun blast, to the goose, and then the cursed turtle sounds, this made me laugh so damn much

Finally, a worthy video  My viewing will be legendary!
The fact that both Cass van de Pol and TerminalMontage had uploaded in almost the exact same time has made my day so much better.
Untitled goose lmao!
I hope you do how to train your dragon can't wait to see that one!

uploads from Cas AND Terminalmontage?! WIN!
I wonder if this is gonna turn into another trilogy... My guess is a no, the Avatar trilogy was a HUGE project and the Avatar community is very big and enthusiast as well, so the chances are pretty low. But I wouldn't mind getting a trilogy hehe. I think Lord Shen could be a very interesting character in the Cas universe.  Anyways, awesome vid bro! Like always!
can you do marvel more
Odd, the view count is stuck at 85
I'm trying to guard the prisoners, but I'm dummy thicc, and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the Tai Lung

"If she leave you for another, there is always her mother."  -Master Oogway
The kissing part got me LMAO
These fight scenes are Awsome
that fight 3:07 1000% accurate XD
I died at 1:47 😄 🤣
I didnt need to see the Rhino shake those square thangs around.
I can’t believe Master Shifu from the hit anime movie Kung Fu Panda fucking died.
Epic
Good
0:52 mmmm Mónkië
Wait so Monkey was chosen as the Dragon Warrior ?
I was laughing throughout the video lmao and I did not expect that Lion King reference. Got me off-guard right there.

Nice timing since the first 2 arent on Netflix anymore
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why Cas has uploaded a new video <3
Master Rhino: Twerks at Tai Lung.  Tai Lung: *So you have chosen death*
Pues si tampoco me creo que por entrenar un día ya pueda vencer a Tai long que entreno toda su vida hasta romperse sus huesos ...en fin el poder del guión u.u     Psdt: excelente animación! :D
I love the monke part
I love how you're legally obligated to say "Not Made for Kids" now so that it won't get flagged
1:47 JAJKIDAAUJCAS T MMSTE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everything oogway says is a masterpiece
Should've made Oogway say 'SIMBA' at 1:48
1:47 famous last words while doing the [REDACTED]

Even poa knows that peace is not an option be like poa everyone.
It's beautiful 🤣❤️👍 And music 3:44
I love the graphic, bloody violence front and center to avoid being marked as 'for kids'. In addition to saying it's not for kids. Doesn't hurt to be safe.

Po doesn’t just break things, he sends them to the third dimension.
* Watching in first 2 min to see every deleted scene *

*Rhino twerking is quite satisfying.*
“There are no accidents” - master oggway
Fun fact: Tai Lung is a snow leopard, which, in the real world, is a predator of the Giant Panda (Po) and the Red Panda (Shifu).
Bowser makes a pretty convincing panda.
Fun fact: Mr. Ping was originally going to be Po's strict boss. This idea was later changed to the goose being Po's dad because it was funnier.
‘Mmh, monke’ _~master oogway_

This turned out amazing! Incredibly funny and the animation is just perfect! I especially loved the scene where Po destroys all the valuable items in such a dramatic manner, I laughed so hard I that pity my neighbours.
That is legendary!!!!!
This is Fu Kung Great! 👍
Exactly how I remembered
Nice!!
Bloody hillarious as always
I can't.... It's amazing!!!!
Amazing as usual! Anyway, to be here early with only 12 likes is so alienating.
