This video lowkey has no new comments lmao
Corona looks like a guy from hindi
Bro went to the right
No one really mentions how smart this guy really is
✨So unfortunate, the loss behind it.
😂😂😂
Do "what happens when you drink alcohol"  I know it's not the best idea but I thought it would be funny
What if it mean to some can kill it
"Down the hall and to the left"  Wasn't that trump's line from home alone 2?
Covid itachi
I got it rn
every single time I came in contact with someone with Corona I got a cold(maybe stop power cleaning the living fuck out of your house and let some dirt and hair be in your house the cleaner your houses the more contagions allergies and issues you will have (as Toph said "it's a healthy layer of dirt" you need that "healthy layer of dirt" to keep away allergies bacteria and viruses from you getting sick every single day of your life (yes they do actually help you to not get severely sick throughout your life so stop cleaning your house every fucking day (clean your house every week not every fucking day)
Bro became Darth vader 💀
I always imagined a war
Bro I’m 11 and I went through all Covid and did not get it and my sister father mother had it all at the same time and still did not get it and I’m not capping
Rona isnt bad
Poor bacteria getting beat up so badly 😆 🤣 and Covid is the villain basically 😆 🤣 😂
So that's what happened when I had covid lol
I wish covid only affected the lungs. It actually attacks the lungs, guts, & brain. It sets every system into wack for years. Had it in 2020 & still have major problems caused form having it.
*It has to be this way starts playing*
Corona vs my body is like Raiden vs Armstrong
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What will happen if the vaccine came for the rona
"You dont know that my bad"😆
isn't the other guy from that meme where his house is being robbed and then he shows up and they all start vibrating like their dancing and then he shows a gun to them and then they get worried but still be dancing
He deserve the virus he's an akatsuki member.
When I got it I'll stop feeling sick in the first day
Nah it isnt invincible its just hiding from the white cells and finds it way to the lungs by itself without being detected
I got it twice I hate covif
Then you are not showing any symptoms  now what
My immune system was already equipped to handle it for some reason so I became immune to it in less that a day
Coron_o ren
How to kill Rona  Just eat the uno reverse card  “Not real don’t really do it
I had Covid at nine years old. Im ten now
Watching this with covid lol
Start the lungs
As someone who has Covid, This Is relatable
The movement in the cell fighting scene
Wait what does all the cells, cells look like and those cells look like
Lil
My t-cells were like “One Punch “ it took two days for me to recover from corona had omicron and everything didn’t go to the hospital once
I got covid but my t sells wore able to destroy it so lucky me
S H U T
So Corona really is immortal the the white blood cells
Standing here, I realized: You were just l- * dies of cringe *
That akastaki hood is fire
I have COVID-19
If the cells have esophaguses then do they have other types of organs and is there cells in the cells?
Corona when he's depressed or stressed:
Talk about being dramatic about
Standing here, I realize you were Just like me trying to make history. But who's to judge the right from wrong. When our guard is down I think we'll both agree. That violence breeds violence. But in the end it has to be this way. I've carved my own path, you've followed your wrath; But maybe we're both the same. The world has turned, and so many have burned. But nobody is to blame. It's tearing across this barren wasted land. I feel new life could be born beneath The blood stained sand.
- White blood cells: *start punching corona* - *STANDING HERE, I REALIZE, YOU WERE JUST LIKE ME, TRYING TO MAKE HISTORYYYYY*
Sees him in akatsuki suit:me:OFC YOUR SICK U BEEN CHASING AFTER FURRYS AND ANIMALS
Nauto
“He was about to do a bunch of bad things to my esophagus” got me on the ground 😂
Wait, if the T cells have body works like a stomach and an esophagus, then do the T cells have T cells? Do THOSE T cells have T cells?
He don't got carona he got aids
Like how he wearing a akatski robe
The Corona is not that strong really really weak unless you wear a mask for a few weeks or have bad air quality or not enough bacteria around
Its not like that the t cells just dont know new viruses
Wait a minute I got that Pac-Man shirt
This is corona in 2020
Next EBOLA
Down the hall and to the left  - Mr orange, home alone
That's just sad they can't even damage him a little bit
More like   Corana- hi I'm a cell I'm going to the lung department  Cells- ok
Corona chain
I love these guys videos
Is that dude a part of the Akatsuki
Omg he looks like that Atletico Madrid Lb!
Never gonna give u up never gonna let u down never gonna run around desert u
Itachi
I would just give the wrong direction and that's how it's done your welcome😌
God loves yall and Jesus Christ is returning soon and repent
Thanks this really helped at least I know how I got it
Everyone please I ask that you spread the gospel today to your friends and family because they need to know about Jesus. I don't want to force religion if you don't believe in God then just leave this comment but I want to spread the gospel to everyone I can. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day 🥰
Nah jit that crona has the black force energy
Bro if you reverse this it would be me
Wtf Rona is not that bad your body can fight it off just fine
i understand why he got corona he is akatsuki
Wait if the white blood cells has the same body parts as us does that mean they have white blood cells that has white blood cells
My bad lol
I have covid-19 😎🍉
White blood cells have White blood cells and White blood cells have White blood cells and..White blood cells have White blood cells......and goes on forever...
Part two the vaccine busts through the door
Vaczene:Corona youre dead
So thats why i dont get sick maybe they didnt tell the virus where
no one: literlly no one:  me: wait is that the akatsuki shirt?
In the words of another YouTube Short Creator “Your T cells are a pussy” I got corona and all it did was make me congested; didn’t even lose my taste
How to beat the akatsuki
You must be a doctor
AKATSUKİ
I had my first jab earlier lol
I had covid once
The white cells actually can defeat corona but viruses (covid) can "disguis" as normal bacteria...
😂
where is the london parkkkk
I think I downloaded the wrong hataraku saibou
I have covid and now im scared
*Itachi secretly giving him corona cuz hes an akatsuki member*
Correction: What really happens when you get corona and you’re elderly, obese, or have some other serious pre-existing condition.
"my bad" 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Corona:frieza
Corona’s psychotic focus on reaching the lung department is scary 😁
Bruh my 70 yo grandpa that had cancer beat covid in a week stop playing
Get the nk cells
Ah man the Akatsuki cloak
Y
My white blood cells built like whole security guards then cuz i was only sick for one day
My "Corona" lost the fight with blood cells
the akatsuki is behind spreading Corona....lol
Bro, IS THAT THE GUY ON A AKATSUKI SUIT IS THE ONE IN THE MEME?!?!?!?
Why does corona look like he's sleep deprived?
Standing Here I Realize...
*standing here I realize*
Something more accurate a tiny man obsorbs into you the make copies him self inside you the when there's no space you leak acid or something like that
Except most people who got Covid were perfectly fine unless they had pre-existing conditions, or did drugs.
This freaks me out cuz i hawe c0rona
Um is the wig for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I ❤️ these so much!!!
Btw its not t cells its actually sntibodies, the white blood cells don't attack the bacteria they release anti toxins and antibodies to attack snd destroy them
I have carona
Hall, Don't you mean vessel?
.
Ma bad
Actually white cells can fight and destroy any virus and microbes only they can't identify them
Bro, I'm in the middle of Corona. I'm currently kinda breaking down over the fact that I can hardly breathe. It's been going on for hours and it ain't stopping. I hope it will wear out cause it is awful. I want to breath and sleep, I'm so tired.
This dude is so funny and he look like will smith
My body curbstomped my covid
Lol good timing as I just been diagnosed with covid 👍
Literally what happened to me.
Akatsuki wa sudota
I currently have bronchitis from covid. I had the flu over xmas and I'd rather get covid 10x than get the flu again.
Actually, I think my cells destroyed the virus, it wasn’t that bad.
I think the fact that the white blood cells are doing nothing is a bit exaggerated
That's kinda sad bc I just got covid-
"My bad" reminded me of Will Smith movie's for some reason 😂😂   Probably the voice, sounds similar
When you want to be a youtuber but your family wants you yo be a doctor
Why you wear a mask
Great now he’s gonna cause pneumonia Cells: u don’t know that ;-; my bad
Who’s controlling there bodies
Imagine getting to watch this for science class! That would e so fun!
This dudes videos are so great. They make me smile so much!
My white blood cells: I have no such weaknesses
Literally just happened to me lmao
I feel like I am rewatching cells at work funnier version
Dude I love your videos they're awesome AF
Darth Vader vibes
This is got to be the best use of  “my mad”

When the cough started I was like get out
Lmao
😂😂😂
Accurate
Watching this while being positive is just like a horror movie 😆 And yeah I am fcked up
Is it just me that noticed he went out the door and turn to the right Instead of the left
Makes sense the adaptive immune system hasn't kicked in yet so it makes sense the T cells weren't able to do anything
Imagine t cells gives the directions to the leg Department
I love ur videos
Bruh I just have Covid-19 rip :(
Call the vaccine!
Have you done “when you get a vaccination “
It’s not a mistake✨it’s a masterpiece

Too easy
Siri I love you very
Aaaaaaa covid
Giorno theme would be perfect on this
I stayed home and still caught cv19 u don't want this shit I promise
I've got corona "last year"
Thanks for teaching science!ITS SOOO NOT BORING
I got the rona
Vaccine: HOLA BTC TIME TO DIEEEEEE >:D Corona: Why do you always have to interup
Do you mind, if I copy this?
And yet I tested positive for Rona but I only felt a teensy sick the first day then felt fine I am jesus
I have corona
Am I the only one wondering what he put on his walls for those checkers?!🤨
Corona : you ded white blood cell Group o white blood cell : are you sure Corona : wait you are group o white blood cell Group o white blood cell : yes say goodbye
If it works like that, does T-cells have T-cells in there body?
my nickname is Rona 😃

It's not a mistake‚IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
I would’ve gave it directions to the colon. Then he could poop it you lol
You could've said to the place where they die and never can escape and will get rid of him.
Amazing video man.. didn't think it can be explained this way 😂😂
It's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
I have it
Who here like's minecraft
Who hear like minecraft
i have corona
That one GTA 5 Trevor Moment
I love these skits
“It’s not a mistake✨ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨”
I love that corona isn’t trying to hurt T cells but is trying to cause pneumonia
Excellent! Cyborg- " where is the lung department?"
It is so true because I have Corona instanly
My t cells must be trained special operations soldiers My covid run in lasted a week and wasn't even bad
Such a shame if after posting it you got sicked
The ultimate ultra killer 9000 super duper deadly virus with the 99.7% survival rate.
Does this mean that his cells have cells
It’s not a mistake ✨it’s a masterpiece ✨
❌its not a joke, its a hazard ✅
My immune system will kick that ronas a*s
Not accurate but only for elders but FUNNY you have to admit
Just to know I have it surely my T-cells are going to snitch
You should have been my bio teacher.
So funny and so true. Well done videos… entertaining and informative!
This wus so funny to me
I like that Akatsuki jacket tho.
Corona is like the termenator
My bad hahaha
So what I learned was that the body actually doesn’t fight it cause it doesn’t know is a virus i till you get the vaccine and then the vaccine pretends to be a virus so the cells kill it then the vaccine gives the cells a message saying it wasn’t a virus and there may be a virus that looks like it so then when coronavirus comes in the body they defeat it
That little man at the start is sus
It will be funnier if that naruto guy’s cell is acting by him
T cell be za hando stepping on the virus
Just discovered you. Love you!  Are you a medical student?
I like the way he just strangles him self to death 😂
Joe
When you get vaccine
He look so done
The akutsuki clothing
Oke
Vaksin bro
Part2 Vaccine effect
I literally just took a test about the stuff like four days ago
Cell at work live adaption🙂
Next the guy gets a vaccine
Dude why did you snitch
Wow the t cells also have esophagus huh cool but not realistic
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Too easy💪😤
Vaccine :time to shine
My the rona went for the neck department.
Until you get the vaccine
"my bad" had me cracking 😂😂😂
Too Easy
The vaccine:where the rona
It's been 1 month since I was diagnosed with pneumonia. wish me luck guys:)
Big Naruto fan I see...
Wow! Well done🤣
corona does nothing our T cells just fuck up
nobody is talking that he is part from the akatsuki
Bo
Lamdices has top be like 6'5 damn
My T-Cells ALT F4d rona
Can you make a part 2 are did you
Wait so if the cells have an esophagus, that means the cells have cells, meaning the cells of the cells have cells, meaning the cells of the cells of the cells have cells, meaning the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells have cells, meaning the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells have cells, etc
What about smoking
What's akatsuki doing there ?
Cells at work ain’t got shit on him
Corona
ayee im wearing the same shirt lol
Man sometimes the acting's so good I forget this is just one guy. Like when Rona picked up the T cell n stuff
You are just fantastic!  Clever “entertaining”  well done!
Rona be hot do
WHERE ARE THE B SELLS
Legit Darth Vader.
I want your pacman shirt
Man your creativity on your video's 😍✨❤
Should've just taken that ibuprofen, nobody tells him how to do his job.
But his coat ❤😭
...then after a while of being sick the immune system learns how to fight corona and you have natural immunity!
*guy gets corona*  T cells: my bad
People who survived corona have probably had their t-cell not tell corona where the lung department was and corona killed the t-cells that’s how they got sick  Just a joke about this skit
Here before 1M likes
Man Nogashi from naruto is our favourite  character you got him covid
So right when I test positive for corona yt decides to show me more corona memes huh💀
I have covid actually
Wow!!! Serious is this disease. Thanks for highlighting this disease and how it has NO RESPECT!!! :-)
*me who shrugged off Corona twice in less than two days both times*
"The RONA!"     😆
That dude be like this world Shell now pain 😂
Bro is it the young baru guy?
What I saw wa... wa...  was the akatsuki
Funny
He willingly gave it up lmao
Giving me Osmosis Jones vibes. (Dunno if I spelled it right
Actually 98% Survives so make that 9999 corona to go to Lung department not just 1 cause 1 will DIE!
Me at home rn with Covid
I wonder what the cells inside the cells are up to
Akatsuki
i like how the white cells has a esophagus
BTW t cell r richer than me they Nike t shirt dammmmn 😂
⟟ have the cough cough virus 😷🤒🥵🤧🤮
Is everyone gonna ignore that he is a member of Akatsuki
At the end that was a I spoke too soon moment like if you agree
I have Corona right now
WE AIN'T PLAYING AROUND WHITE BLOOD CELLS ALL OF YOU ATTACK NOW!!
Dude If t-cells can handle cancer they can handle COVID-19.
Did anyone notice that akatsuki robe
99.98% survival rate.
Lol only WEAK people get sick from Corona lol
My bad. 😂
Like yo Akatsuki fit bro
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT AKATSUKI SUIT FROM??
No dude what really happens with Corona is the delete the flu quite literally
The my bad at the end tho
now this is the most powerful Akatsuki he can just kill someone in 10 days by just touching them 1 time
Rona!! Were
😂😂
Now my dream job is to work in a body
Down the hall to ur left is that  a homw alone refernece
Can you do what happens when you get car sickness
Rona like the op MC that don't want no trouble
did anybody else get the home alone 2 reference?
I have coronavirus but it’s not really that bad lol
So u tellin me those who got pneumonia coz of corona its because their T cells are snitches
This would be a great way to teach science. It'll make people actually be engaged with stuff
Reality I actually have corona Rn
Bro wtf how tall are u, u just barely fit thru the door u 6.8 or some? Lol
You Corona kinda like Darth Vader theo
T cells can defeat rona but for a reason they cannot contain them cuz they swarmed the t cells
Actual explaination for left brainers:):  Corona actually is not recognized in ur body as a virus unless u vaccinated, so ur body originally don’t know how to fight it. Corona also has a spikey crown of proteins. When corona enters ur body, it sticks to the wall of ur lungs, it keep using these proteins to catch ur cells and inject them with instructions to go around ur body and spread the virus. In ur lungs, the virus creates off spring. I  What the vaccine does is, it teaches your immune system how to recognize it as a threat and fight it.
Akatsuki
"Down the hall to the left"  So he only got one lung?
Did you know we are immune in all diseases? And you might tell yourself how!?!? And how can you explain that they died from the disease? Ok first let's talk about immune system what is it and how it defends us from any bacteria and viruses? Immune system have many types of it and one of them is chosen to fight virus/bacteria when it comes. So here why do we die in the diseases? It's because we won them but the problem is that theyre so harmful that they hurt almost the Any part of the body, it might heal but sometimes when the virus/bacteria hurts so seriously that all organisms is affected so much and can't heal and even dies
When peoples thought antibiotic work for corona and some peoples that get so sick that they even told it's corona and try antibiotics and that is not true antibiotics is bacteria phages that only kill bacteria and mostly those bacteria that have resistance in drugs and why It don't work in virus? Because virus don't have bacteria wall
Me trying to punch someone in a dream be like
I got corona months ago and it was a week virus didn't do anything to me
The vaccine:ima end this man's whole carrier
That's why wight blood cells give everything they got to protect the body
Ahh Rona the most dangerous virus Rona is even dangerous than co'RONA'
Actually the white blood cells just dont know what kind of virus it is if it knows it well we could say  its just a piece of cake
i got da virus:(
anyone else realize it's always "down the hall to the left"? like that's so cliche at this point like...
F
I got the Rona and cured it with no vaccine  GOOD JOB T CELLS
What happened when you laugh too hard
Really cuz when I had Covid it was a complete joke and I had only a slight loss of taste and smell for about 3 days
In corona suit you look like a monster :DD😂😂
the my bad at the end is so funni-
Man the akatsuki shirt🤣
Theres something called the B cells that can destroy anything by spraying it with it body then the lil body pieces are Eat that flu comman cold Croanna
Congratulations to everyone who found this comment I hope you be successful in life Congratulations to everyone who found this comment I hope you be successful in life
Minion Vs alucard ml belike😂😂 .IF you know what I mean😉
Bro where u get that jacket
MY BAD
Wait if the t cells are human like in these shorts does that mean they have their own t cells? And own brain and inside the other t cells there are the exact same thing all in one body?
Your cells are weak!
I would have directed him to the stomach
*Rona crushing the human cell Human cell: “Rain cytokines!” Macrophage: “But sire.  Our troops.” Human cell: “Just do it!”
for anyone thats 1st grade, white cells is for protecting you with germs
My school: YouTube isn't good for learning, how does he teach you?! Me: science teacher
OmG 😳 did anyone noticed the man who is spreading corona is an member of *akatsuki*
Heyyy
Rona: *Beats up the body*  Vaccine: *Stares at him*  Rona: *Dead*
Akatsuki
So Akatsuki spread Corona
I expected an vaccine ad lmao
Can we get a what really happens when your dizzy
Kinda sick you mean "RONA"

Osmosis Jones Multiverse detected
I've got rona
Rona: I’ve defeated your immune system The dirt I ate at 5yrs old: allow me to introduce myself.
This is great lololol
OMG I LOVE NARUTO AND HE HAD A ITACHI CLOAK
What a coincidence I have an pneumonia 😌
We want t cell secreating the cytotoxins
Can confirm
I learn more of biology here than in my bio class 😵😂✌🏻
This is history Keep them coming love 😘
It also tricks your unvaccinated body into attacking itself making your immune system over worked.
*Alarm epmonia start* That 1 t-sell:mah bad
.
Do what really happens when you smoke weed
Literally osmosis jones
rona:pain from naruto  *t blood cells:naruto when he couldnt beat up pain
I don't ever want to see this shit again my dad almost died from the Corona Fucking Virus!!!!!!
Maybe its just me...... But iz this talented sir, related to Sin Bad
This isn't how actually it works. The T. Cells just ignores the corona virus like jts nothing because Corona kindof weaken your immune system and its like living free in you. That's why peeps keep telling you to sleep well and take vitamins to keep you immune system up to date.
To some people cause that didnt happen to me
And the vaccine is like a steroid which makes the white cell stronger
Now show “what really happens when you have covid but ZERO symptoms”.
You I love your videos keep them coming
Just had bloodshell and these test
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂HIHIHIHIHIHIHIHI
Not funny
Lol
Cells got an esophagus? Cells are inside cells how do we know we aren’t cells
Like the akatsuki clothing
You just had to say it
All I think is about osmosis Jones
Your friend was from akatsuki how can u trust him he won't give corona😂😂
I just realized it's the same dude who had the 'rona in King Vaders vid
I Love The Fact He Was Wearing The Akatsuki Cape 👏✨
Rona wasn't havnin that sh*t he gotta grabin necks sh*t got real😂😂
*MY BAD*
"my bad" XD
"He was about to cause all types of damage to my esophagus" You're a cell, you don't HAVE an esophagus!
Well it is actually the immune system overreacting and starting to kill friendly cells too which is why we call “sickness”
The Akatsuki jacket though!!!!
Me: hahaha *gangstas paradise starts playing* Rona: what the Me: *summons shaggy, sung drip woo and black air force activity* Rona: holy sh- Me: you ready to die boy Rona: look man I'm so- *gets knocked out* Me: ok put him with the white blood cells
The TCell said “he about to do all kinds of damage to my esophagus”   Do the mini people in the body have mini people in their bodies?
Actually our cells can't recognise them therefore vaccine is given
I used to think these were dumb after watching osmosis Jones these are hella funny
i like how my cells have cells
I believe the lung department is near the lungs
I made Pneumonia oh and corona oh and Asma
Oh that's the akatsuki hood
*When i was a kid i thought that a virus and antibiotics or your immune system is having a modernized war*
Part two?
*"My bad"* lmao
Last scene gave Will Smith vibes after he fucks up🤣
I like how my guy's  just wearing an Akatsuki robe lmao😂
Oh God
AKATUSKI
Funny but i dont want to got it
0:01

I beat corona, for me it’s second world war
Also do the vaccine part
“My bad.” -Famous last words
First time u came at me and say u sick and give me ur hand i beat u
Dad tell my body feels and I have a cold!:0
Akatsuki coat
If people would turn off their cell phones and routers for a couple weeks they would not get sick.. it is the electromagnetic frequencies from the new 5G towers along with the stress of the lockdowns and news, not to mention poison air, food, water, that are making people sick...
My body is just different ig bc they kick the shit of of rona
Lol the akatsuki jacket from naruto
Actually the viruses are smaller than the bacteria
😂😂😂nice edits
That's why ybgf vaccinated
"my bad" 😭😭💀
So this is happening to me right now?

T cells you don’t know that.”                                        Boss: …                                  T cells: “my bad..”
I learned something today: T cells apparently have esophaguses 🤯
Inaccurate, My T cells would never fold
Maybe you could’ve said the wrong direction
Is that an akatsuki cloak
Vaccine : Hi
Gotta get that vacc
My bad
He looks like the spice king
Cringe
I HAVE THE SAME PAC MAN SHIRT!!!!!!!
Cancer is caused by cells having a will to live, so they sacrifice the body to survive. So if a white blood cell is helping a virus...
Woww😂😂🤩
Cells at work
This is why vaccinations are essential.
Nice jacket
Me laid her with covid as now as hell
Akatusi cloak?
I love how the white cells are just straight up boxing that poor fucking bacteria 😂
The funny thing is that your white blood cells can take on the rona
He kinda looks like Marcus from mrbeast
I have covid right now
"he was boutta do all sorts of damage to my esophagus" had me wheezing 🖐️😭💀😮😏😏
There only 2 white cells bruh
antivirus: what
USE THE SHADOW CLONE JUTSU AND RASENGAN!!!!
I have the rona I didn’t know that’s what happened
“My bad”
Best Anime I've Seen. Dragon Ball Z/Super.One Piece.One Punch Man.Attack on Titan.Demon Slayer in Japanese.
my bad
COVID 19
You can know about it     On professor of how channel
That just happened to us @2months ago since this whole thing started lol tyvm our bodies kicked some pneumonia and covid-19 ass💪🏻💞😅
0:06 pac-man
I wish he was my biology teacher 😂
T cell:*chill* my bad
Akatsuki is here to capture him
still corona works by cells not knowing what is corona so they just let corona go
corona
Vcine m get in : hi guys Rona : uh
That one should have said the way to digestion 👀 nvm idk biology
Rona gives the vibe of raulugi
Stupid naruto fan
The fight lasts 4 days
Corona got that black airforce acitivity
Covid19:wheres the lung department  T cell:DOWN THE HALL TO THE LEF  covid19: *proceeds to go right*
Everyone don't be very scared but the lung thing is true, it doesn't do any harm at all you just can't smoke or be around anyone who is smoking in your area. I dont know what happens if you don't follow these rules but I would try to accept them.
poor bacteria😂👌
Only anime fans wull understand hahaha
Ayo Naruto? -
Thats that guy dancing meme one car brand and other brand showing better car 🤣
dows anyone remeinded itachi when guy came
So my T Cell's power level is over 9000 I survived

I don't know that inside human body there is a ceiling fan....
I have rona
Likin the new cells at work covid arc
Is that a Naruto mask
Boss:Now he's gonna cause pneunia Body cell(idk):You don't know dat      (ALERT ALERT PNEUNIA) Body cell(idk)My bad
o
Nice editing
oh cells have body parts like the esphagus
Covid cannot get to my lungs I gulp a anti virus on my pc
The T-cell had an esophagus? 😳
Oh man when is vaccine part 1 is coming ??? Telling ya tis was awesome 😆😆😂🤣🤣
My bad😂
Lol
Corona isnt that powerfull at all only 1% fatality rate but still funny short
Except this is kinda wrong
Dang the like have 666k
666k likes ._.
Oh my 666k like
Holy Its 666
Too easy
Rona fake
And the vaccines are either steroids for the white blood cells or prepping them like “hey there’s a bacteria infecting everyone and if it invades us, do THIS”
Epic typical anime scenes be like:
You should make a video called what happens when a t cell gets a virud
Aah yes corona beer
You will be a good teacher of biology
Na the natural killer is gonna fight the corona
If you got vaccine that will dress up as Rona every white blood cells will beat Rona.
Koooook ada yang baru
Corona is like every male anime character like fr
Naruto vibes!
Lol wholesome and educative
yeah, your bad.
Live Action Cells at Work
I have Corona for real
Anime Version name is Cells at Work
Do one where you're vaccinated
Me who killed myself before Corona kills me: 🕺🕺🕺💃💃
Iamdices please do a video on what really happens when you vomit
This is closest to what we can get for a live action Cells at work adaptation XD
"bro i have to go" "oh ok go Where?"    SELF ISOLATION
I think when corona was choking the T cell and asking where the lung department was is a Star Wars reference
Lmao 🤣
I imagine part 2 being the vaccine entering with doom slayer armour and a shotgun
Eyo, this the guy in tiktok
What pneumonia
Akatsuki wa tsudota
I never got news that there was a Cells at Work Liveaction  damn.
Idk my t cells seemed to fuck it up pretty good
That make me remember that anime "Cellwork"....
Corona: _exists_ My allergy pills and _The Flintstones_ gummies: *Allow us to introduce ourselves*
Sasta two side gamer ka ritik 😂🤣
It's a virus.... Not bacteria
Y’all really think the vaccine is the only option to stop the virus?
Tronic patrol of this but let’s do not let the Covid win
I can't believe this guy upload leaked Cells at Work Black season 2 video
This is definitely overreacting this is normal it’s just every virus your cells need to have time to build immunity against it naturally
You should do what really happens when you take a sauna
This is exactly like cells at work
Cells at work live action remake?
Bro it's either you or the body everytime they kill the one cell for the greater good
Why does rona looks like he haven't slept in decates
Lmao
Lol
Lol anyone remember "blood cells at work" because this remind me of that😂😂😂
😂
Can you do a video about " What happens when you get the covid vaccine"
Whats that guys name who entered the room
love this low cost hataraku saibo/cells at work live action adaptation
That's akatsuki jacket was cool
It was soo funny when t cells was hitting bacteria 😂😂😂
If my friend came over during the pandemic and coughed on me, saying "I've just been kinda sick lately" I would kick his ass like a T-cell on bacteria.
😆😂
Except Corona didn't do shit to me, like absolutely nothing, I only found out through donating blood
Pneumonia outbreak! "Oh, my bad!" 😂😂
Starwars be like
This makes corona looks cool ngl
😂😂
Do a video of swollowing gum
Akatski
The "Rona"!!!???!! 🤣😂🤪🤣🤪
No this is wrong white cell treat him as friend.
Start the body
Will smith?
O my hees big
Virus is smaller than white blood cells
My white blood cells must be JACKED😂
Amazing 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Nice
Wish this was an episode of cells at work
What does the people in the body of the sick person do when they get get sick and have rona
I love cells at work
To nie istnieje lol
it's like a teaser of a covid movie keki, release full movie wen
The real thing is that Corona infect the immune system' and the immune system' Will mad and self destruct and die and killing ur own boddy
Cells at work but real life anime ver.
It's not like the white cells can't beat it but because they cannot discover it.
Nobody:  The vitamin gummies I ate 6 years ago: *giga Chad*
I actually have corona virus with symptoms
You guys need to have a Jim T cells so you can beat down viruses harder..... or just drink T cell red bull XDDDDD.
😂😂😂 jeesas! That wig on the rona maaaan! 😂😂😂
Fuck that’s how my name is pronounced “rona”
😀❤🇬🇧
I like these videos theyre like cells at work
Syringe with antibody : BREACH TO THE WHOLE BODY INCLUDES @SS :v T cells, have you seen a rona using black shirt?
Lmao at the end
My experience with covid. O no it's an virus white blood cells get that guy out of here. sir yes sir a 1day anime fight later we killed him sir. Good job now we have the information from his corps
U guys  r great 👍
He makes us learn but in a funny way. Teachers should try this
That one guy making that start the body joke in the comments: 00:10  The green guys you
Anybody who is under 65 and has no medical issues: -Corona: Let me go to the Lungs.  -Body: Oh I am under 65 and perfectly healthy, stay put until my immune system studies you and kicks you out.  -Corona:Yes chef, sorry chef.  All jokes aside, sources: CDC, WHO, NHS, VAERS.  If you are under 65 years of age and have no medical issues then your chance of dying of Covid is at 2%. With the new Variant Delta your chances are only at 1.3% as its less deadly yet more infectious.
Nice mannnnn
Haha this is so funny!
U can watch cells at work on bill bill its an anime so it doesn't get boring
The second one looked liked he touched it with hands
I like the way you gave a real life understanding and mad it something funny and light.
But when u have the dead corona in ur body and then the really corona comes in the white cells DEFEAT THE CORONA IN ONE HIT
“My bad..”
At the start is pennywise
I'm watching this and I have covid
This world shall know bacteria
Corona:where lung white cells:Hey i know you your dangerous corona:Shoot he got vaccinated run
Is this "cell at work" anime
Imagine dying to That lol
The anime be like
Cells at work creators- write that down  write that down
when the internet is more educational than our school
That akatsuki jacket
Vaccine be like:time to die nerd
Corona isn't really near immune to antibodies, it just manipulates the body into basically using the nuclear option with damages the lung cell membrane aswell, basically corona convinces you body to carpet bomb everything
Is that an Akatsuki robe?
Yo you funny
Why is corona kinda
My boy wearing Akatsuki outfit
I'm watching this with corano. You ok white blood cell?
That means the T cell in my dad's body..was DAMN STRONG 💪
“He’s gonna cause pneumonia” “You dont know dat” *outbreak* “..my bad.”
I hope our cells do not get any crazy idea and make nuclear weapons
Idk call me cruel but this disease affects the elderly the most, and the elderly control the government here in the us. I say spreading it rampant.
Part 2 ples
Bad timing for me
why dis is a good show 🤣 but wow
Bruh that's so fricking funny,it makes me want to watch the anime cells at work
oo
Now the red clouds on the akatsuki jacket truly mean death.
This kid gets it
Qory gore?
I've had the Corona this didn't happen to me
Your videos are so funny😂😂
Akatsuki will see this and they will commit suicide
Pneumonia
No one's gonna talk abouth that he wore akatsuki dress
*My bad*
But after vaccine
This reminds me of the anime called cells at work
This would not have happened if he ate those Flintstone Gummies
I know that guy what's his name
Cells at work Live Action at home
the only thing author missed is that corona is very vulnerable. its just a ball of fats and proteins  its not even alive
After this video I think you really dont know how a virus works and how small they are 😂
"You don't know that!" *alarm sounds* "Muh bad" Me when I do something stupid
cells at work live action
iTs cArOnA TiMe
My bloods and body would just accept the rona
Rona isn't a killer, idiots just died out of fear!
The guy in the Akatsuki clothes must be Itachi with all that coughing 😂
U r wrong....T cells can fight corona virus🦠😷 easily but they don't know that corona virus🦠😷is a threat for our body
Cells at work isn't real it can't hurt you. Cells at work in real life
Lol, its not that strong
Clothes in the body 😂😂🤣🤣
Thats completely wrong hoe the fck did the first guy get out of his house and caught corona when with that naruto outfit he should stay in from of the pc without showering.
Is Will Smith your daddy?
I've been in direct contact with corona and still have yet to be infected, guys.
Trash
Good content. Great job!
The covid guy looks emo lol
Damn white blood cells stop snitching
Wow incredible man
This reminds me of cells at work great anime if you haven't seen it really teaches alot about the human body
But this isnt how corona works when it enters ur body.   But entertaining..
"My bad" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When a bio student becomes a youtuber
White Blood Cells can't fight a new virus that's in the body if the body never has memory of it. That's why you should take vaccines, they inject part of the virus into your body that says to your cells: "Hey! I'mma annoy you, you better remember me or I'mma annoy you more!"  Actual Corona: "Ok, reproduce, damage, repeat." Your cells: "HEY I KNOW YOU!"
anime adaptation Hataraku saibou
Legends notices akatsuki
My dad's brother is fighting Corona is in australia
next time the vaccine will come and kick out the corona.
Lol this cell at work the anime
0:12
Can't wait for the Vaccinated version
99.8% survival rate don't spread panic
This is what elon musk imagination future of learning should be fun🤓🤓🤓
Thats wrong, the Corona Virus gets eliminated as well, if the imune System is strong enough
Hey man is he good
"My bad-"
Corona is weak and pneumonia is caused by infection due to the negligence of doctors who purposely kill client to up the corona cases
Na coronaz just as weak as every other beatable disease
Tbh this is what it feels like even with the vaccine.
Icatski guy
My bad
Now I know what happens when you get Corona that's why you get the vaccine so at least your white blood cells know what to do when it attacks and does some sort of damage against the virus
*The new season of cells at work looks great*
Much wala mythpat 😂
This reminds me of Cells At Work 10/10
The way he said my bad 🤣
Man Dat rona is tough
My white Leykocydes: hello corona!  After 5 seconds: goodbye and and don't see you later!  *kicks from the door*
-laughs in covid-  Yeah no ⟟ lost my smell and I’m hot af all the time cause of rona 😭🤚🏻🤚🏻🤚🏻
The fact is our cells want a fan
When it said "where is the lung department" Subtitles said "where is the london park"
😂😂🤣😂
The bacteria is getting obliterated
Itachi got the rona and died
lmao i imagine that happened inself of me when i had corona
Corona VS Ibuprofen
Dude, you confused covid with jason dean
Tbh the rona is much smaller then T cells irl
In my case it was more like: Wheres the smell and taste department? I cant smell a thing and I can just taste a little bit now.
A FUN WAY TO LEARN BIOLOGY :)
I love this series 😂😂😂😂
Everyone : concentrating on the video  Me: he was an akatusku
Haha
Cells at work looking different these days
What If teachers is like this 🤣lol
Wait Till Goku Whitecell Come Out
😑
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I. Had covid 19 like a couple of months back I gues this what happind when I had covid 19 it was painfull
You don't know that
I love how corona be like the Darth Vader lol 😂 and the bacteria get kick in the face 😂
"Hopefully you dont got the *rona* "
Cringe
it's also a great segway into how the vaccine works, basically it's corona but a dead form of it and it basically trains the white blood cells to beat the actual corona
HEBREW 13:5  NEVER will I leave you  never will I forsake you.
My body threw it out the window
It's like yamcha vs SSJ Goku
My bad..gold🤣
Akatsuki have corona 😂
Do you watch cells at work?
Woah akatsuki
Dearest Iamdices, A message from the medical community: CORONA DOES NOT CAUSE PNEUMONIA, RATHER IT IS A SIDE EFFECT. If anyone doesn’t understand or disagrees please ask me to expand on this.
I’m still waiting for the time in class where the teacher asked where I got my information from, just so I can say “ *…It’s complicated…* ”
That's not actually what happen. The coronavirus is not that strong. It just hyper-activate the white blood cell, causing it to cause severe damage to our own cells....
Next time what really happens to corona if you get vaccine
Put the vaccine makes those cells stronger so they can beat up the corona,
“Down the hall, to the left”  Smart. Smart.
Any one notice that guy was wearing Akatsuki dress from naruto
nah that ain't it chief. If this was the case we'd literally all have died within a few months at lost.
Pls upload a video that how vaccines work
Uh sorry the body actually think it is a friend
My bad
He has akatsuki  items
The 👑🦠           |.    |           |.    | Corna  Virus
Can we just appreciate that he got them Akatsuki member shirt
The fact that I'm seeing this when I have the delta....
U caught yur neck by yourself lol
Tbh this just feels like cells at work but with more episodes but they are short
I'm starting to wonder where those killer T cells are at, vacay?
You Don't know that😅😖...... 😳My bad
This guy's literally awesome!
Too easy
actually covid is not immune to the atacks of the t cell theyre just pretending to be friendly cells and once the virus gets out of control then the t cells react
Anime cell at work right
Is it itachi
Solid home alone reference "down the hall and to the left"
Ayo one of them just moaned
When you realize that T Cells are traitors.
موسيقى واثم وكذا يعني
موسيقى واثم وكذا يعني..
What about ur cells body and ur cells cells body what happens in their
Me with corona : im going die Me now: i lived with no des T cell: boy you mess with the wrong body.
I like the Akatsuki cloak
I think the white blood is in guy's body
To the left, to the left  Down in the hall and it's right to the left🎶 loll
T-Cell sounds like a rapper name
He should do one where the cells are actually strong enough for the rona or even with it’s strength
Lol
Vaccine: *approaches*  Rona: why do I hear Boss music?
cells have an esophegueus? 😐🙂😅😀😃😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh lol
When the vaccine get injected: "Beats up the Corona Virus" White Blood Cells: "Ohhh, so that's how you do it"
They should literally turn this into a high budget film of what happens when: etc
The way he wore an akatsuki robe was hilarious
No ones talkin bout the akatsuki outfit..
Sad story about this my mom and dad got Covid-19 and I’m a child help
The akatsuki got them corona
Rona just really wanted the bathroom. Cuz all of em are down the hall to the left.
Akatsuki ❤️
The last part had me laughing!
That happened to dad
Plot twist: he got the Rona when he touched him
It's so funny how inside the body, it just starts with T cells beating up the bacteria.
My grandfather die fue to covid and pneumonia🥺
T cells don't fight viruses or bacterias B CELLS DO
Funny how the security cells in a person’s body all wear Nike shirts
Now what he gonna be like for the rest of his life “crona virus!”
Ok 1. awsome vid and 2. WAS THAT AN AKATSUKI JACKET FROM NARUTO THAT I SAW!?!?!?
The 'rona: Where's the lung department? T-cells: *grunts* down the hall to the left. The 'rona: *goes down the hall to the right*  🤣😂🤣
😂😂😂 oof!
pac man shirt
Vaccine: ayo when is the time when i am shine i'm still wating here
Maruto the best mane
Why does he have an Akatsuki jacket from Naruto
Its like cells at work
so cool
“Great, now he’s gonna cause pneumonia”  “You don’t know dat” *alarm saying he’s get pneumonia*  “My bad”
In reality corona is actually weaker than u thought 😒
"Ma bad"
Hey it's like one anime called cells at work..
Looks like I downloaded the wrong cells at work
Think a better way would basically ww2 thousands of rona and thousands of t cells
not really your body gets tricked and thinks that the corona is a cell but still kinda funny tho
Did any one notice he weared Akatsuki dress
Lol
"My bad" Me: He'll ded
I might be wrong but down the hall and to the left is a home alone 2 reference?
GOOD!
this is like a cells at work anime HAHAHAHAH 😂
Too easy
I love how Corona is basically Darth Vader
But it seems like more people are A symptomatic and if Rona was so bad why did the guy who gave it to you just have a cough and the whole world is going crazy because of this jeeez brainwashing
Did the guy commanding the guys and pulls the mid finger pointing towards the corona sideways man why did you have to do that for?
You don't get CO🅱️ID-19 from touching somebody 🙄
U should be grateful hidan is your friend
I have been positive for 5 days now
This is a recreation of my fight with the cover of the bottle
WHERES PART 2

I feel sad for thath guy
NOPE. With A LOT of vitamin c i got threw corona with only a small headache for a single day. :)
He turned right not left
the captions though pls "where is the London park" jsjs
Which is why the vaccine is created
Yoooooo I have that same PacMan shirt
Vaccine:it’s my time to shine
I watched that one ion tiktok

Legend has it, that wasn't rona, that was just McDonald's food entering your body.
What the akatsuki also have corona
Just do it on your shirt means a killer say that because the next video
Vaccines
kindof more like tcells dont know what cor0na is
This is so educational
🤣😂😂😂
captions: mmm yes i think he said London park
The rona went to the right lol 😂
My other man drippin with the Akatsuki coat
At the beginning who thought that was sanko for a min
Bad I have it
Star Wars lol
Oh sh-
So we just gonna ignore that the person that was sick had a Naruto jacket & a Naruto mask ( ╹▽╹ )
Wow they should’ve turn this into a movie with only the body scene and the Coronavirus that n the body invading the all cells
Lol
GG
Covid is more like rusted armor Bacteria
Not accurate
Nice Akatsuki shirt
"Just do it"
I love how T-cells said "my bad" at the end 🤣🤣
I didnt know Corona was the terminator
The reason they couldn't hurt Corona was because they didn't have the defenses for him/her/it #genderequality
The Boston area noticed that and there’s a huge why do you choking him
THISE ATAKATSKI CLOTHES ARE FIREEEEE MANNN
My bad-
WE NEED MANY WHITE BLOOD CELLS MERGED TOGETHER YO CREATE A SUPER BLOOD CELL
Cells At Work be like:
Has anyone else getting cells at work vibes
😹😹💔 This guy
now we know why the akatsuki are villans
Corona:  do u know who i am Bactira:  no Corona:   I AM UR FATHER Bactira:  real sh*t?
I just done with corona 1 week ago ... send me to the next !!!
Wait so if the lung deparment is on the hall to the left... theyre fighting in the nose?
Actually this is what I imagined when I was little....like there are departments of the white blood cells😁😁
Ackrding to the cancer cell video theres like 100 more T cells ready to go
Cells at work live action looking good
So we not going to talk abt the bacteria getting fucking destroyed at the beginning?
I wish my science teacher could've taught me science this way.
I love this guy.
Is this a colab with Dtay.Known?
Why he wearing the Ikatski cloak
Huh didn’t knew Cells At Work! had a live action adaptation.
Me with the Rona: Corona enters body  T-Cell: what’s poppin  Corona: where.. is.. the lungs.. Corona replicates to the head and digestive system T-cell: oh god what do we do Other t-cell: just wait till 10 days and we will attack Corona: time to make him feel pain Fever, vomit, difficulty breathing etc.
My bad. I died 😂😂😂💀💀💀
0:00 I HAVE THAT SAME SHIRT NO WAYYYY!!
These must be really fun to film lol
Love this guys stuff..puts effort into creating some thing funny...dude cracks me up..😁
How things in your body actually works in a simplified way and funny👌
I have never had shortness of breathing whenever I had or didn’t have COVID
Yo just relaised but his akatsuki mask is the same as mine
No one?          Crona punching himself 0:27
Please do what happens when you go into a coma
Lol as i was a rona patient,I can confirm this is true
Tbh why is all directions in peoples homes in sketches or movies “down the hall to the left”
This turned into an anime in the first 5 secs. ❤️
🤣🤣🤣
the quiet kid of germs
Everyone: Bacteria being beaten up   Me: JoJo part five
He got that akatsuki jacket and now he's wanted by the Shinobu police force during war bc he was reanimated by kabuki  Edit by Leo/  im a girl: tysm! For the likes!
make with the immune system
Did anyone see the coat he's wearing  NARUTO VIBES
*the rona*
When he grabs the T-cell it just shows his power
These ,"body" videos are some of my favorite items on the entire Internet.
Wait so since there’s a T-Cell who says they have an oesophagus then that means that in this universe people have smaller people on them who do things that cells do
Idk why but you remind me of will smith
yo make a when u drink redbull
Research the PCR test (the test being used to diagnose covid). It was never intended to diagnose anything. Research it (not via Google though, they censor the truth, search via 'Qwant' search engine). There is even video footage of the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, stating that it was not designed to diagnose illnesses & that it was being used incorrectly. Because it relies on CT [Cycle Thresholds], which basically magnify whatever molecules they are looking for & if they magnify it enough, they'll always be able to find anything within anyone. You see the CT most countries are using is way above what is reasonable, so when the CT they use is say, 35 or above, the chances of false positives are ridiculously high. This plandemic is based on false positives due to the PCR test & massively over-tested populations. As well as incredibly inflated case & fatality rates, due to the extremely broad requirements to diagnose a 'covid case'. Those with anything remotely similar to covid are recorded as a positive case, regardless of whether or not they were even tested. And then of course, there's those who were tested without symptoms, but who came up as positive due to the incorrect use of the PCR test. Also, in regard to death rates, anyone who died, whether or not they actually died FROM covid or WITH covid, regardless, it's recorded as a covid death. So even if you were terminally ill or say, in a car accident.. if you tested positive for covid at the time; it would be recorded as a covid death. There are loads of families suing due to incorrect causes of death being documented on their loved ones death certificate.  Another shocking fact that has falsely inflated the covid case rates, is how health care workers have to be routinely tested & if they are positive they have to be tested multiple times until they come up as negative. Then they often need X2 neg results. Problem is, each time they receive a positive result whilst awaiting their negative result to be able to return to work, EVERY SINGLE POSITIVE result is recorded as a NEW case on the system. This has been the case with the CDC in the US, as well as the NHS database in the UK & also other countries such as NZ, Australia & Canada. Nurses & Doctors, even scientists are speaking out, but if you only watch the mainstream media or mainstream social media platforms & only search via Google; then you'd be none the wiser. But I truly believe even if ppl haven't dug deeper into the truth of what is occurring worldwide.. the majority of ppl with an IQ above 100 can smell a rat. Most people know that something is not right, even if they're not sure exactly what. If this is the case for anyone reading this, I implore you to do your own independent research, (again, do it via non censored search engines like QWANT). There are loads of medical & scientific professionals who are speaking out. You can find them on alternative video sharing platforms like 'LBRY' & 'BRAND NEW TUBE' & 'BRIGHTEON' just to name a few places to get started. Also check out 'Childrens Health Defence' & 'The Highwire' with Del Bigtree as well as Dr. Carrie Madej, (a very notable Doctor who really knows her stuff) & Dr. Sherry Tenpenny & Dr. Vernon Coleman. Again, these are just a few of the thousands of professionals from the medical & scientific community who are speaking out with facts, stats & evidence to support a very different narrative to that of the Government & mainstream media. (Infact, there are large alliances that have been formed.. some within particular countries & others worldwide. Some of them, like the World Doctors Alliance & Health Freedom Alliance have thousands of members; all certified medical professionals). They're out there, you just need to make the effort to find them, due to the massive increase in censorship & suppression of truth (which on it's own should be a big red flag to cause ppl to begin asking questions). Those who are wise & care about the future of the next generations, should most certainly not take this lightly. Do what you wish with the info I've shared, but know that it comes from many months of quality independent research (I don't take the word of others, I triple check everything myself & cross reference everything). Also, my recent research is in addition to 15-20yrs of research into Government corruption, the hierarchy of power, elite globalists & eugenicists, elite secret societies, Freemasonry, Rosicrucians, Illuminati, Silicon Valley, history of politics & war (real & fake), the Federal Reserve, Central Banking systems, the Military Industrial Complex,  Maritime & Common Law, the Court systems, Big Pharma, Big Agri (agriculture), GMOs, vaccines, theology, philosophy & biblical theology, history, the Occult, Alchemy, DARPA, HAARP, CERN, Operation Mockingbird, MK Ultra, World Economic Forum, the United Nations, the New World Order & the 'Great Reset', amongst other topics not commonly discussed in mainstream society. (You won't acquire this knowledge at your indoctrination centres, otherwise known as schools). So it's safe to say I have a solid foundation of hardcore research to have built on regarding the current situation over the past 18+ months. I can't say I was surprised by the current agenda, infact there were many ppl who have been expecting this orchestrated 'global crisis' for some years now. The elite have said for decades that all they needed to implement a New World Order, was the right kind of crisis. Well, they got their wish (or manufactured it). The question that remains is, will the masses wake up from their socially engineered reality & highly indoctrinated submissiveness or is it easier & more comfortable to remain in a constant state of cognitive dissonance & live a pre-programmed existence?
Where is the lung department? My subtitles : where is the London park?
'my bad' that's like,, too much relatable
Your videos are brilliant. I’m sure this will help kids and adults learn about the body. 🥰
So im Just gonna be here appreciate g his friend has an akatsuki shirt
Dude I just now realized that this whole series is based off of Cells At Work 🤯
Ok but i’m obsessed with that dudes Akatsuki outfit
Now I can learn science easily
*Everybody else talking about something else Me: is that an Akatsuki cloak
No trynna be racist but we not gunna talk bout how we can literally see through this mans skull👀💀
*"WHERE IS, THE LUNG DEPARTMENT."*
🧢
XD the way he said- "My bad"
I like how the cells have completely no gravitational force
You know that the symptoms are caused by our own body fighting the virus and not by the virus, right?
I have a suggestion: What really happens when you get Corona, but you’re younger
Where do I go to get your friends jacket
Corona has no expression that’s so weird 🤣🤣🤣😂
420k. Nice
Imagine seeing this in the microscope
I am a kid so if I get corona how do you spell like I’m sick I have a cold but you know wait a minute do I have corona or the code if I have corona I was just hoping to do some cool
Corona from a lab came into a human lab or cells
Pain I thought you were dead
He do be rocking the akatsuki shirt lol
It sucks because I just got rona
I swear the corona virus is like Draxx from Osmosis Jones.
Keep the good work
I really like your bone videos and your Rona videos because they make me learn about the body
This guys videos are educational and entertaining at the same time and I love it
He makes learning fun
Me who doesn’t have any white blood cells :💩
He is in akatsuki.   Son : how akatsuki died? Dad: akatsuki has corona
Do the T cells have T cells in it since it’s a whole seperate body? Plus, the T cell said it had an esophagus.
Great news the Lord Jesus christ is coming soon repent ask God to help you repent accept the LORD Jesus christ as your Lord and Savior you will be saved,,,,
What Rona does in mah body.   Rona: Where's the Lung Department?    White blood Cells: Sir this is a Vampires Body.... You can leave now if you don't wanna get Slayed by the Vamp Cells    The Vamp Cells: Get the hell out   Rona: Who the fjxuck are you?    Vamp Cell: You can consider me 230 million years older than you.
It's fine because he said "My bad"
Someone will an animation out of this... the corona vs white cells... but its anime
2021 can defeat corona
The t-cell said they had an asofogus which begs the question, do cells have cells?
Fact or something idfk I pretty sure that it not that the white blood cells cant hurt covid19. It's that they dont recognize it. And thus dont try and stop it soon enough
He said my bad like it was a little bit bad 👎
John 21:25: "Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them was written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."  Amazing huh? 😏
My bad.
Do one with the Corona vaccine vs Corona
bro my dude met up with the akatsuki like the akatsuki have corona in not a good thing for naruto
Ok but like the akatsuki cloak the friend in the beginning was wearing, like -- 🥺💛😩
Corona be looking like dabi from mha
Acting: on point 👌
😃 hey who else noticed that he was wearing coz play for 1 of the charwcters or someone was cuz look at the beginning its cosplay from naruto
Should've played the ultimate prank and send him to the sphincter
when I had it:  Corona: “so we couldn’t find anybody else so we came here”  My White Blood Cells: “okay but-“  Corona: “and I also took your sense of smell.. but I’ll pay rent!”
The corona's ultimate power is sneaking, not fighting.
this is fun
Do more of this
This is completely unrelated but while watching my cat tapped the screen with his paw and managed to like the video FOR me Edit: he was laying next to the phone
lmao
Hope you don't have the rona
" great. Now he is going to cause Pneumonia." Pfft. You don't know that,🛑My bad.😂
Corona is a main character
CARONA u NEED to wear masks 😷 still
NO WAY THE DUDE'S WEARING AN AKATSUKI JACKET-
What if you been nice to him and let him go to the lung departmant.            The Good Ending:
Cells at work be like:
Wait is that naruto
I’d like to think of the white blood cells as like the military of the body and vaccines as stronger training
Does anyone realize that his friend is wearing akatsuki
I finally see the man who killed my grandpa
You collect masks?! Nice
Weebs: only pays attention to the shirt
Can you give us an unedited video
Oh yes
"Wheres the T department " Enimen:A with no breathing*
Akatsuki don't get sick easily, you liar
How does he kick himself whilst being down
This is the guy who knows his kidneys
Bruh where did u get akatsuki merch I want that ima be all mangekyou mode and have kisame by my side
..
Love these vids 😂😂😂😂
He’s too depressed to be hurt
That akatsuki jacket looking clean
Well I've got good t cells if all I had was 3 pains in my chest then it stopped
DOES ANYONE NOTICED THE BACKROUND
Okay so okay
LAMO
I love this series
Pshh weak white blood cells
Who has that pac man shirt ✋
NONSENSE, MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS TOO STRONG
“My bad”
corona=impossible to kill
The thing is the immune system actually causes most of the damage to the body when u have rona
Wow
Ma men wearing akatsuki thingy on
My favorite TikToker
CORONA IS GETTING BEATEN UP AND WHAT IF ITS JUST A NORMOL BLOOD SELL IN A CUSTOOM FOR HALOWEEN!?
LOVE UR VIDS
"My bad" LoL
HES WEARING AKATUKI
The "my bad" actually got me good 😂😂
The corona virus is having fun beating up the white blood cells       Until the doomguy becomes a white blood cell
MAKE A TEMANTOR ONE PLEASE
Cells at work non anime version
Ah yes the other guy wears an Akatski jacket that worsens the corona
Whene you look at blood cells😂🖐
The way she just casually said my bad 😂
Does he have a twin som
He’s wearing Akatsuki shit, that should have been your first red flag. We don’t fuck with them!!!
I watch this show called "cells at work" it on Netflix pls check it out i think you love it
Its 11:59 pm and i can't stop laughing 🤣
White blood cell: * punches Corona: *Not funny Didn't laugh.*
AKATSUKI GUY?! SO HE IS THE ONE SPREADING Corona
My bad 🤣🤣🤣
Them: doing the tiktok    Me:focused to that one guy with the akatsuki
Not gonna lie but the Rona do be lookin freaky though
U look like will smith
Keep up the great work dices your teaching in a fun and enjoyable way....just live watching u😘
You sound like the people from the that's Mafia City mad
I dont think he is in Akasuki
hhh
Wht guy walks to someone and openly coughs knowing there is a pandemic?
I love the fact that all these cells are named exactly as they are, and then there's just Ian.
Can u do what really happens when u get over joy
Bacteria: chill bro chill!  Corona: creative mod activate
Nice axes on the wall
why is corona like an anime villain-
Better than cells at work would recommend
My bad
He's going to cause qneumonia Pft you don't know that  pneumonia alert
"Where is the lung department?" "Down the hall the the left!" Didn't get it yet? It's a refrence to Home Alone. The part where Kevin asks Donald Trump for the direction to the lobby!
Dude really funny making these videos 😂😂
he really said the Donald Trump line in home alone "Down the hall to the left"
Didn’t know he was part of the Akatsuki
CORONA only has a 2% death rate though so I mean for most people not really
My bad
My fault og
The akatski is here
*when the T-cells have human esophaguses*
The akastuki
Usually just kill the bacteria
Oh he's fine because he doesn't have Corona he has The Rona..... I'll just leave
Bruh i make rona pass out with all dat weed i smoke😂😂😂☠☠
“Down the hall to the left”  Takes a right after walking through the door
Better to learn Biology this way than in school
My man is a member of the akatsuki that's why he got Corona
Damn I want that matching Akatsuki jacket and mask.
That akatsuki coat is sick
Akatsuki hoody
"My bad" 😂😂
The squeaky sound in the last punch killed me Lmao
T cells and white blood cells are very different
Will heck
I think we more t cells
Anime villain introductions be like-
hello skedadudlers
*thanos has entered the body*
He bout to do all types of damage to your what ? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 bro I’m weakkk
Dat Akatsuki cloak lookin’ good.
Fun fact: corona make your immune system fight against you
the t cells punhing the rona remind me of me tryna jump ppl in my sleep🤣
The squeak killed me 😂😂😂
How many people has been like man he/she/they ain’t gonna do nothing they do it your like my bad
I love how the white blood cell has his own esophagus xD
And then your immune cells destroy your lungs in the process of killing the rona
Hilarious everytime 🤣
i like the casual “My bad.” at the end. They all forgave him after that.
T cells
your body can handel corona
This so wildly incorrect its actually funny 🤣 99% of people immune systems can beat covid 1% can't and will be hospitalized, less then 1% will be at risk for death.
Fire that T-cell.. Haha
Who hates corona give a like on my commet
It makes me laugh that there is cells, inside cells, inside cells, and it goes on forever.
Basically cells at work:
When Corona gets into Darth Vader mode
My favorite anime battle
Okay I do got to admit if you're a kid t cells are overpowered
So your telling me this is happening in my body o shit
“Great now he’s gonna cause pneumonia” “Pfft you don’t know that” *Pneumonia outbreak detected*
okay but like i just love that he is wearing the akatsuki suit thing. stan 💀😭
...thanos
Corona is so op😒
This is my T cells to the rona so basically switch the two
“ma bad”
I like how the freind has a atakusti clothes on
Haahhaha why did he give the directions hahahah
Everyone like for him do a part two
You should make video about what really happens when you cough
Pov of an elderly person with pre exisiting conditions
You are important! Be nice and kind and loving always! You are beautiful just the way you look! You do not need any adjustments to your beautiful body! You do have worth and meaning! you are special! You have value! You are important! Never forget that! Jesus loves you! You do not need abs or to be skinny to be beautiful! Never forget that True beauty, is how big your heart is! Beautiful Brother or Sister!
T cells where’s the thermonuclear bomb pull it up real quick
Before I even watch the video, where did he get that akatsuki jacket though???
The end “my bad” lol 😂
Anyone know about Cell At Work!!
Can we just get the fact dat his friend is wearing an akatsuki robe from naruto
*my bad*
lmao if you have super great immune system this isnt exactly like this
Corona is very serious. It caused my grandma to get pneumonia and a blood clot. She fought it for weeks until she couldn't fight anymore. Wear your masks!
I love the fact the the dude was in an akatsuki outfit
"My bad"
Corona is full on Emo Lookin
Love ur tiktoks!!
An akutsuki with Corona. Inpossible
My bad
The way they beat on that bacteria 😂😂😂
Not the wig💀🤣
My bad 😂😂😂😂
Honestly, getting pneumonia is the best because you miss a week of school but you do miss the Christmas party
Corona is jus the super op villain 💀
Don’t they have a better way of killing bacteria besides beating them up? 😭😭💀
Dose that mean there’s workers inside the workers bc they think a get hit to
Akatsuki!
No one:                                          Me: I like the akatsuki shirt!
You make good videos!
Is this cells at work s3 👀
I like your videos
Hi
Gotta respect the akatsuki suit
Everyone: so funny Me: Is that an Akatsuki T-shirt?! 😱😱
I got the flu start of last year and had a fever storm heated up to 41 C° (very hot) over 5 hours next morning no symptoms or effects. Wasn't vaccinated. Corona can bring it...pussy ass virus.
The only wrong thing is that B-cells fight off bacteria, not T-cells
This guys acting is beautiful 🤩
Except corona is more harmless than the flu
You a pac main?
the coronavirus can infect your cells and turn them
Well it’s not actually that more accurately it avoids all of the innate immune response
The only reason is rare for children to have corona bc the white cells dosent know where is the lung department
This guy is amazing!!
The last line-- "my bad" is op 😂😂
Loving that Akatsuki Jacket
Well i had covid and i recover without even knowing it , :v niigga covid dont work on me
Lol the cells are little people made of cells because he said about his esophagus ._.
Westbrook
Get the killer T cells!!Go Go Go!!
4 more of your videos and Ican graduate from med school
This gives me terminator vibes
My bad
His Bad.
"my bad"
Sick dude got that drip
This is amazing keep making more videos 🔥
“He was gonna do all types of stuff to my Esophagus.”
If cells have body parts, those body parts have to have cells, and if those cells have body parts, those body parts have to have cells and those cells-
Wait do the blood cells have blood cells and do those blood cells have their own blood cells
He said “my bad” 😂
appreciate that akatsuki drip
Am I the only one that heard the moan after they shuck hands
I just wanna know where he got that sick akatsuki jacket
This is not the point of the video but the Akatski✋🏼😂
This guy doing allt his stuff himself is awesome, but I can't help but wonder what his mother thinks he's doing in his room all the time 🤔🤣😂
Hes grate at this
Thx all the t cells that took that didn't snitch
Got to get thoses antibodies
I have covid and I can confirm. This is exactly what is happening.
I LOVE your vids.  Keep up the good work, my friend.  I laughed way too much at this one.  I'm in the recovery ward for you-know-what, mainly because I set up pneumonia.  I'm about ready to take the plastic spoon from lunch and Shawshank the hell out of here!  (And yeah, I took all the precautions, but somebody else didn't.) 😷
It'd be more accurate if the T cells can't see the virus.
The dude in the left looks like Kendrick Lamar
I just tested positive for COVID today and    I’ve had pneumonia 3 times as a baby and I have asthma so
When they said the only Tik toks you actually like
Covid ain’t shit
Better call in the macrophage.
He got the RONA!!?
Dude came in in some Naruto clothes (I forgot who wears it)
Why did I hear boss music when the rona opened that door?
It's like I'm watching "Cells at work" live adaptation
Pneumonia isn’t an outbreak it’s just the word for fluid in lungs
Down the hall to the left
Do you watch cells at work?? I have a feeling you do
Damn the blood cells be racist tho
Bro u should get a teacher have u own class
Bro why couldn’t science just be like this Eveeyone would’ve got A* 🤣
100% inspired from Cells at work👌🤣
How to get there so fast I'm so
Lol its weird how he calls them T- CELLS
0:53 my bad that's funny
Holy shit that Akatsuki shirt is so dope
Hes the terminator bacteria version.
Corona:where’s the lung department. Captions:Where’s the London park.
The hallway scene happens
*"My bad"*  💀🤚
Is that Marcus from Mr beast.?
This is the science teacher that we dream for
Wait how do the white blood cells breath ? Is it an infinite loop?
"My bad" 🤣😂
Love you vid
It was the “he was bout to do all’s types of damage to my Esophagus” for me
I really love you bro!!! 😂😂🙋‍♂️
this series is just cells at work expanded universe and Im okay with that
i swear i learn more from him that my actual science/bio class
Cawonavius
Vaccine when they walk in: *ultra instinct theme*
Me sitting here with COVID 😐😑😐
This reminds me of cells at workz-
Down the hall and to the left!!! Home alone 2 referenceeeee
His robe is from naruto
This vid is Lit!

My bad bro
https://youtube.com/shorts/mRvLAb9er_Y?feature=share
You're good.  You deserve a show.
Coronavirus makes the white blood cells turn against the Bodie it would be really funny if you did that as a bit
When he punches the rona and it squeaked 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Literally happened to me
Corona and caffeine should do something together
The cells have their own cells who have their own cells who also have their own cells
Got that akatsuki jacket 😈🔥
I love this, this is a great short
My bad
I didnt know white blood cells had an esophogus
So we not going to talk about the akatsuki jacket
Haaaa
He should've had the flintstones gummies from 3 years ago
"My bad"
No one's talking about akacuki
My experience with it was a minor fever, some coughing and such. I did breathing exercises and lost a bit of my smell (it’s coming back), but that’s it. I got it from my sister because she was so confident she didn’t have it when she was getting tested she wore a mask (I did the entire time tho) This also goes to show no matter how hard u try to not get it, if God wants you to get the virus you’ll get it. (I refused to go to public places and distanced myself)
Wow that was kinda savage 🤣
T cell: He about to do damage to my esophagus        Me: What if the cells have their own cells, and those cells have their own cells too
Dude I miss this kinda stuff. Anthropomorphism of human body functions. Takes me back to osmosis jones. I used to love that movie.
I’d like to point out that one of the T Cell’s said “He was gonna hurt my esophagus”, does that mean that the cells also have human organs, and that means they’d also have cells
FACTS!😆
You know I feel like I’ve learned way more things from this guy then school 😞
“Where is the lung department?” “2nd floor, 3rd door on the right...”  “Phew man, thank god I have him the wrong address, he could have caused pneumonia!” “Genius! Where did you send him to?” “The hear.....”  Warning: Cardiovascular Disease; Coma; and Total Organ Failure imminent.
Tbh..  This pretty much explains this disease perfectly. Smh
Corona=thanos, T cell=hulk
That is his granny wig on GOD 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  HE SAID RONA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They should put this in an episode of cells at work
This is the live action cells at work
"My bad"
HOME ALONE REFERENCE
My bad
COVID-19: **comes to my body** My white blood cells and T cells: **Kills the COVID-19** My brain: Great job dudes
Omg I have that same shirt love it
No that’s the 2nd shot
Thus guy is amazing 👏👏
This is soo true.
Them t cells be putting in work cause it takes two weeks for symptoms to show
uR bAd -by itsfunneh and the krew
This is if inside your body are humans
Rona: “where’s the lung department” T Cell: “down the hall to the left” Rona: *takes right *
To everyone, ILY and stay safe! :)
Ma bæd
If deadly why kinda attractive?   I must now draw     Corona-Kun
They should show his vids in science class
Funny 🤣😁🤣😁😁🤣🤣😁😁🤣😁😁😁🤣🤣😁🤣🤣🤣🤣😁🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁🤣😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😁🤣🤣😁😁🤣🤣😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣😁🤣😁😁😁 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 i
Haha
Naruto
This man is a Legend and a Teacher.
Corona isn't that strong
Yup
T- Cell"My bad-"  Human Cell- MY BAD WHAT?!
To the people reading this comment God loves enough to allow you to repent in, order for us to be free from sin , repent and go to heaven. PLEASE REPENT NOW
Umm...again.....Its not the T cells that fight bacteria , its B-cells. Lymphocytes are of 2 types - T-cells that fight against 'viral' infections and B-cells that fight bacteria.
I’m liking the akatsuki robe 😏🙃
What about ppl that made it through  without symptoms?  Can you make a vid about it? 😃
Like mahamid ali says if you even dream of beating me you better wake up and apologize
Yo, you fantastic, bro. Keep up the good work. This is phenomenal originality. Reach out to the Dept.s of Ed & Health & Human Services. Your skits can be used in schools all over the world. Great job. God bless you.
This is the only person on tiktok i have ever enjoyed watching a video from
Is no one going to ask when has a akatsuki cloak on.
Keep up the good work this is great
Surely he should be an imposter that makes them multiply
This hurts me more then it makes me laugh. Cause I have all of that right now. 😭😭😂😭
It’s not that bad
Jesus loves you so much ❤️ I was addicted to porn, I was on drugs, alcohol, I hated people, he set me free and he can set you free aswell ❤️ all you have to do is repent and trust in him and he will change your life❤️
Duuude the naruto merch
Now explain why my smell and taste hasn’t came back
Corona is giving me mad sephiroth vibes
Some people can fight of covid tho without getting symptoms
MEH bAD
WEHN ThE VId iS DOnE He BE LIkE AhHhHh
#Scamdemic
He's the type of person that make science class fun
My Bad😂😂
Ayo this would make a good episode for cells at work
Ayo this would make a good episode for cells at work
"my bad"
The fact he just says "my bad" even tho the body could die from pneumonia
Wow. My friends daughter had Covid , now double pneumonia. They didnt give her an inhaler or an antibiotic. Makes me sad because she was on oxygen for 2 days. My son has asthma and we have dealt with many lung infections. Always abuterol, steroid and an antibiotic. Works every time.
*ᵐʸ ᵇᵃᵈ*
That is not what happens when you have COVID-19🦠😷 you feel sleepy and sick it is kind if like a cold but worse
Akatsuki is now corona
Corona is lowkey an anime protagonist
my bad
*Me showing up*DETROIT SMASH!!!! *Knocks corona out of the body
Genius 😭😂😂
Narutooooooo

Only weebs realize the jacket he was wearing
So, I guess I’m binging on your videos tonight. You have a wonderful sense of humor young man, you are truly gifted by God.  ✝️🙏🏼❤️
Rona:*enters my body*  Brain:call . . . Him  *Attention the vaccine infused vitamin gummy has entered the body right after rip & tear plays*  Rona:f***   V.V.G. :rip... AND.... TEAR
I Like This Tiktok Videos Ngl But Not Others

Tcells balls drop when pneumonia hits
Is the Rona more like Superman or Batman?
Ion gon cap he look like will smith
konan itachi  kisame sasori deidara  kakuzu hidan zetsu  pain tobi
OMG AKATSUKI
We and covid are buddy's  I've had it 1 time or maybe more..., not a single side effect.
Akatsuki members cause trouble everywhere they go
white cells: 'my bad.' human cell: death glare. 'youre fired.'
The live action cells at work looking pretty clean no gonna lie
i love how he makes the body seem like a job
Rip bacteria
You don't know that  My bad
At least he makes learning more fun than my actual Biology teacher...
I have survived corona.  My WBCs now: Heck yeah!!
Im laughing so hard right now
I LITERALLY FVCKING SCREAMING WHEN I SAW THE AKATSUKI SWEATER SERIOUSLY LIKE YOU WATCH NARUTO?
You hear from down the halls in the lung department: Damn you Corona!
This nigga got me slick learning about how the body work while laughin.😂 I like how he able to still bring comedy without all the negative dirty energy added into it
*This is cells at work but they continued it*
Get them killer T cells on him
Before the pneumonia alarm snaps, i said speak of the devil.  That part amuses me the most🤣👌
Hope i don't have corona
So dramatic, this needs to made into a movie
My T Cells fucked that boy up.
Why is everything he upload is true???
White blood cells with esophagus😂💔💔💔
He said my bad
I had it and all I got was a sore through I guess my T cells didn’t show them the kind department.... or it’s just a 99.9 percent survival rate and it’s not even as bad as a cold
Try the neck or you want to be weakened
This is cap when I got corona and shook it off like nothing
Jinxed himself-
Now we are ganna blame one T cell for letting the rona take over
That akatsuki robe tho 😂😂😂
He really gave him the: “😐 my bad” treatment

Bro it’s time to upgrade your living quarters. Very entertaining, however I’m a lil ocd with clutter... 🤣😂, I apologize for my opinion in advance.. 😬... 🤔. Who gives a f about my anxiety w clutter and space... 😑
Cells at work be like
Bacteria: enters the body  White blood cells: cmon bois time to gang up on him
Could he beat goku doh
The fact that he’s wearing natuto  merch
As someone who has COVID, I can confirm this is how it happens
I don't mean to raid on anyone's parade but the cells don't know they're being killed when they're being infected...     Love your stuff tho bro
The rona bacteria looks high
I had corona and this describes it really well😅
BRO RESPECT THE DRIP MY GUY AKATSUKI FOREVER

Somebody walking in my house like that coughing would've been got knocked out lmaooo didnt even have his mask on friend or not get cho ass kicked out lmaooo
This is so scary 😭😭I hope it's not accurate 👀💀
Then that means the body already had problems perfectly healthy people don’t really have that much effects.
LOL!
According to this guy, white blood cells have an esophagus   Very interesting.
The Akatsuki died of mostly so that fits. Not many left alive
That one scene in that one Spongebob episode
Me the whole time : cells at work?
Vaccine after 11 days: *physical damage to corona*
Down the hall to the left   Me but he turned right   Who else noticed
Is he an akatsuki?!
“My bad”  IM DEAD😂😂
CELLS AT WORK!!! If you know you know
Thank God Everyone in the comments is a person with brains
Thruthness
Me: why is there a nintendo Me again: do t-cells play after they are done with their work😂
Not me obsessed with anime and now watching cells at work because of this dude xD
"my bad."
You’re acting like corona is a strong as the black death, wake up
Ive watch this 3 times now
His videos teach me more than science class lol
This dude is a legendary person
I- is that the akatsuki outfit-😀☺️
This dude can legit make one minute tiktoks of cells at work live action and I can still pay him big.
That's what you get when hanging with akatsuki...😔
Wbcs having an oesophagus now?
Not true but entertaining.
"My bad" 💀
‘My bad’
That wig is gutted
The Corona is basically the Mr. X of bacteria
My bad😂😂😂😂too funny!  And the Akatski at it again huh!!!!
Broooo your my favorite tictoker , keep it going
“He’s gonna cause pneumonia” “Pft, you don’t know that.” I have this kind of conversation with people all the time
"my bad"
That squeak when he punched him 😂 Literally the exact feeling every dream I have that requires me to fight someone.
This is comedy
lmao wait i had pneumonia a week after christmas in 2020... i think this is how it happend
covid is only lethal to old people, kids and people with a weak immune system
Akatsuki
Does his skits remind anybody else of the movie osmosis jones
My experience with the Rona:  My white blood cells: sir this is a Wendy’s  Rona: understandable, have a good day
Make more
Now try to do a meningitis crises
You should do one when the body dies
When you snitch
The
Clearly my t cells are overpowered cause I've never been sick
“Down the hall, to the left” Could that be a Home Alone reference??
Maybe if t cell didn't beat up rona maybe rona would be nice and just leave
I love these vids" 😎👍
As my test comes back today saying I’m positive
Corona I like your hair 😏
I love this guy
His house is not a normal house it's body organgs
Daily update get the vaccine! It doesn’t do any harm my whole family got it no side effects
What happens when the body dies do the T cells just go down with the ship😂
Lol
This just makes me think of cells at work
This is like inside out but better
my bad
These corona videos r actually funnier than I thought 😂
It’s always the T cells that just has to say it. LikE bRo HavE yOu nOt lEarNt yOur LeSsOn?!? xD but seriously though this is as good as Cells at work nice job 👏👏
In the beggining of every one of gokus fights
Lol😂
Ypu should do one when you're phone gets a virus or something
Lol at the beginning he has the same mask as my cousin
I love these
He wearing an akatsuki coat remaking cells at work 🤣🤣
This reminds me of “cells at work”
When he said give me the directions to the lung department i remembered the first episode of Cells at work
The squeak tho
This man make me think of the anime "cells at work" while watching his videos
Lmfao
I love theese
Love your videos
Actually what you should have done, is once Covid-19 comes in he drops a smoke bom to confuse the t-cells who then attack the lung cells, it would have been funny, and more accurate.😁
Its like omasis jones lmao
Bro why does your T-Cell have an esophagus?
The akatsuki drip
Cells at work but its netflix adaption
“Great now he’s gonna cause Pneumonia” I do t know why but I laughed so hard at that😂
“Oh my bad” Lol
Meanwhile My body...coughs for half a day then "Oh imma alright" x'D
Just how he said my bad got me laughing so hard
That’s what Goku be like 😂
Order 66 simplified.
Nah bro this is not how corona works
T cell i thought you were better than this. I'm not mad, just disappointed 😪
Is this a reference to the anime cells at work
And then after the vax when corona enters, T cells will go into this flashback where they lost all their comrades and its time to strike back
Uhhhhh
Btw I know this is a joke but the actual reason it’s hard to get better from corona is not because it’s really strong it’s just really good at hiding and it really hard for you t-cells to find it, the reason why you feel so sick is because your body is trying to do everything to find and kill it
E
Sweet Home season 2 be like...
Cells at work netflix adaptation confirmed
COVID is technically sexually transmitted because you can get COVID on your  then do the nasty
Ive had rona and it was literally just a cold
😭😂😂
"My bad"
The human body is like the game imposter...
this is what my teacher teaches me, but a way better job-
That squiky noise when tcells punches him like nothing
Thats why I gotta teach my white blood cells the rasangan.😂😂😂
Rona: oh mai wa mou shindeiru T-Cells: NANI-
I guess my cells are fucking superman then
Akatsuki members konan itachi kisame sasori deidara zetsu hidan kakuzu pain tobi and the new member lol😂🤣
The akatsuki is now assembled
Its completly true
"My bad-" Bdkzhdjxj I can't-

Lowkey kinda looks like will smith🤣
Darth rona

Lol my mom calls it “the rona” too I thought she was the only one!!
Dam when the white cell said my bad it maid me laugh hard
Thxs i rlly curious what will happen♡♡
Did anyone realize that he’s wearing an Akasuki      type of jacket..???
This is medically inaccurate for 99.7% of the global population
"My bad"
Admins vs hackers be like:
It's helping me in the biology exam..thanks dude
so no one gonna talk about that guy's 𝘈𝘬𝘢𝘵𝘴𝘶𝘬𝘪 shirt
My bad... 💀😂
Am I the only one who gets triggered around sick people now? I used to be okay with anything now a simple cough will send me off
Rona are the MC
Me:ok T cells you got this  Corona:-_- T cells:my bad
Now the lung people have to fight
Probably should have told the address to the excretory department...
The naruto reference-
YESS NARUTO REFRENCE AKATSUKI OUTFIT
This man tall and he reminds me of a you g willsmith
Why his videos kinda like Heath class but funny
When Akatsuki gets corona:
“My bad” 🤣🤣
Cells at work 🙃😂
Ya mans hoodie where do i get
Well his friend was apart of the Akatski if that’s how you spell it
This should be a anime called cells at work
Sorry, the first thing I noticed was the Akatsuki shirt.
Coronavirus isn't that strong our bodies can fight it but it replicates fast so it takes awhile to get rid of it
0$ says that everytime I need to go to the bathroom I can just go down the hall to the left
If its tail is waging and comes to u then it means it wants to play but if it's a dangerous dog then make a run for it
I bet whoevers body this is one day their just gonna go to a business meeting and hear tiny voices inside him
My bad
Did anyone notice this was a Star Wars reference
I thought corona said “where’s the laundry department“
Ah yes the akatsuki
OK... That guy's funny!
then for the fat ones that make a a shet tons of t cells covid: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH my t cells: slaping goes brrrrrrrrrrrr
Cells at work live action remake
I love these vids now I really know what happens in ur body when u catch or hurt somthing
Bruh, I love that jacket lmao
I love osmosis jones
Actually the white blood cells create antibodies
Let's get this man q Netflix series
I feel like this would make a great version of the office 😂
Soooo true
When you realize the man bestfriend where atuski(iforgot what its spell lol)  *Me brain cell do you about this* *Yes hun*
No one's talking About the T Cells wearing a shirt named "Just Do It"
When he wears an akatsuki jacket: Naruto fans: mangyeku sharingan 👁️👄👁️
I like the akatsuki hoodie
You don’t know that xd
This is like cells at work
Uchiha black akatsuki
I feel like there would be more cells and theyd be slightly more affective tbh
Lol 😑 👀 my bad
Cells at work live action confirmed?
Is this the live action Cells at Work movie?
He is the black man  version of itachi if u know what I mean
*sicko mode intensifies*
Down the hall to the left is that a Home Alone 2 ref
Cells at work be like 😂
Hmm wait a minute the choking part looks like darth vader choking the captain of the tantive 4 from a new hope
Lmao just watching the white blood cells beat the crap outta bacteria killed me
And then you get over it in about 12 days and kick its ass everytime it enters your body again
I like the sick dudes akatsuki clothes and mask.
wait stop Jesus died on the cross for us spread the gospel Jesus loves you very much our father is coming turn to him before it’s too late repent and share God‘s word Jesus loves you❤️✝️
That akatsuki rob tho
He said “down the hall and to the left” but the guy turned right.    Unless he meant right down the hall then turn left...     but yeah.
T cells: hold on let me give it a try *Squeaky dog chew toy noice*
literally ac odyssey when an enemy is just 3 levels ahead lmao
"yall missed one" turns around "m§ťçh"
Extremely funny  and clever individual, i enjoy you viedos.
Okay but the naruto merch 😩 Also corona looks so depressed good lord-
I have that Pacman shirt too
I want a series of that real bad
This reminds me of Star Wars
My t cells are like fucking juggernauts.  The rest of my body suffers, however. Narcolepsy and Insomnia. Massive appetite. I need coffee to exist for more than 8 hours. But at least getting sick isn't as easy!
for me it just attacked my sense of taste and smell LOL i had anosmia at first in december and now have parosmia. things i used to like taste awful now. they found the nose and mouth departments ig.
Omg, as a nurse, I find this guys videos hilarious 😂
Anybody else getting some cells at work vibes up in here
Corona is not as deadly as the left make it out to be. Just saying.
Do... Do the cells have people in them too?
When you in a dream
‘My bad’ 😂😂😂
My bad🤣🤣 Dang boy why are you gonna snitch like that
My bad-
I cant stop laughing at these
Nah but young ppl dont die
Well technically, it's not that our white blood cells are too weak to fend off against, but for 2 weeks our body doesn't detect any pathogens, but when it does know that it exist inside us it then will throw certain white blood cells at it until it figures out the correct one to use (like a computer just trying every possible solution).
Imagine saying rona🤡
Yo i have the same shirt.   I know but thats all i have to say.
That jacket is fire
Corona is weak i had that shit and my immune system just acted like it was allergies
This is an anime  Edit - apparently there actually is an anime about blood cells lmao
that one spongebob episode be like:
I feel like this could turn into an anime I would actually enjoy
What about the killer T cells and litterlay EVERY other virus fighting and disease and bacteria fighting cells in the body
Cells at work 2 👀
Enjoy your videos keep up the good work! Soooo funny
Ma bad
Cells at work live action Netflix original
If we see Corona got black air forces on omggggg we gon die
Bruh I fuckin these vids

"CHILL OUT CHILL OUT-"

Bruh he should have known it wasn't a regular bacteria when the boss music started playing...
little feedback, you kinda put too much shaking in your videos
That Akatsuki Cloak Bro
Funny I survived corona and had 0 symptoms
We just gonna ignore his akatsuki outfit?
White cells: I'm giving it all I got     The flintstones gummy I ate 3 ago years ago: *ahem*

Anyone else notice the guys hoodie
It’s ironic since he’s wearing the akatsuki cloak. Someones itachi
That akatsuki robe/hoodie doeee 🖤❤️🖤❤️
Almost 1k comments nice
Wait isnt corina lethal because the immune system overreacts or maybe i got the wrong info.
This reminds me of that one anime “Cells at Work”
This reminds me of osmosis jones.
This is the immune system of someone who has lung issues or immune system defects
I would give someone food and ask if they can taste it before they shake my hand
0.6 percent death rate Corona isn't that strong
"Wheres the lung department" Me: right to your left sir
Thia gotta be an anime
I got Corona and I was fine I also didn't quarantine 2 weeks I waited one then dicided I was bored
That "My bad", I felt it
The Akatski uniform tho
WAIT DO CELL HAVE CELLS
The my bad XD
I HAVE THAT SAME PAC MAN SHIRT-
Some people's t and b cells are stronger and is able to defeat corona tho
Corona do be goin terminator mode on the white blood cells like: W H E R E S. J O H N. C O N N O R. Except: W H E R E S. L U N G. D  E P A R T M E N T.
Hole up, my dude got the Akatsuki cloak on wtf?  Lesss goooo

Do the vaccine
Cells at work IRL version
Akatsuki drip though
WHY THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE WILL SMITH AND SOUND LIKE HIM😭✋
Corona gangster until he injects the vaccine
This dude loved that Cells at Work series
Y white blood cells straight up pull out a cross to the rona, I've been like, right next to it In the same room and it don't like me
THE AKATSUKI IS ASSEMBLED
That T cell will get fired
I had pneumonia
My T cells were strong enough stupid weaklings
Cells at work eh 👀
Yo, I wanna see a vaccine follow up video.
Actually coronavirus is also capable of making your immune system go on a rampage and purge all organisms it can, wether it's your own body cells, or the virus, the immune system will kill everything including its own cells.
This has Cells at Work vibes.
Cells at work is typing*
Pretty sure I had Kung-Flu at the begging of lock down because my friend sat next me for the entire week he had Corona without telling any of us, thankfully I have a pretty good immune system and if kinda just felt like allergies tbh sniffles, coughing and laziness
I like how he went down the hall to the right
*my bad.*
I wonder if he is a medical student, he knows so much about the human body😊
This is like when you sliced an boss multipule times but the boss didnt react bc of the mechanics
Bro holy shit this is good 😂
THESE ARE SO GOOD
You know I think elbow shaking is dumb cuz that's were you sneeze and cough. So that was a pointless rule that they made just for the hell of it.
If i cant have the humans lung department im taking yours
Mean while all I got was a high fever for a couple of hours, cold sweats and lost my sense of taste and smell.
CELLS AT WORK👏👏👏👏👏  this is truly a masterpiece
It’s giving me very much cells at work
Trust me ive had it it SUCKS
This is kinda like that anime “Cells at work”!
Cells at work in a nutshell
*gets the vaccine* white blood cells seeing covid: Buenos Dias f**kboy
This is like cells at work
I currently have corona so it was fun seeing the science of what happened in my body 😂
Behold, cells at work
Except they can beat it up. Fairly easily for most people
Did he just say the rona???????😂 that's what my sister called it and what I'm calling It form now on
Fun and educational 😄
“Corona is now assembled”
"Fake News"
I mean, the rona is really just a flu, which the symptoms aren't fun, but normally you won't die, unless you have another illness
I like every video. I have to subscribe
Lmao just "My bad"
. . . My bad 🤦🏾 😭😭😭
Idk itachi killed people when he had the sickness
He is science student😅😁
Nah yall seem to think it's a super virus or something lmao getting the flu makes you sicker 🤣
this series is kinda familiar oh! its the anime "cells at work " !
haha
I’ve had covid before
You should do what happends when you get a cut
Love the Cells At Work references lol
Hepititus would kill the white blood cells and the whole immune system
“My bad” lol
You have some talent bro
Cells at work 10000
Cells at work nostalgia do be hitting hard
the doctors shit with laughter Mortal people smiled
B cell coming in with that submachine gun
Imagine Code Black had Corona arc.
That one single corana cell caused pneumonia in -0.5 seconds. I'm dying 💀
was that a home alone reference
He need some milk
Osmosis Jones in a nutshell
I absolutely LOVE these videos
Is nobody gonna mention the fact that the sick dude is an akatski member?
I like his akastuki sweater
K-dramas in a nutshell
Cells at Work is on tiktok
😤 covid wishes it could do this to me! You weaklings that only eat vegan food and drink filtered mineral water are fighting for your lives! Me, I used to drink water from the hose at the park, play in the mud and break the 5 second floor rule! So my immune system is super, I've got the healing factor of the Hulk!
My dad had both and so Ik this is true
Human version of cells at work😆
I must be high, I thought that was Will Smith at first
The new season of cells at work looks good
Damn, just got some "cells at work" vibes
my bad
Bro I was dying the whole time but that " my bad " got my on the floor
If this is you than you did not eat dirt as a kid
I learn more here then at school in science class.
In this situation all you need is talk no jutsu and we’ll...... ✨teamwork✨
I wonder do you watch cells at work?
Love how corona looks and seems like the quiet kid
Should do Flu Vs Corona lol
My bad
Ha the tik tok Aus gub
Cells at work got real
I love you
I swear that the guy who gave him corona was Marcus from Mrbeast
Cells at work be like -
Why does he look genuinely sick
I love the "my bad." At the end. XD
Yeah sorry but your white blood cells are just weak, got through it just fine here
*My Bad.*
Pretty sure the t cells wouldn't see the rona. The wu flu is invisible to t cells without the antibodies to trigger the t cells.
That’s not even how COVID works lmao
These videos are cells at work summurised😁
These clips are life
Real life inside body cartoon is the tittle I give this😌😌😌
As a guy who has tested positive. I can agree
So much camera shake I feel nauseous
My sister gets corona me hugs her my immune system be like nah you can’t pass
Cant relate i ate flinstone gummy vitamins for a livin
Modern Osmosis Jones
Corona vaccine be like: boi you THOUGHT
Every fairy tail fight
Reminds me of that anime cells at work
I had it and while it was pretty bad for me, it definitely wasn't like this at all. I'd honestly recommend if you're a healthy person dont be worried honestly.
**Corona** : Where's the lung department? **T cell** : Down to the left...  **Corona literally open the door and turn right**
corona works in mysterious ways, for me it was literally just a light cold. I got it tested cus i didn't belive i had mostly because i could still taste and smell
Idk what to say to this but I got sick and they tested my blood and doctors said that white blood cells r taking over my red blood cells and idk what the hell that is😂 and I'm just sharing maybe someone could help cuz yup I'm dumb😂
Oh _hit
Actually, the virus makes the human cell pregnant and more of itself burst out of the human cell
A t cell worried about his esophagus? Dafuq
Keep making content!!!! Never stop
I had pneumonia before, it was not a good week
This is just any new disease
Bro I've learned more from this guy than I have from school
They need to learn New fighting
Pretty accurate. 😂
Is white cells suppose to have knives
Doesn't it more accurately make them fight eachother?
Mah man watched Cells At Work
Cells at work 2020 edition
Mans needs become a doctor
I love these
I REALLY FORGOT WHAT THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS ARE UNTIL I WATCHED THIS-
My guy got that Naruto drip 🥵
Please keep doing these kind of videos as it's the only thing that makes my day!
Why do i feel like he watched the cells anime?
*"My bad"*
Rona is blown way outta proportion
Your videos make me laugh every time I see it
You forgot to put the part where the corona can also brainwash and turn against the good cells i think that would've been funny
I've had corona Uncle brought it in I felt like shit for a day and then couldn't taste right for 2 months
"Where's the lung department???"  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I loved the fork-hands one
This isn't rona its more like aids
Pathetic
Damn diz was fye ngl bro 🔥🔥🔥👍🏾
Lmao I guess my white blood cells on steroids cuz I brushed that shit off so quick
Omg this reminds me of cells at work 🤣
Corona isn't really that strong. It has a 96% survivability rate, lol.
OOH SNAP WHAT THE WORLD MY BROTHER 👊 KEEP DOING YOUR THANG 👍 LOL 😂 SMH OFF
Bruruh u always think about little brains inside of my brain inside of their brains and on and on
This is a fun way to learn that you can’t recover from the C
Can confirm.  I have covid right now🤣
“Ma bad”😂😂
It's the my bad for me
No one gonna talk about that akatsuki (I think that’s how you spell it) jacket?? Ok. Just me.
lol
This is like Cells at work XD
Sometimes I get distracted and ponder why dude made a checker pattern with soundproofing matts on his wall in the background... but then I return to the skit and focus on dude playing his different characters
Having it sucked but it wasn't that bad as everyone is making it out to be. It's comparable to the flu. Which btw will also lead to pneumonia for people with weak immune systems. Y'all just cowards.
The new Cells At Work season is looking great so far!
it’s always “haha you have corona” and then you actually get it
Cells at work season 2
I got pneumonia for the first time in my life last year and that shit was severe. I
wish after “he was boutta do all types of damage to my esophagus” brain said “HES GONNA DO ALL TYPES OF DAMAGE TO _OUR_ ESOPHAGUS
In fact, the immune system cannot detect the corona virus, that is why the corona virus spreads easily.
Naruto cloud jacket lol
Insert goku ultra instinct theme here
Luckily for me I was asymptomatic so I didn't have any symptoms lol
Fuck that was hilarious.
We have the same pac man shirt
This guy has the most shit immune system man Corona is a shit virus that was made In China no wonder it's so weak
My bad 😂
R u a doctor or something 😂🍃
Me while watching this where did he get the akatsuki jacket
Hahahaa that poor bacteria😂
The guy coughed and then literally fanned it like it was a burp🤨😧🤡
I love the akatsuki outfit also if u want white cells usually i bite my nails and suck my fingers so do that atleast that what i heard
This dude makes Will Smith look like peewee Herman.  Talent..
Fake, the coronavirus will take some days to realize it has invaded. Unless he has a vaccine that was overwhelmed by a stronger coronavirus mutation.
When low budget will smith is as funny as will smith
I'm pretty sure Carona isn't stronger than other viruses, it just spreads more. The same percentage of people who die from it is the same percentage as the flu. But less people get the flu.
so trash
Body cells: 🤬   Corona: 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈👺👺👺👺👺👺🤬🤬🤬🤬
“My bad”
My bad
Thats not what happens it would let it go bye it does not recognize it so
Hahaha I'm dead 😂😂😂
My white cells defated rona after one day
Vitamin c: i keeeell uuuuu
People with really good immune system: *P A T H E I C*
Rona in Military-built Cellular-level Terminator confirmed.
When I watch this all I think of is the anime Cells at Work
I would have lied and said go to the to stomach to die, or the intestines to kill it for good if I where to be placed in that particular situation.
Cells at work vibes
He went right..
True and funny
Man I love these videos
Corona: What you’re back again? I already won! The Body now with the vaccine/cure: *you got the wrong house fool*
Play Doom music and this will make it cooler
The fact he is dressed like the Akutsu makes it 1000 times better.
Bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
this man really said cells at work but make it ✨ live action ✨
Lol cells a work check
Dudes been watching too much cells at work
LOL why did this make me want to cough
the akatsuki cloak tho-
CELLS AT WORK
Wow cells at work season 2 looks really good
Healthy peoples white blood cells be like your already dead
"My bad"
I thought I was the only person who called it the rona
Look guys secret corpse
This is great😂🤣🤣🤣
The only part in this that I think should have been included was it wiping out a bunch of b-cells since covid normally does that allowing things you've been vaccinated for to show up
Osmosis Jones 2.
Cells at work vibes
Just like Chad in bleach
TOP 10 ANIME BATTLES 2021
Love my guys outfit though! He gonna put itachi, pain, kisame, konan, deidara, sasori, kakuzu, hidan, zetsu, and Tobi out of Business!!
Lol this is like how my dad spreaded it to me
Actually our bodies when healthy have a 99% chance of shutting down corona in our system within 3 days :)
Love the real take on shit
You can’t taste anything
Hold up are u wearing akatsuki dress
Theres an anime dedicated for this dude its called cells at work CODE BLACK
Wait can this personified Corona catch a personified Corona of it's own
Nobody gonna talk about him wearing the akatsuki clothes
I'm eating cookies cause I'm sick and it hurts to laugh I can a cold and it's not getting better
◾️,
Cheap game ads be like:
What I learned: white blood cells kill bacteria, Corona is too strong as his immune system is weak, Corona affects his lungs
Wait but doesn’t corona only severely effect old people because their white blood cells are more weaker? I’m pretty sure young to middle age people would survive corona
The white blood cells should say: turn around and walk back
I got covid 19 it was borring i have to go to isolasion
I would say its like almost an equal chance with the corona having 60% of winning the fight
He's wbc: it's too strong I can't do anything  My wbc: is this the coronavirus? bruh  The coronavirus: pls have mercy
Isnt there usually more than two white blood cell things that kill shit like bacteria in your body, like thousands.
Naruto spoilers          Yeah you turn into Itachi then you murder your whole clan then you spare your little brother and fight them and only lose from dying to aids
This is like season 2 of cells at work
For once the Netflix adaptation was good. Congrats, cells at work.
Live action Cells at Work
I love your vids, but just a little nitpick. T cells dont actually kill bacteria, they kill off infected cells. Carona is a retro virus, and if you remeber learning about DNA back in highschool, you'll know that a retro virus is mRNA initiated. Meaning that covid bacterium are literally attaching to our cells and basically giving the ribosomes a special order to make more carona. These infected cells will then be targeted by the t cells and undergo controlled cell death.
I got that same shirt
I bet that you're watching cells at work!
Actaully the t cells can't see the corona virus because its either hiding in a cell or its was reproduced by a cell that got controlled by a Corona virus cell so the t cell thinks its a normal cell that is my theory
This episode of Cells at work seems a little ghetto-
My bad. 😂
Lol. "You dont know that" 😂😂😂😂
Dude probably watched/rewatched Cells at work over a thousand times
That little quack sound got me
Atleast you comprehend it's just pneumonia under a fancy name good shit.
This really giving blood cells the anime vibe
Had rona. Not really what happens but you got the idea
Funny did laugh
This reminds me of the shooting episode in greys anatomy and idk why😭😭😭
Ngl this made me laugh
Wish will smith over here
I love your videos. Informative and fun to watch. Please don’t stop. I share these with my grandkids. 😷🇺🇸
Nah bro I got those One Punch Man t cells
Not exactly
I once had pneumonia twice in the span of 4 months. This was at least a year before corona so yeah, but I got some breaks from school so that was pog
Sigh osmosis Jones did it best.... Convince me otherwise.
Osmosis Jones vibes
Did you know? I am coughing and sneezing but it never means I have corona?
If you are smart what's 9+10 =
Who else kinda learn something every video . or is that jus tha nerd in me
Yo that akatski jacket is nice
There should be one when he's vaccinated
This should be considered educational
GET THE BASEBALL BAT QUICK
This guys watched too much cells ay work... not. That. I. Would. Know. About. That...😐
To me this is sort of like Cells at work but if tiktok had a shitposty version of this.
*“Ma BaD”* pffft yes, it is.
This is so true though covid if you're heathly the body will defeat it. It will also help to get regular treatment even if you're heathly
Wait Itachi was corona all along?!
This is the funniest thing I've seen all day
Should have made him chinese
Ive been waiting for this😂😂 LOVE YOUR VIDS
He do be akatsuki
LOLLLLLOLOLOL
This.... Isn't entirely accurate, what a virus would really do is effectively disguise itself by entering a host cell, however it would leave pieces of it on the outside of the cell in the attempt as part of the bodies immune system tactics, effectively marking the cell for death which T cells will then respond to. Stuff like fever and I think pnumonia are actually caused by the body not the virus as it changes the climate of the body in an attempt to kill invaders like a virus, this tactic is obviously not always effective and also causes harm to the body so even after the virus is killed a recovery period is needed to repair damage we can still function normally during this period provided the damage is minimal.
Rona is not that dangerous its just new and now that its mutating our immune system has a hard time racting but its not like white cells cant beat the rona virus
Part 2 is an all out war that the cells win
Imagine still believing that corona is more dangerous than the flu, like i bet 70% of you all never even got it or even knew
People who had corona and got healed must of had a machine 🔫 🔫 🔫 🔫  in therr
" *my bad* " yeah- that'll fix everything
damn it’s like if goku went against naruto bc naruto would just not do anything to goku
Serious Darth Vader vibes from that corona cell
YO THE AKATSUKI MERCH HABSHH =D
Wow, I didn’t know Cells at Work got a live action remake
I know this amana it called cells at work
It’s a anime just like this and I will never stop loving it
When your white blood cells have an esophagus 🤔
They should actually make a tv show out of this
“my bad”
But if your a kid, the corona be getting bodied
Thus is like the anime blood cells at work
Tbh this reminds me of Cells At Work
I don't think that's quite how it work.
Your body wouldn’t sell out that fast 😆
Nice Akatsuki hoodie.
Except T cells do destroy corona. Only if there are exceptions like weak immune systems
The black one reminds me of Corpes Husband but mean  lmao
This guy is actually good
This is tik tOk but not tik tok
The white cells don’t actually know thsi bacteria 🦠 so they would have let  corona pass to then lungs. I explained it as simple as I could. Nice video anyways
Cells at work in a nutshell when they introduce a new white blood cell:
The «my bad» made me sub and like😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭🤣🤣
My guy is an akatsuki
White blood cell training arc
That’s the way to the lobby
I just tested positive for the rona
Vaccine and anti-bodys: Hmmm... What about.... n o
Mine got stopped in my nasal cavity with bad congestion that's about it
my blood cells to the corona  MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA
Nk cells finna get clapped
Fact check: COVID makes your normal cells look bad, so in this case, the T cells would hit the human cells.
Well isn’t NK cell supposed to get rid of rona if it can get rid of cancer
You should watch Cells at work it is in Netflix enjoy
My fav part is his akatsuki jacket and mask
People who bite there nails: *W e a k*
"Cells at Work" Live Action 👍
My bad
Cells at work in a nutshell
Cells at work
I got tested positive today...
Cells at work be like:
He should make one that is when you need to go to the bathroom but not that bad but when your bladder see's the toilet it gets worse you know what I mean
The new cells at work live action remake do be lookin' good
Idk about you guys but this feels scary to me
Lol.. * pneumonia outbreak detected * "my bad😐"
Cells at work vibes again lol
"my bad" got me dying
Damn I thought marlon Webb was making shit again 😭
He just made science interesting. RESPECT ✌️
The Akatsuki jacket is nice
Can confirm, I am a white blood cell
Bro this camera work is on POINT! So impressed
Is this waka flocka son?
Nice home alone 2 reference
O like how he has akatsuki outfit
Drippin with the akatsuki fit!
If my body gives up that fast then they deserve to get beat up
The rona has a 99% survival rate
😆😆😆 I love these!!! It's such a relatable way to explain how the body works!!! I think you and B Mo should do a collab. That is, if you haven't already!
I don't know why but this is so accurate my science teacher can certify this
"now he's gonna cause pneumonia" "you don't know that" *pneumonia outbreak detected*
Basically "Cells at work" but real life now
This is literally cells at work the anime but real life, this shit's too good man
This guy to too funny 😂
These small tiktoks makes me learn more than 4 years of Biology and Sience tbh
Damn, poor lung department be snitched on Ú-Ù
He’s teaching us about biology in a fun way... I didn’t know that was possible
Sjshej first time I understood what all the cells were  (Cells at work)
Hataraku Saibou in a Netflix adaptation
That my bad at the end😂
This is so accurate exept that corona actually creates proteins that “discourage” the cells from detecting them
Basically cells at work
Lmao this is great
OK I HAVEN'T WATCHED NARUTO YET, BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THAT'S LIKE THE COAT THING ITACHI WEARS
Why do you have an alarm light in your room
I don't personally know a person who had Corona but what they told me is "They felt a sharp pain in their lungs" and went to check in to see if something was wrong and turns out they tested positive, stay safe, and if you feel a sharp pain.... check in, see if you're alright.
Cells at work should make an episode of corona virus
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol but when the top T cell s come corona be dead
My dad going to get me a dog 🐶😁😁
That's gross you got the corona   And my dad said I'm going to get a dog 👅👅👅👁️👄👊👋🚶🚶🚶🐶
You forgot the flint stone gummies
Love the akatsuki jacket
Don’t worry, I’m just a virus with a 99.2% survival rate. Don’t mind me
GET THE S.W.A.T TEAM (Kidney)
Cells at work- why did I get reminded of Cells at work?
That akatsuki jacket tho 🥵
My immune system is fucking insane I haven't been sick in over 6 years not even a cold on top of that it was able to make antibodies for the coronavirus fast enough that it didn't spread I never felt sick at all and I know I was exposed because my brother tested positive
That’s what the media what’s u to think imagine a war with like 200 of each of them and the white cells also at win but some get through but then they die cost reinforcements come
This is refreshingly not cringy
... He’s wearing an akatsuki cloak.................................. this is perfection👌🏻
Man's a real villain out here spreading rona with the kasti outfit and rona came in like the final boss of a video game. Where is the lung department?
I do really the content its learniable and funn
Bruh covid weak af
Good thing I don't belive in covid
Unless your immune like me just bitch slap the rona
“My bad.”
Dude its always the akatsuki getting the covid istg
Next  Corona: where’s the rest of the important departments?
"Cells At Work: Black"
Corona isn’t even 1/10000 that bad unless I old af
Incogneto teacher
Pneumonia outbreak...?
“My bad”
DAMN MANS BEEN WATCHING TO MUCH CELLS AT WORK
Bro my Mans dripen in swag rn
So that’s what itachi was sick with
You should do one where it shows inside the other person too but their cells are in a different house so it's a whole diff style
Lol my whole fam has COVID and the only symptoms any of us have are loss of taste and smell and that's just me and my mom. Out of 6 people, only 2 of us show symptoms. We all had a bit of a sore throat and cough a little bit before my parents tested positive tho
Brooo this is not how it work don’t spread misinformation bro 😩
We all finna pretend he didn’t have that gundam backpack?
It’s will smith
God is good
I wish I had furniture in my brain
FIGHT BACK CMON FIGHT BACK
This guy is cool guy he make the second cell at work
I see you watched cells at work
He got to give me some merch no cap
I meaaannn its more like Corona is gonna fuck your immune system that then dont know whats happening so it attacks good and bad cells
Me who has only gotten sick once in the past 13 years: *insert goku with a supreme hoodie here*
"My bad"
My bad
this isn't what happens when u have covid but sure whatever
Litterally the beginning scenes in the terminator
Cells At Work
“Down the hall and to the left” Donald Trump said that in his part in Home Alone 2! Lmao
Nice akatsuki cloak
I saw the Uchiha mask and jacket
Omg his friend was wearing an akatsuki!! Cool!! :0
An I love cells at work
Omg. I have the same exact shirt that you are wearing. Omg
Ma bad 😂😂
My cells beat the crap out of corona, it felt less than a ordinary fever to me
Corona not real
"My bad" 💀🤚
Imagine if Cells had esophagus'
Naw the T cell would’ve probably told him where the department was
Damn this should be an episode of cells at work
I had COVID and it wasn’t bad at all, I had a stuffy nose, coughed a bit with a dry throat but the worst part was being exhausted all day, the good thing was (4 months ago I had it) I lost my sense of smell and now I can’t smell things like dog shit or people farting
Honestly I'm sick and everyone thinks I got corona I find it funny how people can't tell the difference between corona and allergies.
So no one gon talk about his akatsuki hoddie?🙄🙃
“-.- my bad.”
This is what the enemies punches feel like to me
STOOOOP why are you funny
Cells wouldn’t tell the virus where to go. They legit have a self destruct button and they will kill them self to avoid getting sick.  (I know this is a joke just wanted to let you know.)
Yo my boi got that Walmart drip 💧
Cells at work be like:
Me: *eats 10 jalapeños* My white blood cells after the power boost from the spice: its time you gon' die
This kid is funny
I had rona I just lost my taste and smell for two weeks now I get winded pretty easily though
My white cells then are gonna be goku and vegeta
What anime is this?
Omg I literally have that same Pac-Man shirt 😂
Hey I have the same foldable chair 💺
You have crossed the line. This is not funny neither is it clever. Doing this for views when hundreds of thousands have died worldwide! Are you serious? To avoid future backlash on your channel, my advise is to pull this video and related videos down.
Nah it got 99.7% recovery rate
Lol make a anime with this, cells at work 🤣
Corona ain't that strong
How is nobody talking about that Akatsuki hoodie, damn that be on point
Cells at work Netflix edition.
The snitch are always the ones who act tough
Cool
I didnt know that cells at work got a live action adaptation
Except the virus doesn't even contact the white blood cells — they don't recognise it yet
Hahaha t sells u missed one *I got u the way they walk LOL
My bad
I love this guys videos
Wow this is the best anime I've ever seen and yes, I know there's an anime about cells, but screw that, this is betterrrrr
This is Live Action Osmosis Jones
*Akatsuki*
My man wearing the drip
Nah you need them killer T-cells
When he said “down the hall to the left” I was thinking where down the hall to the left then I agreed!
Nothing happens when you get corona because you can't it's called a common cold
CELLS AT WORK netflix adaptation
These are so good
POV: when you watch to much cells at work
No .... Corona happens cuzz of Pig if you dont know that pls stop eating bacone i dont know what will happend to the worl 😔😔😔😔
Lung department: "Why do i hear boss music?"
Will Smith 😂
Make one about when you get the vaccine.
I got covid but didn't get a cough until the last 3 days of my 2 week quarantine
What actually should happen is that it should just walk along normally trying to find the lungs while the messanger doesn't know that it's in and doesn't give the white blood cells a direction. Then when the man is vaccinated, the delivery bow will have like probably a tape that's always on the corona bacterium and the messanger recognises the tape and sends all the white blood cells to eliminate all cells or bacteria with the tape on.
My bad-- 🤣🤣🤣
This kinda reminds me of Ozzy and Drix. Loved that show.
You forgot the Flinstone Gummy fighting back!
Was anyone else staring at the akatsuki jacket-
The anime is dope tho
Covid actually confuses ur tcells into thinking that normal parts of your lungs and alveoli are harmful so that they attack ur body. So im pretty sure covid itself doesnt do anything (please correct me if im wrong)
Lmaooooo
What about the bubonic plague?
™️▪️
Dude I've actually had covid before-
In a Jiu jitsu gym it simply does not matter.
Cells at work in a nutshell

No beating corona is too easy
Gotta say, I love these guys! 😂
this dude saw one episode of Cells at Work and based all of his content on that concept
What happens when your in love 😏😏
This is literally Cells at work😂
Is no one gonna talk about how his friend was wearing an akatsuki
Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.  Romans 6:10-11 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Lol, this is pretty accurate.  I got last year and it was awful.  It was almost a month before I felt ok, and could walk more than 5 feet without running out of breath.  For 2 months I couldn't taste or smell anything.   I get bronchitis and even had pneumonia several times but rona was way worse.
I've had pneumonia 4 times👁💧👄💧👁
the big bad rona with the >90% recovery rate
This dude looks like the person from the fresh Prince of bell hair meme
You're videos are so fucking funny
Is nobody going to point out that he’s wearing in a akatsuki cloak
Bro, do the no rona justu my g
You don't understand this virus. It won't affect anyone till like 60 with preexisting condition s
Will Smith v2
Corona is the anime kid of sickness
Your so good at showing what is happening in the human body
Corona is a virus not a bacteria
Great job man, so funny
At the start I have that exact same shirt for the guy in the white hat
This was actually really good.
You don't know that 😂
This is a great way to explain it to kids withoit scaring them
Cells at work vibes
Yeah.. Make it Hurt
*cells at work flashbacks*
Ah fam knowing that its real, this just makes it so much more fun! But tbh I always think there are tinyer people inside of me
Cells at work live action
When did I accidentally start watching Cells at Work?
Cells at work live action remake looking kinda woozy
Covid is about as strong as a common cold
I don’t mean to be that guy but it’s more like covid is the ninja than some really powerful virus
Like DA jacket
its not cells at work, it cells at the hood
He actually makes good skits
Did anyone else flashback to Osmosis Jones?
Doctor : How do you get coronavirus infection?  Me : White blood cell snitched on me
The rona is the terminator Jesus Christ
This dude should be my bio teacher
W H E R E I S T H E L U N G D E P A R T M E N T
TELL ME THIS IS NOT A CELLS AT WORK REFERENCE
These tik toks feel like they be by your human biology teacher and he needs to teach about the body parts
Naa this the cells at work se2 ep 1 (JK)
Rlly cells at work in live action tho
Man pulled up in an akatksi vest
The white blood cell have a esophagus-
You should've aimed for the balls
This gives me cells at work vibes
Osmosis jones be looking different these days
Weak ass T cells folded
Now do a skit about the real virus. That is only dangerous to those already weakened by other concerns...
Ive got The rona atm lol
"My bad-"  Me: BITCH - kicks carona then load the gun with medicen- Carona: bye-
This could be an entire arc in cells at work
Lmao “Carona: The Movie”
This don’t help my confidence after just getting it
HIV
"mY BAd"
I’ve heard of you take deep breaths pneumonia is less likely to happen
But when you get that vaccine T cells bout to be hella strong against corona
“Cells at work” in a nutshell
I love when he does videos like these 😂😂😂
I like how T cell no.2 owned up to his mistake
Oh corona not prepared for my white cells I ate 3 gummy vitamins they strong as fuck now
Wait that t cell said he had an esophagus, or whatever it is so is there organs inside of cells?
Better than Cells at Work
That’s why I don’t have friends so I don’t get betrayed!
“My bad”
I had the corona ITS HORRIBLE  1.I COULDNT EAT ANYTHING I WOULD JUST THROW IT UP LATER 2.I WAS CONSTIPATED  3.I WAS SO FUCKING WEAK 4.I GOT MY MOM SICK 5.I DIDNT GET TO GO OUT OF THE ROOM.
Just don’t have bitch cells
Doesn’t this guy look like will smith
.... I want that Akatsuki jacket.... 🥺
then they're like wait was that corona? and they proceeded to rek face
No way did this guy just pull up with an akatsuki outfit lmao
i swear thats what it feels like tho, i had it and i play clarinet, however im having to quit bc i can’t hold my breath as long anymore 😔
I want that Akatsuki jacket *I need it*
This dude can legit make one minute tiktoks of cells at work live action and I can still pay him big.
Cells at work? The anime please respond to my question
Nah when you take the vaccine the t cels get guns and body armor
Yup
Gotta Akatsuki jacket and mask
I’m in nursing school and this series is 🔥
So true
Sooo basically coronavirus is caused by sitching....
Lol The "My Bad." Part Was hilarious 😂😂😂
Literally just blood cells at work Netflix adaptation
But instead off giving him directions to rona kills all of them
AIDS just shoots the white blood cells
Why he sound like 2015 corykenshin
Added the caption bacteria even though it's a virus . Gg
They would try to fight Rona you can't kill it its a virus
Not true at all, they don't recognize corona so they don't know what to do
.... My b
HIS AKAZUKI SHIRT THO SIEBDNJXJSOWKSBSBDJSM
My white blood cells must be strong as hell
Is this... Cells At Work?💁🏽‍♂️
Boi get Killer T on this lad.
Did anyone notice he is an akastki?
"my bad-"
It’s obvious,Corona got plot armour
It’s like anime
so you gave on me that fast white cells you gave up on me that fast
This how u know he watched cells at work
When I got rona I was actually pretty okay. Like, just felt like the flu with a cold after affect lol
If you arnt fat or old your body would actually kick its ass
Well some people are immune to covid so I guess those people's blood beat the living daylights out of the virus
Cells at work be hitting different in dis one
“Down the hall to the left”😂😂😂
Bro this is the 50 dollar budget of "Cells at work"
Corona Virus is nothing to joke about, lots of people are dying because of it this is not funny
These are the greatest
Damn my dude, you must by one of the 0.1% who actually get affected by corona 😂😂
I had pneumonia before this when pandemic, it was bad and I felt terrible like and extreme fever where you can only breathe through ur mouth but you just need some good medicine and you will get better. But corona probably has more to it tho bc people are dying......
Guys I had the mutated Corona virus and survived. I just can recommend to take a lot of vitamin C and "upgrade" your immune system. I just had some headaches and a little cold in that time I was sick.
Wheres the vitiman c at
Akatsuki watsudonta
Lemme guess hataraku saibou
yo he went the wrong way.
When the Akatski has the corona
wait till it has to deal with the flint stone vitamin gummies
My bad
It’s funny how people died from it but my ass legit was hanging around my family who got it and drink after them. Nothin  happened 🧐 so I assume it attacks people with weak immune systems the most
The you dont know that part killed me, So did the rona
cells at work
“My bad”
He could have told him the wrong directions.
When corona walked in I knew right then in there they wouldn't be able to best it up😂
What if the white blood cells like combine then would it be strong enough it to defeat the rona
GET THE...WHATEVER CELL THAT IS AND SPY ON THEM FAST
Cells at work.
Akatsuki????? U k naruto??
THOOSE DIRTY SNITCHES
And then you got other immune systems where the white blood cells are all saitama
this makes me want to watch cells at work again
Instant regret
Nice akatski robe and mask
Ok this was actually funny. Props sir
Oh so that what happends this is way better than my parents explaining it
Epic
"Down the hall and to the left" trump meme
And then the vaccine comes.
I mean 5 million people got corona but 300,000 survived corona      So it’s not corona time
My white blood cells are like the hulk. Lol (I have a really good immune system)
Shit when he said T cells i got reminded of my bio exam tmr.back to studying:...)
Love This!!! Sad but true.🎇
That's only true if you got a weak immune system worst case for me headache and fever
Lol cute flu
The new Cells at work spin-off is werid.
Friendly reminder that Covid has a 99.9997% survival rate.
Me, who took the vaccine : *Weak Coronas Die Big Deal*
Man, when I got Corona, thank God nobody gave directions to Corona where is the lung department. I meant that Corona didn't attack my lungs😂
“My bad” 😂😂😂
Did u know that the flu kills more people than covid
This doesn’t make sense since corona is a virus and in the early stages of the virus the immune system can’t try to fight off the virus because it’ll kill the cell it’s infected
Brahh a genius 💯😎🖤
😬 😬 white blood cells deal with bacteria not viruses, that’s the macrophages job and they also aren’t T cells
Cells at work season 3 lookin great
The cell at work thing is so funny
Pneumonia? Isn't that where You vomit blood?
So you have chosen death
Acting is on point
Cells at Work be like:
Cells at work! Vibes
That's so wrong and so many false informations that it's not funny anymore.
CELLS ATE WORKKKKKK ❤️
Me : Sees the red clouds which I assume means akatsuki   Also me : Ah, I see you’re a man of culture as well
You know they're dying when the boss said stop playing around
I all notice is akatsuki cloak
Damn that akatsuki fit is *fire* 😩😩😩
He shouldve redirected the COVID to somewhere else for a trick
This funny enough is scientifically accurate most vaccines are used to train your body to fight virus so they give it a weaker version and then your body learns how to fight it and also learns how to fight the real deal so this is super true and funny
Cells at work without the anime filter
Is this the new cells at work season? They said they would do an episode based on the corona virus. 😂 (Joking but this is great lol)
69th comment bois!!!!!!!
Jojo fighting santana be like
I get the pneumonia but not the covid sooo.....
Dam
This reminds me of the anime cells at work
“Ma bad”   This got me idk why XD
When Corona reminds you of an Anime Fight scene like Dragon Ball
This is like a spin off series of cells at work and I love it
Damn funny needed this, but should have gone down the og Star wars darth Vadar scene.  'Where are the Lungs!' , the sound of the t cells larynx being crushed, we're on a diplomatic health mission. Then more bone crunching sounds and thrown to the floor. Lol
Way is this funny but also so weird
Imagine if biology lessons were like this
Lmao that's why my white blood cells have guns I had it and it wasn't that bad at all
Lol when he said “My bad” killed me
Damn- we need the killer T cells up in here
I have the same lac man shirt
My white blood cells kicked coronavirus ass covid left me in a week and I did not feel sick
Do be fair it's supposed to be a sneak attack because the body has never seen this type of illness before but still great.
*Will Smith reincarnated.*
Nah they just have a anime fight scene for a week or two.
There's an anime on crunchyroll that's about cells and fighting diseases etc.
Cells at work
Are we gonna ignore his robe?
He sounds like the terminator crossed with a Karen asking for the manager, but in a good way
This funny asf but mostly it's just scary
It’s not because the T cells aren’t strong enough to deal with corona it just that they don’t know how to deal with it the new corona vaccine will give you a week version of corona virus so your body would know how to deal with it there for corona would be like a cold
Fun fact corona is almost invisible to white cells
Why does this remind me of cells at work?
Fr tho this be cells at work bro
My BaD😐
Finally someone new who really can do humour!
What happens it disguises itself as a cell in your body making your body realize it's a virus later on it will keep fighting and make copies of itself in you the whole time it's very dangerous.
Part 2
I love this man he makes everything in proper perspective as if it was a real live cartoon of inside of the body edit: ty for so much likes never got so much before
Osmosis Jones lmao
That squeak tho
White cells: oh thanks for breakfast

Damn, why you gotta snitch on the lung department-
why does Rona look like gerard-
Will Smith??
Rona dont do s***. I got it during Halloween and it made me sick for a somewhat large portion of the day (not barf sick, just unhealthy and weak type of sick). Afterwards, I was at full strength. Before this, my grandpa, who is in his late 60's got the rona and it did the same thing to him. He was fine the next day.
When he said “down the hall to the left” I was thinking where down the hall to the left then I Thought OH my left arm
Rona's eye bags haha
