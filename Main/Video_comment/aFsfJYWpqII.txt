btw they also raise the price of the items on the apps. Every item is an extra $1 to 2 than if you had ordered directly from the restaurant
I've never used delivery apps because I don't have "peasant get me my food" money on top of eating out money but now I'm glad I've never used it
12:00 missed opportunity to say "play Devil's advocate" 😆
If you can, eat local, call the restaurant to order and pick up the meal yourself. If they made the delivery fee exorbitant, more people would get off their arse and go out for food.
I love the show so much. He makes me wanna laugh and cry all at the same time as he’s spewing jokes and making sense about how things are really awful for people that work at these delivery services.
I disagree. The cost is astronomical.
sorry, the call to action is to.. pay more? have you met your audience?
Not to mention the companies underpayment you+
This country needs to quit forcing consumers to pay their employees a livable wage. I don't care if they are gig or full employees. I worked in the service industry and its broken. Other countries have managed to create systems that force companies to provide a livable wage to their service industry professionals and they also have universal healthcare. The United States of Desperation needs to get 👏🏽 it👏🏽 together👏🏽 People deserve to live and work with dignity.
A point that I really wish had been mentioned was the problem with car insurance for folks working for these apps. I totaled my car while actively delivering an order and my car insurance refused to cover the lose, would not pay anything at all, because I didn't have the "special" insurance policy they required you to have if you did gig work as an independent contractor. It cost extra and only allowed you to deliver a couple days a week. I was lucky that my family was able to help me replace the car. Otherwise I would have lost the main job I had at the time which was 30 minutes away and not near public transportation. My friend who also did food delivery had to change the insurance company they were with because their previous provider didn't even offer coverage.
i generally made $30 an hour delivering for uber eats in oakland. i got the money sent to my account at the end of the shift. the work saved my life.
2:10 he sounds like an undercover cop 😂
Didn't DOOR DASH just donate a bunch of money to the Trump regime?
13:30 the tech bro orphanage business model is brilliant
The next time California residents ask for any help or relief please remember they voted in favor of corporations when it came to Proposition 22. They voted in favor of the corporations and against the interest of the workers. Leave California to rot.
I absolutely do not believe gay parts should go to gay actors... it's called acting!  Dumbest thing Oliver has ever read from a teleprompter 😅
The tipping option shouldn't be an issue because we shouldn't tip prior to receiving the service. We tip when the good arrives, not before.
My account as a driver was deactivated randomly last week sighting a duplicate account that I never made. So apparently your fraudulent company, which I have dedicated years of my life to and risked my safety through multiple robbery attempts, car accidents, and other work related hazards just to be SCREWED OVER by this company. Do your self and the world a favor and NEVER use uber. They’ll likely leak your information, tell you it’s your fault, double charge you for what you paid for, and tell you to go fuck yourself.
The slice of cake is pretty sad but the saddest order I've ever delivered was from CVS. Two items: Plan B and a bag of assorted chocolates.  Someone was clearly regretting their decisions from the night before.
Restaurants don't really treat you like family. They still make you pay for your food. Just saying
The other thing to take in mind is that’s actually not cheap for consumers either. Often time when I order on these apps, the fees for the order are the same amount of money as the items that I ordered. $18 bucks for a burrito (which is already a lot of money) and another $13 in fees, then a tip- $18 for the burrito, $18 for the rest. Bonkers!
"We aren't profitable"  Also, spending millions of dollars on: 1. Campaigning to reduce labour rights in the places they operate. 2. Paying their CEOs and shareholders huge dividends. 3. Massive share buybacks so that more of their dividends go towards themselves.  Hmmmmmmm 🤔
Los Angeles, we have Uber eats and DoorDash, both of which are completely transparent, and held to high standards of packaging. They even offer the option of ordering and then having the customer pick up their order themselves. This is a bit misleading, yet it is quite funny.
Insisting that customers tip is a nice gesture, but it doesn't mean much when doordash keeps getting caught pocketing worker tips. I used to drive for them until a customer told me warmly that she had given a huge tip, but my app said i got zero dollars. The next week I saw it in the paper that doordash had chosen to pay a fine for wage theft instead of returning all the stolen tips to drivers.
I would no longer ever use any of those apps, for them to deliver food for their customers, that have to pay not only for the food itself, but for the subcharges that are now included.   That weren't included before. Also must pay ANOTHER surcharge for them placing an order through any app, such as GrubHub, DoorDash, and UberEats. I don't know anything about Postmates. Waiter, sucks.   Because such a company like UberEats, don't pay their employees that deliver the food, by having to drive all over town, without receiving hardly any tips.  I wonder if they get to keep those tips. Because the higher-ups get revenue, but what about the profits that come in?   I sure as hell don't think that their employees as delivery drivers, do not receive them. Only their bosses do.   And that's not fair. While they (meaning their delivery driver companies) charge much MORE nowadays then ever before!   Not to mention that their companies are rolling back on the job insurance protections to be there for their own employees as delivery drivers...... to unbelievably pull the rug right out from under them, so to speak ; and become crooked and corrupt.   It's just not right.
Glad for another video!
I worked for door dash for a few days but my car is not in great shape so I had to stop because of it. I made $70 and they never paid me for it
22:27 I was literally paying Harry Potter legacies when the joke came up about Harry Potter
I'm going to start it with the fact that I am pro immigration. That will probably end me up in some kind of social media jail, but still I say. I love my Spanish friends AND employees... But with for dash, a good person if their drivers didn't ever speak English.. and a lot of them are very impatient.. Delivery orders have DEFINITELY doubled or tripled orders, but you know what HASN'T changed.. the amount of employees we have to serve them with. Not to mention when they have to be served by a server, they don't tip the waitress or server making sure THEY get their tips..
Not to mention I've seen drivers smoking, having did in the car.. Etc.
On a side note now. That guy said we would need 15 employees just standing around... The side note, was that for the most part I can't stand door dash especially.. In fact where I work, we had one crawl through our drive thru window and attach my employees... Then called corporate and wanted to file charges on our employees for assault...🤨🤔..
Ok I love the grub hub as at the first.. but ...wtf their freaking masks!!!.
I avoid these apps like the plague.
And they give the delivery driver less than .05% so when you waste an hour and half of my time shopping for your groceries and you don’t tip, you’re a pos.
I LIKE Chipotle.
I will never understand why workers put up with wages so low communities feel compelled to gift them money...for doing the job they are paid to do?   Such a messy economic choice. And rare. Most of the developed world just pays a standard, some what reasonable wage. And that's it. Simple!
as a cook in a kitchen though i honestly hate these delivery apps.....the company i work for is not hiring more workers to account for the added ticket volume, we get a lot of reorders due to failed deliveries, and all this on top of the rush in house plus the 4 different ghost kitchens that are now operating out of our restaurant as well  add on: i order delivery a lot myself, from places that manage and pay their own staff to deliver the food, like pizza and chinese chains.
I love that you're in no stupid questions, ostensibly for all English speakers, but there's no shortage of yankees asking what are definitely stupid questions.
I live in MT, but I’m not an American, I’m here on a Visa. Because of that I don’t have a license nor a car, for anyone who knows MT you know that unless you’re directly in Bozeman or Billing’s your fucked if you don’t have a car. I also work 40 hours a week and it takes about an hoi each way to get to the closest Walmart. Unfortunately the only way I can get groceries or dinner if I’m working late is to uber it. I feel so bad for the drivers that I give cash tips on top of all tips.
was a top dasher most days in a week for 4+ years, top ratings, happy customers... out of that many sometimes-12+ hour days, can count the number of tips acquired on just the hands it has it is often thankless and incredibly dangerous work. there are some sweet customers, but avoid doing this unless it is your literal only choice.
*The Deadliest Noble* Women are truly the deadliest noble. They have spirit gifts from beyond the available physics. Tempt one if you dare. Note* Homosexuality is the outcome of the mind in some when confronted with an extreme resolution that demands pertinent consideration. It like teenagers expected to solve CERN on a whim. Hey. In my opinion nobility should live on their own planet. The problem is that when raising any bar it only creates a new nobility out of the higher bar.
I never order delivery anymore. I miss the old days of chinese food and pizza. I'll never ever subsidize these awful services.
the councilman IS the Doordasher
4:49 RIP
Thanks for this one, John! Have you done an episode about photo apps yet? I just had another bad experience with Snapfish and Shutterfly; I'm sure there is a story there!
So stop using the services and get off of your lazy asses and get your damn food yourself.
Companies that rely on gig-workers also rely on what's known as "Hollywood Accounting" to make it appear that they aren't turning a profit, when they are making billions. The majority of their labor is outside contractors and they are selling a service, not the products they deliver. SMFH
the same crap also holds true for rideshare drivers: business expenses, negative feedback, points/tier status, tips, etc. #noonprop22

Just to be clear. Those "subsidies" aren't given they are literally stolen from the restaurants.

12:12 😂 tell me you don’t have way more fun listening to the devil.  Happy Easter btw 😂
Tips are more like 2/3 of the driver's pay. I'll drive 25-35min and get a $2-$3 fare, so if there's no tip, that equates to ~$6/hr. Not to mention we don't get paid to return to our point of origin. So if the dropoff is out in the boonies it cuts that hourly pay even more as we have to return to civilization. Not to mention gas and wear and tear on our vehicles. Please tip, it really is integral to our overall pay. The other day I was in Boston for 5hrs, got 8 orders. 7 didn't tip. Final pay was about $60. That's just over $10/hr. Minus fuel and the absolute maddening experience of driving around Boston. Please tip. 👏
Food delivery
Tried door dashing for a couple days in Northern Virginia when I was in between jobs. Never have I ever felt like I was in danger like those three days and I've lived and driven in this area my whole life. We get drivers from all over the world here and it shows and the ratio of days I've seen car accidents vs days I haven't are near 1:1. On top of that, DoorDash doesn't keep location in mind when ordering from franchises like McDonalds(which can't be picked up through the drive thru mind you), so I've actually delivered orders from one location that was across the state line. This gig would have killed me if I kept going.
I've pulled up the Foodora app in Calgary when it was -36C. Got paid pretty good. I don't think I'm going to hell for that. People got the food they wanted and it was hot because I'm fast. Of coarse Some other cyclists can't do this. Although John made me laugh during this video, a lot of this is incorrect but mostly right.
Pizza and Chinese delivery was all we had growing up. Im 51. Just direct ordering and delivery.  I had no idea this is how it works😮
Like it video
One of the biggest problems with us delivery drivers being classified as "independent contractors" is that they actively circumvent the benefits of being an independent contractor.  Like limiting scalability, most do not allow you to have a helper, and you are not able to log in on multiple devices, so you can actually hire employees of your  own. As a contractor there is no legal expectation that you will do the work yourself.  Secondly, as a contractor you are supposed to be able to negotiate your pay for each job you do. With all these delivery apps what you get is "Here is the order, here is the pay. Take it or leave it."
that call me by your name reference??? john oliver KNOWS ball
I've been doing gig work with multiple apps for 6+ years now...this was surprisingly well-researched, across the board. It's absolutely absurd for these companies to suggest they aren't profitable: the endless, multi-year investments by giant hedge funds and wealthy businessmen is clear evidence against that. The fundamentals of these businesses are good enough to encourage investment, the "lack of profit" is more a tax dodge than anything else.
i remember that pride ad VISCERALLY. it was truly an exercise in how to make every single person bothered by it for their own unique reason. if we'd took a moment to think on exactly why we didn't like it, it might have been a genuinely unifying moment across the ideological spectrum
😊 leave them inside their own photos  ...
I still have a drawer full of paper menus old habits die hard
I did this work for a while when I got one negative review on @uber and then I started to get lower number of orders and farther order that should be gone be cars such as 3-6km atleast far away even though I selected bi-cycle as mode of transportation. These orders would send me farther and away from downtown to outskirts area that have even fewer orders
Please look at the "credit score" industry. I watched this video and the next thing I heard was, check you credit score for free. How are these companies making money? I can check my credit score through my bank or any number of options. How are there companies paying to advertise their ability to offer a free service for free?
l Hi
It's a morbid joke in grad school that "You have the freedom to work any 80 hours you want each week."
I just received a delivery from DoorDash, and I can't tell if this is semen or glaze on my meal.
I delivered pizza and DoorDash for a majority of my 20s and I always loved delivering to stoned people. Drunk people can be hit or miss but I do always appreciate them not drinking and driving.
They steal whatever they can and keep getting away with it.
Really appreciate you talking about this. I really wish you discussed how many people are illegally working for these delivery companies. It's pretty easy to create fake accounts and rent them to undocumented individuals. In 2020-21, 19 Brasilians in Boston received a combined 200 year sentence for this.
Flash flood warning Automatically doordash gain extra 1.25 $ for this order! Traveling through the freaking Amazon river.....
Now they are paying 3-5$ for 10 miles, 25 minutes in some markets.... Modern slavery

The irony that this video  and out when I was struggling to make ends meet and is what gave me the idea to become a door dasher. I lost my job like a month later and it was perfect for me to pay my rent while taking classes for a new job.
this is wild should just be a del fee not a fee for me and the restaurant
I live in germany, so no tipping culture toxic history here. Tip your drivers just personally. I never trusted a website or restaurant to pay the driver the tips i transfer. I always tip personally, on arrival, in cash. Only way to make sure its fair (and also "tax free").
RIP to enjoying Harry Potter

Love the gay person in the crowd at that post mates pride commercial audibly going WHAT? multiple times

This isnt just happening in the US apparently. I saw this Chinese movie called Upstream. Basically sums up what’s in this episode. Felt really bad about those low stars I placed on the app.
@11:56 no, its a fiddeling contest the Devil barely even fiddled. Johny did, if anything johny could have won purely out of defualt.
This was all just a campaign to trash GrubHub and raise awareness for the other companies….    And I love it. F-GrubHub.
These companies are doing charity then ? haha what a joke. Classical american mentality where everything is solved with tipping . The real problem of the cannibal Capitalism is never addressed.
7:08 "And I know that just saying percentages at you might not be that helpful even though you know you are watching an episode of 'Numbers being yelled at you with human Squidward" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 MAGNIFICENT
This is why I order online from restaurants directly - I don't have to pay astronomical delivery fees, it's easy to pick up, and the order goes directly to the restaurant.
It's hard to tip a lot when they are charging 20% more just to get it delivered.  You would think they are paying them a decent amount for delivering.  Especially when they are taking most of the money from the restaurant itself.
As someone whose eyes have just been opened to the fact that profit is no longer the goal for big tech bros/billionaires (because of central bank funding + monopolizing + buying own stock = incredible personal wealth growth), I really REALLY hope John Oliver does an episode on this.  Economist Yannis Varoufakis calls this the death of capitalism and the birth of technofeudalism.
Thank you, dear John, for opening the door to so many bad news businesses and or politicians. We love your shows in the light on these dark demons.😮
Never used a delivery app, and never will... A friend showed me how "convenient" it was, but when I saw the restaurant price's were jacked up by an extra 15-20% through the app for no apparent reason, and then you add the delivery cost, and finally you can add a tip. The end price was something like 30-40% more than if we picked it up ourselves directly to the restaurant! And everyone was happy with that! But wait! There is more! We waited almost an hour for the delivery because the delivery guys keep turning down the pick up because they couldn't find a parking stop right in front of the restaurant and keep cancelling. My friend added an extra tip to make sure they wouldn't cancel... More money. Now I keep hearing these apps want to offer a buy now pay later system...
I am not sure but I think in Canada, well at least Toronto, the prices on the menu are a little higher so the restaurant doesn't pay to have the service.  Edit:  AI info on the subject.  "In Toronto, restaurants are charged a commission fee, often a percentage of the order total, by third-party delivery services like Uber Eats and DoorDash. Customers also pay delivery fees and sometimes service fees on top of the food price, which can make the overall cost of ordering via delivery higher than dining in or picking up. "
People need to walk to the store. People are getting so fat with the delivery apps and poor choices. Yes youre fat and lazy and its totally your own choice yet blame the world lol.
the energy in this crowd is CRAZY! always makes me happy to see an active audience. they're eating it up!
This food Delivery companies don’t require DoorDash drivers to have a comercial insurance to protect DoorDash drivers or civilians driving. Most DoorDash drivers only have their basic car insurance so if they crash or hit your car their insurance won’t cover you .
Another case of technology not saving us. The gig economy is a scam!
The good, the bad and the ugly... The app owners make billions skimming off the sweat of other folk's labour and we-the-customers-drivers of the system just want it Cheap! without any concern for our fellow humans. Make it better.
15:40 Oh hey paris, thats more familliar
I have never ordered food from an app
I STOPPED using food delivery during the pandemic. I tried thinking I was supporting the restaurants; but the fees & prices went thru the roof, even w/out the tip; and only assholes wd ignore the driver. Once my pizza came driven by a woman w her kid holding my food in a car w dog/hair- that was it.  And if those prices aren’t enuf for the company to make $$$, why so expensive?
"Seasoned assist" is a "cease and desist"
honestly i just dont order food anymore. it costs more and in some cases double the food cost.
8:47 This is all true, the menu showed non-existing meals, and when restaurants are not listed, drivers may use a "Grubhub Card" which plenty of times gets declined because prices are different.
Everything is a scam.
I really enjoy when he does episodes on topics I have first hand knowledge of (worked at Starbucks before and during pandemic and was there when we launched UberEats). It makes me feel better about how accurate the other episodes are.
If you believe they don’t make money you don’t understand how it works
I’ve never ordered from any of these apps… never plan to. Too expensive.
At the tail end of me working "with" uber eats, my last 5 trips each were about 40 minutes or more with 20-30 minutes of driving. I got paid only 3$ for each because none of them tipped and that was my cut after uber. This is slave labor and I'd rather deliver to disabled customers only. They and the older customers were the only ones actually thankful for the delivery and actually need the help.
Recovering from surgery, I ordered a cheeseburger and milkshake yesterday from Culvers. It was $36 with Uber eats.
I've ordered Uber eats 4 times per week since December and they are currently at a 40 percent success rate, meaning 60 percent of my orders are stolen without a refund or any consequences whatsoever to the thieves. Boo on me for trying again and again, may be because I live in Saint F-Louis MO!
Lol, our taxi company that I worked for got a delivery licence, we charged an additional fee on top of the food, that was charged by the vendor, based on distance from the restaurants.  If we got a tip on delivery, great! Total transparency.  Usually, the food and delivery already paid for, and we'd get a cash tip. That's how it should be done ✔️.
I ordered pickup food from my favorite restaurant through GH and added a tip. I was sad to find out when I picked up my order that the tip doe not go to the restaurant for pick ups. Always ask.
I remember back in 2018 for a Chipotle burrito. Thing showed up where half was warm and freshly cooked and the other half felt like they tossed it tin to the freezer it was so cold and solid. No idea how they did it. It was a 10 min delivery in a car
After we called for a welfare check for a relative the operator said it would be a long time before they could go, so we ordered a food delivery to her with special instruction to hand over personaly and phone us after.. it only took 30 minutes.
The whole thing should have been replaced with remotely piloted drones by now!  All these people could stay home *and* call themselves “Drone Pilots” instead of whatever demeaning term people use for gig workers nowadays… Way to drop the ball Musk/ Bezos… “geniuses” 😂🙄   Oh, and since I have your attention (lol) Elon, build a practical car an average American can afford (like, 10-12k). Jeff, solve homelessness in the US.   I know if I had your level of wealth, I could do both. Do one. If you can’t, you’re an even bigger *loser* than I am. 😂
I hope to God it doesn’t last I wanna go back to real delivery service. Instead of having to pay 3 to 4 times what I used to pay.
no, that is complete and utter bullshit. There is zero chance that they don’t make money. They’re lying and you’re too gullible to see it otherwise. Why else does it cost me $25 for a Frappuccino and $70 for fast food food for one person $150 for three people to have breakfast?! Why else do they ask you to tip sometimes more than the whole price of the food and delivery price? Complete utter bullshit
Never used one. And if I can't go get it, I'm not that hungry.
Love that DoorDash delivery guy talking about his customers 😂
Grub hub is still a thing ?
some people work in terrible/dangerous weather because they have to. they get an unexpected bill which wipes out there savings completely. but they still have rent to pay or need money for food. they woke up with $0 in the bank and they ate their last food the night before. so they dont eat or pay rent if they dont work that day. they live day to day sometimes hour to hour.  i've been that person before.
24:18 it did not get overturned.
Tech bros suck !!!
Er . . . most workers pay their own health care no matter the business. Few US businesses offer health care.
Door Dash has so much fine print about using it that it's suspicious. Tipping the delivery person is insisted! & s'one in chat mentioned a delivery driver smoking a joint. Probably not much different than any other delivery service? (except drug use)
watching this now when skype's gone is 😬😬😬😂
Just eat, uber eats and deliveroo in UK will rip you off as a business owner. 30% out of your earnings + VAT. It killed ny business.
💯
There’s no money in delivery. It’s a service that you are offering to your restaurant customers that’s it.
I would organize a group of neighbored restaurants to create their own delivery service so that they keep it local and fair
Imagine watching one day to hear everyone knows you ordered a slice of cake & didn’t tip 😂 the shame
I think Skype died because Microsoft repurposed it to make Teams.
They should call out that pos that ordered a single piece of cake.
7:40 🤫
Very funny this man but he really makes a point.
Fun fact, Microsoft got rid of Skype, it is now discontinued.
Today I learned that in the US, Just Eat is called Grubhub.
Wait I’ll you learn about newspaper carriers. This is not a new model sadly
A company in my country charges delivery partner fees and platform fees. Inflated prices than in person prices. If you buy a membership, which goes to the platform, the delivery partner fee gets waived off and not the platform fees.
Uber and deliveries companies should  sell the softwares to the restaurants.And software should be run restaurant for a fee.uber and GrubHub running the show is not profitable to them neither the restaurants 😮😮😮But delivery software a great idea
This whole thing was a little pitchy, dog.
Tipping or Over-Tipping is the worst solution.  It just creates a “Tipping War”.  Now many “Dashers” won’t even pickup orders unless there is an advance tip.  I REFUSE to tip PRIOR to service rendered.  It is the actual opposite of what a Tip is SUPPOSED to be.  I understand how bad reviews hurt people… but what is they turn the pizza upside down or squish a sub?  There needs to be a feedback mechanism… if everyone leaves 5 stars all the time the whole mechanism is useless/meaningless.
These companies may be technically “subsidizing” deliveries… but the food and fees still cost MORE so how does that make sense?
Solution… Delivery Workers Strike and NOT deliver for a week and demand companies pay a fare wage.
Solution… Consumers can strike and NOT tip… and Insist/Demand that these companies pay workers a fair wage.
Solution… delivery apps shouldn’t take order for less than a specific $ value.
Solution… don’t use GrubHub or Uber Eats.  Never have, and I have no plans to start.
Food delivery app generates the best commercial since the 1969 Alka-Seltzer ad, "That's a spicy meatball." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO-KkWZLJlU
Please tip you drivers please 🙏 they are risking there lives to bring you food even if it's 2 dollars it makes a difference
I never use those apps, either they hide the extra costs in each menu item or the charge outlandish fees. I just called the restaurant directly and placed an order over the telephone.  You remember the phone right?
19:19 How about they pay their workers so I don’t have to tip, unless I fucking want to…
though upper try first worthier whence data stored at tree vine hike wreath of weigh
Every time John makes a joke about people not using the phone anymore all I hear is that he doesn’t go anywhere with a lot of immigrants
19:00 What I'm thinking is that USA's tip laws are severely dystopian
I absolutely do NOT use abusive exploitation those apps.
I always tip 10 dollars MINIMUM to the delivery person, regardless of the order total.  And I always do it with cash, so that the company doesn't vampire any of it.  A ten dollar bill, untraceable, into the hand of the person that earned and deserves it.
The Charlie Daniel bit was sublime. LOL
once again capitalism
Knowing a one star rating can ruin someone's life for stealing my food makes me very happy.
16:30 wrong way, down a one way street~~
I order my food to take out, and I go pick it up when it's ready because I get 15% off on my order and I can find parking for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. We have it like that in Canada,  I don't know how it works in America.
Life in the US is just incredibly backwards. We all spend so much time working while meanwhile prices on everything just continue to rise.
17:03  I've done deliveries in a blizzard before. People have no limit to their audacity, because not only will they place orders in dangerous weather conditions, but they'll also NOT TIP at the same time. Baffles me every time.
same here in india
Shipt is the worst
wtf is a phone call???
Yeah dated and birated
Blumpkin ass Blumpkins wtf!!!!!
God halp us all
BS tipping culture
He forgot to menti9n that Uber Eats will charge a monthly membership fee of $9.99 whether you order again or not. I had to call my credit card company to dispute the charges that I failed to notice for 4 months. Thank God,  bank of America Visa gave me the credits.  The delivery person may not make much money, but Uber Eats knows that most people don't check their CC statements. So, Uber stands to make $188.00 a year on each of us.
I’m sorry, but the writers of LWT completely ignoring the insane markup customers pay on their orders and suggesting that the customers are the only ones who benefit is just laughable.
In Ohio, the driver hurt delivering could have bought workers comp insurance which would have covered him during recovery. When I was an independent contractor carpenter, I had my own workers comp.
16:20 Why were virtually all bikers speeding or going the wrong way even before we had all these apps?
Never used a delivery app, and Life Willing I never will.
I am really disagreeing with John on this one.  Mainly because it's one of the things that free market can regulate on its own and the intervention from the government will likely not improve it.   I find nothing wrong with the delivery companies wanting to rise the prices up once they cleared the competition field. We've seen it in other industries, it's inevitable. Two-three companies will remain and then there will be an equilibrium between how much the customers can pay and how much the companies can earn. It's the closest to an ideal "fair price" as we can get.  Also whenever the apps start uncontrollably raising prices, this will lead to restaurants providing their own deliveries using the good old phone (and now, using chatbots) and driving the apps out of business.  Of course, in John's ideal world the delivery price is free and the workers deliver it always on sunny days going through beautiful parks and breathing fresh air. But we're not there, and in the real world the equilibrium is reached when everyone is equally dissatisfied.  Also I don't get the appeal to those who are locked home disabled and have "no other choice" than the delivery apps. That argument looks strange because... how did they live before the delivery apps then?  All in all - leave the free market alone. Just ensure there is no monopoly in the end (that would be really bad) and prevent some extreme abuse scenarios (like selling out the data to foreign governments) and we'll be good.
Cash tips, if you can!
Shows how incredibly lazy people have become. Make America Fatter Again
As a current DoorDash employee I want to help businesses. I am willing to forgo cash to help these companies. I am also scared for my own wellbeing
It's Free to give 5 stars.🌟 even if whatever- I always give 5 stars Anytime anywhere ✨️. Fr. Costs nothing & may help a human out. 😊 esp. A human that isn't a high paid worker...aka Not a millionaire...aka avg human. 🍰
Calling it a tip is a mustake. Its wn offerto take the order. Ihave w certain level that must be met depending on distance or i will not take ithe order
Kid crew
I wanna add a note for people who deliver for Uber specifically, the mileage and time they give you does not cover the time from where you are, to the restaurant. They don’t pay you for any of that time. They also won’t compensate if you arrive and the place is closed and you have to cancel an order. They don’t pay a dime. It’s bare minimum :/
I hate these business bros who pretend or even believe they’re changing the world for the better when really they’re just as evil as the tobacco CEOs but dressed worse.
Just dump the delivery apps altogether. And fix the US service industry. A person's living wage should not be dependent on the generosity of random strangers
ive been saying this for years most of these app companys will crash and burn i refuse to support any of them.... I used to work for a local delivery company I made a decent wage plus tips and bounus for every delivery and every other driver I dispatched..... we were fast reguardless if there was a tip because we were actually paid.... and no one was eatting your food and you knew you were getting it still hot..
Skipthedishes ad at the end of the video isnt it ironic
The parent company of Grubhub is Dutch based on the logo.
It's a shame people don't know how to tip. 15%-20%. Easy way that I do it is take your bill and divide it by 5. That's how much you should tip.  Ex. If your bill is $50 (after taxes)... 50/5= 10. Your tip should be around $10.  Ex. $75 bill 75/5=15.  Or just get one of those tip cards that you put in your wallet. That makes it super easy!
These delivery outfits do credits or freebies without any input from the restaurant.
I use my own people for deliveries. They make great money because they have developed a relationship with my customers which shows with my instore staff who get to know all our repeat customers when they call in and my guests feel valued and appreciated. We literally know by the order which customer it is and we do special extras to show them we value them. These sites are parasites to restaurants in general but its worse for the independent restaurant.
Is the issue in Restaurants and other such places in the US pay so poor? If the staff are not busy enough, they earn peanuts. Here in Europe, we pay a realistic minimum wage. In fact, there are colleges where you learn to be a professional waiter, fully trained in how to do the job. In that instance, the Waiter/waitress earns £4-12 more an hour than the minimum wage. A waiter in a restaurant I used to part owned would typically be paid £16 per hour and that was way back in 2018. People make a career out of being a waiter. It is the same across Europe, where people make a good living as a waiter/waitress.
A lot of people groan when they hear the word regulation, but sometimes that is what is needed to protect people. There would be NO regulation if businesses and people would do the right thing all the time, but they don't. This entire segment could have been called "Some greedy assh*le found a loophole in the system, and is exploiting people."
In Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad (1886), the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment applied to corporations. Since then the doctrine has been repeatedly reaffirmed in case law.  So...  Corporations are now PEOPLE?
We need to get off our hugely obese asses and drive to a restaurant to eat. This epidemic of paying multiple figures for a cup of coffee or flimsy pizza needs to stop. It will one day. When none of us has a dime left to our name.
I was a Motorcycle courier in Los Angeles for years. At 9ne time all the owners of the attorney services got together and decided to fire all of us and said we could come back as independent contractors. A few of us decided to come back but we actually ran our game as ICs and the services were not happy about it. They thought it was going to be business as usual but that was not the case. We started poaching the lawyers and offering our services direct to them and sut out the services. After all, we were the ones risking life and limb, buying the gas and maintenance and all the gear so why not be the one to make the money because we had all the cost of the biz so why not have the profit too.
I have never used any of theses apps. Havent figured out why so many others do. Hate waiting behind of these carriers waiting for my pizza order.
Girly in the audience at 00:45 screaming "WHAT?!" sends me every time
Hearing the skype joke a week or two after it was announced it will be shut down
20:26 this feels like important information to note
As a former food delivery driver on a bike, these companies fucking suck. They don’t provide anything except an app that determines how many jobs you get which pay you barely and sometimes below minimum wage. And sometimes they won’t even provide you with a job and so even if you’ve sliced out hours of your time to work, you sometimes don’t even make money. Not to mention the fact that they provide zero health coverage and the contract you sign isn’t even a formal employment contract but a “freelance” one so they have no liability if you for example get mugged, stabbed, or hit by a car. They also take a hefty chunk out of your salary.
I was stuck at home for over six weeks, unable to drive and, for a month, unable to walk - i had caregivers, but they didn’t cook and i couldn’t. Doordash was a lifesaver. I would order three Chinese meals at a time from the nearby restaurant and spread the food out over several days. I tipped the drivers well and i appreciated them tremendously.
Never used them, will never use them, glad to have never used them
Never ordered on any app of that kind, never will, and I enjoy Harry Potter more than ever.
I did about 6 years of pizza delivery in my high school/college years during the early 2000s. I was paid nothing. The delivery service was separate from the pizza place. We charged $1.00 per delivery and 50 cents an item. My boss took 60 cents per delivery and 25 cents an item so he could sit at home while we did all of the work. The maximum number of deliveries I could manage per hour was 12 and it had to be very busy for that. So needless to say, all of the money I made was on tips. And tipping was good and I really did make some really good money especially for a young age.  But tipping is ultimately a scam. I have come to realize that restaurants / delivery services should pay a straight wage, whether it be an hourly rate or per delivery. And this goes for serving, also. Workers need to know how much they're going to make, or at least get an even share of the sales that happen. Tipping does usually average out, but sometimes I lost money making drives to the house I knew never tips due to fuel expenses AND car wear and tear. Don't forget I put labor into that, too. But unlike most workers, I still put in my everything to every delivery because the job had to get done and it did all even out. But the non-tippers would be last if the route efficiently worked against their favor.  There's conflicting information in this video. Restaurants are claiming the delivery services are charging outrageous amounts of money while the delivery services claim they're breaking even at best. I realize they're competing to be the number one service that wins in the long run but they're clearly not losing money on the orders; what must be going on is they're dumping loads of money into advertising, and maybe development but I find it hard to believe that these high valued companies can't afford the development costs with those kinds of margins. So it's not the consumer who is making out; it's the advertising companies.  Back to my own experience, there was a time when my boss was discussing with other restaurants to combine the delivery service so that we could have more consistant rates of deliveries and enough staff to always deliver on time. We were buying the food from the restaurant and then reselling to the customers, basically. So it wouldn't have made a difference who we were delivering for. But my boss was a jerk and the plans for that fell through. It's unfortunate because I think a delivery service like Uber Eats is fantastic. It is much better if people work for a delivery company instead of the restaurant. There's just a lot of issues to work out with how the pricing is figured out. I cannot fathom how these apps would have so much cost to run their system, other than trying to gain more customers through expensive advertising campaigns. Their services should be cheap, the drivers should get paid a reasonable fee per delivery, and nobody should ever have to tip. I do tip very well, but I want our customs to change to where everyone just pays the same for the service so that I'm not paying for some cheap-skate to dine at a restaurant or get delivery to his house. Tipping is not fair; it's bribery.
The delivery charge is insanely low.  For a rush delivery of food from someone who is not an employee of the restaurant but just a delivery person, $20 would not be unreasonable.  Those people are being taken advantage of, their work is worth much, much more than they're getting.
tip for the trip, not the single piece of cake
Start an orphanage??  😂
Is it any wonder that mostly restaurant workers started screaming for extra money per hour when these apps kicked off. I went back to food service after over 30 years just to see what it was like out there now. Tried out with schlotzsky's because I love their sandwiches and more of my time was spent fulfilling food app pickup orders as opposed to people that came in and sat down to eat. Only 10 years ago while not enough to pay the bills people make for themselves, minimum wage for the basic duties expected in restaurant work would have otherwise been sufficient.
Never used one and never will
I stopped using restaurant delivery early on because it more than doubled the cost of food.  Convenience isn't worth as much as that.
As a person who almost got killed by friendly fire on a bloated military I personally think America should split and republicans go to the South, America stays the remainder except west coast goes to Mexico and Canada that may split off into their own country with Alaska. Hawaii can come too. I dont' think anyone will get that joke lol
I’m under 30 and I’ve def ordered food with the phone many times and that drawer full of menus is still going strong
I rarely use a delivery app, if ever. I will contact restaurants directly and many have their own drivers that deliver food the old fashioned way. Here in Orlando, I might order a meal that would typically cost $30 for two people. If I order through Uber Eats or Door Dash through the app immediately adds 20% to the food prices so the restaurants can make money, and they typically will tack on about $10-$15 for delivery fees, packing fees, etc.  So a meal that would cost $36 delivered directly by the restaurant including tip will cost about $50+ by using an app. Everyone loses in this scenario.
The 'rating' system is flawed, just like it is on Amazon - As a third-party seller, a buyer might be unhappy with a product they buy from you although you may have fulfilled that order perfectly, but buyers will leave a bad rating that will reflect on the seller instead of the product when it was the product that was the problem.
Well put
Listen, restaurants close within a couple years like 80% of the time, they can’t afford to pay their workers more so tipping is good
Someone and I'm not lying to you wanted me to deliver a baby to their grandparents😮😮 I refused. I literally told them that was so weird and unsafe. They got upset and said they were going to report me, but I also reported them. Nothing happened. Why cuz Uber doesn't do anything for their drivers. Oh yeah read the fine print of Uber they are allowed to listen in your conversation
Canada ❤😂
As of February 2025 I've never used a food delivery app and I wouldn't even know which one to pick if I did. I have no idea what the difference is between Door Dash, GrubHub, Postmates, Uber Eats, etc. Hell, I had to Google "food delivery apps" to make that list 😂
Last month, I did a delivery from Crumbl Cookies and had to stop at a 2nd Crumbl Cookies 16 miles away because each location was out of the other cookie. Round trip 37 miles. My pay was $6.50, including the $2 tip. I watched the lady eat both cookies outside her apts while I was waiting for another order. These apps are wild sometimes. I would suggest reading through Doordash/Uber Eats Reddit thread stories. It's insanity.
Did anyone notice at 2:10 the script writer was just being honest about his current state when writing Olivers script and John Oliver read it like a champ! Lool
The US is a crazy. I left for Medellin just about two years ago and I can't even believe I paid the tips I paid in the US. Everything costs more....and then you have to tip on top of that! Plus you have to wait so long in the US. They have turbo restaurnts here I can get food from like 25 restaurants in under 10 minutes. Everyone is on motorcycles. They can even deliver cash up to about $120 US in 10 minutes at near exchange rate prices.  The cost is less than $1 in fees for getting a full fridge full of food that takes them 40 minutes just to pick. Tipping is always optional but I usually will tip a  $1 or $2.  The other crazy thing is there is a market literally within a minute from anywhere you live.  Small little stores just as cheap as the big stores. In fact you usually pay more when you go to the Exito (walmart basically).  Nothing his perfect... but here they don't let the big companies get away with destroying the small ones through economy of scale and barriers to entry.
The apps ruined delivery when the restaurant or fast food ran delivery they had some standards and they controlled delivery, quality and service with the apps any fool or maniac can do whatever to your food and trust me the delivery people do so disgusting stuff especially since they can just hop to the next app. I stopped getting delivery once the apps took over even from places that had their own delivery I always just pick it up myself or eat in.
I just deleted DD off my phone. Thanks Last Week team!
who ever shouted "what" at 0:44 - I can't tell if it was disbelief or genuine confusion but I too think Uber eats should get the fuck out of my sexuality, culture, current events etc. Just like spaghetti o's shouldn't be making ads about 9/11....
Gig work is a joke . I took a ride Uber charged me 12 bucks. The driver  showed all he got 4.50 . All together the driver spent 20 minutes including coming to the pick up spot and then dropping. I tip the guy but this is just outrageous
Abi yoruldum a.. izlerken abi sen bu kadar diziyi nasıl izliyosun ya valla geçmiş olsun. Kimse senin işin kıskanmasın 😅😅
If you order fast food from a delivery app you you get what you deserve
I’ve seen people make DoorDash deliveries for $2.50 and drive 15 miles round-trip to get it
Uber eats sent me an email thanking me for making 1000 deliveries and then fired me the next day for an erroneous delivery in a busy hotel infested highway near an airport.  Even if the customer got the address wrong, they canceled me.    Now that I read these and John Oliver stories, I’m glad it happened and I went and got a part-time job elsewhere.  I’m retired from a decent career and I just wanted to stay busy and believe me with the mileage and the gas and the wear and tear on your car and the fact you have to pay taxes on your own anybody doing this for a living is not making any money and half of them are not filing taxes so they will wind up in prison at one point.  Looking at some other stories, here you are better off working for Dollar General.  At least you won’t drive the wheels off your car.  Would you like to get even like I have for the last three years?   I go to places where they stick the food on the shelf and I steal food on a regular basis at least five times a week.  I only steal from Uber. I leave all other orders there.  Call me every day you want and call me immoral but sometimes you have to get even.  I’m only doing what Trump taught me to do.
America turning to a corporate dystopian fucking nightmare
I don't tip. Never have, never will.
Please note outside the US you do not have to tip. America is backwards and does not understand the concept of a working wage.
I'm not responsible for someone else's wage. Period.
No, you don’t have to tip!  legislatures should enforce the owner to pay fair wages. Stop trying to make this a consumer issue
RATE 1 STAR DONT TIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET THE THING CRASH
I WILL NOT support the gig economy.  It always looked like a worker rip-off to me.  As much as some cabbies have to pay to get/stay in business, why should I pay lyft or uber (and yes, the companies get to biggest cut).
Ive NEVER used Grub Hub, Doordash, or Cart of any kind.  I CALL and give order to human being at a local Pizza BOGO with their own drivers. Delivery after dinner time  can take over an hour ❤ They always ask if thats ok, i always say yes.
I refuse to use them. All I ever see is people complaining they never received their order and other people getting other people’s orders😂😂
Distracting MAGA with cruelty while the rich attempt to benefit the rich and privatize Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Along with scaling back regulations and consumer protections so the rich corporations can get richer.
Uber Eats might not make money, but Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber Technologies Inc., including Uber Eats, made $24.2 million in 2023.
6:57 rip 9000$ or so they took from him, also why it show the doubles of the commission and the others with dif prices, thats one crazy month they charged
After half a dozen Door Dash orders, you get use to the spit added to your meal by a disgruntled Door Dash driver.
NO.... You shouldn't have to tip, sorry, I get people won't agree, but the job should pay enough so that tips are not an Absolute necessity, that's why there's a minimum wage, saying you Have to tip on top of what you already agreed to pay for the service is the whole reason these shit head companies can get away with treating people like shit....  Tipping is always nice, don't get me wrong, I'm not against tipping, but it shouldn't be a required, that just makes us another corporate tool, forcing the consumer to give a contracted worker charity so they can survive .... I don't blame the player, I blame the systems that allow them to abuse people in this way.....   Imagine if your boss/manager came to you and said they where cutting your wage, but if you do a good enough job maybe the customer will take pity on you & chuck a few dollars at you.....  Think that's ok ? I don't.
I’ve often wondered how this ‘business model’ manages to make anyone a profit…and now my best instinct’s have come to pass….THEY DON’T!😂
PoorUber says NYDeptLabor only allows delivery persons 5hours week; $17.99hr× 5hrs wk = $89.95, is this legal? Certainly is not fair! Uber takes 30%from restaraunts& charges customer! 🧐 Let God give Uber Justice.
To anyone thinking of doing this:take the money you earned in a day and divide it buy the number of miles you drove,that number is cents per mile.if the number is less than .75 cents per mile you are not breaking even and can make more money working anywhere other than there. Maintenance repair and replacement cost alone will leave you bankrupt.i know you think you made 200 bucks but you didn't.big picture!
this would be a better story if a real journalist investigated and made a real journalistic presentation
I had to dislike the video bc of the one slice of cake and YOU NEED TO TIP and the end where he said you need to tip even more now.. You americans really dont see the bigger problem which is being paid fair money for your work instead of living like a beggar who depends on other peoples handouts.. i still tip IF THE SERVICE IS REALLY GOOD etc but i dont tip just so the server/delivery driver can survive this month.. and neither should you bc that sounds a little like the us is extorting their people to pay other people instead of dealing with the problem like they are meant to
Bottom line. Use online delivery till it cost too much.
Here’s an idea… cook at home!! No delivery and WAY CHEAPER!
I’m sorry, but I hate the non word “App”. The fking word is APPLICATION. APPLICATION is the word. Everytime I hear or read “app” my IQ is lowered. App isn’t a fucking word!!!
Doordash kept charging my credit card and pass fees that i did not order! Uninstalled the app and never will use them again
Never used a food service app. Last delivery was a pizza from a local shop (not a franchise) that I'm pretty sure to this day still has their own pizza trucks.  The only "app" of these types I ever even installed was uber, only because I once signed up to drive as I thought i'd make some part time money.  Did one drive and said um no, this isnt a job, and i didnt really get to "pick" my hours, as when I wanted to work nobody needed rides/I wouldnt be offered any. Then get "alerts" when I wanted to be left alone. The paying to put miles on my car and deal with strangers in my vehicle, coupled with an app that tried to bait me to work when they needed, all for pocket change that barely covered the gas money was way too evident quickly... So I assume driving for uber eats is basically the same, except instead of strangers being in your car you have to deal with them accusing you of tampering with their food... No thanks...  I'd apply at a mcdonalds first if i need part time income again.
You have to tip extra on these apps— you have to you have to you have to. It’s one way we can stand up for the worker and still enjoy the benefits of this technology.
I come here for the MARIJUAN A+ Mentor that is John Oliver...  🌬️Divine!!!
GROCERIES PRICES ARE KILLING MY FAMILY!!!  Then 2 hours later that person is ordering 4 items off some fastfood dollar/value menu for a total of $35 before any tip on one of these food delivery aps.
I've only ever used door dash like once or twice.
In 2021, the average DoorDash executive was compensated approximately $223, 844. Their CBO made nearly $5 million, the COO made nearly $16 million, and the General Counsel was compensated a cool $10 million. Founder and CEO Tony Xu is worth around $3 billion.  Meanwhile, they pay drivers as little as $2 per delivery without compensation for gas or vehicle upkeep. They are classified as contractors rather than employees so receive no benefits or protection in case of a crash. Not to mention they will owe taxes at the end of the year because that money is not deducted from each paycheck. They are entirely at the mercy of tips, and as a veteran dasher I will confirm that plenty of people are willing to type "0" into the tip box. It isn't a living wage after expenses. It is an exploitative business model that uses people and then hangs them out to dry once their car stops running - which doesn't take long, because one can easily average less than $1 per mile. After gas, maintenance, and taxes, the compensation is even worse than most minimum wage jobs.  Companies like Uber and DD need to be regulated. Don't work for them if you can possibly avoid it.
👍🏻❗️In Cali, I called Wałģře'ens to find out when my delivery of several prescriptions for delivery from the pharmacy, only to find out that "Instacart" had it. They told me to call Instacart...WTH? Why am I calling Insta?? Bye-bye🎶 🎵Bye-bye Walğee'ňs 🎉
Uber eats doesn't make money because they suck. I have a solution to change that and told them, yet they did nothing. I quit after I found out that they stole money from me.
😢
"I'm like Miss Piggy the way I'm hittin' that Green"🐷🐸🌬💨🍃 is Crazy   especially coming from you
This is the reason I pick up my food every time. It's bad enough I'm eating fast food, or even take out. I'm not letting some tech company take a piece of the action!
scammers
Let me help, I was a restaurant GM during the pandemic, NO ONE SIGNED UP FOR THEM!!!! They just sent the equipment, it was literally a hostile takeover
Just listen and tell me you don’t have more fun, listening to the devil. And happy Easter by the way.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Also, Many auto insurance companies do not offer coverage if you're driving for a food delivery service and the food delivery companies only cover you while you are on an actual delivery. So, once you have hit "Delivery Complete" on the app but are still on the app waiting for another delivery offer to come through that you want, you are effectively not covered by any insurance.
4.2 out of 5 can be termination in doordash.
they are here to stay for better or worse
Increasing wages is a great idea no doubt. However, that would increase prices and customers would complain just the same. Lower wages and expecting a tip does motivate better service. You can disagree or think it's a bad model, but it's human nature. Go ahead and raise prices and take away tips, just don't whine when your waiter doesn't "smile more". Why would they give a 💩? They're paid the same either way.
That amounts to profiteering
I deleted uber eats after the Melbourne lockdowns finished. Best decision ever.
Stop breeding if you dont have time to shop and cook. I hate door dash. I used to work at a pizza shop, people would frequently order a single 2liter for $12 fucking dollars. And the kicker was it was always some order that was like 7 blocks away. Yeah im sure its not laziness.  Fuck all these apps. Never used em never will. Never shopped at walmart, never used Amazon or temu, never voted for a democrat or republican, people need to lesrn how to stick to the guns.
How do people actually make any money with these delivery apps???  Get a real job!!!  Someone needs to hook up with senior citizens....  You'll have a built-in clientele and they generally have money.  You'd have a more settled and reliable income plus you'd be doing a good deed....
T😅h😮e😮r😮e😮😊’s😮 no conte😅😅st. Shee😮sh 😊😊.
I read the news alot during the pandemic. Chains were about to go bankrupt. Gig economy saved it   Now its predatory 😂 people behind the counter cannot stand us. Its sop to serve the lobby before DOOR DASH drivers... ive got my order after someone who strolled in 5 minutes after i got there. Door dash takes as much as it can from the store and give the driver 2 BUCKS!   I now, almost exclusively, shop and deliver for Walmart spark. They own their own app. Ive been thinking, since all restaurants are owned by 3 or 5 people anyway, maybe they can make thwir own app? Shrug 😂😅
Im in the tattoo industry for 36 years. A shark-tank funded company created a website that scrapes tattoo business for photos and info and creates a scheduling page, but doesn’t allow customers access to the phone, email or website of the tattoo studios. The scheduling site creates prices and sets up appointments without contacting studios and takes payments from the client in advance. So when a client arrives to my store, i have to contact the website and set up an account with them and authorize them to take 40% of the tattoo fees we never quoted or agreed to. We had to send cease and desist notices to Kevin O’Leary and the company director to demand the protection of our data, removal of our listing. All of it. The whole deal was like this listing of restaurants who have not signed up. In 36 years, I’ve never needed a company to back up or assist my appointments. Its just not normal to have some third party get in the middle of your business. Im saddened for these restaurants who got fleeced and basically hijacked over another company’s profits. Thats an ugly thing to happen. The risk is that when we dont follow thru on whatever scam these companies are pulling, we look bad to the client and bad reviews against us  will be the result.
I wonder if the food delivery drivers that complain about tips, tip the people at the restaurant who prepared the food for them to deliver...cause I've never seen it...and they're basically taking the tips the to-go people used to get.
The solution is to order from the restaurant directly.
I lived in Minnesota when they passed a law forcing a minimum wage and I got three to four emails from Uber/Lyft and day saying they’re sad they’ll have to pull out of Minneapolis because the laws would make it impossible for them to operate
"and can't enjoy Harry Potter anymore. You can't spell Millenial without three massive L's" LOOOOOOOOOOL
I have never used a delivery app.  It just seems like a waste of money.  If I want restaurant takeout, I’ll go and get it.
I'm just so glad I can play organ as a side hustle instead
-Order $10 worth of food. -Bill comes out to $30.
watching this in front of my pad-thai
Well, I'm glad I have a very good pizzeria just round the corner. I've got no problems with my feet. I just walk round the block once, a small block, and come back with a pizza. . .
I ordered from a restaurant with an order of $8.99. when it was delivered the cost was $18.00. I won't be doing that again. No more DoorDash for me.
Johny you been eating too much crow you have black feders on your teeth  do it do it do it😂😂😂😂😂
Omfg I'm dying...... lose babies !!! Lose babies omfg that's funny
Look at the basically pimping of doordasers.
With my experience at MultiQoS, a leading software development company, I believe there’s a solution through creating more efficient and fair platforms. MultiQoS specializes in developing custom food delivery solutions that can help restaurants and delivery workers by optimizing processes, improving communication, and ensuring better transparency. We can help build apps that benefit all parties involved while creating a sustainable business model.
same with massage therapists working for APPS- they demand you wear their logos, etc etc- but no insurance ( if you have a terrible client that harasses you).
Food Delivery. When you want to pay $138.50 for $12 worth of food. And since our Shoppers / Drivers are Independent Contractors, we pay them $0.00.
haha now I want to eat im hungry
I work at a prominent chain restaurant that mist people have been to.  1. Delivery Apps receive all the money NOT the servers/staff.  2. There are more Delivery orders than actual people who dine in.  3. Servers arent tipped and cools arent tipped for preparing and bagging orders
Wierd don't have kids and im a chef 1 star michiline  learn to cook dont have 16 kids.work for youraelf like farmor day trade as I do causw education  and I teach a bit of history on the side
I’ve always loved the devil’s part a lot more. It’s funky and ripping. Simple yet amazing!!! Yeah the devil won that fight! Hail Satan
great video.
I'm still confused about the delivery fee on Doordash.  If I choose to tip $0 then the driver doesn't get paid despite the delivery fee already added.
I tip zero when it’s demanded BEFORE I get my food. It’s a fee. Simply charge more or change the timing.   The failed business model is not my problem. If the workers are not getting paid enough they should work elsewhere.   Thanks.
It is insane to me that people use this service. Especially people who are having money issues.   People want to make jokes about how out of touch corporate America is when they say the middle class should stop buying avocado toast or their Starbucks coffee.   But there's a lot of truth to it when you're buying these items on doordash with a 200% price increase.
It's 19$ more to get my kid a happy meal from Uber eats than to get one in person so I don't understand why it's not profitable. Maybe they need to advertise less
VCs (investors) definitely made tons of money after the IPO. The company expanded too much and hired a bunch of smart people doing useless things, and playing politics. I cried by hearing about the story of the delivery guy, that's why I hate the Silicon Valley startup VC model. Everyone loses but VCs are super rich!
everybody who tips supports the system
I ran doordash for a bit. I was getting good orders, 10 to 20 dollars each. then I turned down a single 4 dollar offer and got stuck with only 2 and 3 dollar orders. i quit immediately.
As an individual in a wheelchair and now also dealing with 2 stage 4 wounds. food delivery helps me stay alive. also can't help that i'm poor and have to leave a minimal tip.
I deliver uber eats on the side. Sometimes it’s 1 day a week, sometimes is 5. There’s no way anyone can make a living solely driving uber eats, and that’s with a car that gets 40mpg.  I had a request to pick up 8 deliveries from a local walmart for $193. I got there and was told someone else picked it up two hours prior. I contacted the customers and asked if it was received and they said no.   I contacted uber eats and they canceled it on their end. My cancelation rate was now affected by it and is at 9%. If it gets to 20% I’ll get kicked off the platform. now I understand if I canceled the order because I didn’t want to do the trip, but for something like this that I have no control over, why are the honest drivers getting the shaft? Uber doesn’t care about the drivers. Just as long as they get their money
BAN TWITTER. BUSH AND GORE ALREADY GAVE ELON BILLIONS OF  OUR TAX DOLLARS. HE WOULDN'T BE WHERE HE IS TODAY. He was taking over forty thousand dollars for a deposit to buy a tesla with a 2 yr. delivery date which he had a hard time meeting. In the good old days we used to boycott businesses to make a change. We should be boycotting businesses that support racists and sexual abusers..ľt used to work. Now all the rich billionaires get tax cuts, environmental issues overlooked, and  get put in teumps cabinet. If i find out  tips go to employers i will no longer tip.
I've heard  her speak twice and like what I've heard
I kind of challenge the notion that we're getting more under these services as consumers. Maybe the math checks out in major metropolitan areas like new york where costs are higher, but once you factor the inflation on the menu prices, the fees, and the subscription services to lower the fees, you're still paying far more than the marquee price of the food in the restaurant + delivery fee. In a less expensive state, a pizza from a major chain like pizzahut is $15, but plus tax and $5 for delivery. But on doordash, it's $18+, you're still paying 4 dollars for delivery + taxes, range fees, etc. Or you spend $10 a month in order to save 50-100% off the delivery fee. The math only making sense if by paying that $10 per month, you're effectively pledging "Yes, I do wish to die like Elvis on a toilet."
regulation to protect workers and consumers would be a huge silver bullet for a lot of these dirtball companies. But we've been taught to think regulation is anti American/capitalist...when really it drives quality and wages forward.
Many years ago, I was having a rough day delivering food. It was raining, we were slammed, I was getting stiffed all over the place. Near the end of my shift, a woman at a University of South Carolina sorority gave me a 5 dollar tip on 6 dollar  order. Made my day❤
If no one else says it, I will. I'm thankful to you, Phil. Your show has become a regular part of my life and I'm greatful for it. So thank you. Best wishes to you and yours.

I used to order pizza from a particular restaurant that delivered.  Excellent pizza so I always tipped well.   So a large za was about $35 bucks including tip when they had their own delivery driver.    Now they switched to uber eats, the fee+ tip+ pizza is now $70!!  for a large pizza - Haven't ordered since.  And the fiascos that ensue - delivery to the wrong building, wrong suite, leaving the order on the street and texting a photo?  Is that what I tipped for?  Never again.    Restaurants that use these services are doomed bc the delivery service doesn't care about the restaurant's reputation. ' Leaches' is the correct term to describe them.
wait, I thouht the CEO got all the cash? I wanna see that C-O tier of salaries, before I decide whose [profiting or not!
Gotta love all the fake woke stingy people who just don't want to tip pretending that it's acceptable to skip tipping if they can't afford it. If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford takeout. One day maybe workers in the US will be paid fairly but stiffing workers who get paid $2 and some change per hour at a restaurant is a terrible way to behave and it's not acceptable even to protest tip culture.
the backpack is great for board games, honestly
do these companies pay you for running their app on your phone, relying on your phone service, internet and or battery power ... they already rely on your vehicle, you pay the insurance, wear and tear, devaluation ... during the pandemic they moved into your home, used your internet and phone service...does anyone ever say no anymore?
With all the crazy fees they charge the customers, it's insane that they are still taking such a large cut on the other side, too.
Mr biology professor. Can I leech off fthat one? My new friend. A restaurants owner.
I was busy at work one day and decided to pony uo the delivery fees rather than go out and I couldn't place an order at any place until 2:45 PM. Seemed odd but I realized that meant there was NO delivery poeople working until 2:45. Maybe they need to be on a schedule rather than bringing the businesses to a cxomplete halt??
Ever Google map some of the non-chain restaurants? I found one that was a building smaller than my beddroom that had like 50 menu items and four restaurants all in the same building and one restaurant that was a house. Someone was selling food out of their kitchen.
Order from the restaurant and go pick it up. You'll save a ton of money.
Johnny's fiddle reel is based on folk music, but it's much more technically difficult
This feels like the companion piece to the WWE video.
John's accent makes it sound like 'Geek' workers instead of 'Gig' workers to my ears and its funny
The company was keeping the tips😂😢
My city created their own app, it's a lot easier.
Tip problematic is an issue in the US in general and not specific to food delivery.
Customers are *not* winning either. Prices are being spiked, food shows up cold, size of portions are tiny and the quality of food has really dropped! No one is happy!
I've talked to multiple uber drivers about how much they make average.  And once you know their average, and compare it to all of the costs they may face as a 1099 worker, I don't get why anyone would do it.   Its fine if you do it once in a while to just put some extra money in your pocket.  But it doesn't pay to make it a profession.
Well done! My bestie owns a restaurant  in L.A. and the delivery apps carve a whopping 30% of her orders.
Phew, I remember arguing with my brother about who would call for  delivery 😂
Hey guys,,, I use the cc feature on your site, because... Kinda hard of hearing...  Can you pleeeze look at this feature??? I can't hear you!! So if you want my support...  Please ask this department to step up their game!!! It really sux when I can't hear you!!!
We lost Albert's burritos during the pandemic, they used to put French fries in their burritos theres another location b they use tater tots Best burritos Ive ever had TRUTH
A single slice of cake delivered across town for no tip at all. Oh my god that is infuriating💩
It would make sense in big cities for restaurants to create a cooperative. That way they have the pool of delivery workers but they don't have to pay the delivery company margins because effectively any profit the cooperative makes is split between the restaurants. Yes these cooperatives will be regional but in places like London or New York most of the people buying from them will do 90+% while at home. Therefore does it matter if they need to download a different app for the occasional time they are ordering in a different city.
I used to do delivery apps and they’re a fucking waste of time. I do just rideshare these days and I make a hell of a lot more part time.

What was wrong with buying ingredients and cooking? If people don't have time to cook then something is wrong with work hours. When I worked 12 hours a day, I still had time to cook. It's cheaper, it's healthier in most cases, it is a pleasant activity for a lot of, if not for most people.
I worked for Postmates for a short time in San Diego. I was constantly sent to pick up orders on one side of the county, then had to deliver that food to a person on the opposite side of the county. I'm sure my rating wasn't great because after picking up food at a restaurant at an obscure location in El Cajon and delivering to a mall with paid parking in La Jolla the food is often time cold and soggy.  I even argued with a restaurant for the customer once because they ordered a hot cocoa and were receiving a Styrofoam cup and a packet of swiss miss. Then, after being forced to take it I apologized profusely to the customer for the restaurants screw up because I didn't want the blame.

Wow.
As a gay that add was fuckin amazing
Having been an English major back in the mid 90s, I can promise you that while my backpack wasn't as large as the food service ones, I definitely carried at least as much weight and probably more. That does not mean people should. They should not. 75 pounds of either books or food pulling on your back is not good.  That's why I'm starting my orphanage.
The devil's part is pretty good but the bet was who the better _fiddler_ was and while the devil's backup demon was absolutely killing it with that bass line, Johnny demonstrated a superior fiddling prowess and thus won the bet
Never used an Uber, or Grubhub
Once delivered garlic powder and condoms. That was the whole order. No tip. Hope they dont use them together
John Oliver forgot about this as soon as he finished filming the segment. Can we deport John Oliver and Russell Brand?
Ahahaha. I worked at blockbuster. Now I feel old. Thanks John!!!
@22:30... Cold world bwoy
You don’t tip unless the food is good.  Tipping in advance of eating……is stupid.  Also, if a business model is garbage……they go out of business.  Sharpen your pencil and try something else that will make you money.  If you’re an employee……welcome to employment…..it’s not here for you……you are here for the employer.  Always.
Your destiny awaits.  Come to US and Canada……I dare you.  Don’t forget to check with those that already live there.

The apps themselves are pretty badly run, too. UberEats and Doordash always reset my address to an address that doesn't exist, even when I manually change it and put in the special directions where to go to get to my place. No matter how I do it, it just usually ends with me getting yelled at by the driver for putting in the wrong address, even when I try to explain that it's Uber/Doordash and not me. The only reason I haven't is because I can't get a driver's license (failed 3 times). I still give the drivers big tips and 5 star reviews though, even when they make me cry.
Microsoft catch 'n killed Skype.
Techno feudalism...🤮
Starting an Orphanage ??? Where ??? In Ukraine ?.?. 🤣🤣🤣
the "bottom friendly menu" ad literally has my jaw on the floor what the FUCK
a bar in my area  with super good food I ordered from them and when the delivery person got there they called me and told me that "they don't take postmates and don't accept the payment from them so I have to pay for it and then postmates will pay me"  yes, they made the driver front for my food. I felt really bad.   I saw a review for the same place of someone years ago being pissed off with the STORE because Postmates listed them and after 2 hours their order wasn't delivered, and when they called the bar said " we don't deliver" and the order er took that as the bar is listing themselves on the delivery sites and gave the bar a bad review for the apps behavior.
About the guy working with a broken foot, I think that's more of an indictment of the american healthcare system than anything else
Well, you are wrong, though. On many levels. A) I heard the apps keep all or most of the tips for themselves. B) They have started to squeeze the customer too. With fees you won't believe. Back then I could order for 20€ in a restaurant (over their website) and get it delivered for free. Now I would have to pay 20€ for fees alone. And the food is 20% more expensive than in the restaurant, too.  If I already spend over 60€ on 30€ worth of food, I don't have money left for tipping.
5:27 Yeah. I recently tried to order takeout without getting one of the big services involved. Aaaaand … no dice. No one offers it anymore. Even large chains who could have their own department outsourced it to these services. In Berlin, Germany (that's in Europe for you Americans).  Well, dominos still had it, but I've seen the restaurant they are preparing the meals in. They are just one health inspector visit away from permanent closing.
I order from Uber Eats frequently, and they have been wanting to sign up for their membership for a long time now. If they had notified once or twice, I'd understand, but since they have been badgering me for so long, I wonder how they are going to profit from it. I pay them so much more in delivery per order, then why do they want me to sign up for a membership?
Eye opening video on how these apps will ultimately raise their prices once they have destroyed the existing infrastructure, but I have tried ordering straight from restaurant websites, and the overall cost along with delivery charges comes out to be higher by 2-3 dollars per order. As someone who orders in frequently, I just don't want to pay so much more because it adds up.
Massachusetts votes today on actual benefits for app drivers and on incremental wage increases for tip workers. YAY.
if a restaurant is locally owned or otherwise a small business, sometimes they will just get one of their guys to get in a car and bring it to you rather than take the cut these apps eat out of their profits LMAO we need to bring back on-staff drivers, we have the portable card-scanning technology that eliminates the "reading my card numbers out loud" anxiety i always got ordering delivery as a kid

Leeches ?  I didnt realize american death care was on your exam table.
I made 27k with Uber last year before expenses... none of the low income laws applied to me, and I ended up paying about 4 k in Federal taxes.  Had no insurance, had no benefits, no low income tax brakes, city parking tickets, the state had me for another 1k in state taxes, and now after an accident not even my full coverage insurance wants to pay me...  playing with UBER is bringing me to homelessness.  Everyone got a cut of the little I was making, but I didn't get protection from anybody ... not by the City of Los Angeles, not by the State of California, not by the Federal Government, and most definitely not from my blood sucking UBER employers.  I am in need of a real decent job, the kind that rabide by our constitution, with 40 paid hours per week, with medical insurance, sick leave.  I will never again play with a virtual wannabe jobs
Customers aren't being subsidized neither... With apps the total price of purchise is at least 50% higher.
food delivery apps suck in general
I'm so glad that I've always assumed ordering one item was a complete waste of a Dasher's (Or instacart's) time- Even when all I really want is like, one thing, I always make sure to get a few things for later, so I don't have to waste their time later too. I cannot imagine ordering a single slice of cake, unless perhaps someone was buying it long distance for someone else as a birthday thing but still, that's insane! Why would you ever do that to someone!
I was expecting the dude at 1:36 to say 'disabled people' and got whiplash by the 'Drunk or stoned' L O L. I'm an adult living at my folks place, disabled and can't drive and these delivery apps have made me able to have a real choice in the things I want. If I go to the store with or ride along to a fast food place and I order more than they think I should have (Even when I do the same from instacart or door dash, that extra quantity is for LATER because I know I'm gonna want it tomorrow or the other half for dinner, why call someone to deliver twice and waste their time when I could do it once?)  I know it sounds ridiculously silly that having an app like this helps me have more independence, and god I hate how bad these people are treated, but for people like me in situations where we can't drive or have the energy to do major shopping, delivery apps are not even joking, a life saver. I always tip my drivers as much as I can afford, which I wish was more, if only disability paid us fairly. I wish they were paid a proper wage from the start!
this is why prices have sky-rocketed. boycott these f'n apps now!
Uber Eats would start making money if they'd break down deliveries into counties instead of having us drive 2 to 3 times as far which basically ends up costing us gas or breaking even. Basically making deliveries almost impossible to profit from.
I’m an instacart worker. Instacart went public last year and since then they’ve lowered worker pay several times, such that on some orders they offer $4 pay to shop and deliver an order using my vehicle, gas, phone and time. Apps are also bad about combining customer orders into batches that lower worker pay while matching low or no tip orders with those that tip well.
Use the app to get a customer base, then give the good customers your own number and sell em on using you instead of the app. Build a base, provide a good service and then kick the app to the curb.
Why cant an open source free app replace these leeches?
These are like mini models of what the capitalist system is, scraps for the labor all the real gains go to the top who do very little in comparison.
"Leeches" apt description i would throw venture capital into that club as well.
In the beginning of the pandemic, deliveries were kinda ok. But then the market got flooded, too many runs weren't paying enough (in the literal sense, not the moral sense: not enough to pay for expenses), and the delivery distance wasn't shown until after accepting the order, so a lot of orders would end up getting abandoned halfway through. Just shut off the app, and switch to the next. The only one who profited was the dog.
I no longer use these apps. But when I did, I once accidentally tipped someone $.10 instead of $10. I immediately realized my mistake and called the company to see if I could adjust my tip. They said there was nothing they could do which was heartbreaking...
These companies do charge everyone more money than what the item costs on the menu eventually prices do go up on. Sliding scale. Workers need to realize these companies do not have their best interest involved and are predatory.  The illusion they sell telling workers they can make a quick buck it’s better getting a real full time job with health benefits,  paid time off and paid overtime.
Deleted all the apps✅
How can they be taking as much as 58% of a restaurant's revenue, and NOT be making a fortune?
Basically Food Apps have become the Mafia.
No. You mustn't tip. Prepetuating a broken system will not fix it.
I always give 5 stars. I order using instacart and uber eats or directly from the restaurant if possible. I appreciate the service and also appreciate being able to order for friends and family who are well across town or in another state.  I couldn't possibly order and not give a tip.
Disabled people, frail seniors and people on CANCER treatment - people who CANNOT walk through a supermarket find services such as Instacart invaluable
Investigate poverty for profit please!!!! Govt gives millins in funding to organizations to supposedly help instead of giving all those funds directly to the source. Like housing authority Like food stamps
“We’re not profitable. We’re losing money. Also, California, here’s 184 million fucking dollars we’re willing to spend to screw over the people who make our business model possible.”
I used to drive for Uber, please tip your Uber drivers. When you look at how much the Uber ride you’re taking costs, I’d only get a small fraction of that. Imagine eating a slice of pie, except you only get the crust and maybe one small bite of filling. That’s what driving for Uber feels like.
How TF are customers winning..?😅 I'm sorry but no. Customers aren't winning. We literally pay double the price for the orders including tips.. If the restaurants are getting only half, then where TF is the money going....? This isn't a subsidy..!😅
Regarding tipping, in my Limited research, my understanding is delivery drivers don’t receive all of the tip you leave on the app and it is better to tip cash in person if you can.
Skype disappeared because Microsoft bought it and let it wither so their new Teams app wouldn't have competition. Once again: Capitalism!
I think the core issue is it's a choice to work for these companies. I get there bad companies cut u don't have to work for them ........ This will trigger some ppl
Thats crazy. In Australia we don’t ever tip. We just pay the workers correctly to begin with. Crazy I know.
I’m sorry for the delivery people, but honestly, with Uber charging an extra “service” charge apart from the delivery charge, I’m not going to tip. Ordering food is expensive enough as it is.  Frankly, it’s not the courier’s fault these companies are so greedy and selfish and fucked up, but it’s not the customers fault either.   For some people, like me, ordering food from apps is the only comfortable way to have lunch every day, but that doesn’t mean I’m rich, and paying for food+service+delivery+tip is sometimes simply not possible.  These companies should be LEGALLY REGULATED so the CANNOT make up charges at whim and so that more money is paid to couriers. This is not and cannot be customers/couriers fault.
I usedto complain that i had to do it because my car was broken. then i just realized i have legs and exercise is good for me.

"Restaurants are our family" -- Wildly abusive uncle
biggest reason for inflation since 2020
i came here because the restaurant i worked at recently received a 500 dollar order without realizing they were on grub hub. so the issue is still going and is targeting small, start up restaurants.
Dropout already made the skype jokes 😅
Skype didn't fucked up, they were bought buy Microsoft and Microsoft build Teams over Skype (for a long time, the process running under Teams were still named Skype). So Skype is used everywhere in the end.
I live in a small New Zealand town.  We don't have any of this.  We prepare 99% of our own meals - the scientific consensus is that if you're eating home cooked, you're probably healthier and saving money, .  We grow a lot of our veggies and we have chickens for eggs.  If we go out, there's no tipping in this country, waiters get a proper salary.  And moving all those tiny parcels of food with all that packaging seems so inefficient.  In a wealthy country like the US, the wage slavery of the people who make the deliveries reflects the deep divide between rich and poor.  Yes NZ has other big food problems, like sugar and obesity so it's not perfect but I look at this and I think that's FUBAR.
17:40 the guy who was recording this video also got hit by a car recently, although he wasn’t seriously hurt it could have been significantly worse
I am so old skool! I've never used one of these apps. I call the restaurant and pick my order up! I don't get deliveries precisely because I don't want to tip!  I guess that's an easy option if you live in a popular NYC neighborhood.
Bottom meal is wildah😂😂😂
Do what?
End tipping, ensure decent wages.
Chains will probs go back to doing their own deliveries

they are profitable you dont to get their size without actually making a profit, they just know how to smudge the numbers to avoid paying as much taxes as possible. ergo not profitable

Seriously, that guy that ordered a single piece of cake WITHOUT TIPPING, how sad must his life be
Oliver was either in the know or predicted the future. Either way GOAT'd
This is all a advertising con job by not only food delivery apps but restaurants that deliver themselves. I was sick at home and couldn't get out. I'm also not working and have to pay medical bills on top of it. I ordered 2 stuffed cheesey breads from a Dominos less than 5 miles away. Cost with delivery charge and respectful tip: $42.00!! Yup. For only two cheesy breads. You know what? F*&k you. I'd rather starve.
Mandatory wage was the worst thing ever pushed prop 22 is also a  disaster
Grubhub sounds like the absolute worst offender out of all the delivery apps. If any of them go out of business, I hope they do very soon. They take scummy corporate greed to an egregious new level.
Watching while waiting for my doordash 😬
The orphanage guy looks oddly like woody Allen
Unfortunately restaurants are pushing drive through and apps and dissuading dining in.   Most 24 hour eatery’s have very limited dine in hours.   It takes 20 mins to come in and order at fast food places even though there is almost 20 people behind the counter.   Cash only places are a big turn off.   And you are not allowed to walk through a drive through.   The only places that are great service wise are bars and coffee shops.   And don’t get me started in food trucks being Constrained to tourist areas.   Creating what we have coined as a food Desert.    Especially after 9:00 at night
I always pick up food, I don’t use delivery service since they upcharge all the menus prices and then add three to four different taxes and fees and then ask for tips. Like fuck that my 13$ meal comes out to 20$
Pizza places deliver within certain boundries and hire people with cars . Yet Uber eats has delivery city wide with people on bikes ?!
The poor workers when they waste so much it's so sad
I recently ordered over Lieferando (Grubhub) because the website of the restaurant said it only offered pick up currently. But when the food arrived it was staff from the restaurant. I asked him about the website and he said he'd been delivering all day. So the delivery app got 15% for just forwarding the order and the restaurant delivered the order itself. Next time I'll try the phone.
That story about the deliverer with the broken foot got me.
I will never tip unless i get table service. It's up to Uber eats and doordash to pay drivers not me
The United States, where slavery never actually went away.  It is just continually repackaged to look legitimate.
I disagree. The more we tip, the more excuse there is for the companies to underpay the workers.
In Germany, the drivers built local works councils, effectively leading to the result that core rights as working times, data privacy and fair payments are secured. Additionally, they receive their equipment from their employers (as it should be).
These apps don’t benefit anyone but themselves
That pandemic ad also used the historic African American landmark, and civil rights location, Ben's Chilli Bowl as a prop to sell it's service  Also I ordered two slices of cake once at 11 pm
Now there is a new term for missing opportunities in front of our face- Skyped or to have been, Skyped. These app companies have gone the way Ticketmaster did as a go between the customer end use and product/service provider. They pay more, the restaurant preparing the food pays more to get the business. Everyone pays more but for how long can most afford it?
UberEatsYourProfits
I dont order take out and hence i dont pay tips. I cook my own food instead
The US surely a third world shithole.
I've done side jobs where I actually lost money.  One of the weirdest examples is when I had to drive 3 hours each way just to make sure that a box that was shipped there had all the equipment.  Instead of getting at least a few hours of work, I got maybe one and reimbursed for the wear and tear on my car.  Not worth 6 hours of unpaid driving.  There needs to be protections for anyone who does work like with the food delivery apps.  Across the board, something needs to be done.  I really hope that time comes soon.
yea id sue the fuck out of the car who hit me and maybe grub hub lol
Not the "sells jewelry on Etsy" joke as I sit here listening while trying to make my little side hustle Esty shop work. (╥﹏╥) All too real lol!
I don't feel for the delivery drivers using apps, go and get a delivery job from the actual restaurant instead of begging for tips with gig deliveries.

comments for the algo
13:00 Holy cognitive dissonance Wordy McNumbers, they value their time more than money? Is that why they are selling their time to you in exchange for money? dolt
Pay people livable wages,period!
This needs a follow-up and a look into if it makes sense to pay tips only in cash directly into the delivery peroson's hands as some of these giant corporations hold money hostage as they use it to turn a profit on stock markets and such before turning over any of it to restaurants and delivery workers etc...
This guy is not funny at all. Easiest audience. But the reports are good.
I refuse to do business with any business that doesn't hire their own delivery drivers.
I live in Minneapolis where delivery drivers are paid more than $16/hour plus tips (it's the law here). I am kind of disappointed that you didn't talk about the outrageous prices and service fees people who use delivery apps have to pay, as well as the awful customer service, lack of compensation for missing/wrong orders, the list goes on and on. Uber Eats is possibly the most predatory company I have ever encountered openly operating within this country. I can say with a clear conscience that I wish those running the company end up penniless and in prison for how they try to benefit from royally screwing everyone who makes their business possible. Just read the app reviews for Uber Eats (which by the way are doctored to automatically give 5 stars whenever someone writes a review to boost the app's rating) and you will see how much hatred former customers have for this company. A missed opportunity to shed light on a business model that is essentially robbing it's customers without real consequences.
Uber eats is the worst app to work for. They can offer a big tip, take it back after they get their order. Because they let customers get away with it.
And because we are independent contractors, most places won't let us finance most things. Because they don't consider delivery app driving as a legitimate job. Even though I make more app delivery as opposed to working for places like Papa John's.
Starting a orphanage? WTF..LMAO
Grubhub never should have made that commercial. I applied to work for them 3 times and 2 years later, nothing. I got hired after background checks immediately by Doordash, Instacart and Uber eats. They definitely don't want to provide for a family since they barely hire.
Sean is a legend
A company dose not have to give millions to ceo's and continuall stock profit to be a good bissness if it's not traded and you pay your emplyes good you bissness can continue like theses delivery apps are said to be not making profit but still operating and speeding money on lobying too sounds like ther must be some profit
That millenial joke was brilliant
Grubhub, to me, is like Amazon: I know it's evil, but it's just too god damn convenient.
I had an experience where a delivery driver dropped me off a kebab. My only recourse was to tell McDonalds that I did not order a kebab.
Hearing these stories from the US makes me appreciate Europe more than ever... Yes we also have our problems but I would say overall the main priority is people and not making money out of everything like in the US

If you make more than $600 in the us in some states, it kinda screws you on your taxes. Also you can’t buy a house or get a car or rent an apartment as an independent contractor as your labeled working under those companies door dash Uber eats etc.
John really playing the devil's advocate...
This tipping business must stop.  You don't tip a supermarket checkout operator. You don't tip the plumber. You don't tip the bus driver. You don't tip the flight attendant.  So why tip other occupations? It's just an excuse for greedy, nasty contemptible employers to deliberately pay as little as possible. There should be a big increase in the minimum wage so that all workers are paid a living wage.

I use the app to look at the menu so I know what I wanna order when I call. Ain't paying app prices
Just go to the restaurant and get fresh hot food i guess? 😅
Bro I don’t know how anyone affords food delivery in this economy
Gig app companies are highly exploitive and unethical in some of the worst ways imaginable in 2024, Im not sure how governments have not clamp down on them thats a total mystery, slave labor exists in the west but its pushed so hard under the rug its frightening
Is a world without electricity a better world?
Honestly, humans really need to stop messing with their local ecosystems. I'm from Ontario, Canada, and when I was young, the government approved a massive cull of milkweed. Years later, we learned that not only was milkweed vital for the Monarch butterflies, but that it was likely well know to the ones who authorized the cull.  Ecosystems are like Prince Rubert drops. They are super tough when looked at as a whole, but all it takes is breaking it at the right point to completely shatter the whole thing.
I'm pulling in 4k to 7k a month,  never been in an accident, and nearly a 5 star rating on all 5 apps I deliver on. I've been doing it for years and I'm not even  in a major city. If you suck at customer service or don't manage your time correctly you'll suffer in this business. The delivery driver coverage in this episode is completely off. Work hard and smart.
They make money from the data when they reached point of customers ..By selling the app .......>See what these APPS do is get users on board ordering collect that data and base company value off the number of customers ...another company will buy it then fold that into there company .......so profits dont come untill there ready to abandon ship
Also: always tip  great YT channels 👍even if an episode is weak.
THE THING HE SAID ABOUT ORDERING FOOD IN SEVERE WEATHER IS SO TRUE. Sincerely, a doordash driver. However, since you can choose when to work, going out in severe weather is also partially your fault. Needing money is a heck of a motivator, though. I've been out on some pretty bad snow and ice roads before.
Crazy to think in the 90s dominoes had to stop forcing it's delivery drivers to meet their 30 minute delivery deadline cause their drivers were getting into too many accidents. The apps are now kinda doing the same thing with delivery times but if their workers get killed or end up injuring someone else by accident they can just wash their hands of it cause they're not technically their employees
Delivery App CEO's are fucking sociopaths. Us rural drivers are left out even further to dry. There was a huge flood last week and they only offered to pay us 1 dollar extra ONE DOLLAR! In my small town sometimes I go an entire day without getting any orders! It's insanity!
Starting an orphanage?
F off with the "you have to tip" John, seriously WTF?! Those workers needs to get paid by the delivery company that took 40% of the restaurant's profits NOT THE CUSTOMER!!!!!! Amazon doesn't require me to tip them to deliver my packages! How could they afford to spend $180Million on bribes but not afford to pay the workers?!
The more tips you're giving the delivery person the less paid the corporation has to give them...
I still can't understand how all these apps that are based on delivering a thing to a place can't connect the user's location that is selected on a map to the exact coordinates that the deliverer sees. nah, bro, just send the delivery worker the address and hope he'll find the place. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?! Every single time I get delivery worker walking around trying to find me at different addresses, and I'm not the only one
A tip is not a tip. There would be no delivery people without these  "tips" because they wouldn't Even be able to afford their gas.
i need them to invite that guy who keeps shouting "WHAT?!!" back for every taping, every time i heard him i lol'd
they take 58% of the order leaving the restaurant with 42% and then they gotta pay tax on that. and ppl still say "land of the free" and that nordic countries are way to regulated and tax heavy. guess what regulations are sometimes made so that companies don't get to fuck you or your company.  sidenote: ppl complain that everything is expensive and yet fork out loads of cash every year to have their junk food delivered to their door. get out and walk over to the place, and by place i mean a propper grocery store and buy some ingreedients and go home and make your own food. yes housing prices are high these days but with that lifestyle you wouldn't aford it regardless. 3x price on an already expensive meal no thank you.
I almost never use delivery apps - with tips and fees a $5 burger turns into a $50 burger. Ok a bit of an exaggeration but I hope you get the point.
Today I opened my Uber, zomato , swiggy and gave ratings for all my previous rides and orders
Is there not an element here of people need to start paying more for these things. In the UK, for example, we pay less for food which is great because people are struggling financially, but it also means the people producing the food are struggling massively financially. The same goes for take out and so on. We're creating environments where being a small business or independent farm is impossible because overheads are tiny because consumers want everything cheaper. Which leads to people not being paid and/or treated well in their work.
As spaced out as a 9th grader’s essay trying to make the page limits 😹🤣
I dont like that these companies have come to NZ. Sure, we now have access to food that didnt used to have delivery options before now, and restsurants will even do delivery, but it has also brough in tipping culture. The same with Uber, which i think is the only one of those apps we have, i might be wrong. We dont tip in NZ; cafes and bars may have a jar at the till and you can put money in them if you want, but none of it is obligatory - you dont feel like you absolutely have to, and that if you dont give enough you will then get a low rating. Customers never used to get rated! You just opened your door, took your food from the delivery person, and went back inside to eat it. Now even were getting rated. Oh my god its the black mirror episode but in reality.
Americans love the exploitation of their fello humans. It's called 'Capitalism' and is red in tooth and claw.
I’ve literally never used a food delivery app
Ive never used a delivery app. They're a huge rip off.
Thanks a ton John - you always get us to think about the consequences of our actions before we set out on them. I am one of those people who cannot survive without food deliveries, and so I do this every time, 100% of the time without fail: (1) give the delivery guy his tip in CASH** and (2) always rate the delivery guy 5 stars, Note: ** means I have to prepare a bunch of notes for tips, so I always have some at the ready - but I consider this a tiny price to pay to ensure the delivery guy is truly appreciated.
Right, or maybe they are hungry!!!
Yeah we have Netflix and Redbox to blame for our children never getting to experience Blockbuster and date night!! Thanks asses! Stop being lazy people.
Wtf
i cant tip i can pay those priced for take out so unfortunately i cannot help, i have to go to the grocery story for my meals but for those that have the money please tip!
I got one negative review because someone has claimed I didn't deliver their doordash order. I literally saw them come to the door and get it and later received a notification that I wouldn't be able to dash for a week. I went from making $800 a week to nothing just because someone wanted free food.
It's funny how the companies are not making money, but I dare you to go see how much management and CEO make a year... go see the salaries
Gee and who are most if not all of these apps owned by ? 🕎✡️🕎✡️ I really wonder if we could ever figure out if gods 🕎✡️🕎✡️ people own these?
I will never use a delivery app. Never have, never will.
Ah yes, capitalism at its best. Just wait til the robots show up. Then we're in for a real sh*t show.
human squidward I had to do a double take for that
The App creators don't buy the ingredients, cook the food or deliver it! They don't really do anything.....that is a microcosm of the greater world today. I work for a delivery company and everyone seems to be doing well, except us delivery people
I like the solution of calling the restaurant and asking them if they in house delivery service and if not then I'll just go to the restaurant.  I hate to cut people's side hustle but you're getting effed.  And I don't want to profit from that.    (I'm a disabled person and I will not be using uber eats)
I couldn’t figure out how to tip.
It’s true, service personnel do not get paid as they should be.  We don’t hear about the average American workers being paid an unacceptable low wage, then being tipped only if the employer is pleased with their work. Doesn’t sound fair to me.
I know of a coworker who said that while she called off work because of snow, she called out for food.  When I said did you him a extra big tip she said no he's lucky I paid him at all the guy was late and I had to walk down the road to the end of the block because it wasn't plowed . She thought that the delivery guy should walk through the snow to her house even though it was dark out and the house was hard to find .
Just when we thought Romnesia was bad enough! Now we have Trumpnesia that makes you forget how it was four years ago? Who keeps on cozying up to communists like Putin and Kim Jong Un and Victor Auburn? Dictators!!! He dare calls you a commie?  This must be an Acute case of Trumpnesia!!!!!!!!!!  Please use this in your show and make it stick!!!
A reminder to US voters this election season: Kamala Harris is proposing ending taxing of tips for tipped workers. Vote blue, vote locally and federally, and remind your friends and family to do the same!
For once I’m glad I can’t participate in these apps doing harm on communities. When I do have even financial ability to participate…I won’t. It’s not helping gig workers, it’s not helping restaurants or small business it’s profiting a person who created an app and learned how to exploit these ppl and places to fund their life. Stop middleman business.
Hey, a Bottom curated menu is universal access
This is why I absolutely refuse to use any of these apps. They rip off everyone
No, John, no! You aren't ruining this for me! Aaaaaaarrrrrgggghhhhh
"THIS IS AMERICA. " - Childish Gambino

I worked with an early employee of one of these services, he told me they went around at night putting their stickers restaurant windows while they were shut. It’s endemic in this industry.
$184m in lobbying.... also telling you to tip, rather than paying a living wage... sUber
Devil rocked it and won!
I have done this gig work when I'm between jobs. The work is actually very enjoyable, but the pay sucked and there was always the fear that you may not be able to pay your rent this month and there is always the possibility that if your metrics drop you could be deactivated.  I worked a lot for Walmart Spark, who kind of contract gig workers more. I had excellent metrics. Then one day they deactivated me. A clear reason was not given. So I couldn't defend myself. The appeal box that I had to complete to get my job back only had 500 characters so I could even describe why this was a mistake on their part.   I am a 67 year old female, single person and was left with no money at all.   I did manage to get a job as a cashier at Walmart and now finish at midnight every night, so now I have a small income but I have no social life either.  I am disgusted, frustrated and angry that Spark didn't contact me to find out what happened.  I've worked since I was 12 years old, with 55 years with a great work reputation and this is the first time I've ever been fired.  I'm pleased that I was able to find a job to help me.   I was however going to set up a business, which I will have to figure out how to do that in a situation having a normal job with irregular schedules.  Such is life.   I always seem to be happy wherever I work.  Thank you John Oliver for highlighting this.   Yes tip, tip, tip and always rate with 5 stars. If you don't you will not ever know what problems you are causing for your delivery worker.
Journalism + comedy = change🤔  Ppl love comedy & when it is joined with things that happen everyday,  can make a difference❤️❤️ If you drone on about things as politicians do… we all fall asleep!!!  Comedians can make it interesting, & we all notice when the hell they’re talking about!!❤️❤️🫣🫣🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Great song.
I’ve said for years the Devil won that duel, Jon’s hella based
Souless Ghost Boss.
president Obama introduced a  lot of deregulation and ushered in the gig economy which haas lead to all these independent contractor jobs
No. Just the fact that workers have to rely on the generosity of tips and consumers are societally pushed to pay for them is such a roundabout system. Eliminate tips, pay workers what they're worth, and have consumers pay what they're willing to pay, otherwise go out of business. Also relying on the generosity of companies to provide healthcare is such a stupid idea. The government should negotiate healthcare benefits directly with hospitals like every other developed nation and there should be a standardized amount charged for services. Healthcare should be independent from employment and come as a right of being a citizen. Coupling healthcare with employment is such a terrible idea cuz companies will try to cheat you out of your deserved benefit any way that they can
loose babies 😂😂😂
The Gig economy is absolutely horrifying the cost is way too high
Never used a food delivery app maybe I’m the only person but i don’t intend to ever use one
I remember that evil Prop 22. The companies put out commercials that crossed the line from sketchy to outrageous lies.  But the ads were effective and stupid Prop 22 passed. Not only does it deny workers basic rights and protections, they made it egregiously hard to overturn the law.  From the perspective of the delivery app companies, $184 million was a bargain: they can continue to screw over the delivery drivers in order to secure their profits.
Tip! Stop being an abhorrent pos. These companies have created a system where it's everyone for themselves and pitted customers against drivers, restaurants against drivers, customers against the apps. It's a literal warfare as doordash and uber rake in massive amounts of dollars. Stop using these PREDATORY services! Like John said, there's a REAL HUMAN COST and you AND these companies don't care about abusing it
Well, if everyone is rated 5 stars, the algorithms will use another measure to rank the delivery drivers. And what is it about "you have to tip"? I ordered that single slice of cake because that is what I can afford and I got fired from my job where no one tips me or pays for overtime or sick days. It is pathetic that there are no labor protection laws or minimum wage or job security, but yeah I am supposed to play nice. You know what? If I play nice, I will have to end up doing doordash deliveries. So, no thank you! Get the politicians do the things they are supposed to do in a democracy. USA is an oligarchy masquerading as democracy. And this country lectures others on democracy.
Starting an orphanage...  I would have never realized this had it not being mentioned here but I know a couple who ran an orphanage as a side hustle.🤣  The same couple's children are living on money which the orphans' families left them.
5 stars across the board❤❤❤
Thank you for the informative show. I really do miss at least a mentioning of the food packaging waste problem, though.
I have watched this happen though basically all of what my adult life has been. And I have felt this the most obvious thing happening right infront of us. Thank you John and the staff for pointing out how simply ludicrous situation
I used to live at 32/32 something lane, I got my meals maybe 30% of the time since the workers clearly aren't intelligent or they are foreign and they need help. Why can't those apps help them?
Reminder that a lot of restaurants still have a delivery guy and sell you stuff cheaper if you just call them and order without the leech app. At least in my city, I totally get around using those apps
Did anyone else hear that freaky one of laugh @21:32. I had to rewind to make sure I someone wasn’t in my house.
19:10 having worked as a rider myself, I think that the bottle of vodka along with microwave lasagna was kinda worse...
These app are useless and I stopped using them a long time ago. There are restaurant menu prices, then the app prices, plus big Chunk of services fees. And the restaurant owner end up getting about 48% of the restaurant menu price. Not the app hiked prices but the restaurant price. Then the driver or the delivery guys get cheated. They are just typical western capitalist. They are saying they are not profitable to avoid paying taxes. What are they suppose to say? They are making too much money. They are not profitable but still in business. Donkey shits.
Tips should not count as income. A tip is a tip is a tip. That doesn’t equate to part of your pay or shouldn’t dictate your base pay.
It's up to the government to clean up in it. Make it a LAW that they must be employed. Make a law about minimum pay, health insurance, etc. Than no need to tip or anything else. You pay for service/food the fair price and everyone gets a fair salary.
What happened at 21:18 with the audio???
OMG!!!!  I used to be an Asst. Manager at Blockbuster in Tulsa, OK in 1988-1991.  📼📼📼
I speak for Uber Eats, Tips make 60-80% of what I make. Just last night I accepted two offer each for a little more than 9 dollars, both for 18, and the tips from that was 15.5.  I deliver  in Chicago, all areas, and the average I make is 13 /hour, and tips is a big part of that. And no I do not feel Uber eats respects me and the only reason I keep doing it is that I have no other choice and to provide for my family.
Not talking about all the unregistered people who do delivery by renting out accounts eh
The three evils here - the exploitative delivery companies, the tipping culture that promotes the idea that it's OK to not pay workers a living wage, and the ridiculously expensive lemon that is the US healthcare system. Seriously, your government spends about the same amount on your healthcare system as does the UK, for a system that is significantly less accessible and more expensive to patients. But, hey, capitalism rocks, right?
They will just automate deliveries in a few years and that will be that.....
And here i was thinking i was the only one starting an orphanage as my side hustle  😁
I agree with all of it except tipping, can we please stop holding the customer responsible for the fair pay of employees? Then when I slip an extra ten dollars because you brought me a single slice of cake on my birthday after i just lost my job and my SO left me and my car got repossessed you would know it really meant something.
The money all goes to venture capitalists
They're gonna be profitable through drones.
This is why I never use these apps. I will only use resturants that employ their own drivers directly.
I actually see tipping is enabling these companies further. I will tip when we start tipping out USPS and FedEx workers.
9:34 How in the hell did Grub-hub manage "delivering food without our knowledge?" I mean that makes zero sense and must've been a one-off where someone 'stole' the food or something.
As a chef, just pick the food up yourself. You save money and actually support the business.
In that case tipping is a MUST!
lol I use skype everyday more than calling on my smart phone.
Imagine the coal miner or firefighter watching this video saying how dangerous being an app delivery guy is.... dont like it, dont do it
Improve global food delivery apps by educating customers to enter dish name into app search box instead of restaurant brand name. People want to eat the most delicious dish name X near them. Most people don’t care about the restaurant name. All restaurants listed on app should offer safe hot food.
3:01
these companies might not make money for their shareholders but they are making a lot of money for their senior employees
Another multi billion dollar a year business that can't pay a living wage. Even Musk kind of pays better.
literally sitting here eating food i got from grubhub and just deleted the app D:
There was restaurant that would use other fast food and then pawn that food off as theirs.
Bruh if they are getting paid they don't deserve tip unless they do something extra. Would u give tip to a retail worker to just do their job and just charge you.
Zwigatto is movie from India about the hardships faced by delivery people.
love that john oliver implied ms piggy tops kermit
Does anybody else have the thought that muumuu's or at LEAST the pronunciation is inherently cruel? It's kind of like serving Froot Loops in an insane asylum...
Check out the concept of enshittification. It’s happening with all big tech.
Anyone else notice that ads are starting to pop up on the channel?
I love the person who yelled "What?!" at the beggining
Im in UK and have actually never used one of these apps. Im old school, my 4 favourite takeaways do not deliver so i collect it myself, 2 takeaways a week
Reminds me of this bs trend of "do you want to round up?" No,  fk you.  I'm not going to help companies look better
TIP WORKERS IN CASH!!!
Never have used food delivery app and i never will.  Too costly for me to just go up there and get it my damn self.  Not to mention, the app companies hose over the restaurants and drivers.  Not gonna contribute to that shit.
I feel like a backpack joke was sorely missed. When you’ve got door dash at 7pm & death stranding at 8pm
Gig Orphanage!  😂
Ironically, I am watching this while ordering via the app Zomato in India.
John Oliver L for enforcing Tipping culture .
How about you just don't go for those jobs ey ?
Uber eats were HOUNDING me to sign our venue up to their service. They wanted 30% !! Seriously, I told them to shove it. We have a brick n mortar establishment, with staff, creativity, costs, talent, rent, etc etc…. They think that the last mile drop off is worth 30%?? Go get absolutely f%#%^ed.
Why not an episode on Israel's atrocities in Gaza and neighboring areas? I would like to hear your perspective on that conflict.
Do like I do when it comes to ordering food in The Netherlands:  1. Use those apps to find a restaurant that appeals to you. 2. Then google that restaurant so you can order from their own website and Ubereats etc don't get their ridiculously greedy commission.  A major fuck you to Ubereats and all similar apps/companies from me personally. Screw those greedy assholes.
I haven’t ordered a meal delivery since around 2010 from Domino’s
How are the US citizens not up in arms?
The biggest issue is the even people like AOC don’t care about tipped workers.
only if your society lives on TIPS 😂 lol most of the world dosent because it takes advantage of other ! yeah Demoracy 😂 come on children grow up hehehe😂
I would suggest to all you service workers in the USA to organize and fight to stop with the whole tipping system. Its so much easier to just have a decent salary
Vis a vis the tipping culture in the USA. First of all, it looks like you Mr Oliver have been sucked into the same scam as the general populace where employers are telling customers that the customer is directly responsible for the employees wages. In addition, I have seen a few stories where the employer is taking a cut of the tip.  As for delivery people, don't tip on the app, tip the delivery guy that appears at your door. If I tip, it is always cash, even if the bill is paid by some other means.
So it is different in Australia.  Delivery app's result in a higher charge for food, 10 - 15% mark up. Then, because you can only pay online, cash is not an option but the admin fee for use of a debit/credit card is. There is then an Admin fee for taking the order and a delivery fee for actual delivery. So you can expect an online order to be up to 40% higher than if you ring an order through and pick the product up yourself.  Further, that cost can be 140% higher given all of those fees but after the order is confirmed they don't deliver and charge your account 3 days later so you don't pick it up until your next statement of account from your banking app. Thanks for that DOOR DASH. By the way they refused to credit my card, told me they had credited my account, and refused to cite the name on it when I pointed out I don't have an account with them.  So now, it's a phone order to the establishment and drive round to pick up. Anyone who does not take a direct call has been cut off our list because there are those that do.
John Oliver high is exactly what i needed today
This isn’t all of it, I ordered the food based on the price on the restaurant menu but when it arrived and I had to pay it was almost doubled the price , first I thought I made a mistake but then I learned it happens because I ordered via app so I stopped ordering Gaia app but the problem is almost all restaurants are on an app. I’m not sure but I think they even have a cut on the tips, so I’m glad that I paid the tip to the delivery person . But the joy of delivering food is gone😢
tipping someone who hands you a muffin is completely fucked up. yet some servers expect even that!
Why would you use an app when the restaurant itself does delivery?
Sorry but I am calling bullshit on the whole we don't make money they can take up to 40% of profits from restaurants and don't pay the delivery drivers much if at all they have to do is basically host the app and have like a 100+ million to fight workers rights
Had a deliveroo rider drive over my lawn and caused damage to it.  Phoned up deliveroo and nothing was done. They are independent workers meaning deliveroo not liable. They refused to give worker information as well.
Why can't people just cook their own food? Cheaper and healthier. 😂
All this makes me think about what is the real objective of human society's evolution.  I am not sure, but if it is an inhumane social and economic system, then I may not be sure you can count me in the project.
No one should have to tip. Companies should pay their staff a proper living wage in the first place. 🤷
13:15 That guy is worth 1.7 BILLION dollars. As in 1.700.000.000 USD. Meanwhile, an injured dude has to cycle around as a delivery guy to pay the pills. Humanity is disgusting.
What I do now is use the food apps to find a local restaurant i like the look of, then search for that restaurant and order from their website directly. It's always cheaper and the restaurant gets all the profit... And no-one should have to tip. Companies should pay their staff a proper living wage in the first place. 🤷
Millennials are most certainly not getting any subsidies here.  Most delivery workers are millennials to begin with, so they are getting screwed over the most.  After people finally realize these are shit business ideas and will never make the kind of money promised, millennials and future generations will be holding the bag when these companies implode.  Also, a whole generation of population would have gotten used to the "convenience" of food delivery, which is terrible in so many ways in the first place.
Mulțumesc pentru video! 🇷🇴
I've never used one of these apps. During the pandemic, we cooked food ourselves, or ordered from a few local restaurants with a phone and picked it up myself. Why would I ask a stranger to risk COVID doing something I could do myself?
It's tragic when you hear tales of Delivery and cab personnel penalized for accidents, not caused by them, being late over a minute,delivering an order snafued by the kitchen, or worse actually being assaulted by road rage, angry customers and or managers! Sans any breaks for mealtimes!
Wait - you get $10 out of $25 for handling information, no good, no physical services, and you're losing money?  Something literally isn't adding up here.
Man, when it got to the part where it talked about people getting delivery while stoned because they wanna be responsible, I began to suspect was using AI to speak to me right this moment. Then I realized this was posted two months ago and I'm just stoned. We all good.
My grandpa taught me that you tip for the service if it was exceptional. Personally I don't tip a.nywhere besides restaurants and diners (drivers too). I don't know anymore,  i had a driver ask for my change after I ordered the pizza, its about service that was professional and respectful. 😂
Yeah, well these delivery companies will eventually go the same way as Blockbuster, the difference is they won't be missed.
Why do John Oliver's hands look photoshopped. They don't match the size of his head. It's like they are using someone else's body with his dome superimposed 😂
JUST EAT IS CALLED GRUBHUB!?!?!!?!
Nobody should be too busy they can't feed themselves, this is the very example of private companies "solving" a problem they made themselves
Food delivery apps need to be banned. They're gig work bullshit that's actively raising prices by forcing small businesses to pay thousands to get on apps that then take a 40% commission, ask for a giant tip, all despite it costing nothing to run the app compared to the money they make.
That cyclist delivery driver can also choose to wear a fuckin helmet lol
The bottom friendly menu is WILD. Queer people can smell pandering, don't try us Postmates
I have never used a food app
I still use the leaflet in the drawer method. It's faster to place an order, and I know my money goes to the actual restaurant.
Got a voucher for uber eats got the food delivered cold so went back to going back to eating at the restaurant.
another episode should be about tipping, because that's where I see a crooked world
The first time I heard about delivery services (on Dragon's Den, I think) it just sounded to me like a legalised protection racket. Never used them, never will.
One time out of sheer curiosity I went to McDonalds on Door Dash. The price of ONE McChicken on the app is 4$. Now admittedly I haven't set foot in a McDonalds for several years, but those were always a dollar in person.
I always recommend checking the app to see what you want  and then call the place directly. never yet ordered from an app
Nah some of the drivers on these apps should be taken off, makes the good drivers look bad.
Im not sure if this is what john wanted but ive just ordered a just eat hope this helps
My partner and I are both physically disabled so food delivery is sometimes the only option for us cause it's not safe for us to cook
Is Grubhub Justeat in the UK? Guessing from the slogan but either way this has made me re-evaluate my takeouts
Super surprised in s11e16 that John did nothing for the poor lady who had to stop taking her medications and sold her TV and couldn't get a wheelchair.  For all the money John has wasted in pursuit of funny, this seemed a no brainer in terms of compassion.  Disappointed.
I just call my local restaurants and ask them if i can collect if they don't have a delivery person around... Restaurant gets 100% then
I freaking hate delivery apps. They're 2-3 times as expensive as going and getting the damn food yourself.
The most unconscionable thing anyone can do is leave nothing for a tip. Yes, we understand you're paying a premium to these companies. Personally, I've never even considered using the platform for which I've made nearly 10k deliveries, simply because I'm unwilling to pay their exorbitant fees. But remember, Mr/Miss consumer- YOU have made a conscious choice to use one of these services, therefore you must be aware that those fees do not go to your driver. The person who is using his/her own gas, and putting miles on their vehicle in order to bring you that $32 Combo meal that you absolutely couldn't live without.  You wouldn't stiff the wait staff at your local restaurant if you went out to eat, so what makes the individuals going much farther out of their way for you mean so little that you can't do right by them by leaving a reasonable tip? They're the ones you should be especially appreciative of! Yet, more and more people using Doordash, or Uber to order food or other goods for delivery are deciding to stiff the people doing all the work for them. To those individuals, I say this: you are truly awful human beings, and if you cannot afford to use these services, DONT USE THEM. Get off your asses and make a fucking sandwich, or go outside and use whatever mode of transportation available to you and go get it yourself! Like people had been doing for decades before anyone knew what a delivery app was. Tip these people are don't ask them to go out of their way using their own time and materials to serve you, you miserable clowns.
Another good thing to do would be getting rid of the practice of tipping and paying people decent money.
Laziness is addictive
I dunno if it's universal, but where I live Google Maps will often show you the preferred delivery option by any given restaurant. I always check that before going to the apps by default, since many of them will list the app they get the best deal from, or will have their own delivery service.
Don't tip the drivers if you're already paying for delivery. If they want a good salary then they need to petition to get laws in for them to get at least minimum wage.
Don’t be cheap AF !  If you got enough money to order  then you gotta tip . Definitely 👍  But tip cash always….  Don’t be cheap! Life’s expensive!  These people work hard for you  like  Tina Turner Dame it  Tip them , cash !  Have a blessed one  Ps and if the us economy gets the Krugerrand  treatment won’t have value anymore   Than what cha gonna do with your savings (I pray that doesn’t happen )  To all service workers and good people  Blessings and abundance
To quote Ricky Gervais and his joke about a sequel to Sophie's Choice: "Well, I suppose it's the other one then!" 💀🤦🏻‍♂️
Mafia margins 💀
Skype didnt fuck up. It was bought by microsoft and replaced with teams
Food apps for lazy asses
I live in a country where grocery and meal delivery is king and it's no surprise that the US would totally fcuk it up.
14:55 he can write off all of those expenses
People should not have to tip. These people should be properly employed. All us consumers are complicit to this system
I would like to say I personally know of several individuals who would fake being a particular restaurant if it was in grubhub. Inflate the prices. Then would phone in all the orders and deliver. Pocket the difference. It probably wasn’t grubhub in every case.
Anyone interested in investing in an orphanage?
Is GrubHub JustEat?
The only gripe I have about delivery apps is that some of them have failed to deliver my food & failed to contact me with any problems.  I no longer use them.
Remember, these are the restaurants that have refused to pay their own staff for decades, instead making them work for tips. They’re just pi55ed that someone else found a way to make money from them. Zero sympathy
I was under the impression corporate fast was saved by the massive goverment subsidation under the guise of "necessity". The biggest positive of this model is they can push the liabilities off on the little guy they don't pay. Also, would you like to round up to the nearest dollar to off-set the corptate tax liability by claiming your charity as our corporate dontion.
I remember when Australia started forcing the delivery apps to meet our minimum wage and job protections. I have no idea if they went through with it but was a big new story a couple years ago and menulog (grubhub in Australia)  did agree to  meeting minimum wage for delivery drivers. So the cost of delivery is actually pretty expensive here
Saying that "the main winner so far is us, the costumers, [because...] we gain an incredibly convenient service and pay less than it is technically worth" at 21:40 makes no sense. Before the apps took over there were already restaurants doing delivery, in the US for tip and in some other countries for fixed fees or even with costs already included to the baseline price. Now the apps come along, pay the drivers less than before, take away a ton of money from the restaurants, mess up the whole price equilibrium making the food cost much more, and give discounts that are mostly paid by leeching the restaurants. Even the restaurant guy at 6:30 even says so, they took 58% of his sales, no way this is "less than it is technically worth", and much of the convenience was already there (many restaurants already delivered!)       Maybe very early on there was an advantage to costumers, now there are pretty much only big companies destroying restaurants and blowing money on lobby and who knows what (since they can take 58% of their restaurants and still barely make any money, for them or the delivery people )
Yes. Very unfair to delivery people who can’t do math. A win for everyone else.
It’s actually pretty funny that people can’t do the math. I’ve known several imbeciles who lost money delivering food, and they STILL don’t understand how it all went wrong.😹
F*** tip culture.
I just heard an Uber Eats radio commercial with the tag 'order anything, effortlessly' as I passed a cyclist struggling up a steep hill with a huge takeaway Uber Eats pack on his back, uneffortlessly
Are we winning? or developing metabolic syndrome?
Sorry everyone...I simply don't recognize the world that I grew up in.  A man in New York spent more on a bike than what most people could afford for a new Honda hatchback in 1980.  Cars that haven't shown any real innovation except that they are overengineered and full of power features and cost more than four-bedroom house back in the day.  People working harder and longer than ever, and they still can't save money or get ahead, let alone afford a home.  No one wants to shop or support the "little guy."  Advertising that plays on your laziness and calls it convenience, so they can make obscene profits.  This country is racing to the bottom.  Cheers!
What happened to Skype?  Microsoft happened.  Skype worked just fine, then they sold it to Microsoft and they had to mess with it and fuck it up!
I hate these delivery apps. I liked ordering from menus and getting to know the delivery drivers. Now its chaotic and weird and so expensive that I don't consider myself the 'winner' in this.
Maybe Uber/Grubhub/Dorrdash would make a profit if they paid their CEOs and shareholders less.
"You have to tip" that just sounds crazy to me.  As an Indian who works in private corporate job, whenever I do any work, I don't get any tip. If I'm late, I get a reduction in my payslip. If I work overtime, I don't get any extra money.  Then why should I pay an additional fee like tip for an amount I agreed for using food delivery service?
Cancel them.
Wtf wit bfm
This aged well.
I use grubhub because I work from home and can't leave to go get food on lunch break because that would take up my entire lunch time. I alway make sure to tip at least 30%.
20:00 truely the essence of the modern start up. Come in, undercut existing business, destroy an entire industry, fail to actually make money, profit?.
When assholes MUST "tip", I will also consider it. The "nice" tax can go fk itself :). Sounds like a congress problem imho, but a plurality of the country may elect Trump  again, soooo i guess that is democracy.
I noticed as soon as that NY law rolled out bc I reached out to customer service for tipping not being available several times before realizing I had to do it afterwards
In the US we’re bombarded with messages about how we’re so free but we’re slaves to corporate rule who've overtaken our government and we have no representation with so much of our job earned taxpayer dollars going to the privatized profits of born-rich plutocrat pricks of privilege
This is why we need to open the U.S boarders and allow anyone who wants to come in come in.
"Be Your Own Boss" is bogus. It's a way for those who DON'T do the work to get away with corporate malfeasance
Who asked for this. Not anyone that I know. Citizens didn't wake up one day and say "lets eat via an app. They developed it and shoved it on the world community and lined their pockets. Now the world community is physically more unhealthy. Thanks alot people who run the world! Now we don't have to move our bodies to go get nourishment.💙
I used door dash once.  Didn’t get half my food.  As I said I used them once, and only once.
Millennials are just another name for hippies.  Let’s hope they get it together one day.
Like John, I prefer The Devil Went Down To Jamaica, by the Disney Channel.
Yeah, pass more laws....That will help.
Whoever ran Skype during the pandemic needs to never be hired ever again.
The US is a slave state.
Civilised countries don’t tip. Workers are paid a proper wage!
I usually agree with a lot of what John has to say but this episode was pretty far off for me personally. I don't know how food delivery apps aren't making a profit they seem terribly overpriced to me. Tip culture in this country is terrible pay your employee i shouldn't have to pay them and you. The story about the cake while being valid that they should have tipped something in our tip culture is very misleading nobody forced the driver to pick an order that was so far away and not likely to have much tip to begin with the place the customer ordered from was not that far from there home as you can see by the person coming across the bridge going out of there way a little then back to the persons house. While i agree that its important to not leave negative reviews for something out of a drivers control if they did something wrong they earned the low stars and less customers. I am also of the unpopular opinion that this type of work is not really something that is set up well for being a full time job and if its what you have chosen to do as your primary source of income that is kind of on you when you don't have benefits maybe it will work if we ever get universal healthcare in this country which I strongly believe in but were not there yet.
He keeps talking about how it's super convenient for us the consumer, and how we're getting a good deal, and actually getting a service for less than it's worth. Uhhh what? In what universe? Ordering from these apps practically doubles the price in most cases. Like hey man, but uhhhhh $25 for a chipotle burrito isn't exactly what I'd call a good deal for the consumer.
Starting an orphanage 😂
No tipping
i''ve seen a lot of new places on food delivery apps that have no physical front, just some kitchen somewhere, which is dodgy as how do you check its legit and clean, pass food standards checks?
Never understand this concept of enforcing society to protect failing business. If there is a need for them and they provide good service at a reasonable price, they'll do fine, if not they aren't needed. And if the need arises again, enough new places will open. Simple as that. Most restaurants won't last for longer than 10 years anyways, so the owner should have planned that into his business plan and acted accordingly. Instead every business plan just contents fairly tale projections and numbers as fake as the orange mans hair and then everyone involved Pikachu-faces when the business goes belly up within the first two years, which statistically they will btw. Good restaurants did struggle during the pandemic but they made it, the one who had issues before were the ones struggling and usually the ones failing, and I don't see why you should save those. Just have a proper social system in place to ensure the people losing their jobs can maintain parts of their income until they find a new job instead of wasting money on failing businesses. Sadly this not only affects the US, even European politicians did the same mistake. We pumped 10 billion into a failing airline, with the underlying reason to make sure all those employees don't become unemployed. Do you know how much 10 billion is? Every employee could have received a severance cheque of about 100.000€, easily enough to provide for them during the pandemic, and after that business resumed so an existing or new company could have absorbed those employees.
Let’s talk about how the drivers steal the customers food just by driving to the address wait for a few seconds and drive off . Then you call to complain and it’s an automatic text stating food delivered bc they see on the app the driver was in the area. Happened to me to many times. I don’t order through these apps anymore.
About a year ago, I was near a wrap reastaurant I liked in the past, so I stopped by.  They were clearly closed, and for awhile, you could see that the fixtures had been stripped out, etc.  Guy walks up and asks if I knew the place, if they had moved or something.  Turns out he was a DoorDash driver.  They hadn't moved, they just closed.  I thought it was awesome that the company had literally failed to call in an order and not bothered to tell the driver.
It's true Zomato is taking 60% commission from the restaurants and additional delivery charges from us. The restaurants are now preferring an old call delivery system which gives them full margin.
“Spaced out like a 9th grader’s essay trying to meet the page limit…”. 😂😂😂😂😂
Current delivery apps suck for user as well they’re is no one to talk responsibility for the order getting their on time, being kept warm or half complete or incorrect orders or even issuing refunds everyone just blames everyone else it’s not worth it.
Bullshit!!  We always tip well, and still have horrible delivery service at times.   Fix the system.
What? The nice sounding Just Eat is in fact GrubHub😱
Fair Point 🤷
❤ #JonStewart #AOC 2024 Prez/VP🙏.. ➡️Felons🚫🗳️CANT VOTE shouldnt b allowed t run fr office they themselves cant vote in🗳️
😂 NEVER used one NEVER WILL!! Cook at home faster and cheaper than any delivery!
That's why I never order shit 😂
They do know they don't have to work for them right?. Am sick of people who whine as though they couldn't work anywhere else other than a grubhub etc. I have no sympathy for them no one's forcing the restaurants or the delivery people. I never tip ever especially if am asked so don't expect it. Do what everyone else did get a menu from ya favourite take out and use that or shut up and put up, it's called business and they offer a product no one is forcing them to work or use them end of story.
probably your best John, excellent.
There was a time where buisnesses that couldn't make a sustainable profit would go under, now they are second hand financed and choke one of the best things capitalism has going for it (competition). God bless monopolies/oligopolies.
Also this tipping culture is absured. So dumb - from showing gratitude to now being mandated is crazy. Out of control.
100% dont use delivery apps, actually I lie... I open up the delivery app find out whats around me, and then order directly with the restaurant and pick up the food myself. And for the person that ordered that cake, there's a special place in hell for those people.
When drivers think it's OK to leave my food outside on the ground when I live in a massive apt complex and I have to look for it best believe they get 1 star or I call and say they lost it if I can't find it before it's cold. I hope they do lose their job 😂
This show is so analytical and insightful  and presents it with humour. I hope it provokes change in the income levels and working conditions of the delivery people. Now that the public has been informed they have the power help with better tips.
I mean not having to hire 15 workers is probably better for that company than paying 40% for each order, especially when they can raise the price if need be. It's how the real world works, not the 1 where we blame capitalism for people being poor. If you don't partake in capitalism, you starve. It's not optional, it's reality.
That's why I tip in cash. I want to personally put the money in my delivery driver's hand.
The company doesn't make money when the CEO is cashing out to start the next thing. Don't worry someone is making tons of money! Look at Tesla...
My mouth has been on the floor for this entire episode.   Fun fact, I have worked for Foodora before the Pandemic and Door Dash after. Foodora was probably the best experience I could have hoped for until someone wanted to unionize.  I had no idea what Doordash was charging restaurants and let me tell you, if you have a V6 engine vehicle, you are better off taking Unemployment
Or perhaps America needs universal health insurance - rather than locking somebodies ability to have health care tied to their employment…
I will say that Postmates was the best of them, and when it got purchased it was a sad day
When I read the title of this video, I thought it said "Food Delivery Apes." No joke. Wouldn't that be something!
John was so close to discovering the truth here. That Zoom started the pandemic! Think about it, who had heard of Zoom before the dreaded cooties? All of sudden, every one is locked down and up pops this company out of nowhere to solve a problem that had already been solved years ago by Skype. Now every fucker is all about this upstart. Zoom has blood on their hands!
The food delivery apps instead of huge spends on lobbying/bs/marketing they should pay delivery drivers
Is this a new ep?
I won’t tip
That guy at @5:40 is talking complete nonsense. There is no way some place he'd have a job needs 15 guys at all times, unless means for something else. I predate those apps, if a place has a direct dial and it's own drivers, I'll stick with them. The apps are handy for sure, but knowing too much about how bad they are for the restaurant and the drivers, while taking an egregious cut, has made me almost completely stop using them.  The rare occasion that I will, is because after a few months of not using, they'll send me an offer like 8€ off, or 33% off order, so I just cave in and get something. I'm sure the place I'm ordering from is getting screwed, which is somewhat inconsiderate of me, but I do it about twice a year, not twice a week.
Can't help thinking that if they weren't spending so much money on lobbying and adverts they could be making money.
DoorDash has lowered pay for drivers regularly.  In my area we are down to $2 per order, but if there are 3 pickups from same restaurant, it's still only $2.  The typical delivery range is 6 miles each way, which can be roughly 5 minutes to get to the restaurant, 10 minutes waiting for the order, 15-20 minutes driving in each direction, and then climbing 3 flights of steps to leave the order and take a picture.  If you don't tip, we are not going to accept that order.  If it's 6 miles, we better see a minimum of $12 on that order.  It's our time and our gas.  If you don't want to pay $12, go get the order yourself.  Biggest laugh: we drivers never use delivery apps.
Food delivery apps are bad for the environment and bad for people. We should be expending a little bit of energy to get our food. Plus all the packaging, the gas burned to travel...it's not great. I don't use them.
Pumping out a unit ? Sharing ?
Tipping is at least 35% of my pay with DoorDash. There is absolutely no way I could deliver without those tips. As it is, I am actually paying for some customers to get their food because I make less than it costs me to deliver their food.  I rarely decline orders. I call the low pay orders (less than $5 for 20 minutes of work) my pro-bono orders. I keep them because of the app algorithms and it works because I do make more than the average for my area.  Also, my star rating is pretty good, but I got a 1 star review that I absolutely didn’t deserve. More than 1,000 orders later and it’s still there and DoorDash only rates you on your last 100 reviews. Low reviews are near impossible to get rid of. If your driver did their job, I encourage you to help them out by giving them a 5-star.
Just stole a collegehumour bit with that thing about skype lol
If you choose to eat at a restaurant or order from an app, you are participating in tip culture regardless if you tip or not. If you refuse to tip, you aren't sending a message to anyone other than the person you should have tipped.
Im confused now, are we supposed to use  delivery apps or not?
Convenience costs money. I could as easily make myself a cheese burger with the works for $4 or I could call one of these delivery apps, after taxes, delivery fees, and tips, it comes to about $30 for the same cheese burger. I went to a restaurant that makes a cheese burger similar to what I make at home, I ate in the restaurant, no delivery and I did not tip, it came to $25. Convenience is expensive, I read somewhere that 30% of people do not know how to cook. What a world we created, humans spend most of the time coming up with ways to exploit each other, so sad. Where does this money come from, nobody is handing it out to me.
Went back and listened to Devil Went back to Georgia, like John told me to. Neither the devil or Johnny were that impressive.
you are wrong---i am unfollowing you now
Another small thing you can do is keep cash on hand for tipping. That way you know it goes directly in the pocket of the delivery person, without the app being given a chance to steal from them.
The whole point of Uber and its wannabes is to drive out local businesses and became a global monopoly.  All the wealth in the fewest hands. I have never used either the "taxi" or food delivery apps, because I refuse to participate in such exploitation to make some tech bro rich. They are the enemy.  Besides, I am a great cook and if we want to eat out we go to the restaurant. I realize a lot of people are really pressed for time, but cook meals that last for days (eg chilli, crock pot stuff). The more one cooks, the faster you get at it, and it's cheap.
You missed a big benefit of the old method of calling in takeout orders: discounts! Most restaurants used to give you a 10% discount on take out orders since you weren’t taking up space, creating dirty dishes, and using service staff!
Hungry? Make aglio e olio peperoncino. Sorted!
What a bizarre stance to take - we as the consumer have to subsidise an employee's wage and not honestly rate their service?
I think pretty soon all restaurants business will be taken by these delivery app and the restaurants owners will be same slave like these delivery guys .
I only order from places that have their own delivery drivers
Anybody heatd if tony eats in seattle washington 5 buxxx😅
Prior to these apps' existence, I never had any food delivered other than pizza.
As a doordash driver who has completed over eight thousand deliveries— as a side hustle — it has changed drastically. People rarely tip anymore — not even a dollar and now that doordash delivers SNAP/ebt we are hauling food to welfare recipients who cannot tip. I’m not against welfare. i’m against the fact that doordash is profiteering on it. drivers get screwed.  also 99% of those orders is garbage food like koolaid, chips, sugar pops etc.  at a premium price highly marked up. how is this ethical? i could go on and on // drivers are now being bought cars by cartels and kids are working 24/7. it’s not a joke. they pay a percentage to the cartels and there are many issues with how the drivers are being treated by the cartels in exchange for a cut of their labor. it’s no longer viable to be a driver as we are competing with a completely different frame work while get heavily taxed, no tips and screwed over. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN YOU REFUSE TO TIP AND THE MOST I GET IS TWO DOLLARS FOR TAKING YOUR CANDY FOURTEEN miles? i can’t.
Uber Eats doesnt make money? Well that sure sounds a whole lot like not my problem
Who says millenials can't enjoy Harry Potter anymore?
@KaylaF.-zs6gy 0 seconds ago "No Monkey Labor" has been labelled on a can of coconut milk that I purchased. Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude what is going in with monkeys and coconuts?!?!?!
I got booted from DD for a bad review from a child who was mad that I couldn’t deliver their order to their lunchroom inside their school. I dropped it off at the office but obviously the rest of the school would have been trespassing! They had plenty of signs and cops hanging around as security and even signs posting saying they don’t accept deliveries bc apparently it’s such a problem kids ordering all day.
Zoom took Skype's spot (and its money) and refused to give it back
Bravo John! Exceptional! 😂
Meanwhile in Germany Uber (eats) bought the now Uber Arena formerly known as Mecedes Benz Arena formerly known as o2 world at the East Side gallery in Berlin (:
Restaurants provide a good ambience which is not there at home.
I cant get over that they don't know why bottoms don't eat before le sexy time
Almost every delivery person ive encountered is a complete idiot. Most of them don't desrve 5 stars, muchless a tip.
I am just wondering, why don't some delivery guys (who can) get another job? A lot of comments already say that DD or UE is a real job but then they also cry about fluctuating wages and inconsistencies with income. When I say another job I mean, become a cashier, become a dishwasher, become a merchandiser at a super market...… A local Walmart is ALWAYS HIRING. On the weekends do UE or DD. You have constant income and don't rely on people's generosity for your livelihood. As a customer, I usually don't tip or tip 10% and there is a reason for that. I ordered from the app because there was some incentive for me, BOGO or 40% off or something, on top of that I pay service charge and other charges, often paying more money that the food would've costed otherwise. I simply don't have the money to tip. I am sorry.
I don't use delivery apps because I just go get what I want myself, and if I can't be bothered, then I find something at home to eat.
Nice one, but I did not like the ending. I expected them to pick up the idea of an orphanage again..
Lol, screw that DD exec
If the extra money it costs to spend $30 for a $7 meal went straight to the driver and the restaurant, then I would use the apps.  Its not worth it and unless I'm starving to death and completely bedridden, i will never use them again.
ya, I dont do delivery apps anymore because of the uncharge and tipping culture. shyt cost 3x more ordering though an app. Not about sheep shyt mentality.   And let's be honest, restaurants these days have been slipping in quality while that price keeps going up. truly lamo
Skype got rekt and Teams is broken. What is going on with Microsoft?
I quit using delivery apps. Its not saving anyone money. It charges you too many fees.
Never used these apps. How lazy AND stupid do you have to be to pay extra to have a random person bring you food from a fast food place right down the street? People who had kids, no license, disabilities, and got high didn’t starve before these apps.
Who uses DoorDash or grubhub anyway?
Luckily for me i am one of the side hustlers you mention in the beginning, and only have to slave away enough to cover the health insurance Germany is making the local branch of this company pay.  Everything you say about tips is true, especially in the summer in the blazing sun when we could faint for heat, the lazy bums think we are enjoying ourselves and i've had to cross town several times to make a  pickup for a person who doesn't tip because they live across the street from the restaurant and are completely oblivious that the slave handler is trying to keep us busy in the summer with long travel time if our contracts are valid in the winter when orders counts increase. (Rain is good tip weather.) Offices customers are the worse tippers, they seem to think they are entitled to the lowest investment possible, or rather that the tips are non deductible...  There are worse slavers here. German Wolt for example are not only subcontracting thus enabling salaries to get abducted, they're not even paying health insurance as required by most German employers.  i find it hard to believe these companies are not making profit, as they often roll the delivery cost onto the customers which in turn contributes to low tipping. The adverts they have here are also claiming that they pay us aprox. 25% more than they actually do. i hope the workers union will sort that out soon.
Thanks for the names, this will make the hunt more exciting
I have never been in favour to these delivery Apps. Restaurants should abandon the delivery App services.
Wow he spins the truth to create sensational stories. Babri Masjid site has a complex and long history. He shared half the story and demonized a religion that has a long history of tolerance.
I always enjoy interviews with corp execs who are so out of touch with reality. Also I find it hard to believe these delivery apps aren't profitable.
I'm not excited for this skyrocketing in gig jobs. There's a weird push for part-time, "choose your own hours :)" type jobs. There's especially more demand for travel labor, and as someone without a driver's license that makes the job market exceptionally narrow for me. People like me are currently being pushed out of the job market, and it makes me lay in bed thinking about the world. "Adapt or d13" still leaves a body count in it's wake.
Yeah I'm still not tipping
I tip in cash, i dont trust the app
The big Question is, whom are they loosing money to??? There are people who make a big living off of delivery services, they just don't work for them or maybe at the very top are getting big salaries.
As another software engineer I will also tell you that the tyranny of an algorithm will almost always be much worse than the tyranny of a human boss...
They arent delivery services.. its a service auction house...
0:40 ridiculous
In India we've been experiencing this for past 10 years, aaaand, it has made obesity worse.  Ppl are now going back to cooking own food and or occasionally eating out at restaurants.
Clap
The US is just one big f*ck you to the middle and low class and the worst part is most republicans are voting against their own interests, it's just unbelievable how unlawful, inhumane and fraudulent the system is. Big companies using every loophole they can.
It used to be only pizza and Chinese food.. not many places delivered food when I was younger
I think I'll just call the restaurant or go to their website going forward. It saves money for everyone involved...
There is no way in hell those apps are not making money. Especially considering the way they charge almost double what the restaurant charges and pay the delivery people chump change. Think about it they have almost zero overhead and no employees. If someone would figure out a way to consolidate some things they could make major money.
In Taiwan last decade, we have two major delivery companies Uber eats and Foodpanda, and this year they just emerged and the government approved it 😂 so Uber eats will monopoly the whole Taiwan market...
The American tipping culture is so weird to me. Why would I tip for a service I'm already paying for, just because a multi billion-dollar company can't pay a good living wage to its employees? You really need to unionize and fight for your rights.
Never used them, never will. Restaurants are caught with their pants down. The food is severely overpriced. The drivers make a pitance. The whole setup makes no sense. And John: tips are not taxes, they are not mandatory and should be an appreciation of services rendered. Except it is backwards and you have to pre-tip someone who is bringing something from point A to point B, the bare minimum required for the business transaction to occur in the first place. Makes 0 sense to tip.   Just don't get baked and do your own pick up.
This show went to shtown with all the affirmative action hires
In North America, the restaurant/food worker/customer relationship was always flawed at best; the addition of app middlemen didn't make it any better.
I’m glad that I actually work for a restaurant as a delivery driver. My customers know me, my boss knows me, everything works out. Been doing this job twelve years.
Holy shit what did happen to skype
The customer is definitely not getting value from this either. These delivery apps are double the price or getting it at the restaurants. A chickfila sandwich meal is less than 10 bucks if I get it myself and like 24 bucks if I get it on Uber Eats when it is less than 5 minutes away. Everyone loses.
I'm going to disagree with John on this one. Never tip, and leave bad reviews a lot (whenever they're warranted). This will help the workers quit, and if they quit, then this whole business model can't stand.  It is not the customer's job to pay the employee, it is the employer's. Tipping should never be required. The customers should not be subsidized to make up for the flaws of the employer. We should be holding the employers accountable and responsible, not the customers.  That said, the advice of contacting the restaurant and asking them *their* preferred way for you to order delivery, is spot on.
Tipping doesn't "incentivize" paying lower wages, that's ridiculous. Capitalism itself incentivizes keeping labor costs at a minimum. No boss who actually wanted to pay higher wages ever refrained from doing so because their workers were being tipped. What tipping does is provide an excuse to exploitative bosses for doing what they're already doing.   If you want to do away with tipping in favor of paying a decent wage, I'm with you, but if you don't tip now as some kind of "protest", you're exploiting workers as much as bosses are. Also, you're not fooling anyone that you're on the side of workers, you're just stingy and selfish.
Who do you think is keeping delivery apps in business. People who watch HBO
This is a test comment. UT plz dont remove it.
But, where is Ifood in this equasion
It's pretty crazy to make billions in revenue and not being profitable.  Did they spend $5 billion developing their app?  Nope.  Just throwing money at ads, lobbying, and acquisitions.
It's incomprehensible to me that these apps can charge restaurants so much, pay drivers so little, and _still_ seemingly make no money. Sure, it takes _some_ amount of money to build and maintain an app and back-end services, but somehow back in the "pizza place pays a few kids to deliver each night" days, restaurants somehow did so profitably without it really costing the consumer much more.
Woke comedy, great right?
I am so outraged the restraunts that are overcharging, reducing portions and providing terrible service are being victimized by this fully voluntary situation. All good will gained by them during the pandemic is 100% exhausted.
meu deus do céu... os americanos precisam de previdência social, a pessoa em recuperação com as pernas arrebentadas sem licença? credo.
corretion, bottons eat
I have dramatically lessened my usage of these apps bc the fees (Seattle), most of the time, are more then the order. I have embraced grocery delivery though and choose to cook. It's easier, cheaper, and very helpful not having to put extra strain on my injury
No Tips
They take such a huge cut that many have to increase prices. They take a huge cut: 30%+ from restaurants sales (make restaurant pay a premium to have their names be relevant on their platform) + 10% from you as service fee + flat fees + a cut from the delivery drivers as well.  Order by calling or use the restaurants websites.
Got a food delivery app add right before this video. Excellent
I hate that the culture in the U.S. is that consumers, not businesses are responsible for making sure people who work for the businesses they patronize earn a decent wage.
LOVE THIS
How do we request a topic? Can you do one on servers? We’re living with SUCH bad wage insecurity and SO many people don’t understand how little money we have sometimes and how much of our labor is stolen from us
Using one of these apps has just never even occurred to me. I have a freezer full of frozen dinners when I am not in the mood to cook.
I always tip, but never use food delivery because of all the waste that is included. I also prefer to cook - it is much healthier and cheaper. I truly feel sorry about the delivery people for the business case only works if you squeeze what’s possible. That is usually workforce. I rather save money by cooking and go to good restaurants with good service once in while. It is the To Go and Waste society that is ruining our planet :-(
Tipping culture is simply wrong: it is simply condoning below reasonable working pay cheques and health & safety coverages. Any society not providing for decent wages and universal health &  insurance for their citizens is simply not conforming to a its duties.
If Uber received a subsidy from the US gov't under the COVID ACT 2020 as a public transit sector, how is UberEats not under that same umbrella in the eyes of the tax law?
Didn't Domino's get sued for sending their delivery drivers on HIGH SPEED order runs that ended in drivers killing pedestrians or other drivers on the road during their "get your pizza in 30 minutes or less" campaign? So how do these 4 companies get away with it today....by having the drivers filed as 1099 workers?
I have never used a food delivery app, I don't even have the actual restaurant deliver, the only time I order food is when I actually go get it. It makes ordering food inconvenient, so I don't do it often, and it forces me to actually cook better for me meals.
AH yes make these guys 2.2billion dollars, driving all day to psychopaths (and I appreciate it uber eats!!!) and save up for my orphanage side hustle, cuz I like time more than money (you always should).
I used a delivery app once. I got a bowl of ramen and a side order of potstickers and the cost after all the fees taxes and tip? $37… that was 3 years ago and I’ve never used it since. Get your ass up and go pick up your food lmao
As both a former gig worker and current customer of grubhub, I was glad to have some form of income pre-pandemic when I lost my job due to discrimination by my former employer (who I legally can't specify). But the only reason I had to get a gig job despite having a degree and experience, is that I am disabled. I kept at it well into 2020, several months into my new job as a temp office worker. The apps and how people talk online pits customers against drivers in an us vs them fight. No, your drivers are not just eating your food and laughing. We've been sent to a fake restaurant, the wrong address, or you made the order and then fell asleep, or someone else stole your food.    I hope things are a little better for drivers now. Unfortunately, I have to rely on delivery for my groceries even more now, and it's one more reason I'm shamed for being disabled.   I feel that "single slice of cake" part hard, as I once had a delivery to make that was a single slice of pie. I was about ready to go home for the night and even though there was no tip, I accepted it, because I had to accept at least 85% of deliveries. If I went below that ratio, if say i passed on a huge order I couldn't physically fit in my tiny car, or another legit reason, I was removed from signing up for time blocks for the entire next week. If you don't sign up for a block, the only orders you got were ones rejected by literally all other drivers. So I go get the slice of pie from Baker's Square and I get to the address and get a text that I should have been more scared by "come in, the door is unlocked". Frankly, if I wasn't super depressed at the time and basically didn't care that I might have been walking into my own death, I would have left the pie at the outside front door and ran. I got lucky - it wasn't someone luring people to hurt them (which has happened to drivers) but someone who had recently become unable to walk and lived on the 3rd floor. She practically cried in relief because she kept seeing her order get cancelled and all she wanted was something to feel a little better after a very long day.  I never think the people ordering delivery are 'lazy'. That said, I wouldn't do it again. My health was permanently worsened, and I racked up a lot of costs from damage to my car. I barely made rent, despite doing my best to optimize everything and showing the utmost care by having my own cup holders and a cooler and heating pad in an insulated bag in the winter (couldn't afford to run the heat in my car, even below zero). I even chatted with people on reddit because I kept getting no orders and found out I had to commute to the busy parts of the city (which you can't claim on your taxes) and work there, then commute home (also not claimable - only from the restaurant to the customer). The taxes were annoying as hell due to the level of detail required to not get stomped on by the IRS, and I only avoided an audit by using qb self-employed, which was expensive.
That guy at 7:00 he paid $3.5k for promotions, so that was a good chunk right there.
Millennial lifestyle subsidy. Beauty, eh? It’s like the boomer cost externality subsidy.
Starting an orphanage? Ignorant tech bro.
Saw 2 large pizzas delivered that appeared to be carried like suitcases by door dash driver. There is no accountability for these freelance gig economy workers who are exploited.
Human squidward
1:33 This guy is a hero and a man of the people
people tip very shitty on delivery orders!  there's no way id order food even a few blocks away & not tip at least $5.   im not picking up your order for $4 for 7 miles!   we have to wait in line or shop for you you need to pay for our time & gas.  we have to eat too. delivery is a luxury.
This whole segment is a joke. Restaurants are not held at gunpoint to make an order.
I just watched Sophia 's Choice for the first time about two weeks ago 😁😄🤣👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
USA and their toxic tipping culture.
I don't tip, I am from Denmark and I have no desire support the btoken system
Top-tier capitalism 👍
Never used a delivery app once, don’t plan on it. I’d rather go hungry.
I was home sick and ended up paying $25 for an $8 sub to be delivered (badly) after 90 minutes. I haven`t used one since.
I'm normally fine with this show's takes, but there are some things wrong in this one.  1. Tipping should never, ever be mandatory or made to be felt like it should be. Pay proper wages, period. Or if the math does not work out for you as a delivery driver when it comes to base wages without tips, please do something else more economically viable for yourself or petition your local congressman to get establishments to pay proper wages.  2. I shouldn't be forced to rate someone 4 to 5 stars for a botched delivery. Late deliveries are fine, traffic happens, but when the food has been haphazardly loaded into the bag and now the carton is broken and food is spilling all over, best believe I will have my say there since I am paying not just for the food, but also the delivery service.  3. Making it look like buying your own equipment is bad is definitely a red herring. I used to do freelance work, and I never expected all clients who hire me to keep providing me with equipment I need to do the job. That's just part of the upfront costs of being self-employed.  4. Gig work is optional. All due respect and mad props to the guy who kept doing deliveries with a broken foot, but it's highly disingenuous and manipulative to position him as being forced by delivery apps to keep working. He was not, he chose to keep working with a bum foot. He has always had agency as a gig worker, but the show tries to make it seem like he doesn't. There's also the implied, but not proven, idea that app algorithms include time off in deciding if a gig worker should be booted or not. It was never proven to be as such, but the heavy lean by the writing to seem like medical time-off does factor in is highly suspect, and again, disingenuous.  There seems to be a huge misunderstanding by this show's writers what gig work is. It's not supposed to be a regular day job - at best, it's something one should be doing as a side hustle. If you have the gumption to string together multiple gigs (in this case, deliveries) and make enough money to make it your day job, more power to you, but it doesn't mean that doing app-based deliveries IS a day job and should be treated as such complete with the usual expectations we have for what day jobs are and should have. It's temp work, that's it.
Out the blue middleman “not making money “ bro you expect me to believe this? They spend so much money to spread and competing and run the bs business that yeah this like that one guy knows a drug dealer  who doesn’t even have access to plug 😂but he “knows” people(customers or who sellin😅 so he out here running around with you middle man’ing basically the set parties while trying see he can make money off top from it all.
My dad and uncles and heck all majority of in community were cab drivers or saving to get the cab & license: then Uber and bs middleman “businesses” APPS come. They of course won full support and legal rights “in court” when cabbies tried to fight it….then you can imagine the effects in similar fashion in this video
Seeing young people or older retirement age people work doordash and grubhub, my heart always goes out to them. I always tips extra bc that's someones mom or dad, or someone's son or daughter working hard for money :(
I'm sorry no matter what you say you cannot convince me to tip and cover for greedy companies
I'm so confused. Why aren't the astronomical service fees and/or the DELIVERY FEES going to, I dunno...the DRIVER? I tip, but never much, cuz my orders are always nearly DOUBLE the cost of the actual food, dealing with these expensive (and MULTIPLE) fees & taxes, on top of the tip. I've never spent so much on McDonalds in my life! I certainly can't afford to buy a car to drive there myself.
Propaganda
He said trigger to people under 30… yeah. I’m ashamed to say I realllllllly don’t like phonecalls. I know my favourite Chinese restaurant still has their own delivery folks, but i cannot muster up the inclination to make the call. My dad usually does pick up (they give you a discount for cash pickup) but he had the car & I wanted their spring rolls. $50 bloody dollars later… it’s a mess and knowing it’s not just $5 to the app but such a larger percentage, I’m going to swallow my pride next time. We’ve been supporting this local joint since I was a kid & I want to see it survive into the next generation.
USA should also abolish lobbying by companies, it should be individuals only and no money involved. Having lobbyists paying moneyto politicians is just bribery, even if that money is used as advertising for or against them .. one of the politicians profits from the lobbying
USA needs to get rid of tipping .. it is institutionalised begging. Businesses need to pay real wages and only then USA society will change for the better
I would get 2.1% tips on Lyft driving
That’s why u need to tip your Lyft driver you cheap humans. Lyft takes like 70%
Thank god for the bottom friendly menu 🥰
Get off your arse and pick up yourself, you're 100% the problem.
I am always riveted to these videos, but come away a little shocked about the atrocities I have no knowledge of.  Thank God I have never used these apps.  I am old fashioned and simply call the restaurant and then go pick it up.  The Asian restaurants have a 10% discount for paying cash, and a tip is not expected.  No wonder they are always happy to see me.  No Door Dash pound of flesh.
Total bullshit saying that these companies don’t make money, absolute liars, including John Oliver
I got into a car accident trying to rush a door dash delivery when the 3 drinks they ordered spilled all over me. I was trying to rush. I had to drive 3 towns over and didn’t even get a tip. Door Dash is a terrible app for drivers. They pay you nothing and it takes more gas money to get where you are going than what you are getting paid a lot of times. If enough of us protest it or stop doing orders for even a week then they would be forced to higher the pay.
Dude couldn't make it 60 seconds before dunking on religion.
Not gonna pass up this opportunity to shill for Brennan Lee Mulligan's Skype CEO sketch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI0w_pwZY3E
3:38 anaclecticc ???
I used to be an uber driver. The tips were the ONLY money I made.
I'm a month late, nobody will see this comment, and nobody will care either...and yet, here I go: What I wanna say is that that financial guy Jim Kramer is obviously deranged.
I can't believe they didn't cover tit baiting. That's like a major major part of why food delivery can't sustain workers. I'm an Uber driver and I tried to do food delivery and I made less than minimum wage before expenses
John Oliver loves Thai food
I've never got food from UberEats, etc - I only use the restaurants direct delivery services. Once I heard how the delivery services abuse the restaurants...easy call. (I'm a former Uber & Lyft driver, so I know what it's like to be an "Uber partner" - ie, a driver who got little money to drive during crappy hours and abuse my car)
First time I don't agree with your recommendation. Why is it my responsibility to compensate extra for a bad business model. If food delivery people are underpaid they should just find another job. It shouldnt be up to me to tip more it should be up to the business to pay them more and if they don't the workers should move on. No one is forcing food delivery app people to work for this company and they should go work for something else if if they aren't being paired fairly.
If I'm getting a Slice of cake, I'm paying for the Packaging, Platform Fee, Delivery Fee, Surge Fee, Distance Fee, and not to include Tax.  Do not guilt trip me for not Tipping me by adding gasping sound into the footage of bandwagon bias. Ask the Million dollar Corporations to pay more.

Holy shit, Big Money at 00:10 😂
Why is he preaching more tipping? Shouldnt be focusing on better wage pay?
Tipping ONLY your table's server, especially in a restaurant, is so messed up.   Did your server prep your foods? Did they take the time to make sure the food was all cooked perfectly? Most likely, No! A restaurant runs something like a Team. There is no "I" in Team!  From the time you or you are seated, the server has a few key-things to do: take your order, bring drinks, make sure everything is great, bring the bill, & clean the table afterwards.  What about the entire kitchen staff [prep-workers, chef(s), washers, etc.]?  Everyone working that particular shift should receive an even portion of the "gross tips." Always! But in many cases don't.   The point of "Tip Culture" in promoting owners to pay less in wages in many States or Provinces with minimum wage laws enforced, is not entirely based on facts.  If the owner is cheap, they will run their business/restaurant that way, & vice versa. One of the main culprits of paying just the minimum/liveable wage at restaurants is how much of a steady increase the "wholesale produce/products" costs are. In many cases, this percentage far exceeds the inflationary rate.  Lastly, "Guilt Tipping" & or "Gratuity Fees," especially at places where no one has really gone out of their way to assist your entire dining or service experience, is sad to say the least.
This reminds me of the pizza delivery missions from GTA San Andreas.
7:41 those numbers are especially infuriating since the more the app keeps, the more expensive it is to use in fees in my experience... I only order through UberEats/Postmates because they're the cheapest and I NEVER order from DoorDash because it's always WAY MORE expensive to use... So they charge US more AND take more from the restaurant as their cut 😡
I'm trying to go to out more. I only get order in if I'm not feeling well or if I can't get the bus.
I still call the restaurant to order for pickup/delivery bc I found out years ago it's usually $1 cheaper per each item ordered so I have stuck to doing that unless my work is paying it for it then I give the biggest tip available
I love it. That’s a fantastic idea. Let’s give all the gay parts to gay people, but let’s also give all the straight parts to straight people.  That is perfectly reasonable. I mean after all, there’s no way that a gay person can act straight and it would be straight facing  or straight washing if you will
I remember the first time I used a delivery app. I looked at the price, and it became the last time I'd use a delivery app
I’ve actually never used a delivery app bc I refuse to pay the fees but this really reaffirms it. During the pandemic we got a LOT of takeout if the hopes that our favorite restaurants would stay open but we always picked it up.
The crowd sounds like a laugh track. Anyone else pick up on that?
_We should tip even more_  Why not make sure *everyone* involved gets a fair income *and* tip fairly? Relying on tips as part of the salary should not be allowed... IMHO.
They are scams! And get money out of people who work hard in the kitchen.
I worked for a corporate office for a franchise. I can confirm they would add the restaurant without knowledge of the restaurants and advertise menus that were not updated or accurate. It was such a shady process that made the restaurant look implicit for their discrepancies.
I work for Spark. Which is the Walmart delivery app. You are not kidding that it can be dangerous. A few days ago while I was unloading my trunk for the family I was delivering groceries to their young dog gets out of the house runs across the street and is run over by a car.
14:10  maybe if a guy in NY knew the language he'd be able to have a W2 job.
California prop 22 was one of THE WORST props ever passed. It was basically a carve out for app workers to classify them as “independent contractors” no matter how long or hard they work for the company (so they wouldn’t have to pay benefits or insurance). Delivery companies and other gig companies are treating their workers like shit and getting away from it because they sold it to the consumers as being “good for workers!” These apps are pushing legislation that legally allows them to be slave drivers just so some tech bro can make a quick buck
Every corporation is a leach sucking the earnings of the laborer.
Yeah, we should support restaurants and airlines in Pandemic. But once things return to normal, we need a reservation 30 days prior, have to tip minimum 35% and if our baggage is overweight by 1/2 pound then we have to pay $500 extra.
1:28 land of the free but you don't have the freedom to eat if you can't afford a car, if you don't have a license for whatever reason. That's just sad. Also the way how most US citizens tend to think this is OK and normal, going as far as saying "yea in murica we don't need public transport cause we are rich and can afford cars". They don't even realize how twisted it is
well I dont tip dasher & co, I dont care if the delivery cold or broken, why should I tip them. Tipping is for good service and in the past people worked their ass off to get a tip. Today, they expecting tips for just give you a coffee over the counter, sometime I think these service guys are sick and arrogant. I dont care, you want tip then give me outstanding service and as every other dude in every other industry does. I hate the stupid mandetory tip shit that you get sometime if you have party or whatever. So sick nowadays.
*Trigonometry* I know people. I know how they really are. I know my place with them. Believe me. It’s better this way.
Sounds like restaurants could set up a collective delivery app with shared drivers and undercut the "business model" apps.
Wow Vanity smurf is really climbing up the social latter huh? Im proud :'l
Johnny was clearly the better fiddler. The devil was trying to play the banjo…
REALLY REFRESHING TO SEE THAT "BONE" DRUG UP 👌 😋
The tipping culture in this country is so antiquated with restaurants.  I think people forget why it exists in the first place...  It was an excuse to pay free slaves less than minimum wage once slavery was abolished and black people were looking for work in the food industry since they were qualified for that type of work.
It took some restaurants some time to adjust, but the prices on the apps are usually higher than if you order directly from the store to make up for the % of commission taken from the delivery app.
the left complaining about a problem they created, go figure.
“Millennials getting some sort of subsidy in life, after all this is a group who will never be able to afford a house, is drowning in student debt, and can’t even enjoy Harry Potter any more”…John Oliver always sums it up in the most important, and the truest statements possible.
Tipping implies you have 'extra' money to give away. I have never used any of these apps. I order directly through the restaurant's site and go pick it up.
“gay parts should go to gay actors”? Wtf? In that case let a stereotypical gay man take your job as an entertainer, just like a stereotype, and take your stereotypical English ass to Africa to steal some art like a stereotype. How progressive.
The actual winners are the people that want data to analyze later. All of these apps are data mines.
Such a late stage of f****** capitalism that even John Oliver's calling these corporations parasitic and Fox News is suggesting communist f****** talking points
What's hilarious is youtube gave me a food delivery app commerical before this video
😢😢😢😢😢
A delivery guy got stabbed randomly near my apartment while riding his bike. He finished the order before the ambulance came…..  We used to keep bike lights we got in bulk off amazon to make sure these kids were at least visible as they zip around trying to make enough to pay tuition as most in our city are foreign university students.   Some restaurants are popping up with their own sites slowly, or even a phone line.   All I can say is tip the restaurant, tip the delivery.  If this product is of value of you, if it helps you when you’re sick, busy with hustles and needing to feed kids, or frankly yourself after a 16 hour work day, show that.    Remember there is a chain of custody, and pressure is high before you write a scathing review.
I will never use a food delivery again because the delivery person had my food in her car for over two hours while she hustled around town getting other orders.
I can´t believe John Oliver just made go listen to Devil Goes down to georgia
Karl Marx is still right. Consolidation (greed) for monopolizing a market will screw the workers (serfs).
F it. what the hell is a "Bottom" menu? Is anyone else curious?  Like do they just get a$$ or what? lol
This is phase one…..They’re getting people hooked on the lifestyle…… Phase two will fix the no profit problem.
These companies may not be making a profit but I bet their CEOs are making plenty.
Brilliant as usual. Why is it that we need to go to a cable humor show to get this kind of analysis? Oh right, were in the U.S. of A. Exploit or be exploited.
I used door dash 1 time to have a bowl of soup delivered to my husband while he was in the hospital. I had very explicit instructions on how to get to his room to hand it to him personally. He dropped it at the front desk and it took three hours to get the bowl of soup to my husband. I will never use them again.
I delivered for Uber Eats. It was my livelihood for about a year when I needed it the most. Normalizing "you better tip no matter what" is a terrible sentiment. Customers are paying for a service, a service that has a fee. They should not also be subsidizing wages. America being in this mess where every business gets wage subsidies through tips is exactly because of normalizing this idiocy.   When it becomes blatantly unsustainable, such as when tips drop off drivers will leave. Uber brings up their wages whenever this happens. The more you subsidize wages the more ubers pay crashes. I've seen it time and time again.
Ok 👌 your dumb if you use these apps
There's this new thing they got called COOKING
This right here is an absolute episode of Black Mirror.
excellent.  never fails to impress me by its reporting.
They are dropping like crazy in CA after they increased the minimum wage. Delivery Drivers are making less now lol.
I never tip
human Squidward. lol
Uber eats dont make any money. They charge their driver almost 10 bucks every month just to work for them
Ive always thought the devil won, and now i am ascended
I never have used one of those services.. I refuse to pay that much more for food that I can just call the place, make the order, and pick it up myself
Omg the reference to the Devil when down to Georgia Is  the reason que te quiero te amo te adoro your the best till this day you have it every point I care about thank you you are just great      Mr Oliver you are the Estes 🖤
I'm in an apartment full of section 8's. They get it daily.🤮🤮 I no longer patronize restaurants that don't answer their own phone, either. If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to eat out.
Instacart treats drivers like shit too
We don’t even have orphanages in the US anymore. And as an independent contractor fed, state and local take almost 50% of your pay
The weakest people order food delivery and can't cook. Their toast if something happens.
here in Singapore , loan sharks will make lots of these orders with the cash on delivery options to you if you owe them money , as a form of harrasment and that delivery bag? thats like $27 dollars in Asia
Very very few people deliver on bikes outside of New York City.
The law of supply and demand dictates that if the restaurants aren't making out being on the platforms then they would get off them. Stop crying tears for restaurants losing money
Companies claim they’re not making money. The drivers aren’t making money and it’s not a great deal for consumers either.   The apps make a big stink about “Free Delivery” while the food is marked up above dine-in prices and the “service” fees are hidden with the taxes.   Why is it $30 for a $17 meal with free delivery?
Caligula couldn‘t do this show but John Oliver would make Incitatus a Consul
Caligula couldn‘t do this show but John Oliver would make Incitatus a Consul
Great show, I wish John had mentionned the desastrous amount of garbages the take out industry generates as this needs to evolve as well.
Ok.  The idea that "lobbying costs" are part of the cost of everyday business needs to end immediately.  The cost of bribing our government officials to pass legislation that is beneficial to the business's corporate agenda is a personal cost that the business owners take on.  The average American doesn't get the privilege of lobbying their elected officials as part of their everyday expenses, and it should not be considered as such for corporations.  Take that out of the equation, and these food delivery apps make money hand over fist.  I mean, how insulting is that?!?  "We get to count the cost of buying off the politicians that are supposed to represent and protect you against blood-sucking leaches like us toward our everyday business expenses."  Does anyone want to claim that America is a democracy still?!?
I never use those companies I phone directly to the restaurant and always pick up my food
How about you use the 184 Million in order to pay your workers a dignified salary?
It's only when he brought it up again at the end, that I realized by looking closely at his eyes, he isn't lying :)
The show clearly shows signs of getting tired. Most of the jokes are repetitions of earlier ones, the audience is mostly laughing about insults. Maybe it is time to quit.
That Doordash CEO looks like he got bullied a lot back in school. The guy has that one annoying face you want to slap straight away. 16:30 to 18:30 Absolutely agree.
Americans and their tipping smh. Tipping should be made illegal with huge fines to both tipper and receiver. Hard to imagine a shadier scheme for paying for a job.
Grubhub is called Lieferando in Germany. Guess who is making advertising Film with them: Katy Perry…..Same shitty things as in the US. You tip the driver over the App, but the tip never gets to the driver. The company withholds the tip for themselves. All known in Germany
He's 100% correct about The Devil Went Down to Georgia.
As a former delivery driver for Uber Eats I can attest to this. I would regularly get tipped extremely little or not at all for deliveries. Some of those would be massive orders too, requiring multiple trips from the restaurant to my car to load it up, and multiple trips from my car to the customer to unload it. I would regularly get bad reviews for issues relating to food quality, or missing items from a sealed delivery package. These things are not in my control at all. I would get notifications for a delivery where the pickup was 10+ miles from me, and an unknown delivery location until you pick it up, for under $7. If you decline them, you get penalized by the app and get drastically fewer orders. Eventually as a result of that I was barred from food delivery altogether by Uber.
I find it interesting how the same super wealthy giant companies push propaganda that leads to right wing types accusing left leaning people of being communists, while instituting a social credit system as a core element of their business model.
I drive for Doordarsh and I enjoy it, but I do wish the minimum pay for each delivery was higher or that people in my area tipped more. Still, it's a good way to make extra money and feel in control of my time
Outside of pizza delivery ill never use this scummy bullshit. I live in vancouver bc canada and can walk,ride or transit anywhere I need for anything. Food apps are lame.
On point about review with compassion because it really hurts business.  Suddenly we became a culture where everyone is a food critic without an idea of food and hospitality.
I have never used the service nor never will. Im not lazy and i know how to cook. Not even during covid did i use the service. Its ok for thos that need it like the elderly or disabled. But really if you got two legs go get your food yourself you lazy people.
I cancelled and deleted all my accounts with food delivery companies.  I also do not order food from resturants, if they offer it.  I have minimized eating at restaurants for a few reasons (1) most restaurants have bad food and bad cooks (2)  their food is unhealthy (3) workers at the restaurants are poorly trained and I do not trust food hygeine.  I cook food at home.  Save time and money.  And when I really want to eat something from outside, I only go to good restaurants and splurge if needed.
Love that he talked about the monopoly. Tech companies are the new oil barons because theyre so easy to scale
Fun fact. Amazon stole $61 million worth of tips from Amazon Flex drivers.   They were sued by the FTC.  Bezos should be in jail.  https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/02/amazon-pay-617-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-withheld-some-customer-tips-amazon-flex-drivers
Sure love this show. I wish he didn't hate people who believe in God so much though.
Me showing this to my mom cause she's the type to order food, especially during bad weather. We might have a "better" excuse to use delivery services because we actually aren't healthy enough to go outside often, but I always tell her "if you don't wanna be out there, then they don't, either" and her response always was "but they wanna make money" NOT DURING STORMS AND BLIZZARDS, MA OMFG.
Starting an orphanage 🤣🤣🤣🤣 omg wow
i'm glad people are raising the concerns about the disconnect between product and worker's effort with food deliver apps.  i just wish this kind of outrage existed for teachers who have been dealing with the same issue for a long time.
Boycott Food Delivery Apps?
Flour, yeast, salt, a can of tomato sauce and cheese. Wow, you can actually make a pizza at home. Who knew. Thank you, John, for the put option idea on DASH.
That Roosevelt Island in this video is one of the most difficult runs I don't care where you coming from😢😢😢😢
this has been the most annoying crowd ever present at a lastweektonight set in history
This episode missed the chance to discuss how many people under 30 are keeping themselves poor by spending $500 or more per month buying food through delivery apps instead of grocery shopping because of the convenience. It's a really bad money sink for young people who are giving into pessimism about the future and burning their money away on apps.
wait they’ve been charging me $60 for 2 burgers fries and a drink and I’m the winner here??
I love this show, really helps me feel growned. I think I've only not tip a couple of times and I use to use these apps a lot but this reminds me to not use technology as an excuse to treat real people poorly
I've only ever gotten food delivered from the restaurant itself, never a 3rd party. Though, truthfully I prefer picking it up to having it delivered. Also, telling us to tip is not the answer. It should be on the company to pay a real wage to their employees.
Such a cucked opinion to think adding to your insane tipping culture will fix the core issue - what the hell kind of advice is that?
I am not sure why we are being asked to prop up a broken model, John. Everyone should have what they need to survive, workers should be paid wages, and we should not be complicit in the theft of people's lives. Even if that means we have to go to a restaurant or learn how to use a microwave.  Yo, America: slavery is supposed to have been abolished already. But tipping-as-wages and (higher up the class hierarchy) the binding of health care to jobs are direct continuations of slavery.
omg the millennial line hahaha it hurts but its so true lmao
I do not use food delivery. It is dehumanising and it feels dirty. I very rarely go out to eat.
So... I'm the only one who's never ordered food for delivery... 😮
I don't believe for a minute these apps don't make money. That doesn't pass the smell test. I recently attempted to use GrubHub. I wanted burgers from a local place for my wife and me. Walking into the restaurant it would cost us $33.59 and through the app it would have cost $59.72. Fuck that.
I worked for DoorDash and got  bit by a pitbull while delivering…. And all I got was a scar…. I should put that on a shirt 🎉
With all the fees they're charging the restaurants and making bank that way,  the f*ckers still find it necessary to charge fees to the customers. 🤨
American entitlement. This is an industry that didnt even exist before. It is one of those jobs you do INDEPENDENTLY. And you dont have to do it. US is a shit place with much urgent problems such as getting robbed, getting aped, getting shot, getting robbed by trader/politicians. Sensationalizing independent industries is a cheap shot.  That guy working with broken leg isnt a victom of Doordash, its one of million people who cant afford healthcare cuz your health system is trash. This isnt an issue almost anywhere in the world where electricity exsist.
I have no idea what food delivery is..........  so glad I live in the back woods of Vermont and I prepare my own food
People have gotten so lazy that they need someone to bring their food lol
Tips are welfare for capitalists. We should require businesses to pay their workers a living wage and set prices accordingly.
Jim kramer's expression is good but anyone else feel like the postmates guy was on something?? just a vibe lol
Maybe restaurants shouldn't use these delivery apps if they have to split the sales with the App company.
The same with wework. Those "tech" company are just mid agent which we don't need at first place. Just basically they lab "tech", the stupid money just burned.
In the Netherlands GrubHub was forced to directly hire their delivery drivers. Courts ruled it was a fake independence structure. In general it isnt allowed to register as an independent business owner if you have less than 3 different clients per year. The reason this is happening in the US isnt because of greedy corporations (although they are) or because of lazy consumers (although they are) but because of failure to implement legislation to protect poor people from these business practices.
No. I think you guys missed the mark on this one. I think you've let yourself be biased in favour of the popularity of these apps without considering just how destructive they have to be to exist. Not only isn't it sustainable, but it ultimately benefits no one but the rich, hurting everyone, including Millennials, by exploiting any weaknesses in the system. That you're even making a video on this shows that today there's such a problem with _delivery_ that it needs one of your videos the same way Boeing does for its planes falling out of the sky or falling apart.
19:27 Cancer doesn't make money, either, but it'll eat you alive like Uber Eats.
19:15 No. Tipping culture is bullshit. They've started asking for far more than 15% and expect it. They can go to hell and get used to no tip whatsoever. There's no way someone's pay should depend on tips and it's so bad that tipping should be made illegal just to prevent this kind of mentality. It should be a matter of employment standards for everyone from servers to delivery drivers. It should be illegal to ask or offer an option to tip. When no-one's willing to work in the service industry anymore, it'll be because they're not getting paid well anymore, not because people refuse to tip.
Tipping before a service makes no sense
I had a one time experience using GrubHub last week. I noticed the cost from the app did not match the store. I was force to pay an upcharge for condiments. The price for a meal in the store was about $8.00 more. Okay, i was in an all day meeting so that was worth it to me. However, the total cost for a $28.00 dollar meal was $42.00. For one person. There were two additional lines of fees and driver benefit that were ridiculous. The app also wanted me to tip him. I paid it and when the driver came, the food was in his dirty upholstered passenger chair, he had what appeared to be clothes and other stuff in the back seat. The food bag was not sealed and things had moved around and could have been touched.  Never, ever will I use this service again. They have taught me to plan my day better - so this was actually helpful to me.
Id rather not use the dumb apps. I call the restaurant and order by phone and go and pick it up myself. And I support restaurants in my neighbourhood that are walking distance from where I live. Thankfully I live in a very walking friendly neighbourhood.
If you haven’t you should do a video on Amazon drivers. Talk about an unsafe job because of the employers
How in the hell does rating a messed up order by a restaurant in any way reflect onto a driver? I'm no lawyer, but since Uber Eats, Doordash, grubhub, etc, charge restaurant fees to promote the restaurant. Now, it is affecting a drivers rating and earning potential, and protecting the restaurants they charge, that should be seen as a criminal act. It's not creating a level playing field. Mabye states should look into criminal charges and stop going after Trump. I'm just saying.
I was mugged while doing Uber Eats back in 2016. They got my phone but not my bike. Reached out to Uber to have them help me find my phone because I was on a trip. They refused to help me. All while offering lawyers and all the help with Syrian refugees.
Sidenote, gay parts should go to good actors.
I hate those apps they get between me and my food.$$$$
There is next to no law or stopping huge companies to do whatever they want. Remember when all this started? Every website said we will NEVER sell your information. Just has gotten worse and worse.
Every restaurant use to deliver themselves. Why charge so much more? It's a complete rip off.Taxi betting and food delivery are corrupt now.Everything is a monopoly.Price gouging us to death.
No, I don't *have* to tip. These companies need to pay better. Seriously, GFY, Jon. You don't see how that's exactly what these companies want you to say?
Ofcourse American politicians are against helping the people after being lobbied up to $150 million
I think it’s very widespread knowledge how awful ride share and food delivery gigs are.  They should only be used as side jobs or for bored people, and not as a career.
6:54 They paid for promotions 3.5k, so that part is not really the apps fault as I understand it.
Who in hell is actually downvoting this video? I legit would like to ask them some questions...
Th... That was my cake... I'm sorry.
13:50 DON´T give them ideas!!! xD
I remember years ago travelling to cities in Asia with a lot of poverty and seeing bicycle food deliveries frequently, now North America is catching up.
"I'm like Miss Piggy the way I'm hittin' that green" is absolutely fucking unhinged
Yes, the deliv trifecta (of which I now have all 3), aka Grubhub, Uber eats, and Doordash, are ALL leeches. We need to sue the FUCK out of them NOW. Is there a union for this?? Please? We need a union. I'm moving on from delivery for the most part anyway, while still keeping them as a plan B and supplemental income, but I care about all of these workers and I want better for them!!
Uber eats doesn’t give a crap about you if you deliver for them… I know I’ve been doing for a year.. and yes I’m an idiot for doing it because Uber makes me feel like a worthless robot.
18:25 They also have the choice to open an orphanage from the $$$ they're making
5:30 And sometimes, eats part of it, or spits in the next order if you report that
Sorry, it's not my problem to fix  corporate greed and subsidize employee wages. Fix your system. I've never tipped and never will.
Yeah but as a consumer it’s not my job to tip the employee. They should be making a livable wage so we don’t have to feel guilty.
I used door dash this morning for the first time. I gave the driver $20 cash (roughly 110%) because I felt deeply uncomfortable having an overworked, underpaid stranger bring me breakfast. Then she told me she’s a full time nursing assistant and Door Dash is her “side gig.”  I’m really happy to have given her a boost to her shitty day in a shitty job, but I’m probably going back to not using delivery apps.
itks important to remember that this is NOT the customer's issue. if i was an adult back in 2003 I simply wouldn't be able to order food delivery because i'm deaf. the apps have been extremely helpful for that. the actual issue is the gig economy and its precarious employment.
https://youtu.be/aFsfJYWpqII?t=1084 America is a dystopian nightmare.
Some of use know that negatives but we use it because we have busy lives and don't have assistants that can go out and get us whatever we want like you do, John.
👏🏼Great info! Hit on so many levels. GrubHub, et. al are pretty much patterning the Jeff Bezos / Borg business model: "resistance is futile".  20:20... You nail it. These businesses build monopolies that they cannot support, then lay the burden of accountability on everybody else. Most problems are the fault of company policy & procedure, not the employee; yet every customer service rating option now *specifically* asks to rate poor Hector, never the company that's got him weaving flax into gold!    And tipping confuses me. How come everybody but servers get paid actual wages?
It's none of a restaurant's business what I do with my food after I buy it. Including handing it off or reselling it to other people. It's MY FOOD. Not your call anymore, how arrogant and entitled can they be? You basically want to put DRM software in food. How about you go lick a rock instead? Just cook the food, mind your place, you're not Big Brother monitoring my life after I leave the store. You have no right to choose not to be on a 3rd party delivery service.
and john left out how these app's are notorious for stealing workers tips , so PLEASE tip your delivery driver in cash , not on the app .i can tell you from my experience  i would rather have $5 cash than 10 dollars tip in app.
SD 60 here we come. ×2 I hope.  Good luck Parlay.
Seattle's city council is pathetic, absolute whores for big exploitative businesses. And Bruce Harrell is worse.
Where I live a 6 inch sub is 18 dollars and then they emotionally manipulate you into tipping the driver
"check to see if you're still tipping people"  PAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA AHAHHAHAHAHHA!!  jeus america. Jesus. fuck. Just pay your wages to people. I mean My country was comunist less that 30 years ago. NO. Don't go there.. But jesus you need a BIT of socialism. just a bit.
I mean, do you order from these apps? I try not to anymore. Why? I get the wrong food, I get ppl leaving my food outside the main doors instead of bringing it in....and raccoons steal it, and share it with the homeless ppl. Hell, staff members and other residents steal it.  Then we have the time I felt like my fries were low and at the bottom of that container was a FAKE NAIL that matched the nails the driver had. I've had my drink sampled, my dessert taken, and not once, or even twice but 6 times roughly half my order was missing. Thing jostled and food spilled into the bag. Food items crushed and twice the whole order spelled like a Rastafarian techno dance happen in their car.  I pay more that what it would if they had if they retained their own cook/delivery drivers. When I worked food service, we had a sit down service, take out and delivery. We had 2 cooks and 1-2 cooks (depending on days) that also acted as delivery drivers, and one straight delivery person. We sent one driver out, while 2 alternates continued in the kitchen, and 30 minutes later one of them took a delivery of 3-4 pizzas out after we had delivery orders. The other cook/driver was headed out by the time the first one came back. And it rotated like that until we slowed down.  Maybe we need fight for getting rid of tipping and making employers offer livable wages.
shit take. These services shouldn't exist if they cannot be profitable without subsidizing their employees wages onto the consumer. Tip culture is one the most degenerate aspects of American life. it's no longer a bonus for work well done, it's nearly compulsory at this point just to put food on the table of restaurant workers and delivery drivers. And somehow we've allowed the justifiable rage for this behavior to be shifted from the companies who no longer have to pay a reasonable wage, onto the consumer who may decline to foot the bill for these multi-million dollar corporations.
Canned laughter?
Well even if these "Tech Companies" are not making as huge a profit as they see as a success, they are just biding their time trying to stay in business until automated vehicles become a thing.
I`m calling restaurant directly, i don`t need another app on my phone.
In India, the restaurants have the separate price for online food delivery apps. For example, if something in the dine-in menu costs 10 bucks then on delivery apps, price would be 12-13 bucks.
Why can't they enjoy Harry Potter anymore? I still do.
these apps are middle men, delivery and shops do all the work, and they complain they make no money. these people are pitiful
Tipping culture is broken mess and I'm not in position to pay for it.
True, in LA, Grubhub was delivering for Ocha Thi Food without them knowing.  When I called to change order, they told me that they didn't have delivery.
Starting an ORPHANAGE??!!😂😂😂😂😂
Teams aka Skype made a killing during the pandemic John
I've got to disagree about the ratings and tipping here. The most important thing is that workers should refuse to work at places like this - I'm not sure if many people don't understand the deal, e.g. that they won't get insurance, or paid for time not delivering, or if they just don't have any other options; but gig work must in some way be worth it for people to continue working these jobs. I can certainly see the attraction of gig work as a supplement to your main job. But I absolutely don't understand why anyone willingly does it full time. we NEED ligislation to protect people from being forced into harmful jobs
Nah, the devil had to forfeit because he cheated (naturally)
That's why I cook at home and have never used any kind of food delivery service in my life even once.
These delivery apps only pay their drivers $2 - $3 a trip, lucky to get 3 done an hour if you even get the trips.
So if this eventually changes would we get reimbursed what we’re owed?
I have never used these apps since it's super easy in my town to just go pick it up yourself. When would I tip someone else to do what I can do? So many people have had their food stolen!
So stop having kids, lest they should be exploited.
I have only once in my life ordered prepared food delivery. (Plus Amazon Fresh groceries a few times when I was too sick to go out but needed food).  They're so expensive and I couldn't justify the extra cost when I could go pick it up myself.  I've mostly gotten takeout since the beginning of covid as I'm still masking in public thanks to severe chronic illnesses.  But I can drive my car a lot cheaper than delivery drivers, I get my food faster, and if I'm hungry, I can eat it hot and fresh in my car!
"With Pad Thai" relatable
I never, I mean never, use food delivery apps. It’s a bad business but restaurants don’t have any choice. Delivery drivers are totally exploited. These businesses should be closed.  In old days certain restaurants used to deliver. Most restaurants you had to go and pick it up.  Cities should insist on fair pay for the drivers and that would bring some sense to this bad businesses.
As someone who used to work for one of these companies for a few years, I'm looking forward to this.
Uhh yeah I heard all the money I pay doesn't actually go into my fellow wage slave's pockets like it should, and then they end up angry and steal my orders that I paid for-
These people who deliver food are sold a dream. Yes be your our boss just do it for yourself not so some big corporation that doesn’t care about you other than did you make delivery on time and did you get a good review. You won’t make money it’s like working for like $5 an hour profit.
Goodness, I've not watched LWT in a very long time and forgot how good the snark (and information) is. And the writers and directing of the segment, seriously amazing job y'all. Keep it up.
part time my a$$. Ever since DD bought the European Wolt, it went downhill. They cut our pay by 25% and did away bonuses for amounts of deliveries. Before you could work 5 hours and made some nice extra money. Now if you want to get by with minimum wage, its a 8 to 9 hour job, 6 days a week.
The tip-based wage system may have once made sense, but it's clear it's now rampant with exploitation. We need to end it and switch to a straight forward wage system. And yah, some businesses may go under, but if your business can only exist by underpaying employees then maybe it shouldn't actually exist.
11:38  missed opportunity: a cool thing the Devil might offer, like The Presidency
People wont be willing to pay the actual cost it would take to adress all the problems with delivery apps.
Honestly, you're a laugh a never to me. I don't care how much you're hyped by the institution, you were never a funny guy to start with. I'd love your pay check though.
So capitalism good or capitalism bad Free market good or free market bad. Further point: the use case for people who drink at home and don’t drink and drive. Excellent use case. Similar to the weed one, but different.
So you're telling me, these guys can't figure out how to make a phone app profitable while taking 30-50% of the cost of an order from restraunts, and the customer is paying 30-50% more for the food.  Sounds like the companies might be a little bloated.
I have never used any of these apps. Do i win?! 🙂
OMG VeggieTales were real!? I thought Drawn Together made that up.
I have not ordered food delivery since the "food menus in a drawer" model, and still ride in taxi cabs. Last week I was meeting a man for a date and wanted him to pay for me to get there as it was rainy and windy. I made the fatal error of suggesting I would Uber it, assuming he probably had the app on his phone. The Uber arrived and he sent me a screenshot of where it was, several blocks behind my building. So I left my building, walked four blocks up the street and began waving my arms around, yelling out "Is anyone my Uber?" think the children's book Are You My Mother. A number of cars sat quietly with no one stirring. I texted this man back and told him that no one back here was my Uber and what the hell was I supposed to do. He told me the Uber had cancelled and that he would send another one. I told him to please insist that the Uber actually arrived to my *actual address* since I had already walked four blocks and randomly begged random cars in the street to inquire if they were my ride, and frankly I didn't think that paying for a ride in a car should include such demeaning behaviour. He told me that the Uber was there already, and that it was in front of my building. He sent me the picture of the car, I went up to a car that looked similarly, and started to try to get into the backseat, pulling on the door handles which were locked. Some random individual in the driver's seat probably thought that I was a car thief as this was not my Uber either. Luckily, I have become a lot more zen lately, and all of this fictitious behaviour as compared to the way things used to be had not soured my mood, and I (trigger warning, millenials!) phoned this individual, my date, on the phone, refusing any longer to be text messaging this atrocious situation, and I told him that I was ordering a taxi cab that he would pay for when I arrived at the bar. This is truly a moment of Generation X-ers like myself, like John Oliver, screaming at the top of our lungs, shit sure isn't the way it used to be, like it was in the good old days!!! There's a reason that taxi cabs are painted orange and there is a humongous plastic sign screaming out to you on its top!! I f****** hate the gig economy, I f****** hate food delivery apps, and I most especially, f****** hate Uber. 😂😂😂
US tipping system is some of the most exploitative practices in a developed country
Can’t wait for John to do something on Instacart who just cut batch pay from 7 dollars min to 4 dollars and somehow slipped under the radar
That’s why I always leave a tip, I try to explain this to my family, my SO, and everyone and they think I’m weird and stupid for doing so 😒
People have stopped using fast food and tipping due to costs.
This is a seriously charged issue for several reason, but as a former chef for over 15 years, yall need to undestand one VERY important part...  Tipping culture only benefits managers and ownership.  On average, restaurant PROFITS are anywhere from 2-9%. That's considering 1/3 for food cost, 1/3 for front/back of house labour and around 20% static costs such as rent, utilities, etc.  House tips, which servers overcontribute to, end of subsidizing kitchen wages. While, problematicly, being distributed to 'managers' discretion.   However, the ideology of tipping culture is now truly overextended. Services like Hvac installation now include a tip option.  Let's be clear, you dont deserve a tip for doing your job. It's not the responsibility of the consumer to compensate you; its that of the company.  Moreover, the 'expectations' of a minimum 20% tip is outrageous. Upon having terrible service, with a server getting upset from my 10% option (being overly generous considering she was too busy flirting with another table rather than serving my family 6-top), I reduced it to 0%.   The newer servers deem themselves entitled to tips, rather than working for them. An important distinction
As a former Uber driver, I can say it is one of the most stressful and high intensity jobs imaginable. Not only does 70% of your income come from tips, so if people don’t you literally make almost nothing, In order to even have a CHANCE of making minimum wage you cannot stop even for a second during your work day, no lunch, no drinks, no phone calls nothing as you get no stipend for being clocked in whatsoever, you only get money for making deliveries themselves. You need to be 100% focused driving and delivery orders as fast as you can. Not to mention gas will literally eat over half of your money just by itself. You are so painfully aware that every wasted second is lost money it becomes depressing. Traffic jams, long elevators, people slow to answer doors, all cost you and you are, like I said, *painfully* aware of that fact. Every single one is infuriating as you are literally watching your money tick away with time. And we havent even gotten to the worst part. When you are offered a job you have TEN SECONDS to decide whether to accept it, and sometimes, you will literally end up with a job that costs more in gas to deliver than you actually make from the delivery itself and that’s assuming you get a GOOD TIP. If you get a bad tip you’ll literally lose money. Most people don’t order large amounts of food so the tips are tiny even if they are large % wise. You can literally get assigned a job where it will take 40 minutes to pick up and deliver the food and you’ll make 5$ TOTAL. 40 minutes for 5$ and remember it probably cost more than 5$ in gas. You have no idea how much you will make for a drive in advance as the only number the app gives you is the “potential earnings” which includes what Uber pays you PLUS what they think you *should* get in tips. But it’s literally always MUCH less than what Uber says you will because people don’t tip. If I drove for an hour and received no tips and only made what Uber gave me as a delivery fee I would make literally 10$ TOTAL before gas if I’m LUCKY. And remember, at least half of that is going to gas. It needs serious regulation as right it’s practically equivalent to a sweat shop.
Teams bought Skype and ended it. Educate yourself..
The "Trigger warning for anyone under 30" was fantastic 😂 as someone who isn't lazy enough to ever use any of these apps, their meteoric growth was so fascinating. Even before recognizing how evilly the companies and consumers involved behave
Microsoft put money behind teams and de-emphasized Skype 😊
another thing to mention, is working for food delivery long term, your car will absolutely break down faster. and you now just have to pay for the repairs
I had no idea that delivery workers were treated so badly by these apps.
DoorDash could charge 1000$ on one order that’s huge, and still will only pay the driver 2$, same for Uber eats and grub hub.   I used to work for these companies a few years ago when the promotions were still there and it was actually worth using your car for.  A year or two ago it basically died drastically and with the massive influx of illegal immigrants buying fake accounts and using multiple phones, the gig market is far oversaturated.   So while these huge scam corporations are ripping off their workers who make them all the money, you also have the dummies who game the system and also don’t know any better so they work for Pennie’s like idiots!   Now a days you’d be lucky to make 20-25$ an hour on a good day on peak hours, and even then that’s not after gas, taxes and wear n tear on your vehicles, it’s just not worth it anymore unless you drive a bike or scooter.
16:37 that is actually, when I turn round to shout at someone for passing me reckless on a bike on the footwalk ... and it's a food deliverer, I let it go.
I have been trying hard to convince my adult children to _drive_ to the restaurant for take out. They don't care that it's cheaper, (it's my car), _but_ they _do_ care that it's unsustainable for the restauranteur.
I'm so happy someone finally defended the devil's fiddle playing. I don't know who comes up w/this random shit 🤣
When do episodes air? John Oliver drops less than Andre 3000
John Oliver is just another talking head. Who has a rational thought every so often. 🤦‍♂️
Also, these independent contractors forget to set aside money to pay taxes. Then when taxes come due, they’re screwed.
Is john truly high as a kite during these shows??!
No different than DJT
Tipping is a curse on society. We need to normalize the absence of tipping and through legislation ensure employers such as restaurants and contractees like GrubHub pay fairly to the workers.
Time is money, but I value money 💴 more.  I would not use these companies as a consumer or business
Everyone should just stop tipping.
ghost kitchens around here make it so you have to use one of these. no pickup option
One night on the doordash app i made $300 just sitting in a parking lot of a closed restaurant that the app thought was open. Each canceled order was worth $5-8.   One time on Grub Hub, i was in a pilot program where i was guaranteed $20/hour to only accept Taco Bell orders. For months, i would sign in for 12 hours a day and stay home because i was too far away from a taco bell to receive an order.  One night on Grub Hub, a guy had stolen credit cards and was putting $100 tips on orders from the store mext to his apartment. He was just asking for $50 in cash back. I never gave him any money, but my friend and I both made over $500 that night. The parking lot of the store was full of dashers.  The apps are fun.
Also, I love how audibly happy the translator/narrator guy sounds to finally be narrating the speech of someone who isn't a dictator of some sort.
Not sure why this is hard for some people, tipping as a concept needs to gtfo, it's just a way for society to reward assholes, they get cheaper service because they don't care that their server is going to go to bed hungry. Capitalism is 100% the problem here, it's not a coincidence that you give a tip *after* service, meaning it's very easy for an asshole to get great service and have a laugh when they stiff the worker who went the extra mile. How is it I can figure this out having never worked in service AND having almost never eaten out?? Oh, right, because in construction if you treat people that badly you risk having a load of bricks 'accidentally' dropped on your head, when you stiff a service worker you just have a laugh and leave. Most countries don't like the idea of tips, and pay workers living wages accordingly, if fast food in Scandinavia can pay workers living wages then actual restaurants here definitely can.   Also, the entire purpose of the 'gig' economy was to allow large companies to have workers that they can treat even worse than is normally legal because of a variety of stupid loopholes that were built into the system. Nobody who has more than 2 brain cells thought the rules should have been different for uber than for cab drivers, yet they were despite the two DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING. It's incredibly evil, and it's how capitalism works... John jokes about finance bros trying to 'capitalize' (read: enshitify) orphanages, we joke about it but they'd do it in a heart beat if they could, they enshitified prison and care homes, to say nothing of schools, it's not like they'd feel bad about ruining the lives of orphans. The suits don't lose sleep over children being coerced into working in meat packing plants late into the night, society has no consequences for business people who do objectively awful things in the name of raising their own wage. Ever since reagan their has been a huge push to lionize the rich in the US, it's a combination of the poor needing to pretend we live in a meritocracy (and thus their shitty position is ultimately justified, and the lofty ones of the rich assholes is as well), and the rich literally investing billions of dollars collectively to gaslight us into worshipping them. If we don't wake up as a society we're going back to feudalism  (and the fascism needed to maintain it).   Also, unless you're physiologically unable to, LEARN TO COOK. I'm not even saying you need to learn how to grow your own food, just learn how to cook, do not be dependent on restaurants (fast or otherwise) for most meals, prepare your own food from raw ingredients. If a company knows that you don't know how to cook, they know they can raise their prices and you will still have to pay (or find elsewhere to eat), the rich want the masses to have as few real skills as possible, as little spare time as possible, and as poor as possible. The rich don't want you to know how to cook, just learning how to boil rice and fry an egg is STICKING IT TO THE MAN! DO it people! Then, start learning some other skill that the rich don't want you to have, like making art that doesn't support our corporate overlords, or learn to build stuff! The less you are dependent on corporations for the better of you will inevitably be, and the less dependent our collective society is, the better off the majority of us will be. Ever wonder why all of our mainstream TV and movies present communes as being hippy-dippy bullshit? it's because corporate America was losing it's precious WORKERS to those communes, and it needed to demonize them, having skills is cool, being an asshole is not; it took me until the 3rd grade before I figured out that most of what made a kid 'cool' was essentially sucking on corporate ass, at which point I stopped trying to be cool, I wore hand me down track pants to middle school, and they had repairs! Being what corporations tell us is cool fucking sucks, joining together with your fellow workers? Now that shit is COOL!
Middle aged anchor says he's baked.........cool
Moral of the story: dont be lazy, get your own food
I'm not tipping I already paid for delivery.
Microsoft bought Skype, not for the technology but for the users. That's what happened.
ive only used delivery apps once . maybe for a rich person its convenient but for anyone else its a total rip-off . only in america would we invent a company that benefits nobody lol
If you’re using a prepared food or a grocery app you’ve lost the right to complain about the price of everything going up.
That harry potter line hit hard lol
I know this girl in Seattle who works as a tattoo artist 🎨 but due to losing work due to COVID, she had to do Uber Eats and Doordash for a while.  According to her, she once delivered to a house as they were having a bachelor's party, he host paid her an extra $25 in cash to come in and deliver the food directly to the living room, the guys sitting there were drunk, loved the artwork on her body and before she could leave, the host came to her offering her $500 to let them pull a g.b. on her.  Note, according to her, there were 15 to 20 guys there.  She turned him down so he then offered her just $200 for her to go with him to his room and feeling uncomfortable about all this, she just left.  I don't know if being solicited is a thing for other female delivery drivers but it was her experience.
They still deliver alcohol too. Which I thought would be illegal.
Food delivery apps? I’m no sucker!
Fuck you John.  make your shit available in Canada for new vids.  Get more views.    This ridiculous bullshit has stopped the rest of us from looking just once at your vids for years.
Imagine our local governments protecting their constituents from things just like this...but this is America.
Welcome to Technofeudalism bois.
Skype always glitched & cut off when I would use it in the past.
It kind of hurts to hear Oliver get behind companies passing wage costs off to customers.
Finally, validation for the Devil! I always thought he won that round. Delivery apps need regulation, no doubt. They killed local delivery copmanies around here.
…why gay parts should go to gay actors? No really  Aren’t actors supposed to represent a character they are not? Aren’t they suppose to bring to life emotions, stories and backgrounds that are not theirs? Isn’t their work supposed to mantain a suspension of disbelief?  bloody stop with this nonesense
Rich people do not even use the products and/or services that they own which means everything is garbage so they can maximize profits.
"starting an orphanage" bro ☠️☠️☠️
Minneapolis pass rules to get minimum protections and the apps just said, "Ok, we're gone."
The USA needs to make tipping illegal and require businesses to pay employees a living wage.
Homes were possible to get as a millennial before mid 2020. I do feel badly for everyone post-pandemic, though. Pure insanity now.
I am dying at the saving up to "start an orphanage"
This guy is such a loser now 😂
it's bullshit that they're not making profits. it's only to not pay taxes, instead they are paing their sub-companies or sister companies horrendous amounts for stuff like licenses. it's common with tech companies and big corporations in general that they push their income to places they pay basically no taxes. in 2023 doordash paid $31m in taxes on an $8.6b revenue. that's 0,36% income tax. and that money goes exclusively to CEOs and big shareholders
I refuse to use these food delivery apps; I make sure I cook or grab something myself on my way home from work.. or walk to a local restaurant if am already home or see if restaurant has their own delivery
Never used one of these apps and never will. Fuck billionaires and the millionaires who work for them.
I don’t tip and I won’t tip. Do something about it or mind your business
6:43 Most of that was advertising fees. It's the reason why he even got that much sales to begin with.   Owners need to understand that delivery is a side thing. They don't have to hire additional workers, pay additional rent etc. Whatever they make from it is extra income. Without it, that income is zero.   Also, it costs A LOT of money to run a delivery app.
The craziest thing i heard was when i was dating a regional manager for pizza hut, she said they were having meeting's about incorporating GrubHub into their business model. I asked her why since it didn't make sense, youre just adding a middle man, she shrugged her shoulders and said fkk if i know.
2:22 ive never used any food delivery app im glad to say. Just seems fkkn lazy as sht to me.
Greed is destroying society..It's poorly paid slavery for workers.
Uber eats is the best. Door dash and Grubhub are trash to work for but at least with Uber you really just turn it on whenever you want
"You can't spell millenial without 3 massive Ls"... I'm dying! :P  Do news channels not realize how dystopian those kind of "broken foot still has to work" stories are? How the hell aren't Americans rioting in the streets for coverage on that shit?!
I've been doing rideshare for 6 yrs and pay has literally fallen off a cliff over the past year while Uber's stock has tripled!  Pay in downtown Chicago is $15/hr after gas and there are hardly any surge hours any more.  Pax still pays pretty high rates but Uber & Gryft take 50-70% from the total and drivers are left with PEANUTS!  But $15/hr is BIG MONEY for desperate people and immigrants.  And they constantly LIE about how much they take!
No.  You "don't" have to tip *and* SHOULDN'T (yes, that dirty word) have to tip.  People should get paid for their work.  By the entity employing them.  It shouldn't be up to the clients to pay MORE for the service on TOP of all the additional charges.  NO.  Just no.  The client who doesn't tip is not the problem.  Get with it.
70%+ of Americans are overweight or obese. Maybe you shouldn’t be ordering food when most of people can’t handle a $1000 emergency and have a $500 car payment.
He’s correct about the mafia margins and seriously don’t agree with it but as neurodivergent driving for Uber eats is the only job that doesn’t make me want to scoop my eyeballs out 🤷‍♂️
I stopped using delivery food apps a long time ago. The food was double the price than at the restaurant. There were so many service fees and delivery charges. Plus you still had to tip. Orders would be cold or wrong, and not to mention how long it would take for the driver to actually find you. It’s always just better to go and get it yourself.
If restaurants aren't making adequate profits from delivery service sales, then they don't need to use and pay for these services. The basic facts that restaurants choose to use delivery services and that customers choose to order through them is proof of their value to society.
I'm all about the pre-pandemic scenario as read by John Oliver MINUS the tipping.  This is such an awful United States phenomenon (that, like a cancer, is unfortunately spreading) and secondary to greed.  Pay your workers!  Who wants to pay inflated prices for food, then pay a delivery or "service" fee and then have to tip on top of that?  As in my other comment, if you use a third party service, you have to pay much more.  This is something that's always turned me off about simply eating at restaurants.  The expectation that you'll leave a tip.  Only in the United States.  Again, pay your workers.  Don't expect your clients to do so.  Greed.  As an aside:  If you don't agree with this, you're part of the problem and/or done gone and bonked your head.
Greed.  These companies (and so many others) are greedy.  Fees upon fees upon fees on top of subscriptions on top of inflated (sometimes significantly so) prices on menus in these services coupled with the expectation that after paying $135 for a $1 hamburger, you should tip the driver $5.  Only in the United States!
Aside:  While it's a joke, I don't presently agree with the sentiment that acting roles "should" (which is a dirty role) go to humans that most reflect the role in real life.  That's absurd.  If a human resembles a part and is able to portray it well - and in doing so that results in bettering the film - great.  However, skin color, gender, ethnicity, ableness, beliefs, preferences, and lifestyles (etc.) shouldn't be (again with that dirty word) on a resume.  It's... acting.  Make believe.  If this had always been the case, we would never have been graced with the deeply moving roles of Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder or Temujin in The Conqueror.  Case closed.
How the hell do they not make profit??? They charge the restaurant and the delivery customer excessive costs and have little in overhead or actual employees. Something stinks...
I think we can all see why restaurants have increased their prices...
I drove for Grubhub for a while when i was taking college courses. It wasnt too bad of a part time job. But it puts a LOT of mileage on the car. Oil changes and new tires come often. There was a 12/hr minimum payment rate. The most popular restaurants that i delivered from were always bitching that it is so much extra stress for them and they make basically no money from it. This report seems to confirm that.   I gamed the system for a while. I found a park near my house that was on the outskirts of GrubHub territory. It was far enough out that i didnt get any orders, but still in the territory so no one noticed. I would sit there on a table in the park and study while collecting my 12/hr minimum and having zero deliveries assigned to me.   I was able to do that for 3 months or so before they finally got wise and started forcing me orders.
Really hate that pride ad. It's supposed to be pride, not BDSM, and BDSM bottoms are not expected to starve. They are equals that are actors in a scene.
So many people and corporations are parasitic.
I do ubereats on the side in NYC it was pretty decent when I first started in the summer of 23 but since they added "schedules" ever since they were forced to pay a hourly rate now you're only guaranteed 5hrs a week and can't just sign on whenever you want unless your "area" is busy. You usually get paid more during bad weather because there are far less ppl willing to work in those conditions.
I know it wasn't this episode, but your community channel hasn't been posted: From your April 14/2024 episode, during your Medicaid fraud portion, you mentioned a 4 yr old doesn't have reason for alcohol rehab and should have been a red flag for that office. Would it not be used for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome as treatment? (I am also a Late Night Jackal 🥰)  Edit - And I'm aware of the staffing issues in the medical industry everywhere, but I really hope that Dr. Brian Morley in Iowa had his license taken away due to his medical negligence. 2nd Edit - I say this all with the Utmost respect and appreciation!
BigTech companies are demonstrating the worst that human beings can be :(
Outlaw tipping
i wonder if smaller towns like mine have the same problems. We have a population of about 20,000. Before doordash the only places in town who delivered were pizza places and a couple of sandwich shops. Unfortunately we had no drawer of take out menus.
Why America sounds like mexico eat rice a d beans
Who tell this people to work as delivery driver ya are f get a real job not people fault ya work for takes all income bad jod bad job u better off been a security 😂
Right on. Thanks for sharing.
Blaming millennials for everything is getting old. I'm one of those. The problem is unethical business practices and unethical consumerism. 1) Make your own food. It's healthier for you anyway 2) Pick up your own orders. Support restaurants by actually going there. 3) Reward services that add the most value: the people who make your food, the small businesses that employ them, your delivery person who pays for their own gas and deals with traffic so you don't have to.
_"A different system does not inherently mean a better system. We replace bad systems with worse ones all the time. We replaced a bad system of work and bosses with a terrible system of apps, gigs, and on-demand labour."_ -Dan "Folding Ideas" Olson, _Line Goes Up - The Problem With NFTs_ (2022)
I don’t think we the consumers are winning. With Uber Eats, they charge fees, delivery fees, and then you have to tip. All in all, it adds up costing 30% or more than just going to the restaurant and picking up the food/eating there. And the further the restaurant the higher the delivery fee. It’s only worth it when you’re in a rush/trying to save time or are sick/cant leave the house.
Denmae delivery app in Japan uses photos of random stock photo food that isn’t available anywhere and has no connection to any of the restaurants they partner with. Don’t give a thought when it’s non Japanese food.  Burgers can be from any old stock photo service
WHAT!!!!!!
Higher menu price Delivery fee	 Service fee	 Tax…  All Costing more than the actual in-store meal
I avoid food apps. If I am too lazy to cook, I have to leave the house. I'll tip the person serving me beer n food.
Why don't they get a job?
I used to use Door Dash 3-5 times a week. Now I haven't used it in well over a year. I was even subscribed for a while. It's WAY too expensive before you even get to the insane bidding war (tips). I'd rather pay a coworker to go get my food or do it myself.
So I definitely started using these services during Covid and OVER-USING them. I've had to slow down for cost and health reasons, but they were absolutely a life saver on many occasions, and still now once in a blue moon. But my confusion is this. I didn't know the companies were not making a profit, and it's because, as John is saying, we're benefitting from them not charging us what it costs? How is that possible when I'm paying $40 for a $17 meal, plus $3-5 n a delivery fee, a $4 surcharge, taxes, and then I tip on top of that. How am I supposedly getting this convenience at a bargain when I'm spending an INSANE amount of money on one meal that neither the restaurant, nor drivers, nor the app is profiting from? I assumed it was that expensive because someone was benefitting. So when they say this is a convenience model that doesn't make sense, they really mean it. It doesn't make sense. Because you're telling me I would have to be paying about 4 times the cost of the food to make it worth it to the restaurant, at least a 50% tip for it to be worth it to the driver, and they'd have to charge me $10-15 "delivery fee" just to go to the app AND they'd likely have to start reigning in the radius for which drivers and restaurants were actually in a deliverable distance? Also where did the $184 million come from to get prop 22 passed? Is that just part of the "cost of doing business?" I also wonder where other services rate in this issue. Taskrabbit and things like it, since instacart was part of the lobbying groups but not specifically mentioned as food delivery. So could you just call and order food at a restaurant for pick up, hire a task rabbit to go to a restaurant and pick up your food and bring it you and just pay the tasker, the restaurant, and whatever cuts taskrabbit charges? Mostly saves the managing restuarant agreements and menus on an app. Just seems like this should be able to work and trying to pretend like I'M the one winning right now when I get to pay $60 for a single meal for one is just not it.
I think they are lying when they say they are losing money. Unless they are spending way too much on advertisement. They have no overhead. Only one HQ nationwide, they take a piece of the restaurant's profits, and pay their workers out of the delivery service fee.
The pressure from the ratings system is overblown. Users that consistently give out low scores are the ones that get punished. If a delivery person consistently gets low scores, they tend to be fucked up.
I thought my manager was lying when she said they boosted the prices on UberEats because they take a huge cut. I assumed Uber made all of their money on the service charge. I thought we were being greedy af.
“15 guys just standing around” 😂 If that’s true he’s a horrible business owner. It’s like saying you don’t hire waiters because when it’s not busy they’re just standing around. I’ve worked in restaurants in NYC with delivery drivers and that’s just not the case at all. Restaurant owners tried to take a shortcut by using these apps and it’s backfired so they act as if in the past it was all but impossible to deliver food.
No, screw the food delivery companies. They take money from restaurants, and don't pay the workers fairly. I shouldn't have to pay crazy tips just because the company can't figure out its business model.
19:25 Someone in the whole mess is lying.  You spend a huge overcharge on an already expensive sandwich.  So where does that money go?  The restaurant says they can barely make ends meet, the driver gets peanuts, and even the app developer claims they can't make a profit?  Where is that 25$ going?  The farmer Mafia?
I refuse to tip service workers because of this. Apps and restaurants want to make the big bucks and leave peanuts to service workers, hoping that customers will pay for it. While they keep on raising prices crazily every now and then. I prefer to pick up my own food because I don’t subscribe to this mafia.
I think to myself. "What kind of scum orders food delivery?" and then I remember oh yeah, my fat ass lazy sister that still lives with our parents. For EVERY meal.
I order directly through the restaurant's website, and tip at least 18% minimum.
Have never used one of these services, definitely will not now
If I pay a ton of fees that increases the price of the menu compared to the restaurant itself tremendously, I'll round up to the next full $ at max. If the menu costs roughly the same, I'd be ok with tipping. Sure I'm happy to get my food delivered, but I'm not gonna pay double the price with tips included.
This topic is concerning but I’m more concerned with $95B appropriation bill for weapons. Seems exponentially more important.  Maybe a show on tax reform?
ChowNow is the only delivery app that's worth it.
Resturants can deliver to their own customers.
Yep, not only are you giving these gig economy companies your labor for peanuts and scraps, like that guys scooter, you are using your own capital for their business. Talk about a magic trick. Corporate greed devouring everything. You will Subscribe! to everything, own nothing, and love it! smh
Wait i haven't finished the video yet, let me guess: the executives take all the money for themselves? Ah! How did I know that? smh This entire economy is nothing but a ponzi scheme. We work ourselves to death, CEO's and their gang of wall street executives, take all the money.
A local pizza place we love to order from used to employ their own delivery drivers, complete with heaters and warming bags in their delivery vehicles to help keep the pizza at a decent temperature.  Lately they switched to using DoorDash for their deliveries. The  pizza boxes sit out on the driver’s front seat, and it’s lukewarm at best by the time it arrives. Definitely a downgrade.
classic elitist fudgery pay workers tip and give them 5 stars no matter what, assuming everyone ordering is millionaire like them. why not force corporations to provide living wages and some human decency ? If a job business can only sustain by pity money then that job/business should not exist.
I've never used one of these apps.  I've been with people using them, but they strike me as a rip.  I'm not that lazy.  I'll either go get it myself or make something.
Maybe This is partly responsible for prices going up. We’re paying more for the same thing because of laziness and convenience. How can we complain about prices when we order things to be delivered right to our door. That delivery costs us. This is not to say prices haven’t been going up because of other reasons but dang
Do people still order from restaurants that deliver directly? I feel like it defeats the purpose of direct delivery if someone is willing to spend more thru an app that asks for costly delivery fees with the only convenience being that they have a catalogue of food options.
This is exactly why I don’t use any of those apps. 😂 diabolical behavior!
Between tips, fees, and inflation, delivery has gotten so insanely expensive it’s routinely over $20 cheaper to just make a 15 min round trip to pick up the food yourself.
you shouldn't tip at all anyway as the tipping culture maintains the lack of a normal properly taxed realistic income
UberEats is being forced by the EU court to start employing their drivers. They started a pilot in the Netherlands where drivers are under contracts with hourly wage via temp agencies, with actually quite good pay. As a driver myself for 4+ years I’m not “eligible” for this “pilot” as I already have an account with Uber. None of the existing drivers are eligible. The pilot is now full in my city with new drivers, meaning there are now an excess of drivers for the same amount of orders. Uber is literally pushing out the existing loyal workers and replacing them with new ones. I’m also quite sure they are pushing orders to the accounts of those new drivers, as employing them costs more. Can’t confirm this, but it’s a hunch. Also: they are pushing double/triple orders, but instead of receiving double the pay, you receive less because “2 for 1”. It’s bleak.
We did not use any food delivery ever here in Canada. It is too expensive.
I would have expected John to be against tipping.   I will not tip a driver over the cooks
Tipping as a solution is exactly what these apps want. Oliver is doing their bidding.
So they raised the salaries but customers should still tip? Tipping is part of the problem in the first place. Salaries is to be paid by the employer. There are plenty of harder, low paying jobs that get zero tip anyway.
Venture Capitalism has ruined capitalism. It's allowing a small percentage to rule over and ruin the many. It is how these apps were born and we are allowing them to run our lives.
The analysis is good and basically confirmed what I thought about these services. I’ve yet to see how “disrupt” has done more than take away reasonable jobs, livelihoods and end up in the pockets of “Silicon Valley tech bros”.   Even during the pandemic, I don’t use the app services. I called up local restaurants the old fashion way and went and picked it up. The restaurant put the food in the entrance foyer and both restaurant- customers were within Covid guidelines.   I think JO did miss a very big part when he said the winners “in a small way are the consumers.” Nope tech Bros don’t do anything for consumers without First lining up their multi-million dollar wallets. While the companies are unprofitable - JO did you look at the annual salaries, bonus and benefits the founders and executives get? By not focusing on them you are letting them get away with what used to be restaurant’s and their employees margin.
He truly deserves to win the Primetime Emmy's annually. He is a master at what he does; entertaining, educating and enlightening.
learn how to cook america.
It isn't cheaper. And fuck your tips, pay your workers.
The dominos in my city still uses it's own delivery drivers and is not on any app
I'd tip cash sometimes, even tell them in the Chat so they didn't take long
Don't make fun of delivery services too much, because thanks to the recession, you may find yourself trying to get a job working as a delivery person for one soon.
The surge in food delivery app usage really underscores a transformation in consumer habits and the restaurant industry during the pandemic. As entrepreneurs, it's crucial to consider the sustainability and ethics of these platforms, ensuring fair practices that support both businesses and gig workers alike. 🍽
For sure while using Uber eats as a driver, if you accept an order and get the restaurant that is closed, you have to cancel the order, and that lowers your rating and effects your earning potential.  And that’s the way the algorithms work. I just got off the phone with them about this issue. Even if you contact Uber’s Trip Support department to relay why you need to cancel an order, it still lowers your rating. So, there is no efficient prevention of issue and it seems intentional by all the delivery apps I use which is Uber Eats, DoorDash, Favor, and Instacart. Most of the orders requests I get through Uber Eats app pay less than $0.25 a mile. There are so many issues I run into on a daily basis that I don’t even want to use them any more, but where I live there are no good jobs. So I’m this is my fallback option until I find another decent job. Of which there are very few.
Delivery riders are so under-appreciated. They risk life and limb, through the harshest conditions, to deliver the customers' orders to their doors. All this for barely enough pay to survive, many times not getting proper tips, and even getting bad ratings from unscrupulous customers. Hope we can appreciate more of what they do, and give them a bit more respect.
"If your looking to me to help you pay your rent...I have 4 words for you...LEARN TO FUCKING TYPE- Steve Buscemi "Reservoir Dogs""
Drop the UFO clip please.
my dad does Uber eats in canada. He is 56 years old, and cant do Uber rides because his car is older than 7 years...wtf? and customers are so fucking rude demanding him to come all the way up and ring up their bells instead of dropping them off at the lobby. and they make him wait till they come down, make him come inside even fi security says no and even if there is no parking, or if theres a lot of snow or water soaking him
I remember going to order Uber Eats one time and the app said "it appears it's raining, be sure to tip your driver well." So I sent them a message saying that if the app knows when it's raining and is capable of reminding customers to tip well, then it's also capable of increasing a driver's wages at those times as well. Tipping culture is disgusting
The side hustle orphanage was fucking lmao! Dude clearly lost the plot
I am literally having the hardest time getting a refund from a DoorDash/Pizza Hut order! It’s only $9 and they are refusing to refund me! I ordered two items from Pizza Hut, one item was missing. They had DD deliver. Pizza Hut said DD would refund but they did not. I called Pizza Hut headquarters to ask for a refund. They say a manager has to look into it. I’ve called twice and it’s been almost a month. It’s only $9! Tired of the corporate greed. This is bc I tipped beforehand too!
As I got a few minutes into this episode I found myself wondering if I had seen this video before because it sounded so familiar but this video just came out of purgatory today (being allowed to be viewed in Canada finally) so I definitely wasn't watching it on this channel again because it'd have shown that I had watched it before and then I remembered that I watched this video 2 weeks ago on some other bootleg channel here on youtube. I wonder how many views they miss out on by limiting the video for 2 weeks and having those other people just watch it elsewhere. I know the greedy execs are going to take the wrong lesson from this and try to crack down harder on bootleg channels but there is a much more effective step they could do to pretty much kill off those bootleg channels which is to just release it everywhere.
Just because a law is bad for a corporation, doesn't mean it's good for workers.
I was ordering Uber Eats while watching this!
I am so tired of every company asking for a tip. It’s the responsibility of the company to pay their employees, not mine.
When he said “picture this, it’s ___” in my head he was gonna go back like a decade to the mid 90s, not 2 decades back to 2003
I agree with John's Devil Went Down to Georgia take and would like it expanded please/
Skype out there catching strays
We sit here, week after week, sometimes night after night, watching guys like John Oliver and Jon Stewart tell us what is wrong with the world, and yet we do nothing about it.
Uber was brought into existence not to make money, but to make people use taxis less. You see, taxi drivers generally have unions. That dirty U word that makes the greedheads clutch their pearls and say "oh my god won't SOMEONE think of the stockho.. I mean the customers!" Their business model is literally replace a service operated by semi-miserable cab drivers who nonetheless have actual jobs with a service that is run by completely miserable, nervous, anxious "independent contractors" that they can get rid of whenever they want. That, and when one of their drivers runs a red light and plows into a crowd of widows and orphans because their numbers are low, they can walk away. "Hey, he doesn't work for us, he's independent. Not our problem."
I hate apps checking workers
Someone ate two slices of pizza from my sisters order lol... Carryout only for me!
Not skype catching strays 😂
So tech bros sold a tech by devaluing human lives while also being just  a sunk cost fallacy grift that is bad for the people who buy, deliver and sell.    Yay!
The notion that you're technically getting money back is laughable.  If a $15.00 "supper" costs $25 to get to my door, I've spent $10 too much.
the whole tipping concept is very US centric. no where else in the world are employees relying on tips just to survive
“Trigger warning for anyone under 30. You make a phone call” LOL FELT 🤣💀
I don’t believe in tipping for everything that’s why I don’t order food
Never used food delivery other than the standard pizza from the place down the other end of town... Uber et al not involved.
We tend to stay away from these sorts of apps except for very rare circumstances, or to place takeout orders at a couple places where they don't do phone takeout and don't have websites. That written, literally last night we got delivery. When I was checking prices for us, the order was going to cost over $60 with DoorDash, but if only $48 if it was from the company's website directly. The thing that blew my mind though, was that the delivery from the company's website was delivered by DoorDash! So if the company's website, and DoorDash, were the same delivery service and driver pool, why was the DoorDash App 25% more expensive!?
I've never used these apps. I'm sure there are other people who have never used them either. What a waste of money. And trusting amateurs with your food? Have seen too many fumbles there.
my god i remember when grubhub would do that, our prices on a website were outdated so their prepaid cards would decline and it would always be a huge headache,
Yo our kinks should not be just another stat the advertisers openly use to sell sh**.   That's wierd man.
Everytime I've ordered Uber or door dash I felt ripped off and often frustrated with mistakes in the order. Idk how we benefit as consumers besides saving 20 minutes on the road.
I do not get it. With the unemployment rate at the level it is (on average, there might be specific places where this doesn't apply), only people who want to do this do this. I'm sure in most cases if someone really wanted, they could get a non gig job with standard benefits. In most cases, they don't because they like the flexibility. There are plenty of people who want to do this whenever they feel like it. I think we should leave this industry alone and let them provide these type of jobs for people who want that. I would not legislate them out of existence. Also, regarding costs, these are middleman setups. If profits are too high, new competitors will come in, and they'll compete for both users, restaurants and drivers. Most of these problems will be fixed over time with free market, unless governments get involved and regulate the market so that competitors cannot compete and existing companies become fully moated, untouchable.
Yeah I hate these apps. Used to drive for a company that delivered food from restaurants just like these apps, but was only local. Then they added Grubhub stuff for us to get. They took a bit of money from our company, and drivers money. The company doesn't exist aymore. Went on to drive for DoorDash, and UberEasts. Hated how little I made.
I can see a lot of European Vs. American opinions. I have myself worked as a delivery man and people tip very rarely, but even when they do, it is considered a bonus. The company still pays me a living wage, not a lot, but enough to pay my rent and bills and have some extra on the side.
Remember when you could call the restaurant if there was a problem with your order, and the restaurant would do what they can to make it right?
Skype really Britta'd it
In China, you do not tip any delivery service. You just pay the price the app asks, and it's done. You pay exactly the amount that pops up on your screen when placing the order, and you will get your delivery in no time.
John Oliver has quickly become an American national treasure. His shows are incredibly eye opening. Keep up the great work and looking forward to future episodes of "Last Week Tonight"
PREPARED Food Delivery killed the romanticism of the "sit-down/serving-staff" dining experience.  I haven't and will never order prepared food delivery... with the exception of pizza, because that is in its own category of american fare.
Why is the responsibly for customer to pay for drivers' wage via tip? Those platform needs to pay their drivers.
So the restaurant I work at tried the no tipping thing and raised out prices on things that were super expensive and guess what? That was wings and seafood. . .guess what people did/said? One customer threw the box of 10 wings and said its not worth the money and another yelled at me then the entire management group as if we even had anything to do with the changes. . . .that was during the pandemic because people  WERE NOT TIPPING. .  .so the restaurant did try it's just everyone commenting "you shouldn't have to tip the restuarants should just pay them" are beyond ignorant and need to sit down. .  .maybe do some homework before you open your mouth? It really says a lot about you all 🤡
Are we supposed to feel bad that someone spent $1800 on.a bike? And then spent more on accessories that were unnecessary (phone holder) on the bike? Okay
Just Eats/Skip The Dishes/Grubhub: You get paid via the delivery fee and a tip. When you get tipped a large amount, they decrease the delivery fee you recieve so that the amount you make is the same
The right thing with the "enshittification cycle" is to abandon ship immediately when the rates go up and the service goes down.
It's hilarious you're pretending to care about workers AND promoting tipping culture at the same time. What the actual fuck are you doing
In India the menu has different pricing for delivery services than dine-in option. we typically pay 20-25% more.
explain to me how customers are ahead on this? Restaurants up the price to be able to make a profit. The delivery app adds additional charges. Where is the winfall?
17:26 I recon the 4th person died
They're pimps. Digital pimps.
It's insane to me that we had online delivery here in Turkey since, at least, 2002.
Wait around😊
GRUBHUB has a freaking problem.
Watched the UFO episode yesterday……honestly John, I wish you folks never did that episode. It was sloppy, it was severely lacking, it felt like it was haphazardly researched, and fell flat as an opportunity missed. Probably the worst episode I’ve ever seen of this show since day 1. I hope you can go back, take your time, and do justice to the topic bc your show is usually outstandingly insightful and the ufo episode was gosh-awful.
"trigger warning for anyone under 30, you make a PHONE CALL--" look he's not wrong but!!!
Everything’s randomized. No customer preference. Too many scabs. Good delivery drivers have to prove themselves every time even after thousands of deliveries. They make changes to app to accommodate their worst drivers/customers. It’s a pyramid/Ponzi scheme. Where’s the Better Business Bureau? Either incompetent or part of the corruption.
I get that there are a small few who rely on food delivery services (my elderly mother included), but I can't help but to judge fully capable people for using one out of laziness, especially when you could pick it up faster and cheaper yourself
I drove for DoorDash for a while and they do not give a shit about drivers. I paid for my own gas and maitanance. They, in a bit of gratitude, did not tell me how many miles I drove for a deductible until March.  Also, on a related note, Google "Uber Lyft Minneapolis"
On the other side, if restaurants continue to minimize portions and increasing meal costs ... they actually CAN go out of business.  I'll just keep getting in the car and picking up my own take out from the restaurants I WILL do business with.
I used to deliver with those apps. Customers would leave a shitty feedback if you were late bc of traffic. The wear and tear on my car resulted in huge car repair bills. the cost of gas ate into my earnings significantly. I often didn't get tips for delivering one single item many miles away even if on time or early. You'd get a negative review for the quality of the food that you had no responsibility for. You'd get booted from an app and there was no explanation or recourse. Delivering with these apps is a racket.
The american tipping system sounds so wild to me. In my country the employers are the ones responsible for paying wages. We also include tax in the cost instead of calculating it when you pay. It's so much simpler.
I don't understand why people don't just stop using those stupid apps that only perpetuate the gig economy.
One problem not addressed in this video is the restaurant owners themselves.  When they sign up for these delivery services, they get a huge boost in the amount of customers they have.  Very few restaurants hire more cooks.  It gets to the point where the people eating in the restaurant wait longer because they are being bumped back for the delivery orders.  No such thing as free money.
Restraunts are one of the biggest violators of workers rights. How does it feel to be taken advantage of the way they exploit their dishwashers, cooks and waitresses/ waiters. They routinely dont pay minimum wage, doc employees tips, and take advantage of immigrants. They can miss me with that “im the victim” b.s.
Government needs to regulate this. The middle men shouldn’t be making more like wtf.
tipping is whack
That person who ordered cake almost certainly didn't realize how far away the place was.  It's not obvious.
Another story full of lies and misinformation.  Does this show even do research?
What if John Oliver made the next piece on neo slavery in the US ?
ONE ERROR: "companies arent making money." Well, they are just pouring all the money into new ventures. So gaining value.
Throughout all of John Oliver’s videos about what he and his team uncovers, it’s always the same root : greed
Oh. I still order directly to the restaurant by phone. N i'm an introvert. It's difficult for me....as in i end up sounding retarded. But apps don't work that well over here. They charge extra.
The other problem with ratings are the way that negative reviews are weighted much more heavily than positive reviews.
SMFAHA: Start making food at home again. I used to order dinner almost daily as I worked evenings. Frequently had tummy upsets and realized it wasn't worth it. Now prepare all three meals at home daily and only eat out very occasionally, and at reputable family owned restaurants. I also generously tip the waiter and sometimes the doorman. Young people can easily learn to cook via YouTube videos. Once you get the hang of it, cooking is fun and even therapeutic. My friends and family are now inspired to cook at home and eat out less. With increasing incidents of delivery workers and disgruntled restaurant staff spitting in the food, people need to be careful about where they order from. Please don't take a punt on your health. Remember - SMFAHA.
@Last Week Tonight, huge fan of your work @John Oliver. India has election this month , would love to see your take on it please. Hope to see an episode on it soon.
Grubhub was originally the danish website Justeat. The very unlikable man behind justeat designed it to charge the restaurants around 25-30% per meal. A lot of danish restaurants have stopped using justeat because of this.
John worships the devil
I made roughly 16k in 2023 from uber. I have bank statements tonprove that. Yet uber claims they paid me 25k and that i paid 9k for using the service?!   I did what was right by the irs and did my own math, and told the irs how much uber has given me in 2023.
Uber eats give me 1.50 - 2.50 per delivery. Doesnt matter how far i go. 85 percent of my income comes from the customers tip.
The whole of the U.S. Economy is based on tips?  Why not pay a proper wage from day one?   The Gig Economy (which is a rip off) wouldn't exist. Problem solved.  Best wishes from Bangkok.
RIP Skype
Never used a delivery app, never will.
Some people who order delivery are not stoned. They are disabled and old.
15% tip on top of a 20+% premium on every item on the menu and service/delivery fees? Yea.....ok.
I have never used one of these apps and I highly doubt I ever will. Then again, I have only bought one thing from Amazon and that was around 15 years ago.
Door dashers sure do act like consumers!  When they rolled up to the restaurant, took my order and shut off their tracker.  I’m guessing they consumed my order too
Are delivery people actually getting the tips or the companies are keeping the money for them? Crap! I get deliveries directly from the restaurant or I go there myself
Cook from scratch.  It doesn't take long if you know what you're doing, and you'll save a MESS of money and be healthier.
Thank you. I will continue my life without using these awful, crappy, no-good apps.
I’ve never used any of these delivery apps. I hardly do take-out. And if I do I go get it myself. Please provide more information about why I should despise these apps even more than I already do. 😉
Not to mention, Identity theft. Facts.😢
Here in NYC the delivery drivers (bike/car) drive reckless all the time. Order and time goals don’t give anyone a right to make the roads/side walks unsafe.   Tips aren’t guaranteed just like it’s not guaranteed I get my food. I had my food stolen so many times Uber stopped giving me refunds.   On at least 3 occasions a delivery driver tried to shake me down for cash tip, after already getting a tip on the app.   Customer service for these apps suck.  Needless to say I have no sympathy.
Not mentioned but equally bad behavior from these apps; Some impose TIME LIMITS for restaurants in preparing the food for pickup. Which sounds reasonable until you understand that those time limits can be LESS THAN IS REQUIRED TO PROPERLY COOK THE FOOD. So restaurants are left with a no-win scenario - either prepare the food properly, risking stiff monetary penalties from the app and possibly screwing the drivers because it slows them down - or send out improperly cooked food, risking food poisoning, and risk fines from regulatory agencies as well as bad reviews.
janelle sallenave hasn't worked for Uber in over 5 years...how old is that PBS piece at 19:30 ?
also it's absolutely wild that uber has had multiple incidents of dangerous drivers or riders kidnapping or assaulting people yet not being booted from the platform, but a couple of reviews from a karen about delivery speed can cost someone their ubereats job. how is that proportionate?
Corporations that cannot make a profit somehow can find tens of millions to lobby the government to get legislation that suits them. That lobbying alone should be infuriating since it is supposed to be government of the people, by the people and for the people, but since "corporations are people" according to the Supreme Court maybe that is the way they "vote" instead of going to the ballot box where they would lose
"play both sides" and not "play devil's advocate"?? for shame haha
wtf? i thought when these apps were charging me 40-50% in fees it was because i was carrying that cost as the consumer. you're telling me they charge the restaurant side too?? that's outrageous!! that's highway robbery omg
7Eleven employees are told to give people random shit if we're out of what you ordered on doordash because 1 missing item causes a conference call.
While yes I would say that the Devil's part in that song is better than Jhonny's it's more due to the fact that he is being hard carried by the band of other devils, the guitar alone kicks in harder than the devils fiddle playing, which has weird scratching to it, the bet was if the devil was a better fiddle player, and he is most certainly not. Now if the Devil had said "I bet I could put on a better show than you." I have no doubt that Johnny's soul would be burning in hot tar like it fucking disserves because fiddles are dumb.
"Basically, if you're rating anything less than 5 stars there has to be visible semen in your food!" LMAO
Ironic for a restaurant to call deliver apps a leech when the entire restaurant industry is an expendable leech. Leeching off people's laziness gluttony and propensity for addiction. I haven't been to a restaurant in years and let me tell you it's great not literally pissing away money to have the privilege of driving somewhere to be surrounded by a bunch of fat smelly other people stuffing their faces and stinking up the restaurant with their farts and BO for you to have a painstakingly specific communication with someone you've never met before, then you proceed to get to sit there being bored and awkward for an indefinite period of time surrounded by strangers in an unfamiliar environment just for you to be served something you didn't order and charged 5 times the price it would cost you to buy the raw ingredients from the grocery store, and on top of all that you get to be obligated to actually pay the pretend-temporary-slave person... err "waiter".... a wage so they can actually live on instead of the restaurant owner actually agreeing to pay them an appropriate wage
John has gone down hill this season... idk why
In my experience working for these garbage apps, half the money I made went to gas and car repairs. No longer subjecting myself to it.
13:20  my literal reaction *head shake no* “what. The. Fuck. Did. He. Just. Say?”
How about, if there's a flood, don't log on to work as a delivery driver
Cold Food Late For More should be the real app name.
They prey on people who are strapped for cash which is most of us , Have too travel too a populated area that offers the service ,  Went back too real work least I know what I’m getting paid every pay day
No
I don't do delivery at all anymore. I know some people need to because of mobility issues, etc, but for me, it's just not worth the extra cost.
Cory Doctorow uses the term “shitification.”
I can enjoy harry potter fine cause I know how to separate the art from the artist y'all don't seem to have that ability and I'm sad for you
Doordash made 8 billions profit last year
Ive been working for Jeff Bezos AKA Amazon and I’ve been doing fine for the last three years as an independent contractor providing my own vehicle until last week that I hit a deer.  Party is over. Thank God nothing happened to me or anyone except for the deer. The damage is about 5K. I only have liability in my insurance policy. So there goes the net profit for the year.  You can’t be doing these jobs with a car that’s worth more than 7k unless you have full coverage. Lots of ppl hating on the gig economy but I actually like it. Im such a careful driver but the deer came out of nowhere.  I’ve driven 200k miles in the last three years with no problems till last Saturday 😢
Anti-trust, anti-trust and anti-trust. Where is the regulator?
Again with the horses, John!
Hard disagree on the tipping point. Its gotten egregious
Big Bird is not mentioned to be used for that type of commercial. That feels horrible.
😢poor delivery guys in China
John Oliver I love you, go Mann City. 😂
Jesus is Lord. Put your faith in him to ensure eternal life
I've never used a delivery app before. Never had food delivered in general
Someone pls incentivise the tip culture across the world (just for the delivery service). PLEASE JUST TIP anything even the 10 cents add up for a triple cheeseburger
Can´t spell millenial without 3 massive L´s. Sad but true
The person in the audience going “hWHAT?!” sent me
A driver told me he delivered a single cupcake. Was tipped $50. Thought they must be amazing. Bought some. Just cupcakes. 😊
I have deleted all delivery apps because of credit card debt. When I did order, I would only tip on delivery charge though. $5 delivery? 100% tip no worries. $40 food ? I am not tipping on what the restaurant provided. I am tipping you directly on your service you are providing. Also, I would always give good reviews even if delivery was only so so
Bottom line is with Uber, Lyft, door dash, grub hub, etc… you’re paying them (corporations) to work for them. Might as well throw your life away. I don’t know anyone who has worked these jobs ever get ahead. Another modern day slavery scam and ppl like Jim Cramer republican billionaires love it!
I rarely use them...they become so expensive
Here in Canada our sidewalks are a death trap for elderly and new mothers caused byforeigners with turbans riding scooter on them.  All are here as "international students"  who shouldn't be working in the first place and let me ask you this,  DO YOU THINK ANY OF THEM ARE PAYING TAXES ON WHAT THEY MAKE?  I'm sick of my country allowing record immigration for what?  People who are too lazy to go to McDonald's?
First time I dont agree with John Oliver on something. So about tipping.... you should instead push companies/businesses to provide these workers the fair pay and benefit. That responsibility should not be redirected/forced upon customers. Tipping culture has its major flaws too like encouraging these things on businesses to not pay as much because they will rely on tipping too. And lastly with all the cost rising and inflation, just like the delivery workers are struggling, so are a lot of people who would be their customers. Everyone is trying to save every single cent nowadays so you can see why they don't tip. If the tipping culture exists, I think it should exist only for wealthy and high class people.
No, you don't have to tip. You need to boycott the app and call your representative to tell them about this issue.
It would be really interesting to see last week tonight make a video on electric vehicles.
Didn't know Kiryu worked for Doordash for a while.
If I used these apps I'd tip solidly because I'd want them to be more fairly rewarded for their productive service,  but the only way to solve this is with political power.   Don't expect Democrats to help on that front because 90% of them take bribes, I mean donations from these vampires.  Either we remove the cancer from the Labour and Democratic parties that is pay to play politics, or it will only get worse from here on out.   On the bright side we greatly outnumber these corporate sellouts and vampires but unless we start to take federal and state power back at the PARTY level by winning primaries against  all these "moderate" liberals, they will do what they do:  Block all progress in route to the far-right taking power.
Ive never tried a food app woo hoo
Goddamnit I'm taking the bait.  "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" is not about who can play the most complex composition!  That's what the Devil thinks he's doing, but he's *wrong.*  Johnny beats the Devil by understanding that the value of his culture's folk songs is greater than any flex of technical prowess.
Reminds me of the farmers getting worse quality chicks to raise as chicken as punishment for complaining
The delivery apps should be illegal.  There's alot more.    They have free will to do as they want.  I live in a bad area  where people order their food and get it   and then report you not delivered to get their free food.  Then doordash takes their side.     I had 750 dollars in my account when out of nowhere the deactivated my account and they stole my earnings  they kept what I had in my account    I never kept anyone's order  because that's the main thing that gets you deactivated but people find ways to  Still report you so that's why I was so upset. I was doing it for months thousands of deliveries  thousands of low pay orders thousands of no tip customers hundred thousand miles on my vehicle countless flat tires  two crashes  thousands of bad experiences at the restaurants from employees not acknowledging me to ignoring me being rude  one time I was there for 20 mins till they even said anything to me because they needed to clear the drive thru then they cleared and waited for more drive-thru customers to get there and took care of them like if I didn't even exist.  Then after all that I had to cancel and my rating went down    waiting for 20 30 40 mins for people's orders and them bugging about what's taking so long with their order being rude af then not tipping on a 4 or 5 dollar order that took me an hour to deliver.  Just overall shi**y  shady business      the app the restaurants the customers      but shot out to the maybe  ten percent of people that did treat me like a human being.  The cashiers that knew me already and greeted me and let me know my order was on its way or ready already and became my friends to the customers that tipped me and talked to me not mad and understanding about their orders being late or helping me find them just overall nice people that I was happy to serve them.  But the overall experience was so fd up  they basically used me my car and my desperate situation to make themselves money. While my car wore down and I had no other job or income then  stole my money from one day to the next left me with no money no  income and worst then when I started.  This should be illegal and the owners should be in jail
Ola closed up shop in our country cause they had to pay the same tax as everyone else.
Here in Vancouver where I live a local restaurant did away with tipping and instead paid their employees a higher wage. Unfortunately, the experiment didn’t last long because it turns out that people actually like tipping.
Actually I think the problem would be solved a lot faster if everyone decided not to tip
We're definitely not paying less here.  There's a huge mark-up on the food.  I could order directly from a restaurant, request a local courier company collect the order and it would not cost any more than using one of these delivery apps.  I also know from talking to some the delivery people that they have to work 16 hour days, 6 days a week to earn enough to make it worthwhile.  And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.  I'd say you should avoid using these apps unless you truly have a real need.  Just wanting some food late at night is not a real need.  Because ultimately these food delivery companies are parasites.
Isn't "grubhub" a grass-killing worm?
I think I am to poor to relate to this
I ordered through door dash and some others during covid ... but California passed some bills and the fees went WAY up ... I had to give up using it. I will order through Mels Diner's website on occassion to avoid the huge fees ... but they contract through door dash it seems. I never tip on the app ... I tip in cash. Lastly the minimum fast foot wage in California caused several pizza chains to fire all their own delivery drivers and are going with one of these food delivery companies it at all.
OMG that Postmates TOTALLY looks like a spoof ad from the Babylon Bee!!! I have no clue how satire news sites make a living when reality out satires satire!!!
No one is making money yet no one quits
17:56  As he cycles across a pedestrian crossing..
I love that I watch this, and then immediately get an ad to keep allowing apps to treat employees as contractors and not have to give them benefits in MA 😂
I think all these “gig” apps are contributing to the significant increase in speeding and red-light running we’ve seen since the pandemic. Of course it may be reducing drunk driving, which is great, but exchanging for a different danger. They need to be mandates to pay by the hour for all of the driving apps.
Who are your writers? Why is it intentional the constant 'we hate all Christians, savor these degrading insults of blasphemy and laugh my current audience!'. I was your audience, since the first season of this show. Now I am saying unironically: What the hell.
We are getting a service worth more than it's costs? I am going to call bullshit.  If I order $20 worth of Pizza from Pizza hut they are going to charge me $4 to get it delivered and I don't have to worry about that delivery driver stealing my food, spitting in it, eating part of it, or throwing it on my lawn and screaming at me for not tipping them BEFORE they complete the job.  If I order $20 worth of fast food burgers off Grubhub they will tell me it was really $26 worth of burgers because the menu is priced 30% higher in their app,. they will then charge me a $3 service fee, they will then also charge me a $4 delivery fee, and then it will be delivered by somebody that doesn't work for the burger joint, is underpaid, unsupervised, and feels entitled to being tipped before the job is done and in my experience, about a third of them will do some sketchy shit.
I got an order once from across town and I saw that the driver was sitting there waiting at the restaurant for a while. I think he thought I might be mad and tip less when he got there because he kept apologizing and looked stressed. I just felt bad that he had to wait there on my order. I tipped him extra cash in person and he looked so thankful.   I don’t like the way tipping culture has gotten here but I just can’t not tip people, especially if they’re getting treated like garbage.
In CT DoorDash technically pays above the minimum wage, but cheat the system by saying it's 15.75/16 per active hour. Meaning that you are only being paid when you are doing an order. So when you are waiting for another order, or have to make the 15/20 minute drive back into the zone you selected, you're not being paid a cent. So the only way you can actually make actually minimum hourly wage is to hope for respectable tips. Basically as a driver you can be getting screwed by both DD and the customers who don't tip/tip a dollar for a restaurant that they know is out of town
my 83 year old aunt used a delivery app to order Ben and Jerry's ice cream from 7-11 when she was baked.  So, that's a plus!
You're paying less than it cost. Not less than it worth.  You are over charged on top of the restaurant being charged. It doesn't cost lest than the traditional way.
I’m 62 and never used any of these apps, and I don’t plan to start.
Just boycott the apps
After a few months of covid food delivery, I put the kaibosh on app ordering. I am lucky to live in a big city where we can run down the street for groceries or takeout.
Prop 22 puts more money in driver's pockets. L.A drivers get a guaranteed $20 per hour. If they recall Prop 22 drivers lose $
John thing is sometimes this is their only income.  More elitist nonsense.   😂😂if i dont profit from it i will destroy it. Elites manifesto.
The car insurance aspect is definitely an issue too.
I have never used a delivery app or Uber or Lyft.  Not even once.  I'm kinda proud of that.
'The Oven' has left the chat.
I never used any of these nonsense apps because they ARE nonsense
I was hit by a Postmates driver while on bike. In hospital 2 weeks. Uber, Doordash, Postmates and Grubhub are not legally responsible for traffic injuries on others by the 'independant contractors'...BAD
1) Same old argument: who should pay the staff; business owner or customers? Didn’t we settle this? Didn’t we say business owners sholdn’t be dicks? 2) Why doesn’t John Oliver talk about the shitty algorithm that makes the carrier take two bridges to deliver a piece of cake? The matching algorithm sucks, not the person who puts in the order. 3) Whose responsibility is it when the apps don’t break even? THE FREAKING APPS!!! You know what happens if they try to charge more? People stop using them!!!! So it’s not the users fault; it’s the apps fault that they’re in a broken business! John Oliver didn’t use to sloppy and careless!
I hope these companies are sued into oblivion.  "Leech" is much too kind a term for them.
Interesting that you say the consumer is the winner in this… it costs approximately 50% more to use these apps where i live. Mistakes are frequent; missing items, wrong items, delivered to the wrong address. Etc. Getting refunds has become increasingly difficult, no doubt due to a large amount of fake complaints, but the service ultimately has gone down hill fast.
If you use these you're a sucker or a fool
Im not interested in using these delivery services.  From the rude bikers riding on sidewalks, to the large increase in cost, I prefer to support the restaurant in person. I never use these services.
I must be in the very small minority - I have never used any food delivery app. If I choose to have someone else make my food, I will go and have them serve it to me, clean the dishes, and I will pay my $ right to them.
Obviously they are going to switch to flying AI drones and all this effort to monopolize will be fruitful
I shattered my leg really severely last year, I needed surgery and both before and after the operation I had to spend 23 hrs a day horizontal and with my leg elevated. I live with my mother because rent here is atrocious but she still works and I can’t expect her to do my meal planning for me so delivery was really a life saver for me. My rule of thumb however is to figure out what you want first and then check to see if food places in the area have their own websites or call in to ask if they do delivery. It’s a bit more effort but in the long run it saves you money
You don't gotta fucking tip. You can get your ass outta the damn bed. Sick ppl have existed before Doordash. A single slice of cake for $20 never saved anyone's life.
OMG I've been saying be for years that the devil won in the devil went down to Georgia lmaooooi feel seen thanks John!!!
Few parts they skipped was tip baiting. To drivers with cars having orders cancel mid trip after driving 30mins then only getting 3$. Or customer making false claims to get free food while drivers suffer the fake claim
I remember when a side hustle carried a risk of jail. When a dap was a 👊
I did Uber Eats when I went back to school in 2017(in Toronto), and I was a bike messenger before. I was able to make *at least* $30/hr as a student, too. The wages and payouts got worse over the years, and it’s just gross to see what these massive companies have done to local businesses and workers.
Refusing orders too penalized when they said it wouldn’t on DoorDash
I drove a hybrid for DoorDash, and lost $! what a fng joke in my Area North Fl.
Tips should be called bids. At least Doordash finally started min wages plus tax.
I started using dash and now im a dasher myself and plan to uber soon.   I dont plan to keep doing it forever, i can't. Im lucky to be by a big city.
I have used delivery apps a few times and each time was a poor experience with the quality of the food (temperature mostly) and added fees. Pizza is the perfect delivery food - never had an issue ordering a pizza through an app that belongs to the pizza company.
Tipping should just be called a service tax. I don't even know who I'm actually tipping anymore.
Kind of losing touch when your solution is to push the price on to the average person, especially when you even noted the people who really benefit from this service is the disabled and working parents.
Food delivery apps are basically bloated bureaucracies for what could've been the delivery ordering method of looking at the paper menu and calling from a landline! 😱🤪🫠
Why are we being encouraged to tip? Shouldn't we be pushing for better wages from the companies?
This is such a stupid American thing.  You are running delivery business, and yet you are forcing costumes to pay tips to the delivery man out of pity?! Money for delivery should be in the final price when you deliver. Tips should be as special thanks to the worker. Same is in the restaurant,  you are forced pay tips because workers are not payed properly?! How idiotic this country is? 😂 You call America developed country,  when there slaves working for billionaires. You won't fintthat in any other civilised part of the world.
I'm a former Instacart shopper and I agree with the experts that this is not a remotely profitable business model, ever, even when they get to the jacking up prices stage. I actually think Instacart/grocery delivery has the best shot. Shopping for a grocery order does take longer than picking up takeout (and be aware that the person who delivers your Instacart order is the same person who shopped for it in the store in the vast majority of cases), but it also costs a lot more, meaning a percentage-based tip is much higher, and the customer will accept a higher delivery price. (I quit Instacart after they cut pay by about 50%, by the way.)   But consider traditional restaurant delivery: there's a reason we only ever saw it from a few types of restaurants who paid a delivery staff before. Most food does not travel well. Most food does not keep well, meaning both that it's hard to reheat leftovers and that after half an hour the quality has dropped significantly. Most menu items are one serving, meaning that whatever you're paying for delivery, you're getting a single meal out of it rather than multiple. Before apps, you pretty much saw delivery only with Asian foods (inclusive of both Chinese and Indian) and pizza. These foods are packed in boxes by default, so they can knock around a bag a little bit and be fine (slightly less true with pizza, which is why pizza delivery developed specialized bags for it). These foods don't suffer in quality in half an hour, and they're exceptionally easy to reheat in a microwave. A medium pizza can comfortably feed four people lunch, or one person dinner for a few days, and the same is generally true of a few dishes off a Chinese or Indian menu. But now, these apps expect to deliver an $8 cake slice, charge $7 for the delivery, pay the driver $2, and hope the customer will tip enough for a SINGLE SERVING OF DESSERT to bring that up to a fair wage for the driver's half hour of work.  The model is utterly insane, and has only lasted as long as it has because the companies have a nigh-endless supply of desperate people willing to work delivery because they can't find or sustain another job (an underestimated factor is that a lot of delivery gig workers are disabled and choose gig work because it allows them to work when they feel able, sit down most of the time, and not have to answer for when they're not working). In other words, it only works because they can suck the blood out of an underclass. This is the type of shit you find in YA dystopia novels, and no one even realizes they're the Capitol in this one.  P.S. Instacart was even an option for me because I live in Canada and don't need health benefits, but it's worth considering that hauling multiple 24- or 40-packs of bottled water to fourth-floor walkup apartments significantly worsened my existing carpal tunnel. It was relatively minor before delivery work and now my hands tingle and my wrists hurt all the time when the cortisone wears off. In Canada, I can go to the doctor and get an ultrasound and get cortisone shots without an issue, but if I'd had to do this in the US I'd be fucked now, because Instacart would NOT be paying me enough to pay rent and also pay thousands in medical bills. This is a two-income household btw. My advice if you're going to try gig delivery: do Amazon Flex. They've got an infrastructure in place and while the challenges are unique from other apps, they pay enough (especially on short-notice surge blocks) that you can at least cover your expenses and have something left. Also, get a trip-tracking app on your phone so you can take mileage off your taxes. It's worth paying a subscription fee if you can't find a free one, it brought my income down by nearly $8000 in the 7 months of last year I was delivering. Calculating the tax deduction by standard mileage rate is almost always going to get you a bigger deduction than tracking your actual expenses, and it's way easier. My actual expenses per kilometer are probably around 25 cents, while the CRA rate last year was 62.5 cents/km for the first 5000 km and 55 after that.
Have you considered the Fate of Cassandra? I realize you are not wrong in your views, but your humor isn't enough to overcome the downer you bring to us week to week . Please consider adding an occasional uplifting yet relevant story in the mix ,
This started off so wholesome…but we all know better than that right?
Re: Crossing Bridges, I can tell you what happened.  Doordash showed the restaurant was 0.7 miles away, ignoring the fact that the northside bridges aren't bike friendly, then dispatched a bike because their algorithm is awful.  Had something similar happen to me before, changed my tip from $3 (thought it was a 5-minute trip) to $15 after the guy showed up after 25 minutes of biking like a madman to bring me and my stoned cousin, no joke, two giant slices of cheesecake.
Sadly, this business model will only make money when AI (in autonomous vehicles and robotics) hits the next level. All these jobs will be eliminated
Wow. He's so amazing, a genius
I don’t use food delivery apps. It’s a matter of moral principals and  decency. I don’t support modern slavery.
I have epilepsy and can’t drive so delivery apps save me from having to walk 10 miles to the store and back carrying groceries on the side of the road. I know they are not ideal jobs or prices but they are essential for me living on my own.
Grubhub & doordash can eat the peanuts outta my shit!!!
Capitalists: "Capitalism is THE MOST efficient system we could possibly devise! Also Capitalists: "Our workers are are barely surviving and can't pay their bills. Oh, also we aren't making any money as a business despite being valued at billions of Dollars. And we don't know how to change that. Things are going great! 😁 "
The customer is the winner here? With exorbitant prices? Nobody is winning
The country has always depended on customers to subsidise wages for workers in hospitality,so employers pay employees less. We’ve been in bars where workers weren’t paid a wage at all. When we went in we were told workers depended on tips because they weren’t paid a wage. We’ve also been in a Pizza Hut in Florida which paid $2/ hour. ( about ten years ago).
If we had medicare for all they could at least get healthcare.
As a driver for these apps. I will say I like the fact that we aren’t employees. It gives me freedom and the ability to just decline orders I don’t want to do.
I used one app, the first 4 times I used the different apps.  My order was never correct, those three times.  I have used other apps since and I must say that rolling back protection for the workers is fine with me, the consumer because out of the many times I have used different apps I remember my order being right 3 times.  I was given my money back a bunch of times by the company as they still paid the app for delivering food even though the order was wrong, when it was given to me.  Many of the apps or the delivery drivers in my opinion rip off the customer.  I have no sympathy for these companies nor the delivery drivers they use.
I'm really disappointed they didn't bring up tip allocation or how much they charge the customer for using the app but how little the driver gets.
how about we remove the tipping option all together and build it into the price of service?? why does the driver's wage have to depend on your mood when you received food that was undercooked??
Food delivery apps and the gig economy are bullshit. I have and will never use a food delivery app. They can all go to hell, the greed is out of control. The workers are getting screwed, hard. Boo to delivery apps and their tech bro founders. 🇨🇦🇨🇦
Imagine being dependent on these apps because you don't know how to cook.
This is why I stopped using delivery apps 3 years ago and instead started calling the restaurants for pick-up orders. Not only do the restaurants I like makes a better margins and can stay in business, but also it takes me less time to drive to the restaurant, grab my food and come back home than it takes with the delivery app. So I encourage my restaurant, pay less, have hot food, eat earlier and all it cost me was a 15-20 minutes drive.
Never ordered food online in my life, nor in any other fashion imaginable, always been a little less lazy than that. And seeing others around me so casually participating in this has gone a long way to fueling my misanthropy, and yes I hate all of you who have ordered food in this fashion. It's just how our relationship will start off and it's not my fault hehe
John, you said it again "you have to tip". So I'll say it again. Refuse to tip, be the change you want in the world.
Do not tip😊
when the restaurant still got their own delivery service i go with it.  before door dash and other stuff like that,  we used the taxi
i know some do the gig economy as drivers YET drive big trucks with high gas prices per tank. they know they are losing money but they are lonely people that like to put themselves out there. kind of like people that pay for OF. They know its a scam but they do it because they have no other options to socialize even if its with a guy pretending to be a model. Its a very sad Blade Runner existence for some.  Also don't say tip more because these companies just pocket the tip at the head and then they give the dasher or grubhub employee, the option of taking the pay before the driver accepts the order. there is no follow through tip. that is FALSE. Tipping is an American thing. It doesnt improve service, just travel anywhere around the world. the tipping culture has actualy destroyed service as everyone expects a big tip. Companies need to pay workers a fair wage not give more money to companies that pretend tips go to the workers in the gig economY. I can confirm, they DO NOT!  John and his team didnt do all their research. they could have easily tipped the same order at the same time with one order not being tipped WITH had two different drivers and i guarantee the pay option for the driver would have been the same. i have already tried this with a few friends ordering and working. its very easy as they hire you the same day. all you need is the bag but you can should fake that too with an online photo. you see nobody when you are hired, you are approved through the app with photos. that is it!  Just like the apps STEAL from the RESTAURANT, they also steal TIPS. What you dont think these morally bankrupt companies can do that lmao Just try the experiment if you want to waste your time like me.
Drivers are given a tight countdown to complete jobs, hence the rushing. Also- I heard that declining delivery jobs on the app when you’re listed as available affects your app status. So even if you personally taking a particular delivery doesn’t make sense (pick up or drop off is far- or the app says it takes a longer amount of time than you have- or you know it’s not a possible to complete the job in the timeframe permitted by the app- or it’s more costly to you than income received) declining delivery jobs is detrimental to your status on the app, therefore your income.  Above heard from a pissed off driver (also my brother), so grain of salt.
I have never used one of these services and after this show never will.
I refuse to believe that these services are losing money and charging less than it should cost. In Southeast Asia food apps have soooo much less fees than in America. When I was in America I was shocked at all the additional fees they add on. Here it's just the cost of the food and a small delivery fee. In the US there are multiple fees you pay.
This aint the time nor the place for this comment but where is? As someone whos worked out they are bisexual and always been a lil weird about it, even now. lgbtq culture really is off-putting. Im not sure who should care or why, but there feels to be a very uptight, gate kept sort of corps that wants people like me all in or to just go away.
I actually don't have to tip and I don't have to give anyone 5 stars for lousy service. It's not up to me to make their business model work or save their jobs.
Not one single person has mentioned the fact that take out food also creates an unnecessary amount of GARBAGE.  Even if some of it is now "biodegradable ".   And what about the extra gas consumption and energy used to charge the batteries on the e bikes?. I don't understand how people wring their hands about climate change and environmental degradation and then tip tap order- in food to be delivered to their door.   Unlike John, I would say you should not use delivery apps. Those apps were only generated because there is a market for them.  Have people forgotten how to cook simple meals?  Who is too busy to scramble an egg or put on some pasta ? North American warehouse size refrigerators have plenty of space for frozen pizza.  Will people starve if they don't have and exotic Asian meal ? I would bet only a fraction of orders are made by people with no other option. Better urban planning, where every neighbourhood had a decent grocery store and a few restaurants in walking distance would be a better way to go.
Bring back the delivery job direct by the restaurant
4:49  *trigger warning for anyone under 40 😂
Tipping culture is the worst thing about North America. Surprised to hear a Brit pushing so hard for it as opposed to fair wages from the employer
If you're able, try to order directly from the restaurant & pick up yourself. Many people can't, but those of us who can should try to pick up things on the way home, walk to a local business, & more. Pls don't forget to tip.
I think @bikingdc met Kevin outside a restaurant & helped him strap his walker to his bike. I hope Kevin is healing & doing better. ✌️
17:02 What if you live in a part of LA where those warnings are only for around a few inches of rain and you tip the driver extra? Also I never had bikers deliver, I didn't know they even did
Its kool that you can send soup to a friend across the country when theyre sick.
I dont believe they arent making money.  They are just spending money on themselves.
A pizza that cost $10 cost around $25 on an app….
$2, 13.4 mi.
Why do we Canadians get shafted for the release LWT? I checked literally like 2 days ago and there was no upload and now there's 4 going back a month.
Thank you, John for telling me that I have to tip a lot to have my food, that was taxed, upcharged, added a delivery fee to, and portion reduced compared to eating at the restaurant to make sure the person who decided to work for a soulless corporation that hates humans can come home happy. How about restaurants hiring their own delivery people,  like it used to be, and making sure the tip actually goes to the delivery person. There used to be a time when this was normal. I got to decide that eating cold pizza and not tipping because it was cold was me taking food away from employees of a billion dollar corporations. Nice to take away agency of people spending their hard earned money for a semblance of convenience. How quickly we forgot that a delivery person employed by the restaurant used to make good money delivering food because a corporation didn't take most of it from them
Lmaoo I can’t get over someone saying “What?!” At the post mates ad
22:55 I don't want to have to tip everyone everywhere all the time... Sick of tipping, just pay your workers
I can't believe the bottom line is "you HAVE to tip". Tipping is a shitty, unreliable system that benefits literally no one.
Was I not paying attention or did he not mention how horrendously expensive and stupid it is to constantly get take out over doing your own meals?
Add in the fact that many who drive don’t know the need a special car insurance endorsement.  It’s devastating to find out that if you’re in an accident your car can’t be fixed unless you come up with a $2500 deductible.  The drivers get “car insurance” but they can’t afford the deductible.
Food Delivery apps are for the wealthy and for the middle class who are bad with money. 24:41 You should absolutely not use them. Go to the goddamn restaurant and have some dinner for christ sake. Or make it yourself for much lesss money.
15:26 I used to make way more money before I got a 4 star review and lost priority. I had to quit instacart for reasons that I had 0 control of
12:52 WE AREN'T CHOOSING TO DO GIG WORK. FML. WE _HAVE_ TO DO GIG WORK
im not going to tip anyway
11:42 I mean there's a reason Lucifer has a golden fiddle in Hazbin Hotel musical number "Hell's Greatest Dad" (he even played a chord progression straight out of The Devil Went Down to Georgia, though it was from Johnny's fiddling, not Satan's (also Satan is canonically a different character in Hazbin (he rules the Wrath Ring) but giving it to Lucifer instead is hardly the only creative liberty Vizy took))
2:42 After Microsoft buying Skype and Discord replacing it, nothing happened to Skype. Skype had its day and that day was roughly five years ago. It's like asking "what happened to LiveJournal?" in the mid 2010s.
Watching on Max and I just have to say, did John forget about Bad Cop from The Lego Movie? A corrupt cop who worked for a corrupt corporate monarch that erased Good Cop? I mean come on
Soon this will be done with humanoid robots.
John’s poor thumbs by the end of each episode. You can see the indents from his finger nails.
I just had two consecutive GH orders of mine get delivered to the wrong house. Same street number. Wrong street. I dunno, dude. If the delivery apps get outlawed so be it. They’re all run by morons from the top down. Drivers were clueless and apathetic. Customer support is outsourced so you’re dealing with people who speak broken English. I did get refunds and a $10 credit, but I don’t know if I even want to use it now. I may delete them all from my phone. What a joke.
"Skype" still sounds like some Scottish word for crap or such to me.  And always has.
WHy is this from 2020 data? Uber has already turned profits now last 2 quarters
I never use delivery apps.  I get my ass in the car and pick up my own food.  Or if a restaurant gas their own drivers ill order for delivery.
According to Business Insider - “DoorDash's Tony Xu became the second-highest paid executive in 2020 with compensation valued at $414 million.” Not sure if Door Dash is on the list of not turning a profit yet, but gee, I WISH I could figure out why they aren’t making a profit yet, and why they pay SO little to the businesses and delivery people! I REALLY wish I could put my finger on the reason why! John, why didn’t you mention the compensation these companies CEO’s are raking in?
I think the fact tipping culture is basically the wage doesn't help. We don't tip in my country and we have a minimum living wage. We also have legal holidays 4 weeks a year and they add up if you never take them. So you can be like me and have 12 weeks of leave. And you get paid those if you leave. Also we have 10 sick days a year too. America is just backwards
As a delivery driver for DoorDash for necessity, I have to confess that's frustrating and humiliating. Why? Simple, frustrating because if you know how to basic accounting you'll realize that is a SCAM. YES! Take all the expenses (not only gas but insurance, health, taxes) you incurred and it left you peanuts and not the 17/20 $the hour plus the idle hours don't work and stay in the car and you're working for less than minimum wage. And this is humiliating. Finally asking for tips when there's no way to improve the service (depends on app, traffic and restaurant) is literally feeling a total looser. Finally you feel a partner in the scam when you know how much Costs people. This can be transferred to Uber eats and others. For those in the taxi business the issue is similar but not the place here.
The fact this material got so hung up on Grubhub, while there’s so many other no less popular delivery platforms seems too suggest there’s an ulterior motive here. They’re all equally bad!
The only delivery service I use is for pizza. It is an old school phone call to a fellow human being who then has a person that works for them deliver it. I then tip the delivery person at my discretion.
I always thought the devil’s fiddle part was better too! 😂
When I do routes (usps) in our downtown area I often deliver packages to front doors with food delivery that's been there for a day or more.  So I disagree with Oliver from what I've seen, most that use those apps are lazy and forgetful.
Government works with billionaires business to make laws that sound good for workers but really it is only made to close the entry to the industry.
So as an Etsy jewelry seller, should I be an IPO 😂
Here we go again blaming people that don't tip, when it's obviously the company that is keeping all the money, as clearly the main point of the video states.   I will not tip if I don't want to, and I will tip if I want to. I could tip 10 bucks if I feel generous, 1 dollar if that's all I have, in the end mind your own business. I paid for the item in full, plus their delivery fee, and the tip is a gratuitous gesture.
The costs of delivery apps to the restaurants were what finally pushed a chain restaurant I was employed with to go bankrupt during the pandemic.  The owners were hoping to stay afloat during lockdown and instead lost it all.
Maybe the restaurants should have used a couple of drivers they pay instead of grubhub...was that so hard to figure out?
"You need to tip"?   Whelp, this is the first time I've ever disagreed with John.  Tipping culture needs to end, not to be perpetuated.  Employers need to pay employees a liveable wage.
Door dash drivers still not tipped enough
I grew up in a town on Long Island with no fast food places hence no delivery. I now live in Arizona a few miles away from everyone and no one delivers. I suppose I could get food delivery but it feels so wrong like I dont have two broken legs so why cant I pick it up...or better yet make my own food with what I have at home. Even when I worked at night I never ordered anything except pizza delivery once in a while....Papa Johns....really gross pizza that guaranteed you would be in the bathroom half the night and puking up the other half. Two weeks ago I ordered it again and ended up in the ER...which was bad because I could not leave the bathroom for a looooong time. Its sure isnt NY pizza that I grew up on. I dont think I will every use an app to order food. I do order at walmart and pick stuff up but I load it myself and dont sit in the car vaping and listening to really bad music like the rude 30 and 40 somethings do.
All these Gig jobs are wage theft. The worker gets no labor protections, Healthcare or union protection. I drove for left and someone hit my SUV and kept driving, I had to pay for the repairs.
Back in 2004 when i was delivering,  there were already companies starting out as delivery companies that subcontracted out drivers to places like pizza joints and chineese food restaurants. This was figured out long ago but got supercharged lately
In all cases, Big Bird and other Sesame Street characters have no business being in advertisement. What a twisting for a free public educative program.
Have never used them, and never will.
Tried it once. Thank you to the driver who took a photo of my house and dropped off nothing. Thank you for forcing me to spend another hour demanding my money back instead of the credits.   I dont need to spend $45 everytime i want to order food. Now i have zero desire to use delivery apps. Im lucky.
I guess the delivery drivers are not part of the family, because despite the explosión in use, none of the profits has gone to pay us.
The delivery person brings both the capital (car, bike) and the labor (as an "independent contractor") to the restaurants.  The delivery corporation is like the guy outside the restaurant, touting it to passers-by -- and somehow the bum holding the sign is the most powerful?
That Tony Xu fella, is he in any way related to Zhang Yong Xu©™, the leader of the fictional Second Dawn organization? I'd like to think, Fuck Yeah.
I'm in civil service, which is good and bad at the same time.  Good - it's mostly a stable position with good health benefits.  Bad - I've been in the same position for nearly 20 years without a single opportunity to be promoted in my line of work (which I love) at my place of employment (positions were eliminated when the people in those higher positions retired).  Except for a very small cost of living raise once a year (of which, taxes are still taken out), I will never make more than I did 10 years ago, and daily living is expensive.  Yep, I'm currently looking for a couple side jobs to make ends meet, but it won't be as an Uber driver or a food delivery person.  Not because those positions are beneath me - they aren't - but for all the reasons John described.
It is because us is very low density
I remember in uni we were smoking weed in our friends bathroom and didn’t hear the knock/he came in without the buzzer, so the pizza man knocked on the bathroom door and ran back out 😂😭😭😭😭 They deserve a living wage.
There was a beloved sandwich shop here and they kept trying to get the owner to join skipthedishes. So he took to chasing the salespeople out with a broom.
So hired your own delivery drivers if your  a resturant
I much rather call restaurant and go pick up. Cut out these apps
DoorDash has deactivated my account for background checks just yesterday, that at the time was my only source of income while starting my new job. Their HR department is horrible they only know how to say they can’t do anything or we’ve sent your issue to our tech team but yet their GPS has been awful for years. DoorDash is a joke.
this can't be true, here in Quebec Canada, let's say you go to MC and a big mac  trio is 11.99, On Uber after the tip fee and extra charge it will cost you around 28$ how is that good for the customer???
Capitalism is so great and perfect system..
I love numbers being yelled at you by human squidward, it's my favourite!
Nothing was more heartbreaking when starting out doing deliveries than the realization of just how many people don’t tip. Where I live, tipping has always been the norm for these industries, so I’ve never not tipped. Was just shocking to see the lack of care from some people. Doesn’t matter how far they are, or how many hoops I have to jump through to drop it off, they’ll just smile and lie through their teeth when they say “thank you” (unless they just ask to leave it at the door and then refuse to open it before you drive away).  I don’t care how many people want to act like Steve Buscemi in Resevoir Dog’s. If you not tipping means the worker doesn’t even get enough to make minimum wage, then tip. Don’t be a dick, just tip.
As someone who is disabled, delivery has saved me many times from jyst not eating 😅 but i recognize the problems.
The canned laughter on this show is cringe.
The delivery companies want 30% of what we charge. That's our actual profit margin. So we passed.
Grub hub…. We are losing millions… also grub hub we paying executives $100+ an hour in our $80 million dollar headquarters…. We are bleeding money here 😂
Restaurant owners brought this upon themselves. I have a little sympathy for them but not much.
If you wanted to Really save your neighbourhood restaurant during the pandemic, you could have picked up your order at THEIR door.
How about the part where they funnel tips away from the restaurant
John Oliver. The most informative and well spoken baked as fuck human. 🙌🏼❤️
Just another example of how big tech makes life worse: the internet = porn and gambling, streaming = artists get no royalties, social media = rise in suicide. What will happen when AI starts changing the world. I miss TV that brought people together, phones that always worked, disconnecting from work, and album covers.
I like that you advocate for the devil. Depictions of the devil are usually the Northern Europeans that escaped Rome's grip-- people like my family that play music and avoid being enslaved by romans or their ideas. These days, with the abortion ban, those of us in solidarity against the Christians are getting more support.
Most of yall  on the tipping argument seem to be solely focused on wait staff/restaurants. What about places like coffee shops where youre not even sitting down being waited on... you're picking up your order right from the counter. And they have the audacity to include the options of "25%" "20%" "15%" on the screen.  Clearly many other businesses are taking advantage of it, where they already earn an above minimum wage salary. If youre wait staff earning $3.50 an hour, shouldmt u also be mad at these businesses? To me, they're f__king it up for you guys
DD is money drain.  Its electric bill money, not rent money.  One day I decided to get the Indeed app on my phone while waiting for a decent order.  After 18 months of dashing.   Told myself to apply to jobs without a cover letter, just push Apply.  Days where I was making $9 an hour were common in my area lately... It been terrible the last 6 months, but honestly, DD never paid me what I earned when I worked in an office (I was laid off couple years ago).    Within a week I started getting callbacks and a month later I landed a cushy $27 an hour job in an office.  DD isnt worth it...  Better to spend some time learning a skill for a side hustle.  DD is too much work...  I would sometimes need to work 10 hours for a measly $140, and need half a tank of gas and food for a long day.  AND pay taxes on earnings.
Choice is easy for me, being retired with low income, I can't afford to eat out at all and have never used any of those delivery services.
People who don't tip...fuck you.
What about Favor in Texas? This is an important factor- they have mastered this model. But if you mentioned them, you couldn’t whine about this with bad jokes for an hour. Why does this man’s research and delivery choices upset me so much? lol 😂 bc this is just entertainment- but don’t get your study tactics for debate team from this guy, kids….
Here In saudi they pay up to $1800 per month including housing insurance motorcycle safety kit and uniforms and people fly from across the globe for these jobs to feed their families yet these greedy us company claims they don’t earn profit?? And still operate for years likeRealllllly? So greedy amh
Restaurants should join hands and start an app of their own and hire delivery workers who are regular employees instead of depending on other app companies
Tips are supposed to be a bonus, not an income stream. Include group tips in the cost of service and stop nyenyaring customers.
Consumer is all it matters.  The restaurants don’t have to use the app and the driver doesn’t have to work there.  As long as the consumer gets the best service at the lowest cost possible, that’s just capitalism.
I have never used the aps. They screw over the restaurants and the delivery people. The restaurants have to participate as people don't want to leave the house. People are their own worst enemies.
I just googled min wage in USA and it said $7.25. That was how much I made at age 14 in 2005 in Canada at a fast food place. Our minimum wage is now $17.20 for the same job. I have no idea how anyone in the states survives especially without health coverage guaranteed. We have basic health coverage and higher wages yet we are all still struggling. How does anyone pay their bills there???
The devil is playing the long game. Johnny went around making a folk song where he boasts how he's so much better than the devil as a fiddle player. A most prideful act indeed. Do you really think Johnny is going to act humbly or respectfully after thinking he beat the devil in a contest fair and square? He surely does win by proclaiming the power of Christ, keeping kosher, or saying the shahadah as an affirmation of the soverntiy of the lord over evil. And now he has fame, and money in for form of a golden fiddle which he's convinced he won fair and square from the devil himself purely from his own skill. And he sure as heck isn't going to say Mash'Allah to avert the evil eye of jealousy. No my friend, Johnny was doomed the second he accepted the challenge from the Great Deceiver himself. He forgot his talents were gifts from the Almighty, and in doing so he has sealed his fate. As my friend in Georgia puts it, "the devil let him win the fiddle, and in accepting Johnny forfeited his soul".
How come when I look up Tony Xu's orphanage comment on Google, nothing appears?
We are a tipped out! Stagnant wages, rent is choking us, gas prices,groceries. Every single service provider from nail techs to Subway cashiers now want a tip. It’s untenable. Regular office workers get NOTHING but their regular salary. I avoid these apps,that’s all o can do 😢
Tbf skype didn't pop off because Microsoft gutted it for parts to use in MS Teams.
Door Dash, Uber Eats etc are all evil as fuck!   We stopped using delivery apps years ago because our local restaurants all told us how awful there are.  The best way to support your local restaurants is to do pick up, or dine in. And many are now going back to the old model.
This is so stupid, no one is forcing them to take that job
Dear God, the US is barbaric in some ways
Used to love my gig job. But at every turn the app was charging the customer  more and more, and paying me less, AND. Relying more and more on tips to fill the gapps the app was robbing both of us.
Stop tipping.
21:59 So this is great propoganda language being used here, but please dont believe these apps have EVER given you a deal. My coworker is addicted to uber eats, I used to sometimes get lunch with her so we could split the fees to save money. Last time i did, I ordered a meal from bourbon chicken that after tax, tips, fees and nonsense cost me 20$. The restaurant is a 5 min drive from my office, in person, I now buy that same meal for less than 13$ AND I get more, fresher food and better service from the nice workers there. So please, tell me where the deal is when I'm paying a 50% markup for an always sub-par meal experience, all to save only a 12 min round trip?
And this is why governments have to regulate.
Not to mention the impact these apps had on servers and chefs who suddenly had way more orders they weren’t getting any tips on. Or the unsafe driving encouraged by these apps. It sucks all around.
A breakdown of that financial statement from GrubHub to the restaurant guy; Total $$$ of orders = 16,208.96$. Commission = 3062.20$. Delivery Commission = 1477.95$. Withheld Tax = 822.74$. Processing Fee = 495.52$. Promotions = 3563.11$.         After whatever those other few bits for adjustments or wtv are, what was left was 6857.97$.       So how in the actual fuck does it make sense for a DELIVERY APP to charge both a commission AND a delivery commission? Who the hell orders from a delivery app then goes to pick it up themselves?!?
From where I am (where not tipping isn't a faux pas) delivery apps have a service fee, plus the establishment has a "processing fee" on top of the price of the food. Delivery riders are employed by the delivery provider, but we can still tip or add food for the rider if we want to. The food will cost almost twice it should but this system is pretty stable. The American tipping culture is so weird.
People still don’t get it. The person who delivers your food isn’t an employee! They are an independent contractor! Meaning they work for themselves. The tip you give them is their wage. The amount these companies offer for the driver to accept a delivery is basically the cost of gas to deliver your order. They don’t get any of the fees you pay unlike employees of pizza places that get half or all of the delivery fee. So the tip is vital because honest most deliveries only pay the driver $3-4, which as I said will barely cover the gas in their own vehicle to deliver your order.
These apps are a scammers playground I blocked so many unsolicited GrubHub texts claiming they had food for me
I don't know about anywhere else in the country but without delivery there would have been a lot of wealthy people not eating.
Never used one, never will.     I don’t want some insufferable millennial messing around with my food for tik tok views.
These "part time" gigs have become scams most of the time. I was using an app for side hustle in London and now they charge 20% of the salary in "fees". Another cleaning gig agency steals most of the salary and since the work is extremely hard and stressfull, it's shameful how they take advantage of naive workers who fall into these scams. It's actually a serious issue because many people think they are doing good money this way. I stopped using them because the time and work I put in is too much for the pay they give out.
So so so so so much less than minimum wage! .....
I deliver for Uber eats and my main issue is how inconsistent the app is. One day I’ll have constant orders, the next I get nothing all because a customer left a bad review for something that really isn’t my fault. If the restaurant made your order wrong take it out in them, not on me.   Also some customers are straight up clueless. They say “meet at door” then get annoyed when I actually text and call them to let them know that I’ve arrived, and then proceed to leave me a bad review. Some just don’t answer and I’ll have to leave it at their door anyway and risk their food getting stolen.   Or I’ll do a grocery delivery with something fragile like eggs while their house on a bumpy dirt road, then get annoyed at me that one of their eggs broke. I’m only doing this because I applied to like 10 jobs and none hired me, but if I could get a regular job to get me through the semester I would in a heartbeat.
That proposition in california was *infuriating* to vote on.  The on-the-balot description of what the balot was was immensely confusing, and I'm pretty sure a good chunk of folks accidentally voted against what they actually wanted.
I've been spending soooo much money on food delivery for the past few months. I'm finally just starting to buy more groceries.... What I hate the most is that when you order food off these websites and these apps, the one price you can adjust (besides editing the actual food/drinks/items you order) are the COURIRER TIPS. Basically telling you that, yeah, you can get the meal a little cheaper, all you have to do is pay the hardworking person who really needs the money in this situation LESS MONEY. As opposed to the RESTAURANT and the APP, that will get the bulk of it!!!
John Oliver fucking animals is my favorite running joke ...is joke the right word?
The guy who was hit by a car, wouldn't the drivers insurance pay for his lost wages etc?
Laziness should cost an arm and a leg. And thanks to subscription culture, it does.
Ahh, the scourge of the “independent contract”. Employee rights are finally eroded enough, that employers can download business related expenses onto their employees. We have reached the promised land.
I walk you restaurants with my human legs to walk and pick up the food I order myself. These things are great. You just get them for free when you're  born, and they'll  take you wherever you want.🤣
on door dash the tip goes the the dasher, so there's no way to tip the restaurants :-(
So glad you're talking about this John. This audience needs to hear it. BTW: tip the delivery person in cash, not in the app. These apps often include the tip in calculating the required minimum wage. Tipping in cash means the delivery person gets it all.
These food delivery businesses are a good model for co-ops. Break the big ones up to smaller companies owned by the employees for certain areas and regions.
Door dash share is 126 dollars today.... doesn't seem like they are losing money to me.
I just gave a Doordash guy named Sergio a $100 tip in cash *because of this video.*

Get over the tipping culture
I stopped ordering delivery food a few years ago. Most of the time it's disappointing on so many levels
There are a lot of benefits running as a 1099 worker as they can write off their car, clothes, cell phone, etc. if it was truly a side gig. I found the video to conflate 1099 work with W2 responsibilities. If a person I contract gets injured, I’m not paying their medical bills. If it’s “so bad” restaurants wouldn’t sign up and either would drivers.
No mention of the song "The devil went to Jamaica"?
I never tip in the app, I always hand them the money in person. Never gonna forget when I asked a guy if they even get the tip from the app and he just gave a tight smile and said "half the time no".
I can't eat two slices of cake in a single sitting and it's just not as good the next day.
Our insane tipping culture has embolden these greedy tech companies to pass on not just the cost but the guilt of paying their own workers onto us; workers that literally run their entire platform. What a scam
the nice thing about living rural, delivery apps are not relevant at all😂
That orphanage joke hit too close to home. Lmao
GRUBHUB is like IRS... taking most of your earning
I'm sorry but I don't believe these companies aren't making money.   Whenever you order anything and ask for delivery, your food order costs doubled of what it would be if you were at the restaurant.  I had a couple of seriously messed up orders with Skip The Dishes and will NEVER use any of those services again. I'd rather starve to death than use their shitty services.
It's more than just tipping culture, though that doesn't help. I used to run a non profit transportation company, and transport as a business is a lot more expensive than we realize. When I drove for Uber, it was easy to put 200-300 miles on my car per day. That is an oil change every month, not to mention all the other maintenance, which you can't skip because your car is essential to your income. So that means you need at least $30/hr to make an actual living, and the algorithms try to incentivize a larger fleet rather than a focused one. So the more you drive, the less frequently you get trips, which means you are available but not getting paid, and your average wage goes down. I do think there could be a path forward to profitability, but not with a goal of infinite growth stonks always go up. It will require a workforce of professional drivers who aren't subsidizing app companies with their vehicles, and higher prices than we might expect.
at some point there could be a major collapse. many delivery apps in europe went under when regulations were tightened, like forcing the companies to classify their drivers as full employees.
All lives are precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: "For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16) God is just so because we broke his moral law by doing wrong against Him, ourselves and others, His punishment for sin is the death penalty. However He is also merciful which is why He gave Himself in human form (Jesus) to die for us, and take away our sins if we repent and believe in Him. If we do, our debt or bail is paid and we can go free. God is also merciful for those who have never heard the gospel and will judge them by their conscience, actions and belief in Him from evidence of creation.
More expensive and only take credit cards.
Corporate America screws the workers again. Don't use these apps.
I feel those three Ls in my generational name John. I feel them.
BRAVO! Now, let's see round 2 covering grocery delivery and package delivery gig app that are barely paying people the cost of delivery for orders that, in times past, would have required the shipper to hire a freight broker. Example: Walmart sending out 500-1000 lbs of bottled water for $7 to a stoner in a subaru.

Just to have my $30 Taco Bell order delivered to my door is $70  Honestly what hell dimension did we fall into where this simple service of delivery cost $30
12:09 Johnny was objectively better. He and the devil were to have a 1 on 1, but the devil brought in a backup band. He forfeited the match at that point Mr. Oliver.. 🤷
"If you live in New York check to be sure you're still tipping people.." Well if it's not a sure thing they'll get it through the app just tip in cash once it's delivered instead...
I have never wanted to use one of these apps. Would much rather go and pick it up myself, save a bunch of money, pay the restaurant their proper fee (instead of Uber taking 30%) get my food quicker and fresher, and not exploit some poor sod on a bicycle.
I got hooked into the apps with choice during covid but I am so glad I am back to enjoying trying cooking things from scratch, so much more joy.
Maybe we should focus on the fact that US tipping culture has incentivised places to pay a lower wage for the food service workers.
late imperial capitalism in all its glory.  as with all empires these faux million- and billionaires are sowing the seeds of their own destruction.  they just don't know it yet.
First you need to Vote for President Trump- the only True American first President...  The only one Fightin to bless American Families with more unwanted babies 👶
I will say, I've never gotten skip the dishes more than I have while high as a kite XD I didn't see skip the dishes mentioned and it's the only one I use?
I agree with everything except tipping; the more you tip, the more money the company is getting away without paying their drivers more. Tipping is a Bullshit outdated norm that should be replaced with higher wages. Fuck these companies that prey on tipping so they dont have to pay more!
These apps are not worth it for the customer. I can drive 5-10 minutes away and get my food for 6-8 dollars, the same thing on these apps cost me 24-27 dollars. I don’t feel this is worth it at all. I’d rather just make food at home or pick up food once in a while myself. The restaurant industry, food apps and tipping culture are all ridiculously not worth it.
How the he'll can they get away with charging the restaurant so much fees when the delivery service does nothing to prepare the food and that's what we are ultimately paying for.
Eliminating tip would get rid of a lot of social frictions, tensions, errors and many more related problems. Tip system is obsolete and toxic. Just increase the gig workers pay and observe a better world unfolding.
Benefits the consumer? ordering a simple Mcdonald Combo ends up costing like $25 with tip. its really only worth it when ordering alot for a party or something because ordering just one or two meals it will end up costing the same price as the meal in service fee, delivery fee and tip so youll essentially be paying an extra 100%
This show has gone so far left it's hard to watch
When I was a first and second year electrician apprentice I needed to make some extra money. I signed up for doordash and made less than minimum wage. I think I averaged $9 an hour. I put more than that in gas in my car.
Normally on board with you Oliver, but this make sure you tip stuff doesn't work. Tipping culture is so toxic and it needs to go. Just pay people. Charge me the amount that is fair to provide that service and I'm happy. Pre tipping and then getting consistently fucked in the transaction is not sustainable. I clicked on this video hoping that you were going to have a good take on how to fix this problem and this defeinitely was not that.
Listen, I agree with everything here except that Johnny didn't win the fiddle playing contest. The devil may be a better entertainer, but Johnny is the better fiddle player, which was the metric they were being judged by!
We need to stop tipping all together and service workers need to get proper wage.
capitalism is eating us alive
the little grin John makes when the running horse joke pops up is priceless.
I don't use an app to order food, mostly because I'd go broke as the diner/donor!
Best way to support local restaurants is call them directly and pay in cash
I do not personally use delivery apps. I will call the place I intend to pick up my own food up from, I will place an order on the restaurant's own page if it is available and pick up my order, or I will order directly from a place that has its own delivery drivers. I have friends that use these apps, I have friends that work for these apps, and I said it from day one it was a stupid idea the way it has been implemented. They did not listen to me a few years ago, now they see I was correct. And it won't get better for anyone in the end except the pieces of shit running the show.
We have entered The Resteraunt Wars as predicted by Demolition Man
My idle, alcoholic BIL (cellar dweller) who's  been caught drinking and driving twice in the last 6 yrs ... had a 40oz bottle of vodka delivered to the door 2 hrs ago...
If you want to support small businesses and delivery drivers phone the restaurant. If you go pick up your food the restaurant may offer a discount. If you do not tip the driver you are not screwing over the restaurant you are just being an asshole. The only winner is big money. Fuck them.
Restaurants still have phones.
Delivery drivers do not get paid an hourly wage.
Tipping is a sick system. People should be paid for work by their employers (or companies that hire them if they are not employers).
yo john i dont know why but your vids are takeing like 2 weeks to 2 months to show on your youtube page
Yeah, I don't use such services because I do not support tipping as a primary source of income for workers. Tipping is a terrible way to pay any worker. Properly negotiated wages ( hence the need for unions) is the way to properly set wages.
Dat's cra cra.
Kramer looked so coked out wowzers
I respectfully disagree when I say Do not Tip. F**k the tipping culture. Instead the workers should be compensated so that they don't need tips.
a restaurant also charges the customer for the space they occupy for a said amount of time. restaurant pays high rent at the most posh areas and offloads the rental cost to  the customers. when you order online, you dont really spend any time in the restaurant. also, the restaurant does not hire delivery guys... the future is ghost kitchens.. ghost kitchen just cooks foods, the delivery apps just deliver and the end customer eats at their own residence..
I worked for a company that is owned by the same parent as GrubHub, in Canada. They're called Skip the Dishes, and were legitimately one of the first of these kinds of apps.   Anyway, I started working for one in December 2018. When I first started, I had a pretty easy time. When I needed to contact someone at Skip, I could, my orders were valuable, the broker (Skip) wasn't taking a huge cut, and the restaurants were all pretty happy.  I stuck with them for a while because I actually did enjoy driving and being able to set my own schedule. I was making a living wage.   Then the pandemic hit. And at first it was great, until the rest of the world realized that this was a lucrative business and sign-ups for courier jobs went absolutely insane. This was already fairly normal around holiday seasons (people trying to buy Christmas stuff, or trying to save money for a summer vacation), but they just never stopped bringing more drivers in.   By the time I quit in 2023, my time spent working had nearly doubled while my wages were less than a quarter what they were when I started. My cut to the company was getting bigger. Customers were getting burnt out on tipping, and these brokers are making it quite clear that the tip is really what's paying the drivers. No one wants to be guilted in to paying someone money because the employer wont. It was fine during the pandemic, we were all in it together and people were super supportive. But that time has passed.  I mentioned that when I started, the broker was very easy to deal with. They had a phone number I could call and reach someone at any time. Then suddenly they introduced a chat feature, which should tell you volumes about the company when they unilaterally decided that the best way for a courier to contact the company was by text message. I mean, that's an absolute farce. But fine, we could still call in. Until the pandemic hit, and suddenly they had FEWER employees and were no longer accepting phone calls, demanding everything be done after your shift. Basically, if you had a problem, they didn't care.  But it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. If I did have concerns about my account, or try to reach a "boss," they'd make me schedule a for days in the future, and god forbid your phone drops a call, because they will NOT call back and you have to start over. I one time needed to get some clarification on my account and it took nearly 2 weeks to speak to someone about it.   You can't even call the company any more, because they literally blocked the agents from having access to the information. It all must be chat (yes I keep saying this) or e-mail (which they quite literally never answer, and is regularly just patrolled by a bot that sends auto-replies based on keywords). Yes, I ABSOLUTELY had an algorithm for a boss.   The scorecard, by the way:  Company decreases pay, increases amount they take per order. Company starts increasing charges to restaurants, taking up to, according to one client, 38% of the gross sale per order. They feel they have no choice but to stay lest they completely go under because basically everywhere is seeing a very significant portion of their revenue from mobile ordering. Restaurants feel like they have no other choice but to be on these networks, often multiple (In Canada it's common to see Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Skip the Dishes terminals at most places).  Company lays people off during pandemic, makes it increasingly harder to get support (from a department called Courier Care, no less).  Company starts demanding customers pay more money. Customers won't pay, company won't pay, driver gets stiffed. Constant influx of more drivers, thinning the already thinning number of orders coming in as the world continues to open back up and "go back to normal."   Then it started getting dystopian. They'd start randomly pulling orders from you. Then they added a "feature" to keep track of us, which basically monitored our GPS for movement. We'd get a warning if we were stopped for too long, and a second warning meant they took the order. When they first added it, it wasn't tested and would trigger as soon as you accepted an order, or would trigger while you were driving (then requiring you to interact with your phone so you didn't lose money, another illegal distraction). If you complained to them about it, they'd tell you it's working perfectly.  Stopping for too long, by the way, also included red lights. 5-6 times a week, I'd be sitting at a red light on my way to get an order, and it'd be taken from me for not moving. Was the intention for me to run the red light too?  They forced an acceptance rate on us, where if we slipped under 80% order acceptance (over the last 10 orders), we'd actively lose money. Ostensibly it was to ensure we made more money, but it was more to deal with the fact that drivers stopped taking orders worth 1-2 dollars that would take 20-30 minutes to deliver. Under 80% meant you made less and were actively de-prioritized for orders.  Final score: I went from making $1200 a week to, if I was lucky, $200-250 a week. This was before gas, which was $75 a week (fuel efficient car and some hypermiling), before expenses, certainly before insurance. If I was lucky, I'd have $40-50 in my pocket for the week. My wife was shouldering the entire burden of the home while I desperately worked as many shifts as I could while trying to find a "real" job. Blow a tire (it happened)? They don't care, they just want to know if the order was delivered.  I was injured at a customers house, the company outright started hanging up on me because they were afraid I was going to file a compensation claim.  I was putting 50,000km on my car a year. That's at least 5 oil changes, all out of pocket.  I was putting at least $3k in maintenance in to my car a year.   End result: I'm broke, making technically negative money, while they post RECORD FUCKING REVENUE BABY  They call us independent contractors, but you have no actual choice in when you can work (they'd give you a schedule with 2-3 shifts on it, then you'd have to wake up at 7am to catch the free-for-all shifts they released every morning), we had no actual agency in what orders we took because of the punishment that came with it. We were legitimately employees in everything but name. The UK has already clarified that couriers are not independent contractors, and honestly, it's time for that to happen everywhere. They actively request that we break the law, by requiring us to look at our phones near constantly, even when driving.  Please, when drivers are bitchy about tips, THESE are the reasons. I know that from the outside looking in, we're just people who drive from place to place dropping off orders. But seriously, if you understood the stress and pressure they put you under just to try and make a living, you'd understand why. Is it the customers fault? Not really. I do think tipping is the tax you pay for not wanting to go out yourself, and I certainly have no problems tipping drivers (having been on the other side, obviously). But what none of us should be doing is offsetting the wage cost to these brokers. They run incredibly lean, and mostly only have to pay for infrastructure. EVERYTHING they do is about extracting every dollar from everyone involved in them, from the couriers, to the restaurants, to the customers. And they answer to literally no one.   I refuse to order from these apps any more. They're entirely set up to take advantage of their couriers, restaurants, and customers. I used to have solidarity with other drivers, but I want to see the whole fucking thing burn at this point.
If you tip someone before they serve you to entice them to serve you first, it's not a tip, it's a bid.
I don't understand comments here about "tipping". You focuse only on employer's part. Yes, employer's should pay more. But also if a costumer decides to order something from other part of the city in a blizzard, that costumer SHOULD tip extra! Just don't be assholes
You tip for good service. But when the driver is multi-apping. Delivering for more than 1 service... and picking up 3 orders and taking an extra 25 min to deliver. You wanna just say f*@k it.
Downward pressure on millennials and zoomers so that boomers and millenials at the top can have subsidized pad thai in a snow storm? The machine is broken.
My top really appreciates a clean bttm ❤
Grubhub calling their average order "an outlier" and hoping nobody would call them out on it.😂
My mom lost two to three card because of these inferno apps.
this is why i've resorted to just picking up the food myself despite my crippling social anxiety caused by the pandemic. since we have two electric cars to choose from in our household, it's def cheaper to pick up the food after placing an order online, and even then, ordering food from websites limits options (like wanting sliced bread over rolls when ordering a sandwich) unless you tell a human employee what you want/need in person.
Ah yes, I remember the pandemic times when you would be treated like a pariah for daring to shop at a grocery store and wanting to pay cash, only to be slapped with a $20 fee for using your bank card instead. That's why I use Doordash and my credit card so much. You don't like it, grocery store? Credit card fees cost too much, grocery store? FAFO, right?
Seems pretty clear this model doesn't work.
I never understood ordering takeout during a pandemic. Wouldn't preparing your own meals be better? Why would you want more people handling your meals?
TipCulture is mad in America!
Why do Americans keep glorifying tipping? Honest question.
I feel as though talking about the ways in which disabled people rely on delivery apps should’ve been more than just a brief mention. Some people may be immunocompromised and unable to go to stores safely, some people may have mobility problems that prevent them from traveling to and going into shops and restaurants they like, some people may be too crippled by depression to leave the house. The call should really be to non-disabled folks to temper their reliance on delivery apps instead of making generalizations.
Algorithm
Aside from freshman year in college, I've stubbornly never once gotten food delivered. If it's close enough for delivery, it's close enough for me to go there myself.
Never used these apps since college. Glad I haven’t. What POS companies.
This is my comment
Some of these apps are allegedly involved in obstruction of justice.
Uber driver here (Passengers). Can you please do a segment on how Uber and Lyft rob drivers out of 50-70% of their earnings?
19:50 wait, why is John Oliver's team taking their word at face value? Surely Hollywood accounting exists in other industries. Why would anyone trust these people when they say they aren't making money? Because of shareholders? What if this is was simply an accounting dodge and they're all in it. What do I know. Except that suddenly we're trusting them when they speak up (this time).
Yea man one of my employees, a millennial, did this almost daily. So i thought i would try, i found the process to be semi convenient, but very impersonal. the biggest issue i found was having to to pay a higher price for local restaurants, and the fact i felt obliged to provide a tip (yes i always tipped generously, i cant help it.) to the delivery person. Instead, I bought a razor scooter so never have to worry about finding parking in my city downtown. This way i get to enjoy local food, plus still getting the restaurant experience and tipping for the service i get. During covid, i ate allot of sandwiches i brought from home LOL.
12:42 this guy is out of touch with reality...people are working gig work to make ends meet, not because they want to start an orphanage
who still uses grubhub?
The main beneficiaries are the consumers. That’s kind of the point of capitalism
I always make sure to tip $0.10 for their hard work ❤
One of my best friends is disabled. She can't go out grocery shopping or just head over to McDonald's or whatever. So food delivery apps are literally the difference between eating or starving.
Orphamage i think he meant organic biz
Yes, I want to take advice from a guy talking into his phone
Woot 1:57 let's do this @JohnOliver! 🔥🌴☁
If these companies dont make any money, how do they afford a Superbowl ad?
Glad most of the people down here are getting to the root of the problem. It's not the food, it's not the platforms, and it's not the drivers or the food outlets. It's the fucking tipping. Honestly, it so heavily distorts everyone's sense of value that nobody has a fucking clue what anything in the service industry actually costs anymore. But the solution is not "remembering to tip", it's ending the labor-for-tips-in-place-of-a-fucking-hourly-pay system.
Keep preachin' John!
Still after all these years you have no fucking idea how to run a business. You are literally defrauding people for shares.
Props to the person who shrieked “WHAT” at the ridiculous ad suggesting that BDSM bottoms are supposed to starve themselves.
im a delivery driver and make 25-40 an hour.
When they pay higher wages for restaurant workers, the restaurants cry poverty and raise prices, something that they will do anyway.
As a DoorDash driver, I can tell this is more populist bullshit by a bunch of writers who have no actual experience in the space they're criticizing.  The bit with the guy and the electric bike was particularly stupid.  Why would you spend nearly $3000 on equipment for a delivery job?  If you don't have the tools, don't do the job.  Bad reviews barely have any affect on your DoorDash rating.    Delivery people getting stiffed on a tip sucks, but you know up front how much you're going to make and you get to decide if that's worth your time.  The guy with the broken foot was unfortunate, but it's not the company's fault.
I drive for DoorDash and one time I went to a restaurant that I think might have been listed against its owners' will.  They seemed really confused when I got there to pick it up.
@24:37 - "I am not saying you shouldn't use delivery apps."  That's exactly what you should be saying. You're spending 30 minutes pointing out what a predatory and terrible system this is, only to then encourage people to buy into it?   As Oliver himself pointed out, the old system works much, much better. Place an order by phone directly with the restaurant and bypass this ridiculous system that should go away. The right way to bring in apps to food delivery is to create an open-source app that all restaurants can use, but that simply functions as an extension of their business. They're responsible for the whole thing, and using the app is no different than using the phone- it's just a tool to reach the restaurant, not a middleman business leeching profits off your work.
I deleted every food delivery service from my phone and havent looked back.
Had a customer just order a cake slice & a milk. I frequently don't get any tips or get $1. It wasn't this bad a couple of years ago.   We have deliveries for stores like Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Pet Smart, Winn Dixie Apple Store, Sephora, etc. Some of those don't even allow the option to receive any tip. Pet smart orders say 'ineligible' in the spot a tip would normally show.  Of that $10+ the restaurant is not getting per order (for DD), the drivers only get 1/4 of it in my area. I can't get into driving with Grubhub because their waitlist is so long. I've been on it a really long time. Uber used to do promotions for their drivers that would make up for the regular crappy base pay, but they've essentially stopped in my area, not even offering them on holidays anymore.
I was with you right up until the end. Fuck tipping. It is way part time to end the creep of tipping culture in the US and just demand that everyone is paid at least minimum wage.
Techbros are so out of connection with humanity man..
The awful jokes and forced laughter make this otherwise interesting segment unwatchable
In India the food delivery apps now have the "data" on what/when people eat and started cloud kitchens and this  affected restaurants very much for which the sales are now dipping
Nope. No tips. Get a real job.
My friend died delivering for caviar on his bike. They didn't give any money towards the funeral because he was an independent contractor 💔
Fully agree about the devil’s song!  I have always said that the devil should have won that bet!
Fuck American tipping culture. You should tip because you want to, not because you are forced to or feel obligated to.
Skype is in MS Teams now which was used heavily in Covid
Delivery workers need to be paid living wages with health care, PTO, sick days, and every other benefit a job has in a regular brick and mortar.  Tipping is a creation of the aristocracy and it's just, sadly, persisted to this day as a way for the rich to feel superior and make others dependent on their charity.  We'd have no rich to treat us like garbage if we had appropriate minimum wages and effective taxes.  It is class warfare to suggest people who can just barely afford the luxury of food that is delivered to them are also somehow responsible for the financial well being of the person delivering it. The business is responsible, and they should be able to do it with the money they are making. If not they need to charge more, or pay their executives less.
That's your take? Really....
I used DoorDash maybe 2 since the pandemic. I refuse to be this lazy, this stoned, this “busy” with kids and life! I pick up my bottom and drive myself to a grocery store or a restaurant!!! Saved myself soooo much money too😊
People should boycott the crap out of these money embezzlement Apps
I get paid $2 by door dash to deliver food, no matter how long the restaurant takes or how much is ordered. So many people don't tip, or tip appropriately for what I'm doing to save them time and frustration. I get less than $20 normally for shopping orders, including those with 30+ items. I'm sure most people wouldn't think $5 is appropriate for them to take 30+ minutes to do something for someone else.
I mean if the job wasn't better than other jobs people wouldn't work it. If its such a bad job then don't do it.
yeah yeah - about tipping part i'm not sure - it just encoure ppl to support that system
to be fair - guy with the broken leg was biking on the sidewalk and about to bike on the red like for pedestrains... :P
17:14 thank you for your service 👍
Can you do an episode on TaskRabbit?
I've always agreed that the Devil is the better fiddler.
moral of the story, get off your butt and go get your food.  Or order from restaurants that have their own delivery drivers.
LOL to a british guy defending tipping culture. Fuck off with that. Yes food delivery apps are evil but don't defend tipping culture. Make the corportations pay, customers are NOT liable and should NOT pay for the way they mistreat and underpay workers.
if its up to john government would just run everything. love the show but jesus its the same show every time
If I can help it, and in most cases I can, I walk to the restaurant and grab my takeout. It’s good exercise, and I just can’t support terrible practices by these delivery companies
There's not much that I strongly disagree with John on, but I've really gotta challenge his opinion of tipping. Obviously there's an issue with tipping in general, but tipping on delivery apps isn't a tip at all. Actual tips are given after service is completed and the amount is based on the quality of the service. Delivery apps make you tip BEFORE your food is delivered. That is a bribe.   Not to mention the number of shit deliveries every person who has ever used these apps has experienced - no, I'm not tipping the asshole who called to tell me they would be slow because they were on a bike only to pull up after almost 90 minutes in a blacked out Charger to drop off someone else's order. Absolutely not. No tip. 0 stars. Don't be a piece of shit.
I drove for door dash for awhile.  Most reviews and people were great, however here are some negative reviews that I got:  2* My cold stone ice cream was melted when I ordered from 25 minutes away from my home  1* The store didn't have the drink that I wanted 1* Food not delivered (the store they ordered from was closed and I had to call and cancel their order) 1* I called to inform the person the machine was down and asked what they wanted instead, I gave that to them and then they gave me a bad rating because it wasn't what they originally wanted  When you factor in wear and tear on a vehicle, the inconsistencies in tipping, waiting around a restaurant because the order isn't ready, app mistakes causing a picked up order to be requested over and over it made it no longer worth it.  When factoring in those items, I was making less than $8/hr
Didn't Amazon buy Grubhub?  Because Prime members get Grubhub plus  for a year.
See if your city/town has a local courier service! I have been a bike messenger since I started college and local companies pay far better (however tip is still main source of income for riders) but the cost for delivery is often cheaper and mostly going to your rider/driver. It’s great, keeps money local, and gets distracted cars off the road!
Here are some hard to swallow pills for you fine woke people saying "rEsTauRants ShOulD pay a fAir wAge!"  1. You just don't want to tip, and have figured out a phony altruism angle to cover up the fact that you're broke or a cheapskate.  2. If you eliminate tipping, prices go up.  Money has to come from somewhere, and restaurants operate on thin margins--everyone knows this.  3. If you eliminate tipping, service goes down.  Service on average is terrible in non-tipping countries.  4. No good servers are going to work for $15-20/hr.  Good service is an integral part of the dining experience, unless you just want fast casual counter service places to replace everything else. 5. Many servers and bartenders make $30/hr plus right now under the current system.  If you make less, go work somewhere else.
Instead of talking about how inspiring employees are who work while injured because they've got to pay their bills, we should talk about how these employees are getting abused by a capitalist system
Literally listening to this while dashing.
Parents: teach your kids some basic dishes to cook.    Eg My kids & I love browned ground meat, steamed microwave vegetables (eg stir fry veggies, broccoli, mixed veggies, etc) , and a carb (eg instant mashed potatoes, pasta, rice).  Spice as you like (eg Lawry’s garlic salt, soy sauce, etc).  Eat in a bowl.  Save leftovers in Rubbermade square tupperwares for 2-4 days of 1-3 meals per day. 😋
Skype was bought by Microsoft years ago, and now it is MS Teams, which thousands of businesses use everyday. THAT’s where it went.
Tony Xu almost in the same breath says the workers value their time more but have side doordash as a side hustle.
"I would go five stars across the board"..? Really John..? "Across the board"..??? Somehow I sincerely doubt you'd be as "understanding" of "workers plight" if your food "mysteriously" disappeared even though your order was "finalized", only for you to check your door-cam and see that that "poor" worker brought the food, placed it beside your door, took a picture, took the food back, and f*cked-off.. or perhaps you'd be a bit "insulted" if you'd find that your drink is half-empty, and only two French fries remaining.. and I actually would pay to sea how you would react fining some "unknown" substance in your order that was delivered by some "rambunctious" teenager.. 😕whether you admit it or not, there are weirdos in ALL industries, so going "five starts across the board" is, in my opinion, counterproductive.. btw, I work as Bolt (something like EU Uber) driver, so I know a thing or two about the need for "positive" reviews.. but I've met some... "interesting" clients, and from what I heard there are quite a few drivers who, lets say, are FAR from a "five star" review..
DoorDash also bought Wolt in Europe, also losing money.
That Skype bit had me crying from laughter
Praised be John Oliver
you forgot that tipped wage workers typically serve the dashers and almost never split the tip.
I'm a bit late to the party for this one but I am a current dasher who works over in Arizona. I only do it because I am a full-time university student and with that and other reasons, I can't maintain a "real" part-time job. The first week of working for Doordash was great. I was getting a ton of orders that were all decent money. After that week ended I saw that I was no longer allowed to work in my city and had to go to a city about 30 minutes away from where I currently live. After completing a large amount of orders I became a gold rank dasher due to multiple factors and was able to work in my city and made decent money again. One day I kept getting orders which were outrageous like having to go six or seven miles for a single $2 order which I started declining. Because of this I lost the option to dash in my city because according to them my completion rate was "too low" even though it was 94 percent and now it is 93 because I was given an order that I had to complete in about 34 minutes when it would have taken me about an hour or so based on the different locations. I have been trying to earn my way back to my 95% completion rate like I was before but I need to complete 20 orders to get there when cancelling 2 orders made me lose it. Today I dashed for about an hour and received a single $2 order which because the restaurant was behind made me wait about 30 minutes. I have the option to work hourly after I get an order which gives you a bit more money but I only receive a single order once every hour or so making it worthless as I don't want to wait an hour to get about $5. Doordash is a complete scam and at this point I am just about done with it. I have over 660 orders completed with a favorable ranking. It's not worth it anymore.
It's hard to want to tip well on these stupid apps when they're ALREADY charging a delivery fee. I'll NEVER understand why that fee doesn't go to drivers. Delivery fee + the myriad of other endless fees making my meal double the cost. This is why I order from these apps maybe once or twice a year max. I hate it.   Also....Doordash is the absolute WORST of them. I don't know if i have EVER had a good experience ordering from them. Sometimes it's hours late food, being ghosted, half my order forgotten, you name it. I seriously hate them.
Or... they could just get paid a living wage for doing a job. Why keep pushing this tip culture onto Americans? I hate that. I always pick up my own food anyways but tip is still requested from me! So dumb.
If the need arises I still call a restaurant, speak to a person and pay the delivery guy in cash which works well every time, as it always has.
I stopped using food delivery apps several months ago. My wallet thanked me.
Tip is also the same I delivered a $350 order from a steakhouse to a beachside mega mansion on 4th of July, traffic took me 1.5 hours to get there and it took me another 1.5 just to get back in my order zone… no tip. I made $8.50 for three hours of work
Safety is huge. It taught me poor driving habits to make the unreasonable delivery times to not get negative ratings and it could have cost me my life in a huge crash
The model is wrong for the past someone would attempt to deliver your order if they weren’t robbed for the cash so the delivery boys are doing the robbery
Im curious about the orphanage side hustle 😅
People that dont tip delivery drivers are the same people that litter,  and think the world owes them something.  It doesn't and you're a douche.
I run a restaurant and offer our food on DoorDash. Our state capped the commission rate the apps could charge during COVID to 15%. However the restaurants could voluntarily signup for additional marketing packages and pay higher rates. We had nearly no sales on the app until we signed up for additional services. I actually tried to search for our restaurant on the app and was unable to find it BY NAME. I was unable to find us at all. We signed up for a couple of additional programs through introductory offers and have been able to increase sales and visibility. We had a dasher come to pick up an order a couple days ago who was only able to work because of the app. At the same time, it was also a little terrifying from a food safety standpoint to watch this guy walk away holding the bag of food in the same hand he was holding his urine bag...
Tipping culture is cancer. These companies should be treating these people as employees. 1099 , C2C, W2. Whatever. Companies are responsible for their employees' wealth.
a slice of cake being the single saddest order? nah, a slice of bread is. less than a dollar order. does not matter the distance either. it will not get cold anyway.
Is anyone aware of a clean version  these episodes?
If Billionaires would stop investing in these get-rich-quick scams and instead would pay their taxes, maybe things would be a little better.
Tip in cash.  That way the delivery person actually gets the tip
Once COVID restrictions were easing I went back to phone or using the website of the restaurants themselves and pick up my own take out.
How hard is it to make yourself some eggs and toast, cheese quesadilla, or a bowl of cereal? These people ordering food this way are also probably complaining about the cost of gas.
He forgot to talk that prices on those apps are higher screwing the customer over.
I wasn't paid as an employee as a delivery driver back then
The platforms might technically loose money but the ceos do make money.
Don’t forget to Tip in cash, otherwise apps steal that money too.
I mean if the tech bros stopped gouging the restaurant the workers and consumers they wouldn’t be able to pay themselves and bro friends seven figure salaries.
Im stuck in the early 2000s. So I have used delivery apps like once in the last 20years.
Mafia margins? No way, mafia would be much more generous knowing that if they took 50% of the profit the restaurant would go broke and then they'd make nothing. I'm not saying these apps do nothing and deserve no money... There's marketing costs, server costs, regulatory fees and such, but these apps don't deserve anywhere remotely close to 50% of the revenue, that's completely unsustainable. No wonder so many restaurants went broke after COVID.
That first ad was gay
Little protip from germany here, absolutely and ALWAYS tip your driver in cash, he will thank you and might even remember you. Always remember those stores who send the same drivers every time, and tip those in cash. Tons of stores or the apps themselves are late on payout of online-tips or just forget about it for months, screw that shit. Turns out circumventing all the cyberpunk dystopian bullshit the tech world throws at us excels at building actual human connections and humans, in stark contrast to algorithms, might remember a favour.
Instead of spending millions on lobbying to not pay workers just pay the workers. It's so backwards.
I've been Skype my whole life
why are there laughing sounds placed? Is this supposed to be funny?
I drive for Doordash, GrubHub and UberEats and they're all thieves! I'm in a delicate situation and have no choice but to use them. They work you so hard for so little money and use "tipping" as an excuse. Sadly, so many people can't or don't tip. It's a positive and negative😒
I got 4 tacos and a coke for $50 yesterday.... That's not what it cost?! That's with a $5 tip and the trip was probably about 4 miles.
John Oliver sucks lol
Most of the time in Denver I get below minimum wage with Uber and DoorDash once you factor in gas.  Something about them wanting you to drive 30 minutes and 10 miles across town for a few dollars feels like it should be illegal.
The door dash dude talking about an Orphanage was hilarious. Gotta love when the jokes write themselves. It feels like the "app for everything" era has made very few things better and just made an alternative to an already, usually better, system. You can thank a lot of food prices being jacked up around urban areas on these apps. Not just inflation.
People need to understand business costs before undertaking these gig jobs.   For instance what does turning your depreciation into cash mean?
There are only two types of people who use these apps and services; people with too much money and lazy idiots who don't know any better.
Has anyone noticed the risks bike messangers present to pedestrians? NYC sidewalks are overrun by electric bikes (heavy, fast, very dangerous), messangers riding opposite to traffic, syriking pedestrians who are looking for cars. The City has abandoned sidewalks to reckless riders and their employers (who seem to track and control every detail of messangers' activity, except obeying traffic laws.
A local restaurant told me how much GrubHub takes and I've never installed the app or used any of those services. That was two years ago.  Thanks John, for doing a story about this.
I wont get tired of saying this UNIONIZE!!!
So crazy i do not understand that maybe it is in USA think but i am German and i cook everyday or when i want too eat at a restaurant i go their too food, or with bike. And i personal for fewer eating out, more  cooking at home.
Restaurants had to raise their prices *in* the app in order to make a profit. I worked for one. During covid/ quarantine
They lose money because of the orders that don’t get picked up because the people aren’t tipping. Also, scam artist who lie that they are missing items or even never got the order.
tips are stupid, pay decent wage and charge customers for it. Or pay a decent base wage plus commissions on work done
Even Foodpanda had the same problems.
Look at India. Free deliveries up to 10km with a small subscription fees, no tips (optional), 10m grocery deliveries. Uber eats could not match the competition and left! Customers are enjoying while restaurants pay for most of the delivery charges. Wish to know views
Uber Eats is the sponsor for the French Ligue 1 football league. damn.
there is no need to.tip
Yes because that $30 grilled cheese should actually cost $35, because you know, tipping lol
Y’all should look into the predatory contracts used in ghost kitchens, especially CloudKitchens or City Storage Systems. My understanding is that the person who set up CK was an ex-Uber exec and he took his shitty model and applied it directly to local businesses that needed a physical space for health inspections but couldn’t afford a brick and mortar. Truly the slums of the food industry. It’s sickening
If you're making someone cross 2 bridged with your food, whether it's a single piece of cake or an entire banquet, if you aren't tipping them $100 you're a jerk.
Nope. I will never tip. Tell the company to pay their workers more. But you won't, John, becuz you're a capitalist shill.
I drove 20 miles to deliver a single Mcdonalds cheeseburger to a 3.5-million-dollar house.
I've had a number of people only order a fountain soda.
All these apps are the same.  I lost a pretty new car because of an ignorant Cleveland hoodrat that ran a stop sign, and fled, cops still haven’t picked him up on his warrant.  Anyways, Uber made up some bullshit that because I didn’t have collision coverage on my personal policy, they would not be covering the damage as their coverage only mirrors what I have. I did have uninsured motorist where as long as you have the other parties information, they reimburse you and just go after the other driver.  When I told them that I have uninsured motorist on my personal policy they said “sorry we don’t offer uninsured motorist.”  This was handled through progressive insurance btw, that’s Uber’s insurance company.  So now I’m without a car, have to rely on my 21 year old son and my 68 year old parents for a ride to a mediocre grocery store job all the while progressive, Uber, The Cleveland Police and the asshole who destroyed my car are just going about their lives as if nothing happened.  So my advice to anyone still reading, DO NOT get involved with any of these companies.
So, food delivery apps fu** restaurants over,  like Uber and lyft fu** their drivers over?
TIP IN CASH!!!
2:40 because everybody uses Teams, which is Skype rebranded for business. The joke is WTF happened to Zoom, which so completely vacated my mind that I had to look up what it was just now.
I wish John would have brought up RideShare with these apps. You can be on the clock with Ubereats, and if you get hit by an uninsured driver while you are waiting for an order, your own insurance and Uber's insurance will not cover you. Your own Full-coverage insurance will not cover you if you are clocked in. UberEats own insurance won't insure you unless you are actively picking up or delivering. Gig workers need to get a third insurance for the time they are idle waiting for an hour or driving to hot spots.
The thing thats missed in this conversation is Disabled people.  A lot of disabled people, myself included, use these services because it raises my quality of life.  I can have resturant quality food with out all the pain of having to leave the house.  I mean physical actual sharp pain.
To be fair...it's not the consumers fault how far someone has to drive for an order. That's on the food delivery app and or the person delivering the food.
Great show. Would definitely like to see AOC here one day
Still can’t get over the order I placed last week. The delivery guy didn’t show up and vanished off the map. After two hours I contact support and ask them what’s going on. They call the delivery guy and tell me that “They can’t seem to reach him, it’s odd that he vanished en route, this has never happened before.” I say that I really hope he’s ok and they should definitely check on him in a bit, to which they reply asking how I’d like my refund. I tell them, then reiterate that I hope they can get in touch with the driver and I hope nothing happened to him. They tell me that the restaurant still delivers, so I can reorder, and this behavior is not up to their usual high standards. I tell them, yup, I’ll order again, but also, they have a driver missing. And they ask me to positively rate the interaction and to have a nice day.
yeah but uhhhh..... stop being lazy. Go to the restaurant. Listening to John Oliver sexualize horses and Adam Driver will never get old.
You make it sound like restaurants are victims incapable of doing math. Restaurants can and do pass on the cost of the commission to customers.  I notice that I pay 20% higher for my meal at this one restaurant if I order through Grubhub. It's the extra price I pay for convenience when I don't have time to go pick up.
I delivered for Uber Eats for a couple months when I found myself between jobs. In those two months, I put a couple thousand miles on my car, hundreds of gallons of gas into the tank, and made just enough to cover the gas and an occasional meal.  The only good thing was the "set your own hours" aspect of it, as that provided me enough time to go get another real job. I now work fewer hours, make much more, and only have to drive my car to and from work. Should things go wrong, and I find myself out of work again, I think I'll consider a life of crime rather than go back to delivering.
Next time I’ll order directly from the restaurant and go pick it up. I know not everyone has that option but I do and anyone else who is able - we should take the extra time and effort to support the restaurant business directly 🙏🏻. As far as the drivers…I don’t know the solution but I hope all these honest hardworking people find a better company to work for. Thank you for this information.
No. If you can't make a living delivering food then you should stop delivering food.
THANK YOU!! I have ALWAYS felt like the Devil didn't get his due in "The Devil Went Down to Georgia!" for having a much better song!  Johnny is just sampling folk tunes and the Devil is MUCH more creative!
best episode in a minute. Keep it up John
Just to point out the stupidity of the writers, "most of their income comes from tips. Tips make up 30-50% of their income."
This has nothing to do with tips.  Quit trying to be cheap.  It has everything to do with the decline of our culture and moral fiber.   STOP USING THESE COMPANIES
Got my first delivery job at Domino's in 2003. When Katrina hit in 2004 and gas prices soared, Domino's starting charging $0.99 or $1.99 as a delivery fee. It was a "temporary" fee while they adjusted to the price increase of gas. Temporary....
A lot of independent contractors need to keep ever receipt on their job because they can get tax discounts during tax season.
Food delivery apps barely pay anything. When I worked for door dash the highest paid delivery I saw didn’t even hit $10. Let’s just say I had to drive to the other side of the city I live in. Those taxes definitely don’t go to their employees
Most restaurants treat their employees like 💩. So I don't feel bad for them at all.
Prop 22 didn't just pass because of lobbying. It passed because AB5 was a really badly constructed bill that threatened every freelancer's business - which is why 100 exemptions were carved out leaving Uber room to sue for denying equal protection. Nearly everyone hated that bill.
Still not going to tip without reason.
My restaurant severed a contract with these companies and a year later we still appear on the app and drivers show up and get pissed off when we have nothing for them 😂 it’s ludicrous
Yeah. It's a racket. Just like anything else.
Fun to watch hustle braggers lose their ass to this crap.
I've never been a "gig" worker for any of these taxi/delivery apps, but I know a few people who have (and some still are) work for them.  If you're tracking your order on the app and the driver arrives a little later than expected, you might consider giving 4.5 stars by thinking, 4.5 is still good/reasonable, it's not like I hated absolutely everything from the delivery of the food to how it tasted, I just simply thought I would have received said order about ~10 minutes earlier than I did.  Well, guess what?  That 4.5 rating just fucked over your driver.  The app/algorithms don't give a single shit about nuances.  If you don't get 5 stars, you failed.  Period.  And, even as this segment mentioned, if you get 3 (or more) 4.5 ratings within a short period of time, you're fucked.   Please consider this when your food arrives just a little later than expected, or if the food itself wasn't that good.  Neither is likely the fault of your delivery person.  I'm not suggesting to give 5 stars to every delivery you receive no matter what, but if you get your food within a reasonable amount of time, and the food hasn't been harmed/tampered with by the delivery person, please don't screw them over.  Leave a bad review of the restaurant if the food wasn't that good, don't always blame that on the driver.
Ok I'm gonna be the devil's advocate here and say if you're spending $2000 on a bike to deliver food then you are a fucking moron. Get a normal bike for literally 1/10 the cost
ohhh, the individual, personal, solution, the liberal way to solve everything...
The fact is many of these restaurant don't want to change. I feel bad for the drivers.
I used to work at a hot dog shack when these apps were starting to take off. I remember one day a bunch of doordash drivers suddenly started showing up and being huge pains in the ass and asking for every single condiment individually wrapped to go and all sorts of bullshit. We just weren't set up for that kind of service and we had never even agreed to be listed   We had to tell every doordash driver to politely fuck off and not come back for a couple days straigh. We would have somebody rush up to the counter staring only at their phone and we would go "DoorDash?" And they would say yes and we would tell them to cancel the order
I 100% disagree with this. The customer is the one getting fucked everytime. The food quality is shit 50% of the time, and you literally end up paying double the cost of the food if you get it delivered. Not to mention, the tipping culture in the U.S is completely out of hand.
Tip culture is garbage, you do not need to tip. it just gives more wiggle room to corporations.
I was surprised they didn't mention the horrors of the delivery apps subcontracting rings of undocumented migrants in EU capital cities. I remember reading an article about it a few years ago in Paris that left me horrified.
"Spaced out like a ninth graders paper tryna make the page limit" 😂😂😂😂
Tip your delivery person in cash!
So GrubHub is line the American Government huh
This is irresponsible journalism. Just more libtard distractions
My husband worked at a fish and chips place. The owners stopped working with one of those delivery services because they kept having drivers take way too long to deliver the food. It would arrive cold and soggy, the customers blamed the restaurant.
Have never used a delivery app and never will. 😊
Tipping would help but it is definitely not a sustainable solution.
The fees of Grubhub's and others similar intermediary companies are a disgrace. I never use these leeches, precisely because they are leeches! Plus, walking or driving to a restaurant is the least we can do, come on!
Doordash has you rate the driver separate from the food. You get punished for declining no tip orders.
tbh customers definitely do not "win" when it comes to Uber Eats because Uber Eats hires anyone with any vehicle and has no standards which means they are forced to constantly offer major discounts to make customers use them at all and that's how they lose money. They try to get people used to their shitty lack of service in a way that makes literally everyone lose instead of trying to do it like actually successful food delivery service that make a very real and very _large_ profit.  Over here Uber Eats is most of the time delivered by someone on their bicycle and using a single paper bag so the food is either cold or, if you are lucky, lukewarm, which obviously means it does not taste very good and in order to keep their customers Uber Eats has to constantly offer major discounts which you can use virtually every time you order from them unless you order several times a day or something.   Quite obviously selling the service at a much lower price can't be profitable when there is a very reasonably priced competitor but the issue is that Uber Eats food is not only pretty bad almost all the time, it would also be actually more expensive than the established competitor if not for the spammage of major discounts on almost every order.  Over her Uber is on their way to a failure maybe not bigger than in China but certainly far more stupid than in China because from start to finish it is fundamentally idiotic to try to sell worse food for a marginally less price while making a major loss in order to try to own the market, stop offering discounts outside of once a blue moon and then rake in the profits because in the first place there is little incentive to order food via Uber Eats after you got your 3rd lukewarm or cold pizza from as many restaurants you had to throw away half of because it was borderline inedible and anything but tasty.  It's proof that being rich does not make people immune to total idiocy and incredibly dumb mistakes but rather can make people oblivious to the most obvious errors because they are full of themselves and drunk on their previous successes to the point where they believe they are infallible and can do anything without even trying so they don't mind spending billions on halfassing a massive business for the fantasy of a massive payout at the end but without an actual sound business plan:  *Over here Uber Eats is literally the food delivery version of*  *Step 1: steal customers from other food delivery companies* *step 2: ???* *step 3: profit*
Winning about opportunities is a full time job
EDOPT. I'm crying. 😂
There’s a couple glaring issues with this. First, those delivery drivers working under the old “menu in a drawer” model were not getting health insurance either. When I was in college 25 years ago, Dominos was not offering health insurance and I’m sure the Chinese places weren’t either. This also applies to tips, delivery drivers employed by the actual restaurants made/make less than minimum wage for their base pay.   The guy who was using a walker with a broken foot is obviously a sad story but we’re missing a mountain of context. I’m guessing that’s because he was at fault for getting hit and while that admittedly feeds back into the idea that the apps are pressuring workers into being unsafe it also undercuts the emotional impact which is obviously why it was included in the segment.   Gig work is very similar to fast food jobs in the sense that it was ever meant to be a career but circumstances result in a lot of people relying on it as one. I don’t think it’s fair to malign an industry because it’s easy for people to get “stuck” working there while at the same time dismissing the benefits part time/gig work DOES actually offer to a large segment of the people who have a choice and choose it. The “starting an orphanage” claim is obviously wildly outrageous (I’d love to know whether he misspoke or if there’s some actual story behind that) but gig work IS flexible and can be used to supplement an income to fund a luxury purchase or save for a vacation. Just because some, maybe even most, people aren’t using it for that doesn’t mean it’s not true.   It seems like a lot of the hate gig work gets comes from it being compared to some imaginary world that never existed/still won’t exist if gig work disappeared overnight where all the people doing gig work somehow suddenly had well paying jobs with great benefits when the reality is they would just end up working some other job that is just as “bad” (from the point of view of the critics).
I use food apps for delivery for 2 reasons= 1- I'm handicapped so can't really get out. 2- I can't drive due to bad eye vision (seeing is fine, but can't center a car with sh!t due to eyes don't work together)  Yeah I use grubhub not quite as much as Instacart, but if I'm getting fast food besides BurgerKing or Dominos, then it's Grubhub. Some places like McDonalds (least in my city) don't have delivery except through Grubhub or DoorDash  Since I'm homebound, i still have to depend on sites like Grubhub... but watching this makes me more aware. I already do not order in severe weather... or even thunderstoms is  a no. And If I can't afford a tip, then I can't afford the order.
I live in new york and I always make sure I tip 20% (or more, in inclement weather) and every time, the tip button is BELOW the confirm order button, so I have to scroll past it to tip 20%, and it's usually pre-set to 10-15%
It all sounds good except.1. People need access to health care. Something has to be worked out for that.2.how in tarnation can resturuants  be listed without their knowledge?
In 2003 Food delivery here was Pizza Hut or Dominoes and that's it
Etsy is guilty for doing this too! I make 0.12 on the dollar for DIGITAL downloads.
grubhub is the worst platform out of the three. My parents own a small business and grubhub takes 35-40% of every order, whereas Uber and DD takes around 15-25%. Still really high, but Grubhub is the worst. They only want to help restaurants and flaunt it in the name of that when it benefits them.
We live in a time where companies can exist without making any profit for a decade, think about being a small business. You would go out of business the first few months
Nah Johnny fuckin' destroyed the devil. A more technical, more original, more difficult composition while the devil's was basic af. The only reason Johnny "lost" and went to hell is because he was prideful
Im certain that one of these delivery services is owned/partly-owned by the murderous, and psychopath, king of Saudi Arabia. I’d love to confirm which one so I can completely avoid!
techbro culture is the rotten core
People who use apps and leave bogus negative reviews and complaints are evil imps. Spawns of Satan.
They have money to lobby and buy competitors but not make  profit
Those ceos are lying liars. Of COURSE they're making money.
Wait you are telling me that I should tip an order of pizza which already costs an overpriced $20 instead of $14 at the restaurant. Added to it, service charge, service tax, delivery fees, sales tax, other fees  rounding up to $32? And then you expect me to tip 20% ie $7 or he will throw my food away, bring it late, throw me a tantrum or spit on it?
We should be generous, especially we earn enough to cover our basic living expenses. However, I believe it's the responsibility of app companies and restaurant owners to adequately compensate their workers.   Both executives at app companies and restaurant owners often profit significantly, yet customers are unfairly blamed for workers not earning enough.   Tips were originally intended for excellent service, but now they've become an expected obligation.   Some restaurant servers merely bring food on the table without providing additional service, yet they still expect a 20 to 25% tip when the bill arrives. Now you are expected to pay even just to order a cup of coffee.
I’d prefer the prior method of takeout delivery if that was still used today.
I still love the idea of America--best country ever except where it isn't. I retired with my wife to the Philippines in 2015 and am now enjoying life. I still tip people but not at crazy rates. I get massages each week and if I lived in the States I'd get a massage once or twice a year. Fuck the greedy fucks in America.
In Connecticut I got into Ubereats because for a subscription cost of just $5 a month I got free delivery on all orders, no service charge, and 15% off the base price of all restaurant orders. It was incredible while it lasted. I quit when they charged to $10 a month for no discount and "free delivery" but with a big service fee.
As a gig driver I have waited so many years for john oliver to cover this. I see that it is gaining peoples attention now since many of them didnt pay attention during the prop22 election. But we as drivers owe the teamsters for aiding us when majority of the "passengers" did not.
Food delivery uses too much labor and energy like gas or electricity to move the vehicle to deliver a ham sandwich. There’s not much room to be profitable.
The Devil is tricking Johnny into taking a cursed golden fiddle.
What kind of loser doesn't tip these hard workers???
Sorry, leeches have what?
Lol, Skype really did go from like a 90% market share to 1% right as the market for their product exploded
These companies should pay their workers more, and im going to play devils advocate, but you dont have to accept every order, every thing you do,buy, is tax deductible, and its supplemantal to your real job this should never be your main source of income because youre at the mercy of customers. And in any industry customers are mostly a pain.
Marvellous coverage on the topic , Oliver ! This is what empathy looks like. Think about the person delivering to you and the conditions they are in ! This modern-apps world we live in is terrible !
I would explain to the moron talking there.   Most orders are under $50. Who do you think pays for the gas and the service fee for the drirver. The App! Simple common sense man!  Even the Mafia would not touch those margins.
John Oliver, fuck off with the shilling for tipping. No matter what, tipping these workers is just slapping a crappy bandaid on the problem, while at the same time "slashing the hand of the medic".
"I'm like Miss Piggy, hittin that green. 😂😂😂bro
Delivery apps are necessary for me. I am disabled and while I have good days, I also have days where I simply wouldn't eat if not for GrubHub.  Wish it didn't cost an entire friggin' leg every time I order.
I have 99% cut these food apps out of my life.  I will only use them if i am sick.  If i am not willing to go get it myself, i clearly don't need it.
as a delivery driver, bit disappointed that they didn't look into the actual company's financials because i did and the reason they are 'losing hundreds of millions' is because their boards are paying themselves massively in bonuses, buying competitors, and as wasting a lot on advertising when everyone already knows about them. when i first read through all their numbers and saw all of this, i realized corporate america is just a legal ponzi scheme where you have a good idea, bring in a lot of cash flow, pay yourselves at the top and then who cares if it flops or ever makes money because you're fleecing endless investment and income out of people for yourself.
Like most problems that arise, we the consumer are the problem and no laws will ever fix that unless we decide to make that change ourselves on the individual level
Im disappointed the poor payouts to the gig workers was not mentioned. I guess gig workers can be its own episode? :D
This is an important conversation but man, it is just not up to consumers to tip workers into a living wage.
Let's talk about what really matters here: "The Devil Went Down to Georgia". John Oliver is 100% correct. I was a kid when that song came out, and even then, I never understood how Johnny got the dub on that one. The devil bit is the best part of that song; I'll fight anyone who claims otherwise. Now, what's this stuff about restaurants?
For everyone blaming "tipping culture" getting out of hand, you have to realize that your cost is going to be the same (with tip) or more if we move to that model.  The companies won't eat the cost of additional wages. They will pass it on to you.  Why would you want LESS choice and LESS control? At least this way, you KNOW that money is definitely going to that employee. If you allow the resturaunt or conpany you are buying from to do it, they'll scrape half the difference in cost off the top and give the rest to the employee.  Our tipping culture is both better for the consumer and the employee. The only party it ISN'T better for is the business, believe it or not.
I will never use Grubhub.  Who owns it?
So basically, they're fighting like hell to get to the point where they can be monopolies and f everyone over? Because that's the most successful and popular business model? And even at its least profitable, it's still ridiculously expensive and inconvenient? I'm just so tired, lol
This guy is hilarious! i sense multiple writers and a screen prompt, but very entertaining.
Yeah I drove for Uber for six years and I can honestly tell you all, the only one that makes money driving for Uber is Uber.
As a beginner, it's essential for you to have a mentor to keep you accountable. I'm guided by Linda Meyer a widely known crypto consultant
numbers being yelled at you by human squidward is my fav show on tv
John Oliver is the closest we will ever get to a genuine hero
4:20 🗺️☕👨🏾‍💻💳 Quite frankly You need to examine your decisions IF YOU NEED A SIDE HUSTLE!?!?
The Sophie Choice joke...😂
It's so true, I was wondering what happened to Skype
If your response to people's tough situations begins with "Why don't you just," you really need to stop yourself.
22:00 You can't spell millennials without 3 massive Ls.
There is a great article about a restaurant that took advantage of being listed on doordash without their consent. Basically, once they realized the app had done it, they started ordering lots of pizzas for themselves and just throwing raw dough in the box. The dough was basically free, and doordash still paid them like net $7 a pizza. It was just a money factory for a little while
24:00 ''i get where that value-ation comes from'' i was so ready for a cheeky starting to zoom towards the 'jewels' and 'wand' of the stallion right as the clip where changed XD
100% correct... about the Devil being the better fiddler in that song!!!!
tips cant be mandatory
Use Grab🤠
“you cant spell millennial without 3 massive L’s was such a funny line
Consumer is already paying inflated prices for all items  in these aps. Then platform fees, delivery fees(if not a paid member). Tax on all these.  F off! John Oliver please donate to delivery guys. But no, you wont do that. preaching socialism just to others, earring millions for him self
I'm done with delivery apps
I don't even order delivery using the restaurant's drivers because I don't want to pay a tip. There's no way I'm ever going to use a third party delivery system that cost more and uses drivers I trust even less!
How is this better for customers? Before delivery was basically free you just had to tip. That is it.  Now you are paying delivery fee + tip+ screwing restaurant and delivery guy 😅
Remember: people who prepare your food need a food handlers license.  People who deliver your food don't need one. Let that sink in
Johnny played the fiddle much better than the Devil.
After this episode i dont know i thinking about reducing my delivery order from now on
This is insane, in Indonesia we have gojek & grab and we're experiencing the same issue!
Gonna have to disagree with the "tip your deliveryworkers" -- no, fuck that, fuck tipping. Before the moral police get on my ass, I do tip, every time, but only because I'm badgered by society into feeling guilty about it if I don't. Tipping in its current state is just gross emotional manipulation. It's supposed to be a reward for amazing service, someone going above and beyond. Instead, it's become the bare minimum, and you can even seem like an asshole if you don't tip enough. It's ridiculous. It would make more sense for delivery services to just raise prices and pass along a portion of the increased revenue to delivery workers, but they won't, because they know that if they increase the pre-tip sticker price, they'll lose customers. Kinda like how we have to deal with the bullshit of American stores putting pre-tax prices everywhere.  Too bad this shit will never change.
Sounds like the percentage an artist makes from a gallery. 50% … or sometimes less
This is awful. I’m never using this app again
Cheapen Soldbear Wannabe
John should give a raise to the guy who wrote "can't spell millennial without 3 big L's
All of those reasons that he mentioned that these companies are unprofitable, are because of the high overhead of managers and CEOs. None of that has to do the website, the service they provide, the delivery people, or even marketing.
Encouraging tips is a problem. The only way to make companies pay and people stop accepting the labor abuse from the food industry. Stop tipping, everyone!
Again this is an America problem more so than the industry itself. Because of stronger labor laws in other countries, other than the vehicle, all gear must be provided by the company. In addition to basic health insurance and since they are taxed on their salaries they also pay into the equivalent of retirement fund.
I don't know if anybody at the show actually goes through the comments. The addition of the unnecessary laugh track is the main reason for the decrease in views. Get rid of that sh*t please
I generally hate how American companies double dip on the consumer and the provider. You're already charging me $7 fee and then you charge the restaurant a $7 fee and then I'm still expected to tip them too. So what exactly are you paying for?
Food delivery is the biggest scam ever. $14 of food turns into $36 after fees and "tip" which is just another fee really. I will never use that shit again. I don't even get pizza delivery anymore because they want $5.50 to drive 1 mile. I'll go pick it up.
Thank you for this revelation
In India the Dubbawallas have been delivering thousands of home cooked meals for Family working in the City and returning used utensils to the house ,working in the City for over a Century using Public transportation and bikes without computers and still operating today, check it out they never miss or lose an order with an amazing Business model that works for All.
John Oliver loves his horses.
always tip idgaf about actual service u get minimum $5 regardless of prices because this is the system not tipping just makes you the asshole and $5 always felt worth it when i was a delivery driver even if it wasnt it really helped keep me going when id deliver multiple 0 tip orders even if it was fresh and early they gave nothing and got their addresses added to the do not deliver to list  always tip dont be the asshole
I've been doing delivery full-time for 3 years now, and while you can make good money doing it 40-60% of my income is tips. If I don't get tipped, even in California with our predatory prop, I can LOSE MONEY on an order. They pay can vary 30%, and since we're not paid hourly if I haven't had an order in an hour that's one hour of my life wasted and gone.
As a former food delivery cyclist this is giving me flashbacks
Soooo a handful of men squeeze the rest if is…ahhh capitalism
Paying for medical care out of your own pocket should be perfectly fine but because of how screwed up the system is people just instantly think of it as a bad thing.
I always used FaceTiming someone as the generic term for video chatting and secondly when everyone started talking about Zoom I was very confused because I never heard of it before and I had heard of Skype before so very confusing.
A critical economic infrastructural issue of our time, this video raises good attention with many good points   I was disappointed that it funneled perceived benefits customers. Citation was an incorrect and 3 year old journalist piece. There is absolutely no subsidizing going on here, delivery app prices are as much as 50% marked up between fees and hidden dynamic pricing, a critical issue that needed to be covered by this piece. Verify for yourself, check online menus to the venues you are purchasing from, or better yet, check in-person menus. Delivery app prices are hugely marked up without any indication, on top of ridiculous convenience fees. Money is being siphoned out of consumers’ pockets for no corporate profit, losses for participating business, this is absolutely meaningless  It is very rare John Oliver too scared to pick a fight. I dunno if i’ve ever seen one of his pieces present so much self-evident and incriminating information just to go “sure this is fine”in the end  I’ll say it, delivery apps are driving inflation. There’s a reason why the $6 6 inch emerged this year. Fight back by using restaurants’ native delivery infrastructure, or picking up takeout yourself. We do not need surplus markets complexifying our supply chain and agitating inflation
Dear god i hope this doesn't become some idiotic rant asking for delivery app jobs to be regulated and ruin everything for everyone.
You used to be funny and relevant,  but you sure are not either of those anymore
I don't know why tipping culture still exists; it literally traces back to slavery. The business owners should be paying a living wage, not the customer.
I live in a small city and 9/10 times order for pick up and pick up the food myself. I'd rather support a local restaurant directly than an exploitative gig economy job.
every single order i have ever placed from one of these services has taken 2-3 more hours to arrive than was scheduled on the app, I don't feel safe buying drinks (like soda) from these services because I've heard horror stories of people being drugged via their drinks. Not to mention it is really not cost effecient for consumers since they hike up the fees that go to the app all the time. Honestley its just a bad system now, and I tend to just take walks when I can to go get food, or I cook for myself.
UBER & LIFT OPERATE THE SAME SCAM.
I had my roommate lock all of the food delivery apps so I stopped using them. I’m seeing $20+ in fees and delivery costs for orders as low as $30. If I want takeout, I’ll just go to the restaurant.
Hotel sites are similar.
Great,  great, great!
It quite interesting that many of the comments are focused on wages in food service, when these apps undercut a restaurants ability to earn. They're sold an idea that this will help with efficiency, but then squeeze them and the end user for as much money as they can.
Re: that riff on orphanages and money, there were definitely people who rented out poor children as essentially house slaves for richer families back in the early days of the colonization of America. Don't give these VC assholes any ideas...
"I paid $43 for 1 slice of cake.I'm not tipping that driver anything!" We dont get the $43, we $8 for the 15 miles. 😢
"The main winner so far, us the customers"... What? I have been ordering food online (or through phone) since forever, but since these apps took over, the prices have been through the roof. I most certainly don't feel like a winner here. The price of transportation + various taxes can sometimes be more than the price of the food itself. How much more should the "correct" price be? John Oliver is displaying some out-of-touch millionaire vibes here. Food orders have been a convenience until now, but they are slowly turning into a luxury few can afford.
This is all very true, however I’ve never ordered from a delivery app and paid full price. They give out a ton of coupons and I usually pay less than what I would’ve if I went in
We should be happy that stoned and drunk people aren't driving to pick up the food, instead ordering it, while more expensive, in the long run, its safer.
I so want to like this video, but the constant shifting of responsibility to the customer and regular people for everything in America, instead of holding the mega corporations, huge companies with milion dollar lobbies and their corrupt politicians in power is just disgusting. Tips are optional and are a reward for good service, they not mandatory. I am not your boss, I did not hire you and I am not responsible for paying your wages.  Unless you pay your local baker the same, tip your cashier, the store employee where you buy coffee, shoes, your kid's school supplies and so on, there is no reason to insist on me paying for your life. I have my own. And I am not even from America, it is just clear you guys live in a 4th world country.
Issue is saturation with max profit   With the rating system in South Africa restaurants are rated separately to delivery people
😂😂😂 I have had that argument about "Devil Went Down to Georgia" my ENTIRE life!!!!😂😂😂
Doesn’t make sense to me that we got antitrust laws and they aren’t stopping a few companies from dominating every market like a pseudo monopoly
Why are Americans so obsessed with tipping? Pay your workers better. Tipping is a Band-Aid for a serious problem.
Can someone explain to me why some people are buying gear (bicycle, helmet, backpack in this example), when the point of these food apps, like the carpool apps, is to use what you already have and repurpose them for your food delivery job? Like I don’t think you’re supposed to go out of your way to buy a bicycle for food delivery, but if you love cycling, you already have a bicycle (you bought it for leisure), and you can make money by delivering food with it if and when you want? 🤔 am I missing something here?
i miss when john oliver didnt try to virtue signal like a woke zoomer
one of the many reasons my wife, child and i moved was because we lived in the middle of nowhere. we were so remote, no delivery app was accessible to us.
I’m surprised John is insisting that we have to tip instead of the companies paying the restaurants and delivery drivers what they should
The “can’t spell ‘millennial’ without three massive Ls” is brilliant 😂
tipping, imperial system, tax system, and a whole lot more. The US way of doing things ineffectively and make the society inefficient and our lives inconvinient for no good reasons. We have been using them is not an excuse when everywhere else in the world has them fixed.
Tips!  DoorDash posted that if you do not tip your driver enough - you're food may not be delivered as fast as it could be.  That's BS!
they are lying about not turning a profit
THEY FREAKING STEAL TIPS!!!!!!!!
Never have I used a food app nor will I!!
The valuation for most of these Apps was built by promising investors that they could reach a point where they could lock in consumers, extort providers, and exploit their gig workers.
We stopped using delivery apps. It’s so expensive. I thought food prices eating out skyrocketed. Except we started actually going to restaurants and it’s like $30 cheaper.
What's crazy is that they charge the customers and the restaurants at the same time (technically, the 15-30% increase is passed onto the customer since the restaurants simply increase their prices).
Stop normalizing the obligation to tip. Wages and pay should account for any work provided. No one is obliged to tip, but it is nice when people do. Nothing wrong with NOT tipping.
If you sit on your ass and have food delivered from a restaurant that doesn't offer delivery, you should definitely expect to pay more. Welcome to the real world.
They shouldn't be called tips in these apps beause they're not really tips in the traditional sense -- They're bids for service.
I've had a privilege of not having to use these apps so its wild to find out how much these companies are abusing essentially everyone. I hope more laws are passed especially to make these service jobs have proper pay. tipping should not be a thing anymore because its enabling businesses and companies to abuse people who work these service industries. and as someone who worked in food I find it messed up that their life is in the hands of tippers.
No Thanks. I do not want side of spit with my food. I'll pick up myself.
2:48 I've been thinking about this for years. how do they mess up that badly
You should look at who uses these apps too. It’s all black people and other minorities who love these apps n use it often
That cake order had to be Diddy!
Happy to say I have never even downloaded any food delivery apps.  :D
True! I was diagnosed with ALS in Aug and I am not able to drive. It make it easier giving my wife a break. I have to admit, I didn't realize how much it hurt restaurants
What i take away from this is that theres a billion dollar market for an app that lists restaurants with their own drivers and small margins?
I just started watching but folks Pad Thai is not real thai food, lol it's the least thai of foods. Try Sum Tom . But yeah I used to deliver food and Its a specail realm of hell. Pay workers living wages
This guy is a fool.  What does he have to say now that Stormy Daniels confessed it was a democrat lie. Democrat lies lies lies. And now this.  He needs to go back where came from.  Cook at home.. worked for decades before.  The only food that was delivered was called PIZZA.  Flipping burgers was how real young males got money and took out real girls.  Go back in time and Make America Great Again.  For ALL RACES.
Just went to order groceries from IC. I had 23 things to buy - I'm without a car, live in a rural area and I am almost out of wet cat food. Every single item is marked up. Energy drinks with my coupon that they say they use are supposed should be $18.99 - IC has them marked up to $24.99. Cat food is $24.99, they have it marked up to $28.99. So a multi dollar mark up per item AND they charge more than a delivery fee. Yeah, cats will get tuna and these companies can kiss my whole ass.
What is up with the bike talk! Focusing on bikes is so disingenuous. In America where car is king, drivers are the huge majority of how your food gets to you. Cars are WAY more expensive, between insurance and gas and loans these days, are the only viable option outside cities, and cause traffic, pollution, and danger at a high scale.  As a side tangent, there's also no consideration given to how the employee can save on taxes, if they log all their purchases as business expenses since they're independent contractors. Going back to bike guy; if that's all his upfront cost plus $100 per year of tuning, and he can deliver close to what a driver can per week, he'd have those investments written off easily.  Subpar take, on this admittedly very bad practice.
I actually use skype daily to videocall people.  They are cam smutty clients, but... still counts
i never use Uber, Doordash or lyft
They aren’t making a profit on purpose. DoorDash paid their CEO over 440 million in a single year.
I stopped using uber eats.  I didnt use any other.  The cost of using it is so insane, that I get myh lazy ass up if I want something.   To pay  $16 in fees for a delivery of a $12 item, it is stupid to keep using this crap!!!!   And tip ontop of it!!!  Everyone needs to stop using it!!!
We should incentivise actually getting up to get our own food after purchasing from a restaurant. You can blame restaurants for not paying workers, but once they raise those wages the same customers will complain that menu prices are too high. That’s just the way this goes. Restaurants will simply raise menu prices and then people will still complain. We really should just be eating out less and cooking more in general.
Start with, like he said, seeing if the place has local delivery. And I always tip cash.
Tiping culture is dumb and most importantly, broken!
Endstate capitalism
16:58  You don’t get to go to heaven.
I must be missing something. If legislation forces ALL delivery app companies to pay a minimum delivery fee then its not a competition issue because everyone must follow it. Therefore the costs be passed on to consumers. Whats the issue?
Ah yes the apps where if I want to pay 2 to 3 times more for my McDonalds to have someone deliver it to me.
Only used once because of a promotion.
I stopped getting food from all delivery apps since theres a $40 upcharge on a $15 food item.  Convenience smhenience.
😢😢😢 I'm a 20 year old science student in Nigeria with research knowledge worth 30 years. So I perfectly understand her experience. Academia is bullshit!
I can honestly say I've never used any of these apps. I'm not paying more for the food I can get myself. I get why they can be important but for most people it's a luxury.
Capitalism at its worst. Greed is the worst feature of humans.
That's textbook enshittification for you
Wow, 30 mins and not 1 mention about how these greedy app offer us drivers $2-$3 for 15+ miles of driving.  At those rates you’ll be lucky to make $10 an hour.  I have to decline like 20 trash offers before I can get a $5 offer.  Not one mention about this.  My car has so many miles so quickly.  These apps are pure trash!!
India is coming up with ONDC framework so restaurants and customers can directly interact. This ONDC can also be used for rides, e-commerce .
Reminder to TIP IN CASH whenever you can! I often leave a hefty cash tip under my doormat so neither I or the delivery driver have to worry about the app taking a cut.
Funny that the commercials I got before the video starts is for a food delivery app😶‍🌫️
Why can't we enjoy harry potter?
You cant go too fast. You cant go too slow. You must deliver up to apartments its stupid. They control and try to own your life. Dont accept a delivery? Lower point. These apps are the worst jobs ever.
Thank you for covering this.
" Gay parts should go to gay actors" then it's not acting
I stopped ordering through these crap apps. They are expensive, and are not worth it. If I want food, I will order from from the place online through their site, or order inside. It's lazy. And if I cant go out, I will just bring food.
So who's fault is this? Delivery food has made our live way way easier than before. You want better treat for the drivers? then we shall pay more for our deliveries, or the company shall reduce their profits, which they don't make any. What is the solution? Also, valuation is not the same as profit....
1:00
Tipping culture has actually removed the responsibility from these platforms and organisations to pay their staff and retain their profits so I don’t agree that we should be tipping anyone for basic services rendered.
I'm missing a number among the numbers: how much do these "innovative" companies pay their "innovative" software engineers?  For everyone who is not aware: these companies often pay their software engineers ridiculous salaries and waste the remaining budget on expensive cloud hosting, where a less "innovative" company would host on-premise on a way smaller budget. No I'm not saying cloud is bad. It's just that when you take a closer look at things, you often realize the lack of competence and responsibility. It's like if a large company with no real purpose is ripping off small businesses who actually had a purpose. Building a website or an app is not that difficult.
America where you order delivery food and wonder why you're broke 😅
Don't tip, charge and payback to workers ! Why can't it be simpler.
'It's their main source of income.' But it's a gig. They know this. If they choose a gig as a main income source, that's dumb and on them.
Tipping shouldn't be a thing. It shouldn't exist
Why can't 3 or 4 close restaurants get together & hire/build their own co-op of deliverers. Cost wise it makes sense  The under ground network for the best takeout around will easily win over the locals & expand from there. Screw the latest venture capital take over of convenience/quality.
Deletes Postmates Deletes GrubHub Deletes Uber Eats
I asked my wife to order Chick Fil A on UberEats while I was stuck in ridiculous traffic and just didn’t feel like stopping. I got to the exit and my wife texted me and said “oh shit I didn’t hit send on the order” so I told her no worries I was near CFA.  I went and it was 21 dollars and change. I got home and asked my wife what it would’ve been on the app. After fees, it would’ve been 42 dollars.
John is a true bozo for promoting the climate change eco cult. Wake up folks
I get it, your writers are gay and you have an audience and are rich, I still won't give four stars or eat semen.
it shall not last.. but the void that follows.. is even worse..
Are the apps **ACTUALLY** unprofitable? Sounds like a case the powers that be doing as they please.
there is 0 chance he was high
How could you not tip and rate well. These delivery people know where you live now.
I came across many “attacks” on gig economy lately, the only reason I see is that in the very near future half of the population in US will be somehow working in gig economy (recent studies) and gig workers are not employees they are considered entrepreneurs(independent contractors), which means they're entitled to write-offs, thus barely paying any taxes. So “they” want to eliminate independent contractors
MAYBE STOP WITH ALL THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLITICIANS.. then you will see profit and revenue 😮
Idk man, we had to have an intervention for my mom to have her delete these apps from her phone. They were costing her $1100 a month and she said she didn’t even realize she’d been spending so much on her fixed income.
starting an orphanage LOL
I've been told in the past these delivery apps paid well during peak hours when it was relatively new. Nowadays I just don't see that happening because there are too many people trying to make it work. The unfortunate thing is I can't see the system ever getting better because there is hardly an entry bar for the job and migrants will throw themselves for any job that pays nickels.
I watched a delivery driver pick up food from our restaurant and get into a minivan filled with kids and dogs...  Also fun to watch them wait 10 minutes while holding someone's order so they can get the next one coming through.
this idiot encouraging tipping instead of calling out companies not paying their employees well clearly he works for them
Every time I see a good looking horse, I hear John Oliver say, "Now, that's a fu**able horse!".
Even apps that deliver groceries, are expensive!  The groceries are marked up, then the store charges a delivery fee, and then I have to pay a good sized tip!
Bar of the night  “You can’t spell miLLeniaL without 3 Massive L’s”
I have to agree.  I always thought the  devil won the fiddle contest.
Maybe they should check people food order first also..weve gotten the wrong food many times..someone elses order..or only half our order of food..missing meals etc..then they dont want to give a refund or discount..such a hassle..and we have to share 1 meal lol. ..lame..and they fight everytime..when its their fault...bull
100% agree with John:  The Devil won hands down
I never understood people that wanted to order ice cream Because what you order and what I end up delivering…. I hope you learned a valuable lesson I’ll take the hit Won’t accept those orders ever again
And also..why is all the food items..cost alot more than if you go into the restuarant ? Greedy...
They always forget half our food order...its getting horrible..
They cancel orders or dont show up half the time..its bs..
These apps need a clear indicator.  1. How much paid to restaurant. 2. How much paid to app+driver.  3. Tip. (100% to driver)  The apps are 1000% profitable. They wouldn't exist if they weren't
Lolol Checkedy Check!!!
No you don't have to fucking tip, what you have too is sue the living shit out of the companies so they start paying livable wages instead of relying on customers to pay for them not to starve to death.
Can't wait for all this computer technology stuff to just crash and go back to the good old days
All of this country's problems are at its base, caused by greed, paired with negligence. The laws don't make any sense, corporations own all of the rights, and we live to serve them. The public has devolved into looking down on one another, and defending and living vicariously through billionaires. If everything I've listed continues to be so, things will only continue devolving at a rate we've not experienced in most of our life times.
The main problem I encountered using these apps is that the quality of the food was poor by the time it arrived at my home. More often than not the food was cold.
I have never ordered food delivery through an app, nor would I, but I did work for UberEats for a couple years and it is not something I would recommend, nor something I will ever do again. I actually didn't mind getting out to work every single day with no days off, but it took a toll on my car driving the mileage way up a lot faster than normal, oil changes more frequently, filling up the gas tank every other day, insurance, and dealing with the occasional fender bender, all paid for out of my own pocket. Tips were not always the best, but many customers paid with cash, some better than others. I stopped working for UberEats when they implemented the practice to stop showing drivers all the information needed for an order if the driver declined too many orders. There are often orders that either didn't pay out enough to make it worth the drive or went to restaurants or drop-off locations that I wasn't comfortable going to and I would decline them. There were also often times when I'd get an order pop up while driving and it only gives 30 seconds to either accept or decline or you lose the order automatically and that's just not safe to have to look at the app to see the info and decide while driving. I ended up stopping work for UberEats and started working for DoorDash for a couple weeks until I hit another car and totaled mine. I decided then that I didn't feel comfortable driving at all anymore and I haven't driven since.
Or you can just discipline yourself to go to the store on your way home from work and cook it yourself? -it's what I do.  When I don't like the way people conduct their business, I vote with my feet/wallet. It's very effective. Actually, scratch that; it would be very effective if everyone acted like me. Unfortunately, there are too many people who value convenience over resistance to corporate greed.
Didn't expect Sympathy for the Devil
I myself have taken three massive "L"s by simply being born at a certain time.
I have none of these apps in my phone. And I am glad I do not. End-users pay the highest price.
I didn't expect to randomly see M Street Bakery lol Love them.
Tip needs to be completely removed. It's just an excuse for companies to not pay workers. Should be banned across the board by law.
Being a longtime part time/occasional (thank god) delivery driver for these apps and being well versed in the goings-on with this industry, I can attest that John and his team are pretty much dead on in their assessment. I cannot stress enough how unethical these companies are, especially to their drivers. Poor pay(and ever lowering) and forcing you to hang out in a parking lot(unpaid+sometimes for hours) to get any order worth your time(barely) has become the norm.
Apps are for millenials and genz because they never had to call an order in into the restaurant and then go to pick it up or have a local deliver it. Us old people knew the restaurant and the delivery people by sight. We trusted the system because it was a trusted system that kept local money local. I never use the apps, even though I am temporarily disabled. I stil prefer calling my order in and waiting for the restaurant to deliver it.
Imagine the irony of that delivery person with 2 broken feet delivering food to a person with 1 broken foot.
It would be awesome if there were more affordable food delivery options for those who are disabled.
Give this comment a thumbs up if you will join me in civil protest of all food delivery apps. We will order our food via phone call and go pick up our own orders ourselves.
Checking my tax statements this year.. 72% of my income was from tips. Base pay on Uber Eats is usually 2-3 bucks
As someone who works at Little Caesar's, half of dashers show up well before we have the food ready.  They're normally on top of it, and we're the ones taking a while
these parasitic companies and their business models are absolutely NOT a "millennial subsidy", as they charge exorbitantly for their services directly and indirectly as reflective in upcharged menu pricing for delivered foods. there is literally nothing that they provide, besides the platform which we no longer need.... not where it exploits workers and small businesses as well as consumers, for future profits and current market/stock valuations in the billions. time to create open/free platforms for workers to use, if the gig economy is where we will continue to be in and expand.
Bottom friendly foods lol. It’s a poo poo shoot after all twink. Not gods intended function. Just saying.
There are a bunch of consenting adults in this whole process, it is the system that is fucked. These apps shouldn’t exist because they don’t make money, and on top of that there should be better protections for the people working for them mandated by our government that is supposed to have our interests in mind.
Except the devil only uses basic  techniques, whereas johnny shows a wide range of skills.
Sad to hear Oliver not condemn tipping culture.
Well !  Thanks 😊 Oliver!   I got deactivated as a Driver Last week on both march28/april06 DOORDASH AND U3ER EAT  !!!  Hilarious 😂 The Timing. !
I love doing doordash in California, where we have prop 22, and they pay me a stipend for my health insurance! I feel bad for states that don’t have this…
Don't tell me I "have to tip" without telling the companies they need to pay better wages. You just said they're taking 50% from the restaurants PLUS charging me fees... EFF THAT!!!
I love my job as an uber driver
John you missed something. CEO compensation. Tony Xu makes over a half a billion dollars yearly.
I'm a delivery driver. Helps with the bills. You PAY for convenience! I serve all sorts of people. Some are incapable of doing their own shopping. Some are, as mentioned, drunks and stoned, or maybe just medicated. NO JUDGMENT. I'm happy to serve my community, in the best way I can, consider being retired... And I thank each one of you for being generous and kind. Cheer up...peace.
I've never, ever ordered food delivery by these companies. We are creatures of habit. That's how that works for me. I google Chinese, or Mexican food around. Then I go to the restaurant not based on yelp reviews. What is the most important word in real state? Location, location, location, and have dinner at their place. If I like, I take a take out menu. Bingo, if I wanted some Chinese, Mexican, Thai food. I call the place, by phone, place my order. Then they tell me the order will be ready in 15/20 minutes. Time enough to go to the restaurant, pick up my order, leave a tip and go on my merry way back home. App home delivery to me always looked as a scam. Unfortunately there are too many lazy, and not thinking people.
As someone who orders food too often, it's worth noting that the tip percentage that the apps give you are usually between $3-$6.50 and then you have to click "custom" to actually tip 20% or more.
I wish you could've mentioned the DoorDash robots that are all over my college town...What is the impact these things have on employment, profits, and customer satisfaction?  (And how do I resist the temptation to stop the car, rip off the robot's antennae and chuck it into my trunk for inspection later...)
My parents were frustrated by Doordash arriving late and with the wrong order until I finally convinced them to drive the 5 minutes to pick it up. Then they stopped arguing when dinner came late, saved money, and got what they ordered.
I dont like how the apps dont have to fully disclose fees. For example, at check out, they do breakdown the cost of the food and delivery fee but they dont breakdown next line, taxes and fees. Wait, so there's more udisclosed fees? Seems to me like they're double or even triple dipping when it comes to fees. They charge the restaurant a fee, they charge the customer a dleivery fee and some unknown fee piggy backed with the taxes. OH BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!! Have you ever seen those special "no delivery fee" offers? Yeah, they still get that fee because you'll notice those "taxes and fees" at the end of the transaction are actually higher than normal.
The dude with the bike sucks at pricing shit.
Rip the people that saw this go up early unedited with the opening segments and then lost the video because you clicked off and had to wait for them to reupload it (me)
Dammit Oliver have to admit you’re on a bit of a roll! 😂
Ok @13:40 that’s literally a hasan joke lmaoo
Honestly, you should do a video on Skype, and what happened to it. It wasn't their fault. A company in the UK, Sky News, filed a claim saying that they owned the word Sky, and nobody else can ever use that word in business. And they won. And then, they went after Microsoft for Skype, because part of the word Skype is Sky. And they won. Skype was forced to change their name and lose all of their brand recognition. Now they're called... something. I don't know what, and neither do you, and that's the whole problem.  I wish John Oliver would bring more exposure to the vandalism of these word criminals.
I know this isn't about food delivery, but I was surprised recently when I had my car serviced and opted for their shuttle service to run an errand instead of waiting at the dealership....they called an Uber. It's only recently I've had a car worth servicing at the dealership, and I had never used this service before, but I'm pretty sure dealerships used to keep a car and employ someone for this purpose.
Damn
I’m about to show this to everyone who gives me crap for not getting food delivered.
Doordash definitely helped me pay bills when I went through tough times. 5 star ratings, accurate directions to apartments, and tipping make a huge difference. I still login in every now and then to make some extra cash.
I will be so sad when Business Daddy eventually comes for him.
The nuts part is someone who lives near New York City and absolutely hates these apps not only for the workers that are exploited, but also I think these apps ruin the concept of fast food is that that's the expenses that are pushed onto their" employees" there is now a entire rental service in New York or you can rent these bikes and gear for way cheaper. They made a market out of the employees! We're in hell?!
Your paying 9.99 for the app the fee you place your order then a 5.99 delivery fee and when DD sends the order it has no tip and 3 dollar base pay fee it’s not fair to the drivers or the workers unless you have money like that sure use the app tip your driver because the only way we’re making is off tips it’s a . Monopoly
Fuck grubhub. The ONLY thing they care about is profits, but they'll spend millions just to tell you they care. But they don't, they are scum
it should also be noted, McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King etc all have their own apps. If these 3rd party app companies weren't gigantic scams to the restaurants, they would be partnered with those companies too. Small businesses cannot affort to make their own app or get nearly the same promotion as these others so it's join or die.
Could ridesharing and delivery apps be nationalized? All those apps lose money yet still charge wild fees. Where tf does the money go?
22:10 Why can‘t Millennials enjoy Harry Potter anymore?
Always always always check to see if you can order food directly from the restaurant's website, and I know as millennials we hate calling, but if you can call and pickup, do that! At the very least, you'll be saving some money!
This was good up until the end where John just pushes tipping culture to an even worse point than it already is and somehow just exempts delivery workers from doing some of the very shady things they regularly do.  I know *big company bad* is John’s shtick but the workers aren’t exactly angels in this situation.
I remember the first time I used DoorDash.  Two months later, I started teaching myself how to cook from the grocery store.
First
In my country GrubHub (it's called differently but it's the same dutch company owning it) sets up fake websites for restaurants so when you google a restaurant to order from them directly or to check their menu you get tricked into ordering it from the app with a markup.
Fk delivery, i go pick up myself.
Who else thinks this video is all about John's minimum-wage writers getting upset about having to pay the Lazy Tax for ordering from food delivery apps?
Heavily disagree with the tipping mentality, if you tip you're basically facilitating tax fraud, it's not our responsibility to ensure people get paid properly, that's the delivery app's. By tipping you just take some weight off of those delivery apps and allow them to make even more money off of these workers, or even lower their payouts
Didn't know chong was a delivery driver
Are all gay people sex crazed maniacs? Because that ad made it seem so.
Just because the delivery companies are not making profits doesn’t mean that the companies are running efficiently and therefore the customers are the only ones who benefited….
France implements a tax on orders automatically of 15%. Miami does the same.  SF has a health insurance tax on top of tax.
I expected quite a bit of atrocities from food delivery apps mentioned in this video. I did not expect "we ignored the cease and desist" on that bingo card.
These companies are not profitable? They say they still try to figure out how to make money with that?... hä?? So I guess all these big celebrities in their commercials did the job for free? Very honorable of them...
I used to Dah briefly, and Im probably returning to it. It's nesrly impossible to maintain a normal work schedule with things st home. I really don't wanna go back, but it's probably necessary.
These apps are meant for part time work or young kids. Its not meant for full-time jobs.
Wow, this is just wild. 🙄
UGH! THANK GOD! THE FOOD HERE!
As someone who's chronically ill food delivery apps have at some times been a lifesaver 💛
...haven't watched anything TV related in ages. Wow do they love inserting laugh tracks every half second. Utterly distracting once you're aware of it.
It's on us to stop living like this, do whatever YOU can to use these services less. The culture of convenience has to end, tipping is not a solution for low wages. Vote with your dollar, go pickup lunch yourself.
So glad John is here to speak the truth. I've ALWAYS thought the devil was the better fiddler.
I've only used a delivery app once. It was during the pandemic and I'd been given a coupon for $15 off my first order. Despite the discount, the delivery fees nonsense was about $17 on a $35 order, so $52 in all. The driver forgot the pizza, sauces, and drinks, only brought our salads and bread, and got angry when asked to go get the rest of the food. On top of that wanted a tip even though we had added a tip in checkout. He said tips added in checkout go to the company, not drivers. Never bothered with this silliness again. Why pay $15+ for delivery when you can often get there yourself in a few minutes?
Food delivery apps are today's equivalent to the Wall Street collapse of 2008, thanks to investing in hedge funds. the derivatives market and risky home loans. Hopefully, these food apps will go the way of the irresponsible Wall Street bloodsuckers and go belly-up.
Jeez, judging from the size of those food delivery backpacks, these guys/gals will have to retire within three years from the spinal problems caused from carrying those heavy food orders on their backs. And I'm sure they won't get disability pay from these food app leeches either. [I scoff.] Everybody eats it [pun intended] -- the restaurants, the delivery drivers and the consumers -- except for the dining delivery apps. What a f*cking racket.
Call me by your name was such a pedo movie . I hated it
Employing customers to tip is a clear sign of an unfunctional system.
I don't understand why we need to tip when we are paying for something already including delivery, sometimes we even pay extra for deliver, so that money needs to go to the delivery person. Companies need to pay their staff more so they can live from that money and not only the tips. And people need to directly order from the restaurants they want to order from (if they offer that option) and bypass these apps, that's what I constantly do as I don't support this.
How is a Brit pushing tipping that much? 😅  If you order a slice of cake, - The app can deny it - The place can deny it (minimum amount for ordering) - The driver can deny it  So if all of them decide that delivering a slice of cake to a certain address is a worthy endeavour, then it's not up to the customer to start doing business calculations with having just one out of necessary numbers in the first place.
I ordered burritos through GrubHub during a blizzard in Chicago when I was in college. It still sometimes keeps me up at night. Especially since shortly afterward, I became a Jimmy John's delivery biker in the same neighborhood and got to experience making my own deliveries in blizzards and freezing rain. I've got some crazy stories to tell at parties now, but that was a sh!t job.  I swear, the less they pay you, the harder the job. Capitalism is wild.     Edit: Can confirm drug houses are the best. At least before legalization. Huge tips for hush money. Gonna have to disagree on the likelihood of the cake person being going through something, though. Probably a couple of teenagers home on a snow day who will laugh in delight at their "prank" as they demand exact change (then possibly threaten to call the cops when you can't give them the last 13 cents because you aren't supposed to carry coinage).
John oliver is horrible
This is why I don’t be messing with people. Messed up my order? Meh. Late? Meh. Could always be worse. No reason so make someone lose their job because I’m having suddenly less of a good day.
Restaurants need bags and stickers that say “not packaged for food delivery” “Packaged for personal takeout only” “please eat or refrigerate within 30 minutes” then stamped with the time.
Omg the irony of watching this piece and having a Just Eat ad play after the credits 🥲😅
Excuse you, John, I’m pretty sure bringing in a surprise band of demons to join in should disqualify you from a fiddle contest.
The few times I order delivery, I tip extremely high. Often even a 100%. Those people are working extremely hard and risking their lives. But I’m guessing I’m an old fart with old school morals.
I missed the part where you're being forced to work at these companies.  Here's an idea, DON'T WORK FOR GRUBHUB, ETC
Now there’s an idea. I’m gonna start an orphanage and put them to work delivering meals.
What about Biden's migrants? No mention of non Citizen non English speaking delivery drivers.  Nothing could go wrong right?
Yeah the problem is the tip, not the payment and no benefits of the apps 🫠 only in America
If we ‘need to tip’ we could all collectively start tipping in cash directly to the driver instead of through the apps.
Does anyone know if that update also made it so delivery drivers had to commit to deliveries before finding out the delivery destination? If so, it would allow the app company to penalize or fire drivers that refused service to bad tippers.   It is interesting how an app can manipulate customers into stiffing the delivery driver without suffering any repercussion, not even unpleasant eye contact. Door Dash has a convenient toggle to tell the delivery driver not to knock.
That rating the “worker” with a algorithm doesn’t work for the app either , all the ppl that want to do gig work know it’s a shit show and they wouldn’t do it if the didn’t need work, no one desirable applies
Not my responsibility to tip. Sorry.
When I order food, I make sure to never tip via the app. Instead, I try to give cash to the driver, just in case they ever dare deducting from the tips.
I think they tried to copy Meituan from China. The only difference is it’s cheap in China and no tipping. There’s just a small delivery fee that changes based on range. Usually like free to 2$.
Hail Satam
Hope you guys do an episode about tipping.
As a driver for 1 of the apps I personally don't like ordering thru them. I've known for 7 years I've dealt with them that its too expensive. I often get food for myself while picking up another person's food. I make sure the customer's food is hot and not riding on the seat of my car without being in a delivery bag. But yes, the payments are often abysmal, I feel for the restaurants I deliver for, I defend them if I feel the company is in the wrong, I defend and help the customers who are in the right and give no concessions to the ones who treat me or the restaurants like crap.
fufa ji aagaye
If restaurants are turning more of a profit with their own delivery drivers, then go back to that model. And someone can create a service that consolidates all of their menus into one central place customers can order from and track the gps of the delivery driver. It wouldnt be that hard to do, and the service could charge restaurants a small monthly upkeep fee. Surprised no one has thought of this yet.
I give max tip every single time. I hate that I don't have the time and energy to cook or drive somewhere to eat, but you better believe that I'm not going to ruin someone's life for some missing sauce.
Despicable Me 5:  Grub Hub & other Mafia friends
22:15 what was the joke about Harry Potter and the 3 massive Ls? Is it somehow related to LGBTQ+?
Here's the problem. The food is already 30-40% more than the restaurant here in L.A. How much tip is the right amount? Can I justify spending $50.00 on a pizza? No.
DoorDash does not check if the driver is authorized to work in the United States. The company does not require drivers to submit documents other than a driver’s license.
In most cities in Washington state, drivers only get a $2 fee per delivery, excluding tips. A driver must drive for 5-6 hours to make $100. And 60-70% of it is from tips. So, DoorDash is only paying drivers around $6/hour. That is gross income.
This is a myopic take.  Nobody is working as a delivery/ride-share driver as a main job.  This country has been conditioned to think that socialism is an economic policy that would be the end of capitalism.  That's not congruent with reality.  Having said that, yes - fake menus and listing restaurants w/o their knowledge is bad, m-kay.
Basic “common” decency. If only it was common.
I actually gagged out loud at the milkshake part lmao @9:31
i work door dash and have gotren an offer for 3.83 for a 10 mile drive
The model of Uber and all these other companies is to build infrastructure for the emerging AI. Once the workers are gone they will be profitable. Automated cars and cooks....
In-N-Out managed to get themselves delisted from delivery apps, somehow.
These, Lyft/Uber and similar apps are busy socializing risk and privatizing reword. Make the drivers take on the costs and the founders take billions in profit.
🇬🇧
There are so many people I know that look at business as this playground to do all sorts of horrible things in the name of maximizing profits and wealth. They'll be some of the poorest people ready for abuse that I know, and they'll act as if they're in on it, in on the game. Thanks, don Jimmy, but you aren't running these systems to benefit off them, and frankly, no one should. It's repulsive behavior directed at another human being. The funny part is a lot of people justify hurting others through business with the motto that everyone else is doing it or would do it, and these conversations I have with Jimmy and whoever else seems to indicate a lot of people actually would do it if given the chance. A ton of people just have this sick obsession with using others if the gain is large enough, so they project that on people who are actively doing it, giving them kudos. It's so anti-intellectual and horrible. "I have big stick now, me go crush" to a room of crushed people applauding. My God.
Please cover indian political scene... it's crazy af!!
Talk about how instacart wanted to steel tips from there indopedont contractors before the pandemic
I work at Panda Express and I will have to say that the craziest delivery order I've seen was for a $2.00 Cheese Rangoon. I can't image how many additional fees were added like small order fee, delivery fee, service fee, and the tip, if they did tip. Yeah, I think about the movie WALL-E a lot sometimes and how nobody knows how to cook anymore and it's making everyone lazy and fat.
Very important lesson here is to find out who is sponsoring legislation. If it is corporations who are worth billions, that legislation is not designed to help you in the slightest and should NOT be passed.
I really don't feel any sympathy for drivers not getting benefits or whatever. You know what you're getting into when you sign up. Nobody forced you to do this.
Wonder if you'll cover the fact that the restaurant steals the tip from the drivers.
'you have to tip' no i don't if i had to, it would be required to place an order  i still do tip, but i don't have to.
I haven't and won't.
<elder millennial old man rant> The U.S. is such a stupid country. So many examples of common sense gone wrong. I'm ashamed (as a Millennial) to be part of a generation that is so readily willing to give away money, privacy, and a generally good work ethic for a short-term/minimal convenience of not having to go to a restaurant to get food (omg, you're sick? WhatEVER did you do in 2005? Did you die? No? You found a way to achieve sustenance and lived on anyway? Well shit...is it possible you could do the same thing today??). And it's even worse that the working class now gets paid so pitifully (no federal minimum wage increase in over a decade combined with steadily increasing housing and health care costs that seem to have no ceiling) that people actually get pushed into "gig" work in the first place. The "gig" economy should barely exist, and only at the fringes. It should not be something that millions have to do to live.   This piece also serves as exhibit #1068727 of why you can never trust any for-profit company to do anything good for broader society unless they are legally forced to. Without proper regulations on classifying and compensating workers, corporations will always go right up to the line of legality for an extra $0.0001234306 per transaction. As Peter Gibbons said in "Office Space" - "They''ll fire you (Samir), so what? So that Bill Lumberg's stock will go up...a quarter...of a point." Regulation is needed, especially in the tech sector.  I can honestly say I have never once ordered food through any of the named food delivery services. I have also ordered pizza since 2020 and had it delivered *by an employee of the pizza restaurant*. It's not that hard to do.  </elder millennial old-man rant>
I seriously don't understand why love affair of Americans tipping!
Except that they want ten dollars or more for the delivery, but the driver only gets one dollar out of it and maybe some tips (rarely).
I've been getting my own food since before and after the pandemic. I've not used any food delivery service even once. Able bodied people are complaining about how much food costs due to inflation yet they pay triple of what it costs so they don't have to leave their house to go get it all in the name of needing to save time or even YOLO. Perhaps millennials would have enough money if they stopped wasting so much of it! This mass food and grocery delivery service industry should not even exist! Everyone loses money because it promotes and panders to the laziness of society. It's not actually a need. It's just a waste.
Sorry, I am not tipping. Increase the food price and the drivers wage.
I mean, everyone I personally know who uses food delivery apps does it because they're fuckin lazy.  While I understand some people need them for legit reasons, I'm not paying $10 for someone to bring me something from 2 miles away.
I hope he makes an entire segment about tipping.
I always say that be careful when words like "digitalization" and "entrepreneurship", they are usually greedy capitalist in more hip clothing
this is THE FUCKING REASON im never lazy enough to use food delivery apps. and of course theres the ghost kitchen bullshit we havent even covered.
you cant be saying those words out lout about orphanages, there could be fuckin tech bros watching right now man!
get up and go get the god damn food...you already don't have to cook it..
What a joke all this is!  Those apps were ALWAYS meant to be just side hustle money. Never full time work!
I do find it a bit weird though that you have to submit a tip before you even receive the order.
Tipping is not the solution!  Stop this idiotic culture of tipping.  How about this concept:  You do the work out of your duty for service.  Take a note from the Japanese...Europeans.  America is in the shitter!
I remember the good ol days when Grubhub/Seamless use to give you rewards for making a certain amount of purchases.
Gig workers should unionize!
lol I work a restaurant that started a ghost kitchen and it’s such a soulless money grab. There are 0 winners besides the people in power. The driver gets screwed cause it’s a shit job, the consumer gets over priced, sweaty steamed food they have to wait too long for, and it just creates extra labor for the workers in the restaurant. The rare triple loss
None of these gig workers want to be employees. Don't for one second believe what he says that they are annoyed they are contractors. No one wants to be an employee of these companies.
Don't like it, don't use it, don't work for them. Stop patrolling everyone's choices. There're adults.
13:10 What the hell, even the exec looks like he's about to crack up
So GrubHub is charging on both sides? Wow.
Zoom kicked Skype’s ass… so much so I haven’t heard the word in *YEARS!*
04/10/24 never used a delivery app. I'm an adult male who can take care of himself.
The young man who got back on his bike is an American hero.
The thought of someone delivering an uncovered milkshake using a car covered with cat and/or dog hair or sneaking sips is why I pick up my own food.  Also, are people writing off their expenses an independent contractor when filling their taxes - including gas and their health insurance costs? Do they even know they can do that?  I ask this as someone who works as an independent contractor.
those meals are priced higher on the app than in the store. the store doesn't loose money.
Kevin was hit by a car. Was it a hit and run? If it wasn’t a hit and run shouldn’t the car driver’s insurance pay for Kevin’s medical bills and pain and suffering?
I’m never tipping for a bare minimum service. Specially when it’s asking for tip BEFORE the service is provided.
Much of this he got right with the exception of the 15 to 30%. DoorDash has nothing to do with pricing. The merchants are the ones that decide what they are going to charge ultimately on the doordash platform. It would be disingenuous to assume of his part that food ordering platforms decide what the final menu prices going to be
I've always felt the same way about The Devil Went Down to Georgia. Thank you. Mister Oliver.
They chose the work. Not my problem. 😂
So the solution to the problem is tipping more? I don't think so!
Not gonna lie, i watched this while eating dinner i got off Uber eats 😅
if you dont want to participate in capitalism then leave america
The Devil got me!!!! I love you John!
What's crazy is when I look at the tax, delivery charge and tip i'm completely uninterested in ordering delivery of any kind.  Even restaurants that hire delivery drivers have 'delivery charges' on top of what you are expected to tip.   Restaurants are already expensive and then when you tack on these fees it just feels like i'm throwing money away at that point.    If you are able, just go to the restaurant in person and enjoy being served, or at least just pick it up yourself.  Thats how you keep restaurants and in business and their workers happy.
The delivery companies likely have way too many expensive employees and bloated platforms that require all those people to run them. I bet they could be profitable, charge people less, and pay drivers properly if their core operations could be run by 10s of people like Steam (the game platform). They probably ought to rebuild from the ground up with a small team and help the bloated establishment find new jobs, but this will almost certainly not happen. They also have enough brand awareness so no need to market. Then, platform costs per transaction would be cents (not including payment procsssing), and the vast majority of the money would be split between restaurants and drivers.
I use delivery apps the same as people used the yellow pages way back when. Just to check what's available nearby. Then I go to the website of the place I'm ordering from and pay less for doing so. My favourite pizza place offers their large pizza for 4 bucks less on their own page as opposed to the delivery app.
If you can't see that this show is propaganda then you're part of the problem.
god damn John and team that Sophie's Choice joke hit
Have anyone heard about Cloud Kitchen? And how they ruin any small business? The food industry is growing rapidly. Cloud kitchen took this opportunity to open many kitchens with beautiful promises to small investors. But they screwed them on too many levels.
Somebody's lying if they aren't making any money
This is the broker industry, they exist for towing, porta johns, dumpsters, contractors, trucking and food deliveries is the newest entry into the world of being brokered by a crook who keeps to much simply for existing.
I see so many people using these apps that definitely don't really need to. They act like these apps have been around forever. What were you doing 8-10 years ago? Find another way.
No, we're not doing this crap again. Tipping is a CHOICE. No more, no less. Service workers need to stand up for themselves and request bigger pay or quit. Sorry, not sorry. Former service worker who loves giving tips here.
I never order delivery. Ever. I feel so badly for the workers, all overworked and underpaid, and almost always extremely rude.
"Pandemic Era" - HAHAHA, we're still in a pandemic regardless of if everyone wants to ignore it. But on topic to something people will care about, the disabled community calls this a 'crip tax' because many disabled people do not have transport, cannot physically go to a place (due to mobility, transport or covid), cannot cook or pick up groceries, etc. This tax is EXPENSIVE on the MOST POOR SEGMENT of the community (also affects the elderly too) and for groceries, EBT/Foodshare will NOT cover these costs. Also, because these gig workers are treated and paid poorly, they are less likely to be accommodating and understanding. Many have left orders in lobbies which disabled people can't get to, left in driveways, etc. "Not my problem" they say. Edit: Also CHEERS to Minnesota for fighting these shit companies to get these workers unions and wages.
I have worked for every single one of the companies that were discussed.  These jobs are for wacky people who value non commitment over wages.  Instead of making the minimum wage you get to work whenever you feel like it.
think i will order from a pizza place
they are none profitable my a**; spends hundreds of millions on settlements like its nothing to cover whatever they are doing behind the curtains.
In Germany, there is only one app that has a monopoly on the market (Lieferando). That is theoretically illegal, but no one does anything about it. They can set the prices however they want and restaurants are begging customers to use their own apps or homepages instead to order.
Leave it to moderm man to create a business worth billions where litterally everyone envolved looses money and the customer contributes by saving a few dollars.
Will Last Week Tonight EVER do a story on the Dental racket???   PBS Frontline needed to do a 2-parter on the ADA scam called "Dollars and Dentists", that's how much harm, and how deep the rot, the dental industry goes.   When Last Week Tonight's story mining are down to Food Delivery Apps, I am completely losing hope.
Yeah he finally completely lost it.
Let’s talk about it because I been dying the talk about it actually. Taxes and fees are insane on those apps it’s annoying
Everytime I order door dash I challenge and ask for a refund. Most of the time I get some kind of credit. These co corporations are complete thieves, and are giving any money to their drivers so fuck them all.
Wait. Hasnt John made a special about tipping and how bad it is?
I hate delivery apps (full disclosure: I've used DoorDash twice in my life). Besides not listing all the products on the menu, they: -Jack up the price of the menu items -Charge you a delivery fee -Ask you to tip the restaurant -Ask you to tip the driver Now you've paid $60.00 for a $30.00 for a cold, stale meal. Great! And don't get me started on OpenTable. A consequence free way to hog up all the good dining times. I've talked to restaurateurs and been told that the 'no show' rate can be up to 20%. And just like these delivery apps, they'll put in reservations whether you've signed up or not. I've taken to calling the restaurants, or even showing up in person, to make the reservations I want. Delivery apps and reservation apps have basically ruined dining out in this country. Thanks Covid! Addendum: QR codes instead of menus are unspeakably foul.
By the time they are profitable youll be paying $50 for a single meal delivery from McDonald's
Now that rhat i have my own car i try to pickup my own food, so much cheaper   While i understand that delivery drivers for these companies are relying on tips, i fucking hate tipping culture (which is its own topic) just pay people living wages.    If these companies had to do that they would have been even more unsustainable.
ok so where was the discussion about Uber when the taxi driver self immolated in front of city hall
I live in the "communist" EU, and here, after each order food delivery companies have to send customer recipes with exact cuts of how much the app took, and how much goes to the driver.
I’m so proud to say I have never used theses apps. I don’t live in the boonies either.
It's truly discusting how everyone keeps adding some bit about weed. Like chill, it's not that cool. And because you wanna do all that you look stupid as hell
you dont have to tip, the compagny pays their workers, the workers salary is included in the products price.
Being epileptic and not having a license, grubhub and instacart have been super duper helpful, pre and post pandemic
Also, just as a fun tie-in for anyone who watches this show too much:  Tony Xu, CEO of Doordash, has not only worked before as a corporate consultant for eBay and PayPal, he was once a business analyst employed by who else but fucking McKinsey.  When people say all roads lead to Rome, apparently they must have had a firm in the commercial square back then >_<
A shame these companies are forcing these people to work for them.
"Independent workers don't have to have their healthcare covered" Wait I have a real job and my company doesn't pay for my healthcare either... Did John Oliver forget he was talking about America?
Oliver was not successful in addressing the real issue here by blaming the end consumer of not tipping and being the majority winner of this transaction...  When i pay 40$ for a plate that is worth less than 20$ and the app charge me 15$ in delivery and still i have to tip and it is my fault the delivery guy is not getting a good living wage... that means the whole economic system of this country is f up... and no they are not making profit NOT BECAUSE OF SQUEEZING THE BOTTOM but because they are reinvesting these profits and using it in their bonus and salaries and other stock investment...  I don't think John Oliver did his studies this time.
Food delivery apps are way more legal and proper now, but I remember when Doordash was relatively new, it listed us on their site without permission.  We were a tipped restaurant and we got all these to-go orders (when we didn't even have to-go boxes), and it messed up our tip pool because they didn't tip.  They were also listing food items we didn't carry, or incorrectly (for example, we sold orders of meatballs, 4 for $12, but on the website, it incorrectly listed that you can buy them individually for $3 each).  We also got negative Yelp reviews when food arrived and the food looked like crap because it was mishandled by the driver, and had nothing to do with how we sent it out.
Never used any delivery apps and never will.
I don't see this being profitable without massive increase in prices in the long run or one company gaining a monopoly. Or a Duopoloy with another.  Because if they would increase prices for their delivery service, people can just stop ordering food or order fewer food or they just get it themselves from restaurants in close vicinity, not needing a delivery service.
Starting an orphanage?  Wtf
Depending on tips is like depending on charity. Employers need to pay a livable wage and not expect customers to make up for the shitty salaries they are paying. Tipping as a standard is perpetuating the problem. As a non american, this “you must tip” is bonkers. Make employers accountable!!
John and team - now do a piece about Yelp. Oh believe me you will find some stuff to shine light on
The fees are ridiculous. I have used a food delivery app twice. Both times, I was on call in a hospital and could not leave to get my own food due to my requirement to stay in house. The fees are ridiculous. One of those orders was with door dash. I ordered a $25 sushi meal, but ended up paying ~$60 after a tip and door dash's fees. I can't believe that people use these services a lot.  Never again.
James Cameron already warned us about the algorithm and it's called SkyNet. Quick, we have only 5 years left to find John Connor.
Minor point but there is reduced parking outside local restaurants here because of all the 'campers' waiting to pick up a possible order
The devil got Johnnys soul because he made him commit the cardinal sin of pride. The golden fiddle was just part of the deal. It’s a famous and known theory that the devil won the soul by conceding victory
I hate the audience. They laugh when he's not funny
#LastWeekTonight -- Your production can best be defined as "Goodwill Agents of Truth".
Using these apps as a driver for the past year as a second income, and can say the algorithms are downright abusive. It will deliberately mask whether or not you are being tipped and conceal dangerous or difficult delivery locations on purpose. My favorite tho, is how all of them endanger drivers by waiting to send you orders which take up your entire phone screen in the moments while you are struggling to find an address so that you’ll accept shit orders simply out of feeling flustered as you drive, operate your phone and search for an address simultaneously. I have no idea how some do this on bikes. There is no regard for the livelihood/safety of drivers. Also I can’t tell you how many times customers have told me to park illegally, in a fire lane or worse, just so they don’t have to walk down to the lobby of a high rise to get their chicken chow mein, which I’m getting a whole $4 to deliver. Try telling the customer you don’t want a $300 ticket/tow, see what their rating for you will be.
In the late 90s/early 2000s in South Florida there was a service called Takeout Taxi, and I used it all the time. It would be in business a few years, then vanish, then reappear. I think it happened 3 times. They could never make it make money, as much as I & my friends loved the idea as young professionals too busy to cook. I went thru a homemade food thing during the pandemic and I don't even have an account with any of those services now. I still wonder how they make money, thanks for letting me know - they don't. People just love the idea & keep trying to make it work.
In case you're trying these some of them have a tipping time limit. I tried it once for a big discount because who doesn't love a good discount but i couldn't tip anymore after eating.. oops.
All that bike riding? C'mon, that's free health care!!  What a capitalist hellhole we live in. These people should unionize.
Actually, I never used the service, even though I had a coupon, once. Feels decadent to me, like having a cake for breakfast. If I want fast food, I should at least take the walk to get it. Also I already had that cake for breakfast. We don't tip as much as Americans, but we have higher minimum wages. If, however I had to tip in this situation, I'm not quite sure what to do... will the tip of this online order find its way into the pockets of the delivery person or will uber and co get it? Do I have to tip the cook? If I do, will the cook get it or is it embezzled by the restaurant owner or the app owner?
You don't get listed on to Food Delivery Apps in India unless you share the FSSAI number the GST number so no fudging around
Would love to see you do an episode about PayPath. They are the scum bag company that is used to charge college students obnoxious service fees if they use a credit card to make tuition payments. Thank you
I pretty much gave up on food delivery apps and don't use them anymore. The prices are absolutely ridiculous when it comes to fees. Something that costs maybe $25 wil end up costing you close to $60 to have it delivered. In my experience the food is always subpar. The portions are typically smaller and it's not uncommon for restauraunts to get the order entirely wrong. Not to mention, I've encountered numerous food delivery people who don't speak English who struggle to communicate when they can't locate your home.  The experience overall has been unpleasant, I typically just opt to order online and use curbside pickup.
Thankfully, ive never felt or had the need to use any of these sketchy middleman apps. This has vindicated me lol now theres good reasons to dislike these companies.
Okay, the bit about millenials no longer able to enjoy Harry Potter hit me hard, John! That was a low blow! LMFAO
5:10  Whoa, only one dollar tip!
Watching this 7 days later  Just after California mandatory 20$ hr minimum wage hike on “ restaurants“.   How’s it going???
I work at a restaurant and I am disgusted when I see delivery orders come in during turbulent weather. Then I have to answer calls from people at home with the nerve to complain that their order has not been delivered.
I drove for Doordash in its early days. I once got a delivery for a restaurant and when I went to pick it up I got yelled at for it. They had told Doordash multiple times they wanted to be removed from the app. Around the same time, In n Out was suing Doordash for putting them on the app. Their issues were food safety (they stated their food wasn't made to be delivered... which makes sense since it doesn't travel well) and use of their trademarked menus and logos.
Thank you John and your team!!!! Keep up the good work!
as a waittress, i fucking HATE delivery apps. these app add more unnecessary work for the kitchen and the waittresses, specially if the restaurant is understaffed. the restaurant i used to work for had both Uber eats AND doordash and it was a fucking nightmare. the owner was making bank off of these apps and we werent getting tips for the labor added, our pay wasnt higher, and our in restaurant orders would get delayed.
Gay parts should go to gay actors...was hilarious. Should've gotten more laughs
I've never used a food delivery app, and I doubt I ever will. It's just not worth the cost to me, especially for lukewarm food.
Why would anyone be required to tip? Its extra, just pay the people correctly. If they do shit, they get a negative review. idk, seems simple.
I stopped using delivery apps once my order of $15-20 suddenly cost $35+ after all kinds of fees before tip. Not worth it. I grocery shop and eat at home.
Really happy seeing this get a spotlight. My university had Grubhub kiosks installed in front of a Chick Fil A which charged a service fee despite you standing literally in front of the place you’d be picking up the food. These scummy practices really need to be called out.
Why don't we just cut out the middle man here? All I really need is to pay some guy to go pick up my shit I don't really need or want a complicated app just somebody's phone number and a menu.
Wait wait wait... you're telling me I pay a massive delivery fee, they pay the delivery people shit, AND they're charging the restaurant?
Stop using these apps!
I never once used delivery apps. I worked for them and I know they're bullshit. I only get delivery of the restaurant has their own people.
These platforms aren’t making money however they’re spending millions of money they don’t have to support prop 22. It sounds to me like they just found a way to hide their profits against taxation. How can a business model exist for as long as it has without turning a profit? It’s a lie they are Infact the only ones winning in this situation the restaurants are getting ripped off and the drivers are making less than minimum wage and that’s before gas and wear& tear on the cars not to mention the payments and insurance.
I do not tip. I give a personal cash gift that is not subject to income tax.
He got this so wrong. A 15 dollar order costing 30 dollars. And he’s begging to tip?  Focus on pay the workers not accept skimming the customer and restaurant.
These delivery jobs do nothing but keep people living paycheck to paycheck.
tip of the US bs corp culture iceberg spreading around the world. hate it
I find it hard to feel like a “winner” in this when ordering a meal with a $14 subtotal costing $40 once all the fees and tipping is added…
This is exactly why i don’t order thru door dash or uber anymore. Their fees are ridiculous. I just want an $8 burger and now my total payment is $20 after fees and taxes. Jesus i’ll just get the food myself.
People not tipping because they don’t believe tipping should exist are not going to change the reality that people need those tips. You’re just giving an excuse to be cheap.
It's sad that this show ignores half of Americans. The staff won't research let alone report anything positive if it's not in line with their politics. The states used in the example are ALL liberal; Cali, Washington state, NYC, Massachusetts. Yet in Florida, the state politicians have been working on a food delivery platform bill that just got signed by the governor.   This topic is common ground, stop "othering" people.
That Miss Piggy line was brilliant!
I use door dash all the time because it is officially cheaper to order a meal online that you know will cover two mealtimes than it is to go to the grocery store....sad facts.
I just doordash'd some food, something I almost never do, and then this is the first video recommended to me as I am pulling out my food
This is misleading...  When you look into the Grubhub invoice details, you can see that Grubhub took about $3k in commission from the $16k.  The other costs are for actual delivery fees, taxes, and promotions that Grubhub covered for them.  To be clear, I dont support the high costs associated with delivery apps, and I can sympathize with the restaurants, but the reality is that (speaking as a consumer) delivery and service fees have gotten out of hand.  The value of having food delivered by these apps isn't worth the cost anymore.  We need to opt to take the delivery fees out by picking up our own orders.   That's just my opinion.
I mostly don't use delivery apps  there are a view cases I would do and I think I ordered food for less then 10 times in my life
You can't spell millenial without three massive L's 😂 felt that
I literally started running orders a week ago for Uber/DD and am doing 30+/hr easily. Drivers accepting $3 orders right away is half the problem. If nobody accepts it they have to keep increasing the rate to get it completed. I’ve gotten Uber eats orders late evening with $25 base rates before tip that took me 10 minutes to complete.
This type of model has seeped into South Africa, with MrD Delivery, Bolt Food and Uber Eats as our main food delivery service providers, and the food is getting so expensive omg.
Nah, sorry, I have no sympathy for restaurant owners whose greatest fear is/was delivery drivers not working for 5 minutes “I would have to hire drivers that just stand around 😱🤯😭”  Serves them right to pay 5x the amount in fees than they would have paid a driver.
Tipping is a mental system for paying workers but outside of that, tip in cash if you can. You know its going right to the driver.
In my country Kuwait. Food delivery apps are astonishingly great with delivering charges almost $3 in less than 45 minutes almost every restaurant is available in those apps. Ever since this service is becoming more efficient a new branch of business cloud kithcen is surfacing
Lol, and I just ordered from a delivery app.
In India we have same problem but more acute market is converted duopoly with zomato and swiggy. The state govt like Rajasthan(not union govt) came up with listing GIG worker to employee status … the work is still in progress…even current opposition before general elections have taken serious note of this and came up with Employee status guarantee and social safety net… The Indian govt is currently working on initiative called as ONDC(open network for digital commerce) which is aiming to destroy duo monopolies of digital commerce … a good initiative worth replicating as it connects all the issues related from manufacturer, delivery, seller, digital service provider etc
If you think a single piece of cake is a sad order, I once had to deliver a single deck of cards to someone 22 miles away.
And so I've always look at Doordash and wondered okay so how does this company actually make any money?... cuz it's like, I'm buying food from the restaurant, okay and so there's THAT... then Doordash is seeing to it that the food gets to ME. So they got to PAY a delivery person to bring it to ME the food okaaay and SO the food's NOT FREE ok we established THAT.... annnnd... soooo.... uhm...  Where does the 'THEM MAKING SOME MONEY OFF THIS THING' part of their 'business' COME IN to it exactly?  And then I find out: THEY DON'T REALLY *MAKE ANY MONEY* OFF OF THEIR BUSINESS.  And I'm like, WHAAAAT???  So it looks like Doordash and Grubhub and all these things do NOT have what I guess is known as 'A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL' okay and THEY KNOW THAT to be the case, which inexorably leads me to the inevitable question of, ok so then...  WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS??  Which... I'm thinking... I may not want to know the answer to that question... right now.   I fear that the answer to that question is going to eventually lead to VALHALLA or something. I fear that the answer to that question might have something to do with... 'SOYLENT GREEN' or some kind of book titled 'TO SERVE MAN'.
I have to disagree with the conclusion here. Malicious compliance seems like the better solution.  Rate everyone 1* That way, the system they use will be forced to change so that 1* reviews are less punishing.  Ditch your tipping culture altogether. By being the main lifeblood for the service industry, you're encouraging the lower wages. "It's alright. Tips will cover it." I know you stopped listening to Brits years ago, but at least tip them in cash money, not trackable digibucks. At least that way they keep all their tip, and they can probably even avoid the tax man if they're not too stupid with it.  Also, how do you not turn a profit by making a website that charges for every interaction, then the bulk of your employees are paid commission only and charged for their equipment? Other than servers and marketing. Where are the costs?  The business model is literally provide coverage. Skim a little off the top and charge a fee for the pleasure. Your "staff" are largely free, and any required admins and techs can be factored in to corporate fees.  This stinks of over-management with a strong afternote of governmental market interference
That single slice must be from Diddy. "No tip for you, take that, take that..ha..ha..."
What are these apps making for selling your data
We can fix all of this if we would just quit being lazy and go get our food ourself...... personally I work 45 to 60 hours a week and have only ever used a delivery app one time in my entire life.... it was the day before Valentine's Day 2021.... and I ordered some wings from Kickin Chicken...... but other than that I 100% of the time incapable to get up and go get my own food myself or just make food at home it's really not that hard.... most of us have been doing it our entire lives
Not a developed nation...
Tips are the problem
Tips are the pay they give us 2$ per order no matter how far
kinda surprised there wasn’t a segment about how manipulative and exploitative tipping is for the customer AND workers
Delivery services has ruined pizza delivery! It's like a gazillion dollars to get a decent pizza delivered these days.
Someone needs names of the people making decisions on these lobbies and investments and hold them accountable for undermining democracy. This is how the top 1% makes their money. This is why the game is rigged and why there's economic inequality.
I co own a small place. We've had such problems with them. Exorbitant fees, orders stolen, food sitting for long periods of time. Even my employees being sexually harassed by drivers.   Contact the companies, and they tell you to get bent. They even threaten to bump you down on the list, etc. I have absolutely had them list things I don't sell, do "sales" without talking to me and cost me tons of money. It's brutal.   But people think they are "supporting local restaurants." By using these apps.
I'd also say that if you're tipping, tip in cash. It might be less convenient, but tipping electronically leaves room for shenanigans like the company keeping a share of the driver's tip money, which is pretty much impossible if you hand them physical dollars.
tip culture is disgusting.
I never order from delivery apps, never saw the point when I can just go to the place myself. One they charge almost double the original price for your order. Two, they always mess up my order and the don’t offer any credit when you report that something is missing or some of the items are not right. For example, I ordered a baconator from Wendys and got a baconator jr. These apps should have been left behind with the pandemic.
I must add that Johnny was a much more technically proficient player than the devil.  Also a backing should only tip further in Johnny's favor, given it was a duel, a question of The devil's abilities against Johnny's.  Accompanying demons just make it seem like the devil needed more help to make a better sounding tune.
As someone reliant on tips, I’m regrettably on the fence about getting rid of it entirely. If it was replaced by a $25+/hr minimum wage then I’d be perfectly fine with it, but even then, most of the time I manage to make more than that. If a good tip looked like 5-10% instead of 20% because wages were actually livable and tipping was additional instead of required, I think that would be a happy medium.
Never thought about this from the restaurants' side. Shouldn't have started this vid. Now I will always feel shitty while still ordering ugh.
Tipping is optional fuck that
Domino’s and Pink Dot ( only in Hollywood CA but used to be all over) hire their own delivery personnel. And most Rite Aid s to deliver pharmacy only. Direct salary non dependent on tips. No 3rd parties taking 50%
A total hit piece against GRUBHUB.
Thanks John
There is some disingenuous info in this video. The apps charge a set % that the business owner knows going into it, they also control their menu prices. If the app wants 20%, raise the price 20% over normal menu price. These are sales you wouldn't have got before the app existed, so as long as you increase the margin change, there is nothing to complain about.
I like Harry Potter more when JK Rowling defended the rights of women
You've summoned the resentful anti tip crowd with that comment at the end.
I can't comment on the new episode yet but as for execution rugs why do they not just use fenty? It seems really effective. A lot less painful then that pento crap. I am always amazed on how stupid the government is on rugs.
Which I know are bad but as a disabled person it’s been a life saver both as a customer and a driver.  Having a flexible option for making money was make or break for me.
Delivery aps make no sense to me.  It seems like a losers' game all around.  The food is overpriced, the workers are poorly paid, the restaurants are poorly compensated, and the app companies all lose money.  So how are they still in business?  If they were a retail establishment I'd think they were a front for the mob.
Whenever it does rain and I end up ordering food I always at least make sure to tip them well. Even if it was a cheap meal. Making someone work and drive in the rain for food deserves a good tip imo.
I think it’s worth mentioning. We are getting a good value in terms of cost for the company. We however are paying an arm and a leg for basically delivery.
I think some of the bad 'tipping' is based on misconceptions.  Years before any of this Internet stuff, Pizza Hut started adding a delivery charge.  Drivers started getting less tips, as the customers were under the impression they were already paying for the delivery.  I do not use any of this apps, but have heard people clearly state that the delivery charge is already added, and have seen them arguing with the driver "what tip? are you not being paid already".  Again, I am ignorant of the whole deal, but when the menu lists something at $15 and you are being charged $20, it is numerically logical to assume that you are already paying an additional 33% for the delivery service.  Add to that tipping is 15%, it may be OK when you walk from table to table (from the birthday dinner table large order to the 'just a slice of cake' table).  But what is 15% of a piece of cake?  Not even worth the drive.  Those companies would have mandatory minimum orders IF it would affect them.  But, since it does not affect the at all, they do not care. Contrary to popular believe, this models are not Capitalism.  Yes, they may be implemented in a free market economic model.  yet they escape the part of a Capitalist market where the business owners are affected by their decisions.  Models like this are more resembling of Feudalism, where the lords with the power can do as they wish with the peasants and merchants through brute force, as the consequences of their decisions are not reflected in the confines of their palaces and castles.
I've used Uber Eats - and always delete the tip and leave a note that says "I tip in cash on delivery."  No way the person doing the work should have to wait/lose out on that cash.
the man who got injured really broke my heart
Funny, but 99% is total bullshit. I work in the industry. 1) Supply and Demand - if this wasn’t a great business for riders and restaurants they wouldn’t work with the platforms and the platforms would in turn loose all their customer demand. All of the examples given are absolute bullshit. Restaurants make lots of money with platforms and riders as well, or THEY WOULD FIND OTHER JOBS.  2) Platforms are not making money?? I know most people don’t read at all, but seriously it’s not hard to google “Uber Q4 Earnings report” and see that they made $473 in EBITDA with positive free cash flow from their delivery business…and this is AFTER spending MILLIONS in growth, including their Super Bowl commercials.  3) The only time the model DEFINITELY doesn’t work is when governments intervene (Socialists), like in NY and Cali. Like in everything else, free market is beautiful and it regulates itself from MILLIONS OF DAILY DECISIONS from consumers, partners, and riders
But door dash has separate reviews for workers and restaurants also you can use a car you don't have to buy a special bike or anything. On most apps it tells you the tip you get before you accept the order so don't accept crappy tip orders. Easy. I feel like this is the least researched of any of your stories. It's disappointing to see.
The restaurant business model is by far the most disgusting one we have in America that outright screws its workers.   People don’t realize that there is about to be some tremendous changes in California due to new fast food minimum wage increase.  Many will leave the restaurant industry and would rather take the potential small temporary loss working at fast food restaurants. Over time it will be a gain since I forsee many restaurants closing because of low staff and you will see businesses with existing bakeries (exempt to new $20/hour minimim wage increase) open up franchises since they will be able to hire low wage workers to run those joints and will make hand-over-fist with that revenue stream.
I previously worked in HR at a food delivery company. Part of my job was to manage workers' compensation claims when delivery workers were injured on the job. This happened frequently because they would be biking through NYC in congested traffic, at the mercy of reckless drivers and pedestrians who didn't have the common sense to not stand in the middle of bike lanes. Too many times, they would get hit by a taxi driver who cut them off to make a right turn or slam right into a car door because a careless passenger didn't look behind them first to see if it was safe to exit their vehicle. These accidents incapacitated workers for days, weeks, even months, during which they accumulated numerous medical bills and endured the stress of not knowing when they could return to work to support themselves and their families. Filing a claim with the state was not an efficient process, and the compensation the state would offer them would be nowhere close to what they had been earning on the job.   These delivery workers literally risk their lives just to make life more convenient for those with privilege and money. I think if more people were aware of this, we would think twice before ordering food on an app just because we would rather not call the restaurant to place an order and drive a mile to pick up the order ourselves.  What is most disturbing, however, is how we as a society have gotten to a point where it is too convenient to buy convenience. We can pay more money for same-day delivery for items that we don't absolutely need that week, and we can pay more money for someone else to do our grocery shopping so we never have to leave our house to ensure our basic survival needs are met. Unfortunately, such practices prey on the most vulnerable members of our communities and put merchants in a terrible bind, and we as consumers also suffer when we give up small behaviors like browsing our neighborhood stores and interacting with cashiers and waitstaff. There is no humanity left in the consumer experience; it is all transactional.    I was eventually laid off from my former company. Since then, I've boycotted all delivery apps. It's been well over a year since I've had any food delivered, and I'm doing just fine. I never needed my meals delivered to my door; I was just manipulated to depend on these apps and to believe that this was a valuable service that made my life better, when it really didn't.
A thousand restaurants in DC?? Where I live there's like 15
Shareholders will screw us all.
i cant understand why people use these apps. i tried uber eats twice. both times i paid a 25% premium on my food order and neither time did my food arrive earlier than 1 hr and 15 mins and was cold. and the second order was completly fucked up to which uber offered me a $5 credit on a $30 order i threw in the trash because it contained food items im allergic too.  are you fuckn asshole kidding me. people are willing to pay for that kind of shit service. these are some very, very, very lazy ass MFs because these apps provide NO value at all. after my second order i peeled uber off my phone and i aint fucked with it since. that was 5 yrs ago. uber went public and was immediately valed at multi billions of dollars when in thier IPO they said they saw no path to profitability under (its then ) model. basically stating the point was to grab market share before auto driving vehicles became ubiquitous when it would fire everyone and THEN it would be profitable. fuck these companies. and now theres hundreds of diffferent lazy fuck apps offering all kinda asshole services. and th e"positives" ... i call BS. i have a friend that has a resturant in seattle and when covid hit he thought it was his salvation. then uber demanded 25% of ALL of his daily receipts and not JUST the delivery trash uber provided. cost him a few thousand dollars and a court case to get out from under ubers theft. now he has a delivery driver that gets $20/hr plus tips. not great but better than uber and his employee is an actual employee with benefits and not a contract worker with no skin in the game
Hmm. This was a surprisingly (refreshingly?) moderate-leaning segment from Michael Kosta. I appreciate it.
19:57 It's almost like capitalism isn't working and we need a system based around the... Hmm... Society or community?
leftist drivel, week after week
Was half convinced John was going to start his own orphanage at the end of the episode
I wanted to order a sub with bacon and the restaurant price was 1.50 for bacon, but the app made it 2.01 to add bacon, which means the app wanted me to pay them a .51 upcharge before all fees to have the restaurant add bacon? Wtf
Enjoyed your video, well done! Just want to point out that Tesla does offer a $199/mo FSD subscription that can be activated & deactivated on demand. That is what I would get.
man if we order enough food deliveries we might be able to bankrupt the sheikhs bankrolling them.
It’s a shame there isn’t the capacity for something in between Uber for dinner and the all too familiar grease-sweaty neighborhood pizza guy. Like being able to provide more consistent and reliable shifts for people who want to work, and the trade off for drivers might be having to give up the ability to leave work, literally with the click(thanks haptics) of a button? It would take zero inventing to do this, it would however require less greed..  & just someone to put it together.. & really, not that much “less greed”, their is still plenty of of treasure for someone to hoard.
The delivery apps don’t do enough or pay their drivers enough to take that much money from restaurants.  It is just greed on their part.  They could charge a fraction of what they do and still make tons of money and pay their drivers more.
During Covid our restaurant was listed on several of these apps that we didn't approve of. They had wrong prices, their interface would cause order entry errors, and more. We had to threaten to get a lawyer involved with Postmates when they didn't remove us.
Maybe let's just not use delivery apps? Was it actually a problem to just order delivery from the restaurant themselves back in the day?
That CEO saying "starting an orphanages" is an idiot! How'd he become a CEO?!?
That "millenial lifestyle subsides" concept is a little infuriating, only because I'm positive I'm not the only person who doesn't use food delivery apps because their absolutely ridiculous fees make them far too expensive. The prices in the app are jacked up from what they are in the store, then you'll get a small cart fee, so you add some more food to avoid the fee, but the delivery fee is even more than the small cart fee, plus the service fee, plus the "fuck you got mine" fee, plus tip (which apparently doesn't even go to the driver in its entirety sometimes?), plus tax? The fact anybody can afford to use these apps regularly, especially to feed a whole group of people, is absolutely wild to me. Not to mention the food always arriving cold because until really recently, these apps didn't require people use the thermal food bags that have been standard for delivery drivers for decades now. That guy said consumers are still paying less than what the service costs, and he's the expert, so I don't doubt it- but it still costs way more than just going to get food yourself, or ordering from a restaurant that has their own delivery fleet. Tldr, this is a business that sucks for consumers too- and if it sucks this bad for the drivers, for the restaurants, AND these corporations are barely turning a profit, if at all?? Why are we still being saddled with this system as if it has any benefit?
Postmates ignoring a cease & desist order, priceless!
"Mafia margins" - best phrase ever to describe this highway robbery.
The guy in the bike was probably at fault and the car insurance didn't have to pay.
Delivery is too expensive for me!
You telling people to use the restaurants apps to order I'm letting you know they use doordash and uber to complete the orders driver don't usually get tipped since it was placed 3rd party
On top of my 10 hour a day job during the pandemic I shopped and delivered with Shipt to build up some savings. One time I spend two to two and a half hours getting $400-450 worth of groceries, communicating with the customer the entire time as needed, and then got zero tip. They must not have understood how hard that shop was (plus the delivery and placing it all on their patio as requested). I don't remember how much I got paid to do it (not enough), but no tip? The only thing worse is when you get a stupidly low tip, because that seems like pure disrespect right there. They knew you were eligible for a tip, they made a decision, and gave you peanuts for your work. If you want these services, you have to tip. If you can't afford the tip, you can't afford the service. It's that simple.
John Oliver looks like he just sits in the corner
During the rona I drove my bike to my local pizza restaurant. My main concern was delivery folx not wearing masks. I drove my bike 3km one way to the restaurant to get my order after 2-3 deliveries. I still get freebies to this day... Now I understand why Im their "brother", "boss", "amici" etc... (depite coming out as trans since then, but oh well...) They made so much more money off of me and I paid less. Also the workout was worth a lot during those times.
I had a place a grubhub order a few months ago that had the correct delivery address listed but the server had a pinned an entirely different address 10 miles away, forcing the delivery driver to spend an extra 30 minutes to deliver the food.  I had to call grubhub to DEMAND I double the tip amount and try to convince them to compensate the driver for their computer error.
I was totally expecting a Ghost Rider joke when John mentioned the deal with the devil part haha
1:57 to 2:17 - best 20 seconds of this video 😂
Not everybody uses them.
Why would they be profitable ? They are still funded and they don´t pay taxes. Amazon was net zero for over a decade of purpose to become this huge monopolist, not many people talk about about amazon today do they ? They pay almost next to nothing and they treat their workers worse than animals.
EMERGENCY SOS POST! Please, for the love of all that is good and righteous in this world SOMEONE get to John and ask him to talk about #HaitihasFallen !  I don't know wtf has happened that this story has been completely BURIED from people's perception but when I found out about this last night from a YouTube recommendation that was 2 weeks old, then searched BSky for anyone who was talking about it, I came across ONE POST, 6 MONTHS OLD.   Supposedly, news outlets have talked about it but myself and many, MANY others are realizing that this is just slipping right under everyone's radar and this is supremely FUCKED. UP.  Argentina, Gaza, Ecuador, Mexico and now Haiti.  WTF???  Edit: Follow up; dug into it myself, and there's a hell of a spin being put on Haiti right now. Haitians are calling for NO military intervention, and it seems the US and Canada have been pushing for troops.   Imperialism at work, yet again, it would seem.   As a point of order; all the more reason this story needs to get out!
Hmmm how many of those overworked and underpaid workers are female ? What about more representation, where is the gender quota ?
You can’t spell millennials without 3 massive Ls 😂 I felt that 😅
The difference with these companies is they will always compete against people jus going and picking up the food themselves. They can only raise costs so much before they break.
I'm still mad that food delivery apps remove the special requests option from most restaurants so you can't ask for no ice in your drink. SHUT THE HELL YOUR MOUTH THERES FREE ICE IN MY FREEZER ALREADY
They took 58% sound just as the German gov. Where I pay way over 50% Taxes and social security like 42% income tax alone for instance. Yeah your leftist socialist utopia is not as great. If those margins are mafia like what do you call this gov. then ?
DoorDash puts the ‘ash’ in trash 🗑️ service  I’ll have to take a break from Grubhub and Uber eats for a while
Swear to Christ I got a door dash ad while watching this video
I disagree. No tips. The employer should pay for his employees or for the service (delivery) he is contracting.  Tipping encourages this stupid system.  When I buy something online, I pay for the service of delivering, and I don’t tip the postman or FedEx person.  When we order food online it should be the same: delivery cost should be added.
No wonder why food prices have skyrocketed up, these apps are stealing all the money.
Grubhub didn't "take" anything, you voluntarily gave It them
$184 million for a horse for ultimately inconsequential races and breeding horses for more races? Races. In this economy? They're just running. That's wild
EPIC, as always.  Thank you.
"Be sure to tip" How about we get the U.S. off the tips-for-wages scam? I won't punish the worker, but I'm sick of the forced tips! Pay your employees a damn actual wage
He is not funny. I gave him another view but he really can’t make me laugh…. Sad.
2020 to 2023 I spent an ENORMOUS amount on Uber Eats, finally deleted it. This isn't a complaint as much as it is a warning to others that binge eat with very little self control.
10:09 slacks, button up shirt, okay. A ballcap? For a televised interview he wore a ballcap with the rest of that outfit?
Oh no. Jon. Jon no. Please. Don't take door dash from me... UPDATE: Damn. Deleting it.
Class action suit when?
I tried taking a part time night job as a pizza delivery driver to help make some extra cash.  It was annoying that I was losing deliveries to grubhub, uber eats, etc.  I felt like they often got more deliveries in an evening that those of us who were staffed.    This also trickled down towards how the owner staffed his employees.  Where it used to be that there was a cook and one or more drivers scheduled, instead, there were often two or more drivers who were also expected to cook, and with no dedicated cook/insider.  What this meant is that not only would I have to share my deliveries with Grubhub, but I'd also have to share them with the other drivers that were staffed.  When I eventually quit, I was getting only two deliveries a night on a 4 hour shift.
Tipping culture is a very complicated issue in reality, with many nuances. What may be good for one tip-based food service member may be bad for another. I’ve had server jobs at places where I would have preferred to make a sustainable minimum wage with no tips in places where tips were minimal. However when I was 19 years old I delivered Pizzas for Papa John’s and literally made $646 in one shift on a Super Bowl Sunday. In that circumstance I was fine with the $7.25 minimum wage if I was bringing in hundred in tips. Of course this was back in 2005 so well before the era of food delivery services. I worked for Papa John’s, they cut my check. Not some 3rd Party service
baldmongold was here
I have never used a delivery app. Now with all the rude videos of drivers spitting in food or eating the food or complaining about not getting a 50 percent tip I never will
I don't know who is winning here. I tried to order a piece of cheese cake yesterday and my bill came to $30. I ended up deleting the app and eating peanut butter from a jar.
"Happy Easter, by the way."  - gold
People are just like they should pay them more 😂😂😂😂 hahaha no shit obviously they don't want to do that either. That's why they make you tip. Look at California. They just laid off over 1k delivery drivers over higher wages 😂😂😂 y'all just don't get it
but hey all that money missing in the restaurants bank is getting thrown at advertisement! Nice. I mean imagine how a world without ads.. horrible.
Yo. Cali resident here. I wanted to back what's being said. I remember there being tons of political ads on air during that time. Best I recall is like, "so vote yes to disagree with making employment required." It's was confusing language at best.
Imagine you're the person who ordered that slice of cake and you watched this rn😂
My power fantasy is ordering single pieces of cake on delivery apps, then handing the delivery people enough money as a "tip" to get them out of whatever pickle they need to even do gig work for, until the app runs out of people to exploit.
I know someone that works as a driver for Pizza Hut. There are many days he has zero deliveries, but the apps come in constantly.
That cake delivery to the island I'm sure was a diplomat that works at the United Nations.
Something they don't tell you, is that they charge the stores they deliver from.
6:54 Um....They paid for $3,563.11 in promotions (which was the restaurants choice).  That's 21.98% of discounts that the restaurant chose to give.  Don't blame Grubhub for that.
Ah yes, delivery apps, where a $17 dish somehow rounds to $46.53 at the checkout window every single time
US Tipping culture pretty much dissuaded me from ever going to sit-down restaurants and order food deliveries. Although that does mean buying a car since public transportation isn't convenient either.
These apps are stealing from the drivers. These apps are stealing from the restaurants. And these apps are adding tons of ghost fees that have not been there before. And they're still not profitable. Maybe these apps will just never be profitable and are doomed to die.
"You can't spell 'millenial' without three massive L's" 😅
Top notch thumbnails as always.
This may be the first time that I disagree with a major point in John's arguments. Tipping CANNOT be the solution. In fact, it is very much part of the problem. Work must be paid on a preagreed basis instead of relying on the mercy of customers that may not have the means to give substantial tip on top of the product and service price.
"You have to tip" and "The customer is the only one winning" has to be the two most ivory tower, dumb rich person takes you could've possibly wound up with. Still taking more Ls than us millennials , John
Never used a delivery app in my life and I'm proud of it.
You are pushing tipping, which is idiotic. Tipping culture is horrible. The companies need to pay their employees, not the customers.
Devil's band sounded good, not him. The devil's fiddle just hurts your ears
I am not even sure if tipping helps either way. I dashed a little bit, and I am worried that the tips don’t even get to me. Because the algorithm hides so much. I don’t trust those apps at all.
Why can't millennials enjoy Harry Potter anymore? Because Harry Potter is chock-a-block full of cisgender characters?
How do consumers benefit when using an app costs 40% more than picking up the food for yourself?
The hard truth is if you add up how many hours of labor is going into a single food delivery, including cooking, maintaining a kitchen, etc. Then you see its going to be expensive or abusive to someone along the line
Skype was bought out by Microsoft, who instantly added constantly updating animated/video ads to not only the individual chat/call windows but also the main list window. Which tanked *anyones* internet bandwidth, such that the application would often crash, regardless of whether or not you were even in a call.  This is what killed Skype usage for me and everyone I knew at the time, and also what make/breaks whether I will use certain game/stream/etc applications or even websites as well. Because this is still an ongoing issue in my book, regardless of how nice your internet connection you should not have a site/app/etc with video ads that you cannot stop forever auto playing in the background.
It's been proven that what the devil plays is actually way easier than what Johnny plays
Food delivery apps are stupid expensive, I don't understand how/why low income people use them.
It's like people thought we could just fly the food in during a flash flood. Sorry folks we're not there yet.
I'm really disgusted they John said the consumer is winning here. What?! No John no we aren't. Food delivery has NEVER cost as much as it does now. They are ripping consumers and employees off because they have a poor business model. This is on the companies John. They are profiting.
Never used food delivery, never will.  It boggles my mind how anyone can trust a total stranger with delivering something you're going to be eating.  They could spit in it, they could lick it, they could put any foreign liquid in it.
I don't need you to worry about my heathcare or my pay rates. I'm a big boy.
Why did YouTube put this in my feed list? While I do watch comedians, funny ones, John Oliver is neither. His marxist rants and totalitarian agenda confirming tirades are a pathetic sycophantic confirmation of his search for validation and acceptance by the elite.
110% on devil in Georgia
Since John Oliver is "baked" with "weed" I will not listen to him anymore.
with the part of the guy explaining how much his bike cost, I mean that's not really their job to buy you a bike or a car before you start. its meant for people who already have these vehicles. its like complaining about a commercial driving company not helping me get my commercial license. some do, but its expected for you to do the work yourself, just like how you go to college before you work for a company requiring it, you have a car/bike before you do deliveries. just because you have a 12,000 dollar car doesn't mean, blame them for low pay. regardless of a vehicle you would also use in daily life just complain that they aren't paying enough. no need to point out expenses that are just what they upfront require you to have for the job. I buy steeltoes for work and I don't get paid back.
It just seems to me that there are way more jugulars out there than are needed, and all the extras will be found in boardrooms and executive suites.
Amazing how businesses that aren't profitable can convince banks to lend to them sufficient to gobble up the competition. Joke system. Clown society. 🤡
Tipping is a great business model...... if you are a stripper. By the way, how does a company lose millions of dollars it never had?!
This tipping culture is ridiculous! Pau your workers a living wave and ask for a reasonable price.
Your jokes are part of the problem that ushered this in. Your type of cometary is stale and you are not funny anymore. Let other people do something different and stop injecting people like John Stewart and Colbert type propaganda into society. You are like a tired dinosaur of a neo liberal project which is dead. It’s about time we placed a moratorium on journalists from the UK.
gotta love that door-dopt app!
Uber eats and Uber and the lot of them, are just buying their time til they can completely automate them and cut out the human.
Last time i ordered from door dash the meal cost 45$ it included there gas money so added 10$. Then it added a tip section that started a 10$. That went from a 45$ purchase to 65$. If im already paying for gas (supposedly), which means everyone who orders is paying for gas (at least there was no option but to pay at the time) of course people are going to move the tips down. The customer should not be footing the bill this hard for the company that should be paying them. That cake thing was ridiculous though 😢
I think LWT should also do a story on dating apps. Talk about a rip off and waste of time.
I got a DoorDash ad when i clicked on the video lmao
I've never used any of these delivery apps (I prefer to  run out and pick up the food, and yes, I ask businesses how they prefer the pick-up order), but I have to wonder why delivery people take these "jobs" when they don't make any money at them.
I work at a fast food restaurant. Last night, we got a large order. The delivery fee was $18, but the driver was only getting 10. Between the remaining fee and the upcharges, Uber made 10 as well. Uber gets 1.7 billion orders a day. If they make the same for each order, that's 17 billion a day. Now knowing this extra fees from the restaurants, it's way higher. They are just greedy mfs.
Omg I know the Warren!  Was not expecting Pittsburgh.
It takes white people to die for everyone to speak out… They were heroes no doubt but the double standards
1 ) I always choose the highest tip percentage, then use Custom to round it up to the next whole dollar. 2 ) I order a soda/side that I explicitly specify is for the driver.
Tipping is corporate welfare.  No thanks. Get rid of tips and pay workers fairly.
I would get delivery because my job wouldn't allow for lunch, I was the only one on shift and eat while performing my job. I could go for lunch but it'd be me and one other worker so that would just be too risky for my coworker. I would prioritize places with their own proprietary delivery folk
This is why I refuse to use the apps. I always get on DoorDash and immediately close bc I cannot afford the prices. I call the restaurant directly and pickup if I want takeout.
Anyone else still subbed to jelles marble runs?
19:20 There's a more practical reason why this happened. The cake was forgotten on the original order but instead of issuing refunds, these apps are designed to never give you any money back. So to make your order whole, they issue another order from that restaurant for just the cake and because it was a reorder on a forgotten item, they don't charge you for it. Which means you can't tip in the app. You can still do it with cash but why would you tip a second time on an order that was messed up? And the final cherry on..... the situation. Because it was a "new" order in the app, the same driver is under no obligation (and often already off on their next order) to redeliver the forgotten item. So the driver that delivers that forgotten slice of cake gets absolutely fucked.
I know there is a lot more I can comment about, but I'll just comment about the tips.... That is why I'd rather tip them with real cash.... But also these companies say they aren't making any profit yet, but seem all too eager to spend millions of dollars on a campaign for one bill then they obviously aren't doing too bad.... I personally don't believe they are doing as bad as they say... especially knowing the fact that they can take up to 57% of a restaurants commission on one order in some cases.... The math isn't mathing and they want us to feel bad.... I have bad depression and anxiety issues so these apps really have helped me so much in some bad times.... even having to have dog bones delivered for my puppy because my anxiety was so bad one day and my dog had no bones or treats left... Thinking of going anywhere made my anxiety so much worse... And Doordash was there for me and a lady came and quietly dropped off some doggie items for me and I tipped her well in cash. There was no interaction between us at all and I did leave a positive review "about the store" which was actually about the delivery driver who did what I asked her to do in the notes which was to just leave the bag at my door and leave like she was a ghost... But they didn't have an actual spot for me to leave a positive review for the actual driver and only had a spot for the store or restaurant review... I honestly think now I would rather risk a panic attack or a migraine to get food or store items during my mental health flare ups now that way I know my money isn't being taken by greedy food delivery overlord CEO's...
doordash almost cancelled my account that i worked hard to get a good rating because i had to drive in rush hour traffic for 2 hours to bring someone ice cream lol
"You need to tip" No. America needs to stop tipping and putting the cost of employment on customers instead of employers.
Some days working as a driver I make profit just to fill my gas tank lol
as a grocery delivery driver, I personally don't expect people to tip. It's already costly subscribing to the app itself and they upcharge the items when you shop in app. Paying $40-60 for a 10 item order is already crazy. I get it. People don't want to deal with other people to shop or get food, its ok and I don't judge people. The apps need to pay drivers more. I would have a 35 item order to shop and deliver (about 1 hour total working) and I would get paid average $9.00 for THAT ONE ORDER. Essentially, getting an hourly burger-flipping job would pay more than food delivery from saving on gas and time
had to stop the video after I heared something about a phone call.... wtf... whats wrong with you?
Lazy people are the worst.
They don't only charge delivery fees. They jack up all of the restaurant's prices and pocket the difference. One cutomer at our restaurant complained that their delivery wasn't coming and we told him that we don't deliver and don't partner with any delivery services, but he can pick up if he wants. He came to pick up and was shocked when his bill was around $40 because grubhub was charging him near $80! Grubhub tried to harrass us into joining them, demanding 30% of each order, or they "couldn't recommend our restaurant." Ok.  😂
2 things were missed that I feel should have been included but here goes .. 1 entitlement from customers who never tip and usually live in high rises where the order 3 cases of 24 pack of waters and multiple items and want you to go thru security and to the 20th floor all while trying to juggle their insanely difficult order   2 the rise of illegal workers and not just Latino workers but , African , Russian , Indian etc who don’t have driver lic , social security or can speak English but they get to drive for these apps because they have websites where people can loan their accounts and charge  monthly payments from These illegal workers so the customer doesn’t know who really is dropping off the items and it will eventually catch up with these apps for looking the other way
MS Teams is rebranded Skype on steroids you dope.
Just to let you know: When i click the Bell icon i can see LastWeekTonight uploaded "S11 E07: Executions, Earthquakes & Stock Photos". After clicking on the video i can see it is about 40 minutes long and has comments disabled. After a bit of loading, youtube tells me that this video is not available in my country (Germany).
The city of Geneva in Switzerland reached an agreement with the platforms with the following key achievements of the agreement:   Stable contracts with a fixed rate of employment for all couriers.   Social security contributions, insures its employees against accidents and compensates them in case of illness.   Guarantees a fixed working week of between 3 and 40 hours   Minimum 2 hours shifts   Offers a minimum wage of 20.65 francs (excluding holidays and public holidays), 23.14 francs in Geneva (cantonal minimum wage).   Provides compensation for the cleaning of equipment, for the use of a private bicycle and for the use of a private mobile phone.
You guys need to watch Zwigato, the movie. It's about this very same problem.
poor gig workers... i didn't realize they were being forced to work these jobs against their will.
microsft bought skype, thats what happenned.
I use apps to build my order, then call it in.
I worked at a bakery that tried grubgub and had terrible experience getting off the platform. We ended up getting put back on by grubhub but they listed products we literally didn’t have ingredients for and we literally had to ban multiple drivers because they lost their minds when we said we don’t do grub hub because of problems with the platform
The delivery fees where NONE of it goes to the driver?  F that.
The ad at 3:00 is so fucking *CRINGE*
Economics and Conveniences
so maybe it's not minimum wage that's increasing prices, it's...dun dun dun corporate greed. Whether from the restaurant or the delivery service.
It's understandable to feel hesitant about tipping, especially when dining out can already be costly. It would be great if service workers were paid a fair wage, without the need for tipping. They work hard to provide us with a pleasant experience, from cooking to cleaning, and they deserve to be treated well and compensated fairly for their effort. Perhaps we could consider a system where service workers receive a minimum wage of $21 for new workers and a basic pay of $25 or more for established workers. Although it may mean paying more for services, it would benefit everyone in the long run. Tipping should be based on the quality of service and not out of obligation or pity. Ultimately, it's important to recognize the value of hard work and fair compensation for service workers.
I never tip on apps or in person. Pay your own damn staff, I am not doing it for you lol
It seems the Philippines have better food delivery systems both for the customers and the businesses
This isn't a new thing. In my area, there have been 3rd party food delivery services since the late 80's that I can remember of. Drivers were employees of the delivery services and the restaurants had full control of what could and couldn't be delivered. Even though the menus were more limited, It was still nice to have the ability to get more things delivered other than pizza, subs, and Chinese food if you couldn't go pick it up a carry out order yourself even though, you did pay a premium for the luxury. I personally am not a huge fan of how it's been normalized due to a lot of the issues that were brought up in this video and there are other issues that could arise not mentioned. There are too many variables and things that can potentially go wrong having contractors deliver your food for both the restaurant and the customers. With its popularity now, It definitely needs to be more regulated.
Great, do USPS carriers next
As a delivery driver myself the problem is that the customers ordering have so many fee’s that they feel tipping on top of that is just more expensive and may not be able to afford it not realizing that as the delivery person we are heavily reliant on tips as each delivery only pays us $1-3 at best
Starting an orphanage...  Is this a Yakuza 3 reference?
We have to tip just taking away for these companies having the liability of dealing with not paying their workers a fair wage..don't let these companies off the hook..it's important to speak on the fact that these companies and just passing the buck of their responsibility to the consumer to make us feel bad for the money that the companies should be giving their employees.
Gotta love late stage capitalism.
Unless you are not able to do so, I can't understand why people pay way more to get food that's cold and did a city tour. I do it if I am traveling etc. and don't have a car but the apps charge way more, and the tipping culture is getting out of hand. I actually started avoiding going out to places due to tipping. The employers must pay the salary like almost any other country on earth.
I tried to be a dasher but my adhd made it impossible
Thank you for breaking this down, I been a driver since 2015 and I can tell you this apps are worse than the tact companies, Uber is currently taking from 59 - 70% of the total fair . Is ridiculous and door dash is the worst delivery company to work for in my opinion the delivery fees are low and people tend tip as much Uber eats !
A 5 Star rating is for the food gets to you WARM. You can do whatever you want with the tip I guess but if the food is in a place you can accept it, and you rate less than 5 stars, and its within an hour of your order? You just kicked a baby. I don't know how else to say it on youtube
I drive Uber and I've completely turned off delivery requests because the compensation is embarrassing. Uber's pay has been bad lately but the deliveries is ridiculous. At the height of lockdown I did a lot because I had no other job to make money, and it was a lot better. Now though? $3 for a 10 minute drive to the restaurant, 1-20 min wait, 10 min to the destination, 3 min walking up and down stairs/waiting for a doorman, etc., for a $3 tip? $6 for 20-40min of work? Nope.
No, no tips. Why? Because the workers shouldn't have to rely on them. The whole system is wrong! I don't rely on tips. I'm from Germany and we don't have to. We got a guaranteed minimum wage. And social security system. It's not that hard to understand. If you work a full time job, you ought to be able to pay your living from that, and that alone. Including accidents and getting ill. We can. But Americans still let themselves being tricked into thinking you're lazy when in reality it's about so e stakeholders whose only contribution to the country and their own wealth was being born as a rich family's kid.
jim cramer, he's a goat, a massive douche goat
Recently I only had cash but since I don’t have a license I can’t really go out. I just kept remembering when I was younger I could order Chinese from my local spot and they would deliver and take cash once they got there. Now so many restaurants around me only do online ordering and have no cash options anymore. I miss that simplicity
"food delivery apps claim NOT making profit" is big LIE! while paying gov contribution up to 180M $
establishment lap dog
These companies take 15% or more from the restaurants. They take over 50% or more of the delivery person, and they charge the consumer more. It's insane.
As a restaurateur... I hope all of you who are advocating for eliminating tipping and increasing wages are prepared to pay more to dine out. Margins are very thin and even under the current system, lots of restaurants struggle to survive. Your proposed solution has a consequential price tag to it. Are you prepared to bear that cost?
Uber makes money/profit
DoorDash is projected to make a profit in 2025.
is the bird man scared of warner bros?
This entire episode has further deepened my depression in an inexplicable way. Due to health reasons, I was forced to abandon my 20 year career and work through these apps. In many ways (as explained here), these services are borderline unethical. Money isn't actually a problem in my area. I make 90% of what I did as a journeyman machinist while working around 70% of the hours. One of the key things that is lacking from this commentary is the ability to make your business, not you, the private contractor. It is beyond possible to setup employer insurance, PTO, and most of the usual benefits while contracting for these apps. Even transforming that dreaded 1099 into a W-2. The biggest issue, in my opinion, is the marketing that working like this is solely for an individual and not a business. I setup my business account to take a direct percentage, and I pay myself with a regular weekly check. The largest flaw for the workers isn't the pay, it is scumbag corporate marketing deciding that you can do this for "a few extra bucks" and refusing to elaborate on the necessary business savvy to make it actually work full time.   Also, this piece didn't touch on the biggest issue outside of major cities - getting shifts. DoorDash is especially bad at actually offering the "you choose when to work" gimmick when you aren't in a city that can support constant 24/7 shifts. In suburbia, you are lucky to get a shift that isn't 12-4 am because they will let literally anyone with a license do it. As far as just in general being able to work, GrubHub is the most flexible. If orders pop up, you can take them. In my area, InstaCart is the absolute worst because I live juuussttttt close enough to the mountains in north GA, that I'll frequently get offered $30 to drive about 60 miles total into the mountains after I've done the actual shopping.  I guess  my point is that overall, the biggest bruise that these apps cause is the idea that an individual with no business sense whatsoever can... run a business. By themselves. With no support. I'm aware that everything that I've said is anecdotal, but please take it to heart.
Delivery drivers are animals😂😂
Delivery 7.00 Service 3.39 Tax 2.26 Tip 6.00   So basically the equivalent of another menu item and a 20 dollar crappy meal that now is 40 bucks through the apps 😞😒
I disagree with John. Unless you are actually disabled, don’t use these apps.
Like Fugazi said, Its not what they are selling, its what your buying.
11:26 yes, I did have more fun listening to the devil rather than Johnny
THAT HARRY POTTER COMMENT HIT WAY TOO HARD 😭😭😭
I am disabled now and uae delivery services to get food.  I always tip and have only ever complained about 1 driver as they refused to follow the instructions of delivery multiple times
If a few negative reviews are enough to get someone kicked off of these platforms then how do i continue to get so many terrible drivers.
I find the proliferation of these services to be a sad commentary on society.  Both the suppliers and consumers of these services also mirror the spreading income gap. It’s all just kinda gross.
I don't buy for one second that they aren't making any profit. You literally can't run a business without profit. And you certainly don't have millions of dollars to spend on lobbying against labor laws. They would have gone bankrupt in the first 6 months. They are lying about their numbers so they can convince everyone that we're the ones getting a good deal, just like John sold for them in this story. And then, they can just keep raising their prices without any blowback.
😱😯🙀
@16:03 "we have replaced the tyranny of the boss with the tyranny of an algorithm and that is much worse."
He has millions to tip. But we can’t.
John you need to do a series on tipping being out of control and what alternatives we can do.
I worked for a restaurant corporation until 2016.There were tons of delivery startups and I cannot count the number that we had to hardline and demand they remove us from their listings for all these reasons.
Got booted from door dash because scammers gave me poor reviews
They aren’t making a profit but they have 184 million to spend on a California proposition?! 🙄
To explain those caveats.. https://www.google.com/search?q=uber+shell+corporation+netherlands&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari  pretty big thing to leave out!
get one proper job so you dont need side hustles/add'l jobs.  Working, 3 part time crappy jobs is not admirable, smart or hardworking.
I would tip if it guarantee that the whole tip will be given to the delivery driver.
Pure nonsense.  These workers (lmao) are ignoring orders that don’t have tips, and only choosing highest tips making us the consumer compete with one another it’s BS.  If you are a worker and you deny or ignore an order you should BE FIRED  THEY ARENT WORKERS
I was with you until you started lying about the gig worker protection law in California called AB5. That law has cost so many jobs for people who like to work side jobs. There’s a reason the ballot measure trying to kill AB5 overwhelmingly passed pal.
Watching this as the uber eats delivery guy gave me the wrong order
What kind of person orders ice cream delivery? Just take a moment to think about how absurd that is.
Postmates as a sidehustle in 2014/15 in San Francisco was* a gamechanger.
Uh, this isn't the most recent episode. The most recent episode was about the death penalty.
They care more about time than money. The problem with that logic is time is money. The same way money is time.
I have NEVER used any gig economy app.
Every time I've ordered delivery the food arrives an hour later, it's cold, the texture is ruined from packaging it while hot (ex. anything that is supposed to be crispy isn't anymore), there are items missing and the directions weren't followed- all on top of inflated pricing, a huge delivery fee, and THEN they want a tip. Nope.
Alternative reality, dont tip at all, its not the consumers responsibility to pay wages, that forces people to not contract with them, the restaurant can also terminate their contracts so they dont have to pay extra and then we can let the industry die and people can stop being lazy and get their own damn food.

As a former delivery driver, I had never seen much of anything come back in my favor from the apps. I was actually employed by the restaurant I delivered for and got back 5$ per delivery per night plus a share of the total tips per night. During early COVID I had to make a 1am delivery to a place that on a clear day would have been about 25 minutes away from the restaurant. Tonight there was a snowstorm, and it took an hour and a half to get there and 2 and a half hours to get back to the restaurant and hand in the cash to the manager. I quit as soon as I walked in the door. Thankfully I was already starting at my next job later that week. Please be kind to your delivery drivers if you must order delivery. Or just order ahead and pick it up from the store yourself.
To be fair to Skype, it was Microsoft that killed it off with its purchase of Skype. Before that it had become ubiquitous under its own steam.
Apps are convenient to a degree, but when you're so used to meal prep yourself and have several cookbooks, it's not the same boring shit from the same places.
it's very sad that people tipping everytime they get a drink from a bar, but don't tip delivery drivers while those drivers are doing a lot, such as driving their car, getting into to restaurant, grabbing food, finding customers' home from very confusing apartment complexes and even being stressed out about parking on the street.
I’ve delivered with Door Dash the sad thing is the fancier houses in expensive neighborhoods are the worst tippers (Literally $1 I’ve had it happen 3 times), I wish it was easier to see ahead of time the delivery address so you can refuse those orders because you do not see ahead of time if there is a tip, btw DD pay per order is $2-$3. I hardly do it anymore it was actually an ok side thing here and there but after a few of those experiences f that noise.
These jobs absolutely do not meet the requirements for independent contract workers.  Independent contractors are businesses that negotiate payments for each job, can subcontract work out if they want, dictate how they do a job, and tell their clients what's possible and what's not.  These delivery companies clearly are hiring employees, not clients signing contracts with businesses.    No one should be working for the companies until they change their policies to be legal.
👍
I used DoorDash in a certain time 2021, when I was without a vehicle and I was 7 miles away from the Walmart grocery store and there was no transit to get there and I felt bad about inconveniencing my neighbors, even though they recognized my situation and volunteered to take me when they were going grocery shopping. I got the cash register receipt that the DoorDash driver accidentally left in the bag and realized that there was the web price,  and then there was the in-store sale price usually not more than $.50 EXCEPT a bag of Starbucks coffee beans that was marked down from $11.99 to $7.99 IN-STORE SALE PRICE. Not only was DoorDash charging the service fee and a delivery fee but they were not passing on the in-store sale prices. $12 in store savings & 2 - $6 fees, not including a recommended TIP. Pushes your purchase of $51 up to $75 and the drivers that usually showed up had the most beat up vehicles and fairly used clothing. Obviously they were not benefiting from the fruits of their labor, only the big corporation. The lady in customer service on the phone basically told me that I wasn’t supposed to get the cash register receipt and that if I was willing to pay those prices on the web, what was the problem? 😢 I guess, I just assumed they would pass on the savings to me., greedy 🐖🐖s
They need to end gig apps is a modern day slavery work
ITS NOT ON MY TIPPING ITS ON THEIR REDISTRIBUTION IF ITS AN ALGORITHM WHY A CEO?!!!
As high as their fees are, all the delivery apps are losing money. Uber and Lyft just recently went cash flow positive. Got to wonder where all the money is going.
TONY THE CEO DOESNT THINK HUMANS ARE PEOPLE THEY ARE A FORCE TO BE WORKED
I've never in my life used a food delivery service. And I likely never will.
FUCK ALL THESE COMPANIES. 8 dollar item becomes 17 dollars BEFORE TiP
John, I have thought the same about The Devil Went Down To Georgia🤣
Dang. You had to come for the jewelry makers
Ya people are so lame when it comes to natural disasters/problems. When we had blackouts we got sooooo many calls and online orders. Like if your power isn’t on…. And you can’t make food…. We can’t make it either!!! And they’ll be so grumpy about it
When  a delivery driver fights with a customer about not tipping that is a leech
A couple big issues things John failed to cover:  The notion of a tip is subterfuge. It's an intentional misnomer. It's not a tip, it's a bid for service. They want more people ordering so they call it a tip so people think it's extra, it's not. Low and no tip orders are essentially like booking a plumber to fix your sink at their own expense. People also have it in their head that since it's a tip that they should base it off their order total, like they are in a restaurant, rather than basing it off mileage, weather, or that they live at the top floor of a maze-like apartment complex. These delivery drivers pay all their own expenses, gas, vehicle maintenance, and licensing and registration fees, etc. So in many cases due to the expense require to operate, drivers are actually loosing money on these low and no tip orders.  Then when people think they are generously tipping 25% on their $20 order, they fail to take into account the driver had to travel 20 miles round trip and that "generous" 25% tip didn't even cover the gas.   Additionally, the algorithm and driver metrics systematically exploit people. On doordash for example you have a metric called Acceptance Rating. The percentage of offers you accept or decline. They have certain tiers and drivers with lower acceptance ratings are less likely to get higher paying orders. So they are psychologically abusing people into taking low and no tip orders to keep their AR up so they can continue to supposedly get the better offers. But you can't get better offers if you're currently on an order so it makes no sense.  It's quite frankly disgustingly dystopian.
I lost about 68 seconds after he said " I am like miss Piggy the way I be hitting that green". Lol 😂😂😂
At this rate, the next video will be 'Late Night Talkshows' with John as the thumbnail
The delivery drivers won't even deliver unless they like what I've tipped them first. I just go get it myself.
It is almost like conservative minded business upstarts are trying to use our empathy against us. "Well if we just don't pay our employees we know people will feel bad and tip, ultimately paying more for the food and increasing our bottom line."   Leave it to greed, human nature and unregulated capitalism to F up a good thing.
Fuck these delivery apps.  The user definitely isnt getting a better deal.  My chipotle order costs like $12 more on doordash and thats pre tip.  And they fact that you're expected to tip before someone even picks up your food is bullshit.  And these delivery people take on multiple order across multiple services.  The one time I used doordash I watched my driver pickup my food and proceed to drive in the opposite direction and make two other stops in shopping centers , deliver those orders in other neighborhood and then deliver mine last even though it was the first one picked up.  That fucker got 1 star and I had doordash refund me for my cold ass food.    TLDR Fuck these apps
the people in the us need to stand up and go on demos to fight for their rights, that huge ass companies can't just do this kind of shit
Dasher Warbucks is in your neighborhood...
Tip culture in America is insane. I go to a cafeteria and I need to pay a tip for a muffin to go? Seriously America. What is wrong with you? Third world country.
I am too cheap to order with delivery. I only pick up the order by myself, eat in the restaurant, or cook at home.  I feel bad for people who take these jobs, because they don't make that much.
How is uber eats and grubhub so damn expensive yet they don't make a profit on this? I call bullshit and bet they are just pretending to run at a loss because they put every penny in marketing (which they could just stop) and fat salaries.
Thank you so much for bringing this to light!! I’m running for state Congress as a Democrat and if elected I want to do things to advance workers’ rights. This is great to know.
Gay parts should go to gay actors. What a load of rubbish to shoehorn in.
The last advice doesn't make any sense, so essentially multinational corporations with shitloads of money don't want to pay their employees, and it's my responsibility to pay 1) the restaurant 2) the additional charges that food delivery companies take from restaurants 3) the salary of the delivery person. And all these are somehow MY RESPONSIBILITY?!
I think we should be skeptical that these companies are not making profit. The company itself may not, but the CEOs are making hundreds of millions in stock options that they could be paying their workers
Im shocked people are willing to pay these fees. Most american are broke, what is going on
HA!!!   I just watched the newest Simpsons episode this weekend and they pretty much covered the same problems with this industry.  😀  The funny thing is that this episode of Last Week Tonight technically aired first (one week earlier), but the animation process and voice acting for the Simpsons episode probably started well before LWT did.  But what is great is that both shows could have been used together to support each other... much like the episode of Last Week Tonight that featured their own form of Thomas And Friends series with the Freight Trains.
So, your social security number is not for social security?
I work in a restaurant.  Sometimes we do $6,500 a day in togo food.  The drivers are looking more like homeless people.
I am not here to watch the video. I am here just to mention that this so-called liberal journalist joined the smear campaign against Julian Assange when it mattered.
Restaurants are better off offering 10 percent off if you call in for pick up than to pay off the commission fees.
Oliver misses the fact that in 2003, outside of downtown Manhattan or the loop in Chicago, really the only restaurants whose business models included food delivery were pizza joints. In all, but the biggest cities, foods like Thai, Indian, even burgers and fries were not a delivery options in 2003. Now that we have delivery apps, food from every restaurant in one’s area is available for door-to-door delivery, if that’s what you’re into.
Jobs were never intended to take care of people long-term we need better options for education in career fields unless one chooses they should not be out of their twenties past college age working for minimum wage there's a difference between a job and a career and we need better ways of integration from job to career
There's also the cost of the app store they're in! Apple and Google get their cut too
I ordered from Postmates for pickup once and when I got to the restaurant, they had no documentation of the order, nothing. I tried to get my money back from Postmates but couldn’t, and the restaurant wasn’t going to give me free food (understandably). That was my one and only experience with any of those apps, I don’t trust them at all.
I dont know how ppl afford to have things delivered. I live in NY and the delivery&service fees are min $12 and then I tip on top of that. That’s at least $22 added onto every single order. These 3rd party delivery systems suck!
23:22 Yeah you definitely need to "protect" people from being paid enough money to get by from working 10 hours on that job.
People who don't tip are DISGUSTING!! Yes, the worker chose that job and yes, it's not your fault that companies chose to have their consumers subsidize their employees wages. But you also chose to eat at that restaurant or order from that app knowing that you are expected to tip
Anytime a human offers you a service of convenience which is saving you gas (current price in Ca $5.30/ga), and saving you time (a delivery takes about 30 minutes), and protecting you from a possible accident (people on the roads now think there’s a restart button, and driving accordingly), you should tip with gratitude and appreciation. No gig worker is even remotely financially comfortable. We’re either living in our cars and trying to get through school…or living in our cars working 3 jobs…or living in our cars with trying to feed our kids. We are human beings who would LOVE to be able to eat as well as you are.  Please care. Make someone’s day. If you can’t surprise your driver with a great tip, at least cover a gallon of gas.
For those who love LastWeekTonight, the cryptocurrency $YGG [YGG Coin] is going UP right NOW and could have LIMITLESS money for all people here RIGHT NOW!
The "gay parts should go to gay actors" line re the peach was wasted on this audience 🤣
We use food delivery apps more and more so I’ve been really curious about this. Started asking my fav restaurants in the last year+ what their preference was when I wanted pickup at least. Thank you for covering this. I now realize how much more I can be doing. Thinking pickup more often over delivery.
Grubhub specifically seems to be the bottom feeder from this piece. Down with specifically Grubhub!🎉
Doordash ad at the start of this video lol
Stop saying you must tip. Companeis need to pay their employees. Stop shifting wage responsibility to customers. Tipping is an OPTIONAL GRATUITY for EXCEPTION service to show your appreciation if you CHOOSE to do so.
“You need to tip even more”, “you should only give 5 stars”. This show has always been a coercive mouthpiece for “progressive” socio-economic ideas but what a sham it’s becoming lately.
I'm too lazy to cook for myself, but i can always just go to a restaurant.  But what if I'm too fuckin lazy to go to a restaurant?
No, I just refuse to use those apps altogether. I’m in tech so I know this is a pipe dream and will have to end. I’m sorry for the people who mistakenly signed up to do the deliveries and depend on it for a living. My advice: switch job now before it’s too late. I’m not going to use it, tip the delivery guy and prop up this shitty system and in the meantime these guys pay lobbyists with what little revenue they have to erode workers rights even more. F*** these apps.
I'm sorry, but how is this "subsidy" for anyone from those companies, if I can jump into a bus and drive from airport to the city for something like 3$, vs. jumping into Uber or Lyft for 50$ ? 😆
Etsy does the same thing, had to shut my store down because they take such a huge cut
Skype was bought by Microsoft and rebranded as Microsoft Teams. It fueled work-from-home during the pandemic, and it continues to facilitate remote work.
The devil doesn't play the fiddle well in that song. Everyone with a musical background knows that he's doing trick work rather than creating a composition or showing off any skills.  It's kind of delightful that the majority of people prefer the devil's music, which is literally just a trick to genuinely skilled music. Kind of plays into the narrative seamlessly.
The other day I was driving Uber. I accidentally had my Uber eats option on top of driving passengers. The orders I received (which I declined and quickly turned off) were a joke. $6 to pick up PF Chang's on a 30+ minute trip. That's ridiculous! Now if it was $10+ it might be decent. However, ultimately, when you are working deliveries, there's so much lost time and gas on the road that it's not worth it when a delivery is under $10. No matter how quick and short distance the app thinks the order is which creates the price.
The companies are losing money, but can spend $15m in California to lobby... Smart business sense there.  The companies have to be profitable, they can afford to buy out these smaller companies and the CEOs and other higher ups at the company are making millions and they are spending millions per year on advertising.
Baseball is actually very interesting seeing a sport industry trying to figure out sports… (with FIFA just in a field of oil money). At least they named the sport “football” correctly… comparably to “American “Football””.  *Possible thought piece*
We should be focused on the fact that people are simply working too much. You work too much, they shove delivery services in your face.
no more orders from me!!!!!!!!!!
the big picture reason behind the issues (restaurant and driver pay) is that these companies simply aren't well-run.  they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on R & D, the budget of a AAA video game, just to upkeep their shitty app.  that's a huge problem for all parties involved, driven by the fact that their growth was not fueled by being the best cost-effective well-run companies, but instead by VC firms shelling out millions to whomever had the best sales pitch and coolest looking graphics
Not only tip well, but tip direct cash in hand whenever practical.
Will never use one of these apps. Not worth it
Sorry, no I have never used a delivery app and I will not ever.  After watching a video with a grub hub employee explaining that you should never take an order with a tip less than $20.   IM NOT TIPPING ANYONE  100%- 200%.  Tipping in this country is completely out of control and abusive.
Or we could cook at home? It's an ecosystem that is being driven by the consumer. If the consumer did not use the services in large numbers, it would fail completely. The reason it exists is because many people choose to not organize their lives to prioritize preparing the majority of their meals. The amount of waste that people create through eating out and using delivery apps is one of the biggest drains on personal income when most consumers could retain 50% of their food cost monthly if they did not use them. That easily turns into thousands of dollars per year annually. You just have to produce some labor in time, planning, and cooking. Food delivery should be relegated to limited use.
I want the people to know that tips are also being removed from orders after the delivery is complete. So you think you’re getting a tip and accept the order based on the total amount you perceive you’ll make. Then after the delivery is made they will change it to zero 🤯 Don’t know how these people sleep at night!
As a Instacart shopper in the past, I can confirm that they don’t care about their contractors and it wasn’t just a side hustle - it was driving hundreds of miles every week, carrying heavy orders while being penalized for heavy order pay, and managing your own expenses, health care, etc
It's the timer on the delivery that causes delivery partners to rash drive. It's common to use two-wheelers, bikes, motorcycles, scooters here in India and they often drive on the wrong side or jump traffic lights it's so frustrating and dangerous. I don't want my delivery partner toughing it out just to meet incentives on the app. It's a big problem
I used to be a regular user of these apps but they have gotten unbelievably out of control with their prices, in my are some items are more than double the price through the app. For example a mchicken or mcdouble is $2 if you go to the store or $5 through the app and the customer service is disgusting and the are thieves
I cook all my food, that's the way we were raised and I don't even eat pre-made food in the microwave. Helps that I also went to culinary school but.... meh
Rating systems could be their own video.  The bean counters at the company look at 4 and below as a complete failure, while some people never give above 4 stars, because, "nobody is perfect!"
Please make a video on Indian current politics you coward Journalist.
blah, never ordered anything and wil not. I just go and pick it up myself..
The rating system on these side gig apps are awkward at best, predatory at worst.
I don't know why but I thought he would bring up Futurama's devil violin scene
I have always used them when I’m sick and can’t go out to get the otc meds/hydration I need and it’s incredibly helpful for being in a rush and needing breakfast delivered to work. I really want this to work out for the drivers and restaurants/stores.
Thank you for this. This is the kind of stuff people outside of the food service industry never hear about. My restaurants was listed against our will by GrubHub and we actually could not get them to unlist us. They flat out refused. They would come in to try and pick up take out orders and we would literally yell at them to get out.
As a Grub hub driver. Im here to tell you i dont care about your food at all if your tip is lesd then 5 dollars. I m not a nasty person im not gonna do anything to it. If your ice cream has to wait while i deliver another order so be it. If im doing Instacart and Grubhub same time your ish may be cold. $ 50 worth of food 20 tip....i drop every thing to do that.  3 on 20 you will get it soon enough.
Not sure if written ur on script,but GOOD WORK
Doordash might charge 50% more than Grubhub, but Grubhub you're lucky if the driver didn't steal your soda, drink it in front of you and say, "There was no soda." Yet you ordered a soda just to put the order above the $10 minimum order LOL true story.
@10:11 What is wrong with Kramer lmao
Finally, someone has the courage to say what we have ALL been thinking about “The Devil Went Down to Georgia.” Thank you, John. Thank you for your courage.
I’ve never used the apps. My friends do. I and other friends were visiting, so they placed a huge order. App guy leaves food on front steps, rings bell and leaves. Guess what? More than $50 is missing. I asked if they were going to call the restaurant or app company. “No, they won’t do anything” Meaning they’ve gone though this before. Fool me once, shame on me, but…
Please, Please, please . Do not tip trough apps they underpay drivers with your tip. Tip is a culture ,tip in cash as our parents did ,face to face on hand and dont forget to smile 😊 its only way to avoid apps keep stealing honest and sacrified drivers
It's all well and good that Oliver wants to stand up for gig workers getting healthcare. (Who wouldn't want that?). But we all know that if the delivery companies had to carry that, it would be the end of the independent food delivery industry entirely. (Food costs are already beyond absurd).
Escaped evangelical up breaking and found happiness🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️  Sir your logic is a fallacy

Nobody made anyone be a delivery person right?
i liked the foodapps during corona but even that is still more costly per dish than just ordering from grocery-services with their own delivery and yeah maybe heating up that pizza in my own oven sometimes. Though it might be easier here than in the usa where everything seems to be a bit controversial 🥲
Nahhh not an Asian brother talking about orphanages....smh as an Asian adoptee that hurts
And this is even before adding AI to the mix.
I will never again use these apps. $15 delivery fee for an $8 meal?  I'd rather risk the DUI.
Totally would not order from 99% of the places without the food apps. It use to be just pizza and Chinese. It sucks they take 50% of the sale but I would have never been a customer in the first place if not for the app.
Almost spit out my bite of cereal. Orphanages?!?!!?? I did not see that one coming. I have to be careful eating while watching Last Week Tonight.
I hate delivery apps. I'd much rather put pants on and get the food myself. At least then I can look the order over in the store and bring up any issues, in person, before the food has left the store. Hell, the first time I ordered UberEats I had a $70 sushi order get stolen by the driver. Was waiting outside for them and everything. Said they couldn't find the place, when it's clearly marked.  Unless you're drunk, stoned, or otherwise unable to go outside there's no reason to use a delivery app.
“Grub Hub”: always thought the name seemed shady
I am proud to say I have never used any food delivery app.
Order directly from restaurants, and book directly with hotels.
"Nobody gives a care about the fate of labor as long as they can get their instant gratification." - Squidward Tentacles
With millions of migrants pouring into the country you can expect these apps to grow. Thanks politicians.
I agreee with a lot of this but the negative reviews are probably there for legal reasons to help keep weirdos off the apps. We’ve all heard a few horror stories and they don’t want to be found guilty of negligence.
its better then what you are doing, they created tons of ways ppl to get a bit of money where you do nothing but work for the ppl who push ads.
The orphanage line f’n killed me 😂
Delivery apps also alter menu prices of restaurants. This is why I order directly through the restaurant websites and pick up my own orders.
Thank you and your team John for addressing this ❤
Orphanages haven’t exist on the US for almost 100 years
I never use delivery apps. And when I used delivery and find out if a delivery app person comes to drop it off I tend not to choose delivery from that restaurant. I find it not hygienic to have strangers delivering than from the store.
I will say something that really frustrated me when people started looking at Gig workers and raising issues about how they were considered independent contractors, and how horrible that is; was that I had for the longest time worked in an industry, the visual effects industry, where many many workers were and still are treated exactly the same way.  No one cares about them though.
"Value their time more than money" - how the heck does that even work? How does that SENTENCE even work?  Value IS money.  That's what we mean when we "value" something.  We compare it to money IE value.  You can't value your time more than money tech bro because you value it WITH money.
Well, we can go by your 2010s date and think that before that the only foid delivery services that existed were those provided by restaurants. But there was a kid in Jenkintown, Pensilvania, named Geoff Schwartz, who launched his own independent (i.e. not operated by restaurants) food delivery service sometime back in the 1980s (except he and some of his friends did the job instead of farming it out to "independent contractors", and it was run via phone and pager instead of apps).  And, yes, I took this from The Goldbergs, but, remember, there's evidence on that very show that this actually happened.
I couldn't help but notice John said "mahfia" not "maafia" - the corruption continues!
these companies dont make money, but thats not the point. typical businesses need to, but these companies only exist to raise their stock prices. its for market speculation and nothing else.
driving for these apps outside of california is so awful. 120% of min wage, paid for time worked, health insurance subsidy... where are your advocates?
The uprising of delivery apps will come soon. Stop ordering food from these places
The root of the problems with these big companies is that they thrive based on share values instead of actually being functional and profitable. If investors get all or part of the company profits, most of these issues will disappear. Instead of that, we got these paper wall companies that dont actually provide a reasonably valued service or profitable product but promise a perceived value to boost their share value long enough to kill off competetors and then the hooked consumers get to suffer
Delivery driving wasn’t great before these apps either. They got paid like server (also a problem) so equally relied on tips. Gas and maintenance of their car was not covered by the company and if the customer wasn’t happy with the food it often came out of the drivers wages.   Whenever possible, just order pickup and go get it. Better for everyone.
I'm so glad for not having the budget these last couple of years to use these "services"
I agree with this video, ban all these apps and pick up your own damn food
I had a GrubHub driver OPEN THE FRONT DOOR of my house without knocking/ringing and COME INTO MY HOUSE
Why do people work this then.
“You may have noticed food often costs more on an app than in the restaurant” I certainly have, as well as noticed what a massive understatement that is. Food always costs more on an app. Then add the delivery costs and fees and taxes, additional taxes on delivery fees, then the tip on top of the usual auto gratuity. And it’s easily almost always at least double the cost.
John, it was a fiddle contest, not a battle of the bands. The Devil charmed you.
John I love you but please don’t spread that bs about gay parts to gay actors. That kind of thinking actually harms the lgbtq community. It pigeonholes queer actors and it makes people think they’re entitled to know how every actor identifies. they’re not. Roles should go to the best person for the job.
The price for these delivery companies is very high on the backend. It's very high.
I do delivery apps, mainly uber, but yeah its great this week I worked a little over 80 hours and made almost 10 bucks an hour (before expenses of course) and I'm thinking about taking a day off this month (last day off was in September of 2023) the freedom is great. And yes I'm very stupid for continuing to do this with all the BS that comes with it but the 30k in debt I've accumulated for car repairs, medical bills and paying bills with credit cards when deliveries get slow, makes it hard to switch careers.  Id also like to thank all the wonderful customers that order food at 2:30 AM and don't leave their porch light on, I mean spending 3 cents so I can see and not reinjure my torn ACL in my right knee, you sure showed me what for.  I also really appreciate the tip baiting. Because I totally would have accepted your order and drove 32 miles for the 3 dollars uber paid me, the 20 dollar tip you gave up front then zeroed out after delivery, that was nice, I should totally have to pay to deliver your food.
I always tip them directly, in germany it is known that lieferando didn't always pay out the tips. So they get them tax free directly on their hand.  And check first if you can call them directly, sometimes they got own drivers and then you can rule out the app payments/fees for you and them.
18:20 Sucks that happened to that guy, but is it really Grubhubs fault he ran a red light? I almost never see anyone on a bicycle stop at stoplights or signs. That’s just a bicycle thing, share the road but don’t follow its rules…
I don't think that tipping is going to solve the problem. It puts on the consumer the responsibility to "pay wages". I think instead we should put this responsibility completely on the employer. If we stop tipping they will have to pay their employees more
Cool…I was wondering how I was going to fund my robot orphanage.
That's the problem with gig economy. Hey, these guys aren't our employees
Maybe people don't have money burning in their pockets to pay tips.

This was just an ad for grubhub. Just placed an order.
Sadly, these do not deliver to my village, just outside a big town. But my waistline appreciates this.
There used to be restraint delivery services back in the 90’s but they went out of business after a few years. So why would they think that it now it would be successful?
His race horse obsession wouldn’t even work on a $52,000,000 250 GTO
184.340.890 US$ / 12 M = 15.361.740 US$/M / 30 d/M =  512.058 US$/d / 24 h / d = 21.335 US$ / h ... so they spent 21.335 US$ an hour, which is  a third (? - sorry, I am European) of an annual salary, to be exempt from worker protection law? Okay ...
tip culture is a cancer   I consider it a moral obligation not to tip. Why should customers supplement the pay employees should already be getting? It creates a bad incentive, and some of the insanity with tipping we're seeing today. I saw someone on reddit today share a text from his landlord that said other tenants have tipped him for being a nice landlord. The shit is getting way out of hand
The 3 L's , 1981,2008,2020.
Think of a tip as an offer for service, not a favor.  Understand that, when driver gets several orders in a row, the gig app doesn't pay them for each. They pay the while time/mileage for each order, only for the distance from one drop to the next. For each of the additional orders, the tip essentially becomes they only pay they get for that order.  For the love of physics, don't order prepared frozen confections (cups/cones/cakes from Coldstone, Marble Slab, Baskin Robbins etc.) for delivery through apps. That milkshake or concrete from Shakes Shack just isn't going to be what you hope for by the time someone has driven it and walked it to your door, even when they use their good cold bags.  People who drive/ride/walk using these apps are small business owners using the platform to connect to customers. The apps, unfortunately don't really exist to do that. They app models as the exist don't allow customers to individually reward good service or for delivery people to build customer bases. There  is no way for customers to request specific delivery people they trust.   As a person who chooses to delivery I will PAY for access to a platform that exists purely to connect people who need the service of on-demand, local* delivery and is not a merketing data mine or IPO scheme.
Never used those services, never will. I remember that scene from that great movie "Wall-E" where what was left of humanity was strutting about in space on literally a big cruise ship laid out on lounge chairs, fat as f..., slurping their meals thorugh a straw. We are surely destined to end up like that. Not in space, but fat and immobile, probably having our food served intravenously.
He's the best
9:40 This is a ridiculous and absurd complaint. Someone might breathe on your food if they deliver it? First off, who the fk cares. 2nd, do employees also sneeze sometimes and does that air float around or does physics work different in the food industry?   There are legitimate complaints about food delivery apps, but this is actually retarded in the truest sense of the word. Develop your mind so you don't say thoughtless crap like this   What really pisses me off about stuff like this is it makes the real arguments watered down with emotionally provocative trite
Restaurant apps good. I don't want to call and try to explain my order to someone on the other end of a telephone call that sounds so poor that the technology powering it must still be from the 1950s rather than 2024. At least if I order from an app, that's one less step where my order can be misunderstood and screwed up. Restaurants, if you still expect me to call instead of letting me order online, you're losing my business. It's 2024, get with the times, calling is for boomers.  Bollocks to the gig economy picking it up and charging me way more while still expecting me to tip after, though. I'll pick it up myself.
John loves america's tipping culture 🤦
Where I live, Uber eats allows separate rating of the delivery rider and the restaurant. This way, the customer is given the space to reiew and rate separately.
Well, of course they dont turn a profit when you literally pay half the revenue as bonus to the CEO
So after the Seattle rollout this year of the NYC style min wage requirements, I will say: you don’t have to tip us. The previous system of accepting only well-paying orders based off upfront tips has been replaced by the new customer fees which correlate to a much higher driver base pay. The orders we take are now a decent wage, they come out to about 25ish an hour. But tips are always appreciated! 😘  I mention this bc the hike in customer fees along with the assumption that tips are still mandatory has cratered the market here for the moment. But it’s just a shift away from tip culture. Drivers aren’t being shafted by the apps as much now, and a more realistic cost of labor is being presented to the customer. The apps are making less money here now but lol fuck those guys.

Serving breakfast/lunch/dinner becomes a game of chance or favoritism, or rank, or years serving at the hash house, humble or pretentious. A slick dinner server can take home serious coin. That same Sharpie moves on when the house cools down and a new hash house opens. Who works breakfast? Folks busting tail for cheap tips given with genuine love--seriously. Like relatives, full of love and nickel-and-dime cheap. Especially now, most places have computer systems that can break down costs, labor, and the whole ball of wax. None of that will give a metric to wiggle out of what to pay the gorsh-darn help! I pay for the "help." They are my staff, not our guests. I find someone who has got things down to the sort of professionalism I'm looking for and I pair them up to raise everyone's standards to theirs..and hopefully higher. You see, pride sneaks into this mixture, this soup. If there is going to be any drama, people who just aren't up to standard rarely go quietly. It's important to reassure the people who are still there because they Are Superior. I'm just as proud as they are. Change is not bad. It's life. It is why we are here. [at this point, we should mob the kitchen and demand they make something good to eat, then we'll service. This is also why, other than prep, I have breaks between services. It's a family thing between my restaurant relatives. But I have to look at this as a business person. It's a calculated dollar investment that pays off in a staff that knows how we make money, why, and how they can impact the bottom line.
Restaurants aren't always so innocent though. The one i worked for was booming with food orders. All the money made from them went into expanding the owner's bar. While the actual cooks were being paid minimum wage, had holes in kitchen floor, and a hot water heater tank leaking. The owner was well aware and did nothing. Safety comes last for some.
I am kinda surprised John didn't mention that the number of gig jobs has been growing rapidly and don't exist in just food delivery or Uber. He also doesn't mention that nearly 50% of gig workers are menials. But yeah, it's only going to get worse, corporations need to make investors happy above everything else so they will happily convert any and every job they can to a gig model or any model that lets them get away with not paying people a fair wage for their labor.
Grubhub just pumping up stock price. Or at least increasing executive compensation.
In addition to crazy high budget on marketing and lobbying, the singe largest expenditure for these delivery app companies is their tech workers' salaries. Fix that.
I'm sorry but "5 stars across the board" is not the solution  Learn something from Indians apps like Zomato and Swiggy They ask customers for two ratings for every order You rate the delivery and the restaurant separately  The driver did their job perfectly but the food is bad, you give them different ratings This sounds like a simple enough solution that these American brands can fix
Still have never use a delivery system

Tipping is not a practice in most part of the world as it is taken care by humane minimum wages unlike the capitalist America. Tipping is to make sure that the worker has gone extra or beyond their normal work.
What a massive disappointment. 5 months into a genocide, over 30K deaths, and instead of doing deep dives on weapons manufacturing and AIPAC, and all you have is one video from 4 months ago? Fuck... what a massive disappointment.
I started shopping for instacart when my job shut down in 2020. The minimum batch pay was $7 plus tips. They lowered the batch pay, group orders, and make it an inconvenient service for both the shoppers and customers.
😂
fuck tipping culture. I'm over it. Companies need to pay living wages. living wages now are 30+/hr maybe even more in populated cities. pay your workers.
I canceled both doordash and instacart. Sadly, I've kept Walmart+. It's just the reality that they can absorb the cost of delivery without doing crazy shit to my wallet.
Tipping should never be mandatory!!!! Neither the apps or the restaurant owners are good employers.
Be like Japan and don't tip,why should you be paid more to do your job.
Raw dogging the air! 🤣🤣🤣
I tried Postmates once because it was advertised on a popular podcast and there was some deal. With the promotion, it cost me more than if I had just called the place and paid myself an extra $30 to drive the 1.5 miles to pick it up. I deleted the app after that and have only used DoorDash a couple of times since then. I hate all these community killing apps
the fact that people are soo blatantly stupid  and easy to decieve is super problematic such a bill like prop 22 never should of been passed but your average  american refuses to do 5 mins of independant research on anything they just consume at face value
If John really is baked he has a lot of energy.
The Tip culture is terrible. It just obfuscates the actual cost of the product to the consumer and the actual pay to the worker. It only benefits the company. The whole point is that you can trick someone into eating a meal that turns out to be 20% more expensive than the prices on the menu and trick an employee into thinking that if they just do a good enough job then they'll make limitless riches. The company makes bank until the employees wise up and leave, then there's always someone else hoping to make it.  I tip well but I've heard/seen people leave no tip too many times to think most these workers arent getting screwed.  I would much rather the company just charge more and the types that would stiff the waiter might just learn how to cook, but probably not.
John is America's most valuable investment.
Tipping is a voluntary "fee" that customers can choose to give or not, at any level they may choose.
Door dash gig work is another form of slave labor.
And yet the founders are all billionaires
I do DoorDash.  I have 12,000+ deliveries and 150,000 miles driven.  DoorDash literally pays $2 to $3 per delivery, regardless of mileage.  We literally live on tips.  Oh the best part, if you get 2 orders at once, the base doesn't increase, it's still $2 to $3 dollars.
Wtf would you pay 2x the amount to get cold food and tip a gross stranger for the privilege lol
Spain passed a law that forces platforms to recognize food delivery drivers as employees
Tipping is illogical. Why should customers be subsidizing a restaurant worker's wages instead of management paying its own workers like any other industry?
During the pandemic, I suggested we have some food delivered and my husband decided to go out and get it instead. He felt it a great reason to get out of the house and got the money where it needed to be. We concentrated on local eateries that we had always frequented and felt we were helping to preserve the local economy. This episode only verified we chose correctly.

Can you do aquaculture next? I have a paper due.
I leave 4 stars every time some idiot leaves my food directly in front of the screen door that swings *out* (when there's a perfect bag-sized space next to the door), threatening to knock it off the edge of the step unless I try and snake through the smallest of openings. Otherwise, generally 5 stars. If you can't be assed to think about where to put things, I can't be assed to give you 5 stars. Do better.
As the journalist says at [21:43], the delivery apps seem too good to be true because they aren't charging what the service really costs. And as much of the segment points out, this is because the model is broken by design, abusing both workers and even restaurants. While I certainly empathize with the delivery workers deserving fair compensation, the right way to go about this is not to rely on tips. That allows the delivery apps to continue neglecting a key component of the business model (ie. labor costs) while putting that load on the customers in a non-transparent way.  It would seem like we have the technology to figure this out. Navigation software can typically give a decent estimate for travel time. That can be multiplied by the desired target wage with adjustments for other conditions (eg. weather, unusually large orders, etc.) and profit. So in the case of that single slice of cake delivery, if the bike route for that was 45 minutes and the delivery worker was to be paid $20/hr, then the delivery fee could be $15 ($20/hr x 0.75 hrs). The customer knows up front that they are going to pay for that slice of cake, and the delivery worker gets paid what they worked out with their employer.
they also did the same thing with cell phones. In order to compete with landlines cell phone plans started at around $20. Now what are they...
I once ordered a pizza during a blizzard. See you in hell .....
25:54  , your welcome.
It’s really hard to give a decent tip and a 5-star review when the drivers a dick or just flat out ignores your instructions
OH my god the amount of business I had to handle during a HURRICANE here in Mobile.  Like what did all those people buy up all the bread and milk for, if they were just going to order delivered food?  -And no, I don't mean in the days after the storm, while they wait to have their power turned back on so they can cook; I mean DURING THE PEAK OF THE STORM, like it's a fuh king fun event and they want pizza and wings to celebrate.  -ZE-RO care about the fact that someone is going to have to drive through it.
I visited relatives in Brooklyn and we still used the old model of calling the restaurant directly from a paper takeout menu!
Why am I not allowed to enjoy Harry Potter? Is it because JK Rowling said... [checks notes]... completely reasonable and sane things about biology being real?
I wonder which writer saw the CollegeHumor Skype CEO video for that joke. Love Brennan Lee Mulligan.
What upsets me is how food delivery apps are allowed to misclassify those who use the app as independent contractors.  Independent contractors would be able to set the proce themselves, rather than having the price set by the developer of the app.
I deleted all restaurant delivery apps and lowered my LDL cholesterol to 77. No lie.
The prices aren’t even low and they still don’t make money lmao. I swear I ended up paying almost double whenever I tried to order something off one of these garbage apps. Never use them anymore, just not worth it when I can just drive myself to the restaurant or use in house delivery
I haven't gotten the feeling that the customer is winning in this exchange. In addition to the food costing more (if the delivery companies aren't making a profit, they need to axe their executives (preferably literally)), there's now zero accountability for bad service.  I've been on all sides of this exchange, as a delivery app worker, a restaurant employee, and a food orderer. If the wrong food gets delivered, the food is wholly or partially missing, or the food is cold/takes forever to arrive, the restaurant will blame the delivery person and the delivery company will blame the restaurant or just shrug and say better luck next time. I didn't deliver for long enough to see how getting poor reviews would affect my ability to get orders, but based on my more experiences working in a restaurant and ordering food, there will always be more bad delivery drivers to take the place of any that stop working due to bad reviews.  The only solution I see is for local restaurants to go back to hiring their own delivery drivers (and they won't need 15 either unless they're delivering thousands of orders every hour). To do this they will have to get over the idea that their employees have to be working at 100% capacity 100% of the time. Skeleton crews increase mistakes, cause burnout, cause worse service, and force employees to work sick. It's a cutthroat market and labor is expensive, but so is throwing money at an objectively worse option via delivery apps.
I will say I manage a restaurant in Austin, TX and most drivers don’t speak English (don’t have a problem with that) but they come in and just put their phone in your face and get very irate if it’s not ready waiting for them
I did DoorDash for a bit but one day I was delivering a Chipotle burrito to a huge apartment complex with no information about where it was or gate code or building number. I left it on top of the box where you enter the gate code and took a picture. Last delivery I made. Oh yea and it was for 4.34 cents (DoorDash tells you what your going to make for the trip and if you decline the offer too many times you get booted anyway)
I went to the so-called best sushi restaurant in San Francisco and had to wait 90 minutes for a rainbow roll because the restaurant was prioritizing Doordash orders. They only gave me my order when they realized that the three tables around my table had finished, paid and cleared out while I was still waiting for my order.  I got a free bottle of sake out of it, but would rather have gotten my order when the other people in my party got their food.
I hope he talks about all the illegal immigrants who are doing these food delivery jobs and taking the jobs from us Americans who would like to have these orders and deliver. Not being racist. Just saying citizen jobs are decreasing.
I feel better about not ever using a delivery app. I feel bad for the delivery drivers and restaurants.
Wait, are delivery app workers not paid by the app? Is it like a restaurant? Would have been really useful to cover on this one.
I gotta be real, I'm not fully informed on all the caveats, but we need to address the 'independent contractor' loophole that so many companies abuse in the US. If the person doesn't need to create an LLC or register a business to do the work, you are employing them, full or part-time, and they NEED to be legally entitled to some manner of employee protection. In some states independent contractors get taxed like they're business owners, too, which further cuts into the absolute shit pay and is completely moronic. These models rely on the exploitation of the most vulnerable people, and our government hasn't shown an interest (save for places like New York and California) in actually addressing these issues.
Do away with tips. Pay a livable wage
13:30 - Shush, John.  Stop giving venture capitalists ideas.
1. not tipping 2. not everyone lives in ny
There were a few companies like this so far back in time the Internet wasn't really available to enable them, you called them on the phone; Tampa Bay had one with what I think was the best name ever:  Dine-One-One.
I cannot stress enough, how glad I am that John Oliver is still available to me on YouTube. I will never subscribe to HBO for the sole purpose of watching something that for so many years has been free. And I also greatly appreciate Mr. Oliver‘s own opinion on the subject.
Money on the buy: Everything must be sold before purchasing: retail standards  culinary standards, same applies but that product is perishable. Mom and pop shops that are taking the hit each week, these apps create movement. Nothing is for free.  The industry is tough.
Fuck tipping culture.!

When I was working as a server, post pandemic, we were working with half the staff. On Monday and Tuesday nights, I was a server, also seating customers, answering the phone , and acting as manager at a sit-down restaurant. When the food delivery people would come in, they had to wait until I had a break taking care of my actual customers and sometimes they'd become rude and impatient. I eventually became impatient myself and began reminding them that people used to pick up their own orders.and I GOT TIPPED! So, basically.screw you. Wait.
The reason why Uber, which is not profitable either is still pumping billions of dollars into the company is because of one thing. Automation. Once that technology makes a driver obsolete presto the infrastructure is already well-established. I forget who or where I heard it from, but it was someone that knew..
Why do we tip?
This was important but I feel like it should have talked about ghost kitchens tooo
4/7/2024
A neighborhood longtime favorite hamburger place that had survived the pandemic, got plenty of walk-in customers, and served great food had started using grubhub for their call-in orders. Couple months later, after we begrudgingly used them one day, it got our food late, wrong, and the delivery guy pretended not to understand that we wanted some cash back from a $51. order paid with a $100.  Said he had change in his car, then got in his car and drove away.  Next day, after trying to report to g-hub then not wanting to be fooked further, we called the restaurant to let them know. Literally no answer at 4:00 in the afternoon. Next day, answered with a message that said it was temporarily closed. By the weekend it was closed forever. It had survived the pandemic, but apparently it didn't survive grubhub. Doordash was worse. Using them for groceries brought us produce they wouldn't have found in the store's compost grinder. Also shelf products the store didn't offer. Driver flung it on the porch and ran. We believe they pillaged the bins behind the food bank. Still a mystery.
Using a food delivery service, you ABSOLUTELY tip.  Ordering a to go order and picking it up myself...DON'T ASK ME FOR A TIP
I used to work for a now defunct delivery service as an area leader. My job included a ton of responsibilities, but I essentially served as a connection between the independent contractors and the company itself.   These companies are WAY more evil than people realize. The companies blur the line as close as possible between employee and contractor.   I've been screaming about the evils of these companies for over half a decade.   This episode doesn't even scratch the surface. This is really the best of their worst behavior.
You’re about 15 years late
Oddly enough the whole “taking orders for companies that don’t have a partnership with them” thing has been happening at the Joann I’ve been working at. We keep getting door dashers who are there to pick up and order that hasn’t even hit our system yet. Also most of them walk in and try to just take the order without letting us make sure it’s theirs and Joann required we see them with the confirmation number and last name of the order neither of which door dash has
Pray to God that you never ever get a job that require tipping to make ends meet.
I know cash is a 4-letter word, but keep a bunch of cash in an envelope by the front door and tip your drivers well from it. Uber/Lyft drivers don't take cash but I've never had a delivery person (or cabbie) refuse or look unhappy about a nice cash tip.
Except before the apps, the only thing that could be delivered was pizza unless you lived downtown in a huge city
I would never use this service.  Who knows what these people will do with the food.  Not worth it.  If I can't go get it, I don't go out.
I understand that the delivery drivers are getting fucked. I always tip between 50% and 100% of minimum wage for an hour, 5-15$ usually per delivery. My point of view...if im their only delivery this hours. I want to ensure they get  at least the bare minimum pay they'd otherwise received at a different  job
There is nothing wrong with ordering doordash during bad weather. If they don't want to deliver then they don't have to take the order. If they take the order than they value the money more than they do about not having to deal with the weather.
My wife got sprayed by a skunk delivering for Instacart once.
Whenever I ordered fries they were missing or 1/2 eaten and never complained. Just too damn expensive
As a former restaurant worker I try not to use these Apps cuz I want any tip to go to restaurant workers.  This piece gives many more reasons for everyone to try to use less if at all.
This more than anything is making me want to stop using food delivery apps.
I’ve delivered for uber and for the restaurants themselves. Hands down made more consistent money at the restaurants. After I learned my area I was a beast. Uber eats sends you all over the metropolitan area, which makes it hard to be efficient. Also the restaurants give you free food most the time and that was a nice perk.
Businesses escaped Yelp and then got Door Dash as a parting gift
Not only does the restaurant pay those fees but you pay like 1/3 more. But beyond that, they are run by gypsy elite and are basically money laundering outlets - on top of the other ridiculousness. because ... greed.
Don't be lazy, go out to a restaurant or cook your own meals.
If only we had unions the world would be a perfect place right? Capitalism is bad right? Bah he used to hide this better or I was more naive, probably me
The Devil is just playing a tremoloed upward glissando, displaying no fiddling talent whatever.  Johnny destroys him.  Playing traditional songs is a hallmark of the musical style of fiddle music, and Johnny crushes them. I could go on...
Yeah ordering DD costs me about $20 more than picking it up myself and that is without a tip.
I am an Uber driver and I think it's crazy that only about 20% of people actually tip. If I give 30 rides in a day, maybe 6 people tip. Doesn't matter if I am the nicest person in the world, or if I make extra stops, no tip. And this is in Las Vegas, the tipping capital. I am scared to think what other people are going through.
Don't believe these gig apps when they say they're losing money. They're not. They're carrying that loss on paper for tax reasons, and then spending the money on R&D for new delivery programs. The latest one is person to person delivery. Not sure about anyone else, but I don't want to be a drug mule.
First off: maybe there should be an effort to pay service work re normally instead of pushing this tipping culture.   Anyone here should check out Modern MBAs video on food delivery. He has his own experience with food delivery, which makes his case study of food delivery globally that much better
the reason they don't make money is cause they spend too much on marketing and useless employees
many companies no longer have drivers they just have someone from door dash pick up your food. I called Papa johns the other day and they delivered it with Uber eats
That's not a nice way to talk about Boostedboiz
Greed and cruelty are the end game.
Could these delivery apps be considered a pyramid scheme?
Yes lets stop tipping and increase the MW.....that makes so much sense.  Who cares about logic and econimcs 😂😂😂
Late stage capitalism=monopoly=bad
I remember buying a Skype number and year of service for like 30 bucks for a year.
I think delivery apps and the middleman economy with restaurants help with racism. Many people would otherwise be refused service, get worse service, including waiting much longer. The best chefs cook the best no matter who's eating it but that's not the world we live in.
To be honest, the fees are high for the customers considering the price if you just go to the restaurant yourself, and considering you have to put a decent tip. The convenience is staying home, but then not really because sometimes the order is wrong or the driver opens your food. So to be honest, I already hate using these apps and if I don't have time to go to a restaurant then I will eat something at home. The only delivery services I have had consistently good experience with are insta cart (I can order something to cook from the grocery store and the fees really are reasonable) or Walmart plus. Getting groceries this way is incredibly convenient and worth the money to me. Getting food from restaurants (edit: through Grub hub, Door dash, or Uber Eats) is hit or miss and expensive and I hate it. Door Dash is the worst of the three but I have had bad experiences with all three.
This is basically what the r/antiwork subreddit is all about, but it got decimated by right wing agitprop.
Just came to comment because I can’t watch this video without flying into a rage. I do a lot of DoorDash, I have a shitty job and always need the extra money. Things have gotten so bad recently, people who don’t tip are making it worse. My life is so much harder right now because I do this. Fuck DoorDash, fuck UberEats, fuck customers who don’t tip, and FUCKKKK the executives.
Skype was bought by Microsoft so I don't know wtf John is talking about here
I never use these apps anyway. Cook at home. Get rid of tipping, people are tired of it and those they have to tip!
I will never tip. PAY your workers and do I really need to put hospital and sick leave on her as well.
NICE TRY LOL.. ENJOY THE F*CKIN6 YEARS, BRATS
This advice given in this video is to what... Increase tipping and lie about food reviews because it's our responsibility to make sure someone doesn't get fired from a greedy corporate conglomerate? Fuck that and fuck no.   While you're at it, why not tell me how it's my fault global warming is a thing and there's pollution everywhere because I didn't take the little plastic ring off the water bottle, while you stand in front of a smoke stack to shame me. Wtf is this logic.  It's the governments job to make sure it's people are cared for, not McDonalds or GrubHub, and certainly not random people on the Internet.
OMG.  How much I love you.
Nice episode! how about making an episode about doctors shortage in the US and how international medical doctors who are US citizens or legal US residents barely make their way in the US to work as certified physicians
bros just mad he still have to post youtube videos to make money. also prolly mad he cant gett a permanent visa
23:47 Camilla Parker Balls looks like a horse! 😀
This is disgusting and it must be regulated. Thankfully I have never ordered via such service. Usually we pick it up ourselves or use the delivery service of the restaurant.
As a Californian, I'm embarrassed and disgusted that Prop 22 passed. We're endlessly attacked as "socialist" and "Kommiefornia," but then you see this bullshit happen.   When you have hundreds of millions to spend on an election, it's easy to dupe the populace.
In NY, the fees are so ridiculous that we only order from one of these apps when there’s a coupon large enough to offset all the fees…and even then, the food is still so damn expensive…sometimes, to save a little money, we just go pick it up ourselves.  Side note - we ALWAYS tip well when we do use one of those apps, and just in general. NY is expensive and so many of these delivery people are really struggling (it’s not easy for us, either, but we are able to order in now and then, so if we can splurge on ordering in then we sure as hell should tip well).
I have a friend who is old enough to know better, however, he doesn't understand or try to embrace the tipping concept. Unfortunately, I think he represents a huge portion of the population out there.
Don't get me wrong. I tip when I'm supposed to, but why should the consumer be responsible for the worker getting paid fairly by their employer?
God this country sucks
I worked for grubhub, one the worst jobs I ever had.
I would like to defend Skype a bit, it is actually that technology that have became Teams (although Skype no longer have a Stockholm office, but the Microsoft office is pretty large and might have some of that headcount).
Quite surprised they covered this story as such a simple solution, you get off your arse and go and collect it and maybe even offset some of the damage the 21st-century dietary shit that we are consuming is doing to us
I used to drive for Uber eats I stopped once before because I realized I made more even when I had to wait longer for a person than doing both food and personal transportation.
How far disconnected are these people, orphanages are side jobs ? 😢
So, I was watching this guy who looks like if Harry Potter grew up, had plastic surgery, then became the wizarding world's financial advisor, and then blew all the gold in the goblin bank on a crypto coin called "Dobby Dong" Anywho, moving on. My main story tonight is that after watching this video, starring a two eyed spectacled potato,  my family decided to order DoorDash. My daughter wanted to order from the second greatest southern institution behind Whataburger and chose Dairy Queen. Whilst perusing the menu, we found not one, not two, but three Blizzard varieties that cost $99.99! But, the best part is that we could upgrade the size for only 81 cents, so of course we did. (and yes, I have the screenshots, and yes, we did tip!) We later received a notification that our order had been cancelled and would be refunded. We replaced our order without the Blizzard that I can only assume came sprinkled with 24k gold and diamond dust, to find out that instead of directing it to the establishment located four miles away, it was sent to the one 16 miles away! In conclusion, it was cold and meh, kind like Oliver's sex life.  I want to leave you with this: Thank you and your team for their effort and insightfulness. And... Eat Shit John, you rat faced bastard.  #SuckItBackSunday #LastWeekTonight
What I don’t understand with all these John Oliver episodes is that if they are so bad, why do people work for these companies?
TIP IN CASH.  It's not hard people.
"Without the apps we would need to hire about fifteen guys" Yeah, with the number of delivery orders you are getting NOW. Without the apps more people would come by to pick up their food. Or, god forbid, cook for themselves.
Doordash rating system is even worse. I have no problem keeping customer rating high but they began to use your accpetance rating too. So now if you decline orders that are to far away or dont pay enough you get penalized and recieve less orders but more of the ones you already decline so once u get below 50% it just tanks cuz u only get orders for 3$ across town
Are tradind and income incompatible? I think you're not keeping up with the news. While you thought it was impossible, some enthusiasts from Eledator made ai copy trading tool. Everyone now can make money on trading. What do you say now?
Have NEVER and will NEVER use one of these apps.  What's the point?  Not getting rained on?  I get my food faster, cheaper, and in better condition if I just go pick it up.
Prop 22 is great. Driving Lyft and Uber, I want to be an independent contractor, and it pays me a minimum of 120% of the minimum wage in my county if for some reason I get jammed up in low paying rides. My fare wages are on top of that. My tips are on top of that. My bonuses are on top of that. I get 10k per year for a healthcare stipend on top of that. I don’t need California making me an employee and f’ing up things further. Keep your point little nose out of it John. Take  Lib trash somewhere else
Thats nothing I drove a single flower 14 miles during chicago rush hour traffic on valentines day for no tip.
They don't make profit 😂 no one believes that. They are hiding profits in add expenditure and other ways to avoid taxation. It's ridiculous that this is even allowed.
Sicking that this kind of anti business propaganda is tolerated. It’s time to bring back censorship in America to improve social cohesion, patriotism, and preserving democracy from tear obvious Chinese propagandist.
grubhub is bad but you chose the wrong criminal org to focus on. doordash and uber eats are much much bigger and this is widely available information.
In my area you'll have people running 3 accounts and picking up multiple deliveries so you get your food an hour later cold and soggy.  DoorDash and others don't care because they're getting cheap labor.
i feel like we haven’t talked enough about how john oliver is a confirmed stoner lol. so happy to know he films this show while baked as fuck lmao
It's just amazing that this country existed before people delivered food to us at home.
In some cases its basicly modern slavery. Where for example with Uber you can borrow money to get a cab but the interest is more as you can earn, I think that was in countries like India. Or in Paris where Uber Eats is dependant on illegal immigrants. The immigrants did a big protest a few years ago. Also neglecting that the local restaurants lose a big part of money because Uber Eats charges them a fee, they basicly lose money selling food through these apps but they need to have these apps as consumers want this.
<3
I used to be a host/busser/to go person at a spaghetti restaurant. Whenever the door dasher’s came in, they seemed stressed out and were sometimes rude. I felt bad but we were so busy that all I could do was pack the order as fast as possible and take the yelling when someone messed up. 😬
You can't spell millennial without 3 massive L's is an absolute bar though.
I never have and I never will use any delivery app. Too expensive and too much shady shit.
How are you gonna say that they dont have a profit and casually drop 180 million? Gtfoh. Pay your workers or go under.
The "Free Markets" ideal of Capitalism is negatively impacted when externalities like human and natural resources are not factored into the equation.   The U.S. government cannot get a handle on simple economics because our politicians are too indebted to the corporations they're trying to regulate/legislate. It's an impossible system set up to fail the taxpayer, over and over.
I spent time working as a delivery driver for DoorDash and Domino’s. Domino’s felt less exploitative and at least I had a team.
20:53 da chirp
Why the fuck are they taking upwards of 58% of revenue? That’s criminal
Any restaurant that doesn’t package their takeout orders such that they’re at least fully enclosed is doing it wrong, no matter who’s picking it up. If I buy a milkshake to go, I may not be drinking it until I get home. Put a lid on it. It’s not rocket surgery. 🤦‍♂️ And let me play the smallest violin in the world for restaurants getting a bunch of orders they weren’t expecting. 🎻   Would you like some money? “No! I’m not ready to get paid right now!” 🤷‍♂️  Remember folks, the 9 o’clock show is completely different from the 7 o’clock show. And tip your servers!
How about rating a restaurant based on what they deserve? Those reviews help patrons find quality restaurants.  I'm writing this from a 4.8 that just made me sit for 45 min only to serve me raw mushrooms, and it made me think of the shitty advice you gave.
I'm at 7:31 and I've just now realized that the "Grubhub" symbol looks identical to the german "Lieferando" symbol. 😂 Are those two the same company/owner just working under different names internationally?
AS ALWAYS on this show they ignore the far left issues. These companies cannot exist without illegal aliens to exploit. Moral platitudes are not why they are allowed in, it’s CHEAP LABOR. The app is not what keeps these companies going, it’s illegal alien from central america. That is also who is cooking the food, working on the construction sites. Really anyone doing worker. When AI comes in you’re done!  Let companies who have to use illegals to exist to die out as they should and would. Wages go up and we are not making billionaires out of people whose businesses ideas and tech are trash. SHAME on John Oliver once again to tell only the part of the story that they want. Just like calling kids trans kids. There is no such thing. Stoop sexualizing kids. Stop all these insane far left ideas. At least the far right have no ideas. That is better.
All these is why these delivery apo are going looking to reemplace drivers with drones, auto autocars, mini robots, etc. They dont need workes, they need slaves.
I only tip the drivers in cash. That way they don’t get deducted.
If these app succeed, we’re just keeping the status quo. Tip and rate 5 stars just tells the companies that they’re doing the right thing…. This is how tipping culture succeeded in America, we KEPT TIPPING INSTEAD OF FORCING RESTAURANTS AND COMPANIES TO PAY A FAIR WAGE!
Maybe we should focus on the fact that US tipping culture has incentivised places to pay a lower wage for the food service workers.
And if you tip. Tip in cash, money in the app might not go 100% to the driver.
Me watching this while eating an Açaí bowl I ordered from Uber Eats: 👁️👄👁️
I never use that stuff. Too expensive. If I can't drive to the restaurant to pick up my order then I shouldn't be ordering it
Grub Hub is the worst one by far. At least where I am. The choices are awful.
"starting an orphanage" - I backtracked at least three times.
The Reviewing thing is why I always tip very well, and also because a delivery person is more willing to get your order if you tip well. Does that mean I pay a shit ton? Yeah. But I have the choice to go get it in person most of the time. The delivery person doesn't have a lot of choice about getting paid. I tip at least 20%. Every.Single.Time.
I think everyone makes up excuses for everything and at anytime.  WHENEVER you use ANY product or service, they want your MONEY.  Yes they are sending you food you bought and ordered, they are only after your money!! as you sit at home waiting for your Incomplete,  Late and Cold food delivered by someone who is Sick and Demands tip. Cough cough* "raw doging the air", thats a good one lmaoo!
I live in New York. I refuse to tip when these people are making more than me😭
all these companies are garbage....high fees and they expect the customer to pay the wage of the driver plus the companies don't pay any benefits as employees are 1099. They think they are being clever tech bros but everyone can see they are trash and don't treat people well. Profit over people all day long.
Blue states actually hating on the workers? Say it isn't so...
Whenever you hear the phrase "independant contractor" you know you're in for some next level tomf**kery
People should boycott these delivery apps for their poor employee practices & general shadiness!
Car insurance companies will cancel policies for cars used to deliver food if the driver gets into an accident delivering food because it's the just b that works for the driver
lol, the reach back on the horse joke. Epic writing.
Nailed it again team!
Just pay people properly and charge the right amount. If that means it’s not a “good business model“ then it’s not a good business model! Why should the customer have to tip when the agenda is to hire people who you don’t have to pay people properly. It should not be on the customer to pay properly, it should be on the employer! Imagine a world where Jon had to ask all of us for a “fair pay” each time we saw a YouTube video!
Shout out to M Street Bakery! We love you! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Delivery apps are leaches.   Period.  Suck money from the restaurant and the delivery person and the customer.  Everything is more expensive and everyone makes less money except the app.
I thought you were going to cover meal kit deliveries like Hello Fresh, Blue Apron, Purple Carrot, Sunbasket...  but even with prepared food delivery the amazing delivery of comedy never disappoints!
"You have to tip." Mr. Pink HATED that.
The driver apps are even worse they are living nightmare
Tipping is worst way. Address that first.
💯💯💯
What's wrong with communicable disease and high inflation? Who owns the app companies?
Please hopefully you mentioned how much they all have Saudi ties.
I used to work for one of the delivery companies here in Vienna, AT. I can say it's not as bad as in the USA, but it's not good either. Most of what J.O. said stands. Unfortunately.
I don't know about starting an orphanage but being a part time Uber Eats driver has allowed me to vacation and travel more.
I'm in China and I'm really scared of the delivery guys who race recklessly on the sidewalks with their electric scooters.
IT would be nice if  drivers knew how to read  the Floor  in the addresses.   I have my apt listed as basement, and have special instructions to NOT go upstairs... and half the time they drop off to the upstairs.    IF you don't know what Floor means,  you should not be delivering.
Food delivery apps are cancer.  $14 worth of Taco Bell becomes a $30 meal with your tip, which better be at least 25% if you expect it to be delivered. Your driver gets $6, and $10 goes off to Chicago or LA forever.  How can the customers, restaurants, *or* the drivers believe this is sustainable or healthy for anyone but the investors collecting $10 every time one of us eats?
Delivery Drivers were never paid as "Employees" we were glorified wait staff...also pay your own gas, and maintaince on car.  Sure we got free drugs and invited to every party...sorta..but we were never Employees or pair fairly.
John Oliver aka Human Squidward
anyone who describes their workplace as "family" doesn't deserve a real one.
Simply because John Oliver is speaking out against food delivery apps, I’m using DoorDash today. If delivery drivers don’t want to work for a food delivery company, they simply do not have to. If I don’t want to pay the fees, I don’t have to use it. I’d be willing to bet food delivery has helped restaurants more than it’s hurt them.
Whoever ordered that single slice of cake and didn’t tip is not a nice person….
I like how I still have never used a food delivery app and never will.
I often agree with what you say. But regarding tipping I disagree. Tipping should always be a voluntarily given bonus to a service. It should never be a mandatory part of the overall income of an employer. This responsibility is on the company to pay fair salary. The current situation in the US is just bad.
The self righteousness of a multi millionaire telling the common people to pay more for a service than is needed is astounding. Especially, this is one of very few instances in capitalism where the customer wins.
The consumer is paying in many cases more than double what they'd pay, just going on to the location and getting it themselves, and they still can't make money? If that's the case then there isn't much hope for this.   The consumer is paying $17 for a Little Cesar's they'd pay $7 going to get it themselves, how much would they have to charge to make  money? People can't pay $25 for a $7 pizza.  I can already tell you it's the advertising. All we got from mandatory car insurance was being forces to pay for your own torture. 75% of premiums going to advertising. You can't consume any form of media for 2 minutes without hearing 5 car insurance ads and it's all pointless because they are all exactly the same. They all make payouts strictly in accordance with the terms of the policy, that's it. You may get a slightly better rate with one but I don't know how many youtube ads you have seen but: you can't pay $29 a month for car insurance, or even $34 month. While we're at it, no the government isn't hiding a $3,400 stimulus payment from you and no you can't get "basically" $1,300 a month for rent or groceries.   In theory capitalism, competition is supposed to lower prices, but not always.
Design an app to get people to work for you and channel all the money directly to your bank account !😵😵‍💫 If you don't make a profit you don't have to pay taxes!
Not to forget the massive use of Bitcoin trade made with individuals on payment, which creates plenty and absolutly impossible to track tax evasion ;)
Negative reviews are an unfortunate necessity here where I live. People with zero topological skills get hired, pretty much never follow the instructions and when they eventually make the phone call they don't speak a lick of the local language nor English. When they do follow instructions they never ring the door. The ones that carry those awkward backpacks, they can completely destroy the contents without even knowing it. Say you ordered some sushi, and the soy sauce "explodes" everywhere..  One even had the audacity of blowing up in my face after he got a bad review: he didn't follow the instructions, food was missing and incorrect and mushed all over the inside of the plastic bag he gave me. Worse of all, he was 45min late. Since he got lost he had to make the phone call, and I probably had an easier time talking to a moose. I haven't seen him on the app for a while, pretty sure he got sacked, as he should have. This was pretty much the worst case scenario, but hey..  Thankfully in my country the catering industry does not rely on tips, and that's a messed up system you Americans need to solve pronto. And when the weather takes a bad turn, there are extra fees on the order. I made an order once, and in the middle of it a small derecho-like storm developed. The order had a significant delay and a few buckaroos of fee. I apologized to the rider as well, the poor soul was soaked with water. As usual, the welfare of the average American citizen is a well renowned joke in the other countries, especially in here Europe. Get it sorted out
https://youtu.be/aFsfJYWpqII?t=987 Ok, now that we learned that "they consented to this work out of their free will" is a bit shaky an argument, how about a redo about prostitution? https://youtu.be/-gd8yUptg0Q
👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The Devil: Hey kid. I want to challenge you to a contest where I make the rules, and I also am the judge of the winner, in exchange you get this incredibly attractive not at all cursed item. Sure I could give it to you, it's not like gold means anything to me, but for some reason I want you to take it willingly. Yep. Not cursed, just challenging you to a contest that I make the rules and decide who wins.  Johnny: Gee, Satan, that sounds like an honest and fair bet, I'm in.  The Devil: Yup you win, here you go!  Johnny: Well if you ever wanna try again, you know where to find me.  The Devil: Oh, yes, I'll definitely be seeing you again...
If I remember correctly, prop 22 ads showed so-called "delivery workers" saying they were for it.
What happened to Skype? Microsoft happened lol
Refuse to use these Apps...Gen X here!!! If I need a car service I call a local one, they know me and I tip well.  I was ripped off badly by Uber to JFK once and that was enough for me.  If I need food I go buy it, If the restaurant has a delivery person then I know about it but I have not really done that in years.  I used Instacart when my mom was really ill and I had to take care of her and could not leave her alone but it cost 20 dollars in fees to order a delivery from the big box stores.  It is expensive.  But I had no choice and I always tipped well!  These people know where you live and they are "schlepping" heavy items!!! Come on now we have to be fair!!!  They work hard and I appreciate it!❤
The consumer is paying service fees, delivery fees, tips AND the platform also gets a huge cut of the restaurants revenue? How the fuck are they not making any profit?
Stopping tipping might actually be the answer if businesses didnt expect the customer to pay the wages of employees they might have to reevaluate their starting hourly pay.
Once fully automated vehicles are well established, I'm sure one of their applications will be deliveries of all kinds including food. They'll be like Amazon lockers on wheels. If we even get a choice, a lot of people will choose to not risk a human handling their food, or deal with tipping.
I don't suppose if we all stopped using the apps, they might just go away...? Naw that won't happen...
12:43 The delusion is unparalleled.
These things disgust me. Don't be a lazy fat fuck and go cook something for 1/5th the price and probably calories. I am so glad this freelance app shit has not really gotten as big in Europe.
Not every job has to pay a “living wage”, and certainly not jobs that illegal immigrants are allowed to take away from American workers with ease, like those delivery driver apps.
You need to do one episode on Tipping culture. John and team
WASHINGTON DC-AREA RESIDENTS with a hankering for lion meat lost a valuable source of the (yes, legal) delicacy last year when a restaurant called the Serbian Crown closed its doors after nearly 40 years in the same location. The northern Virginia eatery served French and Russian cuisine in a richly appointed dining room thick with old world charm. It was best known for its selection of exotic meats -- one of the few places in the US where an adventurous diner could order up a plate of horse or kangaroo. "We used to have bear, but bear meat was abolished," says proprietor Rene Bertagna. "You cannot import any more bear."  But these days, Bertagna isn't serving so much as a whisker. It began in early 2012, when he experienced a sudden 75 percent drop off in customers on the weekend, the time he normally did most of his business. The slump continued for months, for no apparent reason. Bertagna's profits plummeted, he was forced to lay off some of his staff, and he struggled to understand what was happening.  Only later did Bertagna come to suspect that he was the victim of a gaping vulnerability that made his Google listings open to manipulation.
If anyone doesn't fully comprehend how malicious it is to list a restaurant as closed, just look up "Serbian Crown closed down because of fraudulent Google maps information.". Someone changed the listing for a restaurant that had been open for almost 40 years to say that it was closed or closed on weekends.  By the time the family that owned the restaurant figured out why business had dropped off by 80%, they had gone bankrupt and shuttered the restaurant.  They had to fire fifty or sixty people.
Heard anything from Clarence?
13:14 whadidyoujussay?!
McDonald's hasn't figured it out yet how to deliver their coffee.
Restaurants just need their own delivery people 🤷🏿‍♂️.
Gay parts should go to gay actors??? Wtf is this??? You want to kill best Gendolf humanity has?  Its called acting brother!
The Etsy comparison was priceless
So, people take a job that isn't paying them enough (or anything at all?). They make a massive investment in the job that isn't paying them enough to get a return on the investment. They continue to do that job well past the point when they should notice they aren't being paid. They take orders which aren't tipping, and aren't respecting their time. But also they somehow "rely on the job for their livelihood"? I'm really not sure I follow.   The app existing past the point it should doesn't surprise me too much since America is unreasonably good at subsidizing failing businesses. The part that doesn't make sense is why there's so many people consistently saying they "don't get tips" and "can't make enough to live" and aren't finding work elsewhere. If they are great business-persons and so hard-working, then they should work somewhere else that actually pays them. I'm feeling like these dashers *are* making money and some of them are just REALLY bad at their job and risk assessment. Self-employment isn't for those who can't make sound choices for themselves, and isn't for those who can't choose to stop if it's not profitable. If they rely on the job...then it's obviously paying them. If they aren't making enough, then how did that other guy get a $3k+ setup? Is this like an MLM where the people doing the work are supplemented by another person's income? Are a lot of workers actually making enough money but think they deserve more? They might be right about deserving more. I think that's a different problem. I think tipping-as-income is a huge problem but it's not the customer's individual responsibility.   All of these complaints feel like they're misplaced. Tipping as income has to go. That's not a customer's problem. Lack of health care is absolutely disgusting and needs rectified. Not the customer's problem (at least, not in deciding they want to buy food.) The company claiming they aren't making money, when they clearly are making money, isn't the customer's problem. All of these are symptoms  of other larger issues, but somehow the show makes people think that a symptom of the problem *is* the problem, and that....what? There was no real solution at the end of this. Stop using the app? You claimed people "relied on it." Use the app but tip more? Isn't that just passing the buck for government's lack of addressing wage slavery and abusive corporations? It's essentially relying on charity to do the government's job.   Love the show but this one wasn't the best.
What about Favor?
I never tip. I never will.
The Devil wanted Johnny to win that fiddle contest. As long as Johnny thinks he's won, he'll never repent of his sinful pride. The Devil wants Johnny proud and confident.
Forgive my naivity, but was the reason we "can't enjoy Harry Potter anymore" because of the documentary about Daniel Radcliffs stunt double?
I love how that finance show discusses a "seasoned assist" from Chipotle which ofc is no, a "cease and desist" order. Haha, crimes.
another major thing not mentioned is that for those that deliver food with a car....if they get in an accident while delivering food their insurance wont cover anything!!!
I started doing pick up as soon as i saw the higher prices on the app over the store actual prices! No way i will pay more for an item just because of the use of the app. I rather do pick up
I moved to Germany for a Phd before all this gig work really started to become more common. One of the things I have noticed is that gig work just doesn't seem to exist in Germany. People also seem a lot less stressed out. Whenever I have gone back to the USA I am surprised at how much people spend on these apps.
As a former bike messenger of 15 years, I can say that none of this is new news. You didn't even touch the tax trap that people get into due to wearing a uniform or the fact that companies specifically hire 18-24 year old males because they are statistically more willing to make risky decisions while working.  I was one of the lucky ones that didn't get seriously injured during my career, but the stories are endless.  Food delivery apps are NOT a basic need and are just a sign of a lazy fast food culture.  Go for a walk with your kids and pick up some food at the grocery store. Then the corner grocery store will thrive and hire the same people that are stupidly risking their lives for a 90¢ commission on your squashed pasta.
In the Netherlands (where grub hub is from called: thuisbezorgd) you order via the app but the restaurant gets the order and delivers it with their own employees most of the time.
He left out the ghost kitchen phenomenon and the way food service apps hurt restaurant servers
I use them often cuz I woke up hungry in the middle of the day and I work nights so it’s both not really good for me or anyone else to actually drive and get my food.
John’s take on The Devil Went Down To Georgia is 💯 % dead on!
This is why I pick uo
As an Instacart shopper, PREACH!!!!!   I enjoy my fulltime "job," but it is no secret they do not pay. Even less now than last year, since they lowered the minimum payment they give from $7 to $5.  "You can't spell millennial without three massive Ls."
About time this is made public. Horribly greedy Apps. Bullshit that those billion dollar companies dont make money! They take so much from deliveryworkers thats its very hard to break even! Driving an order gives payrate to drivers based on how close they are to restaurants but apps refuse to send out orders untill drivers drive, for free, to the restaurant! Orders withheld by greed in the system, that charge the customer the full deliveryfee but reduce pay to the driver cynically af. Orders withheld from being messaged for up to 45minutes! Greedy greedy algorithms!!!
The joke about vape smoke hits hard because I’ve gotten so many reports about weed smoke or cigarette smoke ruining peoples food   I won’t say who I work for, but daredevil has a cool name and color scheme
I paid $21.54 (final total) for a sandwich that cost 9.99. Grubhub can’t keep getting away with this! We used to call up a restaurant, tell them the order and their delivery person would bring your order to you, and you’d tip them. Now we paying double fees to use a cot damn app.
F-you DoorDash! You owe me 75+ quid for sushi that was never delivered in Glasgow!
I've never used a food delivery app. I simply go out and get my food if I don't feel like cooking.
people who use these apps ARE NOT saving money or getting money back. they pay more in almost every instance, you really need to tip as well. and in most cases you are ordering something you could've did with out IE eating out when you could've cooked at home. Ordering sweets deserts drinks or snacks when you can walk to the store or plan out your food more efficiently. these apps are used in a lot of places were ordering a lot of stuff was NEVER an option and just because it is does not mean easier access or savings. It usually means waste and over use of money you don't really have to begin with.
In the late 90s I was a sushi delivery guy in the Carroll gardens in Brooklyn . I made approximately $500 a night on a good night and the restaurant paid me something like $100 a week . I did well because I spoke the language and knew the neighborhood as I had grown up there . The owner of the restaurant was responsible for my safety and I was responsible for getting their food to the customers intact and on time there were responsibilities that interlocked the food delivery Aps have bypassed the responsibilities section and just moved on to taking everyone’s money
Very interesting stuff I personally have noticed that people rarely tip anymore no matter service level. Tips are rare thing these days.
I deliver on my e bike in California and the proposition  helps a lot with the   hourly rate pay', yes the negative feedback is a nightmare but we should understand the costumer's side of view  , they pay a lot of money. But yes 'PLEASE TIP', specially those costumers who request the delivery person come up to your door and leave the food there.
This industry shouldn’t exist quite frankly. I was a DoorDash driver for a while and was making about $10 an hour after petrol costs. That’s a minimum 70-80 hour workweek to make a living wage. If the drivers, restaurants and companies are all not making money then the industry shouldn’t exist.
Cab drivers were doing better than uber drivers. Perfect example of a tech company dismantling an industry and leaving everyone worse of. Even if I dont want to rely on uber there arent any alternatives anymore.
Doordash takes 15-50% of the order total from restaurants, charges an average of $10 in service and delivery fees to customers every order, and only pays dashers $2 a delivery (and as of last week will STILL only give drivers $2 on double orders despite them doing 2x the work) and makes the driver do 99% of the work while all they do is provide an automated app, dirt cheap outsourced call center, and spend a bit on marketing. They are 1000% lying about no profits and Doordash specifically is a prime example of everything wrong with corporate selfishness and greed. The CEO pays himself an outrageous salary (he's worth $2 billion now) while finding new ways every month to pay his workers less and less and make their lives harder. He's the prime example of everything wrong with corporate america and his selfishness knows no end.
I had a pizza shop owner tell me the ugly truth about delivery apps and ever since I've bent over backwards to call the place I wanted food from or even pick it up if I have to to avoid making the restaurant pay doordash/uber toll
Why can't Millennials enjoy Harry Potter anymore? Did I miss something?!
You fricking doofus demagogue, I heard on tiktok johnny is showing complex multi history mastery and very difficult technical fiddling while the devil is doing a fast simple thing a showy noob might
Thank you for showing the overall ruthless amorality of Stanford Biz School. Corporate America's school for greed and smug entitlement
All customer service jobs are rated. I've experienced this with both retail and corporate. Corporate customer service was wise because now they're trying to automate us and outsource to other countries that they can pay less. This is wise when people in those other countries are not direct hires and are listed as "contractors" even when they really aren't
So how does a company that exists as a website, charges restaurants 30-60% of a profitable business without paying workers a fair wage, fail to make a profit. I mean, you order food that costs $50. You charge $75-$100, and pay the only labor involved like $10.  So where did the rest go, besides lobbying and executive compensation?
It’s crazy how death stranding came out like 3 months before the pandemic basically predicting the future. Kojima did it again lmao
This is the greatest segment of an amazing show.
Empathy is strictly line of sight.
Must have been Diddy ordering that cheesecake thinking he was doing another season of “Making The Band”
The point that restaurants and drivers are getting screwed AND the apps aren't turning a profit is the key to this story. Here are the facts:  No amount of clever algorithms can make it efficient to allow people to get anything they want delivered wherever they want in under an hour, especially in geographically sprawled, car-traffic-congested suburbs. That's just not a thing that will pencil out at an affordable price. As we saw with Uber, these companies are willing to burn through VC funds in hope of developing a sustainable business model eventually. But we should not expect this "millennial lifestyle subsidy" to last another decade.
I still dont understand how these companies aren't profitable. Once you build the platform other than opex what do u spend money on? Other than some subsidies,  nothing else..neither insurance nor anything else ..
I'm all for these workers getting treated fairly, but the gig-worker laws meant to help them hurt every other kind of freelancer. I'm a technician in entertainment production and we tend to start as full-time employees for corporations with the dream of someday going freelance. Freelancers make better money, get to be their own boss, continue doing the work they love without having to take promotions into management just to make a decent income, choose what jobs they take, and take time off when they need or want it. I've made way more money and lived a much better life as a freelancer than the jobs I had building up to it. But these freelancer laws have made it harder for companies to hire us and are ruining the dream. There has to be a distinction between gig workers and professionals who are freelance by choice.
the only time i can think of when an orphanage is a side hustle is when you're in the yakuza and the orphanage is for money laundering purposes
If there food is wonderful people will drive to pick-up their food.
Also do not tip through the app, tip directly to the delivery person or driver. As many companies still charge the worker a fee over the tip.
Stop making consumers responsible for the problems of the employees. That is a situation to be worked out with their employers,
Ironically even with the "millennial subsidy", using these apps is SO much more expensive than then old method of calling a restaurant and having them deliver (if you can find the rare place that does that). Or at least order pick up. Uber, Lyft, and now delivery apps are squeezing money out of a rock. It's everyone who will get shafted by this when they finally choose to make a profit. It's already unsustainable.
I drove for Doordash for 2 and half years full time. I spent $20,000+ on gas, routine maintenance and repairs 40,000 miles a year of wear and tear on my car. In the end, it's not worth it. People don't want, and don't think you deserve a tip.
Perhaps living wages should be mandated over tipping. As the labor market shrinks, workers need to take the upper hand. Fight the algorithm and the disruptive tech bros.
No health insurance through dasher when I dash, and no health insurance through the ambulance company I work for... Giving ppl health care 😅 Ah... The american dream.
"Because of delivery apps the restaurants aren't making money, the delivery drivers aren't making money, and the apps aren't even making money" I could have sworn I was told that capitalism breeds innovation. Where is the innovation?
I did doordash.  It was fun seeing all the apartments and different neighborhoods.  But the money sucks w/o the tips.  Gas is too much.
I rarely use the apps.  I rather get in a car, pick up my food, and the restaurant keeps all the profits.  Plus, I feel like it's a giant rip off using the apps.
Not sure if anyone knows but in countries like thailand and singapore they hire gangs to move out old school delivery drivers. most view them as a sort of gang war, complete with violence which may be an extra tax
it's not the customers job to tip to subsidize the workers pay. john oliver pushing hard for this instead of just telling the apps to pay the workers a proper wage is ridiculous.
I had one door dash delivery driver steal some food off my order then asked me to give him a 5 star review when he handed it to me no way in hell im tipping someone who steals my food nor am I giving them a 5 star review.
Tipping is a bigger problem. Let’s talk about that.
I don't use any delivery apps, I don't want to pay $20 for a fucking whopper.
Why would Californians vote for prop 22, are they stupid?
I might be wrong but I feel like this is a significant driver of inflation

Choose businesses that support self delivery if they have to; go out otherwise? ❤ #nomiddleman
I have lived in Manhattan (NYC) for more than 15 years, I have NEVER used a delivery App!  And somehow I have survived and have supported many restaurants directly!  Delivery apps are garbage that suck the life out of independent businesses, abuse the "contractors" and relocate the money to some other part of the world, out of your neighborhood.
The fight for $15 minimum wage started in like 2009, we're lucky if they start us at $20+/hr (and I'm talking every job out there from hairdresser to post worker).   Workers in America also are taxed on their wages.  Capitalism thrives off of slavery.  Time to wake up.
I doubt I'll every use 'grub hub' etc.   If I get real lazy - I might sign up for Walmart+ and have them deliver marketside flat bread, etc.  Of course I'll need 15 minutes to cook it in the oven.
Makes me think of Amazon taking 40-60 from 3p sellers
Oliver on suicide watch with these topics lately 😂
Why doesn’t he mention Uber eats more? It’s the most popular app and just as evil as grubhub….
Heysus H Christi, America! What part of  FERAL capitalism and PLUTOCRACY don't you get?
Sorry, John, but I call b******t. Nobody who worked at blockbuster could afford delivery; take my word for it.
There is no way to convince me that the people working these jobs that this is the only option they have to work and make a living. It just flat out isnt true. There are plenty of fast food jobs, construction jobs, you name it. People are doing these jobs voluntarily and it must be because for whatever reason they get something out of it that they think is worth it. Nobody is forcing them at gunpoint to work these jobs. If they think its not worth it they wouldnt do the job. So to make an argument for legislation, to force companies do you what you want is absolute tyranny and a stupid idea.
My trust issues will not allow me to use things like door dash and those trust issues are from my family so...... 🤣
doordash and uber have also been listing restaurants that dont want in and get orders they never receive
Ahh Skype, I tried signing up on that website a couple of times like 15 years ago, but all the usernames I tried were taken, I got tired and left.
On the topic of the devil went down to Georgia, the ending is clearly misleading. Jhonny adknowleged that gambling is a sin but did it anyway and the devil fully acknowledged loss to feed Jhonny's sin of pride. And it works. Jhonny ends it fully believing he is a god at fiddling even being better than the devil and challenges the devil to come again any time showing that he is a prideful gambler who likely will go to hell anyway. The devil rather than taking a risk of losing from a third party judge played the long game and won Johnny's soul in the end
As a food worker in sf I can assure you no respectable restaurant uses these awful apps. They are only in it for the money and not in it for us food workers , for their passion for food or for you. Boycott these leaches.
"You should tip" => Perhaps instead companies should pay a decent wage?  Also what's with the focus on bikes for deliveries? I'm sure that's common in NYC but I haven't seen that elsewhere.
UBER leased cars to people who didn't have autos, left their regular drivers sitting during a week long festival and gave all rides to the leasing drivers.  Those people didn't make but a tony amount after paying the lease.  Many just kept driving the cars and abandoned them.  So many were trashed they broke the agreement with UBER.  Bunch of idiots who don't care if they are ethical, and don't honor the star system many worked hard to staying top of.  I was so glad to get out of that circus after losing my corporate job at age 56 and getting zero interviews after hundreds of resumes. It was horrible the way people didn't tip.  But there were many more who were kind, polite, fun people.
re:Skype. Microsoft did it. They bought them for an insane amount of money. Then created Skype for Business, people hated it (mostly the UI) and the backend model simply didn't scale. They dumped it after a couple of years. Zoom eventually showed up, and when the pandemic hit, it was perfectly aligned to become the new household word for video calls. Personal and Business.
Bullshit man. Literally this is the benefit of capitalism, the companies using these services are getting more customers, the consumers are getting a fantastic profit, the workers are able to work at whatever hours they want.
There is a great book concerning this called technofeudalism.
Ride share is the same.  They work against you if they can. Even if you have 5 stars for years. You pay for tires, wear and tear, smelly people, crazy people (who they believe and will shut you down for one bad rating).  You can never speak with someone.  They all need to be shut down.
In 2011 I was working for a small family restaurant (Columbus, Ohio) that offered carryout and delivery.  We had a fax machine (yeah, I know) where orders would come through; usually corporate catering.  One day, it just started crapping out orders for GrubHub because they had begun listing us.  This was before they had their own delivery drivers in our area, they expected us to use ours!  The orders were always WAY out of our area and often included items not on our menu.
I have wondered that about Skype many times.  I had never even heard of Zoom before the pandemic days.  Skype had been in use for over a decade.  What happened, Skype?
What happened to Skype? Easy -- Microschlock. Those scumbags could screw up anything, and they certainly did with Skype. I had been using Skype for a decade before it was aquired by Microsloth. After they started "improving" it I dropped the POS like a hot rock. Useless.
1:23 You sure that's not Matt Walsh, caught in his side hussle?
Many delivery drivers multi-app that way they can choose the orders that are convenient to them and not rely on a single app giving them crappy orders. If done properly they can earn $20 hour or more, if they live in CA prop 22 gives them extra, if they deliver on a e-bike or scooter it’s a plus
Last week I tried to order chipotle bowls for three people through uber eats. The total came out to $60 (without adding tips). We decided to drive down to chipotle and pickup food ourselves. The total was $33. This part was missed in this episode - so we are already over paying so much more when we order via apps and now asking us to tip more on top of that is just ridiculous.
"but you got to fucking tip" ...no you don't. Tipping is corrupt and evil and everyone should subvert it until it goes away.
Never used one of these apps. Or Uber. Pick up food myself or the restaurant has delivery staff. Taxis.
Jon Oliver does more for the everyday American than the government.
So what if they charge a higher delivery fee. It goes to us the drivers and our gas.  Who gets your food too you. In a fast and convenient way.
Why can't we watch Harry Potter anymore?
Okay, I am as old as stone, but I only eat what I have cooked. Ever. The very idea of food delivery is intrinsically offensive to me. I just don't understand this modern world.
I really wish he got into the scam that is ghost kitchens - eddie burback did a great video on this
As a former dasher who also ordered food through DoorDash it was sooo awesome to make a couple dollars while knowing someone paid at least $10-$20 more dollars on fees alone. And then add the fact you have to buy gas at least once a week
Grub hub is a leeech
The government needs to give EVERY citizen $10,000 a month unconditional!  And FREEZE prices to 1980s prices.  CEOs and Corporations that raise prices disappear  for a month, like China did for their millionaires.   And any idiot Liberal or Republican that says, " how will we pay for it?" The SAME WAY WE PAY millions of dollars to Billionaires,  just print it.  Inflation,  um, in REALITY Price gouging and Shrinkflation would be illegal and sentenced corporations is taken care of
REALLY great one, John!
Did you notice the race of the individuals that run these companies? Okay bye now.
Tip in cash!
It is just a form of food delivery like we have used for a century.  The same thing with daycare, and lawn care. It used to be neighbors and family members, but now it it an expensive new industry. I have not used a food app, butvi commonly use restaurants that have delivery.
I wish I could say I was surprised when I first heard about people ordering in floods and natural disasters.  But back around 2011 or so when I was working fast food we had people pulling in when there was a fatal accident right at the entrance from the road, and another time where someone had a seizure in the parking lot pretty close to the drive thru lane, ambulance and police there, and we still had a long fucking line.  Absolutely ridiculous.
Has tipping actually been a problem in the past or has it just been since food prices have gone insanely high, causing people to need extra jobs and get frugal on who they tipped?
I really appreciate the shoutout to devil went down to Georgia because I 100% agree, the devil was ROBBED
Why in America the burden has to be always on the consumer? Not to call for food if the option is available when there is bad weather... Pay the salary of an employee with tips,,, what else? If there is bad weather the service should be discontinued, waiters should be paid by the employeer.
Pretty much all minimum wage earners are living paycheck to paycheck and absolutely cannot afford to be ill.  When I was working 4 jobs (2 FT, 2 PT), I was doing it after a major surgery (back of my leg was removed, from butt to knee).  I had very little time to sleep, about half a night sleep two days a week, but I was in so much pain I couldn't sleep anyway.  Ended up getting a second mortgage on my home to pay for all the medical bills.   There's no American dream left.
Late stage capitalism.
These companies are waiting for self driving cars then all the uber drivers and delivery guys will be out of jobs and they will be profitable AF
Restaurants: "We make money by charging 25% more for the food than it costs to make."  Food delivery: "We're going to charge you 25% more in fees so that we can make money by delivering it. Except that 25% isn't enough to offset the cost of running this business."  Restaurants: So by doing this, we don't make money, you don't make money, and the customer pays more for worse service. So nobody wins."  Food delivery: "Correct."
If Grubhub is taking half, then why in the hell isn't Grubhub not paying enough so I don't need to tip drivers?
I’ve never used one of these apps because I’m too poor and now I CERTAINLY never will.
I'm shocked to hear "only the customers are winning" because I never use Doordash, Uber eats, or any of those other companies because it costs way too much. I tried having food delivered once through one of those businesses when I was sick, and it took almost an hour to arrive (when the place is less than 15 min from my house), added over $10 to my order, and the food was stone cold when it arrived. So I've never bothered with them again. The only time I ever have food delivered is when I order pizza, and the delivery drivers work for the pizza place. I had no idea any of this was going on, but not shocked to hear it. I usually go get food if I eat out because I just cannot afford to have it delivered. I only get delivery when I'm sick, and now only from pizza places. I usually just eat at home, but sometimes I just don't feel up to cooking. This was so sad to hear. Thanks for being consistent, John Oliver! Lol
My only experience with food delivery is when I ordered delivery from the restaurant itself and was unaware that they outsource to DoorDash. So some disgruntled lady shows up at my door with half my order. I called the restaurant and they were annoyed because I guess food delivery people do this all the time since they don't work for the restaurants themselves. I asked the delivery lady if she was going to go get the rest of my food and she sighed and said, "Can't you just go get it?" As she was leaving she told me to leave her a 5-star review.
this is solid
Ask how every Chinese restaurant in the country was able to make delivery work before the pandemic?
Maybe the real commentary is that the economy is broken
Ryan George had a great commentary on this as well
11:57 oh! I just saw a fiddler/violinist actually explain this The Devil was a better performer but Johnny was a better musician  Devil only did things that anyone could do Johnny showed his technical skill and music history knowledge
6:26 one time I ordered food on Uber Eats and I paid the same price as the meal but was only given the burger 😭 I felt so ripped off
"You can't spell millennial without three massive L's" LMAO that drew blood 🤣🤣😵
When I drove for Instacart (in a suburban area) I was in the red nearly every month after paying for all the gas EDIT: once a woman handed me a $5 cash tip and I almost cried
19:19  they cut the dispatchers from the equation. Tell them to askshea how to fix it. I helped sell Zingo to Uber.
in comunisam we didnt have such pRoblems. everything was state owned.
to be fair... FMLA only protects your job and doesn't pay you... except for the days that companies mandate you use your vacation for while off on injury
9:00 Idk remember which one but I placed an order then 45 minutes later the driver calls and tells me that Restaurant doesn't do Grub Hub or Door Dash or whichever one it was......so no food then I had to call to get my refund....like WTF
It’s about time someone exposed food delivery apps. LWT is good when they do these type of shows rather than the gaslight they expel when doing politics.
I just ordered Doordash. Let's get into this.
Hang on... I was with you until you threw out the Johnny's fiddle shade. I heard a good analysis a while back from a violinist. The devil is essentially playing some of the easiest notes and has the backing of a whole band. Johnny plays some very technically difficult folk songs back to back which is a majorly more difficult.
The orphanage thing... expect that coming in 2025.
2:09 also a lot of people who can’t cook or can’t leave the house get it
Everyone should install the apps, give them a one-star review, and then uninstall them.
Stoners tip the best
Thank you for saying it, John. The Devil ABSOLUTELY won that fiddle contest. It was a total fix.
If Everyone was High As A Giraffes Ass it would be alot better place!!! LFG 11% rewards i xrp for being HAAGA!!!
Can confirm: I managed a dive bar in Manhattan that was constantly being listed on food delivery apps as a "restaurant" with a fake menu of items we didn't have. It was a cash-mostly, bud-light-and-fireball type joint that maybe could bust out wings or fries some of the time, if items were in stock. I would get angry people calling or even walking in about orders I'd never heard of, on apps we didn't use, for items we didn't sell, and all I could offer them in apology was a beer or a shot. It was the kind of joint that didn't even answer the phone when it was busy or loud. Corner dive, blatantly not a restaurant, and yet...
Gonna comment a personal story as a reply here in a bit but speaking about safety - Doordash *will* often given you potential orders while you are driving. And, you get punished for declining orders, so you basically have to interact with the app *while you are driving* in order to accept the order so you don’t get punished
Whoever was still laughing at 22:19 is a legend
Big L take. The REAL problem is that these workers have to rely on tips, rather than actually getting paid a living wage. Tiping should be banned, so businesses have no excuse to pay their workers next to no money.
So is it really the 20$ min wage increase causing restaurants in CA to increase meal prices, or is it really... in part, at the very least... that's causing t the menu prices going up and t the GOP are just blaming livable wages?
I drove for door dash until I had to cross county lines to bring one single taco to a shack in the middle of the woods of western North Carolina. She tipped a dollar.
I stopped using these apps a couple of years back because I decided they were ultimately a huge negative for the restaurant business. If I go to a restaurant these days I either eat in or do take out directly from the restaurant. I also keep cash on hand to pay instead of using credit cards. The restaurants I like tend to be small local restaurants that are barely surviving, and because I want them to survive I keep the middle men out of the equation as much as I can.
My brother is now homeless because he was addicted to these food delivery app companies.  I kid you not!!! That freaking idiot would actually get online pay day loans to buy this crap. He now lives in his car.
Excellent piece.
Did he really just make a business model joke for the Orphan Grinding Machine?
I have never and will never use these "services"
People have never been fatter or lazier than they are today. That's the majority of delivery users.  Don't worry, soon all your food will be delivered by drone, and with everybody working from home, you'll be able to plug into the matrix and never even have to leave your house
The issue for the workers is the stupid tip system, Americans learn from the rest of the world. Tipping is really bad  For the apps, there has to be a better business model
So, if I'm hearing this right, delivery apps aren't profitable and are likely to collapse. Some folks think delivery workers made more money (or benefits that would require more spending on the part of delivery app companies), and suggest laws that ultimately come down to delivery companies being forced to spend more on workers.  But wouldn't that just accelerate their collapse? And wouldn't that mean all those people would just lose their jobs anyway? Or at the very least that prices go up, which would cause customers to opt for pickup instead, reducing the amount of money that go towards delivery workers?  This doesn't add up.
you all have lost your minds. In the past I called my fav pizza place or whatever and the same person form the same restaurant showed up to bring the food, There was a human conection involbed. I habe neve used a delivery app and never will.  all this supposed convinience is just destroying us.
It's kind of stupid how in this segment it shows heavy bias towards one victim group (delivery workers) and then recognizing another group (people who need delivery). Because the latter has a lot of really low income people. It's not cheap when they don't tip. But as John said, restaurants price their stuff higher on the apps to account for lost in commission and delivery fees. So that means food is a lot more expensive for these low income people (victims). Basically John didn't do a good job at closing the loop and favored one victim group while ignoring the others. So tell people to just tip is tone deaf and actually very un-progressive. Don't get me wrong, we should tip if we can (because we need to remember the other victim groups) but ultimately we should remove tip entirely across the board in the US and FORCE companies to pay a proper wage. And I don't mean a FLAT amount of proper wages. Not that bullshit flat min wage that we need to approve and vote for every year. Min wage should be somewhat deterministic and scalable. Every employer should be required to calculate min wage by some type of percentage. How we come up with the function for that, I don't know. But what I do know is that we should update wages by some cadence. Maybe every quarter or every half a year or maybe even every year. I don't know
1. The purpose of any for-profit business is to make as much money as possible, they will always try to minimize costs. There's no such thing as "fair", the prices and wages are (or should be) determined by the laws of supply and demand. 2. The rating system helps to filter out people who don't do their job well. Rating everyone 5 stars would disincentivize workers to adhere to certain standards or even incentivize criminal behavior. At least 20% of them doesn't deserve five stars. The same is true for tipping. 3. Introducing a minimum wage --> increase in prices for consumers --> the demand for food delivery orders goes down --> less revenue for restaurants; fewer delivery people and restaurant workers employed. Pretty much everyone loses, other than the delivery people who keep their jobs.
@steakd is a gaming changing food delivery Ap that is using crypto!
I done over 1000 orders in Alabama in the last year, I had to deal with every bit of this orders during tornadoes and floods, I had a hole in my hand from a metal bender at a job that fired me and got covid at the hospital and still had to do orders to survive, I promise you it the worst thing I ever wish on people then I have to pray that each order gonna give me a decent tip
Can’t stand current tipping culture. Restaurants pay your employees a living wage. Customers stop eating out & tipping unless actual good service is provided!
It's not often that John has such a flat-out incorrect take. I'm quite appaled that he has the audacity to think that Johnny didn't play a much more impressive and technical skill demanding piece than the devil's boring little slide.
I hate tipping. I'm at a point in my life where I've honestly stopped using any service that I'm expected to tip for. I'd just rather do it myself than throw an extra 20% away on a tip. Having someone bring my food to the table and clear the dishes just isn't worth $10 to me. I don't use delivery apps either.
Dude makes me lmao, even on a serious subject 😮😂😂😂😂😂
Grub Hub, Post mates, and Door Dash are trash. Uber Eats is the best out of the three. Period “Starting an orphanage” comment is 2nd only to “Let them eat cereal” comment from that sc😡*mbag Kellogg CEO.
End tipping culture.
Screw tipping culture. That is just a tactic for the lazy elites to get out of paying their workers.
Welcome to post-capitalist hell, motherfuckers!
Oof. Taking College Humor jokes from 4 years ago?
As a former server, let me help break down tipping culture very simply. In a perfect world, exceptional tips are for exceptional service, good tips are for good service, and bad tips are for bad service. The problem with tipping begins when good or exceptional service goes unrewarded. If you want to tip a bad server, you either have a lot of mercy, a lot of money to waste, or both, but good servers are the people who deserve those tips. As a waiter, I would understand a low tip if I did a poor job, but getting a low tip on a high dollar bill that I attentively served through the whole meal, that is cruel.
They are %100 lying about the apps not being profitable. Probably for tax purposes. It's a business with very little overhead, that milks every cent of profit from every person involved. Their biggest costs of business is Advertising and Lobbying. Bullshit the busines model isn't profitable.
I try to catch them in time to cash tip. I know the app takes a piece off the top.
The fees are ridiculous for food delivery.  I would not personally use but the market should decide the price.  Every time the government intervenes, the unintended consequences create worse problems than we had initially.
Ah, This is Cory Doctorow’s Enshitification model; subsidies buyers and sellers to onboard, then start clawing back revenue from sellers who stay bc of sunk costs. Then finally raise prices on buyers, completing the cycle. Non of these computers were ever meant to last - they’re middle men.
"gay parts should go to gay actors" No.😢
Johnny might not have been better than the devil, but Sully kicked his ass.
Lobbyists are the scourge of American lawmaking and politics. Reprehensible that these billion dollar companies can pay top execs millions a year, spend hundreds of millions of dollars on political lobbying, but just "can't afford" to pay benefits and living wages to their workers...and then also claim they don't even turn a profit. lol 'Murrika...always putting the people first.🗽
typical of all of silicon valley zombie companies, don’t need it, don’t want it, never asked for it. It only exists bc some stanford d-bag convinced investors that there was a middleman, ehm, “disruptive” market opportunity.
The gig economy is the modern evolution of sharecropping.
I used to work for DoorDash before their lawsuit  I kinda made decent money but not enough to survive. I found out they were pinching tips and got sued. I ended up getting 3.5k of what was owed to me, MINUS lawyer fees. I should have had 7k    Not to mention wear and tear of my car, and gas cost ect.   After the lawsuit they LEGIT had $3-$4 trips that would take me half an hour to complete minimum. I quit on the spot.
11:35 FINALLY, someone who speaks the truth that the Devil smoked Charlie Daniels! 😂
I've never used a delivery app even once in my life. How hard is it to fix something at home or, heaven forbid, get off your ass and go get your own food?
Funny thing is I have only used food delivery apps overseas because the fees and when I did I tipped 20% and met the delivery guy outside the hotel to limit the time he needed to spend on my delivery with a 5 star review.
I've been saying for two years that it's a shame that Instacart, Zoom, and Onlyfans won the pandemic. But finally, John Oliver  says it better than I can.
As a single dad w sole custody of his son, who lost his job and has to DoorDash later today, I can’t wait to put this on as my son (14) and I dash all day to try to make money because we are behind on rent. I have a feeling it’s gonna be good 😂😂😂❤
poor delivery workers, poeple should stop forcing them to work by putting a gun to their heads and making them work for these companies. and no I dont have to tip ...thats why its called a tip.
Maybe we should focus on the fact that Uber, including Uber eats, has never made money.
The millennial joke was pitch-perfect.
Same with Hotel sites. You'll ALWAYS get a better deal calling the hotel directly! The hotel has to pay a commission on that "lowest rate" to the travel site; meaning they get even less money than you're paying. Just call the hotel and make an offer! You may be shocked just how little they'll take.

Or or or or…… or we all get up to get our own food, cook at home, and these drivers can move to restaurants that genuinely care about and actually know their name. Not just their employee number. For a generation with no money that’s hard to swallow the advice at the end of this video John. I believe me, I get it. I was a waiter that worked for tips in Texas, where the server minimum wage is $2.13. But the increase cost of food, the delivery fee, and a tip for their services doesn’t not a smart financial decision make.
You've missed the mark so far here.  They're using all moves invented by the trucking industry.  Back up and start there.
I want you to do a segment on Lyft and Uber as a ride share company using their employees… they get paid pennies for their services
I listened to a one of them crying about housing prices. I went online and found several good houses in their price range within 10 minutes.
It's too easy to be a keyboard Karen and be mad at people for stuff that's not thank you for bringing that up
I appreciate LWT covering this topic because it's rather absurd how these companies operate. However, I feel like there were a number of misses in the discussion.   For instance, the onus of 5-star reviews shouldn't be on the consumer - that's a problem with the companies. Instead of telling the consumer that they should always leave a 5-star review for their food instead push for the companies to default the review to the food and then give a separate option to review the delivery.  The same goes with tipping. Why is it the consumer's fault that the workers aren't being paid appropriately? I get that it's still the culture and we should participate until its changed, but that person with the slice of cake was merely using a service made available to them. They had no way of knowing that the person delivering the food would be on a bike or that it would be their only order on the trip. Offloading the issue onto tips merely artificially lowers the cost of the product.  I also really wish they'd focused more on how disruptive these services are to the restaurants. Like when the apps offer a free item during a specific day and time which leads to the restaurant having to basically shut down due to too many orders, especially considering the restaurant workers themselves often don't even know about the promotion. Or how consumers are regularly blaming the restaurants for being incorrectly listed on the app.
I think I get recognition as being the only person in the United States who has never used any of these services.
Very true about "ratings" People can leave you dank reviews and as a driver you will never know why. As a driver if I did something wrong I would like to know so I can correct it going forward but no, you get the rating and deal with it.
In the middle east this issue is even worse. Due to how traffic and climate works, usually peoples with motorbikes do the orders. The issue is in many places in the Middle East, particularly in places like Qatar, it is 100% not a bike friendly zone as a lot of the cars on the road are giant land cruisers. This has led to so many traffic accidents that it isnt suprising to see a delivery driver or 2 end up in the emergency department EVERYDAY (keep in mind this country is tiny, i cant imagine for other Middle Eastern countries). I havent seen the numbers or deaths associated with food delivery bikes but I wouldnt be suprised if at least 50% of the deaths on the road are linked with these food delivery bikers. A combination of the biker trying to get delivery on time, people in the larger cars driving like idiots, and a general lack of bike safety and biking culture has led to this. And just to reiterate, this is 100% food delivery apps fault.
I wonder how this works in non-tipping cultures.
I thought John Oliver's show would get stale over the years, but nope, still got it.
I use Door Dash because i'm a caregiver that needs to be on hand.. It usually takes me declining like 5-10 orders until I get one that isn't complete unreasonable. I'm not driving 9 miles for a 2 dollar tip because you only ordered a cheap coffee. 😅 Also, DD dropped our base pay down to measly 2 dollars per order, BUT not for stacked orders. Even if we have 3 to do at the same time, they only give us the 2 dollars, while charging customers ridiculous "delivery fee's".. THAT should be illegal.. Charging customers who think we're getting a piece of that charge when we're not.
It’s a Millennial subsidy in the sense that we are getting discounted services that take money from Millennial workers by using these apps.   Hence, I never have and probably never will use one of these delivery apps.
Delivery apps should be required to list the travel distance of the drivers and not the delivery distance of a carrier pigeon. That cake probably said like 3 blocks away instead of 3 bridges, 20 blocks and on a bike through rush hours in New York.
John... it's not an eggplant, it's an aubergine... :(
Amazing, brings tears. Big love to all who spread the love instead of brutality.
I don't remember the name, but i recently saw a dystopian cyberpunk movie where prisoners were put into a virtual system that makes them pilot delivery robots and if they mess up they are tortured by electrocution.
Well said!😂
As someone who drives for DoorDash as my primary means of income, tips aren't 1/3-1/2 of my income, they're well over half, easily 60% or more of my income is from tips. When you order delivery and don't tip, you're directly hurting the driver.  In my state the cost of vehicle operation/mile is around 50 cents, that being the number used when doing taxes to include gas, wear on the vehicle, insurance, etc. I've taken deliveries where the cost of delivering was more than I was paid, and before you try to tell me to just not take those orders, I have to keep my acceptance rate up to keep my job. The app doesn't stop you from dashing if you have a low acceptance rate, but it puts you at last priority on the schedule, meaning you have to fight for shifts and/or pray it's busy enough when you want to work, instead of being able to actually dash whenever and wherever like I can with high acceptance rate. I will literally spend slow days taking basically every offer I get, even at a loss, to boost acceptance so that I can afford to decline bad offers at busy times like Friday nights when I need to maximize earnings.
The band of demon's do bring it 🎉
I'm gonna called this - THE JOHN OLIVER EFFECT. This video truly helped my satisfaction rate from 89% to 95% just now.  Long story short - after working for UberEATS for 3 years (Postmates before) in NYC, I kept my accout almost perfect like it was always over 98% satisfaction rate besides the daily posted compliments, etc. Then all of a sudden a bit more than a month ago when laws took effect in January to pay hourly, and companies started implementing schedules with minimum hours of 20 hr per week. They drop my satisfaction rate to 89% with a long list of negative reports. I called and spoke with a supervisor, and he couldn't explain,  and only said - "It was only the app system that makes those changes and they cannot do anything about it because of TRANSPARENCY." I was extremely disappointed, qhen your satisfaction rate os under 95% they give you less hours a week to work and you have to ride to busy areas at a certain time like dinner time to probably get a few orders. It has been very frustrating.  THANK YOU JOHN for making people aware of how this Gig works. 🙌🏼  PS: I have screenshots to prove everything.
Because we have dumb government, they stole tons of money from public services belonging to government agencies not dumb apps.
Check out what Groupon does to its merchants it’s pretty messed up
Its wild to discover that these companies aren’t actually turning a profit, considering how expensive it is to order food due to all the fees.
John is stupi.d donke.y has no value added to real economy
Prop 22 pissed me tf off, they lobbied that shit so hard and lied to voters faces about what the ballot measure would do. I'm still absolutely furious about it
Tipping should be outlawed. Companies need to pay workers for their labor.
I'm thinking of the picture from 2020 of a delivery worker driving through a flooded city in the rain. Yes, these workers are clearly choosing gig work for time fluidity, not because of economic pressures and demands* 🙄 ffs  (*Sarcasm, obvi)  Oh, he showed the exact image I was thinking of.
Why tip? Not my job to subsidize the companies poor wages. This is why you should do away with the tipped minimum wage and force gig companies to pay a fair wage.
Maybe we should talk about 70% of the USA water supply is flourided
The self driving vehicles will be delivering soon enough. These gigs drivers are just mapping out the world for the systems
I usually take a piece of pizza when I get a pizza delivery. Two if it's my first of the day. Most people understand it's part of the tip.
Lady gave me a go to hell look yesterday at a window because I hit no tip. I'm paying 7$ for a smoothie ffs. Ask your boss to compensate and work elsewhere?. I know my worth. If I want money I work for it. If I want easy money I stand on the corner with a sign.
Unless you're rich, learn how to cook! You don't think people had kids, work, disabilities and a hectic lifestyles, before GrubHub? Quit making excuses. People used to premake, multiple different dinners and lunches on their day off and put the food in containers for use, through out the week. When you want something special, get dressed up nice and go to a nice restaurant and eat in, like a human. Not some shut in animal. You are trapped in a prison, you created for yourself. You could probably buy a car with the money you save, not using delivery services and buying restaurant food, every night. I cook better than most restaurants, so, there's that.
IF this guy really cared he wouldn’t have us watch a video & then ask for money.  Or he could just write a book.  Therefore it seems, to me, he is scamming.   Bye bye!
It's not about making money. Data is the new currency.
When I was young I used to deliver food on my bike for companies at lunch before these lunch apps took off and took us out. We would pick up from multiple restaurants and repackage at our facility. Then deliver. We were fast and effective. It wasn't enough money and very dangerous. Now that I'm disabled I use food apps to help out workers because I've been there. I'm glad you are fighting for us.
The thing about the millennial lifestyle subsidy is the subsidy isn’t coming from the company, it’s coming from the underpaid worker.
My restaurant used to work with grubhub, but we made so little money through it our owner was on the phone with them angry before canceling our contract
Never once used any of these apps. Pay twice as much for cold fast food? How about no? Yall really stupid for wasting your money like this lol
How about just cut out the middle man ....go pick up your own food
If you’re able to spend money on lobbyists, you're absolutely turning a profit.   Also, perhaps those who are able-bodied can just go and pick up their food. My husband and I frequently get our food curbside. My younger sister and her family used these services multiple times a week and she complains they are broke. I pointed out that she would pay less if she'd just go through the drive through.    Honestly,  these meal delivery services are making it easier for people to eat unhealthy.
Food delivery is not profitable as a separate business. That's just a fact. Doesn’t matter how much these extortionists pretend they are "disrupting the business" or whatever. Even as they gouge restaurants, stiff drivers, and rip off customers, they lose millions. What a disgusting charade. I will never do business with them at my restaurant. I don't ever use those apps as a customer. Just because a service sounds convenient and desirable, doesn’t mean it's viable as a business.
I don't like feeling responsible for a person's livelihood.  This is much like the waiter/waiter stress, where you feel obligated to fund a bad business model and even after you tip the person, they are still disgruntled.  Yeah, I go to the restaurants or go to their sites to order delivery.
Irrelevant to the topic, but Harry Potter doesn’t need to be ruined if you actually analyze why JK Rowling was pegged a transphobe. What EXACTLY did she that was transphobic? Do you disagree with it? It’s very likely, if you’re not far left, and are at least a level headed liberal, you actually agree with her.
I still don't understand how these companies got so big without turning a profit. Its legalized exploitation.
I don’t believe for one minute that they are not making a profit. When you’re $15 order ends up costing you $35 at least. All the money is going to waste and cover up so they don’t have to pay taxes and to pay lobbyist. Delivery workers are only barely  paid minimum wage,  and tips. I was told by one restaurant not to order from Uber because my $15 sandwich would cost if I ordered from Uber $20. Plus all the service fees and junk fees on top. Are you kidding me? They are not making a profit? They are liars and bloodsuckers.
The horse thing is funny
I have never had food delivered to my house.
A food delivery person doesn’t get an hourly wage. They get a tiny percentage of the app charge. So your tip is important to their income. People don’t understand this. The independent worker has to pay for gas, vehicle upkeep, special insurance etc on his own. They do not mix up your order the restaurant fills the order. If you order groceries and the store doesn’t have product it’s not the drivers fault. If your grocery order needs substitutes be available to tell your delivery person what to substitute . Some people take back their tip after delivery. Pay in cash. So be  generous when you order food delivered to your home or office!😊
I've never used a food delivery app because a friend used one to send me food and it arrived cold.
Diddy headed for the Florence Colorado Supermax Federal lockup.How can there be any profitability in Delivery apps!!The valuations of these companies are artificially propped up.
I read Uber's most recent "investor update." It's all hype and very little substance. Here's some key takeaways from this EIGHTY-TWO SLIDE PRESENTATION; In FY 2023 they had 138 BILLION in gross bookings, total money transferred from consumer to company. And they crow about how amazing their 4 billion EBITDA is -- oh, wait, EBITDA is a pretty meaningless number used just to pump numbers up. The "EB" stands for "Earnings Before" and "ITDA" stands for all those pesky things that companies don't want to acknowledge: Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.   Here's the thing, if you take out a ten million dollar loan, use it to make eleven million dollars, and owe two million dollars between interest and taxes, good news you've just lost a million dollars, but EBITDA gets to show a million dollar "income!"  Anyway, Uber's GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) show only 1.11 billion in FY 2023, their first profitable year on record. If you look at the statement from Grubhub, the restaurant paid 3550 for promotions, aside from which Grubhub only (sorry, "only") took 36%. Let's assume, for argument's sake, that that restaurant paid for more promotions than they ought to have, and add 2250 for promotions to make it a 50/50 cut.   But let's do some quick, back-of-the-envelope maths here. If Grubhub and Uber take similar commission percents, we can figure that roughly 69 (nice) billion dollars went to the various businesses and 69 (nice) went to Uber. Somehow, Uber managed to take 69 (nice, ok I'll stop) billion dollars and turn it into... uh... one billion.   That's hilariously inefficient. They're spending 68 billion dollars on things OTHER than the actual literal product and service. Literally, where is that money going? A lot's going to executives (CEO makes 24 million/year), and if I'm reading this financial report correctly they bought 8 billion dollars of marketable securities (stock buybacks) and spent 2 billion dollars on stock-based compensation. Translation: The company is making shitloads of money, actually. they're very profitable, but of course in a way that only benefits a tiny percentage of people.   Their median pay for their employees (NOT DRIVERS, who are independent contractors) is about $70,000/yr. That's respectable, that's fine. But those median-paid employees aren't getting rich, they aren't the ones sucking ten billion dollars out of a company.   The way to make money in America is to have money.
The sad reality is that the alternative for most businesses was probably shuttering their doors if they didn't onboard to these apps.
For these reasons and others, I refuse to use these food-delivery apps. If the restaurant doesn't have a worker for delivery, I'll just go pick it up myself.   Or, better yet, I'll just cook my own food. Could it be an incinvenience to do that? Sure, but it saves me 75% of the cost for a half hour of work. If its $40 saved for 30 minutes of work using $10 of ingredients, its like I MADE $15 cooking FOR MYSELF. And I didnt need to exploit a restaurant that never wanted to be on those apps or the workers running that food because we've been enabling multi-billion dollar companies to claim "we're not actually profitably though" while tossing hundreds of millions of dollars at lobbyists. I know how to earn that profit, Uber. Hire me for 10 mil a year and I'll put a few hundred million in your coffers TONIGHT
No one "needs" to tip. This is literally you putting the onus on the customers instead of the business who hire the drivers. It would be better if doordash would limit the range of deliveries so drivers don't have to travel far, and it would also help if every restaurant had their own personal website state if they deliver or not, the distance they deliver and a menu so people could order directly from them *ONLINE*, instead of going through the hassle of having to call and ask. Restaurants have to do a bit of work as well if they want to retain customers instead of crying that doordash is fully to blame.
Millenials are the workers out here in the boonies of south central Pennsylvania.   They drive cars to the suburbs that use these services and have that expense because it is too hard to get around by bike.
Pro tip: if you plan to drive to deliver, check with your insurance carrier to be sure you're covered. Where I am, the apps required me to use my own auto coverage but my carrier would've upped the premium a TON (added miles = added risk). Totally not worth it, I found other work to do, fortunately.
I'm sick of hearing "people can't live without it".  Funny, my mom managed to live without it, and so did yours.  The number of utterly superfluous things corporations try to convince us we "can't live without" has become a farce.  NONE of the things we supposely depend on even existed two hundred years ago (other than food, and that was different, too), and yet we pretend not only that our lives depend on them, but that our lives couldn't even continue without them.  It's extraordinary how eager the human mind is to be bought.
I used to work for a pizza delivery place during college. They charged a 2.50 "delivery fee" my cut was .50 cannot even count the number of customers that thought that the delivery fee was my tip and left nothing. Or the number that knew better and would send their kids to the door with exact cash to avoid seeing the person they stiffed
I never used any of these apps but after hearing this I have made up my mind to continue to never use them.
If you don’t understand business models, try some other topics. And better don’t talk on topics you don’t understand
I am working for DoorDash. I had a customer try to fight me over a delivery two weeks ago.  He left a negative review.  I went from making 300  to 400 dollars a week to 80 to 150 dollars.
No I didn't use these apps during the pandemic I picked it up myself  The only people using these apps should be the elderly and disabled(including temporarily disabled) 🙄  Get off your fat ass and pick it up yourself 🙄  They also shouldn't allow deliveries longer than 15 minutes and no further than 7 miles
The in-depth analysis of the song by the Charlie Daniels band The devil went down to Georgia, was extremely insightful. And after listening to the song again I have to agree 100% with John Oliver here....🧐
I've caught Grubhub selling for a few of my local restaurants and massively hiking the prices up of each individual item. You can literally compare the menu side by side. That's not including their service fees and such.
I just got off an 18 month stint doing Uber/Uber Eats as a main job in Orlando. I now have $8500 in back taxes, I've been hit 4 times, and have lived paycheck to paycheck for the whole time. It's run me into the ground. Uber is SO predatory the drivers make HORRIBLE wages. Literally sub-$15 an hour before gas and expenses.
I delivered for go puff for a little while...  MFs wouldnt even tip sometimes.  The worst was 6/8 orders, nothing.  I could go on about it even further, but my point is that in the suburbs, the miles add up.  I couldnt use a bike...  i dont like this change in our culture at all  Edit:  my tips always made up at least half of my earnings.  Sometimes up to 66%.  If it was less than that, it was a really really bad day
I wouldn't use delivery apps if they paid me.  "Your food was sitting on the seat where my baby with a shit filled diaper sits but it's all good...NOT!"
Those companies are going to raise their commission on the restaurants which in turn will raise their prices in their menus, those small restaurants will all go bankrupt because no cloent who used to pay 10$ on a meal is willing to pay 20$ straight away. Only the big will survive and the small will fail. Get yourselves strapped in because we're about to go for a ride.
Is there's something that is surely cringe in this world is a 46 years old bank-teller looking rich british man saying shit like "massive L's" or joking about weed
Also: doordash only pays $2-3 per order max so nearly the ENTIRE pay is tip. i take orders that are wildly bad because theres nothing else and the competition for any orders is bad because there are far more dashers than orders coming in. not to mention the area i work is literally an hour from one side to the other with looooong stretched out 'gerrymander' looking sections so they can force you deliver culver's to a guy two towns over and get paid less than the gas it took to get there.  i have taken $1.5 orders. i have taken an order for $6 to go 15 miles (one way because they dont pay you to return to the place where all the restaurants are and you dont get picked first if you are nowhere near the food) and i have gotten literally $0 tip orders on a regular basis that were ony paid because DD gave me base pay of (again) $2-3 max
But at this point consumer isn’t getting hurt, give it time
You want to change this system, go pick up your own food…better yet make it yourself
I will not tip. It is not my job to determine how much they should and should not be paid. That is the job of their employer. I order something for a set price and that is the price I pay. Period.
Safety in rural areas is a big concern as well: i dont want to deliver to the back of some guys house in the middle of nowhere at 10:30 at night when im by myself as a trans person in the backwoods of rural WI. i have had so many gross encounters from people propositioning me for various things, people just straight up answering sans clothing, or (and this is the most common) rude people upset i didnt follow their ridiculous instructions to deliver their food nearly directly into their face.
Problem with delivery apps is that restaurants rarely provide the full menu to them. And the prices on apps are grossly inflated compared to actual menu prices. So everyone ordering ends up paying more for food than they normally would. I don’t understand why they’re so popular. Just get off your butt and go get something to eat.
Give it time, there will be laws to smack the fingers of app owners…which in the end will result in less dollars for the drivers
I never personally used these Apps, but bought the DASH AND UBER stock bc I could make a profit on the stock, not by working with these cutthroat apps😮
Used to use Grub Hub but several times in ONE month, we got the wrong order, and from different restaurants, so we know that the restaurants weren't lying and gave the driver the wrong order.  The last time the food was over two hours late and the restaurant said it had been picked up over an hour before. But when it finally arrived it was the wrong order and driver didn't even wait for us to bring it inside, they just dropped it at the door, knocked and ran.  When we demanded a refund, we eventually got everything back except the TIP!!!!!!! So the only one who got what they wanted was the one who screwed everything up. NEVER AGAIN!!!
Starting an orphanage!!! What a ridiculous comment!!!
I don't know man. We're probably 5 years out from a massive price hike on all of these, once they've finished buying each other up. I will bet you any amount of money, up to the value of the combined GDP of North America that the federal government will not do any meaningful trust busting here, since it will likely destroy the tech/venture capital business model (not that that's a bad thing in any way), especially since so much of the value of the American economy is tied up in Venture Capital, stock inflation, and private equity, meaning that a huge chunk of our economy is just smoke and mirrors. So I think ordering direct from restaurants will be the only sane option very soon.
John Oliver my man
John, is it possible for your team to produce an intelligible yet humorous video on why voting 3rd party is just a protest/throwaway/toddler-tantrum vote, and what would be required to become a viable multi-party system like some European democracies?  I can't seem to get it across to them, but maybe your team could.
tipping is not the solution
I assume the statistics finding that we are getting a service like this cheaper than it should be- have not seen my door dash bills… $65 for 2 bowels of Raman or Pho that is less than a mile away. With a menu price of 13-18$ a bowel. Even with a generous tip- this is not cheaper or better than it was when restaurants had their own drivers.
at 20:35 John Oliver precisely describes John D. Rockefeller's break 'em and buy 'em practices in the early 20th century oil business...which were eventually deemed monopolistic and illegal...
Doordash has a serious chokehold on my life. I spend 30% of my paycheck on food delivery. It's a problem. I tried to delete my account permanently one time, and I was back under a new email in less than a week.   Anyway, this is my cry for help.
If the restaurants were forced to pay servers full salary, and increase cost of food instead of a tipping system, they they'd easily absorb the delivery costs as well. It all works out better then you do things correct from the start.
What's annoying is I know this can all be done properly. In Switzerland we have a lot of these food delivery companies but because there are actually employee protection laws, the people are treated as staff with full benefits, and all the equipment including the bikes are provided. It's a bit more expensive yes but it's fair.
I don't order through apps. It's IDIOTIC for 99% of the public. Food at restaurants is overpriced to begin with. And the food is almost universally worse than you can make at home. Cooking isn't hard to learn. I feel for the plight of the younger folks nowadays, but have little sympathy if you're eating out all of the time (much less being stupid ordering delivery).
Grubhub itself gives me $3 each for most deliveries I spend 15% of my delivering income on gas. Yes, I have another "real" job
$30 for a chipotle bowl delivered and I'M the one getting extra value for my money?    At this point I try to avoid all tipped services.  That's an old business model that needs to be re-invented.  I can get my own food and I can't wait for robots to take over basic restaurant duties.
I assume he's going to get to this still watching but restaurants have thin margins. If the delivery app is taking half the gross, there's no profit to be had. The restaurant is losing money.   Losing money on a loss leader is a valid strategy. You come to Costco for $5 chicken and walk out with $600 in other goods. But the whole product can't be a loss leader.
People are surprised at truth social while these companies are no better
Still don't understand how the Ubers, Grub Hub are not making $ - is it because of high salaries and stock options at the top.  People are able to get apps going without claiming it costs billions.  And the notion of spending $180 million in CA to get statutory protection--and the legislature passed the greedy bill--all of it disgusting.
Too mild. And needs a systemic reform solution.
I ordered from my favorite Mexican restaurant a few days ago through Uber Eats. The tab came to $48. The meal was literally the same three tacos with beans and rice that can be ordered in the restaurant for $13.99 plus tax and tip. I was fairly blottoed at the time and didn't notice until it was too late to cancel. On my next visit to the restaurant, I made a comparison between the regular and delivery  prices.  In most cases, the delivery prices were between $3-8 higher. I don't know who gets to keep that extra cash, but for me, it makes food delivery effectively unaffordable.   Because I do not have a car, I have been using Instacart for grocery delivery.  This has also turned out to be an expensive proposition, but there is really no practical way to fit the 80lbs of dog food and haul it with my bicycle.
Right off the bat that BDSM-specialized food commercial made me hate society for the week . Might as well keep watching and keep receding into my hidey-hole.
I've never used these food delivery apps
Tipping was mentioned a few times here, but the most important thing was left out:  ALWAYS TIP IN CASH!! (if you intend to tip at all)  you have no idea what margin of your tip will actually go to the workers you intend it for. that problem still exists with cash but at the very least you make it slightly harder for companies to steal workers money.
The best way to get rich is develop a small business & then sell to a big business! It happens everyday in every industry!
Never used these apps not once. I'm not a lazy sack of shit.
Dang it, Human Squidward! My husband just left on a week long business trip and I’m watching our toddler solo. Now I feel guilty that I literally just ordered UberEats right before watching this video. 😂
The real problems here are car dependency and lack of universal healthcare.
I used grubhub a couple times in 2021; one time I had a wrong order and the other time the food arrived hours late and stone cold. Between trying to correct it and seeing how rushed/sad the drivers were, I knew something was very wrong with the whole thing and I never ordered food that way again. By the way, I don't buy that there is a 'subsidy' to customers. Somebody is making big money at the corporate level. You have to be really dense not see how exploitive this system is
Tipping culture is still bad.
I ordered with UberEats once, saw the live monitoring of the delivery driver and never did it again.
"The main winner so far has actually been us, the customer." Yeah......I don't consider paying $30 for a $6 coffee winning. I refuse to use food delivery apps, but my wife wanted a coffee one time when I was unavailable and she payed $30 to get a coffee delivered. (She doesn't drive.) The coffee shop was three miles away and it took four hours to get her delivery and she overpaid by 5x.
YES! Please do not leave a poor review for food delivery, online resellers, (eBay, Etsy etc) or Airbnb unless you take a minute to think about their service. Food delivery does not control food quality, resellers do not control shipping cost or speed or are magically able to find lost packages or account for buyers who do not read the description. Hosts should be contacted if you have an issue and take responsibility if they did not read the details when booking. Your tantrum when leaving a review can mean paying the bills or not.
Let's also remember a lot of people put down bad reviews just to show off to other people
The food is cold and overpriced
LOL , what is causing this is humanists throwing away established sources of morality..  Why use services to expedite food, when the issue is a lack of concern for others.. If people were concerned about their workers they would set aside more money and time for their workers to be well rested and safe. Then they wouldn't need to use food delivery apps, they could fix their own meals.. And none of this would be an issue, certainly it would help the environment, by reducing the carbon footprint.. But if people are stressed and bent on eating junk food, they will end up type 2 diabetics like me, concerned about sugar as, it slows down the repair of ulcers on ones legs.. Its not until your health is threatened that you learn of the life you were leading..  And how being stressed by your job was killing you, to individuals in control of your life who are only handing down their problems to everyone else, problems passed down from others not intending to change cause nothing moves hem, especially when they don't believe in absolute truths and therefore can't identify themselves as evil,  call themselves humanists, and are eager to  eliminate religions cause they believe its the reason why there is no unity.. What should I say, when you have no real clue what your choices are doing to kill yourself?
"The Greatest Country in the World", Ladies and Gentlemen...
When are we going to say NO! to these tech bullies? Looking at you Amazon.
“Groceries are too expensive!”   “Let’s Door Dash 5 days a week.”  🤦‍♀️
I give every order, driver and restaurant a 5-star review, even if everything sucked. Lol  Edit: your quick bit on millennials was personal.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ouch, man.  O u c h
Fun fact: In India multiple apps promise to deliver under 10 mins, yes TEN MINUTES. Nachos, Ice Creams, Books, Dishwasher or a PS5 whatever you need gets delivered in 10 mins
Tipping is a ridiculous model for paying workers.  No worker should depend on a different individual's decision making every moment they're working on what their compensation should or will just plain be.
I'm sorry, but you need to address the service fee, which is why I do not tip.
What is it with John Oliver and horses?
Uber in the Dominican Republic charge 45% of the total trip as commission. They call the drivers "partner" but take 45%
All this madness just because people are too lazy to go get their damn food. I'm never using one of these platforms
I’d argue that the devil cheated by adding the band of demons. The competition was supposed to be Johnny vs the devil
"gay parts should go to gay actors" is one of the dumbest ideas i have ever heard. Stop being a part of the problem.
Hey, I take issue with saying the Devil should've won the fiddle competition. The demons joining in with other on what's supposed to be a FIDDLE competition is wrong. Oh also, great story about the food delivery apps.
It's hard to feel sorry for anyone involved in this horrifically bad business model that is food delivery for individual or small group orders.  As a customer, at the very best, you're going to get a poorer version of a (typically) unhealthy meal and you're going to pay more for it.  Somebody gifted me a $50 Uber Eats gift card one Christmas and I refuse to use it.  It's worth more to me as a re-gift item, to somebody else, than it would be if I were to use it myself.  They basically did a magic trick where they turned $50 -> $40 and since I got this thing maybe 3 years ago I turned that $40 -> $30 due to inflation.     What this is really all about is establishing a name BEFORE autonomous delivery vehicles (drones, cars, carts, whatever) are ready.  All of these companies know that as long as it's people doing the delivery it'll never make sense from a financial perspective.  The current business model requires a ton of people who can't budget well but somehow have tons of money to spend but unfortunately all of those pandemic handouts have dried up.
John Oliver, our sparkling gem in a sea of crap. Thank you ❤
My favorite Skype related memory will always be when I finally got so frustrated with it that I decided I was never using it again. Steaming mad, I sent a text message to one of my other friends who grew to hate Skype. I wrote “Congratulations, Skype. You win. You’ve finally made your app so frustrating that I’m never going to use it again.” As soon as I hit send, iMessage knew that I had sent a text starting with “Congratulations” and popped up with confetti and balloons. I was so caught off guard, my anger instantly disappeared. Still never used Skype again, though. 😂😂😂
"...way more fun listening to the devil. Happy Easter, by the  way." You;'re the best, John.
Why do reviews even exist? They can’t be trusted on any level.
Doordash drivers that delivering for Petco or Petsmart are incompetent beyond belief.  They insist on using Google Maps for their deliveries, but Google Maps often has the addresses in the wrong place & these morons refuse to look at the house numbers & just deliver to the wrong house all the time.
The USA is in a race to make the gilded age return
“You have to tip” why is a tip standard and not reserved for the above and beyond? Here in europe tipping is not expected
John is so off-base with this horse shit.
My old boss pulled this same 💩 saying we were all independent contractors so he didn't have to pay workman's comp or disability. I was injured on the job. My disc at the bottom of my spine blew out on the job. When I woke the next morning, the spine had pinched off the cord, and I was paralyzed from the waist down. After a handful of hours counting down thinking that would somehow make my feet move. I had to crawl on the ground using my arms to get to the bathroom. It was crawling around that slowly took the pressure off my cord. In 3 days I was able to get to a chiropractor who helped at the time. Inversion table has been the best help since. Had a couple of surgeries. Wasn't able to work or get any workman's comp or anything. I was completely left on my own. Just like the man on that bike
But now im confused why i have the delivery fee and the service fee if the restaurant is the one paying for the service. And on top of all that we have to tip.
We need to eliminate tipping from the face of the earth.  It’s a ridiculous concept. If you are in the food business, a core part of your business is getting your product to your customers.  Pay your workers a real wage for executing your core business.
I love John Oliver.
As a person who does Uber from time to time, I can tell u I don't do Uber Eats, most of the time the order pays $3.00 or less for 45 mins of ur time plus the gasoline and usage of car
"You can't spell Millennial without 3 massive L's" is a sentence that will haunt me for years, maybe decades if I make it that long
Capitalism at it's best ! 🤦🏼‍♂️
I don't and won't order delivery.
I'm my 94 year old dad's delivery app.
I lost so much money being a delivery driver for Dominos. I told people years ago that were essentially paying to put our lives at risk for a quick buck that’s going into a future medical bill or damage to our vehicles. I hit two deer in one night delivering in bumfuck nowhere for a tiny tip, I worked 12 hours and brought home $39 with tip and hourly pay, oil changes every 2-3 weeks, multiple other expenses from increased wear and tear on my car and driving in peoples god awful driveways, multiple deliveries where I’m almost positive I would have been robbed under the right circumstances (I told people that our cars are tracked for safety and efficiency reasons so if I’m here too long then I get a call from the store and if I don’t answer then cops are called immediately), and a final kicker is that multiple young drivers have been brutally assaulted and robbed and were left with MASSIVE medical debt and all they got from dominos was harassing calls asking when they were coming back to work. Dominos is an absolute good awful company and I genuinely hope they go under one day. That job contributed to my PTSD
This doesn't even mention the problem of ghost kitchens.
Boycott these apps
A DoorDash driver picked up the wrong order for us and after verbally threatening us said that it was this food or nothing. Lol.  Neither the restaurant or DoorDash will take accountability which I believe is another issue with these apps. Who’s responsibility do mess ups land on now?
THANK YOU ya know,  ive been wondering for decades how the hell Johnny got away with that piece. Devil smoked him no doubt
Lets not forget , if food delivery apps go out of business today, restaurants will not reduce their prices to pre app days.  Like we experienced after the pandemic
That bakery in Howell being extorted by Grubhub pissed me off as a Michigander...  😡🖕
If I owned a restaurant, I would simply charge 58% more on delivery apps. You can call in and complain, I would tell you what's up and to deal with it. Or you could come pick it up at the regular price. I went to a Jersey Mike's once and the online order printer was spitting out order after order non-stop and the staff looked so flustered, and I asked "Do you get paid extra for working harder to fulfill those orders?" and the dude looked at me with a self-realization stare lol.
THEFT
Squid Game
The only way to tip is in CASH!
The gig economy reminds me of people selling themselves for any work at the lowest wage in Columbia in Bioshock: Infinite.
Why would you still need to tip when they passed a law to pay them a livable wage? It's like the concept and purpose of tipping has lost all meaning to people.
End-Stage Capitalism
I’m just gonna say it… Edopt sounds like $1 million idea
2:45 Microsoft owns Skype, so they're the ones who really f-ed up. Bought the company, integrated the tech into Teams, shelved the project. "I'll skype you" coulda been a thing lol
Tips make up to a third or half of their pay, you say? Maybe it's just the area they live in, because I've been delivering in SoCal for over 9 years, and tips have been approximately 60% of my pay. The getting's good. 💰
I refuse the app. Pay delivery fees & other surcharge on top of the over priced food
john oliver why don't you have any damn subtitles
I’m getting orphanage money from gig work 🤣
This countrys treating the ability to chase unlimited income and become rich the same as fking lower income in every direction is mind blowing. Capitalism is screwing the lower income so hard. And harder every year
So my wife and I deal with this to this day. We run a small neighborhood Pub, only take phone orders. We get emails and pressures from DoorDash, Uber eats that we are requested by customers. We’ve had delivery people come in saying they have an order and hold up service because we don’t and have had delivery people order it and deliver it and then get complaints that it wasn’t up to snuff even though we don’t participate on any ordering app. Some of our friends started using ordering during the pandemic and now can’t get rid of them because they do make some money but pay a body load in costs. Basically apps are super convenient, they cost the restaurant more than it should, and the drivers are doing their best but getting worked over
But also, at least part of the problem are the entitled people who want their food NOW 🙄
Rather than encouraging customers to tip, encourage businesses to pay their workers properly
So glad to hear John say you should pretty much never rate less than 5 stars. At worst, just don’t rate at all. Everyone has a bad day now and then. For the love of pizza, cut the workers some slack.
if anything in our modern society is the equivalent to late Roman decadence, this is definitely it!
I hope John tackles music streaming platforms now
We need universal single payer healthcare.
And all of that is exactly why I always pick up food myself
Happy Easter.. by the way 😄
I'm kind of confused about this tip thing and the US. Don't get me wrong, I know what tip means is just it looks like is REALLY a thing in the US, pretty much obligatory every single time and not a small recognition here and there to waiters being nice.
Ist told in this Video. That every customer makes Money By using the  food Delivery Services. Cause of all the billionairs invested Money U get more then u pay for. Without the Investors Money the Service would BE more expensive. Like streaming Services. Or the New online gambling Plattformen where ubget huge bonuses from investores Money WHO invested in New Markets.  They all are much to cheap to earn Money now.
I would have liked to see him talk more on how shady some of these apps have gotten with things like surge pricing and tip hiding. Door dash has recently started hiding how much you’ll make until the order is delivered, because too many people were seeing the 0-$1 and saying “fuck this, your chicken sandwich is mine now Daryl.”
The trigger warning was hilarious...so true
I have never used a delivery app. Or delivery in the last 20 years
Skype has always sucked
Raise your hand if you remember in the eaaaarly 90's they had a backpack, marketed to school children, that was a literal rectangle block. Can't remember the name (obvi) but I had one in the 6th grade.
independent contractor is the biggest problem in the world
Open an Orphanage...Lovin it!!!
As a former Uber driver please tip well for any ride or delivery!! A $5 to $10 tip needs to be standard. I rarely use any of these apps because they are expensive and they take a huge cut from the driver or delivery worker.
Shifting the burden of paying employees by spouting nonsense like "you absolutely have to tip because otherwise the person working for the multibillion dollar corporation doesn't get paid" is an interesting take from @lastweektonight Further implying that the highway robbery prices they charge is actually subsidized is comical. Crazy to see you shilling, honestly.
I used to deliver for Ubereats and when I lived in Texas Favor.
We'd regulate this but instead morons keep letting the GOP into office.
I was an Uber driver for 2 years in Los Angeles and did thousands of rides. I moved to a small town and got a job at a local pizza place doing deliveries and made way more money for less hours of work. I also drove about 20,000 miles less doing pizza delivery. These gig apps don't care about their workers.
i'm in restaurants and ignore emails/calls from these places all the time. it's an absolute ripoff. consider this about the featured restaurant that paid 58% of their fees to grubhub; when you consider food cost, labor percentage, and other day to day costs they probably ended up losing money by being signed up with this app. if you're in restaurants, do not sign up with these companies, and i highly encourage everyone not to use these apps.
We live in a shitty modern boring dystopian society.
Where is our COPS but for Delivery Drivers?
I make a grand a week from food delivery in my own boss it’s awesome
warreb burrow; They received about $19 per order. Look at their menu that's about right. Now are they gouging the customers? YES!
I don't get the US. Like you literally say in the same clip that these platforms take up to 48% of the money and somehow the end user is still obligated to tip instead of saying the platforms who give them orders, in the first place should pay a living wage?  El, oh el.
I just ate horrible pad thai wtf 😅
I am lucky to live in a small town where most people know each other (city ppl just shuddered 😱). I tip more than the initial options given by those apps because I know people arent getting what they earned. I always leave a 5 star rating even if it is a terrible delivery and rude driver, which does happen. I wish I could say it is only because of my generosity that i do this, but it is also a sort of social investment. Doordash (or whatever) and the drivers pay attention to the customers closely, as im sure delivery app workers can attest to. The best way to get the most out of these apps is to be a good customer... to the WORKERS. Tell them thanks and to have a good day and to drive safe. It's totally a free thing to do. I already know when i open a delivery app that im not going to be happy with the price, that's on me. Makes no sense to take out corporate greed fueled resentment on the driver. That's how we are kept disconnected from each other and is precisely the mechanism 'big boy' companies use to wash their hands of social accountability. And it's so CRAZY how since ive been doing that, my food arrives consistently intact and warm... or cold... 🤔  No excuses. Anyone can do this.
Delivery apps are a trend on the way out. I see those backpacks in trash cans in Berlin. I found a nice one once in the river that my dog now uses for her winter outdoor travel home.
Brilliantly done.. but only four stars ....the glaze comment was a bit much.. Question.. no lady delivery persons.. Just another male dominant gig??
Please do a follow up on rideshare apps. They’re ripping 50-70 % of each fare from the drivers.Drivers have all the costs and risk why are drivers only getting 30-40 % on each fare?
Ohhh the writing team missed out on one news story that would have tied together the no tips and the rating joke: google "tennessee man dips balls in salsa"
I always think that the guy in the Super Bowl ad featuring Diddy was creepy and intimidating AF😂
The food apps make everything twice as expensive and by the time it gets to you 95% of the time it is cold. And I lost my car when the parking lot of my apartment building collapsed with it parked in it. So, with no car, I should be using the delivery apps. But they are too expensive and the food is either wrong, cold, or both. I've used a food delivery app once and I've heard nothing good from friends that have also used them more often. I don't get why people use them so much unless it is some extenuating circumstances🤷‍♂️
I always tip but I’d tip more if I wasn’t already paying a service fee and a delivery fee.  They should add the tip into the delivery fee.
There is no way that I’m paying less than it’s worth.  I pay a tip and a delivery fee.
Sounds like a classic middle man scam to me 😕
How can they not be making money? They should stop marketing. We know about it.
Don't forget about the flying leech, Mosquito.
Rating bad service from a delivery person 5-stars is as ridiculous as giving a horrible AirB&B  host 5-stars, they'll continue to do a half assessed job without  knowing  they're doing a bad job. AirB&B hosts expect 5 stars and if you give them less, the give you bad grades and then no-one will rent to you
"You can't spell 'Millennial" without three massive Ls" - I have rarely taken such direct and powerful psychic damage.
What you missed from driver -  - DD pressures you to take low paying orders to maintain a high acceptance rating or you get severely limited on when you can work - They gate “higher paying orders” behind this also. Something like 70% acceptance rate  - As of the last month, if you take more than one order at a time they don’t pay you for both anymore, just the same $2 rate - There are a LOT of horrendous orders that are overly long or very low tip. Some flat out cost the driver money. - Despite charging huge fees from restaurants (15-30% of every order) and customers (service and delivery fees) for each order, they still only pay drivers $2 a delivery. Read that again. - They will hide the real tip amount from you. Uber will also hide the address you are supposed to go to until after you pick the order up. It could go super far for all you know.  - Despite a lot of drivers having a hard time logging in the last few months, DD has been heavily pushing a recruitment promotion to get even more driver and saturate it even more - 75% of my earnings are from tips.
Okay honestly the writing for the bits in this episode was crazy good.
That sort of gig work will destroy your vehicle. I can't imagine how anyone makes any money and keeps thier vehicle together
Iggy's in Detroit stopped delivering for now because the DoorDash drivers kept STEALING THE FOOD from the customers!!!🤦‍♀️
excellent. thank you.
How is nobody in the comments talking about what happened last Sunday when this entire full episode was available for a few hours until the channel took it down and on top of that didn't put out this video with the main story until Thursday 😅  Idk kinda feels like we are being jerked around as an audience to me
This is Capitalism at its best. Squeezing everything out of the next person for itself. Cause, “Capitalism” just needs to make money. It doesn’t have any standards or morals, It just needs to make “MONEY”. That’s Capitalism at work. Now I realize it’s our system but people MUST realize that our system sucks. With their thirst for “Money” look at everyone else who’s left behind. It’s a lot of us. We work for them and the government. But we aren’t reaping enough rewards.
I work food delivery as my main job,here in Europe we have Glovo,Wolt...everything is the same here😂...but at least we got bags,jackets,t shirsts from the company,yes i didnt broke a leg but when i fell i hurt my liganent but i was on the bike i was still working despite being advised to not to,apps algorithm i f...us the same way here..everything is the same
Example #518 of "things that don't happen elsewhere". The U.S. is such a joke.
^shoutout to anyone who contacts custome support, cause it is the same thing there when it comes to grading. Unless you are really sure that something was done wrong because of a worker and that the correct worker is graded, allways give 10 points. Even if the the question is:" would  you  recommend the compayny to a friend?" YES ofc. They only did not solve my issue that started 7 month ago and still canno give me any information about a timeline when it will be fixed... 10/10!.  Because no matter what they ask you and what you answer it will only affekt the worker who handled your case. And the leway the workers have is decided by the company. So if you are dissatisfie, write a letter to the ceo, they will have a special team dedicated to letters adressed to the CEO. Never threaten with a lawyer, even if you are a lawyer yourself your complain will not have more worth, rather less. Only lawyers representing a client are treated differently, and letters from courts.  I have worked for all the big telephone companies, for Google for Electricity and Gas Companies and the are all the same. Oh and complains against telesales are the most useless those people have to bend the truth and lie about anything but the prices to meet the targets that the company is asking from them. Trust me, I know what I am talking about.
Grubhub rips off people who don't even use their delivery services. Recently ordered pickup via them with the button saying "No fee to order." Found out later they upcharged each menu item several dollars more than the restaurant listed on their menu. That is false advertising. Had they said prices are higher by X%, I would have considered that fair warning.    For such tactics, they have been successfully sued by DC and Chicago. Now last week, LA county has joined the fray. I rarely use such apps preferring to order directly from the restaurant itself for pick-up but some places no longer give me that option. I will never use such apps again. They rip off restaurants, their own workers, and customers.
This program should grow to have an arm that works on making a change through development of solutions and exercising pressure on bad doers. I am sorry to learn about the suffering of delivery champs but what can we do next. Well we can pressure for a legislation that forces delivery companies to hire them and ban independent contractors. Things like that
It’s better to be an independent contractor. Work when you want and write everything off.
It's so crazy -- ask anyone and they can just outline what needs to be fixed about delivery apps. Take DoorDash, for example.   Over the last few years I have had short periods where it has helped me a lot to use it more, so I started to see some patterns. Started to get long delays of when the food would get to me (while seeing the driver's location just...stopped somewhere else), literally one of my bags of food or a drink not being given to me, and the order being left somewhere that was not the delivery location when I selected "hand it to me". Yeah, sooooo crazy that people don't want to tip in advance for someone to throw their order at their neighbor's porch. I've seen photos of deliveries left in trees, gutters. Video of a driver taking a photo that they had 'dropped off' an order and then stolen it. [edit:] I also started to notice something was weird when the people dropping off the food didn't match the name or picture of the supposed delivery person. I have since learned that crap drivers who get booted from the platform just start using other identities. It doesn't count as shutting bad actors out if you do it with a revolving door to just let them right back in.  Then take the restaurants themselves. Ordered a tall stack of a specific kind of pancake? Get a stack half the size of plain pancakes. Things that are straight-up the wrong food. I once had to discover that I had been given a slightly different version of the food I ordered after I bit into it and discovered they had given me something I'm allergic to. At least in now that I am in Utah, I have learned that you are gambling that you get whatever the restaurant deigns to send to you. Here it isn't just a bunch of the drivers that suck, but the restaurants too that are either lazy or can't read.   And so many desperate, hungry people have exploited the refund system that now if you just want recourse for literally not getting what you paid for, your account can get flagged as "not eligible for refund do to account history". Yeah...done with that. Glad I can walk now and I have my own kitchen.
I just don't use em, it seemed like an added cost I didn't need. Why pay an independent,  inexperienced, and underinsured driver contracted to Bay Area Randroids? When I can skip over to my favorite places on my break or on my way home? Foolishness, laziness, and dumbassery.
I just love Oliver, his view is soo refreshing and funny.
What a shitty way to promote food apps. I totally disagree with you John. Its those companies who are responsible for their workers. Do you really think tipping more to delivery people is gonna have those companies change of heart? Things could take worse turn I am afraid. And if there is so much competition, they should just quit instead of having blood of innocent delivery people on their hands.
The CEO of Doordash was compensated more than $1 million per day.  The companies are highly profitable.
Murika...  Proudly haven't used delivery for a decade 💪  Also one thing : it's yet another system promoting laziness and sedentary lifestyles and basically slowly killing people through poorer health, both physical and financial...
I try to order directly with the restaurants but even then i still get deliveries grom DoorDash drivers. I try to tip in cash to offset some of the imbalance. I hope it helps
GrubHub STILL does shit like that on Thursday night service a driver randomly popped up at my restaurant, we absolutely we’re not open yet. It was so early we hadn’t turned the tablet on yet 🤯
The solution is pretty easy, stop taking sleazy jobs, become an actual independent contractor that can set their wages. Like that un a few months they either start offering decent wages or stop their service altogether.
I remember when I was driving for door dash the best delivery I got on a regular basis was a guy who lived in a trap house and just got a Latte from Dunkin every day and tipped $8. I even got the kid on the dirt bike who reported my arrival to wave at me regularly.
Can we just abolish tipping already? Please?
There really is NO money for the people working the deliveries.    Its pretty much min. wage at best.
I briefly worked for Door Dash, until they refused to pay a $150 bonus.   Long story short,   I hadn't driven for them in a while, and I got an email offering a $150 bonus if I completed 4 deliveries over a weekend.  So I made the delivers, but then realized the bonus wasn't paid .   I contacted DoorDash, and they told me that I didn't qualify for the bonus, even though I definitely did, and all the evidence to prove it.   When I tried to escalate the fight for the bonus, they flat out lied amd told me that I did not qualify.   Needless to say I have not worked for Door Dash since!
doordash is actually the one app that is for their workers, they only hire and keep workers with perfect driving records and good reviews, but they offer cheap health insurance ( I have blue cross while I take multiple specialty medications and see specialty doctors and pay $50 a month with no copay) they also offer workman's comp with no penalty to the worker. aswell as things like hospital indemnity insurance for less then $5 a month  but also help with car accidents that insurance wont cover. I have been a worker for them for years and witnessed alot of good feedback from restaurants( in south florida) and workers, the only complaints i hear are from workers who are looking for easy money and dont want to work for a good position in the app, and that doesn't mean speed, it means you leave the customer satisfied, like updating the customer along the way like if their order is taking a long time or if a store doesn't have exactly what they want. a little effort makes a big difference.
Hey, there's a crap APP for that!
Flash floods?????????? Wtf I feel so guilty ordering food then afterwards it starts raining 😭😭   Abroad I remember some delivery apps have punishments that directly cut their salaries if they deliver late (dependent on how much of an asshole the recipient is)
The orphanage comment is the most out of touch comment ive heard in years! they dont realize people dont have side hustles cause theyre doing OK theyre doing it cause REAL JOBS ARENT ENOUGH!
JO: "What happened Skype?!?!?!" Gates: "Enshittification"
Business design is design to be a side hustle... If partner demand full pay, better close shop than continue....  And restaurant, read your contract, this is business not charity  For those got cited on app without consent, lawsuit  Doneeeee....
@LastWeekTonight Please do an exposé on Amazon’s egregious treatment of third party sellers, this is a huge issue that widely goes unnoticed. 3P sellers account for more than half of all Amazon sales, yet have no protection and get bullied by Amazon in the same way that delivery drivers are bullied by the delivery apps.
Not to mention, you need rideshare insurance for your vehicle regardless of if you do Uber or Doordash. I was in a car accident, and Geico refused to cover me because it was while I was delivering food part time and didn't have rideshare insurance and was using my vehicle for business purposes and not personal.
The thing I hate about doordash now is their new tipping system and how they ask you to tip before your food even gets to you. I don’t mind tipping but I’ve had issues with my order not getting to me on time or they can’t find me a dasher. I’ve had an issue where the dasher dropped off my food at the wrong house to! Luckily it was my neighbor across the street, got me looking like a porch pirate when I had to go retrieve it smfh and I tipped $3!  The new tipping system will show the dashers how much and if the customer tipped or not to which I find it ridiculous because dashers can choose to accept or decline a order if they don’t like the tip that is given. Smh they need to understand that tip goes base off on how well the service is so they shouldn’t be asking and charging for tips before customers even get their order.
20:26-20:39 BINGO
I just order Domino's. They still hire their own drivers
Calling the restaurants directly from now on
I used to work Doordash and Grubhub. Don't use them much as a customer, but when I do, I always tip way more than 15% because I know what it's like on the other side.
I’ve never used a delivery app and never will. Only direct delivery from the restaurant. Or go there and get it. Basically I always make my own food 😂😅😊
US citizen John Oliver seems waaaay more chill than the stuck up version who didn't want to be deported
I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way about Skype.  Got damn, how do you fuck a product up that badly? 100% we used to skype each other, but after all the walled gardens went up, they lost their way.
Sorry john probably the first disagreement I've had with you. Delivery persons of the apps pushed hard for prop 21 and they dug their own grave not doing their homework on it. And don't promote tipping culture. No one has to tip.. ever. People on these apps need to stand their ground and fight a battle. It's no one's job to do it for them.
They can't say they don't make profits if they have money to lobby politicians. Lobbying is NOT a legitimate business expense.
Now do one on Amazon delivery
Delivery food services has gone downhill tremendously I don’t use it as often as I use to anymore. They be finding and coming up with anything they can to charge and tax you more on your orders. Same goes to restaurants to, like Carl’s Jr, they don’t even sell their burgers/sandwiches in meals anymore, they sell the items individually so that customers will pay more and get tax more smh. Delivery services also tricks their customers into signing up with promos and deals they have making them think they are saving more money when they aren’t. Doordash has this promo/deal you can sign up for, for free deliveries but what I’ve notice is that if you sign up for that promo, you get taxed more on your order, so basically they’re just adding your delivery fee into your tax you’re not saving and your getting charged for the promo you signed up for 😒
After being a fan since the beginning, and being a true stoner since then, this is the first episode that truly spoke to me.
If you're using apps for your food and rides... you're the problem with the human race. go get groceries and learn to cook.  walk if you have to. Reality does not owe you convenience.
When I was a waiter I HATED dealing with food delivery app drivers. We get no tip out of it so it’s basically working for free, and sometimes they’d demand that someone walk the food outside and call our phone repeatedly until we did
Does the Internet make terrible people or are terrible people just using the Internet?
I don't find that the customer wins either. The food arrives cold and as you've outlined, can be unsanitary if not probably packaged.
So why is GrubHub still allowed to operate? If corporations are people, they should be locked and when they commit crimes. Any business caught doing criminal acts should be immediately and totally shut down.
My Wife and I tip very well for many things. If you don't you are a A$$ hole.
Whoa that’s crazy that M street bakery was mentioned. That’s right by my parent’s house.
So many A$$ Hole comments.
I love you John (except for your spider like fingers...and I too am high as a giraffes pussy X)
184 million spent instead of paying their employees? Instead of paying restaurants? Boycott GrubHug!
Grubhub has always been the worst.  I’ve had only one good experience out of about 6 with them.  Also had the experience of food the restaurant doesn’t serve.
In brick and mortar restaurants, tips are taxed. They IRS assumes a certain percentage is earned. They can and do tax on tips that never happen.
TIP = This Insane Practice
So they take 30-58% of the money spent for the food, pay the deliverer crap and claim they are losing money? What, are the paying all the executives too much?
In Florida, a food delivery driver was kidnapped and cut up into pieces by a gang member from up north who wasn't supposed to get out of prison.
I used to work at a donut shop. It wasn't the glazed donuts you needed to worry about.
I live in NY. Why would I tip? The city made a law which raises the workers wages and practically forces me to tip them. My tip has been given, I'm not going to be guilted into tipping more on top of that.
The devil won the fiddle duel 100%
Customers just severely undervalue what it takes to deliver their order.  If you're not tipping $10-20 minimum, you're part of the problem and should get off your ass and do pick up instead. All this crap about the employers should just pay more is just stupidity from people who don't understand basic math.  The customer ALWAYS pays the wages you morons, where do you think employers in any business get the money?  Saying they should pay a livable wage is always a bad faith argument but its spouted by every mouth breathing idiot that doesn't want to tip at all.  You should get a 50% service charge added to everything you do in life just to ensure employers can "pay a living wage".
Drunk/stoned people tip well too!!  I heard from a friend
@22:36:  No on tipping! _`Tipping`_ is a form of legalized theft; it is immoral and unethical! It should be abolished!
Here in Philly, it's gotten ridiculously expensive to order from those apps. I just don't do it anymore - it's not worth it.
I looked into starting an orphanage on the side, but it turns out that orphans are lousy tippers, so what's the point?
Time for these companies to unionize
it's the same as how energy cannot be created or destroyed -- profits dont/cant actually exist. for any1 2 show a movie @ a theater the cost would be same as any $ u would bring in basically. it has been said every1 has the same income: $10K
I work for doordash, I also delivered pizza for over two and a half years. I make 25-30 an hr w doordash , customers can control tips, yet if you don't keep your rating up, or don't know how to deliver food, you will lose orders. People order wierd shit, condoms and honey..stuff like that. All orders are sealed or taped closed, we deliver alcohol, basic groceries. Far more than side hustle when can make 700 a week, ive been an independent contractor for 14 years. Its how you have more than one job! Which you need to pay for anything today. Btw I also work for the State as seasonal laborer. Doordash has insurance for accident or injury while dashing, also has money magagment and savings accounts. 1/3 of the other dashers I've met are single moms supporting themselves through it so... Not to mention the amount of business brought to small restaurants who access new customers, more than half of my deliveries are local businesses not big corporations. 👍🤣5 stars, it only takes a few bad customers to ruin a rating. Please do support or we don't get the deliveries
Restaurants already have a lower profit margin then most other businesses.
IMO, a job should NEVER rely on tips to make it a 'living.' Jobs should make living possible which is the employers responsibility.  Customers should not feel pressured to make up for a bad employer's shortcomings by being required to tip. It comes down to bad employers being the bad guys in this tipping issue. As a matter of fact, I will cease going to or using a service where tipping is required. I will not be manipulated by a business I choose to patronize.
So what if GIG workers at GRUB HUB, Uber Eats and ??  became UNIONIZED
My menus are magneted to my refrigerator
That millennial joke is so perfect. Please give whoever wrote that a raise 🤣
delivery guys need to have the right to give reviews on consumers as well!
I just cook now. Im good at it.
Bro, I'm gonna open up a restaurant, Hire like 4 drivers and offer food delivery. The tip WILL BE enforced on the check automatically and payments will be all on credit/debit cards I will pay them a decent wage and I swear it'll be better than using these apps. Ever since my wife and I noticed how crappy these services are, I decided to be the man and GO GET THE FOOD MYSELF. She's happy, that's all that matters.
Can we acknowledge that food meant to be consumed within minutes of being prepared is not worth paying more to eat cold?
aRE vAMPIRES lEECHES?
The founder of Postmates is beyond cringe. I will certainly Cease and Desist our office's Postmates usage. No means No😂
just to clarify Microsoft made the strategic decision to let Skype die and and to push Teams
I ain't gonna start tipping delivery people just coz John Oliver tried to shame me into doing so, lol I never tip. Must've saved a thousand dollars by not tipping so far
I never did delivery during the Plandemic, i would just go pick it up.
As an Uber delivery driver I just want to say: help!
The laugh track is so much cringe.
John Oliver should be deported.
Ok, glad you support tipping
Corp greed..
Oh Johnny, you`re such a loser. I`d love to meet you for 3 minutes because that would be all I would need to realign you. You used to be funny but your political gibberish is just annoying enough to come see you, personally.
The best joke in this whole episode is that John Oliver hasn't seen the movie Sophie's Choice.  Come on man, don't lie to us.  We all know you watch that like a soccer mom watches Hallmark movies during Xmas.
Working for door dash is some kind of modified version of Begging
I'm rather simple. I don't use any of those apps,   I call the restaurant directly and pay with cash, and a good tip for the convenience of a delivery when I need it.  I don't need an app, just make a call and done rather well.  Often, its the owner that delivers in person.  If its not well, no more business from me to them.  Its rather rare.  My teenagers? They have learned as they work in that industry.  Well one does.  The other is so strong and determined to make his own life.  Still loves family and is making his life. Any healthcare costs are covered here by our medical system here and their pharmaceutical costs.  It is a balance.  This is in Canada...  I do worry about my kids. Well, they are adults or think they are.  I'm having a lot of fun teaching my kids about life.
It's not just negative reviews costing the driver's their jobs, I know DoorDash in particular will not give any offers worth completing if you haven't accepted at least 70% of the orders that you receive and you have a choice to either accept or decline these offers. Gig workers are supposed to be independent contractors, yet DoorDash creates so many parameters for their "drivers" to follow that the whole independent part becomes meaningless. Either make your drivers employees or stop penalizing the poor drivers who don't want to drive 20 miles round trip for $5.00.
Sir, I work these jobs and I haven’t started watching this episode yet but I know you’ll expose them for the slave operations that they are.   THEY ARE.
OGs here!
you should do program about Israel    "American made monster country" should be a good title
I got an 'entire list' of The Sick Of's!!..   I hate: "I'm Reaching-Out"..  "It Is What it is"..  "Ain't nothing, but a Thang"..  AND.. AT LEAST 1000 MORE!!
I find it shocking that reviews or feedback have that much impact given the number of Doordash orders that are simply never delivered.    That said, these workers need a union.
This is so awful John! Why are you trying to make a service we all love more expensive? Let it run as is for as long as possible. You should be looking for ways to reduce costs.  Btw, a system that incentivizes people to work more is generally good. Otherwise you end up with the same mess (stagnation) as Europe.
I was actually a bit let down by this episode. No one deserves to be underpaid for their work. However, services like DoorDash employ a tactic where they factor in tips to reduce the hourly wage. Although it's accurate that 100% of tips go directly to the delivery workers (which they advertise proudly and frequently), what isn't disclosed is the adjustment of mileage/hourly rates based on the tip amount to align with their perceived appropriate total compensation. This adjustment is made for each delivery trip, effectively allowing companies to use tips as leverage. By ignoring this detail, asking people to tip more inadvertently aids these corporations in exploiting both consumers and delivery personnel further. What needs to be done is more pressure on these companies to increase the minimum wage.
Rich people shitting on delivery drivers isn't new, unfortunately. I delivered pizza about 30 years ago and doctor's wives would write out checks w/o a penny of a tip.
This happened to us at Taproom 642 back before 2020. We never signed up for post-mates but drivers would show up. Then on other apps we'd get orders for items we no longer offered. And then the app were were on Uber would tell customers we're not taking orders so we just turned it off eventually, because after all the fee was our profit margin making it such that we completed the orders for free. The minute I realized that doing the books... Apps were shut the heck down. Not working for free or to earn Uber or Doordash a profit. Go visit the restaurant or realize those apps create a slave labor system. For the drivers and delivery persons do the math they don't pay you for your equipment the income does NOT cover the upkeep and maintenance. The apps get away with free equipment and no payroll expense. Delivery persons are NOT independent contractors of they were they would be able to charge their own rates and bill for the use of their vehicles.
in my mind. doordash small of that are just interns. just with extra steps
19:18. Oh you want a tip?!! Pay your workers a livable wage and health insurance! That’s what they really need, not an extra $5 from me!
I seriously doubt disabled people are using delivery apps unless they are independently wealthy.
01:22 What does this have to do with Ubuntu? I'm serious. This is not a joke.
Nope. Never used them. There's this thing called a kitchen here.
So pathetic to see people in the comments shrug and be like "who cares get a different job."  Some people have zero imagination. If companies can get away with treating workers like dirt while reaping in massive profits, zero government scrutiny, it *will* spread to other industries. Get psyched about tech bros coming to disrupt blue collar jobs, it's an inevitability. Have fun doing your HVAC installs for tips.
Also, a small fucked up fact: if you want to tip the delivery person, DO IT IN PERSON. Don't use the app's feature, because depending on the app, THEY MIGHT TAKE A CUT OUT OF THAT TOO.
Unionization
A few disagreements with this.   1. No one is forcing these workers to work these jobs. They could find non-gig work elsewhere. The U.S. has a very low unemployment rate.  2. Treating these workers like employees will likely make these companies go under, then the delivery folks won’t have a job at all.  3. Tip culture needs to be snuffed out
I agree with everything John said here. There were a few points glossed over...  1. If you accept a gig job, you can't be mad if it's not paying like a regular job.   2. Optional means optional. If a tip is optional, you can't be mad if you don't get one. There are places where gratuities are mandatory and automatic.   3. Restaurants have to jack up prices on the app to cover their fees. This was mentioned, but it beats repeating because these apps won't hesitate to remind you that the merchant sets the prices. While true, it's the platform that sets the inflation.
Lyft drivers rate customers. I rate each ride I take. I'm a five star, I tip well, I'm treated so respectful, in Shreveport LA & Las Vegas. Tipping works.
I worked at a Brazilian Steakhouse that had someone from Grubhub show up to deliver a rodizio. This was ridiculous! All the hand carved meats you can eat, and an endless buffet of sides. WTF are we going to send you 1,100 sides, and Eddie with 11 selections of meats to carve? They went from a good idea, to exploiting one of last true art forms
delivery drivers are HEROES making our friday night dreams come true! :D
So, I had started a Food Delivery Service before the rest, after graduating into the Great Recession in 2007, with student loans and no job offers. I did it with $3,000 to my name and no access to debt. Half the restaurants in my area went out of business in that recession but some of the restaurants I worked with told me I saved their business. I had co-graduates applying for delivery jobs, it was that type of economy. They made double minimum wage... more than I was earning. I charged less and didn't increase prices either. In the end, after 5 years running, living on takeout, I had some severe health problems. I had to get out early, and the industry changed after... but I can tell you that when a restaurant owner pays 60% to the delivery services it is because they decided to run a ton of marketing when first signing up and had cancelations or complaints. Advertising is always a long game and delivery apps are advertisers much like the Yellow Pages once were. I was literally competing with Yellow Pages in 2007 because most people still called in their takeout order over the phone. I don't know if I would have survived that market, I knew some really awful restaurant delivery owners in the industry. I'm glad I'm not still doing that.
I am glad that I have never, not once, have had any of these apps (Uber and Lyft included), and have never had anyone else order for me, nor will I ever. I take regular cabs and go out to pick up my food. I do not even order pizza delivery. Try it sometimes.
I stopped delivering after the "get a real job" people got loud enough.
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!!! When The Pandemic Hit, My First Thought Was, "HOW CAN I GET AS MANY PEOPLE TO TOUCH MY FUCKING FOOD AS POSSIBLE!!!
I work customer service for a restaurant group who “partner” with these apps and every day at some point I utter the phrase “How does this business model work FOR ANYONE?”
My friend started delivery driving during the pandemic.  He was shocked.   After gas, even with decent tips, he was making less than minimum wage.  How is this even legal?
Massachussessssssssss 😂
Wish he’d talked about Instacart. When doing Instacart I make less than with either grubhub or DoorDash, and the app and shopper support are awful
The only people laughing all the way to the bank are the tiny handful of people in the C suites of these companies bringing home 7 figures a year to run a company loses Wall Street and venture capital to exploit people.
Another issue with these companies are many of the Togo workers in the restaurants depend on tips too. Any tips for delivery services go only to the service not to the person who actually put your order together
Word.
Orphanage? Wtf? Also, the ratings system is horrible and is supposed to replace the oversight of working under a manager.
I will never use these services so long as I can drive to a grocery store.
I guess that the food delivery app services are helpful to some people, but I have never used one.
Thank you TWT for this. It’s all true, and customers have NO idea.
Thank you for spotlighting this. I’ve worked on the gig apps for almost 4 years. Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber eats, etc. They are an existential threat to traditional worker rights. The most abusive of which are GrubHub and Lyft.
I honestly expected him say that they tracked down the person who delivered the slice of cake for no tip and gave them a nice big tip for their hard work
Hi, restaurant owner here: One of the apps in my country is called Rappi, which takes around 45-55 percent cut off your orders, plus maybe an extra 20% if you sign up for a loan service, which is only paid through your orders, which is no biggie, no one is paying anything other than the work itself. Problem with the app is that they don't allow you to actually make your own menu, so for a while, we had a Taco Business that was allegedly selling radishes and beetroot for no reason.  Another app we use, DiDi Food, has the way of letting reviews to have an effect on the algorithm, with the biggest downside being that there's no standards on any reviews. Which sounds fine since it's just customer reviews, but when a valid criticism is that the "portion was small", and they order something that's literally called "Small Sized Order...", you begin to realize that you're essentially being punished by dumb customers.   And depending on the circumstances, you HAVE to use more than one app, because given the rise of this market, sometimes it really is a matter of seeing which one sticks. Before these two apps, i went with Uber Eats, which was the only one available in my city, but as time went on, DiDi Food became the main app for service, drying out UberEats, and after that, Rappi had a wave of success and eventually became the 2nd tier app.
I like to order from a local sushi place for my lunches sometimes and grubhub constantly says they're closed when they aren't. I just stopped using grubhub and call the place directly now.
The notion that even the companies arent making money is absolutely insane because it is NOT cheap to use these services. Its so much more expensive its almost comical. And yet we keep using it because theres just something so satisfying about the convince of it. I really dont think these companies could ever jack up their prices without substantial drops in order volume.
Don't do it. Do not order food on these apps. Just please don't
I once got 3 dollars for driving 20 minutes to deliver 2 bottles of water
I live in a major US city (Top Five)  where GrubHub closed their corporate office and never bothered to fix restaurant issues in the area before they closed up shop and left, so they were still sending us out to pick up orders even after the corporate closure. And these restaurants didn't even have the app agreement, they did not even have the tablet or the connection or means to even receive the order in the first place and the app sent us there anyway. Imagine going to an Italian place to pick up a big family meal for a customer and then you get there and you find out that the customer's order has never even been received, let alone cooked. And the staff looks at you like an alien 👾 when you walk in saying you're with GrubHub. And the staff is horrified and then they finally get the owner to come out and say "I have never signed up with GrubHub, I don't even have a GrubHub tablet. I don't know why you are here."  I worked for UberEars, DoorDash and GrubHub for three years and it was 100% pure nightmare. Every single day. I pay a ton in tips now if I ever order delivery because I know all the little hells that go into it.
I still don't use them. But I'm not a big fan of wasting money and am not a millionaire.
Exactly, charge your family every time you cook food. That's how I treat my family. Low hanging fruit missed.
I learned my lesson early. When I first tried out couple UberEat because of some promotions, my foods were suspiciously eaten before handed to me. I never ever tried any of delivery apps since. I rather be a little inconvenient and picking up the foods myself than to have a chance and a risk of contamination, by a third person's dirty hands.
Don't worry. Delivery drones will make sure there's no more exploited workers.
Are you telling me that every delivery app charged me a fuel surcharge to pay their legal fees to charge more?
Refuse to tip
The same way the ride share algorithm discriminate against drivers considering their behavior and reviews, tye algorithms that run social media discriminate on the basis of ideology and personality
I'm a doordasher and like 1/4th of the time they make me pour the drinks. I don't want random people with unwashed hands to get personal with my drink bro
$2 Door dash pay + 90% of you tipping < $3 = I lose money providing you a service. EATING OUT IS A LUXURY, ORDERING OUT FOR DELIVERY is certainly a LUXURY, HIGH END SERVICE. Cost goes to the consumer, except for delivery, right? Shame on all of you PETTY THIEVES. If you're ordering pay up!
the devil is just basically doing scales on 2 strings at once (it's harder to play on just one string) that could be taught to a beginner in one lesson. So no, the devil didn't come close to winning.
I used it 1 time at work 5 years ago, it was Okay but with the fees now, I'm not that lazy. I go get it myself.
John is right that the app business model effectively hollows out economies and livelihoods. They do provide a useful service for some people, but was life so unmanageable without being able to summon things on a phone? His suggestions treat a symptom, but essential just transfer money to venture investors and solidify business models that underpay for labor and services and fail to offer quality jobs or enough pay to live a decent life. Agree with his assessment of the problem, but can’t agree with his solutions. Make these companies treat their workers as employees as a start and if you value a restaurant, then give it your business directly.
ALL of John Oliver's comments and tips about delivery drivers also applies to shared drivers like UBER and LYFT alike. They share the same exact principles. I always tip and give them 5 stars unless the driver is a total s**t head.
I don't see anything wrong with ordering in bad weather as long as you compensate them by greatly increasing the tip.  I've done it my self a few times, and they were definitely not upset after I gave them a cash tip over the price of the order.  They aren't forced to accept the order they take the order of their own free will, probably assuming they will get a huge tip, if you fulfill that expectation then it is a fair deal.
U do not have to tip ! Nobody tips me at my job and I bust my ass also. So sorry, not that u don't deserve it just can't afford to give more. And many ppl can agree with this
Ohhhhhh **WE CAN ALL ENJOY HARRY POTTER**.   ❤ Forever.
The devils part is actually so easy anyone can do it
9:18. It's not just hygiene. Molten ice cream, crumbled cake, the business reputation is in the hands of someone who doesn't work for them.
No wonder these delivery people. Loose their minds and freak out over the tips size.
58 fucking percent .    NO. HE'LL NO.
I used DoorDash a lot until a ridiculous terrifying episode.  For context, I send instructions to every delivery person with detailed info on how to get to my apartment. It's a thing I copy/paste and is meant to be helpful.  One night, I saw the driver was getting close so I sent her the details.  Next thing I know she starts spam calling me and I don't know why and being an introvert, I got nervous/uncomfortable and didn't pick up. Next, next thing I know she's BANGING on my apartment screaming at me to come tf outside.  Apparently, she took my instructions to somehow mean that I thought she was stupid and then she followed that up by calling me racist - as if I even knew the color of her skin when I sent the instructions.  She screamed I "better open this f*cking door before I break it down, mother F*er". I said nothing and turned off the lights and she screamed "I SAW YOU JUST TURNED OFF YO LIGHTS, I KNOW YOU IN THERE LITTLE B*TCH! COME OUT AND FACE ME!" ... eventually maybe 3-5 mins later she decided to give up and said "You better mother f*cking accept this order as delivered successful and give me 5 mother fing stars or I'll be back with friends and it aint goin to end well"  Naturally, fearing for my life, I left 5 stars and accepted the delivery - then promptly threw it out.
Don't deliver a single slice of cake. If they can afford to tip. They would have just gotten a whole cake. If they can afford it they already have people for that.
I have NEVER used one.  Never will.
john oliver and jon stewart are saving political commentary
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard about a situation like that!
SO SICK OF THESE APPS THE DRIVERS THINK THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THEN NORMAL CUSTOMERS THINKING THEY SHOULD BE SERVED FIRST
This honestly seems like a pretty easy figure out here, but the solution is an impossible war. Basically, you subsidize delivery companies and drivers. Back them up with government money so that delivery people can have a life.  The caveat is you have to finally pass legislation to keep corporate fuckery away AND you need to come up with the money for those subsidies.  Now who do we know with a bunch of money literally sitting around doing fuck all but multiply like COVID?  Something something eat the rich, something something.   But here's my real point. Delivery service can be absolutely ESSENTIAL for some people. I was one of those people for a time. I lived in a small town, miles away from a store, and between failing health and a truck that was breaking down, getting groceries delivered was the ONLY way we would have survived. To make matters WORSE, we couldn't always tip either. Disability doesn't give you enough to live, let alone tip, and our groceries were already on food stamps.   We felt fucking AWFUL about that and the drivers hated it even more.    To me, this is another thing we've had stolen from us by corporate greed through tax evasion. We could do so much with more tax dollars, but it all gets flushed down the same bullshit drains again and again and AGAIN.   If we could refund all the trillions wasted on shit like unnecessary defense spending, tax havens in the Caymen Islands, and the infinite shell game shenanigans played at the top, we'd probably not only end homelessness, poverty, hunger, etc. But also still have money left for shit like delivery drivers, education, and, I dunno... a Tesla that doesn't trap you in a lake to slowly drown to death while you frantically call friends and family to save you as you gurgle your last breath. Also, Elon wouldn't be in charge and we'd probably all have detoxed from the slimey, tar slicked teat of Big Oil.   Speaking of horrific misappropriation of funds and resources, I'd love to see John calculate exactly how much money has been spent since 2000 to every dumb, bad and wrong measure, business and performance done. Like, all of it. GOP spending, military spending on Israel, how much Trump has payed for spankings, just all of it.   Every crooked dollar tallied up and then measured against predicted cost of programs that would actually make everyone's life better.   I'd bet you STILL have left over money for a new holiday or a monument to Henry Winklers ass or whatever stupid shit "Americans" enjoy.   Maybe the world's largest Waffle House designed in the style of a mega church? I dunno. Call your representatives and congressmen and tell them what you want the government to do with the extra money they waste on stupid bullshit today!  The Henry Winklers Ass Monument might be pretty good though. Make it interactive so it looks like he's really firing off a stream with different splatter effects, that way people can put their nemesis' faces in front of it for TikTok.
I used to deliver for Uber for a few years and there are a lot of misconceptions made by John. This work is a gig, I use to do it after work instead of playing video games, people working in it need to consider it as such. In Europe, if you get into an accident while delivering, they will step in and pay for you too.
Lorena Gonzalez knew what was coming and did nothing like every other California Democrat. I can guarantee she'll be campaigning for Kamala Harris in the future like nothing was wrong with her tenure as AG.
IM DISGUSTED BY THE "BOTTOM FRIENDLY MENU" SICK OF THE WOKE PRIDE GARBAGE BEING SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT
and he wasn't even using a landline
I know that this isn't perfecly legal, but if u have to make use of UBER-eat and u live in NYC, just take out 200 bucks or so out of ur bank account in small bills and keep it near ur door, if the delivery driver shows up, tip him/her CASH! It's the only way to make life for these guys easier.
Man ..watching this while doing doordash is a mind fuck
You know.... I want to care for the delivery drivers, but 3 outa 5 of my deliveries were ruined if not just stolen 😅
23:54 the way he says, "horse" xD
The sad part of all of this is that I saw it all coming with Uber and Lyft and no one believed me. I lived in San Diego when all these app services started out, and before they were in multiple states. So-called progressive California Dems did nothing about them, including Attorney General Kamala Harris who knew they were all operating without appropriate licenses. I even tried warning people in other states, and they all told me I was crazy too. Some of the same lefties who are whining about it now told me I was just ignorant because I was part of an old system, like I was just some kind of sad Luddite. Ten years later, every driver I know who jumped on board in the beginning has since gone back to driving a regular cab or moved to an entirely different job, and delivery apps have insane turnover rates. Also, AirBnB has destroyed whole neighborhoods and killed hotel jobs (many of which were unionized.)
I never do delivery and if I order pickup I use the official app if possible or order in person.  Fuck these food apps.
11:44 I've been told that Johnny's fiddle playing is more intricate than the devils and consists of variations popular fiddle solos at the time. I think the devil might've dabbled with fiddle playing but clearly he realized that there's probably a lot of stuff that goes past regular fiddling.
I will never use Uber eats, Grubb Hubb or Door Dash.
As someone who worked through the pandemic at a panda express I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE DELIVERY. They take priority over the drive through and main line of customers, causing everyone we deal with to be upset they're being ignored in favor of some ethereal being. You'd think the driver would be happy that we're trying not to waste their time but they showed up 10 minutes early and are angry that 5 plates and 10 bowls aren't done yet and now we have 5 angry delivery drivers and about 30 angry customers breathing down our neck. The worst part is people still line up regardless of how long the line already is or how upset they seem to be. I mean if I saw a line out the front door and a drive through going across the street I would go somewhere else NOT LINE UP INTO THE NEXT PARKING LOT. Craziest shit I've seen in my life, they're just asking to be upset because they chose to wait in a long line like "it'll get moving here in a seccond" no it won't we have more delivery orders our boss says has to be done first regardless of when they came in. So anyway I work a construction job now.
Episode on christian nationalism please! The single largest reason why this country has turned to shit and 40% of the population have become dumb as a box of rocks!
lol the bubble tea poke spot needs 15 guys on deliveries at all times, so how much non delivery guy staffing is there?  7 guys tops idk?? so the apps reduce his staffing costs by double hmm next guy 'embury fine spirits and libations' complains the apps take 58% someone else do the rest of the logic this commentary sucks, how much off the writing/whatever production staff on this show owns a part of some restaurant imagining writing for a show laf;hk
No way man. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you want a livable wage to do the work, tips become optional based on above average performance.
13:07 that audience laughter is the best thing i’ve ever heard
Maybe I missed it if you mentioned this other problem with delivery apps advertising for restaurants not under contract: pricing on these apps must be higher to cover the added expenses, potentially much higher than the restaurant actually charges. That means a bogus price list is online/in-app, deterring potential customers trying to decide not to overspend. Worse is that the restaurant will not get any of the tips—on a higher total price—and the driver likely doesn't effectively get much, if any, of the increase; for all too often, they get tipped very little to nothing for the delivery service, because customers are thoughtless. By the way, gas prices have gone way up over the last week, and the drivers eat that, unless and until they have excellent documentation and file taxes per Schedule C. I highly doubt these companies honor accurate actual gas costs, rather than some magic number they multiply by the distance calculated in the app, which doesn't account for traffic or actual route, nor actual price paid.
Have never used a food delivery app and never will, no one wins but the app company and even they lose, might as well be a pyramid scheme that has no winners. Oh and the drivers really get effed, I know I did uber for a while....... never frickin again!
How is this still a thing? Tipping in America
Tipping is not mandatory
I rarely comment on youtube videos, but this video is so important right now. This is such a complex issue with elements John didn't even touch on, that ultimately ends up just destroying the little guys. As a food service worker of nearly a decade, I have witnessed firsthand the way that the restaurant industry has been turned completely on its head by food delivery apps. It's not just because I'm from Chicago that I make reference to The Bear, but the episode wherein which they set themselves up for remote orders and get their shit Absolutely Rocked is all too real.   It's all but impossible at this point in the cycle to NOT be a part of delivery apps even if they do basically threaten to bust your kneecaps if you don't give them half of your revenue. For a lot of restaurants, that 50% revenue if 50% they wouldn't be getting because people simply can't or won't go to the stores themselves. I know this personally as someone who doesn't drive (because on top of not being able to afford a house, I can't afford a car either lmao); the last thing I want to do after being on my feet for 10 hours at a restaurant is to walk and stand inside of another restaurant to pick up my dinner! But regardless of how much the restaurant's need the service that these apps provide, as John mentioned, a lot of places aren't set up for delivery- and not just local businesses! I work for a nationwide chain and I have worked through multiple COMPLETE remodels of locations JUST so that they can be better suited for the culture shift into delivery dining. I'm talking entire portions of back and front of house layouts carved out in order to create a more intuitive setup for preparing and handing off delivery orders.   And just like in the episode of The Bear I referenced, even though restaurants no longer have to have delivery staff themselves to meet the market demands, the fact that someone can place an order without knowing twenty other people have placed an order at the same time or knowing that their delivery drivers are all fighting under the same time constraints, has DRASTICALLY changed the way restaurant staff are able to handle the process of preparing and serving food. And again it's just to make the same revenue we would've had five years ago, so we can't justify changing the staffing of the store we just have to change the expectations of what that staff has to do.   To reiterate, there are still things that John didn't touch on, which is that unlike the constant ads you probably get to sign up for these gig work platforms, it's not all part-time college-age white kids looking for extra cash! From what you may have picked up on from the interviews with delivery driver's themselves, all you need most times to work for these companies is a valid driver's license and insurance; which is to say the amount of gig work is done, especially in major cities, by immigrants. Which on top of perpetuating the exploitation of immigrant labor, it makes the rating system all the more insidious because when the majority of the clientele restaurant workers are communicating with don't speak English/Spanish or a language someone in the restaurant can speak, things tend to slip through the cracks! If a customer receives only half of their order because of a communication barrier with the driver, that most likely directly results in a bad review for the delivery driver, not to mention the refund although processed through the third-party app IS REFLECTED in the revenue the restaurant receives and reflects poorly on OUR service which means we may lose further business because we can't guarantee every delivery driver is on the same page as the restaurant staff (which we could do if they WERE our staff).   So tl;dr As both a consumer and provider of this service I say this: Customers deserve the food and service they pay for and food service/delivery workers deserve the profits they work for WITHIN THE CONFINES OF HUMANE LABOR.
I am grateful for "Last Week Tonight" for bringing this sad situation to the attention of the public.
I caught Dd taking money out of my bank account every month when I didn’t have a subscription. I called and they immediately sent a refund and she said it is a common occurrence. Frack them. These companies are scammers
My son used to instacart. He's high level Aspbergers with severe social anxiety. At first he was very happy making good money but then they bundled orders, believed customers when my son took pictures that showed the missing item IN THE BAG! Now he can make maybe $20 an hour. Minus gas and car repair it's not even minimum wage. And the app sucks and causes all sorts of issues, yet Instacart didn't care and never fixed it. I watched him get more and more frustrated, especially when tips got pulled or a client lied. One would think that a company that depends upon it's gig workers would treat them better!
He referenced it slightly at the end, but many restaurants have their own online ordering/delivery options that don’t cost them the insane fees that these apps will charge. It’s become more and more common and convenient, so look for it!
In 2020, my wife and I delivered for door dash and there were just some orders where we were like, "there is a 0% chance this person isn't high."   "Let's go to Albertsons and get 6 party size bags of Doritos, a gallon of salsa, 11 candy bars, and 25 boxes of hot dogs. It's 11 pm... This person is either high or throwing a last minute lat night party."
20:19 the sad thing is, you can replace "food delivery apps" with any of the other "successful app" that disrupted every other industry, be it Spotify, Netflix, AirBnB, Amazon etc. (would have added Tinder to the list but I genuinely have no clue about it) and that without even adding the social media apps or the more recent fast developing AI-tech to the list, with some making profit, some just investing in lobbying and some just investing it in even more mass destructive things. And the pattern will keep repeating itself until this either gets tightly regulated or destroys itself from within. but not before it ruins many other lives.
Whoever wrote that spaced out essay bit deserves a raise
"I'm like Ms. Piggy the way I'm hittin' that green" 💚 💚 💚
As a millennial in a Western country I have never, in my entire life, used one of those apps. I have many friends and flatmates that do, but the way I was brought up has me intensely averse to other catering to my needs. If I want food and not make it at home I go out and get it myself.
During pandemic, just of course got out of restaurant dependence.  In retrospect- SO don't miss overcrowding, indifferent wait staff w overly salted GMO badly cooked sugarFat. Food at home is drama free & eons healthier
Its kinda funny to watch them say the "Company itself is loosing money" when, while that's true, the company's CEO/Owner is making BUTTLOADS of money. They're paid BY the company. One of those "Yeah, technically that's true, but not really" kind of situations. But it sure makes us feel like we're getting a steal of a deal, right? That's just good advertising is what that is.
I'm sorry, but don't accept the order if there is no tip.
The section about reviews of products vs reviews of workers' efforts is EXACTLY why the waitstaff tipping industry in the US is BS.  As a waitress for many years while going to college, my work ethic and effort could be faultless; but because of a shortage of cooks, bussers, food availability and understaffing of waitstaff meant that we were paid less than minimum wage (it's a long math/tax/tip reporting equation) and  being tipped pennies or not getting tipped at all for something that was not our fault, even in so called high end restaurants.  All the while being treated like trash, insulted, grabbed, smacked, and even spit at.  A congressman grabbed my ass one time. This was within the last few years.  Not exaggerating one bit.
Pittsburgh mentioned 😂
Oliver’s case against the impending delivery app monopoly, which is sound, does not ultimately make sense without taking demographics into account. You cannot understand the apps’ reckless policies if you ignore the fact that the majority of their labor force comes from undocumented migrants, who are already at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping workers’ rights for legal reasons.
I'm sympathetic to workers, and always provide a roughly 20% tip, and in any case I make virtually no use of these apps, but I still didn't entirely agree with this piece. Mostly the onus being put on the consumer, which seemed a bit misplaced. What is with the claim around 21:40 that we're paying less than the service is worth? By what metric? There's a sizable surcharge on these orders. Much worse than it was back in the early 2000s, where I did order delivery directly from restaurants and you could get that service surprisingly affordably. This claim is glossed over and seems really crazy to me.
Delivey apps never have accurate menus.
I no longer order delivery food It used to be the same price as indoor dining Now it cost a lot more And you have to wait so much longer than you used to and you get the food and it's not fresh.
No one cares.
Hey, the rating system applies to restaurants too. When I worked at Taco Bell we only got our employee discount for lunch during our shift if our restaurant met its survey numbers. Where they get you is customers are offered 5 choices in multiple categories. These are not graded like homework, they are pass/fail. If everything isn’t the highest rating it’s a 0 and the person putting themselves through college doesn’t get lunch today.
This is all free market capitalism, people.  No one is being forced to do business with these companies at all.
Any word from Clarence Thomas⁉️
The CA prop 22 ads were spun insanely hard to trick people into voting yes, and you could not avoid seeing them all over the place. The delivery companies tried to convince you that voting yes was better for workers similar to the way that Amazon rejects unions from getting in the way of the direct employer-employee compensation relationship.
I carried my childhood home by myself for five months, making $100-$150 a night on Doordash. Because of one bad review, I was suddenly not receiving enough jobs and making only $50 a night. I eventually had to move out and the house went up for sale. Someone else is living there now and I may never get to return to it again.
The only part of food delivery in my life is waiting for them to get out of the way in the parking lot entry at work. I will never pay 10 dollars for a mcdouble
you're right, the devil was better, lol
Surprised there wasn’t a single mention of the fact that over 65% of gig economy workers in the US are newly-arrived migrants.   This is a huge factor in understanding the apps’ indifference towards their workers. They know that at the end of the day, no matter how bad it might get, they’ll always have an unlimited supply of compromised, desperate labor.   Then again, demographical arguments against neoliberalism don’t always bode well with Oliver’s audience.
I really like the rant about the devil 😂
The "best and brightest" on Wall Street have billions behind these bad ideas....ur, 'businesses'.
Customer and driver support is probably the worst aspect of the entire industry. It’s absolutely terrible and filled with broken AI instead of real people, even when real people support is needed.
Yeah, no. I will not tip for delivery drivers. Tip is for when a person excels their job. The server was friendly and accomodating and the food was good? I tip. If the drink delivery guy carries 10 boxes f water into the second floor for me? I tip. I will not tip because the algorhytm and the pay is crap in that job. Following that logic we ought to start tipping at Walmart?   I know, that they rely on the tip for their livelyhood. That would be the perfect time to change the job.   BTW after Corona there was a big shift in Delivery Apps in my country: they started to add fees. Usually 3 Bucks delivery fee, 50 cents of service fee... they are compensating and paying that to the drivers as well as the restaurants. And you can see it on your bill before you order. Sure, you can still order a piece of cake (although most restaurants have a minimum order amount of 15 bucks nowaday). You still pay the 3 Bucks to the driver.
2:16 he’s just like me fr
The gigg economie is run by vampires
My good friend Pablo was hit by a car and died, while delivering for Caviar. They didn't send a rep to the press conference, didn't offer any help for the funeral and his family had to hire an lawyer just get his final payment, that was less than $100. These apps not only don't care about their workers, they don't even see them as people.
My nuggets were cold
It costs $9 for someone to deliver me food from 1/4 mile away, if you can't figure out how to make money on that you should go under.  That's the main reason I don't use those services often.  It's financially irresponsible to pay 70% extra for your food because you don't want to drive your car for 40 seconds there and 40 seconds back.
Where possible I order directly from the restaurant's website, but I do give in and use an app sometimes.   It's rare that I remember or give myself time to bring food when I go to work, so I end up either picking something up or ordering while I work, wayyyyyyy too often. Remembering to bring food would save me a ton tbh, and even just picking it up instead of doing delivery would save a lot.   Because when I do delivery, it's on average $12-15 for the food itself. And the cost for delivery, either from the restaurant or from an app, usually doubles it to $24-30. And at that point I'm paying about 2 hours of my time just for one meal, two if I eat less than I'm able. Which is ridiculous lol, but I also only have half an hour for lunch, so. Options for pick up are limited and take away my break.   But it's crazy to think that even paying double for my food, plus taking a huge cut from the restaurant, they still can't make profit? I call bullshit lol, because the CEOs make millions/are worth billions and they can spend hundreds of millions just to avoid giving their employees benefits.
...a bunch of sad, whiney, broke bitches in this comments section. Fuck the delivery drivers...they made choices in life that led to the jobs they have. Can people please learn about personal accountability?
The few times I've tried these things when I was in the states every time it was to far away. Apparently, 7miles each way is to far away. Easier, to drive or take public transit saves on delivery fee .
Can we talk about the one person who screamed out, "WHAT?" Besides that, I have actually never used delivery apps, I can say I have increased the amount of online ordering I have done.
Because of where I live I never use these services. Also, because I am retired I just cook from scratch for my wife and myself. For 40 years I was.never home for more than one meal a day except for vacations.
I used to drive for Uber and tried doing Uber eats one time. I was sent to a McDonalds 15 minutes from where I was and had to wait 30 more minutes because the food wasn't ready. I then drove to a guy that was within walking distance of the restaurant delivered the food and got no tip. I was on their clock for 45 minutes and and made $3.10. Uber didn't pay me for getting to the restaurant or for having to wait 30 minutes despite McDonalds telling them that the food was late. I complained. Uber said sorry, but we aren't going to do anything about it. I never did Uber Eats again and I don't use the food delivery apps as a result. Uber as a replacement taxi was fine only as a side hustle. I could go out when I had nothing to do and make $100 after a tank of gas working. Even using it part time, I the wear and tear on my car cut heavily into my profits and it was rare for anyone to tip, so I ultimately decided it wasn't worth it.
Uber drivers and food delivery folks get those jobs by getting a drivers license… they choose to work there.  They don’t have to work there.  Don’t like it?  Go work somewhere else.
The apps aren't profitable because their executives make 8 figure salaries each year, and they spend the rest of lobbying.
Don't promote tips.  End tips in America and pay a living wage.
Damnit, saw this while waiting for my food
So this is close to my heart since I'm a consumer. I doubt that John will ever see this post but food delivery is the bottom rung of this issue. The higher rungs are:  1. For cab drivers, this varies by city. However in big cities this gets a bit crazy. The classic example is NYC where you need medallions to drive a yellow cab in Manhattan. Before Uber/Lyft e.g. these went for 1M+. Most are owned by large companies since the only way it's worth that much is if the cab is going 24/7. So what happens is that the medallions are rented out in shifts to drivers for a fixed cost (e.g. 600/wk for an 8 hr shift per day). All the risk is on the driver. There's an HBS case about this wherein a medallion as an ETF would fetch ~80k per year  for the owner and ~20k per year for drivers. It basically traded as an 8% bond for traders. Ride sharing initially offered  shared risk models where it was~75-25 rev split between the driver and platform. That was great because it helped drivers, helped consumers and the value of the medallions fell by almost 50%.  2. That split has shifted. Uber has flipped it from what drivers tell me to 30-70. It's messed up. The drivers still get the full tip but I do the mental math of the cost of my ride and sometimes the cost of depreciation to the vehicle, gas etc also is less than the cost of the ride without even including the cost of the time to the driver  These issues need to be addressed. I know JO doesn't beat down on left leaning issues but things like medallions are examples of economic rent seeking for parasites and this rev split is the other side. Make the drivers whole in both ways. Pressure the ride sharing companies (food delivery is the smaller portion) but kill this government rent seeking. Sheer graft costing the consumer and the driver.
Must to my shock Al really is short for Alphonse
yooooo id been wondering for SO LONG why stores i knew for a fact were open were listed as closed or just missing from the app.  i knew it was something on the apps side.. just had no idea it was so *_shady_*  this episode has been a long time comin!! great work LWT~
Interestingly, in the countryside in germany, where i live, none of these apps have any Corporations with local Restaurants, so they are utterly useless. Therefore everyone here orderes he old school way via Phone call xD
I don’t know why that hack is being recommended to me?
one thing he did not mention that us deliveries ask to tip the driver at the time of the order placement, which is crazy. i've lived in numerous countries and nowhere i've seen this model. talking about incentives. also the items prices are usually a bit higher on the app, so gas, car maintenance, and time spent driving included, it usually still cheaper to go get it yourself. nowhere else ive seen delivery being that wacky as in the usa.
It’s time we leave capitalism behind
Unimportant question - Why do people react with hoots and applause every time someone says they're high? Is that the goal of life now?
"Uber eats does not make money" = Hollywood Accounting techniques 100%. They say that while receiving massive salaries.
Masterfully delivered as always. But isn't it Always more fun to listen to the Devil?
I use insta cart and door dash for groceries in a smaller market. Prior to the pandemic, the deliveries were provided by company employees in refrigerated trucks. It's way worse now and I DONT TIP.
16:50 The audience claps and laughs, but I'll bet you more than half not only do that, but DON'T EVEN TIP the exhausted, soaked-to-the-bone bicyclist that brought the pad thai to their door.
I've always felt the Devil played much better though still shitty because it's at it's heart a very shitty song.
I've never understood why they don't give delivery drivers multiple orders to pick up and disseminate at the same time (and maybe a thermos box or a heating box and cooling box) to keep the food. It would massively increase efficiency and in several cases reduce wait times (you're eliminating a trip back to the restaurant)
Dang I really thought someone was going to hand John a slice of cake at the end!!😂😅
Reckless driving to meet delivery times sounds like Domino's Pizza 30 minute guarantee and why Dominos got rid of thst
7:00 - So let me get this straight, this restaurant owner knew what the fees would be and agreed to the contract anyway, then complains that they charged him what they said they would be charging him and that he agreed to? Perhaps he's just a stupid businessman!
The idea that these companies aren't making a profit is such an absolute joke. They have been around for years now. If they weren't making profit they wouldn't be around anymore. I don't know financial wizardry like some people do, but what I do know is that doesn't add up at all.
It’s hard to say the companies don’t make any money when they spend $184 million on litigation against paying their employees.
Of fucking course they aren't getting tiped.  The restaurant charges 3-4 times what I would spend to cook it myself and then after that you expect me to pay 2-3 times what I would pay at the restaurant. Of fucking course I only throw a dollar or two at them. I pay $10 to restraunt delivery drivers. Uber and shit is eating our money.  Don't use delivery apps.
Call your representatives now and DEMAND universal healthcare.
I wonder why this got taken down and put back up after a few days
Delivery driving for restaurants is basically the same in my experience. They'll hire you part time so they don't have to provide benefits, you're reliant on tips,  and you have to still cover gas, repairs, ect. Also, during crappy weather you can't just not work, your boss forces you to go out
Don't be lazy and go pick up your own damn food.
so basically theyre the gypsy cabs of food.
I would also like to see a follow up episode where you show how many delivery people are plain bad at what they do or try to take advantage of people, like taking the food away unless they get a tip of their choice, or mishandle food and so on. So the first oxymoron here is that you give a tip BEFORE you receive a service, while it should be after; and the second is that if you give 5 stars to everyone, you will keep having those people behaving badly around doing deliveries, instead of giving the job to people that genuinely do a good job.
"You have to tip" that's messed up.  I would rather rally for gig worker minimum wages. It's a problem that the government should solve, we pay taxes for governments to solve problems of its citizens. If delivery apps charged more as a result of minimum wage, we would get off our ass and get our own food.   If we keep tipping, were encouraging the exploitative behaviour of the food delivery apps.
So much better when you turn on the Theater mode of your AMD graphics card in Catalyst Control Center.
Jim Cramer truly loves when corporations do whatever they want.
Restaurants getting screwed, workers getting screwed ... but these grifting middle-men companies aren't making a profit (as the dumb hacks who defend them like to point out) ... How stupid can you be to believe that b.s.?   They aren't making a profit?  How much are the CEOs (and investors/shareholders) making?  Every inch of profit hey can squeeze out of it?  There are the profits, being sucked up by the lazy millionaires and billionaires ... while also making money by claiming that their business isn't making a profit on their taxes ... privatize profits and socialize losses -- win-win.
I'm not going to tip if the service isn't good. I'm disabled and my app says ring the doorbell or knock loudly, so I know the food is at my door. The majority of the time, I don't know if my food is even at my house. It's left at the end of my driveway moat of the time and my neighbors or roommates coming home let me know I have food which has been sitting out in the Texas heat for who knows how long.
It's time for us to make these companies obsolete by choosing not to use them anymore. Also, these services (and Uber and Lyft as well) are also known to not do jack when women complain about potentially threatening or dangerous interactions with delivery guys
Or...just don't use those apps any more. There's no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism, so stop using the apps that foster these kinds of harmful results and instead work toward building a better infrastructure that may make tomorrow a better place to be than this corpo-driven orgy of avarice that continue to perpetuate soulless cruelty towards those we would call "essential".
the suggested tip on doordash is 30%! Outrageous!
You clearly watched Theo von and Tim Dillon podcast and their doordash rant 😂😂
I disagree on 2 points; The first is that drivers are not protected, simply because it is a job like every other job. You can be hired as handyman and be in the same situation, or can be working for a company as individual contributor and have no union protection and be fired at any time (and have to pay for your own insurance, gas, car and so on). This apply to almost every job that does not have a union.... The only difference is that other jobs may pay more so that offset the discomfort. Also being a manual labor job that require limited specialization, it is subject to low pay and negatives sadly... I have been working in retail and underpaid for a while, until I got my degree, so I went through the process and experienced it first hand.  Many people though prefer to do this job instead of construction or other heavy duty jobs, because it is to an extent more approachable.  The second point I do not agree is that consumers are the only ones to benefit, which is not true in my view. I pay more when ordering online, and I don't pay for the food and the service to get it at my doorstep, but also to put money in the pockets of the investors of these companies, and for that we are all charged: customers, delivery people and restaurants. So the only ones making profit here are the investors and who owns stocks of these companies... Otherwise they would not exist, believe me, as unless you can take a loss every year selling products, no sane company would keep operating if someone was not making profit.
Nah, I don't tip because I want the company to increase their wages and treat them like employees.
Came here for the satire, stayed for the spot on musical critique.
I've been saying Johnny shouldn't have won for so long! 13:50 I feel like not enough of the audience appreciated Innovative Profitable Orphanages = IPO
Also in our Day that was simply providing a very needed service given to the people similar to putting a card on the grocery store wall providing their own time fuel costs to either drive someone, usually a complete stranger or picking up their groceries, again providing their own personal time to actually do a person's shopping for them.  Not really much different than a pet sitting business.
Please do a show on commercial pet food
Doordash and uber will pay you 2.25 per order. No matter the distance, thats doordashs pay. Everything else is required on tips. Your 3.15 order for a cup of coffee you paid 20% tip for means i drive 5 miles, the duration is 30 minutes for delivery. Unless i made 15$ on my next order, that takes less than 30 minutes to deliver, i made 3.15 that hour. Aside from the cost of gas and car maintenance.
John is essentially trying to guilt customers into enabling these companies by offsetting their exploitation with tips.  This mentality just has to go.  If you really want to fix the system, change it, not keep doing the same f'ing thing.  Do one of your episodes where you pay off all the gig workers with your hbo money and quit trying to make me feel guilty for something I don't agree with.  I get it was "humor", but to 5-star someone who delivered food with "semen" is that enabling mindset that keeps doing the same f'ing thing.  Just stop.  Either come up with a real solution or stfu
Before the apps one of my real estate clients for extra money, even though he was already a well paid luxury helicopter technician, used to drive into Philly to deliver pizzas because they were super good tippers.  Not sure if they All understood what pizza delivery people used to be paid for providing their delivery though they were also paying for their own gas wear and tear on their vehicles, etc   So when he got stiffed on the tip he'd just take something from their yards and unfortunately even back in our Day that seemed to be an awful lot of people who were stiffing him because he had an extraordinary number of lawn ornaments.
Let’s talk about the delivery services in including the service fees and delivery fees in the price they tax.
I would argue that the customer is also losing. The price premium for an order is insane, any restaurant that used to have their own delivery was much cheaper.  And the onus of improving gig workers wages by tipping more is mis-targeted.   Tips should not be a subsidy for livable wages, employers or “contractors” should be paying them enough to make every delivery worth their time, period. Otherwise they have no business running the company.  The fact that they can fail at every conceivable level and still monopolize the market is a damning condemnation of the state of capitalism in the modern world.
Very strange for an investigative show that tackles issues to promote tipping even though that got completely out of hand and is essentially just a way for companies to pay their employees less and save on taxes etc. I think saying please don't tip so that these employees get a living wage in the long run would have been the far better option.
Sometimes the delivery drivers suck. In the hood they steal your food and never deliver it😬🥴😖
Poking the algo. 🎉 Great stuff and needed journalism... plus the laughs. 😊
I'm a delivery driver. You are right about our driving habits and today I promise I will stop doing that. Thank goodness I live on Maui, delivery with ocean and mountains;-) Aloha and Mahalo John Oliver!
Welcome to capitalistic USA.
Oh ok so the solution is tipping more instead of armed resistance to feuadlism, thanks for your insite
Drivers stole way too much money for me. I dont buy from any of the mfs and i used those apps a total of 15 times max and they stolen from me 4 or 5 of those times.
I still haven't used a delivery app. Not starting anytime soon
But the prices are just not even cheap
I pick up my own order because of this
I think, as a community, we have to be willing to not always get greater and greater convenience. Because it's a double-edged sword. We're creating low paying jobs and harder work conditions that WE have to fill when we want more convenience. Of course... the housing, medical and government institutions are still the massive villains in our lives, but there are some steps we can do to control where the world is rolling.
The bottom line is that people care far too much about federal issues and world issues and completely ignore what's going on outside your own door. It's why they don't care about Carl more than a passing by sigh, until he finds his way to LWT's special. It's why people are blind to local elections and complain about taxes at the federal level, but it's your damn state and local taxes that are the problem. It's also why when people sue the local government because their police department is terrible and corrupt, no one knows and votes the mayor out. They just eat the cost, offer some fucking Amazon-style company a 30-year tax abatement, and end up trying to attract local farm children to the big city to milk their income. If people fucking watched the area around them as much as they care about what happens in places they don't live near, we might actually be able to do something to help those places! You can't help others until you've helped yourself. You don't save a person bleeding out until you aren't bleeding out yourself.  People need to turn off the electronics and get back to talking to each other again; face to face, meetings (I know it could've been a memo, blah blah blah), reunions, etc. I know a lot of those are things people don't want, but it's because we've already turned the corner and have allowed all this shit we type on to control us and it's only getting worse.  The end of humanity will not be with a boom. It will come from a whimper as people isolate, births are gone, and the remaining green areas of the planet will be fought over. No one will know, no one will care. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg will be in their billionaire bitch bungalows in Hawaii and Sam is making the hundredth avacado toast and has had enough and their money and power means absolutely nothing now. But, Elon knows this from his Neuralink implant and pushes a button to detonate poor Sam's slave collar. He then leans over to his concubine of the night and orders her to grab a baby from the factory below to eventually replace Sam. Jabba the Hutt may be more moral.
Get a real job. Doordash is for potheads and people who dont want a job.
John oliver is a whiny coward. Scared to tell the truth bc his groupies punk him.
That’s a REAL FRICKING AD for Postmates??? Never used them and now never will! I mean come on, have some taste and standards!!!!
I do food delivery and Prop 22 is a GOOD thing. New york giving hourly wage has shut out many people from delivering at anytime they want. You have to hope there is a slot open for you, or you sit at home making $0/hr.  Also prop 22 really increased pay.  So is it better lay off 80% of the work force so 20% can get hourly pay with benefits? What will the other 80% do for jobs? Most of these people doing this already have difficulty finding other jobs.   And yes, please do tip people. sometimes we get forced to take a junk order cause its stacked, we lose money making those deliveries.
Gig economy is SECOND UNDERPAID JOBS. I rarely use them. If I must .... cash tip in person.
Excellent videooooo excellentttt excellenttttttt
Honest question, if gig work is so bad, shouldn't less people do it, thereby making the remaining gig workers more profitable? That's kind of the basics of economics and capitalism. If there are better options, people would do those instead. I even do a bit for fun, it's not a job for me, it's just some extra money that anyone can do because there's no skill barriers to entry. For such work, it'd kind of be amazing if it paid anymore than the bare minimum. If it did pay any more than bare minimum, feels like the basics of capitalism is being thrown out the window. Teachers are already paid pretty slim, you cannot possibly tell me a gig worker for uber should earn even close to a salary of a teacher.  The practices used against businesses on the other hand do deserve callout because that's more like malpractice.
great show are you running for some kind of leadership in the role of humans because you got my vote  !!!!!!!!
I swear people would pay for chewing-as-a-service if that existed. Who the hell depends on these apps on a regular basis? Plan, shop and cook at home, people, that’s called being a normal, functional adult. If you really want to eat out, then get up and go to a restaurant. What a zombie-ridden service-addicted dystopia the world is tuning into.
Skype is Microsoft Teams now. Another one of those acquisitions, take all the good bits of the company/software and then dump the name. Could be a whole main story for an episode.

Why should a business pay per-transaction to have a delivery app send somebody, when the restaurant could do it on their own? Charging per-item is bad for other businesses, and is predatory for anybody involved. Delivery apps should only charge restaurants per month for access to the services, and then charge the customer per transaction.
As somebody who tried to drive for doordash, my region is so saturated that I had to try to schedule myself weeks in advance if I want to make any money, otherwise the only option was midnight to 1 am. And after gas, I make far less than minimum wage in my state.
Important to note that when DoorDash first made Panera available it was a forced system where they exploited the pickup system. This resulted in many many duplicate, non-received, and incorrect orders. The person working the front counter then had to answer numerous phone calls from customers regarding issues. One time we had 4 duplicate orders come in with 7 drivers. After a multitude of attempts to lock them out, Panera partnered with them and the next few months saw a steady change in pricing and issues.
When 21:30 happened my heart sank like a stone.  This is going to work because the customers are the only winners, and as long as a massive customer base keeps getting value from a service, it will survive long enough for the Disruption Process to complete.
how do old people find this funny
Yet another consequence of the asinine lockdowns
While restaurants are complaining, and trust me I am NOT pro "slave entrepreneur" that is the contract workers' state, but they have offset the cost of delivery and in many cases added delivery (I mean, if you want to pay $40 for McDonalds, that's on you, but historically, you needed to slide your buns into the driver seat to get that dried out 400 steer burger).   So the barking on the side of the restaurants isn't that loud, they get food sold, don't have to pay anyone or buy delivery infrastructure.  Bottom line, people don't want to pay for employees. It is sick and it sucks.
Wow fuck these food apps.
So many of the "tech will make your life wonderful" promises have been found dehumanizing. And have ya heard what they're promising for AI?
Why should drivers receive tips when other workers doing jobs for same base pay don't? Then are we moving to normalize tipping on all services? Pretty sure it's getting there and people are hella pissed.
SOLUTION: Restaurants in an area can hire an on call delivery drivers, themselves. Don't accept delivery apps!
I generally prefer to order for takeout and pick it up.
Tipping is immoral and should be banned.
M street shakes are amazing and yeah they got shafted hard
Yeah but they are lying,a minimum of 30 % without having to do anything or spend  anything  as an x  restaurant busness owner 30 % is decent profit
hahah "starting an orphanage". The half a second before everyone burst into laughter was the longest WTF moment for me. So great.
The California situation doesn’t share the whole truth. The law AB 5 that was rolled out was way far reaching and impacted all gig workers in unrelated industries - such as freelance artists, musicians, craftspeople etc. The senator who wrote the law who is featured took Union money to craft the law, and cited Uber and Lyft as her targets but carved out exceptions for these very companies and still passed the law impacting all other genuine gig workers. Unfortunately it was not written well, and wasn’t honest as it didn’t actually prioritize fixing the problems with app based contractors who are really misclassified and should be treated as employees - but rather crippled the entire gig working industry where many artists saw their contracting projects disappear overnight - as people just hired others from outside California to avoid violating AB 5. It also put pressure on small non profits and small businesses to now pay contractors as employees - for instance non profits that put on small indie concerts yay to pay out even a small amount like $50 would now have to set up payroll to pay these folks as employees. This was very frustrating because at the end of the day - the apps were the first to carve exceptions for themselves, and rather than go after that, this senator doubled down on everyone else.
I am in the percentile who has never used them.
its the usual market cornering: a few companies buy everything up (angel investment money) at a loss, a short period of consumer happiness ensues, then prices get jacked up and there is no competition.  now, in theory this is illegal, but in my life i haven't seen gov take action once.  P.S. btw, i'm against tipping. tipping has become a way to reduce wages below covering costs of the job. DONT TIP. stop now.
"Can't spell millennials without 3 massive Ls" 😂
Welp today I  placed an order. Driver dropped my food off at the completely wrong house on another side of town. Texted me a pic. Not my house.
I hate that tipping is presented as the solution. It's part of the problem.
What does he say 16:03-16:08? oops closed captions caught it.
dude this isnt fair i just smoked a bowl and ordered dunkin donuts
They done redid the whole episode .. did someone get sued
1:00 Is that a redraw by LastWeekTonight or what unholy uncanny valley did VeggieTales get shoved into.  Why do the characters all look so weird?
Trying to wring profit for drivers, food apps, and restaurants out of one meal is IDIOTIC.  Capitalism needs to be on psych meds.
MUST there be canned laughter? Especially the kind that doesn't fit the context?
Okay, don't order it then. Nobody is making you. It is LITERALLY just a convenience.
I hate these apps and will never use them again. After paying twice as much for food just to have it arrive cold and an hour late and countless stories of the same or worse happening to so many others, I don't understand how anyone could continue to give them any money
I ain’t trippin shet. The system is broke doesn’t mean I have to be.
The 58% number includes the promotions the restaurant chose to add. E.g. BOGO type discounts. Without those (which are opted into by the restaurants), and taxes, it's closer to 30% that grubhub is taking, 10% of which is goin to the driver
Skype? Meet teams, same thing, plus more misery
Hey guys, of all youre capable of doing is delivering food YOU DONT DESERVE A LOT OF MONEY.
Always Always tip… in cash
Q'doba allows you to order from their website, that has lower pricing than ANY of the Delivery Apps, but ONE Delivery app driver will pick-up and deliver your food.  Q'Doba gets charged MORE when a customer orders directly from Q'doba's own website, than if the customer had ordered from the delivery app.  The Customer pays MORE through the delivery app with inflated pricing, delivery fees and service fees that are shown on the app. But when a customer wants to save a few bucks and not get hit with the added on fees, the restaurant pays the price!  The restaurant STILL has to pay the service fee and delevery fee, not to mention the delvery app's own cut of the actual price of the food itself!  The delivery apps are driving businesses to the GROUND!!
But tipping unfortunately is a double edged sword. Obviously the delivery guy needs it so they can earn money, but at the same time companies see it as a way to pay the delivery guy lower wages because “earning tips balances out the wage”.
I am so glad that I have never used these apps and during the plandemic  we went to restraunts offering 'carry out' where we'd have a picnic in the parking lot with groups of friends.
Yooo!😂 i legit laughed at the "orphanage" line
I've never had takeout in my life. American hyper dependence on restaurants and delivery services are weird, though it's definitely coming over here, this maximum-comformt need at all times culture.
They only time I order on these apps now is when we have guests and no food
Trying to sell us a discount in an artificially overinflated market isn't a win..
If you can go get your food, just go and get it.  Less people handling the better!  If your physically unable to get it, ask a friend or family to get it for you and buy them something.  Still way less then these horrible gauging apps.  These services when used by people that dont "need" to is just contributing to a bigger problem of our current times..
I work for a restaurant and we turn grub hub off when were busy cuz they're a huge pain in the ass
The irony of the entire thing is that these delivery services are not profitable, but for **no good reason**. I'm fairly certain you can host an app/website for millions of people as a solo developer/very small team, with running costs of *maybe* a few thousands of dollars. I honestly don't know if it is greed, corporate overhead, or incompetent planning on the programmers they did hire. Maybe the "small teams" don't have the marketing and don't make a difference. But it's a sad state of affairs.
Wait, they aren't profitable? https://youtu.be/aFsfJYWpqII?t=1407 come the fuck on, we need to stop allowing them to make these claims while lobbying that much, and if they lobby that much, you know the executive pay is going to be half the companies expenses
We need to get rid of ‘side hustle’ culture, these are means of survival not odd jobs for extra pocket money.
Skype was doing great until it was bought by Microsoft in an effort to bury so that people would use Teams more. Except they shot both apps in the foot by being too slow to develop either and losing it all to Zoom.
Abolish the tipping culture, leaving service providers’ earnings on the behest of consumer’s mood is ridiculous. The rest of the world works just fine, users know what they’re going to get charged and drivers know how much they’ll get paid, no surprises.   While you’re at it, get rid of the stupid Imperial system, bring Metric system in the US. Another stupid thing here that makes no sense. ✌️
I severed my dependence on Grubhub - because of the absolutely ridiculous expense ... and the tales of horror working in that milieu from a friend. Your 'spotlight' is most welcome. 👏
That John Oliver crew just keeps making banger videos.
I did delivery driving for a bit when I was between jobs. It was only for about three or four months. I almost died at least twice. There were some nights I thought to myself "This is a hell of a lot to go through for $50."
Eph tips
I don't use these apps. I plan to not download these apps for as long as possible. No shade anyone who does use them. But let us use exploitative systems as little as we can.
Wow.  So, the consumer pays $40 for a $20 order, the restaurant get $10, the delivery guy gets a couple of bucks, and the app loses money.  This is stupid.  Also, someone is lying.  There's at least $25 unaccounted for in that mess and it's not just evaporating.
I hate America's tipping culture
Fuck yeah! My man Joshua getting the shoutout XD
I worked a few years for DoorDash and Postmates but then I graduated to the big money which is delivering catering orders to hospitals and huge corporations during lunch time hours. I can make in 2 hours doing catering what I used to make in the entire day doing small piddling single orders from Taco Bell
Jon, you left out that they also give a bad image to restaurants by jacking up the price.  I've heard stories of people saying, "We don't go to xxxx anymore because their prices are so high", but it's just because Grubhub inflated the prices and caused harm to their brand reputation.
What is weird, and I haven't seen discussed, is how this is basically backwards from how things used to be.  Grubhub would have been a software platform if they started in the 80s or 90s, a delivery management app.  They would have then migrated to a hosted app, then a cloud app, and then a cloud service, taking bigger cuts each time.  Instead, Grubhub came at this from the end game angle where you take everything but the restaurant, the riskiest part, and consume all the possible wealth for the food once prepared.  They could and should easily be just a platform that makes tiny cuts out of millions of transactions to make money, but instead they are strong arming everyone.
I was in college from 1981 to 1985 before we had of course smartphones or video games or any of that sort of thing if you were hungry you just went hungry. Of course even stores usually closed at 8:00 p.m. and were closed on Sundays
The real solution is delivery bots. They never speed, never contaminate your food, nbd if they crash or get robbed, they don't need $15/hour, and they only weigh 1/10th the weight of a car. While the public is becoming less optimistic about self driving cars that are making very slow progress, delivery bots are quietly but rapidly taking over the unused suburban sidewalks around the country with great success.
I have despised these apps from day 1. Real sad people used them enough for them to stay around.
Just floating the idea here:  Can we please have a John Oliver × Trevor Noah × Hasan Minhaj collaboration?  Not just tiny appearances, but like a two hour exclusive conversation or something - about anything and everything.  🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽 Wouldn't be surprised if this comment drowns underneath all that comments, but here is to hoping this gets seen by the  Tonight Show team.
I refused to use any of them.    Restaurant owners have to go back to the old setup. Hire individual people to deliver food.
If the city is mandating a NYC courier fee, then no, we shouldn't have to tip on the food order that already costs DOUBLE what it costs on the menu by the time it gets to us.
Also, the notion that Uber Eats doesn't make money is old news, they've been profitable since 2023. Do actual research instead of looking up clips on youtube...
I love how John Oliver mentions drivers getting robbed in NYC but he will NEVER devote 30 minutes to explain how brain dead Liberals have to be to keep thinking that if you just invade our privacy with more national guard, it somehow will negate the fact they don't keep violent criminals in jail.
John you don't have to tell me not to use the apps...I have never used them and I never will.
Nope never used them
good for customers because it increases revenue/turnover for the joint.   the food is fresh and not sitting in the fridge for 2 weeks less food waste more exposure  stop using the apps or stop complaining
I F***ING HATE TIPPING!!!
It also screws the kitchens involved. Imagine running a BBQ restaurant and having 100 seats in your restaurant. You can gauge how much food you need to make, as it take at least twelve hours to cook. Before your restaurant opens, you have a dozen to go orders.  Then another dozen an hour later. Suddenly you're almost out of all your food and it isn't even halfway through they day
Centralized food delivery and even the gig nature is not bad as long as the pay is roughly equal to wage+ benefits. A lot of the problems of both rideshare and delivery simply boil down to the apps under charging in order to gain market share, and now being unable to raise prices too much when pressured to cut loss or (gasp) turn a profit. If you are paying an entire human and maybe their 3000lb car to bring your food to you, your food should be a lot more expensive.
Delivery apps in the EU are regulated. It's really only the US that's basically 40 scams in a star spangled trenchcoat. Shithole indeed.
Millennial here, can still enjoy Harry Potter just fine as I haven't totally lost my mind, unlike some of my co-generationistas.
I'll keep going to the place in person, there's less time for people to fling their snuffleupagus snot in my food.
9:54 The 3 times I've used these apps my food smelled like cigarettes or electronic fruit.
Delivery drivers working for actual restaurants still get no love. Thx
So you dont have the delivery fee? Iam confused. In my country, we pay for delivery separate.
When I did Uber eats they started having an option for the driver to call into the restaurant and order, and boy those jobs paid way more than normal ones, I suspected it was with out the restaurants knowledge, and this was few years ago so maybe it's changed, but like it wouldn't say on the order, specific, like they want a California burger, but doesn't tell how they want it cooked, so I'd just have to guess and hope they like it
What, nobody's going to talk about how these delivery services rely on unskilled immigrants to supply the labor needed to make the system function.
this is a good follow up to what writer david bell put into a recent episode of Some More News, hosted by Cody Johnston and katy Stoll.
Uber has never made profit either. ever. not one single quarter has ever been less than a devastating lose financially. regularly pulling in about 1%-5% of its operating costs.
Nothing like a years-old call back to horse fucking.
IPOs and venture capital and unprofitable monopolistic large cap growth companies are one giant ponzu scheme that makes profitable businesses unprofitable or just plain starves them of capital in order to ultimately put them out of business.
🇹🇯
I REFUSE to use these apps. the fees are so insane it's not worth it. taking a $10 order to a $30 total is ridiculous.
The f*ck am I paying these huge delivery fees for then??
I do use those apps though trying to cut back or using the app and getting the food myself. It is pricey. The apps need to pay the drivers and restaurants more.
i think they should reverse the youtube edit if the show. keep the main topic for the hbo subscribers and show us the news bits at the beginning. you know; what happened 'last week'
Upon further listen, The Devil Went Down to Georgia is a tie. The devil’s part is definitely a better song, and Johnny’s part is fine. Johnny’s part is definitely less memorable though, but I’m not sure if the winner in this case is decided by fiddle skill purely or by songwriter and arrangement skills as well as technical ability.
Yes tie bad food made too slow into the delivery worker’s performance evaluation.  Grreat job morons.
On the contrary, the only reasonable tip is 0. No tip. Nothing. Tipping is not just an ugly thing, it's also damaging because it's the very things that makes the employers consider paying their workers starving wages and not providing them with healthcare or anything, because they think like "they're gonna earn a lot by tipping, so why not keep all the profits for ourselves". But tipping is never enough nor will ever be a steady and sure source of income. So, tipping's gotta go and workers should get their salary from their employer exclusively. If you tip, you want to feel better about yourself but are actually allowing this exploitative system to continue.
What about waitr? lol!
I deliver pizza for a chain. In my market, I average $30-$40/hr (wage and tips). I can live pretty comfortably in my area but still have to rent. We have regulars who order literally every day or every other day. The delivery fee here is lower than most and we see larger tips than most. Because its a chain, theres more structure in place to handle things like pay, employee conflict, and there are people to be held accountable to customers, employees, and managers. I always try to convince app drivers to at least go check their local places. Even just working a 4 hour dinner or lunch rush can net you more than youd make in a full day of app runs.
literally had to ask my driver who barely spoke english the other day how to tip him the other day because i couldn't find the button
This is Uruguay's fault... we invented this delivery apps :(
weed does not affect my motor skills.  those lawmakers love being naive.  thanks for being so jaded they will re-drop the hammer.
Loom sales is a ridiculous business.  A company will definitely let a downstream company take the lions’s share of a consumer’s purchase price simply because they wound not make the sale anyway.  But it becomes a real problem when a company or a handful of companies can essentially corner the market of the entire restaurant industry while losing a lot of money after all operating expenses, taxes and interest in most cases, simply because Wall Street will pour good money after what would otherwise be considered bad bad as long as you are growing, because the point is to create a colluding monopolistic competition scenario that takes the lions share if take out profits industry wide, pays unlivable wages to workers, and gouges consumers almost to the point of destroying the broader take-out industry through high prices poor quality and undercutting the take-out business of the restaurants.
Trump would make it simple .. blame it on Biden.. well let stormy tell her side of the story😂
As a non-American, it still baffles me, that customers in America  have to pay for already overpriced food, outrageous fees, and a huge part of the staff's salary, since those companies can't be bothered to pay living wages.
I started laughing out loud when John said we, the consumers, make money from food delivery apps. They charge nearly double after all the fees and tips! How is that making money?
Oh, I see... algorithms on social media - good, algorithms on food delivery apps - bad.  Thanx for clearing that up.  And BTW, the definition of "first world problem" has to include worrying about how someone else makes a living.
I honestly don't understand why you're discussing these dubious schemes. There are plenty of options like Eledator and similar ones that are fast and profitable.
Many of us feel like Johnny lost the fiddle battle.
"...high as a giraffe's asshole." - nice.
There is almost no meaningful benefit to ordering food via delivery. It costs more, makes you lazy, and hurts the bottom line of the ones actually producing the food for you.  The only time I do it is when I'm sick and can't leave the house.
*sigh* at the tipping culture in US
As a European, you should just pay your employees decent wages instead of relying on tips, it should be illegal for a company to pay less than minimum wage unless it's not a fulltime job.
“15-30% commission on the order”  Well we know where the restaurant price inflation came from
The story at 17:45 is utterly unthinkable if you live in a country with mandatory health insurance (which, due to being mandatory, is also shouldered by everyone, as it should be).
Sow universal digital consumer rights and unions for gig company's that  need it.
"sorry you don't get to go to heaven - that was test and you failed it!" - hahahaha but seriously - who orders food during an extreme weather event like flooding and EXPECTS someone else to deliver it?  You know who you are.......
Shut the fuck up John. So crazy to hear a millionaire tell people with less money how they need to spend their money.
Tipping is a garbage practice kept in place by industrialists who don’t want to pay employers fairly
Somehow  the worst part was that half their salary is tips...
I door dashed during the pandemic, there were orders from restaurants that were closed for years in the mall and I called them ten times with pictures of the location being empty and nobody cared. The last day i dashed, i was sent there again. I personally texted the customer to let them know that the restaurant isn't running and I informed customer support. Quitting was so unclimactic all I had to do was cash out my whopping $100 for 12 hrs worth of work (not including gas otherwise its more like $40 left) delete the app and just stop. I miss the people i got to know at several restaurants that were actually running, but I don't miss being sent on ghost missions for zero pay only to be ignored when I report to headquarters. Oh and fun fact us drivers found out that all the premium or bonus offers were rigged so you'd only get orders out of town until the offer is over then suddenly your algorithms reset to your location. We also discovered the more dashers who decline an order the higher the order payout ratchets up. People need to understand door dash gets your money and puts it in a big pool and your tip won't all necessarily go to me. That's why you should make sure to tip your delivery driver cash when they show up to ensure they get the full amount instead of DD. I could go on all day, I had to buy my own bags and cup holders too, taxes were a nightmare and after doing the math I actually lost money dashing between vehicle maintenance and repairs and gas. Also remember door dash will try to stack two or more orders on their driver's too so even if you pay extra to get it delivered as fast as possible it still could take a while if door dash is making me go from arbys to chipotle and drop off whoever lives closest first. Also another key to remember as a Dasher the suggested route to take is never the fastest or most sensible, you really have to know your city and be able to ignore gps to go take your own shortcuts. Once you start going the gps will try to correct you but after a certain point it gives up lol and sees what path you're taking. Just one last thought as well, please turn on your porch lights and make sure your walkway is clear of snow or toys so your driver doesn't have to worry about slipping while carrying four pizzas and a two liter of Fanta up your property because you live two miles past the papa johns delivery zone.
They aren’t profitable cuz they pay their CEOs a ridiculous amount of money…no other reason
i'm sorry...but how does tipping stand to "hurt" the apps? (-_-') I will order food direct from a restaurant, but other than that. It's a labor's right problem.
Glad I stopped using these apps.
To ask people to tip is wrong.
Damnit John don't you dare take this away from me
we are not the winners. Doordash has raised prices so much they are highly profitable and both the consumer AND the restaurants are getting screwed. The point that consumer is the winner and currently underpaying is WILDLY off and Incorrect
Ethics get in the way of business.  This is why I stopped running my own business after 8 years of barely being able to squeeze out a meager living - I finally learned I had to throw ethics to the curb and get good at manipulative sales and I just couldn't do that.
Being able to list a restaurant without their consent should be illegal.
I’m so glad that John said the Devil plays a better fiddle than Johnny because I’ve said this for YEARS!
Again we boil this down to what you can do - be a better human than a corporation...well, how has that gone for us?
Glad I don’t do cash deliveries.
And sow much for ai being a good thing.
I remember working at a restaurant pre-Uber eats when a delivery company called “wheel deliver”. That feeling of dread when you have a full restaurant and and you hear the receipt machine print out orders for an entire office floor…
See that's a scintecest has ethics.
I've never seen it cheaper to use an App
Sow much for tech company's being a good thing.
Can we collectively agree on a system or sign to put in the additional instructions portion of the order, that signifies a cash tip is waiting? That way the delivery driver knows that there's a guaranteed tip waiting. And if the driver reports the cash received as taxable income? That's between them and their god.
I don't know who the ultimate bad guy is regarding parking in a fire lane, but I see food delivery service people do it all the time (when there's empty parking spots 20 feet away) and it's very unsafe.  There's one place I go that a savvy cop could reach his monthly ticket quota in a day.  The thing I find hilarious about this is that I call the place myself on my way there, park in a spot legally, walk in, pay the restaurant myself the full amount in cash and tip the staff, get my food, and walk out to my car past the illegally parked delivery service people's cars that are still sitting there.  I genuinely do not understand what benefit these "services" provide if I can get my food faster, pay less, and have the restaurant get more money by not using them.
One last thing about the apps is quality control on all parts is extremely difficult.   I work at a restaurant, if we screw up any part it is both extremely hard to fix and also depending on the exact mistake there is no way for us to know if it was on our end, the delivery driver's end, or even everything was actually fine but the app glitched or the customer is being unreasonable. An example from last night, a miscommunication between the front and the kitchen caused us to accept an order for a item we were out of stock of (purely our fault), it took less than a minute for us to realize this mistake yet after accepting the order we had no easy way to contact the customer, no way to refund that part of the order (or confirm with them that they would even still want the other half of the order), and no way to put the order on hold until we figure everything out so delivery drivers still come to try to pick up the order we can't make yet wasting their time and money. Again the initial cause of the problem was our fault but given the nature of the business there needs to be some resiliency built in for the busiest and most hectic hours.
Imagine having a law which is harder to amend than your own fucking constitution 😂 Like getting rid of all human rights 380 out of 450 votes. And increasing safety of food delivery drivers needs 410 out of 450 votes
I thought Obama Care was supposed to save the day when it came to uninsured people?? Or do they just have to pay the fine since they never bought anything from the overpriced exchange?
Lazy Americans always ruin good things with their own wallets😂
Tipping culture is sick. Those charges should be paid to the workers by the company and already included in the prices. Tipping for everything is crazy, and every year they want a higher percentage!
I'm starting to suspect there are a lot of millennials on Last Week Tonight's writing staff because John relates to us oddly well for being 46
The craziest part was him telling us to tip... what
Black Mirror begins with customer service BS
I just never saw the value in ordering fast food thru an app for more money and 40 minutes wait when i can go and get it baxk to ny place myself in 15 and pay the normal cost.     ~ A Gen-Xer
Former blockbuster employee here to say. Damn that was accurate
But if they're making a minimum rate that they negotiated, why should I then still feel obligated to tip? The whole point of tipping is to subsidize worker pay
These are all whiny, petty complaints. Restaurants don't want to pay commission as if advertising and hiring drivers themselves would be free if not for big mean delivery companies.   People complaining they can't make a living on it. Who told you you could? As you can see in this episode, it's marketed as a SIDE gig. If you choose to do that full time, that was your choice. If you can't find another job, that isn't Grubhub or Door Dash's fault. They pay you more if you deliver it on time? Oh what a terrible system that pays you more for doing a better job.   The lady with the milkshakes: so put a f'ing lid on it you self righteous, entitled millennial tw@t.   Awe you have to charge more money to meet the cost of doing business? Clearly people are willing to oay it, plus the fees. So why not just give up all those customers and move your business to Fantasy Land where running a business is free and you can just sell everything at whatever price you want?   I've done Door Dash for years. There's no better second job. It's easy and even fun if you love driving. You're completely in charge of yourself. I couldn't make a living on it when I got laid off in the pandemic and there were no jobs. But again, no one said I could make a living on it, and I wasn't expecting to because I'm not stupid and immature. And it wasn't Door Dash who took my job nor did they tell everyone in the area not to hire me.   This is all just misdirected anger from people who can't find anyone to blame for their problems. Everyone is always looking to find whose fault everything is. It makes it easier to deal with when you have someone to blame and hate for it.   This is the only John Oliver video I rolled my eyes at over and over and the only one I was too disgusted to finish. This is disappointing. Was it a slow news week over there? And why is this so biased? They talked to one token person who was happy and spent about 10 seconds throwing the companies a bone and then just bashed them for everything whether it was their fault or not and sought out everyone they could find who would say what they wanted to hear. This is why I quit journalism.   Now people are going to reply to this with all kinds of examples of how evil those companies are and what a corporate zombie I am. People are predictable. But I never said those companies were angelic. There's plenty wrong with them. Why didn't the crew here focus on any of the legit bad things in the first half of this video instead of this childish crybaby nonsense? It's true I only saw half the video but that's the half where the legitimate complaints should've been.
I still live in a place where most of the restaurants aren't on apps at all so my millenial ass still has a drawer full of takeout menus and I still have to make an actual phone call. It's truly horrifying. But this segment has made me feel a little better about those damn phone calls at least.
Tipping culture suuuuucks
They don't give much back to restaurants and I can only imagine how little they pay the drivers. Drivers depend on tips. I guarantee it.
Hats off to John, I'm not sure if its the writers or not but you really have been bringing your A game this season and these little segments every week on something new have been both hilarious and informative, long live LWT.
Delivery apps are just scams. I'd much rather pick up my own food from a restaurant. I get not everyone can. They might be disabled or something like that but I've saved so much money just eating from home with groceries and very rarely going to pick up food.
good for you john
You know, i bet Millennials will be the fuck around generation on these apps and Gen Z will be left holding /another/ bag. Whether its the environmental impacts of plastics that the boomers fucked around with, or the labor disruptions of the millennials.. I'm hoping the rise in union organization can at least help prevent major problems
Yet everyone uses delivery apps because they don't want to do anything about it. I don't use them, nor do I use AirBnb because of the harmful system it creates. Of course I'll do wrong stuff supporting evil companies, sometimes even knowingly, but I try not to, at least with the most blatantly evil ones, like Amazon.
I have never used any of those apps but I thought that they simply order the food as usual and then deliver it to you.
Tips are earned not deserved.
tip and give high reviews....that'll fix this...
That other dude in the postmates interview shouldn't have taken teh rail just before cameras went live, a real Sam Morris' entourage moment, shoutout to RV railer dude who got immortalized on national television.  ::ON EDIT:: glad I own my house prior to Jon enlightening me I should never be able to own one.
If tipping is optional, not tipping shouldnt be a problem at all and no one should count on that
Tipping is a fd up system... If you need a person to do a job for you, you empley them and you pay them what's fair. Their income shouldn't rely on people's generosity.
I always wondered how this business model created profit. Turns out it doesn’t.
The "Menu for Bottoms" is probably the most insane thing I'll see this year. And, remember, T***p is running for President! I want to tip that Door-dash driver who spoke about delivering to Stoners, even if he doesn't bring me food. He's great!  As I live in NYC, I have 7 restaurants a block away. I do pick-up, but only order online if the restaurants have their own ordering system. Otherwise, I go old school and call them.
There is @Appjusto in Brazil! A delivery app that address ALL these concerns
I'm so glad he agrees that the devil is the better fiddler
The devil threw that competition and everybody knows it.  Think about it a bit, got the kid on pride, plays the long game, and so many other people tried and failed afterwards.
Ill deal with gas.
11:45 I fully agree with him. In the original song I never felt like Johnny won. However Nickleback did a cover and Johnny definitely wins in that battle
Loved or hate him he's right.
Greedy corporations stealing from small businesses
People that want fast food delivered like french fries make me side eye like fries are better served fresh. why mentally choose to eat cold fries...who do you work for🤔
I worked delivery driver for uber/grubhub/doordash/instacart/roadie/ezcater for 4.5 years. right before the pandemic started...and right til mid 2023 when I got a real job with benefits/PTO/etc  i have no idea how I survived doing that as my main source of income.  the illusion of free time is just that, an illusion. you spend so much time driving and driving and working on a schedule you set in a way based off area demands, and you get paid peanuts to wreck your car over time, which adds up to more gas, more oil changes, and of course, my personal favorite, having to get your car repaired because something just had to break.  i will admit, the first 2-3 years were the best, but gradually after everyone started doing it, and the market got oversaturated, it all came crashing down. the ivory tower techies who run this circus are the worst of the worst (which is no surprise, tech startup people have little to no humanity to begin with) and it's only a matter of time before one of them decide to swallow another one and merge.  i feel for the workers who got tricked into thinking this was the future of labor...it's truly not.
This is a severely underrated take on The Devil Went Down to Georgia that really should be rushed to the forefront of our national narrative.
I find it better just to go pick up the stuff for the normal price than to get an incorrect order that smells like cigarettes for twice the price.
Tips are completely stupid. I live in Europe and I barely tip. Tips support business that don't pay their employees properly, why would one support such business practises?  The rest sound like typical American problems, no proper health care, social security, terrible labour conditions. It's like a Third World country.
25:34 “You have to tip” whaaat? 😳 so are we gonna pretend is a good practice for big corporations and the government not protecting labour rights and decent wages?  Tipping culture is off the roads in USA
Realized early on that there was an imbalance between the cost os product and service delivered.  Also anything recommended (shilled) by Jim Cramer as a ‘disrupter’ should be disregarded.  In the beginning too cheap to make sense, now marked up but still seems there’s profit taken off the top. Can honestly say rarely used a delivery app. Although there’s some middleman costs we order through the restaurant app and pick it up ourselves.  Hopefully profits remain in restaurant. Usually we leave a cash tip when we pick up.
If the ride is 20 bucks for Uber, the driver gets eight dollars
I just pick up my damned food. It's faster, and much cheaper.
“Starting an orphanage” 😂 it was at that point that most people would realize this man has absolutely no connection to reality. At least not the rest of us live in.
I've always felt that the devil won that competition. Glad to hear John agrees.
That single slice of cake order seems to me so so so so sad.   I guarantee the person ordering it had no idea where it was even coming from, geographically.   I order from my few regular places, all nearby my house.   But during pandemic, tons of restaurants that were always previously say out of range would deliver to my house.   I still tried to never order from them, but I have sometimes been about to checkout on an order, look closely at the address of the place, and realize I’m ordering from an entirely different town.   I’m in NYC. Each borough has multiple towns within it. There is no reason for anyone to be ordering food from anywhere over 2 miles away or so, IN NYC.   There are literally hundreds of restaurants every mile here. Even in my residential area of queens, the bulk of all commercial spaces are 1-2 miles away. Why if I have hundreds of restaurants where the delivery should be no more than a 2 minute car ride or 10 minute bike ride am I even seeing places from neighborhoods millions of people’s worth of density from me?   I’d never order from those places on purpose! But if I didn’t pay attention to the address and thought it was just a new place near me opened up, I might make the mistake.
I will NEVER participate with these apps. And I do my due diligence to friends that work for these apps and tell them to work elsewhere. If we completely ignore them, we’d be saving the workers and lazy workers. These apps exacerbates laziness than it actually provided convenience, I swear.
Has anyone else noticed the devil’s part in The Devil Went Down to Georgia sounds like Into the Void by Black Sabbath?
When I worked as an Uber Eats driver I relied on 60% of my income being tips in order to make above my state's minimum wage. If a person didn't tip then I lost money on the delivery after factoring in gas money.
"... as spaced out as a 9th-grader's essay trying to meet the page limit."  This might be my favorite simile ever!!
Seattle was nuts , I only visited for a few days though.
And the delivery apps do not have very good protections from being hacked.  I once had Uber Eats, and my account was hacked by someone who ordered hundreds of dollars worth of food to be delivered in California while I live in Missouri.  The company wouldn't help me in any way.
Fuck your tipping culture.
That bit about the dude with the broken leg is just awful. Poor Americans must be hardcore, don't know if I could be so cheerful at such a fucked up system. People deserve more.
when will doordash drivers stop delivering food to my neighbors house?
Literally never used a food delivery app, not interested
Seeing Lorena Gonzalez defend AB5 for any reason makes me want to vomit. Her law, CA AB5, which was meant to go after Uber, Lyft, Doordash, etc., only ended up killing over 600 freelance positions in the state of CA. She missed her mark and ended up hurting millions of valid freelancers who had nothing to do with app based employment. The fact that the app companies fought against it successfully, only shows how incredibly disruptive AB5 actually is, and how weak it is. Now, Biden and his cronies within the DoL have made AB5 a national policy through the new rules enacted this year without any kind of congressional approval or debate, all so they could get around the fact that The PROAct was stalled in Congress.
Millenialls arent the only ones benefitting. These companies aren't making profit, but their CEOs are rolling in money
lmao got a foodora (food delivery app) ad on the video
I''m AN APP X PERT ! If they deliver food  without beiing called  the app needs an update !
Jon seems to keep calling them “DoorDash, ÜberEats, or Grub hub” workers. The truth is they are self-employed subcontractors. The big issue is the price gouging of being just simply the logistics company.
Why was this episode pulled last time?
American Capitalism in a nutshell!
i have cerebral palsy and don't drive so i rely on these apps a lot. doordash upcharges so much that dashpass (especially on a discount) is basically mandatory to get things for a reasonable price. it sucks being disabled and reliant on an app that fucks people over
Don't forget that all these delivery apps work for the same people you likely do, John. WEF. The real life Spectre. So everything they're doing is just part of the plan. The quicker destruction of cars, and coming very soon, robots to do it instead. So say goodbye to the unofficial unemployment line that is deliverycorp that you'll join as they eliminate peoples' jobs
I'm glad that Uber, Lyft and most delivery app bullshit got slammed with the large cock of regulation here in Germany. Fuck you, you don't get to bypass the law with your "hustle" company. The moment someone works for you, you pay their insurance, and when someone "works for you" is clearly defined in law.
I'm sorry, but The Devil not only cheated by playing a guitar he said was a fiddle, he was also the judge and still lost somehow?
been in restaurants for over 15 years, and just from a POV of freshness, and sustainability, waste, etc, these apps ain't for me. And ya, TIP plz. Also, maybe visit the place IRL
I understand what he's saying. I confess I needed to have someone deliver food when I could not physically shop. It's ALWAYS more expensive, whether it's groceries or a restaurant. I would cheerfully, happily order food from restaurants - if THEY HIRE THEIR OWN DRIVERS... And paid them actual wages, and allowed me to tip the driver.
John Oliver in the past: tipping culture needs to end!  John Oliver now: tip, tip and tip even more!
About time this makes it to consciousness. We also pay 40$ for our 22 dollar chinese food deliveries
I don't think it's unethical to order delivery during a flash flood. Whether or not you order doesn't determine their work schedule and whether or not they choose to be delivering orders that day.
6:54 What is his point? I am sure, he agreed to the 20% and 10% comissions. So that is probably valid. The Tax is an obvious one. If Grubhub does not withohold it, he needs to pay it. Standard practice. The Processing fee is really not that high with 3% and was also probably disclosed before. What is actually a weird is the promotion. Did he ask for promotion? If so, well... I am not saying, this is a fair share of his earnings, but if you don't like, don't use their service. Or charge more, which some restaurants seem to do. As long, as the fees are disclosed, it is all fine, is it?
One thing this segment left out was the phenomenon of “ghost kitchens”.  These exist as a single storefront in the real world, but operate as potentially dozens of fake restaurants on a food delivery app, all of which have the same address and often the same food items too.  The effect of this is a single ghost kitchen taking up huge amounts of space on these apps and artificially outcompeting locally owned restaurants.
18:31 I don’t tip. Laws should demand that employers pay decent salaries.
Boycotting Grubhub from now on.
Sounds like credit score
When you have a system where the worker has to rely on tips to make a living you have a problem. The worker should be paid a decent wage for providing a service. The customer should tip if he is satisfied with the service, the amount he thinks is reasonable. If the service is quick, the order is correct and the interaction is smooth then you tip. It cannot be mandatory!
I also walk to my favorite taco truck to get falafel balls. And I ALWAYS give 5 stars. Unless they did something really disturbing to me…which has never happened.
Isn't there any competition? I mean if companies are so worse them why don't some else start a new delivery company.
Why would a delivery driver need medical care? If you're in an accident, then it's no different if you were driving to the movies.
The guy complaining about buying his bike, helmet, etc has no reason to be upset. They don't provide cars for anyone either and by the time you bought all that stuff you could have a car. If it costs you money to do your job, you have to factor that in. The bike will pay for itself in just a few weeks and then generate profit for you if you stick with it
As for the drivers for the eatery apps. They make such little money it’s pitiful. It’s like government got rid of mafia so as to replace them with corporate. We are still slaves folks. And they wonder why women are refusing to have children to add to the sad existence… And I know the pull yourselves by the bootstraps folks will start coming to my comment.  Naah you’re not going to be the next Jeff Bezos or Zuckerberg but hey keep believing in the American dream lol.
OKAY...as a chef food delivery sucks. They do not get a boost in pay but now thery have to try to fit in to go orders during a busy part of the service...so sometimes it takes extra time because its just extra work....so it basdically screws over both the labor in this,,,the driver, and the line cooks
Thanks for making me laugh. I can’t watch more than one episode, but really look forward to finding one I haven’t seen before. I’m glad you picked apart the food delivery Apps. I don’t use them and knew nothing about them. You turned the rock over, thanks.
I get the safety thing. I used to deliver pizzas . to get there in the shortest time to get maximum tip I would drive up one way streets, speed always, run red lights, park on sidewalks, block street to run up to the door.  my tips were way higher than my wages
I didn't use them during the pandemic, and I wont use them now. Shit's way too expensive.
I never use any of the apps other than Uber or Lyft. And even Uber I just use it if I really have to...  These apps only benefit the Corporate overlords or creators & I’m talking from having driven for Uber & Lift when I was between jobs.  Uber takes almost 20% of you earnings meanwhile you still have to buy gas & pay for maintenance of car… add wear & tear to your body while sitting sometimes 8-10 hours on the road.  I drive to my restaurant restaurants & pick up my food. It gives me the opportunity to get off my couch, walk hence stretching my legs & back and also go relate with another human in a good way (greet them, thank them & tip them) without the app being the middle man.  I always keep snacks, fruit, oatmeal & cereal.. it’s not apocalyptic times where you seriously HAVE to use the apps. Plus I’m saving my money so I can get off the rat race … Even dating apps are a shitshow..So I also got off them a looong time ago. If I can’t meet a good man, being single and celibate is really fantastic for helping me focus on building & understanding my inner self & being…  But I totally understand any folks that cannot do without them.
Whoelse has a Doordash ad under this video???😂😂
Diddy did the opposite of Jackson. He's gotten darker every single time you see him. Probably his black heart bleeding through... never bumped his shit anyway and am not surprised at all about his fall. Should've happened 20 years ago
Your writers are on the mark with this one, havent laughed this much since the pandemic
I made a conscious decision years ago to not use these and do pickup.  Such a money saver.  Then I can actually tip the restaurant.  I do however need to be careful as sometimes you can order through these websites for pickup…
One issue I’ve read about that Oliver doesn’t mention is the fact customers aren’t reviewed. We all know there are people that treat others like trash and don’t deserve this type of service. I think there needs to be respect from all levels and that’s the only way to make it fair.
I honestly don't think these apps should be paying for people's health care.   However, the app should have insurance itself for incidents like this.  Health insurance should be government provided.   Allow gig workers to use Medicaid with an option plan.
11:55 this is honestly such a pleb take. While Johnny is sampling folk songs, his performance requires significantly more technical skill, while the devil’s portion is just fast and flashy, requiring almost no skill whatsoever. It can’t even really be called “fiddling” in the more technical sense.  To be fair, Johnny’s portion isn’t that hard either, but the Devil really phoned it in.
This episode won't do much since Americans are too fucked up by now. You willingly replaced restaurants with a few shitty corporate fast food chains. More than half of people are daily microwaving frozen food meals and eating it in front of the television. You're giving kids money to school where they live on a daily diet of pizza and fries. People getting every meal of their day delivered by a wage slave because you don't even know how to cook an egg anymore. Taking time from someone's life because you want a coffee but can't be bothered to use a coffee machine. I wonder which cultural changes made obesity and diabetes a bigger killer than cancer.
Rolling back workers protections? I smell Republican politics and it stinks! Vote Blue, (its the lesser of two evils.) Get involved in politics and stay involved. Make America a place of progress for all.
It is hard to believe that these companies are loosing money...???...How do they continue to exist...???...Who is paying for the loss...???...Why?
I will only tip its exceptional service - the act of tipping cause they are underpaid - form a union, etc - FIGHT for a living wage. Im always amazed when its "oh the poor workers" and its not "Lets help the workers getting paid!" but again grew up in Scandinavia so we have union, labour laws & Protection etc. And things like needing to tip clearly cements US as a shithole, brought down by unchecked greedy AF capitalism...
I disagree with the narrative here:  - The consumer is not being benefited here. Not only the prices are up and the service is worse, the number of times there are issues is increasing.  - You need to use the full scale of classification. Giving 5 starts will continue on ensuring bad service persists.  - Tipping is an absolutely broken system and it’s wild that I’m “morally forced” to tip when there are fees specifically to pay for the driver.  This is just another take of solving wild capitalism by blaming the consumer and I expected more from Oliver
I think Tony Xu was referencing a video game series called Like a Dragon, formerly known as Yakuza. I don't use delivery apps. If I don't want to get in my car and pick up the food then I don't really want it. It's better to go to the grocery store and buy enough food for a week or two. Spending $20-30 a meal isn't a subsidy. The restaurant and consumer is getting robbed while the people delivering the food are getting mistreated.
At least with DoorDash, I try not to order food unless I desperately need to.  80% of my Dashers have delivered my food to the wrong address, most of them not even TELLING ME that they'd even delivered at all.  And, when they do, they just send a picture of someone else's porch, just saying "it's been delivered."  If I then ask whose that is, or tell them that's not my address, I get completely ignored.  I try to consider an appropriate tip, and the literal least I can expect for that is that they deliver to the correct fucking place.   I think the worst part, though, is the fees.  DoorDash and the like add, at the low end, 50% to the cost of my orders in delivery fees, DoorDash fees (which are separate and both charged every order,) and then driver tip.  The smaller the order, the higher that percentage goes since those fees are flat across the board.  There's no way their CEOs can claim that shit's not making money.  They're just lying... unless they count that $181 million as losses so they don't have to pay taxes on it, which would track.  But even then that's a form of lying via fraud.
Local companies could pool resources to hire a group of shared delivery drivers, but delivery drivers, at least in Seattle, had been on the decline for years as restaurants cut hours and staff to squeeze more money out of everyone.  Markets are really bad at doing obvious things, even when it's in their best interest to do so.
I still don't understand the tipping culture in the US... Being subject to earn money or not, and more or less than you should, is just wild...
Boycott gig economy businesses!
That DoorDash tech bro looked more plastic than a lego man.
😲
Tipping is dumb, that's depending on third parties to pay YOUR WORKERS! Tipping should not be required, raise wages
Wolt, an international subsidiary of DoorDash, is currently conducting business as usual, delivering food and groceries to Israel’s illegal settlements in the Occupied Territories while Palestinians are being strategically starved to death or just outright murdered by armed forces.
I've been on these platforms and worked for them. I have to keep reminding ppl that, THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR MAIN JOB, have a plan to get to a stable job ffs. I'm never comfortable working for them and I know it. The mentality is always you milk these times until you can't anymore, have a backup plan, switch to somewhere else, and never be comfortable, again, this is not a main job, and it's not supposed to be. You need an easy-in job, sure, but it's gonna be easy-out. I vote yes on Prop 22 because I know it's gonna be game-over for me if these companies start to pick to can work. The vote is not like a close call either, 2/3 voted yes., that said a lot of about what people want.
Morons. I worked at the top/most busy Hungry Howies in Florida and we got by on 4 to 8 drivers unless it was superbowl Sunday, the day after Thanksgiving, or a hurricane. Then we were stacked with drivers. Beyond that, good drivers can take multiple runs at once.  If you’re so busy you need 15 delivery drivers at all times count yourself lucky
It is seemingly impossible for U.S. Americans to understand that tipping is not a viable solution to poor pay and massage wage theft. The person delivering a slice of cake doesn't need a better tip, they need a better wage.  Also, we already know that companies steal money from tips, and have no problem doing that through an app.   You can't tip your way out of the problem. The real solution is to only order through reputable services/directly from the restaurant, and boycott the unsustainable, predatory apps
Thank you John for checking all the boxes.
Side hussles are for high schoolers, what they are describing is underpaid JOBS
Tipping should be forbidden. Or at least not an requirement for delivering people to survive.
How John just gleaned over the fact that these guys are self-employed... when in the Netherlands Grubhub and other assorted companies tried to push self-employment through (instead of what it is now: they are employed by the company directly) there was a massive outrage and the government got involved straight away, basically supporting the delivery drivers in their legal push to overturn the decision. And they won, handily.
@LastWeekTonight make an episode about music streaming, like in this piece the musicians are the ones getting the short end of the stick, whilst major labels/streaming providers and consumers are all happy to keep the unsustainable status quo
You're forgetting the obvious winners in this scenario: big oil and car companies. Since we're talking the US, most deliveries are probably made using cars.
One meal for the price of two. No thanks.
I have only ever occasionally had pizza delivered, but it is sad that the people who are doing the actual work are getting ripped off while the people who do nothing but make an app are making a lot of money or will be shortly.
Stop tipping
Ah so that's why they park like assholes
This system is incredibly inefficient. I used to work delivery for a restaurant I leave with 5 to 8 out orders at Peak time Drive in a circle within a 2 to 5 Mi radius it would take me 30 40 minutes and I get a tip on most orders plus the per order fee the restaurant give me or they pay for my miles. Plus an hourly wage, sometimes less than minimum, but something. So in a half hour you get probably 5 to 10 dollars in tips ( most tip 10% some way more some don't) 3 to 6 dollars an hour and a bit more in mileage and if it's a per-order fee that can be another five bucks easy. Double that and it's easy to make $30 an hour I'm a busy Saturday night. $15 an hour standard.  With delivery apps now you get an order in and you go to a restaurant that can be 5 or more minutes away. You get a single order that may not be ready by the time you get there and then there's no limit on the delivery range could be 10,15, 20 minutes away. For that half hour of your time you get three to five bucks and maybe the tip. So 10 to 15 dollars an hour with little chance to do better.  I do Uber rides as a taxi now and at least in my market in my city I do fine but I would never touch food delivery in the current system. As an example about 10% of my money as an Uber driver is from tips that pretty much covers my gas I make like 25 an hour per week minimum.  To match that with delivery I would probably need 50% to 70% of my money to come from tips
We need to Form a union !! These apps need to pay the drivers more we can’t rely on tips in this economy 😢
Just eat (in spain) is grubhub there??????? Why are both names in english but yours sucks ass??
You should never tip
Tip culture is disgusting
If people can afford to get high, they can afford to go to the market, pick up some food, cook it. No delivery fee, no waiting and waiting and hoping the food even comes. Just plain lazy. Oh food is so expensive people say who’ve never gone a day hungry.
Seattle has introduced a mandatory $36 minimum hourly pay for these apps. That has directly been passed to users. Uber eats decides it by cart size. Which in reality, basically means you're paying $20-30 bucks in extra fees for every order. I've had to stop ordering now since this went into effect.
It’s called laziness! Fast food places too are for lazy people who refuse to cook for themselves, or people who take Balance of Nature instead of buying real fruits and veggies. Oh food costs are so high! Really? People won’t cook for themselves, pay for food delivery with tip added then act like they have no money. God forbid anyone should get some instant coffee, put it in a thermos and drink it. Nope they need Starbucks and complain how expensive it is. And then when you order food, you don’t get it people yell.
Capitalism failed, fails and will keep failing… it wiil take decades, even centuries, but will get rid of it eventualy.. people in the future wiil ser our time as primitive and barbaric, just like we see past slavery times..
Be sure your delivery driver in CASH.
So, my biggest takeaway from this, is, that we need to enshrine expanded rights and protections for independent contractors.
solution: make your to go packaging covered in “not affiliated with delivery services” stickers
I have a lot of customers that I will deliver for anytime I see their address pop up. I also remember the ones that don't tip, and their orders will get rejected over and over until the heat death of the universe. I ran a restaurant for over 10 years before getting into the delivery, and this is not a terrible life. It could be much, much better, and I frankly my living situation is fairly unique so I'm lucky in that regard. I run Doordash, Uber Eats, and GrubHub simultaneously. I very rarely stack them but I definitely remember the good customers addresses and will go out of my way to get their orders because I know they tip. I also remember the non-tippers and liars (the ones who claim to never get their delivery) and your shit gets to sit there forever and not get picked up. You can hang wring and all that all you want over the capitalist company not paying me enough, I completely agree. But that don't pay my bills. If you're not reasonably compensating me between your tip + the base fee, your shit isn't getting delivered.
Typical liberal bs. How's $41,600/yr ($20/hr) for a 16 year old brand new hire at McDonald's going to work for you? Buena suerte.
I hugely regret that I voted for prop 22. I asked all the Uber and Lyft drivers I knew, what they would prefer, and they all said "vote yes." So I did.  Just goes to show how much misinformation those companies put out there, and how much money they spent doing it.   The thing is... If you have all those millions to spend, why not spend them on taking care of your workers, instead of on lobbying for unethical laws?   The amount of money companies put into doing the wrong thing, lobbying for the right to be shitty, fighting workers comp and healthcare claims, paying fines for unethical business practices- it seems like, if they invested that money in doing right by people instead, things would be better, and cheaper.
The real irony is that the people in burbs and cities who are really jumping up and down in anger along side John in this story are the ones ordering from these services and causing the problem in the first place.  Sure as shit isn't some bible thumper asshole living in the middle of fuck nowhere on a farm somewhere.  It's you - you're the problem.  You really don't need to take these jobs if you don't like the pay (and IMO you shouldn't), and you really DO get to chose your own hours.  If you get hired at Chipotle or whatever you get scheduled, you do not choose a damn thing.  And people DO value their freedom more than money sometimes, it's very common actually.  The companies paint an overly rosy picture of this, sure, but the flexibility IS there.  Problem is the margins for these gig jobs are ULTRA thin, so you have to bust your ass in order to make significant money.  There's a definite trade-off in that.  And from the restaurant perspective, this is like tip culture here in the States.  You can babble on about how fair it is to the restaurants all day long, but fact of the matter is if you ask MOST restaurants if they want to be removed the answer is no, just like tips.  Because they get a hell of a lot of orders through these services that they wouldn't get otherwise.
20:19 off those all new costs cost so much, maybe they should stop spending on unneeded and unwanted things like lobbying and advertising. I did one one time during the pandemic. I’ll never spend $20 on a McDonalds ever again until I can accept the inflation has fucked me as hard as it has.
If anything I enjoy Harry Potter more. JK Rowling has more balls than the men she offends. I dare you to do an honest piece on the trans subject, with the good ánd the bad. Good luck.
This is why I always order at the website of the restaurant, not one of the apps. And you mostly get a free drink as a thanks (in the Netherlands)!
When Food Apps have no contract with a restaurant, things can get shitty real quick.  DoorDash will send a driver to a restaurant at the same time the order is submitted, and the Dasher shows up long before the food is ready - meaning either standing around waiting for the food, or canceling and wasting the time and fuel it took to get there in the first place.  The worst Dashers will make a scene, yell at servers, and ruin the dining experience for anyone within earshot of them.  Why don't the Apps send a driver over when the food is expected to actually be ready for pickup?  Because getting a driver when the food is ready requires a restaurant to sign a contract and pay 30% commissions: it's the whole milk and a cow scenario.
The guy at 7:00 showing the grubhub bill payed almost 4K in promotion... so it's not 58% taken by grubhub service alone
Is fentanyl safer to be around than the police are saying?  Is Joh Oliver right, that it cannot be inhaled accidentally via proximity?  I don’t know who to believe still… John Oliver or the Police
I live in a rural small village and the only place that delivers here is the local kebab place that has been here for like 40years.
I’m trying not to use DoorDash delivery unless I’m in a pinch and when I do I tip really well. I prefer to use a stores app if they have one and then go get it myself.
skype was bought by microsoft and the tech is utilized by ms teams. Not the way @John criticize
Can someone please explain why we can't enjoy Harry Potter anymore? It went over my head, I guess! TIA
The worst part is if the restraunt is allready setup for delievery and dont need or want these inferior services.  They have no choice but to use the app because thats what everyone uses to order with now. And if your not on the app its like you dont even exist. So they have forced everyone to cough up 33% off the top
4:19 okay... okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay, I know it's not the point. I know. I do. But I'm so scared and confused right now.  Normally when John brings up something like this, he then would go on a side tangent to explain why a leach has 10 stomachs, 32 brains, and 9 pairs of testicles, and he didn't. So now I'm sitting here, questioning if I'm willing to let sleeping dogs lie, or Google it.  I mean, maybe John decided to not tell us because the joke was fine as is, maybe he needed to cut it for time, maybe he suddenly developed something resembling restraint when it comes to destroying his audience's happiness.  Maybe, that's true, or maybe a dozen HBO lawyers tackled him and his writers and forced them to take it out because he has finally found the line HBO won't let him cross.  Honestly not sure what the point of what I just said was, I just had to get it out there.
Thank you! Not to mention, though, the very limited bathroom access we have while making deliveries!
LOL. Never used any of these delivery apps. I'd rather pick up on my own.
There is other uses for a food delivery backpack and I've seen a fun one! The 2nd half of this video link has the story with full visuals, I highly recommend giving it a watch.😁 https://youtu.be/HVjhJ7FrWtg?si=kqbw-8S9kcBfCMzm
That kind of BS is exactly why I always try to tip in cash. The delivery guys get little enough as it is. Uncle Sam doesn't need to be sticking his nose into their wallets too
Such a warped take on CA's Prop 22, but I guess it comes with the territory of being super progressive.  ALL ABOUT DEMOCRACY, until an issue is turned over to the people and the people vote it down in a landslide, then all of a sudden democracy can go fuck itself and "tHe PeOpLe gOt TrIcKeD, ThEy DoNt kNoW wHAt tHeY wANt."  The people weren't tricked, the people didn't want higher food prices, plain and simple.  And they don't care if a dasher suffers to keep their cheap prices in the same way they don't care about child labor if it means not getting the new iPhone.  People look out for themselves first and foremost, it's as simple as that.
It's the same in Europe as well, where Wolt, Uber and GrubHub, called JustEat, is killing restaurants with the same rates and they do everything to hide how much they take. Restaurant owners do not see the sales, unless they save every order. They just see an amount deposited to their bank account. They don't know it's only 60-50% of what  the customer paid. The restaurant takes all the risk and are even blamed when deliveries are handled wrong, food goes cold from delivering multiple orders at once and here food prices and sales taxes make up an even larger amount, than in the US.
LEHMANN OWNS POSTMATES, YOU'RE SELLING YOUR SOUL TO SOMEONE WORSE THAN THE DEVIL--YOU'RE SELLING YOUR SOUL TO A GREEDY JEW
as someone who doesn't use delivery apps but has gotten hit by delivery workers on motorbikes multiple times - on the pavement and zebra crossing) please teach them traffic rules before offering employment. 😒
America needs to include hard tip right into the meal or service like our bro france
As someone who has continuously worked from home since 2020, I jump at the chance to take a short drive to pick up dinner. I don't get why people would pay 2-3 times the value of a meal to have it delivered. Most people demand free online delivery for everything else!
I worked as a pizza delivery driver for 4 years during college, in the early 2000's. I saw the introduction of the "delivery fee," which immediately hurt drivers' tips. That didn't get better in the two years I continued to deliver afterward. Hopefully, tips are better now..  I also did gig work on Door Dash and Instacart for almost two years on the backside of the pandemic (mostly to just get out of my house for a few hours, and the extra money never hurts). So I have experience doing both sides of that coin. It is MUCH better to be able to set your own hours and not ever having to clean a restaurant to close it at 1:30 a.m.  I also work as a freelance writer, so the independent work part is nothing new for me. You can write these expenses all off in your taxes. There are a lot of benefits of being an independent worker, and I've preferred this route in life for nearly two decades now. You just have to be good at managing your money, which you should be anyway.  I will have to say, I left Door Dash when they made it far easier to get contract violations earlier this year. All a customer had to do was say you delivered the wrong order, no proof, and you are suddenly in trouble. I would find out through the app that I had a violation and you cannot actually appeal it. You're not allowed to call them about it and there is no direct contact for whoever supposedly handles this anywhere. I had two situations where this happened and I could prove that the customer reported false information, but when there is no one to prove that to, there's nothing you can do. That level of disrespect towards drivers is why I stopped Door Dashing entirely.  And then I reported on it in a local paper that I write for...
why not tax the food delivery by 3rd party companies other than the food preparer 90% tax like many states do with vaping ....the good apps would have to raise their prices and would not be able to compete directly with the restaurants themselves
Because if we aren’t here to take 60% of our family’s money, than they can go fuck themselves.
God the US is ffed up. In the EU, these people are treated as employees by law. Like, they have to be.
I call order and pay/collect at the desk as much as i possible can i only use these apps in dire needs and thats maybe once every 3 months or so it doesnt take much to see they are coining hard and restaurants are suffering.
There seem to be a ton of startup businesses based on the model of "no one else is doing it, so let's hurry up and lose money on it indefinitely so we can be dominant just in case it becomes profitable one day.
I drove for LYFT for about a year what a joke.
i have never on my own used a food app...i prefer to give the restaurant my money....but ppl who use food apps for pizza delivery deserve their over payment since pizza places do their own delivery normally
About a year ago I was ordered food off a small restaurant's website and when I picked it up, the owner thanked me profusely for not using a delivery app
Couldn’t miss my weekly dose of existential crisis 🥰
0:33 ...what the fuck did I just see?
Tbh the idea to use buying a horse, instead of however many small businesses could’ve been saved by that $184M was a pretty horrible use of an argument
I refuse to have food delivered. I rarely bother to eat out anymore. We pick up Chinese a couple of times and month but find most of these delivery companies just disgusting.
Here's a little insight on GrubHub in other countries (Germany edition). Here it's called "Lieferando" (Liefer meaning delivery). Here they take a significant portion of the money, too. However, Germany has a huge problem with Kebab restaurants commiting money laundering and tax evasion while selling subpar, low quality products.  Part of the reason is that arab and turkish clans with mafia like structures thrive in big german cities (especially Berlin and the Ruhr Area), but their reach is huge. If you see a restaurant on Grubhub/Lieferando, chances are high that they are legitimate businesses who pay their taxes and don't sell you crap.  Still, ordering from them on the phone or in person yields them the most profit. But some of them don't take phone orders anymore because they don't want to pay for their delivery guys. But often these Apps are a good indicator about the legal legitimacy of a business.
The only reason they exist is to be a parasite once they have an IPO they have been able to dump stock and make it rich off everyone else. Tony Xu CEO of DD sold 130k shares at $190 share in February 2024. He’s sold over 1 million shares since ipo. In the entire 2023 internal stock transaction was sell offs only, that shows not one C Suite or corporate employee has any interest to take on new options but just dump what they have. They know it’s not sustainable so it’s all just suck as much from the stock as you can while you can. It’s just parasitic wealth extraction, and we are gonna see so much more of it as we descend deeper into late stage capitalism.
I'm sad to tell you all this.  But just don't use delivery apps.  Specially if you are in debt. It is even with the melenial subsidy, it is one of the most expensive ways to eat.
20:50. Keep prices low for consumers? At this point you’re already paying nearly double the cost using these apps that you would picking the food up yourself. I’m already priced out of using them. 😂
Damn! Skype deeeeeeefinitely fumbled the bag!!! Forgot all about em
As an Uber Eats deliverer in Seattle who delivered on bike and feet, one of the things i noticed was that Capitol Hill was the highest tipping neighborhood (where all the rich gays live haha)
What he says at the end about tipping — he is spot on. Once I got a delivery with Instacart. It had two orders on it. The first was literally two bottles of some alcoholic drink from a convenience store. The second was a week or two worth of groceries From a grocery store. I was instructed to pick up the drinks first, then I headed for the grocery store.  The person who placed the grocery store order was someone I had worked with before, and they are super nice and tip extremely well. But the order took me about half an hour to shop for. I was partway through the order when the person who had ordered the drinks contacted me. Apparently the first person that had tried to fulfill that order had failed somehow, and now it was getting late, and she wanted to cancel. But what was I gonna do with her drinks? — I don’t drink alcohol. And driving back to the store to return them just like too much – especially since it was not close to anywhere that I was going to be in the next hour.  When I got out of the grocery store, I tried to go drop off the drinks first, but the app would not give me that person‘s address. I was forced to deliver the groceries first, and finally ended up at the house with the lady who ordered the drinks.  The next day I discovered that my tip from the drinks order had been pretty much zeroed out. but it wasn’t my fault. I did exactly what was requested of me, and I was as efficient as I was capable of being. It was completely outside of my control. Instacart decided to bundle an already lowball low tip order with a large, high tip order. it was completely completely out of my control that I had to pick up the drinks first and deliver them last. I did nothing wrong, but I lost money, because the customer wasn’t happy.  Thankfully, the tip from the grocery order more than made up for the lack of tip on the other one. But seriously, for people who rely on these gig jobs, we have bills to pay too. We need five stores and we need tips. Otherwise, we will stop doing that work, and find something else, and you’ll have to go pick up your own food. It’s cheaper to do that anyway.
Thank you 🙌🔥 Not to mention the gas prices. Sometimes you end up losing money if you’re not careful and accept a $1 order. Also, they don’t take out taxes. So you better expect to pay Uncle Sam a good chunk of your money. Car insurance wants a piece too. Pretty much not worth it unless you really need the cash.
If you live in USA and you tip then your a POS
This is a LONG rant, but the only thing I find frustrating with “auto-tipping” and “auto-rating” culture is that it breeds the chance that you’re compromising the service you’re bound to get by doing it. I’m in NYC, and the amount of times the driver knowingly delivered/picked up the wrong order to begin with (which after scrolling the comments, seems like restaurants have started holding orders behind the counter to prevent this) or harassed me to meet them on the street vs delivering to my apartment door (no joke - one driver refused to buzz into my building and left my food on the sidewalk and bounced) just to speed up their delivery times (which watching the video, I see why they’re incentivized to do this) defeats the whole purpose of using delivery. I’m already paying a service fee to the app to get the right order delivered, and yes - I do expect the order to make it to my door vs me going out of my way to help them complete the delivery - otherwise I could have just picked up the order (I’m almost always ordering local to me). It winds up being what exactly am I tipping them for? What exactly am I even using the service for? They used to have a “tip in cash” option which I ran into WAY less issues with because it incentivized the driver to meet me at my apartment door face to face, and gave me the chance to check the order in front of them, but that option’s gone now. I don’t feel comfortable just auto-rating the driver or auto-tipping them - if they don’t actually provide the service they’re opting into providing, SHOULD they be able to continue doing it? Not trying to be harsh, I’m asking sincerely - why give money/high scores when they’re not actually doing the service you’re tipping/rating for? I’ve had great delivery drivers too, but I’d rather the ones who aren’t willing to do it right not have the option to continue doing it and rate/tip fairly to keep the good drivers around who’re doing it properly.
it was there the whole time. John Oliver was  a little too in to horses
thank goodness, I always rate 5 stars if my food arrives at all. and if I get a message from my dasher that my order is taking a while, I'll add extra tips cuz I know they're losing time and tips on my order. I've been rated in customer service jobs and I hated it, I know a bad rating can mess up your day even if you're doing everything right.
I don't like how this video turned into consumer guilt for not tipping. It is not our responsibility to pay additional, especially when a billion dollar company has the power and ability to increase wages instantaneously. Shift the blame to greedy corporations, not hungry and broke consumers. We need to end tipping culture - no other country does this BS.
Nope.  Not going to feel sorry for the asshat delivery people in NYC. They are very dangerous.
Starting an orphanage lmao. As if you needed more evidence of how looney these CEOs are.
I hate it when the burden of paying servers/drivers etc is put onto the end consumer. Why is it MY responsibility to provide a living wage to YOUR employees. Just add the cost of their wages to the product and let me decide whether or not to buy it at that price. Why is this acceptable in this industry and not others? As an engineer that makes designs for clients, should the client tip me over and above paying for the drawings? As an accountant that does the books for a client, should the client tip me over and above the hours billed? Should I tip the Amazon delivery driver or the person at the checkout when I get my groceries??? It is ridiculous to put this on us instead of just charging enough to cover their wages. And lets be honest, they are definitely already charging enough to cover the wages adequately. They are just being greedy and denying their workers a living wage because we are letting them get away with it. I do tip, but only if the service is above and beyond, because a tip is a bonus, not something you are automatically entitled to.
I have stopped delivering for DoorDash. Originally it was Grubhub, but when I cancelled several orders after accepting them one day (2 or 3 in a very long day), they cancelled me and never responded to me again. So I switched to DoorDash. But then they made it so I had to keep a high acceptance rate to get orders with good tips, meaning I couldn’t just ignore the low ball orders. It wasn’t worth my time. So I quit. Now I just do Uber ride share. I tried Uber Eats, but although they keep the ratings separate, they combine acceptance rate of orders and rides. So I accept 95% of the ride offers I get, but I’d probably accept only 30% or less of the Uber Eats offers, and I want to keep my rate up because then I can see what direction and the length of the trip I am being offered. Imagine I have half an hour left to work, and I get a trip that’s an hour away. I want to know that!  All in all, delivery companies don’t pay their drivers enough. I’m slowly building up a business so that I don’t have to rely on gig work anymore. Although I’ll keep driving for Uber as long as I’m in college; they are paying for my full scholarship to Arizona State University, and as long as I make a few trips per month (at least 100 points, which is 34-100 trips per quarter), I keep the scholarship. But that’s like a couple hours per weekend, in the evening. I had to get to 2,000 trips to get there, but now I’m enrolled and have signed up for classes next month.
Idk how but there is definitely a connection between this and piece of shit cops
America needs to stop putting the pressure of people keeping or losing their jobs on the customer. In any other country we have the FREEDOM (their favourite word) to give a realistic rating or choose not to tip for bad service because we know the delivery people are protected by law and receiving a decent income. While I sympathise with the workers who are getting screwed, I’ve also heard a lot of horror stories online of drivers (mostly from grubhub) not delivering food and eating it themselves. There has to be some balance.
I'm a Millenial and I never used a delivery app. Always get uncomfortable when someone orders for me and uses one. When I want food, I take the usual way and call the restaurant directly.
I do not have to tip, nor do I need to rate 5 stars. Just look at the Doordash drivers subreddit for reasons why.
Pizza Hut fired all their delivery drivers this year because of Food Apps.
the predatory american capitalist system only has positions available for leeches, liars, whores, and thieves...and those are the only positions they EVER have available...
My Grubhub account was terminated for no reason when asked them they said a third party run a background check and  when I read the report everything looked good but I was cancelled anyway without explanation
The model of "receiving a service worth far more than what you pay for it" is typically found in things like public transportation systems.   These idiots are reinventing government except instead of elected officials that are accountable to votes, they do whatever they want.
I’m an avid fan of refusing to use those services. I either use the restaurant’s delivery, or I pick it up myself. The model is really screwed up and that’s bad for everyone.  On the few occasions when I do use one of these services (such as when I’ll not feeling well enough to pick up myself), I make sure to tip well. The driver is doing a service for me.
The only inaccuracy here is that after a long day of work at Blockbuster in 2003 it was 3:30am and the only thing that was open was a Carrow's across town.
If the company doesn't deliver the food themselves, it's not worth it.
What happened to Skype, John?  Their intolerable programming, that's what.  Constant crashing, hard to initially find people you know, hard to get extra people in the call, annoying to tell if you have money in the account, and of course _you can't close it without force shutting it down._  I tried Zoom once and thought "Thank goodness."
Just to clarify, thats 4 stars for semen in your food, only if you didn't order it that way.
The company doesn’t pay their workers enough because this is capitalism and the goal is to pay the least amount of money possible but John Oliver suggests it’s on us to pay tips and were the bad people for not tipping? Why would I give more money than the company says I owe?
Question - can small businesses create a class action lawsuits?
OR, we could just let the companies fail...Why prop up services that don't work? The world functioned  just fine before them.
Is anything in the world not a scam?
So apps like GrubHub essentially subsidize peoples food by making poor people pay for it. ie the workers and small business owners who have to pay for the outrageous fees and use their own gas to potentially fulfill an order that might actually cost them money instead of make them money. It's literally the perfect representation of American capitalism.
When they started wearing 70x30 for the driver's. Now  30/70 for the workers getting 30. Boston has been fighting for our community. We are a state we have to work. "When we fight we win"  housing, food and education is a human right.
first, i never miss an john oliver video, second i am also terrified to pick up phone calls as an gen z v.v
I'm pissed that we are responsible for paying the workers along with paying for the actual goods and services in the cost. I shouldn't have to tip, because employers should be paying their own workers. It's even worse now that we're expected to tip someone for handing us something from a shelf, or even in places that are self service. Just acknowledge that the workers are doing a job and PAY THEM, so they're not dependent on the whims of individual customers. If I tip 20% on my order, it's not nearly enough to cover their time and expenses, and I can't afford to tip 400% just so the company can avoid their own business expenses.
You don't need the food to be delivered. You just need to walk your ass there and use the restaurant like a normal person.
This isn't just true for delivery.  A couple years ago, I placed a pickup order through an app at my local pizza place, then realized I'd accidentally put a pickup time 6 hours before the time I intended.  In a panic, I called the store to correct it.  The owner was very nice and did, then said, "You can call us directly next time."  Since then, I pick up the phone when I get pizza from them.  And it's less time than the app took.
I don’t know many “eggplants” that like tacos 😂
I dashed for about 3 years.  I'm California door dash gave us pay for insurance as long as we averaged 15 hours per week
You have to stop and think about it before you order food from a Fastfood place. I get food left on my doorstep that was ordered by my neighbors. When I pick it up and look at the receipt to try and figure out what is going on, here is what I see. Two fast-food burger meals that would have cost them (at the time) $18, but he receipt shows $37 without the tip. How can a young married couple who both work and together make $50k a year afford to order a $18 crappy fast food burger meals to be delivered for $37 plus tip?  Something is very wrong. Also this happens quite often, getting someone else's food order left on my doorstep and sometimes I don't see it until the next morning, and I check the receipt and see the same thing, it is crazy stupid. Who pays for the delivery and food that never gets to the correct customer?
most drivers in CA liked Prop 22, and it did give Medical insurance stipend.  Many of us need the Independence. And the Expenses we pay for all tax write offs. There are some advantages if you figure out the complicated tax code.  Making one's own hours was beneficial. The problem came when Uber Eats was allowed to buy out the competitor  Postmates. It negated some of the benefits of Prop 22 because Postmates promoted tips and charged customers less. Tips didn't count against the biweekly Prop 22 minimum wage bonus. But Uner Eats did pay more for deliveries, but that meant less tips so little biweekly bonus
In Boston Ma we are still trying to get this passed... 😢
This is on top of the fact that many delivery people will take on multiple orders in a single delivery cycle. So when you order your food, even if it is made fresh as the delivery person is standing at the counter, your food has to wait in line for several other deliveries to be made "on the way" to your address by the same driver. This of course means food quality issues, depending on the type of meal you order, and also, being given someone else's order, regardless of benefit or loss.  This is on top of the fact that many "contractors" who deliver the food, SUB-contract out, to other people, including, their own family members. This is why sometimes, you get info on a person delivering food, that doesn't match the driver, the vehicle, or even the phone number of the person delivering YOUR food.  They've basically turned themselves into dispatch services, where they manage several "deliverers," for a cut of the earnings, even after all the other cuts.  Making these apps, a "911" service for the munchies.  It's insane.
I did go listen to The Devil Went Down to Georgia as suggested and, no John, the Devil is not a better fiddler than Johnny. Half of the Devil's bit has no fiddling at all, and the parts he *does* play aren't as technically complicated as they sound. Johnny's part is more difficult to play, and he isn't relying on other people to puff him up and make him sound more impressive than he is.
Please do an episode on Stubhub and all the marketplace ticketing apps. I have heard so many people who have been scammed on these apps and these apps have an incentive to keep the scam going because they make money from each fraud. I bought a ticket and then sold it on the same platform for the same price because I couldn't go. The seller never delivered the tickets so I wasn't able to deliver the tickets to the buyer that I sold it to. As a result, I was given $180 from the platform as a compensation for not getting my tickets but I was also charged $450 for not able to deliver the tickets I sold. That is a $270 profit for them! Why would they fix fraud if that is profitable? And imagine the scale of this across!
If you're wealthy enough to use one of these apps, you're probably pretty well off. I used one a few times in the early days of the pandemic, and the costs were double what the same food would cost in a restaurant.  ...I'm eating a lot of rice, beans, and re-heated frozen soup these days.
Anyone remember takeout taxi? My dad delivered for them back in the late 90s and they had a multiple restaurant delivery setup.
I have never used a food delivery app. The few times I have had food delivered in my 63 years of life it was by an employee of the restaurant and they got a tip. There is no reason for these apps to exist.  Microwave a can of soup if you can't go to a restaurant to get food made fresh by someone else and can't be bothered to cook for yourself.
In my town, a sleep-deprived, single mom working 2 PT jobs plus Doordash, fell asleep at the wheel and crashed head on into a parked car with an elderly lady, that just returned from the hospital with major heart surgery, waiting for her son to come around from the driver's side and help her. The elderly lady died.What  the actual fuck is wrong with this country that a single Mom can't get a decent paying job and falls asleep at the wheel from exhaustion. She had no insurance and her old car was totaled.
I've been delivering since 2016. Back then, making $12-15 was nice, better than other low skill jobs, even with the expenses. But now $15 jobs are everywhere and delivery wages have not gone up. It's not even worth it anymore. I have to deliver packages and groceries to make the job worthwhile.
NO.. i don’t care how much you pay your writers… PAY THEM MORE!!😂😂
I knew when they came out that all these apps are essentially scams that hurt everyone up and down the chain.  I have never used them and never will!   When I want take out, I CALL the place and place my order... and then get my a%# out there to pick it up!
I knew what I was signing up for when I came to watch this video, but still... Fuck you John. Thanks for another dose of The World Is SHIT.  Anyway, tip. ALWAYS tip.
Im sorry, but this might be peak american optimism/absurdism:  Instead of regulating these apps, in order to get their parent companies to treat their employees more fairly... just remember to tip and leave 5 stars reviews!  And remember the old mantra, if a worker its not paid well enough, you as the consumer are 100% responsible.
Seattle has a mandatory minimum $5 tip which (hopefully) goes directly to delivery drivers on all these apps for all orders. In response, menu prices and fees have gotten much higher to the point where it is 2-5x the cost of just going to the restaurant (i.e. 3 McChickens costs $40 including base tip). Not sure I really buy the "These companies won't charge you what this service is actually worth" argument. Don't get me wrong I agree with every other point in this video, but for me at least I think its simply not worth it anymore.
I went to order a 14 dollar order of Wings from buffalo wild wing, at the building it is 14 but door dash was 18 deliver but those fees were put in "tax and fees" . I lived less than a mile from the BWW.  No way.  those deliver apps are a rip off now.
1. This whole system runs on tipping culture. I strongly encourage people not to tip at all, so that these food services has to pay more to their delivery personals.  2. Restaurants who do not want to be a part of food delivery should use warning stickers that says they are not responsible for any third party delivery services.  3. Though I like the idea of drunkards and stoned people not to drive and order food through delivery people, most shouldn't just call ahead, place the order and just pick it up in person.
I've delivered for uber eats before. Some things are completely out of your control and it completely sucks when it happens and the whole system sucks for that. I once got a negative review because a restaurant put an old customers' name as Don even though they transitioned and went by "Dawn". Somehow that was my fault. Also had a woman who gave me a negative review cos I didn't suck toes. Not even the worst of what I dealt with before I was banned from the app.
And why America is a shythole country. We have businesses that SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS! This is not the American Dream! We could afford the dream, before Circus Capitalism. And nothing says Loser more than a bunch of audience members whistling at Oliver claiming to be high....
Right now Doordash and Spark are my only income. The town I'm in is isolated and job scarce. I've seriously considered just begging for change after seeing 'spangers' sometimes make way more than me, and if I don't pull off a miracle tomorrow I will be because my phone will be cut off. Thanks Gig Pimps.
I get Door Dashers in my grocery store all the time. Ive noticed the dasgers have started getting  prompts to dispose of the receipt & not give them to customers.  ...that just seems really scummy to me
I used to order delivery until I realized that Doordash was playing a shell game. The menu prices on the delivery app were more expensive than the actual restaurant's website with a ridicously low delivery fee. No, charge me a delivery fee for what it actually costs to deliver and don't charge the restaurant anything. I wish there was a food delivery app that did that. Restaurants would be signing on right and left to an app like that and they would drop the current delivery apps.
As a user of THC since the 90's food delivery people are my heroes 😂❤
Wow. I am so glad I have never used any of these services. I have never understood the logic behind paying $25 for $15 worth of food. I just never bought into getting "fast food" via delivery. Delivery is for pizzas or maybe nearby Chinese spots.
I have never used a delivery app.: no reason to. Oh, wait, I am not GenZ and too f***ing lazy to do basically anything physical.
I stopped using all of these delivery services because of harassment. This guy brought me my food and asked me if I was home alone. Then he was in my driveway asking me can he take me out. I ended up going to court getting a restraining order and the company did nothing about it.
I wish this still aired Sunday night like it used to. I always looked forward to watching this as the sprinkles on the top of my week!
I mean, sure, the consumer gets the best deal, but you're still paying way more to have it delivered than just going to get it yourself. I can bike to Wienerschnitzel and spend $5 on a chili cheese dog, or I can order it and pay $20 plus I need to tip. I honestly see it as a no-winners situation
There is a whole genocide going on and they are talking about ... delivery apps? They are falling off so hard .
He could have gone 10 more minutes and discussed how fucked up the cars get… new tires.. new everything & all parts are expensive!!
I had an unexpected medical emergency last May and I got home after a week in the hospital to recover from surgery with no help and I was barely mobile because I was healing but also because my heart was still enlarged. I had left in an ambulance and came home to only a few food options. I couldn't go grocery shopping or even put them away or cook anything if I had much at home. I used Doordash and Grubhub a few times when I could get what was a fairly decent deal and free delivery. I obviously knew the price was a lot more than what the restaurants charged in many cases. Without free delivery or a deal, the price was almost double the price of what it would cost if I went to the drive thru or the restaurant. It made me physically ill. I felt like it was a hostage situation. I only placed two more orders and it took a lot to hit that button to place the order because I knew I was getting so screwed. I will NEVER use those apps ever again! Sure it's convenient but I can't afford double the price!
can u do one on pet walker apps
Imagine getting off your ass and picking up your own food, instead of complaining about Grubhub (which loses money every year so you don't have to tie the string on your sweatpants and put on a pair of flip flops).  The amount of whining in this episode is off the charts, even for JO.  He even "went there" on student loans, gloriously (albeit briefly) leaping to the defense of people who spent 400 grand on an education that, ironically, only qualifies them to work for Grubhub.
Banning tipping will not make food prices go up. It will show the actual price of the food and the costs of the company making the food. While working to ban tipping, you should continue to tip, since it isn't your waiter's/driver's fault that the system is how it is.
I had a terrible experience from a delivery person about 2 months ago.  When he arrived, he asked if I would tip after he left.  I literally always do unless there is a glaring problem, I feel bad for these workers.  I said, "yes".  Then he told me he could see my wallet.  It was sitting on the kitchen counter near the door.  Mind you, I live in a very small apartment, I'm not rich.  He put his foot into the doorway so I couldn't shut the door and said, "Go get your wallet".  He asked for a cash tip, and I pulled out $5, which was actually a pretty standard tip for what I got.  He said, "I see more money, give it to me" while he started pushing into the doorway.  I initially said no, but he kept forcing his way further and further into my apartment.  It was to the point where he might be able to close the door behind him and physically be in my apartment.  He never broke eye contact, and I was terrified.  I gave him all my money, and he left.  When I reported him to the app, all they said was, "We will flag him so that he doesn't deliver to you anymore."  I'm grateful for that, but I'm scared for anyone else he delivered to.  All that being said, I actually don't fault him that much.  He was desperate because of what these apps do to their delivery employees.  I didn't report it to the police because part of me felt really bad for him.  The system is beyond broken.
Local Papa Johns stopped hiring delivery drivers and switched to just using Door Dash, instead. After a couple of deliveries I just stopped ordering from them altogether. The first time I didn't realize they had made that switch. The 2nd time, I didn't realize the switch was permanent rather than simply the result of a staffing shortage. I had absolutely no interest in delivery through these services. Based off the additional stuff I've learned from this segment, I am glad I noped out.
watching this stoned eating doordash
There is no love in the "gig economy" ,  late stage capitalism blows...
Never used them, never will. Massive con job rip offs. Also, F*** TIPPING CULTURE!  Sorry. I don't tip. It's not my responsibility to pay your wages. Also, F*** the guy who thinks the customers are the ones coming out on top. What a delusional moron.
I refuse to use DoorDash ever again. I used it one time and they forgot part of my order and didn't give a shit. Never again. I would much rather get in my car and drive.
Sorry, I generally don't tip and I've never used a delivery app in my life. The people who work for those companies apparently missed basic math in elementary school.  But then, I don't eat out either. Frankly I wouldn't notice when most restaurants would silently go away. We eat out for the few special occasions in a year - so about 3 to 5 times. At that point it doesn't matter what it costs as long as it's a great experience and we don't go to places that do home delivery of any kind. I'm not surprised people claim they will never afford a house: if you are willing to spend $30+ on a meal delivered to your door lukewarm, you don't deserve a house. Tipping is simply subsidizing a exploitative business model. Why should the customer pay the staff directly? Why is this not a thing in other countries? Ahh, right, in other countries businesses actually have to pay their employees a half way decent wage with benefits. In the US you can hire someone, pay them $2.30 an hour and tell them to make their money on tips by asking customers to pay extra. Strangely restaurants are considerably more expensive in the US than they are i.e. in Europe - where employees not only get a basic wage but also have benefits like healthcare.
I would argue it's time we made tipping obsolete.  Not only is it ridiculous that workers are doing their job for an unreliable income, but even fully automated vending machines are requesting tips.  The whole gig economy is propped up by the philosophy that everything is meant to be unpredictable (excuse me... "flexible"), and that just ramps up the opportunities for exploitation.  Mandate reliable wages, and these businesses will HAVE to rely on market viability rather than corruption and stupid games.
I'm one of those weirdos who prefers to drive to the restaurant, eat my meal there, have a friendly chat with my server, and leave them a 20% tip. What the hell is wrong with me?
19:34
I also hated that the app drivers got the entire tip. Every app order that happened on a busy night. just dwindled down our overall tip out at the end of the night. We as a crew called them vultures. I get it we all have to work. But f corporations that pit service workers against each other. For a tip.
I'm not usually the guy who "cancels" stuff from a YouTube video, but yeah, I'm done with them. Doordash, UberEats.... Just order from your local pizza shop like it used to be.
1. Screw tipping culture, needs to be abolished. It's archaic and other places in the world do just fine without it 2. Not all jobs are meant to provide a "living wage" supplemental jobs are a real phenomenon and should be forgotten 3. You really think making food delivery a FTE type job instead of gig work is going to help people at large??? Thousands upon thousands of people will lose to opportunity to do that type of work because the barrier to entry will raise drastically, as opposed to basically anyone that move and understand direction now. (Bonus #4) Screw bicycles! Why the hell would I want my hot food delivered in objectively one of the slowest methods possible by choice!? I always get mad when I find out my food was delivered by a cyclist. I want my food delivered by a method capable of more than 1 horsepower.
Delivery driver here: prop 22 is a good thing. It ensures $18 an hour plus about 60 cents a mile. I can an adjustment every week for the difference, usually 100-150 Dollars.
I beg to differ, it's not saving money to use any of those apps around here. It regularly costs as much in fees and tip /EVEN/ /IF/ /YOU/ /HAVE/ /THEIR/ /PREMIUM/ /DISCOUNTS/ as it does for the food you're ordering.
You know, I just don't use any of the third party services, I refuse to do it...I know how drivers are getting screwed from wages and benefits of any kind, , and I'm getting screwed from increased prices as well, So, if I don't have something to cook, I stop on the way home and pick the food up myself, ( just like we USED to do before 2020 ) but I'm lucky that I live within 5-10 minutes from most restraraunts or the grocery store or fast food. ALOT of people lookup whatever restaraunt and get a third party menu thru whatever service, I can call directly to the place I want food from and yea they will take my order no problem...then I store the # in my phone...for next time. And yes I understand sometimes for people it is too much work to run around due to whatever life is throwing at you right now and if you need delivery it's there for you but pre 2020 most everyone was able to make it work.
As a gig worker that's worked for all of these companies for over 5 years this report barely scratched the surface of how bad and how low the pay is for these jobs. They missed so much I suspect they didn't even talk to any gig workers. They also focused on bike riders which is a small group that represents maybe 1% of us. I love the subject being talked about but good god do some ground work. This story is far bigger than it was just presented as.
My sister works as a delivery driver for Jimmy John's...definitely A LOT better than working for these guys.
"Hittin' that green" slayed me.
0:34 How can I be straight and still want to see what's on this menu, is it out of curiosity, or... _something else?_
Easy solution. Make your own food or order it and pick it up yourself.
How utterly depressing yet, as ever, maddingly entertaining.
They need to start kicking customer off. There are people who post all the time that they put in a tip then back it out after just to not pay because they are a-holes.
There aren't that many instances in life where doing the right thing is more clear cut than with tipping. We can all agree to hate the system, but to take it out on the workers is some weak stuff
Sometimes I am really grateful to live in a so-called “third world country “ cause we don’t use these services. We still call the restaurant and they use their own staff to deliver. And you still see a huge number of people eating at those same restaurants. There’s still a huge sense of community and togetherness
But how much are executives at these companies making? The money goes to pay insane money for the company to run.
I always see doordash and grubhub cards on many restaurants. if they take that much % why have em?
As a delivery driver, I actually reccommend you **don't** tip well up front. These apps pay almost nothing, and they are being subsidized by your generosity. They send out outrageously unprofitable orders, and only pay more than a dollar or two if the order gets turned down too many times. If you give a big tip, they will lump it in with someone else who didn't tip and ordered from super far away, and even if you gave $20 and live right across the street, the driver may still barely make any money on the entire order they were given. Keep your tip to a minimum, and it will increase in value a bit, and then you can make someone's day by increasing it later. This also protects you from "tipping" those people who grab your food, take a picture of it in your driveway, and then drive off with it, or just actively cause problems. Split the savings from not rewarding bad drivers with the good drivers.
Used to Uber Eats in Seattle before the minimum wage law, made about $8 per hour after paying for all the gas I had to use in my PRIUS.  After the minimum wage law, I made about $13, because you only got paid for the time you had the order in your vehicle.  All of this before paying income taxes. And Car insurance. And luxuries like medicine, food, and rent.
Considering how much everything costs, it doesn't feel like we are the ones "winning" out of everyone.  Edit: And of course workers rights should be the forefront of this as well. It's baffling and should be criminal how people are being treated.
A word about the star rating models, if you rate any thing other than 5 stars the company will ether mark it as a bad rating of just toss it out altogether.  I was still working when this shit started. I was talking to one of the operators and the corporate manager and both told me that was how it worked and why we the pharmacy technicians had to basically beg customers to give us 5 stars. We hated doing it and the customers hated listening to it so much some would say they were going to give the lowest rating.
I don't understand how this got so bad. My heart breaks for the drivers and the restaurateurs who may or not make anything. Good reporting John.
My husband only had one speeding ticket in his life and one moving violation ticket.  Both happened when he was a teenager trying to drive to meet Domino's expectations.
In many big cities in US, such as in NY, delivery is done by illegal immigrants, who shouldn’t be working in US as they don’t have work permits.. many of them not even speak English.. watch the Telemundo interview piece in the segment..
Im sorry am disabled senior with no car . Some times i just cant afford to tip ..ssdi barely pays my rent. Workers should be paid more
I kinda feel bad now because I opened youtube tonight  looking for something to watch while I eat the meal a kind dasher just dropped for me... I did tip and I almost always give 5 stars to the delivery person; and I won't say I didn't know about the harsh conditions they face (though I didn't know about the cost to restaurants but it does make sense now). It is just hard to pass the convenience of this service despite all that, especially for someone as introverted as myself.
I have to disagree with "sneezing on the milkshake." Sometimes the French Fries may fall on the ground but it's not so dirty in my town so I throw them back in. Most people don't mind. KIDDING KIDDING! I deliver for Door Dash so I can attest to the fact that every delivery is taped or stapled shut. Sometimes the pungent odors linger in my car for a day or so, but otherwise I have no relationship with the food I deliver.The only way a driver can make money is to drive 24/7 and find someone to pay for their gasoline.
We shouldn't have to tip period end of story. Pay the workers more. Why is it that every other country figured that out but us?
Tipping more as a rule on these apps is EXACTLY what they want us to do.  This is the problem with bars and restaurants all over again.  Force the food delivery companies to pay a fair share to the delivery worker.
Is it the same in Europe?
Once ny Uber driver picked me up *two days after she got her fallopian tubes removed.*
Know what's annoying?  My house is very close to the driveway of one of these food delivery drivers.  And she tends to slam her house  door and car door when she gets in and out.  Through the day and much of the night.😭
Can't pay me to use these things
I grew in Mississippi listening to "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," and I always thought the devil's set was better.
I thought you were going to talk about World Central Kitchen delivery food! 👀
US tipping problem has become over the top. Especially for someone who’s not American, expecting them to know that you’re supposed to tip 200% when in the US is just f’d up
It’s hilarious to me that the customers are considered the winners in this by paying $27 for a meal that would cost 6 bucks just by driving a few minutes down the road
There is a huge negative for restaurant workers too. I am a bartender, where I work, after 8pm the "to go" worker leaves and the bartender takes over that role. We make no tips from delivery services and it takes us away from taking care of our patrons. This absolutely takes away from our tips from OUR patrons because we have to go to the kitchen, box up the orders, and pass them over. This makes it look like we are ignoring our patrons, we can't talk up our bar guests and give them the service they expect. We get nothing from Uber and Doordash, I hate it so much.
Half of these drivers can't read. Should the company be responsible for that or should I work 15 hours a day and have to go ask my idiot neighbors for food?😊
Another side of this situation is that since the apps have made getting food much easier, ordering food on these apps can become a compulsive behavior. Feeling stressed out? Order a slice of cake. Argued with your family? Buy a meal.
when i get uber eats i make sure to hand the driver cash on top of their tip given through the app. I wish I could do more for the restaurant..
I'm glad no one's livelihood depends on my tips in my country, it's a toxic practice from the start that only exploiters are capable of and if that's the only reason the American economy is the way it is, it's not worth it.
I just cook. Am i doing it wrong?
Tip in cash
The tipping culture in the US is a joke. It should not be our responsibility to make sure the workers get a decent wage it's their boss's responsibility to pay them not us. And if the delivery drivers don't like the way that is, they can look for other jobs.
Uber has Uber Freight now smh
all the fancy tech, yet ultimately most business models - high tech, disruptor start up or Walmart, etc., are literally still modeled after capitalizing on and exploiting enslaved, inadequately compensated humans. Detached CEOs who think people start orphanages for fun have no idea how exorbitant rental costs are and how they themselves are responsible for pricing people out.  to recap - they're all plantations taking on an alternative guise.
Man, I stopped using any food delivery after 15 dollars of food started costing 30 to make it to me. Cheaper to cook anyway. (To say nothing of the moral bankruptcy of most of these companies.)
Ok but you can't say your business model isn't profitable, when you can afford to throw 200 million dollars at the state of California. Those two things don't go together.
I shop for Shipt in California and they went HARD into the propaganda with prop22. They made it seem like such a good thing that we're getting "guaranteed minimum pay" which is true, but we could've had proper employee protections and a union.
the corporations should pay more
Just wanna add, that we still should continue to remember disabled people in this conversation. We use food delivery a lot too, and are generally more at risk for illness than the rest of the general population.
Most of us don't come out that much ahead in the bargain. Yeah, it's convenient, but the fees are already so high that it's barely worth it - unless you're stuck in the house. If these companies aren't turning a profit they're either incompetent, or - much more likely - they've decided to cook their books to make it that way.
TRUMP 2024!!! 🇺🇸
With all due respect to the poor delivery drivers on these apps, I've started using this lovely new delivery service called FIIGIM (Fuck It, I'll Get It Myself).
i guess it's worth to call the restaurants... or at least use their own website
I've never used a delivery app,  and now all the reasons I thought why I shouldn't are true!
Same thing for Amazon Flex. Granted youre not traveling to do a pick up between deliveries or getting tips. But you have to deal with similar situations. Even if there was a situation which was out your control, they lower your standing. Plus they trick you into delivering extra packages and say you will be compensated which actually will not happen. Then they pretend that it did not happen. I thought i was the only one but i was shocked when i found out online that many others dealt with the same crap. Its like those driver support are trained to do this.🤔
I have never used a delivery app. Installing a V-8 into my work truck now. Because no one touches my truck. You think ima let some brat touch my food? Lamo
"...tell me you're not having waaay more fun listening to the devil...happy easter btw" 🤣
11:44 I just paused the video and listened to devil went down to Georgia. I completely agree with John. I was rocking out in the car harder to the devil's part then Johnny's.
Anytime I order delivery I always tip. I always tip anytime I eat in a restaurant. Not doing so is anathema to me. The only time I’ll consider not tipping is if I’m doing carry out and even then I mostly do.
No way to make money delivering a product that only costs a few dollars. Not without more than doubling the cost paid for the product.
I did DoorDash, uber eats and shipt from 2021, 2022 and until December 2023.  The apps are dead now , and not even worth it. I'm a full time college student, and was able to put less miles on my car, and make some serious cash (part time work $32,000 a year ) but it's a single one time thing, plus a huge gamble, car wrecks could have happened ect....its not a career. If these apps disappeared tomorrow I'd be okay with it.
Also if you use these apps amd you don't tip you're literally evil.
I always tip based on how much work I made them do, plus whatever extra cents rounds the total up to the nearest whole dollar. But I've only ordered delivery through a third-party app once, and that was literally in Mexico. I always try to order through the restaurant's actual website or app, or failing that via a phone call, because it's the best way to make sure I have the most up-to-date info on product availability.
John I usually agree with you in 99% of your videos, but hell no, I’m not tipping. Tip culture is out of hand. It’s not my job to pay these delivery drivers, that’s why they working with grubhub, put the blame on grub hub not the customers for low wages
Just cook some chicken and rice at home and save money.
I doordash full time because the job market around me is a garbage fire and it sucks seeing how much they take from the businesses and the customers cuz yall we don't see any of it, they literally just lowered the base pay by .50 a couple months ago
4:55 Me right now: 👴
3out of 4 gig workers pay for there own insurance & the 4th probably has Medicaid
I drive for these apps ever since i got laid off and goddamn its a terrible deal for everyone involved other than the owners
Never used a delivery service, ill call and go myself
You also can't spell Chipotle without e coli, but that's not why I'm here. I am a single dad who used to have a career in TV operations before streaming channels (like Max, for example!) killed off my industry. I now rely on a couple of "hustles" to raise my son here in California, but the lion's share of my income is from food delivery apps. Here's the thing: these companies have found a way to outsource American jobs TO American workers, sidestepping all labor protections, min wage requirements, etc. AB5 would've given us employee protections, and that is why, according to ballotpedia, the gig app companies actually spent way more to get Prop 22 passed than reported here, to the tune of $250,000,000.00! And while I applaud LWT for bringing some attention to the tip issue, there is an anti "tipping culture" movement out there based on a wholly erroneous perception that app drivers get paid an hourly wage by the companies. We do not! Before tip, a delivery of 5 miles or so pays roughly $3.50. Keeping in mind that gas is $5.15/gal, consider the cost to drive that 5 miles, then 5 miles back home, plus the cost of insurance, expenses that pop up all the time like tires, wear and tear, etc, in a car that gets roughly 20 MPG. There have been times that I have delivered food to rich people (who often don't tip as well as those stoners who are absolutely STOKED that you brought them tacos from Jack In The Box at 3 AM) and literally PAID for the privilege! So if you want to be a truly decent human being when using food delivery apps, tip your driver based on that information instead of calculating based on the size of your order, or the perceived value the app provides. And always tip extra for booze! Think of how much a DUI would cost you. ☮💙
Imagine being that person that lives on Roosevelt Island and seeing this
If you're just picking up the food yourself always order directly through the restaurant. Call or use their website that likely has an ordering system that's not an app
Dude. I'm  a grill cook at Chili's. Our location is the busiest in the city, and it is definitely slamming. HALF of our business or more, in a place where the dining room almost stays full, is doordash. If you aren't a monster cook (I've been at it 45 years) you will wash out, on that grill. That's great for Brinker (parent company), but its a challenge for us.
Dude..i was ABOUT to order a nacho bell grande and 2 chalupas for 27 DOLLARS...NOOOOOO!
I do not understand why it is so hard to understand that modern capitalism is just a turbo-charged system to exploit society for the benefit of very view people. This story just one solitery example. If you want to stop to enslave yourself and get screwed over and over and over, you need to wake up, use your brain and change that very system that is destroying you. Start by voting for people who really want to change the system.
As an amazon delivery driver *SO MUCH* of this is applicable to us as well. Tyranny of the Algorithm, indeed.
Delivery apps / companies completely suck. Will not give them business.  The same with grocery deliveries like horrible Instacart.
My part for helping my local restaurants... There are about half a dozen restaurants I typically order from. All are family establishments of different cuisines (Greek, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, and a deli). Each one greets me by name when I call them. I either pick up the food on my way home from work, or just get out of the house to stretch my legs and get the food. Pay cash so they avoid unnecessary credit card fees. There is something to be said about actually having a relationship with people making your food instead of dealing with an app. In some of those places, the people working there are the owners kids that I used to see hanging around and doing homework at the restaurants 20 years ago. Now they are taking over as the parents are getting their hard earned rest.  Yes I know... I'm shaking my fist at the sky here. But to the next generation, if you are reading... spend some time at a family run restaurant. Get to know them and appreciate them. No app will ever give you the sense of acceptance that personal relationship in the service sector can provide. If that doesn't convince you, then consider that the restaurant will toss in a few extra fries with your order if they know you. On the other hand, your Grubhub driver may be eating a few of your fries on their way to your house. The choice is yours.
ALWAYS tip your delivery person because it's not a hobby.................also, you're basically the only person who's paying them.
Great journalism as always, with a funny ass twist
20:40 No they didn’t Uber and Lyft are still cheap in my area, only $9 per ride
Relevant to smoking weed and delivery drivers. I wish more of them knew that smoking (weed or tobacco) while delivering food makes the food reek. Not only is it easy to tell that that's what the driver was doing (not good practice for food service), it can also make the food and drinks very unappetizing. Even bagged food and covered drinks can still be very noticeably affected.
The extra fees have already made us rule out the apps completely.
Tip more. Its great until we realize it is going into the apps and not the drivers.
A Door Dash delivery person went into the restaurant I'd ordered food from, got seated, *had a meal* - while *MY* food sat on the counter, getting cold. After I called DD about why my food hadn't been delivered yet (over an hour), Door Dash had to get some other driver to pick up my order. I ended up getting my food for free, but damn.
Why did this air too late ?
Having a band of deamons join into a fiddle contest sounds like cheating.
Now I understand why the fast food prices are going through the roof everywhere. We're subsidizing these cocksuckers.
My hommie johny fucking blazing it while on the clock hits home reall fucking hard. been there. done that. XD XO<3 Xp
FTC where u at?
Vote with your wallet.  When you are hungry.  Ignorant of the side hustle perpetuated by your endless NEED.
HUMANS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO GO TO THE GODDAMN GROCERY STORE AND COOK EASY TASTY HEALTHY MEALS. Our society is innovating and maximizing for the WRONG things because wealthy people who want more money will do anything to convince you that the way they can skim off of the most is the best for you. Imagine if every mediocre chain restaurant worker, gig economy worker, and app hawk devoted their energies to projects to revitalize crumbling infrastructure, bring communities together, reduce the average workday, support the needy, pursue their actual interests and passions.  The only thing keeping us from a Star Trek future is capitalism and its replacements not being fully tested and invested in yet.
I delivered for GrubHub all thru the pandemic in Lawton, Oklahoma. I dreamed of going back. Then I heard of a grandma and her grandson who were delivering when they were mistaken for someone and the grandson was shot in the head. 😢 After that I thought it too unsafe.
Cool and all but you should cover project 2025. Elections are looming over and if Trump wins that's America's future.
Don't tip. The USA is the only country in the world with this stupid system. Just don't do it and it will go away
The ratings system for humans is in corporate as well. I worked as a contractor for a large education corporation training teachers on a product, and after my trainings, the teachers had to 😂essentially rate my performance. I’ve gotten negative reviews before just because the teacher didn’t want to be at a training on a Saturday. It’s a messed up system.
This video was a long time coming. Back before 2019 I was on the restaurant side of this exchange and I used to be pissed when ever a grub hub driver came in and placed an order for a customer. They'd shove their phone over the counter at you and make you read your own broken menu in what ever format of ordering they assigned, and then of course there would be no tip (the main incentive to working carry out at a fancy taco bar). I started getting very creative in the ways I would fight back against the industry. I would give out extra long wait times and intentionally delay orders from going out to these guys so that customers would stop ordering it to go. . . Now in 2024 I am currently living this lifestyle, doing delivery work for these apps. I understand that my anger was misplaced, and I shouldn't have taken it out on the drivers and customers, but I still recognize the damage these apps do to earnings made in restaurants. I focus hard on trying to make my pickups as seamless and disruption free as I can for these in house folks.   What's unfortunate is that I am dying for a way out now.  I lost a job over a year ago and have been in a downward financial spiral ever since. Delivering for Uber/Doordash/Shipt is not able to keep me afloat with the amount that needs to go back into the car and my bills. Slowly sinking has been harsh, but nothing is harsher than what it does to my family watching me struggle and still slowly go under. . . I hope and work daily for a way out and hope I'll find it soon. Maybe once I get a degree in HVAC I'll be able to land a solid well paying job. It just doesn't help me get my ends met that are due now.
It’s a microcosm of the direction most of our economy has been taking for the last 40 years. It’s a business model that is literally good for nobody except a handful of executives and the initial venture capitalists. Everyone else gets the shaft, the drivers, the restaurants, the customers paying out the ass for a, by definition, subpar product, and all of the public shareholders. Literally no realistic path to profitability.
They dropped the cut version on Thursday and a full version on Sunday? Wtf
Sorry. If a delivery driver can't be bothered to bring the food the right street, let alone the right house, I will not be giving them a pass and rating them 5 stars. I've had that happen more than once in the last decade.
They all know how to make money but no one would pay for delivery by these companies if they had to pay what it really costs to run these companies.  The whole business model is a lie.
Didn't think John would be _literally_ playing devil's advocate, but here we are
The peaches joke didn’t get enough love 😢
Another Oliver win.  Essential viewing.
I clicked on this right after ordering from postmates fully prepared to increase my regret
100% honest McDonald was the backer of Chipotle. So the impact of their influence and where we are now with them isn't a large step. Price increases, low quality. And add a delivery charge on top. Think about it.
Two things I'm sick and tired of. Tipping culture and independent contractors. I just want service workers to be paid an appropriate wage so the company doesn't have to fucking guilt trip me into subsidizing their workers' income; especially after lobbying 184 million dollars into providing them with less. Just tell me how much sum'n costs and I'll pay it if it's worth it to me. As always, tipping should be for going above and beyond, not a part of someone's expected income.  The independent contractor thing is deeper than just the service industry, but kind of has the same effect. A company needs work done, but they'd rather not bring an employee on and share in company benefits and protections. So they end up paying a small amount more in salary for that extra to be easily taken in independent insurance, taxes and equipment needed to do the job. And it's much easier to "terminate" a contractor at almost any time and makes unionization practically impossible.  It's a pipedream, but I'd love if people were just paid what they're worth. More like an infancy of Capitalism rather than the malignant late-stage crap we're in now.
As a person who delivers for GH, thank you John!!
It's called "consolidation"; Strengthen governments and corporations, weaken individuals.
My favorite is when a clueless CEO tells us how their lowest paid workers feel, instead of showing us a testimonial from one of their actual workers.  EDIT: I loved this video. Thanks guys!
I was hoping for an explanation of their fees. Delivery fee + Convenience fee + Tip.  If I pay the delivery person a "delivery" fee, it seems a tip isn't needed.  If the delivery fee doesn't go to the delivery person, what does it go for? Paying for gas or the bike and backpack? Nope. The convenience of delivery?  Is that a convenient fee for the app? I would never pay that much money for using an app, particularly a "free app."  I've ordered pizzas that more than double in price when the delivery, convenience, taxes, and tip are all added on.  I don't mind paying for something when I know what I'm getting. Yet these companies know they're purposefully misleading.  "Free delivery," [except for the convenience fee and tip].
It’s the media companies who take in the advertising revenue who are the beneficiaries, not the customers.  These delivery companies spend way too much on advertising to be profitable. At some point they will start slashing their ad budgets.
Gee wonder what the percentage would be if they just hired people to work...
Who's still watches ads? Only time I watch ads is when I'm YouTubeing funny ads
Dang it, John. I'd watch Phantom Boss.
how is usa considered democracy if the rich are ruling not the majority of people?
No, do not check to see if you are tipping people. Stop with your american stupid tipping culture. If you are rich and have money to burn I guess go ahead, anyone else middle class and  below, do not.
Oh dear... Those orphanages might now become a real thing.
"We have replaced the tyranny of the boss with the tyranny of the algorithm" is an amazing summation of the issue from Prayag
reliance on tipping culture is absurd... pay a fair wage !
As a server by trade, I hate delivery apps. I have worked at places that subscribe to all 5. Also it steps on my pay because the food comes out late to people actually eating in the restaurant. I ginally found a place that doesn't do any deliveries  pick up only. :) I love it.
Sorry HBO, I torrented the episode days ago
Wow I’ve never thought of food delivery apps as like payday loans. It seems like they can help ppl in a bind but it might ultimately be a net negative for everyone
The board and employees of the delivery companies are actually winning. They all get paid a crazy wage just to make the app a little more flashy, while the board burns investor money, and the customer gets shafted with $20 bill for $10 meal. The companies are IRRESPONSIBLE that's why they're unprofitable.
These apps are terrible.  The upcharge is outrageous.  This just must make your food bill so much more expensive than it needs to be.
I'm old school.  I REFUSE to use these apps.  I knew something was wrong about them.  But, I live in a city & don't mind walking or ordering directly from a restaurant if they deliver.  PS.  Most still do if you call them direct.
I felt John Oliver was really trying but just wasn't his day to be funny
Shout out to food!
its a great deal... and yet Its still way too expensive. Not worth it. I have not ordered it in years and will keep it that way
Are used to work for DoorDash and I used to smoke cigars in my car all the time while I was delivering your food😊
Thanks, I had no idea they did that much damage. I will be deleting ubereats and doordash apps now!
OMG I always thought the Devil’s music was way better, even when I was a kid.
the 184 milly horse KILLED ME 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I ordered Pizza Hut through their website but my food was delivered by a food app gig worker who called me and to,d me to come find him because he was lost a block away.  I tipped when I placed the order, but I would have given him a lot less if I knew I’d have to go hunt my pizza down myself.  I wanted to avoid having to leave the office so I could still answer the phones.  Pick up would have been easier.
Completing 2000+ deliveries for my robot overlords DD, UE & GH in the northeast has given me a whole new respect for mail carriers, package delivery drivers, garbage collectors and anyone else who works tirelessly and silently to bring you stuff and remove stuff you don’t want.  Leave your lights on, plow your driveway, clear your walkway, help them find your house when they are lost by answering your phone. Acknowledge that human beings, not drones, not self-driving cars, not conveyor belt pipelines directly from Taco Bell (not yet), deliver your food. If you see a human in your driveway, do unto others.   Thanks and enjoy your plant-based Meximelt and cold-pressed dandelion juice!   Side note: Debate tip culture all you want. Without a tip, your order will not be picked up.
I am always amazed at John Oliver's ability to sustain a high level of sustained incredulity throughout his broadcast.  THAT is a gift.
As a person who uses a lot of Uber Eats, I can honestly say it's one of the best food apps out there and we should appreciate the food delivery workers for how they deliver t Our food for us. Be nice. Be courteous to your drivers and always tip them if you can.
God damn it im so torn
Software engineers are the other winners besides the app users.
I worked for a food delivery service in college in 1999 that worked like DoorDash (we had contracts for about 30 restaurants and used FCC-licensed radios and a dispatcher). I learned there are some specific rules that can make this type of service business profitable. #1 Every delivery had a set fee for delivery - $3 no matter what (100% of that went to the driver)  #2 Specific delivery area - if you were outside of the very well defined delivery area for a chosen restaurant, you couldn't order. #3 Drivers were expected to double check the order at the restaurant to make sure all items were in the bag. #4 Tips were chosen and added by the customer upon delivery, not in advance (all of the tip went to the driver).  #5 You needed a vehicle to do deliveries - not a bicycle or scooter.
Fu** tipping. its the dumbest thing next to a trump argument. Americans should be willing to pay a FAIR wages. NO ONE should rely on tips. Tips are charity... its appalling some people are encouraging charity over fair wages.. thanks John!
I drive for two of the three big apps to supplement my income. The *only* way it’s practical is because I live near (not in, but near) a very, very wealthy area where people have lots of money to throw around and tip 30-40%, sometimes more. Otherwise, I’d be screwed.
One thing not mentioned is how cutthroat the ratings are. I worked for Shipt for several years. I your score fell below a 4.8/5 you would get "fired" for not meeting performance expectations. You might think a 4 star is fair but in any star ratings platform it's a death sentence.
I heard a great tip long ago.  If you pay for your food with credit card, or cash, you can always then tip in cash.  This solves the 'misclick' problem John mentioned.  (Even if the employee gets the full tip, which I'm not sure is the case, handing them cash is instant money in their pockets.)
One is tipping for another human being to use their time, energy/health and or GAS to bring one, (Lazy or impaired) food. tipping culture at, lets say starbucks for someone to pour coffee into a cup is ridiculous for a mega corporation not to pay their Contracted Employees a living wage where tipping isn't necessary. it is the Company's fault. but not tipping only hurts the little guy.
Yea! How the f did Skype drop the ball so bad! They must have zoomed out and weren’t a team player
My brother owns a restaurant, I never use these ap’s
22:13 i like that. "millennial" has three ls for a reason.
It’s actually easy to NOT use these apps based upon the extra costs and fees.
Instacart wasn't mentioned, are they categorized differently?
This is the Amazon thing.  How can this item be cheaper than at the store AND arrive faster than other methods?  Something's gotta give.  Sad that it's the delivery ppl themselves.
I disagree on having to tip. It’s gotten out of hand.
If someone is delivering in bad weather that’s because they want to— they’re not required to. So, there’s nothing wrong with that.
It was really nice to have Door Dash deliver food and groceries once in a while, as I recovered from 2 major surgeries.  I am recovered now,  and can drive to pick up my own single piece of cake, so I am deleting my account after watching this story.
I wish you were on the Supreme Court.
I only deliver for those apps when I need to steal a meal for the kids
Just throwing this out there... Ive tried 10 different times to use a food delivery app since the rise of, well, food delivery apps. Usually because im at work and cant leave for whatever reason, shit happens, you know? Yeah, not one single time have i ever actually received my food. The last and final time, i called the driver and this fking mook tried to play stupid by acting like he didnt understand English...well i happen to be fluent in Spanish so i apologized and started speaking in Spanish. He hung up and wouldnt answer again.  It has been a LONG time since ive felt a rage quite like that. I was really ready to go to jail about it.  Anyway, i did end up getting a refund (fking better) and a free replacement order that i picked up myself, but jeezus shit, how bad can people get at such a basic job? Another time, during the pandemic when we werent even allowed to go into restaurants (fking STUPID, but thats a whole other conversation) a driver delivered my order A.) to the place, B.) two and a half hours late, and C.) on the ground, where a bunch of crows had already gotten to it by the time they bothered to let me know. I received neither a refund nor a replacement fpr this, not even an apology because the driver had technically made the delivery.  Technically.   So until there are some kind of real, actual consequences for this kind of behavior, delivery apps can collectively turn around, kick the air and literally fuck their own faces.
👍🤘🖖
When did you get commercials?
tipping culture has become predatory. I should be responsible for paying for a service that i use and its the company's responsibility to pay its workers. I do not feel that i should pay an additional 20% for something i already agreed with a business for a commodity.
Fascinating insight into the harsh realities of food delivery apps. Sad to see both restaurant owners and delivery workers being exploited while the apps rake in profits. Truly underscores how consumers are often left in the dark. Let's hope for some effective regulations soon.
I've never used one of these apps, and I ~never~ will.  I just don't trust a gig worker to treat my food right or get it here before ice crystals or mold spores form on it.  If the restaurant doesn't employ their own delivery drivers, they don't get my business.  That pretty much limits me to the twice a year pizza delivery order to work when I don't feel like eating the lunch I brought.  Oh well.  It was nice when more than just the pizza places had their own drivers, like Subway and all the Chinese places.
This warmed my heart so much
I've not used food delivery apps, i much prefer just going in person, the closest i come in occasionally i'll order pizza from a pizza place, who has their own drivers, but that's only when i have people over, otherwise i'll just get it myself. We are 7 minutes into this episode and god damn that crowd is lively, so much excitement from jokes. I don't know if it's good or cringy? 21 minutes in, I remember a long time ago in the city south of me, I saw a truck driving around early 2010s maybe earlier, some one had the bright idea to go to places like mcdonalds or arbys on your behalf to pick up your food, before these big companies got really rolling. Just small local business, probably just a few guys and trucks. Always remembered it thought it was interesting, because it was to places that weren't Chinese food or pizza. Thought it was clever, now it's something else. I suppose that's everything though, how it starts.
I did uber for a few months, and honestly, it was not worth it. I want to say 90% of people don't tip. You have to work 9+ hours every day if you want decent earnings, and even then, you're really living paycheck to paycheck. Add the cost of getting gas basically every day, more frequent car maintenance, crazy amount of miles to your car, and rude customers. When I did my taxes and crunched the numbers, it showed I had more losses than profit.  Uber really was more like a way to survive the day to day, week to week. But it's just not a viable employment option in the long term.
I disagree with one thing in this video. NO, YOU SHOULDNT HAVE TO TIP.  A tip is an optional money for exceptional service and at the discretion of the client. People shouldn’t have to subsidize companies cause they don’t want to give their employees living wages. Or by massive companies avoiding paying living wages by hiring contractors.
Not sure I agree with the sentiment here. We don't need to tip more (if even at all, but that's a different conversation), they need to pay their workers more, instead of their C-Suite. I don't use these services anyway because I may end up paying nearly a hundred dollars for two meals and an appetizer, when I could save half of that by driving myself. Where is that money going if the driver loses, the restaurant loses, and somehow the delivery service loses? Where do they get $184 million dollars to lobby for a bill? Crocodile tears, and you are perpetuating a model where they are robbing everyone blind, and by your own admission, only plan to do so more once they have a monopoly.
John, this pandemic is NOT over. Please stop the pat-tensing of the ongoing viral death machine known as SARS-CoV-2.
How about America starts to get off their ass again and you go out and get your food! Or, pick it up on the way home. The over-reliance on conveniences like this show just how pathetic people have become! Never used these apps. I'm not lazy.
I'm impressed by whoever researched 184mil to come up with it equaling a racehorse.
There's nothing more stupid than tipping for work. It takes the responsibility out of the employer to pay the employees what they are worth. How about you pay the employees the full amount of what they are worth? Nobody tips a banker or a designer for work, why should we on restaurants? If they cant pay employees then they have a fucked up business model.
I have literally not ordered food delivery (no restaurants; no groceries; nothing) in at least ten years, and that was a few Dominos pizzas for my child's friends at sleepover.
Now I really know why I have NEVER used these food-delivery apps! 😮
Making these full time benefit jobs would be a disaster. I like making a extra $500 a week for just a couple hours after my main job. No boss to worry about and I can save money for trips or stupid things to buy.
I ordered food today and they didn’t give me the drink I ordered. The driver just didn’t leave it. :/
I did accounting for a company that specialized in restaurant accounting and I was floored at how much money the apps were taking from them. I’d log into GrubHub all the time and watch the rates climb and climb.
I’m sure these delivery applications will be punished by Congress that gets paid by said applications through lobbyists.
I don't blame John for glossing over it, but the biggest reason not to get into this line of work is wear and tear on your car. Owning and maintaining a car is EXPENSIVE. I'm an expert in personal budgeting and I wouldn't do the job if I was paid $30/hr. I'd rather just work retail and save a ton in car repair/maintenance/fuel/insurance costs.  And riding an ebike around a busy city all day with current medical costs!?HELL NO.  I really don't understand how this is an actual job field other than Americas lack all personal budgeting sense and are still falling for the America Dream.
lololol 30% cut, to not do anywork. Sounds borderline Racketeering to me  Grubhub gets to force business  against their will too. talk about big brother, yet the politicians aren't helping businesses like they claim they do. Or those conspiracy theorist  fighting this?
Cui Bono?
I once handled a door dash order valued at under 1 dollar at retail price for the item. Another order was for a customer that no joke lived directly across the street. That cake order is not surprising. Not affiliated with Door Dash.
My buddy got robbed at gunpoint from his food delivery guy two weeks ago
I’m an independent coffee shop owner. DoorDash kept us alive by the skin of our teeth through 2020. But since then, fees have skyrocketed, our store’s DoorDash financial report doesn’t make sense, and we lose money on every doordash order. Marking up delivery prices also gets you penalized by the doordash algorithm. They have dashers check your in-store menu pricing and report you if it doesn’t match.  My brother in law tried dashing for a few months. The app was broken half the time, the algorithm preferred more established dashers over him so he couldn’t even apply for the good tip runs, and the pay was crap.  We also fought GrubHub when they listed us without our permission. Finally got around their refusal to remove us by claiming our profile and promptly removing every single menu item and changing our hours to closed all the time.
Don’t tip. You’re already paying for the food now you’re paying for the food and the super rich food chain employees who they grossly under pay saving them millions.
It’s all making sense now why the DoorDash driver who turned in front of me and hit me on my bike was complaining about how it inconvenienced him
Yo that miss piggy joke was next level lol😂
Love you John!!!
I cant agree with hardly anything in this session. Im not obligated to give 5 stars for terrible service because the algorithm. I damn sure dont have to tip. Form a union that makes these companies be fair. Do not bleed me cause the restaurants or delivery services scape goat the paying of thier employees onto me.
Oo
Then don’t work there ???
I really miss restaurants having their own delivery employees. When I order delivery from a restaurant's own website and it shows up 3 hours later, cold as ice, from doordash.... I'm pretty dang pissed! I've stopped ordering delivery now, and keep frozen entrees in the fridge for when I want pizza or Chinese or something.
Bullshit the companies aren’t making money. The food cost 3x as much as it does if I went to pick it up myself.
Happy Easter, by the way! Respect, sir. ❤
Food delivery in Japan is rough too. People living in inhuman conditions getting paid crap and penalized for even one minute late.
I feel so fucking vindicated.
I tried Grub Hub once and never again.  The added cost's were ridiculous.
been saying this for years!!!
John forgot to mention the tax consequence for the people doing deliveries. Because they are self employed that means they have to pay self employment tax on their profits which is 15%. Say that after expenses are taken the net profit is $15,000. The self employment tax on that is $2,250 on top of regular income tax from other sources of income like a W-2 job. I don't think many delivery drivers have that money to pay for taxes and many of them are not even aware of self employment tax.
Yeah although I had a full-time job where I needed extra income and signed up for Doordash....I quit after 2 days. Much shittier than the shit job I have now.  Not worth it especially with a 10 year old car.  Edit: I'd like to add that I've never used a delivery service myself, as I've seen it takes very little effort to pick it up yourself
DoorDash (DoorTrash) is awash with delivery offers like, 2 deliveries to 2 separate customers from 1 restaurant for a total of 5.5 miles and $2.75 pay.   It’s like this because consumers don’t want to pay the cost for delivery because they think that the food’s profit margin can absorb the delivery cost, and because there are drivers dumb enough to accept such orders and not force DoorDash to pay more by declining these orders and forcing the app to pay more or cancel the order.  Drivers declining unprofitable deliveries eschews all of the acceptance rate games that these apps play and gives the app two choices, raise the pay or cancel the offer.
Plus, there are now fake restaurants popping up on the apps, with some of the worst AI generated food pictures I have ever seen.
Admittedly I'm not entirely sure where the head of Door Dash lives, but assuming it's the United States, he should know that orphanages haven't  been active or legal for decades
The devil cheated in the devil went down to Georgia. He had a backing band. Clear violation of a one on one contest.
"This is a scam, but make sure to use it because they're also holding a whole class level hostage", what a hero
Is it just me or is this the first time seeing an ad before Last Week Tonight?
DoorDash hides the full amount you'll be getting on every order, because they don't want you to "cherry pick." So there was an app called Para that had figured out their code and created something that showed you the full amount of each order. It was AMAZING. ....And then DoorDash was like "lol fuck u guys, ur not allowed to see who's not tipping" and changed their code so that Para no longer works. I mean, the app still exists, and maybe it works for some folks, but "here's what we THINK you'll be getting" just isn't worth keeping an app on my phone.  I wholeheartedly believe that these apps, restaurants, and all places where tips are expected, should start paying their workers living wages. That said, delivering food is far more labor/time intensive than bringing plates out from the back (and having said that, you servers out there, I'm not belittling you. But you have to agree there IS a huge difference). There's no way in hell I'm willingly delivering food to someone who's not going to tip, when I'm only getting $3 for it. Factoring in gas and car maintenance, I'd be paying the customer to deliver their food, and if your ass is gonna be that stingy, you can go the 10 miles yourself to get that cantina quesadilla.  (I'm so glad I no longer have to do this job. Between all the close calls on the road, the raised insurance because of all the extra driving I was doing, and never being able to find the fucking apartment I was delivering to, it just wasn't worth it.)
Please make a video about ride share industry. They are very shady. Exploiting thousands of drivers out of their fair share.
Came from my tv to my phone just to mention that the familiarity of the medley was I think the point in a culture that tends to emphasize community, and I personally also just think it sounds better  Good piece--drivers and restaurants all lose out, only the app execs win w the current structure
Not only did my son (who delivered for Door Dash on his moped) have to shell out for the ginormous red DD bag, he was booted off the platform after 3 weeks of delivering for them because he had no driver's license. He doesn't drive a car, so he doesn't need a driver license in Michigan. But after spending money on equipment to make deliveries easier in moped-friendly Ann Arbor to mostly college students, he had to quit because a state ID was not acceptable to DD. To say he was upset is an understatement.
I’m still not tipping 😂 let the restaurants finally give the money to the employees
these companies screw everybody and yet still can't make money. That level of incompetence should be celebrated
I've noticed that a lot of restaurants in NY have their own delivery apps service again. When I ordered through Grubhub, I got a call from the restaurant urging us to use their website next time.
Finally someone speaks the truth!!! These companies are absolutely ruthless. They take so much and give us drivers so little they do t cover jack shit  for the vehicle. Its.insane how little we get
Delivery workers and wait staff depend on good tips for their livelihoods, for that I always tip at least 25% which I am happy to. Unless if they are total dicks still I might only do 15%. I worked as a server for a long time so i get it. Customers are usually the dicks
NEW JOHN OLIVER VIDEO OUT NOW! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKRkwftH7kI&ab_channel=LastWeekTonight
I used to work for Postmates, DoorDash, GrubHub you would have to buy your own supplies. Basically whether it be a jacket that says the name of the company or carrying bag to keep your food cold or warm. Also having insurance for your vehicle was another issue
Not just food delivery, gig economy workers in general are robbed. Uber Driver for 10 years now and they just take more each year.
If you don't want to deliver during a storm, just don't work that day. Simple!
Thank you for this video. This system is evil
If you think John's baked this Easter, wait until next year. 😉
It's just crazy to me that these tech bros think the only way they can make money is by abusing consumers and workers. Also wild to me that they still put these dudes in front of cameras - it is honestly embarrassing how shit they are at selling their own product
"Baked out of their fucking minds..."
I am just waaaaaaAAAAAaaayy too cheap to pay for it (delivery.)
I've been low on funds when ordering food before but i always tip at least the highest suggested tip amount. If you can't afford to tip then you shouldn't be ordering food. The whole tipping system is stupid but until it gets fixed its all we can do.
I tip well for delivery, but it pisses me off when drivers are running multiple apps at the same time.  If I see that a driver has my food, yet is driving to the other side of town with it first, you can bet they’re going to get a poor review and complaint filed with the app if they’re late.
This was spot on. Would just add that most New Yorkers will tell you they have been hit or almost being hit by one of these delivery bikes.
Unfettered capitalism at work in real time.
The customer spends $25 on $10 of food. The customer “not tipping” is not the problem. And if you think it is, they’ve won.
In Brazil, the Central Bank blocked Meta (facebook, whatsapp, instagram) from releasing their payment systems. The reason: the Central Bank was about to release a free to use payment system that any e-payment operator would be able to use - also for free - and people would be able to pay Facebook from PayPal with no problem. What they did was to democratize not only people's access to payments but also democratize the corporate side since now a huge company has no advantage over a small one in the payment area.  I know for a fact that the same people who did PIX work is now working on a PIX version for delivery - not only of food but also flowers, beer, usb cables. You see ... capitalism is not all that bad - even Karl Marx was a great admire of the system - but for it to work the State (Governement) must regulate and keep it healthy - as Adam Smith described a long time ago.   Adam Smith is often blamed by things he never said like "capitalism iequals unregulated financial system and markets" - words spoken in the 20th century by the Austrian economist von Hayek and his American pupil Milton Friedman. The Scotish Moral Philosopher (Adam Smith) wrote two books: "The Theory of Moral Sentments" and "The Wealth of Nations". The harmonization of these two works is known in Germany as "Das Adam Smith Probleme".  There's an old lecture on YouTube where I not only learned the joke that ends the above paragraph but also about the problem and perhaps a solution. In "Moral Sentments" Smith argues that humans have an urge to be liked and respected and that keeps human acting with civility. In "Wealth of Nations" he argues that this urge to be liked keeps the people who sell stuff from setting the price too high and the people who buy stuff from paying too little - because the seller wants to be liked by the buyer and the buyer - because that person also wants to be liked by the seller - doesn't want to pay so little the seller ends up going bankrupt.  Adam Smith's prescription for a healthy capitalism is "fair and free competition". For competition to be fair and free, Smith argued, the State must interfere and regulate finance and the economy. The great economist - who was also greatly admired by Karl Marx - also reminded readers that there are some areas of human life that should not be framed in the "fair and free competition" system - like guaranteeing what we now call "basic human rights and human dignity".  During Smith's life the West Indies Company held the monopoly of ultramarine commerce and Smith's never ceased his mental fight against such deviation from "free and fair competition".   -----  I made the post a little longer to explain particularly to Americans that things like universal health care  are not antithetical to capitalistm - they are only seen in that way in the US and only after WWII.
thank you ☕
I’ve never used these apps in my life
My solution: I just go pick up the food.
Innovative. Profitable. Orphanages.
If I ever order food, it's always for pick up. I have yet to ever use any type of food delivery service, and I don't ever plan on it.
Do eBay next
I actually just had a door dash order in NYC a couple weeks ago that took the tip line completely away. I wound up calling the company to tell them I wanted to tip. They said that I would get texted a link to tip once my order was delivered. I never got the text, so I had to call back again later to tip the driver. At that pooping, it had taken so long, I asked to tip extra, but it was such a pain of a process. I am now just going to tip cash and order through the companies directly, that way it’s not taxable.
That very clear, loud "WHAT?!" during the Pride ad was perfect
What irks me here is this newfound prevalence of nearly every drive-thru or take-out place trying to guilt you into tipping the same.  Sorry but just handing me the food isn't a service. For me tip means going out of the way. Even if my order gets messed up as long as my person is nice I will be nice back and still tip 20%
"Tech pros" are absolutely clueless.  Holy shit!
We’re all “totally stone” about food apps. Good content, fucking nacr!
I have never used one of these shitty apps
I wish he'd do a part 2 and do a deeper dive into drivers that have to use their personal vehicles to make delivers in. I'm a SAHD that started delivering for Door Dash in 2017 as a way to make some money to support my hobby. I was blessed to not have to rely on it to keep a roof over my head like so many people do. Most people that use the app exploit the drivers just as much as Door Dash does. There's a lot more to the story than what John covered and people would be shocked to know it
Clearly Biden, Hunter’s Laptop and Hillary are responsible for the rise in delivered meals because, well you see, um, oh, …….. f#$k  As for monopolies, absolutely go after Apple since they until recently had the highest capitalization - makes great news headlines! We all know that they hold people at gunpoint to buy their products. Oh, and love how Russia now cares about people choices by also going after Apple. Just leave the other monopolies alone since their ultimate destruction of the restaurant industry isn’t a headline yet. Cable companies? Utility Companies?, etc… Too messy a problem - better to avoid. People are assholes - Government is a collection of these assholes with legal powers.
I've never used delivery for anything outside of pizza- because, yeah, pizza delivery is a cornerstone of the american way of life. I always thought I was getting those from the store's delivery worker, but one day I realized that they were all door dash. When did that happen?" I always tip when I would order those, but I don't carry much cash, so it was all online. Then, one day, I heard that stores would often just pocket the tips instead of passing it onto the delivery driver, despite it being clearly labeled as _for_ those drivers!  This shit sucks, man.
If restaurants don't want to pay the fees, get off the app!
I listened to Devil went Down to Georgia, and I see John’s point, but Johnny is definitely better. The demon band is cool, but the bet was about who was a better fiddler.
I'm still angered Angie Harmon's dog was killed by a delivery driver.
I’m a paraplegic and don’t have a car. These apps have made my life easier. I use Instacart for groceries and Grubhub on days I need a cooking break. I ALWAYS tip 20%. If delivery drivers follow instructions (put on table beside door) I tip an extra $3. The other day my order came in 2 bags, but only 1 was delivered. In that case the driver gets 3 stars.
This whole "gig economy" thing is a old playbook page from "How To Exploit Labor", written over 100 years ago.  For a view to how it works, I suggest a book (how quaint!), "Triangle: The Fire That Changed America".  Make 'em all contractors, pay by piecework, use work allocation to arbitrarily reward/punish workers.  Oh. Don't forget unsafe work conditions.  The Triangle Shirtwaist fire took 146 lives, mostly young immigrant women, and injured scores more.  How many gig workers need to die before anyone in power will listen to non-lobbiests?
It’s like people are intentionally coming up with schemes for how can I screw people and make the most profit doing it.  Lousy world where all people think about is becoming the next gazillionaire.
I personally can't believe he not only didn't delve into just have bad the consumers themselves are getting screwed over by these apps, but actually implied that we're somehow the ones benefitting from them.  Like, we went from a delivery system in which it cost like maybe $3 to have your order delivered, and then whatever you tipped them, and it was practically industry standard to guarantee you would get your food hot and fresh, delivered by an employee that was at least something resembling a professional who was probably guaranteed at least minimum wage and some degree of labor protections, in 30 minutes or less OR YOUR ORDER WAS FREE, to a system where you have to use an app, get ripped off by 19 different redundant fees and surcharges NOT EVEN INCLUDING tips, just to pay like $40 for an order that cost less than $20, delivered cold, your drink flat and watery after the ice melted in it, your fries soggy, and I hope you didn't order a milkshake or anything with ice cream because if you did you know that's gonna be melted, with maybe a SLIGHT chance your food MIGHT arrive in a somewhat timely manner in edible condition if you tip generously enough, but still no guarantee of anything there.  Maybe I'm just not part of the demographic of out-of-touch ivory tower trust fund babies or people who lucked into one of those make-work middle management grift jobs where they make six figures to forward 5 emails and then browse Facebook at a cubicle all day, y'know, the kinds of demographics that can use these apps and not even realize or care how badly they're getting ripped off, but at least for me and most of the people I know who are of the same economic cohort as I am, you have got to be pretty desperate before you're willing to set money on fire by ordering off these scam apps. Like, your car is broken down, both your legs are broken, it's 2 in the morning and every grocery store is closed, you got nothing in your fridge, there's only one restaurant still open, and you're starving to the point that you won't make it til morning desperate.  I can't imagine the affluence-induced wanton disregard for the value of a dollar that enables people to actually use these apps on a regular basis with a clean financial conscience.
Don’t use them. Never will. Enjoy.
I’m sorry— what was that about leeches???? Let’s go back to that
YouTube ran the Snoop Dogg GrubHub ad at the top of this video.
I still use skype...
Admittedly the devils song is better I feel he relys too much on the background demons. Its not a bass line contest its a fiddle contest.
These videos are always so bad, I really don't know why they're constantly front-and-center on the YouTube homepage
the raising cane's i worked at refused to have any sort of cotract with food delivery apps, but we have our own mobile ordering for pick up, and the amount of times i had to take an order while having a phone in my face was almost every night. and the driver always PAID for the meal themself, and now i'm left wondering just how the app taking its share even worked.
After realizing how obnoxious the fees were for the apps, I’ve made it a point to do takeout orders through the restaurants own website, or over the phone. My regular pizza order from my local place was about $7 cheaper this way, plus they offered loyalty rewards and coupons that way.
I dont think there’s a single industry where a company can have contractor employees and is still ethical.
As a Georgian, why don't you leave the fiddle opinions up to us and the devil...
I once had a Grub Hub driver literally hold my order hostage until I added a 10 dollar tip because Grub Hub didn't pay him enough for my delivery. I told him, I always tip and had already paid a 20% tip and that it isn't my problem if you are not happy with what your contractor pays you. He still refused to deliver my order until I added it. Needless to say I canceled that order got my money back from Grub Hub and never used the app again.
Those backbacks are also used as army holders for games like 40k
Stop agreeing to work for companies that don't pay you.  You get stuck in the stupid endless cycle of not being able to afford to leave AND not being able to afford to stay.  Stop digging yourself into oblivion and then justifying it to yourself with "I have no choice".
GrubHub emails me every day I blocked them, unsubscribed...reported as spam and they still email to me. I think it's because they go through Amazon some how.
I tried two of the delivery services just once each a couple years ago and it was an awful experience both times. While I can understand that this may be useful in a huge city like New York, I feel like it's beyond pointless almost everywhere else. Both times I noticed the restaurants I was ordering from had different, and vastly inferior menus on these apps. It took forever for them to pick it up so it was cold by the time it got here. And for one of them I literally had to run a block away to where the guy parked. He could barely speak English and had given up trying to find my apartment building, of which there is no issue at all finding on any smartphone app, I literally live on a highway service street, in a city suburbs, nothing could be easier. More expensive, worse food, different menu, cold, and three times the time it would have taken me to go get it myself. Personally, I always just call the restaurant to order, then I go get it myself, I recommend everyone to do the same if they have any standards.
I sure do enjoy numbers being yelled at you. Human Squidward did a good job today.
great video but people shouldn't be tipping imo
16:58 I'd say the actual test was opening the grubhub app at all.
No way not me!  Okay so I live in a tiny town where one can walk to any food place and we have no fast food places here. 😊
The single slice of cake is not a real order , it's what drivers call a ghost order. The algorithm uses ghost orders to spread the drivers all over the map .
It should be noted that Doordash is also the single worst paying, most anti-driver food delivery app available  Also, as a gig worker since 2019, I just want to thank the show for speaking on this topic, especially the admonishment for people to remember that there are human beings on the other end of that digital transaction ❤️
Prop 22 in California has been great for drivers in the busy areas. I average $1,800  extra in adjustments and healthcare subsidies per month. The law definitely benefits full timers who reach the minimum hours worked threshold to qualify.
i will say i get that the drivers need to be fast for the algorithms and to make good money, but sometimes I do think they go a bit extreme. at my store I've had the drivers arrive within minutes of me confirming an order and ringing it up to make..   like I take and place the order in my stores system and tell the app it should be done within 20 minutes, but then the driver is there in less then 5 minutes and angry we arent done yet and that they have to wait.  whci again I understand waiting sucks, but why do so many need to arrive 20 minutes early just to be pissed off. granted this doesn't always happen, but man its common to confirm the order then have the driver come right away
Never used a food delivery app, never will. Always knew it was bad for everyone.
If squeezing small businesses with fees upon fees + not actually paying workers...        You STILL don't make a profit... .....Then your business idea is shit.  --  What if they just kept the money spent on lobbying..?        It's an app.        How much employees can you possibly have?  Everything is built on existing frameworks, using existing technologies...      Each app basically does the same;  - There's a map with some locations on it. - Locations available for orders: within certain radius from location.  - Each location has a menu / webshop. - Simple CMS for each client / location to adjust menus and so on.  - simple (externally maintained) Payment system.  - 'Parcel tracking' (or simply a timer in some cases).  - Simple user info that can rely on social login   ALL of this can be put together using ReactJS or AngularJS, (or whatever the hypest framework is now)  "Finally breaking even" after 20 mergers...? Maybe don't throw 184 MILLION DOLLARS into a pit  Also; it still baffles me how companies that collectively don't even come close to 1/4th of a billion in profit... can be "valued" as 'worth BILLIONS' (plural)  What potential is there...? They're barely scraping by
JOHN MOTHERFUCKING OLIVER IS A STONER! WHOO!! One of us. One of us.  One of us!
It is crazy how tech companies first want to disrupt a sector and then later try to see if they can make money. shouldn't it be the other way around?
He was so close to perfection in this segment . . . all he had to do was call the guy at 1:33 "liberal Matt Walsh." 😂
Has the winner been the customer? I mean yes, it's worth probably more than it costs, but ... that's still more than what food costs if you just walk down the street and get it. So you pay more, restaurants get less, workers get less, and the companies lose money. Everybody loses.
I can enjoy Harry Potter. Go JKR
The Last Jedi made a billion dollars bitch
13:25 Rachel's Shelter for Loose Babies would make a great name for a Post-Rock Jam band.
Entrapment...  The name of the game, from Apple to Uber.
Former doordash worker on here.  I have over 3k deliveries on the app it started to go down hill after last year with how they pay.  A couple months ago they took away drivers ability to see how much you will make off of the order. And also made it so if you get below a 90% approval rating you get suspended from the app.  You can also only cancel up to 10 orders a week .  Regardless of distance.  The last order I did I drove 20 miles to deliver a dollar general order of 10 items that I spent 20 minutes shopping for plus waiting in  line for another 10.  Then drove the 20 miles ..and after all of that the person didn't tip and the app only gave me 5 dollars.   DOORDASH CAN ( AND I ABSOLUTELY NOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH) CAN GO **** ITSELF
Seriously when will they stop with the laugh track....... Oh yeah that was funny 30 years ago john ollliver
You messed up, John. If there’s anyone willing to realize your orphan scam, it’s the psychos in Silicon Valley.
I proudly salute (and tip) all delivery drivers. I recognize the massive privilege it is to be a lazy, socially awkward loser and get food delivered to me with the benefit of never having to interact with another human being in said process.
I cannot emphesize enough how glad I am that John pointed out there are people who rely on these apps and just not using them, is not a great solution.
Tips on delivery app orders only go to the driver. As a tipped food service worker, when we see a doorsash order come in, its very upsetting because we rely on our tips and we know we wont get any of the tip money from these delivery app orders. Please please please tip your delivery drivers if you HAVE to use these apps but also know that the food service workers who are making your food are making below minimum wage for $0 tips on these app orders. Again, TIP YOUR DELIVERY DRIVERS. But also, if you're able, dont use these apps at all.
Enjoyed and learned! Thank you!
I worked for PostMates in NYC on 2015-2016. Once delivered eyelash glue to a woman in Brooklyn while I was in the East Village for a $1 tip. Complete waste of time.
I used to use delivery apps back in Spain, and in Europe in general, but in the US they are a scam. Fees upon fees upon tips upon fees. I wanted to try a 6 dollar pizza from Papa Jonhs, and after everything was charged, the bill would have been almost 15 dollars, including the 20% tip. I think that in general in the US, eating out is very expensive in general, and getting it delivered is just an addition on top of that. My favourite pizza place back in my home town delivers the pizza for free, but McDonalds, a multibillion corporation, can't? Sure,  sure.
"Numbers being yelled at you, by Human Squidward." was by far in the top 3 best gag titles they have come up with xD Simple but damn thats funny
I would love to debate you on this my guy because I like your content but I think you are far off on this
I agree 💯, I've always said the same, the devil absolutely won.
8:54 "listing food that that it does not actually make and has never made"  missed opportunity for the skit "i'd like the supreme pizza with no mushrooms"- "excuse me sir, *this is a Wendy's* "
Now do Yelp!
I completely forgot about Skype... also, best to tip cash.
never ordered food ever and never had food delivered to me, just never was my style
Thanks. For real.
Proud to say never had food delivered...this is all too trumpian
Yeah, people don't address the lack of proper Food Safety Protocols not followed by Delivery Apps.   I had an incident where the Door Dash guy was Cooling his Testicles with my Strawberry Shake that I ordered via Door Dash and there were three Empty Cup Holders RIGHT THERE in his vehicle!   Door Dash doesn't have a Complaint Department.   So, I immediately deleted the app from my phone, Eff Food Delivery Apps!!! 😎👍
I ordered a pizza through Grubhub in 2013 and have happily never used any delivery service since. I prefer to buy groceries and cook for myself or pick up takeout in person when convenient.
Reasons i havent used grubhub since 2015 or uber eats EVER!
I need to know if an actual human drew that Devil artwork, WOW
Does anyone ever feel like John Oliver waits until you do something to then make a story about it?
I often wonder: of all of the personal insults directed at John, I wonder how many are the writing staff roasting him, or John roasting himself. He does love to be made fun of. Like, I wonder who came up with "human Squidward". Was it you, John?
I have never used those apps. I do not trust the drivers! I work for a grocery chain.
Thank you for the devil went down to Georgia joke. 🤣 I've been saying that for 20 years now
I see fentanyl is working well for Jim.
Ah yes. The &h IT hole of the world America where even the delivery persons need tips to get by.
4:54 he should have said anyone under 25 😆
The one thing John didn't cover is the market is now saturated with new drivers. Customer demand is down so these apps algorithms are giving horrible paying orders. I have seen orders for $9 to go 25 miles. In what universe does that make sense to accept? I'm moving on.
Skype literally survived until Discord proved that they just never actually made an update beyond the initial launch. All the problems Skype had and all the features it lacked, were either fixed or mitigated in regards to problems or added in regards to features. It really *was* an easy opportunity to stay on top but they got so lazy someone managed to just pull the rug out from under them.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE PRIDE AD KDGKJHSDFKG
Thank you for standing up for food drivers! Your thumbs up ratings and tips make a big difference !!
As a truck driver who can’t fit in most places and the places we can fit have poor choices of healthy foods or variations…..I appreciate these apps and the people who take care to deliver to us.
So, how long until a techbro starts an AI orphanage?
I'm 30 and cook all 21 of my weekly meals 90% of the time. I just refuse to pay other people to touch my food. I've worked in kitchen's as a kid and it was the most fun but on bad day's no one washes their hands !!!! Plus we're all so lazy now.
Oh i knew this since the beginning #grubhub #ubereats you guys suck! We are to blame, we've gotten lazier
Tips???
"Even these platform companies struggle to break even."  "Customers get a great service." How about we make the platforms non-profits and taxpayer subsidize them enough for the workers to get a fair wage and improved working conditions?
As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have never cringed as hard as I did during the Postmates Pride Month commercial
Ive been skeptical of these apps for a long time. I find that calling ahead and going into places to pick up an order in person and tipping directly into the restaurant for my own food results in greater customer service and sometimes greater food quality than my friemds and coworkers who fet delivery. The restaurant gets all the revenue, and i save money by not paying delivery fees
Interesting choice to almost exclusively focus on the more sympathetic bicycle delivery workers. For the sake of clarity and the ever important context, it would be nice to know: A) What percentage of these workers are actually doing it full time as a sole source of income vs true gig workers, and  B) What percentage of these workers actually deliver on bicycle? You know, since that was the entire focus of this piece. And because...context
I've never used one of these food delivery apps, and I never will. Though I'm "lucky" enough to not live in the delivery area for anything like this, so my whole life I've gotten used to going out to get food myself. That plus the fees I hear they charge are absolutely batshit crazy.
John Oliver…. You are a treasure.
“Not yet profitable” has millions to throw at lobbying to not have to pay reasonable wages 🤔
Any time you tip. You should tip in cash so that the head of the company has no idea how much money they're employees are getting.
Does he ever cover anything joyful or life-affirming?
I remember I paid a few dollars extra but it was hot and summer new job too literally stuck somewhere random and I got a solid lunch extremely helpful
If you have any shame at all, you should be very ashamed of yourselves software developers and your marketing teams. You simply hide behind code and computers with no connection to human lives and no connection to society! FaceBook CEO, X CEO, .....all come from the same piece of cloth! You people have NO social sense at all!
I'm so confused.  I recently started using one of these apps, because I have an elderly roommate who can no longer drive, and he constantly wants McDonalds.  And he would call me and ask me to get it for him all the time.  Sometimes I would be working and I couldn't get it at all.  That is when I find out about these apps.  It was a huge problem solver.  Now I realize that the price is much more expensive.  But I figured that is what you pay for the convenience.  So the restaurant is making profit as they typically would, from the sale of their product.  And the upcharge goes to the app service.   So why on earth are the app services charging the restaurants on top of that?  So they are getting the large upcharge and they are also charging the restaurant?  This doesn't make sense to me.  Exactly who is benefiting who here?  Without the restaurant, the app service doesn't have any business.  But without the app service, the restaurant still does business as usual on site.
I literally made this argument about The Devil Went Down to Georgia a few weeks ago.
The devil vs Alastet be like
In China the delivery drivers are given suits, helmets, electric vehicles and charging. They are also treated with a lot fo respect.
This is capitalism at its worst. I never used those services and I never will. Same with Amazon, which is synonymous to modern slavery, killing brick and  mortar business while squishing  dependent Amazon sub-contractors. Those tec companies try their best to make the world a worse place…
As a fella that worked a wing joint bar during lunch time...whose duty it was to take to go orders by phone (not the hostess?)... The phone was so busy...my guests at the bar felt neglected, reflected in gratuity...and I had to gather these meals from the kitchen to box & bag em. Then make sure it was there in time for that driver to get a tip. I'm so sorry, yes I saw you wanted a refill....I had this phone thing going while I was at work.
Uh, didn't grubhub just go under?
DoorDash has an interesting way of sidestepping companies that won’t partner with it. It’s called the Red Card where you pay for the food through the app and the delivery worker goes through the process of ordering and buying the food with a special card. This includes business like Safeway where’d you have to go through and find every single item on the persons list and buy it, then deliver it on time
whoever invented pretzels was big into anl-sx because pretzels are good for reducing fecal odor
Ubereats is a profitable business. These platforms do make money nowdays. Just google for ubereats EBITDA
This is capitalism at its worst. It’s not a system designed for the “real” people — it’s benefitting the corporate “person”
The Jungle was published in 1906.
I get it. But if being a delivery person sucks so much X, why are people doing it? There’s no shortage of jobs in this country.
Starting an orphanage??? Da Fuq
Brb, gonna work part time at door dash so I can go start an orphanage.
I was at a construction site couldn't leave so I got rallys chicken wings delivered seen plenty of deliveries at Amazon too
These software developers and companies are real thieves, stealing people's names, images, and businesses!!! Wow software developers and software developer marketing teams ---- you are regular crooks!!!
In Zaragoza, we have a cooperative delivery company to compete with that. The fucking best, every one of their workers are happy with their conditions. Also, tips are not a way to make your wage, any system that relies on tips, is basically flawed.
Uber / Lyft also take about 58% of the fees charged to riders. It really is like organized crime.
Is Mr Door Dash INSANE???? What is he talking about? he knows nothing about the giggers
I'm just baffled that John Oliver is actually advocating for tipping.
This is the absolute worst line of thinking I've ever seen Oliver do ever.  The point of these apps was to make available food from restaurants that didn't setup delivery services. That's fantastic! Papa Johns used to be the only delivery food.  Now he's asking us to tip people that are paid at least minimum wage... you aren't paid minimum wage as server. I was there, I know.  Pick that fight. But let me get my bao when I'm too drunk to drive
a third to half, haha, tips are 75% WITH UBER FUCKORATION ! FUCK UBER ! THEY ARE DECTEFUL, LIKE ALL CORPORATIONS !! FUCK THEM.
Blame this on Apple making users stupid..... jus’sayin.....
I have started using food delivery apps since my husband's death. I didn't really before; primarily because I enjoy cooking at home, but also because when my husband and I broke down and ordered food from a restaurant he preferred to go get it rather than having to wade through multiple sites trying to determine who can get us the same meal for less. I was already aware of the issues regarding "gig workers", but  ameloriate my guilt by making sure to always tip well. But something that happened a few weeks ago to me on GrubHub spotlights both of the issues mentioned in this episode - the animosity restaurants may have for these services, and the issues drivers have being "employed" by them. I ordered food from Grubhub, received a notice that it was "on its way" and then that it was delivered. Even though it never arrived. I contacted the driver, who said the restaurant told him it had already been picked up. I called the restaurant myself, which advised the same thing. As far as the restaurant was concerned, that was the end of that.  GrubHub refunded me my money and gave me $5 off my next order for the inconvenience. But the driver who drove there (I don't know from how far away), sat and waited 20 minutes while we both tried to sort this out between the restaurant and GrubHub? He got nothing.
Damn! He truthed us! Facts!
I wanted to tip on doordash, their website stated it would be easy and just to look on my "receipt". I had to contact customer service and be on hold for an least 45 min just to add a tip.
To address the issue at the heart of this story: I think the reason that Johnny won wasn't because his SONG was better, it's because the devil chose to largely phone in his fiddle part, hiding behind the talent of his keyboard player and bassist. It's a FIDDLE contest, after all.
Please do a session how these companies are getting hacked and the small business owners end up not getting their money owed to them. No one seems to be talking about this issue that they are facing!!!
I wish you would have mentioned what the base pay is for delivery drivers. When I was doing Uber Eats and doordash, it was as low as $2 sometimes so if you don't tip your driver, they are bringing you your food and it takes 15 or 20 minutes or sometimes more and they're only getting getting $2
I don't understand why the cost is always pushed onto the workers and consumers, they had millions to get their way, but need to charge me extra?
I think the problem is a lot of the deliverers are perverts and there are a lot of videos of them fondling and eating some of the food they are meant to deliver.
as someone who has driven lyft for the last 6 years because im a disabled veteran, even though i have 3 bachelor degrees, they absolutely do not give a fuck about us.    i have had guns and knives pulled on me. i have been assaulted repeatedly defending women, and the lgbtq community, i have almost died on multiple occasions and i got almost 20k in debt between covid and medical bills from lyft. on march 20, 2020 1 week after i was furloughed from seaworld orlando, i was hurt severely stopping 2 men attempting to rape my future lyft passenger. i managed to get her away from them and home safely but i ended up with 8 broken ribs, 6 broken fingers, a dislocated left shoulder and a concussion, all of which was captured on my 5 dash cams, and lyft refused to do anything. leading to me having to getting a loan and not driving for 6 months while i healed. till my credit card maxed out. tried to find other work, but it was covid and nobody was hiring so i was forced to go back to it. had bills to pay.   i would give anything for a better line of work or some help financially, but i'm getting by little by little.
I paused this video half way through to walk to a restaurant to pick up a take out order.  I think the last time I ordered delivery was during COVID lockdowns when I learned someone I recently saw was exposed and I didn't want to get out of the house until the tests came back.
Hey, one more thing this little english man showed me to hate about Merica. And Im from Argentina, that says a LOT.
I don't use food delivery companies as I want to get the food while it's still hot and that hasn't been my experience.  I tend to order from places that do their own delivery or I just go and get it. And just so you know...  Artesano closed up shop.  It's a marijuana dispensary now.
America is capitalism gone mad.
The only thing I despise about these delivery services is the INSANE AMOUNT OF FUCKING BIKERS. Worst part is that they do NOT USE BIKE LANES. 🙄
John Oliver looks like…..Mr. October in the Bad Boys of the IRS calendar.
Best show on TV
Thanks,always wondered how the job paid,what it was like to work for them and how they were treated. Was thinking it might be an interesting part time job and fun. Think I will just stay retired. Clearly their is no up side to doing this.
Damn man, that is all true. I've been an Uber and Doordash driver for 6 years in California, I remember Proposition 22 and Assembly Bill 5 that Prop 22 was a carve-out for. The gig companies absolutely bombarded me and everyone else with phone calls, text messages, paper mail, email, voice-mails, there was spam inside my Uber/Doordash driver apps, even the merchants were complaining to me that they couldn't even get a single order out through the app without having to press "Yes I support Proposition 22" on every order. They hired astroturf companies whose goal was to inundate social media with fake support for Prop 22, I saw it on the Uber and Doordash subreddits, Facebook groups, even fucking Discord. They paid a LOT of money to dupe Californians into thinking Prop 22 was a good thing.   Anyway rant aside, yes, it is absolutely true about the ratings we recieve from customers, those ratings can easily either get the amount and quality/pay of orders sent to you reduced, or get you deactivated altogether. "Fired" in the usual sense of the word.   And yes, they really want us as independent contractors, that was the entire point of Prop 22, that we don't become employees and therefore gain all the usual labor law rights like the right to a minimum wage, unemployment insurance, workman's comp, reimbursement for gas and vehicle maintenance etc. It was pretty underhanded to say the least.   Lastly yes, the tips are really important! We don't have a right to a minimum wage. So on Doordash for instance, Doordash pays the delivery driver 2 dollars per order and each order takes approximately 20 minutes to complete, so that comes out to earning 6 dollars per hour -- before taxes expenses -- which we also pay 100% of the cost of. We aren't reimbursed for any of that from the apps. That's why we call him  2 Dollar Tony. Uber is slightly better than Doordash for pay, but your tip really does make ALL the difference between making less than the federal minimum wage, or above it.
I've been saying that modern "business models" aren't anything but - for a long time. Here's another proof. Evaluation of these by financial market institutions is an equally "kaputt" concept. Originally meant to support the operation of businesses it now completely controls them and ultimatlely leaves them with no choice how to actually be run. And I couldn't care less if this would just impact the businesses. Becauase we all know by now that where one business (or a whole industry for that matter) packs in, another one pops up to replace or substitute it. What does really concern me though is the fact that it severly impacts people's lives. Big time. And almost exclusively in a bad way.   It's just plain ridculous.
I live in a southern city with very poor public transit. Uber is the only reliable ride service for most of those without rides to get to work/docs etc. I don’t see how I, as a driver, only get 50-65% of the cut, the rider is getting ridiculous fees that are not explained, and Uber is somehow losing money? I’m 1099, Uber pays for nothing. Wtf is this “not profitable” bullshit? Like, I’m ranting a bit, but I’m genuinely curious.
The thing is, they have NEVER been cheap using ANY of these food delivery apps. They’re screwing over mom and pops businesses and enabling lazy fucks that then tip like Uncle Scrooge
Please tip everyone! I usually do about $1 per mile they have to drive from the restaurant. If you have money for delivery, you have money to tip. And if you dont, there are other services to get you food in most states
well... I've been convinced the time has come for another round of trust busting laws to be implemented. Anyone with me?
get rid of these parasites. We don't need these food delivery middlemen or the companies exploiting them
smh, Johnny is clearly the better fiddler *because* he's playing old favorites. If the Devil plays his original song wrong, who would know? If he messes up, how could you tell? But because Johnny is playing things the audience will recognize they would also know if he slipped up even a little.
Why would I use a food delivery app? I have a bicycle
I worked in pizza from the housing bubble burst through Covid.  DoorDash was more expensive and slower for customers than our delivery drivers, less accurate on delivery times (they had to be updated on the app or web portal), and lower quality food as a pizza bag is is purpose designed.  DoorDash also had a higher delivery charge than we did so it was just a bad experience for all parties involved.  I can't imagine its gotten any better in the last 3 years so I really doubt that "The customer is profiting from the service"
Thank you
No comments on drivers contaminating food
As someone who was manager of a Coldstone during the pandemic, this episode itches a very specific and special part of the brain. Grub hub still lists restaurants without letting them know, it happened several times with me. They have outdated menus or just completely made up items. It was the worst.
He didn't even discuss how many times these delivery apps have been suited for stealing tips
I tried being a door dash driver.  I live in a mountain area.  Which made getting a signal for the GPS difficult sometimes.  Other issues were how steep the roads and driveways are. Sometimes GPS took me to the wrong house.   It was definitely frustrating not getting a tip. After 5 weeks I totaled up miles, gas cost, and how much I made. Let's just say I was in the negative financially and emotionally.  I wish people ordering food understood the cost for the driver, the gas, the time, the stress..we really need to be tipped well.
There's an industrial version of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" where the devil wins the fiddling duel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBP79L8QwbY
i think uber is now profitable if im not mistaken
Crazy idea... Call me crazy... Make your food at home = Problem solved!
Nah it’ll be fine. I’ll just get it myself.  If I am to tip the workers then have the product more affordable…god damnit
I was expecting the NY Grubhub guy to reappear in the video later with a punchline...
“Dashers”   ….. 🤮
Johnny is definitely the more skilled Fiddler but the Devil is the more entertaining musician
Jim Cramer is on this show so much, he's practically the co-host.
all someone has to do is give drivers like 2000 dollars to sign a contract where they accept the money under the condition they don't use their phone to make any money for the next 2 years
I used to deliver for Uber Eats. I had an order for McDonalds at 2 am. At 2 am they only have drive through. I waited in line for 45 mins, finally got the food, figured out the apartment where I waited another 30 mins for the customer to come down to pick up the food. The customer was so high, gave me a bad score for the food being cold, and the total I made for that transaction, $3.45.
The U.S. is capitalizing itself into a third world country for a good portion of its citizens. Nothing will change because the powers that be have been bought and paid for. We the people do not have a government anymore, we have slave owners.
Thank you.  Uber Eats and Grub Hub are losing money because the employees of their app aren't being treated like independant contractors and are paid highly and get vacations and healthcare.
Working parents managed without these apps for centuries. As have stoners. We should just outright ban gig work without benefits.
The consolidation era started 20+years ago. Large trucking companies started buying up the smaller ones and eventually driving independent contractors to either join them or get out of the game. Same thing with mobile phone companies, insurance companies, etcetera. It's all a racket. And our (very much bought and paid) govt is allowing it.
It's gotten to the point that I see a John Oliver thumbnail and I only click to find out *why* I won't be using XYZ thing anymore.
If the business isn’t making money, where’s the owner’s paycheck coming from?
Next one should be  Food delivery orgs. Due to recent news makes for a pretty depressing april 1st.
I'm impressed. he was actually funny tonight. I laughed once.
The most pathetic part of this whole situation is the fact that many people DO NOT HAVE the skills to plan, prepare and execute their own meals. I don’t care what the quality of the food is from a restaurant, you are at their mercy for hidden additives and sanitary conditions.  Whether you can afford it or not, whether you need help, or you don’t think you have time … the bottom line is your health as well.  After 6 years in the military some 40 years ago, I was so happy to be in charge of my own food and diet. Through a few operations and times I was laid up I managed my own kitchen for all my meals. At times I had family, dogged in divorce needing to work 60+ hours a week, travel bcz of my job and a myriad of other things… I still managed to make my own meals.  These days I can do more in 3-4 hours of meal prep than I can eat in a week. Extras get to the freezer for unplanned times.  I don’t care to eat out these days bcz I’m a far better chef than most local restaurants could interest me. I do make an occasional exception for sushi.
I love how they bought Superbowl commercials.
Tony Xu is worth 2.2 billion dollars btw
Microsoft killed Skype so they could focus on Teams.  They bought Skype while they had a Teams precursor in development specifically to help them better corner the market on business video calls.
I fully support people in food delivery.  They sure deserve more benefits in general.  However, I totally disagree with this 5 ⭐ culture John is promoting.  It's like tipping; restaurant owners should take care of its servers.  Tipping should be our way of expressing our gratitudes.  Uniform 5⭐ is like mandatory 50% tip for just ok services.
You look constipated
I personally disagree, Johnny gets my vote for ultimate enjoyability.  The Devil's segment is very involved and very fast, sure, but it also sounds like you're riding a Coney Island subway full of coked out disco tech patrons, and one very angry man experiencing both scabies and a mental health crisis,  As their increasingly frantic movements accidentally tip it off an elevated track and dump you to your death in a run down residential area....  Too ominous and involved, and there's not a lot of joy in it.  Meanwhile Johnny's part sounds like you had a great night's sleep and you're preparing to party at your favorite cousin's wedding reception. And granny's adorable hound dog don't bite! I know which adventure I'm choosing.  That song is fibbing on one thing though....the devil has absolutely no sense of fair play. When he sees he's been beat, he's just gonna point to something behind you, and then try to hit you with that 85 pound golden fiddle when you turn to look.  He's like GrubHub, in that it's better to just walk away from his offers in the first place.
John is right… delivery apps suck for so many people (speaking from experience) and I had more fun listening to the devils side.
Calling instead of using apps is the best thing you can do for a local restaurant
i bought food with a drink 5 times from a restaurant and got the drink once.  so i called the place and asked.  is my dasher stealing my drink?  are you guys forgetting to hand it to them? what's the deal.  turns out the lady remembered my order and had forgotten the drink but actually took it out to my dasher in the parking lot before he left.  ever since then i started reporting when i dont get the drink but i also report the dasher for stealing my drink.  suddenly i start getting a lot more of the drinks i order.  hmn.  they also never read the notes.  i warn them that i'm on the first floor and not to knock.  they almost always go to the second floor by default then turn around and come back down.  they often knock very loudly (i have ptsd).    and the worst part is that most of the times when i have a female name as the delivery person, it's a large male that shows up instead.  not ok.  use your own identity.
Please tip/thumbs up your delivery drivers ! 95% thumbs up is a success and gives all rewards, but 94% thumbs up counts as a fail and removes all rewards for Uber Eats 😢 thank you ❤
I was an Uber eats / Uber driver for 3 years making $92,000 a year. That said it was 84 hours a week, I’d spend Thousands on gas every month. When my car broke down Uber was practically like good luck. Then the taxes came and after everything I made less than 7.25$ an hour after taxes, gas and car expenses at roughly 250-300$ a week of “savings”. I recently got a real job at 54,000$ a year as an office worker. Everyone complains about the work while I’m thriving.. I used to never have a life, never had medical insurance. Now I have all of that. One time when I drove someone I had went to the dentist and I couldn’t talk without pain. They left a review saying I talked too much and was disrespectful.. my mouth was practically wired shut. I tried to contact Uber about it but got no real help there. I’m literally so glad I got out of that situation and into a real career, with actual benefits and the ability to actually enjoy life.
Damn i gotta rate these drivers more often. Especially when they do well
11:50 - exactly! Steve Vai against Ralph Macchio? pfft we know who won that duel, I don't care how the film ended! :D
This model definitely needs to be changed, but I'm not sure about tipping. It's a stupid culture. Please just raise the price and make everything transparent and fair.
You drop into a place to eat. The place is empty. But it takes an hour to talk to anybody. Constant ringing and beeping. There are no customers there, but there is. You just couldn't see them, so you didn't know that hey are there. But anyway, robotics will kill that model of work completely. Mean, the driving will be done by robots on wheels.
Fantastic piece John, the apps are really evil as the evidence shows. Damn, rough out there. I always loved our pizza delivery drivers in the 90's.
Can I just say… I love John Oliver. He’s such a babe. 🥵
Why should gay parts go to get actors..?
"15-30% in commission" me, a former table server, remembering the chef berating me for screwing an order, telling me that restaurants have a 2% profit margin: 👀
And this is why I don’t use delivery apps
I didn’t get the bottom eating ice until I realized and it’s hilarious 😂
Did he sue the person's insurance?
Ex Doordasher. The pandemic and 2021-2022 was the best times to tip. But nowadays I cant even find a order in my area. I have to go to the bad parts of my state and no one tips. Rich people are the worst at tipping middle and lower class are 50/50 I went from making 500 a week to not even 20 bucks. Its crazy. Final straw was I went to a bad neighborhood and my car got hit by a bullet. My safety is important than the 2 dollar tip for pizza from a fancy downtown restaurant.
INSTACART is another rip off .
I delivered for SkipTheDishes years ago when my city was the Canadian company's test market before UberEats came to our market.  SkiptheDishes took cards thru the website, but customers could also pay cash.  Drivers had a cash float, and when a cash order came thru, drivers paid the restaurant, and customers paid us the cash for the order plus a fee and tip.  When UberEats entered the market, most skipthedishes drivers (who we knew each other from waiting in restaurants together) noticed that we'd get huge cash orders that would have you deliver to a weird location.  I was sent with $60 of sushi to a Uhaul store at midnight and $75 in pizza to a yoga studio at 1am Saturday night.  When this happened, Skip had to reimburse drivers for the cash we spent at the restaurant, and drivers kept the food (or it happened so much with such huge orders, that I made regular stops at a church where I knew homeless men slept).  This cost SkiptheDishes so much that they pulled out of our market.  They didn't want to give up taking cash orders, because it gave them access to customers that the other new companies couldn't service since they only took orders that paid by card.......so who was placing those cash orders?🤔
So where is all the money going?
I enjoyed most of your videos, John, but tipping = placing responsibility (for an employee's wage) onto the consumers. It's trying to alleviate a problem that should not exist.
It would have been incredible if he had finished the show asking for a slice of cake
For those who need to know what's meant by Ls & Ws...here's what I can do: HELP! Someone knowledgeable help us, plz? Us others wanna know, too! THANKS! ☮  (I looked it up & got nadda.)
Used GrubHub exactly one time to order Taco Bell early on in the pandemic. After I waited over an hour for the guy to go to the wrong house and looked at the fees I was charged, I realized it would be less money and it would only take me about 15 minutes to pick it up myself. I have and will never use one of these apps again.
“Uber is not profitable” Hey google what is the net worth of the owner of Uber…. 5 Billion dollars? Interesting that, I wonder why…..
I agree that the devil with his band sounded cooler than Johnny in _The Devil Went Down to Georgia._ There is a fan theory that the devil conceded on purpose in order to encourage Johnny's vain and sinful ways. Think about it: There was no one adjudicating the contest. And music is subjective. The devil could have just said "nah, I'm better than you" and taken Johnny's soul. The theory is that if the devil had claimed victory, Johnny would have tried to turn to salvation in order to avoid what is otherwise an inevitable trip to hell. But since the devil admitted defeat and gave Johnny a golden idol, he might be more likely to end up in hell due to his own sin, and maybe even drag other people down with him by spreading his story of beating the devil.
Here’s the definition of hustle in the context of “side hustle” for all you Webster dictionary 🤓’s….”to have the courage confidence, self belief and self-determination to go out there and work it out until you find the opportunities you want in life” - Urban dictionary 💀
If the business requires tips, it shouldn't exist.
Who the eff orders food in a flash flood?! You’re supposed to have grabbed a 6-pack already and posted up on your porch to watch the storm like it’s the Saints at the Super Bowl!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VohubM8Hls4  The Dregs live at Montreux, if anyone needs inspiration regarding playing a fiddle hot.
So who's winning?
I no longer use any food delivery service, not even pizza with their own employees. It is too expensive between the various fees and my orders were *always* wrong or items missing. If I want it, I'll go get it or do without. Plus, I check my food in the drive-thru.
The Devil delivers a very loud, but technically simple, sample. Most of the music comes from his band of demons. Johnny delivers a much more complex performance, and the words are all the names of famous country bands. Johnny wins hands down, his was the far better fiddle performance.
Here's my solution to this and all the other clusterfracks everyone seems to love for convenience; I don't participate in any of them.
Feel sad for countries where tips seem obligatory.
Black mirror type shit
Have done delivery work for many moons and I’ll tell you the same thing every delivery person will; working class neighborhoods tip, the upper class ones don’t. Everyone of us hates when we get an order going to the upper crust parts of town, cause they are usually harder to get to and the pay off is bare-fukin-minimum. When I was still doing food in Chicago I would deliver to condos that cost tens of millions of dollars and get $2 on a $250 meal.
I bloody hate tipping culture, personally just an additional reason not to get services that typically get tipped.  Due to my inability to hold a job, when able, I do some Grubhub and Doordash. Obviously lots of what they said here is true, BUT, people like me just want to be able to work when they can (or want) without limitations. Pay has improved but is still trash, sometimes can be good. Depends on location, driver, luck. I usually do pay-by-time option on doordash so that if stuck at like McDonalds for 30+ minutes, I'm getting paid the whole time.  That really sucks for the businesses, it's honestly hard.
They should just pay them decent wages and remove the tipping, the rest of the world gets by fine without it and we can too.
Waymo just partnered with Uber Eats to launch autonomous food delivery in Phoenix ... Now you can get your take-out food delivered to your home by a bright and shiny robot - no pesky humans involved at all.
It’s a funny joke n all, but Skype sold itself to Microsoft for billions and its founders went on to hang out on private islands, so a fully realised opportunity. :)
If I can get around using the app I will. Or I’ll pick it up myself if I’m in the neighborhood. I get a lot of discounts on them so it’s tempting.   Another thing: I almost always give five stars. Most of the time things work out but I have had some bad experiences including drivers who were drunk or stoned. One wanted to crash at my house. Another wanted me to watch her kid for her. Some drivers are just clueless. One ate half of my food. Some don’t need the money and just do it as a joke. They troll people get fired and laugh about it.   Something else: to avoid disappointment, I try to use common sense and avoid ordering certain things on delivery apps or from certain types of places. I’m not going to order a ribeye from a steakhouse (although some will sell frozen ones you can cook at home). I’d never order a milkshake or a sundae. I’ll order a pint of ice cream. Burgers I only order from Places close by. Fries I avoid ordering but if I do I reheat them in my oven. Asian and Indian food seems to travel well. I never have a problem. Distance plays a role too. No more than 4-5 miles depending on what it is.  Pizza usually is fine.
I'm sorry as informative and well meaning this is, one glaring fact that needs to be pointed out is the USA's atrocious tipping culture in the face of rampant capitalism. The US has a sickness of making people live on tips while paying starvation wages. THAT is what needs to fucking change here in this god awful rot of a country. Gig workers feel shafted if they don't get tips and customers feel shafted if they keep needing to pay tips after tip on every god damn service here from food delivery to door opener to cab driver. The tip culture is out of control here and something needs to be done about that first.
still not tipping, stop asking the consumer to the pay the price of these greedy mfs companies
Fuuny to hear an Englishman telling you to tip.  All apps now appear to either include tips in the item cost or force you to pay from your post-tax income. Its not worth to order at all. Food that used to cost 20$ now costs 50$ in these apps.
Unless a restaurant delivers their own product themselves, I do not order anything for delivery from that restaurant.
During the pandemic, these food delivery services had much lower fees, which made them cost-effective -- I could order a $10 meal from just down the street, pay about $5 in fees and $4-5 (about 25%) for the tip, and it was delivered timely and professionally.... but now that the pandemic is over, that same $10 meal has $15+ in fees and if I pay any less than $20 for my tip my meal will either be half-eaten or ice cold by the time it's unceremoniously plopped on my doorstep two hours later (minus whatever drink I had ordered, which the driver likely drank enroute). That put it pretty squarely in the "soooo not worth it" category for me, no matter how little profit these companies claim to be making.
We don't make any money 🤷🏽‍♂️, (Publicly for legal reasons so we can avoid taxes)
nice - push this video to more people
Uber eats makes it almost impossible to leave a tip now. Crazy.
16:56 Clearly NYC
I've never used any of those apps and never will. 😂❤
Holy shit.....Covid-19 wasn't done by China......it was done by Big Delivery......if you read this I didn't kill myself.
In the age of "influencers" and online creeps making videos of themselves tampering with other people's food, I have no interest in any of these ridiculous services.
will you guys do a story on libraries?  We're so tired and people keep trying to make us into criminals (see Louisiana).  :-(
I have delivered for Pizza places for many years in multiple cities over 30 years, to make extra money. I learned very early on to choose a Good Mom and Pop place that had steady regular customers. NEVER work for a large chain or one of these food delivery services. I typically made an hourly wage, plus per delivery or mileage, plus tips, plus a free meal or free food to take home. In the late 80s I would typically make $15 to $20 per hour, mostly cash. I worked at a chain for one shift and quit and I worked for a delivery chain for one night and quit. They are terrible to the workers.
2:05 THIS SHIT AINT NOTHING TO ME, MAN
This is cool but can we have like one good news tonight with John Oliver?
These apps pay drivers $1-$2 per delivery while they are charging the restaurant $10+ in fees and the customer is also paying a delivery fee on top of that? The government definitely needs to get involved and regulate them.
Now I see why restaurants inflate their prices on delivery apps. I’m conflicted since I use them. I don’t own a car. But I make sure I tip. I use them for groceries and other things. It’s not just for treats.
I still always wonder how people when tipping just dont follow it being at least the maximum of:  $5 (no matter what is ordered) 15% (of total bill) $1 per mile (from restaurant to delivery)
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no John know you cannot you cannot put the words prophet and orphanage in the same sentence but I guess we're all WADEing through the dogs shirt again
Happy Easter to you too John
If you believe these deliver apps aren’t making money then hit me up cause  Im selling a beach house in Idaho and you’re the exactly who I’m looking to sell to.
Be aware if any of these services can’t find your address, you are charged and they eat your food.
It’s sad, you’d think that people and governments may go after companies like this, but instead they’re rewarded.
I work delivery because my Social Security Disability payment isn't enough to meet my basic needs. I've delivered in all kinds of weather; people often don't turn on porch lights after dark; toys, packages, garbage, etc are often blocking the path to the door; people expect us to deliver to porches that are rotten and/or moss covered (Last year on Easter, I fell down stairs after dropping off the food. I called the delivery app company to find out what I should do. They didn't see a problem because they were showing THE FOOD WAS DELIVERED. My only option to get my medical care covered would be to sue the homeowner.)  And, in spite of this, I still deliver because it allows me to eat every day and fix my RV enough that I don't have to live under a bush.
Does anyone else remember cafe courier? They were doing this back in the early 2000’s and it was affordable.
How is this guy defending tipping culture?
Customers aren't winning either. Noone is.
Would have been useful to know this back during the pandemic.  I used Grubhub all of time from Brooklyn, but only from a few nearby places.  Should have called them directly.
When I use these apps I tip in cash and on the app. That way the driver knows they are going to be tipped, and then when they get here they get tipped again.
When you play a piece if music your audience is familiar with, you subject yourself to a greater test of skill than someone who can claim "I meant to do that" about their mistakes.
Part of the reason these companies don't make a profit is they spend MASSIVE amounts of money in advertising. Assuming they wouldn't lose business if they stopped spending on advertisement, almost all of them would be making healthy profits. John's analysis is spot on. The reason they are doing this is they have the tech startup mindset. They want to grow aggressively and take up all marketshare at the expense of their competition, and are willing to spend DECADES running a deficit to corner the market against their competitors.
I worked for Uber eats, and it's awful. Restaurants use all of the apps, and don't care about the drivers. They will keep us waiting for over 30 minutes for a $5 order, all the while telling us it will be "Just five more minutes."  I was deactivated because I let bad restaurants know that when they do that, they're screwing me over, because I'm not paid hourly.   I had 70 thumbs up ratings from customers, with 0 thumbs down, but I had 30 thumbs down ratings from restaurants, and no matter how many deliveries I did, I couldn't get those bad ratings off (because restaurants only give a rating if it's a thumbs down) and was deactivated.   Meanwhile, I shop for people on Instacart, and have a 5 star rating. It's still a horrible job though, but not many jobs let you pick your hours 🤷
Isn't the whole top vs bottom thing, kind of offensive?
All you really need to know is that these companies would rather pay nearly 200 million dollars to keep basic protections away from the very people who make those businesses possible.
I am watching this, while eating my Seamless delivery, which is delicious, btw., and being glad that I tip well! I also tip much more when there is inclement weather, because I respect the delivery guy's work!
I've stopped using food delivery apps - unless absolute necessary. The prices are crazily different from the restaurant. I will pick up myself when I can. Also I call the restaurant directly if possible too.
So let me get this straight.  The problem is that these companies aren’t paying their workers… and your suggestion is TIP TIP TIP! So that these companies can continue not paying their workers? Is this video sponsored by door dash?  No. Make the job so unattractive that nobody wants it and they have no choice but to pay people.  if they want someone to risk their life on a bicycle to deliver a cup of coffee, they need to pay that person. Maybe they can use some of that $5 fee they are charging me to pay them? Or the 30% they’re taking from the restaurant?
I think the problem at the very root of this one is car dependency. A lot of people use delivery apps because they're lazy, but delivery being something that keeps drunk drivers off the road, something that allows busy people and disabled people to eat nice food at all is largely a car dependency problem. If for the drunk people, the restaurant was reachable on foot or by public transport, they wouldn't need to get delivery just because they can't drive. If for the busy people, all the zones in the city would be so intermingled that there's a restaurant on the way, they wouldn't need to get delivery. If for the disabled people, there was accessible public transit to use, a lot of them wouldn't have to rely on delivery and they could also better participate in society.  Also, is classic delivery not a thing anymore in the US? I live in a small German city and I often get takeout when I'm at work. I have a small stack of menus in my drawer and the restaurants that do offer delivery have their own driver/s and set their own prices.  What really irks me is when people order delivery out of pure laziness. What I mean by that is when just because they were too lazy (not busy!) to plan ahead, buy groceries and so on, they go on to support shitty corporations. Being able to have whatever food delivered to your door when you want is a huge luxury and I do very well without it, it just takes some planning and some emergency food for those times when there's just too little time or you're unwell. I think that it's immoral to support such corporations just to have a luxury that many people do well without. There's also an entitled attitude that often comes with this. Some people who are used to the luxuries of big city life come to a small city like mine and expect that there's a restaurant in short walking distance or with delivery ... while being in a suburbs. It often turns condescening even though in reality, rural life comes with advantages too.
I miss those days of ordering from the paper menu. LOL
I've only ever given one poor rating and in that case the driver literally stole a part of my order
And a whole $2 of that goes to the driver!
30% for them, $2 for the driver + the awful suggested tip weeeee
I remember during the pandemic I was working as a delivery driver for Domino's. I got two things out of my free time in that era. One: a caricature of an Uber Eats delivery worker in the form of Kiki's Delivery Service. So imagine a drawing of Kiki wearing a face mask, carrying a food backpack and a broomstick with a phone holder. It was one of my popular drawings during that time. Two: the outline for a book series I'm working on. It's about a teenage pizza driver that learns to drift during the pandemic. And one of the big conflicts of the book is the fact that the kid is falling behind on homework, losing sleep and is on a steady diet of leftover pizza and energy drinks.  Point is, it's a tough gig and it's not for everyone. My family was getting worried considering the hours I worked and my health. And that was under Domino's. I sympathize with the NY Deliveristas and have been supporting them for a long time. And as a former pizza driver myself, please tip your drivers. Preferably cash.
Redbubble increased their fees to the point they take nearly half of earnings for some. This is after they already take a cut. It's not just the apps. It's the whole economy. It's so broken.
This whole industry is 🤮… Literally and figuratively.
I've only used these apps 2 or 3 times, and then only with major coupons I got in the mail and even with those $10 off coupons, I still found the cost to be outrageously unsustainable and thus never used these apps again.. That last journalist interviewed talking about how the apps are charging less than the service is worth.??..  It's mind-numbing. I simply can't understand that at all.
I used to work for Uber and Doordash during 2020. Uber wasn't bad and I made decent money. Doordash on the other hand is horrible. Its the most stressful job ive ever done and I used to be a nurse aide. You absolutely can NOT work whenever you want, only when its busy enough to turn it on, like dinner or lunch time. There are many occasions where they will offer you a laughable $2.50 to go thru a drive thru and deliver it halfway across town. You do not see the tip til your order is over. If you sit in a busy drive thru or lobby for 30 mins, you still only get that $2.50. At the end of your dash time they always push an order that no one wants to take that is very far away. If you dont accept an order for any reason, youre acceptance rate drops, which makes you less likely to be able to dash during busier times. Not to mention wear and tear on your car is all on you.
Jim Cramer: Neoliberal Ghoul
This better be about the criminally low base pay.
The devil lost because although his piece sounds fancy, it's technically basic. Johnny is the much more technically competent fiddle player
I did use the service called Grab in the Philippines. Always tip big and give 5 stars. For the drivers. They are all on motorcycles and work super hard. Even if the order is messed up.  Its not their fault. I still give 5 stars.
I just took a side hustle as a contractor and looked into the taxes. The taxes are insane.
I want to be a grubhub driver, but unfortunately I can speak English to an understandable degree.
Never underestimate the ability of Microsoft to fuck something up (in this case, Skype).
All for nothing.  California just killed its small business industry, so only big dogs like Corporate McDonalds and contractor-like gig industries can survive.
The only food app that I use is Slice🍕 Pizza lovers over capitalist vultures‼
If you can't make ends meet on one job, that job has failed you.
Do restaurants get anything at all when we use $30 in DoorDash cash we got in free gift cards…?
Why do venture capitalists think their employees value time more than money? Time is money... clown.
I love how the opening chapter of Snowcrash almost perfectly predicted this in 1992.
I call BS on not profitable.....when you pay 80% extra for delivery, it's a fucking lie.
i have nothing to say about the food delivery set up and agree with absolutely everything you’ve said on that. HOWEVER. the devil went down to georgia is set up that way bc the devil could NOT back up his own talent. if YOU go back and listen to the song, you’ll hear that the band behind the devil is doing most of the work. while the hero of the song plays songs he knows songs that he’s practiced and loves and are 100% harder to play than what the devil was playing. the devil did not do anything technically impressive with a fiddle.
How to make money in technology today: Create an app that serves as a middleman between products and consumers, then profit off of both of them, making everything more expensive
Check out any comments section related to any kind of tipping and it’s easy to see food apps are not going to end well. The average American is an entitled, cheap, AH who will complain at the slightest suggestion they help someone else out when they don’t have to unless it’s by giving money to Joel Osteen type scams.
Now might be the time for personal responsibility. These companies wouldn't exist if consumers weren't using them. Look on a map, call the restaurant directly, and pickup yourself or get delivered. I never use these apps - they're too convenient isn't a good enough excuse. It's good for us to get out the house.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ IT WAS FINE PLEASE DON'T FIRE ANYONE
Tip? No. Never. I'm not your boss. You don't work for me. Of you did I'd pay you min wage
I remember before Doordash I was unable to open an orphanage, now I have two. 😉
My boss dropped Grub Hub like a hot coal ...... Their fee's were ridiculous and not worth it.
Also, if I may: If you can’t tip, you can’t afford to eat out/get delivery/etc
I am buying IPO shares of 'We Eat' as I am typing this.
here in susanville you could only get pizza delivered before the food delivery apps came in
Stopped tipping since 2022, Doordash gives me $20 free meals, so....
The customers are not winning either. Its wild to see pizza places no longer offering delivery now. Pizza prices are the same but delivery fees are insane. Its way more expensive.   Where I live too Chinese restaurants have disappeared, I wouldn’t be surprised if in part due to delivery app leaching into their business. In a few short years we’ve lost the staple delivery options and got in return expensive fast food delivered by starving Marvins.
Corporations are the enemy of the people. They are just a new version of feudal lords. And yes, they are monopolies split into small groups of corps that work in tandem. Anti trust needs to come back in a BIG way.
Ppl who order food when weather is life threatening…yall know who you are 👀
I know you said we're winning as customers because we pay less than the service costs but that's the only angle that's a win.   When we ordered a meal for two people, in Seattle, no appetizer, no drinks. It was about $60 after tip. I can go to my local restaurants and get out at $45 after tip. That's not a win.   We stopped using the apps 4 months ago and haven't looked back.
OK, I will continue to not use these bullshit apps, thanks john
Why do people not realize how supply and demand works? if people would simply refuse to work for such low wages and poor conditions, pay and conditions would improve over night.
I have never used a food delivery app... and after watching this... I never will.
(1:54) was gold. I can remember many college friends who sound exactly like that. His impression was incredibly accurate. And that’s probably a regular customer for him so he was able to hear and practice his voice so many times. That is the classic stoner voice.
I do not understand how they can charge $60 to deliver a $30 order and still not make a profit.
Well, revenues and profits, different things.  Right?  Well, where’s the money go?   16,000 orders turns to 7,000.  Where’d the money go.  The Restaraunt’s are losing the delivery guys are losing, the apps are losing.  Where’s the money?  If you are cutting 50% into the Restaraunt that after growth investing there isn’t any left?   I always tip 4-5 times more than suggested.  But these drivers need protection.  Medical, legal, job protection.  Shit, I’d pay for that.  Where is all the money.  And make forcing Restaraunt’s on your site and show up at their door some kind of crime.  Jesus, man, you don’t get to do that.
0:45 “What!?”😂😂😂
As a native New Yorker, I've always been able to have food delivered directly from restaurants, so this sudden growth of food apps seems quaint.
Well there is numerous issues  with these apps that are actually anti consumer to begin with.   First the completely messed up tipping system where the burden of paying employees is on the consumer not the employer.   With Delivery apps instead of  tipping after the service you are expected to tip before the service essentially as a way to bribe the driver to even pick up your food,.   Imagine walking into a restaraunt and just handing the server 5$  just as you sit down. No one would do it so why should i have do that with these apps.  Then you have drivers who will just pile up orders primarily had this issue with grubhub and doordash   then start delivering them. Therefore this means after spending increased food prices fees taxes  and now a tip just to have  cold dead food. Uber Eats has an option for priority but its 4$  which solves that issue but now people will not be likely to tip as their tip goes to that fee.  For example there is a breakfast place near me  to dine in roughly 17$ give or take  food tax tip . But if you get uber eats or door dash same dish  its almost 35$
26 minutes and not a mention of how outrageously expensive these apps are? You could be just ordering a meal for yourself and end up spending $50 after all the fees & tip.
It's Nazi Israel now. The Israeli government have been earning the title for decades and hyper spaced to it over the most recent six months.
is that studio audience real? it seems to cut off all of a sudden sometimes
Thanks, John! And thanks, MAX...always worth the wait!
Please do an expose of Balance of Nature
Why would sailors be in your soup? Many people live far from the ocean.
What are those service fees, delivery fees, and city fees for?! I already know it's not going to the restaurant or the delivery person, so it's got to be going somewhere. Are these apps really saying that even at getting 20% from the restaurants and 20% from the customer with all the fees, they still aren't able to make a profit? Is *that* much money going to lobbying and marketing?
As a long-haul truck driver, DoorDash is useful because I'm sometimes stuck in places that aren't near any restaurants, so I have to get food delivered to me (because obviously I can't just park my truck anywhere I want like a car).  But there have been times I've started to place an order and then changed my mind after seeing how expensive it would be.  The only time I've given a bad review was last month when the delivery guy didn't call me when he arrived, which I very clearly put in the instructions, and for a good reason
Some context on Skype, most people don't know. Skype is what became Microsoft teams, which from my position in Europe seems quiet successful (unfortunately)
without exploiting the powerless a lot of these "ingenius" businesses would not exist in reality..
Damn Skype
I dont use any of those apps.
store delivery or restaurant......my kids order food and they charged my card 2-3 tmes
Did people forget that restaurants have phones and can still take orders like they always have?!?!? Stop giving in to corporate greed!!!!!!
Easy solution is to not use these apps, and go get your own food.
The delivery cyclist with the electric bike…i think he’s gonna be ok. Dude was dropping mad cash on his setup. Now if that was a loan or all of his cash on hand, then I apologize but man…
they also charge you 2-3 times later not only that one time
Great job! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not gonna lie, i am one of these workers and at least in my market, i have none of these issues. As long as i do my part of the process, Doordash does a fantastic job of making sure i have a good experience. And i make fantastic money doing so. We are given more than enough time to safely complete deliveries. And if you provide great service, as is your job in this situation, you get tipped well. Also, you can set up your app to be able to see how much you'll make for a delivery before you even accept to do it. I average making as much as an ER nurse in my same area, to deliver food to people. This video is the exact opposite of the experience I've had.
This should be a series of videos. I work for a grocery delivery service. They changed the pay model halfway through and wouldn’t tell us how pay was calculated because we couldn’t understand. Now they say it’s based on “effort”. But if I carry up 4 32 packs of water up 4 flights of stairs, they still pay around maybe $7-8 for that delivery. And then, of course, no tip. And also, do people realize that we are people? That when we try to communicate with them about their order (when needing to make a substitution), that we’d appreciate a response back because we’re human? Not even a thank you for going out in a blizzard to grab those facial peels that you definitely needed at 8PM? I will say, if you use a grocery delivery service and you can’t figure out why your order gets pushed back an hour or you keep getting crappy shoppers, it’s because we remember where good tippers and non-tippers live. If you want the convenience of having groceries at your door, tip. I wish John would’ve gone into depth on companies besides restaurant delivery services. Grocery delivery services are just as terrible to their independent contractors. Bundling orders, adding “multiple delivery hour orders,” and punishing you for reasons you can’t control. Please do a deep dive into grocery delivery services. I think you’ll be shocked.
Skype got integrated into Teams.
Not only are the delivery companies fucking over the drivers, the drivers themselves are often trash.  I've had such repeatedly bad service from them I've basically stopped using any deliveries at all at this point.  And on the rare occasion I do I don't automatically tip anymore.  Instead I meet them at the door with cash.  It's funny how they won't just sling your food on the ground and walk away without knocking when you haven't tipped them yet.    I've had multiple restaurants commiserate with me about the state of "DoorTrash" (the main one in my area), but say their hands are kind of tied because so many people expect delivery now.  Two of our local ma'n'pop restaurants have just stopped all deliveries after decades of delivering, just because they're tired of dealing with bad delivery drivers and slim margins, but can't afford the $20 an hour (California's new minimum for fast food) to hire an in-house driver again.     Apparently DoorTrash will hire any ol' surly ex-con or tweaked out bum with a rusted bike of Theseus, and the service shows.  And when said tweaked out bum leaves half your order at the restaurant (because reading is hard), you have to get DoorTrash to reimburse you, and good luck with that process.  Got proof of the food that wasn't delivered?  NO?  You can't prove a negative?  Well toughshit for you.  Every part of the system is a disaster.  I can not for the life of me understand how this got popular in the first place, pandemic or not.   Lastly, I've always said the devil played it better.  Nice to see the world coming around to this.
Servers and delivery people should get living wages, period. Tipping needs to be abolished as a practice. It's just a way to hide the true cost of a service for marketing purposes and it's unfair to workers and consumers.
... Was always calling directly to the restaurants to pick up or even directly, at place during pandemic... Rarely used the apps... But those poor people on those delivery e bikes are everywhere...
Never have, and baring being hit with a serious medical condition, never will order food from any 3rd party delivery service. But never did it ever occur to me that the restaurants paid companies, I thought it was just a business transaction between the person ordering the food, the app companies and their independent contractor drivers.   I just thought the restaurants put up with it.  I'm gobsmacked how crazy out society is becoming more & more each day.
It doesn't really matter how much you're ordering unless it's a massive order. A single slice of cake isn't worth more of a tip. A wedding cake would be. And not because it would cost more.
After delivery fees are up 200-500% and they introduced "service fees" and other BS, I'm now back to ordering by phone and picking the food up myself. Even including fuel and my own time it's not only cheaper, I also make sure that all the money I spent on my order actually goes to the restaurant staff doing the work and not some shareholder profiteering off of an unsustainable scheme of exploiting underpaid work.
Not even providing the damn backpack is cartoon villain levels of sleazy greed.
I am way too poor to use these, lol.
❤️ You John!
This is moderately embarrassing but I have done delivery on and off for about 15 years now, starting in college when I was 19. I've deliveried for 2 specific restaurants and 3 third party services. Two of those are app based, one was old old school, doing 3rd party delivery since the 90s using massive walkie talkies, they were named Restaurant Runners in Boulder and god knows if they have survived. Because of all this, I have some THOUGHTS, especially about Tony Xu. He especially bears a fuck ton of blame for the unethical behavior in this industry, he is downright shameless.   I'm gonna start with something that shouldn't be controversial: delivery is good for society! Period! We clearly need it to be available for people in medical, personal, or other events where having quality meals brought to you literally is a mental health necessity. Also, delivering groceries or other items locally bypassing amazon is also good! Bringing my "real person" career of archaeology into this: for most of human history food preparation was done mostly large scale for society by dedicated workers (bakers and the like) and food has been delivered from dedicated food preparation businesses for hundreds if not thousands of years. Literally there were fast food stalls in the days of ancient Rome. This is good and works for our species, bulk food prep cuts costs and maximizes food eaten, reducing wastes.   However: venture capital lead by tech bois who do not understand that ROUTING is so goddamn important and share a general conservative libertarianism that leans heavy on freeloading off the labor of "lesser" workers is bad. Tony Xu with doordash is a shining example. I've been a dasher since 2016, and his "i grew up working in my family restaurant🥰" schtick is so annoying because ANYONE who has routed delivery inside a restaurant would know the way he directs deliveries is fucking bananas. He makes absolutely no care to food quality, keeping routes in sensible directions and orders of who gets delivered first. During the pandemic they were still sending orders to dashers who were near the customer's house so the total milage was literally DOUBLE for every order. Who the fuck does that? Only tech bros whose parents didn't trust them with getting a license. And about prop 22? Itvwas supposed to help keep their costs down right? Door dash is consistently having to pay me 30% more at the end of the week because their own stupid algorithm doesn't pay me what their cherry picked, hand crafted law set out. Which means that other drivers in other states are absolutely getting skewered with lowball offers. I saw one on reddit recently that was 3.50$ for two orders. Fucking nonsense.  An additional point of information that will likely be relevant: when prop 22 was being lobbied for the big apps paid for astro turfing on twitter especially, they were trying to drown out actual drivers complaints about the law proposal. One of them recently replied to a tweet i made back in 2019, meaning those astro turfing fools are about to be out in force again.  Editing to say: I made more working for the guys routing orders in a random tiny office in a rundown office building with walkie talkies than I do with doordash. AND I had to pay a 50 cents per order "commission" doing restaurant runners. But the delivery fee was based on distance from the restaurant and the fee plus the tip were all mine. One time I got sent hell and gone into the mountains for a 25$ delivery fee. The way doordash operates, it does not take terrain or weather or traffic into consideration when the algorithm decides pay. It goes by as the crow flies distances.
as someone who drives for Uber Eats and GrubHub, I am really interested in this video. But I also want to say thank you to all the customers who trusted me, paid me and continue to allow me to do this. I really enjoy it and it somehow manages to still pay my bills. I understand these apps have major flaws, but its not my fault. I hope things change to help out the customer and the drivers and I hope this gig can continue to provide me the freedom to travel like I have been, and the means to pay my bills. 🫡
NEVER EVER let corporations justify their bullshit with "we're not even profitable yet" They're always just inflating their expenses for growth and tax purposes
This makes me kinda glad I've never used a delivery app.
I always thought the devil's solo was better.
The miss piggy line works both as a sex joke and a spousal abuse one and I'm not sure how intended that was… 🤔
I refuse to use those apps. I also refuse to use uber style apps, Scamazon and other stuff that I can clearly see as taking advantage of everyone
I may use Uber Eats twice a year at most.  When I do, I always tip in cash so the driver doesn't have to report it. Unfortunately, this means the driver see 'no tip' on the receipt and may figure I'm not tipping and taking their sweet time getting to me.
I've never used DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Grubhub, and never intend to. I like restaurant food, but if I can't go out and get it myself I'd much rather make myself a sandwich or pour a bowl of cereal than use any of these apps.
Ok, so I started listening to this video in my earbuds and I wasn't actually watching it and all I could say to myself was you have to be freaking lying😂😂😂😂 then he says "it's a real ad" 😂😂ok ok fine. I'll watch.  Sorry for just listening.
Dammit, now I want a slice of cake. Oh wait, there’s an app for that!
We shouldn't be expected to tip, not in Food deliveries nor at Restaurants....the Spanish way. The service fee should cover a fair share to the rider, however high that may be.
As a German who hasn't seen the movie either, i enjoyed that joke...
you guys, stop freaking working for these companies. literally. just stop. they are never going to get better. we didn’t need them before, we don’t need them now. y’all just act like we do.
I worked at a local brewery that got listed on door dash against our will and they had filet mignon on our menu, which we didn't serve, and we constantly got orders we couldn't fulfill.
I fully believe that by controlling what work those workers can get by punishing them for bad reviews fully makes them employees.  The company fully controls when and how they work.  that isn't independent.
I’m so glad you did a segment on this. I have been gig working for a few years and they offer us so little pay. I get $2 orders from DoorDash all the time. I reject them because they’re not worth my time which causes my acceptance orders to go down, making them only offer me $2 orders. It’s so annoying.
Never had to use delivery apps.  Hopefully never will. I almost never eat out, just eat at home , and rarely, cheap fast food where no tipping is needed. Use them only if you really have no other choice, because you are paying way more. Want the dining out experience ? Go to a Whole Foods, because even with their high prices , there is no tax and no tipping like a full service resto. There are plenty tables available. Quality is good.
The old ways are better than the new modern ways.
Less talk of tipping, more on requiring the employers to pay their employees enough so tipping isn't compulsory.
I stopped supporting these companies not long after the pandemic. Food quality, misplaced orders (became way to common), and increased cost just did not make sense anymore. If I am at home and I want food delivered I can just order a pizza other than that I just meal prep and cook at home. Protip if you want carry out most restaurants now have some sort of website that is their own.
I was with you until the “millennial subsidy” part. I have ordered food, picked it up, and spent $50. Same order delivered $130. You are telling me that delivering that order is worth $80? If I develop a business model that only works if my customers pay much more than the good or service is worth, I’m a dumbass. If you do it, you’re on the cover of Wired magazine?!
Why on earth did that driver take that order??? Perhaps the app punishes drivers for saying no too many times. The restaurants tack on big delivery charges too. Gone are the days of free pizza delivery.
All reasons why I won't support the "gig" economy.
There is another major cost to the Profitability of those food delivery services ; The CEO & Board of Directors still get massive bonuses from the companies regardless of the survivability of the company . AHH  the good ole days when that was called Embezzelment .
14:13 "The bike itself cost between $1800 and $1900 new" I bought a 2009 Prius for that and thoroughly used it, beat it for two years before it died short of 400,000 miles recently. Why are you all paying such stupid prices for a damn bicycle? You can't even drive it on the interstates that you already pay taxes for.
184,000,000 HOLY SHITE
you missed the part where those apps also skim the tips to the workers.
I know it’s very complicated but the tipping loop needs to be broken somehow.
Why are you pushing tipping? Let the business pay their employees
The devil isn't FIDDLIN worth a DAMN
Never Used One, Never Will!
People if you ask them anonymously about their habits: "I never tip,  I already paid." "I don't tip unless i get my food, then i'll give them a couple dollars"   Unfortunately, i don't think people are going to tip more because they are selfish. I wonder if there is a good way to deal with this situation with the only losers being the corporations failing their customers.
Yesterday I saw an special offer on one App , I ordered it but realized later that I can't eat KFC that's against my diet,  so i offered it to the delivery guy . If a non foodie person like me just ordered something I didn't even eat what those foodie people will do , can't imagine.
In India, we have a similar situation with apps like Zomato and Swiggy dominating the food delivery sector. Zomato even introduced an absurd and impractical model where they would deliver food from different states using airplanes! 🤣
Friend of mine is a project manager at grubhub. They had this playing for them at an all hands meeting first thing in the morning “unpacking these claims” as he said it. So way to go John! Keep up the amazing work 😂
I can get a large pepperoni pizza and cheese sticks for maybe $30 for pickup, ordering from apps have at times costed around $80 delivery for the same order. It's not worth using apps unless you have money to burn and/or desperate/lazy.
Skype was bought by Microsoft and modified/replaced by Teams which is by far the biggest video calling platform. That joke didn’t land the same for us computer nerds. 😀
fuck tipping and delivery apps, I just order take out from time to time and cook most of meals at home
The devil was disqualified from the song because being backed up by a band of demons was not part of the deal.  Also that band was the whole thing that made it good, the devil playing that fiddle solo wouldn't get anywhere.
Their employer is supposed to pay them, not us. Tipping is just enabling them to pay low wages. Want changes? Stop tipping.
In-and-Out opted out of all the delivery apps. A McDonalds, Burger King, or other fast food combo meal is approaching $15 in SoCal.  I can still get a double double animal style with fries and a coke for under $10 at In-and-Out. Yeah, the drive through may be 100 cars deep and take up to 30 minutes, but totally worth it.
when i was driving for doordash, i got an order for a delivery that was 30 miles away towards the end of my dash, i was expecting it to be taking me back to the town i lived in. but the doordash app doesnt tell you where you are delivering too until you pick up the food. i ended up having to drive 20 miles to get the food another 30 miles in the opposite direction. when i delivered the food i got no tip and only a $2 ccommision for the now 100 mile round trip to deliver subway. and one resturaunt i went to pick up in had a rack specifically for doordashers to pick up from with a sign saying that the food would be placed there. i came in didnt see my order so i waited. finally an employee asked me what i was waiting for i told them i was with door dash and the name on the order they went behind the counter and kept making orders for other customers. after a 20 minutes wait i was getting mad and went up to the counter to ask where the hell my order was it had been sitting behind the counter the whole time and was cold when touched it. they told me you have to come to the counter to check in the sign on the shelf and the apps instructions to go directly to the rack were wrong. ill never work for a food delivery company again.
COUNTER: Tip culture is OUT OF CONTROL. Work jobs that you dont have to rely on the charity of others... until these scam corporations start paying a fair wage!
I don't understand how a bad review for a restaurant reflects on a delivery driver. That's such a stupid system. My driver could have been amazing and the restaurant burned my food or something.
From food delivery to package delivery to construction, I'm realizing that this whole "independent contractor" business needs to be *drastically changed.*
Thank you John for looking out for the little guys.
The drivers know how much money they're going to make before they accept each job, and they don't know how much of it came from tipping. So the story about the single slice of cake might be technically true, but the driver knew how much they were making BEFORE they accepted the job.   Also, tipping is stupid. Just roll everything into one bill that doesn't require an act of charity. I thought Mr. Pink settled this issue 32 years ago.
20:30 :: John is describing the process that is now known as "enshittification" - create a service, operate at a loss until you're the main, major, or even _only_ player, then price-jack it to the moon while tanking its quality and run off with all the profits you can squeeze out of it.
I live in a spread out rural area, local gig workers have told me that 1-2 dollars a mile is considered a fair tip.  That's what I usually pay unless I'm ordering a large grocery delivery.  In those cases I add an extra $10 (flat) on top because I assume they are giving up other runs for my larger one.
I gladly pay $10 to $15 in fees and tip to have food delivered when I’ve been drinking because the alternative is unacceptable
This is bullshit... Johnny absolutely desrved the W against the devil. The devil's all flash and flare no substance.
The Devil cheated by bringing in a band, that's why he admitted defeat. Johnny was just as good without help and the Devil knew it.
I have never used a food delivery app. I order all my food from Amazon, and get fresh fruit and veggies from local growers.
GRUBHUB sells your data. They have restaurants sell them the data for a small cut and if you order directly with Grubhub they sell your data outright.
nah.... tipping is not an obligation.... tips are extra, for doing extra. Its not the customers job to pay a businesses employees their wages.
some shit is leaning so far liberal its dumb. Don't order during a flash flood so that the person who is trying to make $$ has no option, those humans cannot be trusted to make the right choices for themselves, we must choose for them via social and moral pressures ... XD  Come on now, if the app paid 100 dollars or 1000 dollars to those workers in emergency situations, we wouldn't complain... we would start weighing the value of a delivery or two ourselves when it's hectic out there. So, the issue isn't the conditions or the choice, it's they don't get paid enough right? so tip them, more if you feel guilty...
Worked for Postmates back in '17. It was the closest I've been to actual slavery in a work situation. I understand a little has changed since then, but there was no consideration for vehicle wear and tear; I drove through heavy storms, and in my area at the time, that meant massive potholes on freeways and surface roads. I had to spend thousands during that time on repairs above and beyond mere maintenance. Further, because the way the business is structured, you cannot collect unemployment for any reason other than the loss or destruction of your car, because if your car still works, all you have to do is turn on the app and you technically have a job. On top of all that, the money and tips were sh*t [and in a very affluent delivery area]. It was the beginning of a very frustrating and financially devastating period for me. Luckily, after a few years had passed, there were two massive class-action suits against Postmates, and I recovered about $1000 from them. After having worked for one, I will never use a food delivery app.
Instead of telling people who order food "You need to tip more", we should tell companies "You need to pay your workers more".
Watching this while stoned hits different :))
Those food delivery apps are parasitic...
having a friend who does Uber, Uber eats, and Lyft anything less than 5 stars isn't worth anything.
I don’t like these apps simply because they and the delivery guys are asking for too much
What should I say… The land of the free!!! If nothing gets really regulated, because of freedom, this is the result.
The only delivery I ever order is pizza, and I still can't get away from them.  Pizza places where I live don't even have their own drivers anymore, they outsource it to DoorDash.  So now I have to wait an hour and a half to get SOME of my order before calling to the store to complain.
Once they have cornered the market by removing the competition, it wont be such a good deal for consumers and it will hurt the people who really need the service. It's capitalism at its worst.
And this is why I semi-retired once Postmates was bought and I switched to DoorDash, it's literally just vacation money now and an excuse to ride my bike. around town.
John never remarks about the extremely high cost of the delivery as compared to the cost of the item ordered. The delivery companies tack on service fees and delivery fees. They even charge extra for the service fee on lower cost orders. Then tax and tip are added. I would rather have added some of these fees to the tip. Your $7.39 pack of water comes to $18.60. That's what I paid today on bottled waters I had delivered from a drugstore using a delivery app this morning.
yup
As a cab driver who bought into Uber (literally, a $40k vehicle I've put 260k miles on and had to replace half the drivetrain) ...thank you. Some one has to fix this.   Otherwise, someday I'm going to go postal at headquarters and use the second amendment to make the argument for fairer pay that they won't hear via the first.  "I left my heart in San Francisco."
tipping on this ap is odd anyway start off and says how much do you want to tip then when you rate everything ask for a tip on top of that
Johnny should've lost his soul
I just can't understand how workers don't read the instructions or won't call if they're unable to find the delivery location
And this is why, if it all possible, I try to avoid food delivery apps like DoorDash. For one the delivery fees are way too expensive and to know that's the *subsidized* price? Yikes. You get screwed even before tipping the poor delivery driver, who's also getting severely underpaid while you get price gouged. Seriously you have been exceedingly rich to "live" off of food delivery apps, which aren't good for anyone involved, which includes restaurants, drivers, and customers. I'll just go to the restaurant itself or the grocery store at that point.
It costs me less to drive to the restaurant myself than to order from these companies... there's no subsidy.  It's just capitalist house of cards churning money.  Who is really winning is management.
I have Epilepsy, and am not allowed to have a license. It's really nice to have these apps available. I just wish that not everything had to suck all the time. Like, why does everything suck?
goddamn this show has had its budget cut tremendously
What is the point to upload this part of mondays episode?
idk if the solution to this should just tip more and keep ordering anyway, not like it is implied that is the only thing just was the closing statement but...wouldn't worker protection, contract requirements like gear and minimum wages be the better thing to advocate for. As I understood it the entire model isn't even profitable so maybe it would be best to let it die and look for an alternative...heck I don't know how to fix it either and cause not as much pain for people but this feels like your house is on fire and your using a glass of water on it and just go to bed.
the devil went down to georgia bit is lifted from tom sharpling's the best show. is he a writer on the show or is it a stolen joke?
UberEats hid that tip button IMMEDIATELY, like within 2 hours.
wait they call Lieferando Grubhub!?
I've never been happier that me and my family don't even have the apps. We've never done delivery outside the companies we're ordering from. I'm saying it, you shouldn't use delivery apps people
Remember, just because the company doesn’t make money, it doesn’t mean the ceo and others don’t get paid. Check for salary, hourly and stock compensation. They hide how they get their money.
Tip the drivers in cash.
The app in my area do not have a tip option any longer. Ever sins cash on delivery was eliminated the tip option seems to have disappeared, granted here in Sweden labor laws are far stricter and prices have gon up far more than inflation warrants, I hope that means delivery worker get decent pay.
And yet, when a greedy, scmbg company jacks up their prices just so those greedy, scmbgs can have more money, stupid ppl still support them.
I live in Germany and we have one restaurant in our village. They don't deliver, but they do take aways. So, if I want their food to eat at home, I have to call them and then get my food from the restaurant when it's ready. Insane concept and it actually requires the ability to plan ahead about an hour into the future, but on the plus side: I know that they get the money I pay for the food they made. Plus, I know that restaurant and I know their food is always really good, which helps to avoid disappointments, imo. A life without food delivery apps is possible!
I know here in Germany we have a cash culture but try to always tip in cash. F*ck the companies. Keep them out of the tipping system at least.
Since the first time I heard the song I felt like the devil's portion was better XD
No, I don't HAVE to tip. The company NEEDS to pay its own workers. Its not my job to directly pay someones salary, that is the job of the company who employs said worker.
Surprised John Oliver didn't make a reference to the movie "The Internship"
In regards to your trigger warning: I am a 46 year old woman and I would rather have thirty two simultaneous root canals without novocaine over the alternative being calling anyone on the phone.
Delivery fees is why I don’t like using delivery apps so I use the stores website or call them up
I expected they were slightly predatory, not this level of crazy.
I think it's easy to get "outraged" by the inequities of a marginalized gig economy job. And easy to gin up sympathy. But it's a job akin to what mowing lawns was and no longer is. Or shoveling snow. No one is supposed to be doing something like this during a hurricane. It's risky done on bicycles (as has been being a bike messenger for 50 years). It's not meant to pay a living wage, have health care coverage, or even be something a serious adult would entertain doing. We need to be honest with ourselves...food delivery has been and always will be a marginalized job sought by those with few options. Frankly, the same goes for so many jobs, including enlisting in the military, if we're being honest, here, evidenced by the disproportionate number of poor and minorities who enlist (and I was one of them).  Frankly, this whole piece is a bit lightweight, not really worthy of the energy expended. What's next? Sally and Joey's oppressive shift hours and working conditions at the neighborhood lemonade stand? Forced to dispense dodgy lemonade at inflated prices to infrequent passersby, with only a hard stool to sit on all afternoon on a Saturday, with no guarantee of income, forced to leech off of mom and dad's healthcare, only to be eventually forced out by Big Lemonade and time to come in and get washed up for dinner?  I love LastWeekTonight and John Oliver, but this is getting a bit ridiculous. Of all the major issues that could be covered, they've come up with this?
😂 I got a Grubhub ad for this video. So Grubhub actually paid John Oliver to shit on them. PERFECT
Also what I didn't realize until reading the subreddits where these drivers post is that, the tip is ALL THEY GET. They don't get anything but your tip. if you choose not to tip, you're not just not giving them anything extra, you're literally asking them to work for free
Delivery apps should not exist. Smaller local companies would be much more cost effective and could work similar to parcel delivery services. An area is covered and employees are paid an hourly rate with employee protection
please do one on rideshare nonsense
Tramp stole the tips.   great googalamoogla it
Nothing more cringe than using doordash
Note: 22% of what GrubHub took from Warren Bar and Burrow was promotions, so that 58% is skewed. It's my understanding that promotions in that break down are promotions that the restaurant agreed to run or participate in. Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?
There should be a limit on standard commission these delivery companies charge restaurants (20-30% is way over profit margin of significant majority of restaurants). What's not mentioned in this episode is how some customers will file complain against the restaurant for missing (a straw) or wrong items or not prepared just right, just to get out of paying for it. Restaurants ended up with these losses.
Watching the intro to this feeling like I once again fell out of the loop during a big hit. Never used food delivery aps, never needed to, never wanted to.   Knowing this show though, something tells me my embarrassment at missing out is going to turn into "thank god I dodged that bullet."
I have seen a lot of Costco orders lately going from the Montaño Costco in ABQ to Santa Fe. They aren’t profitable unless you were already heading that way anyways. They seem to only show up when I have already gone up to Sante Fe for Amazon shifts and it doesn’t make sense for me to shop and deliver it and go 120 miles round trip to go back up.
I feel like grub hub, and the like, would actually make money if they 1 paid their employees and 2 stopped advertising so much!
I was a messenger most of my life. Food deliveries were always a pain in the ass. So we charged appropriately. 1. It was automatically a rush. 2. A 'special handling' fee was added. 3. ANY waiting time at the restaurant was added. 4. Weight charges were added. So, we hardly ever got food orders, which was fine because WE DIDN'T WANT THEM.
Door Dash is horrible with marketing calls, too. I manage a small restaurant and we turned them down because their fees/rates were so high. They called us every freakin’ day for probably three months trying to get our business. And sometimes they would call during the rush. Ugh.   We said No several times and told them why. Then, it escalated. Over the next few months we told them no and why in a not-so-nice way, were straight up rude to them, said put us on your Do Not Call list, threatened action against them for phone harassment, got downright sh*tty with them, blocked the number… and they still kept calling!   Eff Door Dash.
these gig economy apps cant make money because they pay a bunch of software engineers 200k+. Uber alone has 30k+ employees (not contractors) and theyre based in sanfran. thats nearly 6 billion in salaries alone.
As a handicapped individual, I do rely on these apps, but I try to be generous with tipping and would gladly pay a higher service fee if it meant them treating restaurants and drivers better.
Hey John, speaking as a server for a burger and beer joint and my experience with DD - collectively the cooks, servers, Managers hated DD.   While receiving very little profit on the food - the tip goes to the driver. I will hussle for a tip for myself, or for the cooks. Typically, tips for takeout orders would go to the cooks. I will hussle for them, but not for the drivers of DD earning a server's wage driving a car around.   Therefore, I got diabolical and simply made them wait until I felt like I had enough time to handle them.   DDdrivers are the worst during dinner rush. They always came into the restaurant holding their phones, looking around for service, putting themselves in my way, basically showing up expecting the food to be ready for handoff. Which is fine, I am just not motivated to serve you or them 🎉
If you just vote with your dollar, things that don't work will go away.
Is my wife and I the only ones that still just go and pick up our food at a restaurant? I've looked into the extra cost, not worth it.  I'd rather just go out myself.
Thank you for shining a light on this, John. So many people don't understand the tipping conversation, especially, and this helps provide such important context that can make a real difference for these workers.
Why do we still have to tip in NYC if workers make more than generous wages? John I’m sorry that’s ridiculous. Tipping is not mandatory.
Why was this reuploaded?
I'm not tipping. Not my responsibility.
I have never used any of these services, I live in a rural area and they don’t deliver to the sticks. So I drive 25 miles one way, once a week to shop and run my errands.  I chose to live where I do but many people didn’t. I am quite happy with my choice. People suck.
And this doesn't factor in ghost kitchens, which are going to undercut restaurants.
On a plus side; if door dash is just ordering food off your website or via the phone, you get the normal profit.
the company can tip their workers and even call it a living wage. Tired of being the customer manager signing worker's checks every time I interact with any employee. Pay your employees and show me the price up front.
Fuck the delivery guy the apps are still to expensive. Subsidy my ass, if I want takeout I'll go drive to pick it up like an adult.
Idk about you, but i think if you have employees, you should pay them and not require tour customers to do so. Kinda just makes sense?  Theyre not our fucking employees?
Noooo, don't tip. Stop the tipping culture. That is a big part of the problem
It is damning how little players have to hit the ball both ways outside the majors
The only food I ever get delivered is pizza, and its from a driver of their own.  Any other time I just order it then drive to pick it up.  I refuse to use a delivery apps for a few reasons.  Im sure there are good delivery drivers but I just dont trust em all, they treat their drivers like crap, they rip off restaurants, and it costs a fortune.
I work foodservice and we are stretched thin on margins....
My issue with this is how this episode rarely brought up the cost on these sites….two medium pizzas plus a tip cost me 72 dollars. How is this ok?
Ubereats, doordash, with the ridiculous 5 dollar plus, for a service fee is ridiculous
Skype became bloatware after Microsoft bought it. By then, whatever mindshare Discord didn't take, Zoom did.
Never used any food delivery service. I can't justify spending 30-40 dollars for a 10 dollar hamburger
It's still expensive the customer.
I don't use any of those delivery services, they're just too expensive, it's not a viable option. The only ones that work are those run by the restaurants themselves.
I've been waiting years for this episode.
OMG I totally skyped my life 😅
John Oliver every night would be something
Felix Biederman... ya gotta stop ordering single slices of cake on door dash 😂
I’m still trying to figure out whether or not to leave a tip when the restaurant charges a driver fee plus service fee anyone else care to share
Look, I also live in a country where tipping is a way of life, and as a decent human you tip; however, why are you holding the customer accountable, rather than putting the onus on the delivery company (or restaurant, when applicable) to pay their workers a living wage? They can certainly afford it much more than the average customer in the current global economic climate, based on the amount they  spent lobbying, and it creates security for families to know how much money they will have for food at the end of the month. Pay your staff. I pay my gardener (who comes once a week) even on the days he can't work, when it is raining. If the person is available to render a service to you / do your bidding you pay them, as simple as that.
The last time I ordered pizza they charged me $32. For a medium pepperoni pizza. Gees.
Loved seeing the full episode before it got pulled. Keep up the shenanigans.
Gay parts in movies should go to the best actors not just cuz your gay that's selection racism an I'm openly gay
100% with everything you said but we need to back WAY UP - leaches have WHAT?
Idk, calling with an order is sooo much easier than fumbling with some unresponsive app. People have been sounding the alarm about these companies for YEARS now. Please, for the love of god, cut out these middlemen if you can.
My daughter delivers for DoorDash and she was reading off tips to me the other day and it's like every fifth person gives her a tip.  It's crazy.  If I can't afford to tip, I figure I can't afford to order.
Bottom line restraunts typically don't charge enough to cover cost of workers and fees. A tip shouldn't even be a thing.
i have not, nor will i ever use any of these apps.  im a disabled vet, and at my local panda express there are 2 handicapped parking spaces.  these drivers think they are their parking spaces.  i no longer will eat at or from panda express.
No company should be big enough cover the entire US, just flat out, but I feel like if this service was run in individual states or by state governments it would be a great step forward. Cause it IS a useful service, probably not for the 20% of people who are just too lazy to learn how to cook, but in the cases that John mentioned
This has nothing to do with the episode, but when did getting high and using drugs turn into something positive for the "left"? I still don't get it. It's one thing to not jailing people for smoking weed, but to sell it as something positive is stupid.
Im glad to say i have not once used these apps. Food is already way too expensive i dont need a delivery fee that doesnt even go to the driver ontop of that.
My problem is I use Uber Eats WAY too much. It's soooo expensive, but I work from home in the evenings, and my wife works full-time during the day! Neither of us feel like cooking for dinner time.
Realistically these delivery apps should be allowed to fail.  They gave it a go with this new business model but it just doesn’t work, it can’t turn a profit after many many years.  The answer isn’t tip bigger, it’s tip less so the business model is not dependent on it and price the service accordingly.  If people don’t want to pay more for the delivery service then maybe this whole thing just doesn’t make business sense in its current form.
Yasss
me watching this while i wait for my grubhub
That delivery driver working for the  restaurant also did work, when not delivering.
"keep prices low for consumers", ordering on any of these apps almost always doubles the price unless you get something big
Never used one of these stupid apps
You didn't even mention the ghost kitchens they set up
Hard disagree with the idea consumers are winning here.  Most people don’t realize how much more they’re paying for the convenience because the apps don’t make it clear.
I'm a dasher and uber eats driver and I felt this video. Please tip your driver and we shouldn't be indepedent contractors. The doordash TOS and algorithm is all bullshit
22:07 That's really sad for us. HP is not the same anymore. 😅
John Oliver deserves an monument to truth and justice
I'm old, disabled, miles from anywhere and I'd pay dearly for restaurant food delivery. Ain't happening.. I'm lucky I can get Amazon food delivered. Where's those freakin drones everyone was yapping about?
Grubhub....  grap grap
I salute delivery drivers. Braver than cops braver than the military. 🫡 they actually give back to their community. Always tip them good. If you work for a delivery service of any kind even if you’re just a delivery driver for a pizza place I love you. Stay safe out there. Fuck delivery apps for making u work in shitty conditions with little to no pay.
Sweetheart. You don't look like you confiscated anything. You look like you snitched. But we still love you.
WHY CAN A COMOANY AFFECT THE LAW!?!?! That's the problem with the US, LEGALIZED BRIBES.
I used to be a delivery driver once. But then I took a 1 Star to the knee...  The amount of time I worked making up for just 2 low star ratings out of 500 orders delivered. Sheesh. It messed with my income for weeks. I was basically forced to drive to the tipless side of town where dreams of a new life were on the street in stilettos. At that point I knew I wasn't any better and my delivery pimp was taking most of my living wage.  So glad this story is getting attention it deserves. For all the drivers out there. You are the life blood of this country. Thank you.
Imagine if order receipts were actually itemized fully and accurately: +Regular item price +Delivery fee +App surcharge restaurant has to add to cover cost to be on app +App service fees, just because +Tax +Tip, because delivery fee is not a tip  Guess how long they'll last once people actually see how much more it costs to order from the delivery app.
Deliveroo is so scummy. They slashed the prices by 300% in wages. Around here I would cycle 8km there and 8km back and they paid me 5 euro. 2 years before it was 12. Disgusting. No holidays. No perks. It's just shit.
As a DoorDash "Dasher" (their word not mine) on a bicycle. I have discovered those ordering food from the richest neighborhoods or the most expensive condos are the worst tippers. They often choose not to tip at all. While the people with the lowest means have always been the best at tipping, often tipping in the app and giving a few dollars in cash.
Trusting a group of people who care the least to deliver your food unmolested probably gets you the exact results you deserve. Enjoy!
I used Doordash once. The restaurant I was getting take out from only accepted cash, and I had none. They told me that I could pay with a card if I ordered my food from them on Doordash, which I did... and I'm never gonna do it again. I paid an extra $10 for my food just to pick it up myself. All these food delivery apps are a huge scam. I'm not sure why people like being scammed so much.
No a tyranny of an algorithm isn't worse.  It's vastly better because you do not have to worry about an algorithm trying to avoid rules, nor is it particularly difficult to improve algorithms and the improvements once made can be locked in and verified.  Human bosses will never improve, they will always be terrible human beings.  Is this probably a bad algorthm?  Sure.  Can it be replaced or improved?  Yes.  Eventually you can get it to be a well developed mature algorithm that is easily verified.  You'll never make any such improvements on human bosses.
I love your show. Please NEVER stop.
I need a deep dive into the cost of childcare in this country.
This service is a convenience, a luxury really. These companies should charge customers enough to pay the drivers a livable wage. If I want takeout, I call the restaurant to place the order and pick it up myself. I refuse to participate in the exploitation of others so I can eat at home in my pajamas.
"Lose 100s of millions of dollars, even billions ..." ............ Where's that money again? OH RIGHT! All on make believe paper. So not real. Just lip speak. And anyhow, how the fuck can a company "lose 100s of millions of dollars" yet still exist. There's not actually anyone in the entire chain that has even remotely that much money. So it's all a load of shit from the get-go.
for some disabled people food delivery apps are not about convenience, its about the difference between eating and not.
They completely forgot about my biggest pet peeve about these apps: by inundating your favorite dine-in restaurants with delivery orders, they completely %^*&$ up the experience of actually dining out at these places. Longer waits for food, overtaxed kitchens, and frantic staff trying to not get penalized by the apps for taking too long to fulfil orders.
I mean the Millennial lifestyle subsidy is offensive but appropriate, if by subsidy you mean massively inflating the price by adding useless ventire capitalist middlemen who blame lazy Millennials for not being able to afford the inflated cost even with a "subsidy" cuz they got avocado toast once in college. I'd call that more of a deathspiral than a subsidy, but tomato tomahto.
My sister passed away after getting hit by a deer while working for door dash...no payout.
"Doesn't make/never made" happened to my spot. .
This and the general "gig economy" bullshit makes me think of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle."
We almost never have food delivered - prefer pick up. Our experience with drivers has been often being met with someone who seems frustrated, angry or just otherwise not pleasant. Oliver shows us why.   As much as I deplore these apps, they’re built into the business models of many eateries. Trying to circumvent these apps, I’ve tried directly calling to place orders. Some don’t even pick up the phone anymore. I get it as dealing with a phone call takes a person away from their work. Those that answer the phone will often say that they’d rather to-go orders be made using one of the order apps on their website - sometimes they’ll tell you which is preferred.   Order app prices are often priced higher than the stated prices on their physical menu boards and takeout menus. The markups vary - sometimes between a buck or two but I’ve experienced markups of over 33% for having to order online.   As for these order/delivery apps claiming that they’re losing money? Assuming they’re being truthful 😂😂😂, these companies are often operating “fat, dumb and happy” as money is being made hand-over-fist. And a half decent accountant can funnel, redirect or hide revenue in endless ways before the number hits the bottom line.
My favorite restaurant is a locally owned and operated business that does gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches and a rotating selection of craft beers and they used to do delivery (of sandwiches of course not beer) via Eat Street, but they had to quit because Eat Street was requiring a 30% discount on their food on top of charging customers a $5 delivery fee and making the store pay for the credit card transaction fees that all restaurants have to pay, only they were charging a higher rate the owner himself had negotiated for his in-store sales!   They use freakin' gourmet ingredients so their food is very expensive to make, but they also want to keep it affordable.... so their actual profit is very low.   Thing is, that 30% was cutting into their profits and they were actually taking a loss on delivery orders.  Sure, they could have passed that 30% discount as a 30% increase on delivered food costs, but they didnt want to do that to their customers, so they canceled delivery.
I was delivering door dash new years eve, some guy shot up my vehicle(police report filed) door dash literally did nothing.
it's hard because busy working parents and disabled people are also demographics that may not have the disposable income to pay more fees and higher tips. Like we live in a country that demands many disabled people live in unsustainable poverty or lose the healthcare and resources they need to survive. federally, on SSI, you can't have more than 2000 dollars. no one in new york can live on that. no one in most of the country can. Also, because this country hates poor people, you can't even use EBT for hot food. Instacart has grocery stores, including Aldi which allows EBT in some places, but the tips and fees can't come out of that. It's a mess.
I stopped eating out when prices took off. I've never used one of these ridiculously expensive delivery services. Y'all just got money to throw away now?
In germany if you get hit by a car whilst on a job you are actually insured much better then in privat life via the "Berufsgenossenschaft". I feel for that guy still working with a broken leg
If the delivery drivers aren’t happy with the money they’re making prior to tips, that’s an issue for them to settle with the company, not the customer. The customer is not responsible for how much an employee makes.
I've been a delivery driver most of my adult life and believe me, this just grazes the surface of the bullshit. My last food delivery job, I was employed by the restaurant itself and was told evening drivers were making about $50 a night. Right after I started, so did UberEats. Some nights I would just be making food the whole time and watching it walk out the door. When I got run off the road on my bicycle in Chicago, I went back to the store when I left the ER and asked if I could go home for the day. I was back the next morning with a giant fat, scabbed up lip and cuts and bruises all over. You would not believe how many people don't tip on huge orders or in INSANE weather. It's truly disgusting. THE DELIVERY CHARGE DOES NOT GO TO THE DRIVER.
“who escaped their evangelical upbringing and found happiness” nope, false, true Christianity brings everlasting joy 🤍
We own a restaurant. We have to charge more for delivery food because the delivery app charges us 37% of the whole sale.
You got to fucking tip? No, John, you don't. They should pay a livable wage from the delivery fee they charge.
Occasional delivery driver here,  Most people don’t tip! 95% don’t. I only do it when money is tight but yeah it’s crazy, please tip.
When I delivered for Uber Eats you would often at night pull up at a restaurant and see that it was closed. You could cancel, but then you don't get paid and it would hurt your standing just like a bad review. You could also call tech support, but that was a time consuming process to get them to acknowledge that you're telling the truth and then you're only paid a few dollars. Other times the restaurant won't treat you any different from a regular customer which slows you down and could lead to bad review or at the very least reduce the amount of deliveries you can make to get paid. Doing regular Uber and Lyft is much better, and that's another topic that John Oliver could do as well.
I'm an independent professional commercial photographer.  Grubhub and Ubereats photoshoots have been a massive part of my business for several years, and helped keep my business alive during the shutdown of the last few years because other work in my area has been very difficult for me to obtain.  However, the rates that the apps pay is generally less than what is now normal for professional commercial photography (Doordash wanted to pay less than half of what the other two were already paying, so I said no to them).  I don't know what they are charging the restaurants for the photoshoots, but you can be darned sure that it's more than what they are paying me, and I refuse to believe that they aren't charging the restaurants for photoshoots.  A lot of the photoshoots where I'm assigned, the assignments are left as unscheduled, and I find quite a lot of the restaurant owners are very reluctant to have me in to photograph the food because unless that food has been already sold to a customer and is immediately served to that customer after I photograph it (I make sure that waitstaff let the customers know that the food is being photographed on its way to them from the kitchen, allowing the customers to opt-out), the restaurant cannot legally sell it (and yes, my work policy is that I never touch the food until it is my food that is going into my mouth, but I can't say the same for any other photographers).  So the restaurant owner will often see this kind of advertising cost as not useful to them and will stall scheduling my one-hour photoshoot assignment for a very long time (I've had a few in my area stall for almost two whole years).  I don't get any payment at all unless and until I deliver photos from a photoshoot for the app, and I only get paid for the number of photos that I deliver, regardless of how long it took to communicate with the restaurant, how much I had to spend on gas and highway tolls to get to the photoshoot, or how long the photoshoot took at the restaurant.  Also, if I arrive on time for an appointment and the restaurant is not ready and needs to reschedule, I can only submit a late reschedule fee request (if I was hired directly by the restaurant, it would not be a request, but a contracted fee) once per restaurant, no matter how many times the owners reschedule.  And I've found that to get anywhere near enough photoshoot assignments to maintain my business, I need to make my working radius very wide, and will frequently have to drive for three or four hours to get to the photoshoot locations; I have driven to every corner of my state and halfway across four neighboring states for these assignments, such as driving to Green Bay, WI, one day, then down to Davenport, Iowa, the next day, followed by Chicago and Minneapolis on the next two days, and none of those cities are where I live.  Yes, about half the time I get to take food home with me, but I have yet to form any meaningful business relationships with any of the restaurant owners I've met while doing these assignments, and that's not for a lack of trying.  Please tip the drivers who deliver your food, but remember that there is no tip field anywhere in the app for the photographer who made the photograph that appears next to the menu item in the app.
Restaurants should just make these services pay full price. Period
How about everyone just stop using these apps? Gig workers are much better off with part time jobs that offer guaranteed money, potential to advance, and sometimes offer affordable health care.
Based on what John Oliver covered in this video, I can safely say, or remind others in case they didn't know or forgot, that the solution is to just wear a mask and go out to eat at a restaurant, or go to a grocery store to buy food to make meals. Food Delivery Apps should only be used once or twice a week, not three times a day. The only people who would have any excusable incentive to *rely* on Food Delivery Apps are elderly and/or disabled people who have to stay confined to their living spaces, much less their beds. At least Millennials are making enough money to exploit Food Delivery Apps, but younger generations cannot afford to do that, and not all of them are (still) doing as well as almost all of Millennials. It's also not a good sign if Food Delivery App Companies are buying up other smaller companies like them. If a company makes more money and is more popular than another company, then the solution is not to buy it up, but consult with members of the company to figure out how improvements can be made so both companies benefit without any sacrifices having to be made. I know it's become the norm of America's free market economy, but I won't be surprised if what Food Delivery App Companies, like Doordash and Grub Hub, are doing right now with smaller companies, like Seamless, will one day come back to bite them in the a**. Anyways, that's my two cents on this matter.
I'm too broke to order from delivery apps. I'll just go pick it up . If I can't, I guess I'll make something at home or Starve!
Bottom friendly menu. Wtf
I worked at a pizza place that went into bankruptcy because of delivery apps. They had lots of orders but barely made a profit. Grubhub took 20% commission plus a fixed $0.25 per order, without any ads or special services. So they tried to get away. They built their own website so you could order and pay online with cheaper prices. They offered additional discounts for ordering on the phone or picking up the food. But people kept choosing the app. It was maddening to watch. In the end, with grocery prices skyrocketing, they had no choice but to significantly raise prices which slashed their customer base.  Another big issue was that they didn’t let us refuse individual orders. You could either mark the restaurant as “closed” or you had to take every order with a maximum timeframe of 90 minutes. This made planning super difficult. Cause you might be perfectly able to do x amount of orders and deliver on time if they come one after the other but not if you get 5 at the same time. Or if one’s to a remote area. I worked the phone and to cancel specific orders I had to call each customer, then call Grubhub, then confirm the cancellation on our device. Or I had to call people up to confirm a delivery later than 90 minutes. No one has time for that when you’re already at capacity. So we usually tried to somehow fulfill every order often resulting in longer wait times, annoyed customers, bad reviews and the employees working at their limit. But the alternative would’ve been to completely close down the app during the busiest hours which is just not possible when you’re already operating on such a narrow profit margin.  All that is to say - if your favourite place has another option to order please use it, it really helps them out!
I’m watching this while Doordashing 😂
Kamala Harris' husband was behind the Prop 22 debacle. Just saying.
I've dashed quite a bit (over 2000 deliveries). The tips make or break you. Minimum you'll get from door dash is $2.50 per delivery. The farther away, that will increase. Most I remember was a place that was probably 15 miles away, and I got $11 from door dash. Tips can generally be low too. Anything over $5 is on the "better" end. When I started, didn't realize how much area made a difference too. Worst area I was in, 33% of the orders had 0 tip.
Delivery apps definitely take advantage of restaurants. But restaurants also take advantage of their own staff by treating them poorly and paying them crappy wages based on tips. So I don't feel a whole lot of sympathy for most restaurants either.
I'm aware of a few places around me who offered free delivery through their own site to incentivize ordering there instead of the delivery apps. I also know the apps have set up sites and domains that look exactly like the restaurant's own site, to still trick people into ordering from them. Once again something that started out good has turned the entire industry to shit
The orphanage bit was incredible
golden oppertunity what about a app that delivers the orphans too you no need  for back ground  checks  we already have a dozen preorders from ted bundy
I forgot John was a horse fucker. Another thing we have in common.
I fail to see how all customers across-the-board are winners. What about the significant overheads that one has to pay for compared to going down to the restaurant and picking it up personally? And the environmental impact? Yes, some people and some situations need this service but what about the majority? Surely, someone else is the winner.
another issue with minimum wage (at least grubhub) is that to qualify for it, workers need to meet some high standards. Grubhub guarantees a minimum wage, however workers must be 1. constantly located in ever changing "hotspots", which means moving your car around to different parking lots to sit. 2. They must accept EVERY order, even orders far away that don't tip and would cost me more in gas. 3. They need to be online for a minimum of two hours, accepting all orders in that time and never going offline.
“Raw dogging the air” is priceless! 😂
These apps charge for customers for a fee to use the app and a delivery fee for the driver. Why are they taking a cut out of the restaurants sales?
Just make it easy for yourself and order from the restaurants directly, or pick it up yourself. Don't use the apps, and you won't need to tip
10:34 *WHERE?!* IN Animal Crossing?!
Have never and will never use any of these services. It's just a shitty business model.
​@radaro.9682 I don't see why it couldn't mean both? 😂
I haven't done DoorDash in recent years, but back when I did we had this thing called a Red Card that DoorDash gave us to pay for a customer's order. (At the time, this was very rare and only happened with large chain restaurants like Taco Bell.) We would get a customer's order, then go place the order the customer wanted and pay with Red Card and proceed to wait. I always hated these orders, they took too much time when I probably could have done an extra 2-3 orders but instead I'm hear getting the bare minimum and whatever tip was left. But that makes sense that these restaurants might not have been agreed upon by that particular franchise. (Maybe the company said yes, but the franchise said no.) But I always tell the counter, "This is a DoorDash order, they want..." and proceed to order. Usually they don't have an issue cause a customer is a customer. As long as it's still paid for.  I will say that one of the good things about being an IC is after paying out your annual taxes, I still got back from both state and Federal. One of the best things at the start of the year was taxes for me. Not doing them, just still being able to receive back.  The 2 best tips I got though was delivering to large house and the dude coming out and was like "got change for a 20?" and I honestly didn't and just told me to keep it. The other time was another rich home, and the order was literally only a single order of edamame appetizer. They tipped me like 20, for a 5 mile drive. Mom answers the door and was like "that's all the girls ordered?" shrugged it off and closed the door.
You know books are being fudged or they're spending frivolously when they charge the customer AND the restaurant and still aren't making money.
10:40
LOL, Skype pulled a Sears.
We barely used these apps during the pandemic. We did use grocery store deliveries but they were hired BY the store. It was the store offering the service.  And even to this day, I've maybe used these services less than 5 times, and will continue to avoid using them so long as I have a car or a means to get my own food.   Also, Millennial here with a family, large home, way too many toys and none of that typical millennial excuse. Why? Didnt get anything from my parents.  No, i did grocery store work. Best buy. And then i got tired of that, taught myself a coding language and woroed my way up from small roles to now making way more than i ever thought id ever make in my life as a self employed data engineer with more work than i know what to do with.  Happy AF too and what i do isnt my passion. My passion is my wife and family. Sometimes, just find something thats fun, even if it isnt a passion that makes money.
His stoner voice sounds like a husky lesbian
I remember moving to the city with my wife about 3 years ago. Prior to that I had been living in a fairly rural town where we didn’t have Uber or Grubhub because the town was too small to support them. My wife on the other hand had lived here for years and was used to it so she was surprised that I didn’t know about any of this.   It took very little digging to discover this is almost certainly a bubble. Venture capital firms pump in enormous amounts of money with the goal of becoming the only option available in the new space. This leads to absurd valuations with the expectation of either winning the war with other companies doing the same thing or seeing a lucrative exit. Eventually this money will run out and we’ll all go back to doing things the way we have in the past. I really don’t see this lasting another 10 years.
I've never used these apps. I just call or order online and pick it up if I'm not gong to the actual restaurant to sit down. This stuff just doesnt make sense and see no reason to not just pick up. Companies that force me to use their apps lose my interest in going there.
John’s joke about student loans reminded me I need to pay mine today
We never used a food delivery app.
Is pride synonymous with hyper Sexuality. What is love?.. anyways.. back to the topic..
Skype didn't drop the ball. It is owned by Microsoft, and I'm sure everyone's aware of Teams by now. So obviously Teams was much more work orientated and MS didn't want to have unnecessary competition, so Skype was left to rot.
YES! I agree the devil played better! Glad you brought it up!
I've never used any of these delivery apps.
I had to pause the video to finish wheezing with laughter over "Numbers Being Yelled At You with Human Squidward"
The hungry howies by me (maybe all of them) charges $6.00 delivery fee now. $5 of it goes to HH corporate. The driver gets $1 . This is on top of doubling the price of pizza in the last 2 years. This is corporate greed. Now I make all my own pizzas.
Nah, the devil cheated by bringing in the band of demons; the contest was to see who was the best *fiddle player*, not the best band leader or sound design expert or whatever. Giving Johnny the win was the devil's best chance at avoiding an embarrassing round of arbitration!
The restaurants lose money.  The apps lose money.  The customers pay inflated prices, plus delivery, plus tip. The drivers are cheated and someday, hopefully, if it all works out, the customers will start being cheated too. Gotta love capitalism* *somebody is getting rich as fuck, just not the users or employees
I have never used any of these apps and never will. F em in the A.

13:10 how out of touch and full of shit is this guy 😂
Calling the whole state of CA dumb sheep (implying people weren't smart enough to understand prop 22) is a bold move for this show, lets see how it works out.
No, you don't have to tip. It's optional and appreciated when done but not a requirement of your order.   The only reason I see that people push others to tip is because it's easier for them than pushing the lawmakers to make actual change to a fair wage.
Fun fact: the people at major chains who bag your food and hand it off to delivery drivers technically work a tipped position with a lower minimum wage per hour BUT the apps have no way built in to tip them, meaning that no matter how well you tip your delivery driver there’s someone handling your food working for tips who isn’t getting a penny from you
It's crazy it is considered normal that you have to tip, rather than making sure the jobs pay a living wage.
All that was mentioned is why I will never use a food app.
I stopped using delivery apps when I realized it was usually more than doubling the cost of the food. So, I want a $12 meal, and to get it delivered it's going to cost me $25 minimum. It will take me 15 minutes or so, to get the food myself. Is my time worth, what works out to, $48 an hour?
where world has gone wrong is that side gig or side hustle is to earn extra income like students used to work in McD for extra money to spend. it cannot be an add on job to make ends meet.
In europe you get 1000€ working 12 hours at a food app if you live alone
How are the customers getting the benefit when delivery from the app is more expensive at base and so comes out with tip and fees 2.5 times what you actually paid for in the initial total?
Wish John Oliver would be able to use his platform to actually do this topic justice instead of a 30 minute speed run of the basic criticisms from an outsiders perspective using publically available testimony...
I used to work at a restaurant that was unknowingly signed up for DoorDash and the menu they uploaded was for the other location that carried completely different items! People would always order the things we didn't make and it was super hard to fix and resulted in some bad reviews. DoorDash made it impossible at the time to contact customers so we would have to contact DoorDash to get them to talk to the customer for us, and despite our complaints, they still didn't change the menu. They're the woooooorst.
No tips. Enough.
I put myself through college waitressing and relied heavily on tips because I only made about half of the minimum wage from the restaurants. So I know the importance of tipping. The tips on the DD app are so low that I often double or triple the tip because I know DD drivers pay for their gas and maintenance of their vehicles. I am disabled and rely heavily on DD drivers so it benefits me to give good tips and good ratings for the drivers. Now, if some of the restaurants would put out better food, life would be grand!
No, we were not paid as employees. We were forced to use the company car, and pay for gas, even if our vehicle had better fuel efficiency. We were listed as 1099 workers. We wernt put on insurance. We couldn't eat during the job. We smoked outside your house. We had to pay for our uniforms. And, we couldn't get a second job.  As a delivery driver, door dash lets us set our own hours, use our own vehicle, reject low paying jobs, and advertise for restaurants that ACTUALLY want the orders.  And, giving out samples from places like pharoes donuts, strange donuts, alibi cookies, & the chicken out.  We were already called contracted workers and didnt get health care at least as good as Medicare. At least now i can eat and smoke in the car.  And, by the way; at least in the STL, we CHOSE to drive in hazardous weather. People who live here know which streets flood and which dont. And, tornados dont effect this city the way they do the country areas. The hazardous weather just gives us bonus pay.  Maybe grubhub is bad, but, your not going to hell for ordering doordash in a flash flood in st. Louis. Oliver needs to get a grip here.  I can make a hundred & 20 in six hours on doordash. My average is 90.  I believe i speak for everyone for doesn't live there, when i say; i dont CARE ANY MORE, about people in California, new york, texas, or Florida.  All three of those states are insain outliers, that dont reflect anything the midwest, mimal states, or industrial states go through.  Till then, you ain't living in AMERICAS REALITY mr. Oliver, your living in our PARODY. : (
I just went back to ordering from the restaurant
There was one time I gave a driver a 1 star review and that was when that driver had been assigned my orders several times and delivered to a building 6 blocks away each time. No other drivers had that problem.
the devil absolutely booms johnny btw, i mean its not even fuckin close
More like Grab-Hub
Yeah, the backpacks are exactly like *HUGE moving boxes with straps!* Bon Appetit!
19:54 - That's 21st century economy in a nutshell.
5:50 O M G  XD
Jhon says : you have to tip , but if you don't , the delivery is gonna bail off their jobs , therefore food companies are gonna start to compromise with better salaries . Because nobody works to lose money
"You have to tip" but why can't the delivery fee that we're already paying actually go to the delivery driver?!
❤Thank you John. You ARE going to heaven lol ❤
These apps are so parasitic.... I tried not to use them
My local pizza shop, around 2 miles away, gave us an enormous stack of $15 off your next order in exchange for not using a food delivery app.
Sorry, John, I have to disagree with you this time.  The Devil violated the terms of the contest by bringing in all those demons to back him.
Clicking on this video hoping it will shame me out if my horrible doordash habit
We won't get rid of companies relying on subsidized wages through tipping if we keep tipping.
Somehow every time when i hear Grubhub i think of another internet platform which is orange and rhymes with cornhub
0:50 SERIOUSLY?!
real ones already watched the full episode when it came out on this channel on accident
In other words, if you are voting on it, READ IT FIRST.  Dont care what it is, read the damn thing!
The person who ordered one slice of cake probably is a diabetic and isn't allowed to eat more.
Yeah i was one of the few thousands who got treated to this full episode on youtube in the first minutes after it was uploaded. I clicked on it 6 minutes after it was available so i was prolly one of the last to see it for free on YT. ^_^
Eff millenials and their "subsidy" -  Gen X.
Am I the only one who hates tipping culture in general?
Have never used one of these apps and never will. They wreak of entitlement and laziness, IMO, especially when wankers order hundreds of dollars of groceries and then refuse to tip. No thanks; I've got a car and two working arms - I can make my food myself.
"The restaurant agreed to those fees up front and 58% is an outlier." Kind of a contradiction there, Grubhub.
I always call the restaurant for delivery. I’ve completely stopped using these apps. I don’t think convenience is worth the price of exploitation and empowering more and more techno-oligarchs.
We tried food delivery app once - they didn't even pick up half the order so I had to go and pick up the rest.  We either pick it up or the restaurant has to have their own drivers.
Running these giant businesses supposedly at a loss is like a supersized version of what a lot of households do, run a "business" as a loss to get a break on their taxes. And yet...these corporations still have hundreds of millions of dollars to lobby government and I bet every one of the executives gets paid a massive salary.
We live within 5-10 minutes of just about every fast food place. Yet my oldest will get delivery because she doesn’t want to drive anywhere. Ok, I guess. #2 & #3 daughters don’t drive so rather than beg me for a ride, they order. At least it’s not every day they do this. If they have a group of friends at the house, I’d rather just go pick it up myself than have them spend the money. My husband will also use DD or GH rather than drive around the corner. 🤷🏽‍♀️  I don’t use those apps; it’s too expensive. I will use the store’s app to order for pickup though. One restaurant near us uses a different system for ordering online but they have their own driver to do it AND there’s no delivery fee. I don’t mind tipping that guy extra.  I know my girls tip through DoorDash or whoever.
The least cringe jokes of any episode. Well done
My understanding is that Uber etc work like the other tech platforms (Airbnb, Spotify...) where making a profit doesn't matter. Stock value is what matters. In fact when they have cash on hand, these companies spend billions on stock buyback, raising the value of the stock, and making shareholders and high rank executives richer (since the latter's bonuses are tied to stock price). These companies love to go on about how they don't make a profit as an excuse for not sharing the wealth. But the ultra rich aren't counting on profit and would rather not make money via taxed dividends. And instead of selling off investments for cash and incurring capital gains tax, they take out loans using company stock as collateral. Buy, borrow, die.
I'm guilty of taking an Uber but then I won't remember to rate and tip until it pops up the next time I order an Uber. So YES I rate & tip it may take me a week 😂😂😂. Sorry guys 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Had I any idea of the truth of these things i wouldn't have utilized these at all during covid. No friggin wonder restaurants hate it
Used to be a Dasher. Took crumby orders, carved out a five star reputation, unlocked premium orders. Was making around $50ph. Then I got t-boned at an intersection. Was nice while it lasted
I just order directly from the restaurant if I can. Much cheaper, and they receive all of the money.
Another victim of this is the servers/bartenders of participating restaurants- typically having to ignore or neglect in-person tables to go bag up food for deliveries. In-person tables (the source of servers income) have a negative experience, tip less, and deliveries don’t benefit or pay the servers/bartenders in any way. Those employees often get punished for turning off the tablets, trying to slow orders, or get verbally abused by delivery drivers in order to rush it along.  One of the biggest invisible reasons service has gone downhill for the past few years.
This episode has banger jokes
I ran restaurants.  I remember when Groupon was the big thing.  I read the fine print and told them to pound sand.  Was the same kind of rip off. Restaurant owners have a choice not to use these services.  The compliant about these percentages:  Its in the agreement that YOU SIGNED.  A capitalist company is out to get your money?  Well no shit!
Used to work front desk at a hotel before and after Expedia, and there was a lot of the same issues. They listed amenities we didn't have, send us reservation requests when we were all booked, and then demand the hotel find other accommodations for the client or face a huge fine. They took 25%, and offered further promotions on top of it. They had gold membership they didn't tell us about, and when those members showed up for check in, they'd be furious we didn't automatically upgrade...something...with their reservation.  Anyway, I couldn't agree more with John on the "Devil Went Down to Georgia". The Devil and his band of demons kicked Johnny's ass. Don't know why the Devil bowed out like a little bitch.
I’ve never got shit delivered from these Apps because of this thing that saves more money and calories: Cooking at home!!! John, thanks for making me ignore these apps more!!!
My take away from this? Tip in cash people.
Great Video as always! John Oliver is hilarious. However, When are they going to talk about all the scheduling cuts that most of the delivery workers (if not all of them) in all apps are having issues with? My dad started working for DD about 4 years ago, of course while the pandemic was going on as many of the people who decided to join this apps for an alternative way of earning life. Now with this "minimum wage" my dad notices that his pay was cut in about 50%. Why? because he can't get an schedule for more than 1h per location, and even worst is that on this single hour it takes about 30 minutes to actually make an order (if any pops up). Not really sure the real reason for this minimum wage was for without regulations and guarantees for open schedule as it used to be.
John might be the only Gen X that doesn't blame Millenials for everything 😂 "Millennial Lifestyle Subsidy"??? Most of the drivers are Millenials most of the customers are not! How do you blame Millenials for an app created by Gen X?
There’s a gaping hole in this story. He never addressed what the executives in these companies are making.
In what world are delivery services cheaper than what they're worth? a 12$ chipotle burrito is 15$ before any fees are added. Everything is more expensive on the apps.
I never ever used any of these ridiculous services. Buy local and order local. Kinda easy.
CEOs are so out of touch with its workforce.....also an ORPHANAGES😂😂
Guess where all the doordash’s profit is being spent. On hustler casino live
Sounds like the Amazon business model, look at the early years of Amazon.
Never once have I used an Uber/Lyft, or doorbash/whatever else there is and also will never.
10:45 Of course Jim Cramer is in this fucking story
compared with the Boeing episode this is 👌on fire lolz 😂even with the dirty jokes i was on the ground laughing 😂out loud also 👍on LGBTQIA+ joke's some i truly trying not laughing out but couldn't help myself   spot on ron and harry in the book's as well as hurminny drank potions to swapping places's and genders ( born intersexual, forced-husband-role's/unethically so i can kinda understand the book/chapters, plus i end up dating/marriage pollyaoumry/marriage-typical type BI-female's, also a possible plot-line misted but it's still okay ish without being Polyandry/and-or-ish ( and the bigger miss is not letting the female caricature's that felt/read like bi or lesbian or polly/swinger curiosity exploring ( even if that equality to deciding their straight and monogamous+marriage or proffer being single etc aka uniquely them self's ) there identity's better as the 4th~ book mentioned herminy going on date/dance ( plus kissing ect ? or my memory plus my OG-print references as some are currently changed like straight-blonde hair is not mahogany+super afro/curly, and for hurminy's parent's/DNA usa/uk sorta unlikey/common-place for DNA-types as generally the more curly hair the more likely it's jet-black or grey/white from old-age, and no magic was mentioned to get it etc ) with choe-chang/others, sorry it's been years since i read the 1-14th~book series ) but might be better if it hadn't fallen under the classic/over-used~ love-triangle failure-plot-line ) ect, so makes you wonder what JK was ( personally my 2c someone should out her as she's/jk probably got some self discovery/hate to her self or someone who she-cares-about and is queer, but do it in a nice/outing way as im not for payback/revenge just mostly as please stop hurting others uk 🇬🇧 or in the USA 🇺🇸  ) thinking 💭🤔if she really hates bi's, ,polly's and transfem's/born-intersexuality plus ( my hot take alibis dumbldoor as a gay-monogamous ( or failure straight man, less so for bad-writing, and fitting better but not as well. as bi + polly fits better off my-2C's ) was lazy writing as his caricature as i was reading OG/2000's and plus-nowadays feels much more like a ACE spectrum or BI and or polly and had she fleshed that out more in a non-sexualised/R-way's it could have been rather enjoyable/entertainment and healthy/helpful to me in that "veggie town" i was raised in/around etc ) gay-Male's??? and yes she damaged and still is damaging her/jk reputation and advocating for dangerous behaviour's some i shamefully did against my best interests as a teenager
19:17 No, I don't think I will. I'm already paying a delivery fee, I'm not paying more. I'd rather get in my car, pollute the air and add to the bad traffic.
24:00 absolute insanity to refer to Flightline as “this horse”. He’s genuinely one of the fastest and most proven horses alive, and is practically the second coming of Secretariat. In terms of racing, Flightline is the *best* horse.
The solution is extremely obvious: food trucks. Brings the restaurant to _you._
You gonna be paying $50 to get that big Mac meal delivered by one of these apps soon 😂
It's hilarious that these companies are losing money, because all I see is a ripoff as a customer. These app services have too much overhead. They routinely take a $20 order for chicken wings and turn it into a $45 bill. Tipping the driver $6 on a $20 order would've been seen as a relatively good tip and everyone would've been fine. The driver would be happy. The restaurant would be happy. I would be happy and I'd have more money leftover to order food there more frequently. Letting Grubhub be the middleman here to jack up prices, wreck the industry, abuse their workers AND lose money all at the same time is a fucking joke.
I’ve never used any food delivery app and never will. Leeches.
I hate food delivery companies! I didnt need them before and I dont need them now!
So I am likely behind on on my pop culture (I just don't care enough) . . . But why don't we like Harry Potter again?
I'm glad i stopped driving before the pandemic.
Living in a 3rd world country is hard.
Working for Doordash was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had, and it was an attempt to support myself through college with a bad class schedule which meant I could only work at night. It cost around 20 cents per mile just in gas, and I couldn't make much more than $1 per mile, which isn't even counting my time! I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy
"I'm like Ms Piggy the way I'm hittin that green" 😂😂
What could be wrong with delivery apps, I thought. A fucking lot, it turns out.  Keep up the great work, John! (and team!)
Johnny definitely beat the devil, and the devil knew it!
Surprised they didn't go into how irrationally expensive it is to have food delivered.  I used to get food delivered as a kid back in the 80s and 90s, and I delivered pizza and wings in the late 90s and early 00s.  My typical tip was around 10% of the order, and prices were consistent whether it was pickup or delivery.  I just checked out how much it would cost for a Chipotle burrito.  Ordering online for pickup via their website it's $11.85.  Ordering via Uber Eats with a 15% tip (the smallest option other than a custom tip) is $25.31!!!  I do pretty well for myself but paying more than double is just outrageous.  I always just pick up my food these days.  I can be there and back in 20 minutes.  Delivery is just robbery.
One other aspect here is to consider that none of these workers are contributing to the Social Security pool, which may it make even more difficult in the future to cover payments. Surprised John Oliver's team missed that, but perhaps I am wrong about this.
As a CONSUMER, I try to avoid patronizing these delivery apps (I have only used them when I have a gift card). The menu prices on the app have LONG been higher than the standard menu. It's not a new thing at all. Then there are all the extra fees, at least four or so of them that get tacked on BEFORE TIP. And then I try to give drivers CASH tip but there is no way to put that in on the website and I notice my orders took a while because I guess people though they weren't getting tipped so they didn't want accept my order. I DO TIP, I just want to put it in the driver's hand myself and not give it to the middleman.  That and then there's the moral issue of how these people should absolutely be considered employees, and be given all the protections that come with.
As a rule of thumb. Your food costs are double than that you would pay in a restaurant. Now you weigh your options if it’s worth it.
Its become standard in the US to look down on people that actually work. This is people failing to resist corporate propaganda.  Corporations want these workers to be treated as lesser and looked down on because that prevents people from caring about protecting those workers. The jobs that are considered “real jobs” are slowly disappearing. Both because people succumb to propaganda and look down on others for working, and because corporations do there best to eliminate jobs that pay enough to live on. America is going back to slavery, the corporate slaveholders just don’t want to call it that.
Don't forget about tip baiting :(
Food delivery services need to be owned by restaurant associations. Car delivery services need to be owned by the drivers. Cut out the profit-hogging middlemen.
Seattle screwed us drivers over. Big time.
The problems with these apps run even deeper than what is discussed here. I do Uber and Lyft and would rather light my underwear on fire than be their employee however...
Encouraging tipping culture is harmful on every level. Demand companies pay their employees, don't demand consumers help companies bypass basic responsibilities of being employers.
My husband spent a few months as a delivery driver for DoorDash and lemme tell you I’m SO GLAD he’s not doing it anymore. The drivers get really screwed on pay, often offered only 2-3$ per delivery and only more if the customer tips. Most deliveries weren’t even worth the gas it took to make them.  I avoid using these apps now, it ends up being twice as expensive and knowing the driver and restaurant aren’t even getting most of that money just completely turns me off from using the service.
Getting good use out of those stock photos of journalists I see
ah yes "side hustles", or what sociologists call it: gentrified precarity
Don't use delivery apps.  They suck.  Seriously, get in your damn car and go get the food.  You need to get out of the house anyway.
Fuck tipping culture.
Delivery Hero, the company behind Grubhub, went so far to create websites for restaurants, sometimes even competing with the actual restaurants for SEO placing. They said, they wanted to help business, while charging them a heavy commission whenever someone made an order through that website. Never trust those companies, check for a real website first or call them, when ordering.
Everytime John goes on a rant about some kind of pop culture i can see Dan O'Brian's hand in the writing.  That bit about the devil went down to Georgia would fit right in an episode of after hours.
Me: “Time to get in my car and start work!”  *”Food Delivery Apps: Last Week Tonight”*  “Aw shit…”
Skype became Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Teams did fine in the pandemic. Still funny though.
Never tip anyone through the app. Use cash, they can't control that.
True story, I live walking distance from a decent supermarket and I have only used delivery app like twice, at 3:00 a.m., because party.  If I lived in a food desert like a lot of places in America, I'd probably be using this delivery all the time and I'd be a lot less healthy and way more broke
“capitalism is a dirty business” -Niko Bellic
Whoever watched the entire episode while it was on YouTube knows what's up
He didn't talk about another problem with these delivery apps. I live in a college town so of course there's a lot of college students doing doordash, grubhub, etc. However, there is an alarming number of them who only sign up just to see how many times they can get free food before getting booted off. I've had my orders stolen. The last one, he placed it in front of my door, took a picture and then picked it back up and left with it. And when I complained to doordash they refused to refund my money cause his picture showed "proof" of delivery. They've also made it much harder to leave a review for the dasher, I have to search to find it. And crap like that guy, he gets 1 star and would get 0 stars if I could. After he stole my food and doordash refused to refund it, I went out and bought a doorbell camera. Not going to let anybody screw me over like that again without proof on my end.
I used to drive for a Chinese restaurant.    I’ve recently been trying out these apps.  I can promise you that the tips do NOT make up 1/3-1/2 of the earnings.  Most of the offers I see are between about $6-15 with 0-$2 tip.  Uber food delivery doesn’t even tell you what the tip might be before you accept the delivery.  Many of the offers are around 50 cents per mile in total yet they are accepted almost immediately.
John should explain what economic Rent Seeking is.
John forgot to mention that many companies, such as Pizza Hut, are laying off their own delivery people and using the apps, because even with the exorbitant fees, its still cheaper than hiring a delivery deiver, PLUS, you get to blame California law for the layoffs.   Win win win. At leadt if you're a massive corporation.
It's a nice option for someone like me who has a full time job but gets 3 days off a week. If I'm bored I can just fire up a delivery app for a few hours and make extra money. I wouldn't ever recommend people to try to juggle these as your main source of income because some people don't care and won't tip you very well. My main complaint is how shady the apps can be by not telling you exactly where you need to drop off. Sometimes I get sent 15-20 miles away from my home area and then the app won't "find" me any trips until I drive nearly all the way back. You don't get paid or compensated during the times where you aren't on your way to a drop off or a pick up.
I disagreed with John here, you should tip if you want, but to make a mandatory tip inside the app system there is no incentive for the app to pay more to the delivery person. Imagine you don't tip by the app, delivery personnel can choose if they want to work for that app or not, lack of delivery personnel can hurt the app revenue so they would pay more to keep the system working, by throwing money outside at random for delivery they add a bonus that makes above margin for delivery and profitable, but the system should be already profitable for everyone.
Hey, I'm over 30 and I'm still triggered by phone calls.
He is asking to Tipp more but the whole tipping culture is one of the leading problems.
58%! Just a bit more than the government.
Please do Yelp next.
They probably bought John Oliver, too. He did the worst reporting on this one. How could 3  companies servicing 300 million ppl not make a profit? Not great report 😕
So. I’m actually door dashing. And for me, it is working out well. BUT, I have VA for healthcare, and I have a full time job. So a few hours in peak time when I’m able to does give the little boost of money I need. Could use more, but at least I can make it now and enjoy food.  However, nights with no tippers hurt.  One night I did 7 deliveries. 4 had no tip. So I got paid a grand total of 8 dollars for two hours of driving around. That’s not each, that’s totally.  I was so depressed I didn’t dash the rest of the week.  Also, last night I had a pickup/delivery. At 11:45pm… for a single package of q-tips. But hey at least they tipped a dollar.
He's never been the same since the section on Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow
I delivered pizza starting in 1994, and delivered until i became disabled. It was often my main job (because look, where i live, in 2005 i made 7.50 an hour, 1.25 per "run" (order. On Fridays I'd often have 3 orders per trip, each order was considered a run. Don't ask me was it wasn't categorized as per order) and while the mileage was screwing IMO, I'd get oil changes, tires, and i even got 3 tune ups in the course of 12 years - then i switched from papa John's (because i went back to school and they weren't willing to accommodate me working part time, despite HIRING me part time)  to pizza hut.i took a small pay cut, and only got a 1.25 a run (PJ had increased to, iirc,1.40) but they were flexible, had a smaller delivery area, better benefits - and i had THE best managers I've ever had, hands down. ALL of the managers. At one point, i dislocated my shoulder and was working with it in a brace, and was limited to 4 hour shifts - no problem for them, they were just happy to keep me. When i started my very unjustly journey to disability, they spent MONTHS working with me, finding or at least twice CREATING jobs i could do as my medical restrictions increased. And thing is, why my managers were exactly that awesome, they were ALLOWED to be, and were hired TO be that awesome, and were supported by THEIR managers, on up the line.   The ONLY problem i had with delivering back then is that so many people thought the delivery fee was out to. In fact, the last i delivered,  *10 CENTS* of that delivery was passed on to me (as part of the "run" - but that money was supposed to go entirely to maintaining my car and paying for gas) a lot of it, i think fifty cents, went towards my hourly. A larger part went towards paying the people who worked the call center.   I once suggested to the district manager (my managers managers manager) that they put on receipts or SOMEWHERE that the delivery fee wasn't a tip and that NO WE DID NOT MAKE $16-20 an hour. (It was a meeting about why morale was so bad and how to fix it. It was so bad because they'd raised to deliver few, so tips dropped, and no one had gotten their expected raises, this new DM said the company couldn't afford it. We were a small franchise... anyway, the jerk was VERY offended I'd suggest that, not sure why, but he kept trying to get us to do trust falls and similar, and we all kept telling we got along with EACH OTHER great, we'd just taken a huge monetary hit and that's the only reason for low morale. The idiot wanted us to return to being happy without even listening to why weren't - he didn't last much longer, and the owner listened to the "letting customers know the delivery fee wasn't a tip" thing, and it helped. As did him NEVER AGAIN advertise as "make $16‐20/ hour' - from then on, he advertise "starting hourly plus tips". But i know why that jerk didn't want to actually inform customers that the delivery fee wasn't a tip - some people might not order. Not many, but some. Pizza is an incredibly inelastic priced business - people KNOW what they should pay, and it's not more than 20 for an extra large Supreme, right? Except deals or coupons or something say that same pizza should be 12 or so. Even if cheese has tripled in price over the last year, and most meats doubled and etc, can't raise the price of the PIZZA (go look at pizza prices starting in the 80s. One place inflation didn't really affect consumer prices)   When grub hub started, i was PISSED. I knew what was coming. No one i knew listened to me - I'm a Cassandra... But yeah, I'm disabled. I have an uber eats pass, and i always tip 20% (if there's bad weather - so long as i would have been okay delivering in it! - i tip extra) i try to order either very close by, or during the empty times when a driver might sit around for an hour or more waiting for ANYTHING (and have a couple dollars cash to supplement) but i kinda hate it - the gig thing. It's obscene. I mean yes, there's not really ANY way to ethically consume under late stage capitalism, but you try to go for the least harm, yeah? (Being as I'm limited in choices...i still try) the gig economy is one of those choices that's ONLY good for corporations SHAREHOLDERS. Argh.   This very long TED talk brought to you but am old school delivery driver who thinks ALL workers deserve more, but especially those LITERALLY risking life and limb to bring you that pad thai. And by more, i don't JUST mean a bigger tip! I mean an hourly wage, to start, or something similar, and health insurance and WORKMAN'S COMP which somehow even if they're *in the middle of a delivery, so are ACTUALLY ON THE CLOCK*, gig delivery drivers aren't entitled to? What the FUCK?! What the actual fucking fuck
The YouTube algorithm shoving a Doordash ad under this story...
"Independent Contractors"   .....  Every episode that this John Oliver show mentions the word Independent Contractor, you know someone is getting screwed
If possible, tip in cash. That way the app company can't touch it.
I was today years old when I realized that the devil was robbed in that fiddle contest!  😮
Here's the other side of the coin though: why am I expected to tip a dasher a healthy amount /before/ my food is delivered, only to then have it show up spilled, with half the items missing, or cold? Can you imagine going to a restaurant and being asked to tip your server ahead of time and let them pick who serves you depending on the tip amount? That's stupid as shit
I rarely so strongly disagree with Oliver, but leaning more heavily into America's wacked out tipping culture is absolutely not a way to fix this problem (or even to put a band-aid on it), neither is giving 5 star reviews for jacked up products. The solution is indeed to stop using these apps as a society until someone creates a more palatable solution or to just go back to doing business directly with restaurants with no intermediary.
never ordered by app and never will
one thing this show forgot damage to the cars used my sister bought a new kia and in less than 10 months she had 100000 miles on it running uber and uber eats
The one time I gave a bad review was because I watched the driver pull into my parking lot at work...he  marked my pizza as delivered. Then proceeded to eat it and drive away.   :)
Every episode of this show i bless the fact that I'm born in Europe
This tipping culture in this country to subsidize a worker paycheck is absolutely unethical.
Food delivery apps are truly leeches
Slayyy
Watching this while waiting for my $30 Chipotle to arrive
John Oliver telling me to tip more is not a solution either.  Let it just all burn.  Stop being lazy, get your own fucking food.  You didn't need DoorDash 10 years ago you wont need it in the future.
according to a friend who did doordash for a while, you don't even get to see where your delivery location is until you accept the order, so you can't plan ahead and accept a bunch of orders along the same route to maximize efficiency.  also, he repeatedly had issues with the app not correctly reading his location and trying to assign him orders that were over an hour away, and if you decline too many orders, you get penalized for that, so he would end up spending all day on the phone with tech support instead of running deliveries because he couldn't just reject until he got something within a reasonable distance.  he gave up on it after only a few weeks because it was just too much hassle for so little pay.
The real call to action here is go pick up our own food like we used to.
Nooooooo I'm tired don't take fast food delivery away
Why do I “have to tip”? Just because I don’t have 50 million to lobby against tipping? Maybe have the companies be forced to hire them as employees instead of forcing me to tip
The harsh reality of this is that the problem isn't Doordash, or Grubhub, or Uber, or Lyft, it's capitalism. They're just doing what's necessary and encouraged in this system.
💙
So, genuine question. John says "if the weather is dangerous, don't order food"  I have assumed that the people who would deliver in this condition are people who are desperate for the money and would prefer that you order (and tip well) and they can accept or decline.   I seem to be missing a part of the puzzle, what causes someone who wouldn't want to drive in bad weather to do so anyway if the orders are there? Wouldn't refusing to order just force someone who needs the money to go without?   Like i said, genuinely trying to understand what I'm missing here.
Where is the regulation? Why are exploitative practices allowed across the board? Oh right, we live in a capitalist dystopia where even John Fucking Oliver can't bring up labor rights or unions unless the subject is Amazon. Only then can we know the true price of delivering a single slice of cake over a bridge.
16:18 I believe that guy, he sees things. The computers. They talk to him.
"Starting an Orphanage!" 😂😂😂😅.  OMG!  I used to drive Uber & in the end after all the costs of gas, wear & tear in the car, etc - it wasn't worth it!  The app was horrible, too.  Took me to closed streets, etc.
9:56 If I had a nickel for the amount of times my grocery bags from instacart smelled like cigarettes...
thank you
I always cash tip my delivery person.
Damn, algorithms are fucking evil, almost as if we had 12 years of being told that exact thing and we somehow decided to use them more and worse. Also, drivers for these apps should unionize.
By the way, this ALSO applies to the Floral Industry, except WE STILL HAVE TO DELIVER THE ARRANGEMENT. "Floral" companies have this business locked down and drain you of your hard earned money for little to no effort on their end. The power of going against a giant :(  The customer pays $80 for something that's worth $50, they keep the difference and then deduct 30% off your $50 in "fees" and they can still freely cancel the on you while the customer gets to keep the flowers/merchandise you purchased. No pay + the loss of goods.
Skype joke seems pretty much directly lifted from the CEO series with Brennan episode of Skype. Also, you can just rename this show to 'How is corporate greed ruining the US this week?'
John is correct about not punishing the food delivery workers: do your best to leave a tip, don’t rate poorly if it at all can be avoided, don’t remove tips for incorrect or bad orders, just don’t order from that restaurant if they keep getting it wrong, respect when there is bad weather, bad traffic, etc, and use the app as a next to last resort, if a restaurant says that it’s better to call in your order or order directly from their website, do that instead. And lastly, be mindful of payment method. Some credit card companies offer great cash back deals with some of the delivery apps. But just like at a restaurant, you don’t have to tip by card, which of course comes with associated overhead costs. That tip money may not all go to the drivers, despite the app’s claim. You can still give cash a tip, though it should never be expected by the driver (we’ve seen videos of drivers demanding tips and that’s not a good look either).
you should not even have to tip , imagine workers earning what they deserve
No one says raw dog the air, it's called bare back the breeze.
This is my sorry for 2004
So Uber Eats is the best for businesses then.... Interesting. Also.... three companies spending $184 million to fight legislation when they are unprofitable....
At the moment of watching this, I was dashing for doordash. Suddenly, the entire system went down and I was unable to claim funds earned thru my dashes. Crazy.
Ugh I noticed it's so hard to tip now!
Restaurant apps absolutely don't make sense:  to get food delivered almost doubles your cost.... so part of your mind might think:  I'm spending almost twice as much and it's taking almost twice as long and I need to give a good tip too?
I worked at a restaurant years before pandemic when DoorDash Rolled out. I was a Togo order guy.  Basically my tips were gouged by delivery apps and I put partial blame on the delivery drivers, so I would set them as my lowest priority.  I basically saw it as Delivery Drivers were literally stealing my money for my work. Eventually Doordash was banned from making orders via fax.  It pushed me to say I wanted to be a waiter or I was quitting. (hourly pay then was $9 in California)
2:04 Bars 🔥
You’re a monumental garbage human if you use a delivery app and don’t tip at least 20%. If that’s too rich, get off your ass and get it yourself.
As a DoorDasher I get charged 1.99 every time I transfer the money I earn Dashing into my bank account and I am only allowed to do it once every 24 hours. You will get a 4 dollar order that requires a 12 mile drive. I have 96 5 star ratings and 2 1 star ratings that I have no information about as to why I received them or when. You get disqualified from Dashing if your rating goes below 4.7 and those two ratings dropped me from 5 to 4.9. I am considered a top dasher and I find myself struggling to string together orders without having to travel really far. People hate tipping, so they don't tip enough and Doordash only gives us a small amount from the order. Seems like they over-saturate the areas. I am barely surviving. Pay for my own healthcare, Type 1 Diabetic with heart disease and a defibrillator. This is a reality for a lot of us in America. These parasitic corporations will feed on anything and everything they can- including me and you.
its unskilled labor. tf get a call center job
Regarding prop 22 they also put pop ups into their ads for Californians threading it prop 22 didn’t pass, you’d have your costs increased  San Francisco Co I believe was the only place it failed. And then we got our fares and fees increased seemingly in retaliation
The customers hate delivery apps. The workers hate delivery apps. The restaurants hate delivery apps. And the companies are struggling to even turn a profit.  Why are we doing this, again?
Lieferando (as Grubhub is called in Germany) was caught recreating the websites of restaurants down to the smallest detail so that the order is not placed via the restaurant's website but via theirs. They would do anything to trick you into using them.
We work for tips only so please remember that. I do it because I have 3 children with special needs and I need the flexibility to be able to drop work and go to school if they need me, make appointments for their therapies. We are people with families too.
Food delivery apps, or the Ticketmaster of food.  Well, okay, that's not quite fair yet.  There is still some competition in the food delivery business.  For now.
As a millennial, I’m disappointed in the missed opportunity to connect the dots between the single slice of cake being delivered across bridges with Diddy telling the Making the Band group to walk to Brooklyn and get him a slice of cheesecake.
24:00 in the words of Beyonce, "Look at that horse, Look at that horse, Look at that horse (Look at that horse)."
And all the garbage they create. Plastic containers with plastic utensils in a plastic bag. Our lazy convenient and lazy lifestyle is why there is no paradise anymore. Just plastic garbage everywhere you look.
I unfortunately started doing these food delivery apps for both Uber Eats and doordash after The Fad had died down. I started January or February 2023 and while it was great for about 3 months, that's when it pretty much ended. At least in my area, the northern Central Valley of California Uber Eats and doordash barely promote so businesses barely use them, and 99% of what people order through those apps is fast food which absolutely shocks me I delivered to lived within a block or two of where I was delivering from. The laziness knows no bounds and people would rather pay 10 to $20 more for their food just so they don't have to leave their home
Thank you for this. I've done doordash and so are a few friends, it's a frustrating and very poor replacement for a job with cost of vehicle upkeep, gas, wasted time, and so on. And yes, the reviews will kill your income, even just a single bad one can total dismantle your day, even week. And yes, please Tip your delivery person. "up to half" the income in tips is wrong, at least here. Probably more like 70% of it is reliant on tips, with Doordash anyway, they don't base pay for shit.
I hate using delivery apps. I don't have a car. My food options are whatever I am willing to walk to.
Lost me when you said it's a bargain. I paid $40 for a subway sandwich yesterday. Also, I'm a millennial and doing great. Yes we got a late start, but many of us have climbed out of it, and then some
This problem, is a lot worse than doordash and Grubhub.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKzlB_jrOyk
John had a surprisingly good Spanish accent while pronouncing Los Deliveristas Unidos. Respect.
great programing
I've worked as a delivery driver as an employee and as an independent contractor. They both paid about the same but as an independent contractor, I had more flexibility and didn't have to wash dishes. Plus you can write off your expenses as an independent contractor, but you can't as an employee. Being an independent contractor was a lot better.
19:15 "you gotta fucking tip" LOL. America trying to guilt trip everyone into their tip mania. John: you should checkout Japan. Ask them if you gotta tip.
When I delivered a pizza to someone 45 minutes away, an hour and a half round trip, without getting a tip, before delivery apps existed, and using at least two gallons of gas to do it, I didn't get an audience saying "Aaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww...". And the base pay was $15 per shift. Now THAT sucked.
This is the restaurant industry smh. Our current prices for the last 2 decades have been shit, but ppl don’t want to pay? Soooo pretend to care for these drivers well the cooks that slave away in bad environments for very low pay don’t get a special about them.
My local Pizza Hut has begun using third party delivery service, I don't order from them anymore
Food Apps need to recall history re Safety. Back in the day, Domino's ad was "Delivery in less than 30min"—until a pizza driver hit and injured a woman who sued and won 750k actual and 78 million punitive  expressly because of the delivery claim.
That Doordash driver from1:30.....   When did Matt Walsh get fired from the daily wire?
*The American dream:*  - Spend your entire youth studying hard and working a student job to get the best start your adult life with the best chances on the job market and some decent savings for your first flat (no time for hobbies and friends)  - Spend the next ten to twenty years of your life working your butt off all day to rise up the corporate ladder to a management or senior specialist position or to save enough money to start your own innovative business (Still no time for hobbies and friends)  - Make a lot of money, buy a big house and a fancy car and start a family that you won't have time for because, while you finally have money you wished for now, you're still a manager, senior specialist or businesses owner, those occupations demand long hours and are exhausting AF and you gotta keep on working for at least another decade or two if you don't want to lose it all again! (Still no time for hobbies and friends)  - Retire. Finally you have time to be a parent, but ooops, your kids are all grown-up, have already moved out and are now either caught up in the same grind, or in addiction(s). Either way, they don't care much about you because growing up, they never felt you care about them. Your partner might still be around if you're lucky! On the plus side, now you definitely have enough time and money to _pursue hobbies, relax_ and _enjoy the day._ If you still remember what these words mean. (Now you also time to hang out with friends, if you still have any)   *The American reality:*  - Spend your entire youth working multiple student jobs to afford your tuition fees (no time for hobbies and friends. Barely time to study, even)  - Spend the next decades (five or six till retirement) working your butt off all day (and often all night, too) just to barely scrape by paycheck to paycheck without the slightest chance to make a career or save up enough money to start a business. You can't afford your car, but you NEED it and you'll never afford to own your home. And you're still paying back your student debts. If you start a family at all, that's by accident and only makes your life infinitely harder. (no time for hobbies and friends)  - Retire long before you can afford a decent rent because your body just can't take it anymore. Now you _would_ have time for hobbies, but you can't afford the necessary equipment and your body is too much of a wreck for any hobby involving physical activity (which all the most affordable hobbies do). Your friends, if you had any, have probably all died from the unforgiving hard work, from their use of alcohol and other drugs, or from (gambling) debt-induced depression. Some of them even turned to a life of crime in their despair and got arrested or died. You're pretty much just waiting to die also, suffering in poverty in your overworked body broken down from decades of exploitative labor with no sick leave, no worker's protection and no worker's compensation!   Everyone still puts all the effort into the American dream, but fewer and fewer people get to reap its promised rewards!
Nah, I never use these apps. It’s just so expensive to get food that’s cold, usually wrong and taking a long time. I just order directly from the restaurant and pick it up myself.
For 2200 he could have got a nice 10 yr old car but he bought a bike yeah these are people not good with money
I despise how they decimated local delivery workers. I used to be able to get delivery from like 30 local restaurants for around a $3 charge and a 20% tip to the driver, now not even the jimmy johns three miles away will deliver to me without door dash and it costs 13$ in fees before the tip on top of the menu prices being increased through the app. The only place I can deliver from anymore at a reasonable price is little Caesars but only if I go through their website and it is more of a testament to how affordable they are than anything else. They still end up using door dash but it is like $10-$15 less if you order from the little caesars website. I used to work delivery for a few different restaurants since it was the only type of job that paid decently where I lived and after hearing the horror stories of working for these apps the whole industry just seems beyond broken.
I wish we could move away from a tipping model and to a model where the employees just get paid fairly by the company. I am disabled and I have to use food delivery most weeks in order to get groceries ( Slightly different I know ) and take out as well. The app I used has started guilting me to tip higher and higher with ads and banners saying how cold it is outside. Except the food I order is priced so much higher, that I really struggle with this tipping amount. Perhaps the prices would just go up to compensate with paying employees more over relying on the customer to tip, but I think it would be a lot more stable, and alot less pressure on the customer to decide what is fair when they are potentially struggling as well.
Yup, Uber Eats and DoorDash are just the beginning of Millennials revenge tour. Just wait till we get to housing. we’re gonna eventually find a way to lower our entry cost to housing that’s gonna piss off every older homeowner, and we’re not gonna bat an eye. You made this toxic capitalism game, we’re just gonna play it better. 😂
No you should not tip, tipping mean the companies will make it the sole source of income for workers, and if some driver or waiter did an incredible service then tip him without the company’s involvement or even knowledge.
I worked at a bakery in a mall and Grubhub added us without permission. They used an Indian call center to pretend to be the customer and then a driver would show up. At first we didn't realize what was going on cause we'd keep telling them you don't need to call us to order cookies and that you can just show up and tell us what you want but then we caught on cause they used the same script. We stopped answering their calls after they started to try and send cake orders to us that they'd send a driver for 20 min later because we require 24 hrs notice on cake orders at the minimum and on the weekends we don't take orders at all after a certain point.
why are we seeing clips from 2020 of uber eats saying they're not making a profit?   seems like a lot has changed since then.
After Watchin this I used my dash pass membership lmao
I've been dealing with crohn's and really bad anemia the last two years and have had to rely on these services here and there and all I can say is that they are fucking evil. You have a million places to rate the restaurant, the driver, the individual menu items, etc in the app but you can only rate the app itself in the app store when all of the MANY problems associated with them are THEIR FAULT not the driver, not the restaurant, THEM.
it’s sad that for these companies it’s more profitable to spend 184 million dollars fighting against worker safety than it is making the workers safe
I have never and will never use a delivery app like this. If the restaurant doesn't offer an in-house delivery, I don't order from there. I either drive there or cook my own damn food.
9:35 yeah my ex works for grubhub and they provided her with a credit/debit card that she could use to pay for the customer's order along with the items requested.
If anyone wants to keep learning about this, another channel called "Modern MBA" did a great video on this as well from the business side and how the business model doesn't work
My family rarely orders deliveries to our doorstep, rather than driving to the restaurants for pickups, but I still understand the plight of thise workers. No one should have to feel like shit performing a service.
Time to stop cleaning the app companies and start blaming ourselves for continuing to give our money to companies that don't support our neighborhoods.
As someone who has had many different jobs (waiting tables, chopping  weeds, house painting, gofer for a law office, picking tobacco, voiceover, acting work, etc.) I have never been treated with more disrespect than when I did food delivery. Never. Ever. NO CLOSE SECOND.  Tip your damned delivery people.
build an orphanage wtf  alternate universe where the blues brothers have to save the orphanage and instead of trying to get the band back together they run a doordash in a stolen cop car
!!! ALWAYS TIP CASH !!!  Tipping via the app or browser does not ensure that the tip goes to the deliverer!  The resturant is "obligated" to pass the tip onto the delivery person but that doesn't mean they do.  So, !!! ALWAYS TIP CASH !!!  That way it definitely goes to the deliverer.  This coming from someone in Germany who tipped via the app once, asked the delivery person about it and they truely had no idea I had tipped and mentioned that the resturant does not always pass it on!
Oddly, given that the price paid for door dash is significantly higher (more than twice as much) than just buying the meal at the restaurant, I think the customers are losing too. Restaurant, customer, drivers, and investors are all losing. This industry should not exist.
This is a dystopia, no reasonable protections for the lower and middle classes.
This should have shamed shitty customers that tip bait more. You did not talk about the workers enough and you talked about the companies fonances and the customer too much.
As someone who still delivers food for one of these apps, I hate the entire system of it yet im on scholarship because of it (thx uber) when im donewith college. I'm deleting the apps
None of this will stop anyone from being the kind of lazy idiot you have to be to spend more on delivery than you did on the food.  Especially when most delivery only travels a few miles at best.  Just about *anything* is a better alternative to paying way too much for some guy to deliver room temperature takeout for a tech bro company that unfairly exploits everyone it comes in contact with.  You could have sleep for dinner and it would be better for everyone.
Doordash delivering orphans coming soon to a neighborhood near you?
Ya'll deserve every Emmy you have received.
Damn I had no idea it worked that way.  I thought it worked like older programs I've seen
I really don’t see the hype I can count on 1 hand the number of times I’ve used food delivery apps. But maybe cuz I’m fanatic cook
oh christ someones's gunna do that to orphanages in a few years aren't they
Sorry Oliver - first time I disagree with you. "You gotta fucking tip" - NO! You need to pay a wage for people so they do not need damn tips.
In Greece I stopped using delivery apps.  1. I call the restaurant. 2. I use the restaurant's delivery page.  Most of the restaurants give extra free meal with direct order. So, yes. The fee is about must be around 30%-50%.  Tip is bad culture.
Dafaq? Harry Potter is as good as it ever was! Its amazing!
I delivered for door dash.  It’s the worst.  I am not a bitter person in general But I have nothing but distain for DoorDash, and their customers. Most people did not tip.  I Earned less than minimum wage on many occasions.  Absolutely awful that companies can take advantage of workers like that.
why should i be the one to make sure that employees get paid instead of, oh i dont know, the company that they work for. im not tipping shit
Can't spell Millennial without three massive L's.
Similar story in India with Swiggy and Zomato being food delivery mafia
If you are ripping everyone off like these guys do, but can't make money, you are clearly incompetent.
Just out of high school I was able to get jobs delivering pizza in the early 80's enough to get my own apartment and handle all my own finances, insurance, etc., and it was glorious :) Broke now, but back then ...
Free market, lol. They try to eliminate competition in a segment and then establish  a monopoly. That's why they call it living the dream: It ain't real.
Almost ALL reviews you write on line are not reviewing the company or their product. It's an employee evaluation system only. For that reason I always give them 5 stars! (unless it' parently obvious the employee is a jerk.
So companies not providing backpacks is why my pizza shows up vertical?
Things like this are blessings for homebound disabled and elderly.   Keeping drunk off roads is a good idea too.
you americans need to make sure that people get paid wages that men can live from. stop with that tipping culture. make the companies pay adequate wages.
$40 dollar charge for 9.95 worth of food?  Nah i'd walk
He neglected to mention that these companies charge bogus delivery and service fees in lieu of tips, which SHOULD go toward drivers in case they aren't tipped, yet they don't. In fact, these companies sometimes limit the compensation they'll allow their drivers; if you pay higher tips, the companies simply pay less outside the tips to compensate. It's absurd. Always try to tip in cash.
Wish Jhon would do a spot on cell / smart phones.  I got scammed by Verizon for over eight hundred dollars.  Because I payed by automatic withdrawals. So they cleaned my account. Then refused any contacts by me until I missed the window period to sue. Every business now days is a scam. Capitalism as it was meant.
I participated in DoorDash delivery when they first started appearing around my area and no matter how many hours I worked per day per week I only brought home a maximum of 300 and profit a month. That's after fuel costs. It's not enough to live off of.
Having my first musical memories being listening to the Charlie Daniels Band on a huge record player as a kid, can confirm the Devil's violin solo smoked Johnny- and I knew it by the age of 6.
I'm not surprised they don't make a profit. It's by design and you yourself explained. They want you to become dependent on their platform and latter they will squease you. However it's not working, see how YouTube started a war with adblock users which amount to nothing. People have an amount they are willing to pay for something. Uber for instance, when it appeared people used to take them just to get to the next block. Now they are more selective. Streaming got people used to pay for content again, but if you raise the price of start placing ads people will go back to torrents. These companies think is ALL just a matter of make you dependable of their apps but they forget that maybe your just using it because of the price its offering you, once the price is gone so are people.
The quality of delivery work has dropped so low I can't use it anymore.  From them not delivering my entire order, then having nobody claim responsibility for it, to my order coming 4 hours late, it's just not a quality product and I don't see how anybody would use it and pay so much more for the food.  And fuck american tipping culture.  John you should know better than to push such a terrible idea that is this messed up tipping culture.  Pay your employees better.
"We are not profitable companies but can afford to spend $184,000,000 lobbying to continue to keep underpaying our employees." -GrubHub and UberEats
I'm sorry. But when the driver doesn't even deliver the food to me and marks it as delivered, they're getting the lowest stars possible.
* cries in 3 massive L's *
I did know some of these things about the delivery apps....some of things I did not know. We never use delivery apps. because we are cheap and old fashioned I suppose and will go and pick-up the food ourselves if the place doesn't deliver. I am going to continue not using delivery apps. so I can continue to tip the people that make and deliver my food.
Tip cash, apps skim off what you would normally pay.
I once considered starting an orphanage as a side hustle. Seemed like something I could scale up if it took off. But then I thought, "no. No, a railroad would be better." I also thought about inventing styrofoam, but a quick search told me it had been done. In the end, I settled on designing a cathedral. It's going pretty well.
Who the f*** calls a brinjal an ‘egg’ plant 🤣
I don't understand why restaurants, especially those that already employed delivery drivers, willingly allowed DoorDash and other companies to deliver their food whilst cutting into their own profits.
I usually use food delivery apps only to see what restaurants to deliver and what they have and then search for them in Google and call them directly so they get 100% of my money. If apps would take around 10% I could understand, but any more than that is simply greedy as F - same like Apple using his AppStore, it's actually stealing profits for doing nothing but having a monopoly on a platform.  We could fight this with open data standards and platforms, forcing apps to interpret open standards and provide APIs. Like you can use any free email program to read your mails - or could you imagine you can only read mails in Outlook because they were sent via Outlook? Well, that's exactly what companies like Facebook do. It forces people to use the same messenger and tadaaa, you have a monopoly you can heavily abuse the shit out of. Same goes for any platforms, be it food apps, hotel booking apps, social media platforms etc.
i tried delivery in the end i just paid for gas money after driving fourty minutes in traffic to deliver one smoothie.
Orphanages 😂😂 wtf
Some lateral thinking with Brennan Lee Mulligan's CEO sketch😂
I don't even get my pizza delivered, I'll go pick it up myself. I've never used one of these crappy services.
tipping shouldn't be the best solution we have. why does oliver think it is such a great model? it is of course the proper thing given the system but to not mention how it is problematic?? if we think it is right to tip for the luxury of food why not the luxury of other valuable things such as daycare?
as a full time driver, im saving for rent, food and that orphanage as we speak
Great! Now, do meal kit subscriptions.
I get the convenience, but WHY DO YOU WANT LUKEWARM WENDY'S DELIVERED TO YOUR HOME?
In other news, solar eclipse. In the last days... "The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord." Acts 2:20  Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, Acts 3:19
I don't want to tip. I'd rather just drive to the restaurant and pick it up for half the cost.
The only reason people try a side hustle is because regular DEGREE REQUIRING JOBS don’t pay enough anymore
How about instead of tips, which is a broken system by the way, like having people earn something outside the books... tax evasion?... you don't give them a fair wage..? I don't know, maybe I'm crazy. If so, thanks for incentivizing fraud and tax evasion.
The U.S. needs major anti-trust and anti monopoly law revamps and also anti-consolidation laws to prevent this kind of thing from happening over and over and over again. This whole country is just a giant corporation trying to fuck over everyone else except for the wealthiest people
If the food delivery apps are at the cheap undercut stage of the cycle right now and they’re still THIS expensive, I can’t even imagine how much it’s gonna cost once they jack up prices ☠️  Get ready for the $200 cheeseburger
In Seattle Washington, the people voted on ballots for delivery companies to pay delivery drivers a minimum wage in the seattle area. Except when it rolled out, Seattle area users noticed that we now have a $5 Seattle fee to help delivery drivers meet minimum wage requirements. So instead of the companies paying more to the drivers, these companies put the cost onto the user's. This rolled out about a month ago and I don't know a single person who has used a delivery app since this rolled out. Your food cost could only be $25 but it will cost $50 to be delivered, not even including a tip.
the pride ad is disgusting
Proud to say that I'm a millennial who has never used any delivery services mentioned here. I don't even like getting pizza delivered. It's so much cheaper to pick it up, or cheaper yet to cook for myself.
i've talked to some dashers while waiting for food, and the doordash algorithm actually REDUCES how much money you get from doordash if someone tips more. so if you want to give your driver more money, GIVE THEM CASH!!
I'm disappointed there was not a "50 shades of Grapes" referenced in the opening with the Vegi-tales, but otherwise a solid well thought out story.
Still not as bad if ur a Mechanic spending tens upon thousands of dollars on your own tools. And tool boxes. Are you always have to keep buying. Because manufacturers change the nuts and bolts on their cars
None of this sounds like it should be on the user. Everyone should just stop tipping, and remove the tip component from the apps completely so the price asked is the right price for the driver and stop leaving the livelihood of the drivers up to the whims of the customer.
Always tip in cash, not thru app. Always!
*There's nothing that keeps you from tipping delivery people when they come to your door. That way the person gets the money directly😉.*
I'm not one of ordering from these apps. I got tired of the whole "We are loosing money just so we can make people get dependent on our services and after that we'll try to make them make profit out of us".All you said I already saw in an article like 3 - 4 years ago and it seemed bad! The only times we used it since they appeared was several cases in which we were trying to find something different. For Pizza and stuff we gerally have the flyers and are used to the better ones we found out by trial and error. Once I ordered a meal that said "Serve 2 people". My intention was to share with my mother. It could barely feed me. I would have gained more by just going to the place nearby and buying it there, I would pay roughly the same and would get at least twice as much food. So my disdain for those delivery apps is well stablished.
I think there was an impact on everyones (not just delivery drivers) auto insurance rates as well.  the delivery drivers (I've tried it) are a menace by design. phone pinging constantly while you are driving and you have to read carefully and frantically choose to take an order or decline it within 15 seconds *while driving* Gieco won't have you as a client at all now if you are a gig driver.
21:55 until… they know that customers are hooked and raise price.
My buddy did doordash for a couple years. When i sat with him and showed him on paper he wpuld he making more money jist working at a restaurant he stopped doong doordash and jist got a job at an olve garden and now makes more money for his actual time and now lack of massive expenses. These apps specifically target those that are financially illiterate.
I can never justify the cost of using these apps. I normally just pick up the food myself. The fact that they “aren’t charging what it’s worth” when a simple order from a fast food restaurant totals to over $40, shows how bad it will be in the future.
I absolutely refuse to believe that these companies aren’t making money hand over fist. Just because their Uber rich executives are eating up all of the profits doesn’t mean I’m going to pity those oh so poor tech billionaires. Get out of here
Only customer benefit!!? No, how about all those CEOs and CFOs who get tens of millions dollars in compensation packages and bonuses??
was that rami youseff talking to Kevin the delivery guy?
I used to be a food delivery driver in the early 2000’s for nearly a decade, it used to be you worked for a specific place like a pizza or Chinese food joint, and you did deliveries for that place.  Now the horrific Uber and Lyft models have invaded food delivery as well, causing all sorts of problems outlined here.  But most customers don’t care, that’s why Amazon and Walmart became so powerful.
Why is this manure in my feed? John Oliver is smart. He was smart enough to trick someone into paying him money for his “talent.”
I've long felt like tipping delivery app drivers shouldn't even be an option, it should be mandatory. And it shouldn't be a percentage of the cost of your food but rather a fixed multiplied value based-on the expected delivery time.  How is the cost of your order proportional to the effort they put into getting it to you? Makes 0 sense unless people are ordering a boatload of food, and even then, the anticipated delivery time is clearly a more-related metric
Lets be real here, the customers using the apps aren't the winners either. You constantly have to deal with orders that don't get picked up, drivers who take forever to get you your food because they're trying to maximize their pay (due to the apps not paying shit and screwing their drivers) and doing multiple orders at once, so your foods cold by the time it gets to you. Sometimes the drivers eat/steal your food.  You have no clue how clean their car is, how they're handling your food etc. You have to deal with shitty, stupid, entitled drivers. Thats not including the aggressive/weirdo/stalker type drivers (which these apps don't bother helping with/punishing, they do not care). You also get screwed by increased prices (because the apps are screwing the businesses), a bunch of added bogus fees the apps add on (that don't go to the drivers either btw).   The only winner here are the ones at the top of these unsustainable apps. They screw everyone else.   Its a luxury service being sold in mass and for cheap. Its not sustainable. Go pick up your own food or eat at the restaurant. Fuck these apps.
I don’t know for sure what changed, but in my state at least hiring delivery drivers as actual employees has become much more difficult. My work has contacted 18 people who applied to be drivers and wasn’t able to hire any of them. We’ve also had drivers who were previously perfectly fine to drive be told they can’t anymore because the stores insurance wouldn’t clear them anymore even though nothing had changed in their driving record.   Hiring a driver as an independent contractor lets you bypass that check entirely since you’re not insuring them or any property involved. Like I said I don’t know why this is but it seems likely that it has something to do with delivery app companies. I’d be interested to know if anybody reading this knows more as it’s been hard to look into in detail.
Too many charges you don't find out about until the order has been paid for. Too many stories of food being eaten by the delivery driver, a picture of someone in a public restroom stall, with the paper bags of someones food sitting on the filthy floor while the did their business. Not messing with that.
I agree with let’s focus on the tipping culture but John Oliver is simping y’all really think they’re gonna make a segment on restraining yourself from giving people free money? Cause it’s like the nice thing to do. Biden would be proud. Lol but yet again we are at a crossroads where it’s humanitarian vs logic. Yes you want to vote for free handouts but is that really the best political approach and solution to the problem.
The devil shreds!
I've stopped ordering from these godawful companies years ago. I only order from the restaurant itself. Usually it's cheaper too since they don't have to pay these bums like 20% of the order value.
Have never ordered delivery in my life. It's a ripoff. I'll get it myself or have something else.
Whoever stopped uploading this on Sunday should be fired.
It‘s up to everyone of us. Don’t use these apps and delete them!
In Europe the term “Americanization” of something is usually used in a negative context — guess why…
I always manually take out, if you make say 40$/hr (or less) => 30$ after tax. Your 20min for manual food take out only cost you 10$ or less in time value, why would you pay huge money for take out?
I was in a 7 11 at 6am recently and a delivery driver was in there oicking up a SINGLE donut and was like, "theyre probably not even gonna tip me..." im like, damn man thats rough!
This is why I don't have respect for people who utilize these services without and real need
People never factor in the destruction to their vehicle. As someone who owns a dealership, these door dashers absolutely kill their cars
What happened to Skype? Microsoft happened.
I actually have a local small delivery company that showed up a few years before the pandemic. Seems they managed to keep the competition of the big ones away. If we insured the companies played within the rules more local delivery companies could do the same thing. In theory there's a lot of efficiency I haven't delivery drivers float between the restaurants that are busy.
Yeah I actually take taxis not instead of Uber unless I'm going right down the road cause it'll be closer to the same with a taxi but if  have to travel like 15 miles I'm taking a taxi all day. Before Uber or lift. People are so dumb for using Uber unless you absolutely have to to get to work or some other emergency take a bus or walk stop. Being a bum
I thought I'd seen this before, but actually, Drew Gooden covered this in pretty much the same depth a while ago.
I’m under 30, and I’m still use the tried and tested call the restaurant and tell your order. But I usually do pick-up, as the restaurants are easy to get to by foot or bike.  The many reason why I don’t use delivery apps, or even websites to do my order is, that I can’t agree to any of theirs privacy policies. They are to data-hungry.
I’ve delivered with Uber for almost a year, GrubHub for six months, was doing them nightly until Amazon Flex became more reliable and better paying around December. It’s been our secondary source of income as my work has gone from 5 to 4 days a week and my wife’s medical conditions prevent her from being able to find full time work. It’s a second job that we can work at together. But totally agree with what is said here. The drivers are taking on a very heavy brunt of the cost and responsibility of this process. And speed and efficiency are prized to the point that you feel like you’re compromising safety to stay on time and to keep getting more. John’s also right on another major thing…the Devil is slaying Johnny in that fiddle battle, not even close.
You just need to read this book "Hangry" to understand how Grubhub changed over time
I remember when my pizza was delivered for free, nobody attempted to overthrow democracy in the USA, nobody thought the earth was flat, and racism was declining.
Before we were married, my hubs worked as a delivery driver for Domino’s. He got minimum wage plus tips also mileage allowance for using his own car. He wasn’t rolling in the money but at least it was a halfway decent compensation package for the time fast forward to now Domino’s charges a delivery fee that DOES NOT go to the driver, you have to tip on top of that to insure the driver gets paid. We usually pay the tip in cash because with many places (not sure if Domino’s does this) if you add your tip to the credit card it can take up to a week before the driver sees that tip.
Look, these companies do plenty of disgusting things. But drivers do know how far they’re driving and how much they’re making before they accept deliveries. The driver who took that delivery to Roosevelt island knew what they were getting themselves into. Both owners of the restaurant where I work also do gig delivery work. If a dash doesn’t make financial sense, they don’t take it. The restaurant also receives orders from these services, and when people order from 20 miles away and don’t tip, no one picks it up. We have orders sit for hours sometimes and then throw them out
"Raw dogging the air"😂😂😂
READ THE BIBLE ITS A PEDOPHILES HANDBOOK
I'm surprised he didn't even mention that the apps (like doordash) literally steal the drivers tips.
I've played a lot of Death Stranding but even in a video game, fuck your package in an emergency situation.
At this point with all of Doordash's fees and tip you can pretty much expect to pay double for your order. A $20 pizza becomes $40. Nah brah. We started calling and placing our orders over the phone like it's 1986 baby.
Learn to fry your damn eggs.
I work in a tiny cafe in Seattle and this (Grubhub randomly adding our cafe to their site, somehow taking photos of some of our pastries --which change daily-- and creating a set menu that we do not have, even creating some items we have never made, then ppl from grubhub showing up and showing us their phone to pick up the order and being like?? We don't have grubhub nor do we have these items, nor did we have any way of being notified that an order 'had been placed'. usually there is only 1 person sometimes 2 working at the same time we cannot keep up with in-person and delivery which is why we do not do delivery) 100% happened to me! I had no idea it was happening to other bussinesses as well!
Why hasn't the restaurant association made there own NONPROFIT Delivery app.!!!!
Human Squidward
Companies: we aren’t making money … maybe stoping spending so much money lobbying?? Avocado toast of 21st century tech companies
Millennials have 3 massive Ls, good comedy there.
I LOVED working as a delivery driver for doordash, BUT I had to stop when I realized I was LOSING money due to gas 💀 It really sucks that corporate greed is the only thing keeping me from doing a job that I WANT TO DO 🤬
so that horse's sperm is worth much more then the sperm of any person in the world and I can do math in my head, can that horse, huh?
Oh heck no, never advocate for tipping, it's the worst.
I'm very confused.. how are these companies not making huge profits? All they have to do is put a website online.. they barely have any customer service.. they don't "do" anything.. and they are making half the money a restaurant makes.. the only costs I can think about are advertising and lobbying to get politicians on their side..
There has only been one time I would have ordered from a food delivery service, and that was when I had just given birth. Couldn’t leave the house. I lived off whatever meal my own mother brought to me, whatever my husband could manage to find at the grocery store, or pizza delivery from only two pizza services that would deliver to my house. I remember reading about new upcoming services, like über, but for food. I thought how wonderful that would be to have something, anything, delivered that wasn’t pizza. But they were doing it in test markets like San Jose, and NYC. I remembered there being services for grocery delivery, as early as the 90s, but couldn’t figure out who in my area would do that. Seriously, 2012 was some truly dark times! Was there not some errand boy I could hire?!? Some kind of task rabbit if you will?  Fast forward to now, and I still don’t use them. Whether it’s a food app, or actual restaurant delivery employees, I will order it myself, drive there, and pick it up. No tip, no delivery fee, only person who touched my food is the cook, and I can get it incredibly faster! Even better during the pandemic, because gas was $1 a gallon, and no one on the road. I owned the city! It was mine!   I had to make sure I always called though if the restaurants used third party apps/sites because, yeah, restaurants lose that money. One local restaurant was advertising a $10 off coupon for your first order on “slice.” I ordered, got my discount, drove there, and the restaurant hadn’t even received my order yet! I wasn’t used to waiting at this place. They explained that what was going on was that since they did not have an online storefront, they used this other company called Slice. When I place the order, they in return call up the restaurant and place the order for me, then charges the restaurant! So I have to wait longer, the restaurant loses money, all because I didn’t want to call an talk to a human.  And it’s worse when you try to look up restaurants on google maps, because they will have that order button, and from there you can order through these third parties. The button is before the call button and the website button. Sometimes you can order straight from the website
I'm starting to think John really likes horses.
You are the Problem why this happened!
Tipping has gotten way out of hand in the U.S.  I disagree that we should be tipping anyone.  Just pay workers their due.
What happened to releasing the full episodes?
Good content. Mediocre jokes. 4/10
at least in gaza they don't have problems with food delivery since there is 0 food been delivered since aid workers are getting killed over there.
Milennial.  There, two L's.  Mi77ennia7.  Zero L's.
I won’t use delivery apps because I can no longer bike in NYC due to speeding delivery e-bikes. I don’t blame the drivers. I know they are just trying to work as hard as they can. It just sucks that the bike lanes are so dangerous now.
So millions of ppl spend billions of dollars on food delivery apps but the delivery folk aren't making money, the restaurants aren't making money, and the CEOs "aren't making money" (bc that happens).  So where's it going?  2+2+2 CAN'T equal less than 6.  Somebody has the money.   Billions of dollars in revenue does not just disappear. Who was the last person to see it...the CEOs? (That was rhetorical)  We know they ain't paying drivers, the restaurants or refunding the customers...  ...but then again, maybe they're telling the truth (u know, like Rich folk always do).
God damn you John Oliver you and your show are too good 🙌🔥🔥🔥
Considering the number of fk’d up main stories this show has done it’s time US citizens look at ourselves & ask why we allow everyone with a business model to fk us over or, more precisely, why do elected officials fk us over. Better still, why vote when the data clearly shows declining outcomes yearly for citizens but not corporations or politicians bank accounts. 12 years of the US education system & none of it is financial literacy.
Why can't we just raise prices, pay workers, and eliminate tipping culture? That would be preferable to one side being annoyed and the other underpaid.
This is so crazy. We were better off without Uber and Lyft, and tge same goes for these food delivery apps. People need to be paid a living wage. These companies also sound like their business models aren't profitable or sustainable.
All these delivery/rideshare apps have a fundamentally problematic business model, because they have to continually dance the tightrope of trying to pay drivers enough to drive for you, trying to not overcharge customers so as to not lose their business, and take a big enough cut to justify their multi-billion valuations, especially now that, with rising interest rates, all the free venture capital money they were using to keep their business afloat while they ran it unprofitably has dried up.  Im not saying that it is an *impossible* balance, but damn, is that a tough line to walk.
Your entire call to action is pushing the problem off of corporations and onto consumers
My wife's brother used to do Door Dash until he got a real job, but we use that red Door Dash pizza box container looking bag with handles all the time. It's a great insulated bag with handles for carrying hot or cold food.
The minimum tip should be $5 no matter how small your order is.
Yeah, my wife and I have to resort to delivery for one of these monsters to allow us to get gas or food between paychecks. We know full well we are being exploited, but we're hungry and we got to get to work. This is life at age 60.
Unionize.
Why the fuck is tipping basically required? If you can't provide your employees a living wage, you should not exist as a company
I've mostly stopped using those services, but when I do I make sure to buy big. It sucks to pay more than double for a single burger after fees, delivery fees, driver fees, tips, just the tip, and everything else.  Get enough for a few meals and it's almost worth it, at least for the buyer. Still sucks for the restaurant, and the driver.
Everyone needs to see if your city has a bike courier service that delivers food. It usually cheaper, gets to you faster, and supports locally owned courier companies and workers.
I deliver part time 3-4 nights a week and it’s really tough when people don’t tip
I live in Norway so i don't have, to worry about this kinda stuff our government protects us.
So my brother is a restaurant owner and when DoorDash came to our town they posted my brothers menu on their website and said that they were a DoorDash partner. The issue is they never even contacted my brother and to make matters worse they found a very old menu from Facebook and posted that one on their site so people kept calling and complaining that their order on DoorDash cost more than advertised and complained that they didn’t have what they wanted to order. Fuck DoorDash.
When my Grubhub driver takes 45 minutes to deliver something that's 4 minutes from my house, they are NOT getting a tip. In fact, the restaurant called me asking me to call the driver. He was still at home. He told me he would leave "in a minute." Not all drivers deserve tips. Normally I tip *very* well and have a bag of fun sized candies waiting for them to boot. I really appreciate the help getting dinner delivered sometimes as a single mom in university who also works and volunteers a lot.
I saw this video like 3 or 4 days ago and while watching it cut out, and now its up again? Wtf John?
ATMs are a thing! Always TIP IN CASH!
Just as an addition: as a former Uber driver, I can tell you a score of three stars is considered "failure" and if you get three, 3 star reviews you are put on suspension and if you get any additional three-star ratings you're fired. Even one single three star rating will knock down your overall rating (a percentage of 100) to into the 70s and getting it back up to 100 is nearly impossible. 100% drivers will have more jobs pop up. Lower scores reduce the amount of deliveries you can choose from or even are offered. So both tips and ratings are important. If someone doesn't rate you that can become a problem, if it were to happen too often even though it is not in your control.
I've ordered a single piece of cake haha. But it's because I exercise and know that if I order more cake, I will try to eat it and regret it, thus ruining my gains for the week. That being said, I ALWAYS tip because I'm not a monster.
John Oliver is like an ancient egyptian god that you go to for information, but infront of him is a scale, on one side is your happiness and the other side is your sadness, each bit of Information cost you some of your happyness until only sadness remains. :/
I haven’t got passed the first minute. I HOPE that he tells me something awful about them so I feel really bad using them and stop.
The message i get from this, is and im high but just don't use.
Props to the LWT team for exposing the typical corporate greed and how hard these gig workers have to push themselves to fulfill everyone’s needs- except, virtually, their own. That being said, to my fellow NY’er’s reading this, there isn’t a New Yorker among us who, on a daily basis, sees delivery guys on their electric bikes or mopeds, speeding through red lights, racing past people trying to cross the street, doing what they need to do to keep their jobs…and who can blame them? Be that as it may, it doesn’t make it fair, or right, that we have an over-abundance of delivery people in this city seriously putting pedestrians in harms way. Every day. All the time. A friend’s mother was killed because a delivery person went right though a red light and knocked her head onto the sidewalk. There is zero regulation. Mopeds and e-bikes don’t have to be licensed. Don’t get me started on cheaply made lithium-ion batteries for these bikes we read about, regularly catching fire left and right. Our local government allows them on SUBWAYS. This has all gotten way out of hand and there needs to be some official, reasonable reckoning for all- delivery people and New Yorkers just trying to safely cross the street. I’m worried about my elderly parents. You should be, about yours, too.
How the food delivery apps treat the restaurant is the reason why my family has gone back to calling the restaurant itself to order.
Just after you were born, a person,  or people, gave you some measure of loving kindness, some amount of compassionate understanding. If not, you would not be alive now. That was your introduction to life, the implicit knowledge that loving kindness and compassionate understanding are indispensable for human life to exist.  The foundation of human life, therefore, is loving kindness and compassionate understanding.  As we age we are taught otherwise by damaged people. 💔  Their misdirection is rarely intentional. They are simply sick due to their own early learning experiences/trauma.  Once this is understood,  we can seek help to dismantle the wrong thinking that we were taught and insert, through daily practice, right thinking, and thereby right actions. The teacher that I have learned from is Thich Nhat Hahn, and the practitioners who learned from him before me. weezi-💜🙏💖🙏🤠
I've never liked delivery apps because, everything costs more, you have to tip, and your food 9/10 times is cold. Much rather would just go get it myself.
It blows my mind that these places exist 😂 How addicted to fast food & pure laziness are Americans? I'm American & I don't understand it
That single laugh at 21:33 :D
How the hell are they not making money but can afford to spend 184 million on lobbying? That's bull, they are making big money.
I haven’t used food delivery apps in 10 years.   Y’all pseudo intellectuals wait for John Oliver to say something is wrong or bad and then act on it. Act on it now lol.
Uber Eats allows consumers to "pre-tip" the drivers and we drivers can see that. We get to decide if what you are willing to pay us for the delivery is worth our time. We are under no obligation to accept your order if we feel it's too low for the time taken (that's what gig work means, we have a choice). That's why many customers can't seem to find an Uber Eats driver to pick up their food. You are in a bidding war with customers that do pre-tip. I myself have been pinged with coffee delivery orders that are 30 miles away for $4 with no pre-tip. We can't afford to count on your good graces after the fact to make it worth while. Furthermore, the 20% tip rule doesn't work for delivery drivers the way it works for wait-staff, who can service multiple tables in an hour. I am stuck servicing one customer for the duration of the delivery. In short, if you want to know how much to tip your delivery driver, I suggest "the maximum amount you are willing to pay someone so you don't have to put on pants and get it yourself." Then hope the driver agrees with you. If not, you can now put on your own pants and save yourself that money.
6:54 get Marty>11 investigated
I've been waiting someone to set the record straight on "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" since it came out. A fur spell.
I work at a restaurant where at least once a week we get a call from an angry customer saying there Doordash order was never delivered. It usually some $60 order that needs to be remade most of the time. So the diver steals the order.
Food delivery drivers get fewer tips than streetwalkers. Tip your drivers and waiters. It's just the tip. The tip never hurt anyone. Unless you're a streetwalker.
These companies should be investigated thoroughly to see if they really aren’t making a profit.
I was a waitress at a small restaurant with like seven tables to worry about, and I thought it would be a really easy and chill job for me. Unfortunately, I also had five tablets spread throughout the store. They were all provided by a different delivery app. Each of them would make their own distinct noise, and I would have to run over to them, accept them in a certain amount of time or the app would call the store (I had like maybe a minute before this happened, but until then it would continually ring and loudly. I could never figure out how to turn it down) Then I would have to manually enter the order into a different system that the store originally uses for their orders. I was the only waitress on shift a lot. This job was my own personal hell but I was trying to move and I didn’t have enough time to get a new job.   Not only was all of that a lot to deal with, but between all of my tables, the tablets going off and making the phone ring if I wasn’t fast enough (or god forbid two go off at the same time) I also had to package all the orders myself, and deal with the dashers.  I know that they’re being underpaid, but some of the dashers were the worst part about my job. If they thought the order was taking too long, they’d want to yell at me about it. Most of the time there was a language barrier too that added to the confusion. I’ve had grown men grab me and shake me because they’re mad about how long it’s taking.   It’s not a sustainable practice. I’ve talked to the other workers who work restaurants along that street and they’re all like this.
2:15 As a 9th grader, that was hilarious to me
Not saying this doesn’t happen in Europe, but the situation seems way more brutal in the US. Anyway, regardless of the continent, this is capitalism at its best… So sad.
this is a perfect example why socialism doesn't work.
These shorter re-uploads confuse me cuz I'm like, "wait... I've already seen this, what happened?"
Omg. I forgot about Skype.
I wanted to start an orphanage, but I wasn't sure how to fund it.  So I decided to work for Grubhub for a few hours and day and now I can start my orphanage for baby hippos.
I work in a restaurant and the delivery drivers are all rude as hell, totally unprofessional-- they make the job alot harder than it has to be. We cant even turn off the online orders when something is wrong with a kitchen or we're understaffed, and we never get tips from them even though they're the majority of the orders we fulfill some nights. I really resent these delivery services
Jesus... I had absolutely *no* idea that some of these apps took HALF OF THE ORDER MONEY! How is that in any way sustainable?!
The chipotle I go to does have great food. Unfortunately every single worker ( I am being literal) spends the entire time attempting like their paycheck depends on it to get into a fist fight with me. Then after all that they hand me my food, I pay, and they pointedly look at their tip jar. It feels like I just walked into a social experiment. It's a weird weird place. And it's hard to piss me off. I was brainwashed by my mother to be exceptionally polite to people who are actively hurting me. But even I save my tip for the comparatively cheerful homeless people who I Will encounter on the way back to my car.
16:30 Corporate priorities create dangerous traffic issues 17:10 Delivery driving is currently among the most deadly jobs in the country
it's honestly insane that we're getting these apps at a "discount" when it way too expensive as it is, can't imagine what the prices will look like when they jack up the prices lol
Hi John, if you didn’t already do a segment on Lyft and Uber taking the lion’s share 50% - 65% of every fare leaving the driver with only 35% - 50% when the driver uses their personal car and shoulders all associated expenses.
(Me clicking this completely scared he’s going to ruin food delivery)
I've ordered dumb things like the slice of cake but I tip well
You should have also finished the video with a statement to everyone who doesn’t actually rely on food delivery because they are disabled or have young children telling them to get off their ass and go to a restaurant, or go to the grocery store and make food at home like an adult.
I unironically like the orphanages idea.
Damn I’m hungry now
Im happy to live in a place where, when u order food online, its the same price as ordering it in person. (some restaurants jack up their prices but thats rare). Plus there rnt a bunch of different taxes that make the prices go waaay up.  Also, no tipping culture here. I do tip a bit if the weather is crap but otherwise, nope. It aint on me to pay them, thats on the restaurants/apps/industry itself.  Ive lived in places where its normal to say "keep the change" if sth costs 4.60 and u give them a 5. They say thanks and thats it.  Also lived somewhere where its normal to have a 10-15% service charge that gets added to the bill, and that was fine.  But to have to tip someone no matter the actual service, and then to get an attitude if they feel like it wasnt enough? Or to have to tip for ordering online? Why? How about the industry takes care of its workers instead of making it the responsibility of the customers and not the employers for some reason.
I'm sorry but as a side gig worker some of this shit is the workers fault.  It supposed to be a side gig. Also taking trips with low pay and getting mad when they don't tip is 100% the order takers fault, I said what I said
Grubhub is fucking trash.  Don't use it. Convince everybody you know to not use it.
I remember a friend who was a GM for a restaurant screaming on the phone for months because grub hub had added them to their app using menus from over 10 years ago so the prices were extremely off and some food didn't even get made there anymore.
Regarding the "no tip" slice of cake: one of our delivery guys told us if we tip through the app, that money does not go to the delivery person. We're not sure if it's even going to the restaurant or if it's going to the app company (by the logo I'm guessing gubhub, they're called lieferando in germany).  So, tip cash to the driver and never as part of you bill in the app.
They dont interview the drivers..the apps r snake oil..and ppl blame the respective restaurant and not the app
EAT  THE RICH Hell you can even have them cooked for you and delivered.
Bottom friendly menu. Well, my jaw is at the bottom... of the floor.
The fact you're advocating for tips is wild instead of advocating for companies to pay their employees more and their CEO's less.
I remember Prop 22 here in CA; sus behavior that's turned me off from those companies.
I'm still not following how any of this isn't stuff the market can fix.
Not every one has embrace apps  But going to get food is now inconvenient.   So now I cook my own food.
Dont accept the delivery if you can't afford it.
I have a restaurant in France. We tried Uber eats during the pandemic. They took 30% commission, charged the customers a fortune for the delivery distance and kept listing our Italian restaurant in the Asian cuisine section :-)  Ended up doing delivery myself. The petrol costs were a lot less and had an excuse to break curfew!
That orphanage thing is gonna happen
Why don't the restaurants compete by not having delivery employees on staff standing around, but a network of delivery drivers nearby the restaurants just like delivery services. Adapt, learn, compete.
Damn the full episode upload was a mistake 😂
*****food delivery in the USA****** here in the EU health is tax paid.
One of the most important segments ever in this show  PLEASE do a follow up on 1) how all corporations are using this model to elude labor law 2) how corporations are using tipping culture as wages
People - stop using these apps. Restaurants - you cannot bitch about commissions and fees while actively participating in the app. If people and restaurants didn't use it, they wouldn't be around. This is kind of a lame story for John. Yup, a third party tech system using free market couriers is going to cost the customer, there are no free lunches. And yes, anything concerning the general population in a service is going to have scams, corruption and illegal activity. Just like every other service to the masses, you take a certain risk, especially in risky areas, this is why they have return/dispute policies. If you got burned, take the L and never use the service again.
They should also bring up the huge issue of the delivery person not matching the profile, Which usually means the person has a violent criminal history and cannot get a profile with Thier real identity... I'd say 50% of my orders turn up this way... Uber eats does not care about the safety of the customers one bit and has never made it right when it gets reported
I have literally never had a good experience with any delivery app..  the food is cold, the order is invariably wrong or something is missing..  and it costs more..    NO THANKS
Wait, these companies charge 50% more than it costs to pick it up my self, BEFORE TIP, and they aren't profitable? Sounds like a management problem.
I mean it could hardly be a surprise that these services are complete shit.. they are like the worst part of uber mixed with the worst part of ticketmaster combined..
Joke writing is on point in this episode
I've been yelled at by restaurants who weren't on Postmates as if I listed them. I'm just the driver, I don't know 💩 about what contracts they have.
John is wrong, regardless of ur interest in one over the other, Johnny exhibits great technical fiddling skill while the Devil is simply moving the bow back and forth really quickly up and down the strings which literally anyone can do even if they've never touched a fiddle before. And the Devil's band doesn't count because this isn't a contest of who can perform the best, it's who's the best fiddler. That's why the Devil admits he's won lol cuz it was Obvious to someone who understands fiddling
Im in the lucky position to have several excellent takeaways just around the corner. I would never think of using these exploitating food apps.
It's been five years since I've used any such app.  I strongly recommend the same to all.
I think one of the biggest problems of the apps being able to consider gig workers as independent contractors is that the "independent contractor" don't get to set their own rates. They're stuck with whatever the app gives them. If you can set, or negotiate your rates, you're a employee. Even the Etsy jewelry making cousin is more independent contractor than a gig worker.
The fact that these companies aren't even profitable is the biggest gut punch of all. Delivery drivers are slaving away and holding restaurant chains hostages to their evil corporations, and it's not even being done for the shareholders! It's being done because they're playing the long game, sinking tons of money into these services every year in the hopes that they can starve out every company that has in-house delivery drivers. Then, they'll start making a profit because they'll be the only thing left.
Skype didn't screw anything up. They sold to Microsoft, which rebranded Lync as Skype for Business; they retired that brand and incorporated the product into Microsoft Teams which is doing very well. Teams and Zoom are the two biggest players, although I'm in a Cisco WebEx meeting as I type this.
I've never used any of these because I don't want to pay more for my food.
"The main winner so far has actually been us, the customers."  Sure, John. That's why my last DD order came out to $62.57. For one meal, for one human. Because I'm winning so hard.
more like; you can order a single slice of cake? are there no minimum amounts you have to order, like won't deliver orders under 20$?
yeah wtf happened to Skype
only used delivery apps twice. the fist time it gave me a discount, the second time i payed more then twice what the price of the meal costs, and both times something was wrong or missing from the order. they are a scam.
I have often thought that the Devil was the winner when he went down to Georgia, and it was very generous of him to say that he lost.
John WOULD rate someone 4/5 stars for jizzing in his food.
I’m sick and tired of delivering guys riding bikes at high speeds on the sidewalks in Manhattan.
As a DoorDash/GrubHub/Instacart driver I so appreciate you bringing attention to this issue.  All I do is drive around all day listening to stuff like this about social issues and catastrophize.  God bless America.
honestly have never got an order delivered correctly once from any app. surprised there isn't a class action lawsuit about messing up so many orders. on top of everything else
THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!  I have ALWAYS thought the Devil's song was better!!! And I mean always, I was 10 when it came out. There's nothing wrong w/Johnny & his Blues/Country. It's the first genre of uniquely "American" music & that's great! But, the Devil's song was Funk, Disco & even some Prog Rock! That's what the kids were calling radio stations to request.😈❤‍🔥🎻❤‍🔥😈
Delivery apps were a godsend when i had covid
Johnny boi must have got a new writer cause I’ve been watching since day one and I’ve never heard him use the word raw dogging lol
Now kids will have backpacks like those...
WE HATE THAT WE GET THE VIDEOS LATE ON YOUTUBE!!! ARE YOU GETTING COCKY JOHN!!??
Who cares?
Grubhub is so cutthroat, back in 2016 I delivered for them with a motorcycle and got in an accident due to a road condition.  My leg got pinned under the bike and got ate up by the road, had road rash ankle to knee, so i call dispatch from the back of an ambulance and the response was “is the order intact?” and “can we send someone to retrieve the order from you to complete the order?”  Funniest part was the person they sent had NO idea the scene they were heading for and they show up to see me sitting on the back of an ambulance fender, leg covered in blood, refusing a trip to the hospital because I can’t afford  it.    Great company, great business model 👍
I stopped using deliver apps years ago when their "convenience fees" made it more expensive than pickup orders. Shocking that their jacked-up prices still don't cover costs.
Bit depressing that at the end of his usual round of ''the system is fucked'' his answer to what you can do boiled down to ''Just continue to feed the system with your money and engagement''.
Tech bros are destroying the world as we know it. Not because of their contributions, but because of their insatiable business models that necessitate ignoring the human aspect.
Yeh thankfully this shit qint so bad in europe they get paid enough not to require tips
John, please write a similar story about how microstock agencies are ripping off their artist contributors who are only getting 15-30% of the sales.
Worked in a dark kitchen in Paris back in August 2022. This is where the burgers that people order on food delivery apps gets made—not a restaurant, just a kitchen that opens straight into the street with no seating area. I had to prepare the sauces and pack the orders into their bags, and the two Sri Lankan cooks made the burgers; we had to work at an industrial pace, especially on weekends, and at least I only worked a few hours a day.  The delivery guys outside, most of whom didn't speak a lick of French and barely more English, were always very anxious about getting their orders as fast as possible because if they were late the apps' algorithms made them less likely to be selected again and they risked losing tips (even though tipping isn't part of the culture here because personnel services are paid for by the employer). I'm also guessing these guys didn't have much of a choice working as "self-employed" on these apps given how I doubt any of them had residency or work permits which would've allowed them to get other jobs. The boss told us to put a table in front of the entrance where we put orders to prevent the delivery guys from coming in to prevent altercations. It was a harsh look at how Uberized capitalism treats vulnerable people such as undocumented migrants like cogs in its machine to satisfy customer impulses it largely creates.
I deliver for Doordash.  I've delivered a can of Coke, a bubble tea...and since the order is small,  the tip is small or non-existent, regardless of how far you are driving.
Thank you, John for always shining a light on the gritty side of everything! ❤
The whole tipping culture in the states is kinda sick anyway. And that has nothing to do with the gig economy.
Why is it upon customers to pay tips for the deliveries? If it ain't enough, increase the price!
Out where I live none of those services will bring anything but after watching this, even if they did I sure as hell wouldn't use them.
I miss old uber pricing
Not sure how they aren't making money. Must be wasting it all marketing
I really don’t know how some people would lie and say they don’t get their food just for the refund, fucking over the delivery driver and the restaurant. One time I reported my food missing but the driver just went out of his way to put it closer to my door and I didn’t see it until the NEXT DAY and i felt like SHIT because I couldn’t do anything about it
The point of the food app companies campaigning hard for prop 22 shows how brain dead voters are and believe any campaign ad if you show it enough times.
Working at a papa johns, I can say that doordash is the BANE of my existence at work. Drivers are cut because we can just dash it and we don't have the manpower to make food on time. And dashers steal orders all the time
I especially love DD bc they’ll allow customers to offer $.50 or $.25 or even $0 in tip, add to that the now reduced to $2.00 base pay, and they expect you to go 5, 10, 19 miles. So either you decline and reduce your placement in the pecking order reducing your chances of getting decent offers, or you effectively deliver for little, free, or even lose money on the delivery. The former is a viscous cycle that inevitably screws you, and latter, well, the same. I’m trying to make a living. I’m not doing this to be charitable.
Tipping culture is stupid. Pay workers their fair wage.
It seems like the main function of apps in today's market is to paper over worker exploitation.  Which is annoying, because food delivery can potentially be a more environmentally sustainable way to get good food to people. If I buy chicken from the grocery store, I have to store it, usually for more than a week unless I want to eat the same thing every day. That means I need to freeze it, either before or after cooking it if I want it to stay good, which means disposable plastic bags. And driving too and from the store is quite inefficient too, while walking to it would be great, most people don't live within easy walking distance of the store. While upgrading our cities so more people can walk to every place they regularly need to go is something we should do, it will take quite a long time, and before it gets done we are likely to have drones that can deliver far more efficiently. Delivered food can be sent in small enough quantities that the packaging doesn't need to last more than a few days, so it can be made of properly biodegradable (or safe for incineration in a waste to energy plant) materials. Food can be shipped in bulk to restaurants, keeping packaging too a minimum, and they can have less food thrown away to spoilage the food consumption of large number of people is more consistent than a single person or small family. If we set the system up well, it will cost less and have lower environmental impact than even cooking at home. But right now the system is set up to profit app companies at the expense of everyone else and the planet.
I do delivery full time. Back during the pandemic - I got a one star rating that DoorDash (DD) never took off because the customer wouldn't believe that she was the one who forgot to tell the restaurant that she wanted her food at 8p. I tried to deliver at 710p, not knowing about the timing she wanted. I spent another 45 minutes during a dinner rush talking to both DD and the restaurant to see if they would take the food back and remake it. They wouldn't and said that the customer didn't tell them when she wanted the food. So, at 755p, I had to deliver the meal, apologizing that I couldn't get it fixed. She (an elderly woman), griped, "Oh, now it's going to be cold and not tasty." Despite the fact that the food was in a thermal bag the entire time. I lost out on most of a dinner rush, and got a one star rating for $2.75, no tip. @#%%&*$#%$ DD never took off that rating, even though it KNOWS that it was not my fault. I have a 100% completion rate, a 92% on time rate, and 5 stars other than that one star that bitch tortures me with. One of my clients gave me a $117 tip for a catering order that same year. You would think a pizza was worth something....Yes, by the way, I blame DD for all of it. And the old lady. Damn them both.
Careful, John. The Evangelical nutjobs already think you're a Satanist just because you're a liberal. They don't understand parody, so they'll just assume that you're _literally_ rooting for the Devil.
That first Dasher was right on. I dash in Michigan and no kidding on the weekend I would say 7 of 10 deliveries are to baked citizens, and its great for business.
22:46 what’s the minimum pay rate?
I worked as contractor with a gig company as a programmer. I got a bad review because i overbooked then got sick. I was a noob. That one bad review got me kicked off the site for over ten years.
21:40 Wisconsin doesn't care 😥 The delivery apps are extracting wealth from the most vulnerable populations.
the judge that allowed delivery drivers to be set as independent contractors was either a total idiot or paid very very well by the company.
Restaurants are no longer 24 hours  Chain places are getting rid of there non drive through locations  Chain places don’t take cash  If you walk in .... there are almost 15 employee taking care of the drive through and app customers You have to use a clunky kiosk Restaurants close early and open late  If you do t have a car you can’t get food late at night In my city  Food trucks are not allowed to drive around.  Chain restaurants that are open at noon are empty  Coffee shops give better service to customers then restaurants
Around here in the north west, food delivery without tips included don't get delivered... They just sit at the restaurant :/ Until delivery apps assign someone to bundle em together.
Side hustle should be to fast forward your desire for luxuries not to sustain themselves. A single job may not be pleasure full or satisfying but it should be bare enough to not be socially vulnerable.
But John,m during a natural disaster is the only time you can make good money on those apps! XD
Working for Uber Eats sucks!!!  Working for Door Dash sucks!!!  Working for Grub Hub Sucks!!!
Can’t wait for the ghost kitchens segment!
I worked for Postmates for a short timer and it was a nightmare. A startup run by a bunch of twenty somethings that could barely manage day to day but had NO sense of a bigger picture. Operations changed on an almost daily basis according to whatever they thought might work. No consistency, no broader vision, just a project du jour clusterfuck of a company.
I stopped using delivery apps a few years ago when restrictions dropped. It's so expensive for nothing.
End stage capitalism in its death throes.  Food delivery apps are a great example of how to use technology to make superfluous nonsense that is ultimately a scam.
No John, no. It's not ethical. Go pick up your food man. Send an assistant... Fuck these apps. You need delivery Go classic... Make sure it's a pizza place or sandwich place with their own delivery team... Absolutely positively no excuse to use any of these delivery gig apps
just love his unyielding attraction to horses....lol
John Oliver is a gem.
It's insane how no one is making money here when it's an extra $15 just to get some tacos from ten minutes away.
I'm so glad this episode came out. I've been appalled by delivery and 'gig' apps for a while. I've been surprised to not see much coverage on just how predatory and forced they are, and so many restaurants just never were and still aren't equipped for it. When are workers going to stop being disposable subcontractors?
What John doesn't mention about the business model is that the people who start these businesses are the only big winners because succeed or fail the owners, CEOs, investors all make huge amounts of money while the business is running whether or not the business is making money and then it's a windfall if the business is bought out by a bigger company for billions.  Uber is a good example of that. The co- owner CEO pulled many dirty tricks along the way to a billion dollar pay off. I'm confident he couldn't care less about the business or its success because he wins either way. That's business as usual at the top. No accountability and then a huge bonus regardless of success.
"The Millennial Lifestyle Subsidy", gods, fuck that guy. I delivered throughout most of my college tenure, and it wasn't the younger customers that screwed me over the most, it was the middle class and richer townies who thought they had the right to determine whether I ate that week or not. That's not even getting into the bullshit practice of companies foisting their responsibility to pay their own employees off on customers - customers Shouldn't have to pay us our wages, and yet we live in a society that has decided to subsidize these companies.  I delivered for Dominos and later an Italian restaurant in college - my weekly hours anywhere between 20 hours to 60, all "part-time" with no benefits - and during the pandemic I delivered for Pizza Hut. In 2021 I tried Doordash while searching for a better paying job - Anything that wasn't food related, I have too many literal burns scars on my arms for customers who need to have their dinner Now.  I can say a lot of trash about Dominos and other restaurants and how shitty they are to their employees, but at least I was getting some pay, and I could get some comfort and community with my employees after an inevitable customer decided they were more entitled to life than us.  Doordash though? I actually ended up quitting after only maybe a month of that. The only way to make any amount of money was to drive dangerously. I used to routinely deliver four to ten orders at a time back in college - I knew the delivery area and could pair orders up efficiently. But doordash doesn't have a delivery area, they just have what is next, and if something cropped up in the middle of a delivery, a notification pops up and asks if you want to accept it - while you are Driving. If I didn't accept it, it counted that as a rejection, and rejecting orders was a negative mark on your account. There was no guarantee though that the new order was on the same route I was on, so if I just accepted it without looking I ran the risk of accepting an order that I could not safely get to within the time allotted - Another negative mark.  I am impressed by drivers who are able to make that system work, and deeply angry that it is set so against them. Ten years in customer service, and I will always side with the worker over the customer, but I know that most of the time? Customers don't really understand how shitty the situation is - so many tell me they didn't even know drivers rely on tips, or that anything less than five stars can lead to hours reductions and employee loss, which negatively affects their performance in a fucked up cycle that only the company could actually stop, but clearly don't care to. Why improve performance when you can just shit all over your employees And customers?  My current job is also mandatory part-time to avoid benefits, and pretty much everyone has multiple jobs. One of my coworkers has a desk job in the morning, closes with us, and doordashes "on the side" to pay his bills and support his family.  I don't even know how to end this. Just, any working model that requires your employees to work three jobs just to survive? That's not acceptable.
“Can’t spell millennial without three massive L’s” 🤣
I deleted all the delivery apps plus my accounts. I was being so stupid, complaining about how I'm poor and yet spending hundreds or even over a grand a month on food delivery. It's actually addictive. I got rid of all of them, and now just eat at home. Plus it got to the point that my order was wrong about half the time. Either they forgot my drink, the food arrived cold because of drivers not carrying hot bags, I even had a driver steal my food once. It's not worth it, just do Walmart pickup if you're too busy to shop and eat at home.
I’ve never used a app like this. I just got off my@rse, drove to my favorite restaurant as they went to drive through, and paid them a bigger tip that I did before.
I like how you wanna pick and choose your capitalism 😂 They take advantage of lazy people, and businesses are too lazy to stop it. Lazy on top of lazy=profit 🤷‍♂️
Any rating system that "expects" 5 stars is useless.  5 Stars should indicate GREAT performance.
I used to Uber and tried adding food delivery to my repertoire.   No. This industry needs to be eliminated. It's slavery. All the money I made ubering most of it was from my income tax refund because I didn't make anything. I put 6 years of miles on my car in a matter of 8 months and spent damn near $2,000 a month.  Do not order. It may feel like you're not supporting the workers... But this industry needs to be eliminated that needs to be eliminated. The food delivery system is bad it's a scam like I was being screwed by Uber doing regular Ubers like no this I wouldn't even touch this I did maybe three or four deliveries and said this is not sustainable at all nope.
Anyone know why these are being uploaded on Thursdays? Watching these used to be my favorite thing about Mondays
And another thing , if someone curses in the youtube video im watching i should be able to curse in the comments of the same f******  video.
What if, what if workers just refused those jobs? Reality most of the gig workers won't want to do anything else
Save the businesses, eff the workers. Yeah, that sounds like America to me.
omg that pride commercial. I especially love the one dude laughing in the audience while trying to say "What?"
i was already getting myself off these apps but i think this seals the deal, im not using this anymore lol
Do you mind doing a segment on systemic ableism? It's a problem that is effecting me personally, and a lot of people don't believe it exists or don't care. And the amount of people that think accomodations are special privileges is... a big issue. (Ableist PE teachers are the worst!)
I don't understand this love of creating a victim. Gig drivers aren't forced to be drivers. Find another job.
Man, you have no idea how ubereats mess up both driver and customers. One time, I ordered a burger and thought they were going to deliver from my hometown, and I made sure just by looking at the address. Nope, they purposely deceive you by ordering from that restaurant the next city over, and the food was cold by the time it arrived because of the traffic on the freeway. Another time, I made a delivery and spent about 20-30 minutes from one city to the next and to my surprise, they have a restaurant three blocks from where they live. I told them where I was coming from and they were shocked. So I told them to use the restaurant's app because ubereats can't trick you.
I REALLY wish he would have talked about tip baiting and how people dangle huge tips on their order and then delete the tip after the fact maliciously and on purpose
Personally Uber Eats have given me more than 10k over 2 years with their offers and all, now they have up their prices and I switched to pick up 😂
ohhh no no no i will NOT take this johnny slander. the text even says ‘a band of demons joined in’ during the devil’s part, which of course is going to sound better than a single fiddle. but instead of trying to copy the devil’s discordant screeches, johnny plays well known folk songs like fire on the mountain and house of the rising sun, songs he knows like the back of his hand and even the DEVIL can’t beat that. otherwise an awesome episode as always mr oliver
Was hoping he’d mention how the food prices themselves are increased even before they add in the delivery and service fees.
all delivery apps total rip off all restaurants and delivery drivers. restaurants lose money on most deliveries and most delivery drivers make pennies.
Just eat out. Leave your house. It's fun!
I remember hearing a story about a pizza place that was approached to partner with a delivery app but the owner decided to turn them down. The app company ignored his wishes and put his restaurant on the service anyway. He had noticed that in order to draw customers to their app, they were pricing the pizzas significantly less than what they cost to make (the whole "lose money now so we can corner the market and charge more later" strategy), so he simply ordered a bunch of pizzas from himself and pocketed the difference.
Technical feudalism as Yanis Valopouris calls it...
Insta-Cart is the worst!
Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Blinkit are the real crazy apps
Don’t get mad at the customer for not tipping enough, get mad your employer for not paying enough!!
No I’m not going to give 5 stars “unless something is massively wrong”
Im never using any off these delivery apps again. And why the hell is dominos so d*** expensive?? I get 1 large pizza delivery with a 2 topping coupon its like 25 dollars before the tip... Then they tell  mejust saved like 18 dollars😂😂😂😂😂😂. And yes sometimes i get extra cheese. and god forbid i get a c** shot size side of habanero sauce, which is like a buck fifty.
grubhub signing you up without request - just like that random guy who starts washing your windows at a stoplight and wants paid.
im too poor to tip sometimes. if I can I can, but sometimes moneys tight
Can't wait till they all go bankrupt.
This is awesome content!
I find it so hard to believe they’re not profitable yet.
I have yet to have a delivery person, on Door Dash, Grub Hub, Uber Eats, or Post Mates, who delivered my food, be the person in the app. The photos never match, and not just by sex/gender, but by race/ethnicity, by age, and by vehicle.
Tipping has gotten out of control in the US and should just be banned outright.
I literally worked for doordash in the pandemic. Got sick and unassigned several orders cause i didnt feel well. Kept trying sonce I needed the money but eventually went in and found out i got covid. Got quarantined and called support to advise i could not dash till i was out. I scheduled dashes to get my acceptance rate from 77% to above 80% sincenit had dropped due to the cancelled orders. I got deactivated around noon the first day i  could leave. I had a dash scheduled that evening at 5 after my ft job. Called support and they apologized but said it was automated. They knew and said i was good then deactivated me anyway. Every appeal has been denied and i still have the doctor's note putting me in quarantine. The gig apps dont carr
Why can't we just say that Capitalism is destroying us!
WAS THAT ERIC????? @commentiquette????,,,
I'm too cheap to use a delivery app.  I'll just make my own food, or go get it myself...
... and he didn't even address the scam that a lot of delivery companies are screwing their employees with - tips.  Many of these companies actually take a portion of the driver's tips, if you tip via the app.    Typically 30-50%.  That is why I tip my delivery drivers with cash   They don't even have to report it to the govt (technically they're supposed to, but....)   I try to give at least $5 or 15% (whichever is greater).
Thank you so much for talking about Prop 22 in California. I was so disappointed it passed but i knew the only reason it did was because of all of the millions they did to trick people into thinking it "protected" workers, which is obviously doesn't. So ridiculous
The dude who took the cake knew the payout and distance beforehand. Don't feel bad for him.
Skype was already killed off by Microsoft in favour of Teams before the pandemic. No-one was using it anymore. The real big loser was Webex.
I am autistic. Like on disability for being autistic. The ability to order things and have the option not to interact with someone is so important for me. But I’ll boycott if they don’t change.
On another point, these false advertisers. Dominoes for instance has this $19.99 deal. After purchasing the final total was $2819. WTF?
The writers definitely dash
These companies are just holding out for robots to do all the work for them, getting rid of the people aspect of it, and trying to find their profits that way.
Surprised they didn't bring up surge pricing practices.
Check to make sure you are not tipping people. Tipping culture must end.
"Bottom friendly menu" is disgusting.
Good episode, but yeah-no. I'm never tipping. I choose to also minimize eating out because of this. It is not MY responsibility, as the CUSTOMER, to ensure payments for these workers. I am very much on board with, "Everyone should he helping each other out." but I'm not going to let corporations force us at the bottom to fight and take care each other when they could be taking care of us with all the money they make. Down with tipping.
"What if the little man wanted to become a capitalist in 3 steps instead of 10?!"
Grubhub was far from alone in claiming restaurants were unusually closed when they definitely weren't. There was a mom & pop Mexican joint near me that I went to for years and they had never broken their schedule once; one day I was starving and lazy so I looked them up on Doordash and it said they were closed. Which seemed weird so I instead looked up their phone number and called and they were shocked to hear Doordash saying they were closed let alone listing them because they didn't have a contract with them.
While I agree with the general practice of tipping when it is necessary, and while I think it is the ethical thing to do (in the cases that warrant it), I still don't agree with any burden being placed on the consumer to make up for the results of a terrible system that needs to be completely changed.  I drove for 5 different food delivery services for over 6 years, even doing 2 simultaneously at one point for years.  In the end, it just doesn't really matter how well people tip.  Driving your own personal vehicle as an independent contractor for these terrible companies is a losing game, especially if you rely on it as your sole income.  It's not the customer's responsibility to ensure I earn a decent wage.  That should be the responsibility of the employer, and furthermore it should be the responsibility of the government to enforce proper, ethical business practices, but those things don't happen, and you tipping an extra few dollars isn't going to solve that.
I ran a freelance delivery service from 2012-2014ish, in an elderly community.... The restaurants charged SEPARATELY from me & we both usually made tips, too.   Fast forward 10 years & a restaurant, I worked for, had nearly 70% of it's food made for delivery & our Togo workers' tips being "stolen" by the delivery apps &/or this giant chain restaurant, with a red pepper for a logo. 😐
I did doordash once to see what it was about. Was a shit experience. Half of the orders got no tips or 1 dollar. 2 hours of being stressed when the restaurants took forever for the orders. Not worth the time at all whatsoever.
An orphanage for kids whose parents work 90 hours/week for DoorDash and don’t have time to parent! I DD’d since 2017, in New Mexico, South Carolina and NJ. NM was great 2020-2021, then payment structure changed and you had to work 40-50 hours/ week for $2-300. In SC, it’s horrible because people don’t tip.
Little disappointing that he didn't care to touch on some of the other issues delivery apps (and rideshare by similar nature of their apps) have caused vis a vis traffic/parking violations, stalking and harassment of customers by contractors using data gleaned from app/addresses, or how app companies refuse to reprimand or remove contractors who do serious harm.  One need only look at what frequently makes it to the front page of reddit from the DoorDash subforum to see the issues are causing outcry.  Good that he covered how predatory the companies are, at least.
Don’t tell me I have to tip
How did you possibly miss even mentioning that ordering through one of these apps is anywhere from 200% to 400% more expensive than going to the restaurant in person?  You spent so much time talking about things from the restaurant and delivery person's viewpoints, you completely ignored the fact that things are not all that great from the customer's perspective either.
Jim Cramer cheesing out over Postmates ignoring the cease and desist looks just like Dale Doback's dad in Step Brothers at the dinner table when Derek is telling all the stories about how cool he is  Edit: holy shit Doordash is owned by an asian teenager?!
He is the most plugged in of all the comedy hosts. Great writers, great researchers and timely subjects.
This model has never made sense to me.  Here's a fun exercise:  Look up the price of an item you want for pick-up in person.  Then order it through a delivery app.  Calculate the difference between the two.  Now, consider whether you would get in your car, drive to the vendor, pick up that item, and deliver it to some random place in your town -- for that amount of money. (note 1)  The answer is probably, "Nahh.."  OK.  What makes you think anyone else would, either?  Given that, how do you think this scales to all the people doing this in your city, and every other city where it exists?  Like I said:  This model has never made sense to me.  (NOTE 1: And that's assuming that 100% of the difference goes to you.  Which it doesn't.  But let's ignore that for now.)
Im glad this showed issues from all of the major delivery apps rather than pretending just one of them exists
No tip, no trip.
The USA is about making money and greed. Its sad
Tipping culture needs to change.  Pay the workers, don't make the customer pay your employees.
I used to deliver for DoorDash and UberEats. It fucking sucks.
I deliver for dominoes. Its decent work. I avg around 20 an hrs which isn't bad considering cost of living is decent here. I've delivered for 10 years so I have a system down but it can be very inconsistent. Gotta put back extra money from your good days to compensate for the bad ones.
So much sadder orders however delivering on bike wld be terrible
Greed is the cause of every last problem in this country & world.
I used to DoorDash and I could see if someone tipped or not and would not take that delivery because let’s be real very few people carry cash so I decided no food for you!
I drove for Postmates and the pay definitely wasn't great. These apps also favor those that want to work more by giving them more tasks. Those that want to work less will get less gigs. The algorithm is manipulative.
I'm worried waiting until Thursday is going to hurt the show. HBO made a terrible mistake and they need to set it back immediately.
Can we talk about the one guy in the audience clearly enjoying this episode way too much, I'm glad my guys enjoying the show.
I just don't get how normalized it got that you pay so much for delivered food. If the food costs $12 and I have to spend $20 + tip, I either go the restaurant (let's be honest, most restaurants are in a maximum circle of 5, max 10km) or just cook normally lol kudos to the stoned responsible people tho
I've been a delivery driver off and on for a decade. Now I run for the apps. The way both drivers and the customer get screwed is insane, especially considering that being a delivery driver is literally more dangerous than being a cop.
“More choices than Sophie! *Haven’t seen the movie” 😱😱🤣🤣🤣🤣
Proudly never ordered on an app. No shade to anyone who orders from necessity, but since I'm reasonably fit and aren't too pressed for time I prefer to personally acquaint myself with the restaurants that I love. Get to know my community.
that kind of mentality lead to our insane tipping culture. How about we force them to fix it instead of pushing the burden off on to the people. If we just tip more, they will continue to do this shit
I also have not seen that movie
All of this is a result of the CEO coming up with new and innovative ways to make money.   If you support capitalism. Don't complain when things like this happen 😂😂😂😂
A lot of these '10-era startups sound pretty similar when you get down to it.
Just to comment on a off the subject, subject...I Always thought that The Devil did do a better job than Johnny did.....lol.  Sorry Johnny 😅😅😅😂😂😂
This didnt mention the bad for the customers even.  The videos of people doing bad things to food if not pre tipped or high tipped. Or the 300% cost of food.  Kill tipping. Its NOT WORKING
The fact that they can’t afford to pay their workers a living wage, can’t even manage to make a profit themselves, but CAN spend $184 MILLION to fight a proposition in one state is insane and so emblematic of the times.
Only until the drones take over.
Sorry John but i have STRONG opinions about the devil went down to Georgia and the Devil’s fiddling was a little TOO dissonant which sounds fine when offset by the harmonic majors produced by his band but it was never a competition of bands, it’s a fiddling competition, remove the band and Johnny’s playing is far more complex and self sufficient,   TL;DR the devil is a better team player while Johnny is the better solo artist
Didnt even mention how some apps (looking at you Doordash) have us tipping BEFORE the service and that the default tip is calculated AFTER fees (not on the subtotal).
I just went on DoorDash just to give you a current example and found that a $16 burger and fries asks for $10 in fees + tip; can you tell me again how does this work in favor of consumers? All those issues are absolutely valid, but customers are also losing in this too.
All this is true.
I remember years ago using Eat24 (which later got bought out by Grubhub) because occasionally I'd get a $2 off coupon for take out. When I picked up from the restaurant, the owner said "hey next time please just call us directly, we'll give you the $2 off" which told me even then they'd still make more money doing that than going through apps!
In doordash, I have learned to first check the restaurant's website for prices.  An extreme example is cheddar's pot pie which is 12.99 on the menu, but on doordash has prices between 15.99-19.99.
Excellent vid, I've always avoided delivery apps 'cause I already felt like exploitation, and I see it even better now.  And these delivery company still being incapable of yielding a profit after all the mess and misery they create... Pathetic and hilarious, a glorious display of capitalism backfiring on itself
"this one feels familiar. oh right, i watched the 39min version."
This makes me feel so much worse for the delivery drivers that come to the trade school I work security at. The students are some of the shittiest people I've ever met. Most times they are not at the front gate when the driver arrives. So it's normal for a driver to have to wait 5 minutes for the student to DC show up. They've waited much longer than that. And our rules are that we can't hold onto the food for the student. Because if somethings wrong with the order, they'll blame us for it. We've tried for a long time now to try to get the students to arrive in time,  but they just don't care about the person delivering their food. Drivers have also told me that 9 out of 10 times, they don't get a tip from the students. Throw on top of that the fact that the students are often rude to the drivers after making them wait for a long time. They'll sometimes give them bad reviews for the order being wrong, which isn't their fault. I deal with a lot of anger door dash drivers every day.
I tip based on performance.. Sorry if your situation has you working for one of these companies, but if I have specific, clearly defined delivery instructions on my account ( I do) and you're rude to boot, I'm not tipping you. No one rewards me at my job if  I don't do it correctly and to make a general statement that we owe any industry that is insane.  As a rule, I tip well. But in recent years I've had so many issues with drivers flat ignoring my instructions, being insanely late and/or being rude when I do get my food , I stopped ordering delivery and went back to pick up when I do decide to order food. If I do order delivery, I choose the cash option, because I've pre-tipped too many times only to receive the terrible service I'm describing.  If you want good tips, do a good job.  Oliver's example of the injured guy and the single cake delivery are the exception. Most delivery situations are not that extreme and he conveniently never even mentions poor job performance. But poor job performance happens often and I feel zero remorse after the base cost of the food, taxes and service fees for refusing to pay extra for it.
I frickin' hated Postmates when I managed a restaurant. We didn't do take out. They added us to their website anyway--then claimed they couldn't remove us. Fack off.
As a delivery driver, just remember,  we know where you live. 😂😅😮
More choices than Sophie and I haven't seen the movie lol.
I will never look at VeggieTales in the same way again.
achieving a monopoly via losing revenue has got to be illegal
Jesus… for those of us that deliver… we are literally in the modern day Great Depression
aps ads with a large nationwide network can't make profit? Come on John we all know that's all a farce on the company end. clearly they use the food ap as a write off for their ad revenue.
I never made much money at uber eats doing this after i figured in depreciation on my car, gas, vehicle maintnence, against an hourly wage job. Its just not worth it. Plus its  1099 work. the town i live in is about 260,000 pop. And way spread out. U dont really walk anywhere here.
I think tony xu needs a bbc…
I get the whole "the companies should pay their employees so they don't have to rely on tips" thing as an argument, but that simply isn't the world we live in. These workers DO rely on tips, and if you’re participating in the system that is exploiting them, then you have to own your part in it. Your performative "this system is unfair so I won't tip" bullshit may make you feel all fuzzy and superior, but it doesn't put food on their table or clothe their children. If that doesn't bother you, then you're a piece of shit and we as a society need to move on from respecting you or validating your self-absorbed nonsense.
I've never used a food delivery app and I never will.
the compulsory utterance .......... here
I work at a restaurant in a small town with few Doordash drivers.... so the bulk of our Doordash orders are picking up their own food. And because they are paying a premium to order through the online service, they largely are not tipping. I implore people to just call us, as our time estimates will be more accurate and the food will be cheaper... but people are so obsessed with ordering things online that they will do it even when there is absolutely no benefit to themselves.  And speaking of time estimates, the apps are terrible at this. They claim to use fancy algorhythm math to add more time during high volume but this is completely a lie. If 15 online orders come in at the same time, they will all have the same wait time. And that doesn't even factor in the orders we get in the restaurant. We cook all of our food to order and typically add about 3 minutes per order. So if its Friday night and there are 20 tickets on the line, it quicky becomes an hour wait. And there is no way to get the apps to work with us on this. They still send drivers a message 15 minutes after the order came in that the food is ready. The result is angry drivers and angry customers.   And if the drivers reports to the app that the food is not ready... we get an angry call right in the middle of the rush, from a call center that probably usually handles credit collection asking us why our food isnt ready.... to which my stock reply is: fix your software!  These apps also have a terrible problem of not actually confirming that orders have been processed by the restaurant point of sale. So if the internet connection is spotty or if for whatever reason the POS is down... no ticket is printed and then we get a driver or customer showing up 20 minutes later wanting to know why they got a message saying "the food is ready" but there is no food. Because we never got the order. Or sometimes randomly the order will print out exactly at the time it was supposed to be ready instead of when it was placed. And dont even get me started on these apps reporting us closed when we are open or open when we are closed, randomly turning on menu items we have turned off, or that Doordash embeds itself into Google search results so that people think they are accessing our "website" when its actually Doordash, posting incredibly wrong wait times for food, and just generally misleading our customers about every aspect of our business. If I was the owner I would just turn them off. We had better sales, better tips, and happier customers before Doordash. I dont see the upside.
the rating system should have 2 separate fields. restaurant review and driver review. there are times where you order from a restaurant you know and love, but the driver is awful (drop off wrong order, leave order on the curb, flat out take your order, etc...)
Never once used a food delivery app, but thats cause im poor
With the increased prices on the app, additional fees, delivery fee, additional taxes, and delivery tip, you’re more often than not paying more than 2x what you would be paying in-store, but for food that’s not as fresh
Or, you could just charge the customer a fee that coincides with delivery time spent that is up front.  Nobody is required to tip then, nothing is up to chance via the delivery people, and delivery people get paid that fee.  Tipping causes a lot of needless anxiety.
Proud small restaurant owner over 10 years, I never fucked with these blood sucking bastards, never will. You want my food, you call my restaurant.
I called my local Pizza Hut thinking that they would just send one of their own drivers out to deliver my pizza.  They transferred the call to India or something.  A lady there put my order in on the website.  I could hear her kids playing and screaming in the background.  They then had Door Dash come and pick it up and deliver it to me.  So even when I tried to do it the old fashion way... they still had a food delivery place bring it to me.  What are you DOING Pizza Hut?!
I really don't get how these companies are operating at a loss. The fees and tip about double the cost of the meal for the consumer, and now I learn that they hit the restaurants just as hard. They don't pay benefits to their drivers, and most of their pay comes directly from tips. This entire industry seems like it should just be printing money.
What happens when they need a new transmission costing $3,000  ?
Even though they both really suck, I prefer no-tip orders over any order that would give me a thumbs down for a mistake.
STARTING AN ORPHANAGE??!!!!
we are living at a disgusting point in the capitalism era
Absolutely absurd that one bad review can utterly wreck a delivery worker's day but doing that to a big corporation is like spitting in a rainstorm.
People shouldn’t rely on tips, pay them a living wage! FFS!
The U.S. lost its democracy a long time ago, then im 1978 the Supreme Court legalized bribery (Lobbying) via campaign contributions...that's how we got Greed & Bonepurs.  "It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it." - George Carlin
as a Japanese restaurant manager during the pandemic, Doordash list our business without tell us. Every time Doordash get a order they will call in the restaurant. Because the complex nature of our menu, the person who called in haven't have any idea what they are ordering. We will get complain on order Doordash made to our store 1 out every 3 orders. When we try to explore the possibility to work with Doordash, they wanted 25% cut of the total sale.
I just ordered chipotle on DoorDash because this made me hungry
Everything is stupid and dumb
jim cramer looks AGGRESSIVELY happy in a way i didn’t think was possible
👍👍😎✌️🤟
This is the reason, why I do not order by app. They have a similar business model like park control businesses. Making money from exploitation…
Tipping should be banned for good
Stop putting the onus of fair pay on the customers. Tipping should not exist.
If all people refused to tip it would accelerate people quitting, which would put pressure on companies to pay more or actually hire delivery drivers.
Instacart doesn't even provide liability insurance coverage to drivers delivering groceries ordered via instacart. Uber and Lyft at least do.   The worst part is that if you don't notify your own insurance that you are using your personal vehicle for delivery services and get the proper coverage, your insurance will deny you coverage if you are involved in an accident whether your fault or not. Doesn't matter how injured you are.
As someone that has done Door Dash for the past two years with about 1000 orders, and applied for delivery driver to local pizza joints, it all sucks.  Pizza hut wanted to pay $9/hr when every other store in a 2mi radius is paying $11-$14/hr.  Door Dash pays a base of $2 an order with no regard for distance traveled, and most people don't tip.  Yet it's sad to see that more than 50% of my paycheck is from tips.  Now, that said, I'm of course on the side of abolishing tips for fairer wages, but kinda sucks when you're otherwise unemployed.  That's not even getting into how 90% of the orders you get have you leave your "zone" and can't get another order until you return.  Or how restaurants seem to prioritize delivery orders lowest.  Or how 15mi drives, in a major city, each way happens way too often.  Or how there's no control for bad neighborhoods.  Or how not taking an order penalizes you and even after you take that penalty to decline an order, they'll bundle it with another shitty order so you can be penalized again.  I'm just so glad I have a job again.
I'm like Miss Piggy when I'm hitting that green 🤣  BARS! 🔥
I was intending to post that I've never used a food delivery app but then I remembered a new sinister issue with these apps.  My Youngest is attending university and on occasion, I meet her for lunch at the Student Union center.  There, they have a mall-like food court with several fast food restaurants.  However, the issue that links to this video is you cannot directly order from the restaurants--you have to place you order either by phone or at a touch screen menu in the food court.  And who owns that hardware?  Grubhub.  And yes, the food is more expensive than other local restaurants.  Oh, and of course, the students can easily pay for their meals through their mandatory meal plan everyone has to have, even students that live off campus.
That piece of cake must of been expensive because most restaurants require a minimum dollar amount for delivery I believe.
The scary part is that I could totally see that orphanage scenario playing out... or at least a techbro trying it.
Watching this while doing my Doordashing shifts. 💀💀
you failed to touch on the 3 most prominant issues experienced by people whom actually work in the food industry.  1- drivers being illiterate or just cant be bothered to pay the fuck attention. 2- drivers whom pick up the orders but actually steal the order for themselves resulting in us having to repeatedly make the same order until a driver that is not a piece of shit shows up, which can take hours and sometimes go through a dozen different remakes before that happens.  3- then when an order doesnt show up on our end these companies call us and attempt to get us to make the order anyway without paying us to which I am always happy to tell them to go fuck themselves.
Restaurants in my area jack up their prices on the apps so much that they make the same or more as they would if you came in & got the food yourself.
Three years ago I broke my elbow. My employer at the time (Starbucks) wouldn't let me work, and unemployment/disability wouldn't give me money, so I ended up doing deliveries in a sling
I've always thought the devil should have won as well.
Personally the cost of delivery is too high for me as it is and the food always comes either cold, or soggy from steam because the delivery driver needed to minimize their trip and pick up multiple things along the way. I just place orders for pick up on the restaurant website itself and go get it. I end up getting it a lot faster, I support the restaurant, and I pay a lot less. I get that the goal is to never leave the house, but to me it’s worth it.
man, john really ruins everything
I'm not tipping just because an employer won't pay a proper wage.  All that does is reward terrible employment practices.  These companies should fail, tipping only props them up.
GrubHub (thuisbezorgd) in the Netherlands pays their employees by the hour. I'm surprised that their counterparts across the Atlantic don't!
My daughter and I were talking about ordering food tonight and we will go with a local family-owned restaurant that delivers with their own employee drivers. That is always our first choice, although some places only deliver via a delivery app. I make sure I provide a generous tip (20%, or more if there is something extraordinary in the service) as I have worked in jobs that pay the tipped wage minimum. It is just being a decent human being to pay workers for their labor.
Your tipping culture is whats wrong with the system. How about companies give wages that you can live on instead of people relying on customer handouts..
it s getting to the point where people who don't watch this show every week and give it their full attention should be retired from Congress if they are members  or  be crossed off of voting roles if they are registered
Aspiring DoorDash driver here.... Can anyone answer this ? How much do you make delivering food ?
Skype skyped up because they  got in bed with the FBI to spy on everyone using it......
Yay me. I get to watch the ep premier on YouTube TWO WHOLE TIMES 😊
Who’s making half their money from the $2 door dash payment?
Imagine being British and advocating for continuing the disgusting tipping culture in the USA, via a very misleading video. Fuck tipping, why not literally ask the delivery companies to pay a better wage?
It's a surprise to me that the non-existant labour-laws of the US can be even made worse. Promoting tipping to offset this shitty system is part of the problem. I get why, but it is not fixing anything.
The follow-up to The Devil Went Down to Georgia of Happy Easter, by the way… ☠️
Watching this while eating chinese food delivered by uber eats... 😅
I do delivery driving for a living and  I can honestly say tips make up about 75% of my income.
it boils my blood that prop 22 passed here, there are so many stupid, callous, uncurious people who just went "HUH??? MY MCDONAL DELIVERY PRICE GO UP MAYBE?????"
It never adds up. Ever.
Sophie’s choice was a red state health class staple
I'm a big fan but I don't know about this one.   I mean the labor issues I get and agree with, but the restaurant issues are not up to par with the usual malfeasance, unfairness, and upcoming catastrophes that you usually cover.  .  Why don't nearby restaurants just form their own in-house delivery networks where 2 or more restaurants share a delivery person?  Especially for privately owned local restaurants the owners are usually in touch with their customers enough to get the word out.  I mean, I don't ever even consider going through a Grubdash thing if I'm ordering delivery from my local pizza place, Catania's Pizzeria. Which on a side note is Yonkers, NY's very best pizza place and on par with the best pizza places in NYC. They've reached a level of excellence in pizza on par with Lombardi's where whether they're the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd best in the state is just a matter of personal preference.   Back to my original subject, if restaurant owners without debilitating egos would just get together and not only split delivery people but let their patrons know what they're doing and why I do believe they can take the market back from shitty delivery app.  Or one altruistic celeb could start a non-profit delivery app  solely to help workers amd save restaurants. If you need  someone to oversee the project I'm local, in between careers, and have plenty of non-profit organizing experience.   Also yes, I made this message this long hoping it would stand out.   I mean how often do you (you you not me you) get a chance to actually solve a problem from your show?
This show should be called "Everything Is Terrible, Please Clap"
You can't even spell millenial without three massive L's 😂
If restaurants had a better option to deliver they wouldn't use apps. If drivers could get better side gigs they would. If consumers had a better way to get delivery they would use it.
I just don't understand how there are so many multi billion dollar companies in the gig industry operating at 20 to 50% loss on revenue year over year over year that still get huuuge cash injections from the market. Sure, when they started entering the market it was reasonable for investors to believe they're in a Winner Takes All market, and that these companies should be able to turn a huge profit when they cornered the market. But let's be honest, this premise did not turn true and will not in the future - the companies imo already reached maturity or are near to it. I think it's a big bubble that's about to blast
You are absolutely fantastic thank you very much you made my day
I stopped using food delivery apps last year for two main reasons. The amount of added fees each service tacks on and the ridiculous expectation to tip BEFORE my order was delivered regardless of the quality and timeliness of the delivery. These services were a necessary evil during the pandemic. Now their just evil and I'm out
Johnny played music the devil played noise. The backing band for the devil is a analogy for class. The devil doesnt start playing the fiddle for a good while but sounds great due to the band. Happy easter
23:20 it’s sad that for these companies it’s more profitable to spend 184 million dollars fighting against worker safety than it is making the workers safe
I’ve always preferred the devil part. 🎻 😈
i just threw up a little bit..........
Trigger warning you made a phone call lol
17:16 driving through a blizzard is the best actually. Tips are the best
As somebody who was a gig worker as a means of income during engineering school.... ALWAYS RATE 5 STARS! Even a 3 or 4 star rating can REALLY hurt the rating of a driver. If you think I am rude because I don't talk much while driving you around at night during a massive rain storm..... 5 stars, got there safe.
When you hear the sad piano, you know someone is trying to fuck you dry.
Please do a video of Ride Share and their mafia tactics
Slavery was never abolished in the USA.
Too late, LWT; I already saw the full video that you accidentally listed for 20 minutes half a week ago
It's wrong to expect consumers to solve problems created by greedy billion dollar corporations.
Can the food delivery apps be sued for listing restaurants without a contract in place?
Speculation market is part of what’s ruining capitalism.
Uber and lift all over again, companies that grew to billions of dollars off the back of the working poor. Capitalism you'd say, I'd say so. How far can capitalism go? As far as a government would let it. But wait, billionaires control the government!!?  Well, good luck then!
One big thing he missed out on in my opinion is the predatory pay that these companies pay the people delivering food. Doordash for example, as a company will pay you as low as $2.00 an order to deliver the order, no matter how long it will take or how far it will take you. If someone does not tip, you are making $2.00 to deliver their food.
where the hell did that take out delevery option happen in 2003. I had dominos, papa johns, and pizza hut. that was it.
as someone who works in food service, the rudest people who come in are drivers for these delivery apps.
I have never and will never use one of these apps.
I have watched every video you’ve put out. It is what keeps me saying while working at a desk job where I am the only one in the room. As this sounds, you are the voice of sanity in my daily life. You need to put out more videos or so help me I will lose what little sanity I have .  Thank you and have a wonderful day !
I hope and wish that every single signalling statement in the comments is backed with solid actions. Washing your hands of a matter does not prevent you from being a participant.
It is insane that these apps don't make profit when they charge you SO much in fees, I will literally pay $25+ for a single meal for one person. Like where is the money going?? I know where it is going but damn that's crazy
I'm sorry, but did he say a leech has 32 brains?
Un-checked capitalism. In the words of John Cougar Mellencamp "ain't that america"
On the bad reviews bit: If you must review poorly, do it somewhere else. Review on Google if you must but do it where delivery works are out of the line of fire
We need to stop all this bullshit with "side hustles" and "part-time first jobs." It should be legally mandated that any work, that anyone is doing, should be considered their primary source of income, unless otherwise agreed upon. I don't know why it's okay for corporations to just assume we have other streams of income when it comes to pay. Even if it did, it still doesn't make it moral in any way. It's just a huge red herring.
So these companies paid more than 100,000 dollars just to pass a law in a single state, hired almost the entire Freinds cast for an ad? Well that explains why they are not making any profit.
The whole system is fucked, the apps force delivery workers to drive and cycle around our cities like reckless maniacs. Delivery drivers are always illegally parked in bike lanes and places where they shouldn't be, personally one caused injury to me because they were illegally parked in a bike lane.
I was really hoping he was gunna bust out a single piece of cake at the end.
I don't rate 5 stars much.  Have some standards people. Rating is done on a scale. Not just 5 or 0.
Thank you this segment. I have never downloaded any of those apps however I understand the demand/need for some people. While each element covered is a necessary truth that must be shared on a large platform, I especially appreciate you calling people out for ordering during unsafe conditions.
Man, wasn't there one of these food delivery thingies that would actually CAP how much you could give in a tip?  Like, it'd straight-up say "Hey!  You're paying them too much, we can't let you go thru with this transaction til you reign in your generosity, MR. ROCKEFELLER!"  If that on its own doesn't tell you where their priorities lie, then I don't know what WILL, because MY GOD.
You mean the restaurants that pay their staff minimum wage then bully patrons to tip that makes the actual wage of the staff, then manages to convince the staff that it's not the restaurant owners not paying them but that the customers who don't give tips are the mean people. That's the leeches. Same thing as the Taxi gang crying when ride hailing apps came. It just reminds me of that bar scene in Knockaround Guys when Vin Diesel goes to a small town bar and the local tough guy gets to know a tougher guy.
This was so good. Made me feel guilty for how often I use DoorDash now though.  😬
Fuck food delivery apps.  Replacing good jobs with shit gig worker that are not even employees. The more people suppourt these apps the more they support the destruction of worker rights and the working class.  Its trash. Its lazy people. So many people door dashing a 3 liter of soda and a bag of oreos a 1/8th a mile.
I've never used a delivery app, used Uber/Lyft or rented an Airbnb.  Because I almost exclusively use cash.  I have a debit card but I'm not putting that info into a half dozen apps.  And so many of these services are also *horrible* for a variety of reasons.  It's wild to me how lazy my friends and family have become with grocery shopping. They'll arrange their whole day around when they can get a pickup time instead of just walking into the damn store or pay way more to have it delivered.  Like dude, you live 5 minutes away from the store!
Thank you for giving me a good reason to delete those apps. Done
You don't "gotta fucking tip". This assumption hurts all service workers.
Yeah i understand  trust i do but not every place has delivery ppl or even delivery as an option...js
That bottom friendly add was amazing - spoiler alert, some of us have sex with out butt. So it was refreshing to see that.
The new veggie tales deserves a spot on adult swim. And nickelodeon.
GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS!
according to Google, there are over 7 million drivers worldwide for Uber and Lyft.  Heres an idea-for 2 weeks, all drivers refuse to take any jobs. Uber and Lyft will freak out and IMMEDIATE changes will be required for them to stay in business.   Without drivers,  the rideshare service industry ceases to exist and they should use that to their advantage.  They are independent contractors, not employees
I eat out, get a take-away or make food myself.  Tipping culture in the US is stupid.
The higher the fees the lower the tip.
That pride delivery App Comercial is so cringe. I rather be called a slur smh.
I disagree with the ending solutions on this one. I'm not gonna tip more and the companies should be paying them not me. I don't care if the billion dollar company is making no money.
17:32 food app drivers and on the job injuries. It's amazing how much these companies fight government workers compensation agencies. These things exist to cover work place injuries and in some states it doesn't matter if they are contractors or not but the big corps in charge of these fight tooth and nail to prevent coverage including legislation that clarifies coverage of their delivery drivers go California for getting regular Uber drivers covered keep going to cover food drivers.
L take on The Devil Went Down to Georgia. The Devil's solo is literally just him gliding two fingers down the neck of the fiddle while going back and forth with the bow fast. You could pull a guy off the street, hand him a fiddle, and teach him the Devil's solo in like ten minutes. Johnny's part shows off so much more talent and musical knowledge. Finally, even the Devil knew that he'd been beat so I don't see how there's an argument as to who won.
Skipped over a huge part. "Costumer is benefiting" is 95% false. The reason the customers benefit, is from the constant 60% off deals, and that's where the profit is going, and why the companies aren't "profitable yet". I wish he tied that together better, because the way he did it is misleading.
Can you please go back to adding new videos Monday mornings?  It makes our shitty work week a little bit better.  Thanks.
Big Food Apps: "We are barely making a profit!" Also Big Food Apps: "Here is $184 million so that we don't have to give our employees health insurance."
I founded one of the first food delivery businesses in 1993 before phone aps and I had to print menus and mail them.   Re the 20-30% we would take 30%.   This was plenty and we were profitable.   That is net.  We had huge costs in printing and mailing menus.   We charged the same price as in store prices and only a $3.00 delivery.   The restaurants we partnered with loved our service.  It’s sad to see what has happened to the wonderful business I helped develop Edit:   I will add that I also paid my “waiters” as independent contractors because I had no choice.  I couldn’t get driver insurance.   At the time there had been a huge settlement with a family who lost a loved one in an accident with a pizza delivery driver.  The insurance companies pulled out of insuring food delivery.   I would guess that these larger companies could get insurance now and pay as employees.   Just wanted to provide some background on my experience.   Btw my business was in Silicon Valley
As usual with Mr. Oliver, this is a good and informative segment. I don't use apps but understand those who do. Order pickup is easy enough. Not mentioned is alcoholics being able to have booze delivered after some minor setup procedure.  I learned this from a friend shortly before he died of alcoholism. He could get to the liver draining facility once a week, but didn't want to risk driving to pick up a fifth when on a bender.  I guess it's better than the old days when someone had to drink listerine, after shave, or cleaning fluid (a 35-year old girl I know went blind from drinking cleaning fluid.. eventually she quit booze).
Grub hub must have taken Yelp's biz model.
It is amazing that even in a video dedicated to showing how unsustainable a business model is, tip culture is still reaffirmed 19:15... No John, you shouldn't have to tip, if you do, it is (big surprise), because the business model is unsustainable.
Sometimes customers end up getting fleeced as well. I once ordered a double-winger order of buffalo wings from Famous Daves. The menu price is 18.99. By the time I reached the checkout section of the order, I had ended up spending $60 altogether, thanks to the additional hidden fees. I've noticed that this is consistent across the board, where I end up spending anywhere before 2 to 3 times the original bill, which 90% of that going to the app company itself.
Fun fact about the Fiddle Duel in Devil Went Down to Georgia. The Devil is playing in a way that sounds good but is a simple way of playing the fiddle. Johnny then not only plays through a variety of complex folk songs but melds them and iterates on them.   Its Johnny saying to the Devil 'I have enough technical skill with this fiddle to beat you around the bush with any melody.' Equivalent to when Beethoven took the discarded sheet music of his opponent, played it and proceeding to riff on it for forty minutes. Now, if the Devil challenged Johnny to a music contest, maybe the Demon Backup Band would have mattered, but he didn't now did he Mr. Oliver :)
Wait, so straight acting roles should only be played by straight actors? That doesn't seem right
As a millennial I could totally see myself in the scenario John described….😂😂😂
Wait didn’t this aired on Sunday or I’m tripping
I can't believe people are discussing not tipping here as a solution to the problem. If you can't tip you can't afford the service, period, end of thought. Should the system work that way? Of course not. Does it currently? Abolsoultely.    If you want it to end then demand a top down change and refuse to use the service until that happens. That is a perfectly responsible position. But using the service while not tipping is not doing anything to change the system. Its not the awesome protest you think it is.  The correct tip for delivery apps varies slightly based on state, but if you can't do at least $1 per mile between you and the store you ordered from, you can't afford the service. To equate it into terms of waitstaff tips, $1 per mile =10% tip, $1.50 per mile =15% tip, and $2 per mile =20% tip.
I have been delivering for 2 years straight ,3000 deliveries ,100% satisfaction rating.  And im doing this on a motorcycle.   I will admit,ive run red lights, gone down the wrong way, run lights ,just so i can get good orders and keep a good review.
I drove for Uber from the very beginning and rarely received any tips, and the option didn't even exist. The idea was supposed to be a cashless/tipless system, and the pay was good enough for a gig economy job without having to hustle the customers for tips. However, somewhere along the way, or it was always in their plan, Uber got greedy and decided to cut drivers' pay and significantly hike the cost for customers, while also expecting customers to chip in for the drivers' pay.  Furthermore, it's a supply vs. demand market, and a lot of people suddenly want to become "service industry" workers at their convenience, considering that almost every household has cars. Well, guess what? You shot yourselves in the foot because Uber has the leverage to set whatever pay they want as long as drivers keep piling in. It could be $1 plus tip tomorrow, and some people will still drive (and complain) while expecting users to make up the difference.  The users already pay a 30% marked-up price and an 18% service charge, while restaurants pay almost a third to Uber for every order. Many drivers seriously need to find other jobs so that the remaining ones can have the leverage to get better pay. And don't compare this to pizza delivery; pizzas don't get marked up by 30% + 18% service charge when they arrive at your door. Additionally, I don't believe many people tip on top of the automatically charged 18% tip at a restaurant.  And don't tell me that Uber losing money justifies their actions. They also shot themselves in the foot with foolish, greedy, and questionable business tactics. The pursuit of global domination is an ongoing battle, and they will continue to incur losses in that regard. Instead, they should concentrate on a few areas and foster a loyal customer base by prioritizing the well-being of their drivers through fair compensation.
Whatever your food costs, add 1/3 to the price and you get the final price.
Yes Oliver. werent u on that list ? or some future list?
Grub hub will make sure your still in business as long as they get their vig
I'm fascinated by how this does not work for the companies in the US. In my country there are many drivers on bikes, e-scooters, motorbikes and cars. The delivery guy can choose which order he would accept and deliver. The driver has fixed payment per ride regardless of the value of the food. If the distance is longer than standard, the price of delivery rises. The food in the app is usually 1 / 1,5€ more expensive than in the restaurant. So the app has a piece of the final price, the driver has the set part of the final price and the restaurant has the original price.    Just how can you take more than half of the price of the food from the restaurant, not guarantee anything to the drivers AND keep loosing money at the same time??
I really dislike this take-- the food is way too expensive on these apps already, and the tipping culture in the US is already asinine. Your recommendation is to keep using them, but just tip MORE? Nope.
If those companies were not making any money than how did the collectively spend over 100million on that law? There's some Fuckery afoot Jon
1:47 I have been that guy😂 I only get fast food though and not any small owned businesses cause I've known how shady these companies can be with them.
The SHAMEFUL look the college guy gave me as he handed my excited 6 year old a bag where he had smashed a soup through the lid of the other. I assumed my $6 tip was offensive. The soup was $15 and it was a mile away. 🤷 I gave him 5 stars anyway, I guess I just CANT tip enough for the service..
America should try Open Network for Digital Commerce
Is this recorded with a live audience? the laugh tracks have always seemed fake. still love the content, but i prefer no laughs over fake laughs.
i would not work for these gig works crap and sure in the hell will not use its app to get it  wish more people would as well
Here in austria the apps even take a cut of the tips. So I usually just tip the drivers in cash directly at my door.
No, I call BS on "you're getting money back" by using a failing service. No. If we still had the old system of restaurants employing delivery drivers, the cost would be even lower and both the restaurant and the driver make money. We can go back. Isn't it just OK to say that this experiment failed?
If I'm already paying, I'm not tipping. That's between you, your corporation, and how much you both think you're worth. Tipping is wrong.
I don't feel like the winner of this deal.  I'd be much happier paying a more consistent amount to a restaurant that was able to take personal responsibility for their own delivery drivers.  With the app reducing driver fees, the quality of the drivers has very noticeably declined.  I got absolutely yelled at by the last delivery driver because I was trying to tell him where the front door was and he wouldn't believe me because some other resident had tried to get him to deliver to a resident access point on the other side of the building once.  It was two separate phone calls of pure indignance and I couldn't even figure out where he was to meet him at whatever door he was trying to wait at, before he finally came around and I got to hear him yell at me in person.  I stopped ordering at that point.  It shook me up too much.  I've had my food stolen once.  I get my food delivered downstairs but without any notification, so it ends up sitting on a random lobby table because they didn't bother to let me know.  I feel about the idea of waiting to pay tip in cash, because it's going to show up as zero tip on the order and I worry the service will get even worse, but the idea that that last guy got a decent tip for literally yelling at me still bothers me.
The worst with delivery drivers is they take no responsibility for leaving items at the restaurant. Like it should be easy to see a drink is included.
"You have to tip." No we fucking don't. Tipping will forever be optional.  I am not going to tip someone for simply doing their job.
So lets make things more expensive for me because people without skills or documents need to make more? I  will vote for anything that keeps my costs down. Those workers need to get a skill or get their papers. And I must give bad service a tip and good rating. My conscience is clear, I didn't make these people take these jobs.
To be fair, algorithm will not demand BJ for not firing you...
Didn't see that twist coming, where I'm the idiot for not using any of these silly apps.
BikingDC! Love that guy
And that's why i always order directly from the restaurants. Although, i live in europe and these things are different round here. The US is just fu***d up.
Even during the height of the pandemic, I never used delivery apps. I really only get delivery sometimes if it's Pizza, and even then, I definitely prefer it if the pizza place does their own deliveries. The rest, I go out and pick it up myself if I order food from home.  Maybe it helps that I don't drink or smoke pot, but still, I go get the food myself.
Who else already watched this on Sunday when they accidentally uploaded the full episode?
But at least Obama didnt watch as wayward barges shut down already over extended ports of Ostia, and bridges collapsing and Easter remade as Torch song trilogy day, but then as I have said, with an answer key Mr. Dithers Biden has paid to get, the brethren loved me cause they loved the Romans and hated the femmy. But the MSS was in middling shape and only a bot a hundred pages were left, as I had excised the parallel narrative of Etruscan MYTHOLOGIES, AND a set piece bella Italia, as that was far too romantic for the The Don is Dead, and the signet n the Brotherhood Coppola CRAP THEY WERE SURE WAS HERE. All I know is that a hatred of Harry Potter got me thrown off a Zoetrope site, and after all, 30, 000 people weren't just slaughtered over Apollo falling for a girl turned into a bundle of weeds.  Trump wasn't the one who made sure that Oliver North was not put under oath, and like I said, I remember what was said by Molly Ivins the night to Tom Snyder that this corpse voted against health care. Even the title, ROMAN MYTHOLOGY so off put some hard boiled eggs crime imprint, actually upset like some middlebrows are that they actually got such a query, as look I suppose for the next  I, THE JURY, OR WORSE,  it was turned down in 11 minuets, showing again, how full of shit your awakening really, at heart is. Next time you gasbags sell your souls to War inc, Don't do it for Mr. HYDE, OR SOMEONE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HASTA TAP DANCE NOW, Moms, we all recall when your Sallys stage whispered and called him an Fiing War Monger ..ALAS, Not in those hallways. AS ISN'T IT FUNNY, OR AS AN MIDDLE BROW WOULD SAY ironic, that once a corpse used by GE theater would get in anyway he could, Gore called him a never was when I was a kid, that the Portland empire,  would have exploded into a kind of warfare unseen ever, with aids workers and red crescents targeted and set ablaze, as they've only found 36 skeletons at Masada, but then I have  a feeling we all know now what that peerage rule is. Well, no matter what you steal, or what happens or doesn't, it was said of Biddy. That if the democrats ever lost their minds and put in this funeral cantor for Dixiecrats and those who filibustered the voting rights act, made him the nominee if that outhosue party, even the thought of his Preatorship was unfathomable then, That it was said of him, don't do it, as hell never forgive you for it. That was said in the wings in a debate night by...Bill Clinton. I know it sounds like Plautus, but what about him ever vasn't...?  All I know is that Joe Scarborough isn't my friend.     http://antoniusradiocomix.blogspot.com/2024/04/nothing-for-anyone-tragedy-tonight8.html
In "the devil went down to georgia", Johny is definitely the better fiddle player. Johny's part is technically far more impressive, making him better at playing the fiddle. The devils song can however be considered more appealing to many listeners despite not being that technicall, which makes a lot of sense, because the devil is better at playing people, aka. the listener, than playing the fiddle itself.
I used a food delivery service once, with the outrages prices and the low quality food that arrived, I vowed to never use them again.   That was in 2017 and I’m still going strong.  You don’t need to use this service. Society existed without it before, and it still can.  Also, I work in the restaurant industry.
Seriously! Where's all this extra money coming from? One time, ONE TIME, is all it took to realize the horror show that is third party delivery.   You get food (hopefully) the order is correct (hopefully) and it's fresh (hopefully). You tip and then realize you paid out the ass for whatever you get.   If there's an issue with your order! WTF!  Why is anyone doing this?!   Dumbass people!
This is *ALOT* how America works. If the ‘Guy’ that’s supposed todo it, doesn’t do it well. You could (A) Jump in and help your co-worker, providing guidance and shedding any insecurities ‘both’ people had building and creating a new better work experience or (B) Don’t care, clock out and see what tomorrow looks like 🤨 *Edit* 10:25
My family doesn´t charge me 3x their cost for food. My mother/wife doesn´t need a tip. I do all of our cooking for 3x a day.
I worked in a restaurant for four years. These Apps (mostly Doordash in the area) were so bad we started asking all orders placed over the phone if it was a third party order and refusing all of them.
It’s a fiddle battle John, bringing a band should disqualify the Devil from the beginning
I deliver for doordash and Uber eats and they will frequently use virtual kitchens that are far away from the customer. For example, a virtual Starbucks that is 7 or 8 mi away from a customer when there are 10 other Starbucks within 2 miles of that same customer. Makes no sense
Companies this big don't "lose" money in the same sense that an actual person can lose money
I’ve become a dasher for DoorDash after having been on the brink of homelessness due to a dry job market around here. I make enough money to pay down my rent balance for the time being, but I know it’s not sustainable. Thank you for the PSA about star ratings. It affects when we can work.
I think I'll just make a sandwich.
I’m so glad I’m not too lazy to get my food. I never have and never will use those apps. Its insane as the stupid tip system everywhere you go
No, I don’t have to tip.
They always find a way to blame Millennials. My goodness. I don't really have access to these apps in my area, but the one place that I am in delivery range for has their own delivery drivers. I tip them extra if it's a little crappy out and won't order at all if it's really bad.
Tips should be a bonus on top of a living wage, not an integral part of a wage that has you barely scraping by. If you rely on tips to make ends meet, your labor is being exploited. It's really that simple.
This might sound a bit harsh, but tipping is a toxic societal standard, and it would be best for us all to collectively completely stop tipping, even if that would be a nightmare scenario for people who work in the food industry in the short run, so that in the long run, those jobs can be paid by their employers as they rightly should be.
I'm so happy I just avoid food delivery apps. It never made sense to pay almost double for one of the most inefficient ways to get food.
Get rid of this stupid tipping culture, and make the companies pay a living wage!
5* guarantees mean food reviews don't matter anymore/ shitty deliveries. High tipping? Standard used to be 15% now it's default 20% what counts as high 40%?  It's ridiculous that the consumer has to supplement for "shitty tipping practices". Just like inflation, if standard becomes 40% tip you better believe the wages are going to drop even more.
The very audible "WHAT?" during the terrible post mate bottom friendly ad was a sign we are in for a wild ride.
22:12 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂so true
The primary beneficiaries have not been the customers, it’s been the corporate criminals at the executive levels who engage in pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes, stock market manipulation schemes, and tax fraud schemes to defraud the global populace and governments of the nations in which these companies operate to the tune of billions in personal wealth.  There is zero difference between Sam Bankman-Fried and Tony Xu, Dara, Risher or any of the other gig app founders and executives. It’s the exact same game being played, and it’s these corporate criminals who benefit from the operation of these wildly illegal, immoral, and unsustainable businesses.
Why is every tech company CEO just a d-bag, money-hungry asshoIe?
I feel seen as a millennial especially about Harry Potter
2:06 "I'm like Miss Piggy the way I'm hittin' that green. Even now, I'm about as high as a giraffe's arsehole and as spaced out as a ninth grader's essay trying to meet the page limit." This is really high quality writing. Especially that last one. Respect. Now on with the program.
I remember fighting with GrubHub to remove the restaurant off their list. They were refusing to remove us, and it actually led to us making sure a customer was not someone from GH in disguise. If it was, we cancelled their order and sent them on their way. For us, it's a huge health and quality issue, not to mention they were cheating the delivery staff we had on (we paid a base above non tipped minimum).
They should talk about amazon driver and Walmart driver as well
I'm not sure if I'm sad that people are paying such ridiculous amounts of money to have overpriced food delivered to them or glad because hopefully they eventually run out of disposable income and prices can finally come back to reality because there aren't enough stupid and/or lazy people with money left to overpay anymore.
Bad reviews with no reason for it has cost me lost wages 😢
Ok, as someone who worked old school pizza delivery back in the 90s, the couple who thinks they need 15 delivery people is flat out wrong. I worked for e very popular local chain and we had 4 drivers on the weekends and we made a ton of cash. It's pretty easy to group orders by location and deliver 2-4 orders in one trip.  Then the manager got annoyed one day because a guy couldn't drive because he couldn't stop puking, and he hired 4 more drivers. So I went from making 250 bucks cash per night to being lucky to make that all weekend, and in a shocking twist of events, most of the drivers quit.
Wait a minute, those companies aren't making money, right? But their managers and their employees are! They are all bleeding the investors and banks' money.
I do door dash in Seattle part time And ever since they forced door dash to pay more I only receive one or 2 orders for 3 to 4 hours of wait time Door dash are pricks
Tips sounds weird to me, don't American companies pay for their workers be included in their price tag???
The owner of the plattform controlls the plattform. In the EU we call them gatekeepers now.
I used a delivery app ONCE, because I got a free delivery fee coupon, and the guy who delivered it looked so miserable, and I tried to give him a cash tip, and he looked so annoyed, like I gave him a piece of trash to throw away for me. AND my order was wrong. 🤦‍♂️ After that I was like, “screw this miserable experience” and so now I use iDash, where I pick it up myself. 😆
Sorry, but tipping has gotten way out of hand. If anything we should be tipping less or not at all and the companies should be paying their employees more.
I owned a bagel store during the pandemic and a couple years after, sold it last year. About a month after I bought the store I ended our relationship with grubhub and Uber eats for the exact reasons John describes in this. People complained, but it wasn't worth. Thank you John Oliver for this.
@13:18 for real though
Doordash takes 30% from my restaurant on all orders, I do about 40 orders a day.  I called about the lower commission rates and decided to go to 20%.  Well next day I got one order.  What a scam, so 30% or no orders for us I guess.  Had to pad prices to cover 1/3 commission. We are back to 30%.  They make more than me on some foods.
I wish i tip when even im struggling for every dollar. The company should pay.
Ok so one thing to note about the people thinking the delivery drivers "pretend to be regular customers"  It's called a job, they go into the restaurant to get a togo order like a regular customer. What always bothered me is that the restaurants blamed the drivers, pretending the drivers were being deceitful, but the reality is these drivers would be treated like shit if they explained they were a delivery driver. Blaming drivers for the way the company does business is the just shooting the messenger.
DoorDash is the worst. I worked for a restaurant that changed owners, but DoorDash made it nearly impossible for us to change the bank account they paid out to. We tried calling and emailing and doing it though the app but they made us jump through so many hoops, and kept sending the money to the old owners. So we just had to shut everything off with them and people were confused. They deserve a special place in hell for their interface being so inconvenient.
The fact that these companies would rather spend billions to not pay the delivery drivers rather than figure out how to actually make money speaks VOLUMES
That’s what Amazon does to vendors, takes about 50%-75% after all their fulfillment fees
To be the devils advocate, very rural places in the US never had taxis, but they now have Uber. It's the only means of pu0blic transport in places like this. However, it'd be phenomenal if they'd make their business practices better
In NYC doordash pays $30 an hour, why would people pay full tip anymore?
Ironic that Snoop plugging Grubhub is the advertisement leading into this video. 😅😂
I had no idea about what it costs the restaurants, nor what the drivers go through! And I don't see how these delivery apps can claim that they aren't making money! They set a $12 minimum per order, if you subscribe for "free" delivery and "reduced" service fees.. But then, they set the prices on everything on the menu to make it almost impossible to order anything for the $12 minimum.. For example, they will set many items at $11.99.. And nothing else on the menu set for less than at least $3 - 4, but most often $8 or more..   Then, even if you magage to find a lucky combination to make just around the $12 minimum, which sometimes means add-ons that you don't really want.. Between their fees, even with a "free" delivery subscription, and your tip.. You end up paying somewhere between 40% and even up to even 70% more than the price of the item! So it's rigged to cost you around $18 or more for a $12 order, no matter what.. And that's only if you are stingy on the tip.. And if you don't pay for a "free delivery" subscription, it costs astronomically more!   There are so few restaurants anymore that offer traditional delivery with their own drivers.. But even those few that do, now set their prices and minimums so high, that the most you can save on a direct order from the restaurant instead of using a delivery app, is maybe a dollar or two.. Which is probably their way of trying to make a little more profit to offset the exorbitant losses that they incur with the delivery services..   So these days, regarding using a delivery app versus ordering directly from the restaurant, it's basically 6 one way and half a dozen of the other!   For this reason, I am not completely feeling sorry for the restaurants either! They are free to refuse these delivery apps and go back to old way.. Keep a delivery driver on staff and take normal orders, without jacking up their own prices and delivery fees to be almost as bad as the delivery apps!   Bottom line, to order delivery these days is just plain highway robbery! I don't see how you can say that the customers are benefiting in any way..
Calling it “vape smoke” is like calling a rain cloud a “water smoke.” Or calling urine “dick shit”
8:07 and there taxing the delivery person wtf
This entire segment seems to forget that these services also exist in places were tipping is uncommon, or even completely non-existent.
That driver said that ppl who get drunk or high and use it because they aren't being responsible. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would think NOT driving and calling for your food to be the safest possible solution for all parties involved.
Listen to this man people, he speaks the truth.
Unfortunate to see such an L take on this show. Those companies are able to operate that way because they know they can rely on people to be guilted into tipping. Continuing this tipping circlejerk is like putting a small adhesive bandage on a dismembered limb. If at all practically possible, outright refuse to use those apps in the first place.
Tip off the books whenever you can. You shouldn't have to pay taxes on my charity.
Watching in real time as Karl Marx’s predictions of the commodification of human beings through capitalism come true is hilarious. We deserve what we get for creating and incentivizing profits before people. Thank you America!
21:00 - The same thing is happening now with streaming services. They're bundling up with others, including ads where there weren't any before,  jacking up prices, aaaaand you have cable now.  They've reinvented cable TV.
As always such an amazing piece no idea why us Brits can't see it without using a vpn but that's up to you guys  My issues that weren't fully addressed were as follows:  1) The shops/restaurants on the app inflate their prices by sometimes as much as 40/50% if not more to ensure their bottom line remains the same, even if its a little lower thats still cheaper than them hiring a driver or using a taxi for delivery plus there is the promotion aspect too 2) Following on from above the shops hardly ever if ever offer deals on the apps that are the same as what you can get going to them directly ie Buy 1 get 1 free options. Again another way the shops ensure they get maximum revenues 3) The delivery drivers for these apps ALL need to have full insurance cover for themselves and their vehicles, EXCEPT for bikes/electric bike riders they don't need to have anything. So profits for car drivers are lower as a result 4) Following on from point 3 the Electric bike riders get the same rate as normal bike riders even though they aren't peddling or putting in as much effort - yet Uber and others dont wonder how can these so-called bike riders deliver so quickly they can't figure that out? 5) Some car drivers have also started to "pretend" they are bike riders to get the higher rates, again Uber and others can't see how fast the bike deliveries are?  As you said better to go to the shops directly rather than via these delivery apps.
-> Working As A Food Delivery Rider: Are We Paid Enough? | Talking Point | Full Episode -> very useful insights into the Grab system and how it 'manages' drivers
I deliver a single slice of cake once. I was a delivery walker and it was only going to be three blocks than a couple floors to the door… a single slice of cake. It was sad, but my person tipped 100% that day. So can’t complain.
0:34 The moment I saw this ad is when I gave you a thumbs up.
I dont get how people tip with the app. Just give a bit of cash to the driver...
Fk tipping. USA get your act together and treat your food workers properly. God damn.
I think every knows this. What you SHOULD be talking about are all the bad actors buying dasher accounts and using them to harass people that pay to get food delivered to them
Perhaps I shall forego the femme fatale approach to taking control over the world. Hmmm, instead of my five lovely wives and I hosting a Premiere Event Program. You can gey me & John here; talking it up and laughing with you while the world hopes for better. We are guaranteed to share a laugh or two. Maybe, with sufficient luck; your online brain surgery 🌞🤪, wait what? John here, seemingly disapproves of my language. So, it'll ve me and John sort of lame ducking it while the world scrambles to Obey. But I don't want to do it that way. Its me and my wives whom have engaged in  this massive effort.  We would do a much better job than just me and John. Besides, John has good humours for everybody. Thats why he's here with us, in Toy Land.  But not me, had you forgot? You Would Be Commissioner has been a killer most of his life. Niw, I try to rule the world instead.
the sad thing is that race horses are dying at alarming rates due to doping, make that an episode very soon!
Tip cash at the door so the companies don’t take a cut of the tip (they do)
I would like more information on the horse.
Thank you!
How could they not turn a profit are they paying themselves 100 million a year 🤔
Advertisement is insanely patronizing
I am eating my lunch, Johnathon. Stop talking about leeches. 😆
I think the msging here is wrong. The onus is not on us as the service users. The companies pay hundreds of millions on marketing and sales teams doing shady practices and lobbyists and government officials to get their way to "not make a profit". Vs. Expecting them to invest in a better culture and pay delivery people better and have a cost + strategy instead of "free delivery" and taking commissions from restaurants as a profitability strategy  The whole business and market is set up wrong.
please make a video on India and electoral bonds..more people need to know abt it
The scripting on this episode was wilder than usual
Just go out and eat and buy your damn food at a place. Is not that hard. Delivery used to be a thing you did maybe once or twice a week, or even less
😂😂😂😂 evangelicals good one John #JOHNOLIVERFORPRESIDENT✌🏾🙏🏾🇺🇸🇵🇷😂
I love Papa John's pizza, but I don't order for delivery anymore since my local one  started using DoorDash .  About a year ago, I ordered a couple of pizzas, and after two hours of watching the DoorDash guy drive past my house multiple times, he finally pulled in my driveway with my pizzas.  At least he was honest; he gets paid more on other restaurant deliveries than he does for pizzas, so pizzas are a low priority delivery.
Plz give the tips as cash!!! These companies have been sued repeatedly for keeping tips from the worker 😡
Oh, that orphanage thing really got John going. Of course, he had at thing or two to say about that. What with him being a former inhabitant of a rather Dickensian orphanage back in his childhood days, LOL😂
Numbers being yelled at you with Human Squidward is my favorite show. I simply cannot get enough of it.
I work at a restaurant, and it's very disappointing to see how our online delivery orders skyrocket during extreme weather. Just yesterday, we had a severe tornado warning and yet delivery orders kept flooding in.  So you recognize that it's too dangerous for you to drive, but forget everyone else right? Your own comfort and cravings are more important I suppose.
What these delivery apps did during the pandemic was not "keeping restaurants alive", they screwed small restaurant owners by charging them more and even resorted to extortion and somehow it was "legal" in some states during that time.   They don't pay their drivers, they keep most of the tips you give (at least they used to) and they eat shit for breakfast... That last one might be false, but it's crazy that it COULD be true...
The more localized these services are the more useful they will be. Discounts and rewards for smaller businesses to help level the playing field 👍
Grubhub looks like exactly our "Lieferando" in our lovely Germany... We had that discussion like about 2 years ago... With no effort IMHO. And ja, I'm with you with that wallet grifting s*** - stay safe ♥️
My Basic Rule of Thumb: If the company you're about to do business with has a purely extractive business model (makes nothing, provides no actual service, only exists as a heretofore optional middle step, and charges a premium for that 'service'), then don't. Can I follow this 100% of the time? Well, not in todays world. But I stick pretty close to it.
Can we get an episode on Squatters??
Very recently DoorDash launched storefront. They’ve been marketing it to restaurants as a way to replace their internal online ordering platform with DoorDash.  When this launched, even restaurants that did not opt into it had the “order online” option when you search on google default to DoorDash storefront.  Customers had no idea they were ordering through DoorDash. During Christmas, my family’s restaurant is extremely busy with catering and preparing preordered Christmas dinners. So, we usually turn off online ordering and all delivery services during this time.  However, that apparently didn’t turn off storefront (which again, we never opted into, didn’t request, and didn’t want).  So, imagine our surprise when, in the middle of our busiest time of year, a customer came in saying she had ordered something online from our website (something we don’t actually allow to be ordered during this time of year because it’s available in a reach in case to customers and we don’t have the behind counter capacity to store it for every customer who wants it) and we can find no record of her order. She’s getting frustrated, insistently showing us a confirmation email we don’t recognize and that doesn’t say DoorDash.  Meanwhile, DoorDash doesn’t actually send you the order until a bit before the customer is scheduled to arrive, so we hadn’t even received the order from them yet.  We didn’t know about storefront or that it replaced our online ordering and allowed customers to order when we were listed on DoorDash as closed. It was really really frustrating.
There needs to be an option to 'rate restaurant' right next to 'rate delivery' because raising awareness of the difference isn't enough.
Yeah I used to have Doordash and Instacart and this year I finally axed. Its not worth it for me, it creates bad habits and its a shitty industry. I never thought id miss awkward late night phone calls with the guy at dominos but here we are
I've heard of a "sh!tload" of money, but not a "f*ckton"...  is that a Brit thing?   ;-P
Some days I don't even get paid for the deliveries I make because base pay is $2 and gas costs $5
I mean I get why you keep insisting that people need to tip - buuuuuut shouldnt companies just pay their workers a living wage instead of having the public subsidize it for them?
I’ll be honest and say I didn’t know how little the restaurants received. I won’t use the apps again unless they send 90% back to restaurants Edit: Apps and accounts deleted. Uber and Grubhub advised why.
These companies do make plenty of money.   It's just the profits go to a few at the top.  Same goes for most governmental bodies.
Wait, how are they not profitable?? I worked for doordash. Their base pay was $2.50 (when I started it was $3). We order doordash today, it's $20 in fees not including tip. So the payout for the driver (if the restaurant doesn't steal the tip from the dasher) COULD be $2.50-10 depending if the customer tips. Where do the rest of those fees go, if they're not that profitable??
I looked up that Postmates commercial. I currently regret looking up that Postmates commercial. Nothing to the rainbow mob, just wow.
This is exactly why (plus safety issues) that I won't use these apps. I love places that let me call in or order pick up so I can grab my lunch or dinner on my way home.
I'm so happy I live in Europe, where most of these shenanigans are outright illegal and.. imagine this, US comrades, somehow it works *without* them.
the devil is NOT a better fiddler that mother fucker had to use an entire backing band with an upright bass and drums to even get a *slight* edge over Johnny
The information given here is EXACTLY why I do NOT use ANY of these "services" - for ANYTHING. They're doing their BEST to sidestep labor laws and (practically) STEALING every dollar given them... believe that.
If you are in northern Colorado use noco nosh
Free market capitalism seems like it's working out really well, guys...
we cannot continue to allow companies to purchase each other. it's purely anti-competitive and only serves to consolidate money and power and create monopolies. waiting until they become bad enough and then hoping that the government breaks them up (which they hardly ever do) is not a viable solution.
21:21 I wouldn't even say the consumer is winning.  As someone who frequently orders delivery services as a convenient solution to working from home since covid, I almost always receive significantly worse quality food than if I order at the same restaurant in person, there are deliberately smaller portion sizes, mark up fees from both the delivery service and the restaurant, plus paying the Doordash subscription, in addition to my $7 - $10 tip range (for reference, $5 was my "fair" tipping range before 2010, back when pizza and chinese were among the few delivery options).  It is a lose/lose/lose every single time I order delivery. The restaurant staff are overworked and underpaid, the delivery services and food transporters struggle to profit from this model, and the consumer gets worse food for higher cost. I have no idea how this business model has made it this far.  Don't forget spite as a factor. I know with certainty from countless personal experiences, that certain staff making exponentially more food for stagnant, unsurvivable wages, are deliberately sabbotaging peoples' food, in some restaurants. There are numerous places I refuse to order from online, any longer, because of consistantly inedible quality food through delivery services. Literally no one is winning from this system.  Some argue this model is intended to evolve into an upper-middle+ class luxury, but why TF would even rich people want to pay exponentially more for crappier quality food in smaller portion sizes? As someone that frequently orders delivery, I will not even be upset with this system dying. Business models should be symbiotic. A business sees a need, offers a "reasonable" fee for a solution to that need, and customers that deem the cost justifiable will sustain such businesses. Nothing about the current system reflects such symbotic benefits.
I didn't know you couldn't tip. I always do 20% and leave 5 stars. But now I order from the restaurant. My first job I delivered for Domino's made an average of 100 a night.
As a consumer, I look at the "delivery fee" these apps charge (and explicitly state that this doesn't cover a tip) and think to myself, "yeah, I can drive myself to the restaurant." Combine that with the horror stories of drivers eating customers' food, worry about how long the food's going to be sitting around while the driver's making other deliveries, knowing they charge the restaurants exorbitant fees, etc. The last time I ordered delivery, I ordered from Pizza Hut directly, and it turned out they now sometimes subcontract delivery through DoorDash, and it was the worst delivery experience I've ever had. It took too long, pizza wasn't brought in one of those warming bags pizza places use so it was cold, and the pieces were tumbling around the box loose.
There's everything in this video *and* there's a thing called Ghost Kitchens. Basically they're Kitchens that *only* take online orders and often they'll list themselves multiple times under multiple restaurant names to get more orders by pretending to be local restaurants (Meaning actual local restuarants end up getting fewer customers). There's a lot of other stuff going on with Ghost Kitchens so I recommend that anyone who reads this comment looks into them more. There are some really good investigate pieces here on YouTube that go in depth on the various issues surrounding these kitchens.
I've never used a delivery service.  I look at the costs, account for how cold the food will be, and how long it will take, and just go get it myself.  If I couldn't drive, I'd cook at home, or keep my freezer stocked with frozen dinners.    I also hate the single serve containers these meals come in.  We're all talking about environmental damages, pollution, climate change, and green energy....then hire someone to drive around to restaurants picking up food, in disposable containers, to bring it to your doorstep.
How much should I tip my marijuana store? I normally just do 20% or so like I would in a restaurant. Does that seem logical?
hahahahahaha wtf i cant with the fruits and veggies
Johnny is a better and more technical fiddler. Being able to sample folk songs and prove he can play each one while adding his own jazz like spin to them is proof that he deserved to win. The devil had some flashy moves but basically just slid his fingers up  the strings. It's flashy but something any moderately talented fiddle player can do. Johnny is able to skip over strings and play 8th notes, something the devil does not do in his solo.
Here's an idea: stop ordering food and plan your life so you can prepare your own meals. F-ing 'muricans.
I'm done with these services.
As long as you're still tipping, you're paying what the company should be paying
The Devil had a better song, but Johnny was the better fiddler. The Devil even KNEW that he'd been beaten. *steps off soapbox*
Honestly the burden of healthcare probably shouldn’t be on the companies, especially small local businesses.  The amount of taxes we pay should cover at least the majority of the burden of healthcare…. Then you have tips as a substitute for hourly pay which is messed up.  Finally you have these companies paying ridiculous salaries for executives, ridiculous money going to lobbyists to avoid paying workers and taxes.
I never use these services because, aside from being aware of these issues, it’s also too expensive for a lot of “consumers”, including myself. The cost just isn’t worth it. Plus, with delivery (the exception typically being pizza), order errors are common but not much can be done about it without a huge hassle, and  the amount of food for the price seems different from what you get if you’re ordering in or picking up take-out in person (even if that does make sense for the restaurant’s profitability, it’s still a negative factor for customers). These are all some of the things that weren’t discussed in this episode. I understand it was more about looking at it from the P.O.V. of a worker, but I think it’s more accurate to say the only people who really benefit from the service are those customers who can afford to pay extra for the luxury, and that excludes a lot of people who could otherwise benefit from such a service due to, perhaps, disability and/or illness, or being too busy as a parent or someone working at home. It may be worth mentioning that the employees themselves are among those consumers who are probably unable to afford the service.
I'm pretty sure that their executives are being paid incredibly well.
The GrubHub guy who worked our neighborhood in 2020 made more money than at his regular job, which had shut down for the pandemic.  As soon as his job opened back up in late 2021, he went back to it, because the GrubHub work became exponentially less profitable for him.  People had stopped tipping, fees went up, etc.
I don't understand how I'm supposed to feel bad for unskilled workers who have no other options. Good thing that bad reviews actually works as intended. What's the point of reviews if nothing happens when you complain. This is good news like the stuff about cold callers getting beaten. Please keep up the good news.
Make sure I'm still tipping people? No, no I will not keep participating in the tip culture. Pay employees.
Literally delivering Uber Eats while I watch this.
I’m done with delivery apps
Bold to assume i use any of these apps
I used to like this guy until he said kate was dead... what an idiot
Capitalism without regulations consumes itself.
I worked for Grubhub and i really don’t want to bore anyone with details but who uses that platform is funding one of the worst bloodsucking corporations in the US
The only people it is working for are the customers? That's a wild statement. Ordering delivery is so expensive especially if you tip anything. Often times its more than twice the price of the order with all the fees included. Most of the time the price of the item is more than in the store plus the delivery fee. Then they will advertise free delivery and just add the fee to the menu item. If I buy chipotle in the store it is roughly 12$. If I have it delivered it is over 20$ before tip because the bowl that is 9$ in the store is 12$ on the app. No one is winning. No one.
The problem described about delivery apps taking an effective half or more of a company's profits is well described.  Apple, Google and Valve... all of whom also take 30%, are having the same effect on the entire tech and gaming sectors.  They all have value, but are taking far more than their share of the money and it has been decimating businesses constantly for years.

If you don’t want your milkshake raw-dogging air, why do you raw-dog air in indoor spaces maskless?
Remember the Domino's "30 Minutes or it's Free" safety disaster?
If you don’t make at least 80k/year you can’t afford these apps.   You need to get your own food.   If you make over 80k/year you shouldn’t be wasting money on these apps.   Moral: If you want cold food go get it yourself and bring it home.
I’m a college student who does Uber Eats because it’s one of the few jobs that fits my schedule as it is right now. This summer, I spent a LOT of time delivering Chick Fil A (the additional sting being doing this as a queer person) 15+ miles to people for no tip and barely making enough money to justify the amount of gas I used up while delivering. Please tip us and please be patient. The system is actively working against us.
Highwaymen are the most intelligent of all the types of thieves. Cat burgerlars are second in intelligence.  Basically, hackers are the best of breed. Also hackers are currently best in show. Its the thieves show ; you've probably noticed. They call themselves Capitalists.
Echoes of Dominos' old policy of 'half an hour or it's free.' Plenty of accidents caused by that.
A single slice of cake is not the saddest order ever. I once delivered three cookies from subway. And I have another order of a single medium strawberry shake to a dude.   How sad is that?
When cities pass legislation to reclassify delivery drivers from contractors to workers who need a minimum wage, the companies just add extra fees charged to the consumer. There’s no sense of social welfare for their workers. Look at what happened in Seattle.
Why don't Americans see that if your one full-time job doesn't pay you enough to live, the answer is demanding higher pay, not going to work for more corporate masters....
Gig jobs are not meant to be full time jobs. When will society understand that?  Gig workers asking for more is such an entitled thing to do. You agreed to the conditions and incentives when you signed up. Quit complaining, upskill yourself, and if you dont like working for doordash, just quit. Get a real job.  With that said im not for these stupid gig economy companies either. Listing menus of restaurants that didnt sign up should be illegal. These companies have founders that just want to make a quick fortune and cash out. They are leeches to society, and this culture exists because of insane valuation of these companies due to free money. This is why i support interest rates being non zero. Money should not be free. Cost of capital should not be zero.  Assjerks like adam neumann should not be millionaires
I've never ordered in food and doubt I ever will. I don't understand the appeal at all. It's way overpriced and soggy and not tasty at all.
What about the deliverers who refuse orders because the tip (included in the delivery order) isn't enough for them?
I want yall that cheered when he said he was baked out of his mind to imagine he said he was drunk, 'pissed as a fart' if you would cheer for that, or judge him for his choices morons yall
Ok, the driver sees the tip before they take the order, dude agreed to get that cake
In smaller communities in the 2010s-2020s, we've never had restaurants with the ability to hire delivery drivers. Half our restaurants have like 2-3 employees who are exploited and underpaid. Like, this was pre pandemic, post pandemic is worse.
FINALLY! Someone with a platform has agreed with my stance that the Devil won that fiddle battle by a large margin.
Just evil. The apps are horrible for workers, they don't make a profit, yet the owners of the apps are billionaires. It's criminal and should never be allowed.
Nah, we need to get rid of tipping altogether. Businesses, especially as big as this, need to pay fair wages. It should not be on the consumer to pay extra just to maintain a clear conscious.
At this stage the rest of the world should be organizing a intervention for the USA. What the fuck is going on there?!
58% Online highwaymen
For a guy with progressive views he talks a lot about tipping culture. Tips would be eliminated if the companies compensated employees properly for their labor. No need to tell people to tip if your main message is that delivery drivers should be properly compensated for their work.
doing god’s work reporting on important shit like this when the world is literally falling apart
I’ve never used a food app and I never will. I’m so sick of people doing stupid shit because it’s “convenient”. Mankind is doomed.
Omg, the ad at the start😅
A friend of mine ordered a single thing from buffalo wild wilds in door dash and it was like almost $30 for just himself. That’s absolutely insane. Local places have had their own delivery for way cheaper for years. Do that.
I'm old fashioned, I've seen too much about grubhub and them all before this video so I only ever ordered from places that I knew had their own delivery people. Most of them are mom and pop places that don't even have an app and you've gotta order on their website.
No, you should abolish Tips and Pay your workers fairly!!
It is a fact that late night show hosts named John are better thé late night show hosts named jimmy
Always call the restaurant and use their delivery driver.  Food apps destroy family owned restaurants and will continue to do so.
I'd like to see Fed x and Ups merge, and create FedUp
VOTE RFK 2024 🇺🇸🫡!!!!!
2:42 no shit huh? so true
So sad  so F disappointed John is becoming a real American . No F European John would emphasize so much on tipping and not even point out problem of low wages and f stupidity of living on tips . No other country in the world is like that
I'm not impressed with the laziness of people who have forgotten about the art of cooking considering the fact that an automatic dish washer is available in most abodes. Ordering food and having it delivered is nothing that I have ever done. I think Spoiled people waste money in such a manner and never realize what comes with the food.
If you can't do a job, don't. All the crying about it just makes you look sad and week.
Me: *orders DoorDash for lunch* “Welp, lemme open YouTube to pass the time while I wait.” *sees this video at the top of my feed* “ah fuck”
John & I are third cousins. On his Scottish side. Its funny John is a Scot.
Change the tipping culture in the US. It's ridiculous.
The fact that eDopt could one day exist frightens me.
The industrial revolution was a massive form of enslavement. The digital revolution is even worse.
I don't know whenever I use DoorDash. My order costs $13 and by time. It's also done delivery. It costs me over $40. So how am I coming out ahead? I'm pretty sure the company's coming out ahead. That's why I stopped using DoorDash and any of that c*** just cook my own food.
I take food that's just lying there on the pickup racks. Ive been eating good for free 2-3 times a week for over a year.
Introducing my new product line: iMakeMyOwnDamnFood   -Signed, a lazy Grubhub user
Yeah I’m sorry but this was the wrong conclusion to come to. You identified a systemic issue and responded to it by suggesting that consumers should tip more to try to counter corporate greed. That makes no sense.

This feels like a massive class action just waiting to happen
I hate everything that's related to an App.
I've been working taco bell 27 year's this is my 5th decade in fast food's. In the 80s at little ceasars we had 5 phone's on the wall to take call in orders to delivery. Our delivery guys unused their own cars own gas and relied on tips to put gas back in their car's which the war in the gulf under Bush sr.took gas from 1.29 A gallon to $3.19 along with the Alaskan oil spill.minimum wage was $3.35 A hour delivery guys was paid $2.85 A hour. College tuition and loans thru the roof it was no standing around it was over worked under paid worker's because like then and now corporation will not comply yo going below a 600% profit margins if they can get away with it they will continue think about what I said 1989 it's 2024. In the 90s I was a KFC head cook and catorer my c..o from the service spotted me and said how did you manage to pull k.p duty in the civilian world the work was that hard. Minimum wage was $3.85 still gas was $3.09 A gallon under Clinton student loan interest rates was at 29% if they can get away with it they will continue. Who owns every big chain franchise Pepsi and Coca Cola that's why you can't get a Pepsi at mc donalds or a coke at taco bell.2000-2010 min wage $7.25 by 2008 and finally internet on a phone and apps for delivery of everything groceries cars escorts you name it but apps are just magazine and newspaper ads from a phonebook put into computer format.Eddie Haskell delivered food on leave it to beaver in the 1950s the concept isn't new just communication improved the pay didn't..and here in Detroit during the heroin and crack 70s and to 1999 there was no delivery available closers like myself got an extra $1.50 A hour for hazard pay. Since the 2020 pandemic they got 2 people closing doing door dash grub hub and other dining in online and drive thru 7hrs a day to cut labor and increase profits again the 80s all over again underpaid overworked and stressed the f out with privileged people complaints and those seeking a free meal the worker's take the lost and get fired after too many losses
Hell no, the prices for delivery are INSANE these days, there's no excuse.
Is it my imagination or is there a laugh track now?
The USA seems so absolutely fucked up, glad I don't live there. Also, maybe a solution to the bigger picture would be that people stop being lazy and just cook for themselves? Or at the very least get some exercise and go and pick it up themselves?
People AND restaurants need to stop using these services. I truly don't understand the appeal of paying twice the cost of your meal.
So it costs less than the service costs, but that's still massively more than it was when I could just order on the phone.... 🤔 Woah great deal
Sorry, but I have to disagree on the discrepancy between reviewing the food vs the delivery driver. My wife and I will will sometimes order Chipotle through doordash in our town, and at least 50% of the time something we ordered  is just straight up not included with our order once it's delivered. For instance, just last week we ordered two meals, along with tortilla chips with a side of guacamole, and when we got the order there was a side of guacamole with no tortilla chips. It should be the delivery driver's responsibility to double-check that what they've picked up is actually accurate rather than solely relying on the restaurant. Moral of the story, both the restaurants and drivers have a responsibility in the fiscal contract with the consumer to do what they're being paid to do correctly.
Never used a delivery app gang!
Lyft fired me after a rider falsely accused me of using racial slurs.  I foolishly believed I was innocent until proven guilty and since this hadn't actually happened and the person had no evidence to support their story I didn't think they would fire me over it.  But they did.  So then I sent them in the video footage for that entire day.  It took me hours to reformat all the videos so that I could e-mail them one at a time to Lyft since they can't be bothered having a better way for me to send them footage.  After a month they finally watched the videos, saw that the person was full of crap, and reactivated my account.  No apology.  Nothing to make up for the lost income or the insult to me.  They really don't care about their drivers and they're not shy about it.  6 months later, same thing happened again.  This time I only missed two weeks of work over it.  I get to risk my life driving around for people who false accuse me of stuff because they don't want to pay for their ride that night.
We had an ice storm that shut down most of the city last year. Deliveries still going on, made a delivery to an old lady, she thanked me for risking my life to bring her her groceries.  and then closed the door, no tip, was annoyed but what can ya do right?
This is so american. You know the part of the USA that feels like a third world country.
The Devil did win that contest. He surprisingly gave up too easily.
Kinda crazy that these companies are screwing over their delivery workers, overcharging customers, and robbing restaurants, but still not being profitable. Feels like the apps should not exist, especially when I hear how much my friends use these apps out of straight laziness.
This guy is the next Gurbanguly lmao
I want Uber to pay us Jennifer Anistons salary
The one and only time I've ever used a FDS (Grubhub in this case), it took the driver 3 hours to deliver my food from a place that was less than 15 minutes away. It's a sham, if you ask me.
Ah, the video got restricted last week when i was watching it.  Surprised John didnt mention amazon to the road of monoploy by undercutting the bottom.
You didn’t even mention how DoorDash used to deduct the tips that drivers got from their pay so the tip just went towards subsidizing their pay instead of being a bonus for them.
tbh skype actually succeeded. they got bought by microsoft and then microsoft decided to discontinue it for ms teams ;)
I live in Indiana. Just to use one example. If I order from a single breakfast mean at IHOP, drive there, have someone bring it to my car, it’s around $13.00 not including the tip. If I order the exact same item from GrubHub or DoorSash it costs almost $30 not including the tip. Even the food itself is more on the apps. That doesn’t benefit the customer.
I remember when the only food that was delivered was from the local pizza and Chinese places (Dominos wasn't even born yet)...  Yep, I'm old...
I used to order from a Panera directly across the street from my work all the time.  Mainly because they were the last place in my area to still use their own driver.    He knew me, the fact I tipped cash, my order, what I was good with him subbing out, he was a literal dream delivery guy and I was always super happy to fork over the cash to show that I felt that.    Then they partnered with a delivery app and my order was never correct again.  The final straw for me came on Christmas week when I was working.  If I order on/near a holiday where folks would typically take time off I’ve always tipped extra.  Sort of a “I hate that I have to work and don’t get a lunch break, I hate that I have to ask you to do this, here’s an extra reward that will hopefully make it suck less” kind of thing.  I had $10 cash but also put a $10 tip on the order page.  The person literally stole my food.   $10 tip (basically 100% tip) to drive across the street and they stole it.  How desperate does your job have to make you that this becomes the plan?  Panera fixed it themselves, but I couldn’t go over to pick it up until work was over anyway.  I ended up not being able to take my meds until hours later which caused a migraine (yay working with disabilities I guess).    I told the manager that I was so sorry she had to deal with this (she was the one who fought for their store to keep the old delivery system as long as they did) but I could NOT go through that again and would only order again if it went back to the old way.    Bonus for my fellow worker bees: how many failures of capitalism in this comment alone?
I also think we should cut back on our usage of these apps. I understand there may be extenuating circumstances but many people could  make their own food instead of getting delivery.
John Oliver = Dracula flow
I totally agree with Jon's take on the Devil being a better fiddle player than Johnny. I always thought his riff was easily way cooler.
Tipping needs to go away. Companies need to pay their employees fairly. I will gladly pay more for my food instead of tipping for service that an employee should already be getting fairly paid to perform.
I've been an independent contractor driver for over 20 years. Can't argue with any of the points made in here. No one's going to like to hear this, but the restaurant needs to be charged significantly less and the customer needs to be charged significantly more. That $2.99 delivery fee doesn't pay for anything. It doesn't even pay for the food delivery app keep their lights on. It really needs to take more of the restaurant model, where it factors in all the expenses first, then charges the appropriate price, so a fair wage is paid to the drivers, and the customer is appropriately charged for the work that's done.
Don’t understand why we can’t pay people descent wages. Why anyone has to work 2-3 jobs just put the food on the table and roof over their head???
I am glad I have resisted the urge to use any of these services. Any delivery food I get is ordered directly from the restaurant and I make sure to tip fairly well on delivery orders.
As an able-bodied person in my 30s with a history of working in foodservice, I'm totally cool with calling a place and going to pick it up. These apps seemed like a scam from the very beginning, like the new version of protection fees to the mafia. (Side note: I typed up to this point before the 7:50 mark when John said mafia numbers) "Ehh, yous guys know, a lotta folks use the app already. Be a real shame if yous,  uh, lost out on business. Sounds like ya wanna pay our fees, eh?"
They rob the restaurants of 30% to 50% without lifting a finger. How do they manage to lose money?! Also, if I pay 20 different fees, INCLUDING a delivery fee, the driver should be well paid and not be reliant on tips!
a Brit telling people to tip lol. that is soo ironic. how about we get rid of tipping and pay people a better wage
Maybe you idiot should just copy the pizza place model. They have had people delivering their food for eighty years in this country. And it works.Nobody ubers or grub hubs for pizza.They just get with the pizza place and the pizza place.Send your pizza to you by a dude.That works at the pizza place.
Grubhub or like it is here in Germany called, Lieferando, is an absolutely shitshow of a company.
What happens  if they  Strike or unionize
@BikingDC would be happy this story got covered
These jobs absolutely suck.  Not a side hustle at all.  DoorDash is a ripoff
I looked it up last year and working in food delivery was much more dangerous than being a member of the military, a police officer or fireman.
That ebike delivery worker should have gotten a different bike....
Here is an idea. Support your community and the people that live and work there.  Get off your ass and go pick it up. Call the pizza place that has in-house drivers, skip the cake delivery, clearly you don't need it.  We've lost our way. Amazon is killing the retail industry and the associated jobs our kids used to work. Delivery apps are hurting everyone. The food is crappy, too expensive, and nobody wins using them..  Buy local, spend local, plan better. 😊
I just found out that DoorDash actually increases the cost of all the menu items in order to make their money back, that's on top of the delivery fees and (i pay the yearly thing)subscription. I found out they're not supposed to give you the actual receipt, but my dasher did and I compared the prices and realized I'd been had.  The only grocery delivery out here is doordash or instacart, and I hate the latter but have no other options, I can't drive. Instacart actually increases the costs of all grocery items by 1-5 dollars more than if you went into the store yourself, which is also bullshit because these price hikes are for everyone whether you're a subscriber or not(which, I sadly am).  I say all this to put down the idea that customers are getting the better deal, no we aren't, they created a problem (service fees) to solve their financial conundrums and offered the solution (subscriptions) to make it cheaper, but they're also increasing the cost of the thing you're buying and pocketing the difference, and on top of that, YOU are offsetting their pay to the drivers by tipping them, and not just the typical tips left back in the day, we're talking 4-8 dollars for things that are like meals, and 20-25% on groceries. So no, the customers aren't making off like bandits, EVERYONE is getting screwed, if anything it's the customer getting screwed the hardest.
When Aretha Franklin was asked, "What's the hardest part of your life?" she said, "Figuring out what to have for dinner." This issue has so many factors, not to mention how hard it is to literally feed your family a home cooked meal and have two full-time jobs. Basically impossible. We ALWAYS give five stars and a big tip, even if they're a dick. Sometimes you just have a bad day.
Seattle should have had more focus on it here. I was working as a full-time, 7 days a week shopper on the Shipt app (owned by Target) but the city council passed a law in 2022 that went into effect on 1/13/24 that was meant to guarantee us better pay and protections so low ratings wouldnt get us arbitrarily dropped from the apps. Shipt made the false claims that they didn't have the infrastructure to deal with keeping track of the pay increases and other changes. So they decided to abandon the zip codes inside the entire city of Seattle. Now, if I want to shop on the app for customers, I have to physically travel outside the city limits to be able to see orders and all of the preferred customers that I had built up a rapport with inside the city of Seattle, they can't get deliveries anymore.  Then on 1/20/24, I sustained a pinched nerve in my back and I haven't been able to do any work since then. Well, I have done 2x orders on the Shipt app, but with my pinched nerve in my back and they both took me over 50% longer than they used to before my injury. Because they were both outside of the Seattle city limits, Shipt was able to get away with paying me $9 and $6 respectively for each order and only the $9 order tipped me anything. Luckily both gave me a 5-star review, but that is not a sustainable income. Disabled people (temporarily or permanently) are not always able to do every kind of job, but when you are desperate to work so that you keep a roof over your head, these jobs can be a life saver. However, when $5 is the average pay out that these big app companies are allowed to get away with paying to the gig workers, then something needs to change.  Changing the laws back to allow them to operate as they were before is counter intuitive to paying workers proper wages, but raising the guaranteed pay for gig workers also poses the problem that we are facing in Seattle, where some app companies just decided to cut the city out of their business plans. Customers suffer, workers suffer and the stores suffer sales losses as well. There is no real good solution.  One thing that most people can do is rate 5-stars more often and tip too! I've done Shipt orders in 27 states since 2022 and the true average shopper is paid on average $6 per order across the country. So if you were able to afford to have your groceries shopped and delivered to you, then please think about your shopper/deliverer. They are human also and they deserve to be paid for doing you the favor of delivering to your door. Of the 6,388 customers that I helped on the Shipt app, I averaged 30% of them tipped anything at all. If the restaurant waiters and waitresses only got tips from 30% of their customers, do you think you would get food delivered to your table anymore? Most restaurants would either become buffett style or close down. And they are just delivering to your table within the same restaurant that you went to. Gig app workers are delivering thru traffic and weather to your door! The least you can do is give them a couple of extra bucks for all they did for you. $2 goes a long way for gig workers.  Thanks to the writers and researchers for this segment. More focus needs to be placed on these situations. It does help!
I'd rather pay $50 for crack than for a damn burrito. At least then most of the money will go to a local business man
they charge 15% of the order value! It is almost more then what the restaurant makes...
I used to be a delivery driver. I did it because I'm disabled and needed a job with completely flexible days and hours because I needed to be able to go home early or skip a day if I was physically not able to work without the constant fear of being fired or penalized by my employer for being sick or dealing with sometimes severe chronic pain. Not to mention delivery driving saved me from the constant stream of abuse I had to endure when I was working a "regular" job.  As for "who uses these services," a whole lot of my regualar custoers while I was driving were elderly or disabled people who couldn't easily get out to get their own groceries or meals. Lazy stoners were definitely the minority.
Did doordash delivery for a summer. It sucked
You have to be next level terrible to be in the middle of a natural disaster and consider ordering someone to bring you something in the middle of that natural disaster.
0:45 lmao someone in the crowd shouting "what?!" Because of how nonsensical the ad was
Don't tip. Let these companies fall since their business models are unsustainable.
18:30 Immediately looked up as I thought someone called my name. Not this dang book again. UGH
I worked at a local pizza place right before the pandemic as a paid delivery driver. At one point someone walked in asking to pick up a DoorDash order, the owner explained they had not signed up for DoorDash and told them to leave. The owner then went on the app and saw that they were indeed listed but also that the app contained the trademarked logo and images of the menu that the owners held the copyright for. They steal whatever they can and keep getting away with it.
I bet, if the officers of these companies took a pay cut, they'd be making money..... i also doubt they are losing as much money as they claim. I bet they use Hollywood accounting
I refuse to use those services.  Paying nearly double for the food I offered to get it cold and an hour later than expected isn't worth my time or money.
CDB does not approve of this video. 😂😂😂😂
john oliver promoting tipping? wtf happened to this show
God damnit Jon. We do NOT HAVE TO TIP.  You're literally doing what the delivery apps are doing to us.  Should they have tipped morally? Maybe. But no one HAS to tip.   It's not my job to subsidize your pay for your employer.
I bought a brand new Deliveroo backpack for just 5 Euro. It's very hard to get the (suspected to be very toxic, due to reflective metal particles) logo's off of it, but it's very sturdy and has suitcase-like space. It's also fairly comfortable to wear.  I can't push my wife's wheelchair and drag a suitcase along at the same time when we go on holiday, so a cheap huge sturdy backpack is a real life-saver.
I got a free $20 from Uber Eats, so I ordered some food from a place, but they wouldn't let me pick it up from the place myself. So I told them to just deliver it to the building next door while I waited. The guy came out of his car with the bag and walked over to me. It didn't even come from the store? It came from a ghost kitchen?
I'm 42, nvr used any app, not even pizza delivery and I used to be one....that's probably why
All the interviews on this show are three or four years old.   This show was investigated three years ago and they just got around to airing it now.     Why?
considering ive had drivers say they delivered the food and never did, is sus
When I worked at a restaurant that hired it's own delivery drivers, and someone asked what should they tip, I always told them, "What is it worth to you not to have to come pick up the food yourself?"
I always order delivery through the restaurant website after I found that the price was higher through the delivery service site (I don't use "apps", just the web on my desktop)...
Pause on the grubhub bill at 6:56.  58% withheld is everything from delivery people's pay, to VAT. It's not GrubHub's cut at all. So yeah, when you pay the people who work for you and your taxes, you have less money...
I agree with all of this, except the tip part.  Zero tips.  The customer should not be subsidizing these companies that refuse to pay their workers a livable wage.  ZERO TIPS, ZERO every time.  The only way people will learn to stop working for starvation wages is if they can't survive on it.  Pay the workers a proper wage for their work.  Tips are a call back to slavery and Jim Crow era FFS.  This has to end NOW.
Postmates has laid waste to a lot of my money.
I am sorry but Americans just need to learn how to cook. As a German who has spent time in the US, it is crazy to me how few people in the USA are able to do basic cooking and how often they order food...
At DoorDash the tips make up 72% of your pay. At least 50% of people don’t tip at all and the ones that do, only tip $2. Only 1% of all customers will tip 15 to 20% of the order.  On top of that DoorDash has taken $.50 per order away from the driver dropping the minimum fee to two dollars instead of $2.50 per order. This cost a driver over $100 a week of pay. This is per driver and how many drivers does DoorDash have? They treat their drivers like dog shit.
It's ROBOT delivery time!
He’s a council member and he’s delivering food?! Talk about serving the people😂
I think that the tipping system is already problematic, but for delivery drivers in particular it just doesn’t work. For waiters and waitresses, bartenders, and other jobs that require interaction with the customer, actually being face-to-face with these people is gonna make you more likely to tip, and at least based on the people i’ve worked with, it’s sustainable for them (still deserve a living wage though). But the point is, there is a standard for poor, good, and most importantly great service that customers can use to merit tipping.   Delivery drivers do not get that same benefit, you talk to them for 5 seconds and then they leave. “Great” service is the baseline, and they don’t have the opportunity to play the system to their advantage like those other jobs would. So especially for delivery drivers, wages need to go up
Murica... it is always about money/profit and exploitation.
To be fair we shouldn't have to tip for people to make a living wage. Tipping culture needs to end, but these apps won't survive without it.
That joke 1 min in was for the Gays and I see you writer at Last Week Tonight
Ordered a $20 pizza that ended up costing like $46 after all the fees and tip and never ordered delivery again. Idk why people use these.
Its insane to me  (someone not in the US) how much money is spent on lobyying, surely it will be more cost effective to just pay the workers no?
Only Uber eats from this day on till they are the only player and it becomes a monopoly where they can treat their "contractors" even worse.
the joke about skype might be the best joke ever on Last Week Tonight
Once I realized restaurants were charging more on the apps then their own website, I stopped using the apps entirely. One of my favorite taquerias was charging 2 dollars more per item on the app then on their website just to offset the cost of being on Postmates
So, all food delivery folks only use bicycles? Good thing none of them use cars, because that'd be really expensive! 🙄
John Oliver I love you but it feels like you ignore the real issue on this one.
Boy Boy did a great video about Uber Eats and how fucked up it is, I recommend checking it out
Johnny lost, no doubt about it. The band of demons rocked it out!
Hey, if you don't want me to order food during a tornado then don't accept orders. Not my problem.
This guy has become so anti Christian..but why?
The fact that we are expected to tip *before* a service is rendered, all the while the companies make it harder to both decrease and increase tips after said service has been completed, shows how far off the mark we are when it comes to what is supposed to be considered…”gratuity”.
There is absolutely no way uber eats is loosing money! They make a 30% profit on food they havent invested a single penny in, then another profit on a service fee, another on a delivery fee. So thats making money from the customer and restaurant on each order. Then add that up at a multiplier of millions of orders per Day. They are crushing it, don't let them fool you.
of all the things, how can the conclusion be "you have to tipp" like whaaat?
I’ve noticed the default tipping amounts on some of these apps is stupidly low.  I always do a custom tip and add more, but it takes extra steps and I doubt most people even think about that.
Well now I just wanna know how stoned John legitimately is...?..?...?
over a decade? you mean 2 decades.
3 massive L's line was Genius. Hurts, but I'll be damned if it isn't funny.
I do not order food from delivery apps, EVER. I care about the places that provide me food and want them to get my money for the product and don't really care about middle men and their model promoting sloth.
What gets me is that the driver in the beginning segment lists so many variations of "people can't get stuff because they can't drive for whatever reason" just emphasizing the ridiculous layout of American cities where not having access to a car means you're more or less stranded where you are. If I could not drive, every place I'll ever need to go for my regular shopping needs is accessible by walking, biking or taking a bus.
John Oliver best shit that happened to the USA in the last decade
my room mate worked for grub hub derring the pan dem and a bit after he was 77-78 years old at the time and got in to multiple car crashes over that time and countless close calls why is a delivery company even letting a 77 year old work for them !!
As someone north of 30 who isn't afraid to make phone calls and get his own food, I will never use these apps.
Ive never downloaded a food delivery app, who wants to pay more for cold food? Of the restaurant doesnt deliver, eat there.
Nah. Fuck tips and fuck delivery apps. It's not the customer's responsibility to make sure workers are getting paid fair wages. If the job doesn't pay enough everyone should quit. I don't use delivery apps because the increased price isn't worth it. I'll just call to order and pick up the food myself.
Unless america unites and strengthens Unions, all employees in the country WILL BE FUCKED OVER!!
these businesses rose to prominence because of Covid. People are out and about now and these apps need to fade away.
I just had a friend in cali that went on a multi hour bitch fit cus something he normally orders was now a little over 50 dollars for a meal for him and his mother. We were trying to figure out how the hell this was even possible to have the prices jacked up so instantaneously and so high.  Now i got to send him a link to this video and say that British Toucan Touts Troubles now has all the details on what the hell happened that night  Thanks John ❤️
Now with pre-tipping delivery drivers are prioritizing order on which offer the bigger tips. With many orders being canceled or never picked and the store having to eat that cost.
In Germany we don't say gig Economy, we say "Scheinselbstständigkeit" and I think thats beautiful.
There's too many of them. If they're not profitable then stop and give the others a chance. What if we all just decide to use one? What's the one that's best to the deliverers?
I signed up for a nearby grocery delivery. $100 a year with free delivery on orders over $35. Even though I live a single mile from the store, it's worth it for the time it takes to shop and get food. Now John Oliver has me worried about this even though the store adds a 5% tip fee on all of my groceries.  (Ironically, they just started a mobile grocery program and a mini-store pops up in front of my house every other Saturday.)
Food delivery apps pissed me off when I delivered pizza. I’d be sitting in the store waiting for a delivery and a bunch of 3rd party drivers come in Pretty much leaving  other drivers fighting over scraps.
Companies should be liable for the injuries their contractors get while working for them. All companies. All the fucking time. If this means they get sued out of existence, that only means the business was based on ruining people's lives in the first place.
There is absolutely, positively no way Uber Eats makes no money... they have no employees, no salary pay to those employees... the main thing, is they very LIKELY pay all their executives an extreme amount to make it look like they make no profit. They also likely take tips.
John Oliver being a literal devil's advocate lol.
Yeah i only use the shit apps for pick up orders. Only ppl that don't mind throwing away money still use it for delivery since a 20$ order bcomes a 35$ order after fees and tip
I used to do call center customer service. Companies asking for reviews of their "services" are just looking for any blemish to deny a worker a bonus, a raise (that's probably less than inflation anyway), or continued employment. I treat every last one as if a cop was asking. It's 5 stars, I loved it, and you can get a warrant if you want anything else out of me. I ain't narc'in' on a delivery driver.
The gig is to the company your a replaceable part to a corporate wheel that will grind you down and replace you .
Why is the "Guy in New York" sound like "Guy in Mexico"?
My job doesn’t even work with grubhub, our system doesn’t even take orders. Once a week we get a call from someone asking where their grubhub order is.
Any news or comedy show that draws attention to the economic hardships experienced by many people is missing an ideal opportunity to help create a better system if they don't mention the idea of sharing natural wealth equally. IF we charge fees to industries when they emit pollution, deplete natural resources or destroy wildlife habitat, then share fee proceeds to all people, no one will live in abject poverty, and all workers will have more latitude to leave a disagreeable job situation, without facing a thtreat of becoming destitute.  Why is the idea that natural wealth belongs to all still not part of the public discourse?
i love that you can tell when twitter poster xillennials write an episode, or when former cracked writers write an episode or the gen x professionals write. john oliver as british squidward is the perfect mouthpiece at the intersection of the american media left
I’ll never become a delivery driver. I used to deliver pizzas for Pizza Hunt and they flat out told me they use door dash to deliver orders to neighborhoods they don’t send their delivery drivers to for safety reasons.  You get all the risks of a delivery driver and none of the benefits and all for less pay.
I may never understand the tipping culture in usa🙄
Its hard to tip when ur order for a burger and fries is alread $30 without a tip
Should check the movie Zwigato , about food delivery
Why just millenials?  The oldest ones are now 42. It's really the zoomers that are going to have a hard time with a house.  Anyway, I'm going to say just don't use the apps.  If they're not able to even turn a profit after taking money from all parties (including the customer who pays significantly more), they simply shouldn't exist.  The model of being in the hole until you can capture the market and screw everyone over even more is an inefficiency.
I've been doing pretty decent using DD as my part time gig for extra cash. Averaging $25/hr
Wait, wait, wait... You aren't getting money back by using DoorDash because the company is losing money. That is not how that works. No matter how you slice it, it costs more to use a DoorDash-esque service than it does to go get the food yourself. You are always losing money using these terrible services. The only people winning are the execs with the massive payouts when the company gets sold. Every other person in the system is getting fucked all the time. There is noting, absolutely NOTHING good about any of these services.  As a Millennial, I promise you, they aren't helping us. Calling them a subsidy, while maybe slightly comical, is dangerously close to an outright lie.  I am honestly shocked John went along with that statement instead of turning on it for the bullshit it is.
I was once working for DoorDash, waiting in a parking lot near my home where a lot of potential restaurants were clustered together. I had an order come in for Chipotle, a location which I could see from where I was parked. I could probably have gotten out and walked there in 2 minutes, but since I wanted to be able to leave as quickly as possible, I drove over.  Somehow, the app dinged me as arriving "11 minutes late" and there was no method for me to appeal. It also threatened me that, should it happen again, I could be de-platformed. I don't know how I could have arrived faster than "I'm already here when you assigned the order to me...." O.o
I am surprised that the issue of resturants leaving food app deliveries by the door and random people stealing them wasn't addressed. It is pretty common.
This app for everything shit is starting to be cringe. We need to get off our asses and cook or get the food ourselves. What if your drunk or high? We should also make sure we live in walkable areas. We should be able to just walk 5min to a place to grab a bite to eat but we have to pay someone to drive to the other side of town for us because that’s where the food is. We don’t know how to live normally ffs.
PLEASE! YOU HAVE TO TIP! Even $1 goes a long way!
I heard somewhere that MBS is an investor in doordash. If true, that's a bit disturbing
I used to deliver many years ago. Looking back, it's a miracle I was never robbed. I was threatened by a drunk county sheriff for mixing up his credit slip with the receipt, but that's an entirely different story. I still keep in touch with other former coworkers and while it would be against company policy, our boss actually encouraged his drivers to be packing. The amount of naked people answering the door cannot be understated. And they're never easy on the eyes. Middle-class families tipped the best. Poor people generally didn't tip at all (usually staring holes through you. Idk why, but it was creepy af) and rich people usually tipped 5 to 10%. Older people still think $1 is a good tip like it's still 1980. Oddly, the later you arrived, generally the more you were tipped. If you got there fast, no tip! That never made any sense to me, but it was a trend I continually saw for the 2 years I was doing it.
Is it better to watch this on MAX or YouTube for John Oliver?  Such great content.
i have a restaurant and we have a 30% contract (excluding random deals that can take up to 40%) and it feels like daylight robbery to pay $15 for something online and $12 in store. all to compensate for how much they take from us.
We can use AI to make all the computational decisions and use renewable energy to power mainframes to drive the cost of service down to zero  Zero marginal cost should be our goal  Socialize these institutions
The part the devil plays is very easy to play on the fiddle the reason he knew he’d been beat is because Jonny played way more skillfully.
If your position requires tips in order to have a wage it means you work as a charity.
I stopped using them because I don't want to pay 47 dollars for a fuckin cheeseburger 😂
Regarding rating I think the average person thinks the rating is just for the food and not the delivery person.  Though I will say if you get missing or eaten food, you might be allowed to give a lower review score.
Happy Easter
Waste of money
I have a rare condition which gives me 10 stomachs, 32 brains and nine pairs of testicles but thank god I don't have more than 100 teeth so you can't call me a leech.
John, you're usually pretty on point, but this episode you're just entirely wrong. Johnny *wasn't* better than the Devil, true, but that's also not the point. Johnny lost the second he agreed to wager his soul to sate his pride. By conceding the bout, the Devil inflated Johnny's pride, giving him a physical manifestation of it in the golden fiddle. If he'd won, then Johnny might have found humility and repented, finding salvation in Christ, but this way the Devil has Johnny forever.
The tipping culture in the US just needs to be abolished
What are we going to do when Jon Oliver inadvertently founded the eDopt app?
it's absolutely no surprise at all that food delivery screws over everyone - the business and the user.   Just call your goddamn store and order directly. These apps are horrible, they screw everything up and everyone blames everyone else and it's extremely frustrating.
So... Can someone explain how these companies are worth millions and billions when they lose money? Who is investing in them?
I reject food delivery services outright. They are an invention out of pure laziness and unlike the traditional delivery model, they are not backed by food with any particular margin that can offset costs. There is no for for these companies to succeed until they convince you somehow that your minuscule convenience is worth paying exorbitantly high prices. The same people who would complain about the evils of capitalism are  the people who are ok with, $25 DoorDash McDonald’s
Millennials cry and make excuses enough without any help from you.
I'm now happy that I've never used GrubHub.
Soon as they showed the clip and I saw Cramer laughing like Jimmy Fallon just heard "why did the chicken cross the road?" I knew John was gonna laser that dude with a heat seeking comedy missile
We really need universal healthcare
TIP WITH CASH 💰 ❤️
Was that binging with babish doing the voiceover?
does the customer know what route the delivery person will have to take?
So glad my weed is delivered by the dispensary and not a delivery service 🍀
Wasn't running a business at a loss to eliminate competition made illegal as a monopoly technique?
wtf, John? have you ever actually ordered from a food delivery app? it's _not_ a good deal; it's a _terrible_ deal. you can easily wind up paying twice as much for the privilege of using the app. and your takeaway is to throw away more money at it? how about we just let the business model be unviable instead of picking up the corporate pay slack? if that means no more food delivery apps, good riddance, honestly.
THE BOTTOM FRIENDLY MENU????HSDBGFYHSDBGHSDBH
Damn, John... you're no longer the funniest man on your own show, I'm afraid  AN ORPHANAGE 😂😂😂😂😂
What? He needed FIFTEEN delivery workers each night to deliver food from his restaurant? Why do people have to lie so badly like this? It's why I never trust any business.
"BUT YOU GOTTA FUCKING TIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!"    Thanks John :)
He should do a video on tips/tipping culture at regular restauraunts/hotels. The amount of myths perpetuated by all three parties (employers/employees/customers) just makes the issue keep getting worse.
Sounds like a failed business model. If you can't provide a livable wage for your employees then you have failed the business model.
No, you absolutely should tell people to stop using Apps. Cook or go out to eat. Cooking is much cheaper if you know what you're doing.
As someone who did Doordash during the pandemic. The pay was such bullshit. I had to make a ton of deliveries just to make $100. Because unless I did deliveries at a “peak time” and got lucky with where and who I was delivering to or else I got the obnoxiously bare minimum you can possibly get from a single delivery which best case scenario would pay for the tank of gas you used to drive all around a county for 7-8 deliveries.  And that’s not even getting into the tax part
What, no no no, it's going public! It's the stock market! Institutional investors and pension funds are going to be left holding the disaster!
It’s not the tipping that’s the problem it’s the fees.  He didn’t even talk about the fees, he’s almost promoting these apps.  BS
Nothing shows how lazy people are like  food delivery apps. A 12 dollar combo is 20$ on the app, plus service fees, delivery fees, all that inflates how much tax you pay and if you dont tip 30% they call you poor. So what i see is people paying 30$ or more  for a 12 $ meal cause they dont want to drive 10 minutes to mcdonalds. All the while the driver is geting a dollar and the restraunt gets a fraction. So all the money is going to some app that runs on it own and cost almost nothing to maintain in the grand shceme.
You’re all going to see. Grandpa 1 or 2. 🤫 shhh it’s nap time. While you’re entertained by b.s. Keep it down, shh. Whisper: Don’t forget to vote because it really matters. 🤭
It’s called rent seeking. The consumer and service provider both lose, and the manager app in the middle takes the bulk of the previous efficiencies in that market.
To be fair, I have literally met doctors, scientist and college professors who use Uber as a way to meet more people in their community.
When are you going to expose the Jehovah's Witnesses for covering up CSA?
I remember when these jobs required you to be capable of spending your own money on the items you were collecting just to have a job.
"rawdogging the air" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm almost proud to say that I have never used a food delivery app. :3
ALL these disgusting "gig" apps are leeches and are destroying America. It makes a few people rich for doing almost nothing while the people who enrich them get horrible pay and no benefits and no security. It's a horrible conservative destruction of our worker base.
13:05 Almost fell out of my chair... oh jesus
"Choose your hours"  As a PhD student, that's such a huge trap. It's a morbid joke in grad school that "You have the freedom to work any 80 hours you want each week."
This is all I needed to delete GrubHub from my phone ... Thanks John! ...
2:04 I broke down in my seat at this joke. A+
When my $15 order turns to 40+ dollars after tax and tip and fees, I don’t think I’m paying less than that app is worth 🤷🏾‍♀️
At this point, it's just the devil we know and begrudgingly accept rather than bolster any outright resistance, one can't begin to imagine how many other shady or downright immoral business practices deployed by avaricious corporations.
I've never used a food delivery app and I never will
Wouldn't be a John Oliver program if he didn't allude to potentially fucking a horse.
Wow this hits home. I have a broken leg but fortunately, I have a real job, insurance and a short term disability claim. I'm kinda enjoying the time off but I want to walk.
15-20 Dollars minimum wage. No less! Decent working conditions and social security, health insurance, compensated vacation days. Thats whats needed! No more bullshit no more exploitation of labour driving people to the brink of existence. Needs an organised trade union and political campaign ( that could be the new basis for a workers party) to combat big business and these gangster capitalists.
Why would you cross 2 bridges on a bike to get to Roosevelt Island? There are 2 public transportation methods to get there and I'm pretty sure both allow bikes and are a LOT faster. Take the tram. It's both a form of transportation and also something New Yorkers take with 5 year old kids and tell them it's a ride.
Really letting Me down. Jon and John. Whole lotta real issues I thought you guys would cover. Instead, stuff that has not any impact on what’s coming. Planned out years ago. You think We went to Iraq for Oil though. 😂 This country 😊lol😂
Why would he do that!
A local Peruvian restaurant that I used to live near provided free delivery if you called them directly. Either you paid 20 and gave 20, or you paid 40 to a 2nd party and they gave 15, not including tips. As crazy as it is I get it.
good shit John
Listen to Faerie Queen by Heather Alexander, It's a fantasy version of Devil went Down to Georgia AND it's better IMO.
Johnny is a technically better fiddler. The competition was about being a better fiddler...not making more interesting music.   Johnny won fair and square.  Also, DD tips regularly make up 65% or more of driver pay.
These workers need a union.
Grubhub did so much shady shit for us, too. They would, for all intents and purposes, intercept our calls. They'd pretend to be at the store on the phone, then put the order in through the app. They were hijacking customers who were trying to call us directly.   Grubhub had a higher google listing than us, and the listing had a phone number that wasn't ours. If you voice commanded to call us, it would call their number.   We got rid of the apps, fuck them.   Edit: Also, wanna add. There's no way it's cheaper for the customer to use these apps. And that nyc 30 dollar hourly (got changed anyway) fucked drivers who worked for the restaurant bc people weren't tipping. Tipped employees get less per hour, and no I'm not for removing tipped employee. That's a different argument. I'd rather be at the mercy of the customer than a company, you know?
Never in life ordered food on an app. Won't even order on those little kiosks things.  I'm old.
Tipping is a scam.  Obviously I just don't eat out or order or do anything that requires a tip.    But it's stupid and the only way to change it is to not new a part of it.  Let's all stop eating from restaurants, problem solved right?
I've ordered on DoorDash, and the delivery person has repeatedly simply left my order on my doorstep without any notification. This is despite specific instructions to HAND IT TO ME. I always choose the 'biggest tip' hoping to get a good delivery... By FAR... my biggest disappointment with deliveries has been the PERSON doing the delivery.
I use doordash at least once a week and feel terrible every time. It's an egregious ripoff and at least half the time the order is wrong or freezing cold.  And I tip a large amount before the order each time, if you tip after, they won't bring your food. But I'll continue to use it because of our busy lives with young kids.  And it's over 30 minute round trip from my house to the closest restaurant
This is why a little inflation is good. These apps started when money could be borrowed at near 0%, sometimes even negative rates. IPOs can make whatever promise and money would flow in hoping to catch the next iPhone. But now investors need to see a business that makes money and they are tighten wallets. Elon and doordash are going to go bankrupt and not a moment too soon.
I get why we need to tip. And I agree to some extent. But then again, this tipping would only keep afloat greedy corporations that would continue to leech off of these delivery personnel.
My barber charges me a flat fee for his labor because he knows his worth. No fees, no expectation of a tip. The food service industry needs to do the same
These kinds of gig jobs are excluded for people with criminal records or misdemeanors. I got a misdemeanor a few years back and I tried to apply for a driver and delivery app to make some money. I applied to Uber, Lyft, Doordash, and Favor, but rejected because my background check. I really needed a job to pay off my legal fees and all I got from Favor was an email saying, "We wish you good luck in all your endeavors." But after seeing all that, I think I might've dodged a bullet.
You should talk about contract workers and how the reinstatement of the contract workers law is messing up so many small organizations, but huge ones like Door Dash are apparently just going to pay the fees and pass it on to everyone else. A company I work for as a contractor just dissolved a large amount of their contracts with gig workers because the law went back into effect. This is an amazing company that pays its contract workers well, but because of a few requirements, can no longer contract with gig workers. Instead they are having to completely switch the employee structure to meet the law. I’m not saying that it shouldn’t happen, but why do small organizations have to follow the law, but big companies like Door Dash get to continue to take advantage of gig workers and just pay a fine?
me seeing this topic like, aw Fuck he's gonna ruin this for me now...... [play]
wait until you learn about Uber & Lyft
I had someone order a pack of batteries at 1am and tipped 10$ so they must really need those AAs
You didn’t even mention how the consumer often gets screwed because the delivery apps will hire anyone with a pulse which leads to food being stolen or tampered with, food being delivered very late because the driver takes their time delivering it, drivers delivering food in filthy cars, drivers having their young kids pick up and drop off the food, etc.
You guys bought the company propaganda hook line and sinker on this one. "customers/millenials are getting subsidized"?  You talked about the restaurants losing a big cut, the delivery workers not getting paid enough, the customers seeing higher prices, and the "company" isn't making a profit, so then where is all the money going? You forget corporate is also made of labor costs and other expenses "of running a webapp". Try googling "grubhub ceo salary" or "grubhub executive salary" or simply "grubhub glassdoor salary". And then you see plainly who's getting squeezed, who isn't, and who's getting "subsidized".
I legit just saved $20 on lunch by driving the 5 minutes to grab the food… that’s before tip
now you know how insurance works, doctors charge more for procedures because insurance companies only pay out 50%, it inflates all prices.
I’ve never actually used a delivery app and I am 32. If I convince myself that I need take out bad enough to go get it myself I order it much less often than I probably would otherwise. I cook my own food more & save more $.
He is totally right about the two violin solos in Devil Went Down to Georgia.
I’ve quit using DoorDash, the fees are ridiculous. The fees add up to be a bigger price than the food itself.
I’d never trust anyone from any of those companies to bring me food….
Delivery apps are both a gift and a curse to establishments. Like an uncle that buys you expensive gifts, but diddles you when you get home.
Delivery workers' job being among the deadliest is sobering. A human being's time should be valued, as the minimum wage, at a rate that would be livable hourly. Our world is changing drastically either way, we should steer it best we can.
This is the most first world nonsense you can dream up besides talking about onlyfans dilemmas.  The consumer is the actual problem as they shouldn’t take part in ordering food when you should be cooking.
I’m one of the few crazy people that pays monthly for DoorDash’s membership, and so far I’ve saved hundreds of dollars on my deliveries even with the subscription. I’d like to see what impact that has on the restaurants
Kendall Jenner didn’t solve racism.   Cody Rhodes did.
America is becoming more dystopian day by day, buckle in everyone
I stopped getting delivery before these apps when I remembered being a driver and having to pay for gas. Pick up your food!
Tip your servers.. or be like the rest of the world and give your servers a livable wage
It's illegal to do evaluate independent contractors
This didn't even mention the PREDATORY METHODS food delivery services use to push fairer, restaurant-owned delivery services out of the market: for instance, in Europe they registered hundreds of thousands of website domains that sound and look EXACTLY like specific restaurants in your area. Meaning: if you google that specific restaurant near you, you will often see  MULTIPLE fake websites that imitate the original restaurant, which are actually run by these big delivery apps, not by the actual restaurant, cutting themselves in-between you and the restaurant without the restaurant's consent and the customer's knowledge, even if that restaurant has it's own website and delivery service.
Not only are these standard operating procedures for all delivery apps, apps in general have strong armed themselves into the industries that they operate in. Uber, Lyft have also been found out  how they infiltrated many sectors
This was well informative and much needed, but I have to say as a DoorDash driver, I would like to add that these delivery jobs are also a b**** on taxes.
In NYC, delivery people use electric bikes and scooters and do not obey ANY traffic laws. They go through red lights, ride on the sidewalks, go the wrong way on one-way streets. I rarely used the delivery apps and now I have completely stopped, not because of the fees, but because of the irresponsibility of the delivery people. It would be great if the apps took some responsibility and actually trained and licensed the delivery people to ensure that they don't hit pedestrians or cause accidents.
"Can't spell 'milennial' without three massive L's." I haven't something so hard that it almost made me cry. 🥲
I think doordash used to take 30% from the restaurant I worked at.   The drivers had no interest in getting the food to the customer fast.   They were often working for 2-3 apps at the same time taking as many orders as they could.    Many customers didn't like how cold and stale the food was by the time it got to them.
Theres a term for this. Its called a "racket".
Wealthy CEOs are *so* bloody disconnected from reality, it's not even funny. Makes me utterly sick. 🤮  Do yourself a favor and physically go to a restaurant. If you like it, return later. If not, stick to purchasing groceries and preparing your own friggin' food. It's not that hard anymore, either.
The whole "disruptive" model of all of these companies is push all of the costs onto the "contractors" and pay them as little as possible.  That's not genius disruption. That is fucking evil greed!
"Happy Easter, by the way." Perfection!
John has never seen drugs in real life
The people complaining about tipping culture are usually the ones that tip $2-3 on a DoorDash order, and then get upset when it takes an hour plus to get it delivered.
I love how every capitalism story these days results in a monopoly. Capitalism is fundamentally flawed. It organically results in monopoly being the most profitable business model.
Yall didnt even mention how these food apps are run by people who worked for some of the biggest companies in acquisitions.  These companies use "Gut and Run tactics", like offering a product maker a platform, restricting them under predatory and false pretenses, and then running them out of business to lower the value, buying them and either selling everything or running it into the ground and selling it off. This happens with some of the most well known and liked companies, like Whole foods and Amazon, which makes sense.   These CEOs saw what uber was doing and wanted slices of the pie, so exactly like the post mates guy said, they just went balls to the wall. This also happens with restaurants in the form of ghost kitchens. The idea is that you offer a name brand product, produced out of a kitchen that also cooks other brand name products for other businesses. Theres also the reverse, where youd see a fancy looking restaurant or see the name of a restaurant youve never been to and tap on it and see really well produced pics, amazing reviews, but behind the scenes, its really pizza hut making the food. These are both present in most of the apps and endemic. i plan on doing more research on ghost kitchens specifically, but i talk a lot about the aquisition thing in this video https://youtu.be/Bf8AsyNsK-g?si=vBml9wta5cUq_iQE in case yall wanna check it out.
Yeah, I have never used a delivery app, because not a one of them serves where I live. I am a wheelchair user who cannot drive. I need this service, but  none of them are out here.
I cook in a cafe and work for tips - a place that would never have had delivery before these apps. Hate that I do the same amount of kitchen work, but someone else gets my tip cause they do the "hard part" of driving the food in a car to someone's apartment.
Johnny's Fiddle playing was on a technical standpoint more impressive and demonstrated a rich knowledge of how to play. The Devils part, while more fun, was le leagues easier to play which is why in the end Johnny won.
TIPPING IS A DISEASE...|
14:00 Crap. Now you've given them ideas, John! Give it a month and we'll probably see a few dozen of them...  21:38 and a bit before. That's the point, though. Listen to anyone who raves about the greatness of capitalism and they'll tell you how it lowers prices. This is all of the stuff that they DON'T say, because that's not what they're trained to think about. They only know the talking points, not the context behind them. Yeah, capitalism lowers prices, but HOW does it lower prices? It doesn't cut out middle-men, but adds more, and those "more" have to be paid by someone. It doesn't use a cheaper version of the same quality ingredients. It doesn't require fewer workers doing the actual work, though it regularly tries to cut labor and increase workloads without increasing wages or other benefits.  When you get down to it, capitalism stiffs labor in favor of private profits. In cases like this, which we've seen in other cases like with Amazon, they sell low at a loss to drive competition out, corner the market so that there's no competition, and then raise prices higher than they were before. None of the other inputs of labor or material change. None of the middle men get cut out, but more are added (warehouses require maintenance and other costs, and workers have to manage their stock. Drivers move stuff between warehouses, producers and consumers).  The whole point is "line go up," which the people who rave about the greatness of capitalism also point to as "proof" that capitalism is great. Not because they like the fact that workers get stiffed ("workers who do those jobs aren't ambitious enough, are lazy, etc etc etc, but I'm a temporarily embarrassed millionaire who can use that business model if I just put in more effort"). Not because prices go down temporarily, or even over the long term (as inflation rises and wages do not, as prices rise and wages do not, etc). Not for any reason other than that those people who rave about capitalism think that they just need to put in more effort to be one of the people standing at the top of the pile of corpses counting stacks of cash. They are willing to put up with temporary "humiliation" and hardship if there's even the barest sliver of a chance that they'll "make their fortune" or whatever trope you want to use. They'll make any excuse, accept any talking point, and do everything they can to smash arguments against their hopes and dreams of being the scum that rises to the top, not through contextually appropriate facts or solid logic and reasoning, but through sheer CULT loyalty and desperation.  Capitalism creates desperation, even/especially in the people brainwashed to think that it's even "good." Capitalism does exactly one thing that's good: socialize production. Because what came before capitalism was feudalism, where individual artisans did small-scale work that didn't really meet the needs of society (but met the desires of the aristocracy somewhat). Consolidating and socilaizing labor increases productivity and innovation, but the consolidation of PROFITS does not, nor does having someone standing at the top acting like they're a "stable genius." Consolidating and socializing labor made other things possible for labor to start doing, like organize and fight for better conditions. But just because capitalism led to one thing being done better doesn't mean that people should desperately fight to perpetuate it. There is no "good" that capitalism does that other systems can't do more or better. Even statism is better, just not so much for the people who are desperate to stand at the top; for them it's worse, but for everyone else it's better because they're no longer desperate just to survive...depending on the starting conditions before statism. History doesn't start at the implementation of a system, but the people who rave about capitalism would have everyone believe otherwise.  Also depending on how other systems interact with it. Interventionism doesn't cease to exist and allow opposition to the established powers have a fair shot, but the people who rave about capitalism would have everyone believe otherwise, or somehow excuse with "well, they couldn't handle the competition," as though that means anything deeper than "I guess that small business couldn't compete with Walmart. That just means that small business was the worst system in history." Because that's what their arguments boil down to, except that in real life Walmart doesn't start cold wars that could end hundreds of millions of lives, or twist reality to make people believe that their competition eats babies, etc etc etc. The US, UK etc all do that and worse in the name of maintaining the status quo.
I’m sorry you can not tell me the burrito and chips I ordered that cost 50 dollars after fees is actually a good deal for me the customer.
You all should check out Hal Sparks...Hes fun and very informative!!
I did deliveries for these apps in my early 20s. Had a man get out of his house in a threatening manner asking why his food was late and where I had parked my car. I was genuinely scared because I was a skinny 20 something woman and this guy easily outweighed me, luckily his dog ran out and he got distracted. I was able to leave and Grubhub at least banned the guy from the app after I emailed them (at least I hoped they did).
"I'm not saying you shouldn't use these services" Well I am. How about buying some fucking groceries instead! You can even get them delivered by grocers who employ their own delivery people and pay them well with benefits and drive company vehicles!
I will never use these companies. Such a scam.
(Self-)organization is the answer. These "apps" are glorified callcenters. If restaurants and drivers stick together, they can come up with their own callcenter and push those leeches out of business. It worked before with courier services etc.
Grubhub is called Lieferando in Germany, and nobody knows its Grubhub. I just figured because of the exact same logo and how they equip their staff compared to german deliverers...
Sad but good for a laugh or two.
I leave an envelope with Cash tip for my driver's,also they have a nice selection of snacks and drinks to choose from... Stoner's Unite!
Not only are these standard operating procedures for all delivery apps, apps in general have strong armed themselves into the industries that they operate in. Uber, Lyft have also been found out  how they infiltrated many sectors
I wanted to suggest the next topic for you to look into is education systems post pandemic.
I don't order if I can't tip really well. I only use door dash and I live kind of far from any restaurants, at least one bridge and a 25 min drive through a forest to get to my place, crossing state lines usually to get to me from where I ordered (nearest instate places are even further) I signed up for that dashpass thing to save money on the long run but felt guilty that it might be effecting the delivery drivers on the backend of the order so even on top of the normal fees & long distance fee I try to drop like 30$ on mans for their time...
has anyone found the link to that add?
Yeah i use to DoorDash and one time i drove 30mins (while taking the tollway) to deliver food to this a**hole who complained his food took too long and didn’t tip anything even though he spent 80 bucks on food
I did this work for almost 3 years. It's dangerous, stressful, and poorly compensated. If you use these apps tip 50% ... or don't use them.
didn't skype just get rebranded as microsoft teams and is now used by a shitton of companies?
De Santis is putting a stop to the adding restaurants to these apps without a contract. It's a start but I hope they also address the worker protections.
I decided to quit using delivery apps when I was willing to pay $27 for a burger and fries. If you’re wondering, I’m in rehab, and I’ve been clean for over 7 months now.
Fuck tipping, pay your employees. Tips are meant for making an impression on someone, not "part of the deal".
There's no possible way the companies cannot be profitable unless the CEO is embezzling huge amounts of money.
How many shows come on every week and never disappoint? I think it’s just this one.
When john showed the 184M dollar horse, I am so brainwashed by the format I very briefly thought "john went and bought the horse"
For a second there I was afraid for HBO he was going to say he bought the horse 🤣
The backpack bit made me laugh reminded me of finding out the USN charged me for uniforms in boot 🤠
So you're telling me that me complaining,... no thats not right. Me knowing i'm paying a lot more for something I could get myself is still not actually profitable? I had no idea. I just mock ordered(didnt purchase) a sausage mc muffin meal and it took it from $7 and change to $14 and change. Thats double. Its baffling. I read the comments though and nobody here seems to complain about the price. I really just use it on special occasions where I literally say to myself, "Fkit, I dont feel like going back out".
I've never used grubhub and I never will.
Not everyone is being paid millions Oliver. When a burger on the menu says it costs $12 but by the time all the taxes and fees are done it’s over $30 and then you have to tip- $36 for a burger that is really only worth $6 but you figured you’d budge and spend the $12…  Let the companies go out of business. It’s a luxury not a necessity. Once you’re done eating that cold $36 burger you’re just going to shit it out a few hours later anyway- literally just shitting your money away.
Landlords are also leeches
A bunch of restaurants around here started their own delivery service during the pandemic. I use them once a week on my errand day.
This is legalized racketeering .
John missed a lot of points here, and was wrong on others... For example: Before these apps, at least in my town, you had the choice of 2 different pizza places who did deliveries, and nothing else. Now we have the choice of 100 places. Another thing, we have 2 services here in my town, foodora (owned by delivery hero) and Wolt (owned by doordash). Foodoras drivers are employees of Foodora, while Wolts drivers are independent. The employees at foodora are union organized. Also, it shold never be a requirement to tip, and I will never tip a worker before he has done any work. Delivery drivers because of this rarely see any tip from me. Btw... live Norway, not USA
I just got the craziest deja vu...
Restaurant owner here for UberEATS it order to reach TopEats status you have to reach certain metrics one of which is getting a certain amount of customer reviews every month which is completely out of our control
I remember when I found out that my local pizza place would no longer deliver to my address (apartment building) because one of their drivers had been mugged nearby, so they advised that I "just order on DoorDash" because obviously Dashers don't matter. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the pizza place cares about their drivers, but if my location is so dangerous, they should probably just tell me to come pick it up, instead of pushing the problem off to someone else.   That being said, I rely on Instacart. (I have moved since). I'm disabled, with one working eye, one working arm, and one working leg, so I can't drive and I also can't walk very far, even with my mobility aids, especially hauling groceries, so I need to get food delivered every two weeks or else I'm going to starve. Sometimes, they seem surprised when I give them a tip, and that's really sad.
I would like to add that twice, Uber Eats has canceled my order because they could not find a driver, and they do this AFTER charging me in me in  pending, teasing me with the dream that my Egg mcmuffin or spaghetti is on its way, ONLY lettimg me know an HOUR later the deal is over and they are refundijg my dough.
The executives at these companies are raking in $.  As did the early 'investors'. I think this is what the kids refer to as "end stage capitalism".
Do I agree with John Oliver? Yes. Am I going to stop using doordash? No. Because there is literally 0 food options at the hospital I work at other than a vending machine. So me an my co workers order usually every day just so we can get something to eat.
There's a simple solution to this "problem".  Get off your lazy behind and go pick up the food yourself!
Calling BS on these apps not being profitable. No chance in Hell that's true.
It's crazy how this show covers everything in any industry (churches, planes, WWE, divorce law, etc), but the cause of all their problems is the same thing: GREED.
You know Coal Minning used to be Gig work before unionization, they got paid for each ton of coal they dug. Seems like we are going backwards, gig work needs to be outlawed; these people are employees.
Oh it gets even worse John. Uber Eats has Ticketmaster levels of hidden charges. They also, will up charge the items you order, such as if you get groceries every item has a roughly 10-20% upcharge.   Example charges: 10-20% increase per item Service Charge (hidden in UI) Delivery Fee Tips  A simple $40 grocery order inflated to about $70 after tip.
It created so many jobs just in my city. Before covid, some drivers worked for all deliverers, because there where not enough drivers and buyers. Now, it does not pass a minute without them driving and cycling around.
man... the arguments are just bad, I'm sorry but this is BS. "omg delivery apps are evil for profit capitalist business. anyway listen to me siding with evil for profit capitalist business like restaurants IN USA where they don't even pay normal wages to their servers." ok, buddy. "omg this has to buy bicycle and phone holder and pay out of pocket in order to work for delivery ?" like in Usa ??? where like 99% of any workers for any company are expected to have 20k car with taxes and insurance and a phone holder paid out of pocket ? lol I don't have side in this conversation at all, it's just that arguments are so bad it's unimaginable. do better please
I have never used and will never use any of these apps. No uber, no lyft, no airbnb, no gurbhub, no doordash, none of it. I won'r ever work for any of these companies, and I won'e ever patronize them, because they are predatory, and if you use them or work for them in any capacity, you are the problem.
tipping culture is just toxic.
Never have I ever wasted my money on food delivery apps. And I don't have a license. I just walk there.
they should do an episode on Uber and Lyft and let people know how little they pay the drivers.
I deliver for Instacart and its awesome. No other job can I make $20 in 10 minutes or $100 in an hour anytime I want. But its not designed to be your main source of income. Its for people who just need extra cash, like college students. If you need stable income and health insurance then get a regular full time job.
You should not complain, this is what the US think is important, only shareholder value is relevant, the rest is not relevant and thus screwed. That is the American way. All else is socialist or communist. We know better. But as long as people put up with this and vote for the wrong parties it will not change.
Nah... no tips.  Tips are how these apps continue being able to explore people. Just like the service industry.  People, and workers, need to realize that collective power is greater than what any company or even government can do.
I just want someone to look at me the way John looks at horses
Thank you for u support John., I’m a uber driver here in NYC Black/SUV., and just so u know uber is taking ridiculous amounts of commissions 45 to 50 % from as., anytime is surging here in NYC those surges are not going to as., for example., went you see your price went up by let’s say ., a trip u normally pay 50$ and now it went up and the new price is 120$ ( a different of 70$ ) our fare is base on those 50$  initiation., what we get on those 70$ that u are paying is just 5 to 7$ and yes this is not an exaggeration ., this is on everyday think for example yesterday  ( 04/03/2024 ) lots of rain here in NYC ., uber was surging for as only 11$ ,. While people was paying more than double of an original fare.,( lift was the same ) we are getting hurt big time and no one is willing to help as ., ☹️☹️., hope someone in ur team get to read this .
ok so something happened?
I have never used the delivery service. I grew up with my parents always picking up food themselves. I know too much to trust people with my food like that.  People are disgusting.
I just try to pick up from the actual restaurant as often as I can. My city tried making its own food delivery app to compete with the big ones and they just could not make it work. Because of that a ton of restaurants here simply refuse (or try to) being a part of these apps. I've definitely had a restaurant personally call me to tell me that they were on an app they hadn't agreed to, and fixing that charge was not fun. If you can manage it, just pick it up. Be your own delivery and save the restaurant some grief.
guilt people into tipping instead of boycotting evil companies that refuse to pay their workers a living wage? cooooool sure. thanks i’ll make sure to whip out $35 for a small happy meal from mcdonalds
I am in NYC and live in a large apartment building. I look at Food Delivery drivers as essential workers. They face dangerous conditions just to bring my food directly to my door. I don't have to meet them in the lobby, they place it directly outside my door 24 stories up. I am continuously amazed and thankful.   They literally make my night or weekend and as a result, I build it into my monthly discretionary food budget and tip as much as possible (at least 30 or 40%) with every order. I will skimp on other aspects of my leisure to show appreciation to them since I am so damn thankful for what they do.
A doordash ad right under this video sure is a choice
Greedy corporate exploitation is why we need regulations. And why we should never elect shady Republicans who are completely against them.
That’s why in and out doesn’t do this.
America;: were doing everything wrong.... on purpose!
WATCH IT BEFORE THEY TAKE IT DOWN!
Its kinda sad how many people apparently watched this whole video and are commenting how they're not going to tip the drivers to punish the companies (?).
The companies saying they "didn't make any profit" doesn't mean what many thinks it means. Profit comes *after* all salaries and shareholder payments are accounted for. So them crying about not making a profit does *not* mean that their "leadership" did not make millions or billions of dollars. It only means that there's nothing left over for anyone else (like their workers and the restaurants, etc.).  They also hire a lot of cheap work overseas for customer service positions.
its crazy how funny this guy is              wow
I have never used grubhub/postmates/uber eats, whatever. I’m a busy person with 2 kids and a life. I’m just too cheap to pay someone else to deliver me food 😂
Perhaps it's time we started calling these food delivery apps "room service" and started treating the people who work hard to get that food to people that way properly with a real living and restrict the distance of delivery to one mile and then they can be converted to employees. Breaks my heart, man. This isn't capitalism; this is extreme capitalism (greed) coupled with consumer entitlement.
Maybe this is a european take by my part. But whatever is going on whith tiping in the US is ridiculous. Pay your staff. Tiping is an exceptional for the exceptional service, it should not be a recurrent theme.
Thought for sure John would have the guts to say it… if you are able, order direct where go pick up your food your damned self
The driver that took that slice of cake is just dummmb...
I work at a pizza place. We just throw a coupon in the box that the GrubHub guy can’t see. And then the next time the customer wants to order they have to call OUR number or they can’t use the coupon. That way we steal the customers back. 🎉🎉 😂
Driving your own car for money makes no financial sense. All these companies take major advantage of their employees.
As a restaurant takeout employee, we genuinely hate seeing 3PDs (3rd party deliveries) bc we dont make a single dime off of those orders. All the tips go to the driver (if any at all), but there's nothing going to the people actually packaging the food, ensuring every ticket is met correctly, getting all the extra bs people call to add on bc there was no way to add it on the app, etc.   We started doing our own deliveries with takeout people taking on the job in addition to everything else, but they abandoned that after like 6 months. funny thing is, they were still allowing 3PDs? so why would anyone go out of their way to order delivery through our website if they could just do it on DD/GH? if they'd just shut down 3PDs and exclusively delivered through the store, the restaurant itself and its employees would be making much more
so let me get this straight... you are telling me the whole system is broken and your solutions is that the costumer HAS TO TIP TO FIX IT? isn't that EXACTLY what the tech bros in the food delivery apps are counting on us to think and never actually fix anything?  I swear to god, I will die and I will never understand how Americans have been so brainwashed/gaslit about the whole tipping system, on the premise of a good service.
When tipping became not about the service but more about not having someone spit in your food..I'm done.
Funny how Ben's Chili Bowl made Grubhub's commercial when they needed some cash. They probably didn't even pay for any of those photos.
well that explains all the individual '''online orders''' where a driver shows up showing the delivery info anyway. the problem with this is our restaurant is required to put stickers on the delivery orders after an incident where one singular individual driver decided to sneak a snack. so if we dont know to put those stickers on because it appears as if the customer will be getting it [much like those open shakes], that driver and any others possible have the opportunity to snack again.
As someone who doesn't live in the US, the tipping culture seems diabolical. I, as a customer, should pay what the establishment asks from me. I shouldn't be ordered to or looked down upon if I don't tip. I want to tip to feel good and make someone else (who is getting paid enough to live) feel good too. when it becomes a demand nobody is happy. I sometimes wonder if all of the US stops tipping for a short while, then people would stop working for food business and the legislators would have to change their laws. Maybe, one day...
I've always thought the Devil won that fiddle battle. Now I feel vindicated.
Uber, McDonald's, and Starbucks all used to have a "price and convenience over quality" understanding with their customers. Slowly they they bumped up the prices while lowering convenience and quality.
The worst part about these delivery apps is that they attach themselves to businesses without their knowledge or consent. I ordered from a restaurant down the street and I paid $120 for the order through the app. Then after an hour of nothing, I went down there only to find out they not only never received the order, but they have NO affiliation with these apps, which of course means they never got paid.  So yeah GrubHub stole $120 from me.
One of the most important segments ever in this show 👏🏽 PLEASE do a follow up on 1) how all corporations are using this model to elude labor law 2) how corporations are using tipping culture as wages
If you know anything about fiddling then you know that John is completely wrong about The Devil Went Down to Georgia. What the Devil played was just flashy while what Johnny played was technically impressive & requires an incredible amount of skill
The drivers shouldn’t be like being a server. They should be paid by their work distance.
Free Market, now live with it.
As someone who loves food , I honestly don’t understand deliverery. You pay all this money for food, that’s then trapped in a box, steaming itself limp,  losing most of  its flavor,  texture, & appeal.    just make it yourself;  or , go and enjoy  it freshly prepared, hot,  and plated  as the cook intended?
Thank you! Yes! I have been saying for decades the Devil ab-so-lutely won that fiddle-off.
"Independent contractors" The PRC called, they need their red flags back for the military parade
It doesn’t get better than John Oliver. 👏👏
Jon Oliver making the same video as Drew Gooden
The devil sounds better to a nontrained ear. But Johnny shows way more skill if you k ow the fiddle.
Thought for sure John would have the guts to say it… if you are able, order direct and go pick up your food your damned self
I'm surprised you didn't mention the flip side of the issue and thats the horrible service driver provide and the total lack of professionalism. Orders that don't get picked up, or that sit around for an hour... I NEVER use any of these apps.
Turns out all those "disruptive" gig economy "innovators" were just, in the end, mostly there to roll back every hard-won victory workers have managed over the past 100 years or so.
Never used this shit in my life. Waste of money, ill strap the kids in and get food myself. Better yet make food at home. Heathier, cheaper, and less likely to contract a food born illness.
Watching this piece makes me angrily hungry. Or hungrily angry.
it is all fine and legal as long as the people choose to work under the conditions they are given. If things are unfair, don't do the work. Have some self-respect.
The cries of “what?!” that the audience members expressed after the DoorDash douche said “buying a gift or starting an orphanage” was exactly what my brain started doing as I heard it.
Delivery services becoming common has made life much better for people with disabilities that makes it hard to get out of the house. It's possible to pay those doing it enough to live on, like every other service provider our society needs. The billionaire CEOs can afford it. No excuses.
The orphanage tech disruption sounds like something Adam Neumann would do and SoftBank would fund
Once they consolidate ... restaurants ought to just go right back to the old model. "Sure, you could pay 30$ for a sandwich via grubhub ... or 15$ direct from us. Your call."  If enough people have that much of a brain, the platforms die lie the useless middlemen they are. This isn't facebook, they are not inventing a service or adding value ... therefor in a functioning market, they can never exist.
right now the crisis of restaurants is that regular people cant afford them. at least in the middle of europe
18:27 also doesn’t help that healthcare is messed up anyway.  Btw, as a millennial I’m still enjoying Harry Potter to the fullest.
Dude, you are cribbing from Brennan Lee Mulligan's (formerly CollegeHumor now Dropout) Skype bit.
I have an even better solution.  Never use any of the food delivery services, ever.  15-30 mins in my own car is worth avoiding the price spike + lack of care from stressed delivery drivers.  Pop on a podcast and chill.
There's some good episodes about venture capital poured into tech and start ups like these on the Better Offline pod
Knowing how shitty the working conditions are for german delivery apps, and feeling guilty for relying on them a lot, it's still a shock to see how much worse it always is in the US.  At least here, when I order through my delivery app of choice, I know the restaurant, usually have been there at least once in person, and know the prices are equivalent.
I've never used these, now I never will!
Surprised he did not touch on the customers who get their orders and then claim they don’t which results in the driver losing their job.
It wasn't mentioned either that the delivery driver that delivered that single piece of cake was probably only paid $2 total for doing so. And it probably took them an hour or more. The only saving grace is that since it was New York, they may have gotten paid more, but that only applies to New York and California. Everywhere else, they probably got $2 for an hour + of work and wear and tear on their vehicle.
Anyone who requires a living off tips is living beyond their means or made some bad choices in life to end up where they're at. Get a real job. Don't force the situation into your favor because of where you ended up.
That was a sick jab at Christians with the Devil/Easter joke 🤣🤣🤣  Next do one during Hannukah!
I refuse to order delivery unless the restaurant hires their own delivery drivers.
Dude, this is the same scam that all apps are running. You want to know the sad part? These delivery services aren't making profit!!
I did uber and uber eats and I know for a fact they are making money. I've seen the receipts and taken screenshots...
I always use my favourite food-spot's own website and delivery service to order food. I'd rather they receive all the money from my order than have some greedy corporation take a cut.
I'm watching this, waiting for my door dash order...
Saying grubhub is like a mafia protection racket..... oh like the american insurance industry? where car insurance is MANDATORY so people who dont have it are technically breaking the law. Car insurance, Home insurance, Pet insurance, Flood Insurance, Life insurance, health insurance, dental insurance etc etc etc. Better pay up JUST IN CASE YOU NEED IT! god forbid something bad were to happen....
I've heard of people who use these apps regularly, and I don't understand how they can afford it. By the time you add in service and delivery fees and the tip you can end up spending literally twice as much as the price of the food itself. I'd rather just order online and pick it up myself.  Also, no, "you have to tip" is not a solution. The fact that I have to tip *is the problem.* Service workers should just be paid a normal wage.
No. No tips.
Well, John Oliver closing out Easter by giving Credit to the Devil is new
There was a Chinese restaurant I loved to go to a few years back. Then Grubhub moved into town.     It became more difficult to find the restaurant's website online, where Grubhub became the top result when looking the restaurant up. A few weeks later, the restaurant's website was gone. I asked, and Grubhub had basically taken over their online orders.   Worst part is that even for carryout, Grubhub charged at least $1 more for every entree and appetizer. Before fees. A meal that cost $12 before now cost $15-16. Without even a delivery driver involved.
LOL this guy trying to act like he needed to spend 2500 to be riding a bike,  No wonder he works for nothing delivering food.
Yeah, id rather just call and pick up myself, like the good old days. Lol 😅
13:01 starting an orphanage?!?!
I did DD for one month a few years ago. That was enough.
I find it hard to believe we're getting money back , , me and my wife one day we ordered Taco Bell came out to like $60 or something like that through Uber eats.it's a little high for Taco Bell but all right 2 -3 weeks later be like hey, let's go to Taco Bell and pick it up It was 30 something dollars for the same stuff.
"Get a real job" is what a lot of people told me during my time as a driver and as long as society has that mindset nothing will change.
My favorite all time is “high as pterodactyl titties” lol
Remember that it's twice as dangerous to be a pizza delivery driver than it is to be a cop.
What is the difference in terrorists attempting to destroy democracy thru violent crimes, and corrupted government officials behaving as domestic terrorists? I'm asking because it seems that if the average citizen or foreigner behaved in the same way, they would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It seems potentially equally as damaging to allow the individuals we expect to defend us, to instead spread false information accusing innocent individuals of hanus acts that could encourage a civil war, as it would be for military attacks occuring on US soil
So much to address here, first you don’t really know how news sources either leave out or exaggerate information on a topic until you are in it in some way. I am a gig worker who does this full time. These stories leave out so much. One example is that I as a gig worker can work multiple apps at the same time, therefore staying busy as much as possible. Another is that as an independent contractor, you are treated as self employed, so that story about guy on the bike with the hospital bill can deduct that bill 100% from his tax liability. Which brings me to the main point, we are technically owners of our incomes, so we need to manage it better. Which means save for unexpected issues and “rainy days”. I make a good living doing this because I’ve successfully managed my time and income. There are tax advantages as well. I love John, I think he’s brilliant, but where he comes off as a corporate guy is when he promotes the fact that people want employee rights for this line of work. That’s not what’s needed. Keep in mind that companies will remove many from the platforms, we will be taxed on all of our money upfront all so we can get benefits? Why don’t we question the fact that we NEED insurance in the first place, we need it because just like student loans, medical professionals have discovered that if the consumer is not paying all of the bill, they can charge what ever they want. No one will tell you that. Sorry if I’m rambling but I am currently dashing. Need to go back out there.
I only rated a driver bad once because he dropped off my food at the wrong house, and when I called to ask where he dropped it, he got mad and hung up on me, insisting he didn't make a mistake. Luckily it was only one house over, despite my instructions clearly stating mine was the first house on the right when you get to my street.
This should of been titled the f@ck grubhub episode  And when will these ceos STOP TALKING!!! Lol thats what you have press secretaries for
Food delivery apps are proof Americans are lazy and have it too good. The economy is not that bad and you can't be that broke if you can have delivery fee and tip on top of food that has been marked up 100-200%. Cook at home, you will save hundreds of dollars a month.
Looked at the McDonald’s food.  $25 for two meals. Full charge $50 DoorDash.  BS
He's so right about skype, it was THE internet calling app back in the day and then Microsoft bought it... Then like google gave up and made a new app that's equally as trash.
John’s right, the devil’s part in devil went down to Georgia is the best part of the song by far
I stopped using them when I noticed that when I ordered on an app, the items would sometimes cost A LOT more than ordering from them directly, so why pay more for an item (now I know why the prices are higher), plus fees that customers also have to pay, no point.
OK, so now we will get a movie about a poor delivery guy facing floods and earthquakes to get food to people.
I’ve delivered for all 3 of the major apps and GrubHub was the only one where I went to a restaurant and was told they don’t do delivery, so I can definitely see how they were signing restaurants up without permission. I’m surprised there wasn’t a lawsuit about that.
If a business model requires that you pay your "employees" a wage that they cannot live on, then you shouldnt be in business.
I TOTALLY agree that the devil played the better chorus in The Devil Went Down to Georgia. The flat fifths and slide were superb compared to that tired hillbilly BS.  Also, the title implies that Georgia is below hell itself.
They aren't making profit, because of the salaries of upper management...
Oh shoot I didn’t realize Prop 22 wasn’t repelled yet
I know of a hell of a lot of pizza restaurants in the northeast that don’t use apps! If you have good food you don’t need the apps!
Anyone that watches those online financial audits will tell you that these apps have been horrible  for this generation not a subsidy.  "Can't" pay any other their bills, but 47% of their income goes to food delivery. 25 dollars multiple times a week to get their Chipotle delivered 😂😂😂
When you say, "We aren't profitable" while making 24 million a year, well...
A few months ago, I ordered food and was only tipping $15. In route, the driver got into a wreck. My heart broke because for a $15 tip this person was hustling in heavy traffic to get me my food and now has a new problem to worry about. My entire ticket was refunded included the tip. I could not leave a tip any longer because the ticket was canceled. It felt like I was enabling a system that just was not fair. It was not fair that the driver did not have their "employers" insurance to protect them during their job. It has made me rethink my use of delivery apps, and though I still use them- I don't as frequently as I once did.
So in order to compensate for an ineffective system, the customer has to pick up the slack by: 1. Giving 5 star ratings irrespective of quality of food or delivery. 2. Tip the drivers no matter how much they already paid in service fee and delivery fee. And,  3. Still feel guilty about using these apps. I think this is the first time I am taken aback by John's perspective and conclusion about an issue.
These companies just shouldn’t exist. You will never be able to make a sustainable business that is affordable to customers, restaurants, and drivers. The “last mile” problem has been well known in the world of distribution and shipping for a long time. It is incredibly expensive to get an individual item delivered to a single persons house.   The fact that it already costs an additional 50% to get food delivered to you while drivers are underpaid and the companies are losing money makes it blatantly obvious that this business model cannot work.   How anyone uses these apps regularly is beyond me. It’s so incredibly expensive that I can only justify it once or twice a year for a special occasion.
I remember about a year and a half ago I could easily make $100 in about four hours. I’ve been doing DoorDash this week 4 to 7 hours and only make about $50 but I have no other choice because I can’t find work anywhere else. It averages about $10-$11 a hour which isn’t anything now days
These companies work really hard to maintain the illusion that delivery workers are success stories following the "work hard to get ahead in life" model by spending a little extra time on the side to boost their income, as opposed to being desperate and exploited and probably making less than minimum wage after accounting for buying and maintaining their equipment.
This is why I pick up the food myself
Here’s the correct opinion in case you want it:  The Devil’s section is more interesting musically, but there is little to show off his mastery of the fiddle. In terms of fiddle playing, Johnny undoubtedly has the stronger section.
They were probably really sad, and all they could afford is a slice of cake...
Jesus Christ, that whole bit about having to dig through the pile of take out menus you’ve hoarded awakened memories long suppressed. 2003 was a simpler time, being 10 wasn’t so bad back then.
19:05 then you don’t accept the order!!! It’s that simple. All these drivers who are so easily manipulated into working for free don’t help the situation either.
These companies inserted themselves into an equation that was already solved: they're the solution to a problem that didn't exist. There was no need for them and they've ruined food delivery, and now everybody is paying more, and customer service is non-existent.
Sometimes the screw you by putting a decent tip so you accept the order and then change it to no tip after you deliver.
I worked DD in college, and I think i totaled around 500 deliveries. I made about 20 an hour and the work was wayy easier than busting my ass in a fast food restaurant or working at amazon and it paid more ( I have done both). Doing it full time would definitely blow tho.
I started doing DoorDash deliveries as side gig since my main source of income is working for my father as granite fabricator. I never realized how bad the food delivery business is that bad
This doesn't even bring up the fact that the websites sell your info to third parties.
human squidward is looking well
Except the prices are so high on these apps that a 30$ order turns into a 90$ order
I have never felt more heard without realizing it after hearing John Oliver subtly mention how the Devil's fiddle solo in Devil Went Down to Georgia is actually better than Johnny's solo.
You listed all of the reasons why I don't use food delivery apps. I am able bodied and have a vehicle so there is truly no reason (other than laziness) why I should not just go the  restaurant myself for a take out order.
How many people just had to hear ," The Devil, went down to Georgia " right after this . Thank you John !
Food delivery companies are middleman parasites who drive up consumer prices. I order only from restaurants who staff their own drivers. When I delivered pizzas, the drivers were not standing around doing nothing: drivers were folding pizza boxes, cleaning the dining room, taking out trash, stocking, food prep, cleaning bathrooms, handing out flyers, ringing up customers and stocking the food prep tables for cooks. We got hourly wage, tios and commissions. We were NOT independent contractors! This business model was far more superior to the food App racket we have now!
The one time I was forced to use one of these services, without my knowledge by the way, the pizza I ordered was 20 minutes late and was left in the snow with no knock or doorbell.
Ordered from one of these once, don’t remember which one, but doesn’t matter. Food took forever, showed up cold and soggy. Haven’t ordered from them since and never will.
As a switch im dissapointed there was no menu for me we switches gotta eat
Wtf. This guy basically has to work with a broken foot😮? That is insane.... oh I forgot, this is America....   Call me socialist or even communist, but I prefer a system where you don't have to work while you recover from a severe injurie and get paid during that time.  In that regard (and other "socialist" stuff), the US of A are a third world country or less....
I do not use food delivery apps
I stopped using delivery apps a year ago. I order directly from the restaurant and go pick it up myself.
Biking DC!!!
Ok, I think I'm more up on queer references than the average straight guy (low bar). But can someone please explain the BDSM ad to me?
18:44 BS! BS bro. Tips are 75% of my income! 1/2-1/3 are you joking?? If tips were only half my income I would only get paid $4 per delivery. These companies pay $2 per delivery. Essentially they pay us nothing and we really get paid in tips. If tips are only half of your income you’re probably not even breaking even. BS stats like this really tick me off because it makes it seem like these companies actually pay us and they don’t. It is not possible to survive doing this job if you’re only making 50% from tips. On an average day when I go out and make $200, maybe 50 of that is from the companies. They barely pay enough to cover gas.
Former Senior Dasher trying to supplement Social Security - here’s reality- adding miles on my 2007 Taurus (limited insurance) increasing likelihood of accidents rushing around. Delivering to McMansions with no handrails increased likelihood of personal injury (Medicare Ins). If I’m injured will I be able to afford a lawyer to sue homeowner or negligent landlord? Why have  handrails become obsolete on front porches? Drive 10 miles for $2 tip. It became providing a public service as a non-profit & then pay taxes. It was a scam!
Car jackers aren't after the food, they're not called food jackers after all.
12;11/26:11 I don't think anyone expected that
Deleting Grubhub forever !
The restaurants can’t afford to hire these drivers or pay their workers a higher wage. These delivery companies can’t afford to pay a higher wage to the drivers.  They both benefit from the NRA and why groceries are so expensive and why we have food deserts. The absolute horror of policies and political problems we have in this country trickle down to how we eat and receive this food. It’s a mess and it just gets worse and worse. No matter who’s president we all know as citizens that the rich watch us complain about how we’ll get are fast food or are simple groceries. We are just watching large corporations buy up all these food services and grocery stores. They lobby in congress while we wait for our cold food to get some serotonin when we get a break from a job we hate and doesn’t pay enough from some citizen that just wants to pay their bills because there first job doesn’t pay enough. We as whole are feeling all the same things no matter if you’re the delivery person or the recipient of said food. We are all screwed to sit back watch are lives pass before us and wonder why is it this way? Why don’t we have all that we want? Why as the richest nation in the world are we still suffering from starvation, low wages, horrible healthcare, criminal cost of living?  It would be nice in my lifetime I click on YouTube and there just be videos of citizens and people just not suffering.  If you’re struggling like the majority in this country, I just want to say sorry that we are failing as a society to come together and just be better for all of us. Maybe one day we will, I’m just sorry that day isn’t today. Stay strong and know that your doing your best and right now that is all you can do, don’t worry about what isn’t in your control and just keep being positive no matter what you see or hear.  You matter and remember that people are horrible but that one person that said thank you and I appreciate you makes all the difference. Stay strong. Never give up. Never surrender. ✨🖤✨🤓
This is so fucking depressing.
Ive been delivering with all the major apps( and a few obscure ones as well) for several years. This is how little the pay is for each app. Doordash= $2. UberEats $1.50 - $2. Instacart= $5. this is the low end on most apps. Lots of customers don't realize this and leave no tip or $1 tip and wonder where there food is. Low or no tip can mean no trip. Not fair to the customer or delivery person. I also owed over $5000 in state and federal taxes last year but reduced it to $500 with mileage and other car expenses( keep those reciepts!!). In the end, I think all these delivery apps are just interested in using drivers to collect data for when we are replaced by drones and robots who will take EVERY delivery at no cost.
Surprised this didn't touch on the phone number grift, where platforms like Yelp prioritize GrubHub's number for a place when someone searches for that restaurant's contact info. The number forwards to the restaurant's actual number, so the customer thinks they're calling directly and the restaurant is taking the order and delivering themselves, but GrubHub still gets to hit them with a 15-20% "marketing fee."
Around 2015 the pay on postmates in San Diego was good enough that I was able to make enough by doing 3 long days over a weekend to cover all my expenses. Apartment rent, groceries & everything. Even covered the cost of renting a car on turo for 3 days since I didn't have my own car.   Now despite demand for delivery apps exploding, the pay has dropped to barely minimum wage, often far below minimum wage
I already dont use food delivery apps because the fees are insane. $25 for two mcdonalds cheeseburgers? Nah, I'm good. I can't imagine what prices will be like when they conglomerate.
I like Jon Stewart but I think his expectations are a little bit high. Working with an injury is often a requirement in America. We live paycheck to paycheck. I suppose his show is just for information sake but his other episodes normally show things of much greater importance. I suppose people who have decent lives never really understand. It's nice when they show they care. When a privileged person acts superior I see them as weak and ignorant. I always think in my mind that trading places would be akin to throwing that person in prison and sending me to heaven.
This is insane. I knew the drivers were getting a raw deal but I had no idea the restaurants were getting shafted too. This is simply unfair.
The joke about skype is even funnier cause they sold to Microsoft which used the technology to make... Teams.  yes, that's right, Teams "is skype".
Do you have to tip though? I have heard in the past that DD and other apps have a system where tipping is sometimes just covering what DD would be obligated to pay otherwise. Also, what's tipping etiquette? Do you tip after fees, or based on the subtotal? Does it make sense to tip a flat amount vs a %? (Example: A high end restaurant next to McDonalds - an order from either place is packaged similarly and easy to get to but one costs 10x as much - should the amount being tipped to the driver also scale with that 10x amount?) Does the restaurant staff get any portion of tips?  So many questions and nuances that I wish were covered here.
Rip to the intern who accidentally posted the entire episode on Monday. You will be remembered as a hero 🙏
"You have to tip" is a wild statement.
So, America actually isn't the land of opportunity for most people; but it is for greedy people.
Telling people to just give 5 stars is a little ridiculous, too many times I've watched food take a cross city tour and arrive maybe an hour later. I tip up front assuming they will do a good job but that is not always the case. It is way easier to just go get it yourself.
John is an idiot, the solution is not more tipping. The solution is not tipping at all, the employer pays the wage
The American system of using tips as a mandatory source of income is stupid. Make better laws!
Tried one of those grubhub delivery services once, they charged 2-3 times the amount it cost just to go get the crap yourself.  Not to mention the very small chance of missing items.  Overall, those services are a complete pass for me.
I worked shipt for a few years during grad school and at the first half of covid. It was a decent way to make money for rent when I was already working a full time job for free.   It was good for awhile but demand has dried up and I fell out of their algorithm
There was one time I brought a single Pepsi fountain drink 10 miles to a house in a different neighborhood right before the Burger King closed. Why you would pay 12 dollars for a 24 oz fountain drink when the bottle is 2 dollars down the street, I'll never know.
I’m all for making sure employees get paid…… but the fucking company needs to do it.  We are just making tipping culture in America worse and now John is here telling people to do it.  These companies need to pay their employees a living fucking wage!
after YEARS of watching this show I finally agree with John 100% The DEVIL GETS DOWN and Johny is just ok.
How are delivery divers employees and independent contractors at the same time? Those are 2 different things? Can they unionize? They should.
You got a thumbs up for the random "Devil Went Down to Georgia" devil's advocate stance.
The way ubereats handles threats to drivers safety is an absolute joke. When something happens they direct you to 911, but if the police need input and collaboration from uber, they're useless.  I was driving for ubereats and someone obviously tweaking out  who'd ordered a pizza tried to get me into the back of a van outside of an airbnb in a vacation cabin community, probably with the intent of carjacking. I escaped the situation and went straight to the community's security, but it turned out ubereats had erased my access to the house's address because it was only available for a certain amount of time after the delivery. Ubereats customer service for emergencies was a call center where the employees seemed to have zero training and eventually after bouncing between several employees to try to get this address to give to community security and the police, someone told me that I would have to explain to the police that they would have to go directly through a seperate line or something and submit a request form for the information that may take weeks to process. It was nighttime and I didn't know my way around this wooded community where a lot of the houses look really similar, so I couldn't have identified the house again for sure. I explained the situation to the police, but the process of trying to get any information from uber about the person who ordered that pizza seemed so slow and arduous that it was unlikely anything would come of it.  It still haunts me to this day because I feel like this was a setup (probably for carjacking) and I had to live with the possibility that they would eventually get someone into that van, and if ubereats invested in actually training people to collaborate with police quickly and effectively, they may have caught them that night.
Several of my Uber drivers said that Uber used to take about 25-30% and now it is more like 50%.  We had a 20 minute drive in D.C. that was roughly $42, and the driver would get about $17 of that.
"You gotta fu*king tip!"    No!  I don't!   Corporations gotta fu*king PAY THEIR SLAVES!   I expect more from you John.
Restaurants should triple the prices for their goods when ordered through predatory apps. Consumers will find another app if they like the restaurant enough.
Corporations- taking something simple, and making it complicated. Now tech companies making it even worse
In the last two years all the fast food chains in our area have practically abandoned the front counter because they’re always overwhelmed trying to fill app orders in the back.  If you want to walk in and pay cash to a human and not deal with a kiosk and a credit card (which a great many people still do - especially older individuals) you’re SOL if you want to eat fast food in our city.
I think that US tipping culture is something that shouldn't even be supported, if you can not pay your workers a fair wage then your business model is flawed and should probably not exist. Counting on socially or morally forced customer donations that pay your workers while you sack in the guaranteed part of the payment is not right at all.
No affordable healthcare and tipping culture makes the US a toxic place to live. Then they add guns. It seems awful.
Never used those apps I allways walk to the next restaurant if I want something to eat. But I also life in Germany and here we can walk. In the USA something like this is impossible.
And this is exactly why i make it a point, even as an introvert to go to the place of business. I just dont trust these delivery companies.
"at the bottom" 🤣
Grubhub and Postmates are NOTORIOUS for doing that, i know this b/c i used to deliver for them during the pandemic........ I used to make $250 a day working 6 hours, thats after gas & food for me. My best day was making over $600 from postmates as it was more b/c i had tips coming to me later on. Postmates delivers ANYTHING as i was delivering stuff from bestbuy/AppleStore/Walmart & driving 10-20 miles to the client. Sometimes, if the client was NOT physically there, i had to return the electronic product to apple and get paid the fee.
Wow, spending $168 Million  ( Prop 22 ) on wanting special privleges for  business. 😮
I don't think I've ever disagreed with John more than on this topic. He lost me when he says the customers are the ones who have it good right now @21:30, which is total BS. If you were to walk into a place and do pickup, the same $15 worth of food is $30 on the apps with all the fees before you even tip. The markup is ridiculous, customers are getting shafted along with everyone else.
these food apps basically created a solution to a problem that never existed. they essentially unnecessary middlemen that really add no value but hold businesses hostages by creating an environment where they are forced to use their services or lose out to competition. if every restaurant boycotted these apps, things can go back to how it used to be when you can easily just order directly through the restaurants, costing them less money to prepare the food and ultimately being able to pass that savings onto the consumer.
This is the first video where I'm honestly not surprised by a single thing I've heard
I’m not in love with the gig economy, but John’s trying to equate what used to be a part-time job with a career.  Delivery drivers for restaurants didn’t get paid well, have health insurance or work without tips. Gig work should be part time work. This isn’t a replacement for a career.
I have never used these Apps, none of them. These apps have turned Americans into delivery drivers which is modern day slavery with a phone.
Wouldn’t it have been great if, during the pandemic, people had invested in some good cookware and cookbooks and practiced their skills in the kitchen instead of contributing to the development of yet another parasitic, unsustainable business?
The apps are fleecing the delivery people as well.
Nothing about this makes any sense. Customers are paying almost double for food that may or may not be good, restaurants are suffering, the delivery workers are suffering, heck, even the apps are suffering, and for what? To spare you from having to cook a meal at home? This isn't convenience, it's societal decay. If the weather sucks or it's a holiday, I won't even order a pizza or something from Amazon because I don't want to be that guy who forces someone else to be out there on my behalf.
We'd rather hear the truth Thank you John Oliver
Give us an episode on the history of UAPs already, Master John.
Pizza driver was freaking out cause I gave him a $9 tip. I was like meh soz i couldnt do more.
the entire tipping culture needs to be banned period
Am I the only one that got an ads? Last Week Tonight used to be ad free.
on these apps, you can always not accept the job if the payout is too low
I've never once used a food delivery app, those don't exist out here. That's city people problems. BTW every time I hear how many jobs have been created in the past few years I wonder what percentage of them are these gigs.
Yet another example of how utterly superfluous food delivery apps are. I'd never even heard of Postmates until a few weeks ago when I got a spam email from them and thought, not just understandably but rightfully, that it was some kind of mail app which I didn't need and never asked for, yet for some completely inexplicable reason it turned out to be a food delivery app. Not only are the app and the service dumb, but so is the name, branding and marketing.
You’re too late this time, John Oliver! I *already* hated food delivery app companies.
Fact, my night-driving on door dash nearly got me ran over by a train.
Grrrrrrrr I LOVE IT when they go after the absolutely trash tech industry and it's slimey charlatan liars
Watching this while I’m door dashing lmao rip me
But John. You're famous too. Now, you known; people don't just , go away and leave best alone. Do they? So, what is the perspective date of this bran surgery which our John Oliver has chosen to forego? Anytime before the Apocalypse and after Armageddon. Basically, right after the Global Tristate Agenda gets "Turned on."
I have been doing ubereats and doordash for the last two years. It started out as just getting away from a toxic company, but now it's the only job I can actually rely on as a out trans person in one of those states actively trying to have us killed. Those tips are incredibly important.
If I pay for something, I don’t want to pay twice. Too much reliability on kindness .. the real problem is the business agreement between the goods & service  If a person needs X amount in a day then they should be making Y amount we hour. If it takes Z amount of time on average to deliver because of A, B, etc. = w.e , I thought they’re using algorithms so let the calculator figure it out   App companies should downsize and open up some of those backend operations so the restaurants can handle more of the issues
😂😂😂 only in USA :D in Europe we have Bolt food, Bolt takes 25% from the restaurant + delivery fee (1.5-2 eur) and everybody is making profit
It’s funny that you think millennials or anyone using these apps are getting something for free, sure doesn’t feel like that with all of the added fees.
My mother owns a restaurant. We have four tablets. FOUR TABLETS IN THE FRONT DESK. You need a single tablet AND PRINTER for every app that exists. There's like 1k dollars worth of equipment in the front desk JUST FOR FOOD APPS. And don't get me started on Uber eats.
Wages of American workers are subsidized by the tips of other workers. The entire class is expected to pay a tax to itself on goods and services because none of these jobs will pay anyone a living wage. Some workers are paid $2.13/hr solely because it is expected that people will tip them enough for that not to be a heinously low wage!
You just hovered over it, but the fees on the app are also incredibly high, usually for me 20% of the bill. They already overcharge for the fees dramatically on top of all the bs thats addressed. These delivery apps should be regulated they are so gross fiscally. I miss when takeout pizza meant just keeping a tip for the driver
As soon as drivers take on one company at a time & boycott them till they change their DISGUSTING abuse of the drivers, it won't change.  All would take is it happening to one company as an example of what will happen to the others. I can see where possibly a private delivery system be started especially in smaller towns.
Pride is disgusting.
8:49 One time a small place I worked (5 employees) got a bad review from a DoorDasher bc the opening times were wrong on DoorDash (we didn’t sign up for DoorDash) and he couldn’t fill someone’s order.
Wait. So the only upside to this story is "you aren't exploited as much as we are going to do in the future"? Thanks.
OMG, I cannot believe I just said that. But, it's true; you can't believe everything you read.  John just doesn't like my choice of doctors. Alright, John; fine. Now I must choose another subject.
Should Massachusetts be allowed to vote on that. Yes.   Will I vote against stupidity Yes.
lol the customer is the only one getting "profit"?  Caleb Hammers financial audit has proved to me that food delivery apps keep people in debt and can easily spend more than 700$ a month on food delivery. Now i'm pretty sure that all food delivery apps are a net bad for everyone but we still keep it around cuz of stock ownership
I've gone the other direction. Even our local pizza place wants $10+tip for delivery on a $25 order. If I order food, I still go pick it up. I'm not paying 40%+ for food that's already too expensive just because I don't want to drive.
Postmates is owned by Uber. UberEats and Postmates are the same company.
Is the bottom friendly ad read by bottom friendly food content creator @ bottomsdigest ?
If spending $20 on a delivery that would cost me $11 in store is a "millennial subsidy", then I think I hate everything.
If you can't tip, you can't afford the food delivery. Sorry not sorry. I'm sick of the excuses. If you don't tip, you're an asshole, full stop.
11:50 I never could understand how Johnny was the victor, here. No way "Granny does your dog bite, no chil' no," beats out the Devil's song. Like you said, the creepy, dissonant fiddle sounded like the Devil was ushering in wails from damned souls, all backed by demonic power chords on a distorted guitar. Correct, Mr. Devil, I did not know you were such an accomplished avant-garde fiddle player. You deserve that golden fiddle handed to you atop that hickory stump like a gold medal at the Olympics.
Microsoft happened to Skype
Boo hoo. Dont be a delivery driver. Becoming a delivery driver is not a career choice. These companies thrive by exploiting humans, and will continue doing so as long as humans keep letting them.   Theres thousands of crappy jobs enslaving people into a bare subsistence, its called Capitalism and technology just gave Capitalism a huge boost of Adrenaline.
I made good money working for doordash for two years. But they as time went on they hired too many people and it was no longer sustainable. If i cant make 15-20$ an hour. Im not doing it. Same for those thst dont tip
Not having healthcare as a right creates such a modern dystopia. Sort it out USA.
Technofeudalism - we must all unionize ✊
America is a fucking dystopia.
I quit the delivery apps and now just order from restaurants if they have a website or big enough for their own app.
“If you see a flash flood warning and immediately open the grubhub app, you don’t go to Heaven. That was the test.”
This was always a bad idea. Paying 30%+ more for food through these apps has never been a good deal for anyone. Also delivery food sucks in general because it sits around for too long. I always call the restaurant and pick it up myself if I can manage. I hope all of these apps go down in flames and it sounds like they are. Restaurants need to just hire their own delivery drivers if it's within their budget.
As an outsider looking in, i keep wondering: Will the USA ever pass any kind of law that stops companies from paying their workers so poorly they have to rely on the charity (or, in most cases, the guilt) of their customers?
👍🏾
*sees the video thumbnail* 'Oh no...now will I have to leave the house to get food??? My pandemic grown agoraphobia is too strong.'
Every one just go to these apps and give them 1 star and comment help the delivery workers or say anything that help those that least thing that we can do like this post to be top comment
I do my best never to use uber eats or door dash. I try call restaurant or go to there website or very least do pick up but some places only use the apps which can make it harder. So in the end I just buy frozen pizza and just pass on delivery period.
Sounds like a class action lawsuit is a possibility?
In the netherlands, deliveroo workers sued deliveroo for requiring them to become independent contractors, which takes them away from a lot of worker's rights we have here. The judge decided that deliveroo is not allowed to do this, and then they just quit doing business in the entire country lmao
I don't use these sites and I don't tip.  We need to do away with this stupid bullshit.  We need to pay workers appropriately.
Watch what is happening in Brazil where the government wants to impose work registration for delivery people with all the benefits and the workers ARE PROTESTING SAYING THEY DONT WANT THAT!
Yeah, to someone in rural germany this sounds very dystopian. Food delivery should just be added cost to the actual price of the meal, and any worker should have base healthcare. I really don't get the conservative view of "they don't deserve to be treated as a human" if someone can for whatever reason not earn enough money to survive that hellhole.
Only customer is getting benifited(even though the benefits are useless and making us lazy) by food delivery apps
Be good to your dashers...
Just a glaze
Makes me want to order grubhub from across town during a blizzard now.
Door Dash and other similar delivery apps are 100% scams. They blame the restaurant, the restaurant blames the driver/app and in the end you are the loser.  And those delivery companies? They run the same tipping scam as restaurants do. YOU have to pay their price and YOU have to pay their employees because they aren't doing it. Pit the customer against the employee nonsense continues.  So to John and the audience that booed that no tip order for the cake... Don't be part of the problem people. They are SCAMS. They want you to pay their price (those CEOs aren't broke despite their claim that the companies aren't profitable) AND pay their employees for them. Resist this nonsense. THEY should pay THEIR employees.
I’m still fuming that over half of California got duped by prop 22
Not using these services is not the answer. People that work these gigs do it because they have to in order to make ends meet. It is a good service and is needed, but the corporations need to be held to a higher standard caring for their drivers.
❤😂
I have not rated a delivery worker well,aybe once or twice. Gor things like literately giving up on delivering an order, cause THEY couldn't find my house when hundreds  others have. Or for things like damaging the food and opening a bag... Other than that. Nope
Paying 15 to $20 for 3 badic tacos from Taco Bell does not exactly feel like a millenial win.😂
I’m still waiting for anyone to bring attention to the poor delivery drivers who’s pay has been cut dramatically over the last few years and it was already a joke to begin with. At this point we’re getting paid less than $2 per delivery. Over the years these companies have been pushing more of the responsibility for paying drivers onto the customers in the form of a tip. Uber eats used to pay a dollar per mile and generally $5-15. With a tip on top it was good. Now basically every order is paying $2. But no one ever seems to care about drivers. It’s always all about the restaurants.
And 5-star reviews have been corrupted. I should be able to give a worker 3* and that mean, meh, good enough. 4* should mean as expected. 5* should not mean, meh, good enough
17:01 Just because you're under a flash flood warning, it sometimes doesn't mean anything. College Station, TX was often under flash flood warnings for the Brazos River near Normange. College Station and Normange are nowhere near each other. So in that case, order on, it's a false alarm.
To hear "You have to tip" in a British accent seems just so alien to me.  My roommate orders delivery every day. Every day. I only see him in the kitchen to brew coffee or reheat his delivery leftovers. I don't know how he is able to afford it. Maybe he can afford it because he lives with roommates.
Former Dominos driver here, it doesnt matter HOW much money your driver makes per hour- if someone is bringing food to your doorstep and you dont tip them, youre a scum bag. If you dont want to tip, go drive your car and pick up the food yourself. Simple as that.
everything you just said in this video... is Illegal in every other country, except USA. 3rd world country.
I don't use the delivery services. I order from restaurants that have their own delivery workers and I tip well.
If DD is losing money they need to fire everyone. They make nearly half of every resteraunts income and have a shit app and don’t pay support more than a quarter an hour based on the service they provide
Delivery apps also tack on high fees and then the delivery driver also needs to be tipped.  I live in an area where rent on an average 1 br. is 3k/month and can't afford to pay apps and then tip the delivery driver..so I do not use them. I am a performer and unless we make 30k  from out chosen profession (not including side gigs, we do not have benefits either and we have suffered since the pandemic.  Ironically many performers work for Uber, GrubHub, etc.)
Chinese food does taste better in a snow storm....just saying
As a disabled person, I gotta say, uber can make my life a ton easier. It's just expensive lol.
Your pot voice is terrible brah😅
Skype became Teams but the joke still hits. Hahaha
This is the end stage of neoliberal capitalism.
If you need more money but have no skills, just do what George Santos did, run for political office as a MAGA.
There’s a reason I don’t order food delivery…
Murica starts to feel like the old school Roman empire... i wonder who will take over after it collapses.
The customer gets food delivered at a worse quality, and somehow part of the order is ALWAYS messed up. Without fail
If you can't afford to provide a decent tip (at LEAST 1 dollar per mile) then simply don't use the apps. They are very much premium services that the average person should not and cannot afford.  No, it shouldn't be like this, BUT IT IS. Sure, we'd like it to be different, but until that happens, TIP YOUR DRIVERS.  If you can't tip, simply don't order, you can't afford this. It's no different than going out to eat at a restaurant. Think of delivery drivers as your own personal waiter who delivers RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR. If you can tip a waiter to deliver food to your table, you can tip a delivery driver  too. If you can't do either, DON'T USE THE SERVICE.
Thing is, youre not "getting money back" from the companies. Youre spending money. Its the same as if you bought something you dont need or really want just because it was 30% off.
Screw that have to tip crap! Forcing end users to compensate for companies screwing their "workers"? Making you an enabler for the corporate greed.   STOP ! ! ! proactively funding corporate destruction of the working class!   Even if it means you have to personally suffer through not getting a slice of cake delivered today!
The low base pay (only $2-$4 for most), plus the amount of work put into them, has led to something interesting.  A lot of drivers use Google Maps to navigate. There’s also a “label” function for each address- you can go through your history or use the labels as you go.  So now, many drivers will, after each delivery, use the “label” function to note the address and how the delivery went. Some people share this information with others, if a customer is especially creepy or cheap, or if the address is difficult to deliver to.  It sucks that people who genuinely can’t afford to tip much, or need help with a lot of heavy items, can get screwed by this sort of labeling system. But having delivered off and on before and during the pandemic, I can say that using labels in this way lets me not waste time on orders that are not worth it financially. It sucks, but about 60-65% of the income comes from tips. If I took orders that historically didn’t tip, I wouldn’t make it.  The worst is “tip baiting,” or putting down a large initial tip to get someone to take your order and do it well, then taking away all or most of what you expect to make. Of course, if items are out of stock or someone makes a mistake, by all means feel free to reduce the tip- but not in that callous and deliberate way.
Gotta keep that bussy clean. Thanks Postmates.
Two things: the devil uses a band, which is cheating. Also while the devils song is flashier it is super easy to play, meanwhile Johnny has the technical skill and plays his piece like an actual fiddle. In my mind that kind of masterful technique and references to good music is way better than something flashy.
Uh, if you’re making a minimum wage, I’m not tipping you. That is the whole point. You want me to pay $30 for a sandwich that costs $10 JUST to be able to pay your mandated wage AND still tip you?   Have not tipped once since these wages went into effect in NYC and won’t again - the same way I don’t tip my bus driver. You make a living wage now if your claim is that this is your FT job. If it’s not your FT job and just a side hustle, then you earn what you earn and my tips aren’t needed to provide your income. Can’t have it both ways. Either this system needs to end altogether and let all of these delivery people go and try to find other employment, or deal with what you make until you are ready to find something else that gives you the pay and benefits you want.
I can think of more important stories for John to take on. Why not just get in your vehicle and drive to the restaurant? I can see this in a city like New York, where you might not have a car, but even then you might want to cook for yourself, especially if these delivered meals are so expensive.
I never try to order delivery anymore specifically because the additional fees have gotten so expensive. I acknowledge I am lucky to be living in a city where I just walk anywhere if I'm hungry, but that runs the risk of getting sick from breathing in a strangers' breath, or getting caught in a road accident. The new ways apps have structured the food delivery movement, like many other work spaces, was to the detriment of the worker.
I used uber eats a ton during the pandemic and when i had covid. But I quit when i read about this stuff. It's been 3 years since ive ordered delivery.
That IPO punchline was solid and should have landed harder
It is very sad to me, that you say, that the consumer must tip. As a european I am happy we have a culture, where a worker gets paid a half decent salary from the company their working for, otherwise can find a different, good enough paid job or the legislator will help. But putting the responsibility on the customer, to me sounds like the Oil lobby inventing the carbon footprint. I has truth in it and it, but it is not even half of the proper solution
and lets not ignore that Uber was the originla warning on this   these com,panies can be " cheap" right now because they are trying ot shove the competition out, but once that happens they will be free to spike prices as they see fit.
Dd didn’t compensate a person that got shot by a customer that the week prior they asked to never be sent to and had receipts for it. Dd said, “we take that very seriously, are you able to finish delivery?” Mind you they are bleeding out… they are refusing to even give full pay, that’s how bold they are.
At my last job in San Francisco, I only used Door Dash, Postmates, etc., because I was at work. I refuse to tip on the platform because I don't know if the money is going to go to the restaurant, the delivery company, or the delivery person. I always make a point to give my tips to the delivery people in cash. These platforms are exploitative, and it makes me angrier that fellow Californians voted Yes on Prop 22 in California.
I take exception to the phrase "keep costs low for consumers." 😏 $50 for fast food for two doesn't seem like a deal, to me. It's still cheaper to order a pizza from Pizza Hut's own drivers than it is to use any of these apps.
I live in the middle of a corn field. I've never gotten to use a delivery app...
I ran a multi-restaurant food delivery business when Nextels were around. 15-30% commission was pretty standard. I had a team of telephone operators, dispatchers and drivers to pay. These restaurants were gaining more business and a service without hiring additional staff or having to deal with the challenges of delivery. The only additional cost to them was takeout containers. Long story short, there isnt much profit in this business.
When I was in college, in the mid-70's, I drove for a private car service. We were often called to deliver food. However, the transaction was much more straight-forward. The customer called the restaurant, ordered and paid for the food. We picked it up and delivered it, and got paid just as if we were transporting people. There were no hidden fees. We didn't charge the restaurant anything.
Oh wait were all poor...So now instead of just going and getting our food we pay a premium to get somebody to deliver it to our door. After all take out food is so much healthier and cheaper than making at home....right...Oh yeah and everyone's taking out college loans but have the money for take-out.
Thank you for educating people about the atrocities of these gig apps. I've been delivering for Instacart for 3 years, the rating system is extremely unfair and the pay is criminal. The only reason any order is worthwhile is if the tip is over $10 and less than 5 miles.
Soon it will just be drones doing the deliveries.
totally blows, that's why I'll never do the gaga work model that's currently in action. I hear from people who delivery they constantly are taking long runs w/ very little payout. No thanks, seems working fast food w/ a limited schedule is better. YOU TELL that side hustle gig you can only work X times when you get hired. Lots of places are in desperate need and will hire from what I feel.
Any convenience is a sacrifice of freedom. However, I didn't know that these apps also charged restaurants, I thought it was all on the customer.
This feels like 4 years too late? Consolidation happened years ago. Prices were jacked up years ago already. I don't use these apps anymore and neither should you. At least not regularly. Once in a while it's fine. That's the only way it'll hurt their bottom line
Tipping shouldn’t exist. That worker needs money. Include that money in the cost of the service.   Tipping doesn’t exist everywhere. It has only really existed in the US for about a hundred years and it basically started during the Great Depression as a way to not have to pay workers … and then it just kinda kept going because not having to pay workers is great for businesses.
Remember a dispatcher for semis that gets the runs much like DD would, they take 65-68% IF they own the truck. When it’s more like DD and they own nothing, they take 22-25% and they still have to pay for certain things dd never would and have a liability dd doesn’t.
BS on the companies not making profit because they steal.  He didn’t mention how they only pay about $2 a Delivery and some customers order from far distances when the same restaurant is near.  Or how DoorDash/others got caught stealing the tips and only paid $3 tips.  Some people have been shot at for trespassing from crazy shoppers and also most try and get free food by claiming they didn’t get the order and get a refund but the gig worker’s get deactivated.
Say it with me, folks: ANTITRUST LAW. So many of the problems this show discusses stem from the Reagan-era gutting of antitrust enforcement. Ending the era of unrestricted corporate consolidation wouldn't solve all our problems overnight, but it would sure help.
Technically, the devil challenged johnny to a battle of skill and proficiency. Taste in music wasnt what the goal was, technical mastery was. The devils playing, while sounding impressive was RIDICULOUSLY. easy and simplistic. He was basically doing tricks new fiddle players learn to sound impressive without a lot of effort. Johnny, on the other hand, by sampling those old folk songs, was showing a impressive and dazzling range and was doing things that are MUCH more dificult to do, even if they dont sound as complicated to the untrained ear. Suffice it to say, theres good reason the devil KNEW that he'd been beat.
Wasn’t this like weeks episode
Back in the early 2000s in the Inland Empire of Southern California, my dad was a gardener.  One of his customers owned a business called 'Dine in Delivery' and it was basically a very low tech GrubHub.  You would call them on the phone, and place your order for whatever restaurants they worked with (very limited compared to what GrubHub etc do now) and someone employed by Dine in Delivery would go pick up the food and deliver it.  We used their service once in a while, but I was too young to know what it cost.  I'm pretty sure there was a fee for the service, but no markup on the food.  We got Chilis delivered a few times, and it was just 'eh'.  Food loses something when it's packed and transported.    Dine in Deliver was WAY ahead of its time and the technology just wasn't there.  Barely any internet, cell phones were far and few between, and very minimal personal GPS.  It was just a different time  I am proud to say I have never used any of these food or grocery delivery apps.  I'll take and Uber or Lyft places, but I refuse to use the food delivery apps
Ive never related more to a joke than the Devil winning because of how much the dissonance does for the music.   Does anyone know of any other 'devil music' thats as cool as that? I can never find it
Here's a thought: ORGANIZE How about an organization of "independent food delivery contractors" that visualize exactly how these contractors are being exploited. If a food delivery company hires a subcontractor to deliver food from a restaurant they are responsible for what that subcontractor does and how he performs. These subcontractors need to know what demands they need to set in order to deliver this service to the company. They are fleecing the restaurants claiming they are delivering a service to them, while at the same time fleecing the subcontractors who are delivering the service. It's time for these companies to grow up, and that means educating everyone on what they require as a minimum so they do not accept these conditions.
I've never ordered delivery and never will. Plan ahead and budget better.
pretty ironic that liberal tech companies from liberal states are implementing pretty conservative corporate strategies.... cant make this comedy up
I frkn Love u bro... Always a pleasure watching the shows....
Tips are also stupid ... that incetives companies & restaurants to pay their employees less as they will make it up by tips ... its basically bribing to not spit in your food .. while the company get away scot free and the  customer gets angry at employee and vice versa .. the percentage game on top of that is another level of annoying. TBH tips should straight up be banned. pay your employees more increase min wage etc. instead.
Dd guy did everything but say, thanks for contacting DD chat ended, after that orphanage blunder
I’m a DoorDash driver, and I was wondering when you were going to cover this 😂
Eh this is just me as I don't know how other people's live. But I personally don't tip it is the restaurant responsibility to pay their workers a living wage. Furthermore I got a good pair of legs, a bike, or a car if needed. I'll go and get the food myself. If I'm strap for time I'll just see is the restaurant has a website and schedule a pickup at X time. As for needing a lift somewhere why would I use a app service? Nah I'll just call up a taxi as they pay their staff & follow guidelines better then these app companies do. Does this method of operation work for everyone? No, and I understand that. Anyways thanks for the read and have a good way. Make sure that cake is worth it.
That first add about food for bottoms grossed me out.  Honestly, I am concerned about our youth because while they are stoned out of their minds, America is being turned into a brain dead Oligarchy.  BTW, I very rarely eat any food out because I want to make sure I choose and cook my own food.
Preach on about the tips!!!!
50% is not a lot.
wow those poor restaurants that pay their servers and former delivery staff 2 dollars an hour.
The CUSTOMERS are getting the nice end of the stick? McDonalds for two people on Doordash costs upwards of 50$! If that's the nice end I just don't want the stick.  Delivery is increasingly becoming a luxury less and less people can afford.
It would be nice if drivers could block a customer who doesn’t tip. That way they would never be required to deliver to that address again. Enough drivers block that customer and they can no longer get deliveries. Then the drivers don’t have to worry about being punished for declining a delivery.
At list, for the very first time, the customer is the clear winner here.
As voters, we should ALL vote to protect WORKERS!!! Why? Because we are all WORKERS!!! Why would anyone vote against their own protections? If they aren't protected, you won't be protected either! Duh!!!
I'm a shopper, and everything reported on this segment is 100% accurate. Luckily I started a few years ago and have a good customer base but quite often there's no work because the company that I shop for will do a mass hiring and all of the veterans shoppers will just be sitting in the parking lot with no orders. They've cut our pay massively! There are no weeks that go by that I don't make more in tips than I do in shopper pay. That doesn't make any sense! Like a 70 piece order will pay $16. We have to rely on the customer to make it worth it and customers sometimes don't understand that we are underpaid to do this service and that if they don't tip us it is not worth doing it at all.😢 But people like myself that have a disabled child and quite often need to be able to go home on an emergency I'm stuck having to do these kind of jobs because any other conventional employment would fire me.
2:41 Skype was bought up by Microsoft nearly a decade prior, and they decided to integrate it into Teams instead when the market exploded due to Covid. And Teams absolutely took off, so I'd say they did pretty well
I used to not get ads watching LWT but now I do? Fuck you YouTube
Folks should get paid enough so tipping is not a thing.  I wouldn't mind paying more to know costs up front.
Never used any of them.
I have immune compromised people in my family and use these apps for grocery delivery. It’s literally a lifesaver for my family and I always tip because I know what a pain grocery shopping can be.
I knew that John Oliver didn't have taste, being from Britain, the country that stole the world for spices it never used, but I didn't know that he didn't understand music.  Johnny was clearly the better fiddler, the Devil basically just played a scale and did it quickly. That's not skill.
If you can't afford the tip, then you can't afford to order that way. It's simple, make yourself some phucking ramen 😮
I stopped driving Grubhub as of February this year.  I wasn't making enough to justify spending extra money on gas and upkeep of my car to even offset the amount of taxes that piled up over the years of me driving.  The moment you hit over $600, you have to file it and just watching myself sink *further* into the debt I was trying to get out of with this?  It just wasn't worth it.
Did anyone else find it strange that grocery shop and deliver apps were left out of this? Also, any calls for legislation ? Grocery apps take in billions, notoriously take advantage of workers, price gouge, and the real difference is what? Oh, it's owned by Target Corp and any calls for gig legislation would also be asking them to change isn't that right,  HBO?
Tipping is bullshit. It shouldn't be on me to make sure the employees are getting paid. Businesses make more than enough to pay their employees.
Fr i had over 100 orders and only one 5 star reveiw then i was 30 minutes late because the restaraunt took 20 minutes to start the food  and it took my rating all the way down to 3 stars and i was only able to get like 2$ deliverys they took the reveiw away afther a week but i havent started again
Something to think about: I'm all in favor of direct democracy. But it clearly, in these cases, it has some unintended consequences when major corporations can spend hundreds of millions on what are at least misleading, and in some cases, even false ads to support their positions. At the cost of even more money to the workers, but also the consumers and small businesses. Many of these ballot initiatives are so confusing in their wording the voters don't really know what they're voting for; they're set up to sound innocuous or even good for us when they're really not. And worse yet, like the 7/8 rule (that's already in court, but may possibly be upheld), when the voters realize what they've really got and get "buyer's remorse," they're horrendously difficult to undo. Finally, often they're done this way in order to by-pass real, democratic scrutiny that they might actually get from either legislators or governors who might veto them for very good reasons.  The bottom line: caveat emptor. Look at your ballot BEFORE you vote and clearly understand not just what it states, nor even what's implied, but the consequences of such initiatives when you vote. Because an informed electorate is absolutely necessary if we are to keep our democracy.
Stop using these stupid apps.  Is there a kitchen in your house?  Fucking use it.
I've tried my best to avoid getting delivery from companies like door dash. But last time I ordered pizza, from the actual store. I was surprised to see that door dash was subcontracted to deliver my pizza. I guess I just can't order delivery
You can also call a restaurant directly and go pick it up…and let’s remember that for restaurants working with these apps the prices increased to meet the fees while simultaneously lowering restaurant overhead by removing the need for full staffing, utility bills, insurance and operating costs for dine-in (dishes/linens, furnishings etc). Is it good to get your food delivered when you can’t or don’t want to drive? Yes, and any restaurant worth their salt should just employ a driver themselves and advertise delivery!
This is the same with Airbnb and vrbo
Strongly disagree about the tipping.  It is the job of companies to pay their workers properly.  All tipping does is perpetuate this toxic cycle of exploited underpaid workers begging for donations.
Buying a backpack cooler is a bit much, but i had to have a car when i was making deliveries.  A bike is just a transportation device, that should be on him.
Yes, the stupid US solution: " tip more" who needs proper employment, if you can lure food industry slaves with a chance of begging for change. Mandatory tipping is what makes it unnecessary to pay emplyees a decent salary.
I was doing furniture assembly for Wayfair thru Angi and Wayfair.  I stopped  after I started checking Wayfair’s website to find out how much they charged the client.  On average they are giving the assembler 35% but I have seen some as low as 18%.  AND if you need more time to assemble the item,  Angi will do everything possible not to pay you for your extra time.  The last one I did was a complex china cabinet that took 2 additional hours.  Client charged $350 and I was paid $34 with refusal to pay the additional 2 hours.  I was only allocated 1.5 hours to complete yet instructions said it would take 2 people 3 hours to assemble.
Yeah the more we tip the less likely these companies will ever pay their workers so don’t tip or do t use the app
"But you gotta fucking tip"  I'm not sure I agree with this, and I think we need to rethink this whole system of tipping.
DoorDash has, worst support, false promotions, lowest pay to dasher, most fee to store, and works harder on sending non tipped orders out than they do a good tipped order.  If someone is 10 miles away, orders DoorDash, tips $15, that order will pay $17..if the person orders and tips 0, dd will offer that ride to every person around that can’t afford to decline an order and will pay $8-$10 of their margins to send it off. So basically they decide by your tip whst they’ll pay dasher. That shouldn’t be legal for an IC… if I’m IC in what would world  dispatcher know of any tips I got?
This is different from most of John's videos. Since the companies aren't making a ton of money *--->YET<---*, I'm not sure who to be mad at.
I actually order out way less now and only from Chinese or pizza places with in-house delivery. Between the inflated costs and inferior product, it's not a logical product, for me.
The restaurants increased prices on these apps to compensate and the apps increased delivery fees, even when you're a premium member.  Also losing half your revenue is how taxes on laborers work too. Look at your pre and post tax income on your paystub. It's nearly half
MOM WAKE UP DADDY POSTED
Make your own food
You deleted the full episode you uploaded a few days ago? What a petty bunch of losers you are at HBO.
I often use these sites to find places, but then look them up to see if they have their own website or means to order as many of them do, so then I use that instead :)
all i hear is america is a hellhole that cant or wont affort some of its citizens basic human necessities that are given in other countries like basic level health insurance so a fucking work place injury isnt the end of your life. Also fuck your tipping culture.
Used doordash once… what would’ve been a $26 order for 2 BK combo’s had I just gone to the place myself ended up costing nearly $50 after in-app menu markup, app fee, delivery charge, separate driver fee and tip…  Could’ve just driven there myself and back, had fresher food and saved nearly $20 in fees and charges (had no problem tipping driver)  I also could’ve gotten 4 medium pizza’s and four 2-liter soda’s with delivery fee AND driver tip for about the same price by just calling a pizza place directly as opposed to 2 burgers, some fries 1 desert item and 2 large fountain drinks…  Other partnerships with DD don’t seem to include increased menu-prices, so that’s on me I guess for moving forward with my order but still…
It is absolutely insane. Spending millions on lobbying and advertising instead of paying and insuring workers. It's the typical tech bro thinking. If AI could do the delivery they would be even more happy. America is lost for normal people unless they stop the corruption of their politician by rich companies. That people really accept this while billionaires get richer and richer is  beyond my understanding.
I worked in restaurants for years, these apps are the worst for most mid sized restaurants. They charge monthly subscription fees, fees for every order, and workers at your restaurant never get any tips, you have to deal with impatient drivers. They act like you’re messing up their tips but you feel like they are messing up your tips. If you’re not a big enough outfit to eat the cost it doesn’t make sense for you.
Crazy how everything ties together.   My account was recently deactivated, because my completion rate dropped below 90%. It was one of those nights where I’d get to the restaurant and the wait time was crazy. So I went home for the evening. I get a notification that it was below 90% and that I was at risk of deactivation. Okay. I planned to head out the next night and get it back up. Not even 16 hours later, they deactivated my account. Mind you, I’ve completed thousands of deliveries. Dashed all throughout the lockdown.   I appealed, they decided the deactivation would stand.  I still have accounts with competitors, but fuck all of them at this point.
"Independent contractors" Ah, WWE type shit. Oh gee, how can this story get any worse? 😂
So in NYC delivery people are getting paid a minimum no matter what.... So if there is no tip they still get paid, I'm not sure what's bad about it except that they get paid minimum wage.
I disagree that delivery hurts restaurants. 1. If delivery stopped there are about 5 places that wouldnt get our business. 2. Pizza places have been delivering since the dawn of time. Door dash is just greedy
How is it a win for consumers to pay 5x as much as they should be? Now we're expected to add an even BIGGER tip in addition to all the fees and markups?
My ex drives for doordash. Her car is constantly trashed and disgusting. She takes her kids with her, because they are too immature and irresponsible to be left home alone. And and the kids are very unhygienic because nobody holds them accountable or says anything. If you get food from her, rest assured that it's been sitting in a 14 yo's lap and hands, probably after doing all of the disgusting things that 14 year olds do without washing their hands.
I see John Oliver, I drop everything.
Me, watching this while eating uber eats:
I've been watching this on Youtube every Monday religiously. Is there a reason these videos are being released on Thursdays now? All that's happening is most regulars watch it first on a shite quality version that's pirated and released on YT on Monday.
John needs to do the newspaper next, route drivers have gotten hammered and are now dwindling beyond nonexistence
Not sorry for not giving a fuck. Feel free to get a job at one of the thousands of other low skill low paying jobs.  If you look at the route that the dude drove for a single slice of cake there are hundreds of retail spots on the way.  Driving a bike with a broken foot is a red flag for the actual employee to me not the employer.  These people are opting for working for companies that ruin businesses than getting a job at McDonalds because they feel like they will get laughed at or some shit.
Food delivery apps - in fact, all web based apps generally - are the stupidest waste of space and time ever conceived. I have never used one and never will. We've had delivery for decades - it's called take-out and the phone. And "pandemic era ads"? What? As if it had happened a hundred years ago. It just happened. How irritating.
John, to answer your question about Skype - Microsoft rebranded it as Teams.  You're welcome
ill just say it don't use the apps, I never have and I never will I only get delivery provided by the restaurant or I haul my own happy ass out there and get it.
Very Eye opening. We the customers are paying less for this service than it costs. We should be tipping the delivery persons more.
I used to work in a company that is in the food delivery industry. And I have seen the commission rates for these restaurants in our system and I can confirm it's not uncommon to see a commission rate of over 30%.
disgusting
Ok one point. We aren't pretending to be regular customers while working for grubhub. We are just a driver who has a card from grubhub who finds out the order is a pay at restaurant order so we place the order pay with grubhub card then make delivery. We do not know if the restaurant consensus or not, we aren't asked we aren't Employees just people with an app on our phone. Please stop presenting it like us the drivers have any say in these things.
Need to interview Dave Welch of Lincoln NE, he's been running his business for over a decade, he's been delivering himself as he can afford to hire people at a decent wage
skype is Microsoft Teams. Another EEE for microsoft.
Apparently I'm still stuck in 2003.
Broke: thinking the devil won the fiddle contest because it sounded better Woke: seeing that Johnny’s fiddle solo was far more technically challenging and displayed knowledge of a wide diaspora of folk music from across America  Bespoke: understanding that, by goading Johnny into a fiddle contest, the devil convinced him to fall into his Avarice and pride. Regardless of the outcome of that battle his soul will most likely fall to that most unsavory of places upon his passing, and wars of attrition are always won by the ageless.
Back when I was using delivery apps relatively often, I wouldn't make an order if I even thought it might rain in the next half hour.
When peopLe get raises, The cost of things goes up. We buy things for the highest price possibLe EmpLoyers and contractors pay people the smaLLest compensation possibLe. Seems to be a winning aLgorithm to me. Yep thats capitaLism for ya. weLp. 😂😭
Kimmel said it best: You tip %20 to have your food delivered to a table, these people at delivering it to your front f#$%king door. PAY UP 🏆
Corporations are inherently anti-democracy. Just saying.
Omg starting an orphanage, that’s my dream! I better sign up for door dash!
What are you talking about? Restaurants that offer delivery don't need 15 employees standing around doing nothing until they make a delivery. I was a delivery driver for a restaurant and I got a list and had a route, I'd deliver and when I returned to the restaurant there was another group of usually like three or four deliveries to make. It worked fine. I have no idea what you're talking about.
I work at Starbucks. When we are out of something, which is often, we can mark it as unavailable to order in our mobile ordering app, so customers can’t buy something we don’t have. However, we do not have the ability to mark things as unavailable in UberEats’s app, so we still get people ordering things we physically do not have in stock, and then don’t even have a way to contact them. So we have to wait for the delivery driver to show up and ask for them to call the person and explain the issue, which often presents additional problems with language barriers and price differences.
See this is why when i use these apps i give the driver their tip in cash
Did they use ai for those background images?
11:00 I used to see this all the time the mom and Pop pizza shop down the street for me. It will say it’s close, but then I will drive by there and it’s open.
How does a store make $16000 and only get $7000? They have to lose money after paying workers and food supplies. It’s insane how much these apps think they should make when they are a app full of bugs, and any help needs to go through, a full time scammer that does support on the side
Doordash regularly marks up the price of menu items by $4 each. I was going to order Jersey Mike's the other day, 2 sandwiches. It would've been over $60. I have no idea where this idea comes from that we're getting some sort of amazing value right now from these scumbags.
Aniston, Hewitt, Psaki, Rippa and Lu. That's my brain surgery team John. Last names only. All Smith  The called me Paul. John, you clearly lack the surreptivity as in order to actually want the brain surgery.
I just went back ordering from the place directly. Over here in Germany most shops *do* direct delivery as that gives them most of the money even after deducting the labor cost. Better than giving the money to shitplaces like Lieferando.
“Buy a gift for someone, or start an orphanage.”. WHAT??? 😂
Californian former driver here. I can tell you for sure prop 22 fucked drivers over wildly. Its supposed to give guaranteed income to those that drive. At the absolute most, i only ever got $50. All of that went into gas, and the second I needed anything else, I didn't make any money. I was between jobs and had to make rent for my partner and myself. There were weeks where I didn't get that guaranteed payment AT ALL because I drove TOO MUCH
The devil had far less skill in his fiddle work. He just did the same pair of motions over and over and had the chorus of demons cover for him. The other guy actually had technical skill and showed it.
We need to outlaw tipping in the US. It's just a way for companies to underpay their workers and blame the consumer for poor wages. Tie minimum wage to the cost of living of a zip code and outlaw tipping. It would fix ALL OF THIS. Like why do we still do this. It's INSANE.
The knee thing he didn't mention or at least I didn't catch. The huge fees they impose of restaurants. It's now 35 to 45% to use their services. A lot of restaurants are getting away from these apps.
I order almost every other day and I see no reason to tip people for stuff they chose to do. If you are choosing to do delivery you need to be under the assumption there will be no tip.  I will definitely tip 1/3rd if the weather is bad, or the road conditions are bad or it is some weird hour. But you can't force people to sympathize when you are paying 50% more on every order already. Stupid american system
I’m experiencing tip fatigue but i always tip delivery drivers well. I don’t consider it a tip so much as a payment for a service-driving all the way to a restaurant then to my house. That service is worth more than the app fees. It’s not like there’s any money for a real salary for these workers floating around in the ether. So tipping is necessary. You can’t realistically expect someone to drive around for you for free.
Instead of these over valued tech companies we should have more investment in things we actually need like food.  More money paid to agricultural workers. More money for paid to lower paying jobs that we need.  As long as people are easily replaceable, they dont get what they really earn.
Skype did win. The technology from Skype was used for Teams which is easily the standard for business video conference.  Do better.
I havent ordered from any of these delivery apps except once.  Sonce they dont work for the restaurant the food is not important to them, so they take multiple orders and i guess i was last.  After an hour and a half my food arrived, cold and gross
I will chew on sawdust before I use a parasitic delivery app .
John Oliver, you’re contributing to the problem when you’re shaming a customer for not leaving a tip for a slice of cake. IT’S NOT THE CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITY THAT WORKERS SHOULD BE PAID PROPERLY.
how are these corporations not making a profit?  excessive upper echelon pay for corporate execs!
Get out of the house, people.
Is everything ok over at HBO? I feel like I watched this a week ago on streaming.
protip for ubereats customers: you have one hour after the food is delivered to change your tip.  Put a big tip up front, watch your ubereats driver actually do their job in a timely manner, and then change the tip to a realistic amount after it arrives.
The thing that always leaves me depressed about these John Oliver segments is that at the end, when he says what can we do... literally nothing. You seriously think relying on everyone or even a significant number of people to collectively agree on and take any kind of action is a viable solution? Or how about my favorite "write your congressmen?" 10 years ago when I graduated from school, I thought I would get into a helping profession because I wanted to make a difference. Honestly it's a waist of time, and you are fighting a losing battle while getting paid less and making very little difference overall. The world we live in rewards being an ass. Personally I doubt humanity will survive another millennia anyway, so I'm just gonna do what makes me happy, thanks anyway...
There used to be this delivery app called Foodler that I used all the time in 2016-17 (when it was then bought out by GrubHub). I had just moved to Boston from small-town Kentucky, and as a vegetarian, I suddenly had an overwhelming surplus of options that I’d never had before. I used Foodler all the time for my dietary odyssey, and it became essential when I went through a really bad depression for two months and never left my apartment. So yeah, these apps can be great! I always tip, though. Only a fucking monster doesn’t tip, and that includes the cake guy, because I’ve been through it too, and usually tip MORE because of how depression fuels my empathy. I hope that cake guy saw that news segment and now tips 150% out of guilt.
I have been boycotting since 2021, NO regrets
There are other types of work… People choose these crazy jobs… I’ve never ordered food delivery, and hopefully never will… No pity here…👎🏼
What are people literally paying for😂??? Grub hub don’t employ the drivers, don’t make the food and consumers are the ones paying for the ENTIRE transaction. So are these apps being payed for gracing us with the privilege to link up and exchange money? And that oppertunity they give us to make this transaction allows them to take 52 percent of all the money, while they give nothing to the driver restaurant and the consumer has to pull out another 20 percent to tip the service worker??? Maybe I’m missing something but just tip more is not a solution in the slightest bit. But I understand saying that is easier than saying monopolies ruin living standards in an economy. The longer market conditions like this go without regulation the poorer people will get.
@22:56 Compassionate tipping is not required in NY, as I understand how law works: resturants must ensure their workers at least minimum pay (if they dont cover with tips). So if anything, we should push for a highger minimum wage. Consumers shouldn't subsidize low wages by tipping; min wage has to be adjusted. Tipping is a gift.
LOOK. LOOK. I KNOW I'M BEING THAT GUY HERE - but the devil lost because a fiddle made of gold would sound like shit.
My solution is get an air fryer and get some food that you can make yourself at home. pandemic God sent for me to eat more at home. I’m not willing to have it delivered and when the customer order something, they don’t know how far your driver is coming from so maybe they don’t know how far the drivers coming from or what kind of hardship journey they have to make to deliver a single piece of cake. I’m not willing to tip big  so therefore I just don’t order out on these apps I pick up or make something myself. I did a delivery side, hustle for target stores delivery. I quit after I had to climb three floors of stairs to deliver 5 gallon milks and didn’t get a tip.
These apps make up for it with subscription tiers to remove delivery charges. That mean that users that have the subscription but only use the app once in a while or forget to turn it off are paying the platform free money basically.
I used to drive for GrubHub. Honestly, we need to outlaw in these my apps. We used to have a locally owned service thing like that, it was the same idea but the drivers all made at least minimum wage in addition to tips. Eff these companies. They're ruining the restaurant industry.
Just FYI, in NYS the NYS dept of labor has repeatedly held these types of employers are true employers and the employees are not independent contractors.  In NYS, your work with door dash, lyft, and so forth can qualify you for an unemployment insurance claim
I've never used a food delivery app. Why not just order online with your webbrower? Why would I install an app to order food.
I only use delivery apps if I have a coupon and that coupon saves me money vs ordering from the restaurant direct. And yes, I'm one of those assholes that generally doesn't tip, especially if I'm forced to use delivery by the terms of the coupon. If these apps can afford to spend $184 million on a prop campaign, they can afford to pay their drivers a proper wage.
Uber started to pay per hour in the Netherlands, but it is still modern slavery. The recruiters lie to you about being a fulltime job, then you realise you have only 4h shifts a day, and you work 6 days but for 24 hours in total. Uber asks us to start in certain places of the city, but does not pay travel allowance like all other jobs. Uber does not pay millage allowance for using our own bycicles, own phones, own abonaments to call. I repeat, this is not a  self employed job.  Yet, still I am being payed only my 13 euro pe hour and some shitty unachievable bonuses that force you to work very hard and put yourself in danger.
Tips are based on services rendered... stop expecting & start performing
Gig work. Corporations sucking ignorant people out of their remaining pride and little remaining infrastructure. Harming the restaurants and screwing over the customer.  Every such order I've placed was completely screwed up.
The classic problem with liberals. You analyze the problem almost correctly. Then, you suggest a wrong solution to temporarily offset the problem or move the blame to consumers, like tipping the delivery workers. The main problem is the apps and their policies. They take too much cut and they don't keep the delivery workers as their employees. That should be fixed.
Here’s a thought. Stop asking us to tip. Just build it into the price. We’re still paying for it. If people really want delivery then they’ll pay. If the pay isn’t high enough, then people will look for other jobs.
Gosh the tech industry is such a mess
how tf can they spend s much on lobbying without making a profit wtf xD capitalism is so broken
I love paying $30 for a $14 burger while someone barely makes minimum wage delivers my meal to me
I finally found something I disagree with him on. I don't think the solution should be that people tip more. Companies should just pay their workers a living wage.
The obvious solution is to build a 25 mile long sushi train. Mass transit.
Uber drivers rate you too. Rated a driver the highest score and he showed me, he gave me the best score on his app!
I wish he had mentioned Instacart. Still, great piece.
Its amazing how we allow people that think that we can start a orphanage within 5m to predate on  workers, restaurants...
You missed an EXTREME safety concern.  I ordered a soup from a local Italian restaurant but got an incorrect soup. The soup we received was Lobster Bisque.  We called the restaurant and they stated the soup we ordered isn't on their menu and Doordash ordered the lobster bisque.  After calling Doordash it turned out they had the incorrect menu and instead of dropping the soup or calling they substituted the soup we ordered with lobster bisque.  First, automated substitutions should never happen but why would you substitute with a shellfish dish?! What if I was allergic to shellfish? If they made that mistake with shellfish what is to stop them from doing that with peanuts?  Maybe this has been fixed in the last two years but the fact it ever happened is insane.
Drivers also have to use their own cell phones to take pictures of grocery bags to send to the customer that ordered them. So, if a driver stops at a grocery store for 3 customers groceries. They will have to take individual pictures of each customer's grocery bags, and send the customer the photos before the driver gets on the road.
21:5/ : I call BS
it's still during the pandemic
Do one about squatters rights
I refuse to use any service that has a "gig" model, as much as I can. It sometimes feels inconvenient to not have food, medicine and groceries delivered to me, or not having Uber when I need them badly, but its a hill I'm willing to die on.
The reason people might not tip is that the service charges are so high they probably think some of that must go to the delivery person.
Related note about feedback and ratings: most retail establishments give customers the ability to fill out surveys for feedback.  And when I worked retail, we had customers give us negative reviews all the time for things completely out of our control - things like corporate modifying the phone system so you don't get to speak to a human being anymore (not our decision, we have no control over that), the website being down or having misleading/outdated information, or even things like we did everything right but a different store in the chain did everything wrong so now here's the chance for the customer to unload.  Please, any customer reading this: FEEDBACK DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY.  When you submit a complaint like that, it goes against the scorecard of whatever register person you interacted with and NOBODY else.  If you take issue with the manager, another store, or corporate, you CANNOT leave feedback like that to get your message across.  You're just ruining the career and livelihood of innocent minimum-wage worker who was unlucky enough to get you.  I've been in meetings with upper management trying to defend the yearly raises of employees who received such feedback and it is an uphill struggle against pointy-haired bosses.  Bosses and corporate don't parse the differences in feedback or have any understanding of nuance.  The customer-facing employees already have to deal with enough psychopaths and sociopaths without having to deal well-meaning people submitting a negative review because they believe they're reviewing the store or another third-party instead of the person directly in front of them.  In any retail setting, or apps like in this video, your feedback will only ever impact the person you interacted with.
I am once more glad to live in Europe. 😂 Here, most restaurants still have their own delivery drivers. They are just offering to order through these platforms and you usually get it cheaper if you call them since the platform isn't taking a cut then. As far as I know the platforms even take less then 10% of the whole order and I'd consider that a fair cut for the service they provide.  there are delivery drivers working directly for the platforms, but it's not the majority as far as I know.
Someone is somehow getting access to these shows weeks early and is leaking these shows. I watched this episode last week from a bootleg channel
I give everyone 5 stars automatically
Great video! I look forward to the day you do a story exposing the horrors of childcare in America  -American daycare worker
I reeeally hate.. that politicians are so easily bought.
There’s no way these companies are not able to profitable with their pricing structure. They must be making investments to have “debts” just to avoid federal taxes. It’s a sca-I mean- scheme.
When I first glanced at the title I thought it said "Food Delivery Apes".  That would have been amazing! But this was pretty entertaining and informative too.
considering I tried to order on doordash and got litearlly 16$ in fees for dinner for 2 people, I don't consider this particularly affordable...
NOT TRUE. @johnoliver please check FACTS. The price on the menu in the restaurants VS the price in the apps. THEY CHARGE MORE per product in their apps PLUS they have a big service fee besides the tip. Those companies make big money but the messengers don't and you just scratched the surface with insurance policy, there is more...
Spain passed a law in 2021 to avoid these abuses from the delivery apps. Also I think there is a project at the European Union level soon to be implemented.
"Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons-a-bitches... I'll recruit my army from the orphanages."  B. Dylan.
The delivery driver rang my doorbell 4 times yesterday, and had me scared shitless..  I could only see a police car out the window. Turned off all lights for an hr.  Turns out he was helping someone unrelated w/ a flat tire. (F me right?)   Just going thru a lot and didn't know my Walgreens delivery would 1) Apply no tip or, 2) Immediately request the delivery within 45 minutes of ordering online, and 3) Use Instacart by default (not Walgreens delivery). Four doorbell rings though with cops in front of my house. No cap on a stack plz
I watched this a week ago
I stopped doing gig work since it doesn't cover the cost of gas.  When I first started, the bonuses and incentives really made it worth it.
In Germany you shouldn't even tip through the app. If the driver is not employed by Lieferando (German Grubhub) the tip just goes to Lieferando and never reaches the restaurant. Since you can't know if a driver is an employee of the restaurant or Lieferando it makes it risky to tip via app. Only in cash upon delivery.
Big tech has ruined all of the things we used to enjoy.  I feel dirty ordering using food delivery apps. I feel dirty playing mobile games. I feel dirty ordering an Uber.  Hell, I feel dirty any time I try to do something only to be instructed to download the app, after which I'm presented with yet another free trial that automatically rolls into a $10-$20/mo subscription.  I wish I could toss my phone without functionally opting out of my participation in society.
If you cant tip, you shouldnt be using a delivery service
You guys it's meowmeowbeans irl
To be fair Skype is owned by Microsoft and they weren't going to allow it to be out done by Teams
dejavu?
I can count the number of times I’ve used delivery apps. Always seemed predatory
Anybody who can't fry an egg or spread peanut butter on bread deserves no sympathy and the cost to the environment for delivering a meal is absolutely ridiculous😢😢😢
The bike driver who got hit by a car and couldnt pay his medical bills, why didnt the driver of the car's insurance cover it? Probably because it was 100% the delivery guy's fault. That part of the story needs about 50 questions. You cant just run over a guy on a bike then say 'tell your employer to cover it'.
Unless you are handicapped at home or have money to throw around you shouldn't bother using delivery apps, even more so if you're not gonna tip. To be fair, if you can't handle not getting tipped  you shouldn't be working these jobs, not alot of people can afford to tip. What we need to focus on is the severe toxic tipping culture in the US.
Haven’t started the video but I did an economics paper on food delivery apps a few weeks back! Let’s see how this compares
From my personal experience being a delivery worker is literal hell and has almost little to no benefits. And from my experience as a consumer of GrubHub mostly, it's staggering to see GrubHub themselves being responsible for several miscommunications and damaged or incomplete orders, yet they will flag and then cap your account because of their mistakes, reducing the times they can actually give you a refund for things YOU DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE
Another symptom of late-stage capitalism. I only used delivery apps at the first part of the pandemic and never used them before and never used them since. It's like people have a problem with gangs when it's black people, but if you make that gang or Mafia a business people are totally okay with it.
I do Doordash full time. It's extremely demoralizing. In the first few weeks of being a new driver, they seem to give a lot more high paying orders, then you have to keep your Acceptance Rating stat above certain thresholds to keep high priority on orders. You think "wow, I made pretty good money this month, I'll stick with it. Then the orderst start to dry up, and it's nothing but shitty $2.50 orders going 10+ miles, and sometimes even going outside of the delivery zone. Then, you gotta drive BACK to your spot to hopefully get more orders. On top of the gas alone not making this trip worth it, factoring in restaurant wait time, traffic, and trying to actually find the persons house/door, this order could take upwards of 40 mins or more. For $2.50. This is what the company pays per order in my area, this means the costumer either didn't tip, or somewhere along the way, the tip got eaten up by the number of 3rd party apps and services the costumer may have used to order. These companies are placing the burden of paying the employees who do the actual labor that makes the business work on the consumer, much like waiters in restaurants relying on tips. Both systems are EXTREMELY fucked up and needs to change.
Delivery apps constantly reduce our restaurant’s prices without our knowledge  When we don’t notice, it gets too busy to for us to handle, we make half of what we would’ve make, & the apps would still profit Also it takes hours to readjust prices back  But we can’t leave because most our sales are delivery now because they “outcompeted” pickups
21:45 but you're paying way more than you would if you just went out and got the thing yourself.
I've never used these apps and I will never be tempted to try them. Sorry I'm not paying $35 for a meal I could make at home for $10. That kind of math is why people are struggling.
The Skype joke was stolen or at least second hand to a College humor sketch from 2019 with Brennan Lee Mulligan.
So nice they uploaded twice
Still never used meal delivery aside from the free dollars they (or Amex) give us occasionally.  Amex gives 15$ per month, which we still pick up like luddites
If you are choosing to do a side job that doesnt have steady pay and requires you to be a contractor as a a main job... Quit... Find a different job that pays consistently. Then if you are still struggling do the side job for extra money
In this day and age being lazy costs a whole lot more
So, if they didn’t waste money on lobbying, they could make a profit and pay their employees properly? Who could have predicted that?
consumers aren't winning shit. Those uber eats transaction fees on the consumer side can rival Ticketmaster. So the business model might not be profitable, but their execs are sure lining their pockets
The “millennial lifestyle subsidy” is kind of a misnomer, as a millennial I would gladly trade the gig economy apps for the unaliving of every venture capitalist.
It’s a shame for the delivery drivers getting the short end of the stick once again. We voted no for Prop 22 because we could see the big companies backed it, which meant they were gaining something out of it. But their campaign for it went hard on being about supporting the drivers, which was such a lie. I was shocked to see it pass but I’m glad it’s getting some due diligence this year.
I think this missed the entire point. There should be a higher minimum wage THAT doesn't need tips, including for delivery workers, and tipping is going to destroy America. Furthermore, there needs to be regulations controlling this delivery apps that protects both workers and consumers. I feel like John's "actions" at the end just solves nothing except helps the apps.
No country OTHER THAN US has such imposing tip culture. Sad for consumers😢
No benefits, increased risk for vehicular accident, and a pay system that is akin to a slot machine. Sounds like a bad deal that is predatory on an increased number of people that feel like there's no other choice. Nothing will change unless the drivers strike and US law makers get involved.
💗🤮💗
Really odd to see them fall on the side of tipping. How about we all don't tip and the company just pays their employees a livable wage?
Thanks America, for every single thing you label war. Thanks for the legacy.
The other issue with the food delivery companies is Google prioritizes them. A restaurant I knew was open was reported as closed by Google because one of the delivery services said they were closed. They were not closed. They even had their own delivery drivers so they even delivered.
I use Door Dash from time to time. My deal is not to offer an online tip but to give the driver a significant cash tip when they get to my door, generally 50% or 10 bucks whichever is greater. The driver always seems to appreciate it, never forgets to say, 'thanks dude', and always leaves with a smile. I won't order out unless I can afford the tip. P.S. Tipping in cash after the delivery is made allows me to reward quick delivery of a hot meal and withhold the tip for cold food that's an hour late.
I've been waiting for this since i saw the first food delivery app. is this where i say bingo or just "about time"?
I still call my Döner-Laden or the Pizzeria.
1t:38: So that's why some drivers eat your food?
WOW, that was an amazing report. thank you. I love the detail, the depth, and irony. I like your humor and delivery. ( it took me time to really value your work it was a bit too much at first) I am so glad I persisted, your insight and politics are so old style honest and straight forward. I definitely value your work top of the list of critical watchers and informers.
Do restaurants treat you like family, or do they charge you for food?
This guy sucks
I hear the tip service worker idea. I agree. But the premise is “The government and giant corporations are taking advantage of your fellow working class Americans, tip them the difference so this atrocity can go away👍🏾” .. that isnt a solution 👀, customers should do that, if there’s a collective plan in the society to collapse the actual problem ,There’s an exploitative labour market happening in the economy.   You don’t fix it by passing the burden of cost to the consumer, when literally these companies make their margins on not paying people😕????
John i love you i do but you absolute fucking bafoon. In the devil went down to Georgia the devil looses because what hes doing takes less technical skill than what johny is doing. Yes the devils sounds cooler but johny in sampling those old folk songs is displaying a mastery of the finer techniques of the instrument
Get this on the cloud asap
Capitalism is a disease and we're in stage 4
We need to tip more?? Why not hold them accountable and pay the workers more?? Why is is all up to us with increased prices? Just don't use it...
I work for a small local restaurant that refuses to partner with any apps despite repeated calls from them. Instead, they keep sending undisclosed employees in to take copies of our menu to post online without our permission, which results in massive headaches for us because we have no online ordering setup. Instead, we get calls from the delivery workers trying to place orders from outdated menus for items we have never carried, don't carry anymore, or may be serving completely differently now, which they then have to hang up on us to call the app user for changes to the order or clarification on options they didn't know we had, then call us again, which massively wastes everybody's time. I think my record is having to talk to the same app worker 4 times on a single order as they kept discovering new complications with the order which they had to keep stopping to call the user about. This is massively troublesome for us, because we are a TINY business - we never have more than 5 workers TOTAL on staff (including the owner), rarely that many on shift, and frequently only 2 people running the place during the slow season in winter.   And while this piece touched on the issues with customers not tipping delivery drivers, it's worth noting that this is another spot where restaurants get screwed over by app delivery, because no matter how much the driver gets tipped, you've got to know that precisely $0 of that is going to the restaurant staff who actually made your food.
I love at 0:45 you hear someone yell "WHAT?!"
The thing about the slice of cake delivery, in my experience; we get offers to buy things from nearby stores, expecting our original driver to Also get the 2nd item (sometimes desert, snacks or drinks) only to have them dropped by secondary drivers Before our primary order. I've tipped on my main order, not realizing that I needed to tip a Second time for a Second delivery I Didnt expect
So why isn’t the government stepping in? What those apps paid drivers in 2020 was a fair wage. People made a living and the app was still making money. They are gouging in every spot at the expense of every POS. Then they are not paying taxes. The government need the workers to pay taxes and they never will unless they earn a realistic wage. They’ll barely be break even
Shame he didnt discuss the other side of the problem which is stolen food, eaten food, and failed deliveries.
I hated when all these food delivery apps came out. Local restaurants that used to have delivery drivers bowed to the pressure and started using these apps. How can I pay 2x as much for delivery and get my food twice as slowly? Easy...delivery apps.
Oliver was reading my mind. The other week i was thinking that the devil actually played better.   That MFer should own johnnys soul.
Anything anyone lists as a "side hustle" is complete BS. It isn't a job, it's you being taken advantage of by a mega-corp. These businesses need to be regulated, same with the "I'm not a taxi" taxi companies.
Love how they try to justify their existence and high fees by claiming to not make any money, but they still have hundreds of millions for campaigning and advertising. Nice how that works for them
If your business model isn't profitable, then it should be a nonprofit.
Im saying this as a software engineer.   The problem isnthese sites dont need the engineering head count as they have. They could slash 3/4s of their tech headcount and be just fine
I’ve still never used a delivery app like this 🤷🏻‍♂️
The business model of the sharing economy: "We own the stuff that makes money (well, except it doesn't).  Our employees (err, independent contractors) own the stuff that costs money.  And for that, I'll never use any of these businesses.  If these companies have the money to lobby themselves exceptions to labor protection laws, they have money to pay their delivery drivers better and not F over restraunts to get it.  Your business model isn't otherwise sustainable you say?  Well, tough 💩 tech bro.
"Maybe our drivers are saving up to start an orphanage" is the kind of statement that makes me absolutely convinced that every single tech bro startup CEO is an alien whose only knowledge of humanity is derived from watching As Seen On TV ads recorded on worn out VHS tapes.
The diddler has been didling our food
Never used these apps because we live out in the country and no one would ever deliver
I was disappointed that none of this segment talked about terrible delivery drivers too.  I've stopped using these apps cause I had way too many times when they dropped the food off at the wrong place, and the driver would just be 'well I've already moved on I'm sure you can find it, it's in the general area bro!'
Calling the consumers winners when they pay 50% markup on the food isn't winning.  Consumers aren't paying less than it's worth. It's not worth the price the price they think we should be paying.
8:30 was a massive problem for my restaurant. They kept putting us on with a menu from 3 years prior. We change menu season and they had our old summer menu during the winter.
These apps charge restaurants over 30%.  AND they charge customers. Started well, quickly turned into massive ripoffs.  I stopped using all of them.  Back to phone calls...
We cannot tip delivery workers as the food is too expensive. For me and I’m sure millions of others we order online at the restaurant website and pick up our food. This reduces cost and supports the local restaurant without giving money to these middle business apps.  Tipping in the US has become absurd!   We need to abolish it as a means to supplement waiters/waitresses. Instead let’s pay all individuals a livable wage 15-20 dollars an hour. If your restaurant cannot support its staff at a proper wage and health insurance/benefits and you continue to shove the expense onto the public then you failed at the restaurant business!
All those apps are a complete waste of money
His videos aren’t fun anymore, they just piss me off because he solely sheds light on how much the world sucks. Which obviously needs to be done. But the show has taken such a dark turn it bums me out the rest of my day because he talks about things we’re powerless to change
Microsoft happened to Skype
8:46 I guess that company should make a new product, or they'll get sued, right?
One of the angriest customers I ever dealt with was someone that ordered through one of these apps.  For background, it was a pizza place that refused (and repeatedly refused) to be put on their website to the point of having lawyer send a cease and desist after they refused to take us down.  Orders came in over the phone, and this particular app had callers with the caller ID in San Bernardino California to our Buffalo pizza place, so we always knew when we were getting one and had had so many problems that ONLY managers took those calls.  This was partly because of how poorly they would frequently order, with requests like a "cheese and onion pizza but instead of onions, pepperoni".  This particular call ordered a "17 inch pizza cheese/pepperoni and 50 wings, half hot, half BBQ."  We confirmed (twice) a Large 17 inch pizza, 50 wings, half hot, half bbq.  We charged the person that showed up $51.95 plus tax.  We showed them the food as is our standard protocol to confirm quality.  Half an hour later we got a call from an enraged customer that they had been charged over 96 dollars for a large pizza and 50 wings when they had ordered a Sheet (18x26) and 50 wings.  The actual price of that order would have been $62.95 plus tax, so there was an absolutely absurd markup.  The guy wanted his money back from "us" for screwing up his food.  (Also, holy shit, the prices are now $81.98 and $95.98.  Those earlier prices were in 2020.)  Thankfully I fielded that original call and this followup call, and was able to recall it specifically and calm the guy down by shifting the blame and resolve him not having enough food for the company he had over AND letting him know he had to go through the food delivery app to get his money back.  The dumbest part was I had a delivery driver sitting in the back making boxes at the time that could have delivered his food for a much better price, and probably without error given the guy calling would actually know what he's ordering.  Our driver almost certainly was paid better too.  (Our delivery drivers made 100% of the 3 dollar charge per delivery in addition to any tips and minimum wage.)
Are you kidding me, how is paying $80$10 for delivery a discount?
I’ve know several people who have done “gig” work thru Instacart or DoorDash and they average $12 an hour. And they have no benefits whatsoever. Plus they have to set aside $$ for taxes. The wear and tear on their vehicles is one of the worst, because when they have a necessary car repair, they don’t make enough $$ to afford to repair their car, which they need to work. Plus they can’t work when they want. They have to get up early and stay out late in order to make any kind of decent $$ to survive. The only way they can see a difference in their income is to hopefully get generous tips from generous customers who understand how hard these people work!!
As a programmer, I am disgusted by the number of bozos who know nothing about nothing and make 6 figures playing "Job". Food apps are probably even worse than gambling companies when it comes to productivity. They should make a free platform and cut the leeches out. I  personally use them to look at the menu, then call the restaurant directly ;)
I hate the entire concept of "apps"  used to be your browser and your operating system could handle everything you wanted to do on the internet. That gives the consumer too much control. Now they want to compartmentalize everything and control every aspect of everything you do and spy on you while you do it. Your cell phone is a sophisticated spying device that tracks and records everything you do. And stupid people refuse to leave home without it.  People who dont own a PC and do everything through their stupid phones, are fools.
I think you should just call Domino's.
Let’s not gloss over the fact you can copy the second half of this story, say “rideshare” and you’d have next weeks episode.
Smart phones and apps haven’t been kind to delivery drivers. I was a delivery driver for many years long before smartphones in the late 70’s through the 90’s. ( I could not do a job sitting in an office staring at a clock for 8 hours) Back then I was a fully paid employee with all the benefits including workers compensation and other benefits. On occasion I would also deliver for restaurants basically using my own car but was also a paid employee with employees benefits using the company vehicles.(depended on the company I worked for)I rarely used my own car. I worked for a florist for 15 years and it was great. I even got hurt one time on the job and workers comp not only paid 100 percent of all medical bills I also got 100 percent salary while recovering. I never had to worry about taxes as taxes were taken out like all employees and I never had to worry about gas or gas prices and the vehicles were company vehicles and as long as I didn’t get a bunch of traffic violations I was golden. My driving record in those days was stellar as even at the busier times Christmas Mother’s Day etc. there was not allot of pressure delivering flowers when you are part of a 10 vehicle crew and had a great dispatch.
We need to boycott these companies. Most restaurants have websites or even their own apps you can order from
Always hated the gig economy,  usually the only ones that make any profit are at the top. John you forgot to mention the salaries of these higher ups, the sales staff etc,. It's important because that is where the real costs are while those who deliver and the restaurant that overpays suffer. Good show, would have said Great but you know...
As a small business warehouse  supervisor making $8 an hour in Louisiana I.... fuck me....😢
After the DoorDash tip skimming fiasco, for me to see that their margins with the business themselves are also borderline criminal I am assured in my conviction to never order from them.
Neo feudalism sure is grand isn't it.
I stopped tipping via the Grubhub app (Lieferando here in Germany) after I mentioned to one of the drivers that I had tipped him via the app, and he said those tips never made their way to him. I always tip cash now. Often, I'll check to see if the restaurant has a delivery service in place, and sometimes, the menu on their own website will be have lot more options.
I’m 74 and I find the ads,an insult to veggie tales. Love your style,Jon. 6 JANUARY NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGIVE
In essence, there is a few people high up the food chain in these companies who get rich from our laziness to not care about their workers rights or the restaurants that actually make the food.
Hit the Like at the "Happy Easter, by the way". So much love.
What the fck is a bottom friendly menu
7:16 John, we’ve been over this…..Stephen Miller is the human Squidward, you’re the funny Brit birb man.
Despite the $40 cost for delivering a $12 meal before tip, somehow the apps manage to not turn a profit. Instead of paying lobbyists, perhaps they should keep that money.
So, these apps and their "social" rating systems sound very much like the CCP's (Mainland China) social judging system that can block you from a place to live.
I can't attest to anything grub hub related since I've always considered it a waste of money....As a relatively new fiddle player, I can say that the Devils solo is mostly just improvised by Charlie Daniels using certain formations often chromatically played at random and doesn't really need specific target notes to sound like a good devils solo. Johnny's solo on the other hand uses several very specific licks that need to be completely in tune to sound right...its really not that hard either but its arguably harder than the devils solo unless maybe if you're trying to play it note for note on the album which I don't think I ever saw Charlie Daniels do live so it's really a matter of perspective.....Hey, John brought it up!😋
This is no one's fault but restaurant owners....they swallowed the "app pill" instead of potenciating their normal way of bussiness, having delivery personnel on your own and offer your clients a better price, instead of giving 50% of your revenue to this mofos.......
"You gotta tip!" No we dont... Those delivery platform should pay their employees properly.
Food delivery apps are a product of laziness. Go get up and get your own food in person.
This is by far the greatest show
WORD! It's so hard to find where to tip. Some places use a different app outside of Uber Eats, Grubhub etc. just to get tips.
I waitressed for 30 years..... I always tip very very well..... I know what it means to have your income depending on the generosity of your customers!!! 😊❤❤
I never use these apps. I own a vehicle and am smart with money.
The slow march to the HungerGames.
Wow  Here in South Europe you dont have to tip the delivery. I do, only 3 Euros because I want to and I have become their best customer!!!!LOL
That Orphanage Side Hustle tangent had me ROLLING
There is a POS in our town that just leaves his car in the street, effectively double parking...
End the tip culture! Sure, pay the drivers well, but the tip culture is so annoying!
Don’t blame the customers as well, because the customers are also struggling citizens. They probably don’t tip because they are in a position where they can’t.
Fees
American capitalism... Rich people doesn't have such problems
It’s wild that DoorDash charges restaurants for the service when I assumed they paid for the service or it was free because it’s mutually beneficial. No wonder they hate dashers and personal shoppers
It is convenient for the customer but we are paying 50% more compared to ordering the same items in the store before tips. These apps are horrible
Just call the restaurant
I have never used food delivery other than pizza.
Engineering students could use that backpack
I appreciate that driver in the beginning mentioning people without licenses. I don't drive and I used to get doordash ALL the time just because it was the easiest way for me to get fast food. I recently moved within walking distance of a shopping area with plenty of places to eat, and I don't think I've used the app once since then.
Seniors helped
15 guys standing around does sound like a REST-aurant. ... ... D'ya get it? 😂😂
I want to believe John hits the green like Ms Piggy
I swear to God I expected him to say "if they had [specific dollar value of money], they could have bought this horse... and the reason I know that is..."
How does a company operating at a loss spend millions campaigning for that preposition?
I've never used one of these services. I just order through the restaurant's website and then go pick it up. And if I don't have time to go get food, then I just eat like a handful of blueberries or something. If I don't have that, then I just find random stuff in the cupboard and eat that, and if I don't have that then I just wait until I have time to go get food.
Law/loveless America
the bit about we cannot enjoying harry potter anymore hurts so much!lmao
I'm really shocked he didn't talk more about tips. Ubereats allows customers to change their tip up to an hour after delivery has been made. I have been baited with high tips that get edited to $0 MULTIPLE times.
Just a wild guess, but I suspect that food delivery is only profitable in urban environments.  It's just another example of how unsustainable suburbia is.  The Roosevelt island example is relatively rare for NYC, but basically standard in suburbia.
20 bone-in wings in Los Angeles from Wingstop comes out to $54 on DoorDash 🫡
Nah, one time on DD, this 304 dropped my food off at the wrong spot and the guy came out and told her it was the wrong spot. She still took off and told me to go get it. You only have to get the food to me and I give you a 5 star. It can be late, cold, whatever... Just get it to me.
The bag thing is true. We have a food delivery service bring us meals in bags we can keep, we have a couple to someone who does food delivery for one of the apps.
👍
Had the same realization with the "Devil went down to Georgia."
I don't understand how this ,your usual 'startup' corporate greed, leads to:   You have to Tip!  If anything this again is a reason why tipping has to stop, give workers incentives not to work for wage pushing companies and show these corporate types that we(the costumers) will not subsidise their greed.  Now that's not a general solution to this mess, regulations, unions, awareness and busting bad bussines practices is still necessary and people who need these jobs will still cross 3 bridges for 1 piece of cake but we can make sure that they get fairly paid for their work and not by some arbitrary mood from the customer.  If I can help it don't use any if these gig-apps until they get their shit together.  These things make me happy I grew up in a society with mild to no tipping culture, and i worked in cycling delivery but for the wage not the meager Tip.
I literally just signed up for DoorDash, let’s see how I’m screwing up my life now…
lol watching this while debating on using the $0 delivery coupon on the McDonald’s app.
In Seattle it is almost double the cost of your order for protections for workers put in.  This made helped to drop more than 50% of orders.  This service isn’t worth it, it’s made me refuse to use the services like a majority of others.  Fuck tipping this unhealthy industry
These apps are also stupid expensive. I deleted mine from my phone months ago because they’re too expensive. I’ve saved money and lost a little weight eating my own food at home.
Love this! We live a good way out of town, and we have used delivery services a few times and always tip knowing the driver went the extra 12 minutes (on a very pretty drive) to get to us. Bonus, fresh eggs or almonds from our trees if you want them. Cash tips need to be standard because taxes on the drivers will eat up their income.
I deliver for Uber eats in NYC. This brings tears to my eyes . It’s a very hard life . In the last 300 deliveries I’ve received about 20 tips . The changes have hurt us and not helped.  Nyc please remember to tip your Uber eats delivery driver.   Thank you for the light on this 🙏
For all those non tippers, take into consideration that your wait person pays 8% in taxes on their gross sales, so when you don't tip they are still paying the government taxes on your meal.  On top of getting maybe 2.13 a hour.
ALSO!!!!! If you are driving for Door Dash and told you "have insurance through them" it's only if you have the food in your car, you're delivering it, AND you are at fault for the accident. Not if you are not at fault, and if you are picking up the order. CHECK YOUR INSURANCE POLICY PLEASE!!!
Capitalism is NOT sustainable
The super high costs of delivery already is insane. The fact that it is terrible for everyone is crazy. I'm thinking I should never order delivery.
Microsoft bought Skype and drove it into the ground.
I was a server for a long time.  I know many people in the restaurant industry.  They all hate these apps.  I just avoid using these apps all together.
I never purposely use these delivery services.  Sadly, some of the pizza chains in my area use them.  It's abysmal that these services are ruining everything.
Food delivery is what made people LAZY, whiny bitches past decades. Everyone cries they don't have the money to buy a house and live but instead of cooking for 200 a month they spend 1000 a month on ordering...  that's a wasted mortgage right there... Restaurants are a FUKING LUXERY not family they are a FOR PROFIT company. All while not even paying their "family" a living wage and guilt trip you into tipping which then sometimes gets taken from them. Delivery apps take this one stepo further and make the delivery person work for a shit wage which then add a checkbox to tip them instead of just paying that that living wage... What also is absurd is that you can only rate either the delivery or the food not both.  There should be 2 ratings and 2 comment boxes at the very least.
Let the apps die, some restaurants are going to be able to afford to have that guy standing on wait and the people that need it can use those, not really optimal, but neither is this system where there are horrible losses for most people involved.
To 'fight back', a lot of the local restaurants in my town have started offering delivery. Many of them let you order through their websites. It far and away less expensive than all the fees piled on by Doordash.
Some overlapping themes. People need to force themselves to continue working when they should be healing because they can afford medical bills and can't save up savings and people relying on tips for income is really dumb.  We really hate low level employees  in this country.
All gig work is a scam. I drove for UBER and Lyft for a couple of years. I would like to think I made a profit, but after all the costs I doubt it. Tipping is also a shitty way to compensate someone. It might work in a restaurant, but I don't think it works in other industries.
Never used a food delivery app and never will. First of all, it's bad enough that you're ordering the food from a place who could do God knows what to it as they're preparing it (I worked in restaurants as a teenager and saw some things), secondly, it's being delivered by a 3rd party entity who could be a wacko and do whatever to it before they get it to you. I saw a story earlier this year where a guy broke the seal and ate some of the food of his deliveries. No, not doing it. If I can't pick it up myself, I always have a fridge and freezer full of food, thank you very much.
I've never used any delivery app.    Though.. that's bc I'm too poor to order food. So. Yay.
😂😂😂
That DoorDash CEO thinks he's mf Bruce Wayne with that "start an orphanage" shit 🤣
I've never used a delivery app. Not into the idea that some rando has my food in their seat probably snacking on it and not subject to follow health codes. I've never ordered delivery of any kind either.
I do food delivery on the side for extra cash and so many times I've gone to a restaurant and they said we don't even work with that company anymore. Or they even said we never ever done business with that company.
The other day, I placed an order for groceries. Never opened my windows (working from home that day). I tip the basic 20% in the app, but then give extra afterward depending on how things go. Just before the guy got here with my groceries, I opened the curtains and was shocked to see it was POURING RAIN! I felt bad for placing the order before knowing the weather. The total of my tip was $23 because of my grocery order. I apologized when he got there and let him know I didn't realize it was raining and gave him another $10 in cash. *He said, "Ma'am, it's my **_job."_** If you hear anyone call these hard working people's work "gigs" or "side hustles" they need to be smacked immediately!*
Funny these apps are "not profitable" but then spend millions to push a bill? I'd like to see what all the executives are making since this app "isn't profitable".  I've only used these apps a few times and damn, the service was complete crap.
Customers can rate you 1 star because they do not like your shoes. It is so arbitrary. Tips can be removed after deliveries, that is the worst.
I must be in the minority of people who hasn't used Doordash or Uber Eats. I had groceries delivered once, and it was ok, but they made choices I wouldn't have made, so I just do my own shopping and food pickup if I'm not making my food at home. I usually just make my own food.
Fine, I ll tip
the willingness to spend millions of dollars to make sure you're not legally obligated to pay people a living wage when it would actually costs way less to just pay them a living wage is a whole other level of evil and I hate how normalized it is
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
You failed with your tip recommendation - you are just encouraging the corporate vultures to tighten the thumbscrews even more. Tipping culture is just a modern form of slavery - letting the workers glean the fields after the harvest has been gathered.
So, in essence, American Tip culture is a way for companies to enable consumers to underpay their own employees. All for the benefit of being able to display lower prices. Kinda fits with the whole "taxes not included" nonsense. So it's all about pretense and exploiting your next one.   But no, governments and worker rights are evil communism invented by satan. /s
When you only see PoC or other minorities or migrants work in a sector you know shit is fucked up
Ive never used any food delivery apps and refuse to do so today. I barely trust fast food restaurants, I'm not trusting some random person from my town either.
I knew this black guy who would give all the white delivery drivers 1 star ratings just to screw with them.  I mean WTF is wrong with you to want to do that to someone just trying to make a living?
11:40 My kids and I had that conversation lately and John is full of shit. The devil barely plays anything other than sawing his fiddle. Most of the work is done by his backup band. Johnny may be riffing on old songs but he does 100% of the work and this deserves the reward. But let's face it, what the fuck is a poor kid from Georgia going to do with a solid gold fiddle? How is he going to sell it without drawing a lot of unwanted attention? Is he going to get the full value?  It's a shit situation all around.  Oh yeah, fuck delivery apps. I can get the food faster by getting it myself and I have some sort of recourse if there's a mistake. I also don't have sketchy delivery drivers pissing on my trash cans because they don't have time to use an actual toilet. I'll NEVER use a delivery app if I can get the food myself.
As always, in idea to HELP people (i.e consumers/convenience) FUCKs OVER people. Unless the independent contractor is starting an orphanage, of course. That being said. I don't use these apps and won't. Ill get up and drive 10 minutes to get my single slice of cake.
I now have more context for this exchange from TeamFourStar’s Buu Bits shorts:  Majin Buu:  Buu want DoorDash. Hercule Satan:  Oh come on, they’re overpriced. Majin Buu:  Uber Eats! Hercule Satan:  That’s worse! Majin Buu:  Postmates! Hercule Satan:  THEY’RE ALL BAD, BUU! Majin Buu:  THEN BUU EAT DRIVER! Hercule Satan:  Just…use your magic to turn rocks into food! Majin Buu:  (gasp)  Satan is genius.
We should make a publicly funded delivery app with independent contractors as delivery drivers that get paid a decent wage. Cut out the middle man for the good of all of us involved. The only funding needed would be for the IT team that manages the app and any maintenance costs.
I'm like miss piggy the way I'm hitting this green? BARSSSSS 😂😂😂
Re: The Devil Went Down To Georgia BOTH of their solos suck. It's incredibly UNimpressive on both sides.  But as a musician and composer, I can assure you that Johnny showed more prowess. Quoting the folk songs > scratching up the string without real aim.
Great song and the Devil definitely outplays the cowboy
I did the job in Germany. A few companies have tried to run the drivers as self-employed. However, action was taken relatively quickly, as bogus self-employment is prohibited. If you only work for one company and they tell you how to do everything, you are simply not self-employed. There are still problems in this area, but not nearly as big.
I can't even use these apps if I wanted to. Restaurants mess up my order like 40-60% of the time (depending on the franchise) so I always need to check the food right away. These services can't check the food (and I don't want them to) so the food would probably be wrong most of the time. Not worth it.
In this day and age any new company that comes out you can guarantee there is something shady going on especially if they're making money
It sucks that if the quality of the food is bad the delivery driver gets the bad review not the restaurant.
I mean, to be fair, getting 15.50$ on the 20.50$ isn't too bad a deal for higher visibility and ready access to delivery drivers at all times.  The Grubhub and Doordash thing is insane though.
Holy FUCK. That Devil Went Down to Georgia joke had me hysterically laughing outloud like a goddamned maniac. I'm standing outside, and I'm pretty sure I just woke up the whole neighborhood lolol
I stopped using these apps when I made a $15 fast food order that came out to $45 with all the markups and fees etc. At that point I was a big nope and just got off my ass and went in person
I'm baked thoroughly.
The problem with millennial subsidie going to is consumers is that it's being paid for by the workers not the companies. And the workers are millennials so it's just wealth redistribution with the companies as the winners because they don't have to pay.
I don't agree with how hard he is pushing the tip;  I always tip but it is the reason companies get away with not paying their employees a decent wage.  It has become a weird way companies pass on the expense of employees to the consumer AND the government takes a chunk of the tip too.  They even assume tips now so if you don't tip you are actually costing the person money because the government will take money from them that they didn't receive.  Tipping used to be a dollar or two (it actually started with a dime for appreciation) to show appreciation for great service, but now it is an expected tithe based on the % of the bill (which the person tipped had little to do with, they didn't cook it, they just handed it to you and the effort is pretty much the same for one slice of cake as it is for a feast).  Hearing him perpetuate the push for tips (which media has started to do) just reminds me he is just another tool to push what the 1% wants us to think and do for Their benefit.
No, you don't have to tip. the main source of income for delivery persons shouldn't be tipping, it should be the apps PAYING THEM! Some countries do have those apps and tipping is not in their culture, this could had been such a great episode, so sad that the message is wrong here. If you need an 8+ hour "side hussle" then is not a gig, it's an actual job so these apps should be treating these people as corporate employees with a salary, health insurance, and all benefits.
While it’s infuriating as a pedestrian in NYC to be dodging delivery bikers going the wrong way on sidewalks, I definitely recognize the pressure they’re under. Idk what the solution is but the apps are the real culprits.
I love how the same Americans who tip 25% every time they go out to eat are the same ones mad at Oliver for asking you to tip drivers. Its only with delivery drivers that people insist these app companies give out livable wages. It sounds like you all are just being cheap.
y'all need to pay attention to zomato and swiggy in India.
Maybe God was making fun of people saying hurt not the oil 🛢️🧴or the wine 🍷 . Can’t drink and drive or jack off all day while everyone else accomplishes the work. They should give longer lunch breaks then “Let my people go” would be a reality and less people could be doing unprofitable jobs like I do but I do still want a place in society. I can sit and look pretty like a cat 🐈 jk I’m fat lol 😂 not terribly though
start an orphanage is wild LOL especially when being option 2 after 1 was buying a gift
TIP! At least $10. (Yes, despite all the raised prices and fees--don't punish the driver.) The real story is far grimmer than what's even covered here. It's dark, man. Delivery drivers can literally lose money on deliveries if the tip isn't robust. If you don't tip, it's like being okay with a slave serving you.   Things not covered in this piece: huge percentage of drivers who rent their car from the delivery platforms or from other related apps (so you don't break even until late in the day if you pay daily, or mid-week if you pay weekly); delayed paydays so drivers can end up homeless while they wait for payment--and lose their rental; limits on hours; being forced to take bad deliveries which will be a loss (not worth time/gas)--lest we upset the algorithm and get no more orders for the day/night.... I could go on, unfortunately.
So I work in the point of sale industry and have helped integrate resturaunts into delivery apps like this. It can be a real mess because of how sites build their menu data. I've had to deal with duplicate items, missing items, junk data on the menu, and orders missing items.
The facts the skinny white guy at the end described ordering the food as us getting something back is baffling. You pay double the price for the food then if you just went and got it but somehow you’re getting something back. It’s like when you spent $100 on something you don’t need because it’s on sale and then you just try to tell yourself you saved money. You spent more money than you needed to
Don't have they fool you they make money if they didn't they wouldn't still be around
Thought the extra cost was going to the driver but they bank that and charge restaurants on top of that without making profit seems like a bad business idea
I'm gonna rate the bad ones 5 stars from now and the good ones 1 star just to fuck with the system.
While encouraging to tip is certainly admirable,  how does one guarantee that the money will go directly to the delivery workers?
Go get a real job and let people get their own food.
Lol my delivery driver drove into my garage door.
On occasion, I work with the Uber Driver app.  Those turds keep trying to get me to deliver food and keep rejecting it. They would ask me to deliver food for a few dollars after driving long distances and waiting for long periods on the hope that I MIGHT get a tip to cover the expenses.  😐
Omg "You're watching 'Numbers Being Yelled At You', with Human Squidward" 😂😂😂😂 I'm dying
Around here the vast majority of places listed on Grubhub have their own full time delivery staff, it's mostly places like the big chains that rely on the "gig" workers and as a result they tend to be both the most expensive and have the longest wait times.
restaurants should put a flyer in the order with the food saying " the app is taking all our profits. if possible, please order directly with us in the future"
This is so crazy to me lol I had no idea these weren’t even profitable lol
Similar to Lyft and Uber, who have destroyed the NYC medallion cab system. Yet, most Lyft and Uber drivers are migrants who can make a decent wage, and it’s extremely convenient if you don’t have time to take the subway. A tough issue.
Sad that most people who don’t tip, will probably never watch this video. Stay safe, everyone
These apps are modern day slave labor
I have no issue delivering in bad weather. I would just be disturbed by how many people don’t tip or tip $1 when someone is bringing you food 10 miles in a blizzard to your $800,000 house
Bottom line here. Gig apps all around are obvious signs of late atage capitalism. They are bad for everyone involved and we should stop using them outright.
Restaurants aren't taking the burden of those app fees. They literally up-charge every single item order $2 to the customer so a $10 meal cost the customer $12+delivery fees and taxes but nice try.
Algorithm
I doordash a lot because I don’t wanna drive drunk, and I always tip 20%, but this job is unattractive because the drivers are independent contractors. It’s not really a career/full time job either, depending on where you live/work. You don’t know your income for certain, cause people don’t always tip. It’s a side job, imo
They funnel the money to other places to look poor and avoid taxes. Just look at the highest incoming costpositions and you find the Cash.
Chipotle being concerned with food safety is wild. You know it has to be bad. Chipotle is the only restaurant where I get food poisoning from. And it's every time. I try it like once a year, because surely they fixed stuff by then, and it always fails. I always get sick. It's the only restaurant that's ever done that.
Why isn't there a reasonable limit to lobbying contributions, and personal donations in democracies?
I generally prefer to tip in cash so folks don't need to declare anything to the tax man.
You know I was in an orphanage and  And it was bad enough but making it for-profit yeah that would make it worse.
Yay another episode of existential dread by Johnnie long nose.
Thank you John, for saying what I always felt. Not about Delivery Services but about “The Devil went down to Georgia” I also thought the Devil did a better presentation. Who cares if Granny’s dog bites. (FYI of course he bites , he has teeth doesn’t he?)
Side hustles is just another word for job.
I have seen enough. Shut down all food delivery apps forever!! It is not the way. Its bad bad bad. Modern day slavery.
John Oliver is definitely a bottom.............dweller.
Never used this crap and never will
In the 70's I worked for a pizza parlor as a delivery driver, funnest job I ever had. They paid every Friday in cash, not much. The tips were low because I was in a college town, but the side benefits were great. I was invited to almost every party, I was given joints in lew of a tip and there was always the lonely girl in the dorm that would order a pizza right before quitting time, my boss understood and would tell me to just bring the truck back in the morning. Greatest job a young guy could have. These food delivery apps are killing great jobs and replacing them with low pay work.
these high prices are not good for us john.. all the food is more $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The problem with delivery apps is that the middleman (the delivery app companies) are keeping too much money.  The drivers can't make enough to cover their costs and make it worthwhile, while the customers feel like they're being charged too much.
Just a consumer here. It was clutch a couple years ago when we couldn't go anywhere. With the help of them and Instacart or Shipt, it was amazingly useful.  Now we're in the habit of using it and, to be honest, I'd say 40-50% of the time the order is wrong or missing items. I get a lot of credit back on orders, which I'm sure doesn't help anyone, but then you're left without that meal and have to go get it yourself.  So we've started just picking it up ourselves, asking if they have they're own delivery (like was mentioned) or (shocking) cooking more at home.  The latter is so much cheaper anyway.  I feel all these errors are just endemic of the race to make money culture.
@14:22 .  Hey translator whats the word for battery? Translator high AF ..umm batería
I worked for Lyft for seven years, and they got worse and worse and worse, penalizing me for everything they could, real or imagined, cutting my pay until I left out of frustration and retired.  These days I don't even own a car because they are just so darned expensive, and use Lyft to get around.  I tip the driver every time, because I know how little they are getting paid.  For a twelve to fifteen dollar ride, for example, the driver gets three dollars.
Novel idea... How about we guarantee a base living wage for all workers, regardless of the job, that does not use tips in the calculations?  Maybe then we can turn tips back into what they are supposed to be, which is a gratuity for beyond-basic, excellent work? Wouldn't that be nice...
The fuck is it called "millennial subsidy"? Call it boomers teach bad finance "
hold on, are the facts about leeches true????
How did we ever eat without delivery apps? We've stopped using them.
Ya when i di grubhub i refuse every order where we have to and pay it with their credit card. They just take too long and arent worth the money
It's easy get rid of tipping. Then tell the delivery services that they have to pay an hourly wage to their contract workers and give them options for insurance.
I’ll never understand overpaying for sweaty food.
I stopped using delivery apps when my $15 meal cost $30 after fees and tip.
I managed a restaurant that was not set up for delivery and had no contracts with delivery apps. We constantly had grub hub drivers come in and try to order food for delivery, but we always turned them away. It took months of repeatedly calling grub hub to finally get us off the app.  We were also approached by Uber Eats and they told us they would take 35% of our sales. The smarmy salesman told us to just increase prices to make up for it. I kindly told him to piss off.
Had to give the devil went down to Georgia a listen and I have to agree with John. The devil just brings so much more to the table there.
I've literally never used any delivery apps. Never will.
I find it very difficult to believe a CEO of a company or whatever she is an executive of a company, that she's not pulling money out of that. That the executives of that company aren't pulling money out. Just because something isn't profitable doesn't mean the executives of that company aren't getting away like Bandits. And I question that assumption anyways. it doesn't cost all that much to upkeep the software once it's built out, an upcharge on the food from the restaurant alone, they are getting at least half of that. Oh the poor companies and Executives of these companies, give me a break! What's really happening is they are squeezing the restaurants they're squeezing the delivery drivers and they are getting away like Bandits.
Ban tipping in the United States. If you must include a service fee, so be it. But stop pressuring customers to donate an unspecified amount on top of it because you don't want to pay your staff.
I have more fun listening to Johnny, thand devils fiddle is very scratchy and hurts my misogynistic ears, love that song as a Georgian
People are not as smart as they use to be 😢, you fall for it every time 😅
I'm the baked dude basically, I'm either that or working lol.   I tip based on what I'm ordering and how far away it is. I always try and stay within a 3.X mile radius of me (and thats just as much for me to make sure my food arrives warm) and I'll tip the max recommended by the app usually 5-10.    in the case of bigger orders like a few times I ordered some groceries.  I ordered from Aldi's recently and the DoorDash app recommended on my $90 order of groceries that I give a $9 tip,  if it was a bag of expensive fastfood that would be fine, its only 2 miles away and its a bag of food.  But groceries? This man is shopping for me and carrying multiple bags.  No I clicked the manual button and gave that poor man $25 tip.    Now if someone screws up my delivery I will 100%  I will give a negative review if you screw up.  Thankfully DoorDash lets you review the restaurant and the delivery driver separately as the restaurant messes up WAY more often than the driver.   However if you pickup my food first and then drive around pickup up 3 other orders and then proceed to deliver all the other orders first and I get my food 45 minutes (from the point you picked it up) later stone cold, you are 100% getting the lowest possible review.
Time to learn how grubhub makes their food out of orphaned puppies or something.
And if you work through "gigs" to make a living, there is no cost of living allowance in your taxes. It's about 22% off the top even if you're way under the poverty line. My 2023 taxes had NINE forms.
Ordered a pizza with doordash and it never arrived. Called the restaurant directly to get pizza, it arrived.
Maybe there should be a delivery worker union.
Also I haven’t been able to get a job where I haven’t been greeted by the God of Judgement at every door since working for Grubhub is the BEAST that in for judgement really in it for soup? That the mighty beast that deceives everyone would cause discrimation of judgement against workers trying to find a new job that doesn’t involve animal cruelty? I mean the soups gotta come from somewhere. There are a lot of vegetarian 🥗 options too. I’m not judging ⚠️(probably why I have said so much awful shit cause I know it doesn’t matter it falls under free dumb of speech which you need in this world if your going to use metaphor or make allegory or speak reproachfully against a judgement or a fear of judgement) I assume the judgmental beast system that likes cheap labor and keeping its employees out of the regular job market is doing this on a spiritual level for some purpose hopefully greater then soup 🍲 hey if I don’t have a choice I’d rather deliver Grubhub then be Grubhub but just like Sophie I guess we all have a choice. Maybe the beast is a sadist and just likes being consumed or maybe it’s a vicious cycle of judgement and consumerism who knows why everything occurs?
my main reason to use these services is "dinner failed" we're not the best cooks here. I will say though, i love ordering in through weather i'd hate to go through under any circumstances. the human suffering just makes the food taste so much better.
If only there was some system in place for healthcare, which would increase taxes, but would yet be lower than paying healthcare premiums every month 🤔
About the negative reviews. let me say if you put my food right in front of my door, I mean literally right in front of it so it gets stepped on when there is a huge white table sitting by my door that I put in the notes to put the food on. Yeah, you are getting a negative review, sorry not sorry you are dumb.   I don't know about all the apps, but I know grubhub when you leave a review you are asked about service, delivery driver, food, etc.
Ok... Nobody is going to talk about the $184M horse?
Can't spell millennial without 3 massive "L"s  Ain't that the truth
I don’t understand how people can afford this.  It’s so much cheaper to just go get it myself.  And much cheaper to make it myself.
I've never used one & never will.  My Chinese father taught me to cook.  I taught my 6 kids how to plan,  purchase, prepare,  & serve whole foods.  I worked full time & cooked dinner.  $150/wk for a family of 8. My family & wallet were both healthy.
I've never used one and I never plan to
0:01 Hey HBO, if you release these clips on Thursdays then we'll pirate the entire show on Mondays. If anyone needs assistance in learning how to pirate Last Week Tonight (and indeed any other HBO shows), I'm happy to help.
I stop driving Uber because of the blatant price manipulation that company did in this area. When Uber charges a rider $50 for a ride and you get less than $7 for that same ride, it was over for me.
This is a reupload. The original contained the news segment related to Trump. Did you include it originally on purpose to bring more attention to the news segment, or was it accidental? I'm confused.
how can re-selling [open] food from a restaurant/bakery/confiserie (chocolate shop) be legal? apart from the obvious risks to food safety this kind of re-selling in itself of small specially prepared food packages by a third company on a regular basis should be illegal. do US lawmakers not care? or do they wait for a customer with food poisoning to sue the app company into oblivion?
22:09 Don’t forget won’t get to collect Social Security 😂😂😢
Stop workign for websites that give you nothing but the app. Also who the fck are these morons paying $30 for a Burger King jr whopper????
Grubhub, called 'thuisbezorgd' (home delivered) has way to much power and influence in the Netherlands. I always try to order directly from the restaurant so they don't have to pay Grubhub.
Wages not tips.
Never used these apps and never will. Don't feed the sharks.
2:41 "What happened Skype?" Message from Skype CEO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI0w_pwZY3E #CollegeHumor #Dropout
I'd like to correct one error. The apps ARE profitable, their unprofitability on PAPER is entirely by choice. They do this by hiding their profit through stock buybacks (Per their financial statements, Doordash spent $750 million on stock buybacks in 2023).   Any company can pretend to be unprofitable if they just use all their operating margin on stock buybacks (a dumb waste of money that only serves to make their execs look good). While we can't say for sure why they WANT to appear to be unprofitable, I doubt it's coincidence they like to use their "unprofitable" argument to avoid regulation and minimum wages for their delivery drivers.
Funny how their businesses are operating at a loss and the CEOs get wages in the hundreds of thousands if not millions.
i find it funny that Americans thinks tips are the way to go, so it's the customer fault not tipping, thankfully in my country tips are 100% optional you give them on a exceptional situation, it has nothing to do with the employee salary, the company HAS to pay him a fair wage and not lean on customers that have to pay for the services AND supplement the worker salary themselves!! it's insane that you Americas allow this !!!
My brother was working for DoorDash in L.A.  He got ran over by a car crossing the street for a delivery.  No financial help from DoorDash to pay for the extensive medical bills.
I once delivered a $10 cup of queso dip for a $10 tip. That guy really needed queso.
$8 in fees - before tip - to deliver a $15 meal. How exactly is this good for the consumer?
My brother who works at a restaurant always tells me to order directly from the restaurant because these apps take most of the profit.
He failed to mention how expensive it is to use these. There are service fees, delivery fees & they jack up the prices of the food. You are gonna spend 10 to 20 dollars more than of you pick it up yourself. Also, most of the drivers are dumb as dirt or can't speak english. I can't tell you how many times they couldn't find my house or just delivered to the wrong address. This is why I haven't use any of these services in well over a year & I won't use them again. ThIeves & morons.  See SNL this past Saturday. They did a sketch about food delivery & it couldn't have been more accurate.
I've never used a delivery app.  Thank goodness I have reliable transpotation.
As someone who still has those godawful scratchy blue and yellow polo shirts hiding in a box in the attic......thanks for the flashback, John.
I knew a prophet that described that man on the bike 🚲 years ago. Do you have insider information John Oliver? Is this really the heaven test cause I may have failed or passed maybe for driving in bad weather with such poor visibility in my car and driving on faith alone with all messed up idiot lights. When I took my drivers test they said I passed then they said no you failed and then I came back later and they said what the hell you can drive even though I went down the wrong side of the road just prior. I could see how it would be different for bikers I would not want to have been biking in NY time is relative so if someone had been biking in with a hurt foot 🦶 it seems like I got the better part having a car although I’d probably be dead or a nuisance to someone who I couldn’t have been to during that time if I didn’t have a shell to weather me from the elements. That is a weird expression though come to think of it if you are being “weathered” from the elements and that also means sheltered and the Bible talks of a con-founding of the elements I wonder 💭. I used to have a Nick name “The Foot” although it was not my friend Nick who came up with it it was a gift to me like a Saint Nick would have given me. I did have a friend Nick Simms he probably would have enjoyed that name he was like a saint too. Honestly the name was relative to nothing that made sense ever it was such a bad name even the guy who came up with it regrets ever forging that name. Although the name was better in short then in long. I don’t even want to pronounce it’s full title. The foot is good enough although it is so not…  Also idk why this comment has been flagged by YouTube I hope they keep things more respectful in the future I give them a flag back (idk 🏳️‍🌈🏴‍☠️🏁⛳️🇨🇦🇨🇭🎉)
Gosh, love the show but you all missed a HUGE part of this story. Most cities now have a locally owned Food Delivery company. There are 1000s across the US. My company does the opposite of all the negatives you pointed out. We provide the service 100% free to restaurants, meet everyone we hire and guarantee tips for drivers. I really hope someone from the show sees this! Missed a great opportunity to talk about Supporting Local and small bussiness.
Thats why i dont even have any of these apps on my phone. No uber, no door dash none of them. I get it myself ir have the business deliver. But i guess compared to some im lucky enough to do that.
Sorry John FUCK TIPPING
I’m ashamed to say this episode made me want food and I used DD. I’m the problem
You missed a very big problem! Women drivers ARE NOT SAFE! Female drivers were sick of being molested or Graped and stopped accepting deliveries to men.  So Men are now  using feminine sounding names on the app to make female drivers deliver to them so they can assault them.  A lot of female drivers are now bringing either their husbands or even just guy friends with them on all deliveries and carrying pew pews to try and protect themselves!
Incase you didn't know. (no knock on you John and Writers for the joke) Skype was bought by Microsoft before the pandemic and was already shifting everything to Teams. Thats the business side anyways, consumer-wise i guess people just liked Zoom more. But Microsoft was already letting go of Skype as a product overall.
never used this crap once even.
Lmfao
I will always go inside and order. I can say since these companies appeared I've ordered maybe twice as I dislike paying more money.
Anxiety has to be like so so bad to be baked out of your mind and functionally host a show! 😂 such a mood
I have never ordered through those delivery apps… it cost double to get your food
14:55 Shout-out to my favorite Thai dish!  If a Thai restaurant has good pad ke mow then the rest of their menu is likely good too.
I'm positive I know the guy that ordered that cake!
Woo
19:00 at this point we need a discussion more based on "mandatory tipping" and tipping culture in general
I've never felt more like tech companies/CEOs are no different than the robber barons and their industrial revolution empires than I do now.
I have to agree with John, the Devil kicked his ass.
Guys .. millennials are approaching 50 years old. It’s not us you’re always pointing to.
Door dash to the max
AND EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH LEVELS OF PERSONAL DEBT—-it’s because people waste their money on crap like food delivery
Tipping culture is a scam where peope are guilt tripped into subsidizing wages because capitalists refuse to pay a living wage. Businesses benefit from tips the most.
I was a driver, almost every day. Some days 12 hours a day. Absolutely awful.
Rating people... Black Mirror had a whole episode about this called Nosedive. Probably the best episode of the season, hell probably one of the best episodes of anything anywhere. It's chilling to this day.
Great video, though I have to say it is somewhat comical to say that consumers are getting such a great deal when a $16 order costs $32 after fees, tip, and increased price of items. The system is definitely not working, but paying double for the convenience of delivery is wild. Glad I stopped ordering delivery ages ago.
My parents used to own a business not a food business but I could totally see my father or grandfather not wanting to work with a service like these and they would be pissed if they did it anyways.
If you're ordering out during extreme weather... just don't.
In addition to what has been said here. I think that we should get rid of tips and just pay fair wages. It's ridiculous that tipping exists as a guilt payment to compensate for bad wages.
I already pay twice the price of the food for it to be delivered and now I need to tip even more? I can’t do that.
Regarding 'The Devil Went Down to Georgia' - it didn't actually matter who 'won' that fiddle battle, because if you go by Christian mythology, pride is a sin. As an immortal, the Devil can afford to play the long game. Johnny lost that battle the moment he picked up his bow, the house always wins.  ...maybe I have thought about that song too much.
Why can’t we be like Japan and just eliminate tipping and pay fair wages?
another option is to introduce tip for all the workers making our lifes easier, like amazon delivery drivers, your landlord, the baristas in coffee shops, hairdresser, cashiers at all your shopping locations, like groceries, bakery, clothes store, etc.  the point is, tipping culture is bad when the worker is depending on it, change the system!
Just go get your food.
As a european person I do not understand the tipping culture in the US. As a customer, it is not my fault that your boss doesn't want to pay you a fair wage, fight for it, frankly I am not tipping you for doing your job, and even worse; Do you expect me to pay a 20% although there is no difference between serving a 400€ and a 20€ bottle of wine? NOOOOOOOOOOOPE.  In this case, that john talks about a person having to cycle maaaany miles to deliver a single piece of cake, again, it is not my problem, that person decided to take that order and knew the distance me as a customer did not specifically requested that person. What if the delivery guy is just next to the place I ordered and had to drive for less than 5 minutes to bring the food?
They are not making money because their CEOs and upper management are milking the cow untill it dies. That's why they spend millions bribing.. oh sorry, the american term is "lobbying" politicians. They want to keep this gig running until it doesn't anymore. The people in leading roles will be leaving the sinking ship sitting on their acquired riches and everone who gets screwed.. well good luck getting your money, company is bankrupt. Oopsie.
Companies always use reviews to reflect poorly on employees, and not themselves. Even if the metric tracked is not even about the employees that helped the customer. I used to work at Home Depot, and any score under a 9 was considered bad. Even if the employee was praised in the blurb.
This is the first John Oliver video I disagree with. Customers don't benefit from the jacked up prices on delivery apps. And given the low quality of delivery drivers. It's very hard to empathize with them.
The Skype answer was pretty obvious. Guess who bought Skype all those years ago? Microsoft. Microsoft also owns Teams. So it's basically them trying to slowly sunset Skype for their other newer product.
Even if you try to bypass the apps by calling the restaurant, many STILL use Doordash or similar to deliver your food. Jewel used to have delivery trucks that delivered groceries straight from the warehouse; now they use Doordash. The worst part is the good companies that actually paid employees well and have much better service, like Peapod grocery delivery, have went away. I don't know why, but the services that are worse for employees and customers alike are the most prevalent.
Idk food delivery apps have really helped a lot of people. They get a bad rap. I’ve had a lot of people deliver to me or be Uber driver that don’t speak English and say it would be impossible for them to get this high of paying job in their country
I always call the restaurant or go in person so I know my food is fresh. The restaurant then makes it's full amount and I get hot fresh food. Also, makes me self reliant and not lazy.
The main reason I use a food app is for the convenience of being able to use a credit card for my meal, none of the restaurants in my area take credit cards over the phone and they don't have their own websites for ordering.
I'm not a regular delivery service customer, but I should not be held responsible for determining the value of the energy expelled by my delivery person. If I was to order something, I would NEVER expect that the "driver" would be peddaling a bicycle to my door. Hopping in a car and driving for 3 miles is far less effort that cycling 3 miles over bridges. This whole business model is encouraging the crazy tipping culture in this country that needs to stop!
Not sure i'm glad about living in an area not serviced by these apps. On the one hand, i don't see drivers being abused by these companies.   On the other hand, i see the same people who would be drivers get abused by their managers and exploited by people who only care about making money over running a good business.  Profit margins for food are abysmal. It takes a special type to run a non-exploitative restaurant.  I grew up in a town of elderly Karens,  too, so a .25 cent tip was all you could expect for exemplary service. And you didn't dare give less than exemplary service unless you were the boss's favorite. Yhat boss was very exploitative of their workers, hiring young girls to keep the perverts happy. Then ignored when those girls got grabbed. Of course, our only other kob opportunity was the nursing home, where we basically put up with the same treatment.  Apparently penises are a necessary part of thistle digging... never needed one to dig thistles on my grandparents farm...  It'd be nice to see politicians work to prevent these tech bros from from moving so fast and breaking things. Especially when they are breaking things that have terrible infrastructure in our area as it is. Inatead we get to watch Loony Goons tossing dynamite around while a few adults struggle to keep up with the mess...
I prefer old taxi's  I want my taxi driver to openly say some racist shit so I can fully ignore him without feeling bad about it and we both leave the ride hating eachother but we got shit to do so neither wastes time on it
I love making minorities bring me food in inclement weather 😂😂
I feel like i have seen this youtube video before. lol
I have never used food delivery services, I never will. Its an insane concept to me that I would never trust.
THANK YOU. This is a needed talk!  Also....what happened to uploading the whole episode? Did that just...stop?
Skype was bought by Microsoft, who already owned Teams.  That is what happened to Skype.
In the last 4 months the CEO of Uber, Dara K was offered stock options of 50 million to keep his newly public company if he kept stock at a certain price. He lowered drivers pay at $2 an offer to accomplish this. Screwing drivers, customers with high mile , low pay, no tip offers. He removed drivers profit to accomplish HIS goal. If you ordered an Italian dinner, it is going to cost you $2 in gas to pick it up yourself and drive it back home. Why would a driver pick up your food and drive to to your door for $2? Why would you expect someone to work for free? Report on that Jon. Big fan of your humor.
As a millenial the only reason I was able to put a downpayment on a house was because 1. I got a medical settlement. 2. My mother went half in with me so we could use her credit score. It took me 2 years of splitting the mortgage with her before I was able to graduate and get a better paying job so I could take over the payments in full.
Part of my experience with these apps as a driver is that customers often aren’t aware of how far away the restaurant they’re ordering from is. They just see food that looks good or has good reviews and place an order. The apps often put places at the top of the list that are 10 miles away which if you’re delivering in a city area takes a lot of time. It can also take you out of an area where it would be easy to get your next order. Meaning you have to spend time and gas/energy getting back to an area where you’re more likely to start getting orders again.
Fetynl doesn't smell lol
I don't like how more and more of these jobs are being handed over to ppl with dbl accounts and letting migrants use em. Just wrong
The rideshare apps have similar problems, both with how they treat drivers and customers.  Uber (and Lyft, I believe) announced they are pulling out of Minnesota because of a recently enacted minimum wage law. A driver cooperative based in New York had announced they were expanding to MSP in the wake of this.
Made $80 with 5 orders consistently for 3 weeks delivering with the new $15 hourly they were offering.  First the hourly changed to 14 something. Then they would just cancel my scheduled hours. Finally, after driving in for the usual morning coffee deliveries and my hourly option was literally locked. Contacted support and they told me they can do that anytime without notice or reason. I asked to see the policy on that. MF told me it was their policy not to show people their policy to provide evidence of anything. My advice, don't use Doordash.
i did one of these apps for a while but stopped when i did some back of the envelope math and found out i was making $5/hr below minimum wage
I freaking love this show. It's about time someone shed light on gig apps' exploitation of drivers & restaurants. Thank you!!
Acting like lobbying is a normal business cost is disgusting
2:06 what in the dracula flow 😂😂😂 love ur show John
I'm so glad John brought  this up. It's high time that we the public see the truth of the situation. The Devil has always been the better fiddler!
A violinist on social media recently demonstrated that the devil's fiddle solo is akin to a pop artist with no talent only skyrocketing to popularity because of the ignorance of the masses, whilst Johnny actually displays a deeper and more complex playing method and intelligence of musical history. Gives the song an extra layer of appreciation for me, IMO.
I have never used a delivery app.
Makes the watching experience more entertaining knowing that Oliver is baked while hosting this show
If I’m using a delivery app,  it takes a royal screw up for me to give under a 4 out of 5
I find it hilarious you people won't tip a delivery person, but will pay premium prices for delivery food. Uber Eats is completely lying about not making money, they are making billions with a B. Just because they are spending it doesn't mean they aren't profitable. They are dumping everything into driverless research, buildings and high salaries to their corprate jobs. Uber Eats up charges every food item you buy by 20% , then charges a delivery fee that they also keep most of. Then charge for distances, time, etc. So they end up making more than the driver/deliverer per order. The company is doing 100s of thousands of these a day nation wide. With less overhead per order than their delivery person. This business is more than profitable, they benefit multiple ways by saying they are not profitable, they don't pay any taxes and they continue to own more properties and have more control of driverless vehicles. While the delivery person makes crumbs. Tipping has nothing to do with it. They could add 10 dollars to every order and you selfish people would still buy it. The second you have the option not to pay someone you take it. Putting you directly in the same selfish category as the owners of Uber eats.
F*** tipping. Pay your employees properly. If it's expected, than it's a fee, not a reward.
Interesting, my husband tried to do these food deliveries to limited success, since he significantly injured his back and cannot lift much. He is being a full time foster parent now.
And let’s not forget how people abuse the rating and complaining system to get free food. All the fucking time people get their delivery drivers fired because they wanted a free burrito bowl or whatever
My son has Asperger's and he was fired from uner eats when he did nothing wrong
"Uber does not make money" Ok, how much was the CEO's salary? Guarantee someone is profiting
This is just another example of wage slavery. The larger question is when do we hold corporations accountable. How about a greed tax for offending corporations?
Well Well .. if it isn't the INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR again . Corporate greed has no shame , if you ever have the opportunity please support your small local businesses as much as possible.
When I worked at a restaurant, we hated the food apps because the delivery guys got in trouble if an order was late, but we'd get in trouble if the order was wrong. So if we were in the weeds and running late on orders they'd just grab a random order off the shelf and knowingly deliver the wrong one.
As a non-US resident, I can't vanish the thought of how much emphasis it was made to tip properly, when I'd bet most of the civilized world would think "just pay people properly" instead. If the tip is optional, it's optional. And if it's not, it's part of the cost. If the food + the cost is not cheap enough for you, sorry bud, but that's called "i'm too poor for this", tipping / no tipping is just moving the burden to the delivery guy.
When I moved states to be closer to my wife's family, there was a time that a Food & Grocery Delivery app was my only source of income. I'd often work 13 hour days, 65 to 72 hours a week, earning an average of about $10.50 an hour, not counting gas and vehicle expenses.  The Independent-Contractor issue is a big one that needs reforming for people who find themselves doing this work full-time. I ended up in the hospital after injuring my back on the job, and had no way to access unemployment or workman's comp as I was 'self-employed' despite signing an exclusivity contract to not work for another food delivery app and signing up for a tier that would guarantee me better payout stability ($9 an hour guarantee) in return for working at least 35 hours a week.  If you're signing exclusivity paperwork, you're not really an 'independent' contractor, and there should be workplace protections.
As someone who used to live on Door Dash, as a delivery driver, this is really accurate. Its really frustrating when you'd get an order pop up, and you see that it will be only worth $3 but if you decline it, your rating goes down. So either you take the $3 delivery and eat the cost of time and gas, or you don't and you don't get offered the higher paying deliveries because your rating dropped.   I had to work my ass off to keep my rating high just so I would be considered for the deliveries that were high ticket, high tip. Its fucked up. Especially since I could no long just go to a restaurant and be a delivery drive for one place that actually pays a minimum wage. I could waste HOURS and make barely $20 some days, and this was during the pandemic when doing so was risking my health with every single place I would walk into, with no hope of being able to afford medical bills if something happened.
"that was the test" yep don't do that
Restaurant industry is BS. Can’t afford to pay employees, can’t afford to offer delivery? Maybe don’t..
Cash is queen!  Always always always tip everyone (gardener, housecleaner, servers, delivery people, etc.) in cash.
*btw, tip cash whenever able, not through the app*  so, if they're listing restaurants without contracts, presumably at the restaurant's original prices, that means the app is already making a significant profit before hiking fees onto the restaurant!
Put up flyers around your home town offering a cheaper service, and keep ALL of the money.
Maybe if they werent investing hundreds of millions of dollars to thwart policy in favor of workers they would be making better profits 🤦‍♀️ And i dont know about cheap because i find it more expensive ordering from doordash...the food is more expansive than the price at the restaurant, then there's the fees for service and the delivery fee plus tip.
Most restaurants don’t make in the first place because they are run by people who like to cook not know how to budget. You can’t be taken advantage of by business you wouldn’t get if the other business didn’t exist.
Grubhub is own by the  greedy german company Delivery Hero. So that means they have monopoly. I worked there. Horrible
Never leave bad reviews!
how about you remove tips and introduce delivery fees?? ever heard of that? i know it's a shocking idea
One word gangster GrubHub the new mafia
The fees are insane on these apps. I started to always go out of my way and drive or walk to pick up my order since covid ended. Also I try to order directly from website when possible.
I have only used food delivery service twice and both were bad experiences.  I will never use these types of services again.  Even with good tips you still get poor service.  Just order directly from the restaurant, which many still offer or go pick it up yourself.  I know we are all busy, but everyone has time to do a meal pickup at a restaurant.
I liked the idea of food delivery, but considering everywhere I’ve lived and used the apps for that I was charged as much or more in delivery charges it wasn’t worth it.  I’m sorry, but a $15-$30 delivery charge is worth it to me on a $25 order.
I knew I didn't like delivery apps
and here i thoguht the worst thing about grubhub was the stupid danceing add they had a few years ago!
5/5 🌟 no drama
John, it is easy for people with money to say that one should  tip. Personally, I consider the tip as part of the cost of a meal when dining in but many people do not and view it as optional because, in the past, it was presented that way. They have not accounted for the tip in the cost of their meal and really can't afford to do so.  Many of the people using these services are not so different financially from the delivery drivers.😢
Algorithms have ruined so much work. People rate 4/5 or 9/10 because they think they're giving the place a solid A. Maybe we could be faster but otherwise amazing.  The company sees it as a major red flag and starts putting SO MUCH pressure on the floor workers. I worked at a Nordstrom Rack and the pressure to do more with less gets amped up when well-meaning people do real math instead of corporate math.  Basically unless someone spits in your food or calls you a slur, rate your in-person shopping experience at the max rating. A lot of the issues are with corporate being out of touch with how their stores operate on the day to day and their refusal to hire enough staff.
they get paid $15-30/hr in nyc now, so do we really need to tip more
Nobody should be required to tip for delivery. The employer should pay enough to cover that. Also tips are given before delivery, at that point it's just a bribe.
so the times when employer pays 0 wage ( he will be giving you the oportunity to earn)  are upon us.. well done jon oliver for aplauding.. tippinig is scam.. youre crazy over the pond, thats what I see..
wait until you hear what Lyft and Uber take from drivers.  All these gig companies are theives.  Bloated bullshit with countless jobs where they are paying people money to determine the best way to fool drivers and restaurants into taking less.  Uber has over 30,000 employees and none of them drivers.  Think about that.  30,000 to run a handful of apps.  Insane waste of money to provide simple services, and they are now turning a profit at the expense of drivers who have seen their wages drastically slashed in the middle of rising inflation.
Even worse is the grocery deliveries.  You do all the work of doing the shopping, loading ,unloading, and checking out,  for no tip. I delivered 4 cases of water, 6 12pk of sodas, 2 bixes of kitty litter to a 3rd floor apt for no tip. Needless to say i will never pick up an order like that again, nor will i deliver to that person ever again.
I saw the title and I say yes 🙌🏾 let’s talk about this fuckers! Recently I discovered Uber eats charge me $30 more than what the hotel charge me for a large order plus I paid for Uber one, and they tell me I am saving a lot for using their app. Ass soon as I found out the prices of the menu on a Google order, I cancelled my subscription and deleted the app.   Now let me watch John Oliver grill the f out of them 😂 predators
From NY can confirm the tip screen just got removed one day. Now you can can only add the tip after checkout
Why pay for parasitic middlemen when you could call the restaurant?
I have not seen items being cheaper for customers 😅 if anything I seen these apps charge a bit more than what I would have paid in house ..not even talking about the delivery fee. For this reason it’s been over a year since I stopped using the apps and I’m much better off money wise 🎉
Likely you can get some of those bicycle expenses written off on your taxes
A lot of people tip based on the cost of their food and not the distance it takes to get it to them. It’s like they forget that the driver doesn’t work for the restaurant, their service is delivery.
We have local swiggy and zomato in india. Complaints are similar form restaurants but delivery partners are slightly better off and not reliant only on tips. Restaurants do complain apps asking for a few to bunp up their rating beyond 4
Jim Cramer is the official definition of a "tool". Fact. Look it up.
Yeah, guys, I make a decent income, I have never been the kind of person that would rather order a pizza delivered, then picking it up myself. Not only is there a delivery fee, but you’re expected to pay an ambiguous amount of money and tip. I’m not a piece of shit like a lot of people, so I will definitely tip well When I do order out. Also pizza places have takeout specials only if you go there yourself, so no I’m not gonna pay 50% more between delivery fee tipping, and. The absence of a pick up Discount, when I can just go get the fucking pizza myself.. there is an analogous equivalent of these three fees and delivery service apps that make the total amount of money you have to pay extra exorbitant. I legitimately feel like people are idiots for using these apps, so frivolously, and I have never stooped low enough to use them, except for when they give me a bunch of money to use their services.
Still proud to say I’ve never used one of these to order food. I did deliver for them though.
This reminds me of the way corporations treated blue collar workers, before the organized labor movement gained collective bargaining, when President Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act (aka the Wagner Act) into law on July 5, 1935. Before THAT, workers were basically servants to upper management. They were paid horrible wages, expected to work overtime for no increased pay, no vacation time, no sick leave, no way to address any grievances. Also no kind of health insurance whatsoever, So if they did get sick, not only did they not get paid for missing work, but all medical expenses had to come out of their own pocket. Basically whatever their bosses wanted to do to them, they had to just keep working and take it, if they wanted to keep their jobs.
Sago John 👏
to add onto delivery apps altering store hours: sometimes, from my experience, they take away the pickup option so you’re required to pay the extra fees and get it delivered if you want the food through them. i actually have lost count how many times doordash had pickup unavailable but uber eats was available. i’ve given up on delivery apps entirely unless on the rare occasion im feeling exceptionally lazy and could care less about blowing $30 on a meal worth $15.
I can't tell you how happy I am that someone finally said the truth about the devil's fiddling. He is and always was the superior musician in the content.
I'm glad I was here on the first upload, lolz
Yeah, I did not agree with the takeaway here. Pun intended. Restaurants should just deliver their food. I wish I had money in these orgs so I could pull it out.
wow! thanks for being on the money, bc as a floridian, when this bill passed, i looked this up and there wasnt any content on it yet, this is the first video on youtube going into it, i really appreciate it.
I wish he brought up E bikes burning down apartments.
These companies may not be charging consumers what it costs for the service currently, but I think that's mostly because these companies spend money like morons.
Never downloaded any of these apps, never want to. My wife picks up something at the store on the way home and we cook it together. If she’s feeling fancy, we might order some sushi and she brings it home or we go out to our local restaurants for a date night. That’s it. We live half an hour outside of both towns we work in, so having someone deliver out this far would be prohibitively bad for their bottom line or ours.
You gotta love the in-store imagery of a delivery service.
Anyone else notice life in the US has been getting significantly more dystopian every year they’ve been alive?
which apps are least worst for restaurants and/or deliverers?
I quit using all deliver apps in like 2022, when I realized I wasn't lazy enough to justify paying 100% or more in service fees for the same food I can just call in for.
8:50 this happened tonmy restaurant, and then people were getting upset with us.... How are you going to take orders for a restaurant every night of the week... And not know that my restaurant was only opened for dinner Friday and Saturday?!?  I hated dealing with thise food app people, and the drivers just take up space standing in the lobby... And I have actual in house guests to deal with.
people who order on these apps are the same people that don't tip worth a fuq when they go out or complain that 18% is too big a tip towards industry employees who work hard towards your experience compared to people who just shove a phone in restaurant workers face just to make 6 other stops before you while your milkshake melts. save your money and ACTUALLY support the restaurants and not tech companies. I'm surprised just how many people actually needed this broadcast.
I still enjoy Harry Potter. Fight me
John  you are so right. I did door dash when it first started operation and it was brutal. I find it strange they ain't making a profit, then why do that type of business, right? Back then, the restaurant mgrs told me they weren't making any money that much but to satisfy their customers they hopped in; this was before the pandemic
Skype is awful.  they decided to start using a biller over in Luxembourg a country where scammers are known to operate from.  because of this my bank will no longer allow Skype to bill me.  for the moment i can accept calls over Skype but I can no longer use Skype to make calls.  Microsoft is phasing out Skype because better tools have come along to fill the space Skype occupied for so long.  in fact when Skype decided to use a billing service in Luxembourg i got nothing but scam calls to the point it made the number i had with Skype useless.  for a while i thought i was getting harassed by scammers because the web host company i'd just bought a domain through had sold my information to these scammers.  i was so upset i ended my services with the web host company.  i'm just now realizing all those calls werent a result of the webshost but were a result of Microsoft shifting its billing services to Luxembourg.  this explains while despite having my website information hidden scammers knew my real name and contact info as well as companies my Skype number was associated with. Scammers were filling my call log with spoofed numbers using my local area code as well as calling me from spoofed numbers. it was very unsettling which is why i had gone after the webhost service so hard and demanded a full refund of all the services i had with them. my bank did me a favor by refusing to allow billing to continue.
Any rating below 5 stars could be devastating to a dasher. A 4.2 overall rating or lower means termination. 5 stars for a good delivery, no rating at all for anything else unless it’s something especially bad.
I work at Little Caesar's and at our out location,we only do delivers through Doordash, Ubereats, stuff like that. I usually end up babysitting the pickup portal because these delivery people dont know how it works, get irrationally annoyed when I tell them you need to put in the order pin into the keyboard ("can't you just open it for me? 😠") and lately they'll leave half the order behind behind because the order was split in two separate portal compartments and then I have to deal with customers angrily calling me asking where the rest of their order is. Technically since Doordash is a third party through our store, I'm supposed to give them Doordash customer service number and I understand wanting to be mad at someone that is delivering the food. That's why I make sure the order is correct if I'm able to check. I don't know much about the back end but it wouldn't be surprising that there's not job training in the conventional sense. All you need is a smartphone and a means of transportation so I've had moments where I have to help deliver people explain things in the app and that's when I don't have some of interrupting me mid sentence to shove their phone in my face instead of saying they're there to pick up an order 😑
This is very true. As a driver I feel used and abused mentally physically and emotionally. We need to fix the lack of tipping etiquette in America because these apps don’t give a fuck about how much we make.   Did you know most delivery apps only pay between 1-3 dollars per delivery.  That’s around 3-9 dollars per hour and we’re expected to pay for our own gas an expenses.   You may say I don’t have to work on the app but for my engineering carrier that was slashed by 50% due to advancements in AI, I do, I still love making records for local artists and celebrities but it’s not paying the bills anymore. So I’m adapting but I need to stay available to my clients so I work a large variety of apps to make ends meet. Sadly most gig apps are all the same.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
First
can we also not forget disabled people rely on these apps alot
All that without even mentioning how these services are massive trip generators that we all subsidize through roads
All of John’s points are absolutely valid. However, speaking from personal experience, the quality of these apps has been significantly worse recently. I don’t live in a major metropolitan area, but I have received so many orders from DoorDash and/or UberEats where the food was cold, the order was incomplete, or just the complete wrong food.   I was surprised this wasn’t mentioned. To me, it feels like the consolidation and monopolization of the food delivery market by these companies means they can get away with worse service, not just to the delivery workers but also to us consumers.   In response, I have absolutely done what John suggested. I now order food directly from my favorite restaurants that either offer their own delivery or that I can pick up myself. I honestly hope that these food delivery services implode due to their own greed.
So close to the mark, but no - nobody needs delivery apps. Working parents and drunk people relied on THE DELIVERY GUY AT THE RESTAURANT before this shit was everywhere. Continuing to use the apps given the state of the system and with the knowledge that it only gets worse from here is unironically a moral failure.  'I want to participate in the fated exploitation of others because its convenient' is unambiguously bad.
The last time I ordered doordash the lady that delivered mcallisters ate half my club It was like 2 years ago and I have driven myself to pick up my own food ever since
Amazon is the same deal.  The sellers pay for shipping, referral, warehousing, returns, advertising, low inventory, high inventory, inventory distribution, holiday inventory surcharges, and other promotional fees.
Could someone explain the logic behind this "you have to tip" message in NYC now that they earn a minimum wage? Isn't that a win for the workers if these corporations are required to pay them the NY minimum wage, making tipping them no longer obligatory? What am I missing? Is there still a catch in the law or something? Genuinely wondering.
Tipping is just a band aid for the real problem. It like the goverment is getting drain of their tax money, because most walmart employees are on welfare. And yet corprate making bonuses that dont trickle down.  I get that nobody is making money  niether app or resturant.  Someone is making most of the money and keeping quiet.
Working for a restaurant means that you deliver within a two mile radius on your bike, four miles with a car. Going to one location eat time. When you do an app, you’re all over the place. A misorder, you’re stuck for a hour trying to figure that out. I’ve only made about thirty dollars after working three hours on an app.
It's sad that even you, john, would normalise/encourage American toxic tipping culture. It' s not the customer's responsibility to provide proper wages.
So these companies are buying other companies and yet they're not making money!? Yeah right!
I need to know more about the bottom friendly foods. What can bottoms eat
13:31 "disrupting the orphanage space" is crazy
When I was a delivery driver I once delivered to a hotel that was on fire. They didn't tip.
I always tip the driver, use the premium membership, leave a perfect rating, but whenever there is an issue and i get credited "uber bucks" they just increase my "fees and taxes" on the next order.
“What industry is John Oliver going to make me hate today?  Apparently it’s food apps”
I have never used one of these delivery apps.
The audience needs to chill
The only problem I have with any of this is if the apps list companies without their permission or knowledge. If that's true then yes they should probably be sued. Everything else is a simple free market problem that requires a free market solution. If the app is too expensive or inconvenient then people should simply stop using it and that's that.
To me it seams encouraging tipping just prolongs the problem, mainly because average people are piss poor as it is. People should stop tipping and force companies to pay livable wages or go bankrupt as capitalism intended. It really irks me that this American tipping culture is also pushed here in Europe thru, I presume, the same apps just reskinned by German companies like "Delivery Hero"...
I did grocery deliveries for shipt years ago, you had to go in, pick out the groceries, pay with a shipt prepaid visa, and then deliver them. I remember one trip I made was on a Sunday, grocery store was insanely busy, customer wanted 6 bags of 40 pound rock salt along with their groceries, take it and deliver it all to them and they didn’t tip me a f**king dime, it was at that point I said no more for me
The analysis of "the devil went down to Georgia"  is perfect!
I love M street bakery! I’ve been getting my kids bday cakes from there for years. Cool seeing them on here.
I have never used a food delivery app service anyway. I'm much less likely to start now, and the previous likelihood was close to 0%. I'm old school. I go into the restaurant to get my food.
I do 5 stars except the few times I've gotten the completely wrong order... got a cheese quesadilla instead of a carnitas bowl, once
Boomer who long ago learned to COOK AT MY HOUSE!
I never understood those apps. You're on your phone, you google the food or restaurant and a lot of them have a website or app you can order through. Where in this do I need a third party?!
tRUMP is a leach . he haz a big screech. he s lacking in his speech.  around him  a smmell it comes  from hell.  everyone knows its way past your Jail!!😂😂😂😂
So basically, everyone loses money?
Listening to this while delivering food. My country doesn't have 3rd world labor laws though, so I'm fine...
The main problem is people are desperate enough to take these abusive jobs allowing them to exist while at the same time governments don't put proper protections in place to avoid people from taking said jobs. its the reason why serving staff in restaurants still rely on tips. tips would go away if either people stop doing those jobs or if the government did their fucking job.
I feel justified in never using any of these food delivery apps
While the apps themselves may not yet be profitable, if they ever are at all, I'd be willing to bet my hat that the people at the top of the pyramid (CEO, upper management) are making money hand over fist. Edit: Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber, received $24.3 million in total compensation in 2022, which is a 22% increase from the previous year. The average Uber Eats executive makes $229,531 per year.   So in other words, capitalism as usual
"millennial lifestyle subsidy" 😂, That is not what I would call systematically dismantling competition to ensure future monopoly. We're paying for all the rest of the monopolies. This is just part of that offset.😂
In other words 19th century capitalism with silicon wafers and microelectronics
21:32. That uncertain chuckle
Imagine if your job paid you $30/hr for three years and then suddenly paid you $8/hr. That's the gig economy right now.
Acting is acting. I prefer the actor to fit the script. Not a quota.
Imagine spending 80% more on food because you cant be fucked to go down the street. There was a girl at my office that would drive past 2 McDonalds on the way to work everyday, then order doordash mcdonalds to the office for breakfast, then complain about always having no money. Spare me the argument that some people "need" these apps. All of history refutes that.
I have NEVER in my life ordered food from an app! I'm not old or paranoid, I just refuse to pay $46.00 for Taco (fucking) Bell. Paradigm shifting idea: I know some of you might find this hard to believe. But there exists a way to contact a restaurant, place an order, and receive that order, all without using one of these services. Brace yourselves, this might change some of your lives. First, call the restaurant of your choosing (possibilities - endless), order the food you want (again, mind blown), and then just pick up said food. Yes, this sounds eerily close to service work, it's really not. Trust me, when the worst customer you have to deal with is yourself, you've had an okay day.
welcome to the future of work for so many people. You will have nothing and be very unhappy. Do something ya'll.
I really try to sympathize with the drivers but its a voluntary position. Alot of jobs suck and you're free to find another. Unless promises were made at the time of hiring then you knew it would involved your own transportation and relying heavily on tips. Alot of people take the job for convenience. Gotta take the bad with the good or find a different job
If you’re going to tip…    TIP WITH CASH!
There really isn't much reason to use them. I have a family and work full time, as does my wife. We cook our dinners or I drive and pick up my own food. Get it faster and hotter.
Dear USA, please STOP tipping as a norm. Start paying your workers for the work instead of paying your expenses and having the customer descide to maybe pay the worker.
Telling people to just tip is like telling people to recycle while companies pour toxic waste into the local water system
this whole US food model is broken.  processed food and delivery are a culture joined at the hip. bad food and exploited workforce. its all absurd. whole foods, that you prepare yourself, and a  better connection to your communities food suppliers or restaurants (who also focus on whole foods) is the only way to reverse the rot. but trying to somehow fix these services or the labour exploitation is always going to fail. plus will change nothing about the poor health, low life expectancy, food culture we have. we have lost our connection to real healthy food. now it's poison and slavery for the masses, so the elite can profit and own the world.
I’m surprised you’re encouraging tipping and haven’t done an episode on that. I used to tip very well. Even up to 50%, but now it’s gotten out of hand. I ordered Chilis curbside pickup last week and the default tip was 18%. My order was $93 so it would’ve been a great tip. I changed it to $2. 18% just for somebody to walk outside and hand me a bag? That’s insane. And I’ve become very against tipping lately. Not because of the server or anything the employee does, but because it should be up to the employer to make sure the employee gets paid. Why is it up to me if the server makes good money? It’s not up to me if the Walmart cashier gets paid… it’s up to Walmart to pay them. I get that a ton of ppl depend on tips, I’ve worked jobs where I depended on tips, but it’s bullshit and we need to change that.
I used to deliver for Domino's and yeah, as soon as the weather got bad, business would pick up, but tips never would.
How many people really believe that John is actually baked out of his fkn mind? 🙋🏻‍♂️
11:42  As a child I always pictured Johnny looking like Han Solo 🎻

17:00 - guess I'm not going to heaven :c
Grubhub charges a "Driver benefits fee". What does that even go to?
Much like ride sharing services, I feel like these should be run at cost by cities. Seriously, it's an incredibly appealing reason to move to a city and it would cut down costs to customers while fairly compensating workers. In Delhi, we're very close to implementing a government "cab calling" (not ride sharing) app. This will cut costs for consumers while raising fares for drivers.
“Tips make up a third to half of their earnings” It’s actually closer to three quarters in my experience.
No, John. We can definitely still enjoy Harry Potter now
As someone that has been a Dasher (both full and part time) for almost 2 years, I appreciate you doing this story. People have already commented on the abysmal $2 DD pays its drivers per order, so I wanna throw something else out there.  You mentioned the star rating system affecting job flow and such. This is true for Doordash in the sense that if you get too many negative marks they will deactivate you.  Actual job flow is more influenced by your acceptance rate. Over a rolling 100 delivery offers, they track your % of accepting said offers. There are tiers at 50%, 70% and 90% that affect how often you get orders and in some cases how often you get "high paying" orders. This causes an unstoppable spiral to low acceptance rate and therefore fewer offers just by existing. To elaborate, when DD sends an offer it shows the overall pay for that delivery as well as the mileage (to the restaurant for pickup, and the delivery. It will NOT include coming back to your zone). If you accept an offer that pays anything less than $1 per mile, you are losing money. In some places, it's even harsher because fuel economy is worse due to traffic patterns and whether it's rural/city driving etc.  So basically, in order to keep your acceptance rate (and therefore offer frequency) high you have to accept offers that will be a net loss to you. If you "cherry pick" offers and only accept fiscally reasonable ones, your acceptance rate will be low (full disclosure, mine has floated between 10-20% for months now) and you run the risk of being at the end of the line for delivery offers. And those that are left by the time you get them are ones that other drivers have probably passed over due to crappy pay:miles ratio.  This hurts not only you as a driver but the customer as well, because they're stuck either waiting for a driver to accept their order or it won't get picked up at all. The only way to be sure you'll get a decent delivery time is if you tip well, on top of paying already high prices. It's a really crappy system.
This is what is called Crowd Sourced Labor. Some of it is good, some of it marginal. Everyone should be paid a salary with performance bonuses.
I didn’t know this. I will decrease my use of these apps.
I thought for sure this piece would lead to the ghost kitchen situation. Companies posing as multiple restaurants but the food is made in one kitchen which is generally under regulated. Guess that’s a whole other can of worms.
Uber and Lyft are planning to pull out of Minneapolis because they voted to pay the drivers more. These apps are so corrupt and evil.
Food delivery is insanely expensive. I have no idea how regular people afford it on the norm.
15:28, good, i had some door dasher not find the front door to a police department and clearly told him "LOOK FOR THE GIANT SIGN THAT SAYS POLICE DEPARTMENT, instead he went to the wrong building, i kept texting him to keep driving around the building he was at and you'll see it, but he refused and claimed to leave in front of the building. when i asked for a picture he ignored me, so i made sure to give him 0 stars and claimed he stole my food. Door dash only gave me 50% of my money back and i was left still starving during a 16 hour shift. I hope that dasher got fired. Also WTF, how can a company be operating and not be profitable? where the fuck is the money coming from? i wish i could run a business that isn't profitable but still operate by mystery money coming in
Don't be lazy people! I completely disagree here. If you want the food that badly, get up and get it yourself ! Save your money on both ends. You don't need to tip and you get the food the way you want it ! It's a win-win
I did uber eats (FK THEM), bite squad and Instacart, and all of them but ESPECIALLY UBER can gargle my balls.  People will promise a 20$ tip, then turn around and piss on you to get free food, its fkd
I refuse to use any food delivery apps. If I put in an order, I pick it up myself.
I was a chef for 15 years and for about 6 of it this shit was nothing but a pain in the ass and a liability
There's been time where I knew it wasn't the Delivery issue it be the restaurant that did it so I always tip cash cause those apps be Robbing the shit out of the deliver 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Upper-middle and on up class are the worst tippers regardless of industry. When I did delivery and taxi work, my best tips were from average working people. I wish I'd kept the dime I was bequeathed by the lady who was forced to slum it by taking a cab TO the airport. The horror.
The more time passes by, the more I am glad I am stubborn to just go in or call my order, lol.
Ordering ANYTHING from Manhattan while living on Roosevelt Island except furniture is CRAZY.
No you don't have to f****** tip. If you want more money tell the company you're working for to pay you more money or quit and work for a different one that will pay you more money. It is not my job to do anything involving a tip. It is however your business's job to pay you enough money to live on. Don't focus on people who are tipping focus on companies or f****** you over. If you don't start going after them it'll never change.
All of you guys complaining about tipping and saying “the restaurant needs to pay their employees more, I’m not tipping. ”   - - this is HOW IT IS , and many people work food service jobs because they have no other choice. So just tip, the system is not going to change just because you’re complaining about it. And if you don’t want to tip then make food at home!   -an annoyed food service employee
If I don't get my food, or half my shrimp are gone, or it takes two hours (all of which have happened to me) I'm giving the person a 0 or 1.  They should get fired.  If 9 out of 10 drivers didn't reek of reefer, I would have more sympathy for them.
Doordash punishes you if you decline crappy jobs. They send you less work. More than half of people DON'T TIP!! That's doordashes fault because they say Free Delivery. I can't even see if I got a tip until after the job is done.
Yes, side hustles needed just to stay alive in this country. While CEOs are pulling in $20 MILLION to $200 MILLION dollars per year. That is upwards of $400 dollars per HOUR. This was the culture pre-French Revolution. CEO PAY MUST BE REDUCED NATIONWIDE, across ALL industries, for our problems to even have a chance at being resolved.   And we ALL must keep turning the argument back around to this. We have to stop letting the laissez-faire, Ayn Randian, free market PHYCHOPATHS drive the narrative. This has got to stop!
18:55 lol the culinary school I went to had student housing options on Roosevelt island. That’s why I chose not to live there. Such a pain in the ass to access
Microsoft mostly killed off skype in favor of teams. Consumer skype still existed, but the business one was discontinued. And teams was nowhere near feature complete, and meetings with people outside your organization were either difficult or impossible.  Zoom just happened to be in the right place at the right time - free, super easy to use, and was able to scale quickly to handle the incredible demand that suddenly sprung up. It was also crossplatform.
Im still baffled by how any 9f these companies are unprofitable. They exploit the workers, they exploit the customers, they exploit the restaurant, nickel and dime to the fucking hilt, and they still dont have enough money to break even? Seriously, where is the money going? Somebody who is good at the economy help me!
I tried Door Dashing for like 3 days during the pandemic, and got paid a grand total of $5/hr CAD, so fuck Door Dash and the rest of them....such a giant scam that should be outlawed ASAP.
That guy is right though. If I'm home from work and the laundry is going already, then I'm absolutely too drunk to drive, and SOMEONE has to bring me my panang curry
Driving to work connected to Bluetooth Oliver uploads what else could I ask for in life 🎉
No, John... No one needs to tip... or at least that's how it should be. Employers need to pay fair livable wages and tipping should be for what it's supposed to be for - a reward for excellent service.
As a Dasher, I’m starting orphanages all the time. I’m opening my sixteenth this weekend.  :V
Why can't we just put John Oliver in government somehow and see how it works out? :D
Qué caballero tan distinguido
this should have been done about 4 years ago... Most of these issues have been ironed out.
I am so glad these issues are being highlighted. I noticed a LONG time ago that these companies were screwing us over. I refuse to use and will never consider using these companies. They are scum.
The idea of tip culture is gross, and saying that I should feel obligated to tip because a massive corporation refuses to pay their employees is crap logic. Tips are a gratuity, if you keep paying tips because "workers won't make enough otherwise" then you are literally incentivizing the companies to continue to not pay their employees.   What should we do? Tip forever? Or until a magical law forms to force minimum wage to be taken seriously sometime in the next 500 years, maybe? If I am going be obligated to pay 20% more for a product/service because the boss is a greedy tyrant than just put that as a price increase.   What? Nobody will use the service if you did that? Gee, it's almost as if exploitation is the name of the business.   Why is it that I am shamed into paying extra because a greedy boss refuses to pay their employees but the worker is not being shamed into getting a job that actually pays them a decent wage?
Tipping is wild I'm not paying 40$ for a fuckin meal

What an incredibly unfortunate irony, when a company is willing to pay tens of millions to lobby against paying more for their employees…..instead of just paying more for their employees.
I have a Chinese restaurant, a pizzeria and a typical Belgian fries mixed with a Turkish kebab restaurant on the square about 100 m walking. I'll call in advance and I'll just go pick it up there.  However, my eldest daughter discovered Mexican food so she looked up the restaurant itself to order food there. Now I can't help but wonder who actually brought it. It was over 5.6 km (roughly 3.5 miles) and I felt sorry for that person.  I can only hope that the delivery services over here are better regulated. I don't know what distance that piece of pie had to travel but I thought that the Mexican food was too far. I would never have ordered it myself. I'll do with the things I can go and pick up myself.
On this week's episode of, JOHN RUINS SHIT I LIKE. =)
Capitalism at work. If they could make you indentured servants, they would. It's already getting close to that.
Sorry, but if a business relies on tipping, then the business simply should not exist.
I refuse to use any of these apps. If I'm ordering out I always pick up my food.
Thank you! As a DD driver I agree with all of your points and most importantly it's great that someone with your following is educating the customers. I don't think that they realize that we don't see any of those delivery fees or that they're rating us not the food.   A big complaint people have is when their order takes a lot longer than they think it should. There can be several reasons for this and some of them are outside of the driver's control.   There may not be a driver close to the restaurant and they may have to drive a couple of miles in heavy traffic to get there.   Fast food restaurants prioritize drive thru orders first, dine in orders second, and delivery third. I have waited over 20 mins for food to be ready at the McDonalds by the interstate during the lunch rush.   It's not always possible but in order to make money doing this a lot of drivers try to avoid taking orders that pay out less than $1/mile. If you didn't tip or tipped low then your food might be ready but sitting around as one driver after the other refuses the order. Then DD will combine your order with an order from someone who tips well enough to make the combined order worth taking and you have the further delay while the driver picks up two orders from two different restaurants and then has to deliver to two different locations. Never has the interpretation of tip as To Insure Prompt service been more true even though the higher dipper is penalized by this with the delay caused by the driver having to make an additional stop.   Finally, GPS sucks in places and between people not having visible house numbers and sometimes giving the wrong address it can take time to actually find you. Do you live on Something Street and accidentally put in Something Drive? Did you want it delivered to your job and instead of asking someone in the office what the street address is just put a pin in the map that actually goes to the place next door or a block away? Are you not answering your phone when the driver calls to get better directions? Expect delays or even cancellations. If we were psychic enough to just know where to find you we'd be in Vegas not delivering food for $2/trip plus tips.
Masterful analysis of the devil's fiddle playing. Lol
Where I work we measure customer satisfaction which is perilous since customers told us that they dont like our attitude, dont like our accent just caus they didnt get an order on time.
Triggering - make a PHONE CALL 😂  I still call mine direct  😏....so they don't have to pay out 28% for a DD like company, I'm old (they don't have a direct website for ordering)
So let me give you all an idea of what I made as an Uber eats driver because being a single parent with a very young child with no child care and having to do what I could do, Uber eats will tell us that a run is going to pay $9. The truth is you're only paid the base and that's estimating with tip. The problem is that 90% of the people where I live to order food on Uber eats do not tip. There were days that I would work for 10 hours and before expenses I will have only generated about $110 and that's doing about 35-40 orders. So after paying for my gas which at the time would have been about $60 for a tank I was doing good to clear about $4 an hour.
My family ordered over 100 dollars worth of food at a good Italian restaurant near us using Grubhub, and the delivery driver stole our order. This was also just before the restaurant closed for the night and their kitchen was already closed when I called them to inquire about the food. The restaurant manager felt bad for us that we weren't going to get our food, and Grubhub denied responsibility. The restaurant gave us our money back in full and apologized for the whole thing. Knowing what I know now I'm upset that Grubhub themselves didn't handle this. I had btw called them first, but they said their driver said they gave us the food and basically called us liars. We contacted the restaurant as a hail mary to try to at least get our money back. We did go to that restaurant again, but we went in person and we have never used Grubhub ever again after that incident. I avoid all 3rd party delivery services. If I know a food place uses them I either pick up my order in person or choose a place that has their own drivers. I will never use another 3rd party delivery service again.
I know a LOT of working folks, and I know a LOT of them who tried to pull side work at one of these delivery scams. NOBODY liked it. NOBODY made good money doing it. It's a sadly necessary evil for working folks because Crapitalism sucks.
Their success plus gouging (these stats never mentioned heavy fees and rate increases to the customers) means they can't possibly be constantly losing money. If they aren't profitable, it's absolutely because they're overpaying higher ups or overspending in advertising and lobbying and mergers. It's also possible they're just lying. Also, that lady who said they're not profitable looked pretty financially comfortable based on how she was dressed and her background.
Glad I am still able to walk over to the Pizzeria five minutes down the street but imagining I was for some reason not able to, that is rough and noone should have to rely on these shitty apps
Wow, I guess it does take a lot of balls to be a landlord... like about 9 pairs
As a former Postmates and Favor driver, working for a delivery app is still better than working for a restaurant directly (even though neither is an ideal job). Restaurants don't provide benefits either and will go out of their way to schedule you when it's most inconvenient for you. Also, you can easily make way more through apps than from a restaurant.
I do wanna say, DoorDash doesn't enforce their standards if you deliver in areas where they don't have enough drivers.
I don't like tipping...
I'm done with getting 14 dollar delivery fees and then asked to tip.
John Oliver you’re a real hero for telling people to leave 5 star review and tip!
How do I like this twice?
They've been uploading the same video twice a week for the past month, isn't that against youtube TOS?
I stopped using Uber Eats after they stopped staffing their call centers with actual human beings. Also, I had a lot of issues with restaurants being listed as open and accepting orders, placing an order, and then finding  out they were actually closed or had turned off their delivery system. I have problems with Doordash too, but at least I can call and complain to an actual person when an item is missing, and get a credit/refund. My main problem with DD is that 50% of the time, they deliver to my neighbor because I live in a duplex, and they have the main street number, whereas I'm the street number and Unit B. This keeps happening despite my VERY clear instructions on the app as to my unit and my door being a different color. I'm disabled, so it's difficult for me to go over to my neighbor's door and up their steps, rather than just being able to open my own door and pick up the food from the small table I have just for the purpose of putting deliveries/packages on so that I don't have to try and bend over, which is really difficult for me.
This isn’t even getting into the prevalence of fake restaurants, aka ghost kitchens, on these apps. What appear to be local different local restaurants are often just a single kitchen to pumps out the same food under different names. These tend to crowd out actual local restaurants. They’ve also proven difficult for the FDA to track down and regulate for food safety. Eddy Burback had a good video on these for those interested
Hillarious. Complaining about workers abuse .. in the US! John, workers abuse is the essence of your America. Get on with it.
Thanks for rubbing my nose in my millennial dystopia 😑
when my food shows up stinking like weed or cigarettes u can bet im rating 1 star i dont give a fuck. dont smoke on my food.
I don't mean to sound like I support these apps, but it's also kind of hard to feel sorry for an industry that has been doing this exact thing to servers all along. They've been gouging servers, and everyone else who relies on tip outs, out of labor costs and passing them to all of you.  It's possible much of the restaurant industry is built on an untenable model.
Something that isn’t talked about is the fact that food delivery apps make more work for hosts and servers who don’t even see any tips from these orders. I’ve seen so many people quit places because they are doing to go orders for like 70 percent of their work while not making any tips from those orders and the pay is tragic.

Well, I guess I won’t be using those anymore.
Dear John: I think if you'd said "ticks all the boxes"  instead of "hits all the checkboxes" (the grubhub ad) we still would have known what you meant...😄
Eddie Burbank and Drew Gooden were ahead of their time.
Tip drivers in CASH! Although personally, I don’t use food delivery services. I have before, but the cost is just too high. I haven’t eaten “out” in months. When we do, it’s pickup while we’re out.
Actually no, the thing to do is reject all these apps. Get up, walk to the door of your living space, go out to the street, and get your own food!
Yeah, last time I used DoorDash was the last time. Dude pulled my food out of a pile of trash in the back of his open pickup bed.
Done with the apps. Delete them. Done. If i want food, either i get groceries and cook or i make a good plan for Friday night with good company and eat good food at the restaurant. Fuck. That itself is convenient. How lazy are we fucking getting? Jesus Christ...let's take back these experiences.
Customers should truly leave their ego in the car when it comes to customer service workers. We here to help within designated parameters. Its a mirror, reflecting how ugly people are. I just quit my job. Customer followed me outside, and asked when his chicken will be done. I told him, i just quit ask someone else. He looked back at the store, then at me and said, yo your break almost over? Im starving!!!!.... . Im still not sure if im actually dead and this is  hell, but if this is reality, advice for everyone: kindness and courtesy is free and infinite. Cruelty, intimidation, smug bullies, using fairness as means of entitlements. The cost is devastating to our society. Fuckin stop it! No one deserves anything. Theres no need or use for that....
I always knew big corpo probly, naturally treats there employees like crap no surprise there. However, back home in south east asia at least, there's also the other side to the coin, where we find delivery workers who are so infuriatingly scummy. And I don't mesn the majority, and naturally take it with abgrain of salt cuz obviously my experience combined with experiences of my shared vicinity might seem abysmally small compared to the bigger picture, but I've been delivered half eaten food, orders been stolen and not compensated by the restaurant, not been able to give a delivery guy a bad rating for not delivering my order cuz on uber they can literally cancel the order afyer picking it up from the restaurant...and so much more bad experiences. So while i agree that worker care is always the top priority, just thought that aspect of the story should have also got some attention
I’m so happy that someone has finally mentioned on a massively public platform how supremely better the devils song was over Johnny’s. Johnny sucks in that song. Long live Satan. Happy Easter. 🤘🏼
Don’t watch you all the time, so not sure. Have you done an episode about “tofu dregs” in China? No one seems to be talking about what’s happening there these days. Also, I saw some YouTube conspiracy? ideas about the death of Angela Chao. Her family has been a major CCP/US conduit. Grist for the mill.
It isn't on the customer to make sure the employees get paid fairly. The business model doesn't work and that's the end of the story.
Never ordered from door dash ( its just another middle man to suck up money)but i have had money taken from my bank account 5 from door dash.  It was hell to get back.
19:20 A friend of mine did grubhub for a while, and she told me about this guy who kept ordering a single small fry from McDonalds almost every single day, and she would often get his orders since she worked that area at that time. I don't know how weird your life has to be to pay delivery prices for a small fry.
My local pizza hut has outsourced it's delivery to doordash. As a result I haven't gotten the soda I ordered with my pizza since
Only works in the city.  Very little in small towns.
Son of a bitch...John Oliver stole one of my jokes! I've been telling that Devil Went Down to Georgia joke for almost 15 years. I've posted it several times online written out. But since I wouldn't stand a fucks chance in court, all I can say is "JOHN OLIVER STOLE MY JOKE! AWESOME! HE THINKS I'M FUNNY ENOUGH TO STEAL FROM!
Pretty sure "profitable orphanages" is one of the first story of the Ghost in the Shell manga lol
Some people work these contractor jobs like Uber, DoorDash, etc and treat it like a regular job and expect the same benefits like regular pay etc. That’s impossible.
Tip with cash at delivery........
C😮🤔K!
“Check to make sure you’re tipping.”  “We’re getting a service for less than it costs.”  “Go with 5 starts across the board.”  “You have to tip.”  No. Tipping is for exemplary service. It’s not the customers duty to ensure these people are getting a living wage. That is the responsibility of the employer. If they can’t/won’t pay their employees a livable wage, they don’t deserve to be in business.  And getting the service for less than it’s worth? Sorry, a 100% mark up on my dinner isn’t worth it.  Fuck these apps and fuck these companies. A bunch of predatory asshats is all they are.
this tip culture in USA is most bizzare
nah bruh. Zero Tip Gang where ya at bruh! REPERSENT!
You're rich, everyone isn't We can't afford tipping 20% every single time. I understand delivery workers need the money but WE SHOULDN'T BE THE ONES PAYING THAT MONEY WHEN WE DONT EARN FROM IT. the companies behind them make all the money they need to pay their delivery people It's just infuriating to listen to rich dudes shouting tip more more. Most of us just can't afford that
The CEO's and Management are making money.
I was going to use doordash/grubhub once. the place was 10 minutes away.  But the charge from the delivery basically doubled the price of the purchase price.  I get it can be convienient, and necessary for some people, but damn it seems like it screws everyone.
john olivers audience should learn how to be quiet. always whooping and hollering over nothing.... so annoying
So...... Uber eats it is!!!! 😊❤ That's good to know!!! Thank you!!!
i worked at a small business restaurant for seven years- even before the pandemic, we were constantly getting screwed over by delivery apps to the point where we decided to rely on community outreach to make it through the pandemic rather than EVER have to rely on delivery apps. we would also constantly get PostMates couriers asking us for menu items we hadn't offered in YEARS, even after we REPEATEDLY called PostMates to tell them to remove us from their system... these companies aren't good for anybody, not the contractors or the restaurants or even the people they deliver to
Grubhub closed their service and is about to file for bankruptcy
Ah here we go in "whats capitalism up to today?"
And they wonder why we're going to regulate them... Lies over and over again. And no that's insane, those companies absolutely are charging what the service is worth + 125%. It does not cost a service fee of $7.50 to delivery a garbage plate 1 mile, I don't care what universe you're in - get me your ship so I can join! Love the video John and LastWeekTonight Team!
No, John, the solution to big companies making the consumer decide whether tipped worker families get fed is not for the consumer to keep on tipping them. It’s for the workers to get mad and do something.
They look pretty comfortable to me. They don’t look homeless. They look pretty profitable to me.
Brennan Lee Mulligan did a video on EXACTLY that thing with Skype. It was hilarious.
I used to use these apps a lot. I then found out that DoorDash was taking my tips and then paying the driver less if they got my tip. I calculated that my tips paid about $7000 of DoorDash’s expenses. I uninstalled all of them and will never use them again.
I used UberEats once (ONCE) like 3 years ago and it was late, wrong address, missing parts of the order and cost almost twice what the original price of the meal after all the fees.  They still email me begging me to order someting else.  Nah, I'm good...
I barely use delivery apps (or order takeout in general, I cook mostly myself and spend my money on fun hobbies) but when I do I always tip with cash to make sure the driver gets it tax free
I have never once used any of these apps.  And I'm glad.  I had expected them to disappear after COVID ended.  From everything John Oliver says, they should.  Honestly.  Just because something is new does not automatically make it better.  Look at AirBnB.
Grubhub charges $5 for $1 burgers then add fees, taxes and tip.  It's a scam.
Delivery apps. Delivering your cold food to the wrong house even before Covid 👏🎉
Having worked a job that relies on tips, I totally agree. I always start at 20%. If the service isn't good, it goes down accordingly. I do reward a waiter or waitress that goes above and beyond. These people work hard for those tips. And they earn every dime! I don't have food delivery where I live, but if I did, I sure wouldn't want a bunch of angry grub hub drivers delivering my food. If that extra $5 is gonna break the bank, you can't afford to eat out.
"Cant even enjoy harry potter anymore" that was a personal attack
Fantastic work, john!  Lets do grubhub coffee!
I was a delivery driver for 14 years between several pizza places and doordash and Uber eats, and I can tell you that the review system definitely needs to be there. Especially when I was working at places like Papa John's, I got to see so many people who washed out and couldn't cut it because they simply couldn't understand how to deliver to people's houses. Even with the rise of GPS--and I know, this seems so simple to most people, but drivers who were even given an incredible amount of grace on how much time it should take them to get to destinations over the course of sometimes weeks, ala, as a sort of trial run, they could not figure it out. And this sort of turnover happened a lot. It seems simple but it's just not for everyone.
When did this become a midweek upload
So after explaining all the abuse cycle, he concluded that the problem is the lack of tips?! This program has seen better days...
I worked as a delivery driver for several restaurants back when that was still a thing. I made myself a guaranteed minimum of $250/day working open to close. It was all tipped labor too, so the restaurants didn’t suffer on their labor budget having drivers around. Gotta say, I was pretty happy with my delivery driver jobs back in the day.  But I don't get why its being posed as a bad thing that drivers need to buy their own car and equipment. That's an absolute "no shit" thing they need to do. Would you expect an Uber driver to receive a car from Uber? Old school delivery places didn't provide vehicles or pay for gas and wear and tear either. Why would they?  Also, when a driver does a terrible, terrible job, I will leave them 1 stars. For sure. Anyone giving 5 stars for someone that is absolutely abhorrent at their job is doing a disservice to the rest of the world. Ofc, only do that if they're legit bad. If your food takes long because there was traffic at 5:30pm on a Friday, that's not bad service...
Ex pizza driver here, in cali it was fine, moved to indiana and they have something called tipped wages so when i was on the road i made 3.50 an hour. That inherently incentivized me to speed and roll thru stops. In cali we were incentivized to be safe bc we made the same no matter how long it took on the road
The fact that we look at the fact that a migrant worker or someone on their 3rd shift to bring you dumplings at 11 pm is some qualifier that you’re in a modern economy just bc they brought it on an e-bike is an absolute joke
Have never, will never use one of these delivery apps.  Recently I tried to order food for pick up online, the portal was "store front by door dash" for the restaurant. Bill on the app $38, bill when I called direct and ordered $25.. it was a 42% increase on the price, that mark up was from door dash themselves not the restaurant. And I was PICKING IT UP!  Screw delivery apps, huge ripoff. If you can do it yourself you should you lazy fks.
There is tons of info out there on how awful these companies are, yet people still choose to work for them.
Am I the only middle aged person left who has never, not once, not ever, used these ridiculously overpriced “services”? Please tell me there are more of you out there 😂.  I can confidently say I won’t ever, either.
Food delivery apps are terrible companies that prey on restaurants and the delivery drivers. Got it. I'll stop using them. But then that entirely fucks over the delivery drivers that rely on the orders. . Wow, that really is Sophie's Choice (also never seen the movie).
During the pandemic I worked at a restaurant that also owned a bakery nextdoor that they decided not to open for takeout. I was outside getting some air when a Dasher pulled up and asked if the bakery was open so they could do a pickup and showed me a menu that they had had A DECADE AGO. They just picked a menu from somewhere on the Internet and put it up without even checking if the place was currently open.
2200 to have a business when you're a illegal immigrant is cheap. I guess white people do not participate in delivery services. California has a democratic super majority and still can't help gig workers.
I remember finding out how much restaurants were losing from these apps :/ ALSO, paying more as a consumer .. I’ve started exclusively ordering from the restaurants app if I wanna do an online order. I don’t wanna play their game anymore
These apps make me miss living in Korea so much. 50ish restaurants in my neighborhood who deliver for free. Some dude just shows up on a scooter. Some restaurants actually deliver the food on proper, sturdy plastic bowls and plates - you leave them outside your door and they come back to get them. E.g., a big bowl of Jjamppong noodles. (Granted, these guys might actually make less than the UberEats folks)
John is now the devil’s new music agent
Now, I’ve had my complaints about just throwing John in an all blue suit with his navy jacket and light blue shirt, but something about that snazzy polka dot tie is really catching my eye. It feels delightfully play on the typical fits. I feel like we’ve had some kind of renaissance of ties this season and I. Am. Here for it. I will always be a proud supporter of a flashy tie to really make a suit pop. Hoping there’s more of this in the future 7/10.
Once again it's some dumb companies faults but the common people have to pick up the slack
Why am I now getting ads on this channel😭😭
Skype lost because they caved to the Chinese and china's version has a keylogger
Tipping as a way to reward above and beyond service is fine. Tipping as the default way to pay people's living wage makes no sense. It's also weird how it's only done for certain jobs, why tip waiters and not chefs? Why deliver workers and not grocery store cashiers? Why Uber drivers and not bus drivers?
I do not use delivery apps and do not plan to start. Learn to cook, it will eventually be better.
dear lord... you are hysterical.... perhaps genius...
You forgot to mention that they  dont just charge us for the delivery but also charge more for the food on the apps than inside the restaurant. BS
and what would happen, if everyone gets a negative review? soon, they are without drivers, and the business model in that form collapses
Tipping is not a long term solution. It still hurdles us torwards the monopoly market and leaves workers without healthcare etc.  You stopped just shy of actually making a point.
I'm really disappointed in the content on this story. Expressing customers should tip is good, but telling them why is important. These delivery apps pay drivers literally peanuts, and without tips, drivers would be making far less than minimum wage. It should not fall on the customer to provide a working wage for drivers it should fall on the company.  He also just completely let's Uber Eats off the hook when they are by far the worst. A little bit of research will show that they have recently started a war against their own customers! Uber Eats has made it nearly impossible to get a refund when have issues with your order. Customers are having to reach out to their card companys or banks to dispute charges because Uber Eats is trying to siphon every nickel they can get
I always make sure my driver gets tipped.  I live in very a rural area.  If they're gonna deliver to me, I'll make it worth their while.
I use DoorDash once a month because my Chase card gives me “pro” or whatever they call it, and they give me a $10 credit - then I add an extra $10 to the tip. Otherwise I don’t use it.
15 people standing around at all times? Yeah that's still a lot of restaurants you go to. While you need a fork because you never got one, these little fucks are right through that door right there scrolling tiktok and playing Pokemon Go. You'll see them again after you go find your own fork and have finished your meal 10 minutes ago.
Most restaurants suck.  Tipping culture shouldn’t apply to a business where the worker cannot distinguish their service to the customer in some way.
2:38 I completely forgot about Skype!!! 😂😂😂😂
I finally gave up delivering for Doordash  because if you won't take the orders that cost more in gas than you make on the order, they quit sending the orders that make money for you.  If you ever wonder why their service is so bad, it's because they reward new inexperienced drivers to get them hooked on the app, and run off the experienced drivers. Meanwhile, food sits there going to waste for lack of drivers..
I stopped using these apps when I found that out.
Not every bad idea is worth saving, there's to many ethics issues and overall problems with these apps that could be saved by restaurants just having their own delivery drivers. That store wouldn't need 15 guys standing around it would need maybe 10 flexible workers cleaning the store making the food and doing deliveries. Fuck these apps.
It's a reflection of the world we live in. Capitalism does not work.
I'm not sure whoever made the top/bottom ad is that familiar with queer culture.  bottoms aren't just twinks.
Alright John I had enough, the devil was worse. Here's why, he had an entire band, but that was a fiddle battle. Johnny only has his voice and his fiddle and still gave a ran for his money. That's why Johnny won
As a college guy, I'm only ordering food if my friends and I are too stoned to drive or walk to the student union. You better bet we're tipping out delivery person like wild bc they also have to deal with three stoned English majors trying to do math.
At some point the price of delivery will outweigh the motivation to get up and go get it yourself. People will only pay what they feel its worth.  A delivery on a sunday morning when you in bed should cost far more than on a thursday evening when on your way home from work, but they dont, they cost the same
Stopped using these after 2021. They're wayyyy too expensive.
Doordash’s owner/CEO never fails to give his inauthenticity away. And Doordash used to steal tips. Who knows what else they do now.
An interesting study would be comparing ratings of "attractive individuals" compared to "unattractive individuals" for doing the same thing. Lookism, racism, bigotry, ageism, is all part of the review process when anyone is asked to "give me your opinion of how THIS individual served you."
0:47 someone actually said *”What?”* like they’re in disbelief, I also forgot this commercial existed…not bad 😭💀
...wasn't this posted earlier...?
I'm a power bottom. What do I eat, Postmates?
A good 20% of the orders i get offered on doordash if i accepted i would be making well under minimum wage or even lose money. Also those orders are usually extra not worth it because they rate poorly at like 3x the normal amount.
I got hit by a car delivering for an app called Favor on my bike years ago in Boston. The recipient of the food was very nice about it, but the driver that hit me was not despite it being their fault for not looking before taking a turn.
California's anti-gig worker law is horrible and hurt. Good workers and independent contractors the most. Now Biden and the Democrats want to pass the pro act to hurt independent workers Nationwide. Workers aren't helpless victims, they make their own choices, and government intervention hurts more than helps.
You know, apps like grubhub and Uber eats might actually become profitable if they weren’t spending all their income paying for lobbying efforts and outrageous executive pay… why should ANY CEO of a non-profitable company get a huge pay package?!?
These delivery boys are speeding and going the wrong way on the bike paths and zipping around on side walks and it drives me insane that these apps are constantly incentivizing them to turn the streets into chaos so they can survive
Who already saw the whole Episode on Monday when it was uploaded on Youtube?
I lost focus after hearing those facts about leaches. I am sorry how many testicles???
Theses drivers are usually homeless and eat the food they supposed to deliver .
I'm not lazy enough to use a food delivery app.
I pay for microsoft for my business, I don't expect them to cover health insurance. The idea of software companies having to pay your other expenses for your delivery business is absurd
Is that a doordash driver using the red bag 🎒....omg. 🎉❤😊
Haven’t used a food app yet and proud.
11:45 I have said this for YEARS! The Devil totally won the battle!
Massive automation has changed tipping across the board.  Places where there was no tipping in the past has created it, and places where all of the tip went to the work it's not being taken in part by the business as a "service fee" and people don't realize the worker is not getting the money.  We should raise the minimum wage in food and delivery services and get rid of tipping as an expected part of their income.  (my super cute waitress roommate with big boobs and dimples does NOT want tipping to go away and she does not see a problem with it :) )
God damn it america, fix your damn restaurant models (AND delivery models) and pay your workes a decent living wage!   Also, hearing John play the devils advocate for the actuald evil is exactly why I love this show.
Tip less.
Damn I knew they were screwing over drivers but taking half of the actual order price from the restaurant while still screwing over the drivers is crazy
“Numbers being yelled at you by human Squidward,” I swear to god, every time they make John read a self-depreciating comment on here it gets funnier. Love this guy 🤣
I was thinking about working for one of these apps, because of the flexibility. This hasn't motivated me a lot.
Three massive Ls
Maybe they could be profitable if they quit spending it all on lobbying and executive bonuses
Always tip the driver!
How does one get rich in America?   Invent a product or service that allows us to be even lazier than we already are ! 😅
is this a new episode? a reupload? Zazu? who knows? lets watch  i see USA still follows slavery rules... uh?
It’s actually a thing in customer service as well that reviews are never seen as a reflection of the company but only as a reflection of the worker. It sucks because the company can get a bad review for a policy and then my manager comes to me to say I don’t get a raise because of that review.
What's wild to me is that cab company's were profitable. Uber comes in and crashes the income for everyone including themselves. Its Hyper self destructive.
Yeah I refuse to use those apps.  I will NEVER be so lazy as to not be able to go get the food myself. Or just cook.
My friend used to work at a restaurant, and he told me never to order with UberEats. They had no control over what was listed on it, so people would come in looking for food they were out of all the time. At least with DoorDash, the restaurants can manage their own menus. Though, apparently they pay for the privilege.
Then you have Germany where you tip via the app and my delivery driver tells me not to and thanks me but it will never arrive in his pocket.
13:10 that guy is just such an absolute turd.
erstmal essen UberEats  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMSqOX3-7XQ your Sis, your Bros your Kids, your Ho's gotta eat  wtf?
If you cannot afford to tip, don't order or go out.  Period.
The first time I've ever seen an ad and thought "the conservatives are right, someone stop this" 😂
As a Nigerian who used to play the violin which is the fiddle in English
Who else is scrolling food delivery apps now? 😂
Using 2k cycle for a uber work is a bit of delusional
Skype turned to Microsoft TEAMS - and that one thrives... so...
If people must use the service, do so. Otherwise, order from the restaurant directly or go pick it up yourself. I don't think these apps are a good deal at all. The only times I used them were in the early days of COVID where a $20 order becomes close to $40 after all the stupid fees and tips. How is that a good deal, exactly? Sometimes when I am out of town and don't have access to a car I will use it but again the prices are ridiculous- inflated base prices, high service and delivery fees and I have to tip. Yeah, screw that. I just got my own insulated bag and picked it up myself. The food is much warmer, I save almost 50% of the cost and I don't have to give a 20% tip for takeout.
I really only started using these sorts of apps, but my rule is essentially if I am going to use it (due to being sick, injured, or lazy...) i have to tip 25% or more.   Just my choice, but saying i know how much they get screwed and honestly... They are essentially people doing me a favor.
Not making money is a real problem with up and coming companies right now. It is a game where a very few people get rich. Venture capitalists invest in a company and get it growing by spending way more on sales & marketing than the company makes. Then push an IPO based on the wild growth, all the while operating with huge losses. The founders, VCs, and other executives make a bunch of money on stock. Of course those people never pay the price as the companies lurch toward their inevitable collapse. Its all smoke and mirrors. These companies aren't trying to build anything real. They are just focused on making a few people rich. Meanwhile, small profitable companies struggle to compete because they don't have the same budgets for sales and marketing and refuse to take on huge debt to operate at a loss because they know it is unsustainable and would kill the companies in the end. The system is just broken right now.
About the tip...that's somewhat of a US "thing", and delivery apps are NOT unique to the US, so how do the riders/drivers make money in places where you don't typically tip?
I never have and never will use a fake delivery service that is trying to shut down my local restaurants. I still regularly order pizza for delivery from local shops with actual employees.
"You gotta fucking tip". No you don´t. It is entirely a voluntary fee on top of the food and and service you already paid for. It´s not the costumer´s fault if the company doesn´t pay for it´s employees.
The devil cheated though, it was a fiddle competition and the guy brings a whole band.
Seriously? This is the era of cheap delivery for the consumer? After the service company fee/markup, delivery fee, and tip, the cost of the food basically doubles.
Did everyone forget how to make a sandwich?
You should report on a tip culture in us
You think that cake delivery was bad. I had a similar situations delivering just a single cookie one trio and a single serving of coffee on another! Both deliver to homes in affluent neighborhoods.
We now know putins nephew is who owns the off shore bank that is funding trump! Put him in prison !!
If I call my fav pizza place, they send an employee to deliver and it's always a great experience and I know them by name now. If I order online from the same pizza place it goes through one of these food services: twice it never showed up and once it was left on my stairs in the pouring rain with no knock/text/call, all with the tip paid ahead of time. I'll never order online again.
Imagine being so pathetic you sit on TV trying to lobby people to tip the works for them to make a living instead of going after the corporations employing them. John Oliver is such a pathetic joke.
If only we had some sort of government body that protected workers.   Republicans protect the wealthy and trick the working class into thinking they're helping them.
I never use these 3rd party services, I may if I had to like I was very sick or recovering from something and could not leave my home, the cost is just not worth it.
Oh good. Time to be guilted out of my doordash.  Edit: Wowwww. Stealing Skype jokes from Collegehumor.
Skype became the foundation for Microsoft Team which made(still does) more money than zoom
I just cook for myself I can’t afford the extra charges and I want to eat well healthy.
He's 100% right about The Devil Came Down to Georgia!
FYI, this is exactly how health insurance works. They squeeze everyone and do almost nothing.
Paraphrasing something said by Kara Swisher. "These apps are assisted-living for millennials." This is so true, to the fact millennials are blind to the actual problems they face and were given solutionism as a basis to distract us from the real issues.
I just don’t even understand how these companies aren’t profitable if they are underpaying their drivers and taking so much of the sales of the restaurants all while charging the customers a bunch of fees. I’d be curious what the difference is in business model between companies here in the US and those in Asia. I just always hear how good the delivery services are in Korea (although I think their delivery people don’t make a whole lot either). And I’m not completely sold that the customers are the ones who make out on the whole system because you are charged more for the food, charged a lot of fees plus need to tip. You’re paying an exorbitant amount for your order. The whole thing doesn’t make sense to me.
As suburbanites, we never use these delivery services. But we do get take out and pick it up. The frustrating thing is that we still have to go through a delivery service to place an online order. And we've notice there is a price difference between the services and a difference in the menu price. Sometimes we just call the order in because we're tired of feeding this industry.
Something from the fast food restaurant worker side of things. FFRs were always set up for two lines. The counter, and the drive through. They are staffed for this, they are built for this. Now, the owners and execs see dollar signs by offering delivery, however they do not change their staffing practices, nor do they upgrade the equipment to handle the higher volume. This adds to the stress on the worker.
Like this post if you watched this episode when it was accidentally uploaded on here on Sunday 😂
Delivery apps are way too expensive already. I can't afford them anymore.
Never again will I use any of these services. Have in the past, and 80% of the time, the food that we got was not complete, and the drivers just shrugged it off when questioned where the missing items where.
"The tyranny of the algorithm" is spot on. I work as an Uber driver and am highly rated - a super-high rating over thousands of trips. But at the odd times a passenger gives me a bad review, Uber never checks on me to hear my side. Instead, I get a message threatening to block me from the ap. Drivers are not seen nor supported by Uber.
I ordered from Panera directly. 2 hours later, food never came. Panera said “it’s sitting here on the counter, door dash never came for it, you have to call door dash.” I don’t have a door dash account, I ordered from Panera directly. The Panera in question has their own cars that deliver to my office daily. Welcome to hell.
Delivery sometimes is the only way some Americans can get groceries and meals as they may disabled or don't own a car. I did not realize that these delivery companies soak money from restaurants.  Can someone explain Instacart to me as I use that to order groceries from local supermarkets? I realize that many items are more expensive but I think Instacart only profits from the delivery fee.
I'm in Wisconsin and between fees and bad press I stopped using delivery apps in 2022, I think. Over the past six months I've done calls for pickup and one delivery from the store's website which had a grubhub driver. I'm a single guy and it mostly hasn't felt worth the cost.
Literally stopped using all of these places during the pandemic after about 6 tries… only one successful attempt that we felt comfortable with eating (every other order had food missing, & been picked over 🤢). The company was really mad when we complained. They treat you like you’re lying, it’s crazy.
F tipping!
The abuse of businesses & employees by delivery apps is appalling.   I don't use them.
Skype is teams now
I still call places that deliver on the phone. And I'm 38
Philip j Fry agrees that being a delivery driver is the most dangerous job.
Food delivery apps is one of the main reasons people are in debt. It is way too expensive and most of the people using them can’t afford it
Still never used Grubhub again since they wouldn't let me refund a meal that I got 2 hours late
Doordash pays the driver $2.00 for the order, no matter how far it is from the store.  The rest comes from tips.  Most people don't tip enough, not really thinking about the app paying drivers so little.  Drivers need to make $2 per mile to cover expenses and make minimum wage.  Around here the average trip is 5 miles, but the driver is usually 2 miles from the store, and have to drive back after the delivers so the total for the trip is really 12 miles.  You would have to tip $20 to actually pay the driver enough for the order.  It's never enough, and I can't pay all of my bills driving 60 hours per week. It's a real trap for the driver.  If you don't accept 70% of the orders offered to you for you last 100 orders of the month, you will not be able to get on the schedule or work when you want the following month.  Hours are cut to about 10 hours per week without the Top Dasher status, which is 70% acceptance rate.  So, you are forced to accept low paying orders that don't pay enough for fuel and tires, just for the opportunity to work for nothing the following month.
I kind of hope that the single slice of cake customer is watching this
I never used these delivery food apps once in my life.  They're too expensive
What john didn't mention was come tax time uncle Sam wants his cut the amount is outrageous. The only thing they offer a discount to a premium mile tracker app. I used to do doordash during the pandemic and as a second job after i moved out luckily i have a better paying job so i don't have to log in anymore. The wear and tear as well as maintenance that's on you. They won't even help if you get a ticket. If you're maybe trying to get maybe a little spending money or just want something to do on a day off that's fine i guess but as a main job no. I'm glad i don't rely on this anymore and yes the pay is horrible not worth using my gas and putting more miles to my car. Also at the beginning many apps like postmates, grubhub, doordash would give you a card to place an order, wait, them take it and it was horrible since these places don't pay for waiting either
I am a Doordash driver and they recently cut the pay in my area from a minimum of $5 a delivery to just $2.  It went from being just enough to make a living to now I am questioning whether or not I can continue.  It often costs me more for gas and time than I get from the delivery, leaving me to rely on tips.  Which on many orders I do not get, I have driven orders over 20 miles from the restaurant (which I must commute miles to get to) for fewer than $8 (and then I have to drive back, totaling almost 50 miles and over an hour of time). And on DD, if you don't constantly accept orders you become less likely to get more orders so you have to take the low paying ones hoping to get more better offers.  It is also true that ratings are a hugely stressful part of the job.
This market was invented to weaponize the middle classes against the people even lower than them. For the riches amusement.
We just ignoring Australian Man Valterri Bottas’ Australian Uber Eats ad. Sure, fine, I guess.
Before covid john used to be my favorite comedian ... i guess they fired the good writers as he went full political 🤷‍♂️
The last time I ordered delivery, the delivery guy "didn't have any change," and I accidentally pulled one of those math tricks where it makes sense at first, but I ended up taking 5 dollars from the delivery guy instead and only realized it 20 minutes later. I think it's better for all of us that I strap my kids in and pick up the food myself. (Also, fix the US tipping system so that people actually earn what they deserve, whether they're tipped or not.)
Sad people have to be told to tip and rate the drivers themselves fairly...
I uninstalled delivery apps in 2021 when I tried to order two soft tacos from a taco bell 2 miles away and the bill was going to be over $20 before tip.  Between the multiple service fees and upcharge of the items I refuse to use them. I call restaurants and pick it up myself now. I realize I'm fortunate enough where I can do this, but that bill was a huge turning point for me.
"as spaced out as a 9th grader trying to reach the page-limit"  Not sure I've ever heard of someone - to which this applies - and is able to utter the phrase
Tipping culture is absurd.
It took only eight minutes of viewing to like this video, specifically pausing at the "mafia margins".
As an occasional Uber and UberEats driver, I can confirm that only about 20% of people tip.  Most of those are the 'going out to drink' or 'coming home from drinking' folks.  The majority of the people I drive simply don't have cars, and are just paying to go to and from work.  I can't remember the last time I got a tip for delivering food, other than what Uber builds into the delivery.  That's why I usually decline food deliveries, unless they are very short distances.  It's mostly because the rides are so expensive now.  And I do think people believe drivers are getting a bigger cut than we are.
That Postmate ad was OD 😂
I don't want to control anyone's destiny with the push of a button!! I'm just a big stoned baby and I want my chimkin nuggies, John!!
Vampires better than leeches
I rarely use the apps anymore once I realized they were jacking up the prices from what I'd pay by picking up the food myself.
they need to change the tipping policy. I shouldn't have to pre tip, I should be able to pre tip at delivery at the door after I ensure my order is correct and on time. presently if I ever do order thru an app the tip is based off last experience, so yea that delivery person may get stiffed but this is why tips should be added after delivery. I get some people need to order delivery but why would you pay almost double the price of stuff if the restaurant is 5-6 min away from you to get it ???
An eggplant in leather fetish gear: a dream ad for the right wing. Please stop presenting things like that if we expect the movement to be taken seriously ffs
This is another instance where the US culture of tipping boggles my mind. Shouldn't these workers be paid by the company they've been hired by and not mainly by the customer?
At the restaurant at which I worked, Uber Eats, Grubhub and Doordash were  horrible burdens that screwed us out of pick-up orders and gave a tiny cut to the place...They suck...Also, I love the shots in that ad of restaurant workers, none of which are wearing gloves or hairnets...
Informative and funny as always. Gotta love John Oliver + everyone behind the scenes ❤❤❤
I’ll admit the devil and demons are fantastic musicians
At work, hearing the online order beep go off feels like being called by the annoying orange himself. 🍊
It's what happens when you let tech bros run things and they don't know what hard work is
US tipping culture needs to stop. Companies need to pay their delivery drivers fairly, as with waiters and any service worker.
I wish I would’ve been interviewed for this episode. I have a lot of things they would’ve wanted to hear.
typical slave drivers making people slave and overwork for pittance.
In Germany Grubhub is practically a monopoly. Everything is horrible.
When I lived in Maine I used to tip my door dash delivery person with weed and they loved it. I worked at the best dispensary in town😂😂😂
I'm sorry, I need more info on what a "bottom-friendly menu" is.
I do not believe for a second that this man has ever even seen weed. Not even on a picture.
I did Uber eats during the pandemic.  Can confirm the cloud of smoke emanating from the door,  and my smallest delivery was a single order of McD's french fries.
sorry im just not going to tip anybody anything.
15 to 30% from the restaurant _in addition to_ the extra $10 they tack on to the bill in various fees?  Screw that from now on if I'm working late its Hot Pockets for dinner.
What about ordering during the night of The Purge?  ME: Orders Arby's during The Purge. DRIVER [Knocks at door]: Here's your Reuben sandwich with fries. Sorry that I'm late. I had to hide in a dumpster from a (g)rape gang. ME [Looks in bag]: These are crinkle fries. I ordered curly fries. DRIVER: Dude, I was stabbed in the thigh by teenagers who carjacked me. I made it here on foot, and you only tipped 10%. ME [Uncaring]: You forgot my Jamocha shake.
@2:04 JOHN GOT BARS!?!😂
I do DoorDash for supplementary income; I’m the household partner while my better half can work full time.  Doing Dashes gets me between 15-25/hr, in relatively poor West Virginia. I only do mornings, and I have the option to handle cash disabled.  I usually end up delivering Starbucks and Chick-Fil-A to hospitals during this shift - I feel I’m performing a public service after seeing how exhausted ER staff always are. Doing only morning/midday virtually eliminates crime risks, and I’m already in a safe area. I’m lucky.
And based on their spending, the only reason they’re not profitable is because they are actively trying to stay in control, not make money
Great episode like always!
As a part-time driver, myself, the one thing i do really enjoy is having the flexibility. I am not the driver Jon is talking about in this piece, though. I have medical insurance through my other job, and if the weather is shit i just won't go out. I have that choice. I won't take no tip orders. I won't take orders less than 2.00 a mile. I have very clear boundaries for what i am willing to do for money.  To me, the algorithm is like a game. How can i beat it today and still make good money?
2:38 reminds of the good ol College Humour Skype CEO sketch....   "WHAT THE FUCK IS ZOOM?!??!?"
I stopped using Uber Eats for restaurants that are very close to me. I call up the restaurant and go pick it up later. Save about $12 on each order.
these apps are a rip off even for the customer. ive ordered door dash 3 times and only once did  i get something good and it was way over priced. one time i got nothing and had to call india for my refund. and the other time it was an hour and a half to get cold food that wasnt any good even if it was hot . and of course i had already payed a nice tip to the app for the longest wait in delivery history
shout out to whoever runs the Last Week Tonight youtube channel and uploaded the full episode momentarily on Sunday. You a real one.
Regarding tipping why do they charge us such  service fee. The service fee should include tipping
Honestly never used them. I like picking up food for myself. I just don’t get the idea of not having 10 minutes to drive or whatever
I somehow have neve used these even once.
Ima skip this one ok. Cannot change my lifestyle. I will not elaborate
"You can't spell Millennial without three mass L's"  be honest John, how long where you waiting to spring that one on us?
Rideshare Apps also take up to 70% of riders’ fare, drivers get as little as 30%.   The ride share company CEOs have a lie, smear, libel, slander and smear campaign against drivers with quirky, screwy, fuzzy math to make carefully contrived data talking points to make people think drivers make good money and the Uber Lyft fare take is very small.  Nothing could be further from the truth. See YouTubers   1. “Rideshare Professor” (Torsten organizes Protests/strikes); Lots good info combined with cutting emotions, anger, resentment and contempt for Uber & Lyft, companies he once loved.  2.  “Rideshare Guy” where Sergio also does “Show Me The Money” and other shows.  Sergio does lots of shows on how Uber & Lyft continuously come up with new, unlimited ways to cheat drivers and riders in creative, hard to detect, small and big ways and forever coming up with new ways.   For example, Sergio is convinced Uber Lyft repackage commercial insurance costs with something like a 300 % markup. Then Uber Lyft claims this is all expense and subtracts the entire jacked up commercial insurance from Uber & Lyft’s fare take to make it look much smaller.  Sergio is an expert at dissecting Uber & Lyft’s fuzzy math to show lying and cheating of drivers. It’s so bad it’s almost like Uber & Lyft’s main job is to lie to and cheat drivers and Rideshare is just their vehicle to do so.  Oddly, Sergio, like Torsten, once loved Uber & Lyft, whom over the years have gone to the dark side.
As a doordash driver, I had no idea that the restaurants were only getting half the money. 💀
Please people treat food delivery workers the same way that you would want to be treated. Be polite and tip well. If you can tip in cash as well and order directly from the restaurant when it is possible.
I order food pretty often, but I usually call to make the order or use whatever they have on their website to directly order and then pick up myself. I didn't realize all this nonsense these delivery apps are pulling, but I'm even more glad of how I do things now!
Gotta love that they did a video on the impacts of delivery driver apps while ignoring one of the largest wage theft lawsuits and settlements against such a company (EatStreet) who, through various means, stole around $10 million from their employees.
This is not at all the point, but man, M Street Baking Company in Howell, MI looks legit!
All my delivery drivers have to cross multiple bridges. Nothing is going on. I just live in Pittsburgh.
Don’t get it confused we’re not making money every time we order on the app they are severely under charging us what it cost and because of that nobody gets paid people get hurt and we the consumer paid 40 bucks for $15 meal
A lot of these restaurants are lucky people are not visiting them in person, they would not eat in such filthy places.
Really feels like the answer is to not use these sites… I can’t believe these companies aren’t profiting at this point. We paid $30 in fees last night on a $60 order before tip… if they’re squeezing fees from consumers and half of the profits from restaurants how on earth are they not profitable. If this much isn’t enough they shouldn’t exist.
The devil’s part is sooooo much better
"that was the test and you failed it" 😅
JON, PLEASE TRACK DOWN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ORDERED THAT CAKE. Hahahahaha, ughhhhhh wtf?
How many people think John Oliver ran this piece because someone forgot to deliver his milkshake
Buy a gift, or start an orphanage.
Mandatory tipping is stupid and should be stopped. If a company can't pay their workers without tips then they should fail and go bankrupt.
But Grubhub doesn't feel cheap? I stopped using it bc it was adding so much money to the orders.
I used to work in food delivery for Uber Eats on my bicycle as one of my jobs in college.  I lived in West Philly. I was near the part of town where the sewer let out. I had to ride through someone’s poop during a flood to get only $8…
It's never too early to get depressed by a topic that I was completely unaware of.
Capitalism is a grift. I am proud to say I have never used a delivery app.
I’m so glad I don’t use these apps.
Tipping culture can go fucking die.  I've never had a job where I rely on tips, but i understand that it fucking sucks if  the customer's perception of the job I did affects how i get paid.  Unless you're an actual performer, customers failing to recognizing your competence shouldn't affect your pay.
I am happy with my portion of the 58% and the orders are always available. Cha Ching!
TIPPING ISNT MANDATORY. I pay the price of the thing, it is not my job to pay the worker's salary. Change your job laws instead
The parent company of grubhub is justeat and they are exchange listed at Euronext and at least they are quite profitable making around 1bn in net income.  That does of course not change the overall point made in the video.
One of my spirit animals right here, this show just never misses
I was wondering where the tip option on Uber eats went shits weird
Sorry Jon but this is lame and inaccurate.  Door Dash has you rate the resteraunt and delivery person seperately and id you rate low it follows up asking for the reasons.  This is in fact great.  Most delivery drivers do a great job, but I've had a few who OBVIOUSLY should not be doing deliveries.  People who do poorly and mishandle food whould not be wotking, I hope it impacts them.
As a restaurant manager this hits home, I feel bad for the drivers yet worse for my staff. It's one of those issues that have to be addressed,  thank you John Oliver
Here is also one of the drawbacks is that as long as you pass the background check you are good to go so your delivery guy varies from Bob supplementing his social security to Johnny working till the next fix
Gift or start an orphanage? I almost fell down from laughter.
I use to be a dasher. You use to make good money but then started fucking us. And the customers would tip like shit for no reason.
Thank goodness I live in Europe where these apps can somehow manage to get by without causing issues.
UBI, government subsidized living wage , universal healthcare, no-cost education (college, trade school, etc.), a jobs guarantee, a shift toward hemp fuel, etc. all things that would help humans.
LOL. This is what Home Depot and Lowes did to the local hardware stores. The "squeeze".
The minimum wage in my country is 12,41 Euros (about 13,50 USD) and the food delivery person doesn't  drive their own car or bike. (And if they do, they get compensated for it). I am tipping a delivery driver about 2 to 4 Euros. It's a nice thing to do, but they don't have to rely on tipps.
Idk.. just because it's some people's only job doesn't mean it should be. It's a shit gig so don't do it. The service industry still needs help and they'll hire you as an EMPLOYEE. I think it's true that people are doing the job out of convenience and feel like they *can't* have a scheduled job. What did we do before gig jobs? We worked scheduled hours. Even when it's not convenient.
4:45 So you got back home from work and order then. Why not buy food on the way back home? That's what I do. It's a lot cheaper, I don't have to wait, and I know, that nobody messed with my food.
4:50 I would, but I didn’t start working for Blockbuster until 2004!
Listening this as I deliver doordash and Uber eats before I go to my real job 😂
bad timing as Uber Eats just released a partnership with Waymo few hours ago :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F0EYi5dVhw
I'm 40 years old and I NEVER liked ordering food for delivery. Delivery fee and tip on top of the cost of what's being ordered? Psh, I'm not made of money.
Never give tips its the only way to reverse the terrible tipping culture that the companies want to spread to play their employees less.
Well, they can blame their woke brethren for why they can’t enjoy Harry Potter anymore.
Man I remember getting stuck waiting at a restaurant for 40 minutes because I had to place the order when I arrived (which I just learned was probably because the restaurant didn’t list themselves), and then making the delivery to find out I didn’t get tipped. So factoring travel time to and from the restaurant I got like $4 for an hour of my time.
Wait wait wait - your takeaway is that the consumers need to step up their rating and tipping games??? What an absolute betrayal.
😂 "Happy Easter, btw"
DoorDash driver stole my food twice and the company didn’t do anything about it, they didn’t even give me the tips back because I ended up going to the restaurant myself and picking up the food.
I'm sorry but John Oliver needed more research on this.  If these companies can afford hundreds of millions to lobby, they are NOT in the negatives or barely making a profit. They obviously have the money, it's just that funny stuff is happening with the paper trails 🔍
I have never used door dash because the first time I tried it was going to cost 20 bucks to get an 8 dollar fast food hamburger meal.
SO much of this problem could be alleviated if US actually have more walkable cities.
John is correct, the Devil definitely beat Johnny. It's not really even close.

17:04 Jon defending the devil and then trying to gatekeep heaven is the most hypocritical shit ever
aside from these actual disgusting companies. I find it alarming people in new york do not speak English, and you need to voice over them...... but I'm not from the USA so maybe its normal there now.
It’s just a shit business model. Food is bad, prices are high, it makes restaurants worse and lowers customer experience for too much money. It’s like no matter where you order from, it’s convenience store price and convenience store quality. Bad for restaurants, bad for diners. That employees are also victims is of no surprise. If you ever use these services without strict medical need, you’re not trying.
About a quarter of my coffee was spilled last time I ordered Dunkin' Donuts on Postmates. All I could think of is the time I was bringing dunkin' donuts home and I had to slam on my brakes and spilled a bunch of shit in my car. I didn't say a word because I have no idea what happened while the driver was on their way to my house. Maybe they were reckless? Maybe they were rough with my food? Or maybe they avoided a car accident.   You can't tell, so I rated the delivery as great.
Bravo
Wow, I was just watching this when my door bell rang and it was food delivery. I didn't order anything by the way.
John Oliver if you were a true stoner  like me then , ....wait..., I forgot what I was talking about..
Skype. Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time. A long time...
Skype just became Microsoft Teams
I've loved John Oliver since his brilliant journalism and presentation touches were on the Daily Show and his biting standup was crushing it. He and his incredible team still haven't lost their touch after all these years.
There are grub huh drivers who order in their local area, and give bad reviews so that they can make more money. Then they get their friends to do it too. It's messed up.  I've never ordered or driven for the company once because i know the implications of letting the app run wild.  I already lost a job to it.
I pay around 30% more when I order through Uber Eats when I don't pick it up. And I ALWAYS tip. I try not to order through apps as much as I can because I know how much restaurants are ripped off by these apps. One of my best friends had an Italian Restaurant and he said that all his profit was taking by these apps...and when he raised his price on the menu on the app, the app raised the fee for him also.
I work as a waiter and I think that tipping is the worst. We need to move away from it and force companies to pay living wages instead.
Kind of Ironic that he’s covering food delivery after Israel str8 up bo**ed a van with food on its roof.
I still call to my usualy place, they once said that they´d prefer if i call instead of ordering thru internet because it costs them less so I´ve done that ever since, never used any app in any case, also I´m 37 years young so that checks out :
IMMEDIATELY CLICKED. Haven’t watched yet but I know they doing some shady shit!
I feel very old, I’ve never used any such service. I drive myself in to pick up food 😅
i asked a local thai restaurant how much these apps took from them, i never used them again. i'm happy to *gasp* make an phone call for my order
If I order online, I go directly to the restaurant's website. Other than big chain pizza, which typically has it's own drivers, I'll go pick it up. Even during peak COVID shutdown. I ordered from my favorite local puzza place once a week while I was at work and would go pick it up. Then when home, I would do this for other local restaurants. Not only do you advoid the exploitative food delivery companies, you still support a restaurant, and it cost less for you.
"But you gotta f*cking tip!" Yeah, no thanks. You don't. At all.
Kennedy 2024 ❤🎉
7:00 To be fair, would those sells have existed if GrubHub wasn't delivering for them? And it's mind blowing to me EVEN WITH all this, these companies still make NO PROFIT. How? They have minimal overhead, no infrastructure to maintain really besides an app ( a few developers?) and are basically just riding off other people's businesses. Must be horribly inefficient. Or spending absurd money on lobbying and what not.
I almost lost my car due to working for doordash since they will never cover the cost of repairs for your vehicle. Luckily I have a great support system in my corner to help out, which says alot these companies.
3:18 My family doesn't *sell* me food, they just invite me every time, and so do I. Is my family the only one? Anyone here, whose family sells them food?
Sometimes I feel these delivery companies are a scam. They get VC funded claiming market disruptive idea. Then  they spend that money to be 'loss leader' and outlive other cash strapped companies. They know they are not profitable will never be profitable. So how will the VC(Investor) recover the his investment?  By IPO. Transfer all the loss to the retail investor fooled by the absolute bonkers of a valuation, which are done by audit companies who are incentivized to keep valuation high. The founder will keep leeching the company with high salaries and unwarranted business expenses like private jets and stuff. That too until the the company is bankrupt.  Who gets the raw end of the deal retail investors, small businesses, gig workers, etc. The investor and the founder made money and they left.
I did DoorDash for five years, I still have beef with them! Fix your crap DoorDash!
"Numbers Being Yelled at You with Human Squidward" is totally what this show is called in another universe. 😂
up to 30% commission fee per delivery transaction? Dude the cartel tax is like 20%
I used to be a taxi driver for a local company before Uber and while it took over. I hung in there until the pandemic in 2020 but then it was just too much. I lost money done nights paying for gas. The locals liked us and we didn't treat people like yellow cab does. Less than a year after leaving the company went under and Uber jacked up their rates.  If there's a concert or show, guess what? Triple price hike.
And if people recognize disabilities and asked for accommodations.
Lots of losers in the comments. It’s kinda sad tbh
TIP YOUR BARTENDERS!!! <3
14:14 - 15:00 visions of 'Death Stranding'
Why dont those apps charge based on income?
I love how the video chapter titles are just world/universe destroying scenarios
Thank you for this video. I did doordash but now I do shipt grocery delivery.  I lived in wixom but I recently moved to Flint Michigan and it's rough. I might drive 20 minutes to the store to shop their order then 15 minutes to their home and 15 minutes back to the store to do another order and they don't tip. Turns out here there's not as many orders so I might have to drive to another city at least 20 minutes away to take another order. I make as little as $6 if they don't tip. I bought this car through Carvana, big mistake. I have 4 more years to pay off my car. Probably asking why do you keep doing this job? I have severe anxiety and depression this job allows me to go home if it's too much also it allows me to work around my significant others job and I'm available to pick up my kid from school. He's right about the five-star rating though. There is a ranking system based on the Stars you give us. So I'll get less orders and for less pay if you rank me anything other than five stars. If you're rating goes too low then you'll lose your job.
If you dont like food delivery apps dont use food delivery apps! Its so simple! Only woke people use these apps and you're so lazy, yes you deserve to be charged a lot of money and shit service. The people who think they can make thisntheir job are just as stupid.
To be honest, i disagree with John on one major point.  He said that the consumer is the only one who benefits from this whole arrangement, but we really dont that much.  Yeah we get food in a slightly more convenient way, but the price offsets make it not worth bothering with.  I havent even bothered having a food delivery app on my phone in years (basically as soon as the pandemic was over) because its just too damn expensive.  Why pay 3-4x what a meal is worth when i can just drive a mile to the place and pick it up myself?

He's right about "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm too poor to use these apps.
nah, tips won't save the issues, the workers and the restaurants should unionize and start pressing from the other direction, there is no excuse to paying servers subpar wages and then shame ppl into tipping ( which is a thoughtful generous act), tipping is like giving paracetamole to a fever caused by an infection, unless you treat the cause, the problem will just worsen
Jon definitely sold his soul
Nobody understands that you need to tip based on hourly wage or else it's taking advantage
As a disabled person I sometimes rely on these apps to have food when I don't have energy so it's a shame the entire system is so shitty.  It's been massively helpful the last half decade or so that I have had access to them.  I definitely always tip my best and I don't think I have ever given a driver a low rating (I've obviously gotten lucky in no major incidents with drivers, the worst just some being dropped off at the wrong house).
Oliver as always  hit the nail on the head . As you can imagine this isn't just happening in the US but around the world. In india, the two food delivery  behemoths Zomato and Swiggy are doing the exact same things. They have also started subscription models where you pay something upfront and won't be charged any delivery fee for a month or more if the order is above a threshold. I wonder how that is turning out for the delivery people.
When I lost my job due to covid, I was a dasher. The base pay (before tip and surge pricing) where I live is $2.50 per delivery. Luckily, it was good during covid, but those golden days are long gone. Waiting in parking lots for 15-20 minutes, hoping you get an order, getting reported because you wouldn't deliver alcohol to minors, it sucks now.    Imagine doing deliveries during covid and not having health insurance. It was terrifying.
Why dont those apps charge based on income?
Did you just ask the laziest people in the world to push a button to give a good review and tip? Or actually call a restaurant and do some work to find out if they're hurting it's business?  Gtf outta here. If they were willing to do that, they'd have just driven to the place and got their food.
Who even meets their delivery drivers?  I have the option to leave it at my door selected by default, I don't have the opportunity to treat them poorly because I'm getting delivery specifically because I don't want to talk to anyone.
Working with delivery apps has become another Nash Equilibrium, just like taking credit cards. It makes money for the restaurants that take advantage, unless they all do, in which case it hurts everyone everyone involved because no one has an advantage and it costs them money.
The devil cheated by bringing in the band of demons.  Judgement goes to Johnny by default.
Those Skype jokes ripped off College Humor 😂
When are y’all doing a piece on Temu
How John gets in on the Devil Goes Down to Georgia is just more gold, on top of gold.
Don't be a lazy ass and either make your own food or go out and eat.
Why dont those apps charge based on income?
Sorry but I am not sympathetic to the resteraunts not wanting delivery.  The ones who sign up and pay large percentages, that I can have sympathy for.  But if a resteraunt offers carry out, bluntly, its none of their busi ess who buys it and what they do with it afterwards.  They get paid FULL PRICE.  Businesses don't get to discriminate about who can shop there.  Remember the big deal religious people made about not making wedding cakes for gay couples?  Th3y don't get to do that, if you sell to the public you have to sell to everyone.  If someone is enterprising and gets paid to carry food from a resteraunt to so eone else, that is thrn between the delivery person/company and the buyer.  I do think it needs to be made clear that the delivery company isn't the resteraunt.  If the delivery company screws up that is on them, not the resteraunt.  But that is just truthful communication which can be imposed if necessary.
Great job, John. However, you forgot to mention one thing: the actual average payout of a delivery to the driver before any tip. In my market (Pittsburgh, PA), I was offered a delivery order yesterday from UberEats that paid 2.70$US for a 5 mile trip - in a gas-powered vehicle. The average is anywhere between 2$ and 6$ for driving, on average again, 5 miles to a restaurant, waiting there for 2 to 45 minutes, and then driving an average of 10-20 miles to the customer. (And, yes, on Ubereats and GH the driver sees the total with the tip before we choose whether or not to accept the order. DD has some weird archaic formula that maxes out how much they'll show you the order is worth until you complete it.)  Those company reps are flat-out lying about not making a profit. They absolutely are, they just hide it by re-investing it in R&D (an Uber scheme) or they pay out their board/investors/shareholders before counting profit, making sure nothing is left. Hell, Uber just announced their "first" profitable year last year, so how is Ubereats not making money again exactly?  Now, please, do one completely ripping open rideshares and how the people owning them have stolen billions in labor and vehicle life from drivers.
The Devil went down to Georgia bit is lifted from a TikTok video by someone else..
I work at Circle K. Tons of Uber and Lyft drivers come in for gas. So many of them have zero idea that they should be saving their gas reciepts for when they file taxes, because many of them seem pretty unaware that they even need to  file taxes, much less that they can deduct expenses related to their car.   These apps should be required to educate their drivers on these things. I know its just one in a huge list of disgusting abuses by these companies, but it just really upsets me.
Skype didn't actually fuck up. It became Teams
Excuse you? These apps are cheaper for the customer? Bullshit. A typical $30 food order suddenly becomes $60+ on any of these fucking apps. Stop lying.
In a sense it seems to me, america still is adicted to slavery. just can't let go of that sweet indentured servitude. Making profits of the time and health of others without giving them the means to a decent life. Sure we live in different times with more advanced technologies and people seemingly don't have to do these jobs ... sure, but how else could they make a living if nothing else is available to them?
back in the day, one of the fastest & best bike messengers in NYC was one-legged on custom racing bike. he was a legend
They missed an opportunity to talk about the apps allowing customers to tip bait
I really don't want to brag about it, I really don't, but when I see these videos, I realize how bad some things are in the US. A lot of things would simply be unthinkable in the EU. I get the impression that the USA is the testing ground for capitalism, according to the motto, how far can companies take it to the extreme... kind of a shame
John Oliver.  Your shows are excellent.  I'd like to add one thing.  Buying through an App or even buying from a take-out directly on a phone means one doesn't get to see where the food is made and what goes into it.  I still prefer popping into a shop, choosing my potatoes and onions, or whatever or checking the sell-buy date on a packet of buns and it's not that hard to do.  Even if one has a taste for ready-made food, one can get it at a deli or bakery.  Besides, the food one gets never looks like the photograph on the App or the take-out menu anyway, does it?  Thanks for your reports.  They are smart, informative and funny.  Thank you.
This is why i just cook food i get seconds 4 free 😋
On DoorDash I am penalized for not taking orders that pay 2 dollars to drive for an hour. But it’ll keep showing them to me if people don’t tip. The money we are paid is pretty much 80% from the customers tips. A lot of people in my area don’t tip because they don’t believe in it, they post on the local Facebook group that we should get “real jobs” if we want to be paid fairly. They also proclaim that they don’t even tip waitstaff. Here’s the thing: I have a college degree, I am trying to get a “real job”. I have been searching for 4 months and gotten no callbacks. Only automated replies from the Ai that read the resumes letting me know they found someone better suited to the position, and that is really dehumanizing. John should cover how the job market is being affected by AI again soon. AI already rules a lot of lower income people’s lives, an algorithm decides if I have enough money to live each month on DoorDash, and AI decides that my resume isn’t best suited for jobs I meet the requirements for. I am currently Fixing people’s cars, doing independent photography, and delivering food with my business and accounting degree. If I find a real job I would. Furthermore, when I try to send a thank you email to the AI overlords for giving me the opportunity to apply, I find that the company I’m applying to doesn’t have a hiring services/management email address and my email is returned unsent, they all use noreply@ such and such email addresses to dismiss prospective applicants. It makes me feel really shitty to be treated this poorly by a computer.
I can proudly say I’ve never used one of these apps
I'm going to keep "Raw dogging the air" in my back pocket.
I call significant bullshit that these companies are losing money. If they have $50M to blow on lobbying they are doing fine. They are just greedy and disgusting.
Door dash in aouth jersey was 20 an hour minus vehicle costs last year. This year its under 14 minus vehicle costs.
@drewisgooden did this story years ago. Even had the same conclusion of "what are we doing when food delivery is so expensive, yet everyone involved is still losing money?"
So, that is why my 40.00 order  from a place i wont name  costs me about 80.00. Thing is i have to get everything delivered to my house even groceries because i live in the woods and my brother "Borrowed"  my only means of transportation years ago and never gave it back .
Remember when this popped up on Monday Morning as the full episode? Sure hope that intern didn't get fired for that
Diddy do it or Diddy don it? Con-phoo-zon of the highest orda. Next video about this, plz.
Sounds like drivers get all of the headaches of being an employee with none of the benefits.  Sounds like gig apps are the new mafia.  Sound like they are manipulating earnings potential and disciplining drivers as if they were employees.  Sounds like they are being allowed to break the law.
Tip in cash. 100% can go to the driver
CEO of doordash says he started DD to help restaurants because his parents worked hard running their restaurants yo raise him. Thats insulting.
The very loud _"what?!?!"_ at the weird pride ad 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So… capitalist drive for profit through exploitation for the win?
I just noticed the other day the food at a particular restaurant was like $5 dollars more expensive on the app then at the restaurant. 🤦🏽‍♂️
The consumer shouldn't feel forced to make up the difference for companies that insist on lowballing their workers.  Food service insists on doing this cause they know the blame is gonna land squarely on the consumers and NOT THEM.    I've stopped with food apps cause I'm done with tipping for my food being delivered elsewhere and paying for all around shit service, while the only remedy is 'here's some credits to keep this cycle going'.  If I can't go get it myself, screw it.  This nation needs to start taking proper accountability for what it's doing to force people to have to do THIS to even attempt to make ends meet.  Tipping Culture is yet another in a longer list of 'Things That Shouldn't Be But Is, Cause Folks Don't Know How To Effectively Stamp Stuff Out Before It Gets Out Of Control' in this nation.
Waitr/ASAP just shut down
Ads? What are those?  Also, I could go for some pad thai.
These supposed non profitable companies would probably be profitable if they weren’t spending 100’s of millions to lobby to stiff the ppl that make them money.
Every broke person seems to be addicted to these apps.
It’s so funny how it’s so rare to build institutions right.
The Apps don't make MONEY? How much are the CEOs making?????
The problem with these apps is that they are driving away their own customers.. how are you going to take one person's decent tip and batch it up together with other orders that aren't tippers. Getting one customer to pay for 3 deliveries is asinine..  They steal tips too. People who are shoppers themselves put in orders only for it to be advertised WITH OUT A TIP.   these apps don't need more of your money we need oversight
I treat my door dash  with love they bring me food!  Treat them like gold, the pandemic introduced me.  Hate the Corp love the driver.
I have started tipping only in cash whenever possible, and a minimum of five dollars no matter how small meal
Wasnt the whole point of giving delivery workers an hourly wage in NY for them to not depend on tips?   Unless you're making them deliver your food through a blizzard or a storm, theres no reason to tip them.
There is a direct connection between how much weed I smoke and how much I use delivery apps.
I don’t see why millennials can’t enjoy Harry Potter? It’s just older as a series now
So it has to be said that the greatest employer to the American workforce is only fans and delivery apps. No one else is trying to provide jobs
Not gonna lie, I'm a little disappointed that this segment didn't touch on the fact that these services don't appear to vet their delivery people at all. The number of orders I've seen go out into cars reeking of fentanyl is soul-crushing (and believe me, we see enough of it from other sources that I know). And that's with my workplace blacklisting every single driver we have that kind of problem with. Most of them are back within the month on a different service or the same one under someone else's name.  I know John wants to take the workers' side in this and I don't fault him for that, but part of holding the companies accountable means making sure that they hold their public-facing employees to a certain standard.
i was not expecting to see the bottom friendly ad again after the kwite video, talk about 3 degrees of separation
if you are ordering 1 piece of cake order 2 and give the other one to the delivery person
Lately whenever I get delivery I have been unable to tip simply because I didn't have any extra money.
Don't forget to tip John Oliver and rate him 5 stars.
a lot of restaurants around me are no longer working with grub hub and door dash. They charge more than the menu prices in a lot of cases on top of their fees.
#1 ❤ #LastWeekTonight !!
Every single thing that is alleged here is 100% correct. Parasitic entity
I am not tipping. I will only pay what the up front price because that is what I agreed to. Nothing more and nothing less. If business cannot pay workers fairly at that price, then raise prices.
So I worked for the 2 top food delivery apps and made some decent money from my area. Also working 58 hours a week. But I'm definitely for taking the driver back to the diner.
Why do all these American companies expect infinite growth and want to become a monopoly.
Is DoorDash owned by the CCP?
I'm a boy. Girls would say ruin door dash. I have never seen a guests food messed with. I refuse to start now .
I only order from restaurants that employ their own drivers. I worked in the industry for decades and have dealt with the apps enough to see the downside
Why should gay parts go to gay actors? Why can’t anyone play anything? THATS WHAT ACTING IS!!! End the nonsense.
14:56  This is a terrible example. Most people already have a vehicle.
I don't know if it's just Grub Hub, or bad across the board, but as a customer, I deal with fee too. Recently, my Grub Hub bill [Popeye] came to over $80. I ordered the same things from Popeye, a few days later, for pick-up as comparison, and total was around $40. So, Grub Hub doubles my bill for delivery.
That Kevin Ross video is a common thing in America. It’s called perseverance porn. It’s where you’ll see a video that has a clearly fucked thing going on but it’s packaged like this feel good story. Like “4th grader sells lemonade to pay of student lunch debt.” Like yeah the kids gridding but he shouldn’t fucking have to.
Capitalism, the best system for bankrupting 98% of the population 😂
The entire industry is predicated on customer lazyness…. 😂
That helmet is actually the most ridiculous part.  It's paper thin!!!!!!  Provide your workers a safe worplace.
8:24 Not sure GrubHub still does this but at one point in the last couple of years they would send the driver to a non participating restaurant, expect the driver to place the order and wait for it, instruct the driver NOT to say it was for GrubHub and then to either pay for it themselves for future reimbursement or use the “credit card” they send drivers to pay for it.  Very unseemly imo.
We want the full episode just like it was uploaded before plssss
DO NOT TIP! if you do, you support the system if you support the system, you are partially to blame for its issues.
As always great job
Always check the restaurants website because sometimes they have their own delivery fulfillment thing like toasttab or whatever.
Orphanage  or Human Traffickers ?
I tried working for grub hub and instacart and Uber eats and I made zero profit I don't understand how people make money like that
As long as you don't use Door Dash. They deliver to the nearest corner & you need to go & find it before someone else, if the don't "taste" it first!
Use Drones and AI, problem solved 😂
I'm not from the US, so I might just be completely wrong, but I think most restaurants still either let you pick up your food yourself, deliver with their own drivers or both. Just go to the website of the restaurant instead of the app and see what they offer and don't do it with the app. I know you also kind of support the workers by ordering through the app, but I think in the end it does more harm than good because you also support bad business practices at the same time.
Just listening to the Tip-culture in America makes me sick. I dont know how you can live with it...
They aren't profitable, but they can spend $ 184 million on lobbying? Shameful
I guess that full episode upload WAS a mistake. Glad I watched it when I could hahaha. Someone definitely got in trouble.   Also, if that one episode is typical of a full show, Im definitely NOT paying for HBO Max. I'm just gonna keep waiting for the main stories to be uploaded to YouTube. Considering that the main story is like 65% of the show I feel I really won't miss much.
As someone smoking their morning weed, I approve this message.
lol geez bicycles are expensive! I remember my first car in HS cost a little over $1000 that I had saved up the year b4 working at subway. I think min. wage was about 2 or 3 an hour. lol ffs. min. wage doesn't need to go up. things should just be cheaper. like why is every getting so expensive when technology should make it cheaper to make things? 🤔
Just stop using delivery apps
It sucks but it's true. 5 stars is good 4.9 and below is a 1 star review for workers
Who wants to see Biden gone and never seen again..
I've also heard that the customer service of the Apps is non-existent. Many times I would be at a food shoot, and the owner would ask me if I could help him with a problem they had with the App.
It's pretty wild how hard they're shanking the restaurants considering how hard they shank the customer. On any given $40 order of food you're probably paying $60 to $70 after the fees are applied.
I do uber eats and tips make up 75% or more of my earnings. I'd be happy to share some real numbers, but it wouldn't sirprise me if they have someone creeping the comments here. And i DO need the job.
Effing millennials
Come own John, you’re not going to ruin this for me are you?
All food delivery ads throughout lmao
I finally work in a restaurant that doesn't do carry out unless you call the store directly it's so much easier
Is it really so funny to hear that some people drink alcohol and use cannabis, you popcorn-munching fools? --- hey Grubhub...guess what? My FAMILY and FRIENDS do not FORCE me to give them 20% tip...they all know how to COOK and they find time to SHOP (because that is part of their LIVES)  Food delivery and overpriced, trash-packed meal plans are for LAZY and ENTITLED people.  But if you own a restaurant, you could either buy a car, hire people, pay them, cover their benefits, insure them and the car, pay for repairs, and depreciation to deliver to lazy people yourself... or you can pay for one of the delivery services which bring you new customers and more orders.
I feel like I’ve seen this before. :3
i am SOOOOOOOO glad i've never once even downloaded one of those aps
Ask any musician about the "gig economy" . Oh joy. P.S.. My dad was in the food business.  It's tough, that's why I always tip well.
Wait wasn’t this posted a few days ago?
For years I've been bothered by those 4 dots on the bottom, center screen. I love this show, but I think they can adjust the back drop. Lol.
I'm glad I've never used any of these app and never will.
But what about your episode on how tipping is very good? Tip more? Sounds like the problems is just getting compounded even worse.
i dont use them at all b/c i got tired of the apps sending creepers to my door. the last dude stood in my hall way for 5 minutes taking pictures, not of the delivered food, but the hallway itself and the surroundings.   caught him on our doorbell cam.  final straw.
around 20:00 . this is exactly what Amazon used to do. only the last 5 years or so, it has been making real profits. before then, they were losing money bigtime. all for the chance of booting out competitors and then setting the price instead of following it.
Papa Johns is guilty of this. You order from their website or app. And then you get a door dash text saying your dasher is on their way with your pizza. Then the dasher shows up and just stuck with luke warm pizza because they get 4 orders at once.
I don't use delivery apps, never have and never will. Too damn expensive and a waste of money. I'll just drive and grab my own food.
My lifetime I basically have learned that capitalism is a game in which the only way to win is to skirt the rules as much as possible, and when you can’t break the rules, you just pay lots of money to have them changed to what you want them to be. In fact, you actually should spend more money than it would actually cost you to just do what the new rules would be asking you to do which I guess is just like a corporate principal or something. They’re all going to spend $184 million I mean, realistically they could’ve just gone with what the new rules was going to tell them to do and they probably would’ve spent less fucking money. I don’t understand how people shill for corporations
I mean they called themselves *Grub* hub duh ^^
The fact that you think millennials can afford food delivery is PRECIOUS.
They dotn make morny because they are waiitng for automated deliveries....thsts also the reason you can't buy public stocks on any of these companies....its the dame thing as costco taking loses to make more moeny on the backend by selling them other shit
Imagine paying almost double what the restaurant charges for food and calling it a subsidy. We desperately need financial education in schools.
You already released the full episode Sunday 😊
How fucking conceited that at first sight they make a marriage proposal that sounds more like a fuck you i eat your babies ... Who the fuck are those people...we don't.
sorry but i dont tip. its a bad system and i wont be apart of it
Many of the restaurant owners I've talked to, don't like the cut that the Apps take. Some were also paying a monthly account charge. I did hear of some bad drivers; for example, one took a sandwich from an order, and claimed that the restaurant made the mistake. Incidents like this caused many restaurants to take photos of the completed order to prove what was given to the driver.
Disappointed by the amount of comments here from people that are STILL not comprehending that delivery app drivers are not "employees" of these companies.  They use independent contractor loopholes to put the costs of operating the business on the drivers. Vehicle, fuel, maintenance, taxes, licensing, etc. All the drivers' responsibility. No benefits. No protections. Despite their best efforts to treat these drivers like employees in a punitive sense (such as deactivating their accounts for refusing orders that do not pay enough to cover the fuel the cost.) While strongarming the resteraunts into insane fees and charging customers fees as well. And outsourcing customer support and "staff" positions to lowest bidder, pennies a day call centers in India and the Philippines.  So many people, apparently even after watching this, can't seem to wrap their head around the concept.   A majority of whom seem to be entirely missing the point just to keep parroting the same "we shouldn't depend on tips to pay employees" rhetoric. Which is true. But even more true is the fact that WE DO! Wishing that wasn't the system doesn't make you a good person, when you still UTILIZE the system but refuse to participate in the part where you pay the employee.  If you don't want to tip, then don't use services that rely on tips to subsidize their wages!
thanks for the article source on where you found leech testicles
I think the solution is tipping with cash.
The economy is fine, you can’t control adult babies spending $22 on a Big Mac
I've never used one of those apps, and I don't plan on it. Although I have ordered pizza online from nearby pizza joints, it's always been from the place itself.  But sometimes I *do* use my smartphone to call and order.   And I'm pretty sure they pay their delivery people more than what delivery-app companies pay.
Encouraging customers to tip more encourages employers to pay less. This isn't helping. It's the same as the plastics industry and recycling, where it shifts the blame for the problem from the company responsible onto the individual consumers.
I almost always just use the restaurant's own apps, as opposed to things like Uber Eats and Doordash
Another week, another americans living incorrectly video: 1. Stop ordering food. Cook using raw ingredients. Carrots, potatoes, meat, eggs, milk must exist in your kitchen. Most of the time you need to boil things in a pot and then put them together.  2. Stop tipping. You're throwing your money out the window for no reason. You're encouraging work models that do not function correctly - as evidenced by this piece on companies that obviously should fail. Yesterday. 3. Stop working at predatory companies in crowded cities. Move out of the coastlines and into the heartlands. Pick up essential hobbies your ancestors practiced and make a side living out of that: gardening, pruning, horticulture, carpentry, stone-masonry, masonry, tooling etc. 4. Stop consuming nonsense: too much entertainment, too much deserts, soda, too much alcohol etc.
Sorry, had to pause the video there for a second to grab my chick-fil-a breakfast from doordash, please continue
I relented and used one of those apps, i think insta to deliver to a friend.  Some soda and chocolates to ease a rough day as they got ready to vacate their home for construction. I tipped half the cost and since it was in app, i can only hope the actual human got 70% of thst tip i meant for them.  Im not saying these apps are Nazi's, but if the german war machine wasn't able to fund itself through slave labor, they could only wish to scrap off 30% to as much as 50% from every level of tge supply chain
As someone from Gen Z, looking at the situation most millennials are in feels like being the second victim in a horror movie. I just saw that happen, and capitalism is walking towards me down a long hallway.
I will say that that even though I saw this coming from a long time ago of 20 years ago, it still does not exclude the fact that whether you work for Papa John's or Postmates or etc. the company does not pay your insurance the company does not pay for your maintenance or company does not pay for your gas. I'm the only true way to make a decent living wage is to do at 6 to 7 days a week. Whether it's with a brick or mortar store or via the app. It's not sustainably viable. And now with the added risk of everyone robbing people and murdering people it's just not worth it. Your life is worth more than minimum wage
Haven't touched a food delivery app. Or a ride delivery app. Or a phone. Send help.
1 four star rating out of 500 can get you fired.. i dont think you understand the percentages.. its fucked up.. me personally if something asked me to give a rating i would give 3 stars because its not amazing its just whatever.. you delivered me food.. you didnt give me top and it wasnt the best top of my life but thats literally how these apps expect customers to rate you like you blew their minds by blowing their genitalia..
I'm so sick of hearing someone referring to a person's 2-5th jobs as "side hustles". If you need multiple "side hustles" to live they are JOBS.
I stopped using these services. The driver pool is too saturated now and the service has tanked, because of it. It got to a point where I wasn’t even getting the food anymore, because it was being picked up and never brought. That happened the last two times - never again. I won’t even order delivery from pizza places now that use 3rd party delivery, because it’s often the same result. It was such a rare, convenient treat, but nice when the service was better.  I tipped VERY well too. That’s what made me the angriest. That doesn’t get refunded when you still get the food, even if the driver disappears with it for two hours 🙃
Full-time Doordash Driver here! To keep my "Top Dasher" position (which means you can Dash anytime), at the end of every month I have to get my acceptance ratings up to be considered a "Top dasher". Which is extremely important if you want to make it a living. That means every last few days of every month I have to accept EVERY SINGLE ORDER. Which could be an order of 20 miles for $2.50. If I don't get it in time, I basically lose my job.
People who order delivery due to incliment weather deserve to be charge 2x as much at least. When i was a delivery driver for a freaky fast company. kansas city had a blizzard when the FAA decided they wanted a 10 order delivery for over $100. Could not drive faster than 5 to 10 mph ice skating my car the whole way there... then i got to stand ouside holding all this crap while a security guard is mad he has to open his window so he can figure out who to call to tell them their food is here.. then ice skate back to the store... all for no tip.
At first I thought you said "bad" Thai then I remembered Brits pronounce Pad with a long "a".
I wonder how much the companies that "aren't making money" pay their ceo
18:52 every GTA player knows by jumping off the bridge you can get there in half the time
why do i have to sympathise with worker and tip them?
I'm 34, but still refuse to order my food by phone.
Where can I find more information about how to start an orphanage?
I order directly from the restaurant. They ask us to. This just reconfirms it. I go pick it up if it’s close enough. I rarely ever use these apps anymore. But they served their purpose during Covid or times when you are shut in sick or cramps.
Just turned 30 Friday I get different jokes now lol
I started getting app food shoots in 2017. I started with GrubHub/Seemless. When the lock-down happened, it killed all of my other photography work, but the food shoots helped me keep the bills paid. That lasted for about a year. Postmates shoots dried up after their buyout. An interesting note, Kodak (or at least a company that rented the name) offered food photos for apps for a year. I'm not sure it was actually Kodak though. The name of the company was "Kodak-it" and it used the Koday logo. The office was in Asia though, and the person that recorded the "We're not in message" for the phone didn't know how to pronounce the name of the famous company. It was pronounced, "Koda-kit". They didn't last long and I never got a 1099 from them. The photo work, like the deliveries, was gig work. I got about $60 average for each shoot from the various third-party companies. Last year I gave up on the photography; it was getting better, but still unreliable after over 10 years. I got a job at Costco, and it's been great not having to worry about paying my bills. I had a great ending. Last December I got a food shoot out of the blue. I've done a thousand  food shoots and the owner was the prince of pricks. I'd never had to deal with such a hostile host before. Luckily, I didn't need his horrible attitude or the money ($120), so I left. That felt great.
Skype got bought by Microsoft.  That's what happened.
This is techno-feudalism. The tech companies are the feudal lords.  Everyone just pays tax to them.
This was a great piece, but really didn’t get into how bad of a gig this actually is for the drivers.  Many customers don’t tip, or worse tip bait by posting a big tip so that the drivers accept the delivery then once the order has been delivered they lower the tip so you do the job for an amount that you would not have been willing to. Most of the deliveries pay so low that they aren’t worth accepting. I’ve done delivery driving and it’s very hard to even make minimum wage  doing this type of work and you are still paying for your own gas and using your own vehicle. This is a job being done by the most vulnerable because it really is the worst type of work and usually the people who do it have no other option. You can tell people how important it is to tip, but still many don’t. If people actually did and the app paid more than $1-2 per delivery it would be worth it
So happy i never used food delivery apps!
I have a relatively new sushi place near me and the first time I used their website to order, they asked me which DD order I was collecting. DD had sold them the websites framework, and all of the to go orders were getting skimmed by those assholes. Immediately started just ordering in person to dodge DD's bullshit.
Thank you for covering this #subject #JohnOliver
5:10.... damn, I'm old
The devil always won in my eyes. Great take, John
It's funny I have HBO Max but it takes YouTube 4 days later to let me know that there's a new episode.
At 3:30 am this morn a dude parks in front of my house and wanders around. I'm thinking it's someone up to no good and yell at him to go away. twice he walks up my driveway- the second time to my front window  looking in my window. Again I yelled at him to go. He walked down the street then came back to his car without the bags he was carrying...he was a delivery driver....at threefrickenthirty in the morn!!! WTF?!
9:18 If you live in Michigan, you *have* to go to M Street Bakery Company. It's actually really good. I've been there a few times. This is not any sort of subtle marketing, it's just really good.
Food delivery? Like the international aid getting blown up by Isreal in Palestine?
I disagree with you here. you are putting the responsibility on the consumers. so we need to pay money for the delivery, we need to pay more for tips and the company can't pay living wages?😂😂😂😂 no. please stop using this apps if they don't pay 15/h
Is it me or are the sexual jokes feeling kinda distasteful these days? Nothing against the LGBT+ community but, Last week tonight new feels like some sort of LGBT conversion camp
Teams is a better product than Skype. Just sayin
the moral of this story is that these services dont cost enough and the customer is making off like a bandit? a 20 dollar order costs 45 dollars... because of fees.. if these apps made pennies per order their costs would be covered.. but youre telling us theyre charging restaurant 60% of their earnings and then saying its the customer whos getting away with something..
Hi, I have been homeless for 10 years and have worked more than 12k deliveries for doordash and nearly 2k for gopuff. Thanks for some visibility.
I was pretty sure they were a cancer on restaurants but I didn't think it was this bad. Thankfully I rarely need to use this service.
Got a bad review a few years ago saying it took me two hours to deliver the customers order despite having only been on the clock for ten minutes. Pretty lame of DoorDash to let you put an order in when there aren’t even any drivers around to make deliveries.
I'm glad I quit food delivery before all this
Any app that lets you spend money in 3 quick clicks is designed to bleed the middle and lower classes dry.  Also, Uber Eats slashed the base fare for deliveries basically in half after it got more popular during the pandemic.  The drivers always make less so the people running the company can make more.
Rideshare is no different all these companies are leaches.
Nobody let John see Uma Musume
Tip cash
14:50 wdym that is how schoolkids look around here
Its sad to hear that one solution presented by John Oliver is to always tip. Better solution would have been to make this tech companies drop the gig facade and instead treat their delivery drivers as regular employees with standard rate pay and benefits like leave, hmo, etc
Johns "what can we do" is respectfully a cop out. Just dont use them.  For generations parents stocked their fridge. There are charitable and govt agencies that offer help to the disabled. Many local business still do deliver.  This also paints these gig deliverers as martyrs and frankly that is the minority from all my exposure since COVID.  At grocery I struggle at times to get through the store or get what I need as they clog lines or barrel past lines of people to wave their phone at the deli clerk/etc. I have stopped going to some locations because they will clog a parking lot to wait for orders(and I saw a news article that some local Costcos have taken aggressive stance to clean their parking lot of gig employees who fill it waiting for orders in the area. I have seen them stand in spots to hold them for someone making a delivery.  And I know some will say its the abusive business practices to which I say find another job. And sorry, but some people are just assholes.
Who else bumping violins and fiddles on the way to work this morning
I get that he's based in NY, so it's probably more common to see Delivery Drivers riding bikes there, but in MOST of the country, Drivers are _literally_ Drivers, which is  arguably a totally different job compared to doing this by bike.  The _costs_ of driving to and from various restaurants because of how expensive gas is, and the rate at which delivery drivers have to pay for routine maintenance on their cars is something that I think most people don't understand very well, and is a HUGE part of why doing this as a job is unprofitable in most of the country.  When you add in some of the rules to the promotions they do for drivers it become a really miserable cycle of knowing how little the return is from doing the job but needing income ASAP and feeling like you have no choice. (guaranteed earnings of $___ if you deliver #__ of orders by the end of the day [*but if you accept a "batch" of more than 1 order, it only counts as 1 order in that promo])
Hallo from Germany! I lived on Maui for 40 years and my daughter worked at a charter > Whale watchers. Pretty much all people except the very, very rich like Oprah and many, many other of the 1% all the workers live on tips. Rent, food, everything is very, very expensive so those mostly younger folks work more then one job. So my daughter knows everything about tipping. American folks are kind of ok with tipping but German people are much worse. Because here in Germany people seldom tip while wages are high. I and everybody else need to tip good <> otherwise no Aloha. Please tip and get Aloha from the heart. Danke! Ps. love John Oliver, Jimmy Kimmel and most of Americans.
A bigger problem is the drivers tips are they’re based off the price of the items orders not based on distance/time it’s gonna take a worker to get the order to you.
I think the slice of cake delivery story sounds like a lady who knew her ex would definitely be delivering that cake, and it was the smallest order from anywhere she could make.  Revenge ordering is not acceptable in today's society.
Fuck tipping. I cant believe that john so vehemently promotes tipping. Pay the delivery guys a wage they can live from and everything is fine. no stressing how much you should tip, no dependency on the generosity of customers and its better for their pensions.
This all non sense. All these issues are completly wrong, at least in my country.  First not in the USA, so no, there is no tipping. Restaurants do increase the price products on the APP, makes sense, a delivery costs more so they charge more to make money, its fine. People cannot order outisde a certain range, delivery workers wont have these stupid distances. Evaluating a delivery has literally two separate indicaators, one for the restaurant which is the quality of the food and one for the delivery guy. The "human beings" behind it know exactly the type of work this is, dont try and make this into a full time job, because it isnt. Furthermore, as the video literally started, there is no alternative, these restaruants instead of having extra orders and extra money would have 0, because they cant employ a delivery service. So either evaluate if making less money on delivery is worth it. As for the clearly misshandling of restaurant being on the apps, thats a USA problem. Here we have non of that, restaurants on the app have an agreement period. I gotta say, these issues seem to be very USA focused. Dont see any of those happening here.
Oh look, the new episode of Sad Parrot Mans Funny Look into the Horrors of American Capitalism is online!
I have never used a delivery service, and I can't say I ever missed out on anything
Jim Cramer laughing is vile
Fun fact about uber they take 60 percent of the money you make
Strong disagree. Putting responsibility on the customer is the oldest trick in the book of corporate abuse. Tipping shouldn't be a thing at all. Workers should make a living out of their, you know, salary.
This is the 37th episode in a series,  ‘Capitalism is Exploitative’
It's impossible to cover food costs at 58% split.   S*** you're lucky if you get down to 20% food cost.   Capitalism at its finest
Labor advocates are seeking to abolish restaurant tipping, even at fast‐​casual restaurants such as Applebee’s, Olive Garden, and TGI Friday’s. Tipping is supposedly a repugnant practice because it dehumanizes servers who “must grovel for our change” to make their living. It also supposedly perpetuates poverty among servers, “enshrines” racial and gender discrimination, and encourages sexual harassment. Moreover, tipping does not improve customer service, or so the abolitionists say.
I gave up on delivery apps after it took 2 hours to get a refund after only getting half of my order.
13:07 lol Orphanage!
The laugh tracks make this unbearable
I don't use them. Poor people on their bicycles. Modern slavery.
Yeah i admit it, i used skype once, but then i found out it is an endless pit of security risks and there are just safer and better options out there.
Humans are despicable.
Many have done this by eliminating tips, as the non-tipping restaurants usually offer better wages and benefits. They also offer more consistent hours, an investment in employees' professional growth, and most importantly a workplace where cooks and servers are not pitted against each other due to their pay disparity.
I do this delivery for food as a way to avoid living paycheck to paycheck from my main full time job. It’s such a huge price for this.
It's so true. The devil did win that fiddle showdown.
Start an orphanage… WTF?! 🤯
Let's talk about the service fees. Buying a $20+ meal and WITH  annual membership,  service fees tack on an additional 50% of total cost.
Would like to point out that the Charlie Daniels Band only had one fiddle player. He played both parts.
Way to give the DEVIL HIS DUE, Johnny! It's about damn time!!
Literally never used any of these apps. I cook at home mostly or go to the restaurant myself.
I started doing doordash in Feb 2024. Luckily, my car was paid off, and it is pretty much a beater. Also, my town is kind of small, but when it gets busy after 4:30pm, i can make close to $70 in like 3 hours. That is not bad, really. I'll also drive like 70 miles in a work day as well. I'm not too worried about putting that on my civic.  The annoying thing is when I have to cross the bridge into Harrisburg, and after a certain time, most people don't tip. That gets annoying and frustrating. As well as that, if I get multiple orders, I cannot choose who gets dropped off first. A (lazy) customer had to wait a while for his food because I had to drop off an oder first and by the time it came to drop off the lazy guy's food, it was cold. But he was also like a 3 min drive from the restaurant and had 2 cars, probably 3 other people that could drive, and showed attitude when the food was cold. Lazy mofo, get it yourself.
To be honest, I still don't get the point of tipping for delivery for any of these apps. I am already paying higher prices for the food and delivery + miscellaneous charges. It doesn't make sense for me to tip 15-25% like I would if I was being served at a restaurant.  It's about time corporations realize that they need to pay their workers fairly, because the consumers end up carrying the burden for the most part
So in many places outside of USA tipping is not considered so important cause its actually the employer who should pay the employer a decent salary and not the costumer's choice. Food for thought🤔
As horrible as these companies are remember. People do them voluntarily. Target, Walmart and McDonalds have all starting pay of $20 an hour and they give you $4000 a year towards education. So stop acting like you can’t work anywhere else.
Never used these stupid apps and never will.
Something that wasn't touched in this segment was just how low quality some of the drivers are for these companies. Some people just do not read delivery instructions and other people bring your food to a completely wrong building. So negative reviews for some of these shitty drivers is absolutely necessary.
I get treated well as a driver 99% of the time. I do it weekends and at nights and it's paying off my house 10 yrs early. If people are willing to pay for it and it's possible, it will be around.
“You can’t spell millennial without three massive L’s…”.   As an elder millennial, I couldn’t agree more
It's really scary that they can spend $184 million on campaigning on ballots when they are also losing so much money at the same time
I hate using these things lol for selfish reasons. Sometimes it’s cheaper and faster for me to just take the train (nyc) to the place and eat there
But what about the restaurant, should consumers tip them as well   The message is tip the drivers  , so app owners don’t have to pay them salaries and keep more money.
And they pay taxes on those tips👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
My dislike regarding these apps stems from my employer giving us gift cards for them, assuming everyone uses food delivery apps. I live in a small town, so I don't use the apps....EVER. Most of my coworkers live in larger towns or cities, so I figure in most cases my coworkers like this, but I've ended up giving away my gift cards to charity. So much for getting a bonus from work...
I've tried the food apps a few times due to surgery recovery or illness, but it's not something I'd care to do otherwise since it's pretty expensive. I'll stick to places that do their own delivery, or I'll do takeout. Also, I don't order delivery when the weather is bad. I don't want to drive in that weather, but why should I make someone else drive in it? Especially since many times the person delivering doesn't always have a vehicle made for driving in the snow, ice, etc. Me wanting pizza isn't an emergency.
thats why i often TIP IN CASH!!!! lol
Unpopular opinion from someone who’s worked in bars and restaurants for the last 25 years, including during the pandemic: delivery apps are THE WORST. In Texas, I made $2.13/hr, all the rest of my income was tips. Instead of being able to focus on the 30-100s of people who came in to see me that paid my bills, I constantly had to shut up an iPad with a (probably) really cheap order, leave the bar and go to the kitchen and make sure someone got it and started cooking, time it out in my head, go back and pack it up with utensils, napkins, and condiments, then bring it out front where someone who always acted like they’ve never been inside a restaurant would eventually come in, push their way through my guests, holler out a random name, stand in the service well or try to walk in the kitchen, and all of that was free labor on my part. To each their own, but with my personal experience, neither I nor anyone in my family, will ever ever patronize a delivery app. Period. Yes, it’s money for the restaurant, but if someone puts on pants and comes to visit us, they should be the focus and I can introduce them to great service and other products.
Honestly if the restaurants charged the prices they get after the delivery apps milked them dry then most customers would prefer to be seated at the restaurant themselves instead of turning themselves into the cash cows for the delivery people
I’ve never used these apps and I will never ever use one.  I like cooking at home anyway.
okay so... I may have sent a single slice of cake to a friend in the middle of a large storm but to be completely fair here, it was her birthday and even her parents didn't care enough to celebrate it, she was alone and too poor to get herself anything, and she needed to know someone cared. I also manually typed in a custom tip for the delivery person that was like 2x the price of the order, which was not a small amount since it was from a fancy bakery
I really must be an anomaly, I don't see the ads, I don't use the apps, and I still use skype to talk to my brother.
ok so why i should bare out of hand tipping .. they just have to stop delivering .. just go to some farm do hard labor.. so Mexicans dont have to leave mexico .. and everyone will be happy
Never used any of those apps because they are just parasites. Though I do not order food anyway and on the very rare occasions (like once a year tops) where I order, I just call directly and get it myself so that I don't give money to those parasites.
At 37, I have never used any food app. Not for ordering or delivery.
Why don't the videos come out on Monday anymore?
always try to get menues from your favorite restaurants, most of them very gladly will offer you delivery or takeout without the middle man, you wont get charged the insane delivery fees or mark ups the restaurants have to do to be abled to pay the apps for their services and the tipps and money goes 100% to the place you want.
Its better to just stop using these apps. Especially now that you end up paying way more than what the actual good would cost.  And i disagree about delivery people losing their jobs if this didn't exist. Restaurants will still need people to deliver and when its not busy they can also pick up new skills in the kitchen or hospitality, instead of wandering the streets aimlessly until someone orders a piece of cake.
Tip baiting is a thing too
How about a video on why tipping culture is bad and restaurants and delivery companies need to start paying real wages over there?  GrubHub, Mcdonalds and every other chain that's also in the netherlands is running just fine without tipping culture, why does your country accept that kind of treatment?
0
I was working myself at one of these companies in its beginnings in Austria- 2015-2017 and I just refused to work during a snowstorm; about which they weren't happy at all. After complaining in the workers chatt and saying that we should demand bad wheather bonuses, like they did in some other countries they just made fun of me for not being brave enough or something and bragging about their dangerous  rides  (those idiots) That was the moment I decided to just quit and do something else, but I always make sure to tip them well and order as little as possible
Being so lazy that you pay someone to go get your food is not supposed to be for normal people. So yea the business model as it stands is not sustainable
As a restaurant owner, I’m glad you ran this story. I will say that, as much as I despise these services, it’s still better than Groupon.
JO is back yall!! 😈
Side note- John is right about the Devil being the better fiddle player! 😂
Two things I'm proud of myself for: 1. Never smoked a cogarette. 2. Never used a food delivery app.
As a franchise food delivery driver, I find the Ubereats deal is screwing us over. I'm still required to deliver the Ubereats orders, but Ubereats keeps the profit.
Food delivery apps are definitely gambling. You got go pay more for you food to have a random person who has no affiliation with the restaurant to deliver your food who you also have to pay extra so you don’t risk your food sitting there
There’s no profit in restaurant food.    The profit comes from the liquor sales.
I comment to video!
Not codoning this at all, but some of these delivery apps have work arounds for people who don't have car insurance. I know people who deliver for these companies who work full-time jobs and still have to resort to driving, with no car insurance, because they genuinely can't afford it. Hell, I know homeless people who drive for absurd hours, only to use what little they're paid to stay in weekly rate motels.
Well, we weren't ready for social media in this country, that has just about ruined us, and apparently we aren't ready for capitalism either. We are just too greedy and uncaring. I'm glad I'm old. Good luck to the rest of you.
Or as they say in German: "Wenn Sushi an der Türe läutet werden Menschen ausgebeutet." They even made a song about it: https://youtu.be/pQsS0VqM4aA?si=bw6lXoNvWnhD-Lfp
Late stage capitalism is Colonialism come home. You are quietly benefitting from the brown person in the global south. AND your neighbor.   Watch as low-GDP republican voters continue to vote for their chains. "Deregulate your corpo proffits harder, daddy." Perverts.
I've never once used Grubhub, doordash, or undereats. If the place is fifteen minutes away, I'll go get it. If not, I'm sure I got some food in the house that'll do.
I always think "how many DUIs do you have to get before you're gonna spend $20 on a bottle of Mt dew and some Doritos?"
Thank god it's Monday!! Cheers from Europe... and don't forget to vote blue💙💙
Grubhub is garbage never order from them food always cold and way too expensive
I live in the middle of nowhere and can’t even get delivery from Domino’s so I’m certainly not able to use these apps 🥸… I’m also way too poor to pay for food out and I make all my own food. This whole thing is insane. There’s no balance.
saddest order?  people order sex toys and lube on these apps...
For context, Truth Social is also worth billions of dollars, apparently. These delivery apps have NEVER made any sense to me.  The entire model is illogical and too costly to the consumer.  The thing I just don't understand is why there has to be any involvement with the restaurants' profits to get their food delivered.  If these companies would just charge a moderate fee to the consumer, according to a percentage of the order cost, and suggest a reasonable tip, consumer's and restaurants would use them far more often.  But, as it is, I don't need a $25 McDonald's burger to arrive in 30 minutes, cold, and pot-scented, with a 40 year-old unemployed IT nerd expecting a $20 tip.
AS an european, i really can't get around the "You have to tip" mentality. They are doing their job, and the company they are doing it for should pay them, not me. I can tip if they do an exceptional good job, not in any other case
Could USA adopt an government interface like ONDC?
As you in the US handle tipping, it's the end of appropriate wages...
Just drive to restaurant down the road. 5 minutes of your life and you'll save tons of money.
This is Uncle Scam's America! Everyone screwing everyone until the whole thing collapses.
I am too cheap to use delivery apps.  Hell I don't even get pizza delivered, I go pick it up since they have the fee the restaurant charges then the tip which adds a ton on and instead I can drive a few minutes down the road and pick it up myself.  I do feel bad for the disabled that use them because they don't have a lot of choice when they can't go get food themselves.
As a door dash driver, you do not get to see an itemized receipt so you cannot see what they tipped. You only get an "offer" from the app for how much they want to give you for taking the order. No way of knowing what the actual tip was!
how do these companies not make money? they dont DO ANYTHING but maintain a server. they have almost no costs, they could collect on a dozen orders and pay the server costs for the month what the fuck are they doing with all that money?
I used them a few times before Covid and was just appalled by the fees and added costs, but it really shocked me that the driver was picking up and delivering multiple orders from multiple restaurants at the same time, driving all over the place with the first pickup sitting on the car seat all that time. What a total rip-off of the restaurant, the driver, and the food-ordering customer.
Oh boy! Another episode of "this entire sector of business is greedy" with John Oliver!
Am I high, or did we not just watch this episode four days ago?
Get back to uploading this fucking shit on Mondays before I start downloading the entire show. Fuck HBO
I used to make so much money delivering I’ve delivered since 16, I worked open to close everyday at family restaurants I was making 7500 a month. The Pandemic happened it was  so awkward watching these other drivers walk in snatch the order up it, then when there were issues it was so complicated trying to fix the issue going through two other ppl instead of directly to the customer. It was a nightmare.
awww, we got teased by the full episode the other day. Then HBO took it down.
Jon “if there’s semen in your food - you still need to give 4 or 5 stars” Oliver everyone.
real ones will remember how they accidentally posted the full video a few days ago
I just love how Jim Kramer is absolutely not a psychopath. Nope. Totally normal dude and not a functioning psychopath.
Never used a delivery app, never will
So many comments saying "why did you say we must tip at the end? the companies should be paying a living wage instead of you tipping right now". Yes, that's the point. Companies are not magically going to start paying a living wage just because you don't tip. Please tell me how I, an individual acting alone, can singlehandedly force companies to do that. Ending capitalism is going to take the combined effort of hundreds of millions of angry people demanding a better world, and barring that, the least we can do in the meantime is make life slightly better for the oppressed, and if that means tipping, then so be it. Yes, I am aware of employers stealing tips; that does not invalidate the point. Tip the workers directly "under the table" if you have to.  I remember when Grubhub did their stupid Twitter campaign in NYC of a fixed price for lunch one day. The local news adamantly refused to cover it (hmmmm 🤔) and people forgot about it the next day, but I sure didn't. Grubhub went out of their way to hide the posts of people on Twitter who told them about the sweatshop conditions this created (this was a thing you could do on Twitter to replies to your tweets before Elon happened). If my 60+-year-old father had run a restaurant in NYC on that day then I'm convinced he would be dead right now; fortunately (in this case) our restaurant is elsewhere.  So I do say we should outlaw these apps outright and force restaurants back into the 2003 model. Will this hurt the current crop of gig workers? Maybe. But it will at least be slightly more just; I genuinely do not think we can reform this. Still disgusted at the thought.
That thank God the food is here guy   Needs to be a meme
I did grubhub for a year for grad school and then I was let go for some sort of ticket out of nowhere. Then I did Doordash. My rates went from about $20-25/hr to about $15/hour. Its fine as a side hustle but as a main job, it's terrible bc no one tips because of 1) personal reasons 2) the tips are so high 3)doordash doesnt explain how dashers get paid and how tips are about 50% of the money we get in a day
I support food delivery workers, by putting on pants and getting my own food.
Did delivery in the Bay Area, San Francicans, do not tip but are some of the most entitled people in the country. $2 delivery, no tips and you can do 3 deliveries/hour, so $6/hr in 2024. But, "people don't want to work anymore."
My head canon for Devil Went Down to Georgia has always been that the Devil lets Johnny win because he knows a thing or two about the sin of Pride…he gets his soul eventually 😏
cook your own damn food. eat ate home.
Props to In n Out for never giving a fuck and staying off these apps and still ROCKING business here in California.
Delivery drivers for restaurants almost all get paid off the books too
If GrubHub lists a business on their app without permission, and then goes further by listing them as “closed” when they’re open or “not accepting online orders” even if they do; it would seem those businesses could sue GrubHub for damages.
John, ma love! Make an episode on DACA! I love you!
No no no no no. Ask any professional fiddler and they'll tell you Johnny won. The techniques the devil uses are flashy, sure, but anyone picking up a fiddle for the first time can do them. Johnny might not play anything new, but it requires skill and practice. Besides, bringing a band to a fiddle off is an auto DQ
An Uber Eats driver once delivered my food to a house down the block. I messaged an agent to get my money back, and rescind the tip I gave. Then I just went and got the food off a strangers porch anyways. Win win.
I have tried delivery apps maybe 3 times and no. They messed up or took forever or forgot things every time.   We do pick up or eat at home
Jajajajajajajajajajajajajjajajajajjaja Jajajajajajajajjajajajajajajajjajaaj visible  semen Jajajajajajajajajjajajajaja not just a glaze Jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
In Ireland I’ve used a company called Just Eat to order for collection, and their logo looks suspiciously like GrubHub’s. I wondered whether GrubHub had bought Just Eat, but the opposite is true: Just Eat (a Dutch company) bought GrubHub for $7.3 billion in 2020. So they aren’t even American-owned.
I’ve been on both sides of this. I was working Uber, Uber eats, and Instacart for a while when I was having trouble making money. I really liked it. I now work at a job making a living wage and I use these apps but I ALWAYS tip!
I stopped getting food delivered the very moment they added delivery fees. What a scam
I paid my way through school working UberEats, DoorDash, GrubHub, and Postmates. The restaurant workers were dicks sometimes but otherwise I’d still do it in my spare time if it paid better.
This has start me questioning. Are beauty standards more strict for bottoms or where does that idea come from?
Prepare your food at home! Problem solved.
As soon as I see new content from the Last Week team I start screaming with joy.
Said it before, “Independent contractors,” the two worst words the US gave the world. You’re welcome. 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
I can’t believe how many people use these apps. You end up paying double the price for the same food than if you go get it yourself. The prices are all higher on the menus on delivery apps than they are on the website of the actual restaurant (usually by close to 20%), then they charge a fee and you have to tip the driver. You can get a chipotle burrito for $11, or you can get it delivered for $25. And we’re in the era where these companies are losing money. Imagine what it’ll be like when they’re ready to turn on the profitability switch. There’s no way that any of these companies can survive.
As a customer, I have to say "I'll do what I can to get my food done right, and that is review accordingly. I'll give them a 1 star if they deserve a 1 star. I don't have a relationship with these companies, with these delivery drivers or these restaurants"
My annoyance with all of this is now you need an app for each fast food place to get their deals. I was fine having one email address for every rewards club, now you have 10+ apps instead.
This is a thing that completely passed me by.  I'm too fuckin' broke to pay someone to get food for me when I can barely afford to get that food for myself.
They used to say the robots would take our jobs... wrong-they skipped all that and just made the robots the boss. I used to drive for door dash and then one day I just quit lmao. Now instacart got all the heroin junkies shopping your orders... go to your local grocery store and tell me "no they aren't"... "yeah man" (scratches neck) "I'll shop 45 items and drive 12 miles for $7.50."
millennials not being able to afford a house is a meme. millennial rate of home ownership is about the same as previous generations and zoomers are actually buying houses at a higher rate than older generations. not sure why people on the left constantly propagate this disinformation
21:18  I want to know more about these significant caveats
Skype was essentially renamed to Teams, which has 25% of the videoconferencing market...
They are not "losing money" they are choosing not to have profit, because then they have to pay income taxes. This is the essence of capitalism - reinvest capital into growth, expansion, R&D, etc. They absolute can make a profit, they just choose to beef up their equity and stock value.
I deliver for Door Dash Grub Hub and Uber. Its crazy how little people will tip and how far they will ask you to drive for so little. I get offers for 5.00 bucks to drive 15 miles all the time. I dont expect much though from people from tips though. 3-5 I think is fair for a tip if its close but I can tell you the worst tippers are those who live in the most expensive houses. They tip the least while those who live in middle to lower class houses or apartments tip the most.
Never have never will. I credibly wasteful for the paycheck to paycheck American dream
An Orphanage for a side hustle  ?      Thats an Asian for you.
"You gotta tip" is just such an american problem. Never seen this in any other country  I was in except there. The problem really lies in the poor system of way to little wage for the workers and the poor conditions.
screw these a-hole drivers that park in everyone’s way, don’t understand what emergency flashers are for and then rudely enter the restaurant and loudly announce that they have arrived. you’re fired
Gig workers-   check your insurance and car warranty terms. A lot of companies won’t cover you when you use your car for gig work.   Love, your friendly local gap claim adjuster
The tech industry is the epitome of end stage capitalism. Every single company makes every industry worse while advertising itself as a solution for problems that they often create themselves.   Then they use their tremendous wealth to control legislation so that they become intricately stuck in our society and to remove them would kneecap our economy.   How long are we going to accept this state of affairs?
Ok so here me out. Yes, the Devil's Demon Band is Jammin, BUT if you listen to just the fiddle part, you will see that there is much more skill in Johnny's fiddle-playing hands than the devil's. And since it is a competition on who can play the fiddle better (I'll put a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you) Johnny won it.
I just want too say that I work for a delivery company here in the Netherlands, ThuisBezorg, and we get treated way better!!! We get paid a salary as well as tips . We get to set our own hours. The company provides E-bikes for us if we choose or if we have our own E-bikes we are free too use that as well we have an absolutely terrific support staff that is ready too help with anything at anytime. TBH I love my job here and I would not be doing this job if I was living back in the states.
As someone who cooks at home, doesn't order food and hasn't eaten at a restaurant in a few years... This story isn't for me. I'm a teacher and I can't find it in my budget to increase food costs to include going to a restaurant and ordering food, leeeeeeeet alone paying extra to have it delivered and tipping on top of that.   I'd rather have a "go to bed" for dinner instead. Before that, I have a rice cooker with the rice, water and electricity for it plus a can of tuna, I'll make a meal out of that. Tuna costs about a dollar and a half (sigh... it was cheaper ya know) and rice is around a dollar a pound (was also cheaper) and I paid my bills so I got water and electricity to use my rice cooker that I got as a moving out gift ages ago. Not fancy and kinda sucks... but it'll do.
the prices on doordash are ridiculous. i went to order a subway chicken, bacon & ranch 12" sub with a 6.50 tip and it came up to $36 bucks. that was enough to make me get TF up and jump in the car smdh
There are human suffering costs in food delivery apps, amazon and warehouse delivery, and pretty much everything. Capitalism is going great. We are fine here in America. The house is burning. But everything is fine. Things are working as designed.
“Starting an orphanage.”
We don't have "Grub Hub" here in Germany, instead we have "Lieferando". Interestingly with the exact same logo.
I am not going to lie, I am one of those who started using delivery apps, namely Uber Eats, after the pandemic started. Now, I would like to say that I am far from one of those horror stories you might hear about, but go ahead and say that this explanation of mine is nothing more than an excuse - that is certainly fair.  To start, I had emigrated from the US literally days before the country I went to first closed their borders before the first wave; I had no way of knowing that this would be the case. Before this, I lived in a semi-rural part of Texas, a place where delivery apps - or just delivery outside of mail or packages - simply do not work. When I emigrated, I ended up in a comparatively more urban place, where these apps are more likely to work.  As for where I emigrated to, it really makes the US look like a third-world sweatshop country (not that it ever looked like anything but such, especially not since the Reagan administration - again, used to live in semi-rural Texas). It may still be far from perfect, but there actually are worker protections here, even for gig workers. Are gig workers still exploited? Yes, they are, and that sucks. Is it as bad as in the US? No, and that does not excuse what exploitation there is. Even so, along with those protections, there are actual social services - i.e. low-cost high-quality healthcare, expanding free and/or municipal broadband, well-paved roads, extensive public transportation, etc. - so the burdens are not as bad for the workers (again, still harder than most, and that needs to be corrected). When you have _any_ actual protection as a worker by a government, you'd be amazed just how much f^^^ing better everything ends up looking and being.  As for myself, I have several points that I adhere to. Granted, since I moved, I have found myself in the unexpected position of being able to do this, which can be considered a luxury, but the fact that being in a position to be able to care for anyone's well-being other than your own is a luxury is f^^^ing bullsh^t, but I digress. I am simply beyond fed up that everything is built around, "Get yours and yours alone, and f^^^ whoever helped you get it."  Anyway, the first thing I do is check if the restaurant in question has their own delivery service. This does limit it to just the chains (and not just the international ones), but anything that goes to fully employed workers is preferred.  The second thing I do is verify that any restaurant listed actually does operate with the app(s). This is arguably the most difficult, given that the best way to do that is to go to the restaurant in question, because thankfully, if they do indeed operate with the app(s) in question, they show it with decently sized signage spelling out "Delivered by [insert app here]." As mentioned, it can be quite difficult to go to the place yourself, especially if you do not have your own car, but with a good public transportation network, as well as actual free time for anything, it is more than possible.  Third, though this is hardly exclusive to delivery, I try to keep my orders simple. Not only does it make it easier for the restaurant in question, it also means less the delivery has to go through. Restaurants and just workers in general go through enough crap as it is with their work, so the least I can do is not add anything beyond what is unavoidable.  Fourth, I am _very_ selective about when I order, particularly when it comes to weather. I know I would absolutely hate to deliever in bad weather, so I am not going to force someone else to do it for me. Yeah, I know, having empathy for some stranger paints a target on my @$$ for a conservative to aim their "symbol of freedom" at, but thankfully, the country I live in now does not have guns f^^^ing everywhere, so I am safe on that front.  Fifth, I do not use the tip feature of the app(s), and instead, I tip the person directly. Sure, it means keeping cash on hand, but it ensures that 100% of the tip goes to them. Yes, there have been a few times where I had to explain that I am from the US and therefore do not trust the app(s) to actually give the tip to them, but they have yet to refuse my action.  Sixth, and this one ties back to the fifth point, if they do end up delivering in bad weather, guess what: they get an even bigger tip. Again, if I do not want to deliver in bad weather, they should not have to for me, but if bad weather ends up striking after the order is placed (where I live, weather predictions are not that reliable, so it can happen, even after regular checks before ordering), they deserve a better payout for having to go through with it.  Is this all a luxury for me? Yes. Would I be able to any of this if I were back in the US? Absolutely not, and it is not for a lack of wanting to at all. Do I trust any of these apps to look out for people? No, abso-f^^^ing-lutely f^^^ing no, they would rather kick off WW3 than give any worker even the tiniest measure of protection or support. Am I part of the problem for using any of these apps? Yeah, I am, and even if I am far from the worst problem, I am still part of it. Am I doing what I can to try to ease, if not end, this problem? Yes. Is it easy to do? F^^^ no, and that is why it needs to be done, and the more people who are like me, even if they do not take the same approach or to the same extent that I do, the better.
I ordered food in NYC for the first time this month and was confused that I didn't see the tip option before check out or anytime during the process. Luckily I asked a friend that lives here and she told me you have to go back and do it after the food is delivered. That's crazy because some people don't go back to the app for days.
So we now believe big companies when they say that they are not making money?
Literally every app in India has two ratings, one for product and one for delivery person and pretty much everyone gives 5 stars to the delivery guy even if they don't rate the food or rate it shitty separately... it's that easy!! Americans are just stupid when it comes to solving problem coz they don't do it properly...
I had a thought a few days ago that food delivery reduces the carbon footprint because there is less mileage overall by delivering to several places, rather than people at home driving somewhere, getting some food, and driving back home. I wasn't aware that the economics behind them were so complex and cutthroat.
Seen this before. Upload new videos not clips of older ones please.
I live in an area with higher than average illiteracy and I'm pretty sure food delivery is the job people who struggle with illiteracy take because they can't get anything else... needless to say it's much less hassle to just get it yourself around here. (Nothing against them it's not their fault. Glad they can have a job. But if you want the actual thing you ordered, delivered to the right address, these services are useless.)
capitalism at its finest. outsourcing sounds like a good idea in many cases and could be profitable for everyone until you make a business and shares get to people investing in you cutting out the competitors...
Small businesses are the backbone of the American Economy. Lol
Ayyy.. my fav Johnny  boy
This is why I tip on the app and also have an extra cash tip for the driver.  I work in a liquor store. We have new owners who AGGRESSIVELY started pushing DoorDash. The drivers are always so stressed out that I want to tip them while I'm handing them the package. Also, we make no money on delivery.
Finally, how long have I waited 😅
I stopped using these apps because they make a $12 meal cost me $20 not including tip. You can tell me “I’m getting a deal” but that doesn’t make it true
Tipping is a stupid concept that the corporations use as an excuse to keep minimum wage low.
I don't understand if you don't pay your "employees" how the company doesn't make money.
Idfw food delivery apps...     Or Amazon. Or Starbucks.
It’s NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY to participate in capitalism.   I’ve always tipped appropriately,   But with the bitching coming from wait staff I’m gonna say your a lousy WORKER If your not receiving the amount of tips your expecting.   I was a waiter for a few years,  70’s I never went home with less than $100 cash in my pocket.   I didn’t have to share MY WAGES with anyone else.
Gosh my life made John Oliver ...
"you cant spell miLLeniaL without three massive Ls" I felt that
I got to watch this last week, when you accidentally posted it 😂
Tip directly in cash, not via the app!
As a chef, gonna love this episode lol
Everyone - Stop Tipping. Everywhere.
I spent a couple months working DD full time as a dasher and Door Dash itself is probably the worst thing about DD. They give you the impression that you're your own boss but it's robot will scrutinize your work, the app's built in GPS is pretty terrible often instructing you to make turns out before you approach a turn, and don't expect to make any real money off this. You get a base pay and whatever in tips which is usually under $6, and that's assuming the customer actually tips.
Always research if a restaurant offers delivery. It will save you time and money.
Aw come on! I was watching the full version a few days ago when it got deleted.. now i have to watch the cut version
I feel like the Skype section was inspired by the CollegeHumor video.
JO is crazy af 😂😂😂😂😂😂...but I love this show though.
Tipping should be banned, this will solve 70% of problems. Then delivery workers and employers will know exactly how much to spend. While tipping like nice from outside, in actual it's not a good feeling when somebody is expecting more tips than usual tips both from customer point of view as well as service provider.
Ahh, the classic orphanage side hustle.
I'm sorry but food delivery of any kind should not be a thing in an obese society.
That dude who bought the bike is lying about cost. You can get those electric bikes for 500 dollars with everything on it.
I have a show idea for you and I’m sure I’m not the only one, but I need you and your crack investigative team to find out for me is how the ex-president I don’t even have to say his name you know who I mean made his own website or web platform Put $4 million into it OK bye then reported $58.1 million and losses. No I’ve had some advanced math but obviously not enough to figure this one out so I leave it in your Abel hands Mr. Oliver to find out how I can invest $4 million and something and then take a $58.1 billion loss. Sorry that should be million with M. do the guys who work for the ex-president need the food delivery applications to make enough money to survive? Looking forward to your answer.
My previous job got listed on doordash without permission and it was very frustrating as the prices and items listed were not accurate at all.  Always felt bad for the delivery people as theyd have to then contact the customers letting them know which opened them up to more verbal abuse and possiblly a refusal to tip for something that wasnt their fault, all because the morons who run the app refused to take my bosses "no" for an answer.
I apologize to any delivery people,  but I, for one, stopped using delivery apps long ago when I heard from one of my favorite restaurants how poorly they were being treated! It nearly put them out of business, and they are a mom and pop operation. I stopped using ride share apps as well and just pay for my friends' gas instead to get where I need to be!
My first experience with a delivery app was so terrible I never used them again. My food took 45 minutes to show up cold (from 10 minutes away), and I found out afterwards my driver drove almost an hour into my town. Why offer the service if there aren't any local drivers to deliver? We never used them again
I don't even order pizza when it's raining and I always tip well.
Finally a news piece about these apps that recgoize that the consumers are getting an unreaslisic good deal, at least for now. So many pieces make it sound as if every party other than the companies loses when that is not actually true (the revenue is not equal to profit bit also applies to the delivery platforms). It is important to correctly identify the problem if we were to hope to address them. They are playing the long con for monopoly, not an immediate predatory squeeze on all parties.  I always tip based on distance and road condition (including weather and time of day). I have tipped $20 for a single pizza before, but I've also tipped $3 for a high cost steak dinner(it's walking distance but I was suffering from something, can't remember what). Percentage tip, which is the default recommandation, simply doesn't make sense to me for delivery. There is also the added benefit of this causing me to find out what the distance is, which have actually lead to discovery of nearby places that I can easily go to myself. Apprentally some delivery app actually have a cap on tip, like 50% or something, so I had to add more in cash. Found that out when I ordered some ice, which is low value but high weight.
I very rarely use order apps, and when I do, I am reminded why I don't. Last time I did, my driver sat like 10 miles away supposedly on a bike and did not move for like 45 minutes. It took nearly 2 hours for me to get my food. They got a 1 star rating.
Is anyone feeling guilty about tmnt cheating the delivery guy for being 10 seconds late to deliver to the sewer?
Using these apps is the most bougie shit imaginable and you're a bad person for doing so
Interesting..🤔   Can you do a segment on divorce court?
Surprised he didn't even get to the ghost kitchen issue
12:54 laugh track here? really?
I delivered for UberEats for a week … half of the deliveries did not tip and one I didn’t even get the base amount for with no explanation.  Wasn’t worth it.
Missed you Toucan!
Only time I use Doordash is when I'm in Houston, I do not want to drive in Houston.
Facts..
As a part time delivery driver, I have noticed some reckless drivers out here that tailgate, speed, cut people off, run red lights etc. I also found out that these app companies pick restaurants further away to get a higher fee from the customer for distance. Many times I will pass 4 Starbucks that are closer to the customer to deliver a damn cup of Joe! This is bad for climate change and traffic safety. Also, I have seen 15 mile deliveries that pay $2.50. You are threatened to take these deliveries if you want better orders but it doesn’t happen. These companies need to be stopped immediately and replaced with local drivers with smaller areas.
For me a person delivering food to my doorstep isn't worth even a cent... Cooking relaxes so doing it while having children is not a big deal. Bringing your own food to work is better. Taking some time off during work to eat food at a restaurant is better if you're into such things. Taking a walk to the store and back while eating on the way during work gets your creative juices flowing again. So all in all it's beyond me why somebody would be willing to pay for food delivery to the point where it'd be a profitable business model.
To be fair Diddy knows alot about trafficking
"tip these delivery so the billionaires can abuse them longer" no thanks
When he said "starting an orphanage", I literally dropped my vape.
I’m prob the only one on here who’s never used one of these apps.
Great job! The only thing I wish you would have mentioned is customer theft. There are people who order with no intention of paying for food. They have food delivered to a different address or apartment under a fake account.
wait so theyre charging people who get the food exorbitant sums and also charging the restaurant 60 percent of the order in fees? ok so i guess whoever designs an app thats automated and they do nothing every transaction deserves literally all the money over people who own buildings, buy make and sell food and then people who own cars and deliver it.. no sure people who sit around on bean bag chairs should make 75% of the money..
I remember how it was like being a pizza delivery guy back in the days, mainly from pornos
There is no ethical consumerism in capitalism
Amazing how all the "feel good stories" in US media are just apocalyptically horrifying stories about that fucking capitalist hellscape.
No, you don't have to tip. It is the company's responsibility to pay living wages, not us.
Am sorry John, but i don't get to be judged for not tipping because it's not obligatory. What if i'm struggling myself or have things to do with my money? This responsibility solely falls on the businesses. I hate it when people shame others for not tipping like they (already paying for their food and all these costs) have to be responsible for the worker and it's exactly because of this that has made me tip now less and less. At some point we forgot it was voluntary and made it an entitlement.
Whoa ...those stocks are going to crash hard. 😮
I watch every single episode. This has to be one of the best super good.
Regulate and unionize! That’s the only good way forward.
Oh my gosh. That’s so funny that he mentioned the devils fiddling was better, because I always have said that!
The running joke of John Oliver being REALLY into horses never gets old.
Nice try, but I already watched the full episode you uploaded on Sunday which I assume has been taken down by now 😂
Whoa, now hold the fuck up. Johnny playing old folk songs is him showing his mastery not just of the fiddle as an instrument, but as a cultural icon. The devil only plays a simple double stop with a slide. The band is doing the actual work in his piece. Also, those old folk songs are way harder to play.
I control people's life with a press of a button? It's very rare I actually feel better about myself after watching an episode!
Repost ?
Im not buying the whole "the customer is the winner here." I've used door dash exactly twice. the first time was taco bell, I ordered the usual meals I get for me and my wife, which at the actual store cost around $20. after all the door dash fees it was $37 before tip. so after tip it's more than 100% markup. the other time was during the pandemic, I got mcdonalds for me and my kids. the happy meal for my (at the time) 6 year old was missing from the order. I complained to door dash but since I did it 20 minutes after the food arrived instead of immediately, they refused to refund or do anything else.
Raw dogging the air😂
I get the argument against the apps taking a cut of the cost of the food itself from the restaurants. However I can't empathize with people choosing to do it as a full time job. The app is clearly designed to be a gig job. Something that you do when you have free time for a few bucks. If it's not a sustainable way to make a living just get a job that does.
John, you're wrong about the Devil. His solo is amateurish, it shows no knowledge of fiddle music history or artistry, it lacks technical prowess and while it may seem showy to an uneducated audience, Johnny is 1000% the better fiddler.
Not saying that this LGBT has gone completely insane is just weak!
Who else can’t afford this option. Quality has gone down and prices way up. Learn to cook. There is literally no downside.
DoorDash has this weird medical payment claims service admistered by Blue Star Claims. It sounds like an attempt to avoid workers comp or health insurance. And look up subrogation if you’re bored.
I was at a friend's house for a few days during a holiday a few years back and we used GrubHub twice. I paid for one nite and my friend paid for one. GrubHub opened an account with my card and started monthly charging me. I had no access to this account and neither did GrubHub. When I called to find out WTF was going on and they said I didn't have an account that they could close. They had no idea how to stop it. I had to get that card cancelled and change info for every account that was on that card because GrubHub were crooked and didn't even know how to turn it off.  I refuse to use food apps because of this.  I still get dinged every month on that old card thru my bank app where they continue to try to rob me of $11 every month.
A professional fiddler analyzed "the devil went down to georgia", and found the devils solo was ridiculously easy and not very good.
It's not just the public that's currently benefiting.  I'm sure the founders are getting a nice little paycheck.
Used to work at a ChickFilA.  Door Dash/Iber Eats were rude, impatient and especially upset once we started actually checking their phone against the “order” they were picking up.   And never forget the one that got herself arrested after calling the cops for “being assaulted” by a security guard while having a warrant out for her arrest
Good afternoon from Nairobi
This video was uploaded and after a few minutes brought down.... Guessing why!!!!
I gotta disagree about urging people to tip. Unless you’re well-off. I would instead urge people to order food using the store’s website and pick it up yourself (It’s shockingly cheaper). I’m surprised he didn’t mention that.
Imagine it's your birthday in 2021, and 2.5 years later John Oliver is ragging on you for having a lonely birthday evening with no friends or family to celebrate with you and in an attempt to find a morsel of happiness, you order a single slice of cake.
It is a little funny to see John, of all people, offended by ignoring a C&D. I'm pretty sure this show's working tutle was Very British Man Ignores C&Ds To Make You Sad.
That guy with the broken foot personifies the perversion of american society. No insurance, no sick leave, instead being forced to work under horrible conditions as a "sub contractor", so that some billionaires and shareholders can make as much profit as possible. It's a disgusting, and utterly broken system. Im glad that European societies reject many of these "gig economy" apps.
Wasn't this on last week?
I would rather not have someone handle my food that's not the restaurant. Always do the pickup option whenever I order take-out.
Or.. just don't order your food on your phone. Never have never will personally and everyone I know who does is lazy. I shop small and cook at home. Each their own I guess
Call me old fashioned, but tipping BEFORE the service (delivery) is bass ackwards.
I work for a food delivery app and it would be nice if the app itself paid us more. Tips are great but the person buying the food should not be the main bread winner of my job. But I am always incredibly thankful when I get big tips.  And one thing left out is that there are a lot of really bad drivers out there that do steal food, eat the food or are creepy during the delivery. Those people really ruin things for the rest of us because then you do get clients that dont tip because of the prior delivery person doing something bad.
So how many of you find spit in your food ?      I’ve never gotten home delivery.   I worked in restaurants and know how disgusting workers can be.    I got hepatitis A from eating at a restaurant.   I just don’t anymore.
I’m a guy who has been doing 3rd party food delivery since 1997.  The current apps are more of a casino than a delivery platform from the driver side.  A great day of $30/hr is offset by 3 days of $18/hr (gross not net)  They control who gets what delivery and proximity to the order is NOT a factor, their casino priorities come first
Doordash fees on our restaurant were 15% in 2020-2021, and we would do around 200 orders a night. Now they take 35% and we have dropped to around 40 orders a night. We are actually losing money just by serving on doordash
For people using these apps, as a worker here are some suggestions. 1. Remember you are eating the delivery. The driver often has very little if nothing to do with food quality, missing items, or wrong orders. 2. A good rule of thumb fo tipping is tip about $1 per mile. Most apps tell you how far the restaurant is from you.
58% is A LOT screams man who argues that the marginal tax rate should be 40-60%
The #Primus rendition of "The Devil Went Down To Georgia" is objectively the better version. The video for the song is 7 levels of #Awesome.
After working in restaurants since I was 15. And I do agree that you NEED TO TIP.  However that also ignores the real issue is that people shouldnt need to count on human decency to make a full paycheck. Because we all know how great humans are at understanding...
I always tip depending on how far from as little as $5 to $10 or more. One guy sent me doordash memes and made me laugh so I gave him $15 😂 but I don’t see how the customers are winning either when I pay close to $30 before tip for a $20 dollar meal at McDonald’s even with the premium membership. It’s even more if I didn’t have that
The trigger warning for people under 30 before mentioning actually calling someone was hilarious.😅 I try not to use the apps unless I’m sick, but understand that some people really need them like disabled or inebriated as he mentioned. They just seem to be predatory to their drivers and restaurants.
Vote for Democrats to support unions, good laws, and higher wages.
He can't get to everything. But one thing people do is report that they didn't get the food order. Door dash has it set up to take a photo of course of your food at the door. People will purposely meet you at the door and then report that they didn't get the food because a photo wasn't taken. They get a free credit or double order in these cases. And yes it happens alot.
I am sorry I laughed a bit too hard at the "human squidward". I'll try to not do it next time but that's no promise. Btw: In Germany, the problems with delivery apps was well-known before the pandemic and most restaurants' websites always mentioned that calling them like a boomer will be cheaper.
Just dont be a lazy piece of shit and make your own damn food.
I'd rather have a house than use delivery apps. This decade sucks.
I feel like not enough people got the Call me by Your Name peach joke 😂
Oh look. It must be Thursday morning  Thanks for the reminder John
Cant spell millennial without 3 L's. Thats hilarious
19:20 - Why indulge into the tipping culture John?  Why doesn't Grubhub just, you know, compensate their workers a fucking living wage?
No, you shouldn't tip. Make the companies pay them liveable fucking wages instead.
John always against tipping culture except this time?
Biggest fan!! I loved this show and topic, being personal to me. I’m glad you shed some light on this topic and revealed a lot of truths unknown. It would be amazing if I see a change from this…but that’s always our hope by bringing light to things. Stay blessed John!
I get ads for them nonstop but not a single delivery app operates in my area because I’m too rural, honestly it’s nice to see ads waste their time and not just mine
The delivery app up here has started a scheme, where they actually pay the customer for picking up their own food, instead of them delivering it.   So... Now they offer nothing at All, they just siphon the life out of our local restaurants.
I think we genuinely need John to run for senate or congress. His research is thorough, his policy positions are clear (and wildly progressive), and he has enough charm and name recognition to actually beat your average white bread do-nothing conservative.
Whatever happened to making full episodes available a few hours after airing the original ones? 😢
Tiping culture does probably more damage than all the delivery apps combined
What happened to Skype? Microsoft replaced it with Teams.
As a european hearing People say "make sure you tip" is so weird. no, make sure workers are paid a living Wage. The employer needs to pay his employees not the customer.
Thank god for liberals. Who will stick up for the rights of idiot business owners or lazy shit delivery drivers?
Not me googling Pad Kee Mao to make sure it's actually a food and not John pulling my leg...
oh am gonna love this one i personally stopped using these apps because they just hire people with no background checks & they have no or insignificant quality control over their staff it became a known thing where it's better to use the restaurants own delivery cuz they'll handle the items with care at least and take responsibility, if these FD apps fuck up the order, the restaurant is not responsible and good luck dealing with their horrible customer service too.  so it's one of 2 options:- 1- order directly from the restaurant 2- get ur lazy asses up and go get it yourself  now let me watch the video and add an edit feedback afterwards.  Edit: yep, i am right about the part where you order directly from the restaurant is much better, but turns out he's only covering these services in the US where I am from, middle east, it's a total shit show, let me tell u how they run their businesses.  1- if you ask for a vehicle, you will be given one but you'll be receiving a fixed salary. 2- if you have your OWN vehicle, then you'll be making money PER ORDER, which is the option most of these incompetent pricks choose, which results in these delivery drivers filling up the country and having extremely bad driving skills to make as much orders as possible quickly, not to mention the hygiene and food handling of these drivers is absolutely shit, which takes me back to what i said in the original comment.  it's a bad business module, and there is definitely a much better idea to implement out there instead of this chaotic shit.
John, I offer my delivery drivers(of Age) Cash or Nug as a tip and more have accepted a Nug(to share after work with the crew) & I still gave the same in cash as I would have anyway....Keep the delivery drivers happy, next times and beyond they treat you better....IMHO(P.S. I don't do the Apps, I call or web Page)....
What about the losers who dont tip????
0:45 0:47 the “what?” Lmao
You should not have to tip for the worker to make a living. If you do, it is charity, not tipping.
Tipping is evil.
Here in NYC, these bikes are fast, loud and dangerous
I don’t gotta do shit,
Notice how the delivery driver interviewed near the beginning lists many types of people who use the service, but doesn't list disabled folks, even though that's exactly who these services should be for. These services could change disabled folks lives, but only the rich (people not on disability benefits) can afford delivery fees. Frustrating watching lazy high college kids be able to afford these apps, but not people who are physically unable to leave their home. Gross.
This is the business model in America.. monopolize and squeeze out the independent owned family businesses so it’s all corporate.. yea USA 😡
Cafe owner here. I have to spend about 3 hours every month contacting grubhub in order to have them remove their parasitic order button from my Google listing, then have them remove my business from their list. They add me back about every 4 to 6 weeks, even though I have told them I will never work with them. Not only that, but their listing for my cafe has a menu from a similarly named shop, from a different f'ing state.... Door dash has done this also but only once so far 2 years ago, though they still call trying to get us to join every couple months. Knowing how parasitic these companies are, I never use them, and I will never partner with them.
Tipping is absurd. It should always part of the cost of the service. Decent minimum wages absolutely, medical insurance covered my companies yes, covering costs that should be the responsibility of the employers no way. Tipping is also terribly unfair for  workers that don’t have costumer direct interactions. Why do waiters get tip but the cooks don’t??? Fortunately the rest of the world has generally speaking a much healthier relation with tipping.
Caring about the rights and safety of women and girls is not an "L".
tipping culture is out of control if you have to pay for delivery and still have to tip.
All …. Literally ALL rating systems for retail or restaurant do not have separate questions regarding your individual personal interaction and the product or company you’re buying from
i dont understand how people can afford grubhub and the like. its like 20+ dollars in fees to even get them to deliver
I felt so bad when I ordered food one time and then the driver got into a car accident
I usually try to find a fren to drag to a restaurant and that way it feels less isolated and more fun and I get to order directly from the restaurant and when I get online coupons from delivery companies coz I use them so little they wanna lure me back in I tip the exact amount I got a discount for
1:34 it me
That is a super fuckable horse
Oh no $2,500 for a scooter bike. Try buying a car
Ah yes, another edition of "Capitalism is a blight upon society" with Smug McFunnyman. I fucking hate how you can have a highly unprofitable businessmodel that is kept afloat through big money, solely because big money can spare that money in hopes it'll get that money back 10 fold once they destroyed the market.
I try to go to the restaurant website to order directly from them to hopefully bypass these apps.  Didn't Skype turn into Microsoft Teams? If so they partially redeemed themselves for businesses
Sorry John, love what you do, but I won't ever buy into the social pressure of "tip every time." Tipping is meant to be a gratuity, not a subsidization for shitty companies to pay shittier wages. I shouldn't have to feel ashamed for not dropping 25% extra onto my bill to pay a delivery worker. The company should feel ashamed for not paying a living base wage.  I tip, in cash, as an added thank you for great service, not because some pinpad kiosk or checkout option is shoved in my face.
Yo ho yo ho I already seen this show
ordered from doordash my hamburger had special sauce on it #fuckyoudoordash #stophiringpedophiles
Go Puff has sex toy bundles😂
Grub Hub is food delivery?  I thought it was a dating app for tomato worms! #YouAreWelcome
Deja vu. I watched this episode last week on here lol
Bottoms be like OwO!?
Only suckers do this job.
It's actually cheaper for me to order from my favorite restaurant & have it delivered by taxi. When I first started using a delivery service I found out that they took their sweet time giving the drivers their tips from credit card payments. So, to get around that, I would leave No Tip on the app site, & give the driver a Cash Tip when they arrived. I can't understand how these delivery companies aren't making money. They charge the restaurants & their customers exorbitant service fees, & then they list the food as priced twice what it is on the actual restaurant menu. And many times, their apps don't list all the menu items available from the restaurants.  Seriously, it is cheaper to order from my favorite restaurants & have it delivered by taxi. Even though I tip both the person at the restaurant taking my order & the taxi driver delivering my food, it's cheaper because the cost of the menu item is cheaper.
Regarding tipping, I don't think that offloading the responsibility onto the end-user is the way to go here.  Pay the delivery worker a livable wage and price the product to accommodate that.
❤
I don't use these garbage apps. I go and get my own food.
40 min in and only 53,423 views? He fell off.
“Can’t spell Millennial without three massive L’s” Yeah. I felt that.
i disagree with the tipping sentiment. the companies should be paying the drivers, not me. stop offloading the guilt to the customer
or  stop making all these bullshit exploitative viable by ordering from them so godfuckingdamn many times. or at all.
No fucking wonder. I can't tip anymore. I thought the workers were going to be paid fairly and I feel horrible
As a driver, i make so little versus what is paid. My car gets screwed. Any benefits are few and the decent ones have the qualifications changed to prevent anyone from ever getting them. If something goes wrong, you either get punished for canceling or have to wait on a phone unpaid for 30 minutes to talk with a customer service rep. And the worst is the order and pay scheme. Customers mad thattbhe food takes so long because they dont even know that the restaurant never was on the app, and drivers literally have to go in an place the orders themselves and wait.   Honestly the whole model is insane and unnecessary. Just make an app that connects drivers, restaurants and patrons. Let restaurants choose the driver pay, and then if restaurants cheap out, customers can choose to pay more for it. And tipping is just a thing that should be done and kept by drivers. The middle man should at most get like a dollar. But 58% for nothing is wild
If people are willing to spend 15% on food tabs that are brought from their server from across the dining room .... Then why aren't people paying AT least the 15% from their food tabs. All of a sudden the food gets cheaper... ?! Sounds like pizza joints figured this out thirty years ago . People don't want to pay for convenience they want to pay for cheap food that is more expensive to get to them... And pay LESS. Please tip your driver for their delivery AND the cost of their time and use of their vehicle . Ask yourself would I pick up this food for that measly $2 or what would I require to make this worth my time. Most people would never dream of picking up your food for $2, driving it to you, finding your house in either mansions or funky apartments we have never been to, putting it by the door and then gettin only two bucks. Love how you got a Tesla but you tipped 2, like wth?? Go John !! :)
OMG!
I've never used a food delivery app, but I assumed that the customer pays the delivery fee, just like grocery delivery.
The best part of this segment is, even though it is talking about the American food delivery system, it struck a chord with me as an Indian as well. Despite focusing on the USA, its theme is exactly the same here, if not worse, and possibly it is the same globally.  In India, we have Uber Eats as well, but giants like Zomato and Swiggy dominate, mirroring the issues highlighted here. So much so, that just replacing the company names in Oliver's episode with Zomato and Swiggy wouldn't feel out of place at all.  High commission fees, exploited workers, and the erosion of local restaurants are universal concerns, it seems. Sad Truth!
only when the Grubhub Logo showed, I realize that „Grubhub“ is part of the same company that uses the brand „Lieferando“ here in Germany
19:15 technically you don’t have to tip. That’s the point
People like Tony Xu are the reason I specifically do not respect any Stanford Graduate anymore based just on the merit of being a Stanford Graduate.
I'm an old soul of my generation. I still prefer to get my own groceries and food. I've never used a ride share app or food delivery app.
Fuck the exploitative "gig economy job creators". They're poverty exploiters.   And honestly? Nah. 3/4 of these delivery guys are assholes who deserve the low rating. They consistently put the drink in front of my door so I have to knock it over to get my order and they know that. They just don't give a fuck.
The single laugh at 21:30 after Johnny says “..us, the customers”.  😂
Thank Bob that we have laws in Germany. I expect the driver's jobs still not to be all hunky dory, but I just spoke to one I know personally and he told me German labour laws force the German version of GrubHub ("Lieferando") to pay them quite well, and they cannot bill the customers because then the orders become so expensive that nobody would order anymore (A certain southern spicy fried chicken supplier for example demands 10€ for delivery in a 5km radius and service fee of 1€ on top of a minimum order value of 30€. They sell practically nothing via apps) And yeah, I'm one of those stoner customers. Nothing beats not having to leave the couch at 9:30pm when you crave some nuggets and burgers...
The Napster of our industry. You know... Artist like Taylor swift can be successful even with those illegal software .... The pirate bay
I used to do runs for DoorDash, back when we got peanuts for doing it, but i stopped when A) there was an ice storm in the DC metro area and B) i got in an accident in the middle of the night and i broke my elbow. If you pick it up during that week between xmas and new years, you can make BANK. The rest of the year, not so much.
Even if it’s a joke, finally someone understands that THE DEVIL WON THAT FIDDLIN’ CONTEST GOD DAMNIT
why reupload?
Gay parts should go to gay peaches 🍑 😂
Maybe we should focus on the fact that US tipping culture has incentivised places to pay a lower wage for the food service workers.
I have yet, and I’ve tried all the different delivery services yet I have never gotten my meal even lukewarm. I have to fight with myself before I even pick up the phone to order or go online to order because I have to have this knockdown drag out fight with myself and my better angels so I do not use a delivery service and pay no overpay for cold food. And I don’t care how many little clocks they have or they have their little car that’s on the little track, the little track is smaller than the big track that it takes to get to my house, someone needs to show that to them so they learn it takes more than 15 minutes to get anywhere and anything
Tipping someone who delivered food from a restaurant to your house, yes.  Tipping someone for making your coffee, no.
The entire US tipping system needs to go.  Pay the waiters and drivers a decent wage, transparently cost it into your menus, and let the bosses scamming customers fk off.  No way I'm paying 20% on top of a delivery cost on top of a cost for the app.  And the idiots saying hurr durr let's inflate tips (20~35%) on top of inflated base prices can really fk off.
I'm a millennial and since 2012, when I first found out that delivery apps were exploitative, I have never used them again. Instead I face my worst fears every weekend and call a restaurant to order. And I'm proud of that! 😊
I will never understand the tipping culture in America. Just don't fucking tip. Why is the customer responsible for paying the employee of your fucking company, that's the companys job!
00:48 what? 😂
Oh look! Unfettered capitalism literally spreading human misery in the name of profit. *What a surprise!* Would never have seen *that* coming after every other time.
I did Doordash for 2 months and quit. The pay is dogwater. Doordash gives you $2. The rest of the "pay" comes from the customer's "tip." What a stupid system. I also worked at a burger restaurant. Restaurants also hate Doordash cause they take a cut of sales and orders mess with the service in store.   So basically, DD makes bank by taking big cuts from restaurants while paying the drivers $2 while having customers unknowingly front the pay.   Also, some DD drivers are delusional. When I worked in a restaurant and they came to pick up an order, they would always complain about "I hate customers that don't tip blah blah blah."   WHY are you hating on the customer?! You should be hating the company that you are driving for, taking advantage of you, and being given $2!!  By the way, this is in California in a city of 100k population.
deja vu
The 3 Doordash founders are in the billionaires' club yet won't pay their drivers a livable wage so they really are dependent on tips so many offers go unaccepted by drivers. So if you want that food you order on the app actually delivered hot and timely you need to tip well up front. Is not a gratuity, it's the fee that motivates delivery workers to accept the delivery order. No or tiny tip, no trip.
How can they not be profitable yet be able to spend millions lobbying? I don't get it.
still no mention that drivers make ~2$ without a tip
It’s just basic human decency. Be kind to people please!
I really hate that I occasionally use delivery apps.
What happened to the full episodes?
This is so close to the Yelp business model, it's undeniable.
The fact that "they don't have a licence" is a reason someone can't get food is, what we call in the business, fucked. I'm too anxious to drive and to talk to a delivery person so I guess I'd just starve???
“Disrupt orphanage space” 😂😂😂
re-upload or am i having some extremely vivid Dejavú ?!
So customers should subsidize the app's business model via their tips? That is your appeal? Uhm..no.
Even when I pay the order over the app (or more specific, the app's payment partner), I still tip the delivery guy in cash.
food delivery apps, where i go if i want to pay $20 for a crunchwrap
Why is there not a link to the devil went down to Georgia 😮
As someone who lives outside delivering areas i really appreciated the run down
I usually only order from Domino's Pizza. Had a few Delivery drivers thank me for leaving a Tip as according to them, most people don't tip anymore. I refuse to use these apps as in the long run, they will only hurt the Economy and enrichen a handfull of Tech Bros.
I hate that the drivers make very little, and the restaurants make less. This is why I order directly from the business.
I've been binge watching John Oliver all week I actually forgot a new clip releases today.
I tip doordash drivers well. They are lifesavers 😂
This sounds like a company that AI could completely take over the operation of and nobody would notice. How are they robbing everyone blind and just barely making a profit??
16:10 I dont really know why John sees a problem again. It is just reverse tipping. You do a bad job, bam negative review, bam no longer on the app.
Tipping being a foreign concept in foreign countries>
Only those who were here when they accidentally uploaded the full episode can like this comment
Oh, they're making money. I don't believe them in the slightest that they lose money on their international corporations.
Worked at Blockbuster. This one hit home
This. Ty. Important.
This terrible cycle needs to end, always heard horror stories with delivery drivers   Seriously respect delivery drivers 💯❤️  Also does anyone remember "duck sauce killer"?  that was beyond tragic.
John, you doing reruns now, eh?...must need that yacht. I saw this already.. Oh, and please tip your delivery guy ya darn American lazy cheapskates. or go p/u your order your darn self!
As a resident of Beijing I have to admire the quaintness of this. Waimai for life bro 😢
The only one I use is Instacart, and I just do it for pick up. The other apps are not as good.
follow the money trail and it leads to pot of corruption
Yeah I used a third party food delivery service a few time. I have yet to have a positive experience. If anything it’s gotten me off my @$$ to pick up my own food when pizza joints got rid to their in house delivery drivers.
Why are people not making their own food? It’s so simple, cheaper, and giving you the ability to meditate and connect with your family/SO  You’re lazy and it’s affecting your health. Trust me.
Remember when the full episode was dropped minutes after midnight as a way to tease us that this Thursday drop was too much of a period of time to cure our weekly dose of depression?  I remember that...
Alright, but Johnny is a small kid, while the devil has supposedly been alive for around 2000 years. Johnnie's feat of skill is more impressive, JOHN
If companies cannot profit without charging astronomical prices, then they cannot justify their existence.
When I got the notification, I thought it said "Food Delivery Apes."
I'm sorry what?? Who in there right mind expects a company to purchase your vehicle to do independent contracting delivery services absurd and ignorant. Not to mention that guy chose to purchase an e-bike. There are endless delivery contractors who don't use e-bikes and are successful
I have never used a delivery app, I call the old fashioned way and then go out and get the food
DoorDash sucks. I worked for them for a few and randomly they said I had stolen and was fired. I never stole a damn thing, it’s enraging to not be able to even defend yourself because they just decided on some random bullshit. A week before it happened I had a delivery that was from a restaurant that had been closed by the Health Department right before I got there. So I talked to support and they told me to go onto the next delivery and they would handle it, I guess firing me for “stealing” a customer’s food from a restaurant that I didn’t even enter was handling it. THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BY THE HEALTH DEPT, I’m not stealing that nasty garbage even if it comes with a cash bonus.
Food delivery apps are a fee-infested scam. Order directly from the restaurant, get takeout if possible, pay in cash if you can. That way you support your favorite establishments directly and nobody gets a cut of what you give them, and if you do order delivery tip your driver as generously as you can.
I don't ever order delivery because 99% of the time THEY SCREW UP MY ORDER & THE FOOD SHOWS UP COLD! I've worked way too many service jobs to have any empathy for the people working these delivery jobs. Just because you work a shitty job doesn't mean you're getting a 20% tip from me for subpar service & cold food (that SHOULD be hot)  Do the job right and maybe people would have more empathy for these workers.
Please stop ordering food from these apps—you are keeping yourself poor
What I tend to do is choose what I want to eat in a delivery app and then look for the restaurant's own delivery website to order from there. It tends to be cheaper for me and better for the restaurant as we both cut the middleman
My older boss couldn’t wrap his head around why he couldn’t just look at the restaurant menu online and order the same exact thing for the same exact price- sometimes they don’t offer the same menu items on grubhub and the prices were ALWAYS HIGHER and it would always cause drama bc he couldn’t understand the app process and thought it was exactly like calling in take out only they deliver it. If only.
"Bottom friendly menu" WHAT DO YOU MEAN?! ☠️ don't gatekeep bottoms!
When you work as a Delivery Driver for a Restaurant....  1) Yes they need to hire multiple drivers    BUT ...  2) When Drivers are at the Restaurant and NOT delivering food, then you fill in the other tasks... i.e. Dishwashing, Bussing Tables, Food Prep, etc......     SO ANY RESTAURANT THAT WANTS TO SAY THEY"D HAVE TO HIRE 15 DRIVERS is ... A.) FULL OF SHIT  B) RETARDED BECAUSE THEY THINK DRIVERS CAN ONLY DO 1 THING  FUCK DOORDASH AND FUCK UBER EATS AND FUCK GRUBHUB AND FUCK YELP
If anyone is near Howell, MI you must go to M Street Bakery, it is amazing!
As someone that works for one of these food delivery apps, I'm ready to have my job scrutinized to hell and back. I'm ready. Edit: I've been doing it since 2017, I can say there is a stark contrast between how I was treated by everyone pre & post- pandemic. I was treated awful by customers and restaurants 2017 to 2020, but 2020 to 2022 I was treated so dang nice and people actually thanked me. Once the pandemic was "over" in the minds of most, attitudes have shifted to a middle ground.  I'm partially disabled, so this job is one of the few I can work, since the flexible schedule and being able to constantly sit down is a must.  As a driver: If you order food, please remember that the drivers are just the "messenger" and don't take out your frustrations on us. I've had people try to shoot me because they were drunk and ordered the wrong items and got mad cause I brought exactly what was ordered, please be lenient.
If your night is "lethally depressing," get help please
I never use food delivery services. I have seen the people who are making the deliveries and their vehicles. The health department does not inspect them or their transportation.
American dream! So stupid! Corporate greed...
Never used a food delivery app. Too expensive. Too many fees.
Why's it take a week to post these now?
Came for leech facts but stayed for the food delivery expose.
Saw it already... meh
Basically, corporations have found ways to pit workers against each other without thinking about it that way. Essentially the "gig economy" is about telling everyone that there's freedom and gumption in racing to the bottom. Corporations don't need scabs when they can just tell us we're entrepreneurs if we all just try and under bid each other for a pay per gig income.
Living in a remote rural area, I find it difficult to get ANYTHING delivered.
My friend paid $8 to get a Slurpee delivered to him. From a 7-11 that was three blocks away. Because he didn't want to put on pants.
My Asian grandparents always get upset when I tip my delivery person.
Uber Eats by Diddy: now with 100% more house raids
Saw this when it was uploaded the first time and watching it on its second upload. Why was this re-uploaded?
The Devil Cheated JOHN. IT was a fiddle contest not a fiddle+band contest.
I like turtles 🐢
Companies tend to have blood on their hands to profit, but it appears that even those in this industry can't break even.
I have yet to use delivery. I have used the old school delivery occasionally but i have never used corporate delivery services. Id rather give the restaurant the whole amount.
The skype's jokes seems to be eerie similar similar to Skipe's CEO from Dropout.
Ah… someone was inspired by CollegeHumor‘s Skype CEO skit. Still one of my favorites 😂
That footage that said they don’t make money was from 2020 (it was date stamped at the beginning). Is that still true, even after the pandemic?
I know during peak times some of the pizza places will contract door dash drivers when the businesses own delivery drivers are swamped. Idk how that works.
Gay parts should go to gay actors...logical...because acting isn't about pretending to be something you're not...cool cool cool got it
Real ones remember the full episode being uploaded
Johnny sadness and the unhappy hour let's goooooo
Where's the full episode?
I have never ordered from a food delivery app other than the grocery store. If I can't call a restaurant, talk to a person for 30 seconds and go grab it it's too annoying and I give up quickly.
DOES THIS MEAN THE FULL EPISODE WAS TAKEN OFFLINE?? 😭😭😭  NOOOO that was a beautiful April fools gift 😢😢😢😢
Last Week Tonight and  John Oliver is hilariously and awesomely informational!
ZOMATO AND SWIGGY WE ARE LOOKING AT YOU TOO 🌚
Used door dash once. Never again...
5y too late John.
Meanwhile in India, food delivery apps are huge and successful with none of the issues mentioned in this video.
HBO MAX is a scam at best, and their investors are probably criminals
dont mess with my doordash lol.  but yes, i always tip well. as with any service industry, that makes the life for most drivers.
Here at 11,536 views.
I used to work for a pizza restaurant. A customer once punched one of our drivers because his pizza was 10 minutes late.
The cause of what happened to Skype can basically tracked to "Was bought by Microsoft" :(
One of the people that saw a full Last Week Tonight episode on YouTube before the mistake was realized and this was then uploaded. Thank you for the April Fools gift, team 😉
As a recent bi, that Postmates ad with the fetish eggplant ticked me more than it should
For someone worth 4 billion and got 300k in 2022, Tony Du thinks starting an orphanage is like volunteering three hours every month.
Friend of mine wrote his master thesis about food delivery in Austria and the nice system. He worked for one month for foodora, with a five grand ebike lol, but anyways, even with Austrian laws applying it’s a shitty job, can’t imagine the USA… or wait, thanks to you I can in approximately 26min.
Unga bunga
Haven't used a food delivery app in forever, it either wasn't worth the price, took forever, missing stuff, or never showed up. The "delivery app" that seems to work well is Chick-fil-a. Their own app when they use their own drivers is crazy fast and almost the same price as getting it at the place. (not sponsored it just works well)
At least they thanked god😂😅
Hey HBO: I am never getting a subscription to your streaming service.
Watch it before it gets taken down again
😂😂😂😂😂
Doordash 😮
Watching this while snacking on McDonald's delivered from Doordash  Oop 😬
Just had to google VeggieTales under the impression, that it must be some obscure show. Wtf is wrong with you Murica, seriously...
Aye yo I'm early
0:45 - I love the fact that the incredulity from one of the audience members is so clearly audible!  I hated working at a fast casual spot pre-pandemic. So much more work, same great crap pay.
*Jamie is on the way!* while watching this… i have a feeling I’m the bad guy.
Delivery driver for DoorDash here, I feel as though this one is gonna hit
With love from Botswana ❤
Anyone catch the full episode when someone posted it on Sunday? Lol
wake up babe new last week tonight video just dropped
so when they uploaded the full episode on Monday and i (and a ton of other people) praised them, that was a mistake huh? -_-
Starting an orphanage as a hobby? 😂😢
1.1k in 4 minutes¿ RIP fell off
Aa nice i can watch your video from Germany again. Who had that great idea to lock us out of the last  video. We needed to watch the pirate version. So dumb. Fire that person
I am infertile from eating scented candles
Thanks HBOmax for making Thursdays the new monday.
Did hbo fired someone.. because I watched this
I had this last weekbut was region blocked
Tech bro who suggested opening an orphanage as a side hustle lives in a world where nothing is a front hustle.  Everything is side hustle.
I don't use delivery apps, but it's good to hear exactly what goes into them
Uber Eats is the Family Dollar of Food Delivery. 🤣
I know he's gonna make me sad but I'm super happy about it
The driver/biker numerical rating system needs to be abolished. Let people type comments about their delivery experience and others can infer whether they're talking about something that the delivery person might reasonably be responsible for.
(The thing that was never meant to be a living wage isn’t and therefore the government needs to step in and ruin it and destroy it and blame someone else for it like every other thing it touches) there I saved you the video
Accidental early upload notwithstanding  Does seem like surely we should do something about tipping culture... in general
last time I was this early I was a bonified c section
Welcome welcome welcome to NBYAYWHS: Numbers Being Yelled At You With Human Squidward!
Sixth!
The call me by your name peach 😭😭😭😭😭
Start posting monday mornings again   👇
Anything that titilates Jim Cramer is something I can easily do without in my life. I support restaurants directly and make the time to pick food up myself. Unglazed. Sorry, delivery people!
Every like = 1 chicken
Fifth?
Nice, just woke up for work.  Time to get depressed by John Oliver.
<3
I feel like it's just a cycle of abuse. People treat delivery drivers badly because they themselves are treated badly at their work. Break the cycle!
See, when you upload these on a Thursday morning instead of Sunday night your wishing us a Happy Easter rings a bit hollow, John. Hollow like a chocolate bunny! You lose topicality, John. Move the uploads back to Sundays!
First!

Here's a tip: Maybe the "tip" needs come in the form of higher wages and benefits paid by Grubhub, Doordash, and Uber Eats? Nah. That's crazy talk.
YES
