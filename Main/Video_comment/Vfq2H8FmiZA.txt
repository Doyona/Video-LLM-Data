Hello him I have a so much to tell you here I'm just so happy and he's he's so he's just taking off your glasses so because he don't know why he loves sweat stuff he can decorations but I know what happened because if you don't know when he self she always hit always take off your glasses so I don't know I don't know he's lost in you choose stuff he still have some nice clothes he did Friday my favorite Saturday comes a week Sunday whole week Monday or the whole week and Wednesday the whole week and Thursday the whole week but but we didn't know when when they come I live in the Sonic on whole week Friday Saturday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday on Saturday before you know when the over and over to me but a crime lot when I say a week because Monday the week before you cry please don't listen to sweet darling if you know what I love it's good to be here he didn't help something will be there I hope it enjoying your day be because you're a few good days have a great day to you love my little brother him yeah I have her own brother twice thank you so much I appreciate to you to YouTube thank you and have a good day
But hey at least u (almost) broke them
I never thought the day would come when not being able to go out because "my glasses are updating." would be a excuse
yooooooo he finally hit 1m
"And why I wanted a Smart Lock! So I don't have to remember to bring keys." Digital Door Lock: Am I a joke to you?
UNEXPENSIVE !!
Ok bet I just click the unsubscribe button
He could wear his old glasses in videos, but when not making videos, wear his current ones.
I wanted to buy them but then i saw the price
Hi
How did you get bts concert
This is my number 1 Favorit flog
big time rush… I went to their concert like last week…
0:15 Wrong intro. It's a Vlogging channel, not a Main channel.
They actually look better in 2022.
i agree
0:11 the unsunscribe button is down below lmaooooo
No
3:58 oof
You can also you contacts
omg it’s cheaper than my glasses
i like your new glasses king
He made a mistake his intro is plainrock124 but this is his Vlogs channel
4:09 that happened when my glasses got bent, the next day the pain would just get worse and i could literally feel the groove the glasses made on my ear. i just ended up bending them back
give me the link of the Amazon thing
No it  looks good
you look og with those glasses
3:59 not aware
Your eyes remind me of my science teacher
well atleast nowadays i cant flex my 2 year old airpods 2nd gen
Your new glasses are better
Dankpods
you look better with glasses
Those glasses look pretty good on him and am not joking
ugly glasses
hi
Me:thank you
Literally nobody realized that he used the wrong intro, he used the main channel intro instead of the vlog channel intro.
I actually like the new glasses more than the old ones
I kind of want these glasses so that I can listen the music in school and not have problems
intro: it’s his main  me: not it not fool
Fun Fact if you don’t see his twitter: he stopped using these because they broke and started using Facebook’s Ray bans.
You look very good with both galsses
You are very beautiful with these glasses i like them more than the old ones!
Always wear dad and used as a Bluetooth device because airpod Pro or waste of time when you go back inside inside your home looking for it for 15 seconds or 22nd you can't find it after 6 days you find it that's stupid as hell I believe you what you have on is better so you don't waste your time eyeglass sunglass Bluetooth sunglass Bluetooth eyeglass eyeglass Alexa sunglass Bluetooth
That's why having airpods or airpod Pro is bad sometime you waste your time when you go find them at your house waste your time to go to work or something you'll be late when you go to work that's why you still wear eyeglasses I know you look kind of bad with those but most likely you are awesome with those on eyeglass eyeglass Alexa make sure you always wear them so sometime you forget your airpod or airpod Pro you can turn your eyeglass on listen to music because we don't want you to lose your time
1.i look the new ones more 2.why did the intro said "plainrock124" instead of "plainrockvlogs"? lol
I had laser eye surgery and it hurt a little bit after but not much
DANKPODS
Moving on.... glasses edition
Please Bring Back The Old Glasses
Being serious I love your two glasses

Who’s here after him tweeting he would get a lasik treatment?
planrook im yore #1 fan plz respond
You got new glasses?
I just noticed that it said Plainrock124 but it was a Plainrockvlogs video
Plainrock124: I like it since you're still very aware of your surroundings while listening to music- Wall: let me introduce myself
So i went to see the final destination 5 eye surgery and when i saw there were no logic in the movie and that it was very brutal also the reason i wanted to see it bcuz in this video that he censored the  scene.
i kind of like them glasses not going to lie
funniest part was when he first took the glasses off and it made his head look small
I actually think these look a lot better
Who else realised that he used his main channel intro in this video? (Ik I'm late on this)
I love this guy

How about that battery life huh
It seems awesome
Honestly I think I’m Gonna get this for convenience and for style cause I need glasses and if I have them I can have them be used and replaced my AirPod pros and have to not remember to wear them since I use technology like 60 percent of the day and when I’m grounded I can connect a secret phone to them and use the music feature that way I won’t suffer and I can also have a way to listen to music during boring classes that I have so I think I’m gonna get these   Edit:Also I need glasses
I don’t think they’re ugly (they may look ugly on me)
2:49 i laughed for like 5 mins

10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular? 2. Save the whales. Collect the whole set. 3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 4. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of "Smart"? 5. He who laughs last thinks slowest. 6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools. 7. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. 8.  Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time. 9. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries. 10. I went to the fights, and a hockey game broke out.  Editorial:   Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
The ending killed me

King can you make a video of bored smashing on the main channel where you smash one of the new gen (RTX 3000 series Nvidia or rx 6000 series AMD) graphics cards? They're ridiculously hard to get at MSRP (WAAAY harder to get than new gen consoles) so would also probably get like 30 hate comment episodes worth of angry PCMR fanboys who don't have a GPU right now.
Whyyyy do u sound like you have a stuffy nose 😩

No cap he looks like a emo man I swear those are women glasses
4:58 *I am the engineer*
Hey man, I don’t hate on you. I love you but your older version is a bit more exiting to watch, I know how much time you spend on editing and stuff. But you sound so depressed and too smart sometimes. I loved how you where in the videos like grocery store phones 12 or something you know. Dont see this as hate, but as a tip. Be yourself and don’t mind hate comments, I accept you as you are💪🏻
The best part was when you ran into the wall
Your glasses are fine to me
Woah king ur cool In those glasses
Just admit it what you have...
Hello

You look like if Harry Potter got a concussion (joke)
Throw away those birth control glasses you used to wear. These new ones are better.
Sad no more AirPod flexing

Your glasses actually look not bad. I do find it kind of weird how it works. So I guess the frames just get close to your ears and that’s how the music works. Idk
Is that a new iPhone?

Honestly those glasses make me cringe but if u like the features then go for it
thx for reminding where the unsub button was

Hi
Yoo dankpods a great channel. Good purchase.
foony
I never expected Plainrock to be a DankPods watcher Also, I hate the stupid ring that forms when you wear your watch. Alll the skin there also feels super thin.
Also love you plainrock
Glasses with built in headphones? BROKE The only way to truly flex now it to wear both the glasses and AirPods at the same time
woah plainrock likes dankpods and they're my two favorite youtubers
He probably should have got one with a camera in them so if he needs to record something and he looks awkward with a camera he can just use his glasses just saying
Get A Haircut Now But Do It Professionally This Time And Don’t Go Bald
1 minute before an hour
lol
Hi
You should do a new Bored Smashing video but with a Sphero RC Ultimate Lightning vehicle on the next video.
