When is the R3 coming out?!
Man, I love this company! RJ has played such an important strategic game this year, as the administration has challenged their sector.  RJ has remained super diligent, and keeping to the script.  He hasn't played politics; he hasn't thrown shade, he's just out here building the business and leading that mission.
I have the r1s gen2 and I love it. Makes me wanna trade in my other vehicle for the r2…or r3 haha
Really looking forward to buying an R3X.  What a great looking vehicle.  Perhaps Rivian can squeeze a few R3/R3X into production in Ill. after the R2s start up?  Maybe?  Please?  😊
The R3 will be Epic!
Can we have hooks for a cargo net in the trunk?
This is how electric vehicles are supposed to look. I am 100% certain that Rivian will be #1 someday. At least, in America.
Good luck.   Don’t drink the celebrity kool aid.   I hope you find the time to design a vehicle that is much more efficient.
Whos here one year later!
Do you wanna buy  Winnie-the-Pooh Characters 😊😊😊For this marketing campaign and design usages. 😅😅😅
I’ve come back to watch this launch video multiple times, so inspirational! We have placed a reservation deposit for the R2 (will order top spec. Tri Motor!!)! AND as soon as available will place orders for the R3 (for daughter) and R3X! #AdventurousForever
Waiting for someone to throw a ball at the glass test. So it’s an electric aztec? Then we have a ten motor variant! Crickets so we added yet another glove compartment! Huge applause
buy buy buy !!!
You can't really make the whole "we're all in this together, forever" status, when you literally refuse to provide the service manual or parts to people outside of your own service centers. Rivian is incredibly anti-right-to-repair, and if you're anti-right-to-repair, then money is taking priority over sustainability.
This seems like an overcomplication of the R1S. If you want to make a smaller sedan, make one, but don't make a worse version of an R1S and call it an R2. There's 3 vehicles here, that almost look and behave identically to the R1S. Outside of the lower price point, there is almost no reason for these cars to exist.
SO dope. I’m a Tesla owner but I might jump ship and get a Rivian down the road
Rivian is already selling a lot of cars. Just look at all the Amazon electric delivery vans. Those are Rivian.
RJ is the CEO we wish Elon was.
I wish these would be available in the UK, VERY NICE!
ithink Rivian must in to Indonesia ,, HOW Tesla Coming to Our Contry,, this make a dIFFERENT for all vendor ,, make it Rivian to all world
Sad you killed the lay flat front row
Needs a dark headliner
I have been interested in Rivian for some time now. First contact via the series on AppleTV Long Way up 2020. Since then I have sporadically followed the development. I recognize that there are people working on the product who understand their work and can convey the warmth and accessibility to us as urban mobility very well.I'm really looking forward to testing your products here in Europe too 👍
I see more and more Rivians on the road every day. The R3X is the one I'm targeting. It'll be affordable and provide everything I need on a daily basis.
The problem with the charger port location is trying to use them at Tesla superchargers that you back into, the cables are designed to reach the rear driver side, you will not be able to reach the rear passenger side with these charger orientation, and most superchargers have this orientation to them so it renders the supercharger network almost useless because the cable won’t reach the passenger side of the car
I have a R2 reserved and excited to know the extras extras available for2026👍
The only feature I wish they added is a large sunroof.
Ayo Rivian marketingand engineering team if youre listening. Make the R3X trackable. Torque vectoring will be huge on the R3X. A compact 800+HP crossover SUV? YES PLEASE. Give it a nice looking steering wheel a bit of aggressiveness on the exterior design. it'll sell like hotcakes.
on the r3x the mirrors are orange i love orange
I really want the R3X as my next car. It has the looks and rally capabilities of a Lancia Delta HF Integrale while having the off road capabilities of a Suzuki Sidekick (maybe even a Jimny)
15:20 first row seats folding flat is awesome. I had that on my old Tiguan, super handy for longer items like 2x4s, skies, etc..
I got mine reserve, by 2026 there should be a lot more update from today, can’t wait
I would love to buy one but the look of the front light‘s is destroying  it for me. Keep up the good work, greetings from Germany.
Why’d he call the R3X a crossover when it’s clearly a hatchback? Pfff…
the future of RIVIAN looks Great!!! i want more vibrant colors
Super excited about the R3X, reminds me of an old VW Rabbit GTI.  Hot Hatch meets Rally.
For some reason, I can see the R3X being a car some car enthusiasts would pick to modify. It already sits fairly low for an SUV, as well as the short wheel gap in between the wheel & the fenders. I can already see these being slammed on air suspension.
Look dope. Can't wait (also, please, please, please come to Australia soon, thanks)
I am going to own a Rivian by 2026! 🤩
R3 is giving me Lancia Delta or old school VW GTI vibes. I’m all in. Let’s go🙌🏼🔥
Rivian R3X looks like a modern lada
R2 loved , to bad is not available  , waiting 2 years  is to bad
superb rivian🔥
Now let’s see what the car actually costs when released to the public. EVs are dying as the can’t be price competitive with ICE vehicles. Until EVs can be priced under that benchmark they will fail again and again until the concept becomes a blip on the history of the automobile industry history
Both very nice, but in a world with overly-bloated SUVs and trucks, I love, love, love the R3 and R3X.  Beautiful vehicles, and the design similarities to the OG VW Golfs/GTIs is amazing.
Rivian management team should shift production priority to R2 and surprise the market with an earlier-than-expected R2 delivery (2025).  I believe it would help the short-term sales, cash, and profitability challenges.
I love the R3. Cant wait to get it in Canada.
What you call a glove box I call a snack dispenser.
Where's the fog light's
The R3 is reminiscent of the lada niva. While I wished it's a small hatchback because hatchback has become the station wagon of the current years.
I like how he’s RJ is very well connected with the brand and team acknowledging everyone by their name and emitting his enthusiasm over the products ❤
Me rn 🤧
i want an R3X so bad
The interior is nice, and the scrolling buttons on the steering wheel are amazing, but it will be better to add vibration haptics on the touch screen.
So stoked for this! Can’t wait to serve the future of this company!
I wish you all the wishes Rivian. You are doing tremendously wonderful things by building these beautiful machines. Love it ❤….
Make an R1X
Frustrating another electric vehicle that can only go 300 miles EPA.  We need minimum 450 miles of range.
R2 looks like someone put an r1 on the xerox machine and hit the 75% button, missed opportunity to make that model unique. r3 proportions look off, like a 1993 Dodge viper with a hood that's 2x longer than it needs to be.
Too little too late 31% stock decline in one month says it all
Ola ola Ola Superman!
Love these updates!  Rivian Will absolutely dominate this market with these releases!
2 glove boxes but not a CD player or cassette deck? What's the point in having two glove boxes if not to store your physical media? 😉  But seriously, these new vehicles look great and if they are priced wisely, I will be buying one!
The R3X is amazing!
The most important part of this video is the EST part of the est $45,000. By the time it’s released, likely $65,000
Six vehicles from one company that all look like they belong together….
R.I.P Subaru
I'm Tesla for life, but I'm also a Rivian investor and I think they make great vehicles. I don't love SUVs or crossovers, but I really want Rivian to succeed. I love that Tesla is the NACS charging standard and available to Rivian soon (and every other EV from a major manufacturer), and that Rivian's own charging network will be open as well.   Good job, Rivian! May you have a great ramp of all models and lots of sales!
Really hoping the R3 rear design is able to stay that way, I'd be surprised if it was able to pass regulations without separate brake lights
Im excited with R2
Small truck please 😞
Charge port is in the wrong location for Tesla Superchargers, otherwise this looks like a great design
Jeff "Thank you".
Would love to see solar roof options instead of glass for all models! ☀️😎
Hey @Rivian, it's time you came to Australia! What's the hold up?
I'm stoked about this but where are the cup holders?  I still don't understand how a company that sells themselves as an adventure vehicle has two cup holders....that extend over the top of your cell phone charger. Rivian says they are listening....did anyone here say they needed two glove compartments?
Rivian R3 = 1970's Fiat Ritmo/Strada 2.0....!!!
Change the front
Great cars R2 AND ITS Cousin ❤🔥🔥, you should find ways to regeneration of energy 60% to 70% be first to do it...
It's Steve-O's younger brother, right??
The CEO looks like Steve-O if he didn’t do any drugs
I cannot wait for the R3 reserve button to go active. I just hope the design stays relevant by the time it goes to production.
R3 should be the first to production, it's BY FAR the coolest EV to date (any company...)
These are beautiful designs. Bring that r3 to Australia please. Ill buy one.
I've never been more excited for an EV than these R2's, and especially the R3's....Amazing work by Rivian.
Can we pre oder Rivian R3X soon? I'm currently owned Mustang Mach-E I would love a small off road type of cross over car. Love the retro look!!!!
Is anyone gonna talk about how pleasing that little humming hymn jingle was when the R2 drove out?? Can someone hunt that down pls. Need it for my morning alarm 🙏🏼🙏🏼
The R3 is more my style. Not the huge monster evs suburbans flooding the market.
Kinda wished the charge port was on the rear drivers side like teslas to make charging even more seamless. But that’s not gonna stop me from preordering this!!! R2 is my next EV!!!
I need the scale R3x spotted here: 28:15!
The R2 looks awesome, but my heart is calling to the R3. I'm hoping this can reach the masses that would be interested in a first time ev. If we are talking starting price 24k..lovely. Any more for a base model I can't see it being more than nitch
So no R1S or R1T refresh?
R3(X) is awesome, make it with LFP batteries and it will be my next car
This so inspiring 🎉😂makes me want to be a better person than I already am! #passionate EV driver!! Volunteering with @driveelectriccolorado as an EV coach I will promote evs FOREVER 🫶🏻
Until carmakers transition off lithium+cobalt, Ima hold out (red hydrogen ftw)
Wow. That R3 has me rethinking of getting a Tesla.
So Rivian adopts NACS and then proceeds put the charge port on the wrong side of both of their new vehicles... Come on guys. Do you really think the RAN will compete with the Supercharger network??? Adopt the charge port location too before you double down on what is currently a small amount of your own chargers.
I hope you guys see the comments about the r3x in the fact that people love it's based on the American Motor eagles kammback,Gremlin,ladas and the vw adventure golf as all of those are really cool cars as this
Buying nice chunk at market open tomm. They have a shot
These are GORGEOUS! The best part is that they’ll be coming to Europe!!! ❤ I’m definitely holding off on getting a car until they’re here.
Is it time to sell Tesla stocks?
Cybertruck mo bettah
Rivian Europe - let's go!
The steering wheel is to big
The R3 and R3X are on my radar, I hope this company can pull this off and make these vehicles accessible and affordable.
When will the RF2 come to Australia
Would like to see a frunk design more like the F150 lighting where you can sit in it, and more easily access it.
Please add CarPlay, it’s the only thing remaining missing in your products.
Looks good but you guys need to get rid of that awful headlight design. It just doesn’t look good at all. Love the vehicles though. Good work!!!!!
Tesla family here. We have an X and a Y. We’re definitely rooting for Rivian. Amazing!!!
Buy stock now while it’s cheap, Tesla is bound to fall soon
so who will be the first to get a "D2" license plate?  I wonder if anyone will get the joke?
i hope you could offer the r3 EQUALLY with the r2! that should bring you the corresponding sales figures!   just how people react (and your price) should show you what the market wants!  PLUS both the r2 and the r3 are capable of surviving OUTSIDE the USA! so it's up to you!   my fingers are crossed!
R3 best!
Est, starting price 45000  Whenever its on sale:  65000 minimum   I heard this BS before. So tired of this type of companies
R3 looks like an enlarged Lancia Delta from the future in the best way possible
Great cars and wonderful family. ❤ love it.
Love your videos. I just reserved the R2. I cannot wait until 2026.
멋지다 사고싶다!
This company is going to go far, their contract with Amazon is a great indicator.
Is that Steve-O?
Please bring to the UK with RHD! 👏
I applaude the technology and the ideas behind those cars but it seems that R2 should have been shown at the end because those R3 look like a FIAT 147, and R3X is even uglier. You can see how people reacted to them.
How much is yr R2 & R3X Models?
Anyone know the name of the chill instrumental song at the beginning of this?
Bring it to Europe and we will buy one immediately. 🙏😍
R3X and id.2all GTI/R really speak to me. Love them both.
Çok güzel olmuş. Bu sınıf araçlarda rekabet gün geçtikçe artıyor. Başarılar.
come to china and i will switch my tesla model y performance to R3X！
This was exactly what I had hoped for! My 07 forester won't live forever, so the R2 looks like the perfect future adventure buddy when the day comes.
R2 will be there sales leader, R3/R3x will be sales loser because very difficult to see the difference between and competes with other urban “adventure “ mall crawlers, plus the person who buys an SUV for adventure isn’t looking for petite and gentile version. I just don’t see it being as important to the lineups as R1 and R2
Super excited about these new products definitely heading in the right direction. Total win.
I didn’t like R1T at first, but then it grew on me. Seriously considering putting the reservation for the R2.
It looks like an Ioniq 5 a little. Just saying.
Those models look beautiful. I definitely reserve R2 for my next car in 2026
It’s SUCH a blessing to have a solid alternative to Tesla. Hallelujah. Well done, Rivian ❤
Charge port on passenger rear lost me. Other than that you had me for a replacement for my model Y. LOVE the R2. Just don't get the charge port placement.
Rivian really knows how to unveil a product
stunning !!!! Way to go .......
I want the R3 😍
I love the look of all of them, and hope they're all wildly successful, but please make 400+ miles the minimum range. I really like the idea of the R3X.
The timing on that trunk opening right on the line “I wanna spend some time on the back” was 🤤 27:25
Never imagined owning a Rivian. That changed today. I am so hyped for this company and new cars. Think I found my next car 🤩
It looks extremely attractive. It’s definitely prettier than the R1S
Why flashlight in the door, when there is an available/convenient glovebox? 🤔
Still can’t overcome my dislike for those headlights. I realize it’s the brand signature. It’s also why I won’t own one.
I placed my reservation today!!!. I hope they make the fronk like on the Ford Lighting for better access and the charging port move it to the rear left as its more convenient for the driver for easier access to connect or disconnect the charging cable. And last one, with the front seats being foldable, they don't have much lateral support. I am a bit skeptic on that one.
Camp kitchen and tent ⛺️ 🎉
Absolutely wonderful this guy is the best!
Had no clue Steve-O was Rivian CEO
Steve-O is too serious now.
Been waiting for the right EV and this was it. Can't wait for the R3X!!! Amazing!
Do I need to bring Electric generator in the back of the vehicle in case I need to charge in middle of nowhere? Hmmm
Overpriced golf cart that catches fire
perfect
日本でも販売開始してほしいよ
quarter windows pop out and people get excited? lol my 98 explorer sport has those hahahaha
28:09 soundtrack name please ????????????
]
THIS IS CRAZY
The R3 is really giving me old mazda 323 hatchback vibes. It was one of my dad's first cars. I still remember it.
just as i started saving for a model 3 ludicrous, i now really want the r3x. can’t come soon enough
Slam-dunk!!!  - quick question, how expensive would it be to make the roof removable?
Great products, great future to this company. I see it as a vital part of the American auto industry.  Much love and good luck you guys
Extremely glad to be a shareholder of this company. These new products are the definition of future EV Congrats RJ and Rivian
The r3 and European road trip. Yes please. It's perfect.
is it me or does the R3X looks like a old school VW GOLF (Rabbit) at least from sideprofile... I love it... back is great... sadly still don't like the Rivian fronts in general (mosly cuz of the lights)
2 thoughts.  1) both will sell well in US but also EU as they now can fit on EU roads.  2) heads up display instead of driver side display would be HUGE benefit as these go into production.  Easier to see
Reserved R2. Can we talk about the artwork and soundtrack prior to the presentation starting? Need a Spotify playlist.
Why move the R2 charge port to a place on the car that will make charging challenging when using it's NACS charge port on the Tesla charging network?
These look epic, will these vehicles come to Forza Horizon and Gran turismo 7?
They are going to sell a gajillion of these.
Incredible company, Incredible vehicles and values. Please tell us you're making an R2T ????
R3X will be legendary.
LOVE LOVE LOVE the R3x!!!!! OMFG I totally want one!!! PLEASE Survive Rivian! I love your company but sadly cannot afford the R1, I wish you success and if the R3x comes to fruition I WILL Buy one!! (I am Canadian, and I don't need a 3 row SUV)
Looking forward to finally having a Rivian in the garage.
Nice to see someone stand next to this that isn't 6'5" - I'm a bit on the shorter side and vehicles all seem to be huge/tall these days....
I'm ADD here - when might the R3 / R3X be open for reservations?
These all look great! Well done!
Come on RJ    seriously   a 100k truck that doesn't even have an opening sunroof?????? SERIOUSLY??
and you just layed off 1000 employees  and shut down the contstruction of the Georgia assembly plant.............................................This is not good news or reassuring to buyers.
19:35 this statement showed how Apple like companies have become in their presentation 😅, not saying good or bad but noticeable from Apple enthusiast perspective
Trunk and panel misalignment at 16:18
Ok, but what is the song that the R3X “walked” out to? 29:58
I'm hoping to see an R2X  innthe future.
I know there's going to be auto manufacturers that are going to be pulling out their hair!!!! I'm getting one of these vehicles. It's a shame that we have to wait until 2026!!! Production to scale is hard.
I have noticed in both my R1T and R1S that the front windshield makes a lot of wind noise when on the highway.  If I use wipers with washer fluid, I can smell the solution inside my vehichle while driving...has anyone else noticed this.....
Not much to see here...........Paul
A message to Steve-O, those new vehicles are very cool, however some points to make. - If the front of your vehicle is like an wall it is not safe for pedestrians - If I have to do everything in a touch screen it is not safe - If you haven't rear amber turn signals, it's not safe  So no, it's not the safest vehicle in north america
I pre-ordered R2. Good job, team Rivian!! But, can you please make the roof 1.5 inch higher. That will make a huge difference!
China e-cars will go to the moon in 2026
Tesla already did a structural battery pack.  How are they calling it innovation when they're following in Tesla's footsteps?
beautiful design, but i wont buy a car with that glass roof and without any physical 100 percent blocking shade.... i really like r3.
These look amazing. Modern, somewhat European but rugged and clean . Very Apple like... Tesla needs to step it up with their design and move on from the drama the ego and the vanity.
R3X literally rolled back on the platform. That should tell you all you need to know about where they are in development.
whats the price?
Rivian is my dream car. With Tesla charging then it will be the best car in the market.
really awesome but just make sure to have the charge port on the correct side. That will make everyones lives more enjoyable rivian and tesla alike at super chargers.
Great cars.  Please Include ways to plug in some solar panels to really go overland with these trucks
These are exciting new products that feel youthful, adventurous, capable, and more affordable! Way to go, Rivian! I would like to know more about the range of each model and the charging network.
Great concepts.  Two years out?  That’s pretty far away.
I’m starting to like this brand and it vehicles more and more. I wish them the best.
I don’t dislike the vehicle shown, but how about highlighting ease of repair or low cost of ownership? Isn’t the R1 super expensive to repair and that will certainly drive up insurance cost? What I really dislike about these new startup companies is that they introduce a car two years before you can get it. I prefer how it was always done before, car shown and then a few weeks or half a year later max you could go to dealer and pick up. These days they act like it’s on Poland or East Germany pre 1992 with your polski Fiat or Tarabant.
As Toyota owner i will consider R3X
Manufactured in the United States. History repeats itself this is an old but worthy battle between competitors years ago it was Microsoft VS Apple and we know that through adversity Apple prevailed, now it’s Tesla VS Rivian and I know that once again through adversity Rivian will prevail.
🫵😎❤❤❤❤❤
Actually, design of Rivian is more sleek, practical and down to earth than Tesla impractical cybertruck.
The R3 looks amazing. ❤ The R2 is even more practical - a very hard choice to make! I’m glad they finally make a size for the rest of the world and hopefully by the time they start to deliver the batteries will get better. 2 years is a long time in this field.
R3 is more fitting for European market
More great looking SUV's from Rivian!  Can't wait until I can buy a Rivian delivery van!    Very happy to see you are top safety pick!    I loved seeing the wind turbine at your Normal Illinois facility!    Pulling the tractor trailer out of a ditch!  Great thing!
Amazing show!
My weekend getaways are typically 400 miles at least. My current truck has about 420 miles of range. When will Rivian have the next generation battery packs that get 400 - 500 miles of range?
I like Tesla but need a SUV. The Y is just too rounded off. Cyber truck is too squared off. The rivian is a nice sweet spot in between
Let's get a solar roof / hood option. Something to keep that 12v topped up & accessories running at the trailhead while you're out backpacking for a week.
Scaringe's "Forever" concept is being threatened by constant loss of natural scenery due to wind & solar "clean energy" sprawl, now visible from far too many areas. If EVs are taking over, we need to greatly ramp-up nuclear power for a much smaller electricity footprint. What's a "nature" vacation if you constantly have to see ruined landscapes, plus endless miles of coastline where you'll be stuck looking at gigawatts of offshore wind?
The headlights finally look correctly spaced (wider) to balance with the front end styling on the R3/X. They've always looked awkwardly too close together on the bigger models, giving them a "vacant stare" look. Suggest inching them further apart on the next R1 & R2 updates.
These are gona sell like hotcakes
Awsome! Give us in Europe/Sweden now!! :-)
R3x is where's at. 😮
Of late ....Rivian > Tesla
The Tesla competitor we need. If I hadn't bought a model Y, Id have purchased an R2. Something to think about in the future though.
Lada Niva is back
R3 wygląda jak stary golf. Fajnie
im in love with the r3. its the honda e concept that i wanted!!
I was already in love with the design language of the R1 truck and SUV, but oh man I NEED an R3 in my life 😭 what an absolutely beautiful looking car!
He looks like a mix of Cristiano Ronaldo and Steve-O, but nerdier.
Make them in *RHD* too, please and thank you! The R2 would look great on Australian roads :D
The R3 could be a huge hit in Europe. We love our small and nimble hatchbacks. And even though the R3 is still quite big, it comes very close.
R2, R3, R3X looks much better than a Tesla Model Y.  Love there is a display behind the steering wheel.  Why Tesla can’t do this for the Model 3 and Y is beyond me.  The expanded functionality is amazing!  I hope the can deliver in mass by 2026.  Great job Rivian!
r3 look a Renault R5.....
Good luck to Toyota, Rivian is gonna take over🔥😍
The R3/R3X are the kind of car that makes you happy just by seeing it on the road.  Soo much personality... Lovely.
The R3 looks to be on my watch list! Perfect size for my family.
Good luck and God bless you and your engineers team for their wonderful creativity.
I'm not in a market for this kind of vehicle, but I hope Rivian continues to compete and win.
Europe is waiting for you :)
I own a Tesla and Elon is making all the bad moves lately, such as crazy price declines, removal of stalks and sensors. Rivian seem to be making the right moves. Customes will follow. Nownthat tesla chargers are open to all I may consider a Rivian
Apple of the EVs!
Can't wait!!
Did people pay attention to the self-drive feature?❤ Rivian released tons of surprises at the same time. Now, it is just matter of producing the car😉
Man, I really want this brand to succeed. Their cars are slick.
Less than 100$/stock, Rivian is undervalued cuz with that announcement Rivian cars are gonna be cheaper than gas and more efficient🔥
R2 looks amazing.  R3, but even more so R3X, looks like an early 80s Chevette.   That's not a good thing.
Gotta give it to Business Steve-O, he is a much better presenter than Elon. And the overall production feels more polished.
SO, no Scuba mode ?
Thank You for All that you are doing for Planet Earth.... Peace.. Shalom.. Salam.. Namaste 🙏🏻 😊 🌈 ✌ ☮ ❤
Congratulations RJ to you and your amazingly talented and dedicated team. Planet earth needs more companies like yours and you’re bringing happiness to the humans. Thank you! I love what you guys are doing and can’t wait to get my Rivian!
I'd love to see a truck the size of a Tacoma. Maybe even a ute!
Funny, I tried to charge a non Rivian at a Rivian charger. Charger said only Rivian's can use this station. Hope this changes soon.
Beautiful cars!  Especially love R2!
Rivian's look really friggin' good
The R3X looks like a modernized Lancia Delta Integrale and the classic turbo monster cars from the 80s.
It old suv but kids triple of cute 😍
As a trombone player I feel seen 🎶. Both vehicles look awesome, stoked to see them in person.
I’ve been a fan of their products since the beginning. Definitely excited for them to continue to grow. I hope they continue to work on those issues with employee safety at their factories.
Finally hatchbacks are coming back
Amazing work Rivian 👏👏. This presentation was world class and I really appreciate all the effort that must have taken place behind the scene. You guys are changing the world and we are rooting for you ❤️ ♥️
So happy with new vehicles as a fan and investor, it the shells on that R3X are terrible!!!
the r3x is insane
Forever , is a Promise RIVIAN cant keep. RIVIAN is not even Sustainable.
Love my R1T! Best vehicle ever. Keep it up Rivian!
RIVIAN vehicles , still made too HEAVY & too Expensive to Manufacture.  DELETE without Decontenting.
What's the cost of r3 and R3X?
Steve-O!! Steve-O!!Steve-O!!
Love the products. R.J said existing customers can access supercharger network. Does that mean new customers can not??
Yes, but the quality must improve.   CR’s latest data lay it all out there…..
RJ is such a charming and charismatic man
The one thing that I don’t like is the glass roof. That’s the reason I can’t buy Tesla. I want to have an option to have it glass or close it with the thick roof. I don’t want to have any UV light and wrinkles! I don’t won’t to hear the rain crazy sound on the glass. I don’t want to seat in the heated glass car living in Florida! Please do the option with the sunroof 🙏
One issue I have with these EVs is they are very expensive to fix, there really is no need for a light bar in a vehicle, it should be optional, one little bump and that's the end of it, and will cost thousands to fix
Imminent failures
When are you guys coming to AUSTRALIA?
Cool cars. Am I the only one that thinks there were paid actors in the crowd?
So, the big question is, how much money will Rivian lose on each car produced? So far, R1S and R1T are not generating them any profits. Rivian needs to learn quickly how to build cars in an economically sustainable way.
That was an awesome release! I can’t wait to get my R2. Out the deposit down before I finished the presentation- no doubt the R3x will be mine as well! Reminds me of my 1984 GTI
Ever seen how the Russian Lada   car looks from the 80s or cheap Japanese boxy designs from 80s? looks eeriely similar
Being an e-tron owner who's eyeing a Mach-E, Ariya or XC40 Recharge next, the R2 looks incredibly attractive to me.
RHD Pleaseee..!!.  Yes I know.. It's sucks to be in my region.😔
RJ, I like it, well done Rivian on both accounts, I would consider buying probably a used one someday. However. I think the roof height of the R1S should have been kept with the R2, and I really urge you to PLEASE RECONSIDER THE LOW ROOF HEIGHT prior to production. People like airy, boxy SUVs with high roofs. It's kinda like having a higher roof in a house, or apartment, it makes everything feel lighter and more spacious, and is more pleasant. The R1S roof was already low for the size of the vehicle. This should have a higher roof ... period.   Also, you should make rigid, framed mosquito screens that fit the four window openings, so people can put the mosquito screens in, say the top 1/3 of the window opening, and sleep with the windows cracked in a screened environment. Obviously I have some experience camping in a car. I converted a car to sleep in the back. I also have extensive tenting experience. There is NO COMPARISON between the safety, weather-proofing, and fun things like a radio, heater, and sunroof/ power windows, and full suspension.. car camping is WAY, WAY BETTER. you get to sleep better not worrying about the issues of tent camping.   HOWEVER... Mosquitos will instantly destroy that experience, and I don't understand in 2024 how a car company can advertise car camping without showing the mosquito nets.
Skip to 12 minute mark yawn
Boring brutal intro zzzzz
I am so excited for the R3!!! Finally a smaller ev hatchback that looks amazing!!
Without super charging network, hard to compete with Tesla
R3x is like a Lada Niva ev 🤔😍
Subaru and Jeep are in trouble.
Yawn, so these car’s comes out only in the US market ? Rivian definitely know how not to compete with other EV OEM’s. It is hard for them to be able to grow especially as a public listed company at a price of a tenth of what they started at.
Is it me or did it seem he wanted to say something else at the end, but got cut off when they queued the music 😂
Rivian does a great job with utility... very practical.. good job!  Would be good if they shared more details on the technical infrastructure... does this run on 48V?
Pump & Dump? 😅😅😅
R 2 Looks very nice  I already reserved one, I hope I will able to have it  in 2025
R3 has me excited, perfect city commuter. Love the double hatch. Can't wait. We need more Rivian's on the road so that the battery and electric motor tech can be refined.
great -- one mistake tho .. you placed the charge port on the wrong side .. right rear will make it infinitely harder to use the tesla SC network in 2025 -- should have been left rear
R2 looks like a miniature giant SUV
20k for a car I will buy anytime
R3X shape like LADA NIVA
#releasether2t
The live audience wooting and hollering makes it feel like it's at an evangelical church or an Amway convention where everyone is trying to convince each other to keep falling for it. They should honestly just do the intro like a normal youtube vid where the vehicles are introduced. And that way I wouldn't feel like I'm being manipulated with fake social proof.    Having said that, I love the trucks.
Amazing product line. Both the R2 Tri-Motor and R3X will fit my needs. I am super excited to be able to pre-order the R2 and hopefully a R3X soon. Great job Rivian, bravo!!
So glad to be one of the first reservations for the beautiful Rivian R2.  Can't wait to get my hands on @Rivian
Great video.  But, this is America and the average person measures things in feet or inches, not millimeters for centimeters.  It's always a good idea to use terms that the majority of your audience will understand.
Do you still need to use a screen to move the vents? Stupidest thing ever.
Nice to see Renault release a new electric Clio.
UGH Wish that R3 or R3X would get here sooner!
Please shrink the engine bay length by a couple inches before production. It's too long.
Good direction with going with NACS charge port. But Rivians needs to put it on the LHD driverside
The R3X looks like a rally car from the 1980s.😮
This is insane! Smaller Rivian SUVs?! Really Cool!!!❤😊😮😊
I’m from the border town of McAllen TX in south border region of Texas and if I want a rivian and if I need maintenance like tires and what not where do I go if there’s no Rivian dealer near me or any mobile R1Ts and vans
Revisé R1 redefined what a truck is? Lol
Loving the R2. Reservation in. Can not wait. Looking for a used r1t as well
does the back seat windows go all the way down? My dogs needs to know!
Looks amazing. One observation thought. Why did Rivian place the NACS port on the wrong side?
just me or does R3X look like a hopped up 80's or 90's VW Golf w/ some futuristic headlights and taillights?
Love the lineup! Wished the headlights are a bit different between the lines tho, or make it customizable.
So much more to like over the main competitor.  Looking at my first EV at the end of this year but here in Australia there is only one option if I want something with dog (pet) mode and camping mode.  I would much prefer something with sensors and not rely on camera only.
Way to take it up a notch Rivian! The product lineup looks incredible.
How much does it cost to repair them?
I would be interested in an R3X with another 2 in of lift and a removable roof
Genuinely Amazing. I believe having both (R2 and R3) would fit the family needs pretty well.
I got goosebumps seeing all the new Rivians!!! They all look fun!  I wish the team very best 🙌🏼🙌🏼  Rivian is so focused to deliver their products keeping their customers satisfaction to highest priorities.  Eventually all the cars will have to go EV.  I am sure they will succeed, they just need some time.
Wow! Rivian over delivers again!
Due to your far left extremist politics I will never buy one of your vehicles, but I'm happy your company is at least trying to force prices downward.   We need to get back to $50,000 trucks.
I like RJ‘s shirt. What‘s the brand?
I can't  get it out of my head that he sounds like a young Tom Brokaw.
I love the R3 and R3 X design ❤❤
Guys. The charge port needs to be on the driver's side if you put it on the back (right side if it's in front) so you can use the Tesla network without using two parking spots.
R3 Reveal 24:44
2026 can't get here soon enough. I put down a reservation. I really hope you can get some charging infrastructure in Alaska. That's my only concern right now.
RJ and Rivian are just what we all need: brilliant, kind and full of positivity and connection to the outdoors and each other
It looks like an AMC Pacer
I LOVE PEOPLE MAKE POSIBLE RIVIAN !!!!
Car look good but dont think they will earn profits. That price is to capture order for more investment.
NOT shipping to Australia? SAD....
How much for the R3?
When we can buy these cars, R2, R3 and R3X, in Sweden?
this is about to be more affordable than an apartment!! That’s cool they were able to get the front row to fold down 😃
When in Korea ?? Hurry up pls.😅
I wonder how much sleeping space there is with both seats down?  I’m 6’4, it would be great if I could sleep in this.
"And it's a vehicle that's almost hard to define what it is".  - The R3 is a five door SEAT 127 hatchback from 1973. With about the same ground clearance... You are welcome Rivian.
R2 should be more expensive
Beautiful
congrats, this one make me wanna get a R2 it grow on me
Very practical SUV . Most will like boxy design. Rivian has long way to go to be profitable, and if Rivian doesn’t get there, right step  will remember, rather miserably failed.
Sold… love❤
Gotta love it when a EV manufacture uses LOFI music in their animated intro sequence 😎. Much vibes 😎.
They have the NACS port on the R2. I can't believe they beat Ford to it.
I don't know when you're losing 30,000 on each vehicle you sell so it doesn't really make sense that his payout is like 2.2 billion. As well as cutting 10% of workforce
Will be cool if Rivian survives until 2026. Tesla needs some real competition besides BYD.
This will be perfect timing for when my wife trades out of her Mach-e
These guys are hugely benefiting from Toyota's (lack of) strategy.
Rivian short long term debt: $5.2B Tesla short long term debt: $5.1B  Rivian cash on hand: $7.86B Tesla cash on hand: $30.5B  Rivian Total Revenue: $4.4B Tesla Total Revenue: $101.6B
Awesome products, I do feel the R3 announcements detract a bit from R2 though. Makes me wonder if the team had been underwhelmed with R2 development and felt this event needed R3 to keep investors excited
If the rear drive smaller battery is 45k the version I’d want is Awd 300+ mile range maybe under 55k before tax credit.
Just reserved my R2!
rerven
All 3 look the same to me lol but nice car
Will definitely look into the R3x. Good size for a starter family or car enthusiast joining the crossover segment.
No mention of the partnership with Nissan..... hmmm
Sad you guys are losing money and "pausing" your Georgia plant!
If they made a 2-cyl diesel hybrid model they could call it R2/D2
Tesla and Rivian will lead the US into this revolution. I own both stocks and I am buying Rivian like crazy.
Thank you, I need a reason not to buy a Tesla.
@adampimpsner  What do you mean Model Y does not have an AWD? I drive one!
Hopefully I am done paying my Tesla when this comes out, my next car has to be that R2!
I hope they take some things they added in R2 and put them in the R1 lineup—namely the added storage
R3 price?
Amazing work the designers for these vehicles did.
When R2 gets to its second generation, will it be called R2-D2?
Let me order the R3X! Very cool!
Is 4695 battery made from kumyang in korea?
great job.
I can see it now...All smiles blasting through whoops in the R3x after dropping the kids off😎 Love what this company is doing! Super consumer focused with design that meets both form and function!
R2 nice. Much better crossover than the best selling Model Y.  While the Model Y is nice, it is based from or modification of the Model 3 sedan. Personal car I'd like is the form of the Cybertruck but as a van or MPV. While it will be a master of none, it will be a jack of all trades kind of a vehicle. The R3 is typical Rivian waste. Why go into trouble making a slightly different car from the R2 at a cheaper cost.  The R3 rear hatch door is likely to have trouble as the R1T automatic bed cover-just get rid of the the dual function door.   The charging port location reminds me of Apple design where form is over function.  The port is too low for most adults.
You get a glove box! You! And you!
Well now that you mention it the battery warranty on my Model 3 is up in summer 2026...
R2 Definitely now, changed center console, back window moves, open back windows, now definitely ready for my Cane Corsos to jump in back seat & be safe.
I reserved an R2.  I hope it comes s00n.
He just promised self- driving.  Either he's been hiding a miracle, or this is a false promise.
would like to see all EVs thrive!  definitely love the rear window rolling down
Anynody get the price on  the 2nd & 3rd model asking for karen 😂
R1 + r3 would be a good combo for my family!
Anyone else can’t wait to hear Andrew’s reaction on the WVFRM podcast?
RIVN IPO: $100     TSLA IPO: $17 RIVN now: $12      TSLA now: $178
2026?  By then it's OBSOLETE.  You need to get those cars to market BY Q1 2025.   These Electric Vehicles remind me of "It's all about the Pentiums" by Weird Al.   "My computer's got the clocks that rocks but it was obsolete before I opened the box...  You say you've had your desktop for over a week?  throw that junk away man it's an antique..."
So disappointed they didn't mention anything about R4.
Rigged-Playful. Let's change to Cute-Bad!
Rivian 2026 For The R2. By Then The Tech Will Out Dated. Also The R2,R3 And R3x Looks The Same. Come On Rivian At Least Change One Or Two Of Those Vehicle External Designs.
These cars have such an open and airy feeling to them.
R2T? No? Small truck, long bed? Please?
well done
R3X, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !
Wow, this is so incredible. I've always admired Rivian as a company. But now I want a product from them even though I've never been a truck guy. This is crazy good.
This is very exciting… BUT  If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, the charging point is on the passenger side, in the back. If they plan on leveraging the NACS (Tesla) network, then why would they put the charge point anywhere else besides the back drivers side?
The fact rivian is my dream truck is crazy
Love it ;) looking forward to put my hands on the steering wheel, go camping and take the family, and bikes, on new adventures ...  🤟😍
45k with the 7.5k tax incentive. Wow. I just sold all my stocks and went all in Rivian.
Great stuff! I might get R3X for my daughter. She has about 4 years.
I hope the R2 has a D2 trim😅
2026? are you kidding?
How many people will get an R2 and put an R2-D2 wrap on it?
Good bye, fisker ocean. The real game has finally arrived
I hope these platforms are painted with FANUC robots, not the current ABB's. LUCID is been painted by FANUC - UNBELIEVABLE quality. Teslas are by DURR - barely covering under the door, hinge area etc.   LUCID quality is just at another level of paint quality.
Looking forward to a Rivian police car!!
Made a deposit for R2.  It's pretty 🔥 !!!  This company will rock and give Musk a run for the money
RJ, please stop spending on cheesy commercials. I don't get it. Tesla doesn't spend a dime on advertising yet their customers still get it. Why do I need to see fake actors play the everyday Rivian consumer? Am I supposed to relate?
Looks like the ford flex from the profile and the his and hers glove boxes made me chuckle....  The R3 looks like the High school / college kids car .
I heard Rivian stock is going to reach new unheard heights when Apple gets involved is this true ? Apple did just shut down the Apple vehicle is this why 🤔?
I'm impressed. I just went to my Charles Scwab account and bought 100 more shares of Rivian.   MAKE ME PROUD!!!
2 GLOVE BOXES???  WOW!!!
setting the standard for adventure EVs - hope they sell a ton and can release worldwide.
Rivian right now is like an Electric Navigator.
I believe Rivian has done it again this time a great price range without sacrificing performance…. But I am hoping for an R2T Truck version????? RJ are you listening??👍🏽👍🏽
RJ > Elon
This company is not even going to be around 5 years from now, sadly.
Why are people so excited about the glove box? It has two? That's nothing new.
So R2 is $45K then how much for R3 and R3X???
Why does this guy sound like Elon when he talks?
I guess it is “awesome.”
I really wanted an r2T... but I had no idea how much I wanted the r3.  This looks like the absolute perfect replacement for my leaf, as it fixes my problems I have with my current leaf (range,  off road ability,  and road trip ability)... when can I pre-order it?
Steve-O looks much better now that he is off drugs.
R3x reminds me of a VW Golf mark1
Rivian just jumped to the head of the pack for EV design excellence from a newer brand! This is so much more appealing than the latest from Tesla (2022 Model 3 owner and Cybertruck early reservation here). I jumped right on that R2 Res! There is a huge chance that Rivian is my next EV, over Tesla. Cheers!
Time for a coupe sports car, Rivian! All of these are looking great!
R2 - you all should come up with an option package called D2!
2026 is a long time, but I appreciate the honesty instead of promising it next year and delay it repeatedly.  The R2 and R3 look so slick, great work Rivian!
R2 is nice, but I'd like to add the R3X to my QM R1S.  Would be great if it performed like a 911 Dakar.
I don’t understand this vehicle. I like the R1s but the terribly hard to fold and unfold seats were a dealbreaker for wife
I’m getting one!
unfortunately this whole thing reminds me of the Land Cruiser and the Kia Telluride. they marketed it originally for out door overland 4x4 people but it turns out they are just for Soccer moms going to the mall and people Flexing there pay Check. They lack any ability to modify the Vehicle outside of putting more stuff inside of it. Someone who wants to get out and overland would need a smaller rim or larger tire size to avoid popping tires on the rim. the articulation is pretty basic. Jeep seems to be the 1st car company to actually make an electric overland vehicle.
Those audience reactions were so over the top… were they being paid to be that happy about a new car?!
Where will the NACS plug be located?
I love the r1 but just having my little family of 3 I think it was too big for me or us and this one is perfect 👍🏽
It’s like somebody set into his earpiece and said “ stall, you gotta stall. We need like 15 more minutes before we can get this thing on stage “
So Rivian is building community spaces across the country. No wonder California is going down the toilet.
That frunk is tiny and hard to reach in.
So, any word on whether this new platform was designed to accommodate RHD countries as well? There are no off-road capable EVs available in Australia at the moment.
The comment section of this video is so cringe.
R3X just may be (Lancia) Delta enough to get me to give an EV a try….
$45000 is still pretty high for the average consumer
Saw a bunch of R1S’s in south Florida. Nice vehicle.
The R2 having a release date over two years away is obscene.  Why announce this at all.  When the R2 is available the price will in no way be 45k.
R2 reserved 🎊
when Elon speaks, he stumbles repeats and gets his point out, RJ speaks so clearly, I do appreciate this type of delivery. I love Tesla too......hard to make a decision now.
I wonder if the vehicles will have bidirectional charging V2H.
No hate I love everything presented. By why use production grade cameras to upload at 1080P and low bitrate....
WOW!! All the seats in the R2 fold flat - that'll be amazing for car camping. And that R3X is absolute 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 What an incredible strike between retro and futuristic. The design team absolutely crushed it!! I bet that thing will be a blast to drive on and off road. Also, NACS for the win, and those new visuals on the car computers look sick!! Bravo all around. I put in my R2 reservation right away to trade up from my Model Y when they're ready. Can't wait.
Not charging infrastructure. No one wants to stop for 45 minutes or an hour to get to an 80 percent charge to do it again.
CarPlay please.
Steve-o is really smart. Great job Rivian!!!!!!
I want an R3.
... I reserved one 😂
Refreshing to see a design (R2) that looks good from the start and I don't have say, "it will grow on you".
Tesla owner here...excited to see some good competition!
After learning a lot about the R1T and R1S I am very excited for the R2….. just don’t expect me to not call it R2-D2
Thats R2 mann will sell like hotcakes. Looking forward to owning one as soon as it comes out.
Am I the only person that sees a stretched Rover Defender when looking at the R2?
Throw a steel ball at it! Is it arrow-proof?
Sweet, it's got a cork interior, just like an MX-30. I hope the battery more more juice than one
Trombone mentioned!!!!!!
😲
I think  2 year to delivery ?  hummm  it´s too long.  What about a R3 RS or GTI...?
90 hours to fully charge on 110VAC, 16 hours to fully charge on 220 VAC and 50 minutes to go from 10% to 80%.  Hard pass
270 mile range for an ‘adventure vehicle’ just doesn’t cut it. Hope Rivian pulls through though.
Please refrain from being that person with the R2D2 vanity plate.
I hope they wont go bankrupt by then. I love their design and the CEO does not look like dr.Evil.
I’d love to see Rivian put a hatchback car top hat on the R3 chassis!
Love that community you have created. Bring it to Australia!
Good job Rivian team.  This was something of a masterplan rollout for the next few years.  I hope Rivian does a pickup truck on the R2 platform.  The R3 is Rivian's way to get into a more sedan/wagon space.  Just hope you guys can execute it.
Take a shot everytime he saids vehicle
it doesn't even look any different  total rubbish boycott this climate criminal brand until they make a real tiny car
I'll give you $20 for that electric guzzler.
I think Rivian missed an opportunity for the R2 to be a three row SUV by shrinking the front frunk.
am I switching over from Tesla?
Love it! Great job to RJ & the Rivian team. I’m very excited for the production of these and I hope the recently poor stock performance experiences a rapid and sustaining recovery.
Want
I think they just Osborned their R1 product.
Outdoors is now indoors.  Its a joke, dont ban me.
If I understand correctly the R2 is the size of a BMW X3 or Volvo XC60. Those should do great in Europe if they launch over here on the higher end of the market. The R3 looks a bit weird (but that hasn’t stopped other cars), but is in a relatively popular segment.  Succes here will depend on the actual price, range and dealer network. I do know some people who were quite sad the R1T never sold here.   Side remark: the shoes of the presenter?  Luckily he isn’t the designer.
Okay, @Rivian, during the event, I placed a deposit on the R2. More "speculative" than out of specific desire.  Then the R3 was revealed. So… will I be able to transfer my R2 deposit to an R3? Because I think the R3 was designed specifically for me. That is absolutely what I want in my next vehicle. (To go alongside my existing R1T, replacing my Mach-E when it's time to replace it.)
The Rivian Mini Cooper
Just loved it❤❤❤
I like it but I haven’t seen one in Canada yet.  I see Teslas everywhere…  Until they have dealerships everywhere, it’s a pass.
Boycott USA because they are killing the planet with huge oversized SUVs and trucks anyone who owns or drives a SUV or Pickup Truck is a Climate Criminal regardless of if its a EV or not... you are still wasting resources more than needed
Keep going!
This is beautiful and likely my next vehicle.  Did he mention tow capacity on the R2?
I hope the R2 has NACS charging port from the onset because it looks like a compelling model.  But the "Yugo" inspired styling of the R3X is a big miss.
Wait what? This from a company that just laid off how many people? Oh let’s not forget all the safety issues at their plant and countless injuries! Does this smell oh wait reek light the man behind the curtain???
Bought some of your shares, based on this launch.  You better not disappoint us all.
2026?! Why announce a car that is over 2 years away…
These are beautiful!   As a disaffected Tesla fanboy I couldn’t be happier and made a reservation.
Ok tri-motor, I am interested.....
What charging port?
GREAT JOB RIVIAN!!!
The R3 is the perfect size in my opinion but so is the R2!
I thought he's Steve-O at first :D
R2 its surely a model Y killer.
“A flashlight”🤦‍♂️ Still “2 years” out.
Yes.. Yes .. Yes.... I am excited for future!
nice to see Bob channeling Steve Jobs. Hope Rivian can survive....but maybe there's a Steve Jobs confluence here....if Apple just buys Rivian. At the current valuation Apple could pick you Rivian for what amounts to pocket change. Could be a great win-win as Rivian is rapidly running out of money and Apple wants to get into the EV biz. Rivian needs to survive, and to do that they desperately need a cash infusion. Maybe Apple will make this happen.
I’m begging you. I’m on my knees. Openpilot as ADAS, please!
R3 will sell like hotcakes, especially in Europe if priced well. Super cute package.
Bravo RJ and team Rivian! The new additions look great! Keep changing the game!
He's 6'1" on his Grindr profile
Both of these offerings are going to be huge if they keep those prices down. Design is complete 🔥   I love the size, shape and overall feel of the R2, but man is that R3 a vibe.   I’ll definitely be selling my model 3 to move into one of these in a couple years. I miss a bit bigger car with more open storage.  I really really hope Rivian gets it all together and get can profitable. We need them to survive.
It looks awesome. I'm not really into the head lights but whatever. I think this will sell well and rivian should really speed up the timeframe when these come to production.
R3 and R3X are sooooo good. that's exactly what I wanted my Mini to become and they just didn't do anything with the brand ever
My 2004 VUE had a fold flat passengers seat. A kayak slid right in! . All hatchbacks and vans should come standard this way!!!!!! Honda Element was the most useful SUV ever bult with all seats folding into a bed. Sport "UTILITY!" Common sense design! Thanks Rivian!   ps. Why isn't R3 called R3PO?
Cool vehicle!!!  And the CEO isn’t an ult-right lunatic billionaire!  So that’s nice too. 😊
Put my pre order in.
My brain is having a RAV4 vs R3X. iwantboth
Congrats to the Rivian team. I can't imagine how proud they are. I wish them nothing but success! love all the models but there's something don't understand: why keep the port on the opposite side a supercharger would be able to reach without occupying 2 spots?
Ouch, 2026 is kind of far out. Hopefully the announced price stays the same. But overall, gorgeous designs and refreshing to hear a coherent CEO introduce a lineup of products
Congrats.  You made an inefficiently shaped box.  Lots of innovation😂.  What is your drag coefficient?  The only innovative electric vehicle brand on the market seems to be Aptera.  Everybody else is just blindly going along with business as usual, making horribly expensive vehicles that use far larger battery packs than necessary due to their brick wall approach to design.
Mixed race couple rubbish plus pink shoes on CEO screams WOKE company.  May they go bankrupt sooner, rather than, later.
I love Rivian style. My three favorite companies style wise is Rivian, Polestar, and Volvo. I've been buying Tesla cars because of the charging network but I love all the new EVs that are available. The R3X brings back the passion my generation had for Bronco and Scout and takes it to a new level. How about a R3T?
Who else wants an all wheel drive off roading hot hatch now?
Great, more customers being told that their service won't take long and then their vehicles sitting for days not being looked at. Awesome. SMH
I hope they do well but with how much money they are burning and no clear path to production.. not to mention the lack of service stations. The one bail out is the fact that they are hopping on the NACS to have access to Tesla's supercharger network. Lets hope for the best (honestly just think Amazon will buy them outright)
The R3X looks fun to take to a rally course
I want a R3
The only thing I haven’t liked so far was the “parking it in San Francisco” part…
**Sees the R3** - looks like a MKII VW Rabbit... I'll take it!
I’m so proud of you guys!
Glad to see the R2 be a compact. The R1S was too big and this is perfect. Definitely gonna reserve one.  Only question is if it’ll qualify for the full $7500 EV incentive
R3x is inspired by vw golf 2 allroad from 1990, but that neo-retro look is actually cool, like the N Vision 74
Great new product line up.  Can’t wait to get one to add to our R1S.
RJ looks like a giant Steve-o
R3 = Modern LADA NIVA! Too Cool!
Placed my.order and waiting ❤
Top. When is Rivian coming to Portugal?
This will push Tesla to inovate.
R2: L185.6 inches, W84.4 inches, and H66.9 inches
I want 2 R3Xs one for me and one for my partner, It is such an excellent refinement of the Rivian design language.
R2 qualify for 7500 rebate? will rebate take off sale price like Tesla?
I thought I wanted a car… but the R3 does it for me! They’re in my head!
I like the r2. Wonder how much the the dual motor will get. They copied tesla design format with structural battery and cylindrical cell size
Tesla could learn a little about how to do a product intro. The CT event was horrible.
This is awesome. Great interior and can't wait to camp in it
R2 looks great, can't wait till it becomes available for purchase. Just one question, why is the charging port (NACS) placed on the right side of the vehicle, when the Tesla superchargers are set up to be charged from the left side?
Buying a used R1T this weekend. I'm so excited to become a part of this community.
Hold on! The R3X looks like a Lada Niva!
Amazing!! ❤
Fisker is somewhere crying his eyes out 😭
Dang, R2 really needs to be rolling off the assembly line this year. 2026 may be too late. Wishing Rivian the best!
So sad!  I wanted to hear about a roadster that goes from 0-60 in under a second which is coming any day now, magical self driving capabilities and a window that is bulletproof but gets shattered.
Very nice.  Now if they can just get Rivian out of last place in various quality reviews.  But hey, I drive a Jeep and Rivian is the only thing keeping it from last place
I was really hoping the "one more thing" was going to be an R2T pickup!
Rivian folks, if you're reading these comments, please abandon all work on R2 and pour everything you have into launching R3 ASAP. Oh my god, it looks so good. That's my next car if my current one can last another few years.
The R3 reminds me of a 1st Gen VW Rabbit. 👍
AMAZING! I love the R-Family! Greetings from germany.
Wiw, Rivian Power Network just skipped New Mexico!
Where is the charging port?
anyone know if these have V2G?
I want one!!
video starts at 24:58 😁
r2 at 12:50
The R3 reminds me of a modern Yugo. Absolutely sick!
Pretty dope cars, esp3cially the R3X
Isn't that just a ford flex?
2 new models huh? Bankruptcy here we come…
wasn't too impressed with this especially with Tesla continuing to dominate especially 2 years out for this car.
They all look adequately Rivian while forming a coherent line-up. R2 will definitely be the cash cow, but R3X is the coolest IMO. Right now my R1S is the right size for the family but can totally see downsizing or adding an R3 in the future. Also hilarious Rivian as the upstart beat Tesla to a compact, presumably cheaper design.
When are they coming to the UK?
Without cost cutting, these R2, 3 will not see the light.
IONIQ 5 is in trouble!!!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
This CEO is a fabulous product design lead. But the GA plant was announced years ago and they haven't even poured a foundation. Scaling and shipping is hard. I hope they succeed.
They all look great! Sad the release is still 2 years away
Steve-O ripped it!
R3 is already the Electro-Gremlin to me…
R3 & R3x no price point?
Price on the r3 and r3x please?
I cried while watching this is beautiful...
Tesla who??! 🔥
3 new cars and no pick-up, R2 still too big for the city, R3X looks like the baby of a Lada Niva and a 1985 Golf, 2026 is 2 years away, and the company is still losing money on each R1 sold, all this while RJ is getting paid millions. Would sell my shares if I was not 50% down. Being excited does not do any good to your investors.
Well, this R2 may be quite possibly coming to Europe?? ❤ been waiting to have one for soooo looong, I might even consider moving to California just to have one Rivian...😊
We can shut you down anytime we want .
Getting heavy Volkswagen vibes from the r3
Nice job!
If I were Toyota, I would acquire Rivian ASAP cuz the R2 and especially R3 will take from Toyota's market a lot
The R3 will sell a lot in Europe, if it is coming to europe??
Love these new products and super exited to own one and start seeing them on the road but for the love of God, why is the charge port so far away from the driver?
Missed opportunity not calling the R3 a D2 😁
Golf GTI MK1 EV plan back to drawing board @ VW
I wish they talked more about the charge ports on these…
That R3x finally has me convinced someone is paying attention. Subaru could have done this with the Crosstrek platform and completely dropped the ball. Also why is the CEO Steve-O's long lost twin?
Welcome to the family R2, R3 and R3X ❤
Rivian absolutely nailed it. The only miss was that they haven't redesigned the frunk to have a lower point of entry. It's still too high
These are very strong,unique and beautiful EVs. I know Rivian is here to stay.
I don’t like the design
R3 is so elegant like a little RR Cullian.
R3X is a rally car ❤
RJ > Elon
Wow... That's one of the ugliest machines I have ever seen... Google a 1975 Honda Civic... Yikes guys...
Elon Musk reacted sad !! 😂
Love the intro graphics
No prices given
Ahah, that rear door misalignment at 16:16
I love hatchbacks!
4:13 Did he just hit us with a Kanye line??
My only real complaint for right now is that they have no fog lights, too many manufacturers are doing that now.
Love the R3. Will it be below $25K?
Congrats Steve O!! You’ve came a long way!!!
R2, R3, and R3X will save Rivian.  They must ramp mass production.
What’s the pricing of the R3?
The R3 does remind me of the Lada Niva, I might buy one...a used one in 2030. Hope it's good.
Hey it’s Steve-O 👋
Not the best idea/visual, it looks like the service van broke down (@6:23).
I’m so in love with my Rivian R1S, and now Rivian is building a factory in my home state of Georgia. ❤
I really, REALLY want that R3X! Like , BAD! Thing is awesome looking.  Rivian, I hope you guys succeed!
I am waiting for the 10- motor…..
WOKE ... simply WOKE. Used predominantly single gender for advertisements intentionally.
I like how you’ll pay attention to the wheels as well, no need to purchase after market wheels
Tata Sierra EV
Are they going to be sold in the Uk?
next time  4K please.
hi's steve-O
I have the R1S and it's an incredible vehicle!
The rear quarter windows are cute… like my mom’s 1992 dodge caravan….!
Steve-O killin it on stage
The R3x is really giving Lancia Delta vibes
Not sure why but at the beginning when the truck slowly rolled across the screen I expected people to be pushing it. Maybe because nobody was in the driver seat.
CarPlay and Android Auto when?
the r2 is adorable
That PRICE 😮 I dropped by donut…😂
Can muricans please stop yeeha'ing and wooo'ing so RJ can actually talk. Flippin fanboys, almost as bad as Tesla fanboys 🫣
The design is amazing. Rivian, you have to come to Australia soon. We are a RHD market so hopefully the steering wheel can easily be moved to the right
Pretty disappointed in the NACS charging port location.  These vehicles will still take up two Supercharging stalls.
Reserved !! I love my R1S and I will love my R2 and R3X
Real electric car company! Not the other guy selling snake oil.
So much better than cyberjunk!
I hope there's a topless/convertible version of the R3X on the roadmap.  Great looking family of Rivian vehicles in the line-up.  Amazing work Rivian team.  Looking forward to seeing more on the road as an option alternative to the ubiquitous Tesla.  Scouts has its work cut out for them...
That 300+ miles of range for any r2 motor configuration felt like a huge win for me.
These look awesome. Getting a strong and likeable Lada Niva vibe from the R3.
Congrats team.
Where’s the R2T ?
This company's financials are SCARY. You would need to be very gullible to buy from this company that is clearly going to die a quick death. Good luck with your $80k+ paper weight when no one can service the proprietary software.
Wow bravi!
GOOOO RIVIAN!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻
Reserved
I wish I was in the market for an electric crossover haha
I really hope the R3X comes to Europe ASAP
Wish the frunk was powered. Also with they would do away with the two tone roof/ body colors. Their products would look so much better as solid colors. Otherwise I am rooting for them!
I will have a Yaris please  0-60 in 15 seconds will still get me to my destination
More electric cars are always welcomed. Competition is good. Interested to see hydrogen, gas, and electric on the road
How much is the R3 starting at? I missed it. Beautiful by the way
So impressive! YES!!!! Way to go Team Rivian!
2026 deliveries are concerning. 1, price might hard to keep 2 range be fall short of competition, where tesla could nearing 500.
Pls come to Europe Germany
Is R3 and R2 same price ? Or what’s the price for R3 and R3x ? So exciting.. wasn’t expecting R3 and R3x at all! Great surprise, awesome work everyone at Rivian!
They get paid to clap 😂.
R2, R3 and R3X look great! Also so refreshing to see a CEO that is genuinely nice and well prepared!
If Rivian can actually produce those in large numbers and also qualify for the tax credit, Rivian will become the #1 EV maker in the world. I'd buy two for my family!
Well done, team.  I love my R1T.  These all look amazing.
The biggest problem I have with them is you can only charge 25 miles an hour at home on a 220V. It's 43 miles an hour on a Tesla someone who drives an electric car a lot every day and needs to charge up quickly that makes a big difference.  They even say in the demo that 90% of all charging is done at home so why can't they figure out how to charge at the same rate as a Tesla?
Cheering for an estimated starting price of $45k. Small base model SUV nearly fifity grand out the door!
Steve-o really came a long way 🥹
WHEN WILL THIS CAR ARRIVE IN SWEDEN???????
R2 seems to much like the current SUV, Why not just do the R3 and put all man power and capitol to get that out the door?
REALLY REALLY HOPE AND WANT THIS TO SUCCEED 🤠
everyone is witnessing the death of Jeep and possibly Subaru
really hoping that atleast those R3's and R3X's would land in Europe 😭
😍🫶💕
Wow wow, my goodness. RIVIAN IS GONNA TAKEE ALL THE SALES FROM TESLA!
The lack of CarPlay is still a dealbreaker. Great looking cars though!
Those scroll wheels are obscene. Yuck. Ew.
Adrian countered by introducing a Model Y with no back seats!  Infinite demand!  Robotaxis!  FlOptimus soon!
R3 is the Saab 9X we never got
The R2 is a no brainer and will sell well in the compact SUV space.
3 rows folding flat is amazing
Its over it will be hot seller
Please bring those in Europe
He looks like he pulled an all nighter.
The took R1S and kept he hood the same but shrunk the body.
I love Rivian more than any car maker, but I don't wanna compare Rivian with Tesla. Why? Because Rivian's success is Tesla's success and the opposite. I like the win-win mentality 😉. Rivian's success is important for the whole EV sector so no one should compare Rivian with something else
spot that tent get up @35:30!! yewwwww
R3X looks like a futuristic Russian Lada Niva. I love it
nice
I love Tesla, but I also think Rivian is doing a pretty amazing job with their design and branding as a company
Broncos just became vastly Uncool… THIS is what I’ve been waiting for! 😱
how much is the R3!?!?!?
Driving cars is gonna be fun with Rivian. I actually wanna ruin the criticism against EVs and especially Rivian: Gas cars don't give a lot of mileage too and high-end cars swallow gas so Rivian now is actually better than gas cars😉😎🔥❤
R2 would sell so well right now. In 2 years, who knows...
As a 4Runner owner... I'm seeing the rear roll down glass👀👀. Good work Rivian
I am so happy for this news. Finally I could afford an electric car/ a brand that I believed in.
2026 😂
Happy to see SteveO managed to turned his life around
Freaking badass, im a current model y owner, ive always liked rivian design. This would be a super competitive size for the M.Y I'm stoked.
Great, now how about RHD markets please
Looks like a Tata sierra ev tbh!!! Anyhow all the best with the product RIVIAN :)
Maybe they deliver it by 2085
About time that back glass goes down. 4Runner vibes
Wow its amazing, perfect size. Exactly what i was waiting for. Rivian has take a step above Tesla, and this coming from a owner who has own the model 3 and currently has the model Y. Great job, just in time for me to place my order.
Was hoping for something different looking. Why does EV have to all look the same  even different models. I didn’t like the cybertruck at first but more and more I appreciate the balls it took to do that and deliver new innovation!
R1T = Midsized Truck R1S = Midsized SUV 3 row R2 = Midsized CUV 2 row (in my head it's called the R1C) R3/R3x = Midsized Hatchback (in my head it's called the R1H/R1Hx)  My dream for the "one more thing" reveal today was: R4 =  Mini Truck/Ute (in my head it's called the R1U) R5 = Midsized Car (in my head it's called the R1A)
R2 Limestone With Ocean interior   🔥
the charge port's on the wrong side on all of them
R3X is so first gen GTi on steriods, I love it.
I want the R3X in that colour... Looks like a rally EV concept...
Hopefully, there is a smaller pickup truck in the near future?
RJ, speed up the production of the R2. People are already excited and waiting on the R2 now. I am expecting a huge success so soon❤ NOVA area in VA is gonna love your Rivian more and more. Make a service center/dealership in Loudoun or Fairfax County it's worth the money and people will fall in love more with the R2
Really wish there was a 3rd row like the MY. We need that 3rd row a handful of times per year. Example is going somewhere with my parents, we can then go in one vehicle and toss our kids in the 3rd row, which they love. Yes its not suitable for adults but that was not needed for us any many other families either.
It is a fresh looking car
No R2 pickup?
Amazing it has everything I would want!
Sell TSLA and buy RIVN!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Home run!
I wish Steve-O Jobs would have one-more-thinged an R2T or R3T.  Hopefully its coming down the pipe.
I am very excited! Great looking options all around.
So happy to see Steve-o being serious.
I’ve been in love with Rivian since the announcement of the R1T years ago. As with most people, it was, and will likely always be out of my price point, but the R2 is perfect. I’ve never put down $100 faster. Happy to be a Rivian reservation holder at last!
RJ❤😎🔥 RJ, keep pushing the good vibes about Rivian. People already love and respect your cars.
Can we get an R2X with a dual motor please?!
Awesome!  Looking forward to Rivian's success!  R2, R3, and R3X look awesome, but I only have so much space 😀
No shade to Elon; but Tesla needs to step up their game!
Good job, can’t wait 2026. Hope the estimate price is not fixed with Elon Musk methodology (X 1,5 in 2 years)
Rivian -- you're slaying it.  The R3 looks fantastic.
rivian lofi mode?
Go Rivian!
R2 is a slam dunk. R3 will have a cult following, but not the same mass-market appeal as R2. Hoping this company can cut costs and become profitable very soon.
Anyone doubts Rivian is gonna lose a lot😉 I really really love Rivian and I am so optimistic about it ❤ I love u, RJ and I wish you the whole success with Rivian❤️
Scaringe is a much better presenter than Musk.
If they made a small truck version of the R3, would it be the .....T-R3X?
Go RIVIAN!!
As a Californian I am proud of this company for powering through. I hope to one day own one. I was hooked from the very first reveal of R1T. Glad to see R2! 💚😊
OMG!! Are you serious right now?   I'm in love.
EVs are dead
R3X Specs?
If the r3 is sub 40k it will sell
Man, I really want this brand to succeed. Their cars are slick.
love it! just reserved it...
I've never been an Ev fan, but after seeing r3, i might order one.
Absolutely amazing. Beautiful vehicles.
Nice, Rivian! These will be real winners if they do, in fact, get those projected ranges.
Wow!!! Awesome looking vehicles
IT still is massive which is not needed
If I don't see a hardcore rally racing build on the r3X with tons of livery and covered in mud I'm going to be u p s e t
Love it!🎉 And preordered an R2.
I like the R2. Make the rear on the R3 flat/swept out like a land rover back. delete  the colours of the R3X. Maybe make the face of R2 and R3 a little more masculine like the bronco. Otherwise good launch 👍🏻
wow!!! Love the R3 and X
Yes!
Proud to be an R1 owner. Proud to follow their journey.
We are rooting for you, Rivian.  I probably will never be able to own the results of your hard work but I get all the joy of seeing the future and engineering.   All the best and congrats to all Rivian owners.
They better start scaling up, because if they can ramp up production, they might corner the market for the right price. Great cars, looking forward to seeing them in Europe, Rivian!
This looks awesome but I was really hoping it would have 7 seats; even if it just fit 2 little kids (or my dog). So sad, but it looks like a Gravity for me.
Open a Service Location in the Saint Louis, Missouri area!!!
Love the new prototypes!👏🏻
Did they mention pricing on the R3?
Wish they would make a Sedan.
R3 is looking real good.
Apple car play and android auto? Finally? Want both R2 and R3 ... congratz .. this will reach more people that cannot afford a 100k vehicle
Amazing reveal. Nicely done guys.
R3X is sexy
Tesla killer!!
Congrats Rivian! So excited to see what you do next
Build a 2-seat, "global light truck" off of this at a decent price and you'll take the whole world by storm.
Thumbs up if you got a reservation
looks fantastic!!!
Hoping to see a service center up here in Alaska, currently the only thing stopping me from making the R2 my next vehicle.
Can't make an reservation from Europe 😞
R3 is giving me Golf II vibes, which is good and i think it could be ultra popular in Europe
Reserved 2, Ty RJ.
Im want an R2!!!
Adventurous Forever!  Fun-sized RIVIANs!   Today, R2 starts its journey to the #1 most sold vehicle in the US.
R2 reveal is @13:54
Finally, a great small electric SUV that’s not a Model Y. Awesome job Rivian!
I loved the Steve Jobs (one more thing) moment when you just announced another product no one expected (R3 & R3X). I missed getting pumped on these types of events. Kudos! RJ 🎉
Please adopt Teslas software somehow!  That would be ultimate
R3X looks AWESOME!! Really giving those vintage euro vibes, which is a very good direction to take IMO. If that thing has some moderate offroad capability similar to a Subaru then that would really be the perfect vehicle for me. R2 is really nice too.
Oh boy. These look like winners.
I would be surprised if Rivian is still around by 2026.
Already got my reservation ❤
LOVE FROM 🇫🇷
If only they could make them more affordable.
I bet R2 takes a chunk out of the Land Rover market
Man, Steve-O is doing great
I think rivian Ceo looklikes steve jobs.. your presentation is really amazing feeling for me, Thanks!
I have never seen any event so beautiful like this, this is such a wonderful event that too with in 36 minutes, without prolonging the event and not wasting anyone's time.  R2, R3, R3X the beautiful siblings, at such a beautiful affordable price in America. When he announced it starts from $45,000 , it's not only them at the event screaming woah, it's my inner voice too screaming here looking super surprised.  The white color of R2 is so beautiful, and also the sibling R3 both look beautiful and fantastic.  This event is really worth downloading and storing into my hdd.  I hope this company does perform well in global markets and expand into my country India with affordable prices just like this.  I have never seen any car revealing events live. This is my first time watching something like this and it's amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 and I am really glad I am part of this live stream.
R2 looks amazing! Congratulations Rivian team!!
It's awesome, from Tesla fan
$NVDA 🚀🚀
Starts at 1:52
Félicitations RIVIAN !
Good to see that Steve Jobs is back.
😅 greetings from Canada before any vehicle is sold here doesn't matter where it's built has to be approved by the ministry of transportation because of the strict crash standards and regulations thanks for the presentation it will cost this ev here $65000 Canada after rebate
Bro, I didn’t know that Steve O owns Rivian.  That’s sick! 😅
Wow.  Just amazing.   Great presentation.  So much class with this company.
Me: farting Crowd:  Wieeeww
Great job.
I wonder where Rivian will be sourcing the battery cells from? Tesla seems to be having trouble with their 4680 and they started years before Rivian.
did I miss the price for the R3 and R3X?
Only 300-mile range
Wasn't expecting the R3 reveal! Awesome! R2 looks awesome!
People complaining about long waiting time (2026). Just to remind, MelonMusk sweared "autopilot is coming in 2 weeks stat". 5 years ago. Still not ready👺👺👺. 2 years is nothing.
Love the R3 ❤
Bravo
$RIVN 🚀
Love it❤❤❤
To be honest, R1S already looks a bit outdated in the lineup photo. R2 is much better proportioned.
Wait Steve-O is the CEO of Rivian?
Welcome to beautiful Laguna Beach!!
The R3x feels kinda like what the production 1st-gen Honda E should've been... but also in "off-track"/"off-asphalt" mode...
Love all 3 new vehicles!!! Awesomeness! Great competitors to tesla and others
Love it!
Wayyy better than cybertruk
R2 is a game changer in the USA but I see the R3s definitely being dominant in Europe.
2:25 for those wondering
the R2 really looks cute
wow.  i really want that wheel and tire package on the R2.  maybe even the same type of package on the R2.  The R2 X?
Wow you guys knocked it out of the park!
MelonMusk is all 😤😠😡. RIVN is going to be #1 truly American vehicle.  Mark my words.
Nice, but how do you not move the charging port to the "proper" location @ rear driver side or front passenger side 🤷‍♂️
5:00 What a great message. All companies should look at what they are doing 😮
Over delivered!!! 😮!!!! ❤!!
I have so many questions. Can’t believe he didn’t say the towing capabilities of these cars. smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Diggin the lofi vibes, but when does it actually start?
No mention of availability in Europe. 😑
This thing is going to sell like hot-cakes
RJ did it.
need road-head spec with no center console.
