Such a devastating fire! How a life changing night! Life will never be the same for this couple!
SUCH AN INCREDABLE LOSS FOR THIS FAMILY.i PRAY THAT HELP ARRIVES TO HELP THAM RECOVER FROM THIS TRAGEDY. PRAYERS AND GOD BLESS EVERYONE. AMERICAN FARMERS ARE THE HEART BLOD OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.
Thanks Laura & Grant for your videos to show people what hard work is, and help people with the food you provide for America. God bless you and your family!! My condolences to your Grandpa for his knowledge to teach you . For i am a Grandpa myself!!
us can put roof fire system with foam that stop fire like the airport shedding have for prevent fire damage in the future I know money dosed grow up in isy dowet  in all u machine sheds roof
My ex wife next door neighbor farm shed burned down a couple of months ago and he lost almost everything he's in his 80s
Having multiple shops on the farm is not a luxury, it's actually an actual necessary risk-mitigation strategy.
Did he recover? 😣 4:02
Call taco head. I'm sure that THING may willing to help. Really!
I lost one of my race cars to fire. It sucks to watch money just vaporize.
I am so sorry, Mike. I hope you can recover with minimal issues.
Hello friend👍
If you’re putting an event together to help this family recover. I’ve worked with musicians for decades. I find them to mostly be very giving people. You should be able to find free entertainment from these exceptional people. My prayers are with this family and all helping to rebuild his life. God Bless all.
HI Laura
It always heartbreaking when you lose everything ,very sorry for the guy ,,,,Darrell
How an insurance investigator can claim the fire was started by a battery cable sparking, arcing makes No sense as these newer farm, construction machines have what's called a Battery disconnect switch which IMPO would prevent such a fire from happening. Their claim, cause likely has more to do with paying out Less money for damages which is insanely wrong. I hope people who are able to donate money can help this farmer out so they're able to continue farming.❤
Why are doing Women this? Are the Men at dieing in the US-kraine ?
In the case of only one person getting the fast-attack "water" truck, it should have a pipe to spray-gun up by driver's door. Make the pump fill & spray and have a rigid hose to siphon out of pond/ditch. Paint it red & white, name it WET RED! That will make it more easily seen amongst the smoke and everyone running around during an event.  GO BIG RED!
Make a red T-shirt that says LAURA FARMS in Nebraska with a map of NE and a star for your location. Make another that's deep GREEN with corn stalks.
Sorry to read this. My first thought when I saw your layout was, "Geez, you never put all of your eggs in one basket." Fire, tornados, whatever. We only kept three things in one place - spreader, bush hog & rake. Combine here, planter there, baler somewhere else, etc. Tractors NEVER spent the night near each other. The cars and trucks even lived apart. We also had a 'Hand's House' as a back-up home, if needed (which also serves another good plan - keeping your full-time help on site, no late to work issues, immediate help available if needed, etc. Cost of house deducted as rent and property value increases with time.)
I lasted only five minutes, watching this video.  As I live on my social security checks, I am not in a position to help (sorry).  Prayers🙏
Sorry for your loss Mike and family. Looking at the comparison between your destroyed building and equipment and what Laura showed in there equipment building is an eye opener.  Laura and Grant looking at your building I am surprised to see no water sprinkler system inside the building. Do you have a smoke alarm system in your shed linked to your phone, I am sure farmers like yourselves would have enough old bits and pieces laying around to make and install even a basic sprinkler system inside your buildings. Just a couple of ideas that may help. Best wishes from a Kiwi fan from New Zealand.
Insurance companies..... hmmmm!
hello what i don't understand is why are these farmers losing equipment due to unknown reasons.  i seen two video post you two created where one farmers equipment burned down out in the crop and now this farmer lost his shop with equipment.  just doesnt make sense to me but i'm not a farmer.
There is so so much to say about alarm systems, sprinklers systems, fire extinguishers available to help mitigate and minimize such gut wrenching loss.  I am so saddened for this man.  Can you separate the larger value machines from each other to minimize a loss Laura?  I know very well what you are talking about.  I am retired from the Fire Service.  Do you have extinguishers near every door and opening in your buildings?  Do you guys check them?  How are your buildings alarmed are the alarms loud?  Think and eat fire protection.
thank you for helping them
update please
Steel was superheated by eddy currents induced by microwave energy blast.  This was no "fire" -- any "fire" was secondary.  This was an attack on farm equipment (to test and help normalize public opinion) and ultimately upon farmer and food and culture.  Look at Laura's video showing the steel 18-wheel chassis completely 'melted-thru' by the energy ray -- "fire" does not do this; that kind of damage might not even be possible in a blast furnace!  Or ignore these 'impossible' findings, go back to sleep, and think military beam weaponry is somehow pretend, many decades after it was first revealed.

Laura don't you have a main electric cut off switch on those tractors I have one on the Peterbilt switch the cutoff you don't have to worry about electric fires ?
We can do a lot if we all just do a little.   Please help.  Any amount is appreciated, every little bit will help.
My neighbor In Canada lost his barn bone to the ground my dad helped him out to he will build a name
2023 😮😢 2024🚜🤠
Bless him and his family 😢😢
Laura has there been an update video about this? How did Mike rebound I'm sure the community came together to help with Harvest last year was he able to continue on farming for 2024 season
It call insurance  quit that  cry stuff
Just sitting here watching this is making me ugly cry. This is just so devastating
Even with insurance,  such losses are devastating in that so much is lost forever and replacing it takes  a long time. I just saw  this  video in September 2024. I hope he  has recovered  somewhat. Prayers...
He needs to get him a different insurance company why is he paying the insurance if they're not going to help him he needs a new insurance I don't have money but I can pray for you
Mike, you have my deepest sympathies. I know it's about a year later, but I hope all is going well. All I can offer is my prayers, but you definitely have those, Sir. 💔💔💔💔💔
What a crushing disaster.  😢
Can he use old stuff to get started ?
That's what his has a way of living. Is all right in a fire? I'm a volunteer fireman, right? I'm a volunteer first responder. And I appreciate these people get help.  If some generous people on this internet help them out to get back on your fbe and appreciate what you do to help them. All it's just, it's a tragedy when you lose everything in the fire. I know I'm a volunteer fireman. And.  They need help help you appreciate if you help them out

Thanks!
You are not bragging, you are educating those of us who have no idea as to the investments made by farmers to bring us our food.
Our thoughts and prayers to you and your neighbors  and pray for his recovery!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Vc perdeu  uma colhedeir maes  vc  tem   A melhor  coisas  essa  Jovevem
Calma  vc  tem  tudo
Your not bragging when your raising awareness to that family’s tragedy
I think some sort of fire suppression is in order for every farm shop.
On the bright side, local blacksmith has plenty of materials for projects now.
Several generations to afford it? Or to build up the credit to get it? Either way, farmers get the poke without any lube.  They should be able to get 10, 50, 100× their investment,  but, banks, equipment dealers, seed sellers ALL got their greedy hands on top of the cookie jar.  Any updates yet? Been 7 months since the fire.
Sprinklers in the roof if a fire should break out?
I have put your story on my Facebook page so I hope that he can get help. What is his address?So I have alot of friends who have alot of money. I have a friend that is a pime trucking company.
I have put your story on my Facebook page so that he can get help.
As a city dweller… I hate to be the ahole and devils advocate but has this fire been investigated and cleared of arson.  Fires in and of themselves are suspicious. Having pulled in all the equipment because of an impending storm seems tragically coincidental. Will Mike stay n farming or get a really big check, even if not at par with actually worth of each individual piece - insurance doesn’t work that way, then sell the land and start a new life?
You guys over there have insurance for that...right!?
One more reason WHY you shouldn't hitch your buildings together!! Common sense would dictate this!
The best way to prevent fires like that is to keep your shop clean, a dirty shop is a fire waiting for an ignition source. You should look into getting a couple of flammable storage lockers to keep all your flammable material/chemicals in. Gas, oil, paint, etc, if it’s flammable it should be stored in one.   Along those lines you should get an oily waste can to throw oily rags and other trash that has flammable substances on them. They’re metal cans with a self closing lid that prevent fires.  Never throw flammable waste in your trash can.  Oily rags can spontaneously combust pretty easily (Google it), but all it takes is one spark from a welder or grinder and they can smolder unnoticed for hours before bursting into flames.
สหรัฐอเมริกาไม่ดีอย่างที่คุณเห็นหรอกต้นทุนสูงมาก การคาดหวังผลผลิตทางการเกษตร สูงมากแรงกดดันสุดขีด
Do you guys put in sprinkler systems in these buildings?
I just can't understand how steel and concrete burn like that. You would think it would be half full of hay or wood to create that hot of fire. That was crazy hot fire. Great job prayers for all farmers.
I've seen this happen many times by fire or by tornado/storm, and even one arson fire. You can't put a dollar amount on what was loss, but I do know one thing, neighbors always pull together to help each other out in the country.  Insurance helps, but it won't come even close to what was lost. Hope he can recover and keep operating, such a tragedy. Glad nobody was physically hurt!  One of the worst I've been to was a hog building full of hogs.......I can never get the sound of the hogs being burned to death out of my head. I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.
Fire suppression. Just thoughts.
Sounds like a insurance scam to me...
I come from farm country in upstate New York.  I have a deep respect for famers.  It's an extremely hard job and unforgiving lifestyle.  I don't remember many farmers having time for to waste.  It seemed that they were always farming or preparing and repairing their machines.  The farms were not as large as the farms in the Midwest but nevertheless equally as important to our country in suppling various products. It's a shame that our government hasn't a program to help in situations like this. I wish Mike all the luck in the world in recovering from this.
As a retired firefighter I have seen this many times in 43 years. I can offer some suggestions that may be able to prevent this. While a sprinkler system in the building may hold a fire in check the cost of the system is most likely to be prohibitive. since the building would have to be insulated and heated. A fire alarm system with smoke or heat detection may work. I think, smoke alarms would be sensitive to dust and vehicle exhaust causing false alarms. Then there is a cost to have the system monitored 24 hours so when you are away the FD still gets called. Early detection will help but response time from the nearest fire department may exceed 10 minutes. So the only thing that I think may really work is to disconnect the batteries on the equipment when being stored. This is important if you are having an issue with a piece of equipment but have not figured out the cause yet. There is no one perfect answer to prevent these tragedies and you know best what will work for you. Best of luck to Mike and his family.
There is nothing worse because a total loss speaking from personal experience you lose everything. I they where insured even then its not the stuff you had before. ❤💚✌👍
I really want to go to your place, to your garden and of course to your city
Wire fires suck! We just lost our 04 dodge ram 2500 to a wire fire. We h  ad the tqruck fr almost 20 years and kept it in good condition. Went to visit my brother and parked it in his driveway. 45 minutes later the whole front end  erupted in flames. Luckily we not close to it  nor driving it. I can only imagine what yr friend is going thru?! I wish him luck!
How are they doing?  We made a sizeable donation to them.
Why insurance is not cover all of it?
I also think the general public don't appreciate quite how clever and therefore complex general farm equipment is, so they don't appreciate how a tractor can cost 1000 times what their car does. Please can you do a deep dive series on each piece of farm equipment explaining what it does, how it does it, every feature it has, why it's helpful to you and what it costs? Please don't cut it short and make it shallow (like the discovery channel or how its made), let it take as many videos as it takes. Lets open some eyes so people can appreciate the loss you're showing here.
Thanks for sharing your estimates on the money tied up in your very necessary equipment. Personally I think you underestimated consistently. It's not bragging when you share necessary costs. You're a farmer, you need equipment, we get it so dont shy away from that. Give us some ideas of the cash flow and profit margin, and most people will ask why you do such a financially unstable, high capital, high risk, low return business. Farming is not financially easy, people need to know that, and being open with your books for a year would probably open their eyes in horror.
To shut off battery
I'm confused. Why wouldn't the insurance cover the cost of the loss? If it doesn't, what's the point of it? Thanks for half the money for half a replacement tractor, I'll go plow half the field with the half of the tractor I can buy. Two wheels, half an engine block, half a seat, half a hitch? It'll be fine, I'll just task one arm and one leg to the job and my other limbs can go and do something useful. Maybe sell insurance?
That is why I always had a disconnect on all equipment sorry for his loss bad deal
I feel his pain. I own a truck and had  to have my foot cut on. But the payments do not stop. I am self employed and have no money coming in and banks do not care. They want money and I have told them that. So I feel pain. Sorry.
I remember  watching our neighbors  farm harvest beans.  I saw the combine on fire. Fortunately, it was more smoke then fire. I grabbed several buckets of water and fire extinguisher. I ran my pickup down to help him out. He did not need much help, and everything turned out Allright .
insurance is there for a reason
His insurance didn’t do his job. He should go out to the farms once a year to update values.
I'm on Social Security at 76. I wish you well . Ill say a prayer for your recovery.
Insurance big payouts
Fire has no master. The one thing about a catastrophic event is that the human condition, polite in their actions, come together as one to get things done, to move on quietly and quickly. My heart goes to all involved. Gavin Australia 🇦🇺 ♥️
Are the burnt equipment yours?
Understand and will help.  Good video.
Can't you all install sprinklers over head in the buildings you put your tractors in incase of fire? it is so sad to here someone has lost everything and I know how quick it is to have a half a mill. in one piece people just don't know be safe God Bless
Hey Laura, have watched your videos and sadly something bad has always happened, is it the area you live in or is there a bad bad habits that are cause these things to happen I watch Larson Farms every day and don't see these things happening to them I will pray for you all as always stay safe and God Bless
Thanks
MIC SENDING YOU LOVE AND SUPPORT IN YOUR TIME OF HARDSHIP AND A MASSIVE LOSS. THINKING OF YOU MATE KEEP SMILING YOU WILL GET THERE.   BEN FROM AUSTRALIA
There is a special place in hell for insurence.  You pay and pay and pay.  Not covered not covered...dropped...rates raised.
Dear loura 👍 you are fine ?    OMG 😱...
Laura can you stop wearing so much make up?
Wow, I’d be willing to let you borrow my tractor if that helps, it’s not a half-million dollars but it’s Great
Dear loura 👍?
Bravi e complimenti per l'aiuto che avete dato al vostro amico.
Seems to me like a fire suppression system should be built into these building's that store equipment. Might be easier to clean up fire suppression foam than buy a new combine.
Doesn’t sound like the current political administration under Joe Biden is supporting you at all.
Kinda seems like a far stretch from a accident when everything he owned was in there the day of the big fire seems like a insurance claim scam if I ever saw one js
I am so sorry for your friends loss of their farm equipment. So sad
😢
Ouch. It’s a huge loss for your neighbour.
God Bless The Farmers. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Probably a very loaded and dumb question.  Why wouldn't insurance cover the full cost of his equipment?  I assume perhaps it's simply the fact that getting a policy that truly covers the full cost is insanely expensive?
Yes, this sucks. Went through this 2 years ago and the values of the equipment insured didn't come close to the replacement value. Good job for the efforts you have started here.
I can hear the appraiser now, well we gotta depreciate that S670 to 45k
All my best wishes.   Just one question why don’t you get sprinklers in their.   With millions of dollars you should have sprinklers.
Before you even said the cause of the fire that's exactly what I was thinking was a battery cable that arced out on the frame. It's another good reason to put disconnects on everything because it's unfused constant power otherwise.
The most important thing is nobody got physically and thats a gift.  Hope we het his stuff replaced
you have really a pure heart
That's a lesson for others too, not to stack too much under the one roof. Too trusting in God perhaps to be realistic. Also automatic sprinklers in the roof could make a difference.
Not to take away from the video but what is with the bulge by the tire bead over your shoulder at around the 11:30 mark?
What is the point of insurance then. It's disgusting to pay the money and not get anything
Aluminium Melting point 1,221°F 660.3°C
Just came across your channel. Most fires are started from electrical. If people have a lot of equipment in 1 space might want to disconnect the batteries on the equipment. I know it would be a pain but with the batteries disconnected there's no way for wires/electrical to overheat. I have a neighbor that lost his shed to a fire. Absolutely nothing compared to Mike's but my neighbor's shed caught fire cause an extension cord that overheated. The worst part of my neighbor's fire was we live right across the street from the fire department & it still took them around 45 minutes to respond & by the time they did the shed was already fully engulfed in flames & a total loss. He just got done building it a few months prior. Luckily no one was hurt though.
Donated. Best wishes from Germany.
Which country...which area
Thank you for sharing
You need to call farm rescue to come out and help
You two are the best .!!  Thank you for sharing.
Get the batteries disconnected if you have to store them in side  and not just the disconnect switch but the grounds. All this new stuff has voltage draw to the computer source of many fires  not trying to be a jerk just be careful what you store inside a battery short prouduces  flammable poison gas that’s what burns down shops
That’s why my grappa😮😅 George would never let us store equipment in a building the paint may have been faded but never did we  have a fire
Ciao che dispiacere vedere il disastro del tuo parco macchine. Spero tu sia assicurato x tutto questo.
I heard about that. We don't live far from Juniata.
What country is this in
Must be Oprahs space laser that was the culprit.
strange  still electric wires and oil lines n the machines
I'm sorry about your friends loss!! My question is why not having a Fire Suppressing unit installed just for this reason. Youz may still have some equipment parts lost but you shouldn't have total loss like this. Should activate automatic call to fire Dept and wake you up with sirens! Please check into this to save yourselves your precious equipment and Lives!!
man, good luck
You guys are absolute heroes for doing this for Mike and his family ❤❤
when i hear how much equipment costs, in any profession. they are not bragging but explaining what it costs to  do your job. 15 years ago i lost a small toolbox out the back of my truck. to replace the tools was 3 grand but i needed  tools to continue to work. so my issue was small compared to this
That's the main thing is good inc. And do you have a sprinkler system in your barns or garage's you can never be to safe never let your gard down things happen for a reason
Fire Spinkler system is well worth the money, when you are dealing with that amount of equipment and money.
Nice
Laura and grant .,, Yill both are so humble  and God be with you and your neighbour Mike
Без слез не взглянешь.
❤❤
Hi Laura and Grant, thank you for bringing this to our home and explaining what it takes to be a farmer in today's world. not many people nowadays understand or appreciate what farmers bring to our table. Please share this Farm rescue page to those who lost their
Is there a link to the go fund me?
👍
God mercy will see him tru
reach out to the farm rescue foundation!
Good
Good work
Thank you, Laura and Grant for bringing Mike's loss to our attention.  My prayers are with him and his family
can you help me buy million dollar farm equipment too?
👍👍👍
god bless
maybe his grain trucks and trailers can be replaced , im thinking  of but cratching for nearby aid to make from.
This hurts my acricultural machinery heart. What a demonstration of the power from a hellfire. I hope that Mike gets money from the insurance and much  helping hands from his friends and neighbours to rebuild the infrasrtructure and to harvest his plants. I hope nobody was hurted by the fire. The machinery stuff can be replaced.
Gracias por compartir vuestro dolor. Muy buen mensaje!!!
THANK YOU for this compassionate message.  please keep us inforned
We lost our 5th generation dairy barn built in 1857 held 100 cows all maple beams burnt-out night before we buried my grandma it's sad 😔.  Sorry for your loss hopefully you can rebuild.
There sure have been a lot of building fires on YouTube channels lately.  sorry for your loss.
I am just saying...Fire Protection goes a long way in saving LIVES and property. The amount of the sprinkler system is a fraction of the costs to replace all of the equipment. May God be with him and I hope he recovers from the disaster.
If your smart, you would check the battery cables  on all your machines...... and maybe find separate buildings to house them.
That was very scary are you ok
This is horrible, I hate seeing this happen.  This is the reason why we always unhook our negative battery cable when parking our tractors in the building.
Laura this is sad,may God be with Michael,my name is Khaya Goba from South Africa,I hope things will come right again,don't give up Michael,I wish all farmers could support you when harvesting 😢
very set 😢😢
very bad
👍
Tragic Story  told with such care and sympathy. I hope your friend Mike can  recover.
You very nice ❤❤❤❤ love
Well done Laura and Grant to help Mike and his family. Has anybody contacted the Farm Rescue Organization to find out what they could offer?

Great content
aluminum just melt likr syrup.
😢😢😢
😢😢😢
Reconstruct new home
the money should be nothing - they will get it from something what is called insurance.... if they were not insured - their problem. millenial farmer is helping at a similar problem
Get farm rescue to help
😢
Set up a go fund me and ill give what i can
sad
hope   you  are  all  right
Should donate it, it's just materialistic stuff, I'd donate it, money isn't anything!!
Ya could donate one of those tractors to that farmer with love!!!
Pray about it, that's just materialistic stuff,thank the Lord that they are ok and alive.
I would assume that all the farmers there in the area would pitch in to help this poor guy,insurance should cover most of damages.
I hope that Mike will manage to replace all of the equipment he has unfortunately lost,  Yes it’s going to take time to replace everything, but he has an awesome farming community around him, rather like an extended family, that will always be there to support him and always be there to help out with lending any equipment that you can till he manages to get back his own,  That is what farmers do for each other, yes you all want to make your farming business grow and have something to pass on to the next generation farmers in your own families, but you are not a competitor against each other, like many other businesses are,  The Farming & Agricultural industry is an awesome business to be involved with, where everyone comes together to make things work,  👨🏻‍🌾   👩🏼‍🌾👨🏼‍🌾🧑🏼‍🌾     🤝🏻
Omg 😮 hope your  all safe and well  Laura
Horrible loss! We need to learn more about the cause and how to prevent this from happening!  Turn this tragedy into a learning experience. If this knowledge prevents just one incident its worth it.
That is awful
Very sad to here of this. I lost a home in 99 to fire insurance never covers it all. Biggest loss to us was pictures and family heirlooms  not replaceable. Everything here is replaceable just so costly today. We have a farm nirth of us thatcwas totally drstroyed by tornado twice. He rebuilt it both times. You must keep going.
I can't imagine the pain of the loss. One of the tool boxes are something I could only dream of having not to imagine the big machines that are burnt. I know the pain of losing tools I woke up once to go to the shop to find out it was broken into with 90% of my tools gone.
Oh no so sad.  Love and prayers for answers ànd help
I’m really sorry for the family loss. Hopefully someone will be able to come up with a sprinkler system and alarm system for shops and that way the owners could be alerted before it’s a life changing event.
With Prayer. May God protect you. Did someone set your garage on fire because it looks like arson to me. My uncle's neighbors set fire to bales of straw. Neighbors - young boys but not caught red-handed.
Keep doing what you doing 🇺🇸
Yes people never put everything you own in one spot
I wish i could but I am only 13 but our thoughts and prayers with that family
This is So Tragic. You can see the sadness in Laura... Like it happened to her.... the farming community without a doubt is a very tight brotherhood. Let's all get behind this effort to get the farm back on its feet.
Looking from Sweden 👍🚜
As a farmer from Juniata, thanks for swinging by my neck of the woods!  And thank you even more for wanting to help Mike out!
When will the sprinkler system and smoke detectors be installed?
Good
Praying for Mike. I hope some good news comes his way soon.
ciao cara laura mi dispiace tantissimo  per  la tua azienda   spero   che  avevi l'assicurazione    cosi   ti rimorsa   che  brutta notizia
Pozdrav Laura od ❤ mi je žao što Vam se dogodila takva nesreća nadam se da ste cijela obitelj dobro, zdravlje je najbitnije, nadam se da ćete se oporaviti i dalje nas oduševljavati svoim objavama pozz i sretno.
I hope he has contacted Farm Rescue. Millenial Farmer has profiled that group.
YAH MY AUTO MACHINE SHOP BURNT DOWN ALSO,   HAD INSURANCE ON IT FOR FORTY YEARS WHEN MY MOTHER PASSED MY SISTER CANCELLED THE PLAN, WHICH I WASN'T NOTIFIED, EN TWO MONTHS LATER IT BURNT DOWN, TOTAL LOSE,  TALKING BOUT SICK,,
it is sad and one of  are 9r combine started one fire in the field at night
My heart goes out to you all. For what it is worth, I have a 5055 in Alabama I can lend you.
That’s why its super important if you can split equipment and only work on one big piece at a time in the big shop. Cold storage is always cheaper then replacing everything if one building with everything in goes down.
I haven't read through the comments yet but has anyone suggested Farm Rescue organization? It helps farmers with everything from planting to harvest. I'd suggest connecting with them if you need equipment ASAP.
Fire suppression system  should be installed in every building that has expensive equipment , beside it saves lives as well. Better be save than sorry.
14:20 and looking up I don`t see a single sprinkler head to protect all that equipment.  our equipment cost millions of dollars and we would never not protect their inside parking area without some kind of firefighting equipment.
I doubt you bought all that equipment totally paid off. Your financiers I’m pretty sure require you to insure it all with them also on the policy.
Farming is a business that lots of money passes through and if your lucky a small amount stays.  Nothing to burn on a mower?  How about all the lubrication, what ever plant material is under the mowing deck?
Very good
My heart goes out to him poor guy
Nice
I know solutions like this are also expensive, but in comparison to the cost of the farm equipment, and potential interruption in lively hood...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Aoc4ffXlRA or a good commercial water sprinkler system.
Poor guy!!
Sorry for the loss Mike!   You will make it through!   For non farmers to help put the money of farming in context. . . . .there is an old farmer joke:  "Want to become a millionaire farming? "    "Start with a billion dollars and go into farming."   Everything costs in farming, for relatively low margins on the income.  Crops can fail regardless of the money and effort already put into it (seed, fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, etc).   A loss like this can be the end of the line for a farm.
Did the building have a sprinkler system?
This makes my Heart hurt for all Good Hearted Farming Families  ....i grew up on my Dad's Dad Farm and yeah it is a tough Life being a Farmer...let alone losing a Crop due to weather event  ...loosing Farm Equipment and Personal vehicles is just heart wrenching...albeit Tornado or Fire or Flood
Sorry to see this happen to a young couple....hope you had insurance.
🙏🙏🙏
Contact Farm Rescue they would probably be happy to help him out!
Laura, maybe you can contact the people that loan you trackors and other equipment that could Help???
if the insurance does not cover? what do we need insurance for🤔. take care of your stuff/ house etc. and put it away instead. why should you pay for a convenience. that some others should be paid by and also the company.
Thank you providing this video. I am firefighter and I have been at more calls when people have lost everything. People like you being there to help afterwards help the people get back to normal. I can't help financially a lot but i did donate all I could. Thank you for being great people both you and Grant.
is why you should have a sprinkler system
Does he want to stop farming??
Excuse me, tractor tires exploded? What were they pumped with? Methane?
You are really Good People.... Americans don't think about where we would be without you... Our Family salutes you all... God Bless
God bless this man
😢😢😢😢😢
Omg, that is so terrible. Seeing that everything destroyed and the only thing that may be salvageable would be the weights of the tractor..oh wow. That a fire burns so hot that steel buckles is really rare. It is not even for farmers, it is for everyone...big Maschine shop burning  down often is the end of the business, and the more custom and specialized your production is, it gets even worse. I was in a company owned fire department and one sentence was so dominant "the only way to make sure everyone is keeping their jobs is preventing that  the company is burning down" . Even a singe family home burning down can be the loss of a million bucks (demo, waste disposal, rebuild...plus rebuying everything)

Hi buenas! I have put that I don't like it, referring to the fact that no one likes it, that these things happen, there is much invested in machines and all the effort made until now, it falls from the hands, and the soul... but when do you you fall, you have to make the effort to get back up, and with more force, and fight for everything you want, with your husband... cordial greetings, and a hug to each one 🙅🏻‍♂️🙅🏻‍♂️
your's caring for others  so great  👍
So sad!!! I hope they are able to rebuild/recover from this tragedy.
grant, please practice how to pronounce Aluminum.
so sad
Thank you  laura
Hi
Learn from your generations BEFORE you buy expensive equipment. Build a building away from the other. Priority #1….Redundancy…. I am not a farmer, but dated one from Iowa.  They always parked in different buildings for this reason.  Like I said, not a farmer here and live in a large city, but I have redundancy in SO many different levels if things would run a muck.
Heartbreaking 😢
Hopefully  the community  pull together  and help Mike get his harvest  in   understanding  you all have your own issues  to deal with   but many hands  make light load  and surety  all will be blessed when helping  a neighbor   never who next need helping  hand   don't wait for Mike to ask as many pride filled  en won't ask
Это ужасно 😢.
Not to make light  of the terrible tragedy  of the fire and loss of Fram equipment    but can't help but think of putting  all the eggs in one basket    Maybe this be am example  of not keeping  everything  under same roof     there a lot to be said for lean to   for  Keeping  equipment  out ot weather
I just subscribed and liked to give you my support
It would be nice if John Deere stepped up and helped him out
Wow, that hurts just looking at it. Thanks or posting this so the superficial internet can have a better grasp of reality.  I cant tell you how many times I have recommended alarms and fire suppression over the years only to be laughed at followed by "how am I supposed to pay for it?"  It only takes one time to be completely wiped out.  Most insurance will not fill the "what if" void.  Its up to the farmer to protect their livelihood.   Prayers are with you all.
Sad story! I hope he can get back on his feet!
Congratulations
It's his livelihood
#colethecornstar #cornstarfarms
I think #Mrbeast should help a real person
Please install a sprinkler system in your building and in his new building!  And please install wifi-enabled smoke detectors with alarms in the house!
Laura you should start a GoFundMe for him, it hurts just seeing the destruction
what a disaster to see your working tool go up in smoke! all my moral support to your friends. so that they can continue to work. Sincere friendships
Why doesn’t insurance cover this? I’m dead serious Laura my neighbor here in the Netherlands had his complete farm burned down and had it rebuild, why is this not covered by insurance? If not then what’s insurance for at all!
I am so sorry to hear this  I can see how emotional you are but just remember, nobody got hurt and Equipment and buildings can be rebuilt
Espero que o poprietario tenha seguro ,pois o prejuizo foi Grande.  🇧🇷
That sucks been down that road hopefully everything goes well with the insurance company
Blessings for Mike and all of you helping him
contact farm rescue they help tons of farms
Praying for Mike and his family.  Many thanks to your content, teaching, sharing and provisions you provide to our nation.
Farm rescue is a great group of people that will harvest fields for farmers
Maybe you guys should put smoke detectors in shops and sheds! They make some nice wireless ones that are connected to a panel box with a dialer! That way you can program it to call any phone number you wish or also connect it to a loudspeaker when any detector is triggered! You might be able to catch it before it gets out of control! This would be a personal alarm system!  Not a system controlled by a alarm company!
Laura - this is so sad to see,  In watching this and looking at your building makes me wonder - do they make fire suppressant systems for those type of buildings?  If they do I know it will be expensive to install, but the cost must pale i comparison to the financial loss of a fire.  Maybe something you and Grant might want to look into.  Love the videos.  Take care.
Is it feasible to put sprinkle systems in builders you store equipment?
I know it expensive but insurance, fire detection and extinguishers on everything and at every door. Better to get false alarms from dust than to be woken up by tires exploding.
👍
I hope is abul to rebuild and recovery from this
bet the dodge is where the fire started
Imagine that , a John Deere started the fire I can not believe people still buy this garbage ,just look at the result .I would never buy a Deere and can  not believe this company is still in business . People install a battery switch on ALL equipment ,I even have them on all my cars and trucks.
No insurance?
The fire was too pathetic. It causes a great financial loss to you. I will pray to God your loss will recover soon. Lot's of love to you from India.
😭😭
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤hi Dr
i see this all the time people think it takes along time for a building to burn but it can be a total loss in the matter of minutes . sorry for his loss . but keep a check on him as he will go through stages and thay are tough
desde cadiz españa animo
hola familia un abrazo muy grade y lo siento mucho
Glad nobody got hurt. Things can be replaced, people can't. Keep family and friends close, let help, because that's what they are for! I helped on my grandpa's farm growing up and I just got a taste of the work, getting up at daylight & work after dark. I am sorry about what happened. I don't begin to know what it is like to go Thu a lost like that. I would not be afraid to ask for help because you have a long way to go. Be strong and keep your family close. Keep God closer! 👍👍
Laura, maybe consider installing a sprinkler system in yours and Grant's buildings for just this kind of situation. My house was built with a sprinkler system installed in the garage area. Consider it for your buildings.
Sending prayers for him and all his family🙏
Is it possible (or reasonable) to add some kind of a fire suppression system to that building?
Where can I find the go fund me link?
man my heart goes out to him. there was a farmer here and i am good friends with him him and his dad were in debt and already struggling some then his barn burnt to the ground with absolutely everything and ruined his life nothing was saved and he lost everything except his car
Where do I find the Go fundme site???
I wish the best to this farmer and his family.   That hurt to watch .
Laura I'm not sure if you have seen the Is millennial farmer but he shows an organization which helps farmers in these type of situations ...
I was wondering about how you get to the point to afford that amount of equipment and it's built on generations of work and investment in the farm.  I can't imagine going out and trying to start a farm from scratch with all the costs involved just to begin farming with no guarantee you will succeed .
Even if it's not yours , it still hurts to see someone lose the tools they rely on for their livelihood .  I pray he is able to recover .  We need more farmers , not fewer so we don't want anyone to have to give up their dreams because of destruction like this  .
Might be a good opportunity to pivot into something else. I know it’s hard to imagine though.
most people think farmers have 1 farmall H tractor and a 1950s pickup truck like they show in old cartoons and they produce all of our food with them.  this shows the risk of putting all your eggs in one basket. a local town had all their snowplows and trucks burn up a few years ago because they kept everything in one barn and I have seen other farmers do the same thing and have lost all their equipment. rain and sun wont ruin your machines like fire will did they say what started this fire?
Bloke what caused it
I grew up on a farm in the south. My dad absolutely loved what he did, but it was hard, sometimes heartbreaking work. Small farmers do not choose the farm life in order to get rich. They do it because they love it. May God's blessings flow over this family as they recover from this tragedy.
Seeing this make me realize just how lucky we are as my family had a near similar ordeal when a battery meted on one of our tractors that was parked in a shop. We were extremely lucky that the tractor somehow suffocated that fire, considering the batteries sit right under the fuel tank on that tractor.
I call it insurance fraud

V sad  moment
The cost of farming is almost unbelievable today. One of my extended family and my goals is to start a small multi-generational family farm. We've all pitched in in various ways, land, equipment, implements, tools, shops and buildings and I can't tell you how difficult and expensive it is to start from scratch. However, I know you and Grant understand. We're still years away from our first planting on our small market-garden farm, but we're sacrificing and saving towards our goal every month. Compared to our efforts, I can't imagine Mike's loss. A half million dollars out of pocket is no small potatoes (pun intended  :-)  ). I only wish I could add a few more zeros to our donation.
We need farmers
I hope you guys, dont have the same insurance company..... And I dont like your husband in this video. Hes doing bigballs, See what we have, and what we have over here. Glad that I watched  the end of the video, other wise I had donated. I really hate him right now. Dont be a  tough show guy (echoist)
Farm Rescue helps with harvests
That would be difficult to come back from to say the least nevermind the crop.
Have you considered installing a HI-Fog fire suppression system in the machinery shed? That and fire alarms might be as good an investment as a new piece of machinery.
I wish I had any money to help sorry I can't I hope for the best of luck for him
Need to put a disconnect switch on the negative cable between the battery the frame.
Have him reach out to Farm Rescue they help out with stuff like that.
Laura and Grant, thank you for sharing. My heart and love goes out to Mike, his family and for his loss. I have donated what I can afford (only a modest amount) but please could I politely ask every one of your subscribers to consider doing the same, if they are financially able. Even if it's only $1 it will all add up and make a massive difference. ❤
Contact the Farm Rescue organization
You don't need to explain yourself.  Your blessed but your fathers and grandfathers worked hard for decades to help get you where your at.  Generational weath should be the norm not the exception.
Sorry for the loss but you sure are beautiful though
I know what you are going through but NOT TO THE EXTENT that you are. In March of this year my F-250 Heavy Duty 4 X 4 caught fire and was a total loss! Taking inventory on just the items in the truck alone was a daunting task. I was devastated! Coincidentally, the investigators thought it was the battery that started the truck fire!!!  It took MONTHS to gather everything required from the insurance company, and since the house also was damaged from the fire I had to file TWO CLAIMS and of course TWO DEDUCTIBLES! Even though insurance covered my contents in the truck, and the house damage was paid for, I really got screwed on my 2015 truck because of the value placed on it. The insurance company did not give fair value on my camper shell, new tires and new battery, nor reimbursement for a new chip module.  I took a $25,000 loss on my truck. So I cannot even IMAGINE what it will entail to recover what you have loss.
I'm very sorry for you and your husband's friend Mike. You talk about insurance, you have to make sure your agent is keeping on top of your needs. It's not always on your daily plan. Try and make it so.😢
Well won’t need to worry about ford recalls anymore !!!
I hope that it was a big storm at least lol
This looks horrible. And horribly familiar. I recently lost an old building full of all kinds of stuff. Tools and small equipment. Fortunately no essential machines. I never want that experience again!
Sorry to hear about this. Do you & Grant have pictures & serial numbers of ALL OF YOUR EQUIPMENT? Hopefully you’ll never have a devastating fire like this. Good luck
I hope he has neighbors to help and volunteer to help get his crops out and frowns reworked and ready for the next year.
Thanks for sharing their sad story. Our prayers go out to them
Hi Guys, it was not until I took an industrial welding course that I was aler. It couldted and inculcated with the need to quit work and clean up 15 minutes before  quitting time and quietly look listen and sniff for any signs of heating, leaking, creaking to be sure all is well before leaving.  I once borrowed a neighbours tractor to run a PTO manure pump. Set it up and left it running while I checked on another pump. Meanwhile the neighbours tractor caught fire. A wire had melted and shorted due to heat of transmission and melted a plastic fuel line and away it went. I had a fire extinguisher so it only burned the cab!
I’m not being negative but who puts everything in one place
You talked about Equipment.... But add in the the cost of a new Barn!!!  For the Size of a new Barn like You have with Cement & Electric would be pushing 100 Grand... Those of You folks that havent went thru your insurance since the 2020 Pandemic may want to up your replacement costs!!! Ya'll remember the price of lumber during that time !!!  It hasnt dropped that much since that time. I guess what im saying is ... that Pole Barn/Shop that cost you 50 grand 10 years ago.... May Cost You 75-100 Grand today to rebuild. 20 minutes today may save ya 50/75 grand tomorrow!!!  And for ANY future Loans that you get be it thru a Bank or Credit Union for Gods sake get Credit Life & Credit Disabilty on them.. "Hear Me Now ... Remember Me Later" Im glad I did!!!
Hi Laura and Grant, thank you for bringing this to our home and explaining what it takes to be a farmer in today's world. not many people nowadays understand or appreciate what farmers bring to our table. Please share this Farm rescue page to those who lost their farm for assistance in harvesting this year's crop And possibly next springs planting season. I hope your Neighbor will rebuild his farm and continue his passion. Please let your neighbors know that many Americans and people across the world are praying for them. Stay strong and God bless the American farmer! Thanks again for sharing this and bringing it to our attention.
As you say the value of your tractors I'm thinking they could be in separate buildings or outside. It's like having all the eggs in one basket. Would you consider storing the equipment in separate areas? I also don't like to see people store tractors and equipment in the same barn as hay. I'm sad for his loss, but also think there are lessons to be learned from this and other tragedies.(both for him and others) Glad he had insurance.
Any type of fire suppression would work in the building?
Sorry for the lose   To me it sounds like arson. By some one that didn't like him  or doesn't like farming.. I say this cause how does a metal building with a concrete floor keep a fire going that hot.. Unless it was an electrical fire next to flammables.   It just makes no sense to me how one little area could keep going that hot through a shop that big..  I'm so very sorry about this farmers situation
Expensive is an understatement. That cant be potrayed enough to non farmers. We had this same thinf happen last year. But not to this extent
I hope you guys go and install battery disconnects on all your machinery
Any idea @Laura Farms how the fire started? I grew up on a farm and fully understand the devastation a fire can cause!   I now work in an industry where procedure & validation is everything…but it has made me fully appreciate safety & fire safety, which in turn has made me realised how much fire safety is NOT applied on farms.  Fire & Safety awareness needs to be promoted & developed on farms to an industrial standard….with this in mind I now work with neighbouring farms to try develop work practises and procedures that make fire awareness a second nature, sharing my experience & skillset to help prevent disasters like your neighbour’s fiasco. Very often these practices are simple steps around good housekeeping& maintenance
To bad they did not use Christian, Give Send Go.  Go Fund Me attacked the Freedom Convoys.
Speak up can’t hear you ‼️‼️
man, that is heartbreaking... I don't know how you kept it together... I did fire damage reconstruction for 20 years, and it never got easier meeting families on one of their worst days of their lives... and thanks for walking through your barn and educating folks on the costs of things... for sure a devastating loss for Mike...  praying for him and praying for the 555 lost souls that disliked this video as of this comment... I don't know how someone could do that... Be Blessed you guys!
Laura Battery Disconnects on ALL YOUR IRON!
Going to see what we can do up here in Ontario Canada 🇨🇦 sharing with our local Agricultural Development Association and a couple of radio stations.
Has he reached out to Farm Rescue?  Millennial Farmer did a video about them recently for a family that lost everything to a tornado.
How do this
another reason to use battery disconnects on equipment, just like heavy equipment does.. hope he can come back from this.
Hopefully farm rescue could help with harvest
Go Fund me take a large percentage of money raised. Have him set up an Venmo and advertise that. We did that when we lost a brother firefighter and the family benefited much better then off go fund me!
Thank you so much again for using your platform to spread this news. I am praying that there be enough donations to help him out of this nightmare and get him back up on his feet.
August 4th at 16:51 I went on a call and it was a 3 year old barn with a metal roof and it took us 4 hours to put it out and it had a newer tractor a brand new zero turn a brush hog a snowblower and a backhoe attachment for the tractor and it all burnt up but we saved the house that was within 30-40’ away and it was getting hot but we saved it
Might be a good investment in a fire sprinkler system set a 15 to 20 k gal  tank  ,fire pump , at least that would keep the fire small , If  I had that much money invested in stuff like that , a fire system would be pocket change  compared to what could be lost.
Thank you for sharing this story. I could hear the sadness in your voice, laura. It's a devastating.
First thought was rechargeable batteries, then at 8:20 min turns out BATTERY CABLES? #Dad always said, *Those Batteries need a consistent checkin' for good measure.* ✅ 👍Shared on my TRUTH Social✌  🙏prayers for financial support & restoration in Jesus name, amen.  God speed.
Fahahak! Wish him the best and hope he can quickly to recover. Sad to hear that the ensurence felt like they couldn't help.
Ohhh noo😢
thank u Laura and Grant for bringing Mike's loss to our attention.  My prayers are with him and his family.
Probably be a good idea to install a sprinkler system in your barns Laura.
And the crapping insurance companies never give you replacement costs even though you are led to believe you have sufficient coverage.
small fire cant melt steel because iron melting point is 1400 celcius
WOW.
what caused the fire
This is why I'm a firefighter to try and be able to help people on their worst day and hopefully prevent it from being this bad.  Everyone please pay for a security system they help stop fires more than you think.  Simply safe is amazing in my opinion
40 years ago the man who did all the combine work for my Uncle's farm, who lived a couple miles from us, woke up to the sound of his brand new JD combine running. It was locked in the shed and certainly should not have been! The thing started on its own due to a cable shorting out. All the cables were completely fried and the building was filled with smoke. Fortunately he was able to close a fuel valve to stop it and extinguish the wiring fire. JD repaired the machine as it was a wiring fault that started the fire.  It would not have taken much more time for the combine, the shed, and everything else in it to look just like Mike's.  During the few years I worked on that farm I can remember four buildings that burned flat, one with all the animals in it lost.  Farm buildings and their contents are almost universally flammable!
Outstanding contribution to his loss, well done
People don’t have insurance? Would think that would cover some of it. Instead of getting greedy?
Wow what a loss.. people don't realize how much it takes to farm..I hope your video makes everyone think about what they have and what you can loose in minutes...you guys keep up the good videos...Scott
So glad everyone’s OK I just recently lost $100,000 excavator to fire that my son was driving so glad nobody got hurt and yes update your insurance yearly so thankful I kept that updated
My heart goes out to all of the owners. ❤️
Don’t have your home in the same building as your shop 💀
Please pass on this small bit of help, wish I could do more.
Grant and you are absolutely Awesome.!!!
This is so sad to look at.  My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.  I hope he can replace everything and be able to carry on farming.
No cctv of it happening  where did it start from
How much stuff went up over 1 .5 million  and this is why u never put all your ego on the same basket  never leave everything under 1 roof wood frame n all  see in uk we have laws for all this to stop it from happening
Hello Laura and Grant, I am so very sorry to hear about your friend and neighbour,  I really hope that all goes really well for him and your very good selves.
Thank you for your hard work.   Hope everything comes around for you. Sorry for the loss
That actually made me feel physically ill. I'm not a farmer, but i'm well aware of the value of a the equipment in a (burned) workshop.   I've donated a few hundred dollars towards Mikes rebuild of his workshop and equipment. I hope he gets back to business within a short timespan and gets his loss covered by the good people of Laura Farms funding and his insurance.   I hope he pulls thru and gets back in some kind of tractor soon!  Love from Denmark..
Ce dommage pour les tracteur et les matériel agricole et les buqui et le moissonneuse batteuse 😢
Nice
Lithium batteries maybe, if there is enough from the gofundme you could get yourself some larger toys, at least 34b.......................
Buy a new voice, tell him to buy insurance.
If you contact farm rescue  they might be able to help.
It is amazing to watch the GoFundMe response from Laura Farms viewers from around the world.  What a testimony to the respect you and Grant have generated by sharing your love and dedication to your relationship and work.  I do not know if anyone has suggested this but one of your sponsors is Chief industries.  Perhaps a collaboration could be established to have them work with all of you and the contributors to build a new equipment building and have the process documented for the viewers.  Just a thought.
Best of luck to Mike. Hope he recovers soon here. 🙏🏻
I know how that feels, when hurricane Laura came through Lake Charles Louisiana, our headquarters, it wiped out two of our 250’x60’ equipment sheds, both wall to wall full of tractors and implements. ZERO INSURANCE on any of it.
Não se preocupe querida tudo vai acabar bem  estou orando 🙏 por vc daqui do Brasil
Prayers 🙏🏽❤
That is a mega loss, I hope he gets back on his feet quick.
A fire suppression system would be a good investment. Best wishes for Mike and family.
Why not put fire protection systems in the farm machine sheds to protect the millions of dollars in equipment? Expensive but worth it if and when a fire breaks out
I no another business owner that has recently lost an entire shop and at least 6 trucks and all of their tools ...... it's a bad thing to lose stuff to a fire we pray that you can recover from this God bless
So sorry for his loss. Past The hat thank you for the go fun me info
Laura I’m 76 and opened my eyes on insurance.thank you for what you are doing.😊
Thoughts and Prayers to this Family ~
is it not an idear now for your future to invest inside a fire sprinkler system inside the shop ?
A lot of fires in the youtube garages lately
Such a tragedy!
Heartbreaking.
Well, as my identity on EweChube would suggest, I’m an Aussie. My work is based entirely around farming as I cart (mostly) grain, fertiliser, gypsum and suchlike on and off farm. Now, I’m just a company driver so I don’t have a whole lot of surplus income, but I donated as much as I could in the hope it encourages others around the world to chip in as well.  The simple fact is, even if they get millions through this means (which they won’t) even sourcing the necessary equipment IN A TIMELY MANNER will be next to impossible. Congrats to you and Grant for your efforts.  Kindest regards  Indy.
Farm Rescue? Zach Johnson
Things for all to consider.  Annual review for insurance levels, due to inflation.  Get replacement cost if you can.  Fire alarm your shop buildings.  Fire suppression system if affordable.  Fire doors between sections of the building where possible.  Fire resistant storage of combustibles.  Additional buildings for separation of equipment to reduce total loss of all equipment in one building.
So sorry to hear the news. As an ex farmer, I know how capital intensive the industry is. I never had large equipment but what I had was stored in three separate sites. Particularly the items used for only a few days in the year were put well away and stored separately. I hope Mike recovers from this set back, there is always another day. 😅
Thank you for taking the time on your platform to share a cause like this. The more comments, likes and shares of this video will help out!
Get ahold of Zach Johnson and the farm rescue program.
Just to think we all have a lot of machines under one shed.... Insurance or no insurance fires hurt....
This is the second video I've seen of hers that someone lost their stuff from a fire, the first one they suspected was arson, did they ever catch a suspect in that case?)   I don't keep all my stuff in one place, I got it scattered around.
🤣 Smells like insurance fraud to me..Pretty dumb to have that many vehicles and equipment in one spot....Prove me wrong.
I hope he is able to recover from this.   Thanks Laura for share this with us.
how come so stupid not moving out all those tractors ??
What a terrible situation, as a farmer myself I can fully understand, I do fear fire myself and try to keep things well insured but insurance costs have got so dear it's hard to get the balance right of what you need to pay and can afford in premiums.  Good on Laura and Grant for trying to help, as a Brit I think American farmers are among the best at helping eachother out in a time of crisis, Farm Rescue would be a good first start, as they do great work.  One thing I do notice which is different is the use of wood in big farm sheds, in the UK it would be a steel portal frame design with metal z purlins.  Obviously there was insulation also in the construction so I don't know if that was just fire resistant or fireproof ??  I'm not saying the fire wouldn't have happened I just wonder if it might not have been so severe ??
I shared this on my Facebook page.  All I know to do. Except 🙏🏻.
Very weird that his insurance doesn’t cover this damage something is strange, I am farmer in France and when this happen the insurance does so why it’s not possible in America ?
You are very good  neighbours  to highlight  this farmers   misfortune  remberr some years ago my hay barn was set alight either deliberately  unlikely. Got nil help fro any neighbours  as I live close to a village  eventhough  one would think the opposite  in ireland luckily I didn't have any livestock  in that she'd...Never Never store all your machinery in one shed  build the shed 300 meters from each other n 3 or different  areas
I really love your Content
Sprinkler system? Is that possible? $1 from each viewer would reach and exceed the GoFundMe goal.
Awesome
I'm sorry for your loss I work at John Deere here in Dauphin Manitoba Canada as a heavy duty diesel mechanic I've been watching Millennial Farmers always sponsoring Farm Rescue have you guys try to get in contact with Farm Rescue maybe they can help you with this Harvest
Has Farm Rescue been contacted? At bare minimum, they'll be able to help get harvest in...
God bless the producer recover soon.
My thoughts and prayers are with ur neighbors friend and family , I know that they will recover from this tragic loss from fire ....
Very sorry here about your friend farm from McBee SC
Thank you Laura and Grant. So sorry for Mike and his family. I hope that Mike is able to recover and continue to farm.
❤
I hope he is able to rebuild and recover from this. What a loss, my prayers go out to him..
uhhmmm laura if his insurance wont cover the whole loss than hes the idiot!! its called a blanket policy!! stop lying to the ppl he can afford it! he will be just fine!!!
It probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to contact farm rescue and see if they can help
That’s so sad. If everyone who watched this video donated just $1 we could really help this poor farmer out. So let’s get donating  so donate a$1 or if your able then donate what ever you feel compelled or comfortable donating.
Reach out to Millenial farmer here on youtube he is part of an awesome group of farmers who help farmers in need
Tambien el mantenimiento i la calidad del Material influyen...
Everyone should think of the cost and consider fire sprinkler and alarm systems for any garage or shop.
Scary thing. I hope he can recover, and I KNOW that his neighbors will help as much as they can. With harvest coming up, at least prices are stable and fairly good.🙏
You all better start waking up these types of fires aren't normal> Something is going on here and farmers are under attack
Aluminum begins to melt at 1,220° F.
Could you please direct me to the go fund me page for this family
We can all share this video with our group of friends. Hopefully, they'll understand and contribute. It's posted on my feed.
What a sad story. All I can do is raise the family up in prayer, an hopefully those who can afford to help will step up and do so. Thanks for sharing the story 🤠.
Nice
Keep up the good work!
I hate seeing farm fires or even equipment fires! You guys work extremely hard to feed humans and animals.  People think stuff magically appears on the shelf. Without farmers and truckers, we would be naked and homeless.😊
You see this is what it is to be "Small Town".  I grew up in a small little village of 1000 people and when one family suffered the whole community rallied and helped get them back on their feet.  Oh and farmers are some of the most resourceful least wasteful people I know.  They are a fix it yourself, if it's replaced it's because it really isn't repairable anymore.  Equipment is really stupid expensive and the new stuff a lot of the time comes with maintenance agreements the remove the right to repair from farmers.  Which means dealer repairs, transportation costs... just HUGE amounts of increase in cost.  Generational equipment from years gone bye if they can keep it running they often will.  Yet most farmers are in the same boat so finding good used equipment is almost impossible.
So sad
So Sorry ...
This is long but worth the read.     Here in indiana we had a farmer killed in an auto accident 2 weeks before harvest of about 1500 acres corn and beans on several different farms and locations was to start. Now understand that his or a lot of other farmers dont have near the size of operation you guys have but everybody that knew him and the retired farmers that he rented ground from turned out to help with the harvest. Other farmers that he didn't rent off of brought their equipment in and used it at no charge asking only fuel and food. Even his wife that didn't normally have too much of a hand in the operations learned to record the wagons and grain in the bins. She  also made sure the equipment windows were clean every night, proving there is something to help with no matter how trivial.   NOW Heres the kicker.....EVERYBODY got their and his crops in within about 30 days with only one breakdown which was a sheared pin   on the unload  augar on the last load to be unloaded. Some of it went directly to market and the grain company worked with his estate to facilitate that.   The best thing that happened out of this is at the end we all had a big celebration party in his garage with plenty of good food and stories swapped between "crews" as some of them didnt see each other during that harvest time. And the brst gift of all that his wife gave everyone was a clear Christmas ornament ball filled with half beans and corn from that harvest.  That ment more to a lot of us than anyone can imagine.      Is it possible that the this guy's neighbors can help out similarly??
That is why a fire suppression system is a must!  With that amount of equipment, I would have invested into a dry fire suppression system!  We have one in our main equipment shed and I don't own nearly the expensive equipment as this guy!
Why didn't you keep the focus of this video on the farmer who lost everything? Looking at what you have has nothing to do with the reason you made this video
I don't understand the insurance company thinking, you pay and pay for years you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars with them. Then they have the nerve to tell you SORRY WERE NOT COVERING ALL OF IT. Why do we have in surance, it's just legalized robbery.
Those of us who run small, non farming businesses can definitely understand the loss.  Hopefully they get back on their feet
Yes that is sad to loose everything.....but when you talked about used tractor prices you said they incressed in value what you meant to say was they went up in price if were looking for a 5 year old tractor no value can be added to that because its not new.....the prices went up because of the planed demic and the democrats in charge messing with everything
I know MN Millennial Farmer just took part in some project to help farmer in need. I sent him a link to this video. Not sure if it's something that can help or not.
Check your battery cables. Buy extra insurance. Don't place all your equipment in one place. Learn from him.
Oh no😧 I wish you much power🙏🫶 lovely Greetings from germany❤
Wow, that’s sickening for sure. Not a thing cheap in there.  Poor fella.  Hope he recovers from this. All over a damn battery cable.. WOW
I had a barn fire in 1993 lost everything  put me out of business I know how you feel. My heart goes out to you
Talk to Zack he can probably get farm rescue to hel
May he be blessed 🙏Amen
Masyaallah.. May God reward you with a better sustenance.  amen
recovering from this will take time.
Hello from Park rapids MN. You 2 put a new perspective on what YOUtUBE should be about. Helping others and sorting love to others. Thank you. Oh I wish i we had some extra money, but we are living post check to post check
Good
Good Luck ! 😮
🙏🙏🙏🙏
We had this happen to a family member. It is very devastating and difficult to deal with. Our insurance suggested a yearly insurance audit. The rates do vary but it was worth it when we found our coverage would have only covered a quarter of the value.
We’ll get your check book out I ain’t helpin no one
Sounds like a inside hub insurance scam
I'm so sorry for your loss and I don't wish that on aneyone
I always disconnect the batteries when storing anything in a building just to be safe.
Hi bonjour vraiment bravo et bonne contamination mes salutatiions de l'Algérie
Terrible loss, hope he had insurance.
I hope the Mike has retained a lawyer and is going after the tractor manufacturer that caused the fire. If the insurance company does pay, they probably will in turn sue the tractor manufacture. I don't know how a farmer can eat 500K and survive.  Truth of the matter is there are a number of Mike's out there that do to one travesty, or another find themselves in similar situations. Farming is risky business. Prayers going up for Mike and his family.
The most sad thing about this sort of loss, is that even if you do gather up the money via insurance / help / whatever means possible to "replace" all the gear... Its still not the gear you had before, that you knew inside out, have looked after for years / maybe even from new... It sounds silly but that is un-replaceable, years of hard work allow shed to be full of machinery in excellent condition like that and my heart goes out to these guys. I really hope things work out , and you arnt wrong , farmers are a great group of people, around the world there arnt many that wouldnt drop everything to help another farmer in this sort of need. Best of luck from the UK.
Prayers for Mike and his family. The is so heartbreaking to see.
😪🙏🙏
This is where  people get togeather  (farmers and ranchers)   and others . People this is where we get our food from  one of the farms , our food does not by miracley (no disrespect to God)appear at Walmart mart it.  Takes many hours of hard work to make it happen ,I've seen in my area  millions of dollars of onions having to be plowed under because of the price cost  to harvest is greater then the price for the product.PLEASE HELP THIS MAN  EVEN IN A SMALL WAY  TO GET BACK TO  BEABLE TO HELP FEED AMERICA. THANK YOU TO ALLLL THE FARMERS ,RANCHERS THAT HELP  FEED THIS GRAND COUNTRY AMERICA.
Watching this as an ex fire fighter (and view no 472.340), it makes me sad that "only" 1.600 people sent help to your neighbor. THANK YOU for sharing this, I highly appreciate your help. 👊♥️
Laura and Grant, you guys are just the best. Sent a donation to Mikes go fund me account. I don’t make this a habit sending support but this story felt the need to help out!
So heartbreaking. My dad grew up on a farm and we spent lots of time there. I know well all the big and little things they lost in this fire. Donated with pleasure.
Holy hell! This is so unfortunate. Best of luck on the rebuild Mike. Hoping your community supports this effort to recovery.
YIKES!
Really shows me the importance of having a professionally installed fire alarm system, maybe to even include a sprinkler system when you have that much money in assets to protect. Wow!
Wasn't his equipment covered by his farm insurance ?
Hii I am indian small farmar
Sajnálom ez szörnyű 😢
wow Laura you have many licenses you are very rich much more than Mike congratulations Laura is the result of a lot of work Invest in security Laura I'm sorry about Mike but he was careless sorry
My comment may seem harsh but  Surely there was lack of forthought in packing all of that power equipment in one building.  Any electrical plant can have a short circuit and catch fire.  There is a motto  that states that if something can happen at some stage given the right circumstances  it will happen.!!  a very sad costly mistake.  at least no one was hurt or killed.  lets hope that there was enough insurance cover and that the insurance pays out.
I guess that's why you pay insurance, STUFF only STUFF. Collect you insurance, buy more new John Deere's and away you go.
Nice
Prayers from India🙏
Very expensive. I haul John Deere parts and sometimes whole tractors from their world headquarters in Iowa. Just a "Gator" your talking about 9- 11k. Very expensive.

Sent the most I could at this time not much but hope it will help a little bit
Discussing the value of farm equipment is not bragging. 99.9% of people have zero knowledge of farming, the cost, the work required, and the risk. I worked on a farm in my teenage years and I learned alot. I wish everyone could have a better understanding of it all. I think your channel is helping greatly in that respect xx
Be properly insured.
as of now i am crying my eyes out and also remind me if it was not for this farmer we would not have food help him so we can all have food for our families god bless
Masterpiece Presentation Grant Laura  Regards From Rural New Zealand
It's depressing and horrific even to imagine the years of hard work, persistence your father has put in to  to buy really expensive farm equipment! I hope that you guys would be able to recover from this loss
I farm to and I shed a few tears I know it’s just stuff, but to that certain person it was his life’s work.
Has anyone reached out to farm rescue??
With the high cost of equipment now, low commodity prices, there is no way I could restart from that.
Give me a few days and I’ll donate I just lost my step son  I know how hard it is to loose everything
Be sure to have him get ahold of farm rescue se if they could help with harvest if he can't find machinery.
i can't imagine what they are going through.. my dad ran ranch/farm for so many years - and just can't imagine facing this tragedy.  thoughts and prayers are with all you
How to interpret this video?  (I just have to ask)  I do hope people will support this unfortunate farmer. 🍀
horrible story.
Found the cash button! Yay!
Thanks!
I grew up on my grandpa's and uncle's farm in Illinois and even though I have been away from what I consider my true passion for more than 50 years now, I will never forget how EVERYONE would come to the aid of a fellow farmer when bad things happened. I have been subscribed to your channel a couple of months now (since I found you) and I really appreciate what you are doing to share what being a farmer really is! I've done what little I could to help MIke and that is only possible because you shared his story and from the memories I cherish of my family's farms and living with the principles learned to help each other in so many ways. Those  principles have guided my life even though I am literally thousands of miles from the farms I grew up on and loved so much.  Thank you!!!  I hope you'll keep us updated on Mike!
Great video!
It's absolutely heartbreaking to watch this video God bless and tack care
I am at a loss for words for all of this thankfully, nobody was hurt or died in the fire. Thankful for that. But I am so very sorry that they lost. Basically everything they had in that fire, all their equipment, their cars, their pick ups, and the list goes on is the what they lost. My question is, is there anyway possible you people can put some sort of sprinkler system or fire suppression system in your shops and barns is that any way possible to help protect what you have invested and have them side them? Is that at all possible just wondering?? don’t know what your water system is like there how it set up or anything like that. But I know one thing we all have to be very careful about how we charge batteries nowadays and make sure we take them off the charger at night before we leave our shops will it be our garage at the house or Shop’s at work because his batteries can go sideways on us real quick some unknown reason even radio controlled airplane batteries have gone sideways on me back years ago. How do you special bags? We put them in when we charge them just in case, they decided to go puff the bag was fire proof it would contain it but obviously we can’t contain an electric car when they decide to go sideways when you’re trying to charge them in your garage but anyway pray that everything will come together for your friend and he’ll be able to put everything back together soon good luck and be safe. Be careful.
My heart is broken seeing this. Thank you Laura and Grant for using your platform to help call attention to this situation.   I pray Mike and his family find peace. The only blessing is that no person was harmed physically. But that is little consolation.   Stay safe out there and Stay Gold.
Thank you for sharing. Will definitely consider making a contribution to the fund.

My uncle just lost 1,200 pigs and a Building in a electrical fire a fan caught fire
Heartbreaking story. We love you Laura. You have such a huge heart.
Been through something similar fortunately ours was empty at the time snd that was devastating enough. We were considering  one big building at the time. But that event chg our minds. So my heart goes out to the Schuttie family.
The millennial farmer did a video about farm rescue
i love your videos Laura they are very good you are a very nice girl God bless you and Grant
Please tell me this is insured! <EDIT> OOF - out 500K, painful
It maybe a good idea to video all your equipment for the insurance company. It will take a while to recoup to cost, down time and emotional loss. God bless, be safe and evaluate safety protocols. How long will GoFundMe be up? Like to help but i may have to wait until next week.
well it's a good time to have all ur equipment burn since mexico isn't going to buy any of your gmo corn.
Make sure to keep us upgraded on Mike's situation.
Fire sprinklers would have avoided this loss.
Replacement cost insurance is expensive, but is needed. Especially when you cannot afford delays that cost a seasons crops! I home the farm networks can also help Mike!
Очень рад за вас
He didn't happen to have a ford pickup? Ford has had problems with fires in the past
Fire Suppression! Well worth the small change folks???
The one thing I can add is when you look at a gofundme page remember the company that runs these pages take a large sum of that money so the person you are sending the money to does not get the total amount shown. It is sad but there are not too many other ways to do this. Only had one time we used a gofundme and that was when my grandson died. Now we did not know too many people so we got I think somewhere are $400-$500 dollars to help with those expenses so to then get like $300 in the end after their fees was just a shock.  Please help this farmer out if you are able to
She's fighting back tears, that's compassion..
Oh great now we all starve to death. Tell the government immediately for help. Tell them they will have empty plates for dinner or help now.
I guess the moral of the story should be don't put all your eggs in one basket.
I wish I was close to you guys, I would’ve had my equipment, saddled up and ready to roll. Whatever he needed.
Laura ji no many but I help your farm in my life
Ever heard of something called statutory insurances over there in the poor North America?
It ain’t much, but I donated $50 and shared it on all of my social media. We wouldn’t be here without farmers and I’m proud to be a part of the ag community.
Laura and Grant,   you guys are awesome!!    Sending donation and spreading the word.  Give Mike a big hug,  man it will be ok!  Great people up there.  Love from New Orleans
I'm very sorry my thoughts go out to him and prayers tools and equipment but it can all be replaced as long as no-one was hurt now he's just got to fight with the insurance company it's sad cuz the insurance company will take your premium and then they don't want to pay for what the equipments worth you'll never replace it for what you paid for it just another kick in the old gut that the world gives you
"You'll own nothing and you'll be happy" cit. WEF
Laura, you have more than 450K subscribers. Imagine if each one gave just one dollar. Use your pulpit to get that one dollar, or more, from each subscriber. Keep up the good work.
Ever heard of direct energy weapons? I wouldn't be surprised if this farmer was a no GMO guy....
Insurance fraud?
You are definitely not bragging. You are just explaining the costs of farming.
😔
I had my grandpa’s farm Bert, half of his shop caught on fire
Did he have foam insulation in his shop? Foam insulation if not covered is a large fuel for fires if it is left uncovered. I see a lot of shops with uncovered foam and it is a real fire hazard.
😍
As a person that had a house fire do not put all stuff in one build .I say dont do it
That’s why they sell insurance.
Boo fucking hoo
So sorry for them 😂
This is horrible.  It made me think that I needed Fire Alarm in my shop.  Just bought two for my shop.
My heart sank when I saw this post before playing the video, and although I am thankful that it wasn't your equipment, my heart was still broken for this farmer. I will help if I can. 'Lord, we ask you to comfort this family as this tools to feed his family is now gone. We know You are the great comforter and that you are in control. Please allow us to help encourage this family and help them financially, in Jesus name AMEN." - Chaplain Steve
What a tragic situation. Hope he is on his feet again soon. Do Farmers have fire alarms in their storage facilities? Maybe this would help lessen the risk today.
Thanks Laura & Grant for letting people know
After watching a lot of YouTube videos I can say simply safe would have prevented this with their around the clock monitoring.  All kidding aside farm fires are no joke hopefully they get back what they lost quickly.
Did I miss where they said what started the fire?
I had a fire two years ago and it is a long hard ride
No words. God Bless Them. Looking for The Go Fund Me info.  ❤️🚜❤️🇺🇸
Hey guys how I wish I could help, I don't have money but trust me if I did I would gladly contribute. What you and Grant are doing by highlighting this horrible tragedy is nothing short of brilliant. Thank you
I've been following your videos for a while. I'm a city guy myself in Utah, but spent a whole summer of my youth working on a farm, and those memories never go away. It was the best time of my life. I donated on GoFundMe. Send my prayers to your neighbor.
Пиздец, столько техники, столько трудов, мои соболезнования :...(
Great video, definitely able to help
I had one more thought. To our Government this is where I want my tax dollars going!! To help out Americans in trouble. Not China, Japan, Syria or Israel. As bad as I feel for Ukraine I am more concerned about America and her people! Maybe our Leaders can send a few million workers they allowed into our country to help Mike rebuild his farm and get back on his feet. How about that for a plan to help the people you swore to protect and the constitution you swire to uphold so help you GOD you athesist , communist sympathizing, traitorous, sheet stain. Do whats right for America not just yourself and your FAMILY.
Shame.. insurance might cover, but not in time.
One thing to add is while recording this video your creating a video log and  proof of ownership and condition of what equipment you have and store , so keep a copy for your insurance.  Review what you have for fire suppression in your house, work shop, buildings etc. Where you keep and store flammables. Between organics and petroleum products everything in your environment oily rags, used fluids,  paints, fertilizers are extremely flammable most with a very low flash point can ignite like a drummer from Spinal Tap , don't require an outside  source of ignition. things like grain dust , metal filings, magnesium powder, (dust ) etc are all possible fuel sources.  If Mike might had a suitable overhead suppression  system ( assuming he didn't from the footage ) it could have made a difference. Also it can lower your insurance rates when one is in place. My point is your lively hood is dangerous and something like an old battery cable getting so hot, can change everything in a blink of an eye and thank goodness no one was hurt.   Where you find yourself didn't happen over night ,and has taken lifetimes to get where you are today.  Certain things are impossible to predict , prevent or prepare for but fires are one you can plan for and hope never need to utilize what you put in place.  Fire safety cannot be over emphasized enough . Please take care of yourself and your community without you our country will not survive . Thank you for all you and your family do for our nation day in and day out. God bless you and your family , Mike's family will be in all of  our prayers.
I hope he is able to rebuild and recover from this
Insurance is a scam! They are pure evil! They take the money, invest to make millions, then when needed. They tuck tail! I hate every insurance company!
So sad
Just so viewers know, from town to town (Juniata to Aurora) is a 45 minute drive per Google maps.
How terrible. I feel for this poor man. It's so kind of you and Grant to help this fellow farmer and neighbor out. You two are such a fine young couple. God bless you both. I hope this dear fellow can recover soon.
That's sad,, but I would think if I had the money to spend on all of that equipment, I BELIEVE I WOULD ALSO INVEST IN SOME KIND OF FIRE EXTENGUISHING SYSTEM TOO,, LIKE OVER HEAD SPRINKLERS ETC. not saying it's the man's fault,, that's a Huge loss! I'm sure there was a lot of great equipment in there...... Maybe this will be a learning situation.
Laura, not knowing cost or anything ,what about a sprinkler system in your shop building?
Grant, the fire has to be 1200 or 1500 degrees to melt aluminum. I know this cause my shop burned to the  ground  on 12/27/21. This fire I bet was closer to 2000-2500 degrees or more. Prayers for the farmer and family.
You should reach out too the millennial farmer. He’s part of a program that could help this family.
lots of universities and local agricultural committees offer grants to farms- maybe have them check that out?
How did the fire start?
John Deere needs to look into and why the reason why the treasure is are known to have shorts  wire shorts that create the tractor to catch a fire because I’m no no to different farmers in Michigan one of the farmers it’s happened twice because of a short in the wearing. Sorry to hear about Mike but John Deere needs to look into it because there’s too many fires created by a short in the wiring
Farm rescue!
Laura I have been thinking about your neighbor Mike. He should check out his university to see if they might have any grants available. Maybe the local coops too.
I wish I was able to help but the best I can offer is my prayers for him and his family
I always look forward at the end of the day to see if Laura and Grant have posted anything new... this is so horrible, can't believe what I'm seeing... I just can't imagine anything like this :(
I hope you will help him with his feild then
Wow so sad.
Farm Rescue can help with harvesting and planting next year if needed
I'm proud of you two of offering help with the family that lost there farm  I wish I could help out as well it is very tough to farm now days our prayers are with you ❤
It may be a good idea to invest in a ceiling-mounted commercial fire sprinkler system in those buildings along with a fire alarm system.
This is a tragic loss that could have been easily avoided. As a past Fire Chief I have witnessed this over and over. I would never put any piece of equipment in a structure that was not protected by a automatic fire alarm system. At the first whiff of smoke or a sudden rise in temperature, the Fire Department is notified. Seconds matter. These systems are very inexpensive and work fantastic. I wish all insurance companies made them mandatory. I don't know where the smiley face at the bottom of this comment came from but this is a sad day for the owner of this property.
@laurafarms please explain why so much equipment would have been stored in one building, people saying this was an insurance set up is ridiculous and need to educate themselves on what exactly these farmers deal with every year and the regulations they are put against.
If you have insurance why would they not cover it I'd sue
The generations of tools, equipment, and memories gone.  That's sucks. Not cheap to replace anything on a farm.  Very sorry.  Only positive is nobody was hurt.  Hope you get your equipment in time for harvest.  But, farmers do come together in a time of need.  A few million dollars burnt.
Absolutely heartbreaking story thoughts prayers and positive vibes his way.  Laura talk to the millennial farmer and see if he can get you in touch with farm rescue for Mike
fire from what? luckily insurance
Years of hard work destroyed in less than a day
My goodness. So thoughtful to share 🙏🙏🙏
Laura i told you that i was going to share the story of this farmer i went to Zack millennial farmer shared on his channel, went to Welker Farms shared there as well and some other places to get this tragic story shared and to see if we could get help for this man. I hope you get to your goal and surpass it
Farming has alot that affects it, the economy,  the weather, the political climate,  it's a very risky business and it's not for the faint of heart, it's a love and passion passed down through generations by people who value hard work,  independence, love for the land, integrity and freedom,  they are the backbone of this Nation, we will pray for Mike and his family!
no CLUE where this is. juliana? grant knight? towns? local businesses? HUH???? bye bye !!!
Get ahold of farm rescue. Atleast it's would be a start. They can help do his harvest
So sad a loss but it's a reason why most farm buildings out west have fire suppression systems in all their buildings.  In fact, without it, many insurance policies may be canceled.  Larry
Quelle tristesse 😥de voir cet hangar brûlé 👩‍🚒🧑‍🚒🚒🚑avec tout ce matériel agricole 🚜à l’intérieur. Laura on sent ton émotion. J’espère que vous êtes assurés pour tout reconstruire. Bon courage pour vous remettre de ce malheur. 🫶🙏🇫🇷
Really sad situation ! Just thinking!  maybe spread the equipment out in different structures , if a fire starts you won’t loose so much 🤷‍♂️😬🤔
The Go Fund Me goal was just updated.  Unfortunately, Mike is underinsured by $500,000.  The Go Fund Me goal has been increased from $100,000 to $300,000.  If you've thought about helping Mike with a donation now might be a good time.   Anything can help.
What happens to his crops if he can not get any equipment back in time to harvest his fields? Will the community rally together and harvest the fields for him?
Should there be a go fund me opened?
Dark day indeed......  Saddens us to hear such news
I enjoy you both .. You give me lots of hope for our lives ... I hope that if you do go help them with harvesting or whatever... you document so we all can see.  You're hearts of gold ..thank you
That's too bad. Contact Farm Rescue
tHE DESTRUCTION DOES MAKE YOU SICK.   i'M 70 YEARS OLD ON A FIXED IMCOME, BUT I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR.    HOPE THINGS WORK OUT FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY.
❤🙏
Veel sterkte vanuit Nederland. Verschrikkelijk 😞😞
Channel is being over run by tele gram spammers. Not easy to get rid of but I did report them.
I love your channel, and your caring for others is so great. I have told many people and the youth at our church about it. The work ethic you and Grant show is a wonderful example for them. And the detail in describing what is very professional.  My prayers are with Mike and his family. Look at the work you have done has helped him so far. GOD BLESS ALL.
Laura! Grant! Good job getting the word out! Anyone watching this! Go donate! Gave what I could and every little bit helps! It's going to take Mike years if not decades to recover. It did for us when we lost everything! That was way before the internet and we started over with a 40 year old truck and hand tools. A little help would have been nice! Love of family and hard work saved us!
You are driving lots of donations, I just gave.
this is why you need to distribute your assets -think risk mitigation/risk management   ... consider a non-flammables building,  Repair Shop only building,  separate buildings for each  valuable piece of equipment., a fuel building, empty fuel from equipment before putting in the garage, etc ...
Our farmers are the backbone this country depends. I'm disabled and only living on disability, but I kicked in what little I could. I hope everyone else does as well.
Looks like a INSURANCE JOB for mo-money😂😂
What is the Farmers  full name and address as I want to send him a check.  Go Fund Me takes a portion out for themselves and I want the whole amount go to him. Thanks
Have them contact Farm Rescue for assistance with harvest..  This type of disaster qualifies for their help!
Is weird,i said it because, this days happens strange  things to the farmer,no food,no help,no support, for the environmentalists they are a nuinsance,🤔?
Put a call into Farm Rescue.  They could probably help.. What a loss, my prayers go out to him..
https://youtube.com/@LaiqAhmed-pw8tv
Something about the multi generational farmers....they refuse to lose.  So many people would just say "f-it, I'm done, can't do this anymore".  When farmers get knocked down, they seem to just jump back up and dust themselves off and say "damn." Now I need to go feed the herd"  Very special kind of people in my book.
Just shocking the damages. Fire is absolutely the worst. A fire suppression system is definitely in order for the amount of money invested in machinery.
I was burglarized a number of years back.  Insurance covered the items. But that didn't even come close to the headache of having to replace the items. I cannot even imagine the overhead to get replacement items on those items.  Aloha to you and Mike!
Been on farm growing up 2 things that have Me puzzled . She says middle of night tractor tires exploding . Why would the main shop in middle of night just catch fire ?🤔 This fire I dought was accidental . Growing up we had a barn fire lost stuff we just kept going . A true farmer finds his way. There are many businesses that have trouble . It also puzzles me that he would have his entire lively hood in one place as well . Insurance covers all kinds of this stuff so like why didn't they cover this is an interesting question. 🤔 How every something did occur but what's the rest of the story we don't no . In beginning you say main shop building caught fire yet tire exploded then supposed lee a wire on the battery of the tractor caught it on fire so that's two different senerals on it happening or how. I already got a figure that stuff maybe ran.  I'll go back though and listen again but they don't seem as upset as one should be more like a car salesman trying make a sell for the neighbors stuff . Just several questions I have about this video . I really think that there is stuff left out so I won't donate any thing if I was to as example less there was a better more clear story . I'm just saying my opinion on how I view this . That's all. Any way to this farmer and hundreds of other people who also suffer from this and don't utube it I wish you all the very best .
O.M.G. That is so devastating....I really wish i could help....I really feel for you all...Pray that he gets some help
Thank you for sharing.  Breaks the heart to see anyone have to go through with this kind of stuff.    Have certainly learned a lot about farming through you.  I have had former coworkers that grew up on a farm up in Regina, Canada.  Learned a lot about keeping things running. Repairing.   Thanks for the link. Will go and donate a little.
You are not bragging.  You are stating facts.  Farming is NOT cheap.  I live in Calif.  It is way more expensive here. Some of our equipment can run in the millions of dollars.  Land is stupid expensive.
Very sad story, donated. Grant you need to set up a fire suppresion system in the farm incase something like this occurs. Maybe overhead sprinklers or chemical. There are a few options.
Just donated to GFM. Very happy to support in any way possible.
Why aren't fire suppression systems used more in these buildings, housing equipment that costs so much?
Sorry for your Loss, thanks for Laura farms to get this out to all.  Laura and Grant = Great people.
Donation done..great effort and thanks for caring!
Terrible fire. I feel really bad for him and his family. Where I worked in a factory we had a machine catch fire and I have never seen I- beams just twist and melt before. Metal buildings go up in flames just like wood ones. Dust is a big problem and will burn as a fire starter.
Laura and Grant! You're wonderful people!❤ Hopefully, they have enough to help make ends meet.  It's literally impossible to keep up with insurance coverage these days! Maybe a 2-3 million umbrella policy over and above regular complete coverage would be a future possibility?? So elated to see that our contributions exceeded the goal! I say KEEP IT GOING! ❤❤❤💪💪🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hallo, wenn ich könnte würde ich sofort HELFEN. Aber ich kann ja nicht so einfach nach America einreisen. Ich Liebe America. Viele Grüße und alles gute für die zukunft.
Hey Laura you need to enable your $Thanks$ button to send cash!
❤ 9:57
I tried to share some information with you on this video that may have helped them but YouTube removed it, guess these socialist do not like that kind of thing.
Definitely makes a case for a sprinkler system in your shops
Please explain how tires explode and cause a fire like this. What is in those tires to make them explode ????
When I heard the sadness in your voice my heart shattered and I live on a farm and seeing this just helped me be grateful for what we have and to always help someone who is out there struggling with something . Thank you for sharing this story so we can help him .☹️
You should be very proud of yourselves for the deed done to help your neighbor.  Just 24 hours after this video, the goal has been surpassed.  It would never have happened so fast without your video and your fans.  Great job!
OMG!  How terrible.  I hope he is able to rebuild and recover from this.
What a terrible loss. Insurance is very important. I had 2 trucks catch fire in my driveway and one didn’t have full coverage and the one that did didn’t have GAP coverage so I still lost about $10k. Insurance never pays what it takes to replace the items either. Not to mention the countless thousands of items that aren’t really accounted for like parts, miscellaneous tools, and other odds and ends that’ve been collected over decades. I wouldn’t even know where to start. I would say in an operation like this that organization and documentation is your best friend.
This is a wake up call for many of us.  We all need to talk to our insurance agent periodically to be sure that we have enough coverage incase of a fire or accident.  Whether you are a business owner, home owner or renter. Thank to Laura and Grant for bring this to our attention.   Farmers are good people. I expect that friends and neighbors will come together to see that Mike's crops get harvested.  For the curious, look for a farm equipment show in your area. Usually they are in Jan- March.  Just walk around and ask the price of new equipment. About five years ago we  went to the Cotton Ginners show in Memphis,  TN. A new  cotton picker that put our to rolls of cotton was $750,000.  But it eliminated the need for about 12 hired hands needed to do the module type of harvesting.  GOOD farm hands are hard to get for seasonal work.
😔😔😔😔so sad
Wow making everyone think it was ur building with the thumbnail then cashing in on someone else’s tragedy, this is why ur horrible for YouTube and fake
...ouch.....!!!!
😢
Well done! $104,920 USD raised of $100,000 target and still going, keep up the good work!
What a pretty ah farm girl
Done
Hmmmm  looks set up
I was having a BAD flashback because of the barn fire that I had on February 26 2004  Lost a hundred year old barn with 1800 bales of hay, 12 sows with babies, 2 tractors, tools and so much more that I can’t describe. I was blessed because of fellow farmers who loaned me their tractor, feed, water tanks for the cattle. You don’t even think of the water well until you lose it and have to manually haul water. Then to deal with the insurance company that questioned everything you owned inside the barn. We survived because of good neighbors and friends/ family. So if you’re able to help then please do. ❤️
Awful.  No loss of life. Stuff can be replaced and rebuilt. God Bless them.
Are fire suppression systems a feasible option in equipment housing ?
That was hot.
Glad no one was hurt prayers to the family
Insurance will never replace everything or possibly even help much. The farming community should come together with helping get his crops in and possibly donate some old equipment they have and not use much. Hundreds of millions in damage. Prayers is al I have to offer right now but I believe things can be replaced but people can not.
😂🤣😂🤣
don't really know what to say, thats tragic. farms aren't houses, they're business. million dollar business. most of it still being payed off, most of it payed by loans, and insurance covers the cost of almost nothing.
Doesn't this make you rethink your practice using vise grips as battery terminal clamps?
So sorry for your massive loss. But the government along with Bill Gates, the NWO and the WHO ARE ALL SERIOUSLY AGAINST FARMERS FIRST AND REGULAR POPULATION 2ND. Also Laura Farms I truly hope that this is a lesson to you to have massive fire extinguisher system in all your sheds and garages and of course your house.
Give Trump a call  he loves  farmers
It takes only one moment and the sense of a life is questioned.  We should never forget this.
Just a heads up... the GoFundMe has already surpassed the initial goal of $100,000.
Not trying to be smart. Its a great wake up call to fire suppresion systems in your barns, smoke alarms, video surllance.  Need to protect your invest. How about preventive measures to protect your invest. Its really something to think about. There got to be technogoly out there to protect your farming investment. If there is 2 million dollars in equipment, invest in a great system to help protect it.
🙏🙏🙏💛💛💛
dayum
Laura and Grant. Praying that your platform can and will help Mike replace and begin again .  God bless 🙏🙏🙏
hello
Wow
I sent you some money, it isn't much but all I can afford now.  Please use this for this poor farmer during this horrible trajedy.
Thanks!
He hit his goal Laura and it was all because of you. Great job and very noble of you
God bless him and his family you should contact farm rescue
take heed ppl make sure your coverd
This is devastating. So sorry to hear about this.
What city n state is this located
Thank you, Laura and Grant for bringing Mike's loss to our attention.  My prayers are with him and his family.
😢😢😢😢
Great job Laura and Grant. I farmed 40 years in your area. I know you are being truthful and accurate along with compassionate. I gave and shared. I am confident your followers will come up with the half mil. and we and Mike's family will be blessed. You are a great example of using your talents for good.🤗
Looks like having more smaller buildings spread apart might start looking like a good idea. That and leave the lithium batteries outside.
How did it start?
Would be great idea to have another tractorshed on the compound, so if one garage goes up in flames you don't lose all tractors
Total loss help him out in anyway shape or form.
What a tragedy. Prayers for him and his family.
How did it start? My guess is a lithium battery went up. I am so sorry for your loss.
I am so sorry
18 hours ago I posted here and donated to the go fund account.    The objective was to raise $100,000. This morning I looked at the account balance.  For those who haven't looked, the go-fund-me account is just north of $97,000.   Farming is a hard, labor intensive job.  With apparently huge capital risks   Farmers put food on our table.  We don't go hungry. Our children don't go hungry.   We don't say it enough,   Thank you for all that you do for the rest of us.
Nearly at gofundme original goal of 100,000.  Let's get going toward $250,000!!!😮
This makes me feel sick to look at. I lived on a farm when I was a kid so I understand that that must have many decades of very hard work over several generations of farmers to get to this point and there is no way an insurance company can replace even a fraction of that cost and even what they do will take way to long for harvest time. ALL farmers in the area need to pool together to help this man take care of his farm until he can get back on his feet and that might take several years. I wish I had a few thousand dollars to help. Laura, you should ask the companies that sponsor your channel if they ca please help this man. Remind them if they do it right it could be a huge PR stunt. Hey if it helps then at this point any help is better than nothing.
This made it to #10 on trending right now.
As soon as I saw this I thought it was you guys although I was releaved it was not Laura Farm I donated right away to the gofundme in hopes to help him out. Do they know how the fire started?  Will someone help him continue to farm his fields?
I grew up on a dairy farm in Ohio...over the time, of living  and growing up, we lost 3 barns..one to lightning, one to a hot tracker motor and one intentionally set...it always feels sad, wish him the best...
Top 10 on trending!! Whoop whoop!!!
Great video explaining to everyone the cost of farming. You were not bragging only stating the truth. So sorry for the farmer that lost everything, but like he said no one was injured and he still has his family and a place to lay his head at night. Love your videos and so proud of you and Grant for y’all’s hard work.
You two did a fantastic job on your description of farming and equipment!! I grew up on a farm and can’t tell one tractor from another! Bless you and your family! Please all who read help support this farmer and all farmers we all would be in trouble with out them !!!
Great explanation on the prices of farm equipment and how long it takes to grow your business and livelihood as a farm.  It's not bragging, it's the true facts.
I love your show and watching you and Grant farm.....I'm old but find your show fascinating. Keep up the great work show and narrative ❣❣
😢
Well crap!
Defo get in touch with farm rescue
It is so bad when is happen Cheers Donald
So sad😢. I hope you and Grant have a state of the art fire alarm and fire suppression system in your buildings. I would have a night watchman n duty if possible.  Hopefully the farming community can come together in your area to help work his land and harvest crops. God bless you and Grant Laura
In case of nuclear war, one of the Russian strategies could be wide-area high detonation bursts designed to  set miles and miles of cropland on fire rather than lower detonations designed to knock structures down as would be used with cities.  If the strategy is to burn the crops near harvest time, there is little that could be done by Americans for protection, but at least if the roofs of buildings and the walls are painted with heat-reflective paint that would minimize the risk.  Anybody can google "nuclear vault" and see pictures of atomic bomb blasts from the old above-ground testing days.
發生了什麼事？我聽不懂。
You are the best
Страхования не помогает?
It's not bragging. You've had to borrow that money, risk it, and pay it back with interest for everything that you have and do. Anything that's left over is called earning. Then you have to spend that money again to buy more very expensive equipment, repair parts/service, supplies and the risk always continues. People who assume that this is easy, not hard work, not nerve wrecking have no clue and I wouldn't worry much about their opinions because they are ignorant or jealous. Farmer's have always had my respect because I was born and raised by parents were farmers and who's parents were also farmers. That's how I got so many talents to be able to do just about anything because farmers have to! It's so gut wrenching to see a farmer lose everything that they've worked so hard and worried so hard/stressed for to get!
It’s not only the equipment but also the supplies to maintain them the tools to repair them shop manuals and other materials needed to make them run
It is sad and I wish all of you the best
Can Farm Rescue help them out?
Note to self: might be a good idea to put battery disconnect switches on the equipment.😢😢😢😢😢
It really annoys me when politicians and others talk about the wealth farmers have ON PAPER. Oh they'er worth so many millions of dollars. None of that wealth is in a bank with the ability to spend.
🥰🥰
These people had some top of the line equipment, well taken care of , shock to the heart and pocket book
Farmers are learning the old practice of packing farm tractors and equipment in a shed, if one catches fire chances are they all burn, we were lucky , when it happened to us we only lost 2 tractors but a lot worse for one friend of mine
This is very sad , I had a small but could lost it all , I recommend fitting isolating switch’s on all tractors , trucks , windrowers , combine . Its worth the cost
Donated! You are great people using your platform to help!
Would it be a good idea to install some sort of automatic fire fighting system? Sprinklers, halon?
What a devastating loss!   Hopefully everyone can pull together to help out locally and nationally.
Bonjour de France,  j’adore vos vidéos très intéressante et rempli bonne humeur. Je suis vraiment attristé par cet événement tragique et je me joins à votre peine. En France, nous avons un système d’assurance qui couvre ses sinistres. J’espère que vous allez vite rebondir de cette terrible aventure et vous souhaite le meilleur pour la suite. Good luck Laura and Grant.
Get in touch with Farm Rescue
😢
So you're asking for money from all of us to help this is why the world is doesn't make and this is why the world is fuck up lol
Cause of fire?
So we’ll done I wish I could give you 1000 thumbs up 10,000 wouldn’t be enough
Ooooooo I wanna smell that color on your nails
I hope nobody got hurt. I feel for them I know what it's like to lose everything! If I had a way I would help with fall harvest!  Take a break and get your thoughts together.
These amazing machines are slowly changing people
Omg Laura what an awful tragedy to happen to him   Well done to you and grant for doing all you can to help hope he soon gets back up and running.😢
I'm Australian, but I can't imagine what it must be like to have your entire living pulled out from under you like that.  I donated and hope it helps.  Thanks to Laura for sharing this with me.
Looks like a small sun got loose in there, praying for him and you guys for helping him. Hope no critters were in there.
The cost factor is the most heartbreaking on top of a bad situation that happened when a fire caused a major loss
Thank You Laura For Doing What You Do!! Sharing Mike's  Devastating Tragic Loss! On Your Platform!!😢 Try To Keep Smiling On!! 😄👍👊❤️
God will provide stay faithful and diligent in prayer
Ok😮
It is awful that their insurance isn't fully covering everything. That is what these farmer insurances are for. In illinois my family all farm and if the word got out about an farmers insurance being sketchy or not putting up the money to reimburse a farmers loss. Everyone in the midwest is getting the word and going to all switch off that insurance. I would have lost it. I sent a donation to help. Heart goes out for him.
sorry you had a fire.
Definitely is a tough situation. It also sounds an awful lot like an insurance swizzle.  It may not be... But in any case if he was fully insured yes he will be paid in full for everything including equipment, machinery, buildings, sheds, hand tools etc. With so many farmers having an increasingly hard time making a living this type of "total loss" is currently increasing and will continue to do so.
Are fire sprinkler systems common in farm shops/sheds over there in the US? Devastating tho, big items are easy to spot an value but all the tools/ small items 🤯 I’m a business owner too and I have no idea how many tools I have🤯🤯
I know how I feel just seeing this destruction but I can not even begin to imagine how the owner feels.
In french, bon courage Laura, de tout coeur avec toi .
yes i used to work out on a farm but not do the stuff you guys did we worked on vehicles did hay and some other stuff but fortunately she passed away so we are selling the farm. so i am trying to get my appliance business up and going and then i have started to try to do doordash.  it would be nice if we will be able to meet and have each other on each other 's youtube channel. do i will pass the information for the gofundme account
We hope everything will be fine please help and listen also remember this conversation because we can't ignore this thing i hope I will help in future if i get a chance Indian's people pray and i will pray 🙏
hello
My uncle is a farmer and I've worked on his farm since I was a teenager and looking at this is just a kick to the gut!  I pray Mike can get his equipment replaced and back on his feet!
I wish I could help!  I'm on disability and low income...I can at least pray for everyone & everything to be safe & the Go Fund Me is a great success!  Laura and Grant, y'all stay safe & healthy!  Y'all are great people! ✌️😎❤️
Why do the machine sheds not have fire suppression systems installed in them??
Hi Laura, I hope no one or animal was harmed. My English is too bad to follow your video so quickly. Still, I don't understand one thing. In Germany you have to insure your building so that you get financial compensation for the damage in the event of fire, storm, water damage or hail. Later you listed the enormous sums of money in the devices. It's the same for all farmers. Then why don't you have a sprinkler system in your halls so that something like that can't happen in the event of a fire? Money should be spent on this in the same way as on a tractor. greetings from Germany
Very bad news Laura ☹️
Use farm rescue
Aloha Mike 🙏🏽
Привіт. Я з України  Мені подобається ваш канал, я часто дивлюся ваші відео. Ви дуже молодці! Мені дуже шкода вашого друга. Дуже надіюся що усі хто може допоможуть йому. Дійсно, ви дуже щасливі люди. Цініть це! Для розуміння, скільки наші Українські аграрії втратили і втрачають кожного дня, роками нажитого майна від ракетних обстрілі росії... це в десятки разів більше. ( Цінуйте все що маєте!
👍👍👍
Thank you for sharing
5th generation farmer is equivalent to 400 to 500 years
Tractors en machines een tijd met mike delen als dat kan, laura.
Farm rescue my be able to also help
I clicked that gofundme link and it is really heartwarming to see all those donations to help out this farmer in his time of need. The world isn't all bad after all. Props to Laura for using her channel to help him out.
Don't have that much to spare but donated something, Hope he is getting back on his feet a bit.
I am so sorry to see that it's absolutely a devastating thing I will refer x ranch on on a small 750 acre ranch raising cattle you can't be I am so sorry for that😮😎🤠
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
I appreciate you drawing attention to this situation. I went through the same thing a year and a half ago. Woke up one morning to see my machine shed burned down. Had a raging snow storm that night and shed was some distance from the house and wind blowing smoke away so I didn't know it burned during the night. Lost 2 tractors, both balers, a pickup and several other things. Shed was fuller than usual due to the snow storm forecasted. It's hard to understand the level of devastation you feel seeing that. My equipment was all much older so not the same level of monetary loss but still, like you stated it was my livelihood. Best I can describe it as is it feels like being robbed except you have to clean up the mess after. I don't know how i would have managed if i hadn't had help and support from friends and neighbors. Thanks for using your platform to help. Y'all are decent folks. Tell him that he and his family are in our prayers here.
Oh, so sorry to hear it.
Laura I can see the hurt in your eyes!! Hopefully the GoFundMe will help this Farmer out!!! God Bless!!! <3
Heart breaking.  Prayers for his recovery.
How do I get to his go fund me site?
Laura please keep us up-to-date and when harvest should start.
Please install sprinklers in your important sheds
Nice explanation of everything, a lot of people have no idea what we have invested
Laura you are not bragging it's fact that some people need to know as with out farmers where would the get the majority of food and milk in life. I help my family on a farm and everything has gone stupid in price so we have reduced cattle just to life as it's getting out of hand hope everything will work out for mike
Mike - you and your family are in our thoughts and prayers. It is understandable that you sound so deflated but I feel you will be back soon because there are a lot of people who are in your corner. You aren’t alone. Best of luck to you and your family. Don’t give up.   Laura - thank you for your care and concern for your fellow farmers. Best of luck to you too.
Can you do a follow up on this one
sad loss ! but i really think he needed to thank all the 1st responders who showed up to help save stuff that was around the barn !  hope he gets all the help he needs
Donated. Wish Mike and his family all the best.
Oh my thank you guys for helping! God bless I pray many come to help him!
My heart goes out to the owner.  Back in the late 70's my grandparents shop went up and they lost all their equipment.   It takes years too recover from something like this.  Prayers for the owner and his loved ones!
Very heart wrenching. You have done A great job of explaining thing. Just looking at the equipment you are showing I think you are shooting low on the values. My prayers go out to Mike and his family
What a gut punch! It’s not bragging talking about the costs of tractors, they are expensive capital equipment and necessary to produce and harvest a crop. They are not a luxury. God bless you for presenting this tragedy. Insurance, even if full replacement, does not recover all the costs associated with such a loss.
Losing machinery and shed is costly, Im sure his neighbors will help him until he is able to purchase more equipment, as a farmer he should never have large machinery in a enclosed shed, lesson learned I guess.
Now THIS is what is called a tough break 😭😭😭
You are brave former. You recover quickly. I hope God not cruel
so so sorry :(    get all the news stations involved .
Heartbreaking
Laura, Grant thanks for sharing this devastating story and bringing the awareness. Glad I have the opportunity to add a donation to your gofund me ❤️‍🩹
In many God's Prayers  to Everyone....  Hope you and Grant  can sit down and make new rules for Laura  farms......(1) Quick  disconnect  batteries  on tractors.....(2) No hot work  in storage  buildings......Could  a over head fire sprinklers help lessen the damage... (6) fire alarms  connected  to Laura's Bedroom.......(7) It be cool to install fire fighting  NOZZLES  around  house,barns,storage  buildings........(7) It be wonderful  if Laura does  Fire drills (as vide video content) zSo perhaps  Laura and Grant  can know what to do.....and help thick of ways to protect  Laura  farms...   We hate to see such sad things happen  to Wonderful  People.    WE PRAY that Laura &Grant  will be inspired  to thick and rehearsal  Ideas to protect  Laura  beautiful  farm in a Emergency 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
bad eye lashes
Laura and Grant.  Thank you for sharing this story.  By helping Mike you reveal your good nature, caring and compassion.  It shows you to be good citizens.  I donated. Thanks.
I'm 71+years old and I  cried  watching this.  Talking about the enormous amount of money that it takes to  make it as a farmer is not bragging just a matter of  FACT.  I've not farmed sense 1975.  I left the farm 🚜 in Gaines Co, Texas, but it's never left me, and the the feeling of the community coming together help a fellow farmer.  May God  bless everyone that can help in whatever way   they can.👍🇺🇸👍
If all Laura’s subscribers would donate $5 to $10  it would really help this farmer
😌😌😌😌😭🥲
Can you please help us locate the go-fund-me page for Mike so we can go to the right funding page?
Hearts of gold, you guys!  Hearts of gold!
HOW...How did the Fire Inspector claim that the Tractor Battery Cable was the cause... What a Crock.
That was clearly another Directed Energy Weapon Hit. Metal doesn't twist and bend like that in an open Atmosphere Fire.  Forged Aluminum doesn't reach a high enough Temperature in an open atmosphere fire to become Molten and flow. Glass requires Furnace tempuratures to Melt. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL FIRE.  Clearly was hit with Military Technology HPM-DEW.
I would try to save all the aluminum puddles to sell later
AGAIN!! You guys have some luck... I wish you a speedy recovery...
How long is fire department response time to your location? Just saying that some fire prevention, and fire extinguishing equipment as well as firefighting water supply may be good investment and may help out on the insurance premiums. Not criticizing, just food for thought. I know an overheating battery cable is hard to predict. I will  look at Mike's go fund me page as well.  Hope he recovers from this because we need farmers!
Farm Rescue will help this gentleman and give him time to figure out his recovery
Heartbreaking to hear.  Thank you for sharing his gofund me page, I’ll be giving some support.
What a mess. My thoughts are with this family and i hope they are able to get back on their feet real soon. Just a thought. It would pay to have an isolation switch fitted to all machines so when this is activated at end of use the power would be cut and may prevent this sort of thing happening.
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS  GOD BLESS 🙏
Just watched this video and clicked the link to the GoFundMe page man its already at over 90K that's awesome, thanks for getting the word out hope this never happens to yall
Install a sprinkler system??
Tragic. But, God only gives what you can handle. Suck it up and go on with your life. He has plans for you. Oh, and I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way. It is not cold. It is from the heart, that whatever happens here, on this earth, your home is not here. Your only worry should be hoe your real father feels about you. This is, indeed, tough. But the strength you need is in God. You will know them by their fruits. You will find out who your friends really are in times like this.
hi Laura this might help your friend in need Farm Rescue seen them on Millennial Farmer .
Thanks. One of your best videos. Couldn't send much, but I imagine every little bit can help!
With all late model John Deere equipment I would think mother deer could do most of the helping
Yes, please keep us updated on how that family fares.  We checked the box on GoFundMe and I'll bet the LF Fan family will make up a large portion of that funding.
PRAYERS.
Insurance is grassy u think u have it covered  then they try and find one like yours to replace it and in are experienced it's not even close  to what u had
Hi Laura and Grant I just watched this video.   It is so heartbreaking. Has the family  or friend contacted  Farm Rescue to see if they would be available to offer some help. Thank you for sharing the story!
I'd want to know why the electrical fire started. If it was a battery connection... why?
this were a insurance public adjuster comes into the picture for the policy holder not the insurance company adjuster.
What a loss so sad for that family.  Watching this from Alberta with a face of tears. Thank you Laura and Grant fof what you are doing to help this family
you should look into an estimate to have a fire sprinkler system to prevent a total loss in your buildings
You might want to invest in a fire suppressant system for your equipment buildings and not in up like your neighbor.also your friend isn't the only one that had his building burnt down 2 weeks ago a friend of mine lighting hit his barn with 2 tractors a several implements and his is a total loss also.
A buddy of mine down the road lost everything in his shop, including two Hesston balers. He managed to get back with the help from the community. It also served as a wakeup call to all of us. It could happen to anyone.
Oh god take care God bless you
I'm really sorry for your neighbor's loss.  But you need to understand that when you talk about a neighbor who lost MILLIONS of dollars in equipment in a fire, that 99% of the people watching your channel have NEVER had the opportunity to own MILLIONS of dollars of ANYTHING.  My father served his country in the U.S. Navy for 23 years.  He did not leave his kids MILLIONS of dollars in land and capital assets.   I am in my 70's and have worked hard all my life for every dollar I have.  I went to college and spent ten years paying off the loans that were required to do so.  Just understand that you and your husband and your neighbor are NOT the norm.  The rest of us work just as hard as you (if not harder), but have not been gifted with generations of ancestors that have, over the years, built up establishments worth MILLIONS of dollars.  You are lucky that you both were born into those situations, but please understand that most of us were not.  I don't resent your good fortune, but please recognize that you are in a privileged position that 99% of us will never be in.
Laura, I'll do what I can to help this guy, but bigger picture, I hope you and Grant take a lesson here.  You have big knowledge of water pumps etc.  How difficult would it be to install a sprinkler or auto water cannon on/in your shop building - like the military uses in hangars.   I know it freezes there but would be effective most of the year and would possibly save you some money on insurance.  Just a thought.  Best to you.
Thank you Laura n Grant for letting us help out with money n prayers - thank you for the opportunity to be part of the healing !  Blessings! 🙏
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🇺🇸👀🇺🇸👀🇺🇸👀🇺🇸
Wow that really stinks that is a huge loss. My prayers go out to Mike and his family. I hope that the farm rescue community can help him out. Thank you Laura and Grant for bringing this tragedy of a story to our attention. God bless and stay safe
I definitely think that Farm Rescue could help with his situation, hopefully they can to help take a load of stress off of his shoulders
Pray for Mike thats he will get back at it
Every farmer needs to have the connected smart fire detectors in every building.  They send an alert to your phone and activate your cellphone's alarm.  I donated what I could.  It's not much but I hope it helps.
Would be a good idea to install and use dead man switches on all battery systems to help prevent fires
Reach out to Farm Rescue Organization ! They help farmers family crisis
Have you looked into a fire protection system? May  be a good idea for your barns
Thank you Laura for helping this fellow farmer by spreading the word on your channel. I know many of your subscribers will want to help through the Go Fund Me account for his family. I have watched some videos about the Farm Rescue organization and they may can help until he can get some replacement equipment.  I love watching you and Grant work on your farm.
Sorry for Mike and his families loss. Never have liked to see people loss there lively hood. Praying for them to help them with their needs. God bless what you Laura and Grant do to show people what framing communities do and go through.
god bless
Not sure if I should like or not. Prayers for this Farmer.
Ya know 🙄
Thanks for helping him out Laura and Grant.
@LauraFarms did you tell Mike about Farm Rescue. If not tell him because they are a non-profitable organization that helps family's in his situation.
Wow so sorry.   Rebuild and come back better than ever
Contact farm rescue they have helped over 1000 farmers
Sorry about the loss… I’m glad it wasn’t a red machine
When we have hail in the forecast, we put everything under cover also. With the smart phones and weather apps, you have no excuse for not putting things away if possible, to prevent baseballs from beating up your huge investment. This is normal protocol and common sense for any farmer. Somethimes you have to weigh the odds in everything we do in life. 60% odds are a good threshold to get "movin".
Sad to hear and see that devastation that the fire cost maybe an idea just to rent the equipment needed for planting and harvesting for a year or two until he gets back on his feet again! Once the harvest is over there could be good deals to be got on some of the machinery needed!!
No more vice grips on battery cables!!!
Do an only fans and raise some real money 😂
You are a good person, Well done on the support
With that kind of money invested I would think that a fire suppressions system, like overhead sprinklers would be a good idea. Even in cold storage you can install a dry system so it doesn't freeze in the winter time. You would probably get a cheaper fire insurance rate too.
Thanks Laura and Grant for using your platform to help this farmer... looking at the GoFundme (after donating) its had a lot of hits so far and I can only think that a lot of that is because of you.
Smoke alarms?
You should use mic for recording voice.
Ouch!! Sorry for the loss!! Glad they are bodily ok!! Praying for them!!
Oh man, that's rough! Great idea to use your platform to help out a fellow farmer.
Contact Farm Rescue
Devastating to say the least. As said it takes years to accumulate the equipment necessary for the farming business. Glad to help this farmer in some small way. Hopefully he can get through the harvest season with neighbors and equipment manufacturers stepping in. Nice job by Laura Farms to bring this to attention. Just gave me the impetus have more than one building housing equipment. Luckily 2 years ago in my town we passed a tax abatement of $100K per farm building against the building value for each farm building.
I cant imagine,but I know people who can will step in,my best to him and his family
So will you guys and the rest of the farmers help get his crops in?  Seems like a good way to help.  This is so bad any time but isn’t harvest not far in the future?  Seems to be a good argument for multiple buildings to put stuff in.
Of course I sent a donation. How could a loving person not do so. I remember when my fathers factory burned on a Thanksgiving weekend. Dad and my 2 uncles ALL had heart attacks within 5 days. I was too little to understand the calamity until I saw the building after the cleanup. Nobody died(thank GOD) and all the employees were able to be kept on payroll. Your neighbor will survive but the fear and stress of trying to rebuild will take years to get past. As you two walk thru your building be sure to take pictures often to keep track for insurance. Take pics of all those tool boxes and loose tools. After all the loss of the factory Dad became a photographer of EVERYTHING at work. All folks need to try to do that because just like Mike, you NEVER know when disaster will strike. My prayers, real prayers to GOD above will be made on behalf of Mike and his family but also for you as wonderful neighbors. Blessings on all who labor to feed and enrich the life of our nation. Amen.
Look into the feasibility of a 21st century fire suppression system.  I know you will have to work around freezing temperature in the winter.  But there are ultra high pressure sprinkler systems which use very little water so they can work with a well.  They were first used on ships but can be installed anywhere.  The cost is lower than traditional deluge systems because the piping is smaller.
Laura Farms I didn't see any fire sprinklers in the buildings you show here, with all your equipment in them.   Millions of dollars in equipment indoors with no fire sprinklers seems very risky.
Farm rescue that's it they can help
It’s gonna take a special relationship with a good bank to refinance this equipment. A big low interest loan at the beginning and many initial changes to keep going. He can do it!
🙏 Hopefully Farm Rescue can help. Knowing the Farming community they Step up and help those that have a tragedy
Get ahold of millennium farmer... Zach Johnson be a good candidate for farm rescue.
There is an organization out there that goes nation wide to help for just like this it was on Utube I can't remember
Would it be cost prohibitive to add a fire suppression system to your facilities?
Laura, great service to your neighbor and two of those of us in the agricultural community I think that the other ninety-eight percent of the people whom we serve need a little review once in awhile to be reminded yes to the cost physically emotionally and certainly financially that way is Farmers endure in order to keep the rest of our nation and indeed the world fed
What an awesome video about a fellow famer who lost everything. You are an amazing person, thank you for sharing this story.
I just donated. Thank you for sharing his story. My prayers go out to him and his family.
Sometimes some of the companies, have loaner programs, grants are available. Jerry from Anaheim, California ❤ 😊
People have no idea what is involved in farming, none. My family on my mom's side were multi generation farmers. Grandfather, uncle\mom's brother, cousins etc. Prayers to his family. God bless.

Speaking as a Firefighter…Please think of a fire detection system for all of your home and buildings. It will pay for itself with one little fire discovered in the very early stages of the fire.  You just have to be careful when you cold start some of your rigs…..very smoky with the exhaust.
Laura and Grant love your fun places you go, Cogradulations on your wedding. Can I find a mailing address? Laura Farms Nebraska?  I’ll send $100.  in 2 weeks What about Zell ? Maybe, we can donate $ to John Deere to purchase new equipment. ❤ Jerry from Anaheim California ❤
This brings up a good point about taking care of your equipment. I highly recommend putting disconnects on all your equipment that has a battery to disconnect the power to all the electronics. Very sad story.
Sending prayers 🙏  such a horrible thing!!!😢😢
I would like to add those, who would read this, but a main power kill switch on your equipment may help prevent this kind of devastation in farming, construction or any other kind of operation, a cheap investment will help in the long run. I have seen a fire in my neighborhood that did cost the owner money due to an electrical fire.
I know when it comes time to harvest that his crops will get harvested. Farmers are a breed of they're own. His local neighbors will come from all over with they're own equipment and cut his crop and they won't even ask for any money. God bless Mike and his family.
Insurance?
Very sad! 2nd  video of Deere R tractors catching fire one in a field of corn .  Deere won’t take responsibility. Even a Farm security video shows it catching fire. It starts on right hand arm rest.
This is a pain not many can fully understand . I'm sorry for your loss of all of your equipment . That combine must be a monstrous machine to replace alone .

If ever a farmer needed big corprate aid this is the time.
I am an Ohio arborist and I know what my equipment costs are. It isn't easy and I have a fraction of what you all have. God bless you for airing this and God bless this man.
You must learn from this. Maybe contact your insurance agent and get ideas as to what you should do regarding inventory. Count every wrench and screwdriver. Keep the paper work for your large equipment on the cloud or a fireproof box in the house. Take a lot of pictures or video, it sure can't hurt anything. Also, I've seen a lot of fires started at or very near batteries and the chargers. I don't know if you have electric fences but I've seen lightning strike the fence way out in the field, follow it back to the fencer in the barn and explode burning the barn down. Lots of things to do to try to avoid this, easy things. Godspeed! ❤❤❤ By the way, I am a subscriber and love you (and your fathers) channel! Keep the great content coming.
Insurance ??? Prayers go out to y’all from TX 🙏
If I was a farmer I would never keep all of my equipment in one building I would have multiple buildings spaced apart was just a few pieces of farm equipment in each one so that way if one catches fire I may lose the equipment in that building but I won't lose all of my equipment
Praying for him
Hi Laura that made me Sick when you showed this video... Of that Farmer that lost everything on the farm . So sorry to see that Famer go through this 😢 We all got to help so how❤
On a lighter day I’d love to hear details on why those tractors look so similar but with drastic cost differences, and why all this equipment costs as much as it does. The generational planning to build a farm is fascinating from the outside as well, and I’d love to learn more on that too.  I appreciate you sharing this story and showing some of the harder parts of that life.
Smoke detectors
Make sure to disconnect battery chargers!
Ooooooo….. clickbait. Here I thought it was yours ….. ouch. Don’t like clickbait. Most people don’t. Why wouldn’t insurance cover it ? …. Insurance should cover it. Unless he didn’t have insurance, in that case why should we make up for his short comings / lack of forethought. He had insurance, but it’s not going to cover it all ? 1:06 That statement makes no sense. What a great way to upgrade everything, wait for hail storm, pack everything in barn, oops fire, everything gets replaced BRAND NEW. 1:06
It's a shame. I remember back in the day when farm buildings were smaller and placed far apart to keep this from happening. Fires were a big problem back in those days, they didn't have first responders like we do now. Large buildings are cool but when this happens the loss in unimaginable. I hope he can put it all back together again...
Good luck collecting insurance
Talk to Zack Johnson from Millennial Farmer he knows people that help with things like this
Aluminium melts at 1,221 F. That F-150 is crazy
🙏4u
Hope we find out what caused the fire, so we can learn from it.
😢🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hay the millennial farmer ( jack Johnson )help this charity that helps farmers like this. they will come and plant and heaviest farmers who have had things like this happened to them. I can't rehabber their name dam it (62 LOL) but they help all over the USA . I think it's call Farmers rescue, or Farmer Rescue.
Hey John Deere, ,now would be a great time to step up to the plate...!!!!
donated a little just because
I retired after 22 years as a city firefighter and have been a volunteer since '82. I've seen a lot of tragedy. This never gets easy. At least there were no injuries. As a volunteer, I've been to many barn fires as it was an agricultural community in south central Pennsylvania. The farmers always bounce back, help each other with fields and milk houses. By the way, aluminum melts at 1100 degrees. God bless you and your friend. Heads held high and some hard work, you all  can come back from this. Prayers to you! 🙏🙏🙏🙏💪💪
Sorry for there loss farming ❤ ;   (Fire prevention is ins )lots of money lost how much was spent on fire prevention, was there a sprinkler system or any fire supretion systems millions of bucks but I’m curius ?? , I’m just wondering if there was any fire prevention system ????????? JUST ASKING it’s so sad to see so many farmers struggling these days my heart is sad you feed the country ✌️💜 thank you for the hard work you are doing , love watching your channel I wish you all the best
I am so happy to be able to help and thank you for sharing. I can only imagine the pain that the family is feeling. I just wish I could do more.
Thank you Mike, and thank you Laura for helping me feed my family. Without You farmers , America wouldn't be so GREAT.
This is a perfect example of how we start to take things for granted until you face the reality of how fast your health or wealth can go in a blink of an eye..!  You all will be blessed and humbled when Mike's family and all involved get through this.  Huge prayers to you all.....!
An Unfortunate event that should remind everyone to reevaluate if they are properly insured.    dont skimp on insurance or this could be you unfortunately.
God bless yall, the fire victims, and all the amazing farmers for all the great things they do for our country, from providing corn for ethonal for fuel, to putting food on our tables. I said a prayer for the family and everyone else involved on that farm. I wish the family and farm the best and I hope God can get them back up and running like nothing ever happened in no time. It's so sad and unfortunate that happened, and although it's a horrible way to learn the hard way that you don't put all your eggs in one basket, I'm just glad everyone is OK and it was only equipment and a building that were lost because unlike human lives, that stuff is replaceable. I'm also super thankful that Laura and Grant were kind enough to use their outreach to get as much community help as possible to help a fellow farmer and try to get that farm going again. Much love and God bless that family, as well as you Laura and Grant! ❤🙏🏻
Why does the volume on your videos suck? Good lord woman...
It will buff out. . Insurance will cover most of it. That's why you have it..
Plenty of big hearts out there judging by the GoFundMe today. Here's hoping it blows way past the target. Laura and Grant should be proud of the internet community they have built. You've no idea how entertained this city boy software architect has been by alien (but marvelous) concepts like "detasseling". Happy to be able to do my bit in return now. Best of wishes to Mike.
Get with Millenial Farmer, he is part of that group that helps farmers that have tragedies like this.
Prayer's won't help these people -- only money! Don't believe it! Just ask his insurance company that abandoned him...!  I'm homeless. But their are people that have money. And since people are always belittling how important money is and that money can't buy you love! If this is your belief then it should be no problem for you to donate a couple hundred thousand to help this farmer.  Strange, people can spend nearly a billion to search and attempt to rescue that cardboard sub that imploded. But we can't send a fraction of that to help this farmer! America is fkd up!  And what about the power of voting? Where's the Democratic party now! Where's the government now!   It's not and has never been the governments job to provide you a living or keep you safe! That's your fking job!  I realize that this guy's farm isn't as important as some white girls TikTok video twerking!   But it still deserves the people's help! If a farmer came forward everyday with this story, clearly, no one could afford to give!  But just this once do something that actually helps somebody!
you can also help him to give your equipments to him for harvesting and bowing crops
It’s hard to suggest the need for sprinkler systems in expensive farm shops and equipment storage.  With multimillion investment, a dry pipe sprinkler system could save a building and the enclosed equipment.  Insurance would be somewhat cheaper with a sprinkler system.  What a tragedy to lose everything.
I'm very sorry for this loss.
GoFundMe done. Thanks for letting us all know about this.
The government will bail him out. They always take care of the rich people. Screw the working class. It will never change.
Were so very sorry for this devastation. Of course, we'll donate. Thanks Laura and Grant for sharing this. 🙏.
My heart goes out to him and his family. That is a massive loss, the replacement costs and timeframe to actually get it all replaced is going to be a real pain right now.   Thanks for sharing, I hope what little I can help makes a difference. If everyone who subscribes to your channel gives him $2 he will be so blessed and able to recover that much faster. We need you farmers. Thanks Laura
Millennial Farmer gets involved with "Farm Rescue" in helping other farmers when a tragedy happens on their farm. Maybe reaching out to them and seeing if they can help..
Laura, idk if you talk to Zach Johnson (MillennialFarmer) at all, but if you do, reach out to him, or try to get in touch directly with Farm Rescue. They would be there to help that guy in no time!
I shared on my swedish facebook. =O)  HUGE ❤ for you ALL farmers out there.
Sad
a good idea would be to have smaller buildings, so if one catches fire you wouldn't lose everything
I can’t even imagine going through something like this.  What a shame.
Devastating loss. What can be learned from it?  Prevention, Sprinkler systems. separate equipment storage building,  from main work shop?
Laura and Grant....you both are so humble and genuine. God be with you and your neighbor Mike
So sad Laura. Get ahold of farm rescue.and millennial farmer.
Two words... sprinkler system. Probably not cheap but worth the cost if ever needed.
This is just heart breaking.The cost of replacement is unreal it cost so much. Prayers to the family and everyone affected! To melt aluminum it has to be close too or over 1221* F, that is HOT!!!
I'm not a farmer but have worked in the agriculture industry for over 20 years now and have HUGE respect for farmers. I'm so sorry to hear about Mike's (and families) loss.  Thank you Laura for leveraging what you can to bring attention to this cause.  I have made a donation to the GoFundMe campaign.  It's not much but I hope it will help.
Do you know if Mike and his family have reached out to Farm Rescue? Zach Johnson (millennial farmer) talks about them frequently, and with harvest around the corner, they might be able to help! Wish I had the contact info. Prayers to Mike and his family, from my family. Wish I could do more to help.
Driving by every single farm and seeing all the equipment i just have to say i fell in love with farming and became a farmer in Farming Simulator 2022. And most importantly i'm glad nothing catches on fire in Farming Simulator 2022.
Absolutely makes me sick to see that kind of loss to all the people out there who look at farmers and form an opinion of their lifestyle usually how rich or extravagant it is I say take your turn at it make the mental and physical investments that it takes to operate to make a living and then give me your opinion or you can go work at McDonald's for $18 an hour with next to no investments and cash your paycheck and go home nice and clean with no worries  just think about this the next time you consume anything to get through your  daily life and mabey appreciate farmers a little more
When you were putting value on your equipment, I did not see that as bragging. Some of us , like me are not farmers therefore we don't have an idea of what a fully stocked and functional farm costs.
Glad to help out and contribute. I am sure someone got a hold of Farm rescue already. This may be a good reason to have a sprinkler system of some kind.
Thanks for sharing his story.  Donated!  I enjoy following you and Grants journey.  Thank you.
Aluminum  melts at 1400 degrees f.
Insurance is the main point, even for everyday homeowners.  Make sure your policies keep up with inflation!

Damn mad love to the 75 thousand raised already on the gofundme yall are so generous!
This is the only way i can help. #MrBeast
😢will keep him in our prayers 🙏
This is heart wrenching..

This is sad. What makes it really hit home is that he is a fellow Nebraskan.
Donated to the go fund me.  Thanks for sharing the story.
So sad ,i gave to help ,my grandfather was a pig farmer  all his life ,worked dawn to dusk and died young . Respect to all farmers.
Sent $200....Lets go people, lets make Laura proud!
Speaking for all Americans. Make certain the Insurance company *(ies if there is more than one involved) pay the correct value. We all have Insurance and we all pay in and behind our backs the insurance companies belittle the value of our property while they do despicable  things with our money like finance  the Communist Chinese Party buying U.S. farmland and biological weapon development to kill our own people. So, you paid your premiums and you are entitled. I have never had even 1 claim ever, but I've paid insurance all of my life, so SOMEONE should be taken care of correctly. It's hard enough to handle the losses, but add to that the insurance companies sending out claims adjusters trying to chisel you so they don't have to pay. Laura, please keep us abreast of the progress good and bad that "MIke" encounters. And name names of the Insurance companies so we all know who to work with or avoid. ben/ michigan
Best wishes for his recovery.
You and Grant are what I love about this country.  Happy to sent some $$$ to help one of your neighbors.   ps I liked your fishing TikTok lol
Always always disconnect battery cables when u store gear also in or truck shop we disconnect batteries ever night when we go in
Farmers always help each other
Nothing I can say will do to console, but I’m sorry for your loss.  I have to wonder about the source of ignition, an “overheated battery cable”.  Was the battery shorted somehow?  Did the cable overheat because of a faulty power switch?  If so, that seems like a manufacturer’s defect - litigation for settlement with them.  Battery cables need to be kept clean and free of oils and combustible fluids, although rubber and plastic wire insulation can ignite, too.  I have also heard (know of a case) of defective trickle and maintenance battery chargers, over-charging a battery, which can lead to an explosion and fire.  With all of the fuel in those vehicles, it wouldn’t take long for an inferno to develop and create the devastation that you see.  Please take care with batteries and chargers, if you are using these devices.  Older chargers might malfunction, and should be routinely checked by a qualified service technician.  Batteries release explosive gasses as they charge, as well.  Be aware that rodents, such as mice and rats, will naw on wires, could create short and spark that could ignite something - be sure to use rodent traps and restricted poison boxes in the equipment shed, where other beloved pets cannot access and ingest.  Oil soaked rags can spontaneously combust, and should be stored in smaller cans filled with water, until they can be properly disposed or burned outside - never accumulate piles of these rags.  And mixing fertilizer granules with certain fluids (can’t say here, but we should all know) - never.  Identify all flammables and ignition sources, and keep these separated, as much as possible.  As for natural disasters, wind, hail, lightning - only thing you can do is rely on insurance, and lightning rod diversion.  Water sprinkler systems may not help, but might spread heavier fuels (like diesel) and flames, making it worse.  Instead, use powder and foam dispensing systems.  I hope some of these comments will prompt you to inspect your layouts, and maybe stop another potential tragedy.  No blame here; just remember to “Never be complacent about safety.”  This is just an unfortunate situation!  Trying to save equipment from large hail, but losing it anyway to fire.  May you work your way back eventually, with a spirit of hope and determination.  May you find the support of farmers and friends across this great nation.  Guys, if it were you and your farm, wouldn’t you hope people would reach out with support for you and your situation?  May you be blessed!!!!!
That really sucks!  Farming is tough already and losses like this makes it that much tougher.
That is a brutal gut punch of a loss... my heart goes out to him. I have learned so much from watching your channel... It is obvious just how important and expensive the mechanized equipment is to modern family farms.
Sorry for the troublesome news, hope everything works out for you, I feel so sad to watch this video
I feel so bad for him
do any farmers use sprinkler systems in their barns(equipment buildings) like factories/shops use  for fires?..i'm sure its expensive but i was just curious
Donation sent. I was curious, do barns like these have fire suppression like sprinklers?
Millions of dollars of equipment is bad enough but then there's the emotional impact for their family and the recovery to pre disaster condition. Thoughts and prayers to this unfortunate family. Top marks to you guys for what you're doing to help.
Very sorry to hear your loss , I am a farmer from Punjab India can understand the feeling of farmer
You all have probably considered this and are going to do it, but if not here's idea:   try to get a bunch of farmers to help him seed etc harvest etc and use money made to help him, if that's possible?  I've no clue.   If you ask me though the insurance place should cover the insured losses, and I'll bet there's a farm disaster relief help as well.  Anyway it didn't look good that's for sure! Prayers.
Please tell me you have a sprinkler system.  I would be so sad to see that happen to someone else.
Shared…
Makes me think back to when we had many small sheds ( built as we could afford them ) instead of one big shed  now was not such a bad idea.
Hi Laura I am sorry very sad
Be proud of being good neighbours Laura and Grant, have you seen the go fund me? It’s heartwarming. The world needs more people like you who will help when and where they have the means, and in your case, the platform, to do so.
Donation Sent.  Laura and Grant you were very generous.  Mike and his family will survive.  You can see it in his eyes and voice.
Donated, God Bless our Farmers
So sorry to hear. What matters is nobody got hurt. Prayers for him.
6000$ to 70000$ in 7-8h realy amazing to do that for ur neighbor 💪💪💪 Laura and Grant have such a big heart❤ thanks you for supporting farmer whenever they need help. have a good harvest from a farmer northern alberta canada
Même chose l'automne passée... Notre garage de ferme à brûler aussi... Maintenant en reconstruction....
I can’t put into words on how much pain Mike and his family are going through. With Our Lord’s Blessing He will Always Be There For Us. We farmers are a tough bunch and they will pull through this. God Bless his family.
Something tells me Mike will not have trouble getting his crops in this season.  I think you farmers in NE look out for one another.
Donation made, prayers for the family. Thanks for helping them and sharing this so I could help! 👍❤️😎
This is how people get rid of boats too.
Mennonite Disaster Service or an Amish community might be able to build a new machine shed…
Well I'll tell you the best investment I ever did on our farm is put sprinkler systems in every building and I'll tell you it might cost you some money to do but knowing that if something like that ever happens chance that you could save equipment and also get insurance on everything every piece of our equipment got some type of insurance on it so if it's damaged at lease u know u can get some equipment to continue to farm or ranch and knowing ur neighbors ain't going to let u go through this alone bc it can happen to anyone at anytime
I am so sorry for your loss. I have never farmed but I was a trucker for 20y I do understand that the price tag for this is very very pricey. All I can do is send out my love for all of you. Best wishes if I find work soon I will pay it forward ASAP again so sorry. Cheers
You and Grant are true Americans  God bless
Prayers from Kentucky
Sorry for your neighbors loss will keep him in our prayers
Woow...😮😮..lamento Laura.. Si no hay perdidas humanas todo se recupera...lo material es reemplazable..son jovenes y tienen salud..bamo arriba a recomenzar...Abrazo desde Uruuguay..🇺🇾
You should reach out to Diesel Dave.  He's been getting a lot of equipment in, maybe some of that can help.
Holy Crap...  That's some serious damage.  Crazy heat!
Too bad too sad
131k views already, imagine if the each donated just $5.  Hope everyone who can sees their way to donate, even if only a dollar or two.
Thank you for sharing this. I donated to help him out. The least I can do to pay back the farmers out there.
Wow sori for You 😢😢
Install a security camera inside and outside of the place, and a fire alarm.Amcrest security camera is the best , built quality and very good software.
What happened?! What caused it?! The value of the tractors they have would've been higher like the one in the back !
Equipment needs to be distributed among several buildings to reduce risk of fire loss!
from an aussie ,who when all the bitching is done aboutsome US crazyness ,when push comes to shove ,really love your people and the great republic and would consider it a privaleged and incredible opportunity ,for such a low price ,contribute in such a way as to make this a GREAT day for you if we follow @virtuestreams2616 6 hours ago.absolutely TOP suggestion . i'm not a subsciber but have come off a farming and grazing property and take very seriously our delightful obligation of lending a hand to those in time of need . and this is one of those times .and like  @virtuestreams2616 says if we all contribute we can collectively make a hell of a difference .which gives me a huge sense of achievement and good vibes .it's an opportunity to be good people and strike a blow for righteousness against so much evil that's happening in the world .and it's so bloody easy to do in these times .2 or 3 mouse clicks and it's done . people helped my family when we were farming when the shit hit the fan .when i contributed maybe half an hour ago it was up to 60K
#simplysafe
Just did what I could on behalf of y'alls channel.
Farming is beautiful, it's therapeutic too, hard work also, but without farms then there's no food and then obviously without that then you can't live. It takes decades to build up a farm like that and we ought to chip in and help. Keep us updated on this, thanks
Donation sent from here in Kearney ❤
Laura if you do a twerk ,I will donate $$$$$
Please talk about this disaster a few times later to see how it seems to come out.  A lot of us are interested even though we can't really help.
I am truly sorry for the loss these people are suffering. They lost absolutely everything and that's so sad.Farming is difficult enough without  a  horrible thing like this to happen. Prayers are going out you guys.
Brad should be happy he is still alive.Donate to me cause Im broke,I only got $10 dollar.
Have you ever looked into a fire sprinkler system for your buildings you could put a dry system in we have at my work where there is no heat
Why would you say that this could happen to you.... If you protected your equipment with the proper backup systems and protection it would not happen to you so let me ask you this why do you think this could happen to if you're doing the things you're supposed to be doing to be responsible and protect your assets???? Let's hear you say we have alarm systems in fire extinguishers so this could never happen to us.. Let's think of all the potential causes right now and then take measures right now to reverse the potential things from having a chance to take hold.... How simple can you ge??? It's kind of like wearing eye protection... Eye Care starts with I care.,... If you lose one eye you've only got one left... I have an eye problem..... I can't see  not telling you about these things...
Domination sent, Thanks Laura for spreading the tragedy.
I know exactly how that feels. Christmas Eve 2018 our shop burned down with 6 tractors, 3 pickups, 2 trucks, machine shop equipment, lathe milling machine, welders and all the shelves of parts like bearings, chains, filters, ect ...  Even months after that if you look to were the shop used to be you get emotional
Laura, you need to install battery cut off switches and a sprinkler system, learn from this.
A devastating fire and all that equipment and years of work destroyed. Prices for similar equipment replacement here in Australia would almost be double in Australian Dollars!
Tragic
He must have crappy insurance then.
I want help but I do wonder why insurance won’t cover this loss? Why pay into it for years if they won’t replace what you lose? Just curious
Very sad I would start thinking about fire protection sprinklers!!!
It’s hard to explain the emotional impact this event has on a farmer.  We could the impact it has on you but can’t imagine how your neighbor feels.  Thanks for sharing.  Some of us know what it’s like on the farm.
What caused the fire?? ☹️
First off, I’m gutted at this loss. I can’t even begin to imagine. I want to echo what a few others have said—as a fire alarm installer, I cannot stress enough the importance of having a fire alarm/fire suppression system in a commercial building. It can not only save your belongings, it could save a life. Praying for Mike and his family. Thanks for sharing Laura/Grant.
Your the greatest, Grant,  your dad and you.  I follow your dad's channel also and where he has helped others.   Farmers helping farmers. I give thanks that no one was hurt   🙏.   My God be with this family through this trying time.
The cost you mention for the equipment sound reasonable (reasonable?) for today, in Canada for example a 2017 John Deere  S680 lists at around $565,000  and a 2021 John Deere X9 1100 lists at $865,000 and you get more for your grain than we do.  That said, a fire is a terrible thing to go through for any farmer, (speaking from experience) I wish him well.
Thank you for letting us know and the link to the go fund me.  Would you consider a fire alarm system for your barns to detect and annunciate when a fire is detected (early warning system)?   They cost less than a fire suppression system?
thank the lord no lives were lost
@FarmRescue could help getting harvest done.
Great video, Could you let us know how he or people help with his harvest?
Millennials make the biggest deal out of everything. Do you actually think this is first time this has happened?
Oh NOOOO, may our Father help this battler get back up again !
😂😂😂 insurance isn’t going to cover it all, so he didn’t have insurance.
Why wouldn't insurance cover everything? Anyone care to explain?
Don't know what to say one good thing no life was lost it's probably going to take a long time to replace rebuilt please anybody can help please do so please all farmers please help him🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😎🇺🇸
Donated and prayers to a speedy recovery 👍🏻🇺🇸
Should consider a fire sprinkler system with that much equipment. Would also lower your insurance premium.
with so much expensive equipment why is not a fire suppression system a high priority ? (its a genuine question)
Prayers for all
Is there a way to get something going at husker harvest days .
we cant hardly hear you
very tragic
Wow! Such a loss. Laura you got me choked up and teary eyed. Thank you so much for this sad information. I think you were choking up and near tears yourself.
Get ahold of Farm Rescue! They are there to help!
Lost my farmhouse a few years back. Years later I still look for things then realize it was in the house. So many little things gone that aren't apparent in the moment. Was relieved when it wasn't the dairy barn. Or the machine shed. Still doing camper life while building a house and paying off debts. Farm still has to keep rolling even when the sky falls
I made a donation this morning and just now checked go fund me. It’s growing fast and nearly all mention Laura Farms! You’re a good friend a neighbor!
Oh my good
Why will insurance cover this???
How about "Farm Rescue" ?
Hope you are doing well sorry for lost hang in there
Im sorry 😢. Smile 😂
I'll bet we can help exceed the $100,000 goal...
Laura if you messaged me a few minutes ago I don’t know how to respond except this way.
"Insurance isn't even going to cover what was lost..."  What a scam. This country is so greedy and broken.
Sorry to hear
Confused why insurance won’t cover it?….no safety systems?, sprinklers?, smoke detectors?….poor chap though, wonder what caused it?
Your neighbor is very lucky in one aspect Laura, he has good people like you and Grant that are willing to help and assist, God gave him you two people to help him. God Bless both of you guys 🙏🙏🙏🙏 will be sent by me to that man.
This is happening too many times to be coincidence.
That hurts to see that I am very sorry to see this
He should have some kind of insurance on that right
So sorry to see this. It may be a good time to add a fire suppression system to the shed.
So sorry for this Farmers loss of building and machines and tools accumulated over the generation. I hope a giant lottery winner sees this and does what only the ultra-rich can do.  Farmers Farm for the U.S.A. and others.
My heart goes out to Mike, his family and everyone that is part of his world. Incredible loss and very hard work gone in the blink of an eye. I hope he gets all the help he needs to rebuild and move forward. I hope you have updates as they come with the progress. Sending prayers, and I hope deep pockets come his way. I'm sorry for this
For of aww so sad ty for sharing my beautiful spirit family 🌱🌳❤3love TRUTH offers PEACE
Farm Rescue - right away!!
As an insurance fire investigator, I wish farmers would install heat detectors and security cameras.  Someone needs to invent non-flammable tires, cause once a big tire gets going, it's over.
I just donated. Thanks for getting the word out to help these heroes of America! Farmers feed America.
We've been through a fire, didn't loose nowhere like him but it's still is devastating. Prayers go out to him and his family, God will help be there for them.
Good luck I can't get anyone to donate to my GoFundMe I'm battling lung cancer and can't get any one to help I would help if I could
If this is a farm that is so important to the countries farm economy. This is a no brainer here help is needed and should come swift and in fast huge wave. No BS.. The government the local government should step up here and help these folks out. This is all our problem here. We all use these commodities and need them daily. Help.
I'm kind of glad my micro farm is small enough that I don't have to worry about a lot of expensive equipment.  Maybe one day, I'll have that problem.
About 40 years ago, we had a shed burn 1 night in Dec. It wasn't our workshop, simple storage, no electric. The tractor we had parked in one of the doors had a battery cable catch fire. Only losses were the tractor itself (old Case 2470 4wd. 1 of 2 we had), and a Tye 20' drill we used to plant soybeans, we drilled all of our beans. The disc hitched to the tractor wasn't even seriously damaged, only had to replace the hydraulic hoses connected to the tractor. Even were  able to repair the shed, still there, even though we aren't farming anymore. Farmers from Nebraska to Indiana have dealt with this for ever. Thoughts and prayers for all.
So sad, Prayers out to the family
This is common . We have a dedicated Air compressor with a 1"line ... every machine gets blown down before parking up for the night .  It should be mandatory
Probably not the right time but I have to say stop using vise grips to hold battery cables to battery posts. This is a result of exactly what can happen. In a pinch to finish a job or get your piece of equipment out of a field and back to the ranch is understandable but please fix the problem correctly the first opportunity you have. I gave what I could afford to Mike...
Credit to Laura and Grant for putting light on this tragic loss. I can't imagine the stress. At least there were no injuries. I am not a farmer but live in a semi-rural area in NY. Farms all around. Hope my small contribution helps.
Anything under a roof I would have a battery disconnect on. Hope everything works out for him.
My prayers are with the family that lost their farm, here in Vermont I know all to well about losing a farm we lost a small dairy farm that housed 140 Jersey cows plus equipment above the barn and most of the cows I raised from calves....it was and still so heart wrenching ....
Does his insurance have a limit??!!
Iam so sorry I will pray for him and his family
Very toubling. Perhaps the insurers should consider giving discounts on the premiums if you fit fire supression systems in your buildings.
Can I send a check.
'Farm Rescue
What a sad loss. Thanks for sharing this and the costs of farm equipment I don't think you were bragging at all people don't realize the money farmers invest. Prayers for Mike and his family
Donation sent.  It's going to be a tough recovery.
Just donated. Never have before. Anything helps
well its to bad what happend. I just read the article on line and said he lost estimated 2 million but says be is probably underinsured. And will have to pay out of pocket.  My question is why would you have everything under value incase something goes wrong you never know this day age. I am a business owner and the last 3yrs my insurance has tripled in value cause every year i have to increase my equipment amount.  Thats a very big risk having it underinsured . And i hope he comes out of it ok.
I'm so sorry, Laura. So sad.
I can’t begin to imagine how heart breaking this must be.  I thought both of you were so sensitive the way you portrayed mikes story.  What is frightening is the terrifying power of fire.  Regards to Mike.  And I’m sure you’ll answer this, but where can I go to make some form of help.
For those of us who don't do money electronically, can we send a check to  Laura Farms PO Box 536  Aurora, NE 68818 ???
Just found the Go-Fund-Me page for Mike.  If he and his family is anything like you and Grant, and your Dad, he deserves my support.  Thanks for sharing his story.  I’m sure he will rebound from this diversity.  You know that old saying.  If it dosen’t kill you, it makes you stronger.  All you folks are inspirational.  Thanks.
Hope they have insurance
I’m really sorry to hear about the fire. Stay strong and think positive and rebuild stronger than before.
How does a metal building with mostly metal in it cause so much damage?
Sending prayers out for Mike and his family 🙏🙏🙏
Donation sent, Praying for the family to get back on the feet as painless as possible.
what a terrible loss was an insurance contractor for many years and saw this countless times hope he gets back on his feet quickly make sure your insurance is enough and up to date and install fire suppression if you are able to
Laura that was a really bad situation for the farmer and would be for anyone. Way back in 1974 I was sleeping in the sleeper of a one year old International cab over truck that caught on fire. Earlier that day I had washed all the oil off the engine and frame. That might of caught on fire. It was a battery cable that was installed threw the frame of the truck that had worn the insulation off and arched against the frame. All the wiring burnt off. Saying this as it thought me a big lesson and since then I check all battery cables and double insulate any spot that might cause an issue. Very sad for this farmer and his loss. May God be with all of you and keep your chin up. Actually there is nothing more dangerous than the electrical on any equipment and is the most overlooked. Blessings
I’d love to donate but not with go fund me 😡 👿
So sorry for the loss of that man’s farming equipment and barn, if I could help I would but unfortunately I can’t.
What about a fire system
My uncle's farm got wiped out and leveled by a tornado back in the late 70's. It was like walking through a warzone total loss from the house to the outbuildings to livestock and all the equipment. You will never fully recover from the initial financial loss but over all the rebuilt operation is better and more efficient than what was there to begin with. Insurance will only cover about half of what replacement costs. I feel for the man but I have faith that they will eventually recover. They did not get all those things by being lazy. Best of luck and good wishes to the family.
Contact "Millenial Farmer" who had the same video not too long ago - Farmers helping Farmers.
I feel so sorry for this guy, it's a lot of money and the best thing is that he or anyone else isn't hurt or dead.   This would also be a good time for farmers to think about having some kind of automatic sprinkler system put in where they store equipment.   Knowing the farming community everyone will pitch in with the harvest.
a half million wont cover much on the farm,,,,thanks for filling in the blanks for most of us,,,,i knew a little but too little of what we were looking at on farms near me and your situation,,,,no bragging was here,,,just information that we all appreciated,,,,,takes lots of hard work and several lifetimes to accumulate to this point,,,,and in an instant,,,you could be killed by a simple mistake, or your whole place burn up in a prairie fire, or storm or drought or a million and one minor things could wipe it alllll away....thanks for your presentation and your hard work and loooong hours in keeping this nation moving and fed,,,
He MUST get a public adjuster. They will get him more money. That is a start. Then, go fund me will help too.
Not a farmer so may be way off-base with this but you would think insurance companies could help subsidies the cost of some sort of fire suppression system for the buildings. Would be cheaper than paying out money to replace equipment. Again, not a farmer so I don't have a clue.
How does that petite body of yours contain your massive heart? You and Grant are the best friends and neighbors anyone could ever hope to have.  God bless you both!❤
I wish I could help…. ☹️  o e thing I've always respected about farmers is there capacity to help one another.  I wish him luck and will be sending up prayers for him and his family.
Guys, plz concider spending some money on having some fire fighting measures in your hangars. This investment will pay off in times like this. I'm sorry for his loss. I ll try and help with a donation.
Say that the loss in building and equipment was $2,000,000 and the insurance company only paid out $1,500,000 can the farmer record a $500,000 loss on his taxes?
Laura and Grant...kudos for what you do...feel so awful for what Mike is going through as a fellow farmer that would suck!

Your whole life is in those buildings, I've seen news of tornados and storms destroying these building and feel for you guys.
I wish I could help but I am on disability
Why would you not have full coverage insurance
Thank you Laura for sharing  Mikes storey. Tom up in Canada in the Maritimes at the NB-NS border.
Help him harvest and take your cut
Sorry to hear this
Fire sprinklers,you really should think about it
Bummer, thats horrible . . .   Thoughts to him, his family, and their operation . . .
Devastating.  As a farmer in Alberta I can't imagine .All our equipment is basically 20 years old and I know what that costs little lone brand new stuff. God Bless you sir.
Farm focus will help with harvest. The millennial farmer is where I heard about them.
Shared the GoFundMe to my Twitter
Thank you for sharing this tragic story.  I am so sorry for this farmer's loss. It is certainly to contact the farmer's resource network,  and other charities that assist farmers in crisis.  I am sure there are neighbors who can loan some implements and help with harvest.  Farmers seem to have an uncanny ability to face adversity and rise like a phoenix rising from the ashes. I am deeply touched by the way farmers look out for one another.
Put a call into Farm Rescue, they help farmer in just these circumstances
Fire ems
Laura, you hit on a very good point. Most folks know nothing about the cost of farm equipment. I would guess it was a real eye opener for some folks. Hope Mike is able to recover his losses.
Laura.... Bragging is if ALL your n Grant's equipment was spanking bran new, your equipment is fairly new, but you guys have worked hard 2 get where you are..... Dont forget 2 get yourself a good fite alarm (their some good wireless systems out there) sbd maybe consider some kind of extinguisher system... In the long run, the investment of a fire suppressing system can be the differens between a total loss abd minor damage, abd the difference between keep on farming or bankruptcy...  Stay safe out there ❤❤❤
Why would anyone cram everything you own under one roof crammed so tight they were touching  just seems odd why would you do that ???
What a bad way to get people to watch your videos
One source of fire is the batteries.... I highly recommend a MAIN DISCONNECT SWITCH ON ALL YOUR EQUIPMENT AND GET IN THE ROUTINE TO SHUT THE ELECTRIC OFF
Merci pour cette vidéo très pénible mais je suis sur que vous allez surmonter cette situation grave bon courage à vous deux un bonjour du Québec
Kinda a shitty video go and to be in all of their business
I am so so sorry  for your loss
thank you for advocating for your neighbor....doing what good neighbors do. Bless you. The organization that does harvest for farmers (featured on Millenial) should be notified and applied for this coming harvest. That would help a lot.
All of you farmers every month take a video walk through of your shops/Hangers/barns so you can show what was in those sheds/barns.    You have proof of tools and power tools!!!!! Along with all the equipment!!!!  Might be silly but it helps insurance companies. Now with cell phones way easier.  A farmer I watch on you tube...NOT MY LAURA.....another one talks about Simply Safe( I HAVE NO AFFILAITION) but they have all those alarms that can maybe help you save your barns and equipment.......and home........I only mention it because that farmer has mentioned how they saved their house  and SHED(LARRRGGGGEEE ONE)  with the alarms they can install......WATER leaks.......Fire....Temperature....Intrusion......think about it ...it might give the extra time to save your livelihood!!! Or look at one of those alarm companies.  That is no way KNOCKING MIKE I just mean for all of you that have farms and do not have a thing in place that might give you extra time maybe to put out the fire. LAURA AND GRANT SO NICE OF YOU TO HELP Mike!!!!!!!!  MIKE HANG IN THERE!!!!!!   Saying a prayer for you and your farm.
You need better audio I have you Bluetooth through my stereo and volume cranked to infinity and can barely hear you
The picture is click bait  Laura which is as false as your inappropriate clown eyelashes when discussing something this serious.
Farmers, always review your farm/corporation insurance policies..... Full replacement plus RIDERS to cover what the main policy doesn't.  Shit happens and never get it wrong and never get it done
As if farmers don`t have enough to worry enough then this happens, so very sad.
you're a god kid, Laura.
My Brother helps run a Family Farm so I have seen some of the equipment necessary to do that.  Thank You
I would lose sleep over it.   That is not a tragedy if no one was hurt.   Just call insurance
It’s hard not to tear up looking at that gut punch of a loss! 🙏🙏🙏
Bless you Laura and Grant.  Sharing this story will help.
Makes me think  a battery disconect on all machinery, would be a very cheap investment!!!!
Trust me. Drop the spider webs.
Our neighbor got hit by a tornado and i feel what you feel
Omg a battery cable caused this tragedy???  Oohhh😮😮 Sue the company if it was the cable? Im so sorry to everyone impacted by this. Prayers go out to all.
Manual battery disconnects are a must on all equipment. Our family lost a shop and commercial trucks from cable fire 20 years ago at night. Now Everything gets manual shutoff switches. My condolences to the fellow who lost his Equipment to the hell fire. Ps: install those manual disconnect switches as close to the battery as you can.
Crazy how a couple hours of a fire can reduce millions of dollars of various equipment down to hundreds to thousands in scrap metal.
So sorry for the loss he suffered and the pain he will go through even with insurance getting back up to speed. Laura, do y'all consider things like fire alarms and automatic fire suppression systems on your large buildings?
Great way to use your platform! Bless you and bless them. Donation made.
One thing I have learned over the years and still do  today is if we have a car or truck in our shop we disconnect the negative battery cable to kill all power to the unit to be worked on Now I know that these big tractors and it would be a pain but if you're not using the unit and it can sit for a long time why not take that factor into play for safety reason I know in my shop everything has no power unit I turn it on and it is clean and rags are fireproof containers and what I am saying is it does not take much to start a fire and just a though to help everyone
Aluminum melts at 1220 farenhet
You should have monetized this video and given all the proceeds to him then even if we couldn't financially help we would have helped in a small way
Laura,  My wife and I have been watching your channel for about a year or so.  We are not farmers, but find your channel very entertaining and informative.  We live in Lincoln NE.  The episode for Mike was so well done, and in no way did you come off as bragging about the cost of farm equipment. I am sure your subscribers will be very generous to help Mike through go fund me. Both you and Grant are very caring and compassionate people.  Thank you both for taking the time to help out a fellow farmer and Nebraskan.
Brought a tear to this tough old birds eye.  Good luck Mike.
Hope we can get regular updates on this
sharing this on Twitter.. or X or whatever it is!  heartbreaking!
It happened to us about 10 years ago. An we took are insurance off day before. Part of life. We are still farming. But lost alot of land
May God bless Mike and his family.
How horrible, I really hope this community is able to come through for Mike. This is definitely a wake up call on putting all of your equipment in one building. You may want to look into getting a foam suppression system for your buildings, so if god forbid there is a fire, it can be extinguished before too much damage is done. Stay strong and be safe!
Can you install a fire suppression system?
With the investment and time involved in any farming endeavor, how cost effective would it be to install a fire suppression/sprinkler system in the building the equipment is stored in and could it lower insurance costs.
Time to order a pallet of those fire extinguisher balls with their mounts and mount them all over in the rafters of the buildings.
thanks for your helping spread the word
I feel so sorry for his loss but in the same frame of mind shop safety is always a must because it does not take long for a fire to start  and to lose everything and I am sure we will do what we can to help but people all over the USA are hurting so like I said it takes a village some time and pray for the best for him and his family
That is so sad
Thanks!
Today's farmers are usually big operations. So I would consider anyone in farming today has substantial monies tied up in so much equipment. Much larger investment then what my granddad or my uncle had back in the 30s-60s.  So sorry for your friends loss. It has to be gut and heart wrenching. Thankful no loss of life. But for him to restart at ground zero is almost an impossible burden. I will lift him and family in my prayers.
Laura, are you familiar with Millennial Farmer? Maybe you can post this in his channel
Can't give much but i will definitely be donating to the go fund me. Hopefully they are able to raise enough to replace everything lost.
What a devastating fire.  I grew up on a farm and my brother, nephew and thier families run the farm today.  All of the big equipment loss will hopefully be covered well by insurance.  But finding replacement equipment, especially in the middle of summer is a massive challenge.  I find it almost more sickening to see the loss of all the smaller tools, shop equipment, spare parts, special tools, etc.  It will be so difficult to document all of that loss.  And we know that the farmer will have to likely make hundreds of special trips to hardware stores, parts dealerships, and such over the next decade to replace, one by one, all of those smaller things when he realizes that he needs some special tool that was apparently lost in the fire.
I'm glad they're ok.  It's a hard way to be reminded. Don't under value your insurance.  Also fitting fire detection and suppression equipment is a must, regardless of that it's expressive to have sprinkler systems.  We had our insurance person in yesterday and total loss replacement costs is something she talked about. And it adds up quickly for just a machine shop.  As hard as it is. I would recommend everyone sit down and work out the new replacement costs are for at least all of the major equipment. Even if that means calling your local dealer out to get guide prices.
Thank you for sharing this, Laura and Grant. God bless you!
Insanity.  Followers, neighbors,  strangers.  Let's just help.  Its horrible.  Hopefully,  hail didn't come and his field's  are standing.
The guy made an error and it came back to bite him.  The are no accidents.  There must be a cause.
Laura. You are helping in a huge way. Prayers are powerful! And if we can't do anything else, our prayers will definitely help.
Donated. Sorry for his loss😢
I am sorry to see the devastation ..   It is terrible ...My wife passed away a few months ago.   I donated all of  the clothes and  many other items to charity at the time ..  If I had not done that ,I would load them all up and  drive them  to you in Nebraska ..  They could do what they wanted with the clothes and  other items..   A garage sale or such if they couldnt use them..Years ago we had a similar accident in the town we lived in   .. The community got together and  took donations  from businesses and individuals of everything imaginable and  held a city wide garage sale with all of the proceeds going to the family ..   We were able to give them  Thousands of dollars ..    Good Luck
Fire suppression is an important topic if L&G can get to it.  None of these safety features (insurance, fire systems, etc.) are inexpensive nor are the fail-safe.  I just had visions of the irrigation sprinkler heads you had salvaged from a recent video.  I know - not the same thing.
Thanks for this video Laura.  Thanks for telling this story. Is important for people to understand mike ‘s loss in terms of dollars investment in machinery.  Prices are high right now. Hard to replace machinery.   I am sending my prayers and blessings to mike and his family. Will also help on the you fund me posting.  Would farm rescue be able to help?????  Thanks again Laura for telling this story. Prayers to Mike.   Thanks Laura.  The Iowa Farm Boy. Steve.
God bless
So sad .I'm see every thing fire farm equipment
i have been through a total loss, insurance doesnt cover all losses and the personal toll the process takes on the individual is almost as bad as the fire.   if anyone can help, please do what you can...
I worked at a case dealership for a while! One day the owner fired up his welder! I was working on a tractor laying on the floor! The explosion was deafening! Everything above shoulder height was on fire! The oxy-acetalene tank wasn't shut off the night before and leaked out overnight! The whole building was on the ground in 30 minutes! Insurance was a nightmare! I lost thousands of dollars in tools in that time! Also all the equipment that he couldn't replace! He had a heart attack right after this happened!
What a great loss. Our prayers are with them. Thanks for airing this.👍🙏❤️
I will share the story hope it helps I have a few followers but but supporters of u and grant
Maybe a dry sprinkler system in the main barn would be something to think about....  Sorry for your friends loss....
🚜Gran video Mi like ❤✌💪🏽👍👍👍👍👍
So, not discounting what happened,  but wouldnt it be worth it to  get a  sprinkler system installed?  I would think the cost to do that would pay for itself after a few yrs of lower insurance premiums
I hope that the two of you have a serious fire suppression system in place in and around all of your shop buildings and silo areas. This could happen to anyone at anytime. I hope that the insurance companies will be fair with him especially now when he is in such desperate need of help.
I love that you're showing this destruction like this because it is really really bad. But I got to say this.. and I'm not truly criticizing but I could hardly hear what you're saying and I got my volume turned all the way up. God bless these people and I hope they get all the help that they need. Because you're right insurance doesn't cover the cost of all this loss. People basically pay their insurance. Month after month year after year. And when you total up all that they have spent Insurance wise for coverage.. what they have spent most likely for Insurance Coverage, was more than what they'll ever see in any damage that they would occur. Or recover. It's a necessary evil. You're danged if you do and you're danged if you don't !  SMH - Sending Prayers 🙏🙏🙏
I can’t help him monetarily I’m afraid, but I will share this on Twitter and Facebook
Donation coming from Alabama. Growing up on a dairy farm i know he will probably never fully recover from this. Best of Luck to him.
Go find me
Was there lithium batteries in that building?  What can burn in farm equipment?  Metal doesn't burn like that.
I get it I worked in a family owned print shop where a single press could be over 2 million, the cost of business can be insane.
Tragic but this is what insurance is for. It’s certainly good of you to help a neighbor out.
LF Family! 5,10,100.... 50k views on this video so far, kick in a little!!
Laura, first of all you are safe 💖. Hopefully your insurance will cover most of your loss.  This is the last thing I could imagine happing to your farm. Please keep me updated. Loving you from Texas 💕.
It's a hard pill to swallow . Your insurance should have current replacement costs , not for actual value. I had a wood working business and that is what I had, and still do on my house.
I get what Grant is saying about his pickup.  I have an old Kawasaki Bayou that I can barely keep running but I've tried 6 other quad bikes  and none of them work around my Orchard as well as the Bayou does. Trouble is they are near obsolete here in NZ
Man so sorry all I can do is pray
That’s total devastation. Just how does one begin to start over again? My sincere condolences in this situation. Just hope there’s no personal injury. Thanks for sharing. Following from Sydney Australia.
Could it possibly be worth the money to put in building sprinkler systems or even more sophisticated fire suppression systems. Just thinking out loud.
Donation and heartfelt best wishes on the way.  Much love from balmy Arizona where we don't need a fire to melt things.
you have such a big heart. This is just devastating. Prayers for Mike.
STOP INSERTING YOURSELF INTO THIS TRAGEDY JEEES !!!!!!!!!
Probably around a 2000F fire.
Lamento las enormes perdidas, mucha suerte en su recuperacion
Pull the batteries out all equipment that not in use on the farm.devastating for the farmer and his family.
I’m so sorry
Atleast he had insurance i cant even afford insurance on my house !
Very nice of you to use your channel to help out a fellow farmer.
Donation sent. Glad to help out our farmers.
GIRL DON"T SCARE ME LIKE THIS!!!!!!!
Very heart felt, I never give money to go fund me but Laura, you are one that I wouldn't want to bargain with because saying no would be too hard.
thanks Laura and Grant for sharing this... Just donated and am sending prayerful thoughts to mike and his family.....
I’m curious as to if a battery disconnect on the tractor would have prevented the fire?
BIDEN'S INFLATION HAS MADE EVERYTHING GO UP 10%-40%. 🤢
the farms i worked on we had 2-3 water trucks one was 10,000gal the other two was 4500gal they stayed on the farm they had water pumps on them with hoses came in handy a few times on the farm with equipment an on other farms near bye
You did good with this vid kid.
I hate fires im helping a giy that lost his house to a fire thar was started by the SUN  light. Yes i said the SUN light .    So sad to see this video . Sending prayers
Prayers go out to Mike and his family.   In a world where most everything is taken for granted, know there are still people out there who appreciate farmers and the life your work allows us to have.  Laura/Grant, bless you for having the kind hearts to help Mike and his family by spreading the word.
To be honest on if that tractor is what started the fire then that company should be responsible for paying for the damages there. The biggest problem companies have today. Is they always want more electronics and technology on any vehicle built. But they never fix or improve their mistakes from previous vehicles that had electrical issues and fires. Only a couple of things would make a battery cable get to hot with vehicle or in this case tractor that’s not even running.
I am curious about something and hoping maybe someone going through the comments will chime in.  I thought of it while watching the video and i saw a couple comments about fire sprinklers. I realized that i dont think ive ever seen fire suppression in a machine shed or shop. Is there a reason for this other than cost? I know a lot of farm machinery is used to being rained on, so i would think that sprinklers would be fine, to at least keep adjacent objects cool and slow the spread. I wonder what implications there are, if any, with such a system and insurance coverage. If it had to be foam rather than water for the nature of equipment fires, would that still result in a total loss of the equipment but maybe not the structure? I sound incredibly dumb to myself as i type this, but this is one thing that i know absolutely nothing about. Thank you to anyone that might read this and reply!!
Meanwhile, his crops still need to be tended ...  If your community is like the one I grew up in, there will be people showing up to help him handle that part.  And then, three years from now, he will go searching for that tool he remembers getting for just the thing he's trying to get done, and fall to his knees and cry. After a minute or two, he'll stand back up and figure out a different way to get it done.  Prayers for Mike, his family, and the entire community. As you said, this can happen to anyone, and it's not just the financial loss.
I hope yall look into fire extinguishing system for your barn.
LITHIUM BATTERIES HAVE BEEN STARTING ALOT OF FIRES. 🤔
In Norway the farmer will have no loss if he is insured. So why does AMERICANS have that problem?
You should ask Farm Rescue...
Hope he recovers from this and I am sure he will if everyone rallies round, good luck and God bless you all
Oh my goodness within a few minutes of your posting the go fund me account has skyrocketed. You, Grant and your YouTube channel are to be commended….again. Thank you for all you do.
Quality American tractor, sorry I hear this all the time. They are just as prone as anything else. I hope he was well insured and you are back up and running soon. Cheers man devastating loss.
My dad only had a tiny farm as a hobby for tens of years (17 acres?) with an 'old' Ford 2000 tractor and an MF. Big stuff (wagon dumper, combine, etc.) were 'rented' just during the season. As a teenager I often helped him during the summer. Great memories and some character building.  The barn he rented sadly was struck by lightning. With almost all equipment lost . It was painful to see all that devastation. It still hurts to have lost that old Ford.  He did buy an MF back and some equipment. But some years later sold it and the land.  Just the past year he bought a Ford somewhat similar to what he used to have. But it's not at all the same.  I feel for Mike and his family. As a fan of yours (refusing to use Patreon, sorry) I gave a small donation from across the big pond.
Makes you want to park outside doesn't it.
Retired farmer, I get it... donated....
shared on facebook Laura   tell mike so sorrry for his loss. being a fireman I know how he feels and definatelly low the cost of equipment. Firetrucks cost in the millions for one truck.. My family worked a 725 acre corn and celery farm in fla so I know what his loss is. I know farmers friends will help Mike thru the season.
I KNOW IT!S TO LATE NOW BUT I LEARNED NOT TO STORE ALL OUR EQUIPMENT IN ONE BUILDING /YEARS AGO 50 PLUS MY PARENTS HOUSE BURNED TO THE GROUND /FORTUNATELY OUR EQUIPMENT SHEDDS WERE SEPARATED ENOUGH SO THEY DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE /OBVIOUSLY FIRE OR TORNADOS CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME /SO KEEPING SPACE BETWEEN BUILDING SEEMS A PRUDENT INVESTMENT
Donation sent. Stay strong.
😢😢😢❤❤❤❤🤝🤝🤝💑 solo uso guasa o tlf.❤❤
hope its ok but i did share this on my facebook page , i got a lot of farmers and rich people on my page so maybe they can help with donating to the go fundme . the front tire on yout 8335r looks like  its starting to bulg, i also learned they dont give face value  they give what its worth at the time you bought it to replace it even if you can find somthing for that price.
Millennium farmer knows how to get ahold of farm rescue, and they can hear with harvest
My diesel truck burnt barn down
Thanks!
This is certain stomach and heart wrenching. A farmer that I know of here in Central Kansas has a tractor/planter set up that costs over $1M. Every aspect of farming is expensive but most dont know just how expensive it is. This is probably not just horrific but also traumatizing for their family. I know for a fact that i would have night mares about the sounds and sights of that night.
3 years ago I had the same thing happened at 4am my diesel pickup emission started   the fire many diesels have caused these fire..
The truth about Farmers is that they are Filthy Rich only in Equipment.   They really don’t have a bunch of money.
Almost  makes ya wonder  what the point of insurance  is if they don't cover the loss when you need to file a claim
😮 Puuh
i posted this video on the latest welker farms video, and on cole the cornstar's latest, l hope it was OK to do so. as l know they have a big following. l wish all the best to mike and his family.
That’s the farmer in you.yes this is the saddest video you have put out.but as a farmer you are trying to help one of your neighbors anyway you can. Thank You for that. I hope your video does help that farm family. Having had some major fires on our dairy farm. Asking for help is a hard thing for farmers to do.
Very heartfelt and moving.  Thank you for sharing this story.
I've been in areas devastated by wildfire.  You know a fire is hot when aluminum is not only melted, but VAPORIZED.  This fire looks to have been near that temperature.  As for the steel there, all of it is just scrap--the heat was more than enough to take all of its temper.  This is truly a tragic loss.
Thanks for sharing Laura! Go fund me makes it so easy to help.. I encourage those of you who may be apprehensive, if we all donate a little we can collectively make a huge difference.
Stay vigilant and take nothing for granted. Crazy destruction. I hope he rebounds ok
Laura your a special person god bless you!
Praying 🙏 for the best to you * you're family... Mike ... so thanking Laura * her husband * their social media influences... may God bless
Bravo you two!!!! You truly are a class act! Tactfully and thoughtfully done! Couldn't have been an easy thing to do!! Peter
Thanks Laura for this video.  I've been through a fire and was burned badly myself.  I had lots of help and am to this day so grateful for it.  So easy to donate, took me less that 20 seconds!  My 30 bucks are happily on their way!  God bless and keep our farmers safe.
I cried. It just went straight to my heart. Prayers to him and his family.
Reach out to Farm Rescue and see if they can help to get his fields Harvested
now that i think about it you said battery terminal i think. i have a shed with 2 Harleys in it my only transportation noy you have me freaking out. when not riding thay are hooked up to battery maintainers. for the last while when i use my favorite discounting the battery matainer it is hot. so won't use it till tomorrow get a new one.
As a clams adjuster I cannot stress enough to review every year with the insurance company the values of the equipment and if any new items have been purchased(tell them right away)
Wish I could help more but sent what I could. Scared me half to death when I saw the thumbnail. Thought it might be yours or your families. Neighbor is bad enough.
I have not written to you yet. I have been following you two for awhile and really enjoy your videos as well as your personalities. What comes to mind here is how you have been using vice grips on battery cables many times. It's OK for a temp. fix but, should not be used for any length of time. I sure as hell would not like this to happen to Laura farms farm. The best to you, Mike (Michigan)
Get in contact with Zack at Millennial Farmer. He promotes an organization that helps out farmers in this situation.
Deepest sympathies to Mike. Great setting up go fund me! As a retired FF I have to say I am surprised that more farmers and ranchers, storage/tool sheds and workshops do not have suppression sprinklers and smoke alarms that work. Breaks my heart to see such devastation!
Man what a blow.  Do any farmers have sensor operated deluge systems in their tractor barns?  The system represents a nominal initial cost, and would make watery mess, but, your equipment would have a better than even chance of survival.
Laura, thank you for doing this for Mike. I hope he can recover from these equipment losses.
Prays God lord be safe team work American Indian power at the best you know what they say by Russian equipment you get Russian ducks get my drift buy a Russian tractor they will see more Russians more Russian vodka you know what I say rum Russia is a good martini good Martini means take out more insurance you take out the more it pays out get my drifty rental insurance this ain't no accident go to the 4-H club start playing trees we'll get those tell me going to recycling plant next week
Regular, very regular re-evaluation of insurance coverage. Continuity planning and fire prevention. The rest is luck.
Make sure it gets a brittle insurance from State farm okay bye rental insurance
This would make me want to put a fire sprinkler system in these buildings! Fire detection alarms and security cameras, throughout your property too.... Think about this seriously, Grant and Laura!
Love hug
As an octgenerian on SocSec, the best I can do is post your video on social media. I spent several years in Centerville, Iowa and have some idea about family farming. I have great respect for farmers. Best of luck to Mike and to you folks.

theres more than vehicles in there, computer systems on the machinery, spair parts, fuel, lubricants, the buiding itself, all that scrap will cover less than 1% of the monitary loss...  this is the very reason that you need insurance no matter how much it costs always get insurance...
The last thing that I to do is make lite of a tragic incident such as this one , PERIOD  !!!!! Most farm accidents and , incidents occur because of complacency.. The lack of developing super good farming practices and , sticking to them . Not cutting corners and , doing the right thing just because it's the right thing to do . Farming is probably one of the most , if not the most dangerous profession in the world . By that same token , one of the most REWARDING professons to ones soul , in the world . That being said , checking out a tractor or , truck or , any vehicle  before starting it from the seat after you turn on the battery disconnect switch , PERIOD.. The battery disconnect switch should be turned to off every time the vehicle is parked . To stop the draw on the batteries to mitigate the chances of catastrophic incident .      Proper prior planning prevents piss poor performance , and kiss ( keep it simple stupid ) will help you to a better and safer future !!!!!
YALL IM SO SORRY
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oh these poor people... If your livelihood is a business that relies on expensive machines like a large grain operation, please buy insurance that comes close to replacement cost payouts. You may pay higher premiums but along with the extra write-off comes a huge peace of mind. Insurance costs are the last thing to cut for short term gain.  Like all insurance for disability and equipment, you get what you pay for. The cheapest policies usually force you to court in order to get payouts. Also: wifi fire detection systems should be installed in all your sheds.
can you put a sprinkler system in your barn/work buildings?
The farmers, ranchers of United States need to ban together and do a protest on our government because I am not lying to you when I tell you the government can and probably is behind this because they are doing the same thing in the Netherlands and the Netherlands are protesting their government because they are really and truly trying to take the farm and ranch Land away from the farmers and ranchers for what reason I have no idea but it’s best that we start trying to find out instead of allowing dairy farmers and farmers to have their cattle and equipment burnt alive in the tool shed and the milking houses
I hope they get there harvest in and enough money to restart...
Why did the fire start?
i dont trust insurance i was paying $6000 a year when the shop burt they said the shop was to old never got a penny i declaired bankrupt told the bank to collect from the insurance i cant afford lawyer both truck burt i owed 50000 that is in canada gentry and son got nothing insurance had some excuse the state is the same
A tire caused a massive fire means a defect in the tire. Go after the tire manufacturer to reimburse for the damages.
That is heartbreaking. Mind blowing how hot that fire was. Wish I could help, but being a disabled veteran funds are tight for me as is.
Don't appreciate negative comments about fire being set you never get ahead from insurance sprinkler systems would only work in heated shops lot of farm storage is cold storage and even alarm system probably only would of salvage partial it's hard to say but at least shouldn't be hard to settle with adjuster just write a check for what he was covered for the cleaning up bill will be big time is the best healer
i will share your video and the gofundme link
A suggestion:  if your barn-full-of-tractors catches fire, even during a hailstorm, try to move some of the tractors away from the barn.
Love hug be safe gun shot look in back door sleep xoxo
💔
The loss must be mind numbing. Why does "don't put all your eggs in one basket" come to mind?
Oh my lord. This poor family. Luckily noone got injured. Hope they can recover and have a good insurance.
this is utterly heartbreaking. there was a lot more lost here than just tools and equipment. the amount of blood, sweat and tears, not to mention all the stress and sacrifice are things no amount of money can replace. God bless this family.
That's a shame to lose the and  basically all the hard work that it took to acquire all of it. Won't be long before insurance companies require fire suppression systems in machine storage buildings. This has been happening all over along with many farms not having anything to harvest
God bless
Im sorry that this happened its a real shock to your system i hope the insurance will cover the replacment cost😢😢
Talk to Zac Millennial Farmer about Farm rescue!
How devistating 😢Thank you for getting the message out for a neighbor who needs help. ❤️
I donated, I truly wish you all luck and good health. BLESSED BE ⭐️
Time to think about a fire suppression system. The type used in gas stations would be best for your building.
Prayers to Mike and his family.   How awful , looks like he lost all his farm machinery. Hope he gets back on his feet soon.
That insurance check going to be nice huh?
I am a farmer from Kenya,I can feel the pain this colleague is undergoing and few people realize how hard farming is even without such an enormous loss
Hate to see that, Thanks for helping him.
Sounds like the battery cable was probably rubbing on some sharp edge, and over time it cut through the insulation, and then shorted causing the fire.  It's a good idea to check the battery cables periodically, but it might be a really good idea that every time you park one of these tractors that you disconnect the battery ground.  Or, alternatively, you install a battery disconnect that is accessible in the cab, and you can just shut off the power to and from the battery from the cab.  Battery disconnects are mandatory safety devices on most race cars, and that's why I know about them.  A small investment that could prevent a big loss.  In any case, I'm praying for them, and hopefully the gofundme campaign will raise all the money that they need, and of course I'll be praying that they reach the goal on the campaign and well beyond that.
I wish every Politician (especially ones from big cities) would be made to watch Laura and other ag and trucking creators videos. Every time they add some law or Executive Order it just makes things harder for these already hard working people.  Leave the Farmers to Farm, and Ranchers to Ranch, and truckers to truck,  and understand they are your food source. They are truly Salt of the Earth People.
just donated $20 from the UK, not a large amount but I hope it helps in some way
Liquid lightning f 150 melted!
Farmers get plenty of money from the Government.They always come back better after something like this..
Prayers for Mike and his family. He has a lot on his plate with harvest coming up and now this.. praying he and his get through all that's coming up well and good.  I don't mean to be a day late or for this to sound bad but, a proper sprinkler system (properly maintained, annual inspections, ect..)  should be a must for all you guys. The cost of installation would be less than the replacement costs of equipment and would add peace of mind. Again sorry to hear of Mikes loss, I wish you all well. PS, a properly installed sprinkler system should (you'd have to check with them) should, decrease the cost of the insurance.
add auto fire suppression system in the shop. its expensive but its the best insurance to have in the shop. something to think about.... hope Mike will recover and keep farm on.
Farmers shouldn't air up their tires with propane cause bad things can happen, even death!
Daddy's got deep pockets. And Great Insurance I'm Shure. Let's see you do Yoga.😊
what did i learn?  one big shed for everything is a bad idea.  i have a backhoe i was going to park in a carport next to my garage.  now i will just build a shed for it only.  and i will do the same for any future power equipment i purchase. better to have a bunch of small sheds with one piece of equipment stored in each one then to have something like this happen and lose everything.
Hi Guys, best wishes. I saw several posts about fire suppression systems, but what about a professional alarm company like Brinks?( that’s who I’ve been with for five years ) Brinks has professional grade smoke and other detectors and they call you right away in the event of an alarm drop.
scary how blessed you and Grant are. What is wonderful is the community coming together to accomplish a staggering goal. I remember being in Missouri when all the neighbors were coming down the road like and Army of Combines to clear crops. I was informed that everyone with equipment starts taking down everyones fields so everybody makes money, Hard to find that community in the world anymore. They will survive and grow with your help Laura! When I started watching I understood it was your Dad's farm, but I was looking at all teh equipment and It always looks serviced and new and Saw way over 20-30 million dollars and I thought, " How much harvest does it take to make a profit for that kind of overhead?" Your young and what a responsibility! Time to shine your light! No bragging going on. It's not necessary to explain explain how much equipment and hired hands to get the job done.
So very Sad.  Your stuff in that shop is likely worth over a Million.
I sent my light and love to him and his family
O good 😊. Sorry for the loss 💔.
"Farm Rescue"  -  https://youtu.be/UOAD0cmQWTg
I wish I could send the 1/2 million he needs.....farmers are necessary. Thanks Mike.
Awh , listen to Mikes voice,,, so sad
Battery cable on a tractor caused a spark that ignited the gas tank... in the middle of the night?🙄.... on a diesel fueled tractor?..🤨🤔.. I guess that will work.😉😆..He is very fortunate that they will pay out on his policy, though it is a very good illustration as to why you should always make sure that your policy limits are sufficient to cover your losses, in this case, he was penny-wise and pound-foolish imho. Just an additional thought,  with all of the electrical fires occurring on modern equipment, a battery shut-off switch might not be a bad idea as an added safety measure considering  the huge financial investment at risk.
I am sure it was insured?
So very sad, I sincerely hope this is not the end of the farm. I can’t even comprehend the feeling of a loss like this! Easily 3 to 4 million maybe more. I wish I could help but anything I could do would not amount to anything. Best of luck getting your life back together.
One thing you can think about is running a dry sprinkler pipe and heads through your shop’s. Run them out to a area close to you well house or header pipe for you and the fire department to hook up to to spray into the shed.  Just use the same thoughts and experiences as you would hooking up a pivot with all their sprayheads.
My thoughts and prayers to Mike and his family. Donation sent
Thanks for the cry.
I would seriously consider having several smaller equipment sheds instead of one or two large ones. If you're just using them to store equipment that isn't being used, you wouldn't even need insulation or a concrete floor in most of them. It may even cause your insurance premiums to go down.
What a devastating loss all traced back to a battery cable !!!!     Grant think about the vise grips on certain battery cable you are running !   No joke 😮!
I donated a Benjamin and challenge others who can afford it, to donate as well. When I was in high school, my family lost our home to arson, so I know how devastating it can be. Praying for Mike and his family in this situation.
Thanks!
Equipment and shop fires are not something to take lightly. My brother-in-law's father parked their combine in the shed in the evening last year. He returned the next morning to find the engine compartment and most of the rear had major fire damage. They were VERY lucky, the fire was contained to the combine only and slightly charred the ceiling of the building it was parked in. Fire put itself out. Combine is a very old model, and can't remember the brand. They are now in a country-wide search for replacement parts. Supposedly the engine is rebuildable, but Insurance is trying to repair rather than replace it.  Most don't realize you buy the combine, you buy a system. The heads and implements he has only fit that combine. if needs to go newer or a different model, all these items must be replaced. This is tens(or hundreds) of thousands of dollars HE would have to pay to replace the harvesting system.
ugh i hate that i bet is very stressful   not good thing
time for a fire alarm system
What caused the fire!!??
Had a building fire at the farm I worked at as a teenager. Burned the whole thing down, plus processing room, and burned up two walk in freezers which were loaded full of meat. Along with 2 cab overs, work van, tractors, etc. It was an awful sight.  I wont even park my tractor in my barn at the moment because the barn i have is not sound. Ive lost too much sleep just thinking if the roof caved in.
Praying for Mike and his family hopefully things will turn around for him and his family soon and great video keep up the good work God bless from GA stay safe
that hurts to look at , hope he can recover from this , donation send
I also want to add some advice regarding insurance.  Whenever you purchase items for the business, notify your insurance agent or the insurance company directly.  Especially in agribusiness insurance, the value of the coverage is dependent on audits completed of the equipment and property.  Let them know you have new or even used equipment that was just purchased.  Yes your premium will increase but it’s better than not having enough coverage if something catastrophic occurs.  I’ve had claims where a business was half a million to multiple millions uninsured, based on equipment inventories we did not have on file.  Also get your agent to visit you at least once a year to discuss your policy.  It’s important that they are providing the best service and making sure you have adequate insurance.
Sorry for Mikes loss! You guys need to put fire suppression system in your barn!!
Buy his farm land  it'll be cheap and and hell need the money because it will take him yeard to get back to where he was when your already set up
Any clue yet what happened?
Sorry for loss for him
Thanks for bringing this to our attention.  Farmers are some of the hardest working and selfless people out there.  Maybe we can give back just a small token of what you guys give us.
Wow what a loss so sad
Can fire protection be used in your warehouse where the equipment is stored? Thanks for sharing  prays go out truly sad.
Q perda trágica  semente perdas matérias,  mesmo assim  não fácil ver tantos anos de esforço se perdem em pouquíssimo tempo . Mesmo segurando nunca cobraria essa perda lamentável pela seguradora.  Orações Brasil 🇧🇷.
Prayers
My small donation has been sent Laura and Grant. Thanks for bringing the Schutte family's tragedy to light so that, we your viewers, can help too. I live in G.I. and this is the first I've heard of this. Your YouTube channel is not just entertaining but it can be a powerful tool to help a friend. Good job you guy's.
👋😊
Really appreciate you talking about money that goes into the farming!!!
Laura beautiful wonderful talk to me
Farm rescue might be able to help
Laura  a question . At videos of millennial farmer I saw farm rescue. A program to help farmers that are hit by misfortune. Is that not a option to help him.out with harvest??
Oh shit wtf how did it start? Lightening start?  All equipment & cars inside fir a hailer Damn.
So sorry for the loss glad no one was hurt . Now this is why you don’t put everything in the same shed My wife tries to get me to put my truck in the shop when calling for hail I won’t I rather let insurance fix the truck that the shop to crash on it during  the storm and again so sorry for His loss.
I wonder if smoke detectors as early warning are a thing? Exploding tires are too late a warning. What about sprinkler systems? In all the hundreds of farming videos i watched i have ever seen any of this. The most i see are buildings with wooden rafters without any fire protection at all. Just nothing. I think this is a lot of risk readily accepted given the amount of money stored in such buildings and the consequences. Insurance is obviously not the answer. Knowing all my eggs are in one unprotected basket would not let me get any sleep. This farmer needs massive help, i doubt he can overcome this on his own. Or with his insurance.
Sad story.  I hope you will be going to buy some new battery  post clamps very soon now and taking off your vice grips !!  On all the batteries you have on the pivots.
Call the millennial farmer. Farm rescue!
I'd be looking into a fire sprinkler system.......
Mi spiace molto...ci sono momenti che ti crolla il mondo addosso 😢😢😢😢
Thank you so much for posting this video.  I am a 4th generation farm owner from Arkansas.  I'm retired, but still own my land and rent it and I definitely know the cost of farm equipment.  I just made a donation to the gofundme site.  And I don't ever miss one of your videos.
Prayers to Mike and his Family - and recovery to the family and his Farm..
Grew up on a farm and have seen this before. Everyone on Laura's Youtube should give a few bucks. Farmers help America, give back now!
Laura and Grant, thanks for bringing the need to our attention.
That is awful what has happened,my prayers 🙏 go out to him and his family..
Im sorry so❤
Kevin from the Bronx here…I’m sorry for your friend’s loss.  I work on large property insurance claims and I see this a lot.  I know usually in Agribusiness claims (farming property) the policy does not cover 20% or higher of the equipment and property value.  And the claim adjustment takes a long time.  I hope he has a decent adjuster that will attend to his biggest need right now, which is equipment for the harvest.  He may have coverage for extra expenses that he can tap into.  I hope his agent is well versed in these claims.  You need as much expertise in your corner as possible.  If all else fails file a complaint with the state insurance department.  His business and livelihood should not go under because of incompetence from the insurance company.
Laura is a fantastic person in so many levels.
Yes, it's very bad for the whole farming family and agriculture in general((((  I wish them to rebuild their farm and start harvesting soon )
Sad, but I would not keep all my valuables in one place,  play safe.
God bless you and your family, for bringing it to our attention.
THAT IS SO SAD AND DEPRESSING!!!!
Was this an insurance job? LOL!
I don't think for one moment anybody who subscribes to your channel would accuse you of bragging. What you show us all from inside the farm buildings as you say is five lifetimes of investment and if you didn't have all that equipment by now then your farming techniques sucks. Right down to some advice and right now I think you deserve all the help you can get given that tone of your voice which was close to breaking point at times. You illustrate eloquently that wake up call for farming, so let me just part with some information. I spent the best part of 45 years working in the public and private industry I have lost count the number of safety courses I have been on in that time However none of it is lost on me even now retired 10year. I look around you brilliant stock of farming equipment and the risk of fire can be overwhelming so this is it in a nutshell. For fire to break out you need three things so consider it a triangle, you need oxygen you need a source of heat and you need fuel. Break that triangle take away anyone of those three and you are safe. So oxygen, its impossible to remove in that shed so you are left with the other two,  a source of heat or fuel. Don't store any fuel inside farm building that can vaporize, just remember petrol vapours can travel many yards along the ground and then find an exposed flame and ignite. fuel can also be anything, your grain, straw anything combustible like that gives you two out of the three components in that fire triangle I mentioned. A hot exhaust on your tractors after a day out working could potentially be that third ingredient needed to start a fire so leave said vehicles outside in the open air until the are fully cooled before putting them to bed at night.  You might want to consider contacting your local fire department and ask them for advice give them the guided tour of your business and I'm sure they will be there to lend a hand. I have known many firemen in my lifetime many have been instructors and every last one of them could talk a glass eye to sleep filling you with examples and advice.  I love your videos Grant and yourself help industry far and wide so keep it up and don't despair with plenty of care attention and that good old knowledge and hindsight things will continue to be okay for you. Just one other point I forgot, batteries and chargers are a massive hot spot to watch out for in your sheds and that is to include all those portable tools charging stations you have consider some enclosed area well away from  the half million dollar combined harvester. Sorry for going on a bit but I tend to be a bit like those "firemen" i just mentioned even though my background is electrical engineering. Look forward to your next video Laura.
My art goes out to him, but it's farming .should have had higher insurance.
So sorry for his lost sending prayers from Tennessee that he gets the help he needs to recover I know you and grant will do what you can I saw how you guys help the farmer that lost his equipment in the field combine fire your channel and your voice dose so much good for people look at the turn out you had to help him it was amazing thank you and grant for being the great people you are I have no dought with you making this video he will get the needed help thank you again for all you do love from your friend in Tennessee 😊
Incredible loss.  Thanks for sharing and caring! 🙏
Get in touch with Heavy D Sparks
Hi LAura, that is so upsetting. Thank you and thank Mike for sharing . I dont know if you hav this in your area, but Ive seen Zac Johnson aka Millenial Farmer involved woth an organosation near him called Farm Rescue I think. THis is a group of farmers who assembe to help eg Mike in these situarions or where a storm ha s wrecked shed and equoipment. All the best
Threw em a couple bucks, thanks for being a farmer
My Uncle went through a similar situation. His barn burnt down in the 1970's. Since the units were old tractors, I was able to get 4 of them running and back to work. Now all units are run by computers. He had a 300 IH, a 400 IH, a Super M IH and a 1942 TD 12 IH that I got back running. Later I was able to fully restore his big diesel unit. That took me a full year of my spare time, but I can remember his face when the big truck rolled up with it on back. I am going to share this, and see what I can spare now that I am on my SSI. I can't think of a better use of any money.  Mike, you and your family are in my prayers.
That's so like you (and the farming community in general) to start with "how can I help them?" Its one of several reasons why I bristle whenever anyone makes fun of those "farm folk". They will never get it.  Similarly, when someone says "but that's what insurance is for", I want to pat them on the head and say "that's cute". Insurance never pays for everything, even if you don't have a deductible. Which nearly everyone does. Thanks for being you, Laura. And I hope that people reach out.
Definitely sorry to hear for glad he's all right hopefully nobody got hurt
Thank you for sharing Mike and Amy’s story, Laura!  God bless you and Grant.  The Schutte’s have a deep Christian faith and know God will use this tragedy for good.  They are so grateful for the help that has come their way and will pay it forward for sure!  We continue to hold them up in prayer.
Thank you Guys for all you do, This is a real come to Jesus awakening, for everyone!!! This why we all thank God each and every day and count our blessing. Hopefully people will open there hearts and give something. May God Bless our American Farmers!!!!!!!
What kind of insurance does he have
Think of your own fire sprinkler, fire break strategy as well
Heartbreaking 💔💔. Fire returns everything back to its basic elements. I worked the inner city of Detroit in a service industry and during the 1968 riots blocks of buildings were burned to the ground. The huge steel girders that spanned the entire width of buildings were twisted like pretzels or a corkscrew . It's totally devastating when your total investment that's your lively hood is taken away . ( that can be done in other ways like from the stroke of a politicians/ ordinance/ city council's, ink pen ) destructive weather etc, but the results are the same , and some will give up as they are without hope but with neighbors coming together ( Like you and Grant) and many others maybe with a tremendous amount of work your neighbor can get back into what he loves. I have mentioned to you in comments before that we Need our hard working farmers and appreciate all of them beyond words. I am retired and on a fixed income but I will give what I can to add to the kitty for rebuilding. Bless you and Grant for using your platform to help him out.. Michigan
Me and my family know how Mike feels in 2020 we lost a shed full of are equipment
Hi 👋
Made a donation to the GoFundMe. Thanks for sharing this story. You and Grant are doing a great thing.
Two most devastating things are fire and flood. In 2003 I had a house fire that caused $105,000 damage, and me being carried by Life Flight to West Penn in Pittsburgh. To bad being under insured though. I always go over my policy once a year. At least nobody got hurt so be thankful for that. Good luck.
Does Laura farms have pictures of receipts, serial numbers , actual cash vaule on your insurance
I pray bless over you guys for helping Mike and his family out with this video. Been watching your video for the last two years.
Every farmers worst nightmare. Some equipment especially tractors are almost irreplaceable, they can be in the family for generations. Many have been used in weddings, funerals, tractor drives, 4H events, besides the thousands of hours some of us have put on them in the field. Thanks for sharing the values even though you were very conservative the average non farm public has no clue what kind of money we have tied up in equipment.
Think I would be installing some type of fire suppression in those workshops.
Just a thought here-----most heavy equipment has battery disconnect switches, but pickups and smaller stuff don't. It would be well worth the money and time to install one on EVERY vehicle if you're gonna be parking them all together like this, and shut the switch off EVERY TIME YOU'RE DONE USING IT !! Yeah it's a pain in the ass sometimes, depending on the switch location, but that little inconvenience could save you from a situation like Mike's.
So sorry for that farmers losses, God Bless him and his family!
So do yiu have a inventory of all your stuff in Laura farms barns
I am not a farmer, so even though I understand the cost of some of the equipment, I can only imagine the total cost of a building plus all the tools etc. in it.  This video hit me in the gut, and I wish I was able to help.  Even though I am on SS and retired I will still see what I can do.
Laura, can you do some follow up videos so we can understand what happens to this farmer.
Thanks for sharing this and the go fund me link.
This is freaking sad!
Why did he not have enough insurance to cover the property, vehicles, equipment, and tools lost in the fire.  Is that normal for a farmer not to be mostly or fully insured?
Prayers headed your way Mike.  Thanks to Laura (and Grant) for sharing and using her platform to help.  Already sent $$$ to the GoFundMe page.
Check with Akers to see if they can help with equipment.  If they have something they could loan to him through  harvest at least.
That was real eye opening on the cost of farming and the equipment involved.  I will make a donation to Mike's Go Fund Me account.  Good Job!
Need to call Farm Rescue
Part of the loss is the "muscle memory" of where tools and parts are and what is stored in what place and the loss of efficiency that is incurred even after things are replaced.
1966, March, MidMichigan, winter still had a grip on us.  A few minutes pass noon, our barn caught fire.  It was the old style beam two story barn.  We got our milk cows out, thank God.  But, being March, we had no fences up.  Our tractor was at the dealership getting all tuned up.  We lost hay, straw, corn planter, grain drill, cultivater, mowing machine and wagon.  Our neighbors stepped up.  Neighbor let us use his barn across  the road for our cows.  That was fun trying to milk all of them by hand with no stantions.  My cousin showed up with hay and straw.  We finally did get rid of the cows after couple weeks.  Our tractor was a B.  When they brought it back, we had no place to park it out of the weather.  Again, a neighbor come through.  It will take a while, but with farmers for neighbors it will work.   Been there.
Amazing power of fire.  Happy to hear he and the family are ok.  Only thing I can do is sit with the children tonight and pray for the family to be strong and hand in hand during and after this.
That's the most devastating thing about a fire like this. It's not just about the _big_ stuff - the high ticket items like combines and tractors. It's all the _little_ tools you've collected and purchased over your entire working life. And maybe entire working life of your father and even your grandfather too. Especially the ones that are older, aren't made any more or even ones you've altered or custom made yourself to solve problems or requirements you've had over time. Those quickly add up in value and extra loss, not to mention the fact you can't even pull yourself out of the hole using those smaller tools to do smaller jobs to work yourself back up to being able to afford the big ticket items. It's the loss of the building itself, which is _no_ cheap thing to easily replace. It's all those memories and human interactions associated with every single on of the items no matter how big or small they may be, that all went into moulding the very person you are today that have now been lost or tainted by the fire.  And yeah, insurance helps take some of the sting away, but it usually barely scratches the surface of repurchase costs let alone does absolutely nothing to help the emotional damage suffered thanks to the fire. My thoughts and prayers go out to that poor farmer, I'm just glad he has good people like yourselves on his side, who have his back and can help start building the ladder needed for him to climb out of this particularly painful hole. Farming is a tough enough life and career choice without adding a total-loss fire to the equation.
That is a tragedy of immense proportions. You are correct insurance will not cover the cost of replacement and by the time Fire finishes the investigation and the insurance decides to payout it will be a while. Donation made Laura and my best wishes for him and his family. It would be nice if AKRS would denote or offer at a cost discount on some equipment. A terrible event. Take care and thanks for bringing this event to our attention.
Prayers to Mike for a speedy recovery.  I gave a few dollars.  We are 456K strong on this channel a little from a lot could accumulate to his out of pocket need quickly.
We need to have him give a call to farm rescue
I know looking back is always 20/20 vision and I do feel for your friend ( my grandfather's livestock barn hit by a tornado). These days a fire suppression system in any/all barns are a must. Unfortunately there are people out there who like to 'have fun' at others expense, not saying this is what happened, but I do hear this more and more.  My prayers go out to this family, remember God has a plan even if we can't see it. YOU are an amazing friend to have , as are ALL FARMERS and their right knit communities.
Coming from someone that lost a home completely to a wild fire about 1.5 years ago. Insurance can never and will never cover what it cost to rebuild. We have lost track of what we have spent out of pocket. things that the insurance doesn't cover like completely destroying the yard and driveway during the new build, the 100's of hours out your days to talk to people, arrange things, plan things, look at things and many other tasks. The insurance company de-valuing everything that you own. We had over $50,000 worth of interior and personal items that where documented on the inside and insurance cover about $10,000. The hours to list out and document what was inside, supply pictures and other things. Its very sad to see someone loss their life's work
This is so heartbreaking. Laura I have been watching your videos for years and I feel that I am your biggest fan. I donated and I shared it on Facebook and I stated that you are my friend and that you brought this to my attention. I asked my friends to donate any amount that they can afford. Laura you and Grant are a fantastic couple and seem to be spiritually grounded and are hard workers. God bless you both and the whole family that experienced this great loss.
My landscaping company just had an 8 1/2' ×16' enclosed trailer burn to the ground...4 commercial mowers, blowers  trimmers, tools.... 50 GRAND ......we are getting 30 cents on the dollar.....so.....I cannot imagine.   God bless
Noob talking here - Does a fire alarm system with water sprinklers and or CO2/foam system not a good investment long-term for workshop/tool sheds. An more automatic system, that can extinguish starting fires. I would be a big investment + annually test the system.  I must be a nightmare for every farmer, loosing materials due fires or weather
Best wishes from Bavaria!
😂😂😂😂aoho no it's big lost 😂😂😂😂😂Allah gave you insha Allah again. Please don't mind me. I'm praying for you 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤Allah bless you ❤❤❤❤
This video made me wish I was a multi millionare like never before.
Ms Laura my father in law farmed and we never parked equipment in a shed or even in a row close together for this very reason we only left something in the shop if it would not move for fear of something like this happening
Prayers from Ohio
I would say the best investment you could make even though its not cheap would be to have a fire suppression system installed.
😢😢😢😢
Hallo das sieht nicht schön aus ich hoffe ihr könnt das wieder auf bauen last nicht den kopf hängen 😢😢 wünsche euch viel glück beim aufbauen  ich bin in gedanken bei euch hier aus Deutschlands Norden viele grüße von Marco
I'm sorry for their loss but couldn't they have fire suppression like sprinklers and alarm systems that would notify them at their living quarters that a fire had started? Otherwise maybe not storing all their equipment in one place.
I pray that they can get back on their feet.  Glad to hear that no one was hurt.  Thank you for being a good neighbor!
Underinsured? It is either irresponsible or he took the risk. I'm certain all the neighborhood will help to harvest the crops and get them to market. New building with insurance money, used machines and cornhead/beanhead, etc. Start over or sell it all. Get going.
We always have to go through approvals, God bless you!
Oh dear! Why won't the insurance cover it? Was there an EV parked in the shed?
How r u lovely❤
Makes ya want to buy an alarm system.
Equipment loss’s are the worst  and they never get easier 😭hopefully Mike can get back on his feet soon :(
Heart felt sorrow for this man, his family, and his farm. So sad
I can smell insurance scam thousands of miles away.
Flip your battery disconnect every night and put fire suppression in your equipment barns hindsight is 20/20 but it’s a good idea
Diesel Brothers have fire suppressors for sell for hangers they'll work in big sheds too
Laura, can you put a mailing address for the farmer so I can send a check I don’t do the go fund me thing
what the he**
Terrible loss for this man and his family. Thank God there was no loss of life.
I have an old 1969 5000 Ford tractor with loader. Some three point equipment. I believe that to replace it all in a new product of any brand! I'd be looking in access cost of over 40 grand! Equipment is expensive!
Prayers for Mike and his family from Butler,  PA
It costs a ton of money very quickly.  Remember the new John Deere tractor and planter package. One million dollars. It requires that much money investment to farm. Also every hour you put on a piece of equipment depreciates the value of that piece, when you replace it the new replacement isn't the same cost as what you paid for the old piece, no. Inflation and manufacturing costs increase the end cost.
Such sad and tragic news. I’ll be sure to stop by his go fund me page. I’ve got a question though. Y’all pump hundreds of thousands of gallon of water on your field, which I understand why, but you have hundred of thousands if not millions of dollars in your equipment, tools,vehicles and tools, why not install a sprinkler system of some sort in your building? Think of the difference it would have made there.
Do you know what caused the fire?
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Where and how do I send money. Not very savvy with the phone would like to help. Rick Dean. Our prayers are with you.
About 60 years ago I lived through a barn fire. My uncle had just filled the hayloft with fresh hay.  Lightning started a fire that burned the barn, milking stalls,and shop. I was able to save the tractor by backing it right out through the door. My uncle’s Cadillac burned to the ground. He never let me forget I saved a 20 yr old tractor and his new car burned!   It truly is sickening though to see the aftermath of a fire like that.
So sorry
Would love to help but financially speaking it would literally be a drop in the ocean.. but this is a strong case for installing fire suppression equipment in buildings that house your entire livelihood. I would a lot rather be cleaning up foam residue than looking at potentially the end of a family legacy..
half a million dollars is the equivalent of about 1 tractor.  For us city folks, it's all about seeds, but after seeing this video, farming is all about capital and capital improvements.
You might want to consider installing fire extinguishing balls in your shop. Dirt cheap compared to the value of everything inside it.
Bon courage Force à tout sa famille
Get in touch with farm rescue! Sure they’ll be able to do something to support. A few English ££s also on their way over
I hope that Mike gonna be ok as soon as possible 🥺 Sending greetings from czech republic ❤❤🥹🥹
This is very sad, do you not have equipment insurance?
When I was a kid our barn burned down one night. The sound of the cattle being burned is something I will never forget. I hope that things turn out as good as they can for your neighbor.
Wow, that's awful. I can't help wondering what exactly was burning in a steel building with a concrete floor? Obviously it must have been the machinery itself, but even that seems hard to understand.  If I was someone in that business, I would be looking at that and thinking about how I could make sure it could not possibly happen to me and my stuff. Right away I am thinking about the huge pumps and pipes and irrigation equipment, and thinking, sprinklers. Maybe hang some of those unused irrigation heads from the ceiling. Also smoke detectors that are connected to a very loud alarm. Lots of big fire extinguishers, and a standpipe. I would tack it into the cost of insurance.  Speaking of which, I sure hope your neighbor was well insured. Usually this is required for leased equipment or anything that is expensive and money is owed on it.  Always think about safety, and about things that can go wrong, including "what is the worst thing that can happen?", and proceed to live accordingly.  It seems hard to believe that a metal building full that sort of stuff could be completely consumed by a fire, and I sure hope Mike did not think that and he had insurance.   Millions of dollars worth of stuff is well worth spending a bunch to make sure things like this cannot happen. Fires usually start small, and take a while to get out of hand, so alarms and detectors are must have's. Sprinkler system would seem warranted, even if it was kind of expensive. But thousands, not millions. But having one, besides for providing peace of mind, will lower insurance premiums.
this sucks and heartbreaking.   I cant imagine    Hopefully we dont personly ever go thru this.   all of our equipment is separatly insured and the shop and contents are also all insured my insurance comes in every 90 days and reasses everything to make sure we are covered for replacemnt cost   its expensive but I hope to hell if it ever happens to us we have covered our bases.  We also run kill switches on everything at the batteries that automatically cutoff the batteries when the key is sut off   First time I saw one of these cutoffs was on a excavator   used them ever since.  this is damn sad
With so much money invested into all the Equipment stored in the buildings, it would be prudent to install a fire suppression system to help give some protection.
Please everyone give a few bucks. If your a YouTuber please share this video on your platform. Laura and Grant please share plenty of updates on progress as this young farmer gets back on his feet.
Even if insurance covered 100% of the losses it will take years to find and replace everything lost.
Thanks!
My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family. Thank you grant and Laura for sharing this and helping this guy out you guys are amazing!
Laura you and Grant are a blessing to your trade and Neighborhood !
Oh my God.  Very  tragic very  sorry
I really Feel for this Farmer. If I were Financially Able, I would Restore everything Lost, I know that there are people out there who could do this easily without even missing the Money--God Please Bless this farmer...
I’m just curious as to wether buildings that house equipment can be equipped with fire suppression equipment at a reasonable cost.
So very sorry for his lost but at the same time you as a farmer you can learn by his mistake by not packing all the equipment in one place.
I saw a video recently by Zak Johnson (Millennial Farmer) about an organisation called 'Farm Rescue' or something like that. I don't think they provide funding, but they offer practical help to keep the farm business alive. From the videos you have put up on YouTube, that I watch  from the UK, I can appreciate the pain of the loss.
Living in Germany, coming from a farm and seeing your equipment, I suppose you must have 600-1500 acres (similar to the German measurement morgen which is 1/3rd of a ha). Seeing your investment and also what you produce, it could be a multiple. Johne Deere bought Lanz in Mannheim around 1955.
I'm so sorry because i don't understand english well,   but what happened there. .? ?
That's why you purchase insurance to the hilt....... Can't say it enough when you own your buissness........
A sober reminder to FILL your outbuildings, barns and sheds with ALL sorts of monitoring, sensors, detectors, cameras, etc. With so much off the shelf technology available to all of us these days, Full Loss tragedies like this can be prevented. Additionally, smart sprinkler systems, Thermal cams, etc. could have caught this as a small 'hot-spot' before any fire became established and beyond control.    Also, don't forget that a lot of the personal electronics we all use every day contain Lithium Polymer or Lithium-Ion batteries. These are often of dubious quality and certification.  Leaving one of these charging unattended on a workbench could have EASILY been the cause. Portable Jump-Start battery packs, the same. Loaded with Lithium cells, which can flash into fireballs during charging.   My point is this... look around your homes and shops for these small consumer devices as well... ask any fire department... these types of devices are causing many hundreds of fires across the US every single day.  Sorry for the loss and tragedy here. I hope my comments are an inspiration that can prevent someone reading them to discover their own unsafe device or situation, and prevent it through knowledge and awareness.   All accidents are preventable. Make this your code.
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 for them to recover.
Where's your fire suppression system for the barns to protect your investments? If it were me I would have water and dry chemical. Dry chemical for the winter and water for the warmer weather.
What a terrible tragedy. God help this people.
Insurance? Thank God no lives, people or animals were lost, those cant be replaced.  Like in texas when that dairy farm caught fire and thousands of cattle burned up.
I see similar discussions over here in the Netherlands about how supposedly rich farmers are. Completely ignoring that most of them are up to the eyeballs in debt and all that wealth is in fast depreciating capital equipment. Losing that equipment and the blood sweat and tears that went into acquiring it must be absolutely devastating. I wish the family all the best in rebuilding the pieces and much strength in what will undoubtedly be a trying couple of years.
My Uncle's Dairy barn burned down years ago, it was devastating.  He rebuilt and recovered but it took years.  This is a tragedy, but the farming community is strong and Laura and Grant have a big heart for putting out the word for help.
Should reach out to Flair (huge youtuber in Nebraska) and see if he could help out a fellow cornhusker???
So sorry for the loss.   Hope insurance pays "replacement cost" instead of depreciated equipment value.   With this market...going to be impossible replace at past prices, and past tool quality.   Note To All:   All that farm irrigation capacity, and no sprinkler system in outbuildings?    All it takes is some pack rat building a nest in your equipment chewing on some wires to burn down everything.
How sad...
@Laura Farms I would definitely think about putting a fire suppression system in my equipment buildings.
Just a thought, all that irrigation but no sprinkler system for the shop.
Prayers for the family  , it's so  wonderful of you to use your platform to help others, God bless you  🙏❤🙏
So sad 😢😢😢
Heartbreaking
Why don’t you have a sprinkler system?
I would now work on getting a fire system in the shed to protect the equipment it would be work it you have great equipment you have to protect it  and now how crazy the weather is  it will be worth it
So sad my prayers are with him
😯
Devastating loss.  I lived for a while in Kearney NE (1982-86 and recently visited there again this past month. The people in these communities are by and large honest, hard working, and faith based.  Don't know Mike but gave a small $ to his go fund me.
i hate to ask but can he get money for the metal scrap at the scrap yard for all of it thats left? just curious.
Contact Farmer Relief (Millenial Farmer) They might be able to help.
Very sad  video Laura 😢 I wish I could help but I'm  on such a low income from SS.
Shared on my Facebook page hope you can raise enough money to help this family out I wish Insurance would pay for everything I mean that's why we pay for insurance for isn't it
Nobody lost there lives thats the main thing.  everything can be replaced,wish you all the best....i hope laura & grant has a fire system although the heat involved probable would not make a real difference.
Being a ex dairy farmer I completely understand.
I mean the world will be nothing with out farmers families will starve to death if it was not for the farmers all over the world so thank you to all the farmers
It doesn't matter how many generations you have been in business, you cannot let yourself be under insured.
Donated 😢
I think it is so great that you get it. What I mean is your young and you understand what is has taken to get to where you are and then to have the compassion to go through another person tragedy. Show the man's loss and you explain it so well from what he had how much it cost compared to what the insurance will pay. You and your husband have earned where you are at I pray that you and Grant have safety and good crops this harvest season.
You will find out how good your insurance is when something like that happens!
Why don’t you call Zack Johnston he knows all about the farm rescue pets. Those guys will help out
the word will be nothing with out farmers the the American family in the world that we live in Whitby starving to death if it was not for Farmers a big thank you to all the pharmacy
Insurance will cover 90% of his losses
Thanks!
Donation sent.
If I win mega million I will take care of Mike
I share your loss, we lost our home last Halloween and the rebuild is supposed to be done  mid August. Best advice, if you can step away from all of it for just a day to organize your path, it will make things a lot more manageable. Our prayers are with you.
God bless him and you guys for doing this Laura I could tell how emotional you were walking around looking at everything
it is so sad
Prayers to the farmer for losing his equipment it sucks to lose your farm from one tragic fire
MUITO TRISTE
Very sad. Gives me flashbacks to the fire we had on our farm in 1969. Our losses were big but nothing like this. Lost all of our tools and workshop. My Dad never really recovered from it. Hope he can get back on his feet. 🙏🙏🙏
Fertilizer or anything like it burns like the sun and toxic fumes billow out. Be very careful,  Oklahoma bombing was Fertilizer.  Prayers for the family
Equipment suppliers can donate and right it off I believe if they can.
Contac farm rescue they help farmers in situation like that
Thank You laura for sharing this tragic  event , I will pass on the GFM link as well as send what I can.. Farmers feed the world,, big small we need them all ! Prayers for the family..😢😢
Praying for all involved.  When I was 8 my neighbors kids caught their barn on fire one Sunday afternoon from sneakingly smoking cigarettes.  The wind was bad and it destroyed their equipment and burnt up the cornfield across the street in front of us.  It looked like hell was coming and the end of the world.
Welcome to india 🇮🇳
Very sad prayers
O my God 😢😢all the way from Ireland 🇮🇪
Hi,! Laura God Bless you for the concern and Heart n LOVE for your naburs.! I grew up on a farm U r such an Insperration !  Prayers for all there , thanks to you.
Thanks for the reach out.  Step Fam in Oregon has century farm and the costs are insane.
Neighbor helping neighbors, friends helping friends.  We need more Laura's in the world. Hopefully with the YouTube following you have this message will reach lots of people around the world.
prayers for a solution for them thats is in their favor
Prayers to all affected
the fire must have been intense and hot enough to destroy vehicles beyond recognition hope the poor farmer  gets everything sorted
God Bless you and Grant for caring and spreading the word of this disaster and using your channel for spreading your sincere and caring grief for this fellow farmer. Thank you for the GoFund me page too.
Where is the GoFundMe page?
It's Zach Johnson,  millenium farmer FBN
Great job to all. So sorry Mike. Dammit
God bless your family
Laura, this could be a reminder to take all the batteries out of the tractors every night. Or to make sure all the cables are tight and not loose.  As for his loss, its 😢 to see and hear. Hopefully the farming community will bless him on helping to replace all the equipment that was lost in this fire.
Ten years ago I had that happen. I've only got half of what I had back. Two barns my shop.ect
Get with Millenium Farmer they just went a month ago to help out on one. He knows the Farm Help Group that did all the help.
Let's chip in and help this family.
I wonder what will be done to harvest Mike's crops when the time comes?  Harvest seems to be so hectic anyway that I can not imagine enough equipment, not already in use,  to get the job done.  My guess is there will be some tractors going twenty four seven for a couple of weeks. While the staffing has not changed, the tractor drivers will need a tractor.
Sprinkler systems really work well. Yes there is an expense to it, but it's worth it for piece of mind that you hope you never have to use. It's like life insurance. You hope to never use it.
I would love to donate but money is tight for us as well I really hope you guys collect enough money to at least get him up and running again,   I really respect you sharing this to your followers to help him  I also really hope he’ll find a way to get his crop of his fields otherwise that’s even more lost money
🙏Dear Lord please bring healing to this terrible event, in Jesus Name Amen🙏❤
That was a catastrophe. I hope he can recover from this. The question we must ask now is, what can we learn from this accident? How can we minimize the risk of this happening again? Maybe not put all the equipments in one building? create "fire compartments"? Disconnect the batteries in vehicles? Put a fire extinguishing detection system in the building? Accidents can happen, that's why they are "accidents". But if millions of dollars and the continuity of our farm are at risk, safety must be the first priority.
This is one reason farmers should stay with older equipment to farm with and alot less money lost
Farm fires are all too common.  It's been two generations since my family has farmed.  But my dad's dad experienced two devastating fires, one in 1939 and another in 1942.  My wife's grandparents also experienced a total loss fire in 1942.  Part of the loss comes from the way insurance typically works.  They don't pay for replacement equipment; they pay the _depreciated value_ of the lost equipment, often on their timescale.  So if you have a piece of gear that they decide has a lifespan of 20 years, and it's 10 years old when you lose it, you may only get 33% or even 25% of what it originally cost - even though you were expecting to use it for another 20 years, they figure it's way more then 50% used up.
How sad to see a video like this, that must be so devastating for Mike and his family, to lose so much in such a short time must be heartbreaking. The only thing to be thankful for that it didn't spread to anywhere else, his house or fields. After seeing that, I would consider installing a sprinkler system. Love from Mike. ❤❤
What a loss
What a somber and sad time this is for Mike, his family, neighbors and loving and supporting people like you and Grant.  I can't even imagine what they are going through but have faith that they will somehow get through this trial.  Thank you Laura for focusing your effort on using your platform to play a part in helping Mike and his family; I know it will help a lot.  Thank you for all you do.
This is from  a person that lived through 2 fires do not put all your equipment in one building sorry for the loss
Great job guys.
Dontated! All the best to your friends!
Prayers for Mike and his family. So glad everyone is okay.  An example of loss, our equipment barn was destroyed in a wind event, total loss (thank God my equipment was mostly spared). Insurance only covered about 1/2 the expense to rebuild. We’re a small operation, it really hit us hard, still recovering 4 years later.
At the farm I worked at ,we installed sprinkler systems. Saved a good bit on insurance.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍🏿🤷
Fantastic explanation of this fire disaster. Please reach out to ALL the farming channels ie. Larson Farms and others asking them to help Mike out. You and Grant are such nice people and i hope other channels can do the same. Can you tell us non farmers about Farm Rescue. Sent a donation.
I pray now in the mighty name of JESUS CHRIST for a complete replacement of all fire damaged items,for replacement with new products to properly run this Family's farm and JESUS please help this farmer; Mr.Mike Schutte to find peace that surpasses all understanding . Thanks to Laura Farms for bringing to light the devistation of this great loss so we all can pull together and offer prayers and financial support. In JESUS' name I pray.Amen✝❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 I pray from TAMPA BAY FLORIDA ,USA 🇺🇸
Absolutely devastation .Really feel for Mike I wish  I could afford to help him out  .Please can I pray for him and his family though that Laura and Grant getting this sad news out there will have a huge impact on how much funding comes flooding in .Laura and Grant thank you for sharing this. Please tell Mike there are a lot of people praying for him in the background .
Done. Best wishes for recovery.
🥺
So devastating. Thanks for letting us know. I contributed $50.
FarmRescue Farm Rescue’s mission is to help farmers and ranchers who have experienced a major illness, injury or natural disaster by providing the necessary equipment and manpower to plant, hay or harvest their crop. Livestock feeding assistance is also available to ranchers. Farm Rescue helps farm and ranch families in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas.
So sad.
Maybe build another smaller shop to split your storage. Only items being worked on stored in the work shop were the increase risk of fire.
It's not like farmers are making bank. Not unless you're one of the big commercial farms that manipulate, scam, cheat, steal, price hike/gouge and spend millions or billions to put others out of business, sell dangerous zero nutrition crops and/or are like Monsanto forcing people to use specific seeds for your own profit.  These people are in serious debt and the government totally fucks them over at every turn. It's amazing they can even feed themselves at all.   You lose your equipment like this... hell you lose ONE machine and you're probably looking for a job at McDonalds after that. They can't afford to replace this stuff.  Common sense to those of us with brains.
i feel so sorry for Mike wish him well . lesson to be learned dont put all  your equipment in one building spread it out if you can do so in case of fire you wont loose it all good luck to Mike and thank you Laura and Grant
So sad 😢
I am retired enlisted Army so my disposable income is limited but I’ll do what I can and send a prayer.
Laura & Grant - Thank you for sharing this story.  I grew up enjoying visiting and helping with my grandfather's farm.  In the mid 60s there was a fire that took all the buildings and scalded a good portion of the field nearby.  Even with insurance there was not enough to replace and recover.  As you said it takes generations to build the infrastructure to have a successful farming operation.
I agree especially with one of the comments that this is probably the most sad video you have done.   Thank you for sharing.   I hope and pray that this family will survive this tragedy.   I also encourage each of us to contribute what we can to help this family.   A dollar will go a long way when everyone pitches in.  My prayers will go out to the family
Are there fire sprinklers inside your shops/barns? Would it work to plumb a system to one of the pivot wells for water supply?
Farming is hard enough as it is. Things like this makes it even harder on people who are trying to make a living.
I just went to go fund me  wish I could do more.
I would tell him to get some older equipment and an deutz air cooled tractor
GoFund - done.   Thanks for the share of a fellow farmer.
Will you do the same for a guy who's 4th generation machine shop burns down?  I hate to tell you, but the same thing happens when ANY business burns down. Everything needs replacing.   If you want money from me, just ask from the heart. Like...Please help this family they could sure use some good fortune.
당신들은 젊어요 굴하지 말고 다시 일어서면 됍니다 힘내시구요💪💪🦵🦵You're young. Don't give in. You can stand up again Cheer up🦵🦵💪💪
Is there any way to start a different funding source beside GoFundMe because they sometime take the funds if they don't like your politics.  Would you consider starting a GiveSendGo account?
A total fire loss, its probably worse than death. Everything tool you have is gone. Support this man, this is tragic.
Maybe Michael Bloomberg can educate all of all of us on farming and how easy it is.  Just putting some seeds in the ground, how hard is that?  And he was running for President.
Once steel gets over 1000*F it practically has no strength.  When steel starts glowing  at 1200*F it starts to become plastic, ie turns soft like play-dough.  Aluminum melts at  1200*F, starts go soft/plastic around 1000*F.  If you think about it, it is not that much heat...a camp fire will get a rod of steel glowing bright orange which is about 1800*F.
I am so sorry for his loss.... but for you and Grant, maybe consider a sprinkler system.
Waooo Laura i feel sory for your neighbor i really do i hope you guys can help the farmer 🙏
Farm Rescue is amazing organization in times like this.  Could you possibly do a video on how to make sure the insurance covers losses like this?  Did he.just not have enough insurance thinking he did?
Its time for a fire system to douse the fires that destroy farm buildings. Would that work or not? I keep fire extinguishers around my house and think I may be able to save my house if needed.
🤧🤌💪💪🦵🦵❤💛💚💜Laura Farms
Talking about the heat there’s probably a lot of diesel fuel in there
Regardless of the kind of insurance this farmer has, actual value or replacement value, the loss of the familiarity of those pieces of your world is devastating. It's kind of like how you felt inside your home before it was burglarized and how you would feel inside your home after it was burglarized.    Believe it or not, just the habit of opening the door of your barn everyday and seeing all of the equipment inside the building, sitting where it usually sits, day after day; knowing how to jump in the cab of any tractor you have operated and starting the engine like you have a million times, again and again; the pen on your desk, the place the button to close the door has been since you were 5 years old, knowing how to operate the family lawn mower you have used since you learned to mow grass;   where the pencil sharper for the shop is mounted at the end of that one bench near your fathers old tool chest.   Literally millions of things you were so familiar with for decades are now all gone.    Then there is the task of learning how to use all of the new to you, stuff, organizing all of the new to you stuff, remembering all of the stuff you lost.  Man, I just can't imagine how difficult it will be and I hope, and pray, I never will have to.         🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So sad!  :(   Do you guys have any sort of fire suppresion system? Or is that not a thing?
what about the farm program to help farmers like Cole Zack Johnson and Chet from Larson farms get ahold of them to get the info
Have you checked if you have the insurance you need?  Maybe a time to have a conversation with your insurance agent.
as someone who has done some black smithing i can tell you steel like that don't melt easy. your looking at 2500F just to forge it at a minimal and that fire would have reach more like 3000F.  i hope that best for him and his loved one
Great reminder to sharpen up fire protection and battery switches
that why we buy insurance
We have a fall back plan here. Same thing happened to a farm near us. We basically have 2 of everything, needed to farm around 2,500 acres. We have 2 buildings for tractors and a third for implements. We store everything in a 50/50 split. If something was to happen, no matter what, we would have at least 1 complete team for planting, harvesting, and misc uses. No 2 tractors for the same use, will ever be under the same roof, it causes headaches at times but there is no bigger headache than losing everything at the same time. Our main office/maintenance/fabrication tool building, is out fitted with a commercial fire sprinkler system. A disaster close to home, will always make you rethink how you do things. Hope he gets it ironed out fast. Headed to go donate now  Side note, screw insurance companies, we pay high premiums for this exact reason, when we need it, we should have it. They act like it's a crime when we call and want to do a claim, when in retrospect, that's the only reason they exist in the first place
People helping people; that's what it's all about. Prayers and good wishes going out.
Totally devastating! I hope the community comes together once more to help the guy! We can learn some lessons from every tragedy. In this case - if you have a barn full of very expensive equipment, price of which comes to millions, you should invest at least 10-20k into automated fire suppression system.
What’s the link to the Go Fund Me account?
I personally know Mike and his family from church and the community.  There is no family more deserving of everyone's help.  He has always been there when others needed help.
Good example of why you should "never put all your eggs in one basket"! Good luck on recovering!!  May God Bless you.
Lost for words!
You should connect him with Farm Rescue and Farm Aid. Farm rescue can do all of the harvest.
1800 Degrees to melt Aluminum I believe?
😢
We need to take care of our farmers...they feed us...
Reassure your fire protection and insurance policy.  Something for you to look at closely Grant and Laura. Sprinkers in your warehouse.
If all of Laura's subscribers could donate $10 or $20 it would help tremendously.
Have you or do other farmers consider fire suppression systems for their barns/sheds?
So sad😢
A tragedy can strike in many forms, install remote alarm systems and pay the extra money for replacement value insurance. My prayers go out to the family, hopefully this will be a distant memory very soon. I hope his crops will be harvested with the help of many family, friends and neighbors. God bless
I hope the cause can be determined.
did he have security cameras?
Laura - the loss of one piece of equipment is devastating, the loss of all your equipment and the impact on your livelihood is very hard to comprehend.  Thx for the video and bless both you and Grant for being so caring of your fellow farmers.
Thank God no one was hurt.   Farm Rescue may be able to help. They do aw some work.
Do events like this ever make you consider a fire extinguisher system?
😢 so sad
I hope this serves as a lesson for you and Grant to QUIT MESSING AROUND with vice grips as battery cable clamps.  Do things properly, please.
Laura so sorry hear this man what a loss man I wish I could help only thing I can for y'all is pray.
Get in touch with the zach Johnson cuz he will get everything done to help this farmer
I HOPE HIS RECOVE ASAP !!! MY PRAYERS TO HIM
Farm Rescue and @MillenialFarmer have always helped farmers in need
I don't think you need to excuse yourselves for the equipment you have and use! I wouldn't consider it "showing off"! Farming is a business, but also a lifestyle!   With that said, I hope everyone reading this starts to think about what they can and need to do to make their farms, and their equipment as safe as possible! Accidents happens easily enough as it is, but if you can mitigate some of those risks just by making sure you go over how you store certain chemicals, batteries and other potential hazards you are better off for it! Have a checklist you go over before you close the doors in the evening, it could very well save you from disasters like this!  My neighbor's autoshop burnt down a few years ago just because he didn't secure a can of gasoline correctly! It was a simple mistake that cost him his livelihood! I hired an expert to come take a look at my place (I have a detail shop), and she went through everything from how I stored my equipment, to how I secured old oils, fuels, cleaning chemicals and batteies for my cordless tools all the way up to going over the electrical system of my shop! It cost a bit, sure, but it would be NOTHING compared to losing my whole place!  One of the scary things she found was a mouse had built a nest in a breaker box and it had starting gnawing on the wires in it, that could have been a very easy way to start a fire!   Lastly I want to say that something that warms my heart is just how embracing most communities are when someone faces a crisis like this! ❤
Breaks my heart, Laura and Grant.  Praying for Mike.  We actually have our equipment storage broken up for this very reason.  We use separation as a means of diversifying and minimizing the risk.  Excavator is in one building, tractors in other buildings, tools in another.  Not as convenient but a good peace of mind.  Again, very sad to see this.  Yes… it could happen to any of us.  Interesting you post this video.  I just installed Automatic fire suppression tubes (Fireslayer) on our equipment.  It doesn’t cost much and uses DuPont FE36 agent to kill a fire instantly.  Have it in the RV also.  Worth looking into.  Installs under the hood of your equipment.
There is a genuine spirit of cooperation and shared goals all around helping the customer,Laura farms.
Dang it girl. Fires are so devastating 😢 our hearts and prayers go out to you. Keep your chin up, I know you have great  neighbors who will be there for you guys. At least everyone is ok. Equipment  can be replaced. Be safe and keep us up to date on your progress.
do you have the Possibility to have fire sprinklers in your farm sheds that could  reduce the risk of total destruktion of property?? or is it to expensive to install
Sprinkler system is cheap insurance.  Also keeping the amount of flammable junk from piling up goes a long way to preventing the fire from spreading.
oh no not good can understand you most emotional video you have done , stay safe and a good crop year
Yet another Blue DEF fluid fire.  Not for nothing, but you've 2 have that Black Chevy p/u maybe loan it to him? Or the Jeep? Think how much it would help? Every little thing helps, at a time like this.  Also is a sprinkler system, cheaper then insurance?
U awesome !
Farm Rescue they're a great organization and I guarantee they would help him out prayers go out to him and his family that is a devastating loss every farmer out there be safe because without us there would be a lot of hungry people out there God bless all you farmers
What a loss for a hard working  person. I'm not trying to be disingenuous and I know there would be a big cost up front but have you or any farmers you know run/ installed  sprinklers in thier shops? Again not trying  to make light or be rude about the situation.  I feel for him. I see your your shop as you were showing it along with people like MN Millenial or Larson. I know it would cost but seeing the devastation is heartbreaking.
I hope you have the main batt. disconnects on your stuff.  You can put them on your vehicles too.  It's a good preventative measure.
Melanie C - I Turn To You (Remix)
Our prayers go out to him and his family  We'll certainly pass this video around the country.
I will be donating to his go fund me can you please keep us viewers updated on his progress Thank You Laura and Grant
Did you reach out to Farm Rescue on his behalf? They could help him in the short term, like getting the harvest in!
It wasn't much but every penny helps. Good on you two for caring to help and share his dilemma.
Thank you for sharing this on your channel. I hope everyone donates at least a little bit to help this guy out. Farmers like you guys are the backbone of America.
That was a huge loss. The emotional recovery will be really tough. God bless you for trying to help them.   My brother in law lost his 11,000 square foot woody restoration shop that had 50 years accumulation of tools, part patterns, and several almost priceless cars in it. Investigation concluded the fire was started by a rechargeable Lithium tool battery that caught fire and burned in the night when they were out of town. He was way under insured.   Don't leave rechargeable batteries on chargers when you're not there. Reassess your insurance policy annually.
My prayers do not go out to a God that watched it all happen. A God who cares would have prevented it, not fictitiously be there through prayers after the fact. I care for this person and hope he can get it all figured out. People will help him out, not God.
🤩🤩Wow!!! You are more beautiful than the most lovely rose And more sweet than honey  and more precious than gold You are more precious than everything that exists in this world 😍😍😍 A beauty queen whom I never ever seen any one as beautiful as her before and may never ever in my whole entire life will see anyone as beautiful  as her-meaning you-at all..  😍😍 WoW!!! you are a lovely butterfly and a beautiful rose  you are the diamond and the pure gold you are the lovely moon in our nights you are the radiant sun shining soo bright loving you is sooo sweet its the most enjoyable thing  for you are the paradise for the heart and soul and mind Everything about you is sooo unique and attracts the eyes and captivates the mind God surely perfected you so glorified is he whom made you too beautiful and made you soo smart 🌷😘    There was a teacher whom didn't believe in the existence of God, one day he asked his students, do you see God? the students then replied no we don't see God, so the teacher said if you don't see God it means there is no God. then a smart student stood up and said to the other students hey guys can you see the teachers brain? then the students answered no we don't see the teachers brain, the student then said the teacher then is crazy, he has no brain :0) 😍😍  Wow!!,  you are too beautiful!!! whomever see you should believe that God is true & real.. and whenever I see you I feel like Iam in a dream, And when we wake up we will all realize that all this life was nothing but a dream and that only God is whats true and real.. The universe science says was not always there, it had a beginning point, the big bang, meaning it was begun/initiated in other words created, thus there should be a creator, there must be a God.  One God for all of us he created us all and can revive us again,   God initiated everything,  & he repeat/redo things too,  & thats clear, we see many cycles of different things in life, also in summer for example the desert land becomes like empty and is filled with only sand, and when rain falls in abundance in spring or winter, after that small flowers & wild plants grow again, also, we see how humans and animals grow and how their body is formed from the elements which were in the sand which plants feed on which they eat, and after they die they go to the sand and their atoms/elements are taken by plants which humans & animals eat and their bodies grow from those atoms & elements found in the sand which came from previous humans & animals which died before, so God can bring us again after we die even if our atoms became in the sand he can make us from the same atoms we were made of or from other atoms if he want or make us be in a spirit form or like ghosts, any ways, everything in this life is recycled, learn if you want about the different cycles in life in nature, the food cycle or food chain, the water cycle, even the gas cycle that makes the air the oxygen &carbon dioxide &nitrogen cycles, even the energy is like recycled but only changes from form to another form.   Anyways,, God created this life but it's only a temporary sample/an example of a coming everlasting one which could be either in heaven paradise or in hell.  If we try to be good humans in life, and try to obey God and his messengers-including the final messenger for all humanity the prophet Mohammed- and those whom rightly represent them, for example imam Ali & ahlulbayt the family/good descendants of the prophet mohammed, then we will all go to heaven/paradise, if not then we will go to hell fire and burn in it forever.  keep shining sunshine &spread the light
❤
Iam so sorry to se the farm just destroyed so sad. Hope he gets his equipment soon so he can farm again
The thumbs up is SO in appropriate for this tragic story. But Thank You for bringing this to the world's attention Laura.
Good morning laura,..but,actualy midnight in javaa☀️😁😁
It is an emotionally devastating situation, the only good thing is that it appears there were no fatalities. However, that is cold comfort when you see all the destruction that was caused to so many aspects of the owner's life. It almost automatically makes the case for fire suppression systems. Fires are never kind, they always destroy, property and grind down those who are affected. I hope Mike can charge back into his recovery of his business, but more importantly his life. Currently, theft is a huge issue about the area in which I live, it is no surprise that Mike's loss will be so huge, agriculture is not a low investment industry.
😢😢😢😢 triste nouvelle espérons que celas repartiras bon courage pour le propriétaire de cette fermes!!!
🖖
If it was me I would get my equipment out of one place right away.
Assuming Mike's fire was caused by a battery cable; my question is: are these tractors required to be parked similar to our vehicles in that even though the engine is not running, are other systems still under power hence they require a battery be hooked up and under load? Is it feasible to disconnect a farming tractor's battery when not actually being used?
What a shame....  I’ll be praying for him and his family
Hello Laura, it is regrettable to hear your narrative about this great loss of material goods that were consumed by fire, however, the good ones will always be graced by God for their deeds and you are one of those people. Greetings from São Paulo Brazil
@MillennialFarmer would have used this time to talk about simplysafe lolz
So sad. With such a large operation, I would look into a compressed foam unit to fight small fires, especially if you're far away from services. Alarms wired to the house etc..
The people have seen this too many times it seems like that the Democratic government is out to destroy farmers and burning their barns with their animals and burning their toolsheds with all their farm equipment is part of their MO
Thanks Laura and Grant for your post about Mike in Nebraska.
I'm almost 80 years old. A good portion my life was involved with farming. Not owning anything, but helping and working for farmers that I've known all  my life. What  happened is awfully sad. Thank God nobody was hurt. Physically hurt. I'm on Social Security and I don't have much money, so I can't send anything, but I can pray. I can earnestly pray... and I will do that. I wish Mike and his family all good fortune in the days to come.
If this fella C of C by any chance? I'll bring it up at Church.
So Sad. Thanks to all the farmers out there. You are America's most precious commodity❤
Laura you should sell your shirts and donate the money to Mike for I time
Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
Colhetadeira  e. A. Mãe do.   Insendio  pega. Fogo. Atoa  e. Um. Perigo 😞😢
What started the fire? Electric?
ask Millennial Farmer  what group help harvest farmers I forgot the name.
Also the following for Mike https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/emergency-relief/index.
I bet that combine is still worth $700,000 lolz
Je regarde vos vidéos depuis la France.Bon courage.
Juat don't believe this is coincedence.
insurance and preventive measures, the other side of farming.
Consider adding fire detection system to your buildings. Fire proofing steel is expensive. Same for sprinklers.
But I guess most farms don't have any fire suppression systems And the sheds Sorry for the  Lost
https://www.lankford.senate.gov/contact/email I am attaching Oklahoma Senator James Lankford information, the US government spends Millions of US Tax dollars abroad and Mike in Nebraska need HELP NOW.
What a horrible story Mike keep your head up over time it will all be replaced Laura and Grant please help him with harvest if at all possible do what you can the farming community will come together to help him prayers to Mike and his family
SORRY FOR THE LOSS TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER PRAYERS OUT TO MIKE AND FAMILY 🙏🙏🙏
Laura. Vc. Tem seguro de  Tudo. Isso. Aí  espero Que   Sim
Bless them Lord!!
SAD 😢 I'll keep everyone in my PRAYERS 🙏🙏
Farm Rescue what can they do to help. If we can get some Basketball player Home from Russia Then there should be some help for these People. Many Prayers
Discussing the value of farm equipment is not bragging. 99.9% of people have zero knowledge of farming, the cost, the work required, and the risk. I worked on a farm in my teenage years and I learned alot. I wish everyone could have a better understanding of it all. I think your channel is helping greatly in that respect.
Prayers to Mike and his family on getting back to normal as fast as possible. Cudos to you guys for helping. From a long time Volunteer fireman - look into a fire supression system in your building. Sprinklers can put out a fire before anyone even notices. Your insurance agent can help as well as your local or state fire marshal.
Insurance should cover it all
This has to be one of the most emotional video you have done , stay safe and a good crop year
Battery switches can save you from fire. 😮 🙏
Be back in a bit….
Hmmmmm.....after decades and generations without a fire it just so happens on a night when everything was inside. A lot of mysterious fires at chicken farms lately as well.
❤
What burned??  .. fuel, chemicals, etc??  Can such things be stored seperately on a farm?
😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞..medapena..
Good job on the awareness info        alert!!   Prayers for all  involved here!!!    Thanks for      sharing!!!      👍🐺🧙‍♂️
It's sad that he lost all of that equipment. If this guy had the correct insurance for his farm, he could replace everything at no extra cost to him.
Oi  Laura  vc. Sumiu  Ok  está. acontecendo   Sempre. Vc. Mostra.   Máquina. Insendiada  ok  Foe. Isso. Não. E. Bom  E. Prejoiso. Isso. Dói.  Boa. Pra. Vc. 😢😢
There's no doubt that there was a TON of diesel that fueled that fire and the intense heat that destroyed that machinery.  Prayers for the family.
Prayers lifted for this family

Laura, I will send your friend some money because he deserves help.  But I'd like you viewers to consider that this destruction is being done on the wholesale industrial scale EVERYDAY for more then a year by the Russian government to the farmers of the Ukraine and the populations they (formally) fed.  Imagine a government in this wold causing this kind of destruction un purpose in this world.  I'm sorry for this farmer, I grieve for people, and especially the farmers, of the Ukraine.
Laura. I know, expensive. But in the EU, automatic fire extinguishing equipment is mandatory. Not by chance. The sensor detects the smoke and the fire extinguishing system is activated. Let everything be wet, but don't burn everything...
One word: sprinklers
how convenient that all his farm equipment was packed into one building when it caught fire...a tragedy for the insurance company --- tis one way to afford all new equipment...
Folks, I don't  speak out often. However, in this instance (especially with the war being waged against farmers by the Marxist left) it falls to each of us to step up in a big way. If anyone that follows Laura has afforded themselves even a milk shake . . . then you can afford to help this farmer. Without him you might not have that last meal. Give, and give big. And pray as if it were your home. Your livelihood. Your future.   In Jesus name . . . Amen.
Get hold of millanial farmmer and he can get hold of farm rescue
Your volume is too low.
Having family and generations of hard work……it’s nice to see young people that have that understanding.
Donation sent. I’m So very sorry for your loss brother. Prayers for you all.
did he set it on fire to collect insurance? my neighbor is asking
God bless you my dear friends
God bless you my dear friends
Get a Go Fund Me Page started many folks will help the family get back on their feet.
What a terrible loss for him !😢
🙏🙏🙏
Hopefully it was insured!
So so sad stay strong mate from Australia 🇦🇺
9:55 July 12th? When was this recorded?
So sorry for Mike and his family
Be back shortly….
Aluminum melts at about 1200 degrees
This is very sad!  Would you post this to Facebook, so that it can be shared to more people?
Sorry😢😢
We don't have money, I do have my two hands and some time.  What do you need Mike?  You are part of America's Backbone!  Laura please let him know he is appreciated and Loved!
Sprinkler systems?? Any fire supression methods?
I have a riding lawnmower he can have for free but he has to come and get it Hyde Park New York
That is heartbreaking. Best wishes to Mike from England; and I'll contribute to some to his GoFundMe site. Please keep us updated as time passes. It puts our own troubles into perspective.
If all 456k subscribers contribute $5.00 each, this will make a huge impact and probably get close to covering his insurance gap….this is an opportunity to make a difference in a family’s livelihood—let’s show the power of numbers today and together: let’s go! Love what you do Laura and thank you for this opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives. 👏🏻👏🏻✌🏻
Any time your livelihood goes up and destroyed, no matter the life you have or the business you rely on, it is very devastating.  I am sharing this to people, to try and help this man, and his family. Prayers for him, and thank you for making us aware of this family😢
😥🙏😘
SMUTNE ! ALE NIKT MĄDRY NIE TRZYMA SKARBÓW W JEDDYM BUDYNU !!! UCZCIE SIĘ !

This reminds me of the Texas dairy farm that was set on fire a few months ago, and it took 18k cows with it.
Such a tragedy, insurance?   Is there a need for a fire alarm system, and fire extinguishers?
I would look into some kind of fire suppression installations. Foam, Powder or water, SOMETHING. I had them in both my restaurants and all the gas stations have them.
With the price of machinery and everything today a fella has to have a sprinkler system in case of a fire a lot of farmers need to think of that because things are so expensive today and maybe if he had sprinkler system he might have not lost everything
Laura, I suggest contacting Farm Rescue on his behalf. The group Zach Johnson and the Larsons support .They do cover a wide area including Nebraska.
Very Sad!
its called insurence  :) ur welcome
Aircraft hangars have foam fire suppressuion deluge systems. Are those, or just water systems, available/possible for buildings like this?
LOVELY 👸👸🥰👍
I gave $25 so wish I could send more
Put a call into Farm Rescue.  They could probably help.
Install simple fire sprinklers. Insurance would love you.
😢
DANG MAN
Mike to Mike donation done.
Good evening  I'm come from Thailand
