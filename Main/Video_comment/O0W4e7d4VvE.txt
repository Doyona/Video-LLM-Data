What was your favourite moment from the game? 💬
Still the best match since Fergie.
Take me back
Ronaldo walks down the tunnel
we won 3 0 with roanldo against spurs now we last 0 3 against spurs
Lol ronaldo wouldve finished that rashford chance with ease the amount of disrespectful ETH showed ronaldo after being a top 3 scorer in prem carrying the team with david and then losing hos child is crazy man
What a game 🎯
CASEMIRO casemiTO
Ez win 🔥🔥🔥🔥👀🙌🏼
We kept kane and son quiet
What happened to this team 😢
Loris lucky guy
Lloris does not like Rashford man 🤣🤣
FORZA INTER 🔵⚫🔵⚫
manchester is RED
Ten hag Mandul
Hope we will win again on the second  match
i want to watch full match😢
Marcuss rashfod the best
amazing performance love from a spurs fan
7-0
Hahaha 6-1
Lloris Kept The Score Respectable
I told Tottenham to wear the white jersey now look
Fabulous from Bruno
Rashford improve goal score after tottenham.
Enzo Fernandez and Icardi
Tottenham racism ，Kick it out of the top eight
The first REAL UTD performance in absolute ages, that was! 2-0 flattered Spurs. 3 more suitable recruits/promotions or returns to the first team, one for each of attack/mid/defence and who knows..?
Nice
You Mancs won 2-0 against spurs, but the funny part is that those spurs fans still sang loudly and had a better atmosphere in that away end than you Manc bin dippers.😂🤣🐀🐁
Typical Manc rashford, he can't even finish his chances in frustration. Lloris is a better keeper than that Manc rat de gea who tried to fight Trent. Typical Mancs 😂
Loris respect

The team had great energy for 90 mins wish we could play like that all the time!
come on to Manchester united oppa son
In Ten Hag's first 3 months at the club we've beaten Klopp's Liverpool, Conte's Tottenham and Arteta's Arsenal....let that sink in🙂
Super man United at home
Please Manchester United Ronaldo strike
arguably uniteds best performance of the season? you kidding me, yea decent against a wellequipped conte side but come on the two goals were mild at best, lucky deflection for a poor shot by fred and another lucky deflection from another poor shot from fred setting up bruno for a classic finish, but other chances were all self created by antony and rashford more or less,  there was a little all team threat, maybe defense played great, didnt see a single chance on our goal, or is that just utd channels bias in the highlights
So… we’re not gonna talk about Ronaldo?
Where’s Maguire at 😢
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm a ManCity💙 fan but that was ManUtds best performance the goals were 💯 top draw and Ronaldo took it away fronm them 🙆🏽‍♂️🥺
Let's not call it an 'Unbelievable Performance', Man Utd should display this level of performance every matchday.
Who said Martinez is too short and will struggle in the Premier League

I don't know.. Why ETH never put Ronaldo as the first starting line-up? Does ETH want Ronaldo to leave Manchester United?
Ronaldo 😓😓
PLEASE MAY WE HAVE EXTENED HIGHLIGHTS LIKE OTHER TEAMS !!
Your pulling the wrong strings...
Great players can do great things in pitch even without a great manager, do you think ETH was great in manu club... THINK manu was doing great right now becoz of ETH .. A GREAT NOOOO.
RESPEC RONALDO....
Mantap trending
I just want to give 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 for Lloris🔥🔥🔥 he so amazing
And that ball boy is an United fan😍
rashford wasteful chances.
Eric ten hug have to resign from man  u o
Ronaldo kemana...
Loris 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Fred selalu memaksakan diri, faktor keberuntungan
Lebih seru tujuh bulan yang lalu 👍👍👍 Manchester united vs Tottenham Hotspur
just imagine de jong and gakpo in this team
MU.. bagus mainnya.
Let’s be honest and get the things right, you can’t always conceal the facts and label cristiano as the problem.   1. Last season CR7 performed quite well even at a dysfunctional Manchester United, Managed to score 18 PL goals and 6 UCL goals. Inarguably those goals helped United to be in EL At least,  without them they would’ve downgraded even lower in the table.   2. Managers were frequently changing and players were clueless, at least those who did better were CR7 and Deagea. Lack of cohesion was visible among the teammates then.  3. Harry Maguire was terrible last year, lack of aggression, non adherence to his position, seen injuring own teammates in few matches. Indeed at the back he was leaking balls to make it easy for the opposition instead of leading from the front as a captain. Keeping a player like Eric Bailey on bench United let play maguire and Bailey has expressed his disgruntlement on that once he loaned out to OM.   4. Many players have left United this summer ,POGBA, Telles, Bailey, Cavani, Lingard , Matic , Mata and many others. Many have joined  Antony, Martinez, Casemiro , Malacia and Eriksen. You can’t lie about the fact that team has changed, there were top signings which has contributed to the team so far and so stop lying that by keeping Cristiano out the team has bettered their performance. And he hasn’t got enough time to play and perform better along with these new players and team. If he could score last season 24 goals, you shouldn’t be doubting to play him with rejuvenated team. He’ll deliver for sure.   5. From the beginning of the season, ETH asserted that CR7 is not for sale and he’s in his plan. If keeping him on the bench was the plan, then why the heck hasn’t he let him go in the first place? It’s clearly Man United wanted him as their talisman and his name for the club’s image and its business, CR7 is an exceptional professional who is willing to walk extra miles for his fitness and endurance with a relentless discipline to be on the field. That’s the reason he could remain the third top scorer even at 37 in PL which is considered to be toughest league. So you gotta admit he’s built different and can pull off the challenges hands down.   6. All the drama in the beginning of the season around him might have put him under pressure and he wasn’t getting enough time to get over it by scoring and gag his critics as he typically does. ETH is still intimidating him by giving less time or no time with the rejuvenated team. stop villainizing CR7 and tie all the Man United issues that’s happening deep inside at the board level and on the field to him, In fact by joining United Cristiano has got more damage than the concocted problem claim for the club. There were reports that he had met psychologist to discuss and sort out depressing scenarios he’s currently going through, but club and ETH has done nothing to help him to get back his momentum and morale instead they aggravated by labeling him as problematic.   7. He outperformed and outplayed everyone in the last season in the matches against Tottenham and still ETH reluctant to give him a fair amount of game time. when he got the opportunity against Everton he had scored with a descent stats and show.   8. Even after all of this, we believe he’ll rise above this hate and criticism like he did always for the past 2 decades.   CR7 is GOAT not a scapegoat !!!
Nanti malam sangat panas mu vs chelse
Why not play ronaldo???
Unlucky Win🤣🤣🤣
Роналдо 🔥🔥🔥
TEN HAG OUT🖕
Only gay not on this team is Ronaldo
Only gay not on this team is Ronaldo
Only gay not on this team is Ronaldo
1-0 ⚽Fred, he shot it in the middle, but was deflected, tricked so many, own goal. Win against big team, important! 👍 Chelsea will suffer! 😮😆
awesome! 🟥
2 lucky give away goals
This time CR7 must move from mu
Wow Casemiro in Man Utd ❤
I want to join in Manchester United
I honestly think this was the best performance since fergie days
No Ronaldo no party
Martinez play very well 👏👊
Lloris respect
Hogo my man of da match for spurs come on conte
Where is Ronaldo
Amazing goal by Fernandez
United is something else right now.. This is coming from Gooner. I personally believe that United will be in top 4 with City, Arsenal and someone else (maybe Chelsea). I just don't see that Tottenham can keep up with these performances. United looks very dangerous - looked very dangerous against us aswell and that's why we got our arses whooped.
Please dont play ronaldo against chelsea...he will kill us....please
That is my only team MNU oyeee
Rashford is missing too many gold these days
Where is Spurs highlight?
ronaldo by itself can score 3 vs Tottenham
Justice for ronaldo..!! 😂
Manchester Manchester united!!!!!
No Ronaldo, No Maguer ...  # MU It's Ok ...
Kalah di hujat Menang di hujat Itulah Ten Hag😁😁😁😁
kok bangga ? , 2 gol krna blunder lawan aja haha
ggmu🔥🔥🔥
Manchester, say goodbye to CR7. He's done like dinner.
Useless manager
Call back mourinho please
glazers out
I like Freddy lol
Post newcastle draw. Cowards.
Rian Giggs is the best coach for MU, he dicipline like fergie
The only negative is that Stewart Gardner was back on commentary.
With this performance, we should top the leagues
Tottenham have never been a big club and wont be too :) . Casemiro gave big contribution so far but what United needs is a creative midfielder like De Bruyne or Thiago . I believe this is the huge lack from general assessment  .
if it werrnt for lloris, shaw would have scored one of the best goals for man utd this year
It was a great performance.  But instead of trying to ram social media down the millions of fans throats that live abroad.. who don't know what the glazers have done to this club.. and our stadium.. Guys always remember  GLAZERS OUT
Penaldog is finished
Ten hag a big Clown 🤡🤡🤡
Great game by man utd , but spurs did look static whole game ?
Rushford needs to use his  brain when he shoots , curl the ball in the corner ,don't need power all the time ,aim for the corner of goal,  he needs to work at this
We don't support Manchester United we support Ronaldo SUIIII 🇵🇹🇵🇹
Great performance guys! We still want Glazers out!
I support the Boss, for club, for victory.
Tanpa CeeR si fixgol emyu malah win, jd teringat lawan Brentford pke CeeR kmren 😂
manchester is red but ronaldo returned to this team for you but you left ronal doy out of the squad
Ronaldo out
Manchester united remains the biggest club in the world 🌎🌍
de gea could have had a nap during this game :)
spurs don´t play they just survive
Big is big
What kind of jersey did Tottenham even put on
Ronaldo is not appreciated in the manchester united team😢
RASHFORD NEEDS TO PUT IT IN THE NET MORE
Viva Ronaldo....
💐💐👏👏♥️♥️♥️
SO AMAZING
Who is WE and US and OUR   it is They
Antony and Martinez both refused to play for Ajax to get a transfer to United and he signs them  Strange  nothing is said about buying them with that attitude   oh its Ajax   give them more money

Selamat buat MU menang 2-0 atas totenham Awalnya gw semangat nonton MU karna CR7 tapi dia tidak main y udh gw matiin tuh tv
I am happy for this win, but also very disappointed with the treatment of ronaldo, for me he is still a legend at united.  United player who has ever won the ballon d' or when he played at united besides best, law and Charlton.If the coach doesn't like ronaldo, why did he keep it, why not just sell it, but don't embarrass the living legend of united. F**# u ten hag.  It seems I don't really like United anymore like I did when I was little, like the era of Robson, Cantona, Giggsy, Ronaldo. Because the current players have no respect and tend to be arrogant.
"arguably Manchester United's best performance of the season" now me personally, I wouldn't let that slide
What a solid performance
Ronaldo needs to leave Man. United & find a club that appreciate who he is... Base on his age... Wasting time on the bench... Is like retiring in the prime of his career... Obviously this coach hates Ronaldo.
great win
Oh Ronaldo...kenapa GK di mainin
We're cruising through the league. It honestly doesn't feel real
Ronaldo kembalilah ke juventus...
how about if Kane change his shirt next season to united..
Ливерпуль сила❤️🇺🇿
Ten hag out!!!  Ronaldo in !!!
Kecewa sama ronaldo
Cr7 > bayern munchen 💓💓💓💓
Thank you lads, for making my debut visit to Old Trafford a blessing! <3 Couldn't ask for a better experience! Was so fun seeing Fred dominate! All of you were top notch! <3
Manchester United  bast gool
Great game - Could n't stop watching - all the team working.
Akhirnya fred sadar bahwa dia orang brazil
Antony was crucial for both the goals.
Ronaldo > M.United
the cause of Ronaldo's performance dropping because the playmaker doesn't support it because he's jealous of Ronaldo and the playmaker Bruno Fernandes if Eriksen or others surely Ronaldo finds the best servant Bruno egoist shouldn't appear
Welcome
2 -0 is an unbelievable performance. Soccer blows. No idea why half the world pretends its enjoyable. What you really enjoy is the commeraderie which you can get with any sport that is much better to watch.
The firs goal how did it was almost a save lucky
손흥민 짱
Rashford need to improve on his finishes

Martial for rashford
let Cristiano the Mega star go
What ETH doing when he was 38 years old? If Christiano wanted to be a coach, ETH can retire now.
Ronaldo ????
Bro please dont make ronaldo a bench seater
CR7 EL MEJOR,  QUE RÁPIDO SE OLVIDAN DEL MEJOR DEL MUNDO Y LE FALTAN EL RESPETO...QUE SE VALLA PRONTO DEL UNITED
ليش متخلون رونالدو ايشارك ضد الشليسي أو بالتشكيلة
Let them just release Ronaldo from the team
Rip Erik ten hag
The worse Tottenham Hotspur of the season. This is selling smoke.
No beautiful goals 😄
Did i see it wrongly or was both goals were missed kicks by Fred??? Regardless….nice win!
Benching Ronaldo against Tottenham, city, Liverpool and Arsenal. Disrespect on the highest level
What about to Ronaldo!!??🥺🥺🥺
Let's see if I can get my first 10 new subscribers here ,thank you .
Manchester United I have been a fan u but the way u guys don’t show what ronaldo deserves is breaking  my heart
Best game.. yet!
TEN HAG HAD ZERO RESPECT FOR LIVING LEGEND(ČŘ7)❤😌
I wish united lost against chelsea.
Rashford passing accuracy is just amazing 😎
Bruno goals is wow 😮
where is ronaldo
Antony will become one of the greatest one day..if he keep him well.
ggmu
Rashford needs to use his brain more than his energy. Too much power in what should be an easy finish. Twice, not even once.
Rashford is like a quality pen which stops working from time to time 🫤. He can do much much better. All the best Rash!!
RONALDO BAD ATTITUDE OUT GO AWAY 🔥🔥🔥

Ten hag not respect to ronaldo
people who said it was just spurs needs to remember that they're currently no 3 at the table and only lost 1 match before this. this was the most complete performance yet from ten hag's man united
CONGRATS C RONALDO✊
Best defence in the prem!
The recovery rate from UTD was amazing 😍😍 Fred surprised 🙀 me

Kembalikan kejayaan ronaldo, berikan menit bermain untuknya😔😔😔
# emran khan Khulna

Cara, vcs precisam contratar um camisa 10 para o lugar desse Rashford, que jogador fraco...
Why isn't Cristiano Ronaldo playing?
Why isn't Cristiano Ronaldo playing?
38 shots against omonia before netting one now to this this inconsistency in finishing is why we need a new striker and in my opinion Jonathan david would be perfect I just hope man u recruitment team consider him
Gollll.. goolll.. goollll
Man U Getting better without Cr7
I think people forget that last match against Tottenham Ronald score hat trick .....but this match he is not playing in team 😩😩
as*
If Ronaldo is no longer needed, let him go. He needs hours of play, to increase his confidence. The lack of him scoring goals, due to lack of confidence. At least Ronaldo can be released from the contract, returning to MU is a form of appreciation for the club that has made his name. Respect him who still wants to continue to play and love Manchester United.
Best performance from Ronaldo so far this season👏👏👏👏 Factos👀👀
Why alway ronaldo ! Forget every thing done for red stop disrespact of your lengand🤢
If ronaldo will leave a few manchester united fan will stay,
Respect Ronaldo !
it supposed to be fred!
No Ronaldo needed 😏
A quiet thank you to CR7  for all his games in the red shirt....bless you..but it's a new era  xx
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !.

Why did you don't let ronaldo play what is this?
Fred and Lloris man of the match
This is best man United performance  this season so far.. kudos the lads, We go again on Saturday GGMU ❤️ 💪🏻💪🏻
My fav team is man u since 17 years....but I don't like cr7...he is not humble, i rather preffer messi...he starts from the bench too but doesn't leave half-way
Totenham sengaja ngalah kayaknya soalnya biar MU gak dibenci2 bngt
I am cr7
Media indo memberitakan gembar gembor katanya MU kalahkan Tottenham dengan gol indah , nyatanya gol ketemu aja gol sampah 💩💩💩

Rashfords finishing is disgusting atm, he's pumping up the stats of all goalkeepers he's playing by aiming at their chest 🤣

Why no c. Ronaldo
I have huge respect for Sir Alex Ferguson, but one thing I have to say to him that it was his fault that brought Cristiano Ronaldo back to the useless team United, if he let Ronaldo move for example; to Man City so now he won the Ballon'dor again instead of Kerim Benzema. Thanks to you Sir Alex Ferguson as C. Ronaldo a worthless player in United's eyes. One more thing that I must mention is that Erik Tan Hag is L. Messi's supporter, that's why he doesn't let C. Ronaldo play. Let C. Ronaldo play or leave Uited (Erik Tan Hag!?) 😡 💔 😡

I don't like you guys treating ronaldo he's a legend and is at his best but you especially ten hag to make him look like a loser
Bagus CR7 pindah dari MU..👍
RASHFORD is making every Goal keeper look like a prime Buffon 😏
Com on man!! This is YouTube we need 20 mins of video please🙏🏾🙏🏾
a question to the creators of the video, why do you write the final score of the match in the title?
Tenhag nyari ronaldo tp gak ada🤣🤣
Disgusting having a racist bully coach like Ten Haag
Geez, we played amazing could of score 6 or 7.
Can you give us Sonny if you R not gonna use it?
Is it me or does 99% of rashfords shot end up on the keeper?
M team beautifull
Casemiro MOTM

The French goalkeeper must be the man of the match
Let s see if Ten hag gets a ticket home if obliterated from chelsea
This match miss Cristino like last year.
Run Ronaldo Run
Menanti Kang Dodo beraksi
Did Tottenham even get a shot on target?
This was a performance reminiscent of football in the Fergie era.
Sod una plasta de vaca sacar al calvo  de técnico del equipo respeta a una cabra q tú no lo eres no eres nadie cristiano el mejor
I have watched this  8 times,....
this match will make you ask yourself that will herry kane score in the world cup or he"ll take penalties
Rashford really needs to work on his finishing ability.
🌋🔥🔥🔥
Gk ada Ronaldo gk seru....
Boncing goal and bouncing assist . What a goat performance by fred
Yahooooo🙀
Siuuuu
Fred is the man played very well against Tottenham ❤
Only Ronaldo!
Tim la wabov🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like the hijabi child next to de gea
Antony ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please try to place CR7 in the starting 11
Ronny 😭
United am happy 🥰🥰🥰🥰
What did Cristiano Ronaldo brother do to you? MAN UNITED Please play Ronaldo in the first11. The man deserves to play in the starting 11. As Ronaldo's biggest fan, give him another chance. Obir Yildiz. He was the best football player of the REAL MADRID Period. The best player of the era. And it still is in my eyes. Please play cristiano ronaldo
Cristiano Ronaldo the best player of all time is being discredited by the Manchester United club that saw him in glorious afternoons, we must end the prosecution of abusive and criminal terms against the best player in the world
I have the feeling that Fred just atracts lucky goals, so he's very valuable.
Retiro mi suscripcion de este canal .no es posible tantas faltas de respeto a cristiano y seguir cubriendo los malos resultados dejando a ten hag como tecnico by
For me Dalot is the most converted player under ETH, as a RB he's defending and also creating many chances from the right wing with Antony  What a magnificent transformation it has been till now!
It was a sensational game... with a game like that I wouldn't have minded had we lost
Para que fichan a cr7 si no lo quieren. Que falta de respeto y humillación por parte del club.😕
I really wish Man Utd lose every single game by 6-0 when CR7 is not starting so that ETH is kicked out of the door. Go Home 🏡 ETH
In this match.. We can see rasford is vert not lucky.
FU guys for messing up ronaldo's form. Didn't deserve this after what he did for the club last year
🇮🇩
Ciye menang
Really dominant performance form United, I expected them to sit back and allow Tottenham attack after a while but to my surprise they continued to pile the misery on spurs...just that Rashford wasn't clinical enough, the chance at 2:05 of this video could have easily been a goal if he tried to curl/finnesse it into the top corner, this is where we miss Martial, ain't no way Martial would play a straight shot to the keeper twice, either he dribbles and curls into the corner or he chips the keeper depending on the distance. Also, CR7 needs to leave, as he has become too proud to handle, refusing to come on as a sub for Rashford and leaving in the 89th minute, that's totally unacceptable behaviour especially for such an experienced player.
Ronaldo has hâve his days man
Тоттенхэм хоть перешёл центр поля?
بدنا بصل احمر تبع مونا
Fred anti mainstream 😂
This performance comes only in one or two matches ...let's see in upcoming matches hope for the best
Finnaly the man united i want to see 😎
2 lucky gols!!
Who noticed the blush of excitement on the girl walking with Bruno Fernades
Could've easily been 5 or 6, Lloris played brilliantly though
We won and one famous player walked out to the tunnel
everything was best we win but where is  ronaldo erik ten hag have to send him in next matches
Read my name
Bring ronaldo on then
Que injusto con Cristiano .....es un maltrato para una leyenda.
Fred’s goal
Rashford kicks every ball straight at the keeper
Love United but this disrespectful to CR7 is too much
Congratulations to the Red Devils on winning! 🔴👹
Underated performance from Lloris i know i know he conceded two goals but just look at his saves 🤩🤩
Chelsea goona smoke you guys stay happy
What is happening to CR7? not a team player anymore! he is acting like a spoiled brat!! bad for the team -:(
ten ham los tendra como El barcelona , solo ganar Uno's cuantos partidos y no campeonar basura de entrenador
No Ronaldo - Yes party
Best performance of the season
CR7 the best paid man utd player just disrespected the entire man utd squad and ten hag, in front of the home crowd
It was only against Spuds, people need to calm down.
Bye Bye Ronaldo😆😆😆
Love me some Fred
Hugo Lloris have to change team he's too strong to play a team who don't win trophees
Lord is no lord a gain 😄😄, Bravo....
Anthony's first shot felt like Robben's way of shooting, run down the wing, cut in and shoot
ese rashfor deben de ponerle algo en esa pata para que meta los tiros todos directo al portero bien malo que es
Dang!!
Casemiro is trying to be prime ronaldo
I like Cristiano Ronaldo 😌🖐🏽💪🏼
Antony participate 2 goals
Team work fantastic!!¡!
LUAR BIASAAAAAA

Not a United fan but always happy to see tottenham loose.
The Red Devil is back😬😬😬
Should've been 5-0 given the chances that weren't finished properly.
Thật ra, tôi chỉ xem lại các trận đấu có CR7. Còn lại MU đá sao thì kệ các vị 😂

From  the title with unbelievable..just beaten totenham..you said unbelievable xi..xi..  I think when you beaten City..you will write..THE GREAT HISTORY MOMENT..
Rashford need to work on his shot precision
Really awesome game man United...🔥💪 David Malaysia 🇲🇾
Every ❤
An Amazing performance( and Players of the match ( to Me )) of Man United Attacking Midfilder/Capitain B. Hernandez and THS Goal keeper/Capitain H. LIoris.  Is that yesterday's Man United players performance casts the return back of the FEAR FACTOR OF OLD TRAFFORD ?. Worth watching play !.
Casemiro 😘😘😘
Licha licha licha hes a beast from Argentina please someone make this a chant
🤟
Man utd dominate the game vs Spurs but why ronaldo is in bench whats wrong with tan hag. Is he jealous of scoring by Ronaldo or wat?
Rashford i believe in you.  This year 2 hattricks.  Mark my words.
Great game
Tan hag mentally tortured Ronaldo dats not fair.
Why is rashford on the team?
This is easily united's best performance this season, if only rashford can finish those chances.. he always shot low to the center of the goal, which what every goalkeeper's want. he needs to learn shot placement.. shoot the ball rolling on the ground, to the left or right post, or lob the ball outside the goalkeeper's reach.. vary the finish..
Did Tottenham have highlights??
Keep it up guys we all wants to see you again in champion's league again
เทนฮาก  นายควรให้โอกาสเด็ก อคาเดมี่ลงสนามท้ายเกมบ้างนะ  นายจพซื้อนักเตะใหม่มาอย่างเดียวไม่ได้นะ
GGMU
Kami fans dari Indonesia sangat bangga dengan hasil ini
Despite the loss, that was a Balon d'Or performance from Hugo Lloris.
Seems like Fred needs the tough pill before he performs. It’s becoming a trend now.
Rashford shooting accuracy is 10%
Mais uma vez o Fred salvando o United

Man U had luck
Where is the walk off from that person b4 full-time ?? Show it !!!
Unsubscribe Man. Unite YouTube channel.... Support Ronaldo # Stop disrespect Ronaldo.... Show some respect to him.....
What a play 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ronaldo idola Saad😢
A total shots of 28, such a jaw dropping display can only be done by the REDS 💪 by far the most shots in the league this season. Lets go reds, we going for all the smoke this season.
A pleasure to watch! Absolute class
Nice win tho i don't like Sancho nor Rashy to start in their form losing too many chances
Props to Lloris, He saved Spurs from an absolute goalfest.
Where is maguire😢
2:06 rashford know the  feeling in fifa  22 when you keep shooting n can’t score
Fix ronaldo better no play
rashford has got no goals in him

The best game so far! High intensity ! I like it a lot!
Josss 👍
Man Utd Social Media Win : Uploading Highlights Lost : Naahhhh..  LOL!😂😅 No offense lads, cause its a fact. Isnt it?
lord FRED
И что же невероятного?
Benny Mac, we need you to help Rashords finishing.
Very well played
Why did they leave Ronaldo on the bench Ronaldo is feeling disrespected now
What a magical played
Cristiano en la banca?. El mejor jugador del mundo. Cómo es posible que se célebre ganarle a un equipo de media tabla para abajo.... Que basura de tecnico y equipo!!!
transfer rashford that man is useless
Rashford needs to learn how to finish always tries to thundercunt it into the net needs to try actually placing them
haha.. menang upload kalah engga..haha takut dibully ya..🤣
First time ever seen highlights with NO attacking highlights from other team
Where’s Cristiano
쓰레기영입  토트넘 수비들좀 갈아치워라
nice game
When your favorite football club decided to stop being a meme
Where is Hurry The legend of Mun United ?
this should not be unbelievable, this should be the standard for us.
🤙
Me cae mal Ten Hag por no meter a CRISTIANO
Rashford has to learn how to sidefoot and place his shots. Power doesn't solve it all the time
this was some really beautiful to watch yesterday oh my days👌🏽
it's okay roanldo isn't playing,,,congratulations to manchester on the spurs win,,,but we'll see if this squad is able to win with chelsea... We hope that CR should go focus on the world cup and a new club that appreciates you cris
Потрясающий матч в исполнении МЮ! Просто огонь! Кейн и Сон ничего не смогли сделать с нашей защитой, а наш центр и атака были тоже на высоте. И, конечно, какой-то турбо-режим включил Льорис. Если бы не он, то счёт был бы разгромным. С победой МЮ! GGMU!
What'd I tell you, Fred the goat
Part of me thinks spurs should've stick with the home kit not this kit🤢🤮🤮🤮
That was one of the best performances ever 🔥 Congratulations my team Man United❤️‍🔥
The one match I miss is our best performance. Great win nonetheless!
I'll tell you all something, Pep Guardiola is successful only because he spent billions of dollars over the years.  Erik Ten Hag is known for producing youth talent from ranks/academy which he proved with Ajax by beating European giants like Real Madrid,Juventus,Man City and more consistently and even conceding only 5 goals a season.  I'm telling you this man is upto building something very big at Utd. We just need to support him in this process & the board also should back him all out in his transfer decisions. We will be the Gladiators of European Football soon.
Wow wow casemiro ♥️♥️♥️♥️
real deal now, love it, twentefan fc
Bravo United, from city fan
Antony plays very well💥💥
After a long long time a match worthwhile to watch…played well boys….GGMU
Как же я мечтал увидеть такой мю .
Im chelsea fan. But the casameiro signing is the best transfer man utd has made after ferguson stopped.
Ronaldo 💖
if it wasn't for Lloris we would have scored more GGMU
BIG WIN 👊💪
Even manu YouTube admin can’t believe in this performance. What a joke of a club
let's go my team 🖤
Luuaarr biasaaa.. GLORY glory MU💪👏
This was awesome
Penaldo 😂😂
Ten hag kntl ronaldo gak di Mainin
Great game overall. Rashford needs to improve his striking technicability. Not power strikes only.
Wow! Sincerely speaking it was an excellent performance ever seen,under Erick ten hag,,,,, hoping for the best,,
I want Casemiro,Eriksen,Malacia & the others score the first goal.
Bruno what a goal
That’s increadeble but i’m self Liverpool fan 😂
No this guy hates Ronaldo
props to hugo man
I like the spirit 🔥🔥🔥 Go Go MU 😎
🔥🔥🔥Should have ended 5-0
🤒 Rashford is unlucky yesterday But Rashford could have struck that ball on the right-hand side of Hugo He can't get it there ❤ Manchester I love this team✅✅❤😍
Skills antony beautiful
Help me tell Ronaldo that there's time for everything...
Rasford needs to learn more about placing the ball coz everytime he shoot he always shoot hardest.
i love Cristiano....i hate ten hag 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 🤡🤡🤡

Top performance 👏
We really miss Maguire in the back

Sayang mas Dodo ga di mainkan...
Gol MU semuanya indah sekali
tth played very bad especially in midfield,ball control,overcome the pressure,counter attacks
Sad for Pendu
Did I hear the commentator say United best performance of the season
Winning !!
How can miss that goal. Fernandes cant
I will went back to dressing room as well, after saw many opportunities were wasted
saatnya bilang MU NIH BOS, SENGGOL DOONGG!!!
I used to call out Fred for being rubbish and lazy -  did they sell him and buy a completely different player also called Fred?
Consistency is the key 🔥🔥🔥
We played Tottenham like they were omonia
It's better for Ronaldo to leave Manchester United because  Ten Hag don't respect you anymore
Hugo Lloris' saves were masterful
I AM VERY ANGRY ON ERIK TEN HAG BECAUSE HE DISRESPECT OUR LEGEND CR7😠😠😠😠😠😠
Ggmu ❤️
Hey come on Mr Erik,i want to see back old RONALDO
Wow what a fantastic performance well done guys❤️❤️❤️
GGMU
Without Lloris it's 10-0
អេម💪💪
We need antony martial
Rashford must stop with those power shots busy blasting the goalkeepers, they don't work...he should learn to aim and finesse...some goals don't need power, just the right pick of the side. Otherwise GGMU🤩🚩
RAPHA & LISANDRO ❤ 🇾🇪
Selamat buat MU ,,,tapi sedikit ikut menganalisa ,,,,masih kurangnya kerjasama antar pemain di dlm kotak penalti ,,,para pemain MU selalu memaksakan untuk untuk shoot padahal posisi sudah di ttup pemain lawan ,,,,padahal di situ dlm kotak ada pemain MU yg tanpa pengawalan ,,,,
@manchesterunited You Missed Fernades Off side goal
The best match played by utd since sir alex left❤️
Teg we all know what u doing u just scared of the RONALDO's name gonna be big on the screen if we win ...but one day u'll get punished for it..6 months only left for him
We need another Ruud van Nistelrooy fast!
Argueably, United best performance..  And Fred involve in all their goals.
Siuu
rash. 2 one v one. need to score at least one. man u need a better natural striker to turn chances into goal with less labour.
Rashford Is Weakness for United.. Martial Could Have Made It 2 More For Us.. We Need to Go For Striker Next Season..
🔥
Emyu sensasional, spurs ancur"an
😍
Great performance from Lloris👏👏
Bring back the other commentator, much better & passion from him. This guys voice sounds way too forced!
Last season cristiano saved MU... But these season.... ??? 9 0 minutes im bench for player like him  was insulted... I hope  he can find a team that values ​​him; & Congrats for MU...
without ronaldo it's not worth watching manchester united, i don't watch the games if ronaldo plays.
Spaz wamepoteana wazee
Mu.memang bagus
Without Harry maguire spurs cannot win
The ball boy jubilation is just awesome 😍😍😍
it is fixed
With Maguire 1-6, without Maguire 2-0 😂
Spurs was supposed to be ambushed
Why ronaldo is not playing
If u look closely u can see the goals were deflections even the players were surprised they scored so its not all that 2 be excited about
It’s proven that Man Utd can’t play against average teams or weaker teams
Cristiano 😢
Only if that Antony curler would have gone, what a beauty.
🔥🔥
United in spurs in tel like hill lite
I THINK THE bald HEAD COACH IS INTELLIGENT IN SELECTING OR DEVELOPING A STRATEGY FOR PLAYERS THAT DO NOT KNOW STUPID LIKE A DOG
Bro, Anthony’s left is insane 😮🤯
Fear factor and the intimidating atmosphere is making a comeback at Old Trafford! Glory Glory Man United!!!
kane and son still missing after the match varane and martines summoned by the police hoping they would find them in their pockets
MU beat Liverpool beat Man City beat MU.
Marcus Rashford has been playing the best football of his career so far this season. Yes he still can't convert crucial chances, but he is hitting the target now more than ever. Better make the goalkeeper work than always shooting off target. Kudos to him
Big win UNITED🔴🔴🔴🎉🎉🎉
Klau ada ronaldo main nya hancur, klau gak ada ronaldo main bagus, kan ada iri sama cr
I lked match
Could've been Utd's best performance so far this season. Lloris was superb. Kudos to the reds
match like you
🤩🤩🤩
Nice team ❤❤❤😂
Respect for Ronaldo and career but Manchester United Football club does not belong to him. For me, Ronaldo's attituds doesn't respect thé club, the staff, thé coach ,thé others players, the fans. Erik ten Hag is a powerful manager like Pep guardiola, klopp , arteta, ancelloti ,Tuchel , Zidane,Antonio conte.. just give him time to build compétitive team able to win trophies for Manchester United Football club and fans
Rashford should have converted those chances.. How I missed Mason Greenwood 😔
But Ronaldo, this legend becomes a real one, we don't see him anymore
Rashford💩
Glad Fred finally scored, although it was a lucky rebounder. But he missed many shots lately and in my opinion tries way to fast to score from badly chosen angles. Honestly, I can't understand how TH doesn't change Ronaldo for Fred! And then makes the change for McTominay in the end🤦
💙
GLAZERS OUT!
mancheseter now better than with out ronaldo
Ronaldo did the right job when he left the field earlier. Ten Hag let him warm up, but did not put him on the field. What disrespect to a legend for all he's done.
Fascinating and I love it, glory will the way
fred ❤
Hope Ten Haag learned his lesson on starting Casemiro
Now who needs Ronaldo?..if united lose this match stupid fans would be blaming ETH for not playing Ronaldo😂😂
I dunno man, Anthony might be a Robben regen with that left foot.
WHAT A WIN, MU! GGMU!
Fred took that personally..
no ronaldo = win
“Unbelievable” 😂
Epic ❤
Rashford is so low lol, most overrated player ever
Go emyu go emyu go!! Hepieniperseri yang ke 3 thn selimut Emyu ku
Casemiro was 🔥
What a match 🔥

Arsenals fan here. Why didn't you guys put McGuire on 😤? I like him
United was amazing but don't forget to give Lorries his flowers
Rashford couldnt finish his dinner. Blue moon !!!
Where have you been, Stewart?😅

Listen to Skully - Fishing 🎣🔥
They've won! They've only gone and won a game of football! Hot diggity
It was an amazing game. No question. I'm just slightly disappointed in Rashford, But I'm sure he'll come back
With Casemiro in front of Martinez-Varane is totally another story. It could be finished 4-0
Where is cristiano😢😢
Selfish rashy
Only 2 goals? Cr7 did 3 by himself
Haha its just tottenham
We had a decent game Loris was epic as well. Fred is improving I won't lie, Bruno getting his fitness back. Nice performance 💓💓 Cr7 should be dropped for indiscipline.
Ronaldo
I see people being symphaty to Ronaldo and that people is blinded over they love to Ronaldo. What Eric Ten hag do is just a normal manager to do. And what Ronaldo doing is just unprofessional as a football player who's won 5 ballon d'or. Leaving your teammates who's struggle to win this is just unacceptable.
Can we play like this always
Kane and Son in the pocket of Varane and Martinez.
Ronaldo should be played so it's not fun if Ronaldo isn't played
Kalah ra trending
Look like Fred style of play have increased and he has been more improve than last year
where ronaldo sir 🧐
Brilliant performance !, watched it last night and lloris kept them in
🙌🙌🙌
Sud for giveway
Hugo was hero in this match
Ten hag sok Sokan, kenapa anda tidak memainkan CR7
Мне кажется, или Криша перестали выпускать на важные матчи?
Rashford still unable to convert 😂
играли два гавна. одно из оказалось удачливее. вот и все. манчестер юнайтед уже никогда не будет таким, как в 90 и нулевых.
We Really saw prime Bruno Fernandes Today ❤
What a performance from the team, this is the football we love to see!
Viva Ronaldo🥺🤍
I remember when msnchester united played like a championship team last year.
brnos"s  goal and freds silent finish
Ronaldo ?
💖
Chelsea will be a true test for the boys i believe, lets keep it up!
We.... believe
The main story of this match is Cristiano Ronaldo angry and walk away from substitution player bench when Match clock at 89 minutes
What a match! 👏
Cristiano ronaldo will leave Manchester United as soon as possible
Ronaldo needs to play!
With Casemero there's no fear....👊🏾💪
Stop benching Ronaldo!!!
Eriksen and Fernandes shouldn't play together in a 433 set up... And hopefully Fred will keep this level for a prolonged period...
Big Big shout out to my team and the management and also my digital manager,  mr king whom it is by his ability and professional knowledge I have been able to go through the digital investment process without risking a lot and have remained consistent to me,  I'm really grateful thank you.
This is how Manchester have to play&Ronaldo is getting old guys if we can tell the truth
Dalot has improved and impressed now i'm depressed for the premier league  BRING IT ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tottenham worst team and performance of the season 🎉
Now this is a threatening team, Lloris might just retire end of the season. Just bullets from outside the box, Rashford shots were touche.
Did anyone notice de gea last night?  i think he is working on his passing because last night he looked so comfortable with it and most of his passes were dead accurate. He was passing throwing going for long passes could have got himself an assist but it was shot rashford on the other end of his pass.
United players will be even more fired up comes Chelsea
Extended highlights pleaseeeeee
we feel happy for this win, thank you for this win..👍👍👍
Gradually improving. Welldone lads
Come on united......
someone take rashford to the greenwood finishing school. he doesn't when to use power or finesse.
We were in this game, came to watch the game from Uzbekistan. The atmoshpere of stadium was astonishing. Well done by Man. Utd. players. And Man. Utd. fans supported the team increadibily during the game. Pity, we couldn't see C. Ronaldo playing at least last minutes of the game.
GG MU❤
Eric tang is being too disrespectful to keep Ronaldo down, a big player of his status need more respect what the hell is Eric tang keeping him down
Let's all thank Rabiot's Mother for making all this happen.. True United Legend
Не смотря на гол считаю , что Fred не дотягивает до основного состава...
Fred💯
And Rashford should stop shooting straight to the goal keepers
me personally I didn't noticed that Kane and son played this match. they were so absent..I love that game
1 trending hahahahha
I’m still buzzing!
Best performance against top 4 so far this season
Untung ada loris, 😂😀😀 GGM 🔥
Respect cr7
W koncu United da sie oglądać. Oby szlo to ciagle w dobrym kierunku i cos sie nie zjebalo. Szkoda tylko Ronaldo ze jakos slabo mu idzie... Ale moze odpali w drugiej części sezonu :)
The manager has disrespected the one and only lengend c.ronaldo. he should be fired immediately.
Though I could not see the live action..what I could analize from the video clip high quality of football ⚽ played by Anthony..Fred..B.Fernandez     .Martinez    ..real class.. Kane and Son could not find their rithm to day..Spur goal 🥅 keeper... amazing..🙏🙏🙏
this is exactly how i want my team to play, then add a prolific young striker to the mix and its going to be party time, what a game, wasnt nervy at all throughout the whole game, EtH is defo working his magic, Casemiro my MOM he ran that midfield and had Kane and Son in his pocket, every player fought for that badge and our fans were amazing as per, GGMI
That antony cut inside. Wow I remember Robben.
What an amazing match!! From start to finish United played at 100…well done lads!
Loris the only reason the game didn't go out of rails. Rashford deserved a goal
United performance in this game reminded me the time of Sir Alex Ferguson when team used to give resolute, aggressive and spirited performance.
if they don't lloris , we defeat theme with 10 goals 👌
Casmiro's shot🔥 Great team fight   Well deserved 3points
What a shocker that playing casemiro would make the defence better!😂  Hes been one of, if not the absolute best defensive midfielders for several seasons now.
Vive manchester united 💯✌️🤲💪🔴⚪️⚫️
Ronaldo has to leave the team this winter. When he comes out, the team play cannot take place because the team members only see him.
Cristiano
Without CR7.....????
Keren
Ronaldo man of the match
i dont know why but i just hate the Manchester united in house commentators
ETH bhai.....agar tu Mard ka bachha hai to Khule me bol..... Ronaldo nahi chahiye..... Kya kaayar jaisa cheep k waar karta hai....chii Pahle bolta hai.. RONALDO IS ON PLAN..... fir baad me bench me bitha kar rakhta hai... Tujh jaisa Neech aadmi nahi... You wasting the last days of magnificent player's We never find another Ronaldo and Messi .
Please please give ronaldo chance he is at the end of the carrier let him play he is my ideal 🙏
com on united
Ronaldo where??
Telpon city king mu minta rematch
Man. United is back
간만에 멋지다
Ronaldo was benched again?
Fred improvement
Rashford needs to correct his scoring angles right, so many chances missed or saved. 😓
Manchester united need Striker better than Rashford he has finishing problem & lack of consistency🙌
We need to see Lord Harry in field to pump our heart beat.. We really missed him, & we need some laughs
🔥🔥🔥🔥
United united united !!!
Unbelivable perfomance ❤🔥
"Komentar ini dibaca oleh orang yang akan sukses di masa depan" Aamiin😇
Ronaldo?
แรชฟอร์ด  นายต้องคิดว่าผู้รักษาประตู คือ คนรักของนาย  คนที่นายอยากเข้าใกล้ที่สุด  ก่อนที่นายจะยิงประตูเข้ากรอบ  ถ้านายกลัวคนรักของนาย   นายไม่กล้าเข้าไปใกล้คนรักของนาย  นายก็คงยิงประตูไม่ได้แน่นอนที่สุด
VIVA RONALDO
match terbaik MU musim iniii, kelasssszzz🔥
Rashford is actually trash tbh
Manchester united is back 😎
Hayuk GGMU
Ronaldo out Gakpo In. Ronaldo is not professional. He looks like a whining child.
Could they be champions? Or Arsenal? Or Liverpool? Or Tottenham? Great season, is not it?
Spurs with one of the worst performances I’ve ever seen at OT. Simple hoofs by De Gea were even causing problems. Credit to United though.
Man United
Is Anthony flawless? No, by far. Is Anthony's dribble setting up 2 goals because he makes them step out of their position? Yes!
yeaaaahhhhh 3 point !!!
Eric ten Hag will become stronger as time goes by.
Rashford needs to use his brain before taking the shot. He just uses his power. 😡
My two favourite teams (I support Tottenham) but man u fully deserved that win. Also, not happy with how Ronaldo is being treated. They should let him leave in the next transfer window.
No malacia 💀
I am a random person who was curious of what youtube video was number 1 on trending, and I have no reason to talk here, but I decided to say how I got here anyway, despite my lack of knowledge on football.
Trending number 1 in Indonesia 🔥🙌
It was the best performance for a couple of years, with a bit of composure in front of goal we could have had five or six. To limit Spurs to a couple of half chances is a great performance.
luki
I am very sad not to see cristiano ronaldo in this match 😌
Strong and dominating performance! Carry on Reds!
Antony needs to start feeding Dalot more on those overlap runs. Because everyone always expects him to cut inside, that leaves space for Dalot
Mbappe without finishing = Rashford
This is called domination in every aspect⚽...even the admin has given the title unbelievable performance 😂..this shoot and just shoot tactics and VCM in defense has really worked
Start Ronaldo he is the G.O.A.T
I feel Greenwood would have got at least 7-8 goals by now.
ten hag out
토트넘 실점상황에서 원인제공자는 거의 대부분 다이어 ㅋㅋ
Manchester United is a weak team and overhyped team who can win against only weaker teams , they were  trembling in front on Manchester city.
this really surprised me even though it's usually not like that
👍🏻💚🙏
If not for Lloris we would have won 6-0 He had an amazing game
Every moment was my favorite... This should continue week in week out please.
As an arsenal fan, this is practically a wet dream
Saya kecewa dengan eric ten sekelas ronaldo di cadangkan😔
WHERE IS THE DERBY HIGHLIGHT????????
That's one United manchester  manchester United. ✊✊✊.
I contribute to my team's winning by not even being on the bench - Maguire
Bruno magnifico Fantastic strike
Lloris was on fire 🔥 last night 🌙
Fred's goal was fire. De gea was on point we were so dominant I like it
Thanks for this highlight cause I slept during the BRUNO GOAL
Let's keep the momentum going....
becoming a Manchester united fan since my childhood is the best decision i've ever made in my life ❤️👀🎵💯🙌
i like that😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
Ok
Ggggggg
BRUNO BRUNO BRUNO HE'S OUR PORTUGUESE MAGNIFICO GGMU #8 #18 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
This is so bad I'm a Tottenham fan
The match was great, but I am really disappointed how Rashford cant score a goal. If Antony was in those situations he would have scored.
antony is always taking that outside the box curler shot
Varane is rarely injured after Maguire being sidelined in almost all games, sometimes it’s not injuries, it’s just about the person who plays besides you, lovely performance lads❤️
Pastor Fred has found his Brazilian passport again
who needs ronaldo?
I only have to say, let the coach do his work... An year is almost enough to see what's the direction they're taking...
Nobody talks about the chances missed by Rashford...yet again...and yes..still he gets to play ahead of Cristiano 😡🤬😖🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Great game
Rashford's body position told everybody where he's placing the ball before he even kicked it. Why is he even mad that keepers saved all his 1 on 1s?

siuuuu
Another BIG Win Under ETH! GGMU!
fred.... hmm...

Manchester united disrespect to ronaldo, plz respect him he is a big big player in the world
Ronaldo should be benched til the end of the season.
If it wasn't Lloris Rashford would have almost gotten a hatrick. Great Performance by the team
Dier is garbage.
A glimps of prime united with out ronaldo
Ronaldo gw rasa bukannya gak dipercaya ato apa, emang ini tim mau dirombak dulu secara keseluruhan, jadi, siapapun yg nyerang tetep relevan buat menang/bertanding dengan baik. Baru nanti (semoga) saat tim lebih solid, sang 7 lebih diandalkan lagi.
Antony's Curer 😍
Compare to the game MU vs. Newcastle, this is real soccer game with 11 vs. 11, not like 11 vs. 12 (11 + referee).
KING Manchester is Back 🔥🏆💥
Lloris 🤩🤩🤩 had a amazing performance!!! All those saves were amazing!!
Mantap
1:25 🤣 I thought that only happens in FIFA
Ayam di sayurin
Best performance of the season  Congratulations guys
GGMU♥️
тут что обзор только моментов мю? где ттх опасные моменты?
the day Ronaldo make me really sad. How u can be so disrispecfful for the club  :(
Antony is class
Dier always delivering those deflections and own goals, Harry Kane disappearing in big games as always, that's the Spurs i know :D :D
It could've been 3 nil. That last rashford attempt if he would've hit it sweetly without going for power, it would've went in..
Fred🔥😏
Man utd ❤️
Lloris=octopus
Fred is not a bad player at all, just inconsistent. If he can have more games like these, he'd boss the midfield. Special mention to Hugo Lloris for keeping the scoreline respectable with some cracking saves
They cant believe they won against spurs😂😂🤣
No Ronaldo effect I guess
Best team ever 🔥
No question that was our best game under Erik   A performance to be admired and proud of.
If lloris wasnt there, that match would end up 5-0
Guys did you guys see how Fred turned into an elite Attacking Brazilian yesterday 😳
CRISTIANO RONALDO!!
Amazing game GGMU
Casemiro🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌what a player
we want Maguire more please... remember of his price...
GGMU
Rashford should now emphasize more about placement than power.
EtH ,only manager who had the balls to bench the egoistic maniac
What makes me most proud about this game is not the excellent football, but how gracious Antonio Conte was to Eric ten Hag. And dare say, vice versa. Bravo, gentlemen.
bald always sexy
Keep away ronaldo from this team!!!! Take your money and go back to madeira!!!!
2:13 Quandale Dingle
Luar biasa
just let ronaldo go after the fake promises ten hag gave to him the man is losing confidence slowly and we're talking about ronaldo here ! congrats on the W
Erik ten Hag 👍👍 (please return to Ajax Amsterdam 😢).
Awful highlights, should've been twice as long. How could you miss out Fred's screamer!?
Wasite curang v:
Madrid King Eropaa
let's goooo
Rashford needs to work on his finishing
Just imagine a striker in the mode of Halaand with those Rashford's missed chances. Great performance though
Where is CR7🤣🤣🤣
I have seen rashford try score in the last couple of games.... appreciate the effort bro💯 keep pushing 👊🏾
Glad united didn't appoint conte last season
3 poin  👍👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Ronaldo would have finished better than Rashford in front of the goalpost
Is Dier copying Maguire now?  🤣
Cant believe Rashford being a pro footballer misses so many easy finishes... its been years and his finishing has still not improved
❤❤❤
Would have been nice to see some defensive highlights as well.
Old Trafford is a hard ground for top 5 this year isn't it
Bismillah
GGMU👏
Steward is back😍
What a formation ❤️
Well played united 😍😍
I can't believe Ronaldo left. Does he even love united?
What a great performance 👍keep it on
Loris remain the man of match 💪
Hugo Lloris was amazing in this game,his team let him down honestly. Great performance by United.
Finishing needs to improve
Got our left footed del piero
Rashy was fire last night for a number 9... too bad he couldn't make a proper Finnish behind the net.  CR7 has to be disciplined. Being a world cup year he should not behave like that when rested. After all he wanted to leave last summer at all costs
An arsenal fan but yesterday united were on 🔥 there best game so far under Ten Haag
Wiseman say if the club change manager but forgot played Fred the scorer..this is the greatest football club in world.
They should be playing this way every match...
what a perfornamce casimero💯💪💪
Casemiro is bad boy 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽
❤❤❤❤❤❤
six piont game,mu done it!GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Louis van Gaals army!!
Wat a great performance I Love this
Rashford=Werner=Batshuayi
Only upload videos when they win...total silence when they get battered by other teams ... 🤡 Club
Tanhag BETRAYED Ronaldo💔💔💔
One of the best performances so far, but...but when will our strikers come through for us? It's always the midfield bailing us out.
Silly from Man UTD , you'll block Ronaldo leaving in the transfer window to bench him and pay him highest salary, only for him to leave in January.
Rashford was, is and will still be horrible at finishing.🥲🥲🥲 it's been the same story for years
GJ M.U.!
Mantap Mu... Love the red Devils🙏
Ronaldo has lost my support after this game. He can sit forever with Maguire on the bench
Cr7 was supposed to be substituted after the 1st half !!!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬
I have no idea what happened to Man United... Dominating the match against Spurs. Gives me 00's and early 10's vibes.
More than half of the shots did not get into the review, as well as the shameful and demonstrative departure of this peacock to the locker room before the end of the match
WHERE IS OUR GOAT, RONALDO????
Machester United: The Birth and Death of Legends RIP Ronaldo.
Best Performance.👏👏
this club is a joke
5 0 with ronaldo
Ronaldo is the goat but he was so wrong to leave early
just excellent😀😃😊
The Attitude was awesome.....
we all have to accept that fred was on a whole new level . He was pure 🔥🔥.One of the best perfomances from our boys. kudos
Lloris gave it his all..
Respect Ronaldo; every time you hear the news of MU is about ronaldo scoring or not, remember ronaldo is a legend
L no ronaldo
I love Casemero
🤩
wow stunning
why is no one talking about cr7? I think it is worrying to have the star man on the bench
I feel like ETH took Contes words personal. When he said last time Ronaldo beat us not Man United. And that's why I believe Ronaldo didn't get game.
casemiro shoud have scored that shot
We need a proper striker who is prolific, doesn’t beat around the bush.
Please have cr7
Was Ronaldo needed in the game?
ilope u manu from indonesia
Terrible finishing from Rashford, both shots straight at the keeper
There's a huge problem in Rushford's finishing, man this guy can easily be the top scorer but his finishing mehn 🤦🏿‍♂️.
Love baldy 💓
outstanding last night
Glad we dumped that annoying headache Paul Pogba
👍👍
Have Ronaldo's next game
kemenangan dengan penuh keberuntungan
Where is Pendu?
Top saves from Lloris👏 else we' d have more goals😦😒GGMU😍♥️
Tottenham has a strong keeper, but the team looks a bit iffy…
No Ronaldo No Problem. Simple as that.
I thought Kane and Son isn't playing...
Huge shoutout to Lloris! If it weren for him spurs would've conceded at least 4 or 5. Brilliant performance 👏👏
Where is Fred's Ballon d'Or?
If Loris wasn’t there. This match will be a massacre
Not hating... but the first goal was a fluke... the second as well.. and the ones who have scored tonight dont have that knack of scoring goals out of nothing... like cr7... defensively yes i agree blockbuster... but offense was just lucky
Как же МЮ круто играет, именно играет без Ц. Роналду!
tottenham isnt deserve lloris
rashford finishing skill was really awful in most of the games.
Could beat hotspur means mu played well
cr7 king 👑
Selalu trending, mantap
0:20 ! How the ball curled is eye-catching.🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
that is a great team work looks like. with ronaldo Man Utd looks like playing with 10 men.
I’m loving the Rashford I’m seeing. picking up bit by bit 🚀
Fantastic ...
Please Same Formation when meeting Chelsea " Was as lucky today "
get rid of ronaldo from our team.
Antony is really a new Robben
What a game!!
Fred is the luckiest guy in the match :) Glory Glory !
fred prime🥶🥶🥵🥵
Well done. So much qualities they've shown, so much potential. They're on the right track.
Man Portuguese blood is fuming The Red Devils 🔥🔥🔥
GGMU
who was man of the match
Magłaja top
0:31 look Rashford had enough time to stop the ball and hit it at top left
What an amazing comeback from Luke Shaw after Malacia took his spot, that's what the fridge of Manchester should do if he can!! I will love to see him do great on that red shirt, because 80million is no joke!! C'mon you reds UNTO THE NEXT. We'll once again bring down  London bridge on Saturday if we maintain this intensity 🛑⏩
Senasational game
Now just to have a clinical striker infront of us..
The other commentator is much better
LICHAAAAAAAAA
For the first time in a long time,we got our summer signings Right, Impressed.
GGMU
หวานเจี๊ยบ
Why is it hat we always play exceptionally well when Ronaldo aint on?
Can someone tell Rashford to pass or finish well? Horrible!
Yah for this match everyone participated its a great team work hope we beat chelsea on weekend also 👍👍👍👍
Kudos to all boyss❤️🔥Made our day💆🏻‍♂️💪🏻
Tottenham get batterd evrywhere they go, Tottenham get battered evrywhere they go, evrywhere they go!
Harus konsisten
Tottenham suffocated from the first minute. Kane can be found in Martinez pocket!!
Alhamdulillah🤗
Fred 💥
Fred remember he is indeed brazilian
I wish rashford just finesses the shot instead of power shooting it
If Spurs goalkeeper wasn't llioris, Marcus could have scored hattrick
Totally outclassed spurs for the entire 90
Casemiro is a better signing than Martinez
We're better without Ronaldo.
de hea's save v kane should hv been included....cuz that led to 2nd goal
Rashfords finishing needs work. You just keep blasting them all the time
Thuii boring mtch
That is what united can do 😉❤️
Rashfurd needs to learn to curl his balls away from the keeper and not put it too close to the keeper.
Manchester United need consistency
Its only tottenham
I don't know if Lloris had a conversation between Uzoho before this match😀
Glory Glory Man United ❤️
Man United don't respect their legends 🤬
Kick Ronaldo out , he doesn’t deserve to play in this club
Could have been worse if not for lloris
Best match of the season so far.. keep it up boys.. ❤️
Manchester united 💕💕💕💕💓💓💓💓❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💗💗💗💗💗💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💞💞💞💞💞💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟👏👏👏
This was a lovely performance but don't get too excited because Tottenham did a lot to make this look smooth. Their defense looked like they played with 4 Maguires at the back. Another thing that cannot be unnoticed is that Rashford just can't score no matter what. I seriously don't know what's needed for him to be able to score.
I'm a Ronaldo fans, not a MU fans
Amazing
Bek mu tontenham loyo
Antony <3
Where is the best defender in United? I don't see him in bench
Tottenham coming to this game trying to be Man Utd's A.I defenders
The worst moment of the game is when Ronaldo leave the ground 🥺
CASIMIRO♥️
It's incredible how Lord Fred uses the opponents to get the goal and an assist. Pure magic
I dont like bruno
Can Anthony just pass or shoot properly why he must keep curving the ball and try to score
This game was magnificent. Hooray Martinez ❤❤
19 shots in the first half and 2 minutes worth of highlights?
That's what I watched to see Red Devils look like and play in that spirit of red horns. Needs to build on this consistency with goal scoring Midas touch coming more in rest matches 🤘
Fred MOTM
Ten Haag out
lloris was class man
From an Arsenal fan,,I haven't seen this united in many years
What a match for us. Casemiro, Varane, Martinez destroyed Kane and Son. Fred, Bruno, Antony..... everybody played absolute class.
Please upload in 50fps
This is the performance we as united fans waiting for.
Wonder what conte's gotta say now since  the excuse was "Ronaldo"
Manshitted United💩🤮(hate Tottenshit too)
0 attempts for spurs ...
For me Dalot was the man of the match, he defended really great and was able to support almost all the attack as well with some great move like his cross to Shaw etc.
Rashford should've got two goals. The placement was not right for both the shots and another point is that it'd have been 2 easy goal if he used curl instead of so much power.
Whare is Benchnaaldo???
Could've been 5-0 or 6-0 if it weren't for lloris
If you want to win a battle, make you squad around ronaldo... If you want to win a war...buy a new forward...and new goalkeeper.
Selamat atas kemenangannya, MU. Bisa jadi modal moral bagus melawan Chelsea diakhir pekan nanti.
ronaldo walking off was silly
The only hope left for spurs was to bring on Maguire , sadly they didn’t do that
If only Ronaldo had those chances Trashford had, this would’ve been a 5-0.
Now we need to carry this momentum and not get carried away. We need atleast a point from the Chelsea game.
Ten hag zero rescpt for cr7 utd legnd
Nice play lads
Where was CR7?
Watching Man United performance like they did last night is the best feeling fans been waiting to see,  keep up  the spirit against Chelsea and other games that follows.  The Red Army. United for all.
United begins to play like Ajax
Thank You❤❤
Man united played really well.
Did not see a game like that from M.U since a very long time.  What a game !
2 Goals and a clean sheet..This win couldn't have tasted sweeter! Lloris prevented this surely being an absolute thrashing else..5-0 was banging on their doors rashford struck some really sweetly but lloris became his nemesis  Casamerio is a phenomenon..He is the boss of this United Midfield! A match winning performance
Sad to see Ronaldo leaving...better he should leave the club...ETH won't let him in playing eleven...Don't won't to see a legend in this way...
Love this spirit 🥰🥰
Antony is wow!!!
Step by step.  Ggmu
Mantap
Oooo bruno
Best performance🔥
And I expect Fred do the same thing like this. He's unbelievable. Not like Paul Pogba.
Chelsea Next....
We absolutely dominated them
No Naldo No problemoo chakkss
It’s “Fred” no mention of the huge deflection
Amazing ❤performance and best this season, I felt.
😈😈😈 UNITEEEDDDD!!! 😈😈😈
It doesn't deserve anything. No one was aware of the joy of your success. Everyone looked at CRISTIANO outing. Unfortunately i support don to go
Bruno unintelligently puts unnecessary pressure on himself that he forgets to relax and just make things simple. He goes too forward
I'm fed up with the maguire bashing but I don't understand how he was still in the starting eleven for so long.  Fred is also better now that he has a real 6 next to him...
I wish we can continue like this
Another Brazilian night
must buy a new striker
Social Media FC
Hotspur is loser
Let cr7 play man
Rashy on his top form man🥰🥰
magnificent iloris
🔴👹
Mantap mas Fred 👍
MU striker still underperfomance
Great performance lads
Ronaldo ?
United is the best!!!!!!!
🤙✨🤩
Congrats Guys! I am a Man City fan but I celebrate your victory.
Can you guys play like this all the time?
Glory Glory Man United ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔱☝🏻
Let's gooooooo!!!!
What a player "Casemiro"
I urge Erik to make this lineup in every match... absolutely tremendous performance from every ManU players tonight
If not bcause of lloris,united should score 5 or 6 goal
As an Ajax fan, this performance showed glimpses of ETH's magic. The pressure, workrate, great combinations in the midfield, Antony being involved in nearly every attack and the sheer amount of dominating posession. This can only get better for ManU.... And yes we miss ETH and Antony
Where is Penaldo?
where is the performance?
💥💥💥💪
Rashford could have had a brace from this game had he done some placing of his shots. His shooting was too central and he made Hugo the star man.
Casemiro!!!
Imagine how lethal Rashford would be if he improved his finishing. He should really learn to start placing his shots rather than always going for power
Approaching a return of the Utd vs Arsenal days as leaders of the prem league, now wouldn't that b suttin...
Antony's left foot curl is so dangerous
What a match🔥
Rasford unlucky
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
best match of the season
Casemiro,eriksen make things different
Rashford is poor finisher. He has wasted many chances. He's to improve how to shot. However, the whole team performance is fantastic. GGMU!
Excellent work by the Boys. Keep it up
Someone should tell Rashy that power is not the answer all the time.
I just love how Diogo has turned into the beast that was 🔥
Absolute brill 👌👌
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Its a long time since i feel happy watching man united playing,well done boys
GGMU 🔥
One think Red devil big cause of Ronaldo but he is not be apreciated in hos team l will leave Red devil as my like
Definitely the best we've played this season and I would say one of the best in recent memory.Was slightly concerned that it was gonna be one of those nights until we got that slice of luck with the deflected Fred shot.
What's inside casemiro pocket? Car key, phone, kane and son.
フレッジ、アントニー最高だった😭
Great perf without dodo.. Again 😏
Rip conte😂
Ronaldo ne mérite pas ça
Come on you united up Antony 🇧🇷
bruno performance is very outstanding. 💪💪💪💪💪
Rashford going for for a power strike when he should just execute an intelligent strike and score. IQ>talent.
Rashford is becoming impressive but he shots so close to the keeper every time.
Imagine Gakpo played instead of Sancho, definitely 5-0
Rashford neither attempts top bin nor avoids GK 🤷‍♂️
Can't believe I missed this match.😪
Love MU!!!!!!!
Man united performed better without C Ronaldo so C ronaldo get out
Erick is doing Big mistake by keeping Ronaldo on the bunch the who won 5 Ballon"dor and Champions league Trophy I say it is a disrespect to him,Erick Better leave Man United I completely hate you now.
United
Casemiro 🥰
Dominant ❤️
rashy finishing like a primary school kid😭
Rashfords needs composure & shooting practice,has so many chances but fails to score.
RONALDO  👑  BRUNO 💩
No question that was our best game under Erik 🥰  A performance to be admired and proud of.  ❤🖤🤍
Need to get rid of rashford, always hits the ball straight at the keeper, not the corner of the goal, takes 7 chances to score 1 goal. Need a clinical finisher, should have gotten icardi for free in the summer he is clinical in front of goal.
He a.u
I think Rashford needs to start placing those shots high, placing them low isn’t helping. What a performance from all the players
They all played well. Defending together. Even the fans were cheering for pressing high. Its all we need EFFORT. thats all. Well done boys Glory Glory Man United!
Where's Ronaldo !!!?
Best performance i ever  enjoyed as United fan...consistency..
Best performance so far. So dominating.
Sancho I love you ❤️
Great performance, but we need to be more clinical with our shots. Come on United !!!
Couldn't see any spurs attack
McFred shining 🤯🤯
Chelsea paying their tax next🩸
Ronaldo deserve to playing 11
Fantastic Performance from the Red Devils ❤️🔥
Manchester united not respect ronaldo
We want Ronaldo on the pitch !!
Geweldig, zet hem op Erik.
Where is Ronaldo ?
Bravo!😍😍😍
Golll
This is just the beginning, our Manchester United team is back to timeline. Great performance from the players and coaching staffs ….💪💪💪💪
So glad they didn't show Ronaldo's tantrum walking off early trying to make it all about himself.  What a performance from the lads. Dominated from start to finish 💪👏
come on rashy, you did well, its okey
ronaldo
Rushford is not an ideal striker. The coach should consider Ronaldo to be the main man
CR 7😥😭😭
United is getting better everyday like looserpool
Lloris😮‍💨
Without ronaldo and maguire man united is performing well
Fluke Goals😂😂 🇦🇷
No Ronaldo, best performance of the season so far.
Такой классный матч. А всего 2 минуты обзор. Пожалуйста делайте видео более обзорным! Всех с победой
Hugo lioris still got skills
It’s tough to actually play both Eriksen and Bruno. Today was proof of that. United dominated midfield and bossed Tottenham around. Casemiro masterclass.
Casemiro like a carrick
Putting rashford in place of ronaldo and seeing this performance cant even score from this range what a shame  If im not wrong ronaldo was a goal machin at his age and watching the GOAT at the bench is heart breaking how many chances he provided yet zero finsihing skills from the forwards and yet at this age he is fighting for the passiom of football RESPECT Cr7
Luke Shaw better than Malacia so stop benching him
Another game were Rashford doesnt score. We need a striker like Haaland that know were the goal is.
I think Now I can trust the process...A light ray is reflected in this club we can see how better it's coming...But we still need consistency!
January 2023 out king 👑 cr7
Манчестер отлично сыграли!Чаще бы так!
Marcus has to improve his finishing, could've had 2
Siuuuuuuu
I actually think they should start every game like this Sancho Fernandes Fred were absolute class
Kwkwkshdhshsa
Ronaldo should had ignored Man Utd fans last season and went to Man City. He could have had his 6th Champions League title already. Biggest mistake he ever made in his career was return to Man Utd.
Rashford was useless..... Should have played 45 mins only ... Keep it up Anthony,casemiro they play outstanding....
This was THE BEST performance since Ole’s first game in charge lol. What a match! Up the Reds!
Now this is Manchester United....
Terima kasih Manchester United.
Thanks to loris to only concede 2 goals
GGMU 😛
Rashford has a chronic problem of not being able to find the corners of goal. Always at or around the keeper. Up the lads though great game
❤❤
Oof ima Tottenham fan yikes😂
👍💪
Siuuuu
Just realised this team has so many Portuguese speakers
Go go go MNU
Rashford is seriously wasteful with his chances. Should really have had 2 himself yesterday
No Ronaldo no watch 😢
Man u. 👍👍👍
Bruno's free-kick & Lloris save missing  Just after Fred's goal Rashford shot save by Lloris missing
The is the best performance of the season 🙌 👏 👌 ❤, won a match and dominating at the same time.  We loose the ball for 5 seconds and recover instantly. Kudos to all the players
Great performance but Lloris tho, turned into prime Buffon all of the sudden
I pextes den 8eloun ton ronaldo oute o proponotis giati den ton afises na figi kirie propniti sto telos tis karieras se ena pexti fenomeno den simperiferonte etsi kai i pextes aman einai o ronaldo mesa den pezi kanenas
This gameplay performance reminds me of our peak Manchester United..Hopefully we can consistently play like this until the end of the season
Ronaldo?
f**k you MU CR7 king!
I like
Conte: You buy 2-0 already? ETH: Yes of course! Conte: Great! Let's print some cash together! ETH: Sure buddy :D
Lloris kept them in the game for as long as he could. Dominant from start to finish. Solid defensively, Ten Hag bringing out the best out of Diogo!
Fav moment of the game was shaw volley and the best moment of the game was Bruno Fernandez goal was brilliant..but game was like war..after long long time gotta see MNU plyed such a fighting game and brilliant.but not only this time we would like to see MNU play all games like this rock
WHERE IS RANALDO?
U broke king CR7 ❤️💔 dnt worry Ronaldo leave in United u will come back again
rashaf.. egoiste
if cr7 was played they could score 2 more goals
Anybody talking about how babyshot is rashford shots
Lord fred
Rashford is an absolutely poor finisher. ETH should play Cr7 instead of rashford. He's more deadly on that left side
Sancho is the only concern. When Martial will back, he will be my striker and Rashford will be left winger. Sancho will be on bench.
Penaldo is finished 😢
Don't get sense why Rashford played instead of CR7.
oh rasford
This is by far our best ever performance I have seen in years. And that too against a rock solid side of Spurs. Excellent overall performance. ETH deserves credit, but get Ronaldo back on the pitch - or we will miss him forever.
under the light
GGMU
Rashford makes great runs but he needs to learn to place his shots at better angles. Power shots aren't everything in football.
Fred is always so underrated. Unfair treatment to Fred! 😢
What will be our defensive midfield combination?  Mctominay-Eriksen Casemiro-Eriksen Casemiro-Fred Mctominay-Fred🤣 Eriksen-Fred Casemiro-Mctominay
If that GK wasn't lloris, it would be 4 for united...
How is it an amazing save when Rashford kicked it straight to the keeper
they still should have let CR7 leave instead of doing this... waste of the club budget and CR7's precious time... but then again, no player is bigger than the club
Dalot is becoming something else😋
Красавчики!!!!
Casemiro is going to get one of those goals recently
A WELL DESERVED WIN FOR US AS WE DOMINATED, BATTERED AND OUTCLASSED SPURS😆😆🔥UP THE RED DEVILS❤️❤️
United, the team that don't post there defeat.
where is cristiano? 🤔
Suiiiiiii
We need more consistency, at least the boys showed the Man City game was a blip.. I don't wish to say our striker was wasteful but Loris was unbelievable.
Rashford keeps hitting the ball straight at the goalie
How can you disrespect CR like that....what a joke , putting players like Elanga and giving 0 minutes to Ronaldo, joke.
People said Antony was going to be a flop. Really?
There is not reason to watch premier league, arabs dictators had bribes everyone and everything and this is not more competition but a farce. Just look the last match with the 'newcastle arab united'
Best team match
Well done boys😍
2 teams met with problems in defense, whoever has more problems lost
so these guys when they want they can actually put a proper shift in.....GGMU
Finishing is not just power, its power and placement. Rashford needs to up his game if he wants to be a no 9.
Tendangan keras bisa di tepis Lloriss, tp tendangan pelan bisa gol 👍👊👊
Ông fred rùa thế nhỉ rùa bàn thắng đến kiến tạo kk
Trending 1 in Indonesia
Fred is truly an enigma, one game he plays like Ronaldinho and the next like Anderson.  Bruno is a great captain unlike that slab head.  Sancho has been awfully quiet the last few games. Dude has been out of pace and his energy is very depressing.
Walau menang 1-0 CR7 yg ngegolin itu lbih berarti
Thats what you get if you put CR and Maguire on the right place. On the bench 🎉
28 shots?!! is it United or City... ? why cant we play like this always
What a game ❤😊
After a longtime a complete performance of United side.
We need this pressure when we travel to Chelsea on Saturday
🇦 🇲 🇦 🇿 🇮 🇳 🇬
MU hoki anjrit...
Proud of Fred starting to shine this season
ggmu 🔥👊
Enough with Rashford.. give him 100 chances he might luckily score 1.. we need to find a replacement.. he shouldn't be starting day in day out
Rashi need to be more clinical
Please up load AAA MANCHESTER UNITED VS TOTTENHAM.😊
Fred's luck is amazing 😂
Fred's yearly Ballon d'Or performance came at such a crucial timing
I have never seen spurs played like some midtable club against us or maybe that's where they belongs 🤫🤫
My best performance in the last 8 years
As city fan i was for the devils tonight
REVENGE ! 🔥😈
Funny how this channel didn't post any losses this season
Casemiro🔥🔥🔥
Manu really play well in this game if son was even playing I didn't notice him. GG Manu
"they beat us because of Cristiano, not Man United" Said Conte 😂
It was beautiful it was soooooo beautiful 🥺🥺
We miss ronaldo
Win = making video Lose= not video
Mungkin karna seragam Hotspurs berwarna biru😁
Rashford must sell manu…..
I wanna see every match like this ❤️
United best performance and loris best performance of the season till date
We're all happy to see the boys playing so well but let's not get too excited because it's a new season and I'm really excited about his tactics❤️
Sell pendu
Rashford needs to be separated from the team and be made to do shooting drills only for the next 2 months 😂
Ayo quandale dingle was about to score tho
Stupid YouTube handle of the most overrated football team in the world. See you guys in Europa league. Not that I think you can reach the semi
MU has 3 best Brazilian players belong to Brazilian squad in the World Cup Brazil 🇧🇷 all the way
United is power ❤️👑💪
ETH already understood everything about who he should bench 🥰
Best showing since the Gaffer retired.
Gini dung main  . Enaak nikmatiin permaainan nya kalauu nyeeerang teerus
Mending cr 7 hengkang dari MU
When Penaldo its not there, United play very Well!
I wish rashford tried to finish well instead of just hitting the ball as hard and straight as physically possible
Rashfords finishing hasn't improved much the last three years or so... That's what separates him from the top strikers
MOTM : FRED
Rashford is trash.....i mean how the fck can't you finish those chances.
This could have been uploaded 2 hours earlier
Lads, it's Tottenham..
Rashford is like Ronaldo's first spell. He is not a striker but pure winger. He needs Ronaldo for the experience to transform.
Rashford need to understand that you don't go for power always when taking a shoot. Martial knows this... But overall was a great performance from the team... We need this same passion on Saturday
Pure Class🤷‍
Thank you and well done... But I know you, never be happy today and loose your next match please let us continue to enter the top 4...thank you
Now that United team is more like an attacking machine now.
Penaldo is finished Man U fans hate him now 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Why Ronaldo is not in this game???
Next 3 point at Stamford Bridge!! Let's Goooo
Man U fans hate Ronaldo after this game lmao🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 lmao he's no longer a Man U legend or considered the greatest ever he should retire and watch the real goat win his 8th Ballon D'or
Hugo Lloris is the MVP of this match
Rashfords fails unbelievable... Just how...
Loris 👏👏
No Cristiano no party
Brilliant performance....Need more of the same, away to Chelsea on the Weekend. Adding them to wins against Spurs,Liverpool and Arsenal would be making true progress, and a real statement.....
Best in the season. Rashford have to aim other spaces to hit the goal not goalkeeper hand.

freds goal was clearly an own goal
Way to go that’s the way to play😊
Где Криштиану?
Ronaldo need to start against Chelsea
Excellent performance from the boys
After so many months, I liked this united performance. Attack attack attack
where is Ronaldo, We want him to play
great permormance!
Fred team of the week
This is by far the most complete performance by us under ten hag' everyone was just near parfect today ' even the "pastor' himself "fred"😄
I really don't understand spurs tho. How can a big team always park the bus all the time. No form of attack
Poor Cristiano
C. Ronaldo 😍
Rashford is not a striker
Next up chelsea ✌🏻❤
Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris did everything 🔥...Lisandro Martinez was excellent for Man United ✌️
2 lucky goals
AKHIRNYA GK KE GUA LAGI.. :)
Rashford was so unlucky 🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥what a team performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hopefully OLD Trafford is the fortress again
Could be 5 - 0 if not because lloris
what a match for us, having casemiro in front of licha and varane is really making our defense even more solid.
Llorris❤❤❤❤❤
Respect for fred what a performance 🔥 🔥 🔥
When Ronaldo starts the game Manu will either lose or draw the game, well we now know what Manu should do from now on, sorry guys i support the team not just one man
Shouldn't been at least 6-0
casemiro perfomance💯
GGMU!
Rashford could've had a hattrick if Lloris wasn't on crack, we absolutely smashed spurs, only lloris kept them in the game
Antony 🥰🥰🥰
GREAT GREAT PERFORMANCE!❤
and cristiano?
Rashford always use his strength than his brain to score..he should vice versa his mindset..
If there couldn't be loris for spurs  It could be something like 4:0
If only we can keep up with this mentality. Problem is we underrate small sides and we don't give in our best performance.
Man U won't win anything
Ronaldo gk dimainin lagi??
Beautiful performance
Demolition
Congratulations 🎊 👏
hugo🙄
Selfish football club…You only post your matches when you win,Buh don’t when you lose…SMH🤮🤮🤮
Man united need striker and they must give chance to Ronaldo
Fred was a beast!
Rashford needs to be very calm in front of goal, he is in a hurry
Lagi lagi cr7 di cadangin
Rashford had a nice game but he has to calm down and place his balls to right corners of the net. Not him shooting hard all the time into the hands of the goal keeper 📍
Tranding no.1 in Indonesia
Thanks Fred, onfire 🔥🔥
Mumeshinda leo hiii ni maajabu
Lumayanlah
Teach Rashford to finish please
CR7 wants to make the best record in his football career, he believed he would do that with man u, I think if you (man u) can't give him that chance, let him go and I ask the club that will take him to give him the chance he needs, he is a 🐐
Ronaldo sale
Ya haha ngenTottenham
Lo que veo es que caerán como un foco se apagarán ya lo verán no está el comandante no hay nadie en realidad 😂😂
Erik, leer Rashford ff afmaken AUB
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What a incredible performance tonight, some stunning football on display
Ronaldo bench d’or
Brazilians arrived to make a difference 😎🇧🇷
"Thank you for not believing in me 😔" - CR7
FRED !❤️‍🔥 he was a pittbull !!❤ great great performance from all the lads but heat of for FRED ! 👌🎩
I have idolized ronaldo for 10 years but i now accept he has no place in this squad
cr7 war is cr7 please 🙏 😢 😭 😫 😔 😩 🙏  cr7  siuuuuuuuuuuuu
Ggmu 🥳🥳🥳
ya gak heran sih
Feeling bad for Rashford... He was absolutely amazing this night... He deserved more than 2 goals if there was no Lorris !!
4.9 for loris
Winning against a easy team not a big victory...show it in every match
If we ever have a beautiful game like we did atleast the highlights should be extended🤨🤨
pls do this again next match❤
Lord Fred 👏
Free Ronaldo in january please😭😭😭🤦🏾‍♂️
I miss the day we call MU , the red devil.
That final save against Marcus was something else as he absolutely smashed that.
No ronaldo no party
Emang harus seperti ini
Casemiro is the factor ❣️
😍😍😍
Dier MOTM by far
Toe in ham
Where is ronaldo?????
Kevin de fred 🔥🔥
Sancho turuu
Still lacking but average
United 🎯
Rashford score amazing
🥰🥰🥰🥰👍
Terbaik!!!
Dejen de insultar a Cr7 malditos
Rashfors should bury those chances. Most of them went straight to Lloris
WHat a great game..... could be even 10-0 for us
I still don’t understand why Ronaldo isn’t in the lineup.
Mequier is the két he is sitting in the bench !!!!
Man united is killing teams🌟🌟🤙🤙
Rashford just hits d ball... No placements, no precision, no technique...
Fred handled d whole spurs midfield while varane took care of cane.. I didn't know son was in d game, only saw him on d lineup
As an Arsenal fan.i am happy for the win.great game
Amazing day guys
Yall play well without Ronaldo
every bodi guud Playing 😙💪👍
Amazing performance we played beautiful attacking football and dominated them
👍🏾
Ronaldo not playing?
For the first time in many years every single new signing is doing well
700 club goals, five time Ballon d'Or recipient, played for the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus... can you believe this same man is a bench warmer at Manchester United of all teams?
Dier sucks
Aim then shoot goals will come.
Bruno still terrible
I really hate this channel for showing the end result in the thumbnail
Ronaldo☹️
DOMINANT PERFORMANCE ❤
Fred>>>>of whole spurs midfield
Manchester United were absolutely superb from start to finish. Great game of football
I will not forget the disrespect towards cr7 , he could have easily come  at 70th min
Fred never gets credit. Man of the match.
GGMU 👍👍👍👍
The best United win under 10 Haag unbelievable I'm very enjoyed 😴😴✅
Rashford deserve a goal, but just unlucky Lloris was amazing
As a Arsenal fan spurs was wash today 😂🤣😂 gg man u
Yesssss👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤❤  For 🇺🇦🇺🇦💪🏻💪🏻🔱🔱
Some says Kane is still inside Martinez's pocket
Christmas is near.Dear santa please give us a stiker.🤗🤗🤗
NEXT TARGET CHELSEA 👻👹
Pitiful rashford
Why United not taking Ronaldo in starting 11??
I love you my team
Glory, Glory, Manchester United.
Tottenham just doing Tottenham things
Antony moving like Robben with that left foot😭
Conte's 2nd coming to epl turning into losses against every big name team. He's keeping them afloat with points vs smaller clubs. Won't last for long, Conte will leave by summer
Unbelievable performance by Ronaldo
classic spurs,always dominate first season and going down in middle season
The lads played their hearts out yesterday. Well done. Greatest performance of all season. Except more of this adrenaline
💥💥
Fredinho
♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
Worth watching
Maan Rushford is just unlucky
Rashford's finish is absolutely terrible.
Glory glory MANCHESTER UNITED
What a performance by Fred…
Where is cr7 ?
OT is a castle. Let's do it with mcity guys! COYG!
fred goat
Gol untung"ngan...
bang edo ga main ya
What an outstanding performance from Captain Harry Maguire. He's a classy player on the bench. More wins, bro.
Everyone aside Rashford had solid performances, his finishing is awfully poor.  We should get a new no 9 in January.
We need a striker so bad man
antony style alwys like that, he is must listen advice from paul school
What a performance
I love Manchester United with one heart.... Seeing players destroying the opponent's seriously.....The Red we move🙏🙏🙏🇺🇬
Lek menang uploade banter matt
Rashford is bad striker,..he need at least 10 clear chance to make a single score
Eric ten Hag is a world class coach, let the board support him with new signings he needs to add to his squard
what is stopping Man United to play like this every week??
Where is goat...if Ronaldo play in this game he is sure score..1or 2 Goals..
Rashford needs to learn to how place his shots away from the keeper
Greetings from Russia. GGMU❤
lloris still man of the match😂
My team my special club in the world. MAN UTD🙏. From Land of origin ETHIOPIA💚💛❤
Casemiro is the world class
We played well last night. Chelsea next
I would've been a draw. Lucky to score deflected two goals but deserved in the end how Kane and son in the pocket 😂
I'll always rewatch this match to remind myself how great my beloved team can be. 😭 Kudos to our boys, collectively.
The crowd was something else last night. Against Newcastle it was a funeral. If the team ought to make Old Trafford a fortress again, the crowd should always get behind the players even if united r losing or drawing. Not only when the team is winning. Nevertheless best performance so far this season. Ggmu
Putting him in bench can make Manchester United win the game
High press game then attack, attack, attack... for me fred is the man of the match, he covered all the midfield like prime makelele.
RESPECT RONALDO
Rashford misses such opportunities means he is not clinical enough. Utd needs clinical finishers like spur's Sonny, Sane and others. Right now Rashford is more like Timo.
UP trending
The best performance. Very high pressing from united.
Bench Ronaldo to win big games please
Mad respect for lloris.. crazy performance by him
Unfortunate Rashy :( Hopefully he gets the goals in the next match.
맨유는 진짜 브라질 향우회 네 ㅋㅋㅋ
It's a dominant 90-minute performance I have not seen them play in years. Hopefully, we can see this more regularly. It's a shame Ronaldo's antics destroy the atmosphere and harmony of the squad. The game against Newcastle Eriksen was clearly a big miss for them. He is more suited against teams that park the bus or defend deep. I think the game against Chelsea is going to be an open game. Fred can do the high press and win the ball in the opposition half. Yes, his passing is still a question mark. The team needs energy whenever they play any big teams, and he provides that over Eriksen.
Какого хер роналдо не сыграл
Where is the Cristiano 🤬🤬
Goodjob my team,and my idol Sancho
🔥💪 United ❤️
where'd "the king" run off to?
Mizoram trangin aw niang sakawrdai trang nilo in
Ngamok rashy nya
Rashford should have gotten a brace at least😞
Awesome performance by United 🔥
Joss
Pushed the tempo 💯
How is rashford goalless after such a performance 😊 dude absolutely deserved a goal and btw Casemiro Martinez Varane diamond is absolute beautiful use Sancho as AMF with Bruno in support along with Antony Rashi and Ronaldo at strike and you got yourself a title winning squad
Hidup Fred
I already don't understand what the teen hag means, reserve Ronaldo when a game against a big club, like spurs, always backs up A Ronaldo in every game against a big club, it looks very clear!! Rasford was useless in yesterday's match, Sancho didn't dare to dribble into the spurs defense, if you want to treat Ronaldo like this, let him go to manchester city!! look what he will do against Manchester United!! he will score goals, and teach teenhag how to play!! with him!!
Don't see how eriksen gets back into that side.but what a sub to have
I love MANCHESTER UNITED FROM INDONESIA ❤️
Where is the 🐐 Ronaldo 😂? Ohhh he is in the bench
this win can't pay for the disappointment of a draw against newcastle, never consistent like kids playing around !!
Why do this ten hug with Ronaldo
Glazers out
How many chances rashford wasted.if Ronaldo waste a chance evryone will be shouting..
Why “arguably?” Who could argue?
TBH Tot were very poor in this game
Man United is so enjoyable to watch nowadays
fred score same messi UCL 18/19  wow amazing
Antony🥳🥳🥳🥳
Ts just fantastic football and that's the man United, the kind of confidence we as fans LOVE to see.
Man United For Life ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
As a spurs fan fair play to United , you guys were at another level today , played us of the park . But we hopefully we’ll come back stronger COYS
Excellent performance💯. Lets hope we maintain this form. I'm sure Conte still lost to Ronaldo and not United...
as a Chelsea fan this has scared me with our fixture on Saturday... bt let us wait and see ...
Its Spurs dont get ahead of your selves. You'll lose by 4 plus to some bottom table team soon anyway.
Fred really played , congrats to the whole team
Ten hag needs 200M in January and we're winning the premier league ☹️
Rashford. Going for the power finish instead of a simple pass into the net should be talked off . Anyway nice performance ❤
What a performance!  Ronaldo the 🐐 u will be always loved I hope Eric will understand😉 how big ur desire to play is.  People see the things is the bad way but I can understand how big is ur motivation, and desire to play the games.  Eric should held a private conversation with u, we don't want u to retire in this way. Viva cr7 we love u man
GGMU
Casemiro he is a perfect CDM for Man utd.. He just need time to adapt with Man utd player and also PL..
Cr7 😢😤
Great game! Such a difference from the Newcastle game. Spurs lucky to not lose 5-0.
Ronaldo and rashford unlucky this season
no cr7??? again?
This is my team
If we played like these we would not have been defeated by city
Гнать француза с ворот, а то так ничего и не выиграют
We need a goal machine  When it comes to goal scoring Rashford is not reliable So is Martial, very injury prone
Let Kane Out Of martinez's pocket now 😂🫣
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Like we always said rashy needs to improve his finishing,he always go for power shot and he should know that by now,if he learn to place it in the corner he would have 50-100 more goals in his career
Glory glory Man United
Somebody needs to teach rashford a thing or 2 about finishing. All he knows is to shoot the ball as hard as he can.When world class strikers use their brain he uses his power. A finesse shot would have got him a goal today.
Fredinho
Great performance from Ronaldo too 😆😆
rashford shots look like it would hurt any keeper wrists!
GGMU💪💪💪💪 Chelsea don't run,we're coming for you
Antony❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow wow what a game lads 👏🏽
unlucky from rashford
Sing konsisten main kaya gie boy
What happen with Ronaldo? Why his leave stadio?
We win when we want you don't need to pressure us united forever
Glory glory glory man united 🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍
Congratulations 👍👍
CR7 OUT
Everyone showed the real MU class.. GGMU
Ronaldo?
coach🤮
Manchester united vs Tottenham, mantap is the best MU 2 0 mantao
should have shown the de gea save vs kane. that save lead us directly to our second goal!
The real star is that defender. He assisted bith goals
olá sou do Brasil gostaria de ganhar um Xbox series s algum por gentileza pode me da não tenho condições de comprar um
Unlucky united, only 2.0, i think 5.0 wkwk
Ronaldo problem
The match fans deserve . Still struggling to finish but this domination!
Apa hebatnya bisa ngalahin nTot?
Maguire >>> Tottenham
This man squad is 🔥 🔥 🔥
Surprisingly great result!
CHELSEA NEXT! LETS GO! GGMU
3 Point dramatis
Ronaldo needs to be team player. Unprofessional of him to walk away.
Hugo lloris save
We wanted this🔥❤️
Luckiest 2 goals ever lol. Blind people going on like they scored Prime Barca goals.
useless dier
Dankie United 🤝🏼🔥
United is soo much balance team without Ronaldo ♥️
Lloris was the reason why our goal difference isn't 3 in the table.
London is Manchester United
What a goal
Nice
siuuu
Kazi nzuri
hatrick man is absent ronaldo
Eric if u don't want to play Ronaldo just let him leave the club. Why u ruin his career
Well done United slowly we getting better!
Let’s go
Ronaldo is only problem
Pure joy!
where Ronaldo ?
Was honestly amazing to watch. The boys were so confident and the crowd saw it and reacted perfectly. I hope they can carry this on.
Why didn't he play Ronaldo 😪😪
I'm a Manchester united fan but Hugo Lloris presence was immense in the game
Anthony : the new Arjen Robben
Diogo Dalot has improved so much under Ten Hag that I can't believe he couldn't get a game under Ole. He was always decent offensively but he has also become a beast defensively. He was everywhere in this game.
Fred meant that. But even he couldn't believe it.
It was a fantastic display from the players, but one thing I have to admit is,  Rashy needs to learn how to make his chances count. I cant think of a player who gets more bites at the cheery but doesn't seem to score
Keren; akhir minggu Chelsea juga kita kalahkan
Deflection did all the job.😂
Totteham goalkeeper tried best
Haha Fred Main bagus lo
Ronaldo much much better than lol rashford 😌
CR7 is dead
We miss Antony & Erik so mutch in Amsterdam 😔😔 great preformance from Manu wow..
It’s been a while since i saw our players could shoot as much as last night, what an enjoyable match
It was a Fantastic performance....
2 lucky goals against the title contender pretenders; nothing impressive🤪🤪
Tbh, the goals were very lucky.
Only way to stop cr7 from scoring .ten hag way keeping him on bench. New way to stop him new tactic’s 🤬
Rashfords finishing💀
Ten Hag OUT
Antony is new Robben
Fred was beyond terrible !! His goal was embarrassing 😳
Kane and son were basically never heard form again when the ball rolled
Why Ronaldo get out to locer room 😃
Loris what a man ❤️
unbelievable lloris he denied many chances
Martinez 🔥
Really enjoyed the game...
What awin
What a performance! Could have easily been 5-0.
I love MU
am tellin yall if not lloris it wud have been 10-0
If they continue to play how they play today then no doubt this season with might be the winner.
That’s why it’s called the theater of dreams ❤❤❤❤🇰🇪
Fraud hang is disrespecting ronaldo so much
Fred lol. How I was berating him for Sundays miss.!!!!!!!!!. I thought he put on a great performance. Next stop chelsea.
Casamiro bossing the midfield 🥰 waiting for chelsea now...and I believe we can.GGMU♥️💪
The Spurs keeper was world class! Some inspirational saves. When you United play like this,it’s very hard for anyone to beat them
Kemarin masih suka sama MU, tap kayaknya saat ini emang munyuk ni 🤣
How can I rewatch full match any one reply.????
Nobody talk about fred?
🥳🥳🥳
Well done guys ❤
tetep konsisten ggmu
I hope Ronaldo doesn't spoils the tean environment
Anthony's speed and curve shot reminds me of Robben.
🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑🍑
❤️
28 goal attempts friends, sink that
Guardiola, Ten Hag y Xavi van a dominar el mundo, los dueños del tiki taka en su maximo esplendor 🥃🫡💣
Conte is so polite to 10Hag 🤭
Don Robbie must be celebrating right now Expressions oozing must be in serious agony right now 😂
We don't need Ronaldo. This team so incredible
we need maguire!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
rash was awful
What a Match congrats +3 Man United
United can play and win like this without the CR7.i think he can leave the club now
Hugo crazy saved🔥🔥
Lloris is just underrated goalkeeper. Just this.
They have to beat Chelsea. That will say a lot about TH's team
1:45  "To fool your enemy .. you need to fool your teamate too "  Only fred can make an indirect assist like that .🤣🤣
👍
Not a single clip of Spurs attack! This is Man United attacking hightlights.
With Ronaldo, you lose. Without...well, here's the result.
WE SMASHED THEM
GOGO MU🎉🎉🎉
Thanks Casemiro,thanks Lisandro martinez,thanks Antony,thanks Bruno,thanks all team...is the best performance...excelent !!!
eriksen g maen knp
Performance to remember
Rashford needs to learn to shoot a little bit higher.
where is CR7. we want him to play.
Where is rono
Antony 💪👍
Gk keren ronaldo ngga main
mvp lloris🔥🔥rasford 🤦🏻‍♂️
ga sabar city bantai dikandang MU
For me Casemiro and Fred in the midfield anytime 😊
This is man utd ❤️
Liverpool ☑️ Arsenal ☑️ Tottenham ☑️  We beat these decent clubs.
Rashford should learn curling kick from antony
Weldone guys @manchester United FC hmmm
we need this intensity every match...brilliant performance
GGMU 🔥
Durung dinone raspot
Please change the title of this video, this was a fantastic game not unbelievable....
Fred is red
Our boy Rashy was so unlucky But am very very with the performance 🔴
Nice
Vamossssssssss🎉
Believe, Control,Placing the Ball-Goal (not tirelessly shooting toward goalie)Rashford shud learn this experimentally
And they said we made a mistake when we didn't get Conte
This is total bullshit
This is why Ronaldo isnt playing. Save him for the smaller teams in the league
Fred is so poor...
fred scoring the most fred of goals
yoooh , ngeriii
Martinez 💥
If rashford could score then it will be 4 Neil for united but he is unlucky this time. He is on hatrick on this match.  and yaa very sad for Ronaldo. If he could get Chance to play he surely gonna scores so sad but lots of love always for cr7.
Bonito respect
🤣🤣🤣🤣🐓🐓🐓
all shot from MU
Among all the crazier saves by lloris ..De Gea was the most craziest saved when he's one on one with kane 'The Fly Mouth'
where is Ronaldo???
if it's not because of lloris, it would be 5 or 6-0 bruf
No Ronaldo no Manchester United fan
lloris is Crazy !!! I'm Speechless..
Glory Glory man united
Rashford is so poor with his finishing, like the worst finisher united ever had.
Rashford just can't score at the moment,he tries so hard instead passing the ball.
Lloris Anti Rashford 😂
I made it to 1M view...thumbs up MU
Best club ❤️
Antony 👌👌👌👌👌
Game by game the machine better. Just give time to Ten Hag
Wow
Casemiro, Varane and Lisandro should start in every game. Hit like if you agree
Ronaldo
Honestly this is the only match I've enjoyed this season. Our game was superb
이런 공격력이 계속 되길..
Ronaldo 👏
rashford still needs to learn finishing as well
Stupid manager not letting Cristiano play.
ten hag has improved us alot but he gotta realize that Rashford isnt a striker he misses alot he've to play what he has Ronaldo those chances he missed will be scored by Ronaldo atleast one of them but m very happy the way we dorminated spurs today beautifull football solid defence solid midfield performance but we need more in the attacking side(goal's)
Ronaldo zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
We have to admit it that lloris on great perfomance
fred motm!
People here to watch ronaldo more then a club so why 🥺
We play better without Ronaldo. Must leave in January
Wow
Cr7 is very dangerous player
Cr7 ??
A complete performance.. our right wing is deadly now ... Loving it ❤️
Highlight vs man city mana admin munyuk?  Malu ya
CR7 better out from MU, he deserve better than subs, better to let him go than not to be allowed to play, I don't like legends being disrespected
Rashford always blasts his shot he needs to place it to have a better outcome
Lloris = prime Yasin
Come on Rashford make a goal with more calm strike
I have no words
Rashford needs to improve his finishing...over the past three matches he has missed a number of chances!
We need to be seeing our managers’ reaction .
Flawless performance.
Yesterday we played like a team.
Hugo Lloris man of the match
a win, without CR700.
🔥
Rashford needs to improve his finishing
Between 20th and 30th minutes, United had 73% of possession. Now remind me of a their match with similar stats in recent years.
The Best Performance from fred and united..
The credit should go to one man and that's ETH
Lawaaa siall game MANU kali nii🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing match 🔥
The best manchester united
Ronaldo lol
*Me:"Missing Ronaldo"
Best performance 💯%
oh i luv this team❤
❤️
rashford needs to learn to score more goals in front of the goalkeeper
Not gonna show the best highlight? Ol Ronny boy storming off sooking at 89mins? Highlight of the match for me
Go sporting Lisbon Cristiano Ronaldo, come back to home 😊
Lloris is dangerous🫣🔥
Srsly I'm getting sick of watching Rashford looking down on the ball every time he shoots!  Always a power shot straight on the keeper
Congrats wow 😀
Well done job boys
Finishing is very poor by Rashford.
Antony is total gem❤️
Rashford's poor finishing to be continued
Vv  best performence
rashy, u nee a goal, but also some gdamn composure when u get the chance.
Bhai ooop
where is MU without ronaldo goals ??
If not Lloris Goal keeper on Tot for sure 4:0 or more🤦
Literally unbelievable lol
Dear eth, No need to play someone who thinks he's bigger than the club.  Thank you boss. Ggmu
Ronaldo udah aja ya ke Liverpool atau PSG dari pada jadi penonton 🤭😂🙏
some strikers might have scored 3 times. but Rashford scored 0 times. Need a CF.
Fred fluking all those bounce pass so hard 🤣
FREDindho 🔥
This is my team 💪💪💪😘 united forever
thanks Red Devils...  Gunners on the Top of Table.. . Tottenhamm Lose.
Update nya kalo menang doang ni chanel najis
Benchnaldo
Unbelievable because it doesn't happen very often that ManU dominates and plays well against a top team.
The Gaffer ETH slowly introducing Total futbol at United!!!
ronaldo😔
Kamfred hoki setahun udah kepake 😭
Maguire out
Conte - cr7 didnt play  so at this time united won. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
we should score 4 or 5 more but Lloris was on fire🔥
Solid performance from start to finish.
rashford needs to learn to get the ball into places the goalkeeper can't reach, it doesn't have to be hard
Totally love what this team is developing into. ten Hag's men 💪
Why is ronaldo always on the bench? 😡
Enjoy the process... 90-4-4=94
bang Dodo kan Goat, seharusnya ngEmbek bukan ngAmbek, oalah bang do bang do.
What a game
I like how there is no ronaldo fc in this comment section where you can see it a lot in instagram...
dominating!!!
Where is Ronaldo ? on the bench again ?
Bad shooting rashford this match
Bola bola playing i could have played better than them
what happen to ronaldo?
To be honest this is the best played match for United in recent years, where they dominated and win the match.  If United players continue with this kind performance and confidence they can compete for all trophies.
👍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Why have do your team Ronaldo in this match?
Let's go man United, next match Chelsea
As a Man City Fan congrats on the win Tottemham isn’t a bad club you guys deserved the win great football.
Great rashford
I, who is a Manchester United audience sometimes don't like it, because of Ten Hag's treatment of Ronaldo, because I've never seen any training that underestimates him, I'm sure Manchester United will regret it.
madrid mode
Thats more like the UTD i know and love!. Now do the same against Chelsea and beyond.  GGMU.
GGMU 🔥
Oh man! High pitch guy is back. I thought he’s gone.
Free flowing football without the self proclaimed obsessed individual.
The only problem is useless Rashford 🖕🖕👎👎 💩💩💩
Bench Cristiano Ronaldo and you will get results like this every week
ten hag destroyed cr7
Why Ronaldo
Imagine tottenham if there's no lloris
What a beautiful match for Manu
Rashford so unlucky
nobrainer fred working like a charm
LETS GO UNITED
Give credit to Lloris man, we would’ve been 4,5 or even 6 up if not for him. Fair play to Lloris
Lloris saves👀
Where cr7?
Looks like Rashford has recovered some of his magic.
Thanks reds  we love u ❤
Bro we couldve scored more yho But what a performance

Watched this live at Old Trafford and it was a joy to watch I’m still buzzing. Absolute class performance reds
I like suport rashford ❤️
✌️✌️✌️🎉🎉🎉
Fred was doing magical goal and semi assist 😂
ronaldo
bravo 👏🏻💚🤍
Without slabbie and penoldo they look a decent team
unstoppable ANTONy
antony made tottenham defence look like kindergarden kids passing and dancing easily around them !!!! NICE PERFORMANCE AS AN OVERALL TEAM
Glory Glory Man United
Keep doing that and stop the rollercoaster
Win with lucky
Amazing !! Congratulation to MU !
👏👏👏
We need a deadly striker next season
No entiendo porque carajos no meten a una leyenda
At 4:15 a.m. Korean time, I was satisfied with the results of cheering for Manchester United, not Tottenham Son Heung-min. Casemiru is so cute
As a LFC fan, I was truly impressed how ManU dominated Spurs, this game could've gone to double digits if not for Lloris.
greats winning :
Hugo Loris was the MoM - could have easily been 5-0
I did'nt see any shot from Tottenham was it only for Man untd
The first goal is world class, puskas award
Harus terima kenyataan kalo masa Ronaldo hampir habis
Rashford needs to start finessing those shots instead of going for straight power. That last one could have easily gone in if he just slotted it in the corner
Seems like ten hag found a way to play all of his players to their full capabilities
Where is Kane and son? 😂
Anjas langsung diupload kalo menang
performance of the season so far...
Ronaldo🙁
A swashbuckling performance by United today. Undoubtedly enjoyable to watch them tear Spurs apart. Without their keeper, United would have easily gone 4 or 5 up.  Keep it going Red Devils!
Put Ronaldo at least after 2:0 man
Love from Indonesia 🇮🇩
This match really gives us hope that we can return to our glorious days, it will take time but being consistent enough with this new philosophy................we´ll make it
Still no ronaldo
Nice football display but strikers should be more clinical in finishing
What a game 👊
What an amazing match...Everybody was fired up...wish everyone could play like this in all matches
Rashford needs to learn to place the ball in the corners instead of trying to burst the net every single time...jeez he would score so many more goals
Great game but it's disrespectful to leave the  goat completely on the sideline especially looking y how he singlededly tased totts last season.
mantap Lord Fred
Збс когда в опорке опорник, а не Эриксен, да?
Kiper francis yang satu ini cukup bagus,banyak sekali yang di tepis
Congratulations to the entire team, you deserve the victory👍👍👍 wishing you for more victories🤲🤲❤️❤️❤️
Woow! I missed this match but it was really fire. Go bous go. United 4 life
Last save from Hugo of rashford was like superman reflex !!
Where is ronaldo😑
rashford is so unlucky
Bruno Fernandez and Fred best performance 👏👏👏👏👏👏
United the club of my dreams
Viva ronaldo
As an Arsenal fan, thank you guys for beating Tottenham
Cr7 is actually a captain material... We want cr as captain
best math for man u of this season, worst match for totenhum this season
Ggs for lloris
One of the best performances i have seen!! However a certain Cristiano tried to ruin that with his obsession of always wanting to be in the limelight. It is high he gave Manchester United utmost respect. TELL CRISTIANO THAT NO ONE PERSON IS BIGGER THAN THE CLUB!!! GGMU 😍
Fighting spirit, teamwork, and Winning mentality, let's go for a new era, not the glory of the past 🔥🔥🔥
This match accept only slow ball not fast and sharp 🤣
Ronaldo instead of Rashford, it had been 5 goals
Why did you stop CR7 when you don't want to play him?  Such a pathetic decision by CR7 to rejoin MANU.
Lets go! 🤩 manchester uneted win again
stars need fred
Spurs why did you?
It looks like Rashford is cursed and he is never going to do a gol. 🤔?!
conte out
Winner
Every goalkeeper becomes prime Yashin when playing against us.
crazy longrangers🚀
Glory united
Most dominant performance of the season by far 👏🏻👏🏻
Anthony left foot joy to watch
1:01 THAT WAS A CRACKING SHOT BY CASEMIRO JEEZ
Rashford should work on his finishing with both foot and head..... only power is no bueno!
Casemiro really did massive impact for MU midfield.. 👏
This is Manchester United, keep pushing lads
seriously is Ronaldo a man baby? why can't he grow up and act his age being a supporter, mentor for the club and his fellow team members. Wanted a mentality boost from CR7 for the team turns out to be the most rubbish mentality of them all lol
When Casemiro play, Midfield superb 👍
No maquire???? 😭
wow
맹구좆되노
Lorris why  ? I wanted us to win 5 -0 for the first time in years
Ronaldo fanboys will never be happy😪, all they want is Ronaldo playing the game,even if it cost us 3 points
why can't we have attack like this against newcastle..
GGMU
Don't know why rashford plays, guy can't finish one goal properly
Rashford ought to switch intelligence for power. There isn't only one way to score a goal!
Lloris played really well btw
it should be 7-0 FR tottenham lucky have lloris
this was a 6-0 game without lloris, top class goalie
Thank for wins Manchester ♥️
Blessing united
Cristiano🥹
Cuando no juega Cristiano ganan
Where is ronaldo
it's better to just sell cr7 instead of becoming a slacker player
Lloris was the man for spurs else could've been 3 4
สุดยอด
*MUFC* *Thailand*
Love u Erik ten hug...  As a manager club is a fast priority not unprofessional ronaldo....love man und
very unlucky marcus
If you don't respect Sir Alex, it's better for CR7 to move to Manchester City. It's better to be a loser than to have a career destroyed in a team that you don't consider.
C Ronaldo now
Glory MU
What a game this was!!!!❤️❤️❤️ defence brilliant..Bruno Antony magnificent!!!❤️❤️This is united and what we love to see!!
Get out Cr7
Out of all players, it’s Mc Fred!
it's better to just leave CR7 than to be destroyed in Manchester United. Not to be considered a mega star player again by Tan Hag.
The red Devils ❤️🔥
Where cr7
This team set should start every week and week out... United legends should get over Ronaldo and stop interfering in United management, let ETH do his job independently..
👍 GREAT
If Ronaldo in the field it maybe a bigger score ....
날강두 없으니 바로 공격력 살아나는거 봐라 ㅋㅋㅋ
Selamat buat Manchester united atas kemenangan 2-0 ata Tottenham Hotspur
Keep penaldo out....and sold him  as soon as possible
Ronaldo 😍
The team dominated spurs. The team pressing throughout the whole 90mins, constantly fighting back for the ball, winning most of the second balls, possession, and most chances. Also clean sheet. Best team performance. All without C.Ronaldo which should be seen as a positive as we shouldn’t be relying on him. He needs to think about the team and not about himself being childish.
No CR7 on the starting line up easy win🤭
FRED's TALISMAN
Permainan Badut yg bisa mengalahkan Daya tempur Londong 🤣
No player is bigger than the CLUB!! If you plastic fans can't appreciate Erik Ten Hag and these sets of players rather showing your frustration and support for past prime CR7, please get the fuxk out of my beloved CLUB!! What else you plastic fans want? To see CR7 having enormous gametime or witnessing our CLUB moulding into the best?????
Being an Arsenal fans thankyou 😂
Since there is no CR7 we don't care about win or lose without Goat an average club 🤫😓😓
Please play like this consistently...
No CR7, MU won..
Finishing rashford🥲
Rashford is fire 🔥🔥
I love cricket
I feel sorry for rashford..he got to score at least one..what a performance
Where is KING OF G.O.A.T CR7? Why you did not starting him when you have THE BEST FOOTBALL PLAYER IN THE UNIVERSE?
From a Spurs fan, you guys played so well. It's hard to say it but our football is so hard to watch, we deserved to get absolutely spanked today
First team performance that I think everyone played a role in. Usually it’s either two defenders or someone forward who shines
I missed the match due to time difference but i am happy that United won against Spurs! Looking forward to next match against Chelsea GGMU
Fred is not a skillful player but he is very  committed and hardworking 👏
I always believed in our team no matter what
Finishing rosfoad to try hard work again
Enjoyed every second 🔥🔥🔥
Alhamdulillah ❤️🤲🏼
Fans of CR7 Hope he will find the better new Team for ending his career as the super GOAT in history of football !! once he find it, he will face against MU to crush this team with full respect of no celebration ! ✌✌Siuuuu...
Sack The Haag
No game for Dodo, MU will win each games.
Ronaldo
if hugo lloris didnt show up to play, it would probably be 6-0
rashford 👎👎👎
gelandang MU berasa pen jadi striker apa
La verdad se ve que la afición del MU necesitaba mejorar su estima, alaban un par de victorias y no lo discuto ¿pero por qué llevaron a CR7 si solo le iban a quemar la carrera? Y bueno, espero le dejen ir es lo único que pedimos quiénes seguimos a CR7.
Love you man united❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rashford should learn how to curler
WHY CANT THEY UPLOAD FULL HIGHLIGHTS
Martínez 'n Varane what a Game!!!
맨유 최고
Alhamdulillah 🤍🤲🏼
Rashy vs Loris
Rashford need learn how to shooting class. Not every shoot need power ！
Fred redemption 💪
I'm always feel bad for Ronaldo for not playing, he deserves better
Next chelsea Yok bisa yok bisa Kompeni ten hag bisa yok
For a Striker, Rasford missed too many goal scoring opportunities
La directiva no apoya a Ronaldo, por tanto debe hacer un paso al costado e irse a otro equipo. Ronaldo todavía es uno de los mejores del mundo.
Top and excellent performance ❤💯🙌🏼
What a game
gempurane MU joz tenan.. Selamat buat MU..
🔥
This win was very much needed and it a very top class performance
Wow! Just wow!!!!
Glory glory Man It's👺👺👺🚀🚀🚀
Basta de humillaciones a cr7 no se lo merece es el mejor del mundo y lo quieren hundir
why is no one talking about shaw and dalot performances. they were great in the build up and they were linking well with eachother
I don’t think that Spurs was tough opponent in this match. We can’t ignore the fact that we played well in this game, but let’s be honest Spurs wasn’t a competitive rival.
Beat performance so far
Sangat di sayangkan cr7 tidak di mainkan.padahal dia adalah penyemngat dlm sepak bola
Keep trying rashy..
Ronaldo Out
💯💯💯. Mervyn southafrica. Utd. Best performance 🙏
👍 Walaupun menag tapi tetap gak seru tidak melihat Cr7 bermain sampai akhir laga
Rashy my man please go for a curler when you're taking the shots like antony does , it is much more effective than punching with full power
Rashford still hasn't learned to stop shooting directly at the keeper when in the final 3rd
Rashfood skill is so rough， at least he had 2 times absolute chances，but he didnot got
Wheres penaldo
Jesus can change your life ❤️✝️
Loris  best keeper
28 shots on target This is what is needed 🔥🔥
Big win UNITED👏👏👏
Kane wont be playing world cup this year, Martinez locked him up in his pocket
United  is better team
United always attacked on the other hand Tottenham defensed at the all time of the match. They targeted counterattack with Sonny but Lisandro has a enough speed!
Hugo Lloris is the best
Does rashford ever see where the goalkeeper is before he shot or he just never do it , and shot him in the face and hope he will dodgege the ball
Man Utd 💪💪💪
Give Mr. Hag 2 complete years and let him take all the decisions independently. Manchester United will be fighting for the EPL.
Will to some mid club 😂🤣😊🤣
Rashford is a waste
Hight intensity , Come On!
Man united gives goosbumbs without cristiano🥺
Hugo loris is another level of goal keeping
Hang on, why Unbelievable ?
Calamity Maguire packing his bag after this game...Ronaldo too.
Bye Ronaldo. Thank U for everything.
geniuses, only win replays!
We play far better without ronaldo
no spurs chance???
Man of the match,, Lorris❗
They play on their best each other , class player
You can see the joy between Antony, Fred an Fernandes. Something you wouldn't see when Ronaldo would be on the pitch.
BRO, WHERE'S THE MADRID'S LEGEND??? HE DIDN'T PLAY? 🤭
I loved the set piece creativity aswell
GLAZERS OUT NOW
Everyone happies for UTD，but Ronaldo
congrats my best team 🙏❤️
One Win and We all Excited Again. 🤣
Rashford always going for Power instead of accuracy and finesse is his biggest flaw
Buat mu musim dingin nanti tolong beli Ante rebic dari Ac milan seperti nya Ante Rebic cocok main di mu,mksh
United had possession the entire game! But Fk u united for not using The legend Ronaldo
Cr7
Great performance for the team. Glad ETH has finally realized how important Casemiro is. Now he needs to play Ronaldo up top and Rashford on the wing. Rashford is at his best on the wing and we need Ronnie’s finishing. The way he’s being treated is disgraceful
❤ MU . . . 👏👏👏
Advice for tottenham no more perisic
Respect hugo Lloris performance 💪
Loris lg on fire, kalo enggak udh brp gol itu 😁
man united fastastis triangle(casemiro,varane,martinez)👍
"Utd lead and deservedly so...." when was the last time you heard that!?  Amazing game!!! ETH is truly working!!
Rashfprd cannot shot
See.. RASHFORD was showing off his juggling skills on MU YouTube short..but its useless if he didn't score..
Rashford is such a poor finisher
Anthony was amazing as usual.
United played 🔥🔥🔥🔥 City fan here
no no it is not unbelievable  it should be normal for you  muschester
Easy goal by slow Fred :D
I miss Maguire....
Rashford should have started against Newcastle
Nicee  MU ❤️
This better game. Kipidap
Amazing for team favorit
How does rashford keep playing when he has missed a hundred chances this season
Solid. ❤️
Ronaldo started in the min70, Second goal
Favourite moment was with Manchester city 🔥🔥 By Haland 😂😂 who destroyed MU
If Lloris played like we normally did we would have scored atleast 5
Should of been 6-0
Why rashford misses one vs on chances 😢
What a game from ronaldo 👏
Rashford still missing chances like there’s no tomorrow.
Rashford missed so many opportunities to score 🤬😭😭
Goalkeeping 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
أين الاسطورة هاري ماجوير ؟
I'm FC Barcelona sign a Fred
Tumben menang
Keren
Man UTD better without CR7 , he should leave
Respect from Algéria 🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿❤️❤️❤️❤️🇩🇿
I don't what the future holds for Christiano, but i understand his frustration. He carried this team on his back, last season. Now he can't get a game. This is total disrespect to CR7! Great win today! ETH u said so yourself, he will rotate the squad, but u leave the GOAT on the bench for 90mins! 🤷‍♂️ He's still a fantastic player, he needs a run of games, and of course service. Anyone agree ?
rashford teach to plesing
Nah gini dong
❤️❤️🙏🙏
Play CR7
LLORIS SUPER SAVE 🔥🔥🔥
If win So fast to up
Just like to show your appreciation to the Master class performance from the players.
Why rashford shot with full power. He need to make variation in shot
Let cr7 play ffs
Man United misses 2-3 goals
Again the great performance by the reds❤️❤️. We have to More focusing on pressing football
lloris saved tottenhams face. Would have been 6-0 or 5-0 if it was an average goalie guarding spurs goal
Nice ❤
Spurs played so bad that United looks ok in this game
that save against rashford is the save of the season, the power on that ball was insane.
All because Ten Hag is brave enough to drop Ronaldo and deal with the negativity that was being injected into the team. That's one of the best manager moves he has made ... if Ole and Ralf had done so... they would have been rewarded with more cohesion.
ggmu
Rashy just unlucky
Fred so lucky
Ronaldo Out
Glory Glory Man United
These bafoons only show up when it's Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham??
So glad to see the love team win.  i love red devil  Thailand
Uzoho>Lloris
We went from a goalless game against Newcastle to this 😂
Always United.  It's you CR7 inspiring the team mates to reach this level. What an extraordinary performance. Big salute to Tenhag
Mu v goalkeeper
Rashford needs to finesse more often.  Lovely display by the whole team Ten hag ball
United was hungry however I hope they're not too full against the Blues
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am just sad about CR7 situation bit at all it is amazing to show how this team play today and i hope they will keep the level on
Sell Ronaldo, his attitude not acceptable as a profesional players. Too many drama with him. Let him go!
*Tanpa Cristiano Ronaldo permainan Manchester United memang sangat baik..permainannya Lebih Agresif banget..mereka terasa tidak ada beban untuk main sebagai sebuah team kompak banget..gue pecinta manchester united kalau dgn cara begini Pelan pelan tapi menuju JALUR JUARA di depan mata walaupun dalam masa transisi.. CR7 gue akui pemain hebat..tapi jika main selalu menjadi andalan dan itu tidak akan bisa..Bravo Manchester United*
Haven’t seen a more complete performance in a long long time, really enjoyable football to watch
alhamdulillah...menang...🤲🤲🤲
Ini yang aku suka 😎
dominated. wish rashy put it away
this is Manchester United 👍✊👆
Best yet 😊
Fred Looking alot like makelele😉
Obviously you’re never win the title
Rashford really wanted a goal...next time buddy👍
👺👹
Erick Killmonger was terrified with goal + assist accidentally
0:06 fellaini was played too?
You gotta love Lloris, he still have some sick reflexes What a goalkeeper
Antony next Robben
i Love you MAN U
This is a new era, you can feel the buzz in the air. What an amazing game, everyone's meshing beautifully.
What a game! We dominated full 90. Antony was superb. Wish Rashford got a goal. He got into a lot of great positions and seemed really confident today. Brunoooo!! Love him so much. What a curl. Casemiro, Martinez, Varane, Shaw, Dalot, Sancho, De Gea. Top performance tonight!!! 👌🔥 GGMU!!! 😭
emyU menang kalo maen pas tanpa ronald0.  Kesimpulan: jangan mainkan ronald0 kalo mau memang
Menang dipuji, kalah dibacoti 😢
No dodo win
we dominated the game , and we deserved to win !
Cmon you Red Devils!!!! Clean sheet!!!! GGMU!!!!
Son dan keane pindah MU aja
Santai teman Minggu ini bagus.. Minggu Depan ngetroll lagi
1-0 Fred 2-0 Fernandes
7 saved by hugo
Fred stats: 1 deflected goal  1 deflected assist ☠️
Absolute masterclass 🔥🔥🔥 Only City and could be one more loss otherwise...
Man Utd treated Spurs like they were Omonia They got man handled by Man Utd
Keep going Reds ❤️
I never found before. This is a shooting game in all angles ☝️😍😍😍
Best football we've played in a very long time, slowly but surely 👍🏼🙏🏼
If it was Ronaldo then it would be he wasted a lot of chances, it’s rashford and it’s he deserves a goal for his hard works, come on! The coach doesn’t like Ronaldo. Maybe for his ego or success. Ronaldo is a better option than rashford in attach and he can also play Ronaldo rashford and antony. With Bruno casemiro and ericksen in midfield. He will get his result. This just an ego fight. Rashford is not lethal. Be truthful.
Kalau menang aja baru di posting
Ronaldo?
Cristiano my boy miss you
Appreciate Conte
I´m a Barcelona fan, this is amazing! Thot have a lot of lucky, easily this game could ending 6-0
Rashford just hits it hard and hopes! No finesse or accuracy
not amazing safe, just poor attempt.
A very big win
Ronaldo
Ronaldo man of the match again
Ten hag🔥
3 points in de bag 💼🔥🔥🔥
The constant disrespect Ronaldo receives from Ten Hag is simply not on
Gotta say something bout Antony left foot
Cristiano Forgetten What A stupid Ten hag ....
RASHFORD: IN THE MAKING OF MONSTER BY TEN HAGG
Wow! 🤝🇳🇮🇳🇮🤝
Tottenham should build a statue of Lloris cuz if not for him there could have been 5 or 6 goals
Luke Shaw’s volley was definitely something. Glad to see him bringing his England performances into this Man Utd squad. Unlike some other people (a certain English Centre half)
yesterday CR-7, now Rashford...is this a curse for the man utd centre-forward ?
Lloris wasn't gonna let Rashy scored, great perfomance by both of them 👏
Conte: We lost against United  GGMU 🔥
just rescpect lloris💪🤘
That's the ugliest kits I've ever seen, by Tottenham
hats off to Lloris
Best game this season!!!
Kenapa mu selalu main bagus ketika melawan tim big 6
Things would love to see. More of this please Man United!? Let's GO!!👿👿😈
Should Lose Man UTD 👀🤔😶🧐🧐
Lol, the way Fred Score and Assist is just different man
Kane was found shaking.
"if your ambitions beat your talent" . Casey Stoner to Valentino Rossi before vale retired. This is Manchester United FC not Ronaldo FC 😏
What we love to see😍😍
Fredinho
hey, just happy Luke Shaw is getting in form again.
Manchester united forever ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🇸🇳🇸🇳
Ten hag proyect💜
Casamigos. My man of the match
Glory  Glory  Manchester United 🔥🔥🔥
Hernandez goal was sooo smooth
So whatsap with the greatest ever player to have played the game. Cristiano Ronaldo hmm I think the level of disrespect from ETH is just crazy.
The best player is goalkeeper's spurs
Conte: Last season we lost against Ronaldo. ETH: I don't think so.
Classic performance of   the season
That ugly jersey costs tottenham the game
Lord mujair mana?
we support Manchester because of cristiano.  why didn't Erick play him.  What kind of coach do you have the heart to hurt a cristiano who has done so much for this team.
great assist from dier
We need to see more Harry Maguire for better results.
Hugo Lloris ngeri sih_
I'm a die hard fan of Cr7 but I think he needs to work on his attitude now more than ever. Many of our young players look up to him and EtH just wants the best for united.
Great job 🤩💯☕🏆
Hugo Lloris 🙌
Top
Gg mu
Rasford apes banget..ke save mulu
Best
Same will happen to Chelsea
Great to watch ,United was supreme. Credit to the manager and players. Could have been 4-0 if not for a fine performance from Lloris.
All hail lord FRED
Had Ronaldo been in the line up, the result would have been different.
Rashford needs to work on his finishing or benching
United at last get a top class manager.
What happened with cr7 today?
We must admitted 35 Yo Hugo Lloris is wonderful
Rashford needs to vastly improve his finishing. Every attempt was a head down blooter. No composure or finesse. A top striker would have placed every one of those chances and scored.
Rashford ❤️❤️❤️💯💯✍️✍️✍️
Could of been 7-0
Without cr7. Bruno often makes goal
What a performance, i love you guys
My favorite moment?  When Antony sent Perisic back to negotiations over a swap deal with Martial
Looking strong.  Looking very strong.  ❤️
Rashford so unlucky
Must change the title LLORIS unbelievable performance 😅😅, can't believe he saved 2:05.
The way this channel uploads winning only quickly very funny but losing games can't be here hihihi
Erik put his standard for his boys. Come on, lads!
Come on reds 🔴⚫️
Best performance of the season
This game shudve been on comedy central sum1 reckons, it was hilarious an hour an a haf of pure entertainment, two bad sides
Wearing that kit Spurs got what they deserved. Incinerate it!!!!
Manchester united vs Lloris 😅
Lmao just win against tottenham and hoh guys flying
antony = patrice evra 👍👍
Hugo Lloris 9/10. Have to admit that.
My first ever united game, so happy I was there to witness it there at old Trafford!
Superb🔥
Que festejan ridiculos si el primer fue autogol y el segundo un chiripaso del mediocre de Bruno
Konsisten
I am very impressed by Man United performance today,  the fact that Tottenham didn't appear in that game at all ,  And if it wasn't  the brilliant goalkeeping from Loris, it would have been a historic result in Old Trafford !
free Ronaldo
Man u will beat all d top clubs but can't win against lower team..utd should have played man City before d International brk..I'm sure they would have beaten d noisy neighbours..but unlucky for us..we meet them after d brk..
mu mulai bangkit
VARANE x LISANDRO TOP CLASS CB.  CASEMIRO luar biasa BRUTAL DMF di tengah 👏👏👏
Ok,
Dois gol cagado...
The Most Dominant and Brilliant performance since Sir Alex 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Porque el Manchester united no juega así todos los partidos
as always, Fred sucks 😀
Spursy
Rashford never change...just power power and power ..you must smart more for your shoting
Well done lads 👌🤜♥️⚽🙏
Unlucky Rashford
Top win 😮
Lloris saved Tottenham from this game being 5-0 or something
Only post the winning match, pathetic
Fred....🤧😀😀
Fortune support a lot Man u to score goals.
Nek ora ndeleng menangan banget koh, nek ndeleng malah ora menang menang 😂
Steward Gardner is back!
Конечно не смотрел матч полностью, но по тем моментам которые показали можно сказать прибавляет МЮ.
Anthony is just class. What a game!
Who needs cr7?
2:05. Rashford laces it as hard as can every time if he placed it with the side of his foot he would have 4 or 5 more goals this season
MU vs Hugo Loris
Vamosssss UNITED 🔴⚪️⚫️
just unlucky today for rashford.. hopefully he Will get goals again..
Go UTD!! Tonight we showed class, the movement around the pitch, 577 passes and 28 shots, 10 of which on target. Let’s keep this going !!!! ❤
Rashford finishing is poor like put it in corner not drill with head down ffs , Eric Dier at fault for both goals so will take that but need to start scoring more
Rashford has to be more clinical. Should learn about placements rather than going for power in every single shot.
GGMU 🔥🔥🔥
Lloris making rashford mad
Obviously glad United won, but credit where credits due, Lloris player a blinder. If it hadn’t been for him, Spurs would’ve been tanked, nay buried.
Casemiro in action! He mad United look as the lethal Real Madrid of 2017/2018!
Permainan yang sangat solid , kuat dan menang? Hugo Lloris hebat
giliran gw ga nonton live mya aja menang dah
Please upload in 50fps
What a performance from the team..i just can't believe how bad we made Tottenham look...the best performance so far under ETH...btw was harry kane and son on the pitch?i never noticed them
ETH is building a system. Be patient guys!
Brazilian's took the shine today
Having a left footed winger makes such a difference💪🏼
Sorry to say but bruno always shine more without ronaldo.. i"m not blame ronaldo I'm a big fans of him but. Its fact. Look at bruno in portugal..
This commentary tho ....
Definitely the best performance of the season. Everyone was on point! GGMU. That's how we should play for the rest of the season.
🥲
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GGMU ❤
Well done MU, we see more of teamwork and goal scoring opportunity!
Si anjing gak mainin Ronaldo lagi 🥺.. harus gimana coba, kalo jadi Ronaldo?
Kalau mainnya gini terus mah optimis
Conte ball is absolutely dreadful, if I was a spurs fan I'd be worried
Wonderfull Goal From Fred & B. Fernandes. Manchester United Winners Against Tottenham Hotspur In The Old Trafford Stadium. Commentator : Steward Gardner.
The media doesn't play football, if you're a true Man United fan then you know we're taking the Title not next season but this one
every player put a shift in. The best united performance i’ve seen in a while.. what a game and what a win. This is what we need every week
Lloris denied us to win a 4 goal match
Domination from start to finish, love to see it.
Why didn’t you up the highlights when you lose ? Like 🆚  City and more teams this season ?
Ronaldo yes
Useless rashford. Let him go
GGMU
Rashford: Where should I kick the ball?  Keeper: To me. Rashford: ok, here you go.
In holland we call Ten Hag the profesor  give him time and he will let united shine
Rashford is so bad at 1v1's
Pas menang. Langsung upload.  Pas kalah 2 hari baru di upload
Rashford wasting lots of goal scoring opportunities dude will miss 10 chances before scoring one and Paul scholes and the Ex man united English players praising him . He needs to work on his finishing, not just shorting straight to the keeper with force like an armature player with no technique. I wonder what he is learning from chistiano Ronaldo in training … Every season he keeps wasting chances .. That’s the difference between him and Martial , Martial will calmly score those chances
One of the best games we've played not only this season but in a couple of years. Complete dominance throughout the game. Played with a lot of confidence while being displined.  Great game but it kinda sucks that the biggest talking point will be Ronaldo walking of the pitch before full time.
FRED GOAT
ignore ronaldo i hope ronaldo leaves man united
They deserve to lose and get spursy..
What a brilliance performance by Hugo Lloris. We could score 4 goals or more
Glazers out!   Great game. Fantastic performance. But shame the club don’t see fit to cover the vocal support for the protest against the ownership.
In first seconds Casemiro with Gavi💯
Should of been 4 or 5 still need to kill teams, but huge step.
This is wat we like to see Thank you United😘
That Casemiro kick 😲
Fred was the hero for both goals
United looked like a fifa player who got lucky in a online game 🤣🤣🤣
Thanks to our best defender Harry maguire ❤
CR moved on and is happy with his new club that respects him,,, the crushing side of ronaldo that is bruno and erick
Sleeping well tonight..
Yes ♥️🥰
Rashford can’t finish is ignored today due to accidental goals but it may get exposed in games like against city
WHAT A TROPHY
Manager is a cr7 hater he's a Messi fan
Unreal guys ♥️
I don't think there was anything arguably about it, it was the best performance of the season so far, a more complete performance, better in attack, in defence, in midfield, in and out of possession.
Fred and Anthony should never be at the schoolgates beating our mighty Tottenham.
Incredible performance from the boys. Rashford can do better with his shooting though. Not everything requires power. Sometimes, all you need is placement. I hope he learns from this moving forward.  Onto the next one 💫
This is the most enjoyable Man Utd match I've watched since that game Vs City after McTominay made 2-0. Euphoric
Rashford was so unlucky man, but lloris was absolutely insane
Casemiro is Man Of The Match For Me.
no way does that count as Fred’s goal hahahahaha
Alhamdulillah... Glory Glory United
if it wasnt for Lloris being an absolute beast it wouldve been like 5-0
Great performance my boys ❤
Martines casemiro  antony  varane.  Jos
CR leaving the game early and not celebrating with the team was really hard to see and confirms for me he is not worthy as a team player. Other than that, awesome play by the rest of the boys. Deserved win and as a Dutchie, I am really proud of Ten Hag. His passion everytime you see him makes me proud! Lekker gewerkt, pik!
what is so UNBELIEVABLE ????😂😂😂😂
Fair play, well deserved. Coming from a Spurs fan
Rashford really needs to improve his finishing, May be united can finish with 4-0. Also respect to Hugo lloris.
Wow 19 shot
Really sad for CR7 😔
Hugo Lloris 👍😅
Rashford needs to be more clinical,placement over power works.
should’ve signed lloris instead of dubraska
Fantastic match
Antonys left foot curl is amazing, I just hope he stops doing it all the time because I think it’s gonna become too predictable soon
"It's not today Rash" - Hugo Lloris 😆
Hugo Lloris nice performance
Why does this team create so many chances for rashford but when Ronaldo starts he doesn't get one decent pass? not one?
Lloris not normal
Wow more of this
Ten Hag stupid dog from Coca Cola nothing more.
Le faltaste nuevamente al respeto al Mejor jugador de la historia Y uno de los 10 mejores de la actualidad ......... "Fuéra HIJO DE PUTA Ten hag" 🤨🤨🤨😎
❤👏👏👏👏
What a performance best game best team best players best play best result best win
Fred konyol.. Ya gol nya, tendangan nya pelan banget
I'm smiling but Rashford should be level on goals with Haaland with these chances he's getting smh
quandale dingle
Man, Rashford really frustrates me. He has all the talent but i never understand why he always goes for power shots instead of passing it in to the net sometimes. So annoying. A bit more conposure and finnesse shots in to the aide netting instead of smashing it with no control of accuracy.
Keep on Win
rashford needs to be more clinical. he needs someone to give him sense of finishing
United dont need Ronaldo sorry 😅
Tuyệt man united mạnh mẽ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm a big Arsenal fan but I have to say utd were great to watch tonight
0:36 more like an absolute terrible finish by rashford
Jadon Sancho is slowing down game  👎
Please upload the match even tough united is lose.
the amount of misses rachford is having this season is ridiculous...
Fred was brilliant, don't understand why he is so much maligned.
CUNTE OUT😠
GG
Welcome to Manchester United
Another game another win what a performance GG MU
There is no player greater than the team!!!!!!!😮Cristiano 😅😅
Untung kipernya loris
Lucky for MU
amazing MU  performance this night ,and amazing kiper ( Totenham)safe !!
Rashford 3 Gol 😬 Lorish !!!
I can't remember Harry Kane or Son getting the ball more than 3/4 times..
Battered them
The big win Again
Antony
up
MU nih boss, senggol dong
Fredinho
Everyone was superb today ❤
why u don't show the part where cr7 disrespecting the club and the fans?? huh??
Hugo Lloris played well just unlucky
🫡🫡
Come back Stronger Bruno Fernandez. ⚔️⚔️⚔️
Great team effort every single one of them 🔥
You guys act like you’ve won the CL final, it’s just Tottenham who have been horrible but lucky all season
Lloris is a incredible keeper should have be 5-0
Where's is penaldo.
MANTAP GGMU
fred is crap, and rashford beating the defender just to dive rather than taking a shot
FC BRUNO 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
That's ma boi !
I would have jizzed in my pants if shaw scored that volley
Manchester united admin was so shocked that united won  , He wrote unbelievable 😂😂😂
glory Glory Manchester united ❤️♥️
Rashfod oohh rashfoodddd 🥱🥱🥱
Best Manchester United game I've watched in recent years... it's not so much about the goals but the possession,  pressing... shots. .. teamwork ( not sure Ronaldo walking off counts) etc.... Brilliant brilliant from Manchester United! !
Henry right, rashford should be more calm and not just put power
Rashford needs to work on his finishing.
Sensational from Man Utd tonight, Bruno back to his very very best
THIS MATCH SHOWED ME HOW SLOW RONALDO MADE THE TEAM!
Un believable? Its a long way to go.
Bravo United 😘
Padalarang,bandung barat hadir✔
Could have been 6, Marcus is looking lean & sharp.
Im an Arsenal fan but, United have beaten us, liverpool and now spurs. Theres something to be said about that.
WELL PLAYED...
Ronaldo turned down a team that would have given him more scoring opportunities for a mess up team like this . Now this is his payback   If he was selfish he shouldn’t have been a man united player now .
Utd 2 Lloris 0 Harry Kane was invisible
Boys played well today and fred was on something today. Come on GGMU we await chelsea
Lloris was such a monster today
Fred about consisten... He cant it
Everyone was amazing
Dominant from start to finish. Been a long time since we've had such a performance.
Fred is inconsistent, we can’t afford this
Rashford unlucky
Fred is still the worst player in the premier league. 1 goal doesn’t change a thing
Antony's curler that hit the post deserved to go in. It was the curlingest left foot curler I've seen in eons. An absolute belter.
콘테 감독의 페리시치 전략으로 토트넘은 참패했다.
Should’ve been 6-0 but for Hugo loris
Rashy is doing everything right but that goal keeps eluding him. Keep at it Rashy, sooner or later the goals will come.
RONALDO, Thoughts?
Martinez and Varane were immense at the back today. They gave Son and Kane absolutely no sniff at the back. What a change from the calamity at the back from recent years!
Cr7 above Man Utd.. clown club
ចប់ហ្មង Spurs
And for those saying Mctominay is better, Hold this
I need to play Goat Legend there😔
GGMU
No Ronaldo? No Problem ! He's been so desperated to leave the club since this summer so just sell him in Jan ! This selfish fool got no respect for the club and fans lol
without ronaldo even if u win the champions league ,its not as winning to most of the fans
oh they should have added the moment Ronaldo left before the match ended
Thanks mate!  - from a gunner
At least try man. Try showing Ronaldo some the much respect he deserves. You telling me you couldnt bring him on last 5mins of the game, winning to 2-0. I'm livid man. RESPECT
Love the game, awesome plays and passing. However, Rashford's shooting absolutely horrendous, it was painful to watch him shoot. We need a better striker.
Hope this run continues. Awesome performance from the team. GGMU!
Complete performance from Man Utd. Spurs have no creative players at all.
spurs defence was horrible tonight ,easily avoidable goals
Didi we play well?
Rasford should plassing the ball instead of put to much power on the ball.
Rashford oh rashford
This was you guys best match of the season maybe along with Liverpool.
Amazing performance, need that consistence to keep going
Glazers out
This is a convincing win.
Antony left foot is magic
Ronaldo walking out, what was he trying to prove.. that he's a diva??
Casmiero make united over power.
Masterclass performance. The energy in that stadium was livid, from the boys, to the fans, the game. Game of the day for sure. Though Ronaldo man.
Cie..Tottenham digendong sama Lloris
Who's need penaldo??
they shud played this kind of game against Man City
A big player is who can loves the Fans.. in every moment
🔥 This is the real 100 million from ANTONY 🇧🇷 ANTONY. So cool. Fool everyone's head. Two people, three people, after breaking both of them. Haha. Think of RONALDO, 19-20 years old. It's the worst. If you compare RONALDO's age as much. ANTONY Now RONALDO has won the Ballon d'Or ❤
Flattering scoreline, Should've been 6 or 7
GREAT
🔴 Man United 👻 What do you eat? Played better than all the past games, played really well. The chicken couldn't lift his head. Spurs couldn't make a game today. Man United was awesome. Really applaud. Played better than every game in the past. Now Manchester United win 3 Big Six teams. If they win Chelsea will win all Big Six. Except for one team, Man City played like today, much happier, happier than their wins over Liverpool and Arsenal.
Many attacking options available now.
🇧🇷 FRED gave an interview to Skyspot on the date of next year's Ballon d'Or award.
Victory manu👍
I don't care what anybody says, Hugo lloris is man of the match !
🔥🔥🔥
Get rid of Ronaldo. No one's bigger then the club.
Stop talking ronaldo talk about the performance from this squard. Todays performance was a nostalgic one
Misss
Yes, Greats again!! ManUdte. Thanks you
Whatever triggered this brilliant performance, more please. This performance brought tears to my eyes. When Man Utd players play with such passion and skill the world is wonderful place. Proud.
Nice shooting!
UPLOADNYA PAS MENANG DOANG YAHAHA
SIIIUUUUUUUUUUUU 💪
Has Ronaldo been demoted to orange boy or something?
Always nice to see spurs lose
I like tottenham jersey🔥
Rashford as always useless.. don’t see how he’s getting pushed ahead of Ronaldo when this boy will never be close to step in his shadow.. Rashford is definitely not Man U material.. the manager has lost it and Man U is not even close to what it use to be ..
Rashford vs Lloris 😂
Rashford needs to work on his finishing he’s needs to learn to place the ball in the corner it’s not always about power
Varane/Martinez/Casemiro, now that is an excellent axis. Been waiting for that axis.! May they stay fit for the rest of the season🙏🏽
Sayang sekali Ronaldo tidak main, Padahal ingin lihat selebrasi SIUU
With 2 goals United missed a lot shots, that's fantastic performance of H.lhoris👏👏
Wow, so amazing manchester united Let's go to number one 👍🥇
2 gol from ronaldo...congrat ronaldo
Absolutely hate Rashford's shooting technique
Fred’s best performance this season!
Topp
The best game mu player's💯💯💯🙌
Harry Kane...  Come join us
What game united played so powerfull.
Hi
Thankz for match
Anthony going into the WC is already a superstar. What a player
rashford has no composure man. just goes for power rather then placement. most of the time if you look at his shots compilation always direct at the keeper or its slightly wide of the keeper but they still can reach it as its not going too far away from them. it looks like he can't do placement with power. unfortunately we still don't have a striker. can't except to go far in the season with no striker man.
I would purposely not sell Ronaldo.  However, I would not play him for even a minute.  He would be warming that bench until the end of the season for such disgusting unprofessional behavior
Yes sir
Impressive performance. The best one...keep this performance attitude...
Its getting better all the time.
lloris was unreal this game. that last rashford save was unbelievable, was like a slip catcher
gg MU🔥
🔥 This is the real 100 million from ANTONY 🇧🇷 ANTONY. So cool. Fool everyone's head. Two people, three people, after breaking both of them. Haha. Think of RONALDO, 19-20 years old. It's the worst. If you compare RONALDO's age as much. ANTONY Now RONALDO has won the Ballon d'Or ❤
Best performance of the season bur ronaldo starts ahead of Rushford,  I know what ronaldo did was disrespectful but same can be said about eth when he even didn't used Ronnie for 10to 15 minutes ahead Rushford
Lads, it's Spurs
맨유 화이팅!!!
Great performance, rashford should learn how to finish like a striker, no need powerful shot but just put the ball in the bottom corner😎
United winning is actually UNBELIEVABLE! Keep up the great job, devils.
Can someone tell me why Loris never won the ballon dor goal keeper or even best player
Finally, some shooting fest
The goal that Fernandez scored he was actually showing Fred how it's done 🤣
Buy a new LB again then Shaw is gonna win Ballon d'Or
Fred redemption arc
Who else watch Bruno goal more than once 🥰
Winning 11
GGMU! Let's keep this momentum!!
WE NEED THIS FIGHTING OLWAYS FOR THE WINNING 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Ten hag is very very impressive I genuinely think he can win us some silverware
1:48 Fernandessssssss~ So Familiar with that
Ronaldo walking out before the game ends is disrespectful
Glazers out
Pastor Fred 🔥
🙌🙌🙌🙌
In recent form we gotta say this is the best we've seen
Is this the same United? Its like Ten Hag has laced their drinks with some wake up potion.
Thought we was going to loose bad but the lads proved me wrong great team play and passion GGMU ❤
How is Lloris 35 years old and making these foxlike agile saves. His missus is a lucky woman
its just Tottenham,,we used to be always defeated them at home (like glorious old time),,need more consistentcy in against top of the table.
Giliran gak nonton,menang!!
Kamfret the best lah
The reds keep back on track again!
Best team in the world man u
having casemiro in front of martinez and varane is really making our defense even more solid.
*_This Is Man United!!!!!!_*
Bruno without Ronaldo = performed. Bruno with Ronaldo = yup you guessed it
Dalot doing stepovers 🥶🥶
IN ETH WE TRUST🔥👏👍
No spur time win in Old traford
Mantap
Ten Hag Is Such A Waste🗑 He Doesn't Knows How To Respect The Goat 😤😤 The Bald Guy Is Destroying CR7 Career🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
No Maguire no Ronaldo the sun is shining bright 👍👍👍
Man united 🤩
Casemiro absolutely Beast bro 😳😳
Tot CB is shet... Respect for Lloris 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
just hoping the team can stay this consistent week in week out
Lloris 👏, Go go United 🔥
This was my first ever trip to Old Trafford, thanks for making it worth the wait boys ❤️
Rashford is fuming 😤
Stop disrespecting CR7 🤬🤬🤬
Giliran menang, cepet uploadnya. Celenk😂
We’re going to the top of the table hard work💯💯💯💯
😀😀
👍👍👍👏👏👏
Huge saves from Lloris! But today the squad played so we'll then before. Keep it up!
ETH should stop the disrespect on Ronaldo, he wanted to leave in January and had offers but the coach tied him down only to disrespect him like this. Ronaldo is justified in walking away, he deserves better
No CR7 , yes party
When maguire didn't play, that is the best moment for MU
Did messi finished ? did mohamed salah finished ? did ibrahimovic finished ? They just want to finish ronaldo hhhh ...
Pretttt kampretttttt
Where is ronaldo?
Casemiro cdm is the best than fred
Hope we keep this up vs Chelsea. They won’t allow us to dominate like spurs did, so we’re gonna have to impose ourselves
I feel rashford should work more on his finishing
10/10 Perfomance from the lads, just need to stay consistent and fight as a team
Fifth place with a Goal difference of zero
That fernandez goal tho 😩😍
FRED THE RED!!!
I hope Rashford does not fall in confidence because he did so well but it wasn't his fault that all his efforts didn't come to fruition. Keep up the hustle Rashford! 🙌🏼
Ten hag proving to conte that he lost to united!
What a great team performance, we should have got more goals but illoris was solid. It’s so disrespectful of Ronaldo to walk out of the field before extra time. It’s shows how arrogant, selfish and all the self glory he wants for himself. No one is bigger than the club. GGMU
We've beaten two club of london , next for chelsea and crystal palace c'mon reds GGMU
Tanggal 2 0. Menang 2 0 full senyum
Congrats👏
So it's unbelievable in capital letters when the players do their job? I don't think Tottenham showed up yesterday and I think the performance of the United boys was decent, but not spectacular.
Fred ,Bruno ⚽️⚽️Goals 👍
🔥🔥
Revival is on for MU, cheers for putting down cocky Spurs in their place. :P
Finally putting out early highlights
Congrats Manchester United ⚽️❤️👍
DOMINATING GAME, KEEP IMPROVING LADS
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alhamdulillah MU saya menang☺️🇮🇩
Sad feeling for Ronaldo.. ETH needs to give him time in this crucial match.. And also give the time to youngers.. VDB needs also time in pitch after recovery
Bruno Fernandez 🔥🔥👍
Ronaldo should leave earlier 👏👏👏👏👏👏 Ronaldo please leave the rat’s of MU, they don’t deserve you.
conte lost to a team called united not Ronaldo.
Fair play to Hugo. Stopped us going 4, 5 up tonight lmao
I don't think there's a bigger Ronaldo fan in the world than me, so it hurts me to admit this...but United "this season" actually look better without Ronaldo ☹️
Kurang bagus CR7 tidak ada dalam permainan
Rashford must get more ruthless with his shots, He must pick spots that don't give the keeper any chance. Sorry to say this but like those Greenwood angles.
Today Conte lost to Fred  and Bruno, How about that!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keep it up! ❤
Lloris against Marcus : 👹 same Lloris against fred : 🤓  what the hell
What has happened with Rashford's accuracy - and I can hardly see any team play, only individual performances following each other!
rashford needs to finesse more rather than just blasting it
Wow what a performance 😝 One of the best performance I have seen from utd  But I think Rashford needs to improve his finishing for me But what a performance Erik ten hag balling is fantastic 😍
What a magnificent performance!! Well done Red 👏👏 We go again on Saturday
Fred oh Fred. A totally different player today compared to the Newcastle match.
Rashford really needs to be a lot calmer in front of goal, not all chances need to be struck with power. could have had more goals to his name in this game.
That Fred through ball was niiiiice, nice to see him score, bit less stick for him for a while .
👍
Well done lads
A well deserved win, but I feel rashford is overrated
This was like watching classic Man Utd during the Ferguson years
The best performance from man united this season
프레드 폼 미쳤다..  내가 알던 그 프레드 맞냐? 이대로만 하자 사랑한다 프레드
It's only totenham
Enjoyable match. Top performance!
Great result and what a performance
This kind of games we expecting
Antony the next robben
Without a Lloris this was 6 or 7-0
feel a stranger at home. At least don't hold him if you just want to kill his career
Anyeeeeeeeeeng banget ❤
Please keep playing like this United, its very fun to watch...
The manager is class, even Conte showing respect to the man, a few signings in January needed
the theatre of dreams
Wasnt pleased with MU Perfomance Since The 2-0 Against City Before The Lockdown. 👏👏👏
Man utd without Ronaldo nothing😢
Rashford needs to work on not smashing it every time
JUST PURE BRILLIANCE FROM EVERYONE. A TEAM OUT THERE 🫡
Ronaldo out
Why do highlights take so long to be uploaded?!!!
Should’ve won 5-0 😅😅😅
I just want to see Ronaldo
Martinez and Casemiro were outstanding
No Ronaldo no party🎉
Ronaldo
Only that we were robbed  during Newcastle game
Harry who? Son who? Were they even on the pitch??
Fred is not consistent
❤️
Manchester united vs Hugo Lloris and 10 stick hahaha
Chelsea next,if we beat them we move to 4th
0:58 の監督かわいいw
My favourite thing about this game aside from the 28 shots on goal was the number of turn overs in their half. That high press is a thing of beauty!
Cool
Cristiano Come on
Consistency is key.. well done boys😎
Casemiro BOSSED IT! Fred still RUBBISH n goal was flukey not surprised as it's spurs their spursey Will see against Chelsea a proper test
If not because of Lloris we could've scored 5-6 goal
Well done lads, played very well. Rashford needs more confidence up top, he lacked composure. However, with that being said it was a fantastic game from the whole squad.
GGMU ❤❤🎉
Jangan main individual
Free Ronaldo
Rashford needs to place shots more often, rather than going for power. He gets himself in so many great positions, just needs to be calmer and place the shots
What a perfomance !!! GGMU 🔥🔥🔥
The only sour point of tonight IMO is rashford's profligacy. Granted, Lloris was superb tonight but he was helped by Rashford's incessant preference for power over precision. Man's got to learn to become more clinical and perhaps shoot more with his left foot too. It's becoming a worrisome theme for him
🇮🇩
This was a rout in the making, wish we played this way more often,class game
Unbelievable indeed 🔥🔥
GLAZERS OUT
First season Fernandes
0:07 Bruno 🔥⚽️
Rashford don't learn..his finishing is dead. Lower the ball down in the bottom corner and you have 2 goals for yourself
Yet another open chance for Rashford to put one away. How Rashford is starting over Ronaldo is beyond me!! He can't finish! He can't complete a pass! He can't cross! He doesn't track back or press any players, and when he does he fouls the opponent! HOW, just HOW is ETH playing Rashford over Ronaldo
Great performance but Ronaldo 😭
Vamossss
Bruno Goal was excellent!
Licha, Fred, Case, Shaw, Bruno , Sancho, Anthony… impressive 🔥,   Rashy was unlucky but he played well too …
manchester united gano el mejor equipo
Ronaldo must leave this dumb club
United is undergoing Reforming and restructioning, and they enjoy playing Football again. Exited for the future!
Thank you united
😂😂Dier going to the WC ? I can’t imagine what will happen to England now
Hell of a performance all the way around  RASHY BABY 😩😩 LESS POWER, MORE FINESSE  AND STOP PRESSING SO MUCH
19 shots in the first half, is all I gotta say 🔥
Today Fred's performance was totally impressive, he outdid himself in many plays and showed what he is capable of in a great game. We charge him because we know he can always do more! ❤️
Antony played a part in both goals, he was excellent today just as everyone else 💪
GGMU🔴
Fair play to Lloris, what a performance by him 👏
Why Ronaldo leaves the pitch early?
Best performance for Manchester united  this season so far under Erik ten hag🔥🔥🔥GG united
Ronaldo 🤲💔
What was your favourite moment from the game? 💬
That save from De Gea make ref doesn't stop the game, awesome finish from Brunp
Erik ten Hag is a powerful manager like pep guardiola, klopp ancelloti Tuchel... just trust him and give him time to build a compétitive team able to win trophies for Manchester United
Cry more cr7 fan boys
Great game. Antony's shot was ridiculous.
It would have been more than 2goals if there was no lorris brilliance 🔥🔥
Bruno's finish was so classy
FOREVER UNITED LEGEND CRISTIANO RONALDO  BORN AND MADE FOR UNITED THE FIRST TIME YOU EVER CAME ‼️ 🐐GOATNALDO
Big disrespect to Ronaldo tho, you guys could have brought him on for even 15 mins just to allow him to get some game time... A mean come on we will not win the league but show respect to those who showed you respect and was and still is loyal to you guys because just imagine if he went to city
GGMU
Best performance of the season 👏 🙌  COME ON UNITED!!🔥
antony is different!!!
Rashford is just unlucky, stop saying things like 'we need a proper no.9'
Please keep this way Man U
Best performance of the season 🔥
Rashford is the best striker in the planet
Can't wait for Sunday's night.. Just believe
Casemiro bring us the stability in the mid field. That was missing almost for a decade!
Saya tidak menyangka Man United akan menang, tottenham milik conte sangat superior. tapi selamat
A great victory and beautiful goals. Thank you to all the players in the team. An important victory. Congrats on the win. Be happy, Manchester United fans.
Congratulations for the whole team, and the big credit goes to the defense which was exceptional
What a performance and without penaldo kinda sums our season

Genuinely one of the best United performances in recent seasons. If not for Lloris it would’ve been 5 or 6, ETH really leaving an imprint on this team and it’s there for everyone to see.
Lads it's Tottenham
Best I’ve seen us plan in a LONG time 💪🏼
