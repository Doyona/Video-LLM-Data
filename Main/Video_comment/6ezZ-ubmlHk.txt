What seed will the Lakers end on ? 🤔

I remember when rui dunked on AD
Japanesefan

Watch out for fake golden hoops giveaways. Tried to say I won ps5 wanted me to pay for shipping.
The Asian Larry Johnson lol
yall had to put a clip of him putting AD on a poster 😅😅
八村塁もここまで有名になったのか。レイカーズでも頑張って
2:09
I freaking love this trade
まさかこのチャンネルに八村特集されるなんて。 BIG感謝
Lonnie walker , Rui , with bron and somtimes Russ that's promising
頑張れ塁！ 応援してる！
八村はやってくれるはず
Can't wait to see Rui + Russ + TB + LBJ on the floor together ! Let's do this
God loves everyone
Rui a more athletic Kyle kuzma
八村、オールスターへの第一歩
He is a fan of golden poops
What did the Wizards get in the exchange?
Rui gonna put somebody on the poster tonight if he plays
Hmm, NOW japanese people like him , WHY, he's black!!!💯💯🤨🌎🧔🏿
Rui Hachimura should have no problems fitting into his new/old LakeShow squad 💯
Y'all definitely gonna win the championship this year .
I swear the lakers need me , I would bring home the championship trophy repeatedly 😅
Subtweeted
Welcome, maybe we will get into the play in round, no promises. lol.
Great beats to the video with the voice of the narrator 👍🏽🔥
Man the Lakers court has been his home court lol
Why didn’t Sean Marks get him? 😢
Alwys looking for the easy way out building super team to win a championship, Lacrybby is no GOAT
Dope💯
MedMen Marijuana stock is Moving Up! Set your Family up For Life! Buy MMNFF stock today......
Laker the new wizards team just with Lebron SMH 🤦‍♂️
Lakers got a huge steal, the Wizards made a horrible decision
Honestly a very great trade by the Lakers to get Rui I rate it as an A
He is so fine welcoming to the team bruh 😊😊💪🏾💪🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🥵🤪🤪
Mf said konichiwa 💀
Might be the best thing pastinka has done, other than that, the rob lowe wannabe is a bum
Comeback lakersssss let s gooooooo
Russ, Rui, and Bryant already developed chemistry on the Wizards together!
with all due respect we can't get excited for this....
LeBron traded for Rui cuz he dunked on Isaiah Stewart multiple times 😂
AD is just a princess on glass shoes running around in NBA.
Finally a player that can hit a consistent jump shot playing with Bron it’s crazy watching the lakers an how they just can’t even hit a open jumper it’s just crazy to me wen your career is basketball just practice your craft an stop practicing your life style to become a goat I miss old school nba fr !
Anybody that thinks Rui Hachimura INSTANTLY makes the Lakers a top 3 team is smoking gorski.
I thought Rui was going to be more than he was when he got drafted, hopefully the Lakers can get him there.
Rui got game. Smooth as butter
If all stars align, they get lucky , rui gets cooking and AD comes back this season might be special
Well, I can stop betting on the wizards now. That was the secret to their success.
Too bad he still wont make the playoffs cause of Laker drama.
Seems like a big dub for the L
Glad he with us but that was a offensive foul against Davis
I’ll miss Big Japan in the district 😢 hope he does his thing in LA
Lakers are trash Lebron is done.
He plays like a baby Greek freak with  a better looking shot 🔥🔥🔥
Y’all still ain’t winning shit 😂
この動画が今季のGolden Hoops史上トップレベルに伸びてるの、ありがたいですねぇ〜 日本人として誇らしい限り！！！！ 頑張れハッチ！！🔥
I am a big lakers fan!
Rui hachimura has Scottie pippen potential
Y’all fanbase is huge
I feel lakers will do better since he played with thomas bryant, russel westbrook, they know how they play together and it will be better, let's go lakers
Rui already put AD in a nasty poster this should be fun let’s go Lakeshow we here
Young athletic 3&D wing. He should be a great fit for the Lakers.
Wonderful plays! Go Rui🎉
Such an efficient player. No wasted moves. The dude can just ball! He's young and plays D and can score! Should be a perfect fit for the Lakers.
los angeles wizards
Lakers making the play-in let's go
As a fan of Rui from Japan, I'm glad to see he is expected by fans all over the world! Do your best, Rui🔥
With Rui in the roster, it's championship or bust now.
Bron is gonna take Rui’s game to another level… just watch‼️
People don't know how good and legit the Lakers are. This guy makes them even better. The reason Lakers were losing close games and LeBron needing to drop 30+ points is because Lonnie Walker is out, and Austin Reaves, and AD. Even with Lonnie Walker and Austin Reaves, Lakers were winning those close games. The last 35 games, Lakers are 20-15. They started out the season on the wrong foot (2-10 start). And they are not far behind playoffs teams despite all the close games loses. When this team is healthy, this Lakers team can make run
HibachiMURA! Welcome to LA. W’s.
取り上げてくださってthank you！！！
Excellent move by the Lakers! Rui is awesome!! I am really looking forward to seeing him play with the Lakers!
YEAHHHH WELCOME TO LA RUIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
八村ディフェンスでも頑張ってくれ！
his career is destroyed now..
頑張れ八村！😆😆
Now i want rui, tb rus and brown off the bench so that bron wont mess with their vibe ..
u quick！😊
As a Wizards fan, Rui has a 0 basketball IQ and defense he doesn't know what that is
Welcome to Lakers Rui. Love your game a lot ❤
idk man hes face looks like giannis antetokounmpo
私は日本人で、彼がロサンゼルスに行ったのはとても嬉しいことです。応援しています
🔥🔥🔥
Imagine 3wizards player already playing for Lakers now Russ, Thomas Bryant, Rui
I'm rooting for the Rui from Japan❤
I'm really looking forward to it because I got along very well with Russ! Good luck!
Lakers hit a jackpot on this trade. They Got Rui in exchange of nothing.
Nice edit. Where do you get all your footage?
Definitely a laker fan
bryant russ troy and rui all reunited
日本の至宝⭐️  Let's Go Rui🔥🔥
Russ,Rui,Bryant reunite again
🇯🇵JAPAN これが八村塁じゃあ〜
こんにちはるいー
1:25
レイカーズでも頑張れ٩( ᐛ )و Let's go Rui　Let's go Rui Let's go Rui
まさかこのチャンネルに八村特集あげられると思わなかった😂
日本の八村をお願いします
Nice move 4 d Lakers👍👍👍
Thomas bryant, rui, and russ reunite along with ad and lebron
I saw a new Carmelo Anthony.
コンニチハ！ルイ！
Probably should've tried to get Avdija......
Good trade!
nice trade~  Russ+Rui+toB
皆さんがいいこと言っていて嬉しいですね
Im happy he's aggressive n dunks 💯
Great pick up
Additional missing parts
八村きたーーーー！❤️‍🔥
This dude has the same energy as Trez
再生数えぐすぎてびっくりした
good luck Rui🇯🇵
It was a very good trade for lakers, hope they can make a run now
is he available to play tomorrow
レイカーズでも頑張れ!! Let’s go RUI🔥🔥
He looks and played like Giannis 😱
I am Japanese. The Lakers are a popular team in Japan, and Hachimura's transfer to the Lakers will increase the number of Lakers fans in Japan😊😊😊
Wizard connection russ to bryant to hachimura ? 🤔🔥
I'm Japanese. What are your thoughts on playing Rui Hachimura?
I think they need to trade ad for a shooting star player and let hachi and bryant flourish
八ィィィ🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want to see what this line up looks like at some point.  Schroder Walker Rui LeBron  AD  All 3 way players who can create for themselves and others. They’re all playmakers with high IQ and a knack for creating in pressured situations.  I can see them ending a lot of close games.
As a laker fan I'm really excited about this Pick up
八村頑張れ！
Wow!! Can't believe the Wizards let him go. I can only imagine that there are many Wiz fans that are not to happy with this move.  Laker Fans - you guys just got damn good and young baller that is really coming into his own right now....
I am a Japanese who supports Rui. He is big and can run. Goes well with the Lakers transition. His shot has waves and is not much different than Troy BROWN jr. He is good at midrange, but won't hit much because he suffers from AD. His defense is his biggest concern. Closer to Kuzma in 2018. It's slow against guards and weak against bigs, but it has the potential to disguise given its size, mobility, and length. He's actually an above average wing defender based on the data. I think it was the best choice not to use the 1st Round pick.
He can play 3 positions on the court
how did the wizards think that all the best they can get was kendrick nunn and second round pick, atleast they couldve settled for a first round
八村単体で動画になるの影響力すご
これは最初はただ「ええまさか…偽ニュースだろうw」と思ったが本当行ったね？？？
Joke!!! Alperen sengun plz
He not a all star but he athletic and can  Defend,   he can give them 15 points 6 reb ,  2 stls
Can't wait to see him and Russ rim running going at it again but now with Bron and AD 😬
Someone is going change his jersey number :)
Just saw the trade now and realize 🤭 lakers pick up a underrated player. Rui Hachimura gonna get big minutes and gonna help the lakers with athletic ability to go to the rim and also knock down three point shot.
Oh great for the purple and gold.
Hachimura videos shows him to be an offensive player rather than a defensive player.
Rui is like Antwan Jamison. Defense not too great but a good scorer
OH SHIT that dunk on AD LUL
this doesnt move the needle for a 12th seed team. sorry LLLaker fans
Kind of weird that they added an Asian player with everything going on rn
Perfecr fit
Know he happy wow great pick up for the Lakeshow
僕は日本人で八村選手を応援してます。しかし海外の人は八村選手がレイカーズに入ることをどう思っているか誰か教えてくれませんか？
13 points a game with the Wizards? Nah I don’t believe it he ain’t motivated to play for the Wizards. He a Laker now I’m sure he’s going to play even better!
remember when Rui Hachimura dunked on Anthony Davis
Let’s goo Habachimura
Yesss cmon lakers come back and mode final again
Welcome home lods Sana galingan m sa team lakers
WE got a Daiso Kawhi
八村さん！レイカーズでも頑張ってください！😂 応援してます🎉🎉
Other side version of giannis🔥🔥👈
Rui was wasted in Wizards and they failed to develop him. The kid got potential but his stagnant growth is infuriating. I hope the Lakers can help him grow into a great basketball player.
that poster on AD 😅
Los Angeles Wizards.
He will turn into bust😅
Beal on his way...
紛うことなきビッグチャンス、その真価を発揮しろ八村🔥
Rui getting a mix from golden hoops..🤣😅😂👍👍
Good pick up. They really need big bodies. Too many small guards. We need rebounds and people who can box out.
You're not the official Lakers channel to do this, stolen views, pathetic.
Japonês negão no lakers kkkkkkkk
Gianni's style hichamura is a threat
Many Japanese fans will turn their attention to BKN and LAL. Including me, of course!
what they need is team play.  everyone is shy to make move. because of uncle james.
I just realized that the Lakers picked up both Thomas Bryant and Rui from the Wizards. They looking to pick up Beal and make a big 3?
Am I tripping or does he look a like Trevor Dunbar
That's a good look..
that AD poster was brutal. im surprised he didnt get injured
Welcome to the lakeshow brother
Rui can be an all star player like  Paul Millsap.
Rui is my favorite player.I think he can partly support LA!!! I cannot wait to see on a line-up!!!😊😊
我らが八村を取り上げて頂きありがとうございます！！
One thing I missed about Rui's game is the fast breaks. Wizards under WUJ are one of the slowest teams in the league, always walking the ball up half court. It's going to be good seeing him run the floor again.
WHY HE LOOK LIKE SHAQ & CHUCK BABY
Hang On Rui..Rui Hang On...
lakers  starting 5  lebron  pg hachimoro pf  thomas bryant c beverly sg schrouder sf this gonna be deep lakers starting 5 and theyre gonna make playoff
Rui has played with Russ and with Thomas Bryant at the Wizards. He will add to the Laker's chemistry, shooting, scrappiness, size, athleticism. Exciting trade!
A very poor´s man Giannis but that can make his FT.
💪
Hachimura-Russ-Bryant the Wizards are in the Lakers
ニヤケが止まらん
Konnichiwa ☠️💀
Wish he could continue to wear number 8, but that number is retired. Maybe #88?
I see nothing but upsides on this deal! He’s played with Westbrook so there is that cohesion and he has some game. Work with lebron on conditioning to become a beast and fix that shooting! 🤯 lakers could win a championship in a couple years
Japanese Rudy Gay
Watch ad get converted to japaniesium  @2:27
レイカーズの方が八村もやる気出そうな気がするんだよな～
Wait actually
Rui  Giannis
We are officially the Los Angeles Wizards with this man in the roster. Welcome welcome my guy
russ rui and TB all got some kinda chemistry already might be a good trade
RUIをよろしくお願いします。
出番がどれだけ頂けるのか解らないけど頑張ってほしい。 渡邉がネッツで八村がレイカーズ どっちもスター軍団と言われるとこに所属ってのが凄い、、日本人がレイカーズに、、ありがとうございます  もしかしたら、ジャパンゲームでネッツvsレイカーズ見れるかもってこと？？
Rui already wore a Laker jersey so it is true.
He seems to be in the right spot most of the time, we can use that for sure.
Funny he dunks a lot with his left and he shoots right handed
I can imagine when LeBron is resting  you see rui hachamara Lonnie walker troy Brown jr on the floor together with Thomas Bryant and Dennis Schroeder
Wow his best 2 dunks are both on big stew 😭
This guy can use his left and right hand inside the paint area in when shooting
He plays and moves just like kawhi
Rui can be the other Core for the Lakers team
Excited na ako mkita cila sa25
Him playing LeBron James I like it
Him Russ LeBron James AD okay Rob Pelinka finally his GM hat or was it LeeeeeeGm back at it
Crazy he played with Russ TB and Troy Brown Jr on the wizards. He should fit right in 🙏🏽
He reminds me of Giannis for some reason
Dude what are the wizards doing… Migrating to LA I guess.
He's better than Ben Simmons
That Dunk on AD tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣let's fuckin go Lakers great pick front office about damn time
Anthony Davis staying at Center evidently.  Lakers 2nd Unit will feature 3 former Washington Wizards teammates: Russell Westbrook  Rui Hachimura 👍 Thomas Bryant
感謝
Ham shouted in his mind. 'Oh my god, another guy who can't play defence.'
Nunn is good shooter but too many guards… I hate to comment this because I like Davis but he’s prone to injuries from the beginning of his career.. Lakers need to trade him..Welcome Rui to purple and gold..Good  job Lakers organization..
Welcome to laker nation 💜💛
Weak Trade zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Reunion with Westbrook and Thomas Bryants, lez goooo💪
Ruinited with Byrant and Russ
Lakers =Washington
Finally a good trade for the lakers
Lets Go Black Samurai🥷
インサイドめっちゃ強くなるね！
He remind me Thomas Bryant lol
this guy is fucking cold
Does this mean Anthony Davis’ days are numbered in LaLa
Thomas Bryant has his running mate now what are you going to do
Japanese boys are entering NBA with a bang
Yeah but lA is known for dimming players lights
I like how Rui in his 5 career playoff games averaged   15 7 62 FG% 60 3P%  Also in 6 career games vs loaded wings Clippers he’s averaging 16 ppg on 61 TS%  The 2nds are Bulls 2023 (prob 36-46 range) and 2029 + 2028. Rui 25 on Feb 8, but still young and 6’8” 230 is much needed! Also no matter who the team is 2nd round picks hit as good role players or better 10% of the time historically at best!  Add some more shooting/spacing and this team is a legit contender (if healthy obviously).  Low key since starting 2-10 (with historically bad 3P shooting) Lakers 20-15 record (20/35 without AD and 2-3 horrid calls late costing them at least 2 maybe 3 wins + LeBron reffed bad all year) since Nov 12 is tied for 8th in NBA and if they beat clippers (gonna be tough as bad matchup especially with no AD Lonnie AR Rui I imagine) 21-15 is tied for 6th best record with Cavs & Heat!  20-15 since Nov 12 (since 2-10 start) is also tied for 4th in west with Pelicans and with fair officiating they’re 3rd or 4th near kings since then behind only Grizzlies and Nuggets for best west record!
Lakers finally did something that’s will help them.
7th
Hachimura is the twin bro of TBryant Hachimura😆 damn they really look alike
Lakers' starting lineup would be Dennis, LeBron, Rui, Anthony, and Thomas?  Big big lineup.
Additional garbage bwahahaha......
Let's go Lakers!
IMAGINE LAKERS HAVE 2ND UNIT WITH RUSS....DENNIS...BRYANT....MONTE/PROZINGIS/GAFFORD THEN PAT
trade westbrooks if not no playoffs for lakers
Cannot wait for Rui to play with Russ again!!! 😍😍😍
I HOPE THEY GET ONE MORE FROM WIZARD ITS EITHER PORZINGIS......DANIEL GAFFORD OR MONTE MORRIS.......EITHER ONE OF THEM........
Good pick up.... Lebron dismantling the Wizards roster after John Wall statement 😂😂..... Westbrook, Thomas - Bryant, now Rui lol
Los Angeles Wizards Russ, Bryant, Troy Brown Jr, Rui
ゴールデンフープスに八村が取り上げられるのアツすぎるww
Overrated and inconsistent player - Change my mind
Napasigaw  ang commentator konichiwa 😂 😂
His best year is when rus is their point guard. Now he is with rus in the Lakers. Congrats Lakers nation
Los Angeles Wizards 😂 Let’s gooooo
He needs better defese
HAHAHAHAHA🤣🤣🤣 I FEEL RUSS PLAYERS ARE GOING TO THE LAKERS......AND THEY ARE DOING GREAT.....DENNIS...BRYANT AND NOW RUI???? HAHAHAHAHA
Well he better than nunn for sure
ありがとう
If he’s any good they will say lebron had to much help.. y’all mad cause we lakers huh!😂 #LakersHate
This is a W for the Lakers! The FO finally did something.
He's a solid player wit all star potential 💯
This is really good for Rui. He was shining when he had the minutes he needed before his injury. This is necessary and good moves for both teams.
This team finna be DANGEROUS!!!
We dragged Pelinka and Jeanie on Twitter enough to make them do something lmaoooo
at this point the lakers could get kp for lonnie and 3 seconds too
What if rajon rondo still play to the lakers? 👀🤔  Rondo Lonnie Walker LBJ Rui AD
Dude better hustle, take smart shots and play with energy otherwise lakers fans will destroy him
"Los Angeles Wizards" 🔥
As a Japanese I never even imagined of seeing two NBA player from Japan playing alongside Lebron and KD.   The fact that two Japanese NBA players are existing at the same time is still crazy to me.
Rui is the pride of Japan!!!🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
https://youtube.com/@_mackiee__
Now if you added Beal and Bertans in the mix you'd basically get 2020 wizards roster
What an addition to the Lakers, so excited to see him in the line-up. Once we get AD back, we're in business.
I didn't realize how much RU HUCH is hella bouncy!!...4REAL THAT 💪🏽💯
Huge W for the Lakers! Hoping he balls out with the Lakeshow! Welcome to LA, Rui!
Yeah welcome to l.a rui . I'll  buy l.a's jersey of urs so xcited. Konnichiwa
reunion westbrook and tomas
TF. Lebrons team is for all star team
reunion with westbrook and Tb
Welcome to Los Angeles Wizards (TB, Westbrook, Brown jr., Hachimura)
Good add for the Lakers! Welcome Hachimura! Go Lakers! 😂
A stretch four that can shoot. Great addition for sure
Rui plays with joy.
chinese giannis 🔥🔥😮‍💨😮‍💨
He did Anthony Davis dirty 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Excellent trade, Rui will fill a very nice role with the team
AKAGI!!
LA needs a team that works together to make chemistry, that can't happen in one season, see what the C's is doing now...
We can't really say yet who will win that trade because the Lakers' current problem is 3pts shooters and Rui only has 33%. And his defense is also not that good. I hope that will improve there in the Lakers. The most fit in the Lakers FOR ME is Bojan Bogdanovic because he is a 3&D player and that is what the Lakers need right now. But we don't really know what the outcome will be so let's just wait and see 😁
Finally, Lebron Got some help, Put this man as a Sf instead of JTA much better.
Wtf is this real
Golden hoops one of my favorite channel
レブロンとラスとADとチームメイトでレイカーズのユニフォームを着てプレーするの熱い🔥
Japan guy for laker welcome
Wizard x Lakers team 🤣🤣🤣 LMAO
🇯🇵🔥
Kuzma would be nice too
OMG!!!! laker nation こんにちは！！！ welcome to los angels Lakers!!!!! let's go rui hachimura!!!!
Giannis 2.0
Wil he play tomorrow against Clippers?
the klaw 2.0
2 weeks until Shannon Sharpe yelling at him
Lakers shouldnt have waived matt ryan, i believe him, russ and hachimura could do some searious damage on all the angles of offense.
日本人として八村がレイカーズに来ることが嬉しすぎる！！
Nice upgrade for the Lakers. Gonna be nice seeing him in transition and cutting in the half court. The Lakers also finally get more length and simplify their guard lineups. He’s also young and a restricted free agent this offseason which means we can match any offer for him. Teams probably won’t offer him much which means we can retain him for a decent contract.
Shrodder, Lonnie, LJ, Rui, & A.D. Deadly...😈😈
Bro Rui rlly just be posterizing stewert for no reason 🤣🤣
Still not making the playoffs, lol.
Oh.... my God. I cant believe it.... The trend on Twitter is one color with Rui Hachimura and Lakers now.
i stg when ad gets back they need to start bryant along with him, then have this guy along  w russ and gabe off the bench and that bench is gonna have insane chemistry
I am the venom golden hoops
good decision making.
i fuck with golden hoops cuz you know hes a lakers fan LOL sadly
Rui hachimura has lots of potential
I didn’t expect that
Rui probably wanted a trade just because none of the Wizards' announcers could pronounce his name correctly. It's Hah chee MOO rah.
八村塁選手がレイカーズへ！ 日本からアツく応援しています(^^)
Hmm.. Rui
Washington x Lakers Russell Westbrook Bradley Beal (incoming) Troy Brown Jr Rui Hachimura Thomas Bryant Lets go Washington Lakers/Los Angeles Wizards!
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Los Angeles Wizards
Damn I just read an article yesterday about lakers possible trade. The 5 players in the option, I was rooting for Rui and here he is. Welcome to Lakers.
This trade improves the Lakers, this season. However, they gave up a lot of future trades to get him. I'm not sure it's worth it. It all depends on how good he meshes with the Lakers.
Yamete kudasai
Russ bringing over the entire Wizards crew! Lets goo Russ! Up next: Bradley Beal
Every time the announcer says "konnichiwa" I cringe just a little bit harder.
Happy the lakers traded Nunn for Rui hachimira 🔥🔥 great trade
2:05 the assist on this dunk is filthy
That’s old highlights don do me like that show new highlights of him am mad
7
If the first dunk was his only highlight.. I'd still be like "bet!" 👀
Him playing wit bron and Russ is good because they expect you to step your game up and he will definitely elevate on this team
Great trade, I'm surprised.
W trade! Shame he cant wear 8 in LA
great trade. lakers need someone that can show up when lebron and ad dont
He play beside Russ and Byran in Washington.. great addition to the Lakers...I hope they use him..
Pray for him
頑張れルイ！
Welcome to lakeshow hachimura ♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥 the Thomas Bryant effect🤗
Now we have 3 wizards players or 4 that have chemistry with them from before (tbj, russ, tb, and now Rui)
I thought kuz will back at Lakers🥹
as a Japanese, I’m so glad to see him in lakers
Los Angeles wizards
A better version of Stanley Johnson.  I'll take it.
Lakers sucks.... 🤷‍♂️
きた！塁がキタァ！！
So happy for Rui let's go Lakers Nation 💯
did i hear scotie pippen?
It’s on AD
They need to sign Kwame Brown
This is actually a very good pick up a versatile wing should take some pressure off Lebron
Rui is probably the one player who has Kawhi’s physical tools, if only the coaches could get it out of him consistently that’d be Christmas 🎄
Great pick up by the lakers
Russ and Rui were a great combo at the Wizards... It was Russ that told Rui to play with more aggression... Good to see him reunite with Russ
This reminds me of kwame and gasol trade😊
Let’s go and make some more trades
八村の特集ありがとう！！
will he play tomorrow?
T Bryant, Hachimura, Davis, Bron - Lakers going height and muscles
W
Love this kid ! He's an unknown monster. He has a little mean streak.
very nice, lets go lakers
Wizards really let him go for one of the worse players in the league kendrick nunn... 🤣 what the actual fuck wizards?!
The whole wizard team wanted to join us in L.A lol.😁😁😁😁
It's all falling in place : 1st 5 : Denis Schroeder, Troy Brown Jr, Lebron, AD, Thomas Bryant !!!🔥🔥🔥 2nd 5 : Russ Westbrook, Pat Bev, Rui Hatchimura, JTA, Wenyen Gabriel (Maybe DeMarcus Cousins??) !!! 💥💥🔥🔥
Great highlights. Now go stand in the corner and wait for Lebron to pass you the ball.
Start this nigga tonight
Poor isaiah stewart man…
Three former wizard on the squad now that had some good chemistry when they were together looking forward to it lakers💪
Please do a Kobe Bryant video on January 26, 2023
One key thing people forget is chemistry. Rui fits perfectly. Has chemistry with Russ & Thomas Bryant. He also can plug into the starting lineup. Also can replace lebron when he gets tired. Bros young & has a lethal midrange all around gam, as well as defense. Essentially lebron doesn’t have to guard the best player every possession. Rui is a great switch off screens & he can make his own offense, smart player & can give ad a safe guard for rebounds due to his athleticism
Rui and Thomas can also hit 3s...playoffs  here    we come🎉💯👍
Welcome home
Moi je pense qu'il va s'adapter au Lakers car elle connaît du monde qui joue au Lakers en lui souhaitant bonne chance vive les LAkers
Lakers need 3 point shooter
What about Thomas Bryant? He already fit in
Lakers robbed the Wizards with this trade
I think the larkers will win it all if they make more trade they made a good trade right here they need to trade jta Daniel and maybe pat bev and 2 first rounders for at least 2 more good shooter and we need to sign big boogie we will win it all i promise
Content
I highly recommend you guys go to 2:07 😮
💜💪💜💪💜💪
0:52 *_"KONICHIWAA!!!"_*
Glad bunn is gone dude was trash
Ruiiiiiiiii MY GUY!!! FROM🇯🇵
LeBron would feast in the pick and roll with this man. Maybe he can teach him playmaking too.
If I'm correct, before he was traded, like maybe the last game as a Wizard, he had a 30 piece. So the Lakers got lucky
Hachimura going to bech only🤣🤣🤣
He tough good move
Please don't forget how to play like most people who come to the Lakers.
What on earth are the wizards thinking lol Good for LA
Golden Hoops don't miss
THE OLD INTRO IS BACKKKKKKKK
まさかここが個別にまとめるとは思わなかった。いつも見てます。
Let's Go!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Thats a great pick up westbrook and bryant are rui teammates before so they had a little chemistry aldready
He is a very solid player as well as Thoms Bryant, who can play inside and outside. I cant wait to see he play with AD and Lebron!!  がんばってほしい！！
Man Russ, rui, and Thomas those 3 gonna have some good chemistry together just like back in Washington
Dennis Reaves Lebron AD Thomas Bryant Russel Lonnie Rui Christie Gabriel maybe go after some shooting Mathews from Houston and more help at the wing like  Crowder
Bro is not a 3-point shooter or a defender, we're going full lob city at this point. Screw shooting.
LeGM making moves
Who did Jeanie or Pelinka blow to pull this off
He be balling too
9th pick
TB Russ reunion
Lmao wiz players switching to lakers 😂
My opinion he had a good year when West was there 🙇🏽
I hope Rui learns a lot from his great teammates and plays an active role
Great pass by  Avdia
They need the Fkn 3pt shooter God dayyyymn
Now the lakers dangerous
Welcome to the Lakeshow 💪🏽💜💛
This man needs to starttttt
if im not mistaken i dont see him on the roster
I'm Japanese and Laker. I love this trade.
Black samurai
Next up: PAT BEV TRADE SOON!
Rui for Nunn and 2nd round pick of the Lakers.
Lakers and Wizards have been helping each other get nowhere for the past two seasons
レイカーズだと8が着れない😅
lebron type player
Lakers goin deadly
RUI🇯🇵🇯🇵🔥🔥
エグいです！
Is he healty? If he's, is a good trade
The Los Angeles Wizards
Nice move Lakers
頑張って欲しい
Wizards payed back our debt
Lakers have 3 ex wizards: Russ, thomas Bryant, and now rui hachimura
they got half of the wizards roster by now💀
OK.We're ready.
Wait…he banged out twice on Isaiah Stewart? Lol he don’t like buddy 😂😮
You know whats amazing when players from other team get traded to the lakers or warrior they performance better
Good to see he got beef with Stewart too😂
I think he has a beast mode type resurrection… he’s a west coast guy felt out of his element in dc
What players goes to wizards???
Russ and Bryant were his teammates in D.C. so that they will be good team
I can’t believe the nba actually made a trade this season n it’s a lakers finesse? Playin n playoffs finna be crazy this year ong
The meat riding is crazy hahaha
It’s a good movement but I still thinking that they could sign some shooters we need shooters
I click fast to see what we got ...
Japanese nigga.
Japan japan sagot sa kahirapan 🇯🇵
legit ?
Just imagine getting kuzma instead of rui 🤣🤣🤣
Russ TB RUI🔥🔥🔥
am sooo excited😍🤩
Why this commentator say Konnichiwa every time Rui does something?😂
He can’t shoot well, nor is a a defensive specialist. Doesn’t help the team one bit. Just bringing Japanese fan base to the lakers, money motivated move.
Let's GOOOOO LAKER SQUAD
Good move
After Rui dropped a 30 piece the other night I knew he was gone. Ball out Rui wiz fan here gonna miss u
Man total fleecing!!!!!
Welcome to Lakers Ranidel De Ocampo
This is exactly what I was looking for. Seems like a decent pickup.
Basically stole 3 from the wizards so that connection will come in clutch
LAKESHOW !!!
Did we just witness a robbery by the Lakers?
Bryant and Westbrook had to want him…hood pick
Yo, FOR NOTHING? WUT?
🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🫡🔥
hes gonna see thomas bryant in la
This awesome forgot TB and Rui played With each other same with Westbrook.
Huge improvement. Lakers are now a force in the west!
Now here’s the question 🤔,now that he is on a team that wants to win like the lakers, will he be making plays like this along side lebron and AD or will he just shy away and not contribute and just stand in the corner and watch
Lebron wanted him because he dunks on Stewart all the time
loved this kid at Gonzaga
Hoping he can stay healthy
ridiculously disrespectful highlights, mans literally just put random ass clips of him making layups smfh
*Dunks on Isaiah Stewart Lebron: I need that guy on my team!
giannis from wish
I like him. I think he's going to give fresh air to LA
No idea how you're able ot put these together so damn fast.
Get rid of LJ
Rob Pelinka actually did his job for once yay!
LeGM back in the office i see
Golden Hoops once again with another banger.🔥🔥🔥

レイカーズでも「コンニチワ！」聞けるといいなあ
The chemistry already with Russ and Bryant, he’ll blend right in!😤
Finally a young player lmao
wow Lakers front office actually did something.
OMG!!!Thank you Golden Hoops!!!🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵

LeBron James  Anthony Davis  Russell Westbrook  Thomas Bryant  Rui Hachimura  Josh Richardson  Dennis Schrodder  Austin Reaves  Troy Brown Jr. Daniel Gafford  Anthony Gill  Max Christie Daniel Oturu  Wayne Ellington Scottie Pippen Jr.
6th
すんばらしい
I think this might my new favorite channel 🙌🏾
4th - 6th if AD stay healthy
Rui will be a good player for the Lakers. Great video again Golden Hoops.
Who'd the lakers trade Rui for?
good for chemistry , russ rui an TB used to play together really well
Russ has fui, brown jr, and Bryant like AD said “ teams fear us” and they do💯💪🏾
rui posterized stewart twice, im crying 😭
It chemistry as well TB, RW, and him all played together I believe
They will play in play in although at least will make  it to conference final and that is A GUARANTEE 💯 😉
The fact he postered Anthony Davis and couple years later he gets traded to the lakers
GOLDEN HOOPS
Too quick
I know HTB is happy
八村！！！
I am a fan of Golden Hoops ❤
日本の宝^^
What did Isaiah Stewart do to him 😂

From one to ten, where do you put Deni avdija?
What seed will the Lakers end on ? 🤔
Welcome Rui to Lakers 🤘🏻
All we need is another center and a knockdown 3pt shooter and we’re good!
