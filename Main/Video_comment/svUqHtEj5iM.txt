Leicester city have a stronger midfield than man utd what is solkjaer doing he sold lukaku to keep goal shy Martial why does keep Van de beek if he is not playing him he let Leicester buy Soumare while still having ndidi  united need a  solid quick DCM and a goalscorer  utd have spent all this money but they cant keep a clean sheet they need to install Varane and a quick strong centre mid soumare was the man but ole let Leicester beat him to the signing.for only 17m him and camavinga would cost less than declan rice  and utd  rarely conceded  goals

GGMU
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

I feel soo proud that I recognize nearly everyone in the video.. 2 years of watching football had paid off..
No
3:04 Don't mind me, I just made my own repeat button.
Manchester United Going To Win The League 😎😎😎
Sheffield United have a better chance at winning that man utd have
I would rather Sancho over Haaland tbf, look at their agents
Why everyone is saying that Sheffield will win PL. I’ve seen it over insta also.
Barca is the best
GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED!!!!! GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED!!!!! GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED!!!!! AS THE REDS GO MARCHING ON ON ON!!!!!!!!!
Liverpool should be the top

You forgot to put jesse lingard in the video 😂😂
Dean Your favorite club is Man U 😆. Well Ronaldo's part was funny 😂😂😂.
Hi
dean is man.city fan confirmed
Live pool will win 20 times  no doubt .
Its too early to say that
Sunday will tell if United are real or not, I believe City will win it.
Dean, stop predicting something that might happen in future, you already spot on with Pochettino and PSG.
Why is martial angry when united celebrate 3 : 09
My money is on Manchester                        City too😂😂😂😂😂😂
Go Manchester united
GOLDBRIDGE!!!!!!! : UR A PRAT
I am a man city fan and my money is on man city
I will stop watching football if that shit happens in Premier league
Yes united can win the league
Has anyone spotted how Bailly and Martial celebrated in the winning the league scene? 😂
let man united fans be happy but i do not think they will stay alot in 1st place
The best moment 3:11 when bruno takes the trophy from maguire
Their are not going win the league not going not going to win the league    liverpool are going to win
i think man utd will flop their lead in the prem beginning from next game like spurs did
Ole's is at the wheel
Hahahaha
0:05  I feel Klopp's pain   But it can all end when Liverpool face them.
Well atleast Dean is back to "My money is on Man city"
Man City are going to win
Liverpool will win don’t worry man united will flop again
There are so many wonderful references in this. Brilliant.
glory glory man utd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
everyone in 2021: we are on top of the league yaaaaaayyyyyyy  sir alex: what's all the fuss bout in my day this used to happen all the time
Manchester City will win the league
Me too Manchester city
442oons are clearly huge Man U fans, especially dean
Let's see in the end of the season I  bet liverpool will win the premier league on your face united
No chance for man united to win the league
Can you do amad Diallo first day at man United
Omg every team has dropped it’s going to be man city or Liverpool
3:04 After Sheffield United won their first game in Premier League
Meanwhile Klopp wants Penalties😂😂😂
Liverpool is gonna win
Yay Manchester United glory man united
...aaannnddd Dean’s officially jinxed man u’s title challenge. SIUUUU
As a Liverpool fan Bruno > De Bruyne tbh
No way they are gonna win the league. It belongs to Man City. They have 2 games in hand which brings us to 2nd place of we win both.
Letsgoooo
Ramos and red colour 😍
No way man united will never win the league
how in the world is, of all teams, man united on the top of the league
Now Paul Pogba is really better than hazard
Bruno just took away the trophy from Harry 😂😂😂😂
Make it stop! dear God make it stop!
City will win premier League.. Eventually.. All hail man city
Let's see if they will beat liverpool
Watch them go down to 8th at the end of the season.
No way  for man u ,liverpool will win the league and champions league too
Thx for listening to my request

#21isComing
Chelsea will win the league 💙
NOTHING   ABSOLUTE NOTHING   Dean prediction: Man City
Glory Glory man United ❤️
Were gonna lose to Liverpool Were gonna lose to Liverpool Were gonna lose to Liverpool Because we are man u
But you said in the manchester is red derby video that Man United are back and will win the league this season.
Klopp you know the next match is Liverpool v Manchester United So win and we back
Liverpool when beating man utd next match : WERE GOING TO WIN THE LEAGUE!
Why is Martial angry?
Barnsley are more likely to win the championship playoffs than Man U are to win the prem
I still hate Olé
The mark goldbridge
No they won't
Anyone with a brain know its still way too early to cement it in stone. Man City are coming
I like pep optimism
West Ham is east London you idiot😂
Dean is a united fan
This will age well...
Chelsea win the league
As a United fan it would be great to win again.... but its too early to tell, hopefully united will keep their form and improve we might just win
If man u sign ronaldo. THEY GUARANTEE THE LEAGUE IN THIER HANDS
0:04  2:10
To united fans glory glory Man Utd

As a United fan I've been waiting for this moment since the Brasil World Cup series
Man United are still shit!
Not for long
I am a liver pool fan, this is devastating
Come on new go to the latest edition of frontman  series
I would love Ramos to come to United he’s a world class defender and he can actually defend
You have to admit the Sergio Ramos thing is so funny
2:17 Totally Agree with Pep People ACTUALLY think Manchester United Will win the league When that happens Elizabeth Will be dead
I just uploaded a UNITED vs CHELSEA video on my channel! ⚽️😂
Like if I must join utd
Glory glory man United
Plot twist: Pogba played well in a zebra shirt cuz he thought he was playing for juve
No Liverpool all the way
You wont stay too long #Ynwa
Where's Donny
the only reason pogba is playing good is bc he thinks he's playing for juventus
Next vid about Donny from the Bench?
nooooo
they are going to do a spurs. they are ahead by a point
3:08 I know they are animated but I just cant wait till the 17th to see how well that will age
Until whenever they play Liverpool
Top 4 from a man u fan 1 Liverpool 2 United 3 city 4 spurs
No
City could be on zero points and dab would still predict them
1:46 legendary quotes . never forget that 😁

“Our fav colour red” 🎶glory, glory, Man United 🎶

1:47 reminds me of the commentator when Fernando Torres scored against Barcelona in UEFA Champions League 2011-12 Semi Final 2nd Leg
mmmm my moneys on man city LOL
Why does Dean love man city so bloody much
Yessir We going to win the league
Would love to see us win the league. I have little hope though as there are better teams in  the league than us. Still though anythings possible.

Man utd are going to bottle it
Yes
Dean's money is on Man City.  In other words, sky is blue.
i think it will be cool if Ramos really go to MU
As a Madrid fan, that Ramos sequence scared me
Liverpool will win
there is more chance of fulham winning the league than man u
Man United Fan Here
No
Of course man u fans think they're gonna win the league just like spurs 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ the league isn't even 20 matches in

amen
Pep killed me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I like the first part
Glory glory man united😂❤
Man utd are gonna win the league
Love the loSs Art
The Ramos tho.
I think man united will genuinely win the league as long as Bruno Fernandes stays fit for the rest of the season. Plus, they don't have any Champions League games to worry about
Tbh Ole isn't getting backed by the board just like Moyes, Van Gaal and Mourinho
Hopefully we do win the league🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤
Liverpool should of divided there 7 goals against crystal palace wisely
If United will win the League, I'll dye my hair RED
Liverpool's  will win the league

HELL NO CITY WILL WIN OR LIVERPOOL OR SPURS
Dean you should do a AC Milan version if you want.  I know the Seria A is not that popular like the PL I will defintely watch if you do one. This is just my opinion.  PS : I love your videos
Sorry I'm a utd fan but we are not gonna win the league I just know

Ole gunnar believe us
As a United fan I’m proud of the club being on top of the league, but at the same time it’s too early to celebrate, so anything can happen
1 week later Liverpool trash ManU
Sancho is dolph ziggler😂😂

Nice to see all the Man Utd fans that have suddenly popped up out of the woodwork 😂
I have to say that the mark goldbrige is class
Man  Utd
Was that champagne
i just puked all over my cat at that last bit thanks
I feel like Man United Will choke and everything will go wrong, they crash out of the Europa league in the round of 16, They lose top 6, Get knocked out of the FA Cup and Harry Maguire Will save them from relegation in the 21/22 season...
Why is Martial so pissed at the end
No Liverpool are again
'Feckin mental'

0:08 So true though FFS

YEAH MAN UNITED WILL WIN THE LEAGUE  🏆🏆🏆
whenever 442oons makes a video on someone winning the league they end up outside the top 4!!!  ha lol
Were gonna ein the league
When you noticed that the whole premier league is losing to a PE teacher.
Ole Gunnar Believe Us is a great line
Man United are celebrating too early...
Arsenal will win the league
Dean's  favourite 442oons characters in order  1) Ronaldo 2) Suarez  3) Muller 4) Neymar 5) Klopp 6) Messi 7) Zlatan 8) Mpabbape 9) Kane 10) Ramos 11) Mourinho etc...m
Yes I am a man United supporter
Man untd will play Liverpool and be to happy and think they are gonna win the league and the will lose 1-3 and Liverpool will win the league at the end of the season and man city 2nd Spurs 3rd everton 4th Man untd 5th
The best midfielder since Paul Scholes . If only Pogba was a bit more Roy Keane like . We would win the Champions league also.
This vid was so good I watched it twice, great job Dean👍     PS: Just a friendly piece of advise here, I think you put your money on the wrong Manchester club😉
Ole is the rescuer of Man.Utd and Jose is worst Man.Utd manager ever

Liverpool FC will win the league always 🏆🥇 We will see👍 You' re never walk alone🏅 Manchester United will never win the premier league again 🖕 We will see in anrfield
Manchester United must go all the way to win the league
If Man United becomes the champions, Will Lingardinho win the Premier League or the Premier League will win him?
I hope united finally win the league glory glory man.united
You know, the elephant on the top of  a tree thing? We don't know how it got on the top and we all know it's coming down. You know😏
We will still bottle it

As always my money’s on Man City
Glory glory man United 👑
Ole: I am Ofsted  That hid me hard!😂😂
But, I'm a Barcelona Fan
when u had Mourinho and Moyes arguing where was Van Harsh?
Their top, who cares. They will be taken out in 2 days
Pogboom
United will not win the League i promise you
Be real this happens every year, I doubt they go all the way.
2nd for man u
1:05 Probably Souness should have said that.
Yet he doesn’t do it for Spurs or Southampton
This video gassed me up a bit too much
Mark goldbridge : prats
Loved that ronaldo part 😂
Yes 100%
Man utd :- celebrating as they are top of league Meanwhile Sheffield united:- celebrating as they have won their first match
Their manager helped man united to win champions league in 1999     Now he will help them to win the PL after 8 years with no success
like
This is my favourite team man utd of course they will win the premier League.
Who would have thunk it.🤷🏽‍♀️
jesus christ its only been 17 games don't get your hopes up
Mark Goldbridge one was just out of the park . Miss Ronaldo. Would love to have Ramos along with Eric . Just bloody killers with red on .

The earliest I've ever been🥳🥳🥳🥳
I'm a united fan and I still don't know how the fuck that's happened
Oh god! Sir Alex in Ole nightsuit!!!
Yes
Manchester United will win the league GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED
You can tell Dean is loving it 😂
Ахахахахахах, no!!!
Can you 442oon do a-z of muller.  edit: that would the the best video ever😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Manchester United are wors
I don't know why he hates Chelsea, Kai Havertz, Frank Lampard and Timo Werner.
Everton go top: no one gives a shit Man United go top: This comes out
I think man u will absolutely bottle it
There'll be a tough competition for the league between Utd, city n Liverpool..... But I want United to win, do I think they'll win, well I want them to, but I'm in doubt, we haven't seen inconsistent performances for a while now, if that inconsistency comes back then, it'll be hard for us to do so.....
glory glory man utd
They won't win the league    Liverpool will win it
Well. At least for a couple days you know.
Have fun losing to Liverpool!!
Man Utd top of the league but for one week cause Liverpool are beating them next wee 😂
3:26 He put his money to Manchester city again lol
We were saying the same thing about Everton and spurs  I never thought Oli will do a better job then josa
To be honest, i dont think man utd will  win the leagur this season  and if theuy didx i wouldnt mind nut it wont be good
0:22 They KILL me🤣🤣😂
0:35 you have annoyed many fans😠
Yh
I don't remember the Southampton version, or a version for the other 12 teams that were top
OLE IS AT THE WHEEL!
Pls win the league
As a United fan its just good to be on the top after so long. I know we will not win it cause still our defence is not up there. City and Liverpool have well rounded squads atm so it will be tight for the title. Atleast these performances give us a good chance to finish in the top 4 and maybe with a few more quality signings we will really challenge again. But it does feel good to be on top..
claim your ticket here before ole gets sacked
Micah Richards laugh😂
back to where man u belong
Get ready for off United get ready also ole put on jones
Subtitules in spanish
Haaland won't sign for United his dad's career was ended by a man United player and he is a Leeds fan
The won't win the league
GLORY GLORY MAN UTD GLORY MAN UTD WERE TOP OF THE TABLE
1:47 they had us in the first half. 😂😂
Not for long
2:40 Me, a Forest fan who thought we were gonna get a mention since we drew Man City in the round after ☹️
in my opinion the United second shirt is made to look like Juventus, to confuse Pogba
Claim your here before 1mil views
I still think Liverpool is gonna win, no hate to Man Utd or Man City
Liverpool HAHAHA 🤣🤣 they are shit 😠😠😠 without van dijk
NO.
Credits to ole, everyone criticized his management, they said that they have worst transfer window, came from spurs thrashing defeat. But ole overcome his criticism Ole ole man utd
1:44 West Ham are in East London not West London
looks like Ramos has a cold his voice is different 😅
Mark goldbrick
Yes man utd will the league
loooooooooool
For now Manchester United will be on top for now wait for them to start lose again trust me
Ronaldo 😂😂😂😂
Manchester City
I also feel like United will eventually fall away. This is coming from a United fan. But you know what, as long as it's a 2nd consecutive top 4 finish, I'll legitimately be happy, unless we come 1 or 2 pts short then I'll be really annoyed.
Man United were on top of their group in UCL, we all know how it ended
Man Utd 😂😂😂😂😂. I think i broke my rib when you said: My prediction is Man Utd. Liverpool will beat Man Itd on Sunday. Fergie is looking and crying😂😂😂.
No
Yes
Love you 442oons Pls keep posting such awesome videos
Glory Man United win to the Premier league

I keep on repeating the video we’re going to win the league if we beat Liverpool if not then we’re screwed
Yes
If man United win the league, they'll be the worst team to have won it
Ronaldo: it’s time to go “ home “    Dead 💀 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🤣
Liverpool: finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary     SPOILER: Man United will come out on top 😉
POV:Your Here BEFORE the 1st guys
As a neutral honeslty I just really don't want Liverpool to win it I'll take anyone else!
Dean: Who do you think is gonna win the league  Nobody  Literally no one  Dean: my money is on MaN CiTy
There are more chances of me getting hit by a plane then Man United winning the league
hey
Do i think United will win the league? Nope. Do i think Liverpool will win the league No. Do i think City will win the league? Nope. Do i think Chelsea will win the league? Nope. Who will win it? Sheffield of course
First
Man united will go back to normal after January because pogba won’t have gone he only playing well to get signed by someone else
Nobody:  Ronaldo: It’s time to go home
If not Liverpool then Man city. I can't see Man utd winning the league yet
