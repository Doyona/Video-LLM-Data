You must put a GPR stabilizer to keep that front end stable.
Do you like creampies darline? - evan

Honestly whoever designed these engines should have figured out by now that when the master link breaks or the chain in general brakes it will go through your case every time! Literally all you need is a guard! Figure it out
Is that a Pennsylvania plate on the new r6?
I am a new subscriber Feb of 2025, because you gave that dog a bone I will binge watch many more of your videos, cheers boys.
You should put sand tires on a stark
Buy a crotch rocket from every major brand and put them against each other

Take an R6 and jump it at least 4 ft
I seen a lot of experimenting in the dunes over the last 35 years and this is a good one.  That said, I think you have enough power there to step up the paddle size and cut. Ride on

I absolutely love these r6 videos! Although it is weird seeing an iowa plate in the dunes lol
r6❤
You toasted it the second you said you're going to take it to the dunes.
I'm looking to do this to a cbr 1000rr fireblade if anyone could help me with finding where to buy a paddle that would be much appreciated lol

Not sure if this is a music video.
so fucking cool
Yo, I need a fuel tank and a fuel pump off of one of those R6's. You still got any of those parts left over?
Imagine posting your motorcycle for sale, messaging people, maybe meeting up with a couple, and then yay finally someone buys it! You log on YouTube the next week and see your sweet baby that you just sold being absolutely SENT on some sand dunes lmao. I would be losing it but smiling.
lower gearing and less tire much better for the bike.
talk to elon he can take the r6 somewhere else
Have a new suscriber for long time guys.

The R6 should go on the dragons tail in the mountains. Tag cboys
ocean R6
Make it into a three wheeler
Come back and try Osmobile with that thing?!
Put the r6 in the mud
It never ceases to amaze me how wide the chicken strips are on some of these sportbikes.   I mean, do people even know that motorcycles are designed to be leaned into turns?  Even the Mini Cup series 5 year olds lack chicken strips on their tires, so why can't all you "speed demons" scrub your tires in?  Just drop in and take a turn for God sakes, just stay off sand and oil or wet pavement, don't grab the brake, and you'll be fine.
The 07' Yamaha R1 that I bought brand new kept knocking its valve guides loose every 5k miles like clockwork, never making it past 16k miles total.  And yes the warranty repaired it every time, thanks Yamaha... I guess... with new head, piston, ect.  All to no avail cause its a Yamahahahaaa, designed to complete a 1000 mile race, maybe... and not much else.  Needless to say this stupid American will never own anouther one.
I'm I the only one who see prime
i just love how you go buy a new one like it nothing

Ryan should buya new qwad
Surya Mulk indexed with number 67, number of verses 30  1 Exalted is He, in the hand of His power is all dominion, and He has power over all things.  2 It is He who created death and life, to test you as to which of you is best in deeds.  He is the redeemer, the forgiver of sins.  3 It is He who created the seven heavens pair upon pair.  In the creation of the Merciful you can't see any contrast, so direct your gaze to see if you see any cracks?  4 Then, from time to time direct your gaze, and the gaze will return to you humble and humble.  5 We have adorned the nearest heaven with candles (luminous stars) and made them archers against the devils, for whom We have prepared a very great fiery punishment.  6 The punishment in hell is also for those who disbelieved in their Lord;  what a bad place it is!  7 When they throw themselves into it, they will hear its roar and it boils.  8 "Out of anger, it is almost torn apart. Whenever a crowd rushes into it, the guard asks them: "Didn't a prophet (rebuking) come to you?  9 They say: "Yes, the Prophet came to us, but we refuted him, and we said to them: "Allah did not reveal anything, and you are only in a great loss!"  10 And they say: "If only we had heard and remembered, we would not be among the dwellers of the Fire."  11 So they confess their sins;  may the dwellers of the fire be far from mercy.  12 Those who fear their Lord without seeing it, for them there is forgiveness and a great reward.  13 And you, hide or speak your word openly;  there is no doubt that He knows what you hide in your hearts.  14 Does not He who created know, when it is known that He penetrates the depths of secrets, knows the details.  15 It is He who has made the earth suitable for you, so walk through its parts and take advantage of His blessings, for with Him alone is the future.  16 Are you guaranteed by Him who is in the sky, that the earth will not shake you when it trembles.  17 Are you guaranteed by Him who is in heaven, that he will not send against you any storm with showers of stones.  Well, you will understand what My punishment is like!  18 Even those before them lied, but what was My punishment!?  19 Did they not see the birds above spread their wings, and when their wings are folded, they are held in the air by none but the Almighty.  He is the one who sees and knows everything.  20 Who is that army of yours that will help you but the Merciful?  It is true that the disbelievers are in a great deception.  21 Who is it that feeds you, if He cuts off His provision?  Nay, but they persist in arrogance and aversion.  22 Is he better guided who walks upside down with his face to the ground, or he who walks upright on the straight path?  23 Say: "It is He who created you, gave you hearing, sight and understanding, and you thank Him little"  24 Say: "It is He who created you and multiplied you on earth, and to Him alone will you be gathered!"  25 And they are saying: "When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are true?"  26 Say: "Only Allah knows that, and I am only a reprover who informs you!"  27 "When they see it (Hell) approaching them, the faces of those who disbelieved become ugly, and it will be said to them: "This is the one you sought as soon as possible!"  28 Say: "Tell me then, if Allah takes my soul and those who are with me, or has mercy on us, who will protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?"  29 Say: "He is the Merciful, in Him we have trusted and in Him alone we have relied, and you will understand who exactly that lost one is!"  30 Say: "Tell me, if your water is lost in the deep, who will bring you surface (spring) water?"..

Find a way to get it on a glacier 😂
Go to Montana and ride in the Rocky Mountains
R6 swap that POS banchee. You know that would be insane. Or put an r6 in one of them 1000 3wheelers in the garage.

Y’all should lift the r6 and put it on mud tires and take her threw the pits 😈
Yes I can smell the wet clutch inside the sealed transmission case. All the way to my keyboard.
Mudding in some thick wet soupy mud
wow
“Don’t let him park anywhere man”😂😂
Supercross next
Hey!! The second bike was my sons!!
Yamaha makes some fine machines. I've got a 1977 Xs750 triple with 175,000+ miles on it, I've put over 110K of that on myself. I've never opened the motor up, it's been great since day one. every major highway in the continental 48, half the dirt roads in the high desert and western plains of Oregon, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho too. shaft drive, big triple, just eats it up. I laid it down at 65 in the dirt off the freeway in North Florida last year, took me three days to get back up, but it ran like a top even after that. had to get new bars and lights and gauges, but the engine guards did their job well. helluva bike.
hmu ill detail the rv lol
Pls do a Suron video plsssss
Take the r6 on an mx track
The final test would be to drive it on water.......obviously. 🏍💦
Now do that with an R1 or better yet....   TURBOBUSA
1:00cool！
Water r6
Yo you barely even showed the bike horrible videos
R6 to the moon!!
Water 100%
Water
Can I have a dirt bike just like you and your other bikes

Great
Do a straight up dirt bike track with ramps and jumps  😝  (give the suspension a run for its money xD)
EVANS A SLEEPY HEAD
Imagine you sell your precious baby r6 and see this video😂
Rainforest
Marsh lands with the track on and maybe dirt bike front tire buy like a rear fatty help float front end and need to fill up the forks spacing
"WATER WATER!"
"we have too much shmoney invested in the this tire"  *Buys another bike"
Try this on lava surface 😢or try this bike in mout ka kua..
No offense, but Ken looks too “healthy” not to grocery shop…

NEXT TIME  🍒🥒           ,,R1"  👀💪
Very nice vedio

If you cannot install a master link properly not only squid   but you shouldn't be around a motorcycle
CHANNEL SHOULD BE CHANGED 2 R6
for the record that shower door should have been plexiglass
glad to have found this video. ive been curious to whom had the wild idea to put this bike through all that.
Should have pulled the chunks out of the case and JB welded that sucker up. It didn't need to last that long.
I would love to see you guys test the Honda monkey's capability.
I work hard everyday 6 days a week and can’t afford a bike I would love to have one
Water
Can't you just fix the R6?
I loved that old lady. So full of life❤
2MIL BABY
Chain drive a io on a boat or airboat? That would be different
R6 submarine
You guy's are bringing a whole new meaning to the motor bike sports.

Dude is just ripping on endless glass
Came for the bike, stayed for the vibe.

Has this rider ever had a bike he didn’t ruin the clutch on?
Do an easy unload
snoow
I wanna go to slab city!? Thats my style!
Nice
the main guy is so ugly, i cant believe jews think they can get away with pretending to be white when its so obvious they arent
Dude has hills have eyes vibes
Omg how did I go through life not going wide open on anything on dunes? Wth
Bro how come I never did this with My ninja?  ..... “because it’s dumb?”
Take it to littl Sahara
Do you think about the damage you leave in this cast-wide open landscape? I don't think so because if you did, you would destroy the dunes' beauty.
Hill climb it with all the built climbers
Love the R6, but perhaps buy a different and arguably better sportbike like a 636cc ZX6R or GSX-R600 instead of the R6 multiple times. Still a good bike with suprising results. However you did buy the best gen R6 this time which I like.  Edit: Or maybe a GSX-R750 or a 1000cc sportbike.
Bro that second r6 looked so goddamn good it hurts my heart seeing her like that
This poor discontinued series of bikes
my dads got a mercedes sprinter u reckon i can convince himm to get that mod
R6 to the MOOOOOOOOOOOON!
So many videos of guys using street bikes for dirt bike stuff but nobody extends the front suspension travel and the bikes just always plow and struggle. All this modification just to limit the performance? doesn't make sense.
Water skipping the R6 NEXT!
I got one for sale ??
😂😂its always a black guy name bj that one black guy 😂😂😂 i love this
Bro!! Im with ryan im not going mess around not have a ride
The  trip  is best and  I'm so enjoyed
That unemployed friendgroup on summer break.
@laboiserie @neurchi

You blokes don’t respect machines. Some people can’t afford nice bikes and you destroy them, not good.
fckin Dummies 🙄😒
Australia
r6 should go to the swamp
That’s fucking hilarious that dude wasn’t even really yelling at him

R6 mudding??????????

Moon
Friend + RV = Fun  But what if you don´t have friend?
Love it
If the sand is cold things handle better, as far as stability because it doesn't sink as much.
This is final test best of luck 😂
The R6 should go under ground
The master link goes a certain direction
Ha! I knew it ken sits down to pee😂😂
Have they done snow yet?
I would love to see the r6 on water 🤙🏾
salt flats
I never seen this channel or any of their videos but I learned that white boys got money to blow and a lot of free time lol
I use to own an 05 R6 Raven about 15 years ago and it was such a good bike. I miss it.

Have you tried it on a mud track?
hmmm idk.. the r6 is actually pretty finicky when it comes to wrecks... id say next time go with an 05 06 636.. and you wont need to buy one each time..  one bike will do ( at least mine was.. i dropped and crashed that bike so many times and it just wouldnt stop)
I'm getting a bike
they need to get a 1000
I love going to glamis so I’m so glad u guys came here

Clicked for the R6 in the dunes.  Stayed for the slab city humanitarian efforts.   Awesome thing you did for those people
Make it go under water please please 🥺🥺
At least one dude got a BJ from Darline….and if they didnt it’s a fail
Water skip obviously
Y’all should buy a Honda gold wing or Harley street glide and off-road it
Drive the r6 with an airless tire
Water!!
Thinking motocross front forks be helpful and high rise handle bars...
Stop fucking up R6's please 😭
Nice video and verry good
R6 on air!
In the fire
You've run it on frozen water but not regular water with skies  .🤪
good video
R6 submarine?
Clickbait bullshit. What paddle tire in the dunes? Non stop childish talking is all I saw.
Go kart it with some PVC pipe tires or see what it can tow with the truckers idk if it's bin to Alaska it can  be tracked some how I could figure it out so you can 2
Can I have one of the fucked up R6's? Lol
Imagine taking it to olds😳

Hello From Brasil

I came to see the bike riding the dunes. All I saw was talk talk talk. I left.
Bring the r6 to Ohio next
I've had 3 R6's, one a raven. Never broke anything except the clutch(my fault as a beginner), they are really awesome machines on road. And OBVIOUSLY off road also! Great stuff boys!
Convert into a jet ski.
Loved the Dude who scared Evan in Drivers seat that was hillarious.
You were saying that there's nowhere left to go this is the last test etc. Someone else said try on water.  But what about something more practical, and where people are. Wetlands/Marshlands, places like that could be fun and might help ppl getting around better... Who knows? Hope yinz try it. Peace.
Water with wakeboard for front tire.
That looks so fun!
I need that exact motor for my bike lol I blew mine up
Yup guys read my mind u should definitely put it on the water
R6 on Lava. Should be easy in 3rd gear. Just push it. Should try it on water before that.
Put it on water
You gotta get er in the mud now obviously.
Put a ski on it and fly
Don't get me wrong I love the R6, but would you consider doing it all over with a KTM Duke 790, it would be perfect for it and you could compare them and see what works better. Maybe even start making your own wheels as a brand. Even a 390 could be fun.
Man you guys are having too much fun, lol, I  had to watch the video,  because I was looking at a Yamaha Vmax,  and said need to find a knobby tire for one of them and take it trail riding.  Keep up the ideas.
How many people are going to do this? Three other channels already have! 🤔🧐
Hill climb is next
It would be dope to fly through sahara and the camels be like😱
why does all the r6s have one head litgh that does not work.
How to destroy a chain 101
“Rocks is basically asphalt” lmao great quote 😂
Haha that's y u burning cluch u gotta shift stupid 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can’t believe this went on the sand at all it shouldn’t be possible with that front street tire
Evan is the boss broo hee does the impossible y'all need to keep more on the camera
next video SALT FLATS
take it to Coeur d'Alene
Where is your flag that you need to fly to let others know when going over and around the dunes? The flag is for everybody's safety.
Take it to the............. MOON 🤘🤘

Hydroplaning, definitely hydroplaning
Love that Roster tail looks fuckin badass… put wings on the R6

Bros got stank feet. If anyone has to make that many points on the RV getting nasty, then DOESNT take his shoes off and goes onto the shower shattering! Bahahahahahs, am I right? He got some scooters?
متابع من العراق❤🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶
You should mud bog that R6 with that paddle tire.
Volcano
Stay stocked
I don't think this is how Carl Yamaha intended the bike be used when she invented the R6 three years ago.
when every i watch the cboys i dont move the vidoes are so good but they only post onces a week
Why is shipping so expensive to  Canada ! My boy really wants a hat !
anyone notice cboys hit 2 million subs
Evan belongs on the r6 and its perfect size too😊
R6 three-wheeler

The fact that the title was about the bike and not giving to the people in slab city..... says a lot of good things about these guys moral character.
Let even be in the thumbnail

From here you get it set to run on water like a snowmobile can. ;)
CONGRATS ON 2MILLION Boys!!!
You guys gotta take the R6 parachuting and using the engine as a powersupply for the propeller!
You guys need to do a hill climb with an R6
Not making him do push ups or run or get naked and be covered in h oney and be stung by one million bees over the chain..is just rediculous.. thats why everyone should be checking everything. and should have changed the handle bars
Poor r6 :(( Still a great video!
“hey guys welcome today we are testing the r6 on the dark side if the moon”

Hey handsome
Maybe you should turn it into a plane or a helicopter like you can land it then go once you land
Moab is nice, but  it you want a really challenge  I suggest you take that on the Rubicon and ride  the entire trail.
Rider did that shit on purpose. He had to have. It's pretty obvious that he'd x veteran rider.....so without a doubt he knew the bike was getting to hot and was fixin to go on back to the shop .

Flagstaff the cinders $100hill lol
Sea doo that Bichhh 😮
I'd chalk that up as a waste of time and money and waste of a good bike!!
you gotta take that thing to some dirt drags with that paddle tire
That's why the mechanic always test rides what he does 😁!!!!! Imechanic I always test driver test ride and a machine before I put somebody else on it they could possibly kill them . If you're on the road that happened at 150 mile an hour you'd be f***** 100 mi an hour yeah get your s*** together
These guys have destroyed 4 r6s and I don't even have 1 😢   awesome content though... love the vidya... send me the r6 with the case cracked from chain..... I'm a welder I'll fix that mf

Great to see you guys going out to slab city! That's just a few miles from where I live in North Shore, Cboys in the hood!

Poor Gen 3 R6, so much nicer than the Gen 2 killed by its chain 😂
I can't enter any of the giveaways because my Nan won't let me 😭😭😭😭😭
That shot where he gave the old lady flowers and a pack of smokes should be used for a Christmas/greeting card. Priceless.
Congratulations on 2m!
that was awesome!! I had a banshee with a r1 motor in it, that thing sounded so amazing running wide open up a dune valley at the Oregon dunes. and it being a quad with 26 inch rear paddles it was like riding a giant comfy couch that will kill you. lol
I think water and mud for that r6
2 million lets go
take it with just wheels and paddle tires when you go snowmobiling next year
Water
R6 might be best thing ever made if you have unlimited funds to buy more 😂😂😂😂great day

I don't know who these guys are and I'm 12mins in on this video and I salute these fine young men giving back to those who can benefit from it! You guys are amazing and thank u for being so kind in a world filled with so much evil and hate, God bless u!
Ok. You got room for a 60 year old stud puppy Harley Guy plus a 25 year old Heritage Softail Classic on that next trip. I know a couple "friendly ladies" if you catch my drift we can visit along the way...😁 Just f**king with ya. Lol. I subscribed just to see what you boys are made of. You ever climbed a 1500ft vertical freehand? I didn't think so...Sugarloaf Mtn, Maryland. Then 110ft jump off of Berkly Springs, WV quarry. Saw a guy go head first once. Feels like hitting a solid object and it can kill you if you don't hit right. Show me how focused you can be at 1000ft with no chute, no ropes, nothing but your grip...you fellas might make it to my age maybe. Most of my running buddies died trying...Later Boys
You guys should all get r6’s and ride on the road
Definitely water skip🖒
C'est pareil que laboiserie ...
Puddle jumping is next. Maybe the paddle tire will worl
everything happen for a reason the new r6 is way better
Man cut out the when he dropped the beeer lol 14:58
Put the r6 in the water. Put on some floats and a big tire like the one you have on it now.
Make an helicopter or blimp out of it 😅
Smh rip R6
😂it looks so cool with Evan on it 🛵😊
You said it ! How about a skydive with a water landing ? HA HA

As an owner of the same bike it makes me very proud to see these Yamahas beat on like this and still keep going I'm really jealous of the m4 exhaust though I would love to have one on my bike
RYAN it is good for you to be a part of giving back to people that are less fortunate than you remember people that are less fortunate then you buy your guises merchandise and give you the The life that you get to live without the rigorous 9 to 5. You were usually my favorite sea boy but seeing you not involved in getting back to people less fortunate made me wanna punch you in the face
please take it mudding
R6 PLANE 😁 or R6 boat/ski. I think the plane is more of a challenge
am i the only one that thinks ev joining the cboys was like one of the best decision
This guy has a nose better than a dog if he can smell a clutch that's completely inclosed in the engine.
How the hell do you screw up a chain🤦
Try it in a desert race.

Yeah this video is fire.
Giving things to people who are in need is one of the funnest most fulfilling things you can do, its literally a high comparable to some of the strongest drugs which I can unfortunately vouch for..everyone is different and it's not cool to judge but I have a hard time understanding how anyone could sit in the R.V. during that..I would've wanted all the puppy food just turn me loose and I'd have gotten lost in there

This is your reminder that Easter is about life, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and about why he is this and it was because we are guilty sinners that deserve eternal punishment but he loves us so much that he die a death that we deserve because of our sin and conquer death when he resurrected so that we could be connected to the all almighty loving God

What you guys did for Darlene and others in Slab City was awesome! ❤
If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior. How to be saved The ABCs of salvation X A - ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. B - BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD. C - CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD AND YOU WILL BE SAVED. Once you have done that then you are saved. Find a believing church get baptized and being baptized does not save you. Get a bible.
Ninja h2r better
R6 makes great videos
😂
I’ll take the old r6
since the r6 is fast asf, i think u can manage to just drive on water at like 150 mph and it would go so fast that the bike wouldn't sink

Cant wait to see the R6 float across the water and I feel like would be the person capable of doing so. Shouldn't be harder then riding in the sand surely. <3 Love the videos boys, keep it up.
You still gotta put 4 wheels on the r6 for the test
i really liked all the good you guys did in the slab city !! Big thumbs up for that 👍👍
put a water ski on the front and the sand paddle tire on back and water skip it
I wonder if it would fare better with a sand front tire as well. Probably wouldn't actually fit, though.

Track on the back, or paddle, and a big ski on the front. That r6 should definitely hit the water next.
Cboys will make the R6 the rarest motor in the world if they keep demolishing them at this rate🤣🤣
These road trip videos are the best
If you are a pimple infested motor head like me! And you think touching yourself sexually is a sin, and at the same time struggle to get laid with the opposite sex, (animals not included) then this is the channel for you. I get an average of 3 ejaculations per video, without touching myself or other assistance!  If the ejaculations do not occur, you are not a motor head, only a pimpled individual with a sexual problem!
Why is Ben always on the r6 in the thumb nail when it’s Evan doing all the ripping?
Yamaha R6 multitool LMAO snow, ice, mud, rock, sand, track... doesn't matter
Please waterskip the r6
you guys should 100% give me any of the bikes you dont want
next test is r6 water skip
Dude the second half of this vid is almost identical to one of Danny Duncan's videos. Slab city, climbing the tower, having the guy get into the RV to scare your buddy. WTF ripping off content now boys?
Make it a jetsky
You should do a hill climb with it 😂
Water water water water??????
Finding out that ken sits while he pees is not shocking at all
Skip it for sure
Glad you guys went back to the slabs and gave back to their community!

r6 3-wheeler
Needa start regearing when y’all put the r6 through stuff like this😂 they’ll last a lot longer with less strain on the motor
Do this on an R1 pleasee
You know what the people in slab city need.  A bunch of blue barrels to store water in. That would probably be super useful for them. You could also do a video where you run into them like bowling pins before you give them away.
Ken sits to pee.   Needs to be a sticker
Ryan handled that “prank” dude perfectly.  He really could calm a situation if needed.
You guys should try to keep this r6 mint
Talk to Elon, take it to the moon

Ken 100% has those selfish vibes lol but you could see he had fun at Slab City anyways.
One light out on the R6 as always
You should do snorkeling with it
Laguna seca! Put Evan on track!!!!
You guys should take it to the drag strip and just build up speed every pass then run it wide open
Skydive the R6 or water skip it
You guys have to make longer videos. I say this because you post once a week. I feel that it will make them better. But other than the video length, it was a funny video. 😂
Why are y’all not sponsored by Yamaha yet😂
Needs a Robbie Madison ski and send it out into the lake, if it works ocean waves are next

Y’all messed up going to glamis y’all must not know how people there are they get drunk as hell don’t give a damn about anything and they have some hard sand to get through that’s why they never bring a bike

🤫 just whisper, but just wanted to say…..   Water!
Put a snow bike kit and water skip it
R6 in the skatepark 😎
💧
But on water is the message here

Evan called it, you need to get a water kit for an R6, you have seen the motocross video riding waves haven’t you! R6 in Hawaii anyone???
Mabey do a race on the dirt bike trail or on the dunes
I like how Ben has to get the glory of being on the bike in the thumbnail but he’s not even the one who rides it ….
Please do a ride out in upper Michigan again
This is a thought maybe just maybe you guys should go to an actual track
For sure do water Boyd. Next week here in mn there will be lots of water
I want to see dat rv flying on ramp
A little kindness here and there would change the world.yous guys are great
Mud,snow
r6 trike
Boys that case was smacked hard lmao put the paddle tire back on that R6 and send it to the moon booter but wait until the snows gone so we can get the spring or summer shot of it flying 😅
start of 5:23 sounded like a freestyle
you should take it on an mtb jump line
SNOREL IT AND TAKE ER DEEP DEEP
R6 takes on Pennsylvania Coal Region???
Next could be a jetski
Weld 1 ski to each front fork, so you got 2 skies on the front of the r6 with the new paddle tire.. it'll water skip and handle good I bet any money.
Get the back wheel off and put a 90 gearbox and propeller and a paraglider wing on and take to the sky 😂
Mud bog the r6 love you guys, from Manitoba Canada

The absolute fact this thing is still alive this has to be a record for the biggest dumbasses to keep a bike alive 🤣🤣

Does the small dude have a YT Channel of his own? I like content featuring him.
I love your videos it is lit🫡🤪
You are the best.
13:49 perfect cut
Take an r6 to gold creek
You guys should gear the bike lower to fix the clutch burning up and throw a better fan on the radiators and go back to race people on their sxs’s
W for darling this is wat Ryan missed out
hey Cboys I need your help I'm 10 and 5'3'' and need a dirt bike what size and brand should I go with.

Water skiping
duuude why do you have to keep destroying r6's? can't you use a kawisaki zx6r or something
I don't understand why you guys don't have way more then 2 mill subscribers. I got COVID and was on a ventilator for 5 months. Watching you guys got me through the worst sickness Ive ever went through. Come on people!! Subscribe to the boys!!
Niiice stuff, can't imagine what y'all would do with a KTM 790/890 AdvR!!! That paddle tire is w i l d, though a MotoZ Desert H/T rear might have been nearly as effective without serious modification to the R6. I'd love to see the comparison.
Ryan looks like hes in compton in 1997 sitting in Escalade
love your videos ❤
I'm sure these rv trips are exhausting but man, they're the best content from you guys.
Wjen u give people stuff they wont cit your head off ken and whoever is scared of that place. Grow up. They will be nice unless you run into a mental health patient. And the ppl there will take care of him.
Ken needs to grow a set
Hope evans getting paid more then the guy on the thumb nail Evan does more crazy stuff for the Chanel then anyone does
Evans the man.
The r6 needs to be a 3wheeler next after the water
Sorry i mean R6
Freestyle rap with the r six

Take the r6 to a ski slope
I saw that you guys were drinking prime and I think it would be sweet if you guys came out with your own type of drink I would definitely be buying your gusting drinks if u had them in store
Love the Iowa plate on the new R6! Representing a good state! 😂 Hope the guy you bought it from doesn’t see when this R6 breaks 😂
My drive way

New camera or something? Quality was already good but seems a little better
1:45  sorry you hadda see that XD
When you took that on the sand with that paddle wheel, you should’ve put a sky  on the front. If you take it on the water you need to put one big ski under that tire and then put the paddle wheel on the back and then take it on the water.
You should take the R6 to a mudding place
cant wait till i can do dunes
Great content boys, R6, the boys messing around, being nice with darlene.  Its a good one

Skydiving
Rainbow rail r6 😁
My grandpas friend rolled a razor and died in glammed like a week aho
You guys were at the most bad azz dirt ramps and dirt not scratch off the R1 bucket list ramp riding! Water skiing is on the bucket list for that R1. Ski on the front paddle on the back the perfect mullet bike. Mudd racing, already set up for it! Awesome video as always guys.
Why is ben always the thumbnail but he never rides the r6
Bro Ben! get off the rocket and let Evan get the thumb nail, shits triggering😂 atleast ride it in the vid pussy @ben
Jump off a cliff with a parachute

R6 three wheeler
R6 three wheeler
Water skip
Water skip the r6 then send it to the moon with a custom jump !
Gotta skip the R6 next
hate to be that guy but this is a recipe for disaster. No flags on any of the bikes and standing away from a parked vehicle. We go to the dunes every weekend over summer and have seen people get airlifted/killed because of the things listed above. When you think nobody is out there and you feel safe is when it always happens.
Cboys y’all should get him his own r6 that has a twisted tea wrap on it 😂
CLEAN ASS R6.........WAY TO DO WORK BOYS GOING AND GETTING IT ...
If you think the R6’s are tough wait till you get a Honda, it’ll be the last one you guys have to buy

Gotta do a full video collaboration with Raha 🤙🏼🤙🏼
Well when the day comes the r6 will be on the moon

Bros just trashing r6s gimme a wrecked one ill fix er

Ryan said everything right 😂
Make a boat that the bike can strap to and get that back wheel with the paddle tire in the water !
Try run it on water like a jet ski
Is that @buttery films at 5:36
No way there was only 5 minutes of footy in the dunes. I'd watch a straight full unedited clip of the shit.
R6 never dissapoints
TAKE IT TO A MUD PARK PLEASEEEE
“Do you like cream pies”😂
Keep the paddle tire on the r6 but do snow next
R6 water skip
Next on cboystv, Evan takes the R6 water skimming!

“Do you like cream pies Darlene?” 😂

you guys should do a behind the scenes or vlog, it would be nice to see u guys looking around on marketplace, jus the process, it would be cool and funny to watch
The vibes were off this one, you can tell theve been in that rv a bit to long together haha
Next one go on the water like that MX Red Bull bike in Hawaii.
Hear me out I have a great/could be bad idea, r6 tuned up and put to the test on the salt flats
Evan handles the r6 like a beast idk how he does it

Best episode in a while lads. Gotta say I'm not a fan of that trike guy, Garth or Gary, whatever his name is . This lineup is all you need!
R6 jet ski
also 1st gear ends at 55mph lmao
I think you should get ahold of other manufacturers' 600s and see if the R6 really reigns supreme. CBR600, GSXR600, ZX-R600 any and all crotch rocket 600s
Jump r6 off cliff and with aparachute
Noww race it in dunes with plumbing co
i feel so bad for that 06-08 r6 XD
R-6 paddle boat that's where you go from here!! 🤣
NEXT TIME YOU GET A NEW R6 GET A KAWASAKI ZX 6 R😊😊😊
R6 water skip would be epic

I love you videos you should water skip the r6!!!
You’d think the way Evan rides the r6 his balls would be the size of Ken’s!  You guys should get your hands on a Polaris slingshot. It would be awesome to see a snowbike kits of sorts put on a slingshot
Nah yall need to buy that rv😂😂
12:06 Someone has to stop Evan man wtf😭😭😭😭
You guys should rent out one of those sphere things were it closes and have Evan ride in circles in it
I heard those gifts for the ppl of slab city came directly out of kens paycheck 😂
CJ looked grossed out to hug Darlene😭😂
The next test to do is sky diving with it and build a backpack parachute to it . But the driver has to stay on it and be the skydiver
Water pls shout me out big fan
Water!!!!
Was that buttery on the freeway in the srt???? @butteryfilms
You should get with Grind Hard Plumbing.they put dirt bike forks on a Busa.i think doing that with the R6 would make it a lot better for the things your doing with it

Put a lift on the R6. Rally style.

Crazy awesome vid ,love you guys keep it up 😁

For reference you can weld that case up for next to nothing and the motor is still perfect. I’ve ran 3 in race cars that were deemed junk from broke chains
Already got the sand tire for the water skim!

The Moon
Next test should be to have a motocross rider take it on a motocross track.

To be honest I like the new R6 better Sik vids boys
Evan is a absolute savage!
Hi
I BOUGHT MERCH
That’s awesome you went to see raha absolute legend that dude is the sickest guy on two wheels . Raha needs 1millie subs
Man I love cboys and Raha. So unexpected but so needed!
3rd time a charm
MAKE IT DO WATERCROSS!
I am so pissed that I drove to Vegas and all over the states through cormorant and was like this place sucks drove through Yellowstone west came home watched your guys videos and come to find out I drove literally by your house probably and didn’t hit you guys up or something
You ca tell the guy they asked to be mean, barley had a spec of rudeness in him. Can tell he’s a good hearted dude
The R6 should go to a good o'le MardiGras muddfest. 😅
Good vid boys
Run across a lake
Water skipping forsure...
R6 water skipping video would be epic
You should water skip or bring it to those hard trails you were on in Idaho
Idk if the R6 is reliable or crap at this point
The r6 needs to go to gold creek
One of my favorite videos to date
Snorkel it and send it through mud holes
Tape line😁
Guys, I think you should help out Darline even more. That was so awesome and she loved those flowers! and the smokes lol :)
I hope there is another separate video of Ev just killing it at Raha's compound.
Ken doesn't look very healthy at all.  You should go get checked out big Ken. Good luck
I need to see your friends who made the side by side jet ski make Evan an R6 jet ski!
Waterskipping with a snow bike kit😂

Waterskip the r6
Snow
I sit when I pee, Ken...I'm not trying to splash little bits of pee all over the floor and toilet. It's just more mess to clean. Standers are barbarians.
Do you like cream pies Darlene
I know evan is the best rider but you guys should also film the others ride too, not just evan
Ok this ones doable, Pikes Peak R6 run
Lmfao I'm stoned asf watching this , and they guy that scared Ryan was ruthless lmao I have never laughed so hard. Ryan himself , is now a humble guy 😂😂😂 I bet he gets out next year 😂😂

I agree with Evan 😂 you guys should take it on the water!!
Ev your a wicked man asking that older lady if she like cream pies 🤣
mud racing and then water skiing edit: do harley with paddle tires
Cboys and Colby raha collab is gonna be 🔥
You guys need a featherlight nascar hauler and a semi tractor for your trips it would be a lot better.  Plus you can bring race cars.
Comment for support
I love the cboys but why isn’t Evan ever in the thumbnail on the crotch rocket when he rides it ?
What happened to the r6 quad
He says the R6 has might be the best bike ever made. is that why they've had 4 of them😂
R6 in mud baby
You should drive it on water with snowtracks😂
God do I love this channel, CJ was making me die the entire video.
I’m starting to think they are using Evan for a test dummy 😂

Under water r6 snorkel??

Why is Ben on the R6 in the thumbnail? First it was his fault the other R6 got destroyed and second he didn't even shred it. Evan should be the thumbnail not wussy a$$ Ben
