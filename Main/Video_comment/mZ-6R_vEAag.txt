Isn’t kinda like dance dance revolution?
*subscrie do joyn the colt of juck manfol*
That's what the door looked like-! Pog
Why is no one mentioning how high the door handle on Tommy's door is
My last two braincells trying to make coffee
No
Stop cutting out the wholesome parts!
rekrap2 did this it is possible you two just didnt try hard enough
If anyone says “FNF but Minecraft” I’m going to HYECK
3:28 Asian parent vibes fr

DDR POG (the arrows from the thumbnail look like fnf lol
*OmG ItS FnF In tHe tHuMbNaIl!11!1!1!11!!!11!!1!1*
I love the sign outside toms door
Their bickering makes them so siblingly lol
Did no one realise Jack is wearing a Tommy shirt hahahaha
Jack tried to out-child tommy, and he took that personally
1:05 Tommy you are not annoying
Who’s here at 1.99M subscribers in 2022?
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 🥰
this still doesnt compare to beating minecraft hardcore with a steering wheel
Jack: *enters room* *sees Tommy with glasses on* Tommy out of nowhere: "I love bitches" Also Tommy: "MY LAST DOSE OF SERATOTIN"
Ive realized smthin Im always curious about jacks and tommys heint. It turns out that jack is shorter than tommy
1.99 subs
When your friend said subscribe I subscribed
I like how the arrows are made in friday night funkin in the thumbnail
Frdy nigh funki
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16❤️
it looks literally like fnf but minecraft
Am i the only one who noticed the word tom on tommys door with like child letters
You can really tell the height difference here 😂
1:40 Tommy it didn't work, he still only has 1.99M subscribers
I ony like tommm cu he
i can't believe tommy called jack inbred
This is just me playing minecraft on phone basically lmao
Why are Funkin arrow in mineraft
Tommy has so many more subs-
jack AHH AH WERE GOING BACK WARDS tommy: mr beast is doing ice cream-
the arrows from the thumbnail is from friday night funkin. You should play it
Not enough room at his own house toms room it that size of the largest amazon box
Wait is that a tommyint
The thumbnail video is just like you play Friday Night Funkin with your legs
Before I watched this I just watch dreams video where 3 player’s control one body and it made this 10x funnier
I’m just gonna ignore the FNF arrows in the thumbnail
IN BREAD IN BREAD IN BREAD😭😭
Tommy's door. LMAO
"We tried beating Minecraft with out our hands but we can't its impossible." Technoblade: Hmm...
Inbred
Haha, baldman talk, funny
the thumbnail for this video is hilarious XD
It reminds me of when I played Zelda botw with my friend on the switch she was the movement man and I was the looking man
THE HIGHT DIFFERENCE I CANT-💀
MAN WHY WOULD YOU USE THE FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN ARROWS FOR THE THUMB NAIL BROOOOOOOOO
There was a dude who beat the ender dragon using mouse, keyboard and his feet
They used to dance dance revolution mats-
7:12 was he using antiperspirant as a body spray?
friday night funkin
I think you are playing Friday night funkin in minecraft (The arrows in the background)
Do they know fnf cuz the arrows are from fnf
Niki literally beat Techno in pvp once, idk what you expected
Why is the thumbnail friday night funkin
Is it just me, or was Tommy a whole entire mood in this video-
Techno beat the game using a steering wheel-
I legit watched this for the 2nd time and realised I wasn't subbed
Sad Boi
they got the ddr pads with the fnf notes, now whats goin on here?
It's hard
Wtflip
this entire video is “YOU TRY IT THEN”
I like how to thumbnail is dance mats or something but the arrows are fnf
9:06 what song is that
4:37
Why does it feel like Jack kinda forced Tommy to record
9:39 *Fundy dancing intensifies*
Tommy’s T O M sign reminds me of the time that my dad rearranged the letters on my door to say toilet (my name is Lottie which is an anagram) 😂
The " T O M" on Tommy's door it's just- so Adorable.
OMG TOMMY HAS A HAMILTON POSTER
I subscribed
"Generic white boy"  Me: *stares intensely at brother and his American flag on the wall*
6:27  Jack: *struggling* Tommy:…….     Tommy: *purrrr*
Best duo ddr ever
I like his door
Jack I have an Idea to literally scare your friends this game named Specimen Zero so we can laugh at gak and tommy and this game is absolute funnier I even laugh when I play this the first time  Download it Gak,tommy,you,George Made by Cafe Studio Download it pls  #SpecimenZero  I won't stop saying this if you don't download it and your really funny🤣🤣
Why are Tommy's eyes red?
"sorry i dribble" -tommyinnit
hi
DID YOU GET A WHOPPA?
rip jacks toe
i feel like everyone is glossing over the fact that tommy has “Tom” spelled out on his door
Iste this duo is too good 😆
1:05
I love this duo-
Can I have that wooden hand...
"jack goes in Tomy room* Tommy stand there* I love (beep)" XD was also damn funny
This is like watching someone play minecraft with a Nintendo with joy con drift.
Oh yeah, gonna be a funky night because I love my.

ok tommy i subscribed
i liked it when tommy screamed inbred
''pov: ur new to friday night funkin and dont know how to play''
my mom just died and my dad just went to go get milk anyways cant stop that jack manifold grind
Finally, a dream smp player that noticed fnf
When new people first play Minecraft:
Teamwork makes the dream work.
Lol
i-
my Friends keep saying i look like you. i am really into mcyts so I'll give it a try.
returning to work
Technoblade did it with a steering wheel needs
When the friday night funkin hits
Pls play fnf
Now we can see their height compared everytime
"I don't care I wanna go back to college" probably the best thing I've heard all day.
I only subscribed because of tommy
Jacks thumbnail arrows loks like from friday night funkin
I just subscribed😳😳😳
techno: am i a joke
Tommy: joe Jack: joe? Tommys mind:  *JOE MAMA*
what the hell is wrong with you, its funny
I just realized how short Jack is
* me about to unsubscribe “idk why”* *fells a gun on my head* Jack:…no….
Minecraft manhunt/speedrunning with dance mats anyone? (•̀ᴗ•́)و(•̀ᴗ•́)و(•̀ᴗ•́)و
Tommy:*makes eye contact at the camera*    Me: SHARINGAN
Friday night funkin fans be like: hi kapi
it worked Tommy made me sub ;3;
⟟ never thought tommy could be calm
yall forgetting techno trained niki to pvp right-?
Me seeing the thumbnail:      *ah, Minecraft Friday Night Funkin’?*
Tommy and jack struggling with a dance pad Techno: pathetic
Is it just me or did I think they were going to play fnf
The subscribe bit actually worked, I subscribed.What kinda dark magic is this?
jack you almost at 1.78M subs
"bread in bread in bread"             tommyinnit  2021
0:13 nobody: Tommy’s eyes: 💚❤️                This comment is a joke so dont take it seriously
I am probably gonna try
Tommyinnit Mr.Beast fan confirmed
Lol Tommy’s door has colour full letters spelling tom
tommy's aries really showed in this
FNF
Duh duh
Tommy: Next time you fuck up Jimmy Beast comes out! Jack: Congragts Jimmy Beast!    This literally made my day-😩
Why is this me when I try to Speedrun a world with my siblings
It’s the height difference for me
5:33 is tommy ok? did he die?
imagine theres only the facecam. You’re welcome
Please tell me that Tommy’s room door actually has the letters on it
Hahaha so funny!
When is jack gonna play fnf?
Lol
The fact that the first thing tommy did when he almost gave up was watch MRBEAST is just amazing
Not Tommy being like a foot taller than jack 🤣
I subbed
Best vlog ever i swear
Jack in this video is acting like Keigo from Bleach.  Also, I bet Dream and Technoblade together could beat the game like this.
Tommy: "I practice kissing on this."  Everyone: EWWWW Me: HOWWWW
AY IR WAS JACKS BIRTHDAY  YESTERDAY,
Anyone else just here from the 4 key thumbnail
Tommy helped me realise that I wasn't subscribed to Jack. Thanks Tommy.
Do u have a disc server i can join?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Tommy sitting down while Jack hoppity skipped everywhere to save themselves made me laugh so much
Ye I agree
Look at the deodorant sene and u will see the unit deodrent
i want nothing more than to vacuum that carpet
nooo not Lynx Africa on the Schlirt
The fucken foam T O M is wonderful
They were fighting like there brothers it was so funny 🤣
This is what pocket edition players had to do
Walmart version of Fundy’s playing minecraft without hands
That's how it feels to play minecraft in phone 😂
What is the thumbnail They are playing With Dance mats Or playing FNF
“STOP WATCHING MR BEAST” 😂😂😂😂😭
I’m mad, he combined fnf with dancepad games.
why did you use the fnf arrow???
0:16 is everyone gonna ignore the fact that TommyInnit's eyes look red?
Anyone thinks how cute the sign named "Tom" at Tommy's door
This is like watching my logic part of my brain and my creative part fight while playing Minecraft...
HUH FNF POG OMG THUMBNAIL FUCK POGCHAMP
Look at the height difference 😂😂
Tommy seems considerably pissed off/annoyed, he isn't laughing as much or as energetic.
QWHY DOES TOMMY HAVE AN ED SHEERAN POSTER- SSJSJSJJJSJSKSJKJSKSJKJKJSKJKSJKSJKSJKSJSKJSKSJK
this turnend to kapi ddr
motherinnit when tommy was saying "keep going" in his tired voice: 👁️💧👄💧👁️
wait does tommy have an ed sheeran poster
It took me 3 and a half minutes to realize there was a pad cam as well
its like your playing fnf
The screen while they were telling us 2 subscribe: *you spin me right round baby right round like a record baby*
so much undertale music...     I LIKE IT!
I’m proud that tommy has a Bruce Springsteen poster 👏🏻
NOT TOMMY USING MR. BEAST AS A THREAT WBJDJA
what is the music at 4:15 called
0:17 Gosh Tommy, you have anime eyes? Thats nice dude.
Tommy why did u force me to subscribe :(
I thought this was gonna be Minecraft but with the FRIDAY NIGHT Funkin mod
I swear the thumbnail made me think they’re playing FNF
Am I the only one who thinks Tommy’s pupils were red in the beginning of the video O.o
me and tommy has same shadesssss but mine in yellowwww
*Tallmeinnit*
They might pvp if the adapt. Like, they manage to hit Niki 3 times
Everyone talking about the TOM sign and things, but I just noticed the height difference
Ddrcraft
a DDR champion: are you sure about that
“Because your annoying- at first” “T A K E  T H A T  B A C K “
;]
Is nobody else talking about Tommy’s door? ⟟ literally love it 😰
tommy had so much power
Tommy saying subside WORKED YAY
If tommy and jack played on controller
0:08 TOMMY ED SHEERAN STAN???
Why did it look like Tommy’s pupils were red
Are you tapi from fnf now
5:40... funny but also ಠ_ಠ
Lmao the arrows on the thumbnail look very familiar 👀 maybe some game that involves dancing movements during an evening on a Friday?
First person do you play Minecraft no hands oh no that’s actually fundy who set up a voice control
They play like I play when I’m on PlayStation.. it’s not looking good for them 😂
Jack: **trying to play** Tommy: Mr Beast went to an ice cream-
Tommy and is unneeded random facts about himself 😂 and then the silence
Omg I have that hand lol ✋ it's from IKEA
So now we have to see tommy jack ranboo and tubbo play Friday night funkin.
he should make a video meeting up with Gakmaster in real life with tommy
Ngl the thumbnail look like fnf aka friday night funkin
the height difference tho XD
Please go bald again💀
who tf knows the arrows came out from fnf how frickin crazy
Quick thing but is it just me or do Tommy's eyes just seem dilated all the time? Maybe it's because I have really dark brown eyes and can't see my pupils but his pupils seem really big-
Hello I love your videos plus you have the same bday as me so early happy birthday 🎂.☺
BREAD BREAD BREAD B- wait… I’m sorry
Day 1 of asking Jack Manifold to make a grindstone house
congrats at youtooz
wheres Gak

Minimum Jackafold
I saw you you would tell Bojack manifold in my dream you guys are out of amusement park you were quiet Happy Jack Metabo was a little grumpy cuz the ride wasn't working
im sorry but the TOM sign on his door proves how much of a child he is.
the only time auto jump would be helpful
Where is GakMaster
Jack: you are the most generic white boy  Tommy: is wearing schlatt merch
Haven't slept for a week but can't stop the jack manifold grind
ah, the mani-ass, also can be called jackass
ok now i know who was the other guy from tommy's old channel
Jack Manifold won't see this there is a 1% chance but, a few days ago or like 2 days ago my mum took me to burger King and I got a whopper.
0:17 tommy gets drugs Look at his eyes
Hello  Mr.Thunder1408

I was so annoyed when tommy just sit there watching mr.beast :)
Friday Night Funkin
I love how his hand is just constantly positioned to flip people off.
I like how Tommy’s door is little baby toys saying Tom
Ali-A is that you?
So chaotic 😭
Georgecamehome isnt in the video!?!/?!??!/!
That Tommy guy is funny, he should make a youtube channel
Bye Jack. Youre so funny.
Hairs growing
The height 👌😩
jack: has ddr dance pads thumbnail: fnf arrows for some reason
Maturing is realising that jack actually is fucking funny ;D
https://youtube.com/shorts/uRvzfxTSZHY?feature=share watch this guys and jack if you see this watch that
The Mario music in the beginning really set the mood XD
imagine but the notes are fnf
Tommy and Jack: *Tries to beat Minecraft on a Dance Pad* Techno: *Beats Minecraft with a Steering wheel*
The fact that Tommy's room has crooked foam letters that say T O M  is just wonderful
Tommy: the last dose of serotonin  Me: girl in red
The best line was “ you know what *stomps foot* inventory”
just realized that I haven't seen the whole room till this video @_@
I'm pity liking.....
Jschlatt music.
Remember when stampy played minecraft without touching his controller?
if it say subscribe ok *subscribes*
Sibling energy
0:06 "TOM" 12 yo Tommy prolly wrote that
Alright, next friday night funkin using dd-  *this comment was removed by jack. reason: non-releated*
Kapi plays minecraft irl be like:
Lol i have the same ddr pads on my room rn XD
Fnf!
This is for u  Read till the end! I sent an angel to watch over you last night, but it came back and asked "why?" The angel said, "angels don't watch over angels!" twenty angels are in your world. Ten are sleeping, nine of them are playing and one is reading this message. The universe has seen you struggling with some things and says it over. a blessing is coming your way. If you believe in Karma send this message to 14 friends including me, if I don't get it back I guess I'm not one of them. As soon as you get 5 replies, someone you love will quietly surprise you... Not joking. Pass this message on. Please don't ignore it. you are being tested and Karma is going to fix two big things tonight in your favor. If you believe in Karma drop everything and pass it on TOMORROW WILL BE THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. DON'T BREAK THIS. SEND THIS TO 14 FRIENDS IN 10 MINUTES IT'S NOT THAT HARD. WHOEVER SENT THIS TO YOU MUST CARE ABOUT YOU  Just hold your finger on it n it should say forward
3:53
Wait... Try nyaw
"You can't play minecraft without your hands" Georgenotfound: 😐🦶

0:11 - jack was right, he is a devil child- HE HAS RED EYE PUPILS DK:38472msnsksms
I love Niki! That’s the comment
Fnf on a thumbnail
Is anyone gonna tell them?... no?.        *the thumbnail is fnf (friday night funkin)*
try not to laugh with badboyhalo
"hehehhehuh hey hot stuff" gives me flashbacks...
BIG NEWS!  I spent tons of time, pouring over all of the songs in the Dream SMP, and came up with the Top 40 for the first year of the Dream SMP.  Enjoy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMH8ruTpMd8
he is short but great.
I like the chaos
Oh no tommyinnit is making you popular.
Fnf viewers be like
When jack said he wouldn't be using his hands, I fully expected a very... different... video...
Oh wow fnf in minecraft but not rapping only controlling with the arrows    Edit: what the fuck did u call jimmy or mrbeast u called him jimmy beast *puts uno reverse card*
make tommy vacuum h8s carpet
Cool
1:33 unsubscribes out of spite
why is his carpet so dirty...
At 3:46 Jimmy beast comes out
EHAT THIS IS EPIC
JACK PLAY MINECRAFT ON ANDROID HEHEHE
Why does Tommy's door has kids stickers-
is that an ed sheeran poster
Kapi: oh sh*t, why?
DID U GET WHOPAA
MonkaW
The real challenge is the teamwork
Why is no one talking about the infamous "I practice kissing with this"?
i sub becose of tomy
I don't think I've ever seen Tommy more quiet than in this video, I feel concern
manifold is way much shorter than tom and hes older than him
tommy really didnt want to do this video huh
6:27 did jack just toot?
I subscribed.
Its just the next challenge after techno's steering wheel challenge
The hulking amusement unquestionably escape because popcorn explicitly offer on a annoying argument. callous, interesting sparrow
7:23 TOMMY’S FACE LMFAO
YOU GUYS SOULD PLAY FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN
What about stampys foot challenge
you see bloooo right
WHY IS THERE AN ED SHEEREN PIC IN THE BACK OF TOMMYS ROOM LMFAO
Wowwww
FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN AAAAA THE NOTES IN THE COVERRR IS FROM FNF
are we not gonna talk about how tommy said inventory...
TOMMY HAS A HAMILTON POSTER IN HIS ROOM OM
That foot can tho…👌
Jack: you can't play MC without your hands, TechnoBlade: Is that a challenge?
Does anyone remember Stampy playing Minecraft Xbox with his feet?
hand clicks, foot stomps ok...
I laugh when they say something but they die I will  lol
THE FNF THUMBNAIL IM DEAD
INBRED that bit cracked me up
How me and my younger brother play mincraft:
Jack is so annoying
If they went up to kapi sheesh they'd probably lose because for sures I know that cat is good at dance pads
Lol
I feel like this video exists because Tommy played Minecraft with that massive keyboard and Jack felt like he had to one up him with a larger one
7:15 whiteboyinnit?
We're watching
0:08 TOMMY WHY DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF ED SHEEREN
It the guy from fortnite
...why does tommy just have a hand in his room?
WHY DONT YOU ADMIT ITS FNF
YO I HAVE ONE OF THOSE WOODEN HAND THINGS TOO!! I use it to flip off anyone that walks in my room.
The amount of Jshlatt merch in possession of Tommyinnit is considerably awesome

1:55 mama
'T O M'
In this video Head Manifold and the Child will play Minecraft in a Dance Mat that IS CRAZY

I didn't read the title properly and cause of thumbnail I thought u had dance mats IN minecraft :/

Ammata

Anyone reminded of Technoblades Steering wheel run but worse?
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
what was the name of the song played at the outro cuz ik the rest was undertale but idk the last song when the video ended what that was called
Technoblade did it with just a steering wheel. I bet he could do it with no hands. XD
Friday night funkin
fnf fans on their way to call dancepads a reference to fnf
Niki got lessons from the blade
TOMMY AND JACK PLAY FRIDAY FUNKIN              BUT THEY PLAY MINECRAFT
I thought he said without a hat 😀
This reminds me of when Techno tried to beat Minecraft with a steering wheel.
no one: jack with his hair me: c a i l l o u
1:40 "When you click it, you're in. For life." Me: sounds good to me- *clickity clack*
1:33 I subbed
0:17 *Tommy's eyes glows red in this frame* Me: *jazz music stops*
BHAHAHAHAHA
Females got all that smegma all up in there but they don't get cut, only boys get cut up when we babies circumcised because they assume boys ain't gone wash "down there" as thoroughly as girls do.
For some reason i thought they were going to pvp using the music
omg funky music game in minceraft???1!! NOT CLICK BAT`!!!!1
ig i’m subscribed for life now
Play Friday Night Funkin for a video
we all love the super mario galaxy music in the intro AND THE UNDYNE MUSIC?!?! this video is just too good to be true
Yes
Tommy: “Next time you fuck up Jimmy Beast comes out.”  No one: Jack: Congrats Jimmy Beast!
The wheeze at 6:26 is absolutely incredible 😭💀💀
ok i just saw that jack manifold is smol
7:16 generic white boy on generic white boy violence
7:01  Tommy sounds so American when he says fuck 😂😂😂
tommy: hates america and everything about it  also tommy: has a literal statue of liberty poster in his room
I would never unsubscribe Jack. The grind hits to hard
This may have been just me but when I saw the fumnail I thought it was then doing the twerk dance and it was called we did the dance mod
next time try to beat minecraft but ft dream and george
⟟ just wanna touch Tommy’s hair it looks so ✨f l u f f y✨
Omg tommy's door has his name 😅😅

Friday night tommyng
A bit off-topic and not important but: "Joe?" intense your turn to die flashbacks
Tommy has a “TOM“ sign 💀💀💀💀
mean while:*george using his feet to play minecraft*
I didn't even realize there was a camera for the dance mats until Tommy sat down
Jack: Beating Minecraft without hands is impossible.  SB737 Has Entered The Chat
Not them fighting 😭😭
LOL, awesome video mate! :D
"We are the first ones,I think to beat Minecraft without hands"  Techno: *are you sure about that*
Tommy if you keep moving y'all won't win it isn't just jack winning both of y'all are
7:12 the most generic white boy
.
FNF be like
Lmao the arrows from the Thumbnail are from Friday night funking XDDDD beautiful
9:22 music please
TOMMY IN THE BEGINNING🤣🤣🤣

the pvp was the best part
JIMMY BEAST GAY|?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
i just like how tommy has tom on his door
Try out dance mats, it's the new steering wheel!
It’s like watched left brain and right brain
7:16 “THERE HE IS! THERE’S MY FAVORITE WHITE BOY!”
Uhh no tommy is a monster his eyes is red
the old/new fnf 0-0
Jack said that it's impossible to play minecraft without your hands... welp technoblade proved it wrong
0:09 is that an Ed Sheeran poster in the background 💀💀💀
Friday night funkin Minecraft 🧐
The thumbnail: *basically the Minecraft skins the mat and a fnf thingy*

0:17 why do his eyes look so evil
hi
DID U GET A WHOPPA?
PLS-
I like how the tumbnail is them both playing FNF but in reality: weird minecraft thing

Tommy is Mr Beast fan confirmed .
Just them, having anger issues.

They forget that Techno gave Niki one-on-one PVP training. She's deadlier than she looks.

JACKMONEY VERY LOVE DANCING
This is what it’s like to play bedrock
Jack Manifold: You can't play minecraft without hands  People without hands:
The hight comparison in this video is just 👌
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY

Tommy with a phone is so like a child
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY
https://youtu.be/qwLpv0vmYTY
Why do tommy so tall and jack is short
Tommy... not slouching???
Random fact: If you flash a light on someones eyes (ex:taking a picture) and if their pupils have red lights from the outside flashing lights, they might have eye cancer (i think i saw tommy had one)
Did they move in ?
“You’re the most generic white boy.” LOL 🤣🤣🤣
Tom looks extremely huge and old compared to Jack but then Toms face looks like a 10 year old
Jaks face at 7:46 is just-
This is like fnf.
Hey Jack if you don't have a idea what to record we'll then you can play Friday Night it's like arrows up down left right it's like club penguin
Challenge Technoblad3 to do it
Fnf in minecraft

Lesson I learned today: Noone can be more of a anoying gremlin than Tommy
𝙸  𝚓𝚞𝚜𝚝  𝚞𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍𝚎𝚍  𝚊  𝚌𝚘𝚘𝚕  𝚟𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚘.... 𝙴𝚗𝚓𝚘𝚢
I love how niki just didn’t even crit them
The fact that I can play minecraft with my feet and found almost a stack of diamonds, built a house, and got all my necessities while doing so-   In one day might I add
LOL
AYOOO
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE LETTERS ON HIS DOOR LOL
Chainsaw dance
my brother and his friends played dark souls with dance mats 😂
6:06 why did jack start sounding like Tom Holland in the spider man movies lmao
Poor Tommy
0:17 why are his eyes red like thatttt!!!!!!. I'm scaredddddd
Now this is “teamwork”
Tommy looks good
This video is made for children YouTube!!
the dislikes are people who haven’t ever won the game with the mats
Me: Why does this reminds me of a Friday night funkin mod?
Watching this when it's 1 day old.
Tommy is an absolute mood during this whole video.
Love how people are complaining about jack when tommys the one making things 1 difficult and 2 not saying anything funny unlike jack at least trying and somtimes being funny cause it kinda difficult with someone who doesnt care.
I friking love you, Jack Manifold✨❤️ that's all that I wanted to say, bye🌼

This was terrible but A for creativity.
World wide weapon * Mr Beast Music inserts*

You are so close to 2 MILLION SUBS
"Sorry, I dribble"   - TommyInnit 2021
jack manifold " we are the first ppl to play mc without our hands"  stampy longnose like 5 years ago........ *plays mc with foot*

If you ever feel useless, look under the facecam.
You remind me of Travis from team fortress😀👍
e
the bee duo should try this
Fnf vibes yes
The TOM sign just says I am a child more then any of the dream smp
Didn't techno use a stirring wheel? So,he didn't use his hands either..sooooo
1:57 anyone else disappointed he didn't say joe mama? :(
Tommy: IN BREAD IN BREAD IN BREAD IN BREAD Jack: 👁 👄 👁  Tommy: I’m sorry

yo
Gotta love how there are fnf arrows on the tumbnail
Jack: yelling at Tommy for doing it wrong  Tommy: watching literal Mr. beast
Hey I have those
they are literally SO MAD at each other is hilarious.
Technoblade would probably beat this challenge easily
*I think we were the first people to play Minecraft without our hands* technoblade beat it with a steering wheel
🤣🤣🤣
Tommy is tall compared to jack
i subbed for tommyinnit lmao
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Omg it’s Kapiinnit
Tommy has his name on his door. I just took mine off, didn’t realize it was in style. 😘🤜
bruh moment
i thought it would be a friday night funkin gameplay ngl
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO PLAY FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN SINCE I SAW NOTE💀
Can we just talk about how Tommy has his name in colorful letters on his door
Tommy: *forward!* My mind: *forward march and here we go, members of the agency bakugo!*
0:06 TOM🧩🍼
This whole video is the definition of “mom said it’s my turn on the Xbox”
‘Trod on her’ -Tommyinnit 2021
Damn
This is so unique. Its actually awesome
I like how in the thumbnail he literally put FNF arrows like they were going to play FNF lmao
THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE!!
Your the most generic white boy. -jack manifold
Video thumbnail: *has Fnf arrows* Me: *clicks*
Lol they used the fnf keys
This would be a really funny thing for a stream as well
the little tom sign on his door and the "heyy youtube" pls my heart <33
7:13 the disrespect for Schlatts merch
Alternative Title: Tommy and Jack turn into Kapi.
You can’t do a team sport with a selfish person. Maybe try again with someone less selfish. Then decide you can’t do it. Tommy is not a good teammate to be deciding those things. Unless you wanted to fail and then bravo.
The title should be changed to "Tommyinnit and Jack Manifold arguing for 9:50 seconds straight"
9:21 I feel like this is a Deltarune theme But who's? it actually sounds good
My eyes: Ddr pads My mind: *haha beep bop bap*
this concept is actually so cool
they’re using Tommy’s minecraft account and just put Jack’s skin on
at 5:10 they both poggedat the same time
Jack: we don't have any food or shelter Tommy: making food as their in a village 👁👄👁
TOMMY WHY IS YOUR FLOOR SO DIRTY
4 liferssss
I subscribed thanks to Tommy u -u
OH **** FNF TOOK OVER MINECRAFT JUST LIKE IN THAT EXPLODINGTNT VID OH NO
Nobody: Tommy: I’m not annoying. Say it, say I’m not annoying. TELL ME I’M NOT ANNOYING. I’m not annoying, say it. Say I’m not annoying.
Maybe next time try to play with wii remote?
Imagine copying Basically Homeless and his dog
I have never watched a mcyt video since like 2012 but it looked interesting ok-

Why is it Tommy's Account but Jack's skin?

I like how it says Tom on his door
Can’t wait for Technoblade’s “beating minecraft hardcore with a dance pad”
wait jack manifold can code??????
t-tommy shut up
Hiiiiiiiiiiiii
Idk why but jack gives me “let’s do something stupid” vibes but at the same time he’s does it in a smart way or makes it funny. Like I love it
Why is jack soo smol compared to tommy
Why Tommy have a Plastic Hand wtf
It is so pleasing to me how the "CHOP" aligned with the beat in Spear of Justice at 9:04
JACKS #3 ON TRENDING LETS GOOO
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  I would also encourage you to pray to the Lord Jesus and repent to Him for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus Christ or otherwise if you don't repent to Jesus for your sins and obey what He wants you to do with your life then when you die you will go to hell.

For a second I thought they are playing Friday Night Funkin' using the dance mats...
This was painful to watch
Great video jack, loved it😄
Anyone getting pacific rim vibs
Im sorry jack but fundy was the first one to play minecraft without keyboard
Alternative title: Jack and Tommy fighting for 9 minutes and 50 seconds straight and maybe some of working together but mostly fighting
i spy with my little eye a spelling error            (serotonin, not seratonin)
If you go to Tommy’s house, you will smell like lynx africa

Therapist: Jimmy Beast can't hurt you. He's not real. Jimmy Beast: 3:55
Well.. George did play minecraft with his feet...on the mouse..

Tommy really sold the whole subscribing thing wow!
can Tommy do a video where he cleans his room bc I think it’s needed
i think jack and tommy is living at the same house toghether
where is the blade - this is his new challenge
Imagine doing the dream boat clutch on those
Is no one going to talk about the foam letters on Tommy’s door
7:42 I'm starting to think that Tommy a thing for mannequins.  8:19 "no one can do it". No one TECHNOBLADE
"You're... the most generic white boy." Me: ACTIVATE DREAM KETTLE MODE
surely im not the only one who thought theyre gonna play fnf in minecraft or is it just me?
5:41 TF is tommy doing XDXD
Everything about this thumbnail is wrong
jack struggling to play tommy peacefully watching mr beast
they’re using Tommy’s minecraft account and just put Jack’s skin on
Tommy calling Jack “inbred” should be in the best of 2021 comp
Today we installed the Gay mod into minecraft and stabbed each other.
Arcade dancing games in a nutshell
funkin' arrows
i used to have a verified checkmark why do i no longer have one smh
The fact that tommy has a ‘tom’ sign on his door makes me laugh
I love the poorly planned foam letters on Tommy’s door that spell TO   M
YALL SHOULD HAVE TURNED ON AUTO-JUMP JUST FOR THIS VIDEO
Jack : " *actually trying to play without hands* "  Tommy : " *angry child noise* "
The amount of frustration this video gives me is unbearable
Am I the only one who saw that Tommy had 2 different socks on :3
Ily king manifold
Am i stupid or did Jack move in with the big man
pro tip: get a hard pad so it does not move
Believe Jesus died for your sins was buried and rose 3 days later and you'll have eternal life and you can never lose it
ello jack
No cap or not to pour it on 😂 i refuse to hear that the era before me wasnt boring. Man wtf are yall listening to? Club Disney cant produce any man over 6 ft. Troy bolton 5'08 & mvp 😂 the dark skin aint famous in real life situations. No homo but i can expose your favorite straight celeb 😂 look closely for the manhood sacrifice. Told you he couldn't get away "scott free" 😂 Don't joke w/jason that's really his preference. "You're the devil the way you set people up. Have you running full speed into a Hard Screen 😂
tommy is literally the straightest man alive
(3:57) *"jimmy beast comes out" "congratz jimmy beast"* this moment had me WHEEZING omg and the fact tommy didnt get it at first- cherry on top
9:02 *perfect timing-*

The knowledge that Tommy has letters on his door is so funny-
Jack is considerably more annoying and louder than Tommy ....      How???

I'd actually love to see other people do this. It's kinda like the siamese thing that dream and George did a long time ago- kinda like the ultimate test of friendship and synergy and patience
I thought this was a normal YouTuber then I realized it was Jack manifold I'm not watching this
This was a godly cut 1:59
*Still don't know why he's saying dribbled instead of drooled.*
so were not gonna talk about the Ed Sheeran poster on Tommy's wall?
Why do ppl keep talking abt his "tom" sign on his door on tiktok😭😭 I thought a lot of ppl had that, it's not really a big deal loll
Mans tries to grow out his hair and people are calling him inbred, smh what a world we live in
This an exact representation of when siblings have to share the keyboard on the family pc

so what i'm getting from this video is that niki is better than jack and tommy COMBINED
why is tommys floor so god damb dirty🙄👏🏻
I like how Tommy's door just has the word "Tom" on it
Tommy: STOP MOVING Jack: YOU'RE THE MOVING MAN
"you can't play minecraft without your hands"  fundy and george  have entered the chat
i mean- you tried?
This was uploded tomorrow, hows the future? 😂 im in aus
Best original content
Jack is so small compared to tommy lol
A3ow
I LOVE THAT TOMMY LITERALLY HAS THE CHILDISH LETTERS OF HIS NAME ON THE DOOR, really embracing the youngest SMP member
meanwhile techno plays minecraft with a stearing wheel...
Jack also finds ways to impress us
Jack, if you go to the settings app on your iPhone and go to the camera settings, you can change the resolution and framerate. I suggest" 4k at 30fps", but since you usually upload at 1080p, I would suggest choosing "1080p HD at 30 fps". It would improve the quality of your videos, when using your phone. (btw this was just some constructive criticism. love the videos ;)
Just realized that Tommy has those Letters on his door...
Tommy are you good ? seems to be sad...
7:42    tommy-
Jackmanifall!!! 😀😀😀
Sound like fnf.. cool :D!
The Mat Gamers
Prediction:they lose

jack manifold is my favourite gaming genre
The fact that tommy gets mad at everything that jack does
Jack is that stress parent and Tommy is the chillest child
lol honestly really creative
How stink was Tommy's room
Can’t play Minecraft without your hands? Has he ever seen george play bedwars with his toes?
This video made Tommy look extremely tall and in turn made Jack, Jack Minifold instead of Jack Manifold
Omg wait I have that same wooden hand on my desk
Tiny manifold
Such 7 y old younger sibling energy from tommy..,,
Jack is a king
Literally the whole video: _Slide_ to the left _Slide_ to the right Criss cross! Criss cross!  Cha cha real smooth

i have a question for jack or any smart content creator. jack used, from my knowledge, the super mario bro's wii music (at least from my pov), and i googled and said it was copyright music. so if i want to add it to my music without getting copyright claimed/demonitized/striked, how can i do that without having a penalty? like do i ahve to cut the beginning/end?  please help me thanks
Jack looks just so tiny when compared to Tommy, I just can’t get over it

Congrats on #3 on trending Mr manifold
This video has the same energy as a team building exercise

Everyone’s talking about the dance pad but I now just realized how massive Tommy is
Tommy’s gonna get a whoppah
“I practiced kissing on this” tommy….
When you just realize Tommy is more taller than Jack-
He literally sounds like a child being sad and angry at the same time 1:59
Lmao Tommy sitting on the floor is adorable ♡
Jack:u cant play minecraft without your hands George: I dont know about that
i dont know about you but jack manifold is making quarentinie 100% funnier
This video took me 1/4 of the way until I realized there was a foot cam LMAO

This is what happens when you don't have a steering wheel.
the thumbnail notes sparkles
I always thought how much bigger Tommy was then Jack but chesus christ that's a huge difference
Are we not gonna talk abt how tommy has stickers of the letters in his name on his door

If they actually become pro's on playing with no hands I kinda wanna see them pvp with Techo or atleast someone a high level than Niki (not saying she's bad, she's awesome at this)
congrats jimmy beast 😌
*Its either* *Tommy being a lil brother and depending on his big bro Manifold* *Or* *Tommy being that group member that depends on leader Manifold-*
Friday night funkin arrows in the thumbnail, nice
The height difference gives me serotonin c:
This would’ve been easier with Gakmaster

Friday night minin'
Tommy’s so tale

Just realised that Jack looks like Ben Miller in Johnny English

Everybody gangsta until a dancing cat from an arcade challenges you with some beethoven songs
The letters on the door just completely break down the cool person vibe he acted as not a second later
FNF WHO?
6:40 when tommy uses more bttv emotes on youtube than he does on twitch
Tommy’s little “TOM” sign makes him look like the child he is
How Kapi plays all his game :
Tommy has his name on his door and it is so cute and funny
God this reminds me of Kobeni from Chainsaw man😭
Me after watching this video: Suddenly the Abnormally big keyboard doesn't seem so bad

DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE BIG ED SHEERAN POSTER TOMMY HAS???
Tommys learning how to get women
1:54 call me old fashioned but I thought he'd say Joe. JOE MAMA!!!!!! Edit: is this joke too old?
*WE ADDED THE EXERCISE MOD INTO MINECRA-*

I need a pvp of fundy using voice controls vs these two on dance pads
Most generic white boy
I love the tiny Jack rising up from the bottom of the screen at the very end, just being sad, that was awesome
“You’re the most generic white boy”  We been knew
This ain’t original
the first 30 seconds of this video is all I really needed today, the rest was just extra serotonin
*The height difference*
A bit off-topic and not important but: "Joe?" *intense your turn to die flashbacks*
I CANT THE HEADPHONES HITTING JACK GOT ME WHEEZING
today i coded so that me and tommy could play minecraft using dance dance revolution mats
The fnf in the thumbnail 😼
There feet are just so aggressive
i remember a guy playing Minecraft without hands or feet. He use some kinda brain thing so it detects brain activity and that controls the player so uh no they were not the first to play mc with no hands.
why is tommy so tall i cant do this no more GOODBYE-
I thought they were gonna play Friday night funkin 😥
The fact Tommy has his name on his door😆
7:42 NOO TOM
The tom on Tommy's door is exactly what I have on my door
Niki is just too strong for them
Only Jack could come up with this idea
Tommy's technique to get me subscribe mafe me e d you to make a pact with the devil for life 💀🧍‍♀️
oh my god this so dumb lol
NOT THE FOAM SAYING TOM ON THE BACK OF HIS DOOR
1:33 like jagger?
Dance Dance revolution
Those mats make me so nostalgic. In grade school, my PE class had us do the hardest difficulty on Dance Dance Revolution, and that was the unit
No one gonna talk about Tommy saying “I practice kissing with this” about the fake hand ????
Hi people from stream

This man is real? Holy moly.
This is absolutely chaos and I love it
all i want in life is a minecraft championship where everybody has a ridiculous hindrance. these two have play like this. technoblade has to use a steering wheel. fundy has to use only voice commands. george has the electtical shock thing hooked up. several people play in vr. call in minecraft championshit.

Friday night funkin 😃🤺
Okay but the letters on Tommy's door is so wholesome?? Like?? 😭 Aww
Everybody gangsta till the FNF community makes a jack manifold mod

Tommy with his name on his door 🤝 nearly every 2000s child

unfortunately george has already mastered the art of feet gaming! good effort tho!
Jack: And I’m gaming professionally, you know this is my job? Tommy: …I wanna go back to college.

Hi
the letters on tommys door
it is possible to play minecraft with no hands, georgenotfound did it with his feet 👹
why does tommy have an ed sheeran poster?
Its so cute that tommy has his name on his door
“Next time you fuck up, jimmy beast comes out” Fr tho, to all my friends, if you somehow make me bored, Mr Beast is gonna replace you for entertainment
NOT ED SHEERAN IN TOMMYS ROOM
6 minutes in there still at the beginning. Imma guess they don't ligetimently finish
WHY IS JACK SO SHORT JDJSHDHSK LMAOOO
Only Gogy can play Minecraft with his feet
Is the thumbnail a reference to friday night funkin?
Lol I was here when it was out for 16 seconds and I come back 2 hours later
that's pretty groovy baby
2:08 sorry what😭
Omg this is amazing
Friday night funkin moment! Lol
kapi manifold
It's so difficult they can't even turn this into a 10 minute video.
Me before I watch the video: *I bet this is gonna be hard, they’re probably not going to complete it*   Halfway through the video: *tommy completely given up, jack yelling at him, no food, no tools, everything despawning, mobs everywhere*
5:42 tommy when he twirk-
the fact that tommy has tom in foam letter stickers on his door just fits so well
the letters on tommys door remind me of reception class-
at 0:17 Tommy had red eyes and that kinda scared me
The foam stickers saying "Tom" on Tommy's door just shows the fact that he's still a 6 year old in a 17 year old body

this is now my favorite jack manifold video, gave me lots of seretonin :)
I just wanted to say that I love your videos a lot, not only for the content you do but also because you put subtitles and it makes it a lot easier for me to watch you!  I am a deaf person with Cochlear Implants, so when I don’t have my Cochlear Implants on I’m completely deaf and then I have a low amount of things that I can watch on YouTube and your one of the most people I watch when I’m deaf! :))
Tommy: “in bread.. IN BREAD IN BREAD”    *Jack stares at Tommy* Tommy: Wait……. sorry
i just realized that jack looks like the TF2 scout
Minecraft night funkin
This is great
Lmao seratonin and not serotonin. Interestinggggg
Joe?
I love how when Tommy got the fake hand it was set with the middle finger
Its 4 minutes in from the 9 minutes video but they are still just trying to make and have some food Thats really funny And also JACK GOT THE MOVESSSS
i honest to god checked the sibscribe button even tho i went to my subscriptions tab to find this i-
STOP WATCHING MRBEAST Jack Manifold--2021
I am not subscribed
They are good at teamwork anyone agrees??
tommy is just acting drunk this entire time lol
Imagine at the end they learn how to DANCE!!
I thought it was an fnf video
The best part of the video is lil' Manifold at the end asking to subscribe.
Tommy is so tall lol
Hey they are getting a workout while playing Minecraft.
0:29 I though tommy hated America........ There is literally a photo of the statue of liberty on his wall XD
Everybody's talking about Tommy's door but why does he have a mannequin hand?
This is exactly what happens when me and my brother play minecraft, HE NEVER LISTENS
ohhh the music on this was placed and timed so well, scratched my brain very nicely 👍
"You know what? Inventory" is the best punishment ever 😂
why is the skin jacks but when they die it say tommy?
Oh vor 2 Stunden und ich muss schlafen :,) egal das gucke ich noch
Can we take a moment to realize that Tommy has those letter things on his door? That unlocked the deepest memory…
Pov: playing funky Friday on Minecraft
Jack: you can’t play Minecraft without your hands. Georgenotfound: watch me
this was both stressful and painful to watch
y
this is like playing minecraft on Xbox
Ok so can't play without your hands but can you play with your feet?
YOOOOOOO
Are you whatching the football?
they sound drunk the whole video
im sorry to tell you but gogy was miles before you with playing minecraft without your hands
i subscribed bc tommy told me to
did they get mcdonalds
Me and tommy have the same mindset we both hate being called annoying
so we not gonna talk about Tommy's eyes
Tommy has TOM on his door
tommy looks so tall omg-
Ahh yes. The one where Jack Manifold made his Minecraft Avatar into a Jaeger.
I can’t get over the fact Tommy has letters on his door. Waves of flashbacks/memories
When fnf went viral that every YouTuber played it(even PewDiePie) i didnt know why but i thought it would be cringe if dreamsmp or their friends founds out about Friday night funkin' i don't really know why
The letters on his door HAHAHA
Ddr players: look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power.
oH jAcK MaNiFoLd 🙃
*Dance mats...*
What I thought he was with tubbo and misster ranboo
I like how the username is TommyInnit but with JackManifold's skin.
I literally subscribed when tommy told me to 😂
sub to them they what it
Jack and tubbo: asks niki for pvp  Niki : who got training from THE BLOOD GOD
Wait does Tommy live with jack?
Techno‘d beat it
Early :D
This been up for 2 hours and this video has so many views already good job 👏 jackmanifold
We need more of that Jack Manifold but can't stop the Jack Manifold grind.  *oh wait*
Let’s get McDonald’s and cry      Relatable
Walmart THUMBNAIL version of fnf
Play Minecraft with a drum set using a circuit board?
Minecraft 1.18; Dance Dance Revolution Update
You almost got the neuroscience right. Basically: Dopamine is the one that makes you happy. Seratonin is the one you save for the girls and mommy innit.
7:32 tommy outsmarted jack XD
jack manifold more like jack manibald 😙😙😙
Did anyone else noticed that Jack put Friday Night Funkin arrows in the thumbnail?
Well, technically, you _can_ *play* Minecraft without your hands. It's also possible to beat the game that way, but it's _VERY_ hard.
7:09 lynx 🤑
This was absolutely hilarious!! I loved how they kept trying to take over each others positions! Lmaooo
When you realize that the spray tommy used is the same thing as axe body spray
KonekoKitten did this before you, a long time ago, but with Roblox. Note: Don't get mad at this comment, since it's just a fact.
You used the Friday Night Funkin arrows in the thumbnail to attract my eyes, how dare you Jackmanifold.
Pogger
6:23 tommy xD wwhvtf
Jack, you and Tommy are so funny.
This is very creative
Me: omg the arrows from fnf *see video* *in the middle of the video there a ad*  *it fnf*
"I'm playing Minecraft but without my hands" *Footcam flashbacks *
This is disgraceful, absolute detriment, devolution, even  Lucky for no one involved I love to see it, great vid Man of the Ifold
6:05 tommy XD wtf
tommy: this man can't live without annoying jack  jack: the man that is trying to do stuff but there always a man who doesn't let that happen..    wait I thought this was jacks house but I just noticed its tommys am I fucking stupid
How about tecnoblade
If he makes it to 2 million, let all force him to either dye his hair or wear a wig for all the streams/videos/vlogs that he's in, preferably the weird blue one he bought. Or he could have a vlog where him and tommy going wig shopping. Please we need a wig vlog.
JACK MANIFOLD WEARING THE TOMMYINNIT SHIRT :000
Just Dance: Minecraft Edition™️
I say Jack pitches this to Quackity cause I feel that would be even more chaos.
How aggresive that was
:) This is super cool, I love this concept!
Jack- were the first people i think to play minecraft without our hands fundy who played with his voice- am i a joke to you
0:05 - he has his name on the door, that's literally so cute!
Tommy: Do you value your fingers??? Niki: Yes i value my fingers Tommy: Well I'm about to CHOP EM OFF ...  And then he didn't
Tommy is so tall omg
They got me in the first half.
Everyone gangsta till jack manifold goes fnf.
The thumbnail: *fnf refference intensifies*
ok
summary of video: gnf is the only person to play minecraft without hands
*I practice kissing on this* 7:42
its just friday night funkin in minecraft
Tommys floor is so dirty </3
has no one realised the thumb mail is another hair reveal!?
𝔻𝕠𝕖𝕤 𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕂𝕚𝕟𝕘 ℝ𝕖𝕤𝕡𝕠𝕟𝕕?
Jack: talking to tommy seriously   Tommy: I practice kissing on this hand
When I saw Tommy's door I audibly awed
gay tommy
this is what i watch after my mom tells me i am a disappointment for not spending time with the family :)
« We are the first people to play Minecraft without our hands »  Fundy who used his voice: …
Is no one gonna talk about how small jack is next to Tommy 💀✨
tommy: "i practice kissing on this" jack: ....🧍‍♂️
suddenly dream, george, and sap seem much more coordinated in the twin video
Does anyone have huge amounts of pain watching this and how terrible they are doing
"FOCK" 7:00
Jack deserves way more credit than he gets, he's so funny
jack : trying to play.  tommy : sits down and starts watching mr beast.  BAHAHA-
Jack Manishort
Next thing they knew, they saw Techno doin a 180 split between the buttons, doging the enderdragon "NoT EVEN CLose!" while "shake it up" plays in the background.
is that edsheeran on tommys wall
Their hight difference though-
Jimmy beast
i won.
ED SHEERAN
This mad man made Minecraft into DDRCraft.
“BREAD INBRED INBRED INBRED INBRED!!”    “i am very worried”
“do you value your fingers?”  “…yes?”  *“WRONG ANSWER”*
If kapi played minecraft belike:
jack: we gotta go to the nether and the end to kill the ender dragon  the video: not even being 10 mins long
This is just a really technologically advanced version of a getting along t shirt
How does Jack and Tommy stay friends
This is what Bedrock players look like
TommyInnit drip
*In 10 years where everyone has mastered the art of playing Minecraft with their feet they have forgotten how to play with their hands* Whoever the next Dream is: *Today I coded Minecraft so we can play it with our FINGERS! (NOT CLICKBAIT)*
The way Tommy has his name on his door makes so much sense but it's still really funny to me
Tommy did what with the hand ???
HE’S STILL USING LYNX AFRICA 😭😂
7:13 why does he look....
is epic pog
i love how i came on here to find concert tickets and i came here instead
The real reason they aren't using a keyboard is because Tommy's is too big and annoying for Jack to handle
this is a hot mess
when he’s original
Tommy’s bedroom door has TOM in stickers on the other side? that’s incredible
imagine if minecraft was erased from our memories and this was the only video to remember it by
Fnf tumbnail
Yayyy
Did Tommy just purr ? [6:29]
Shaved my head can’t stop the jack manifold grind
Ah yes, Friday Night Craftin'
Friday night funkin thumbnail
Tommy is like a head taller than jack
I love how Jake is immensely louder than Tommy 💀💀
hey guys, PointCrow here, do you ever get collector’s anxiety?     context: this guy https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR6FyQtHv8mPWTdbUlZTYeCeDO6RQJ0wB
This combined with a VR headset would be a terrifying nightmare
thabj you jack manisdolf
They are in their George arc
FUNDY CAN
Lesson learned this video: cant play minecraft without your hands.
The true disadvantage in this video isn’t the mats they use to play, it’s them not working together
haha funny dance mats
if i wasnt already subscribed the little jack manifold popping up at the end would of got me too
FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN!?!?!?
has tommy ever heard of a vacumn cleaner?
I think everyone else who plays Friday Night, we only tapped because the arrows
why do i have the same letter things on my door like tommy
TOMMYS OUT OF FRAME
I saw that Tommy was taller then Jack so I searched up how old Jack was it said he was 18.....                            *I though Jack was 24*
THE LETTERS ON THE DOOR THAT SAY TOM AGGGG
I know you're here instead of studying!
Yo!! Me and Tommy have the same wooden hand pog
Cool
But why the thumbnail😭
The amount of bots and repeated comments
Is no one gonna talk about the colourful 'Tom' letters on Tommy's door?
Is no one gonna talk about the colourful "Tom" letters on Tommy's door?
Y'all keep getting it wrong! Serotonin is the chemical that makes you feel awake. DOPAMINE is the chemical that makes you happy!
Next up: *Minecraft but we're walking on steaming rocks*
This is the only thing keeping me somewhat sane during a boring summer break. XD
Jack: We’re actually doing it  Narrator: They were not in fact actually doing it
I subscribed bc Tommy said so
Friday Night Funkin' in Minecraft
*casually notices Ed Sheeran watching over Tommy and Jack*
Hellooo
Why Jack is Baldmanifold as always :(
Alternative title: Jack and Tommy play fnf in irl controlling minecraft with fnf. >.<
Jack in early of video :excited, happy Jack in the end :devastated, disappointed, sadge
Oh god. If you're dancing to victory you'll be doing this in vr soon.......
:0 POGGERS
Currently watching football while watching this why do my family force me to do things
8:57-9:05 the undertale music makes it perfect  👌
Seeing jack with more hair than usual feels weird anyone else agree
0:05, i just love the little "TOM" made out of rainbow letters
Tom Simons: I practice kissing on this. **short silence**
Did you get a Whoppah?
You could probably play Minecraft with this setup if you didn’t have to use both dance pads. It’d still be hard but maybe more manageable
7:24 Fundy and his voice controlled Minecraft lol
Jack: "I'm gonna get we- OHHH-"  Either the frustration in the moment or the realisation of what he was saying got a hilarious reaction.
OMG I AM EARLY HI KING POG
THE END SCREEN LMAO
zyack manefoild ✨✨
Mmmmmmmmmmmmm I think I'm going to Subscribe tommy :D
Love it:D
This radiates Technoblade steering wheel energy, except for the failing XD
*Joe Mat-ma*
He small
This is just too funny to watch
My Aesthetic it Tommy sitting on the floor
This sounds like a idea you come up with when you have a massive hang over
tommy and his ✨lynx africa✨
THE "TOM" OUTSIDE HIS DOOR-
epic
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
- In bread! In bread!  INBRED!  * silence *  - wait... I'm sorry-
The new FNF
Bro jack is shorter then tommy

Next I'm waiting for *"I PLAYED MINECRAFT ONLY USING A MICROPHONE WITH VOICE COMMANDS"*
Lol
This is Hilarious ngl
Seeing this reminds me how tall tommy is
Help me I was peer pressured to subscribe.
9:36  am eating Mcdonalds rn-
I love the tom on tommys door it unlocks so many memories
Friday night funkin pog ???
this was a well 10 minutes of screaming
If you have called gak master to help you  It probably would be easier
This thing remembers me of the fnf kapi mod
This but with a more compatible pairing would be awesome
I find the fact Tom has his name in little magnets on his door so cute and childish i want to give him the biggest hug sometimes I swear-
Sclatt is the fragrance man and tommy is the movement man
jack manifold makes me really happy :)
“TOM” (*´꒳`*)
fnf :D
minecraft nights funkin
Parents and older people: Gamers need more exercise! They just sit and play games all day 🙄  Gamers:
Somehow every time these two make a video together they end up arguing
pog
me: "I was impatient and looked at Tommy's dms on allday.Blue that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes
Tommy is the best friend someone can ask
Why are they on tommys account and why does tommy have a manifold skin
this is rlly funi XD
Friday night craftin.
Tommy: it’s impossible to play minecraft without your fingers. Techn:  😈
Tommy sounds different
Jack '' you can't play minecraft without your hands'' george that played minecraft with his feet '' are you challenging me????????''
Tom
lol
Getting their months worth of exercise
DANCE DANCE  REVOLUCION SOFT MATS POG
Kapi wants to know your location
The amount of serotonin I got from hearing Jack Manifold make a quality gay joke was unreal. I love his channel so much
L
The fact that this video is only 9 minutes long concerns me
Most stressful video I’ve ever watched but still loved ittt
cool jack manifold
This should  of been called 9 minutes and 50 seconds of tommyinit and jackmanifold yell to trying to beat the ender dragon with dance mats
Has anyone else immediately thought “please get pointcrow in on this and play dance pad bingo”? Pcrow the Dance Mat master VS Tommy and Jack in Minecraft Bingo
jack like every minute: we can't beat the game its impossible its not impossible you just suck
FRIDAY NIGHT Funking? No FRIDAY NIGHT MANIFOLD
This is 9:50 of Jack and Tommy not being able to cooperate
Lol
I tried to unsubscribe and the queen called and said “no”
He wants to go back to....Collage.......? Its July--
Jack is so short.
jack is a migit
6:29 DID TOMMY PUR?!😂   (NOT sexualizing just thought that was funny :)
George would be such a great addition to this
Jackmanifalloffbridge
Jack looks so tiny-
Pls the height difference i cant
the ”T O M” text on tommys door😭✋🏻
@mrbeast
plot twists this is actually for them to compare heights again
Why is Tommy confusing me with long words?! 😵‍💫
Lord

How to destroy a friendship: *dance style*
not tommy having the generic british white boy room
99% of comments are about tommys door 🤣🤣
the "TOM" on his door omg adorable.
jack manifold is now just completely copying tommy now.     how do you manage to find that stuff reliable? the screaming reaction thumbnails, the epic music as you tell everyone to subscribe and the needlessly loud reactions.... quackity also does this. like george, dream and snapmap do the same thing but more...normal...
whyd he practise kissing on the hand 😟
JACK AND TOMMY CONTENT IS JUST 😩😩
me: "I was impatient and looked at Tommy's dms on allday.Blue that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes
@technoblade we got a new challenge for you ;)
HOW DO PEOPLE CODE THINGS TO DO STUFF LIKE THIS IM SO CONFUSED  edit: i mean yeah i am confused because im just a kid and know nothing about code :D
The amount of whiplash I got from that thumbnail..
Not really early 😟👍
ddr pros be sweating rn
INBREAD! INBREAD! INBREAD! INBREAD!
I love this forth tommyinit's channel
OMG
I actually know someone who beat the game using only their feet
Should've turned on auto jump
This is a unique way to play Minecraft!
Whoppa.
When Jack at near the end says you can't play Minecraft without your hands when fundy made a video about controlling it with his voice
Just realised Jack looks like scout from tf2
Let's get McDonald's let's cry. -Tommyinnit
This, but with vr!
This is possibly the greatest video idea
jack's content is amazing plzyftdf
I was planning on doing this myself but my parents won't let me get a ddr pad like that even though they're cheap
Click subscribe and we’re here for life? *I have no complaints, can’t stop that Jack Manifold grind*
Oh man it hurts it hurts so much
7:42  jacks face was my exact reaction
Hope that McDonald's was good Jack.
Tommy being done with jack for 10 minutes-
the letters on the door are killing me
I love Niki HAVFJEBFIEB
friday night funkin

Gotta love that jack manifold grind
"Today we will be playing the girlfriend mod with one hand!"
Why would they get McDonalds big man needs a whoppa 🤔
Nice
maniass
another episode of manifold babysits tommy
"you cant play minecraft without your hands" Fundy with his voice: am i a joke to you?
You guys live together?
dream should do a speedrun like this
“what is serotonin“
give it to me give it to me give it to me give it to me I want to do this so bad what the actual fuck I have never wanted for anything this much in my life
Tommy is a control freak and a only child, we can see that
tommy has red eyes he has been taken over by demon and before aby of you go its a camera i know so shut up and laugh
The letters on tommy’s door are wholesome :)
AYO LETS GOOOOO
How love how the thumbnail has the Friday Night Funkin arrows
wait I watched this and thought it was from 5 months ago but turns out it’s from an hour ago lmao
Wow epic gameplay
kinda sus
tommyinit make dance maps 1000 times funnier!
At the start
Jack: you can't play mincraft without your hands   Technoblade: Are u sure about that
Fnf in a nutshell:
niki content eeeyyyyyy
the maltreatment is going sky rocketing on youtube
POV:you’ve been watching jack manifold this whole time thinking you were subscribed and you weren’t
man had to put friday night funkin in the thumbnail
damn those mats are nostalgic
Yeet
Get your here before an hour ticket here
Niki has literally killed techno
The height difference is so clear in the shot -- Jack seems like a normal guy, so Tommy next to him seems really big.
i thought they were going to play FNF in minecraft lol  i feel skeppyd
This reminds me of myself when I had to play with my younger sister xD
Beep boop
They used the Friday Night Funkin' Arrow Assets for the thumbnail is cool
this video just shows how much shorter jack is compared to tommy
U really thought  u could do this with TOMMY 😂
Is tommy ok? He seems tired I’m this video :(
Tommies eyes were red
Camera guy: Where should I point the camer- Jack: _feet._
Yoooooo
Screw Dance Dance Revolution, it’s Minecraft Minecraft Revolution now boys
I like how tommy and Jack are like dream and George or skepy and badboyhalo.
Me: Is Tommy taller? Jack: Am I short then? Tommy: Jack, you are short..😆 🤣
Legends know he used the Friday night funkin arrows for the thumb nail
WHEN JACK STARTED KICKING TOMMY I AM CRYING LMAO
Jack: it's like a chemical that makes you happy Me: drugs?
“Why is it so big😩” -jack
Love the FnF arrows in the thumbnail
Tommy still has those letters on the door omg

LMAO TOMMY TOWERS OVER JACK ITS JUST *HILARIOUS*
Shortmanifold
The fact that Tommy has the letters on his door is especially funny since Tommy's an only child
Imagine being Tommys mom  and then suddenly a 20 year old man walks in and Tommy just tells you that it's his friend 😭😭
you cannot unsubscribe from jack manifold.  my friend tried. she could not.
Chaos
Hi
me: "I was impatient and looked at Wilbur's dms on allday.Blue that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes
Jack manifold grind never stops
So basically.. “We played Minecraft with only our feet”.
Ummmm, am I the only one who sees Tommy is taller than Jack?????
This would take a lot of cooperation and putting tommy and jack together- uhm good luck
Niki: so you're just saying that I'm one level up a zombie Jack:... I wish you the best of luck   Jack and tommy: *Literally gets destroyed by niki*
*Kapi:* Count me in!
dream and sapnap should try this
To be fair. Technoblade did it with a stearin wheel
WHY DOES TOMMY HAVE HIS NAME ON THE DOOR THATS SO ADORABLE
Friday night funkin in the thumbnail tho
Tommy got the DRIP
Jack: we playing on dance mats  Kapi: am i a joke to you?
Niki: so you're just saying that I'm one level up a zombie Jack:... I wish you the best of luck Jack +tommy: *Literally gets destroyed by niki*
jack and tommy lost the battle just like jack lost    the love or host
Jack manibald

Bruhh jack and tubbo and tommy and ranboo are the perfect comedy group

They copied it from Friday night funkin
I was about to poke fun at the letters on Tommy’s door but then I realized I actually kinda like it 😳 time to go decorate my door
Nice video jack!
Chat: Tommyinnit died by zombie Me thinking that they where on Jack's minecraft account

Ok this isn’t important but early!
The Dance Dance revolution we didn't know we needed
I love tommy's red vampire eyes
Kinda want to see how many tries until you can finally beat Niki.
Not Tommy having one gray and one black sock-

A6d did this so long ago 😂
Today I coded it so that we were miserable
9:45 small manifold  Jack Minifold rumors were right
Comment 2000 yay
Mmmmmmm me gustaaaaaa
The height difference makes this so much funnier, it’s so weird seeing “little” Tommy not being so little
Jack having to frame this to fit both their heads
Ok but you could’ve turned on auto jump
Not gonna lie I thought Tommy said “Food though, we’re gonna get the WEED.” 3:25
Tommy just annoy jack and just gets hard if they fight the ender dragon
Could you make a vid of you playing Friday night funkin using the dancing mat ? E
I am 150 cm but in feet i am 4 feet
When you subscribe you can't stop that jack manifold grind
Jack is so tiny 😭😭😭😭
Everyone ignoring that Tommy said he practiced kissing on the hand?
Thank you very much for this minecraft content.
Yes
WHOS IDEA WAS THIS gave me asdf flashbacks
Why’s the name Tommyinnit but it’s Jacks skin?
6:40
I am watching this at 2AM
Jack manifold, tomothy danger kraken innit has convinced me to subscribe
This is the content I needed after a breakdown :)
MEOW
Me: Are You Two Friends? Jack:Yes Tommy:No
Please tell Tommy to clean his floor

KAPI??  0-0
Tommy 1000 iq moment 7:30
This went from speedrunning to getting beaten up by Nikki four times really fast.

Friday Night funkin in Minecraft
“You can’t play Minecraft without your hands” George’s feet cam video existing 👁👄👁
the " tom " on tommy's door that bring back memories when they did that to my door :]
I can't believe Tommy start wathing Mr.Beast while playing.
e.
Are they serious? Niki trained with Techno and killed him once, she's not _that_ bad at pvp. Bad, but not that bad
Tommy is a druggie confirmed 👍
I can feel Tommy's frustration
thought this was FNF kapi mod in Minecraft for a second
not first gang
Them calling niki one level up a zombie shouldn't be as funny as it is but I am, in fact, very amused by it lmao poor Niki 😆
T.♾.M
i was in the middle of something important but now it doesn't matter, the jack manifold grind don't stop no it don't stop
tommy going "its my last dose of- what *is* serotonin??" is such a mood im-
Early
Why tf the arrows at the thumbnail is Friday night funkin arrows???
If you see this I think your Pog no joke
I love how everyone is talking about the letters on Tommy’s door-
jack manif old did you know 1 person liked link of this video on facebook you are probably interested in that because you are old like facebook users
2000th
tommy is not annoying
Why is Tommy SOOO much taller than Jack?
This video is a banger
"No one can beat Minecraft without their hands-"  But... Techno beat it with a steering wheel.... so things can be acheived.
does this remind anyone else of the mod fundy made?
Lol
Tommy may be an only child but he still needs his door labeled or else he gets lost
"Jimmy Beat comes out!"  "Congrats Jimmy Beast"  "What?"  "You just said Jimmy Beast comes out"
Do do do doo
yall are on about the letters on the door but im trying to figure out who's on the first poster from the left
THE LETTERS STOP- THAT IS SO CUTE
𝕃𝕠𝕝
They lasted 2 seconds before trying to verbally kill each other 😌
YES LOL
the letters on tommy’s door is going to make me cry ong
Wohooo
So what's the name for this duo
Jack manifold is kapi confirmed
Am I the only one that was screaming when he said serationin cause that's girl in red song and I love her music #iamgay
Tommy talking about serotonin pretty much confirms my theory that he listens to girl in red.
The letters on Tommy's door oh my god..
Jack
Tommy’s floor gives me anti-serotonin
22 mins ago
Who's here before this man grow long hair? Hit like.

I’m too stupid to think of a good comment right now so can everyone just pretend I said something hilarious
Fighting.
The beginning summed up: “I am the captain now”
Yes.
use a steering wheel next
Am i the only one who thinks  jack and tommy act like brothers lol
The letters on Tommy’s door are adorable 🥰 I’ve always wanted to do something like that but I was too shy  and embarrassed to do it 😞😞  Also why tommy gotta be so damn tall
Tommy standing there with swag glasses: Hello bitch✋😎
I LOVE THIS LMAO-
I'm just waiting for Tommy's video called "Jack Manifold makes beating Minecraft by Dancing 1000% Funnier!"
Tommy made me sub

Jack: "We tried beating the game, turns out its impossible, no one can do it"  Techno, who beat Minecraft with a steering wheel: *"Impossible you say?"*
Tommy doing the „YouTuber apology move“ and sits on his floor lol

Oh my- the letters on Tommy's door are so cute! It gave me so much Serotonin😭
Tommy is a child
The letters on Tommy’s door bring back many memories
I’d say -  I’m pretty   early
Jack should have a Tommy hate club and Tommy have a jack hate club
My cat is in the vet right now and this made me laugh thank you
Jacks channel after this video : +30,000
as soon as you subscribe you become mentally binded to become a Jack Manifold enjoyer. help.
"we played minecraft in a dance pad" people who played ddr:this will be easy
This was funy
Challenge: try to find a single comment NOT about the letters on Tommy's door
Just thought I’d let my existence be known
잭이 새 소파 냄새가 난다고 캐논을 이끌었어
jack what have they done to you
Tommy is surprisingly tall.
Jack short arc will never end
That one dude in the Arcade playing DDR be like: 👁👄👁
is it me or i thought ussr anthem was playing for a sec .
Very unique
jack manifold = best man
Never thought I'd hear TommyInnit say he practises kissing on a mannequin hand.
The undertale music in the back while they're fighting Niki is everything
Do all these youtuber know code? like dream knows and now jack? (its rlly cool tho)
This is a step-up from a steering wheel.
M,G
They really decided to pvp the one who beat technoblade
nice
I am sorry to say this but the hight difference is killing me
THE FNF ARROWS ON THE TITLE PLS- 😭
*Tom* written in foam letters gives me life
i was just binge watching his videos then refreshed to see a new video came out
daddy jack
The letters are proof Tommy’s still a child 😂
72,031 views how high will it get
Make technoblade do this, he will beat it by himself
Watched this while walking my dog, got a few strange looks but oh well
this must've been very chaotic to film
that's something I really would enjoy doing since I love these mats, what a great day to be a Jack Manifold enjoyer
I have letters on my door too 🥺
Tommy’s floor…
THE SCHLATT PLUSH
Lmao
“The most generic white boy”
IM EARLY WT
love the constant view of the height difference
16 mins early🤔🤔
YOU JUST SEE ALL THE PLAY BUTTONS HE HAS
Hi
FINGIES
Oh you knew what you were doing with the FNF arrows in the thumbnail
Those letters on Tommy’s door have definitely been there since before his teen years
7:23 i'm pretty sure george did it first
Dance mat makes Minecraft 1000% funnier 🤣
Hi
CONGRATULATIONS JIMMY BEAST
“Let’s get McDonald’s and cry” ngl that sound like a good idea 🏃
OK THIS WAS CHAOTICALLY ADORABLE
the letters on tommy’s door are very endearing to me
Does this even count as a vlog?
Tommy: What is serotonin We are already of to a good start -_-
"I practice kissing with this" -Tommyinnit 2021
LMFAOO
this is where the real sweat begins bois
Everyone talking about the letters on Tommy’s door but no ones talking about the swagilicious glasses
No hands Ö
how mcyts get their much needed exercise
hi im early for once  :D also i love this video lol
Pure enjoyment on that face in the thumbnail
the letters on tommy's door are memorys
when you have the exact same deodorant as tommyinnit
I was about to sleep but this is more important
your ideas are always so creative and fun to watch
HES SO TALL
ManiAss
The way Tommy say "Ooh, MonkaW" is hilarious to me
I wish to see you on dance dance revolution
Serotonin is actually the chill chemical. It makes you relaxed. Dopamine is the happy chemical. science major things
0:16 "vampireinnit"
It's 2 AM and im watching this. death, here i come.
The 16 dislikes have no life
THE  T O M
Intoresting
7:41 um okay
TOMMYS DOOR I"M CRYING
the letters on tommy’s door makes me so happy :)
FNF
The Undertale boss music at the end 😂
Tommy tries so hard to prove to people that he isn’t a child yet he has wonky letters spelling “T O M” on the front of his door lol
everyone talking about the letters but im over here wondering how is tommys room as big as that once place in dave n busters
Lol jack so tiny next to Tommy heh
🐢
The way tommy just throws a tantrum when jack doesn't agree with him
Dance Dance Revolution x Minecraft, the crossover we never knew we needed
i don't understand how tommy can practice kissing with a fake hand...
Man, who knew that Tommy would be behind the Tom door! 👁️👄👁️
They have better cooperation than me and my sisters
This video we coded it so that we are Friday night funkin characters in Minecraft, will we be able to beat the enderdragon? Find out at the end of the video /j
7:12 I really love this bit 😂
THEIR HEIGHT DIFFERENCE IS SO FUNNY
"because it's my last dose of... what is serotonin?" me too tommy. me too
I'm finally early I'm literally from PH so its 1:51a.m.
I- I, the letters on Toms door are wholesome and adorable 🥺🥺! Also awesome video, such a good idea!
"I practiced kissing on this"- tommy
“You can’t play minecraft without your hands” - Oh really?  *remembers George playing bedwars with his foot..*
9:14 AYO HAIR REVEAL
"You can't play minecraft without your hands"   Is that a challenge. Watch me spend most of my money on dance mats and do this and fail miserably
The missed Joe Mama opportunity... I’m disappointed in Tommy.
Playing minecraft without hands is a newest most fun way to play. Requirements: dance mats x2. You can only play this as multiplayer irl.  Moving backwards in minecraft has never been easier! Best mode for you and your friends! Fighting monsters is sooo much more fun and intense. Sprint jumping has become nearly impossible. And no possible way to win the game or pvp. Try today for FREE!!
9:10 where did Niki go :(
His bedroom door is like something you'd find in a 7 year old bedrooms and it's really adorable :[[[
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA        sorry it was so funne
TOM
I’m impressed they were able to do this with dance mats
Helllloo

TOM SIMONS: THE MOST GENERIC WHITE BOY!
its 3:49am lol, i was going to bed 😭
jack is wearing a rip off tommy shirt
You forgot Gogy who played minecraft without his hands. Obviously, Gogy is the superior being and you are mere cheap copies trying to imitate a fraction of his power
the way tommy has his schlatt top on and you can see his schlatt teddy in the corner
The entire comment section is just about Tommy’s foam letters on his door
What can I say.... IM EARLY 😎
this is the most chaotic game of mincraft
big man
U can if you're good
on the contrary georgenotfound HAS in fact played minecraft without his hands (it was hypixel but minecraft is minecraft)
tommy just doesn’t care and. tbh i love it but also poor jack
Veteran rhythm gamers: Finally, they noticed our skills.
Dude tommy has a his name written on his door with FOAM. He truly is a child.
This video is just about as sad as my love life
You could say Jack and Tommy are *’armless*
Tommy's last dose of serotonin... damn he never gonna be happy agian
AWWW THE LETTERS ON TOMMY'S DOOR IS JUST TOOO CUTE 😍😍😍
One day it will be possible Jack
I think I just lost my last braincell

Hellooo
Tommy is so pretty
i just watched a child and a not so bald man fight while playing minecraft with a dance mat, and i'd do it again
Just here for likes honestly.
The letters on Tommy’s door remind me of when you were in preschool and they would give you letters to play with to help you learn the alphabet
Jack manifold is seggseee
Pog
Jack : we are the first people to play Minecraft without our hands  Tommy : my boy 😈🖕
Let's goo 9 minutes
Don’t me mean jack, Tommy’s still a baby he still *dribbles*   Edit:cthanks for the likes and let’s try not to take this out of context lol

7:00 the Jschlatt plushie lmao
My brain when I see the arrows in the thumbnail: JACK AND TOMMY ARE PLAYING FF?
Ok but why has Tommy practiced kissing on a wooden hand?
The letters on Tommy’s door remind me of those magnet letters you would put on the fridge door
The letters on Tommy’s room omg awww

🤣👍 this sounds like it's gonna be hilarious
You’re joking 😭😭
Tommy just sitting down while Jack is struggling  running away from monsters
Wait- nick - TommyInnit but skin - Jack Manifold?
