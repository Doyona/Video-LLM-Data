0:07 Guess what, it was Tuesday!😊
When she said we’re buying hype houses now and the picture popped up I almost died #PoorCalvin
Colleen: Baby #2  Life: and #3... haha  Colleen: what
more like baby #2 and #3
The title now should be “Planning Baby #2 & #3 wait we already had twins nvm 🍓
Me watching this after she had the twins
Anyone here after Maisy and Wesley are born?
Who is watching this when the twins (Masiy and Wesley) are born ?
I bite my string cheese.
now she has 2 more kids lmao. how things can age in a year and a half..
Colleen talking about baby no 2 when she's sitting in the nursery  of baby no 2 and 3
I love the relationship requirement lol
Watching this, knowing she's in Wesley and Maisy's room 😭♥️♥️
MOVE TO CANADAAAA!!!!
Well that escalated quickly
colleen: planning baby #2 8 months later:  preggers w twins! 1 year and 1.5 months later colleen: sooo my twins are born a week or so after the birth of her twins: we're gonna name them maisy and wesley
who's here after the *twins* Wesley and Maisy were born?
Watching after she has a had the twins. I feel what she said about wanting to wait because of the gobal pandemic and she was being scared to get pregnant again. I feel the same way. She wanted to wait after the election though because her rights as a woman might be taken away. What rights? The right to abort ?if you trying to get pregnant why would you worry over that.?  I agree with everything she had said except that. It's the Dems trying to take away our freedom.
And now the twins are here 👏👏👏
Planning for baby #2 ( haha funny, she already got #2 and #3)
Who’s here after the birth of the twins?
I just rewatch This and now she’s pregnant with twins!!!
“Planning baby #2!”  The twins: Surprise b*sh
Someone in the comments said the blanket behind her looks like ground beef... and now she has a tortilla blanket... girl is out here to make a blanket taco!
And one more

I love you
Dairy substitutes, like Almond milk, may be better for the cows but it takes SO much water to produce. So that may not be the best option when trying to make better choices
who else is here after her miscarriage
colleen: where my anxiety brothers and sisters at  me: girl, your looking at one;) girl i gotch u........ o wait she cant see me:(
Men can't have periods
Who’s here when she was pregnant
Imagine if their Halloween costume was Gertrude, Horton and Elephant bird
I got Post-Partum Anxiety, toooooo! ✌🏼 back in 2016-2017! It actually got me to start seeing a therapist for the first time ever, so that was good. Edit: to add... I also bite string cheese. 😬 & I've inadvertently taught my four-year-old to do the same. 😅
i'm really proud of colleen for being so open about her birth story and just her life in general. she's got such a kinda heart, and she's one of the one people in life that i look up to. she's gotten me through so much 💕
yes baby:)
If you ever move I want your house pls
Colleen I have a little cousin that is as old as Flynn and he likes the same things as Flynn does. We could do a zoom play date. Can you like so that Colleen can see?
Ok being vegan is cool you do you but there are farmers who could lose there jobs bc everyone is going vegan and animals were born to be eaten there not pets if you want to see something like that go to a zoo 🤨
What was the costume supposed to be?
not earning enough on the first?
You can’t be a man and hv your period. Yes there are trans people but they are not woman getting periods
OH MY GOSH THE STRING CHEESE. My math teacher said he just bites it!! So, to help him learn the correct way, I sent him an entire tutorial on how to properly eat string cheese.
Her: Flynn bites string cheese My OCD: 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 My brain: just calm down, just calm down.
He won’t be obsessed with cars forever. It will be over when he hits about 4-5
7:07 :(
I think being vegan is fine but like... don't force it on people and watch out for the anti indigenous racism that is rampant in the white vegan community
omg your hair is so pretty at that length!!😍💕
I love you so much
When you explain "future parent hood" you are a genius ! Smart woman 👍  Also , your explanation for string cheese , totally agree ! 😁 You have a pretty face , a pleasant voice , you get to the point in a hilarious way , I feel like I could listen to you for ...most of the day . 😁😄  Great Q & A !
Being vegan is always a personal choice but I'm slowly learning about the different environmental impact from the vegan alternatives. There always seems to be a lot of confusion as sometimes the vegan options are not more environmentally friendly. (for example if the meat substitute cannot be produced in your country due to the climate, emissions from transport and shipping can be huge just to get it to you, let alone the impacts from actually producing it - so actually there would be less emissions if you bought locally sourced meat) (and also for 100ml of almond milk it takes 1 litre of water to produce enough almonds) I feel like there is a lot of confusion on both sides of the argument though.  It's all very interesting though. I'm studying an animal science degree at university and its got a lot of content on nutrition, livestock production and global food security and its interesting to see what's going on in the food production world. apparently some places are looking into feeding cows on seaweed to reduce their methane emissions and feeding pigs on insects to help give them better protein content also meaning more grain goes to human food rather than pig food.  From what I've learnt, people can be vegan for whatever reasons (animal welfare, personal preference, health issues) but when it come to doing it for the environment, its a really murky subjects because you can't just look at the emissions and impact of production from the meat industry, you have to look at the emissions and impact of production for the alternatives you are choosing  Don't have a go at me, I'm just telling you what we are being taught by professors and lectures who's whole career is studying this stuff and then teaching it to us
I think Flynn would be the best big brother ever !!!😢
I agree I think it's great to make vegan choices..even if you are not fully there yet.A lot goes into each and every animal product so cutting out just butter or using oat milk instead of cows milk matters! It took me about seven years,from when I first became a vegetarian,to fully give up animal products.
That blanket looks like ground beef 😂
Your cat is super cute!
Men are biologically unable to have a period.
Election‘s over🥰 i love how she talks about Flynn😍 & Eric. Oh and i totally agree with her on the vegan thing
Colleen, I just watched your video with Mama Dr Jones on her channel and I made the comment over there, but since you won’t see it there, thought I’d make it here on the off-chance you see it. As someone that deals with severe chronic pain on a daily basis I feel I had to tell you that if you wanted to have a second baby but are seriously (and understandably) afraid of the pain, you may want to talk with a pain management specialist and if you get pregnant get under the care of a pain management specialist. There are tons of different ways to deal with chronic pain (and I say chronic pain in your case since you dealt with it chronically for almost a year). There are the typical things like narcotics, but there are also things like nerve blocks, epidurals (maybe a great option since it worked for you well during childbirth), local anesthetic, lidocaine IV infusions and many more. Lots of safe options and even options that aren’t “ideal”  but that are still safe for the baby (like narcotics). My cousin had severe endometriosis and had severe chronic pain through her entire pregnancy because her uterus and intestines and other organs were literally fused together. Point being that the doctors told her she had to take narcotics daily for that entire pregnancy, and her baby was completely healthy and had no withdrawals. I feel your doctor did a horrendous job not acknowledging your pain, and not getting you pain management. I knew that you may look at having a second baby differently if you knew that your pain could probably be managed and more tolerable. So I just thought I’d chime in. It might be worth having a consultation with a pain management specialist just to go over your options and see how he could help if you did want to get pregnant again. He may be able to give you an idea of how he could manage your pain and make you feel comfortable with the idea of getting pregnant. I wouldn’t make the decision without talking to one of them if I was in your shoes. Best of luck with whatever you choose.
i respect your opinion on being vegan! My opinion is that god created animals for our survival, and if we don’t eat meat, the species will over populate. love you girl!
Omg i freaking live in Canada i didn't know u were moving to Canada im so behind on life
I like her bed spread. It looks like giant crocheted yard spread. And the angry kitty face at the end.
My brother would do that exact same thing when he was little. We had a glass coffee table and he would put the car on top and look at it from underneath the table. Now he’s just a brat and hates everything and everyone cuz he’s 13
I’ve been vegan for a several years and constantly hear “I couldn’t go vegan because I can’t go without chocolate/bacon/cheese” and I just want to say, that’s good enough! If you try your best to eat vegan but still enjoy some chocolate in the evening and bacon on the odd morning then that’s just fine and you’re doing great, sweetie. 😊
I think the family costume is inspired by waitress
Being pregnant during a pandemic is definitely rough, especially being a first time mom, but it’s so worth it! I can’t wait to meet my little girl! 💕
game of thrones season 8
LOL I’m watching this with my cat to
thatwasepic
What on Earth do you mean by "even some *men* have periods"?! Men don't have uteri...
I remember when she was like "im never having another baby again" 🤣🤣🤣
colleen ily but girl your rights aren’t gonna be taken away
imagine your working at McDonald’s and miranda sings tells you she loves you
I live in canada 🇨🇦
I'm probably going to get blasted for this, but I'm...confused. you've said multiple times that pregnancy was the worst thing you've been through and that you never want to do it again, so...why even suggest that you're considering having another baby biologically?  Why say that "accidents happen"? They don't if you're actively avoiding getting pregnant in the first place. I'm sorry, but something about this just rubs me the wrong way.
Hamilton is there costumes
Thank you for kindly explaining your thoughts on veganism! The world needs more people who are respectful and let others make choices in their own time.
Omg yes I agree with you wholeheartedly about veganism! I went vegan when I was 15 and I love it so much, I wish it wasn't such a controversial topic and that we could talk about it without it needing to be a vegan vs non-vegan debate<3
Love how the blanket looks like hamburger meat now I want some tocos lol 🤣🤣
if you ever need a nanny when/if u move to vancouver hit me up! 😂
mama bear papa bear and baby bear??
i think its so cool that people are vegetarian and vegan but for myself i just cant i love my meat but i do buy almond  milk and small things like that
Some men have periods?
Can't wait til Flynn is old enough to realize how cool, unique ,and funny  his parents are 😂 can't wait for him to discover netflix
Beetle juice or wicked
Gotta fess up...I eat string cheese 🧀 the same way as ur hubby ❤️
You should come to Ontario if you move to Canada. I love it in Canada. Also flynn is so cute
Why does everything have to be political. “Even some men have periods” no. They don’t. Those are WOMEN.
Please bring back Colleens Corner! It’s my favorite!
“wHeRe My AnXiEtY bRoThAs AnD sIsTeRs At!?!?!?” right here Colleen right here 😒
I think haters back off
Some men have periods? Huh?
Me before watching the video: OMG FLYNN IS THE ABSOLUTE CUTEST!!! Me after: .........He bites string cheese? Lol still luv him tho! 😂🥰😍❤️❤️
Sis wait till Flynn's at least 4 to have another       If not it will VERY STRESSFULL      Trust me
Speaking of periods.... I just got mine today 🤣🤣🤣 I’m 12
Collen: I got my period at 14 years old! Me:     ??? I GOT MINE AT 9 YEARS OLD???
I'm not going to judge anyone for being vegan at all but it does actually hurt the environment in some ways which a lot of people don't realize
Colleen:  Erik BITES into string cheese... me: i guess i am not alone and i am disrespected luv u Colleen this is just a funny comment
Its so weird (in a good way) to see Coleen as Coleen and not Miranda <3
“Even some men have periods” does she mean mentally, I’m so confused 😂
Family costume idea in the sound of music 🎶
Misleading title :(
Canada is sooooooo nice but make sure you have winter clothes!
I think you guys will be from the Wizard of OZ
“What’s a petty dealbreaker for you in a relationship?”  Colleen: *If they’re not Erik Stockton*  awww. ❤️
I'm a vegan and loooove that you're making your way towards veganism! I'm sorry if you don't want unsolicited advice, but in case you are looking for tips, I'd highly recommend buying some cookbooks to make fun vegan junk food meals and to watch the movies Cowspiracy and Dominion <3
give him a sibling
"I'm really scared that all my rights are gonna be taken away as a woman" What??! Do you live in the Middle East or something?  Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound??
I guess im old but i love me some q&a , i click for the title beacuse you already said you dont want another baby now , it is so annoying people asking constantly !!! so frustrating  , and you are the first person online that express what me and my friends talk about a lot, no judgment to people who want a baby now , but what a fucking horrible time to do that , now . So everyone relax and stop asking. Collen shares everything with us when it happens she will tell us .
When are you guys gonna react to what the psychic said about Flynn
I think u guys will be phantom of the  opera or lion king
The cup and teapot from beauty and the beast
2:28 excuse me.......
Yes come to Canada Saskatchewan that’s we’re I live in a small town
Is it little shop of horrors?
i’m copying this from someone else but you should dress up like this: you (colleen) : eliza erik : hamilton flynn: king george or philip wait and the rest of your family can dress up as characters too
Pls just wait 2 or 4 years more your son is not ever 2 years old
I am a vegetarian and I love it I love animals and every animal!
Halloween Costume: Horton, Gertrude, and the elephant bird
1 hour songs
It’s very dangerous to tell young audiences that “men can have periods” they can not and that is a scientific and genetic FACT.
The iconic thing is that today is actually Tuesday and this video wasn’t uploaded today 😀
men have periods?
nah
Can you do a nursery reveal for Flynn?
Colleen:     Even some men have periods.....  Me:     GIRL, LIKE...... WHAT 🤣
When my mom had my baby brother she hillusinated bad she said that she thought that every time she looked at my bby bro she seen a dead baby
HOLD UP, MeN HavE PeriODs 😱😖🤮🥴
After everything, you should consider surrogacy
I wasn’t embarrassed at all when I got my period, Idk what there is to be embarrassed about🤷‍♀️
My cousin Fionn loves cars and he is 1
I have a baby brother his name Christian mane some day they could have a play date #Famouse baby #i don’t now
When/if you do become vegan can you do a bunch more vegan recipes!!!! I always love vegan recipes even though I'm not vegan 😂❤️
How they basically got married:  *Colleen: wanna get married?* *Erik: sure*                *Gets Married*
1:23 My brain: 🤔 Eric and Collen: Let's get married! Family: Okay Eric and Collen: Right now Family: Okay
Obviously they meant r u legally married 🙄
Eating meat from hunters also makes the world a lot better and contributes to conservation. Just don’t eat factory farmed meat. Eat meat responsibly. Going vegan saying that’s going to save the planet is a myth.
how did you come up with the name Miranda sings?
I think that your family costum is going to be from waitress
Men do not have those their bodies are different compared to women
bc of miranda and joey
I think you guy's will dress up as Hamilton
can I ask you a question
Omg yall should be misses claus and Santa and the baby should be rouldahph
I had my at 10
Where did you get your lavender shirt? 😍
PLEASE if you’re doing Hamilton-  You: Eliza Eric: Hamilton Flynn: king George
cats? cuz it would be terrible and awesome and the best thing ever
I also bite string cheese 🧀
I am in a bio class rn in schoola and atm we are learning alot about global warming because it has alot to do with carbon and that is a greenhouse gas thats heating up the world and all plants and animals have carbon in them so when they die or we kill them to eat all that extra carbon get releases and contributes to the greenhouse effect which is global warming and so when she says she going vegan and she thinks its the best for the economy shes absolutely correct and I support her 1000% and I'm so proud of her. Like she said its not an easy thing to do I know I couldnt maybe vegetarian but not vegan so major props for saving our world bit by bit! Thx.
theme hamilaton
6:48 is the thumbnail time stamp
i’m sorry— did colleen just put a picture of calvin goldby in her video. life is complete.
i will never ever ever get tired of how incredible you are
oh my god, you really need to at least visit newfoundland of newfoundland&labrador, there's literally no celebrity or youtuber who's really went there. i find it annoying because it's kind of forgotten about :|
Colleen, it’s gonna be a boy... ALSO WE NEED TO INTRODUCE BOTH YOUR KIDS TO ANIME!!!!
I peel the cheese like a banana and eat it
I'm guessing your dressing up as Hamilton, Eliza and phillip
Vegganism itself isn't my issue. My issue are the vegans who push their beliefs down the throats of others and act like they're God's gift to humanity for choosing to be vegan - and everyone else who is not vegan are monsters. Your sister, however, doesn't seem to fall in that category and I appreciate her for that. But, there are a lot of vegans out there who are very self-righteous and pushy about their beliefs.
Hamilton family costume
You got your period on 14?!?!??! I got my period at 9 o>o
Colleen this made me think of you I played McDonalds ad idk why
Its Hamilton the Halloween costume, if not then make it Hamilton 😁
omg we’d love to have you in vancouver!!
To be honest I dont know why people flip out if a youtuber makes a decision like to be a vegan like it's your life and your choices not like your telling everyone that vegan people are better.
Beef
Her blanket dose look like ground
you should have your kids 6 years apart! me and my brother are, and we are best friends and so close!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm 7 months pregnant during a pandemic and I have hyperemisis gravidarum. Don't do it, Colleen. Not yet. Especially having to do to the hospital and docs all the time...
I think you will do Hamilton 🤍
Hockiss pockiss ps I can't spell I am dislexic
My only thing with being vegan that kinda makes me stray from it is because it is not possible for everyone. There are so many people with nutrition deficiencies that need things like milk, eggs, dairy, meat, and other things in order to be healthy. Personally I am not vegan just because I don’t currently have the ability to do so (money, cooking abilities - college student sooo not super able to make vegan work right now) Would I eventually like to be some level of vegan or vegetarian? Yes, but I do heavily recognize while I have the physical possibility to do so, many other people don’t, and saying everyone should try to do vegan things or switch certain items in their diets isn’t correct in my opinion. Dietitians working on one on one basis with clients, PCP’s, and the person themselves are the only ones that should be able to make those decisions for themselves.
I love the last one
Seymour, Audry and Flynn is Audry Two
JHSUSHIS7 YAYYYY OMG
girl i’m so glad you mentioned the vegan thing because you’re so right, it’s not easy. i have severe allergies to tree nuts and coconut, and most vegan products are either made with nuts or if they’re like a vegan substitute such as vegan meat or ice cream they’re held together with coconut oil, so for me being vegan would be cutting out anything meat or dairy entirely, with nothing substituting those things. i try to eat vegan things when i can, like vegan butter, but with a lot of things it’s literally not possible for me. so thank you for touching on that topic, i 100% agree.
idk if this is what it is but audrey, seymour, and audrey II would be the cutest thing ever
coleen pls d'int take away miranda
i think the family costume is gonna be halloween theme like Angelica, Eliza, Peggy i think that would be really fun especially for flynn
Family costume from waitress??
I think zombies
I love haters back off but is Rachel or you miranda
Dear god your rights won’t be taken away by president Trump pls learn the facts before you say this kind of stuff online ppl look up to you and you influence them but know your facts first
Wait, if all of your rights haven't been taken away as a woman in the last 4 years, why would they in the next?  I don't understand that statement.  You have been very successful over the last 4 years, and you get to do what you love.  Seems like the last 4 years have been very good for you as a woman when referencing politics.  Now of course, individual people may treat you differently, but when it comes to your rights, looks like they have been solid for 4 years.  If someone hasn't been kind to you in person though,  you need to straighten them out right then and there.
6:45
i live in canada it is so fun and butlyfull
This is Colleen Ballinger not Colleen’s Corner.  BTW I’m your biggest fan! :p
I dont understand why you title videos of titles that have nothing to do with your content. You are not planning for baby number 2. This is no the first time I have seen you do this. Grabbing attention for views
Flynn is so big ong
Just on the vegan topic: Colleen is absolutely right and it was well said. I am vegan and have been for a couple of years now. When I first transitioned it was really tricky  weening myself off certain meals I was used to. I think one of the most important things about changing diets drastically is taking it in increments, for lack of a better term never go "cold turkey". You can do yourself serious damage that way without even realising it. I highly recommend just doing your research, see a dietitian to adequately plan your meals so as to be sure you are getting enough nutrition and be patient. Being vegan is not the cure to anything and definitely doesn't work for everyone and that's totally fine. Any bit of effort to just be more ethical is a great thing. At the end of the day your health and wellbeing should come first.  That's my two cents
I love Colleen's corner Please do more 🤩🤩
Can you stop saying men get their periods..you sound ridiculous 👍🙄😑
omg pls come to vancouver
for some reason i feel  like the family costume will  be waitress
Me: watching video    8:58  My Ocd: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
What do you have against America? I'd say it has treated you well.
Why is no one talking about the fact that she said “even some men get periods” 🤨 like what?
“Even some men have periods” hold up what? I don’t think that’s true girl 🤣
I ❤️💖💝💞💗❣️💓💖💕 u so much
I think your costume would be the lion king
Is it the greatest show theme
It's absolutely HAMILTON
Omg the video after this is now Youtube Kids what happened
It's amazing that you are making the effort to eat more plantbased. We don't need 10 perfect vegans. Wie need Millions of people who are choosing what to eat more consciously. It's all a process. Don't pressure yourself. You are amazing! Lot's of Love! ❤️
Hamilton
Wizard of Oz themed costumes
your red light story is the reason i make faces whenever i drive through a sketchy yellow light
Omg if you move to Vancouver, I really hope I run into you sometime😭 very unlikely obviously but ahhh I’d love to meet you.
Hi beautiful have good day I have good day to I love you love you baby I love you husband I love you family miss you
Men cant get periods lol
My brother doesn't same thing he bites into a train cheese Alice I believe he does
Is your costume theme Hamilton???
I assume its an American thing but I can't help but cringe when people say "on accident". In the UK we say something happened BY accident 😂
Flynn is so cuteeeeee🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💫
I am guessing it's Hamilton!
And hanilton
Willy wonka or wizard of oz or the sound of music
My brother looked nearly identical to Flynn when he was a bab, and he was (and still is) obsessed with cars. Fun coincidence.
High school musical
I bite into my string cheese because I don't want my fingers all over my cheese??
UR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CHOICE COLLEEN I WISH EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD UR POINT OF VIEW ABOUT VEGANISM♥️💙😭
wait men have periods?!?! 2:29
I think he would love the toy GEARS ⚙️ 😉 my son loves them also
WICKEEEEEEEEEEEEED       Please
Beatlejuice
I like vegans, but I don’t think I could ever be vegan
Men have periods ???????????
y'all missing the part where she said some men can get period to ??😭.
These are my favourite kinds of colleen videos fo suuuuuure
You do you girl but I not
I think it's Wizard of Oz
For a while now I don't see your main channel video's when I open YouTube unless I actively search for them. I think it might have to do something with me religiously watching your daily vlogs. Anyone else here experiencing the same issue?
Flynn is so cute I wish I had a little brother like that😊
Colleen, there’s no man who have period and that’s weird if u say it
Colleen ballinger  2020 Veganizam
So costume ideas: Hamilton, Waitress, Into the woods
You should move to Vancouver island  instead it’s amazing and there’s only one active COVID case on the island
The only way our rights will be taken away is if Trump gets re-elected!
wait...what....men have periods?? how is that even possible?
Sometimes I ask myself how am I a human
thatveganteacher got her guys
I love your view on veganism, I'm not a vegan either but I do think those small steps are still helpful!! Everything one person does is one more taking the step with the others already doing it.
what is Hatters Back off about? I've been wanting to watch it
Eop
It would've been really funny click bait if the title said "I've been banned from Canada"
Anyone else noticed her eyebrows are not symmetrical??? She's so cute.
I like how it’s called colleens corner but she’s not even in a corner 😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like she is going to do Hamilton because colleen could be Eliza, Erick could be Alexander and Flynn could be Philip 🥳
Is the clicking in the background noise in this video not bother anyone
I feel the exact same way about everything you said about being vegan! I do same thing!
Hmmm..musical themed for halloween, I mean there is Nightmare Before Christmas and that's a musical (if musical counts as movies with songs) Erik will be Jack you will be Sally and Flynn will be Zero That's my guess :)
Is Miranda Sings done
11:25 Colleen is a simp 😂
wicked
don’t think we forgot about what u did🤣
I'm so happy you want to go vegan! It's definitely not easy to start with, but it does get easier as you go (and as you educate yourself). Baby steps are generally smarter and more effective if you want to stick with it. Just make sure you listen to your body and don't starve yourself! (That was a mistake I made when I first switched, because I didn't realize the difference in my calorie intake.) I wish you the best of luck with the journey!
Girl, if you move to Vancouver and need a mom friend who’s not good at making other mom friends look me up 😂😂
Colleen moving to Canada, no way?!
Pumpkins or ghosts or vampires
Is no one going to talk about how perfect her eye brows are?!?!
Canada Squad where you at?
Colleen, you are so supportive.  I'm part of the LGBTQ+ community and my family isn't really supportive of that so having you be so supportive about so many things makes me so happy.  Flynn is so lucky to have you for a mother.       Also I live in British Columbia so I'm really excited that you are interested in moving to Canada. 🇨🇦
Colleen should go to the hype house omg
Wizard of oz
He might like sensory blankets!
You should get him the educational gear sets where he can put gears together and then there's a crank and he can watch the gears turn together
The schuyler sisters
Little Shop of Horrors!! Thats my guess on costume!!
use veggie bags
Wait if Miranda sings is going off the internet does she have to go too cause she plays Miranda sooooooooo
sad
Holloween is cancled ....
Phantom of the Opera??
Wizard of oz
hi i am  bigggg fan and  my dream is to meat u in real life colleen like that is my bigest dream and i have bin waching for a longggggg time soooooooo yha
I'm glad Colleen isnt going to have another baby during a global pandemic and political unrest, be happy with the one you have hes fantastic. Yay go vegan! I was vegan for 10 years and right now I am going back to it
I think the whole family is dressing up from Hamilton, including Chris's family
Okay ur rights aren’t gonna be taken away. It shouldn’t be ur right to kill another human
um did nobody notice she said some men have their periods? care to elaborate on that one?
How do men have the time of the month
I hope they are being the heathers for halloween
you need baby two
Hamilton for the Halloween costume and pls reply I am the biggest fan of you
imagine miranda ang colleen  in one video...
do more
If you want to know where Vancouver is it is in British Columbia Canada
I’m thinking les Miserables wicked or Hamilton in that order
I also bite into a string cheese
I have a question: when you got married did you take Eric's last name or did u keep yours.
I started my period 4 months ago and haven’t had it since 😬🤔hope I have it this month
Hamilton family costume
if you are worried about "your" right as a woman to kill your baby, then you shouldn't be allowed to have kids at all. and killing a baby or any innocent, helpless human is no one's right.
They will be the Schyler Sisters for halloween
I think all the ballingers will be the Bob trapp family
when did hamburger topping become a meal? Dietician are like dentists, when did they have time to do chemistry and pharma to develop new drugs and products. logistics ?
That is not what the scientist say, it is what the science commentators say, with their limited understanding of the  heavily jargoned research and results. If cows made that much gas, we could launch them into orbit, or to the moon, maybe it wasn't just a nursery rhyme, let strap some cows to a shuttle, call it Moo-X, Lucky this tech was not discovered in the 1940's or England would have been Blitz with beef, imagine dairy everywhere and cow patties, the whole thing would be horribly organic. or frack the cows, it would be like a bovine Matrix,
I know vegan is great for the environment because of uses of factories create so many environmental issues but being a vegan also causes over populations so I don’t think everyone should be vegan but there should be a good amount of vegans just because the factories are terrible for the environment so thank you for reading this ummmm..........bye
that guy really gave vegan a bad name, after killing his brother with a spade, and playing catch with an arrow as an old man, I guess the mark on his head was a bullseye, oh yeah! his name was Cain, Adolf was the other guy.
I think it’s waitress
AAAGGGHHH!! heart broken and dreams shattered life ruined with first Question. Oh Dear dairy,  feeling hurt, Miranda Sing's secret identity, in super deep cover with actual husband, that is not me. This disqualifies her from sharing my fries, she ahs broke the most sacred Happy Meal Treaty and my heart
Is your family costume people from The Waitress???
colleen I'm here because I miss YouTube 2015 your videos give me the nostalgia and normalcy I crave
Yassss men and women can have periods!
Is the costume Hamilton?
i think ur family  costume is gonna be the three heathers from heathers
I like on one of your videos you said that you were never going to get pregnant again and now you’re thinking about having your 2nd 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ah! I’m really hoping you guys dress up at the bears in Goldy Locks ❤️
I love how nonchalant she sounded when she said some men have periods 😂
I bet their family Halloween costume is the Baker, the Baker’s wife, and their baby from Into the Woods!
Beetlejuice 🙈
BEETLE JUICE
This comment is not meant to be rude it is to inform. I thin that going Vegan can be very beneficial and I think anyone wjo is vegan is awesome. However, if the whole world went Vegan the food chain and balance of living organisms would be way off. We need people to eat meat and hunt so that certain animals don't overpopulate. That's why there are so many restrictions on hunting because if an animal is endangered they put laws out saying you can't hunt and you can only have a certain amount per season. In some ways eating meat is good but on the other hand,  some animals on farms that sell to grocery stores can treat their animals cruelly for instance making chicken breasts so big that the chicken can't even walk.
*I bite the string cheese*
Wicked
Does she think if Trump wins all her rights will be taken away as a women?
I think there costume will be either from wicked or from waitress.
I’m guessing Hamilton. I’m also guessing Flynn will be King George.
My guess is wizard of oz!
Imagine your mom being Miranda and your dad being an actor🥺✨
Men? Periods?
you talk abut the "i love you" in your vlog me thinking to myself "oh my gawd, thank god i dont have to download tik tok to know whats up"
i love colleen's corner more than hype houses, ferrari but i love jojo siwa definitely
Is it halmton? Sorry if I spelt that wrong
ur halloween costumes better be hamilton girl
I like
Where is miranda sings like
When colleen started talking about her first period it made me feel really good because i just got mine a few days ago and it was so dark so hearing her talk about hers being dark really made me feel good.
6:50
I actually can’t believe how GEORGEOUS YOU ARE! with and without makeup. I know this isn’t related to the video at all but I needed to say!❤️🦋💗⭐️🌷
I appreciate and totally agree we should all normalize and not tease others for period mishaps, but girl...it IS icky. It is gross to deal with and I have had to deal with the disgusting-ness for two weeks now ugghhh. Can you tell I'm over it? haha
My mom is having triplets even though she has 3 kids already 😱
Whelp   ther
You should recreate my family music video
Hamilton
My moms taking me to a psychiatrist for my anxiety i dont wanna take a pill every day
i miss these please keep them for good :(
haha how did I already know by the title and thumbnail is was a Colleen's corner! Also that intro brought me backkkkk!! 2014 who??
Clearly she’s a Democratic.
i think you guys will be somthing from hamliton or wattress
You guys should do Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and you being love lock heart. 🥺❤️❤️
You need a Netflix show
YES MOVE TO VANCOUVER I LIVE A FEW HOURS PIT AND ID LOVE LOVE LOVE TO RUN INTO YOU SOMEDAY WHEN IM DOWNNNN

hallo
why doesnt she write a book about her self
“Hey welcome to colleen’s corner where every tuesday i answer your questions and by every tuesday i mean every once in a while maybe three of four times a year and when i think about it it’s probably not even tuesday” HAHAHHA
Um....men do not get periods. You need a uterus for that.
Is Maranda really over?
Family costume idea: “Hamilton”: Colleen-Elisa Eric-Hamilton Flynn-Philip
david dobrik!!!!!!!but tbh i like u better
If Biden wins all our rights will be taken..That’s what I feel like..Also I’ve heard there will be some group that will not except who wins and will want to make their own..Which scares me. All I can say is to pray pray pray, if you believe..
I understand that going vegan seems radical at first, but listen. if you eat one vegan meal a week you are letting one animal live a week. That’s 52 animals a year. That’s still very far from veganism, but that’s also less slaughtered animals. Obviously being vegan is ideal, but every meal and every eco-friendly act counts.
AnGeLiCa! ElIzA! aNd PeGgY! tHe ScHyLeR sIsTeRs!  Aka that's what I think the family costume will be
Realistically, only women get periods.  "Trans" men were born female, that's the only way a so called "man" can get a period.  People who were born male don't have vaginas or ovaries or any of the equipment needed to have a period.
COLLEEN FOR PRESIDENT 2024!!!🤣🤣💕
OMG! pleaze colleen have another baby!! i would love to have another baby beacuse i live flyn so much he is so cute and i lov u collen and i luv u erik plz !!!  okay everyone i hope you have a very blessed and graceful and wonderful day ! :O omg i lov uu........... baby number 2 revel next vlog maby??????? :OOOOOO
I had anxiety in 2 grade (obviously not postpartum ) but just anxiety . I feel like people don't take anxiety serious and it is A SERIOUS THING . To be anxious all the time is really horrible . So i just want people that don't take anxiety serious cause it is . Love you Collleen !!!!!!!!!
So exciting to hear you talk about eating more vegan food and supporting people to do whatever they can!
It’s probably going to be Hamilton probably hahaha
please be christine, raoul and erik/the phantom!
6:45 ... y'all owe me
"So I thought I was dying"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂lmao I can't
I'm with Erik about the string cheese, its the only acceptable way in my mind.
So I learn This in school you are a flexitarian you are doing little things. To help
Bro my phone got updated and wtf is wrong with my youtube lmao
Erik should be Alexander Hamilton. Colleen should be Eliza Hamilton.  Flynn should be Phillip Hamilton.
I’m sorry but can someone fact check that some MEN have periods 🤨🤔 I just didn’t think that was possible??
I bite string cheese. :(
I live in Canada don't go to Vancouver go to Oshawa
Colleen, I love your thoughts about eating more vegan foods. I'm proud of you! And I totally understand your concerns. :) I've been eating this way for 35 years. It's always a process. Don't worry about perfection. Just know you'll have lots of love & support from many people like me, including your sister. :)
Colleen, you should start doing Q and A more often. They are amazing.
I’ve never clicked a video so fast
i think flynn is a reincarnation of my uncle that died a day A DAY before Flynn. you might think i’m crazy but his job was a mechanic at GM and i just have a feeling he will be.
Why'd you cancle Miranda sings?
UGG auto correct I mean waitress
I feel like with your so we are costume
Anxiety sister right here
Love you colleen
whats men periods?^^
I think your costumes are Romeo, Juliette and another characters for Flyn
I don’t have a problem with people being vegan but why does everyone have to be like thatveganteacher
Is Flynn baptised?
wizard of oz
The 💩 people say on youtube.
Message to Colleen because my mum had a baby one month ago which was in the global pandemic and it wasn’t to bad
love how daisy layed on the bed for the whole video
I might have one on accident lol 😝
Maybe Hamilton
OH MY GOODNESS PLEASE MOVE TO VANCOUVER I LIVE THERE
Just saying, my brother and I are 4 and a half years apart and my cousins are 7 and a half years apart. My baby cousin was born 2 weeks ago today!! He is so cute!! He has Down syndrome and he is the cutest!! His older sister is 7, turning 8 in November. Funny thing, she was born the day after my 6th birthday. 😂
Little shop of horrors costume theme
my guess for your costume is beetlejuice!
oh have i missed 2015 youtube
My brother and I used to have a magnetic gear toy that you could put on the fridge different ways and watch turn it on and watch the gears turn! That might be something fun for Flynn to play with!
I love her for saying that even some men have periods ❤️
who else thinks it’s probably hamilton or wicked?
never clicked so fast
GIRL WHEN YOU COME BACK TO VANCOUVER HMU IF YOU NEED A BABYSITTER
I hope their Halloween costumes will be Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton, and Philip Hamilton that would make me so happy although I really doubt it
Men do NOT get periods PERIOD!
james and the giant peach??? into the woods yes do into the woods!!!!
if you become vegin what is miranda gunna  eat
at 3:13 the guy was on the show my mom is watching right now beause i was getting a snack like i am dead seroius !!

I think the Halloween costume is waitress cause that was her first broadway show
I bite my string cheese 🧀.
Yess Colleen for validating men who have periods
I think that you will dress up as Hamilton
You should people from waitress the musical for Halloween
I think the Halloween costumes are going to be Hamilton.
You guys are going as the lion king 💕 that’s my guess like if you agree
YESSSS WITH THE MEN HAVE PERIODS MOMENT!!!!!!!!
Costume idea? Eric: Alexander Hamilton Colleen: Eliza Hamilton Flynn: Phillip Hamilton
Hi
Bro! I was not told about periods before hand! Luckily I was at home. When I came out of my bathroom at 12 years old, panicking because I thought I was dying, My mom started laughing!
you should move to oakville ontario it would be nice for flynn
Do you guys see daisy in the background
Your were fourteen when you got your period? Well I got mine on my 10th birth day. On my birthday. I was 10. Its sucked
I currently am pregnant while we’re in a pandemic and touchy political time. It’s making it harder to enjoy my pregnancy.
Hocus-pocus
The red blanket make me think of sausages
Why don’t you move to Thunder Bay
Colleen you are like the most amazing parent and I hope that you live for ever cuz I would die with you
You looked so gorgeous 💜 That makeup 👌🏼💜💜
I think the family costume theme will be The Nightmare Before Christmas🙂
If your not Eliza and Eric is Hamilton and Flynn is Phillip you’re getting cancelled jk love you queen
men have periods... hah what 😃
High school musical
6:45 is baby question. Also— she’s voting for Biden. I’ve always liked you. But now, even more. 💕
PLEASE DO THE COLLEENS CORNER EVERY WEEK
hocus pocus costume........?
PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE GOING AS THE HEATHER'S FOR HALLOWEEN!!!???? 😃😃
Hey, a vegan here! I love your videos! Thanks for making this time a little more bearable! I just wanted to say that veganism is an ethical stance against animal cruelty and a vegan is someone who tries their best to avoid causing harm to other beings. That is why vegans do not buy and consume animal parts or secretions. A plant based diet is one part of veganism. One can of course then eat plant based for other reasons, say for the environment or their own health. Eating plant based is very important for our environment of course! But someone who is doing that, might be more likely to sometimes have some meat or dairy, because after all, they are doing better than before! A vegan is someone who sees meat as body parts of unnecessarily murdered innocent beings and dairy as mother’s milk that was stolen from a mother, whose baby was taken from her and killed.  A vegan cannot unsee those things. That is why eating plant based doesn’t mean the same as being vegan. I am really happy to see you saying that we should all eat more plant based and that you are trying to get there! And I sure hope you will be vegan one day too! I see that you already are vegan in your heart, since you’re such a compassionate person, Colleen! The animal industry is a real life villain and it’s victims desperately need everyone to help them!
7:31..what? you want the option to murder your baby?
I think you guys are  gonna be Seymour, Audrey, and Audrey 2 from little shop of horrors!!!!
Que mi mamá mi papá y yo duremos muchos años
I think if everyone was vegan our planet we would have too many animals and businesses would be closed we just need some vegans and some non-vegans to help balance our planet
ALMOST every gorl AND SOME MEN
I think you would dress up like the hamiltons
you're makeup is perfect, you're insanely gorgeous.
Colleen you are the most beautiful women ever keep being so uplifting and great
AGHHIFUHWEIU MOVE TO VANCOUVER CANADA LERVS U
i bet the costume is gonna be waitress! colleen will be dawn (duh), erik will be ogie, and flynn can be a pie!!!’
Halloween costume? Musical? Hmm...Wizard of Oz? Haha.
Flynn would probably like those wooden cars that you can build and take apart (they have small parts so probably when he's older I guess). I forgot what they're called. Hold on let me try and find... I know they exist, I had one and I saw them at a store once. I loved it to pieces. LOL XD  This is the only evidence I can find that they existed. I had the red one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ5t6GjNJv8
Im guessing (& hoping) the costumes are Hamilton related!!!😂 🤷🏻‍♀️🙃
Colleen: And even some men have periods  Me: huh
when she talked about how inclusive flynn in I started to tear up! it’s so sad that that is a trait not many people have anymore
Me bitting into string cheese: 👁👄👁
I will never be vegan because I like to go hunting and eat meat 😂
I know what your least favorite thing Flynn does. He loves stickers lol
Uhm gurl ur left eyebrow is penciled in a little bit higher than your right😑
Men have periods???
permission to bring back these types of videos from every youtuber !!!!
This is the second time you‘ve said you‘d go vegan yet you still cook so much chicken and stuff :/ go vegan! 💚
Y’all should dress up as beauty and the beast Colleen belle Eric beast Finn chip
relating to the vegan topic my mom does the same thing, tries to buy vegan substitutes but we’re not perfect and we do try to but local and cruelty free products. i totally agree with it not being easy to be vegan but we’re trying
Me  thing aren’t you Miranda sings
glizzy blanket
I miss watching Colleen and finally i watch her because my mom bought me a phone now
Hmaltion
Yesss come to Canada!!! 🇨🇦 enjoy all the poutine
Or Hamilton themed
Restaurant themed costumes!
Colleen please dont let  miranda sings leave the internet
Can I ask questions too?
I don't know about everyone else but I love Q&As
If when Flynn grows up likes technical and mechanical things he can hang out with Jacob and they can make things that is going to be so cute  you need to get Flynn a race car bed 🛏 🏎 when he is old enough
the world needs more colleen's corner videos pls
Musical theatre costume idea: Colleen as Eliza Erik as Alexander  Flynn as Phillip
I think that you are going to be with Halloween  the theme is going to be hamil ty on
A vegan and cruelty free brand for beauty is called aveda you should try it!
I’m lactose intolerant so I can’t have milk😅
Wizard of Oz
I ate meat and dairy for the first 20 years of my life, but going vegan was SO EASY. That’s why I say it’s easy, because for me it was
Are you guys angelica Peggy and Eliza !!!!!! 🤩❤️
"I'm really scared that ALL my rights are going to be taken away as a women," can I ask, are we even from the same country, anymore?  President Trump and Biden are running for president and this is the f ok rst I ever heard about womens rights being taken away. I really do love you Colleen, but this sounds like utter and complete nonsense. Trump has already been president for 4 years and nothing much happend, if he really wanted to do something, he would have already. I will leave you with these ideas and you think what you want, but really think. 1) the quote, "I would rather vote for a devil that i know than for a devil that I dont" and 2) in this country we have a privilege to vote. We vote FOR a president, not AGAINST a president. God Bless you and your family.
Colleen another baby I thought pregnancy was hard for you so Flynn will have a sibling? Omg heheheh
5:40 is it Hamilton?  I can just imagine you guys screaming  ANGELICAAA at the top your lungs 😂😂❤
you should watch pen15 it reminds me of your school years
where did trump say all women’s rights would be taken away??? i’m tired of all these influencers promoting a party without doing any research.
My little brother was obsessed with cars and trains when he was a baby and is now 9 and still loves them!!!
its because were obsessed with flynn but were also understanding
Also at your age you can run high risk pregnancy.
You should do the three bears from Goldilocks
Your beautiful, but one eyebrows are higher than the other
2:51 Hey yo, ME!!!
Wicked
You should go as Hamilton characters, with Flynn in a revolutionary uniform, it would be so cute!
The brand nature box its vegan and cruelty free its a hair care brand and its SOOOO soft❤️
the greatest showmen is your halloween costume!!
I love that you do vegan stuff when you can! Every effort helps! ✨🌈🌱
"I'm kinda afraid I'm gonna get my rights taken away as a woman. But anyway." Literally me 🤣
Is your costume the heathers that be funny
How could you ever marry a string cheese biter????
Thank you for saying “he’s only 1” and not “he’s only 21 months” after that first birthday they are 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, etc no more of this 18 months, 31 months, etc that’s too much math for meeeeee
hi
I’m sorry. What. How would the election affect your pregnancy. I mean you do you but you don’t need to come up with bogus excuses lol
MOVE TO VAN OMG
Yay collen's corner is back!
Beattlejuice is what I think the musical costume is.
thank you for talking so highly about veganism with your huge platform
You should make a video taking buzzfeed quizzes just because
I also bite string cheese. 🧀 I peel the wrapper down and eat it like a banana. (Is that not normal?)
YOURE GOING TO BE ELIZA, ERIC IS HAMILTON, AND FLYNN IS PHILLIP
HOLD UP YOU SAID MUSICAL THEATER THEMED COSTUME....    Could it maybe possible be Eliza Alex and Phillip maybeeeeeeeeee       Probably not should I even comment this
Test more weird kitchen gadgets
I am sad becuse we can,t dress up for halloween 😥 i wish we can but because of covid we can't
The part where colleen said I also did not remember pooing  my pants just got me🤣🤣
@thatveganteacher is making every vegan person look bad and it's really unfortunate
The wiz?!?!?!!???!!!!?!?
I went to the bathroom and thought I was dying. That’s my experience. Nothing bad but I remember i didn’t get it for a while and then suddenly got it on the middle of the class... unprepared
My husband and I are planning on moving to Canada within the next 3-5 years!! 🇨🇦
Me When Colleen said where my anxiety sisters and brother at🖐🏻
I'm not vegan  I'm a dairy farmer
One of THE hardest parts of becoming a vegan would probably be thatveganteacher she says everyone can be vegan however medically and socialogically that is not true
You should move to Toronto!!
Why on everything good do you feel this election could potentially take away your rights as a woman. Trump has been caught saying a locker room phrase. Honestly, WHAT MAN OR RAPPER HAS NOT MADE A DEROGATORY STATEMENT a.k.a. WAP but republicans are Christians and highly value women
high school musical!
I love daisy's face during the whole video
Please stop
The only thing I took from this video: ERIK BITES INTO HIS STRING CHEESE!?!?
Why does her blanket high key remind me of minced meat
Yuss Colleen’s corner is where I found you!
I'm turning 14 in December and I've been vegan almost my whole life, I completely agree with everything you said about the subject whatever everyone can do Is fine people say oh that's not gonna do anything either go vegan or don't but if all the people who said that did whatever they could there would be better results just do whatever you can
So cute!
Im vegan and you definitely hit it right every little thing counts!!! <333
Can you do a live video
Hamilton themed
Hey Colleen, are gonna actually not make anymore Miranda sings videos anymore?
My brother was obsessed with cars when he was little and now it just progresses to engineering. He likes to take things apart and see what they're made of. So it definitely a possibly for Flynn to turn out the same way :)
For Halloween I think you guys are dressing up as Hamilton characters
hamilton or watress
Halloween guess: Heathers Dear Evan Hanson Idk
Who else is here commenting on the 1st October or later to ask about Miranda Sings leaving youtube
Men don’t have periods
It's gonna be waitress, isn't it?
Colleen, please come to Vancouver.  Please.  Vancouver needs you back here.
2:52 RIGHT HERE SISTA
Are you in your own bedroom or is that a guest room?
Literally no one cares. Stop getting blasted in. We don't care for the journey.
skylar sisters
OH MY GOD COLLEENS CORNER
Me at the beginning of the vid:🙂 me when the old Collens corner thing came up:😭😭
Wait. Men have periods??
BOMB phone case!!!
I miss chill sit down Q and As
colleen for some reasson makes me feel safe and i just cant put a handle on it
Halloween costume: the incredibles
You can be crayons for Halloween by the way I love you
Men have periods?
Haha, it’s the 50th thing trending lol
We know you started your period so we know no baby month this time. Have you thought of the period cup? Hear good things compared to tampons and pads.
I think your Family costume should be (F)Lin Manuel Miranda... get it? I just think your the only family who could that like that. And it's Theater related... 😂 😂 😂 I don't know, sometimes I just have weird ideas
Whoever Likes This Will One Day Be A Billionaire ''Good Luck''
Is Miranda sings actually done on YouTube
rocky horror show or into the woods baker and bakers wife and baby
I put this on your vlog channel as well, but you and Erik should do a video where you guys go on a double date with miranda and his character.
I feel you with the Vegan stuff! My sister is vegan, has been properly for almost a year now. And I think it’s the right way to go, and I think the heart of veganism is amazing. But I’m not ready to go there yet. I’m working on bits here and there like you.
Is it just me that thinks that the really cute throw in the background looks a little bit like mince meat...🙃
Haters back off
String cheese even tastes better when you string it. Lol
i would love a theatrical song from you❤️ but like music is expensive so you do you, boo
Eliza, Alexander, & Phillip?!🥺
Yooooooooo wtf she said some men have periods...??! NANI?! Pretty sure that’s a hard no but everything else good video just trying to be as helpful for my daughter as I can be..and it seems having a talk around 11-12 would be a good idea 😳
I’m pregnant during the pandemic 👍🏼
I think you guys are going to do Hamilton
Hamilton?
6:56   COLLEEN YOU COULD BE A RAPPER🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really hope the family Halloween costumes are either “Dear Evan hansen” or “Hamilton” but “WICKED” would be SOOOOO WILD😂😂😂😂
"I'm kind of scared that all my rights are gonna be taken away as a woman"  Girl me every second of every day in this terrible year
Flynn should become a auto mechanic 🚗
Loud
I love your choices when it comes to vegan stuff! I was raised vegetarian and completely agree- you do what you can!
Here anxiety sista
I want to live in Canada when I am older too!!
I’m a citizen of both Canada and the U.S so I can go whenever I want no matter what 😊✌🏻😏
Wizard of oz!!!
You should get a transparent car so that he can see how it “works” on the inside.  I think he would have fun with that
What rights are you talking about losing?
I hope you’re doing Veronica and JD or something (probably not cuz Heathers is not for children)
Who else bites into a cheese stick because I do 😂😂
*been wantin’ for this one*
Hamelton
You should move you ottawa but it’s a little cold... little-cold
I bite the string cheese
I hope you don't start a gender reveal party or it's will cause another forest fire
I miss colleens corner
oh hey colleen
It is not the twos it is the three’s you have to look out for
My son just turned 2 and he does the same with his cars and trucks and trains  Also, we are trying not to age stereotype our son. Think of it as the teachable twos instead. They are acting out because they are trying to learn how to navigate this big big world ❤️❤️ love how you are with Flynn. You’re a great mom
I had PPA too and didn’t know it for a while. It’s really not talked about much. I was so happy just worried allllll the time! To the point where I couldn’t drive or sleep from my anxiety. I honestly thought oh this is normal. This is what being a parent is about I guess. 🤷🏼‍♀️ the questions that they ask you at your appts and pediatrician appts are geared towards PPD and don’t really help when you’re not depressed!
little shop but flynn is the plant lol
are you guys going to be angelica eliza and peggy?!
You can fly to Canada, the restrictions are for flying
I think their costume will be alexander hamilton, eliza and philip
Yesssss come to Canada we welcome you
me: watching colleens awesome video also me: staring at her blanket that looks like ground beef
https://youtu.be/egDjyNQ2MD4 .
Musical theatre costume: Grace, Daddy Warbucks and Annie. I would simply pass away
New children on YouTube feel like expendable pieces of YouTube content now
My son is obsessed with cars too and dinosaurs and blippi. And coloured cars
3:42
Vegan-ish choices are a fantastic way to make an impact and still counts!! Also, ripped a bunch in the hospital with baby number 2. Didn't rip at all with baby number 1 in water. Babies are weird. Our bodies are weird. It's all weird and all about you and your family of when or if to have another 😆❤️
Wait, some men have period too?
Yay please move to vancover
Me and my family have been vegan for over 4.5 years and LOVE IT. Isn't easy first few months or year then gets suuuper easy and second nature!
にゃー(=ﾟωﾟ=)♪
My son is also obsessed with cars and trucks. He is 3.5 now... and we ate encouraging of any interests. He completely took this all on his own and that is all he plays with!
Get Flynn knex toys. Then you can build something with him and he can watch the gears go! My daughter loves all cause and effect toys. We have all the lovevery toys and they’re her favorite
i love colleens cornersssss omgggg
I’m so heartbroken 😂🥺 I’m not capable of having a relationship with Colleen even tho I’m straight and dont wanna date her 😂
I agree with u on being vegan my friend told me she would never do it bc “the animals were put on this Earth to be eaten” 🤔
Qe still want the Colleen's Corner. 2015 or 2020, it's still wanted ✌
She is only having a baby so she can make money of them
Synopsis of my first period, 13, spanish class, couldn’t remember how to say “may I go to the bathroom” in Spanish...
Please be hamilton
Collee: where are my anxiety brothers and sister ✌️ Me: ✌️
Whatever u do is t have Flynn and baby #2 4 years apart, my brother and I are four years apart, and we are NOT close
No one : Me : still waiting for season 3 of haters back off
About the vegan thing, aren’t you also killing the environment because your killing plants?
Who knew a darned ticket could be so positively life changing🤪That “mug shot” of your crime in progress is priceless 😂  Looking forward to your growing family! Warm wishes to you and yours 🥰🙏🏻❤️
Hamilton costume! Alexander, Eliza and Phillip!
YAY COLLEENS CORNER IS BACK :D
You’re just amazing, stop worrying about what people say in the comments, you’re perfect and your choices are valid.
Waitresses
Love you!
I see your taking inspiration from Elon musk on the naming of your children      #2 do be an interesting name do
im gonna guess little shop of horrors. colleen as audrey. eric as seymor, and flynn as the plant hehe <3
Are you going to be Alexander Hamilton, Eliza, and Phillip?
Crayola Crayons called, they want their eyebrows back.
Kids around your sons age my mum says it’s the best so and such a precious time! So use the time wisely 😂❤️❤️
Colleen I 100% agree with you but they might possibly bring back slavery because If we all become vegan because there will be soooooooo many crops to pick. For example I drink soy milk which is soy beans, and other stuff I don't know of lol. Anyways love you
HAMILTON!!!!!!!!!
I love Colleen’s Corner so much honestly
Om fikin g #41 on trending !!!!!!!!!!!!
6:53- 7:06
6:45    Your welcome

Video title; Planning baby #2  Also Colleen: “we are not planning for a baby any time soon”
Colleen looks so much like Parker on that photo of feb 2013 in the car

Hamilton
Who else is Erick who bite the string cheese 🙋🏽‍♀️😂
You want to boil a two-minute egg. If you only have a three-minute timer (hourglass), a four-minute timer and a five-minute timer, how can you boil the egg for only two minutes?
I totally agree with you about veganism! I wish I was there but I’m not. It’s a great way to help the environment. We should support everyone who is making efforts and not tear each other down, we’re all a team let’s do this together!
I’m not asking this to be rude, I’m just generally curious. How can a guy get a period?
2:52 HERE I AM IM AN ANXIETY GURLLLL
Relax your rights won't be taken away lol, so dramatic.
6:45 is what your looking for
Men cannot get a period , if they are really a male they can never and will never get a period. I like you but can't stand when you go all SJW.
I think u should have 1 more baby girl
i think you guys are gonna be Annie themed ❤️❤️❤️
Alexa, play Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye.
whoo
As a vegan I think it’s a great idea for you and I’m glad your spreading this idea on your platform 💕💕
I am vegan and I really appreciated what you said about your journey and efforts to going towards veganism. Anything counts and no one has to be perfect! Love you
Newsies Halloween costumes
I’m hoping for a little shop of horrors Halloween costume.
hamaltin mabey
I guess your costume will be beetlejuice
Eliza, Alexander hamilton, and their baby boy
No babby 2. Angles you need more yelling
My guess for costumes is Annie, Wicked, or Cats. Maybe Hamilton but everyone will do that, but of course you can't go out in it. I'm sure the family will look AMAZING!!
Why is the world would you ask Colleen if she will have another baby just.....ugh
Ok so maybe I just want to manifest this but is the Halloween costume Little Shop themed? Audrey, Seymour, Audrey II?
God literally all the trending videos are about babies and gender reveals?? Like YouTube what’s going on?? You got baby fever?!?
Oh my gosh Canada 🐼 yay !!!! I am in Canada hope you can come it is the best here
Hamilton  Eliza Philip  This needs to happen.   Flynn needs to learn the raps
I love doing little things, but almond milk is worse for the environment than regular milk
I would love to see Flynn in a grease costume. I think it would be so cute!! 😍
Alright chill some of us are pregnant currently and it’s not that big of a deal. You made it sound as though anyone pregnant during this time is making a mistake. I found this video oddly annoying and I love you but not this video
Hello
Men's don't have period.
Wait what? Hold up...Men have periods?
Its called cheese sticks and you bite into them
I never clicked on a video so fast
Halloween costume! Hoping its Gertrude, Horton and the elephant bird 💗
My son loved cars when he was Flynns age and he still does. He watched car crashes all the time and he is very interested in the mechanics of it.
You help me feel confident starting my channel and be more serious!!!   I'm doing daily vlogs!!!!!!
Who asked
I love you!
We Stan Colleen for caring about this virus and taking it seriously and not going out if they don’t have to and also wears a mask and takes the correct precautions
Hamilton?
As a preschool teacher all my kids in my class just bite into their cheese haha
Why on earth would Eric bite into string cheese, the whole point is to string it!
Thank you for sharing this video with us. I love it.
Colleen's videos always make me feel better.
I mean.......Gertrude, Horton, and the Elephant Bird.............
For us the terrible twos werent too bad... Wait until you have a threenager, that stage was rough😂😂
EEEEE!!!!!!! Come to Vancouver!!!! 🇨🇦 ❤️
Not gonna lie... I stopped watching Colleen like a month ago and I totally forgot how much i loved her!❤️
2:30  girl what did you say I didn't hear you😳😳😳
Wait so two questions first off  The test was negative. Second Is she actually pregnant again
How are your rights going to be taken away as a women ???
Where do baby come from?
Cats! Rocky horror  Rent
6:46 is what u came for.. ur welcome
Into the woods
Please tell me you are going as the heathers!
Heya I love you and support you in your choice to want to make vegan choices :)
My siblings WENT BABY STAGE TO Terrible 2’s
Make another movie!
🐷
You look just like Miranda sings you should colab!!
wait some men have periods??
🖕
First of all there is NO SUCH a thing as men having a period
Ogie, Dawn, and a pie. For the costumes
I don't mean this in a insensitive way but how do guys have periods?! 🤔
Loving her hair growth!!
ok here is the thing yes Colleen I love the vegan idea, but I do feel that some animals were just made for food. For example cows and pigs they cannot live on there own they need someone to farm them and to take care of them so there for they were made by God to produce milk and to be turned into food, with pigs they can't live on there own either and so they need people to help them survive. So basically they were also meant for food. Yes this is a little harsh but it's true. But you still can cut the other animals out.
Yesss please come to Canada

Men have periods.....?
... My husband is also a monster who bites string cheese 😐 good to know I'm not the only one having to deal with such appalling behaviour 😂
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💕❤️💞💞✨✨💫✨✨💞💞✨💞✨💞
Your makeup looks beautiful! 💕💗
I think it's Annie and Flynn is going to be annie
Halloween, Waitress. I don't know.
I sometimes bite into string cheese if I'm too lazy to make it into strings. 😞
You guys should be people from the wizard of oz
PLEASE MOVE TO CANADA OMG IM BEGGING YOU BUT PLEASE WAIT FOR THE BAN TO END, WE DONT NEED MORE CASES
SOUND OF MUSIC.  DO IT.
The family Halloween costume is definitely Hamilton
Dear precious one, Jesus Christ is with you and for you. You face nothing alone --NOTHING! When you feel anxious, know that you are focusing on the visible world and leaving our Lord Jesus out of the picture. The remedy is simple: Fix your eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen. Verbalize your trust in Jesus, the Living One who sees you always. Make "I trust you Jesus!" your response for every single thing in your life. Your successes, your challenges and everything in between.                                Trust in the fact that Jesus will get you safely through this day and all of your days. But you can only find Him in the present. Each day is a precious gift from God our Father and Creator, through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is rediculous to grasp for future gifts when today's is set before you! Recieve today's gift gratefully, unwrapping it tenderly and delving into its depths.             Dear friend, receive Yeshua (Jesus Christ) as the Lord and Savior of your life this very moment! Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior Jesus Christ. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Believe in what Jesus did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. It will be the best decision you will ever make. ❤️❤️❤️       (Romans 8 : 31; 2 Corinthians 4 : 18; Genesis 16 : 13-14) (AMP)
The fact that daisy didn’t move like at all kinda scared me
Oat Milk is the most environmentally friendly milk ❤️
6:45 is when the second baby question comes
Can you do a makeup tutorial for this look?
Did she say self help or selp helf??
Can someone explain to me how some men have periods??? Even if they are transgender, they don’t have periods.
Since the beginning of 2019, members of the National Assembly of France have introduced 29 bills pertaining to the French Bioethics Law, which is revised every seven years. These bills have asked the government to establish a department to register human organ transplants, tracking the sources of organs from foreign countries, and enacting more dissuading punishment to curb organ trafficking.  More and more evidence found in recent years has identified China as the major source of organ trafficking and removal of organs from people without consent.  Falun Gong practitioners in Paris staged a rally on the plaza outside the National Assembly on October 1, asking Assembly members to support a new law to stop the forced organ harvesting crimes in China. Falun Gong practitioners are the largest group of prisoners of conscience targeted for forced organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist regime.     Falun Gong practitioners demonstrated the exercises and held a rally outside of the National Assembly of France.  Several members of the Assembly have introduced bills to amend the organ donation protocols of the current Bioethics Law, aiming to stop organ trafficking, and to uphold basic ethics and morality.  France is the first country in Europe to propose that a government entity must register and maintain records concerning organ transplants that were performed in foreign countries. If the law passes, it will make France the leader in a multi-country collaboration to administer organ transplantation.  Other proposals include setting up a blacklist to target organ traffickers, and more severe punishments to prosecute individuals benefiting from organ trafficking. Since September 24, the 29 proposed bills were discussed and voted on in the Assembly.  Hervé Saulignac, Assembly member representing the Department of Ardèche, stated that it is very important to inform the French people about what is happening in China.  “I mean,” he said, “there are organs taken without the consent of the person. There is no regulation of any ethics and morality. We can’t support this kind of behavior. It violates our values.”  Assembly Member Josiane Corneloup said that the main reason for her proposal to establish a registration system to track every organ transplant a French citizen receives overseas is that numerous cases have shown that Chinese Falun Gong practitioners have been murdered in order to have their organs removed for sale for transplant surgeries.
Aye I live in Canada too!
6:53 come through rap god
You not wanting to do QnAs cause no one likes them- and me- who likes them- feels kinda lame about it. :( like don’t shame the ones who like em girl.
2:49 RIGHT HERE GIRL.😂
I hope you don’t turn Flynn vegan, to many children are malnourished from a vegan diet.
If you want to be saved and have everlasting life believe Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and was buried. Then, rose on the third day, which proved He is truly our God and Savior. John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I've been vegan for almost 3 years now and vegetarian for a year before that and I would never tell someone it's easy because girl it's not.  I don't remember what cheese tastes like but I remember how much I loved mac and cheese and sometimes I just crave that comfort. You're absolutely right that any choice you make makes a difference.  Take it slow, no rush.  Switching to almond milk and vegan butter is a great step, and hopefully you can carry on that trend.  Good luck.  For amazing recipe ideas check out Hot For Food on youtube, she's fantastic.
Btw your son is so cute
Is your family costume from marrypopens
Your sister is not a vegan lol.
Does anyone know any details about Colleen’s hair routine?
Oooo
Honestly I understand vegans are rlly good for the world but then it would be to many animals
I miss YouTube 2015 :(
Lmao Colleen when Flynn is old enough get him a race car bed!
they’re definitely dressing up as hamilton
this vid is trending 😁 so proud of u girly
College baby 🍼 2 no you are 🤰 nomi
I love what you said about being vegan!
Omg when are you gonna do another show or movie
Love this 💗 I miss 2015 YouTube
I"m guessing it's WICKED!!!!!!
I bite the top of string cheese sticks because it makes it easier to string the rest of it.
Your hair is growing so quickly and looks so nice
Skip to the thumbnail  6:44
You r smart about a baby besides u r having so much fun with Flynn
For those of you who want to go straight to the baby #2 question....Skip to  6:44
She lost me when she said “some men have periods”
I'm so here for your potential vegan journey!
this video got 26 on youtubes trending videos !!!!!!!
Hey random person scrolling down the comments....     Have a wonderful day :)
8 1/2 months pregnant here 🙋🤷 wish me luck
hamilton
Are you dressing up as the Addis’s family. I don’t know it’s just a guess
I think your guys Halloween costume is going to be Eric's going to be Alexander Hamilton you're going to be Eliza and when is going to be Phillip
Erik is the most normal of the entire family lol. Also, I bite cheese sticks and so does my husband and stepdaughter. Being pregnant during a pandemic is actually the best because the hospital and doctor offices are extra safe.
BaBy number 2 with the frAnK!!!
when you live in vancouver 😏😏
Men have periods?
I always love your Colleen's Corners!
I am slowly becoming vegetarian but I don't think it will be easy to become vegan as I've gro m up surrounded by meats and dairy but I'm trying
waitress
If she has a girl baby she should name it Miranda.
lion king costume Flynn can be simba
Hi hehe 👁👄👁
Rocky Horror Picture Show costumes?
U should use The Body Shop items because it’s all vegan and cruelty free and all the bottles and packaging is recyclable and made from recycled plastic so it’s very environmentally friendly and good for sensitive skin and all there stuff smells soooo gooodd xxx ily btw xxxx😘😘🥰🥰😚😚🤩🤩🤩🤩🥺🥺
Men have?
The answer is no save yourself some time
Phillip, Eliza, and Alexander?
I think y’all should do The Greatest Showman costumes for Halloween
Cats?
If you do Heather's I think I will legitimately pass away
Every advert now:  SIZE MATTERS (when it comes to snacks) Lol
7:31 i think ik who she’s voting for now
Colleen!!!!! I love you and you are awesome!!! But does anyone know her recipie for her cinnamon bread?
Lol I love how Colleen can drop “baby” in a title and end up trending on YT hahaha a QUEEN!
im sorry but you got your period at 14 and you didn't know what it was????? i got mine at 11 and knew exactly what it was when i was cramping '---'
what this is on trending 24
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ⭕️
men don’t get periods?
I love these videos though
Being that you are someone who admittedly sleeps next to fresh cat poop, you gotta have a dark side, so my question is: How often do you curse, and what’s your favourite cuss word?   Also, can you promise me that the next time you fly, you will lip synch to the safety announcements in a mocking fashion again? Funniest 10 seconds on the webs.  You make me laugh in every video. Thx for that. Xoxo
Whats funny is that while i was watching this i was eating string cheese and i bite it
The best part of Colleen's corner are the burps. 😛💨Lmao
I LOVE YOU❤
That is so weird. I used to watch your videos when I was younger but then I stopped for a while. Last night I just thought, “what if Colleen has another baby”, and then this pops up today haha
2:36 THANK YOU. A period is a totally normal thing to have, I don’t don’t understand why people think it’s gross or why it’s taboo. It’s natural! It’s healthy! Is FINE. I mean if guys can talk about their boners and wear their pants halfway down their legs, why can’t we openly talk about our periods!!??
Sorry, but when Colleen said she would probably be a vegan ...I may or may not have laughed...
Raise your hand if you still like Q&A's! 🙋🏽‍♀️
we need a lot of people making small steps towards veganism, not a few perfect vegans
i was just literally singing "colleen's corner" last night over and over again because i was having a flashback then u suddenly uploaded a colleen's corner video, ugh! love thissss! <3
Can I just say this is on trending ☺️☺️❤️❤️
I bite into string cheese too!!!!! Everyone gives me a hard time...
Colleen: nobody really needs q&a Us: COLLEEN👏WE👏NEED👏THEM👏Q&A’S
Well a great town you should go to is swan hills Alberta Canada 🇨🇦 I lived there and it has great schools and kids near your sons age and it is happy and has a big Halloween and Christmas celebrations
Well to be ffair colleen did like 3 videos about taking pregnancy tests and talking about wanting a new baby in her vlog channel, that's why so many people asked.
Omg!!! My 9 year old daughter and I have had a very serious conversation because she insists on eating her string cheese by biting it!!! And I have told her ITS STRING CHEESE why do you bite it?? She replies with why wouldn’t you? Is a cheese stick! And we go back and fourth lol 😂
ilyyyyy
Baby number 2
Hunny ur my litteraly my best friend Maddison
I have A LOT of anxiety
It's really amazing here in van, great atmosphere, amazing night life, but also amazing houses on the hills with amazing privacy, great scenery, I just love it , its expensive tho I'm 2000 in debt LOL
Tbh it's pretty hard to believe that you try to make vegan choices if you can, when you're having chicken or other meat for dinner in almost every vlog😅 BUT I don't say that even drinking less milk is a good step in the right direction! Keep going💪😊
It will be Hamilton or Annie
You ask her Your questions And she replies Her answers are Lame but at least       She tries Colleens Corner
I love this!
YESS GIRL #25 ON TRENDING I LOVE TO SEE IT
The Halloween costume is either waitress or Hamilton!!!
EArlyy
Please make a video of the vegan food products you like. Bc you have a non vegan palette
Also, for your costume I'm going to go all out and guess Sweeney Todd, Mrs. Lovett and Tobias
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It think it’s into the woods or like each person is a diff musical
i want to become vegan but i already struggle getting the correct amount of protein in my diet everyday
Erik: Prince Erik Colleen: Ariel Flynn: Flounder
I love this 💚 we love Q & A’s
This video is amazing I love it...I wish there were more videos like this on YouTube today! Btw I think the Halloween costume may be cats😳😏?¿
Colleen: "everyone hates Q&As" When it's #23 ON TRENDING
EEEEEKKkk!-
OMG COLLEN I Wanna Move To Canada To i Probably Will When I Get Older Its So Nice And I Live In Florida So Obviously It’s Really Packed! But So Is Canada But It’s Just DIFFERENT And The Winter Supposed To Be Amazing!
flynn would be the best big brother ever
WHY does this lady look like miranda sings without red lipstick!? WAIT, IS IT HER?? Someone gimme answers rn!
lol "pooing"
6:46 is what your looking for!
Hamilton, Eliza, Philip
If he likes moving things get him a cam
Would u want a girl
I bat the costumes are about Hamilton who agrees
It looks like there is a bunch of raw sausages in the back round ahhahahaha
They’re totally doing Hamilton-themed costumes.
Halloween costume:  Colleen: Christine  Erik: Phantom  Flynn: monkey from the music box
Audrey, Seymour, and Audrey II!
You totally did teach Flynn to include everyone in the room because you always include him in what you are doing! If you are cooking, he gets to stir. If you are doing a craft, he gets to help! You give him jobs to do that get him involved, so he does the same thing!
I bite string cheese like Erik. Anyone else?
Little Shop of Horrors: Seymour, Audrey, Audrey II
5:25 Waitress? Kinda suitable since you were in waitress
The part you came here for.... 6:45
The way I clicked on this video SO FAST
I think what they meant is if you’re legally married lol
You're next on the cancel culture's list.
I would love to see you try only vegetarian or vegan food for a week, would be fun and interesting to watch, and you would probably learn alot, and teach us <3
I think for Halloween colleen is going to dress up as waitress
Why would women rights be taken away?
“No one likes Q and A’s anymore” It’s #23 on trending   Love you Colleen!
Musical theater costume???? Hmm 🤔      Colleen: Eliza  Erik: Alexander  Flynn: Phillip   😎 😎
Hamilton
I not a vegan but I support other peoples choices
I'm 13 years old and around 10 months ago I became vegetarian, with high hopes of being vegan when the time is right (and when it's easier for me since I'm living at home.) You have my full support with your commitments to better the environment, I know ppl will say "you're not doing enough" but at least you are doing something, and I know so many ppl aren't doing anything. I just wanted to say THANK YOU!! It's so important that we come together as a community to help the environment instead of causing more fights.
Hamilton is the musical theater coustume
Hamilton duh
She’s trending!
Sorry but daisy is a mood
oop.
YES! Come join us in Vancouver!! <3
wHeN YOu'Re  gOnnA bE pregnaNT aGaIn?? agreed!
I also got postpartum anxiety, it is not fun at all. Still struggle almost daily.
Colleen: wHeRe mA aNxIeTy BrOtHaS aNd sIsTaS aT???        Me: yOoHoO! bIg sUmMeR bLoWoUT!
beetle juice costume?
“Even some men have periods” me being small trans boy 😁 yup and it sucks
MORE COLLEENS CORNER
It would be so cute if you did Eliza, Alexander, and Philip 😭
No one is gonna take your rights away lol. At least from the right
im a vegetarian not vegan
5:30 skhylar sister? hehe  or maybe waitress :)
i know your saying your scared of getting pregnant and how hard it was with your last experience what if you just adopted instead if you want to though and i totaly agree with you reasons though
You want to go to Canada to! I really really want to move there
lol I’m 15 and 2015 YouTube is waaayyyyyy better than 2020 YouTube
This #22 on trending yall
Girl I feel you I LOVE CANADA and I wan am move their when I get older
Hamilton costume?
I feel you Erik! I also eat string cheese like that 😁😂
Great vidoe!
Hamilton
I love you but it’s the raw meat blanket for me
Is it waitress themed that would be rlly cool
I have a suggestion for a toy for Flynn: LEGO Technic sets. They have that mechanical and functionable component that I think Flynn would love. I don't know though, it's just a suggestion you can try it out if you want or not.
Some men get periods??? Ummm not possible.
If your going vegan just a tip is to air more in the side of raw vegan since a lot of the replacement food has chemicals in it that can b harmful but for protein I recommend a lot of mushrooms, nuts, and tofu instead of the artificial alternatives
0o0 0o0 0o0 OmG THIS IS GONNA BE CUTE IF YOU HAVE A #2 BABY 🥺🥺
You always say no one watches Q&A's anymore but it doesn't really seem that way based on views
How about instead if being vegan be vegetarian because you can still eat dairy but you can't eat meat?
you should do a makeup review on what makeup you like to use?
All the Ballingers will be dressing up as the Hamilton cast. That’s my prediction
its totally wizard of oz!!
Love daisies mood thats so me. 8:13
Is the costume diner
I think for Halloween you should be Horton Gertrude and The Elephant Bird
Omg the Kitty cat
7:04 You are welcome.
I WANT HER CAT
I love how she said mum instead of mom  when she answered a question
Search here for (Daddy's Little Girl) by Rock Candy.
Some men have periods? you're being funny
YESS
you guys should be seymour and audrey with flynn as audrey 2 HAHA it would be so cute!!
Beetlejuice or Hamilton or adems family
bolivars misclassed
COLLEEN YOUR SON IS ALMOST 2. STOP SAYING HES "ONLY ONE" HE IS NOT ONE.
Excuse me? Men? Periods?.....
I needed a low key video, thanks colleen 😊
Ok but is no one else here to say that Colleen’s blanket looks like ground beef? 🧐
I have a genuine vegan question so please don't come at me... I am not vegan, but like Coleen, I try and do what I can. I've often wondered even if we try and better the world with choices, won't someone else do the opposite and nothing really ends up "being helpful." I really hope that makes sense.
YESS COLLEENS CORNER IS BACKK
Men don’t have periods
Also the person asking if you were married meant, do you have a paper saying you are legally married?
Uh what? No men have periods... they can be as moody as a girl on her period. But men don’t have periods.
What man has a period?
Wizid of Oz or I re amend Grace that would be so funny
QUEEN SLAY #24 ON TRENDING!! LETS GOO
Hey, eat however you want to eat. I ain’t here to judge anyone’s eating habits.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Being vegan is even harder if you already have a dietary restriction. I'm in Germany and being gluten free (celiacs) makes it near impossible to be vegan. Most vegan products are made with wheat here. :(
OMG are you serious
I think their family costume will be bases on Hamilton
WaIt!!   MeN cAn HaVe PeRiOdS!?!
I started my period at 10
I love Q&A’s! Please keep doing them ❤️❤️
“Some men have periods” 🤣😂 laughed so hard.
YES come to Canada please. But move to Moncton Nb :)
My son is 12 months old and obsessed with wheels too if he can spin it or turn it hes obsessed
Idc what anyone says men do not have periods!!!
High school musical
Can we talk about the fact that asking a woman when/if/how she's planning to have kids is invasive, rude and completely inappropriate? Stop asking her this question. It is none of anyone's business except for her and her husband. It's a super personal and heavy topic, you might be asking a woman who's struggling to conceive but can't and is barely holding it together to stop from crying when you ask. I know you're interested in her life and I know you don't mean to hurt anyone but please, stop asking women about their personal plans for their uterus.
The title made my whole day yessssssssssssz🎉🥺
shrek the musical family costume.
I like how you love you son so much!!!!  It is so cute😍😍!!
The libtard comments here and there and killing me lol. Girl if you think ur gonna lose all ur rights under trump..... u need some help
Waitress
I-
Men have periods?!?! What!!!
Who else like is in school and was like omg she posted a new video hurry up school please please 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love u
Who thinks Colleen should write a book about herself not just from Miranda
Waitress is my guess for the Halloween costume
Colleen: we arent gonna get pregnant anytime soon.. on purpose It may happen on accident... Me: *internal screams*
the family halloween costume will be little shop themed and eric will be seymour, colleen is audrey, and flynn is audrey II and if it ain’t that we don’t want it!! JK WE WANT IT but think about how cute a little plant flynn would beeeeee colleen plz take into consideration kthx <3
09:22 i think the reason people have a problem with vegans is because some of them (not all) criticise others for not being vegan *cough* thatveganteacher *cough*
If this woman does not get her little boy a race car bed when he’s old enough I’m suing.
You made a great point about the vegan thing. Trying and effort is everything. Progress not perfection
EASYYYYYY on the pregnancy during the pandemic and politics thing!! SOME OF US ARE GOING THROUGH IT!
Hi Colleen I know you’ll probably never see this but I’m a vegan and most of my family is vegan so if you ever have any questions about it or wanna know which vegan foods are better don’t feel bad to ask I love you so much 🥰🥰🥰
*me watching at 8 months pregnant* GIRL, tell me about it! It’s scary with everything going on. I’m just happy our baby girl is coming this fall and we will be house hermits for the winter and our jobs allow us to stay home and protect her tiny immune system
can your WHOLE FAMILY be the vontraps (idk how to spell) for halloween
@colleen ballinger my little brother LOVED cars as a baby. Absolutely loved them. By the time he was 4 he was taking apart his toys with screwdrivers then putting them back together. He's 12 now and a total gearhead. Completely obsessed with anything and everything mechanical. He knows everything about cars. Can take apart small engines and build something new with it. The intelligence he has is phenomenal. Flynn reminds me of him 💜💜💜
I can’t stop thinking about how your blanket looks like a giant packet of mince
I absolutely love a small brand called Adel! They have makeup and skincare! They’re a small business that makes all their own products and everything is vegan and cruelty free ☺️ also love Colleen’s Corner and bringing some old YouTube back! Thanks for being inspiring and honest Colleen 💙😊
I support all vegans other than thatveganteacher. She is the worst!!
beetlejuice!!!!!!!!
Why is there raw ground beef on her bed?
Is it just me or does the blanked in the end of her bed look like intestines/ minced meat
I think for Halloween u are gonna be Angelica ,peggy and eliza/aliza
If you don't dress up as characters from the Beetlejuice musical, I'm going to be a little disappointed
veganism is not saving the world..
I feel like the ONLY down-side to not eating meat and not talking about it (because people always think you're judging them or accusing them of something) is being invited to dinner ._. Always gets awkward.
anyone else wish that colleen would start a podcast?
Six kids??? You want six of them??? Wow!!!
She looks beautiful
Agreed Colleen!! Please Vote!!! Like our lives depend on it!!!
Men do not have periods ugh 😩
I HOPE SHE MOVES TO CANADA I WOULD LITERALLY GO FINE WHERE SHE LIVES AMD GO VISIT HER EVERY DAY!! Just me??
Hi I'm 10 and I'm your sister and I have anxiety
Maybe simba and the lions 🦁???
I want to say wizard of oz, but knowing Colleen, it won’t be that easy
12:04 I love how Daisy squealed really softly at the end of the video when Colleen picked her up ❤️❤️❤️ !!
I swear to god if she has another baby
It’s funny how she says to comment below when in her vlogs she’s admitted she rarely ever reads comments.
it probably isnt but omg imagine if you did the sound of music!!!!
No one:    Colleen: He BItEs IntO STriNg CHeeSe.....ThaTs NoT NoRmaL....   I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
I still love colleens corner
I’m also scared for the future. I feel like the leaders will make a huge mistake that could ruin all our rights as humans..
If your looking for a milk alternative, please try to avoid almond milk. They waste so much water. It takes 5 litres or 1 gallon of water to grow one almond, and it takes so many almonds to make almond milk.
Omg I bite into my string cheese toooooo Colleen
i support you! <3 if you become a vegin or not c:
Right here gurl  #anxiety sisters 😍
@collen I’m a pescatarian
Maybe this: Eric: Seymour Colleen: Audrey Flynn: Audrey 2
Is the family costume from Hamilton it’s probably not but I have a Hamilton problem
Ok so I’m probably way off but I think it could be Eliza, Alexzander, and Philip. Anyone agree?
i looove flinn ! hes so cute
Erik: Gomez  Colleen: Morticia  Flynn: Pugsley   I LOVE YOU COLLEEN!!!!
Can you make your anniversary on my birthday because it is November 18th please I love you sooo much!!!!
Costumes -  Flynn - Oliver  Eric - fagin Coleen - Nancy
These are my favorite types of videos, don’t shame them!
Trump has done more for women and the black community than any other president. Your rights aren’t going anywhere when you vote for him. Please stop spreading this information to young viewers. You say “you love everyone” but your definitely don’t love your viewers that are trump supporters.
Try it. Bite that string cheese. 😜
I think it's the opera Halloween theme
Your costume should be Jenna,Dr.Pottamer, and a "cutie pie". Thank you for your consideration
Beetlejuice, Lydia, and Flynn as a giant striped snake! :)
I also thought I pooed myself when i got my period. i cried
Colleen even though your not vegan yet. I am proud of you for trying.  I didn't go vegan right away but I am now. 🤗
Did anyone see that she kept looking at her right
The "Period Poo" when you haven't poo'd. HA! Same! That needs a name like I UNPOO'd in my pants! Then we can say oh man sweetie, you got your period. Welcome to cramps and being possessed. Oh and when you finally embraced all of that mess, menopause arrives. You think you've repented for all your sins and your body says, no you haven't and raises the temps of Hell through your veins. I've just got off that bus and it was so worth it! I AM FREE! BTW, you haven't finished until you hear angels singing. Every time you hear angels singing a woman has finished menopause. WOOT!
Colleen: I might go vegan My Head: EATING ANIMALS IS WRONG MCDONALDS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6VxJW6p7OQ
Who says they don’t want Colleen’s Corner? I would watch them every day! ❤️
Maybe you should stop eating meat every day. Eating meat only once a week would already be a big improvement!
Wasn't this woman cancelled? 🙄
love term veganish! (and I am vegan)!
Hamilton costumes?
YESSSSS COLLEENS CORNERRRRE
Family Halloween dress up... Wicked / Oz 💚🎃✨
Colleen I would love a house tour video and a nighttime routine with Flynn 🥰 :))
I’m obviously gonna get attacked for this, but us women aren’t going to get our rights taken away. With Trump, women have had the lowest unemployment rate. He’s done many more things for women and you don’t get that. I love you Colleen, I really do but you and many other people need to see that Donald Trump has actually done things for this country and all that Biden will do is take us into World War III
I LOVE YOUR CAT
Aye Canadians r gonna be happy 😊 I live in Winnipeg Manitoba Canada just saying and poutine is gooddd
Click bait qweeeen
Hi colleen im vanas please read my comment im your fan from kurdistan I love you sooooooooo much like I cant explain ❤
Colleen! Wtf!? How are ALL your rights going to get taken away if Trump is president?? I'm so confused. Genuinely interested in your answer. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
How are any rights going to be taken away from women? Biden and trump are both trash but there is literally not one proposal that infringes women’s rights whatsoever? Like why be so dramatic and manipulative
I have bad Anxiety
The only vegan I've really spoken to in depth on the topic said no one can do it perfectly, but you just try to eat vegan wherever you can. It's the effort that matters, not being perfect
You guys should do a live-action adaption of the racing cartoon "Tom Slick", with Eric in the title role, Colleen as Tom's girlfriend Marigold and Kory as Gertie Growler.  Jake and Flynn could design Tom's racer, the Thunderbolt Grease-Slapper.
I wash you'd consider adopting rather than putting your body through that again.
Beetle Juice!!!!!
Heather's!!!!!! Are you doing that for Halloween
I think that since we keep asking because you are such a good mom
i love how colleen came straight to the fact how erik bites into cheese instead of like anything
If u don’t use cow milk the factory workers won’t make enough money and also a cow having too much milk can kill or make them VERY VERY sick but being vegan is your choice not mine
If you go as Jenna earl/dr Pommater and lulu I will explode
Omg I’ve been meaning to comment this FOREVER. But why do some Americans say “on accident” instead of “by accident”. I first noticed it in your videos years ago and thought maybe it was a Colleen thing but have since heard it many times by a lot of other Americans. I’m very curious!
Do you remember when she was with a medium (or whatever they are called ) and she said she saw a baby number two
Reply all your ideas of what you think is their family costume is 🎭
I reckon the musical theatre themed Halloween costume is Hamilton. 😊
is the costume thing of Wicked???
I hope it’s Sweeney Todd !!!
so if your not veegan then are you vegeterian
That’s my dealbreaker too 😂
I work at autozone and told someone over the fone I loved him (I'm female) 😂😂
I’m the same with my husband, only deal breaker in a relationship is if they aren’t him 😂😂
If Colleen, Erick and Flynn go as Eliza, Hamilton and Phillip for halloween I am going to die love so much!!! :)
Maybe Hamilton
Love you Colleen ❤️❤️
COLLEEN COME TO VANCOUVER QUEEN WE WANT YOU HERE
Hamilton
Is it vamperina
yaaaaaassssssss collllleeen move hear to canada wee need u
HAMILTON!!! ✨
I miss youtube 2015
Unfortunately your wrong, I WOULD absolutely watch a Colleens Corner every Tuesday. MAKE A POD CAST WITH ERIC! I WOULD watch an hour of you guys talking about life EVERY.WEEK.! I WANT ALL THE TALKING!!! haha <3
For a second I was like wait what is this an old video
omg is your costume going to be heathers?
The last answer is was the absolute cutest. Colleen I know you wont see this but you were the reason I made friends in HS as pathetic as it sounds. My best friends and I would mimic miranda voices all the time. Ive watched you grow so much and own up to any controversies, stay true to you and your relationship, and be q great mom and human. I love you and you inspire me a lot, since 14- now 22. Dont stop being you love❤️
Never have I ever clicked so fast seeing a notification 😌
UM CAN I BE THE GODMOTHER!? If you have it..
Why Colleen Corner and the surname that's on ur youtube?
Lmao, I know this is going to be controversial but....I ALSO BITE STRING CHEESE 🙈🙈🙈🙇🏻‍♀️
My brother got his son a build your own engine kit a few years ago. He says that my nephew put it together all on his own minus the tiny screws. It was made with clear plastic so you could see all the parts and wiring at work. Once Flynn is older and he's still enjoying those things I'm sure he'd love one ♥️
Wait, how can she be vegan when miranda LOVES meat...
6:45 y‘all Colleen is a professional rapper we‘ve been tricked all these years
Veganism is about the animals, it's a philosophy, not a diet. It does benefit us and the environment but the main premise is to reduce the amount of suffering in the world. Just wanted to make that one clear ❤
Hello you’re the best YouTube
The family costume thing I think will be Hamilton
wtf men get periods too???!!! i didn't know that educate me please
do you not like David dobrik?
omggg that colleens corner intro brought back all the memories !!!!
Even some men have period? Like... how?
Anxiety sister here
I have never clicked on a video so fast in my life
What happened to today's vlog?(camping day 2)
Not sure if it’s already been done, but you guys should be Miranda and Patrick and Flynn should be a frozetoes one year
Dont have another kiddo pls
guys hamilton isn't the only musical <3
Me listening to the period story while eating my chocolate croissant 👁👄👁
She can’t resist having a dig at David every chance she gets.
I think the HALLOWEEN costume is hotel transovainia
ooohhh that last answer will surely make your Lovey the luckiest and happiest man aliveeeee. lovvvveeeyouuuuuuu Colleen - Maybel ❤❤❤
I bet the costume is: Alexander,Eliza and Philip
i miss the little tuuune! <3 "u ask her ur questions  and she replies her answers are lame but at least she tries colleens corner"
I love how he says, *”Coco”*
you want ANOTHER BABBY! WHAT!
6:50 baby number 2 talk
Of course you use that as the title.
#ColleenforUSPresident! 💗
OATS AND ALMONDS AREN'T MILK!!
I miss old YouTube content tho 😊
VEGANS ARE FOR MORONS!
Is your costume Hamilton?
Hamilton or cats
I bite my cheese sticks
Haha. I bite into string cheese lol
MEN DON'T GET PERIODS!!!!!!!!
The baby is blond
If you eat properly as a vegan (so your not feeling sick) and you don't constantly talk about being vegan or shame non vegans then no one should care.. At all.
Hamilton duhhh
Hi Colleen! The canadian travel ban ends on Halloween (pls like this so colleen can see this comment )
Is quarantined with colleen over?
omg i watched the first colleens corner when you first uploaded... i havent realize it's been 7 years since i love this amazing human.
yes i’m so glad you are thinking about veganism and making a conscious effort! love you💚
i have pretty much the same views on veganism! it can be frustrating and overwhelming when you know the facts of how beneficial it is but still can’t switch over to being completely vegan, but i, like you, have been making small changes as often as i can and those changes soon turn into habits! i also think things like meatless mondays or having at least one day of the week being completely vegan can still make an impact and make it easier to make permanent changes. also not beating yourself up when you mess up along the way bc for me at least that sends me way backwards instead of forwards. idk why this got so long i never usually leave comments it just made me feel good hearing you have the same open idea towards being vegan and hopefully it will help others to not be completely opposed to it, keep it up!!
Without Miranda Flin wouldn’t be alive
Sounds like you might have a little engineer!
For Halloween ya'll are gonna be papa bear mama bear and Flynn is gonna be baby bear thts my guess
Baby number 2 in 2022!
I bite into string cheese
Daisy is such a mood this whole video XD
Idk why peter pan popped in my head that 💯 not it
I feel like this vid will be clickbate
I think for your family Halloween costume your doing The Sound Of Music
Colleen, please stop pushing your crazy agenda to young people. MEN DONT GET PERIODS.
Daisy! ๏๏
Love u !!
Tbh I miss 2012-2016 youtube... I don’t like the showing off luxury life style.  People come to YouTube for connection and ball pits in bedrooms don’t do that...
Oh don’t mind me I’m just trying to ask you       Why The  Heck Aren’t You  VeGaN??    Iykyk 🙃
I don’t know I just imagined musical theatre theme — Little Shop of Horrors
Aren't you supposed to be camping
Girl please move to north Vancouver it’s my dream to meet you since I was 10 now I am in high school I love you
hiiiiii colleennnnnnn
Wizard of oz ???
Colleeeeen go vegan
Who else could just listen to Colleen talk for hours.  I don't know why, but for some reason her talking about literally anything is so interesting and I get so consumed into it.
My first period story was a lot worse than yours: I was at my lifeguarding club, I was eleven at the time - which I still am now-  and this happened a couple weeks back when clubs were allowed to open again. I was in my lifeguarding, halfway through my warmup, when I needed to pee. I asked my instructor if I could go to the bathroom. I went in and locked the cubicle, and when I pulled down my swimming costume, I saw this stuff that looked like red mud. I started crying because I didn't know what was going on, so I called my mum and she told me it was my period and we had The Talk which every girl gets at some point and dreads with all their heart. I have never forgotten that (how would I though. It was literally two weeks ago? Honestly. I'm so pedantic).
Why would you wanna go through that again? I remember you had a tough pregnancy
Eliza Hamilton, Alexander Hilton and Philip Hamilton
I think the Halloween costume is Annie x🎃
Clickbate lol
Is how many
I bite into string cheese....................
Are you 👌 OK
I have never clicked on a video so fast
Little shop of horrors
Halloween Costume: Waitress
It bugs me that someone asked are you  actually married. Yes they are you don't have to have a full on wedding just to be considered "actually married" like for real. I recently got engaged. Do I think I'll have a full on wedding? No.
Omg Colleen going vegan. Makes my lil heart happy. Please please do it. It will be the best decision you will ever make. Thank you for taking the small steps 💖 if you need help please reach out to me I’d be extremely happy to help.
He bites in the string cheese that's not normal hahaha isn't it? Okay I've clearly done it wrong my whole life 😂😂😂😂but I do both I peel off n bite
Being vegan isn't helping the wourld farming is using land and not letting it go to waist and be full of weeds and we look after our animals and our land people in city's rely on everything just being at there door step and think fruit and veg just grows in a supermarket no it's not and how people go organic farming they use animal manure from farms and the ground isn't certified to be organic till after 10 years it is not possible at all for a lot of people
I have been vegan before and I was vegetarian for years and still eat mostly vegetarian but I do want to make sure its said to maybe check with a health care professional before switching to veganism so you can understand what your body needs to supplement and any risks that may come with it. I had to stop being vegan because it ended up hurting my health so bad, I was 90 pounds at 25 years old/after I was vegan for as long as I could. I'm only telling my story to say I think its important to consult a professional when you decide thats what you wanna do and follow their guidelines! Because that was my downfall. xoxo  DISCLAIMER: I know this is hella controversial but like I said I'm not trying to sway anyone either way I just want to make sure whatever you do to your body its done in the healthiest way possible for YOU because everyone is different! Any arguing on this post will be ignored bc it was just a comment about my experience.
The title = 6:45
we can all agree that colleen is the most hardworking youtuber.
Daisy is a big moood
Stop using baby number 2 as click bait , find other ways to get views honey 😘
Can I just say I love Colleen for mentioning that some men have periods as a trans man I almost never hear people say that She is very excepting and thoughtful of her words
I always will  respect you
In the first three minutes of this video my thoughts were:1-you look absolutely beautiful.  I think you are naturally beautiful, but the make up and hair make your features sparkle. It kind of like JoJo is a great personality, but the glitter and bows add an extra sparkle! 2-there were 2 commercials popped up and they were both for kids cereals like Coco Puffs, Trix, etc. That's so like you, because I bet you eat sugar filled cereal ALL THE TIME! 3-I bite string cheese sometimes when I don't have the patience to wait that long fill my pie hole with food.  I am sure you can relate.  Love Ya!
I laughed very hard when she said mansions full of glitter and bows like if you did😂😂😂👇
I'm sorry but ...I love my ribs to mutch to become vegan ...
When I seen the title of this video I literally almost peed my pants because it says baby number 2. Colleen please have another baby
When she was talking about the vegan stuff all i could think about was the vegan teacher.  Just me? Okay
I think vegetarian is still good because your not killing the animals for food
I’m a convenient vegan. I try not to eat meat and dairy as much as possible but I still eat both especially if it’s a family event or something when it is already prepared 💜✌🏽 do what you can and what you want ya know
Colleens corner oh the nostalgia
I totally feel on you on the Veganism part!
Hey Colleen, just a heads up almond milk is actually pretty bad for the environment! It uses A LOT of water to produce. Oat milk is great though and I’ve heard cashew milk is good too!
Have you shown Fynn the show Bob the Builder? I'm sure he'd love it!
Pls movee to BC vancouver pls
Into the Woods?? Colleen: Baker's Wife (gotta make that challah) Erik: Baker Flynn: Their son/loaf of bread   I just needed to guess something other than Hamilton 😂
My sister ran through a red light because she sneezed. I had my first period and chicken pox at the same time.
Btw you look gorgeous!
OMG can u guys pls be the Harry Potter cast  Colleen: hermione  Eric and Flynn : either Harry or the red head
Why don’t you be a vegetarian instead???
If i had better finances i would definitely be vegan all the time but i do try in little ways that i can.
Hamiltion Alexander, Eliza and Phillip
I think for the costume that Colleen should be dawn, Eric should be ogie and Flynn should be a pie
i rewatched Haters Back Off and i cried so many times i wish it wasn’t cancelled 😭(i think it was cancelled?)
I think it could be waitress
for the record: that driving video in february 2013 was the first video I ever watched of you
so grateful to be an American #saveourchildren he's not that bad
veganism has created a boom in the agricultural industry creating a higher demand for farm land which destroys forests and wildlife. it's a nice sentiment but it's not Eco friendly by any means
Audrey, Seymour, and Audrey 2?
Halloween Costume Idea : You As Miranda  Erick as Patrick Flin as Lipstic
Colleen: DAWN Erik: OGGIE  Flynn: PIE! OR THEIR BABY
... 😶
honestly people want these questions videos. id rather watch david answer questions seriously then give some random a car
GET KIWICO COKES FOR FLYNN HE WOULD LOVE BUILDING THINGS
they will probably be dawn, ogie, and a pie
Hand flynn a rubiks cube I think he will like it cause of the way it moves
Every election is scary, but please don't spread false fear in regards to your rights being taken away when you don't know whats going to happen.
hhhmmmmmmmmm i think the costum will be dora
I'm PRAYING AND HOPING you can move to Canada 🇨🇦❤️!! I live on Vancouver Island, right across from Vancouver and I've been following you for years and years! I would LOVE to see you here, happy and exploring with Flynn and the hubbbyyy!!! ❤️💕❤️
If you are vegan and don't eat Indian food (especially south indian food and chaat), you are not living life to the fullest
If they don't wear Hamilton costumes with Christopher and Jessica's kids I'm sueing
Seussical Halloween costume!  Colleen - Gertrude  Erik - Horton Flynn - Baby Elephant Bird!
I’m gonna guess the musical is you’re a good man charlie brown 😂 flynn would be such a cute charlie brown
Plz plz plz move to Canada I live there and it’s amazing ❤️❤️🤍🤍❤️❤️
Halloween costume guess: dawn and ogie and Flynn as a turtle or a piece of pie.
I love the Collins corner videos!!!

Title: Planning baby #2!  Colleen: we ARE NOT planning baby #2!!!! Me: I- wha- I-
“even some men have periods” 🙏🙏 Just want to say that if you’re a man that has a period it doesn’t make you any less of a man and never let anyone tell you otherwise💛
I've been vegan for 3.5 years at this point and have watched your channel for even longer. I think it would be great for you to go vegan, but it took me about 4 months to fully transition, and took another year or two to fully get acclimated. For anyone who wants to try, go slow, start with small things, and don't try to be perfect. The truest definition of veganism is in the pursuit of eliminating harm towards animals and the planet as much as possible in your life. Also, I'd recommend cutting cheese out of your diet, then giving yourself like 4-6 months to get acclimated to not craving cheese (due to the Casein in cheese), then trying a couple of different vegan cheeses. There are some great ones out there, and they're only getting better!
6:53 you’re welcome
I’m so happy u want to move to Vancouver !!!!!
what happened about camping?
I would love to go vegan but it's kinda hard since my mom feeds me.
All your women's rights will not disappear, no matter who wins the election. People need to stop saying this.
Research vegan choices and the effects it’s having on children. We all need a healthy,  balanced , well rounded diet and plant based vegan diets don’t provide enough nutrition.
Uh men don’t get periods
I Love Daisys interest in Colleens convos in the background
that is NOT your house
I think the family costume is phantom of the opera- Colleen- Christine Erik-Raoul Flynn-Phantom
Yes, move to Vancouver - we would love to have you here!
Maybe waitress but I feel like that’s to obvious and everyone says Hamilton but she didn’t really get into that musical.
YAY COLLEENS CORNER 🥳🥳🥳
Men do not have periods. Males do not have vaginas, uteruses or ovaries. So its impossible.
Colleen can you make fairy bread for Flynn, I think he would love it
it would be iconic if you guys dressed up as the schuyler sisters.
The Wizard of Oz!
Waitress
Hello this comment is for Colleen to get her coin
People who ask others when will they have a baby (first or another one, doesn't matter) should really mind their own business. Stop being intrusive, it's not something you can just ask. Colleen responded nicely even tho she didn't have to.
I’ve never clicked so fast
Did she just say.... men have periods
YESSSSSSSS
* men don’t have periods
Colleen please stop with the clickbate we are watching anyway!
Lol NORTHERN Vancouver 😂😂😂😂😂😂 love it. See you soon in North Van!
Love the video!  Always do.  So lovely ❤❤❤❤❤❤
No wayyyy
Flynn is absolutely adorbs. When you do decide to have baby # 2 I’m pretty sure they’ll be adorbs 😍 too!!!!!!!
Colleen looks good in every vid 😊
Lol when I was like 2 I did that to :me has same food as parents  mom : eating :dad eating :me mama dada here want some of my food? :them we have the same food as u :me ......oh STIL. u want any?
Q&A's are my FAV videos to watch!!! you should bring them back :)
Everyone seems to be guessing Hamilton, but I feel like it should be Waitress. I’ve never seen Waitress so I don’t know the characters but that’s my guess
Try natural red! They are cruelty free! Natural red.com
ANGELICA ELIZA and PEGGY.
I can’t imagine not knowing my wedding anniversary! 🙈
please let halloween be newsie themed!!! flynn in that hat i CANNOT
My son is 27 and turned vegetarian at 16. He has gone to vegan this year and it has been really hard for him. Even our holiday food for entire family we made vegetarian.  Not sure the rest of family will go for vegan.It’s definitely harder that’s for sure.
McExcuse me?, men get periods?
colleens corner :)
Everyone: Oooooh! They’re gonna be Eliza, Alexander, and Philip Hamilton!! Eeeeeeeyyyyy!!!!! Me: you sure?  Everyone: Eliza. Alexander. Philip. Hamilton. Me: I don’t know... there are a lot of other musicals out there... They could be- Everyone: THEY MUST BE THE HAMILTONS!!!!!! THEY HAVE TOOOOO!!! Me: alright, whatever you say.  Halloween comes along...  Colleen: Hey guys!! So for our costume we are gonna be Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey!!! Cool, right?! I told you it would be musical-themed!! 😃  Everyone: ....
the movie is:high school musical
I think your family costume is going to be Horton, Gertrude, and the elephant bird ❤️
One eyebrow is shorter than the other
Waitress!!
😀😀😀😂😂😂😂
She finally did a Colleen's Corner without saying that no one would watch it! LOL
The wizard of ozz
Sting cheese tastes better in strings
please don't move to Canada :(
Trump is gonna win tho........
Issue it Hamilton
Can you please not get political anymore it makes your channel harder and harder to watch.
if its not Little Shop of Horrors id be very sad...
Yay thanks for supporting veganism!
Get the magnetic gears that go on the fridge. You can get them on amazon ... he will love it
Guess for family costume: You and Eric are Ogie and Dawn and Flynn is a pie.
I hope it's little mermaid and flynn is flounder
Trump 2020! Keep America free.
You should do Annie for costumes
OMG, Flynn (sorry I thst's not how you spell his name) NEEDS a little/baby brother
Love your cat just sitting in the background being the grumpiest😂
Your the best you make me cry I love you OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think the costume could be Aladdin Jasmine and Abo
I really enjoy your content, for the most part it’s uplifting and encouraging and fun. But super tired of the political comments in all of your videos lately. You are so talented and an inspiration to many, but you have people of diverse backgrounds that watch your content. Keep politics out of it.
did she just say some men have periods?? what???
Hi
beetlejuice! maybe the costume?
I don’t care if People want to be vegan it’s when they Force their pet to be vegan (I know most vegans are not like that it’s just the crazy ones)
Did she just say some men get periods- girl ily but this isn't true
Anyone else get distracted by her bedspread looking like hamburger meat hehe!
I think its good to be vegan but if everyone or most people are vegan there will be over population of animals like cows pigs and fish because no one is eating meat or milk and stuff. Just my opinion dont know if its true
Alexander Eliza and Philip
Waitress! Make Flynn a pie lol..
I feel like,,, you,,, are,,, fitted,,, to,,, attend,,, film,,, school,,,
I like this room as background for videos
My wife also bites into string cheese and it amazes me everyday that we’re still married.
I totally understand what you said about veganism choices. I do that too!! Unfortunately I can never go full vegan because my body needs to the protein from meat because a medical issue. My partner is allergic to all forms of nuts so becoming vegan isn’t ideal for them either. :/
Halloween: little shop of horrors with Seymour, what's her face, and audrey 2
💜🍪🥰
colleen in this vid looks like when she announced her pregnancy
if the costume is not hamilton then i have no idea what it could be lol
Colleen, just stop. You’re so irrelevant nowadays. Sure, in 2016 you were fun to watch but that’s not now. It’s 2020 and you need to stop. Get a proper job and go to work.
Ok well it is starting to get kinda cold in Canada but it would be cute if Flynn plays in snow
i think your halloween costume will be little shop of horrors you as audery flynn as audrey 2 and erik as seymour
Colleen...I love your makeup!  Can you let us know how you did it and the colors used?
I think it’s Romeo and Juliet Alexander Hamilton and Wizard of Oz  and I started crying at the red light part like I’m crying and laughing at the same time lol
Little shop of horrors Audrey, Audrey2, and Seymour
I Love 2015 vibezzz 🥰
I think it confuses, old-fashioned, people because you didn't take Erik's last name.
wHeN YOu'Re  gOnnA bE pregnaNT aGaIn?? *colleen suddenly turns in james charles  Btw ily colleen
If you move to Vancouver were I live I will be so happy
Seymour . Audrey. Audrey 2. 🤞🏼
All your rights are going to be taken away as a woman? 🤦🏻‍♀️🙄 come on...
When I saw your husband for the first time in haters back of as Patrick I saw like "DAVID DOBREK IS THAT YOU????"
“RELAX”😂😂😂😂
Colleen: I’m going to wait to possibly have a baby till after the election because I’m worried that as a woman all my rights are going to be taken away.   Me: 😒 stop saying that Trump will ruin women’s rights! He’s been president for 4 years and you still have your rights. Get over it feminists.
Costume guess- Shyuler sisters
I dont mind vegans as long as they dont feed their pets vegan food. Those people belong in jail 🤮
Love ya!
lmao get married first.
6:53 - 7:06 Colleen is the next eminen!
I.. i bite string cheese
I LITERALLY LIVE GOR Q AND A's PLEASE DO MORE I LOVE THEM I DON'T CARE IF ITS NOT 2015
BEATLEJUICE
TRUMP 2020
If u had a girl call it anicia pronounced (a nee see a)
Even some men have periods? Wtf is she saying
Genuinely curious. If you decide to fully become vegan, does that mean you won’t get vaccinations? Those are typically tested on animals.
Love you girl!!
*Idea for something to write*  COLLEEN  *A NEW MUSICAL*  A musical about your life   Even a musical about Miranda
Hamilton or Waitress Maybeeeeeee
Click bait. All your rights taken away??? Brainwashed narcissistic goof.
HAMILTON COSTUMES PLEASE IT IS MY FAVOURITE MUSICAL EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Born males (those who were born with male parts and not a uterus) don’t have periods.
Halloween Costume  Colleen as Eliza Erik as Alexander  Flynn as Philip
The blanket on the bed looks like ground beef lol
Hi sup
what about vegetarian
I commented.
Wait did I just hear you correctly... some men gets periods? What?
Some men get periods? Someone please educate me I’m so intrigued
Little Shop of Horrors. Where Flynn is the Venus fly trap. That better be what it is
I went vegan in a rural farming town... Not to mention I am from a Catholic german farming family... my high school was in a cornfield with elective mostly in ag....
Eliza Hamilton and Philip boom
Your hair looks sooooo good! <3 I love you
After you said you couldn’t take your first pregnancy haha you can’t lie to your self!! 😂sometimes you want a second and a third lol that happens and I’m all for it!! Go Colleen 😃
Colleen these are the best! Do more please
I used to bite string cheese but that was when I was a toddler. I do it the right way now. 😂
I feel like you could be characters from Beetleguese (I think that's how you spell it?) But I'm not sure what characters you'd be (and I don't know the characters well)
My boys know that girls get periods. They are 8 and 12. I make them get my tampons and I tell them exactly what they are for. I tell them this because when they get older I don't want then to say eewww periods! Kids in my school did when I was younger.. I want them to know its normal and every women has one. Even their future wife. I hope they understand.
Waitress
All of you should just be Froze Toes
I love your videos!! You are taking this pandemic seriously and I can't thank you enough for that!! It's hard to come by unfortunately these days
I think Beetlejuice?
Did she say men have periods!?
You should buy him a rubik’s cube
I think something to help is to start being vegetarian and then work your way up to begin vegan I personally am not vegan but think this might work
Costume Idea: Colleen: Audrey Erik: Seymour Flynn: Audrey II or the dentist
yassssssss do it
You’re not going to lose your rights, relax
i’m gonna guess hamilton or waitress
Waitress
The blaket on the bed looks like ground beef😆
I think it’s wizard of Oz
Breath, your rights won’t be taken way.
Angelica Peggy and Eliza is my guess for your family costume 😂 probably not but that’s my guess 😂
colleen's corner always makes me happy ❤
Who else is so happy that Colleen finally did a Colleen's Corner! 😄🤗
hamilton, eliza, and philip? that would be so cute
I think Angelica Eliza and Peggy
I'm from Canada and I've decided that you are allowed to come to Canada. They keep extending the ban because of the Trump way of not supporting the states get the covid in check. You could also fly here if it was essential travel. We think you should tell them that you are essential to yr fans. I'll vouch for you. Love to you and yr family.
You should be Miranda, Erik can be Patrick and i know this is weird but Flynn could be uncle Jim
Colleen explaining string cheese... Erik: Thanks love 😂
Colleen: He bites into string cheese... Me: WHAAAAAAAATT!!!!! Also Me: I take one bite to help me get the strings going
“I’m really scared all my rights are going to be taken away as a woman” this is too real lc a fear right now 🤦‍♀️😓
Idk why but I can picture Flynn in a pea costume u heard me a PEA
“Relax”- Colleen Ballinger
My son bites cheese string and it’s horrible to watch. That’s not how you do it 😫
Hamilton
it makes me sad that nasty comments worry you so much. You are such a beautiful soul, that does nothing but try to make the world a better place. Do not listen to bullies on the internet. Sending love 💕
Hamilton as the family costume
Mee looking at daisy in the beginning the whole time
I bite into string cheese cause I DIDNT KNEW that it was supposed to be stringed...
"even some men have periods" that is such a validating statement for transmen. Good on you colleen
Men period ? Really ?
I’m here queen
he calls Corey "CoCo?" that is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
I hear ya girl!!!! We literally planned on having baby #3 already. This is the year my youngest would have been going to "real school" ... but then... 2020 happened. A pandemic. An... all the sudden I am homeschooling f*n kids.. I am not. Any. Of. The. Ballinger. family.  I wasn't already headed down this road.... Long story - not having a short story- short.  I'm not pregnant and definitely don't plan on it. Period.  Literally.
Im sorry did you just say that he bites string cheese TAKE A DEEP BREATH ITS GONNA BE OK
Colleen I love you
yes! come to canada!!!❤❤
Colleen as Eliza Hamilton  Erik as Alexander Hamilton  Flynn as Philip Hamilton  I've seen this everywhere and it is such a cute idea
Yes Queen about the vegan talk! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Don’t judge just make your best effort you can in space of life you are in!
Please let it be anything other than Hamilton
I wish I could be vegan! I'm allergic to nuts, most beans, and soy :((
WAIT A DAM MINUTE
Halloween costume is OBVIOUSLY Waitress
Colleen you are awesome ur my favorite
My guess  is idk mabye ....... watresss
MEN do not get a period.
erik and the string cheese GOT ME 😂
Seymore, Audrey, and the plant monster from Little Shop of Horrors. If I’m wrong, I’m gonna be so sad, that would be ADORABLE.
I honestly find it odd that I enjoy her vlogs more than her actual videos😂
Trump2020 baby
So your gonna vote for trump to keep your rights
I think it's going to be Miss Saigon
I think they r going to be Alex, Eliza and Philip from Hamilton  Also last month I had a dream Colleen was pregnant with a girl
Or and easier option would be High School Musical 😊
Being vegan is good but if everyone is vegan then the world will eventually overpopulate with the animals non vegans eat and if everyone is vegan then mabey the fruit and veggies will go down so people being vegan and non vegan is good so there is balance also i am 12 so this is just what I think about it !😀
Waitress
Soo fun
Dorothy, the Tin Man and the Lion from Wizard of Oz ❤️
They will  for SURE get taken away by Joe Biden.
I love u so much and I respect the choices u make and I don’t think people should be hating in that❤️
Halloween costume: Ice, ice and baby water bottle
10:08@thatveganteacher on tiktok be like
PLEASE be Seymore, Audrey, and Audrey 2
I want to be vegan too :(
Pls don’t go vegan I am a dairy farmer and we are trying are hardest to go ethically. We don’t abuse our animals they are our pets and I actually cry when ever they pass away.
I think that when they asked are you married they were confused because in one of your recent vlogs (the one with the picnic at the beach) you asked Erik if he was going to propose to you
Costume- Sweeney Todd(Eric) Lovett(Colleen), and a Meat Pie(Flynn)
since comments are on for now for you search for "cear" toys on amazon. I used to run a childcare and kids of all ages were obsessed with them. they'd play then for 30-60mins easily.
Way to bury the lead! This video should have been titled "I'm going vegan!"
It was several months ago and my period started when I was going #2. I realized what was happening like 2 hours later. My mom now says that when it’s that time of the month it’s like I’m possessed by a demon.  I feel like I’m punched in the crotch when it happens.  It sucks.  I can’t help that I over share at times.  Sorry for too much information!
I love Colleen's Corner cuz watching all her vlogs you just simply know all the answers, SO GO SUBSCRIBE TO HER VLOG CHANNEL <3
Bob's Burgers
Yeah...being pregnant with everything going on right now is weird. You’re making the right call.
please come to canada!!!! we would absolutely love you here <3
I could never be vegan! I love meat!
Spongebob
please do Hamilton for Halloween!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Yesssss throwback! We love Colleen’s corner
It’s Tuesday
What's Flynn favorite color
The terrible twos aren’t that terrible. It’s the threenager you need to worry about.
men and periods Colleen???🤔
Phantom of the Opera
I some what agree, but I have to have meat in my diet because of my colitis..
Omg im from canada!
Hamilton?????
There is this toy that my little brother has that is a toy dog that comes with a wrench and you take the dog apart and back together again. I think that Flynn would really like it!!!!!
i ahve a neighbor shes 7 and she wont peel her string cheese
love you!
Fav types of vid tbh
Omg he calls kory koco I cant- ❤️❤️ that’s amazing
Veganish choices 2020
I just realized that Flynn is almost 2 yrs old. He is almost ready for pre school ( Not telling that Flynn HAS to go to pre school, just a thought I had)🥳🥳🥳🥳
Fun Fact: Cows have evolved over the years. They now produce more milk than a calf can drink. If the calf doesn’t drink all the milk the cow will get very sick because of the extra milk. So farmers help the cows and give milk to hydrate the world.
Hi Mrs.Ballinger, my name is Camilla Chavez. My cousin has just started her modeling career, she doesn’t even have an agent. I was just hoping that if you ever want more pictures for your merch, she could do the job. I know that this would be one in a million chances if you even respond. She has watched you for a while now and I know she would love this opportunity. Her birthday is December 12th and I would like to give her the best present I can. She will be turning 14. I know that you and your family modeled for your merch, and I completely understand if you want to keep it that way. I just recently came up with this idea, I haven’t even told her mother. I have her headshots if you want them. I know this is asking for a lot, but if there is even the slightest possibility of you wanting more photos, I hope you would consider her. Thank you so much!
“If they’re not Erik Stocklin” 😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺 YOU TWO ARE SO CUTE
The safest spot in Canada is within the Maritime bubble! Would love to have you in Nova Scotia!
Vegan for the planet & 🐖🐄🐑🐐🐓🦃 🍉🍍🍌🥦🌱🌿
Start by not running the shower for 30 hours will you record a video. Jesus f ING Christ.
Me saying the story of why Colleen’s corner started cause I know it by heart now.
Eliza hamilton, Philip would be cute
Colleen if u move to Canada Flynn won't be able to see his cousins that often😭
awh no more cute babies :(
OMG I LIVE IN VANCOUVER PLS MOVE HERE I WOULD DIE TO MEET U!
I definitely think the theme is Hamilton! I love you, your videos, and ur fam! 💕💕💕
I support you Colleen and everyone supports you in your fandom even though……… HAVE ANOTHER BABY🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩
I have a friend that swallows her string cheese whole!
Even if you aren't you  be little shops of horror characters  for halloween! Flynn would be the cutest plant, Eric would be the perfect Simore and you would make the best Audry!
If you move to Vancouver, you’ll have to start calling it north van 😝 no one says ‘northern Vancouver’- but I’m sure you’re in the know already!
I have a little cousin who just turned 2 and I feel like he reminds ME SO MUCH OF FLYNN, 2 year olds can definitely be a big handful, BUT THEY ARE SOOOO FUN
I will be the first to say I am a non vegan and I respect those who make the choice to go vegan but sometimes I feel like vegans are pushing their lifestyle in my face
I'm sorry BITES STRING CHEESE!?!?   I-
try vegetarian it is also good but you don't have to give up milk butter and ice cream
there’s actually toys like a little tots worktable/toddler workbench something like that. my brother had it growing up bc he was the same as Flynn. he grew up working on dirt bikes when he was old enough too.  i feel like flynn would like something like that!
Social Baby of the year
costume ideas   hamilton eliza philllip
Omg your first period story sounds like mine except I was in grade 4! "I keep getting skid marls but I don't remember having an accident or need to go the the bathroom!! "
Hamilton
Why did I think of the lion king when Colleen said that they were doing a family costume.
NO BIOLOGICAL MAN HAS A PERIOD. PERIODT.
I hope your all happy, healthy, safe, and successful now and in your future ❤️😁💗
THE COSTUME I THINK IS HAMILTON! So you all dress up as Hamilton characters
When she said accident baby I said girl  you naughty
Please tell me you’re being the plastics from mean girls
Click bait much lol
Hamilton Eliza phillip
Hamilton!!!
I think the halloween costume idea will be something to do with HAMILTON
Nah I bite my string cheese
I’m here girlie anxiety gang 😉
I would love to see you guys do a Sweeney Todd family costume 😆
Me: bites string cheese Her: That ain’t right Me:😰
I love you Colleen, as a community of fans we shouldn’t pressure you into getting pregnant! Also who really cares if you are a meat eater or vegan, as long as you make good moral nice decisions, and are healthy as well!
Halloween idea  Mike💚 Sully💙💜 Boo❤️❤️❤️
CATS
I used to be OBSESSED with cars and I would get down on the floor and play with my 400+ cars (you heard me right. Get ready for that) to see it roll by. I have always really liked cars, trains, and planes and now I want to be an airline pilot so Flynn will probably be really interested in stuff like that in the future.
The wizard of OZ
You should make Flynn a sensory wall with gears, switches, and buttons
I got my period for the first time a month a go for the first time
YESSSS VEGAN COLLEEEENNNN.
Thank you for making me smile :)
I think baby 2 is gonna be a boy🙂💙💙
The part where she said she is scared all her rights are gonna be taken away are gonna happen if Biden wins the election. I know she meant Trump because she’s OBVIOUSLY a liberal because she lives in California and also she’s said very liberal statements in the past which is why I don’t subscribe to her not because she’s a bad person but because I don’t agree with most of her points and I don’t care to hear them anymore but Biden and the Left are the ones who are gonna take away our rights.
Colleen, you are a very smart woman and you dont have to feel pressured into having a baby and doing certain things your fans expect you to do. You know when you are ready to do certain things. Just know that I LOVE you so so much. I feel like you could be my aunt or something.    Your loving 12 year old,                           Winnie
come to australia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we are cool😂😂🤣🤣🤣😎
Ughhhh when he says koko 😭❤️
My dad bites into string cheese and we've had that EXACT CONVERSATION with him SO MANY TIMES
I think your Halloween Broadway theme is going to be the one you did in New York, The Waitress(?).
Colleen gave us such a clear example of what goes on in her brain on a daily basis when she was telling us the tremendous amount of people asking her about another baby and I loved it bc i could understand every single word 😂. For some reason I think the Halloween costume is  who you were in Waitress and the little family you had but i doubt it
I think it’s Annie
Peep the Molly Burke Nair commercial
Hamilton for hollowen
Ok what man has ever had a period? Not including trans ppl I mean sis male.
I think "Angelicaaaaaaaa, Elizaaaaaaa, AND PEGGY!"is your Halloween costume or Eliza, Phillip and a.ham
Some men? 😂
If you're looking for good toys for mechanical stuff, Lego and marble runs are really great
My first period was on a saturday to Lol
For Halloween: waitress or wicked.... But with koko rent? 😂♥️
HAMILTON
COLLEEEEN I SUPPORT U IN TRANSITIONING TO VEGANISM. I SUPPORT U!!! u go glenn coco
I only bite string cheese
You could do Hamilton for your costume and Eric could be Alexander Hamilton you could be Elizabeth Skyler and Flynn could be Phillip Hamilton
I bite string cheese as well like the cherry Twizzlers that you can pull apart I just bite into. So I am glad Im not alone
BE DAWN AND OGIE AND A PIE OR THE CAT SARDINE
Hamilton
I love you Colleen so much your so nice and funny and please never stop YouTube
(Colleen) jasmine (Eric). Aladdin (Flynn). Abu
This was posted on Tuesday
Coleens Corner! I love that!! 💗💗
Eliza, Phillip, and Alexander from Hamilton
You are allowed in Canada a girl I watch on YouTube just went
Theater hmm.... I know it’s waitres
I wish I could move to Canada to live there forever
I bet they are being Hamilton for Halloween.
Wait, they are married...but they did it in their house one evening after dinner..she made it sound like they just decided and did it the same eve..but she must mean they decided during dinner one night and then planned it??
I guess I'm old school I love Q&As
Me
I live in Canada it is amazing I think you should move here to Ontario
Flynn’s showing you his love language, it’s quality time!!!(: I love that!
I missed colleens corner
I’m not gonna become vegan, I just need to limit the un healthy stuff I eat.... heh ;-;
I think you should be proud of how much you talk to Flynn and include him in the things you do day to day.  That def shows in how much he talks and is able to think outside of himself.  Kudos to you and Erik for the way you are raising him.
My friend does the same thing she BITES  into string cheese
You also haven't updated us on the writing since then.
Daisy in the back is everything for me
Beatle juice or Hamilton!!!
How on earth are your rights going to be taken away as a female? You’re certainly educated to talk about a lot of stuff but I don’t think politics is one of them if you’re are just going to make sweeping statements like that.
I jus realized that daisy was in the back on the bed LMFAOAOA SHE JUST THERE
I bite into string cheese lol
“I mean I do love him (to McDonald’s employee), I love everyone.” That’s one of the cutest and genuine statement I heard in a long time. ❤️
I have to say, EVERY stage is the best! Seriously, every stage I'd think stop growing! I love this stage, I don't want it to end! But then the next stage would be THE BEST STAGE lol! Enjoy it!
h
Vancouver is amazing
Does anyone know how old collen is?🤷🏼‍♀️
Has to be Hamilton.
Man she did a good job click baiting this video😂😂
I love how this video is filmed in a bedroom with the bed in the background 😛
That vegan teacher needs to hear what she said about veganism 😂
My son does the bite thing with string cheese. Where did I go wrong?
Colleen, are you gonna be a mom that is strict with grades and grounds them when they don’t get an A?
I think you will dress up as Either Hamilton or waitress
also i support your choice of food,i would never judge someone like that,you are n amazing person colleen and tell flynn(flinn...i cant spell it)and erik that i hope you and your family are doing well in this covid crap,colleen I love you,love your family to <3
Almond milk is actually terrible for the environment (worse than cow milk I think) - Oat milk is the most environmentally friendly
I ABSOLUTELY know what you being for Halloween "Angelica, ElIzA, And Peggy"
Please let the Halloween costume be Little Shop of Horrors with Flynn being a baby Audrey II.
God bless remember God love u gave his own son to die for u and he made u
Waitress
Hamilton
I bite into it...
I think Eliza, Hamilton and Philip
Hamilton 10000000% you CANT tell me I’m wrong oml   Colleen: Eliza Erik: Alexander Flynn: Philip  Like cmonnnn
What about applying for Refugee status? Do you want to be our nanny so that you have a work permit?
Colleen: it might happen on accident 😳. Me: Ik what you did last summer
Almond milk isn’t great for the environment either. It takes a lot of water to produce it
well then...i did not know that they made vegan butter.or that butter is made out of meat!!?!
Omg yessss Colleen’s Corner is backkkkk!!!!!!!
Yay my hometown!!
I live in Hamilton Ontario!!!
Maybe Flynn will end being like Jacob and build little mechanical things?
Colleen: "Why do you guys keep saying I won't look good in bangs" Also Colleen: 0:09
You guys should dress up as the little shop of horrors characters
7:25 I agree the politics lately have been scary and I’m personally also waiting to make a few bigish decisions and I’m scared about my rights as a woman too. Hopefully America pulls through though. And also with the vegan stuff I’m not quite there either but I am trying to go plastic free which has similar benefits, I think you should try plastic free for a while Colleen.
When I saw the title I was like AHHHHH EEEKKK
I was thinking you guys would be something related to either Hamilton or Waitress
If you move to Canada will Kory move in with you/move their with you
Hamilton cast eliza phillop and hamilton
i know so many people have said this but BE THE HAMILTON FAMILY I STG
Horton Gertrude and the Elephant bird???????
No one is trying to take away your rights.
You should do a Miranda Sings graphic novel
Hamilton!!!
I’ve been vegan for 4 years now. I have two boys (5 and 18 months) and also raising them on a plant based diet. Educating yourself and making those little changes is amazing! Thank you
U can’t remember the date u got married! 🥺
I feel personally attacked by your stance on string cheese and your disdain for us biters. 😆
I LOVE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT VEGANISM!!!!!! I was vegan for a while and I was definitely the super annoying, very strict vegan and then I started having some health issues and it was very important that i had food that would help sustain my body. i realized that being considerate to veganism while also understanding that im living i a non-vegan world is important and that even eating vegan for even just a few days out of each week can still make a huge impact over time!
I'm a vegetarian and it took me a really long time to cut out meat from my diet. I first became a pescetarian because I don't like the taste of pork, chicken, and turkey. I then eventually cut out seafood. Next, I stopped eating eggs. The easiest part for me was switching to oat milk and vegan butter because I can't taste a difference from cows milk. I still eat cheese and sometimes I'll eat prepared foods that contain regular milk and butter on occasion. It was hard at times and everybody reacts differently to changes in a food diet. I'm the kind of vegetarian who will inform people by giving them resources if they want it. I don't force anybody. I just do me and you can do whatever you want and we'll see what happens.
abortion is not a right!!!!!
ALEXANDER ELIZA AND PHILP!!
Colleen, I clicked faster than jojo siwa says her intro 😂 I know you have talked about not wanting to be pregnant again so the first thing I thought was OMG THEY'RE ADOPTING A BABY IT'S TIME😍😍
to whomever reads this: I hope you have a great day! *P.S. would love your support in subscribing to us will sub back <3*
Btw, almond milk is terrible for the environment  because of the amount of water used. Just here to educate not to shame!
I don't want her to move 😩
I think it’s Hamilton alaxander Eliza and Phillip omg I love your channel
I love how unproblematic you are
when I was little my mom bought my brother and I a "work shop."  it had screws you can screw into things, hammers and screw drivers, all of that stuff .I think flynn would like something like that. (it was all made out of plastic)
I can’t stop thinking your blanket looks like ground meat
Maybe Hamilton
Your sister is not a vegan 😂 she eats eggs
give a like if you love flynn
you ask her your questions and she replies her answers are lame but at least she tries COLLEENS CORNER !!!! MY childhood!!!!! i swear i use to get excited because i knew every tuesday she would upload a video. i miss it
I have huge anxiety
I love Colleen’s corner
colleen try to be vegetarian i am!
Never clicked so fast!!!
Wait, you said some men have periods??
All your rights taken away?? 😂 you are so dramatic 🙄
I'm not trying to be unsupportive of people that want to be vegan becuase I think that's fine, I just think that being vegan isn't going to help the environment becuase if everyone in the world became vegan, people would still have to kill all the left over animals otherwise they would breed, and become uncontrollable, then people will have to kill all the animals that were breed for food all around the globe, which to me sounds worse than letting animals have a bit of a life, then going to a good use when there killed, also not eating meat is extremely unhealthy for your body, there's no way you would be able to eat equivalent amount of iron in veggies that you get from meat, which our body's really need.
I think you need to have a Hamilton Halloween costume
Colleen, ADOPT! its okay if you dont want to be pregos! JUST ADOPT!
❤❤❤
Idk why I immediately thought into the woods?
i think youre costumes will be hamilton theam
you're going as Dawn, Ogie and a Pie for halloween
(this is before i watch the whole video) girl name for baby w middle name   Naomi Rose Ballinger - Rosie   Isebella Colette Ballinger  nickname - Izzy Coco Bella  Peyton Laynn Ballinger nick name- peydie pie   and boy names w middle name   Andrew Chase Ballinger nick name - Drew or  Drew-drew  Evan Henry Ballinger   Rowan William Ballinger nick name - Ro-Ro
Changing your diet doesn’t help save the planet. It doesn’t matter if you eat meat or not. Driving an electric car is the answer either. There simply not enough lithium on earth to make enough electric cars for everyone in the United States to have one. Not everyone can ride a bike everywhere. If you want to help save the planet then stop by a bunch crap that you don’t need that you just throw away.
That is one of my pet peeves bitting string cheese
Hamlton!!!!!
I live in Canada the weather is so nice.. and cold
I bit into string cheese before
Seymour, Audrey and Audrey 2!
HAMILTON  Colleen- Eliza Hamilton Erik- Alexander Hamilton Flynn- Phillip Hamilton
I bet the family costume is waitress or Succical the Musical
This video today got me thinking if you bit the whole entire string cheese stick would it taste worse?
Your rights as a woman? Are you kidding me? The only right you'd lose is to abort your baby after its a viable human being that could survive ourside the womb.  You've gone so far left you're going to fall into the ocean.  And I see now, you are not an American, you're a canadian.   So go.  Have to give up on you.  I see now what they mean by white privledge.   Your left's thinking has destroyed california and now you want out.
Cruelty free is great and it makes you feel like you're doing something right
Where are my anxiety brother and sisters at!
I’m “veganish”... that’s a great way to phrase it!
I really hope Baiden wins elections
People have GOT TO STOP saying that Trump is the worst president. The media makes him look bad and that's why people fall for evrry single negativd thing told about him. He's not the brightest, well all know that. But he is definitely not the worst
I love in vancouver and Colleen and the Ballingers are the only ones I will accept to come over
I think what people mean asking  if you are “actually married” is are you “legally married”
I'm vegan and I just hit one year!!! :D
He bites into string cheese! WHAT!
Men have periods? Yikes. I understand what you're saying but what about younger people who don't know that you mean transgender men. Being more specific, and saying transgender men, would be a lot better. I'm not here to judge anyone's life style, that's not my job, but that's just false information.
hmailton?
To anyone in the vegan journey who loves the flavor of cow milk- Did you just decide to give it up or did you find another milk that fills that craving? That and giving up chicken (especially BBQ chicken) are the hardest parts for me.
You should get certified to foster or foster-adopt all the training is online right now so it’s the best time to get certified. You don’t need to start accepting placements but that way you’ll be ready when you want to.
ahem excuse me why are you still married to a person who bites string cheese. I feel personally offended...
Yes Hamilton
Are you dressing up as Seymour (Erik), Audrey (you) and Audrey II (Flynn)? Or maybe the Heathers?
Beetle juice?
I eat my string cheese like Erik does :)
Colleen- Eliza Eric- Hamilton Flynn- Phillip Jessica- angelica  Rachel- Peggy  And all the family can all be other characters
I know you probably won't see this :(. BUT i love you and your videos so much! I feel like every time I watch your videos (especially vlogs) I am right there with you!!
I know you probably won't see this :(. BUT i love you and your videos so much! I feel like every time I watch your videos (especially vlogs) I am right there with you!!
Wow, she still uses that old intro...
Yess! Keep doing these :)
I want this channel to get to 10M! Can you imagine how happy she will be? That will make her 2020 and hopefully realize we do appreciate her content!
YOU HAVE TO BE ELIZA HAMILTON AND PHILLIP OR SOMETHING FROM WAITRESSS OR UM........
I think it's going to be Hamilton themed which I LOVE!! I am a Hamilfan through and through!
Omg i love her and how she doesnt like trump 🤣🤣🤣
Go ask Nikocado Avocado about being vegan lol.
PLEASE move to CANADA Colleen. I live in Alberta and it is great here
Your right will not be taken away easily. Idk what rights youre talking about tho 🤷‍♀️ if they haven’t been taken away yet there’s not much plan for that to happen.
YES Colleen!! Come on over to Canada :) you will be very welcome
I love you
What rights?
Hey, Colleen! Hope you're well!!
Is your Halloween costume going to be from hamilton
Totally agree about veganism. Btw, I have been known to bite stringcheese😄😄😄💜💜💜
I think being vegan is awesome but why would god put animals on earth for us not to eat? We would be over populated
Who cares about other YouTubers, they all have the same content, you have some of the best content I’ve seen and your videos are an escape from the real world!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you gurl
Do you REALLY think your rights are going to be taken away....c’mon....
I had PPD really bad and even during my pregnancy as well it really sucks
If you are planning a baby,why are you doing thison Youtube now shouldn't you be doing something else?😎😘
It sounds like Flynn would be really into those gear based kids toys. You can get boards with wooden or plastic gears and a handle to turn one to make them all move together, or sets to make your own gear pattern. I think he’d really be into that since he likes the mechanical side of cars and the movement of the wheels!
Hamilton, Eliza, Philip!!!!! Oh please!!!
The clickbate titles are really annoying. How many times are you gonna tease that you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant?!?!
Anxiety sister here!!
*Me, who also bites string cheese:* 😶
It’s Impossible for a boy to have a period.
“That’s not cute” 😂😂😂😂
Les Mis. Flynn could be gavoroche and you and Eric could be me and mrs thenardier
Plzzzzz tell me Flynn’s gonna be a pie?!??
My hope is not that we all become vegans, but that we start making the production and prosses of animal products more human and eco friendly
Trump can’t take away your rights, that’s not how it works. 🙄
Wicked or Dear Evan Hanson 🤔
I want to see how Eric reacts with a baby girl
You should move to Canada. that's where I live!!
my guesses for the halloween costumes:  -little shop of horrors erik as seymour, colleen as audrey and it would be funny if flynn was audrey II  -hadestown all 3 of y’all as the fates lol or erik as hades, colleen as persephone and idk what flynn would be but maybe a little orpheus. i think he’ll look cute
COLLEEN PLS KEEP US IN YOUTUBE 2015 I DONT LIKE 2020 LMFAO
I think the group costume is Gertrude, Horton, and the elephant bird. From Seussical.
I just love this hair length on Colleen!!
Hamilton
Men don’t have periods. Period.
8:58 i thought that was normal 😅
I think you might be from the lion king
waitress costumes?
I saw the title and was like ahhhh
My diet is 80% vegan and sometimes I feel like it is not enough but I am seeing results both physically and emotionally and although I could be doing better I still think it makes a good impact for animals and the earth. I agree that something is better than nothing! Hopefully vegans and non vegans can work together to make the earth healthier and animals safer. A little goes a long way.
Trump 2020 in you want freedom
Why are people putting so much pressure on her to get pregnant she just had a baby who isn’t even two.. like..? She has answered us soo many times and she is her own person. She will let us know when she’s ready
Confession: I too bite my string cheese. It taste better that way 100%.
i only bite into the string a cheese if it doesn’t let me string it
Eric Ariel and flounder 😊 THAT WOULD BE AMAZING....... just saying.......
Hamilton!!
I think you are going to dress up as characters from wicked. Lions and tigers and bears OH MY
You are going to be people from Waitress?
Family of cacti 🌵🌵🌵
My aunt was 17 When she got her period
How does Erik eat KitKats??
I feel like I really need to educate myself on why being vegan is better for the planet (for a while i just didn’t get it at all). So please talk about it 😂 I don’t like almond milk but I bought Oat milk and am trying that! Taking it one step at a time!
The part you came here for... 6:45
You’re just such a good human!
For your family costume I’m thinking Alexander Eliza and Phillip from Hamilton
“some men have periods” what
Colleen I think you can travel to Canada if it's for moving there, I think that counts as essential travel... You should look into it, you will probably need to self-quarantine for 2 weeks tho but I mean you guys should be used to that by now 😅
Become Flynn for halloween
I think you are going to be a family dinner because of waitress
You make me laugh so much. I love watching you.
You always say “no one wants q&a’s” LIES I love your q&a’s 🤣
Guys have periods too?? 🤯🤯
Spoiler: there is no plan for baby #2 saved your time!
Flynn needs trains and railroad tracks. So much for him to figure out with those.
Love you
It’s definitely Hamilton
When your realize that The Handmaid's Tale is coming true and moving to Canada is no longer an option. Can so relate. On the other hand, I feel like peeling string cheese instead of just biting it like other food is gross and ridiculous.
My daughter started doing that hug thing at 1..with the excited shake/hold/early stemming signs....she's now 8..we call it stemming. #autism the signs were there so early....good luck!
I love your QnA’s
Maybe Hamilton Eliza and Philip
i think it’s gonna be the Schuyler sisters, (hamilton) or heathers!
To be honest I don’t really know how I feel about you moving to Canada. I’m Canadian and in one of your other videos I heard you talking about it like it was so much better that the US but Canada is not this perfect place. Do you even understand the political climate here?
Yeh i just recently found out my sister was pregnant and she like 9 weeks. And she has a one year old and I’m hoping she has a girl this time since she already has a boy 😁
I’m with Eric. I bite the string cheese, too. It’s too much work to string the cheese. Just eat it.
Canadians for da wiiiiiin!
My friend used to bite into a two finger Kitkat without halving it and I genuinely couldn’t sit and watch her eat it - FEEAARR
Flin should be a pumpkin 🎃
Musical: Hamilton Erik: Alexander Colleen: Elizz Flyn(n): Philip
I CLICKED WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT
Do you ever think that you will go back to haters back off
I have the worst anxiety and now and medicine
HAMILTON!
I think your costume is going to be Seussical:  Gertrude, Horton, and the Elephant Bird Baby
Little mermaid costumes idea
Wizard of oz
COVID-19 has affected my anxiety so so bad! Like in Scotland we’re allowed to meet up outside or in  a pub/restaurant/cafe - but not in a car? Hello! I don’t like a lot of human interaction sometimes🙃 but to see people I need to go to places with crowds and it’s not fair!
All of these Hamilton guesses as costumes, Y'all know there are ALOT of musicals on Broadway.... But like the Hamilton outfits would be cute
Eating a veggie burger. Messed up and added cheese  oops but I'm trying lol
Love everything you said about veganism. I wish more people viewed it like that. Figure out what works best for you, but don't judge others for what works best for them :)
2:31...what...
I was 14 too when I had my period. I was shunned because if it was later than 12 then you're not fertile and you aren't a real woman... so... that hit me hard because I wanted to be part of the woman club lol
I’m sure it’ll be Hamilton themed 😂
My mom just had a 10 pound baby
Waitress pls
i got my period at 9 😭💀
Daisy in the background be like  😎 😺
love u
“Most girls have periods and some men have periods” YES THE TRANS INCLUSIVENESS 🤩
me clicking this video knowing it's click bait but still wanting it to be true 😭🙏🏼🥺
Men can't get periods...??
My guess for your costumes:  Little shop of horrors with Flynn being one of the plants!
“no one wants q&a’s” I WANT THEM!!!!!
MOVE TOO VICTORIA B.C!!!!!!!!!   IT IS PERFECTTTTTTTTTTT
Bravo to making our own choices and to each their own when it comes to how they want to eat in life. Scientifically-speaking though, without pasture-raised animals and their manures as well as wild animals dying naturally, we wouldn't have enough nutrients in the soil to support the amount of farmed crops that we would need to sustain our food needs should everyone become vegan. Most plants farmed for human consumption are heavy feeders and rely on living soil microbes to process nutrients that plants can use to grow.  Also, humans need B-12 and lots of fats to support their "big brains" (thank you evolution!) and B-12 comes naturally from meat, eggs and dairy sources only. Thus, it's important to supplement with B-12 if you eat a vegan diet. Just my $0.02.
Flynn needs some gear toys!!
Please tell me how Donald Trump would take away all your rights as a woman. Please don’t... just don’t.
I am vegan
Oh my god my husband does the same thing with string cheese! Why do they do that?!?!
I think your costume is Angelica Eliza and Peggy from Hamilton
The Waitress? Or Alexander, Eliza, and Philip
Colleen as Miranda Erik as Patrick Flynn as a froze toes🤍🤍
bet costume is schylar sisters
Angelica, Eliza and Peggy. That’s your costume.
I CLICKED SO FAST!!!!! OMGGGG
Your stories about Flynn are so cute 🥺 He's the sweetest little thing ❤
The psychoanalysis of why Flynn likes trucks >>> 🤩
the noise daisy made at the end sent me
Another dramatic political video from Colleen🤣🤣🤣 “My rights are going to be taken away from me as a women”
I love ur COLLEEN CORNERS
I have angzidy
baby number 2 deets at 6:30
Hey girl, where is your phone case from?
PLEASE BE HAMILTON
Random question I’m new to this channel is kori collens brother
COLLEN’S CORNER YASSSSS.
First collens corner! I loved it! You can do more if you want, lol or have time for!
Amazing 🤩😅🤩
What’s a dealbreaker in a relationship? “If you’re not Erik Stocklin” If that’s not true love idk what is🥰🥰
Who taking women's right away?? Yeah if biden wins I would agree. 🤔😒
I can't agree more with your sentiment regarding making changes where and when you can in your diet/what you purchase in order to support the environment and animals. That's fantastic! Great job for trying where you can, I think that's amazing. I had a similar sentiment a few years ago, where I realized I should start making small changes where I could, and that led to bigger changes slowly and over time!
Your right vote for Biden and all your rights will be taken away... in fact we will probably see civil war if Biden becomes president. Scary
I don’t know why I LOVE these videos!! I mean I love them all but these ones are soooo good! I love these, the psychic ones, and well... basically all of them :D I don’t know my point of writing this comment is so I guess I’ll just say thanks for keeping me entertained during these times 😊
The costume is prob. Waitress
YALL ARE GONNA BE SWEEY TODD
the wizard of oz?? idk
I am one of your sisters with anxiety but I also have adhd and I have some ocd
You should get him a work bench or something like that. My nephew has a construction bench with gears and tools and nails that they can put together. They can put the gears together to make them move .

I eat string cheese the same way lol I’m sorry
Thank you so much for what you said about being vegan. I feel like the "all or nothing" mentality around not just being vegan, but everything nowadays, is so strong. People think that if they can't be 100% vegan all the time then it's not even worth trying. Guys, making small decisions whenever you can or whenever you remember to is still helping! If you decide to use Vegan butter instead of normal butter one day but then use non-vegan butter the next day, that's ok! It's better to do that than to have the non-vegan butter twice.
I love Canada I'm in Halifax
As a vegan I just wanna say that I believe we’re all on our own journey, and that veganism isn’t for everyone at this time at least. I love being vegan, and I think that’s the key for having it work for you. I don’t believe in “bullying” anyone into this lifestyle. I like treating animals and humans with kindness regardless.   If someone else goes vegan, good for them, and the animals lol. Mostly to me it feels more peaceful and I’m all for promoting peace, so I don’t believe in aggressive conversion tactics. You cannot be the light and hold another in darkness. If you want to become vegan Colleen, I recommend you do it for the love of the planet and not for feeling bad for the planet. You know, inspiration vs motivation. Lol sorry for the long comment, love you!
i live in Canada🇨🇦
Hi! If anyone is reading this and believes that women’s rights matter or you are a woman I just want to say I’m worried too, but hopefully everything will work out! Have a great day!
I don’t understand why if you’re sooo scared about getting pregnant and are always taking a pregnancy test, don’t you DO something about it instead of getting scared every month??
HE BITES INTO STRING CHEESE?!?!?!?!?! no just no lol Ilysm Colleen!
Why do I fell like the costume is heathers or scyler sisters
Oh! My! Gosh! i clicked so fast 😂
My ideas for the costumes is waitress
I bite into string cheese too lol 😂
I think the family costume is Hamilton but I could be wrong, Phillip, Alexander, and Eliza! Or it could be the schuyler sisters!   Edit: I just checked this and it has lot of likes! Thanks!
Colleen I think the person asking the question meant to say are you "legally" married, rather than "actually" married.
I'm curious if you kept your last name or took Erik's?
Had my first boy in April.💙👣 Definitely was scary having him during this insane time.
ANXIETY GIRL RIGHT HERE
BOYS DONT HAVE PEROIDS
Are you guys going to be Angelica, Eliza and Peggy for Halloween. Or at least something from Hamilton?
Little Shop of Horror Flynn is Audrey #2 👀👀👀👀
Just a few days ago I randomly started singing the jingle for Colleen’s Corner. Sis, am I psychic 😯
I also bite into string cheese 😬 hahah
when colleen said mum instead of mom it made my british heart all a flutter
I support you in your plant-based journey, sis ♥️
Sweeney Todd
Do you know what’s so weird I was just wondering why you don’t want to Colleens corner anymore lol and this video pops up!!! Lol
It's so amazing that you're making conscious changes towards veganism. I'm vegan, and I totally agree that other vegans can be very toxic. Thank you for doing your best, it definitely helps
i know it’s def. not gonna happen but you & eric as seymour and audrey with flynn as an audrey ii would be so cute
I admire the way you talked about being vegan!! Thank you for trying to open up peoples minds the best you can for the environment and for themselves!!❤️
I think the costumes and Alexander  Hamilton Eliza and bbn Philip
"Some men have periods."  LOL!
As long as trump wins we will all have our rights as woman! So trump 2020!
Colleen saying she might go vegan has me happpeeee
i reckon yalls are doing Beetlejuice.
Audrey, Seymour, and Audrey II
Hamilton - peg Eliza and Angelica
I bite into string cheese too! lolololol :) Love you little Flynnie!!
I think the person asking if you and Erik are married was wondering if it was legal because of how the ceremony went.  Not traditional and that person probably got confused.
God loves you Jesus died for you and your sins ✝️❤️✝️😃 VOTE TRUMP😁🇺🇸
Colleen I understand. Maybe start with vegetarianism? I also wanted to be vegan and help the environment but I just can’t give up cheese lol. I don’t eat meat and I think it’s easier to start with that before completely shutting out beautiful eggs and dairy
You don't have to get pregnant just adopt
vbggmb
I love these videos
helloween costume  waitress or hamilton
yay colleen posted
#miniflynn
I love Daisy! 💕
I have no problem with vegans I will probably never become vegan just cause I love meat and dairy but i don't think it's fair for some vegans to try to make everyone vegan (not saying you are cause you're not!) cause like you said a lot of people have trouble going vegan and they just have to have that protein. I think being vegan is so controversial from that vegan teacher on tik tok. I don't support her but I am PERFECTLY fine with other vegans and am totally fine with you becoming vegan if you want to :) <3
the baker, the baker's wife, and the magic bean from into the woods.
Girl we all follow your vlogs skip to the story
"If they are not Erik Stocklin, that is a deal breaker" THAT IS SO FREAKIN SWEET AND CUTE AND ADORABLE OMG
I think you will dress up as Maisie, Horton and the elephant bird!!! It would be awesome.
I think flynn would like gear type toys later on. Where you out plastic gears on a board and they move together.
Please tell me you are gonna be Alexander Hamilton, Eliza, and Phillip. PLEASE.
Oh my goodness don’t be scared your rights will be taken away if Biden gets elected, I don’t think he’ll win. And you’re safe if trump wins because he’s been president for four years and you still have your right😉👍🏼
i would love to have you in vancouver bc it would be amazing having you hear
AWWW that last question 😂😂😂😂
I think you guys are dressing up as characters from hamilton.
PLEASE DO NOT COME TO CANADA. Every single new Covid case from the past month where I live in Canada has been from Americans coming here. Stay home.
Nobody: Colleen: I feel like all my rights are gonna be taken away as a women  Me: 😳 sh*t just got real.
I can see Flynn being a lot like Jake when he gets older. Like how Jake is all into legos and building and mechanics
They are going to dress up as Hamilton characters because they love Hamilton
I agree with everything you said, especially politically, and also, I bite string cheese too… Yay Eric! LOL
There is a toy that is like a car that you can take apart and put back together.
I bet you’ll do Little Shop of Horrors family costume: You-Audrey  Eric-Seymour  Flynn-The Plant
Flynn 2020 😂
Ah! I’m so excited to see your Halloween costumes this year! 💙😄
omg she almost 9,000 million subers
How would you lose all your rights as a woman? If you’re saying you’re afraid of Trump being re-elected that makes no sense. He is president now and you still have all your rights.
i think their family costume is gonna be dawn and ogie and their baby from waitress!!
Here I am sis of anxiety
I think maybe the reason that someone asked if you two were married is because you made a tik tok of all the dresses you didn't get to wear in 2020 and the last one was a wedding dress
OMG COLLEEN YOUR LITERALLY GETTING MORE BEAUTIFUL EVERYDAY ( NO CAP IM BEING HONEST ). I HOPE YOU MOVE TO CANADA BECAUSE I DESPERATELY WANT TO MOVE TO ICELAND OR CANADA BECAUSE IM LGBTQIA+ AND I WANT MY RIGHTS AND YOU DESERVE THEM TOO. WE ALL DO.
Flinn is a lot like mynson. He moved from cars and trucks to transformers, it combined robots and vehicles and he is wholly obsessed. Lol Flinn may go the same way. My son is also into the technical side of it and loves to build and create transformers also, like crazy amazing ones. Hes 6.
I was confused about if you was married as well but because you are, are you colleen Ballinger - Stockling or just Ballinger?
I think you will be Hamilton
being vegan isn’t just good for the planet, it’s very good for your health
babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy yyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy
Colleen, Idk about everyone else but my favourite videos are q&a's and girl talk videos.
I hope you have another baby ! Look at how adorable Flynn is 💚
I bite string cheese sorry lol
I don't mean to sound nieve but what do you mean by "some men have periods"? Do you mean people born as women that identify as men? Not trying to offend anyone, just trying to understand.
Do you know who That Vegan Teacher is? Because she curses and people on tiktok and says anyone can be vegan and to suck it up! When there are people who can't be vegan because of medical reasons
hi i'm  a big fan first comment i love you
Ha ha, No patients for string cheese I bite straight into it. Little stringy pieces of cheese is NO BUENO!!!
Even if there wasn't quarantine I would not be celebrating Halloween this year but I can't wait to see your family costumes.
Please try to get a video of Flynn doing that on one of your next videos or vlogs! That would be amazing to see!!😍😂
i don’t have a problem with vegans, i have a problem with thatveganteacher
She'll never give up Taco Bell to go Vegan. ☺️.
woohoooo part time vegan waves are amazing
Are you guys going to do Hamilton? You-Eliza, Eric-Alexander, Flynn-theire son
To be fair to the "are you going to have another baby" questions... You talk and joke all the time about wanting to have another baby.
I think you’re Halloween costumes will be Horton, Gertrude and the Elephant Bird from Seussical😁
IM ONE OF THOSE ANXIETY SISTERS! yay so fun. 😐
2:32 do some men get periods how?
yay, I love Colleen’s corner!!
Humans are "omnivores," not "herbivores," a strait vegan diet is not good for you just as eating nothing but red meat like a carnivore is not good for humans. Eating a well balanced organic diet is the best thing for a human.
I am vegan and I feel the same way! It’s so crazy to me that people care what you eat so much?!? What is that all about? People feed their kids McDonald’s(not that McDonald’s is bad....you do you) everyday but pull out a salad and everyone loses their mind! Just funny to me! I also think some vegans give Veganism a bad name.  We are not all judgmental and mean. I don’t care what you eat as long as you are a nice person!
Louis Cole got really skinny for several years after going Vegan. Maybe for a big guy 6'5 it's tougher. Colleen could turn into a twig. For several years (teen mags saying she's bulimic?). ☺️.
Anxiety sister here!!!!!! Deep breaths. Sending you love. ❤️
Title: Planning Baby #2! Me: COMMENT SECTION!...but I’ll watch vid at same time
Are you guys going to do Little Shop for HALLOWEEN!!?!?
They’re going to be waitress
It could be Waitress!
Is it Hamilton Halloween themed?
PLEASE LET IT BE BEETLEJUICE
Lemme save y’all sum time 6:47
And if anybody dares to unsubscribe/write mean comments, you will have me to go through! No one dares hurt Colleen
Where is Gus? Did I miss something...
You and Erik should be bags of ice, and Flynn a baby, so it’s ice, ice, baby.
Halloween idea: Erik as Sweeney Todd, Colleen as Mrs Lovett, Flynn as baby Tobias, Kory as Anthony
I think the person asked if you were actually married because they didn’t know if you had an officiator actually marry you with a marriage license at that small ceremony at your house. Like getting legally married.
I used to go to String Cheese Incident concerts.
.
I’m vegan and it’s super awesome that you’re making efforts towards it! For me it definitely didn’t seem like something I’d be able to do at all until I learned about the ethics of it. Once I saw that my food choices had direct victims it became so much easier to just not eat those things. I grew up eating meat, dairy, and eggs just like you, but as soon as I made that connection the transition became easy. I’d recommend watching “Dominion” and “The Best Speech You’ll Ever Hear” (Gary Yourofsky) on YouTube. Also, “Dairy is Scary” by Erin Janus is the video that converted me. I do want to restate that what you’re doing is great! Even just you talking about veganism in a positive way can help so many animals! Thank you!
They are totally doing Hamilton!!!
Hamilton musical theater i thik.
Costume guess: Seymour, Audrey, and the venus flytrap from Little Shop of Horrors <3 :)
Coming from an agricultural background it is difficult for me to understand the want to be vegan. I’m not sure about the health benefits but as far as helping the planet??? My family raises beef cattle too be eaten. They are very well cared for  and live a happy relaxed life. I understand that there may be a few operations that do not rightfully care for animals but from my experience most production is done with a kind hand towards each and every animal. Dairy cows enjoy being milked because it takes stress off of their utters and chickens are just happy little creatures that will exclaim in excitement to their friends when they lay an egg. I just want to try to put my agricultural knowledge out there for y’all. I plan to become a veterinarian and play a part in the rightful  treatment of all animals.
I still love that she says, “and some men have periods too.” I wish people could always do that. Thanks Colleen
When you said you were going to get your rights as a female taken. That's not going to happen. When you said vegans help the planet what about the farmers. What are we suppose to do
When the Canadian Border reopens. I might be in Washington State. Been to Montreal, and Toronto. Never Vancouver. It depends on how many people vote. It's looking good for trump's Demise. And for his removal by Seal Team Six if it came to that. But I will travel Canada in Spring, Summer & fall this decade.
ELPHABA, FIYERO, AND A BABY FLYING MONKEY
You should go as the schuyler sisters
Her kittie tho!! 😍🥰
“We aren’t gonna have a baby anytime on purpose, on accident.... maybe” so does that mean you and Eric are doing to you know what?
YouTube dont get how much we actually what Q&A’S
Just a reminder that becoming vegan might be the best choice for you or for your family, but it might not be the best or safest choice for others. People with certain disabilities or chronic illnesses often have a list of foods that they consider "safe" foods and sometimes those foods aren't vegan. These safe foods are things that those people know won't cause their disabilities/illnesses to go into a panic mode (basically causing their body to become sick or cause an allergic reaction which could put them in the hospital - no one wants to go there during a global pandemic if they don't have to). I don't want this to sound mean but I feel like THIS specific part of the debate isn't thought about or talked about enough.
I love Flynn he’s such a sweet little soul ❤️😊
Yay soon you will be a fellow Canadian one thing we do not live in snow all year or live in igloos or ride dog sleds or mooses it's definitely less warm here then where you are!
i think you're halloween thing is the musical SIX its about the six wives of henry one 8

7:44 she says mum and not mom hahahah
My sentiments exactly about being pregnant in general, and right now. 😳
IM YO ANXIETY SISTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
Halloween Costume idea: You as Miranda Erik as Patrick  Flynn as a Froze Toes (This is not an original comment I just thought it was a REALLY good idea)
High School musical
ummm ur gonna dress up as the high school musical theme
Halloween costumes idea:  Dress up as Flynn.   (Big Brian)
“New baby” *clicks so fast*
Men have periods!!!!!!
If it’s hard for you to be vegan, you can try to be vegetarian in the beginning. It’s still helping the world and it’s a bit simpler if you’re not ready to fully commit to being vegan.
2:31 PREECH SISTA 👏👏
halmltim
Aaaaaim sooooo exited
I’ve been eating meat and I was a cheese freak for years and it was easy for me to go vegan! Best decision I ever made and it’s been one year so far for me(:
You’re cat is so cute
✨anxiety✨
I love colleeens corner
you should get Flynn transformer cars.
1:29 I wanna hav the guts to do that
I think you'll be characters from Hamilton
A good start for becoming vegan would be not to eat chicken every night :D I'm still waiting for all the veggie recipes you wanted to show us!
omg if y’all do hamilton eliza and philip I might die of happiness
I don't know if you'll see this! When you write, is it always stories about Miranda, or have you tried writing about other things?
Would you ever think about being vegetarian?😄
I'm vegetarian. Vegetarian can eat things from animals just as long as it isn't something that kills a animal. People keep saying that vegetarians are the same as vegans but the difference is pretty clear and... No! We don't only eat vegetables, lol 😂
man be bicoastal, y’all can travel back and forth every now and again. itd be so cool for flynn to be able to experience 2 country’s and so many different cultures!
Yayyyyy join the vegan club!! 🥰😁
I mostly agree with what you said about being vegan and agree it is good for the planet. I like you, do the same and do little things (partly because I'm lactose intolerant) and think that we should try to save the planet. However, if we all stopped eating meat we would have an overpopulation of animals, and then what would we do?
I’m not vegan but I use vegan soap sometimes, that’s helpful? 🤷🏽‍♀️🙂
Some places in Canada they are placing a double line of steel cable on the border.
Some men have periods ? I wasn't taught that in school
Haters back off will be your outfits for Halloween  Small YouTuber here
If you don’t stop click baiting us with pregnancy  i stg. 🖤
i used to LOVE colleens corner 🥺
clicked faster than James to say shore
nonevegan
do a hamilton themed costume!!
I almost threw up where I read the title...i was shocked to the core
If you are saying men have periods because of people who are transgender.. they are still a woman. So no men don’t have periods. Sorry no disrespect but no man has a period it’s the normal way God made woman. Not men.
My guess for your costumes is Phantom of the Opera? Erik will be dressed as the Phantom (the Phantom's name also happens to be Erik) Colleen as Christine and Flynn as Raoul!
Hamilton
oh my god i frickin remember that ticket video, gosh we’re old 😅😅
Someone- Are you and Eric married? Colleen- ????????? YES😂
Vancouver is the most expensive place to buy a house
little shop of horrors costume would be amazing!
Abortion IS murder. Soooooo...I’m ready for another 4 years! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🥳💯✌🏼
What about vegan day once a week???
anybody gonna mention her makeup tho?
MOVE TO CANADA PLSSS WE CAN BE TOGETHER 🤪
Ok, so I get wanting to be a vegetarian, but I don't know why to give up eggs and dairy. Chickens naturally produce eggs and cows naturally produce milk. Can someone please explain this?
Little Shop of Horrors costume!
I feel like it is Annie
I just came back from watching Lucifer and I saw Erik play as Jullian lol but funny thing is I saw his chin and it immediately clicked in my head that it was him
i bite into string cheese😬
Beef it’s what’s for dinner. Support your local farmers they are keeping a America going. Learn where your food comes from before you make harsh decisions. Meaning look past the PETA bs
Piecy bangs actually look really good on colleen😁
I collect batteries and recicle them
Me biting string cheese 👁👄👁
I bite string cheese too... is he from the Midwest?! It’s normal
My mom just had her 5th baby last week
Who thinks that Colleen and Flynn should start up a baby mama cooking YouTube channel
Tbh, making choices to help better the planet is important even if it’s not going vegan. Veganism isn’t realistic for most people but buying from small local brands and cruelty free is a good way to help
Saving the planet:  Besides eating less meat, also get rooftop solar and drive an EV.
OMG, just realized you have a freckle on your neck in the exact same spot as me. love you a lot (i love Miranda more)
<3
"it might happen on accident" omg  Colleen 🤭🤭💖😏
I THINK IT FROM THE HAMILTON MUSICAL FOR YOU COSTUME
Almond milk certainly tastes amazing but producing it, sadly is not environment friendly 😱🤔😉
The war between vegans and meat eaters  Me: I’m just going to step my vegetarian self out of here...
That vegan teacher typing.... EATING ANIMALS IS WRONG MCDONALDS HURTING  ANIMALS IS WRONG MCDONALDS SHARE THIS SONG AND BE VEGAN FROM NOW ONNNNNNN   me: shut the hell up
Waitress for Halloween?
A little shop of horrors costume would be cute! Erik and Colleen as Seymour and Audrey and Flynn as baby Audrey 2
There needs to be a Haters back off season 2!!
Theatre costume idea:  Seymour, Audrey and Audrey 2 from Little Shop of Horrors Hamilton, Eliza and Phillip from Hamilton
I don’t know why but I thought the blanket on the bed kind of looked like ground beef 😂
No freakin way!!!!!!!! Baby #2!!!!!!!!!
Hamilton x
Yesssss ! I love a colleens corner moment !
Awesome!! 💙
The whole month of November is you anniversary lol
Please do you is Eliza Schuyler Eric as Alexander Hamilton and Lil Flynn as Philip the poet ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think it is Hamilton for Halloween
Me looking at title: Who what now!?!? And baby number two is so much easier cuz your body has already done it before. Yes that is what every mother should be proud of.
Please please please tell me it's Colleen as Mrs. Lovett, Erik as Sweeney Todd, and Flynn as Tobias Ragg!
6:45 is “when is bay #2”
It better be Hamilton❤️
*this channel is honestly a safe space with all that's going on right now*
6:46 😁
LOVE THE VIDEO GIRL, but I can not stop staring at your right eyebrow and it looks it’s up higher then the other one. I am conflicted
It’s waitress
OMG A SECOND BABY!?!?!YESSS I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED IT YET AND IM EXCITED
I liked your answer about veganism!   I’ve been vegan for 4 years and I believe any steps in the right direction are helpful to our planet and I’m glad you’re preaching that to your audience. 💗✨
I'm sorry but, no one can tell you what you can or can not eat based on your beliefs, its YOUR own decision, unless of course you decide to go cannibal then we may have a problem.
🙄
I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND CLICKED SO FAST I DIDNT EVEN WATCH THE VIDEO YET-
I think u guys r gonna be people from Hamilton
I don't identify as vegan or vegetarian. I do what I want, but I surely leannn vegan. Mostly vegan choices overall. Love that you're leaning that way too Colleen!
Fun fact: Even though no one in my household is lactose intolerant (my grandmas lactose intolerant but she doesnt life with us) I still grew up drinking almond milk and soy milk; therefore, I don’t like cows milk a lot
Greatest showman I think your costume is
Colleen, love you but you can’t tease about wanting a baby and then be annoyed when people ask about it. 😜
Howdy!- 18 year vegan here. I 100% agree that a fully vegan diet is not anywhere near as easy as a standard omnivorous diet, it terms of grocery store selections, cost, restaurants offerings, etc. I made a decision when I went vegan that it was about my personal choices, and therefore I refused to politicize mine or anyone else’s diet. Diets can be very, very personal (if not sometimes cultural or religious) choices, and it is absolutely no one else’s business what you personally put into your mouth. There are wonderful ways to discuss diet in ways that broaden views- heck, teach a friend how to make guac!- without shaming or disenfranchising anyone’s food choices. Colleen, you do you for you and your family— it’s clear that you are thoughtful about food choice and environmental impacts on food production in the US and beyond— do you. And if you want a killer squash soup recipe, I’m your girl. 👍
who else LOVES colleens corners??😻😻
Your anniversaries will be on your marriage license...
Me on the toilet: OMG BABYYYYYY TWOOO Mom: HEY BE QUITE Me:oof
Little shop of horrors would be a cute family costume
I’m so sorry Colleen, but I have to agree with Erik when it comes to how to eat string cheese😹.
Only women have periods not men. Men do not have v’s. Women do.
I loooove how honest and funny Colleen is idk if she is seeing this but ilysm like this if you stan Colleen for being an un-problimatic queen
No intentions of being a vegan but each to their own. I certainly wouldn't shame or criticize anyone for making that choice and I don't understand why anyone would. It's just not for me.
My bestfriend is vegan, but I am so used to eating dairy and meat but steak I don’t like as much. I love chicken nuggets, soooooo yeeeee. But I love anyone who chooses to be vegan and vegetarian as long as you don’t shove it in my face and when my bestie comes to visit we get here vegan cheese and almond milk.
As you saying about Eric eating his String cheese like that I legit took a bite
i missed colleens corner
You don’t want to get pregnant during “such a scary political time” because you’re scared all your “rights as a woman will be taken away.” You got pregnant and had Flynn during Trump’s first term. Seemed to go ok. I don’t understand this comment.
There's no way your giving up cheeseburgers, especially from In and Out. There's no way I'm giving up cheeseburgers, especially from Five Guys. End of conversation. Peace and Love.
Hamilton
Do you still have Gus?
Check the time stamp on your wedding video
omg i think the family costume is hamilton!!!!!!
So has u ever gone in full maranda and been with Flynn and how did he react to her
I have a question for you, why do you feel the need of clickbaiting all the time? You have usually a lot of views, i don't understand why it's so necessary.
I would think you aren’t actually married because having a “wedding” doesn’t make you legally married. There’s paperwork, so. Maybe you just didn’t want to talk about that? Idk. I believe you, I’m just saying, describing the “wedding” doesn’t really answer the question.
Collen: Where are my akiyey brothers and sisters ✌ Me:Here✋ I have it bad tho
I love this! And you should do this again.
aLeXaNdEr  HaMiLtOn. Is my guess?!?
the costume is cats
Halloween Costume Guess: Alexander, Eliza, and Phillip
My guess for you guys’ Halloween costumes  1. The Schuyler sisters 2. Waitress: Colleen as Dawn, Flynn as some kind of pie or baked good, and Erik as Ogie!
Her blanket do look like ground beef
Waitress
little shop of horror costumes, Flynn can be the plant aww
Im convinced my brother is not human he bites string cheese too
“and even some men have periods” me: 😌✌️✌️
A man physically cant get a period that's literally impossible.😂😂 what the heck?
Come to canada!  I am from Vancouver Island and there is so much to explore here!
6:45 for baby
WAITRESS
HAMILTON FAMILY COSTUME
Guesses for costume: Eliza, Alexander Hamilton, and Phillip from Hamilton!
9:21 right there instant thought miranda is dead she loves meat
they should be karen smith regina george and gretchen wieners😂😂
high school musical
bro get him gear toys
I think you should go as Seymour, Audrey and Flynn as Audrey 2 😂
I respect vegans. The only thing that bothers me is that some vegans try to push it on others and tell people they're bad if they're not vegan,  but the harsh truth is that specifically vegan food can be a lot more expensive than regular food, some people can't afford it and I wish that was talked about more. I'm sure more people would be vegan if it was affordable :/
maybe for the costume there gonna be heather heather and heather
I know you don’t get political on your channel like ever but I am just really curious why you are scared that all of your rights will be taken away as a woman. Love ya Colleen!!
I’ve been a gluten-free vegan for years and it’s not as hard as a lot of people say it is but it’s not easy either. I was lucky because when I was young I had a dairy allergy so I was taking off of those things when I went vegan I wasn’t losing a lot. Given the cravings are really bad and sometimes you might even have dreams so tread lightly and be careful if you do. PS make sure you get enough B12 because if you don’t it’s not comfortable
I think the costume theme there doing is Hamilton   Like if you agree!!!
Halloween Costume idea: You as Miranda Erik as Patrick  Flynn as a Froze Toes Just an idea maybe just for pictures idk just thought it would be cute💜 Edit: Thank you guys for 1.5k likes keep it up guys so she can see this
Being pregnant during COVID is scary I’m 8 months pregnant
😂 I’ve never seen a traffic light picture before and idk how I never knew about this story! I’m cracking up. That’s so funny. You were clearly conflicted lol
omg a colleen's corner it's been so long
I know daisy isn't wearing falsies...but when she's slightly blurred out she looks like it and its FAAAABULOUSSS.
i kinda feel like they’re gonna do hamilton cause it came out this year and they’ll be able to pull it off-
“Some men have periods” I love you for that ❤️❤️
Flynn biggest flex is his parents lol ❤️ I love him
I completely support anyone wanting to be any type of vegan/vegetarian or nothing at all BUT I would suggest going to local farmers markets for milk, eggs, honey, and other animal byproducts and making sure their animals are humanely treated and such, and my reason for that is because bees will make honey regardless and bee keepers LOVE their bees and treat them so well when it’s not a big corporation, cows produce milk regardless of whether they have a calf or not, they need to be milked or it could cause them severe pain and other problems, again speaking from personal experience all farmers I’ve met love their cows like their own children and want what’s best for them, also chickens and ducks will produce eggs whether they are fertilized or not, you are not eating baby chickens because they are not fertilized, still make sure you ask questions and stuff to the farmers. (Ask of the chickens have name and similar things to see if the farmer actually cares about their animals)
Colleen: Some men have periods Me: *searches up* can men have periods           the more you know
Who doesn’t want Q&A’s? I want to know.
Serious question though, why are you afraid that you’re rights are going to be taken away?
Costume idea Cats from musical
I think ur family costume is going to be Alexander Hamilton, Eliza and Phillip! BTW i love you Colleen!!
instead of being 100% vegan you can try being flexitarian where you are 2/3 vegan it is still a good option for the environment.
I have a question. What's does it feel like to have a baby in your belly? And how can you tell your pregnant?
For you group, i think you are going to be Alexander, Eliza, and Phillip from Hamilton
If there cousins is Eliza, Alexander and Philip I will DIE!
Im sorry but i just have to say it... Trump has been president for 4 years now and he hasn’t taken away ANYONES rights let alone women’s rights. If anything you should be afraid that if Joe Biden gets elected then we will actually have our rights taken away like, our constitutional right to bear arms and protect ourselves, and extreme raise in taxes so that they can take your hard earned money and we will be living in a communist country with a terrible economy.
I’ve heard the best meat to eat is if you hunt and kill a deer or another animal because it doesn’t have any hormones or drugs in it. Also it’s important to kill animals in the wild. If you have too many deer, there won’t be enough food for them all so they will have a miserable death. This is my take on it. No hard feelings if you disagree.
Being vegan is dangerous because you can become vitamin deficient
If you’re costume is not Hamilton or Waitress I’m gonna be really sad😂   edit: Thanks for the likes👍
Uhm, men don't have periods 😆. Only women have a uterus and can get pregnant. Love you.
Colleen: Where my anxiety sisters and brothers at?! Me: Here!!
6:42 baby #2 question. youre welcome
I'm just going to say this because I care. For the sake of your and your family's health, please don't go vegan. There are so many things you don't get adequate amounts of in plant based foods, and the fat soluble vitamins in plants of poorly absorbed. We need animal fats, omegas, vit A, vit D, vit K2, cholesterol (the brain is 90% fat). We need veg for probotics and fiber, gut health but you need animal fat and protein for your brain, organs, immune system, skin, hair and muscle. Don't trade vegetable butter for real butter, real butter is liquid gold, full of vit A, D and K2 Don't mind if people come from me. You have a beautiful healthy family, just don't want to see you sacrifice your health for the environment. Also, cows nourish the land they graze on, the soil becomes healthier over time, but crop rotation destroys the land and leeches the nutrients in the soil, rendering it useless after a few years.
Yessss!!!! About the string cheese! You peel it to eat it 🤣
i miss old youtube, i love these kinds of videos 🥺
I think the family costume will be wizard of oz. or frozen 2
I hope it's Hamilton!
when u said "were my brother and sister anxiety group" I said AM HERE!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my god, when she picked up her cat at 12:03 😭  My cat sometimes makes a squeak sound, too, it’s so cute!
adioms famly
Wizard of Oz costumes?!! Eric as Tin Man, Flynn as Scarecrow, Corey as Cowardly Lion, and Gus as Toto!! 😂
you inspired me to make my one channel thankyou
I think it would be really cute if you guys were Alice, Jimmy, and their son (can't remember his name) from Bright Star.
hamilton
We will watch any thing u do! 🤔❤️🙃🙂
Ps I love you and your channel
No matter how naughty or crazy little kids are  they are always so sweet whether it be manners or including everyone or something else they are so sweet.
Girl just do this again why notttt take an otther chancceee? Whyyyy not do a Krazzy dance!!!!
Colleens corner is such a throwback!!! I love them!! 💜
Oh my god the question about Eric. Why does he bite cheese like that. I couldn't stop laughing 😂
On Veganism: Honestly, everyone should be open to it. If not completely, then a strand of it. Vegetarianism, etc. Limiting meat consumption (Especially red meat and such) would be so good for our environment and our bodies. It’s also a choice, just like learning how to speak another language. It’s all just preference, but it’s so helpful to open yourself up to many things! I personally have low iron and protein, (I don’t eat beans or lentils or any of that great stuff often, and I don’t eat many meals in a day since it works best for my body, I know, I’m going to try to fix myself a little soon!) So eating meat once or twice a week, especially at home is really good for me.  I think a main issue is the vegan and health community is just forcing it upon people, calling others names and accusing them of being unhealthy and essentially a burden on society. It’s really damaging for those people, so obviously they’re going to have a terrible perception of the diet. If you read up until this part, I love you and you’re perfect the way you are. Thank you for reading my crazy little rant.
How do men get periods????
If the Halloween costume is not sweeney Todd I don’t want it.
move to Québec!  That would be so cool! It's french though T _ T
I was thinking for the costume that Colleen could be Gertrude, Erik could be Horton, and Flynn could be The elephant bird. I did Seussical a few months ago and that’s what me and my friend went as for Halloween. I know Colleen was Gertrude when she did Seussical, so that’s why I think they might do that, but who knows🤷🏻‍♀️
I think that your costume should be/ is Alexander,Eliza, and Philip
Love tou
YASSS MUSICAL THEATRE THEMED, broo, whatever musical it is, i love it. LOL,
She said men have periods? 💀
Being vegan is really good but being the vegan teacher is a no no
Yaaaaasssssssssssssssssss! I love Colleen’s corner!!!!!!!!! It’s back!!!!!
Cause joe is gonna take our rights lol
For the Halloween costumes I think you are either people form Hamilton or people from Waitress
your cat is so cute but looks so pissed off at the same time.😂❤
She literally says “relax stop asking about baby #2” then uses that question for click bait? Lol
I’m an anxiety sis!!!
Only the og Fans will remember Collens corner😅🤣
Please let it be Rocky Horror Picture Show
Erik should be Sweeney Todd, Colleen should be Mrs. Lovett, and Flynn should be a shepherd pie.
Colleen, as a vegan, I totally commend you and your efforts! Being vegan is not the easiest and most plausible for everyone and that's okay! However the small things you do definitely add up, and I totally respect that :)
7:33 the handsmaids tail
If you go with a spooky theme, I think it would be fun to see you all as characters from Beetlejuice. But maybe you’re just going to go with Waitress? You could dress Flynn up as a pie 😂
Thank you. I totally agree with your vegan view. I don't want to become full vegan but I do want to help when I can. I don't drink milk so I buy almond and oat to cook with. I also buy vegan butter when I can. My husband is a huge meat eater so I make him meat and lots of veggie sides. I try some vegetarian dishes for him. He's a good sport about it but he always tells me he prefers meat hahaha.
i love all your videos colleen i’ve been watching you for yearssss.
Either Waitress or Hamilton
alexander hamilton
Love you❤🤟🤟
Is it Annie? You would be Annie, Flynn would be Sandy, and Erick would be Daddy Warbucks?
Halloween costume ideas? (Sweeney Todd) Flynn: dressed as Tobias or Toby Ragg (which is the little boy) Colleen: dressed as Mrs. Lovett  Erik: dressed as Sweeney Todd (Benjamin Barker)                            OR Nightmare Before Christmas Flynn: dressed as Zero (Jacks cute little ghost dog) Colleen: dressed as Sally Erik: dressed as Jack Skellington
Oh how I miss the 2015 YouTube vibes
Omg I hope it’s a girl for bailey
Is your Halloween costume wizard of oz?
Their costume is sugar, butter, and flour 😉
Yeah u should move to Canada
They said that Canada opens October 2nd
I can’t be vegan:p
Move to Richmond ( in Vancouver) let's me neighbors my son is 6 months older then flynn 😋
I haven't pulled on string cheese since I was like 7. I bite ALL the time.
Musical theatre costumes -Wicked = Elphaba, Fiyero and Flynn as one of the flying monkeys or Glinda 😂 - Waitress = Dawn, Ogie and Flynn as a pie  -Shrek, Fiona and Donkey - Phantom of the opera - Hamilton so Eliza, Alexander and Phillip - Cats - Little Shop of horrors - Beetlejuice  - Charlie and the chocolate factory  - You’re a good man, Charlie Brown
Huuuummmmmmmmm family costume
That's my favorite thing about Flynn too, I think, even though I can't really pick ONE favorite ^^ But I remember seeing in your vlogs ever since he was really little just wanting to share his food and toys and stuff with everybody, it's adorable! <3
Colleen I think you should move to Manitoba because then we could be friends😉😏
On your topic of veganism I personally am not and never will be but I I prefer to get my product locally from farmers because I don’t agree with the mass and over production of meant and animal products. Even if we want to eat meat there’s still better ways to get it other then your supermarket
Waitress
Yayyyy I can’t wait for the next baby!!!
I feel like its Hamilton
Who else thinks Colleen should right a broad way musical
Colleen:*talking about vegans* Me:*eating chicken wings*😅😨🤭
the vegan teacher has entered the chat...
Waitress Greece Hamilton
Anyone else think Eric is right about the cheese 8:54
You guys should be the plastics from mean girls Broadway or just the movie
PLEASE try and go vegan! Try the 22 day challenge 💚
Our costume crew and entire cast had to do rehearsal for HOURS on weekends because we only had an hour after school on weekdays.
Animals are here for us to eat as humans we need meat if I wanted to go vegan I would but I can't
Ok but let’s talk about YouTube and these two unskippable ads.
My brother was obsessed with cars since he was like one. He is 14 and he still makes car sounds when he runs around
We've been extending the u.s. ban in Canada monthly. Don't expect a set date you guys are not coming in any time soon
Your the cutest person on earth
I hope nobody is mad at me because I am not vegan/vegetarian please dont be mad at me
I hope the costumes are from Little Shop of Horrors!
I think it’s gonna be the Hamilton’s (Eliza, Alexander and Philip)
I am a vegan and I’ve been vegan since I was 5. You can do whatever you want. I suggest if you want to go vegan start with pescatarian and then you can have fish and milk and eggs but it gets you on a start 😁😁
I bite my string cheese 😂😂
I THOUGHT OF THIS RANDOMLY IN THE VIDEO!! I actually haven't seen waitress but I feel like it could be waitress and it could be the character you played, then Eric being the character you had a lot of pictures with if that makes sense? And then Flynn could be a pie!😂😂
i have never clicked soo fast on a video
Hehe I wove you Colleen
i reckon it’ll be wizard of oz
Is your musical costume  gonna be waitress
Hamilton
Imma say say waitress is the costume plan,lol eric as a doctor lol
You guys should have baby 2 cause flynn would have someone to play with😄
Hamilton the musical
You should get Finn tinker toys (I was obsessed when I was little)
If anyone came here specifically for the baby #2 discussion, here’s the time stamp :) 6:46
Sooo, you don't want to get pregnant again because you're afraid you will not have the "right" to get an abortion? That's the only "right" I hear people talking about getting taken away. (It's not a right to being with, but whatever.) Are there other women's rights getting taken away that I'm not aware of?
You should get those marble track things. I used to play with them in kindergarten. If you don’t know what that is, it is a puzzle like thing where you can connect different colored pieces to create a track or rollercoaster like building. Then, once you finish, you put a marble in it and watch it go down.
My son does the same thing when he bugs us 😂 it’s my favorite. Toddlers are so fun
My inner theatre kids HOPE that they are going to be Seymour, Audrey and Audrey II (the plant) from Little Shop of Horror
Is it like a suessical costuume? Flynn could be the elephant bird  ☺
Eliza, Hamilton, and philip
“If they’re not Erik stocklin”🥺❤️
Bet this is click bait
Wait men have periods
I Love your eyeshadow 🥰
Your fine colleen , I'm a vegan (almost  2 yrs) and I do admit the first 2 months were not easy ,but a little advice  if you ever go vegan "if your ever tempted by something  non-vegan , remember  the reason  you went vegan" trust me it helps  a lot 👍 well anyways , love you!😌🌱
She’s over here talking about getting pregnant during a pandemic and I’m sitting here 30 weeks pregnant. My husband and I tried for 3 years and we couldn’t get pregnant then we gave up right before pandemic happened was moving on to infertility treatment and I somehow found out I was pregnant in March while first week quarantined. I’m praying for a healthy rest of pregnancy.  I get why she’s scared of pregnancy because it’s def not for me. I have been throwing up since 8 weeks and still to this day.
I BET u they’re either being sum Hamilton or Waitress
Don’t move to Canada! In the winter it’s -7 ish degrees often! It’s sucks!
I've been doing 3-4 vegetarian days a week since 2020 started and it's been quite easy for me! Idk if I'll ever be fully vegan, but I know that I'm doing my best with my vegetarian days, and with purchasing vegan products and reducing the amount of waste.
5:40 My guess is Gertrude, Horton, and Elephant Bird.
You’re doing amazing!! I respect you so much and love ALL your videos!!❤️❤️❤️
How about     Colleen: Miranda sings Erik : Patrick Flynn  :  toesicle  ?? I think it would be cute what about u
You should get Flynn kiwi co crates!!!
You should move to maple ridge it's about an hour drive outside of downtown vancouver and it's really really pretty up here.
I classify myself as a vegetarian with a side of vegan 😂 because I eat cheese and drink chocolate cow milk but other than that I mostly go vegan :) oh and eggs from my own chickens
I’m sorry ...... did u just say that he bites STRING CHEESE!?    *deep breathes it’s gonna be ok *
Colleen filmed during the day?!? Its a spooky szn miracle! (People who watch the vlogs will know lol)
I am in candacome on come over
I bite into string cheese
He not gonna take your rights...however if biden gets in office...all poc, say goodbye to your rights.
Aladin
I love her
she's waiting for roe v wade to not be overturned so that she can be pregnant with the option of killing it?
Thank you for speaking so highly about veganism! 💗🌱
Come to Nova Scotia!!
I think the first one is like Are you legally married with a marriage licence or however people get married because it was at your house. I'm not saying that you can't get married at your house but that's what I think the question was because I've been wondering that too.
when she said “if you’re not erik stocklin” 🥺
Btw colleen i cant speak for everyone but I am getting all notifications for all of your channels
My brother also did that 'watching the wheel turning' thing with cars. He stoped at around 4-5 years old.
Colleen your son is a very special gift from God. He knows in his heart that a person's feelings matter.💜💜
Do you girl
The wizard of Oz would be so cute for a Halloween costume
She says there is not going to be a baby 2 soon, maybe on accident but not on purpose... well see
I live in Canada and it’s amazing 😉
Man don’t move to Canada, it’s basically a communist country with Trudeau in charge 😩
I wish the judges vegans out there would chill out, making ppl scared to call themselves vegan 😡 we calm vegans accept u and appreciate ur efforts 😡😘🥺💖
Angelica, Eliza and Peggy for Halloween!
Where did you get that pink blanket from
I think you all are going to be Hamilton or something
Here’s my Halloween family costume guess (it’s probably really wrong, but it’s the first thing that popped into my head): Eliza, Philip, and Hamilton????
2020 YouTube is shite, old school vlogs and Q&As are the reason I love youtube
Really like how you answered the Vegan question. Another aspect to consider is that being Vegan is an economic privilege. Low income people aren’t able to have access to Vegan options. Specifically in urban areas like where I live, there are “food deserts”. Some people don’t have grocery stores near them. Vegan, and fresh foods are much more expensive.
Me hoping they dress up as the schyler sisters for Halloween 😅😂
Oof If Colleen Has Another Baby I Will Feel Sorry for Her Pain Again
Costume idea Musical Theatre Theme: Hamilton  Colleen: Eliza Hamilton  Erik: Alexander Hamilton  Flynn: Philip Hamilton
colleen for holloween you should be the wormwoods, and collen you hold a baby doll
You should adopt. You are willing and financially able. Pregnancy was so rough on you. Don't put yourself through that again. Fostering children in the future may be a good option for you as well.
WAIT!! Men get periods!!!!
No ones still on this but here I am saying       Her hair looks amazing short
What if the costume is Colleen as Dawn Erik as Ogie and Flynn as a turtle or Dawns baby from the end of the show
Colleen's Corner vids are my FAVE!!!
Look up Gears!Gears!Gears! as a toy idea for Flynn. My mechanical minded children loved it when they were little.
I HOPE YOU GET A BABY GIRL THAT BE SWEET
Costumes : fiona, shrek and donkey?! From shrek the musical
did u rly just say men have periods
NOOOO im 2 hour late I didn't get a notification im gonna go be a Karen real quick
Some men have periods? huh?
Flynn is Fabulous and very cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was so sweet when she said her only dealbreaker was if they aren’t Erik Stocklin 🥺
i agree with the whole vegan thing, i know its good for animals but i have my own beliefs that staying completely vegan can be bad if you don’t take enough vitamins that you can get from animals.
Are you gonna do waitress? Like how you were in it
Snack ideas for Flynn : cuts up bananas and dip them in yogurt then freeze them for 2 hours
Men have periods?  Please elaborate
This is the fastest I have ever clicked on a video
the hamiltons
Often vegan Discussions omit how sometimes a person might not able to sustain their health and dietary needs as a vegan. Some people have to choose between their health and their desire to help the planet. I don’t think it’s helpful nor comprehensive to make the vegan discussion ONLY about ethics/morality. Disclosure: I am not vegan but know people who have had to give it up for health reasons.
Idk why but I think that the costume is high school musical theme lol
I love you so much more for trying to make as many vegan choices as possible!! 🤗
Post notifications on and always
Stop being so petty about the elections omg it’s making me not like you anymore and I’ve watched every vlog since March
You should get Flynn magnetic gears that go on your fridge
I saw this in my notifications and I was like tf is dis!!!! :D            Also cows can get a disease if they’re not milked and chickens need to lay eggs  Just get free range versions of them Obviously furs ( apart from faux love faux fur) are not right but I think some things that are apart of veganism that are not so good
Hope y'all are having a blast on your trip!!!
A lot of YouTubers do Q&As. I think just Colleen and the YouTubers she hangs around don’t ask much because they’ve been around for so long the viewers already know a lot about them. I guess?
if she has footage or her wedding, doesn't that mean there would be a date on whatever was used to film??
You should get hot wheels Flynn would loveee them
Please tell me it's seussical!!!!!!!!!! Cuteeeeeeeeee!!!!!
Family costume:  Erik = Alexander Hamilton Colleen = Eliza Hamilton  Flynn = Phillip Hamilton
My idea for costumes:  1: Alexander Hamilton, Eliza, and Phillip
rowmeo and juliet
I think it’s Beetle juice is what you guys are gonna be
I would love if the musical theatre Halloween costume was Fiyero (Erik) , Elphaba (Colleen) , and a flying monkey (Flynn) from Wicked.
You ask her your questions and she replies, her answers are lame but at least she tries. Colleens corner.
she keeps saying she might get pregnant on accident. girl there's birth control, condoms. there's NO such thing as getting pregnant on accident.
omg...your rights aren't gonna be taken away because of an election. a hundred years of womens rights aren't just gonna go away.
I *love* how quick she answered the question about something weird Erik does😂😂😂
i’m guessing your gonna do a hamilton theme  but idk
the title 6:46
For Halloween costume I think it would be hella cute for Colleen to be Audrey, Erik to be Seymour and Flynn to be Audrey 2, little shop of horrors eat your heart out 🙌🏻❤️
“Some men have periods” Excuse me 😳
Is the movie themed costume Hamilton?🤔
Mooomy
I think the coatumes will be themed what she played in Broadway sorry i forgot. Oh yeah waitress
thank you for what you said about veganism! i’m a vegetarian but struggle with the concept of going vegan because of the backlash i’d get. i like the way you explained your choices
Mommy
Honestly, I don’t support people who are 100% vegan! Eating less meat and dairy is good! But completely not eating eating them will effect society GREATLY!
How many videos has she given this title again?
why do I think there costume is Matilda. Colleen would be Matilda's mother, Eric would be Matilda's father and Flynn would be Matilda's brother. (I forgot their names).
Does anybody else see daisy in the background just staring at what looks like the floor😂
Says she doesn't want to get pregnant during this Pandemic.. Well that half the U tube population right now.. loL
Title- Planning baby #2!!!!  Actual video- not any time soon! Chill out 😂😂😂
For all people wondering why she said men can have periods, she's talking about trans men, who are men but were born as girls and transitioned to the opposite sex. Some of them don't take the hormones that make your menstrual cycle stop, so they still have their periods even as men. Now, if you're reading this and you're not okay with this because science said, the bible said, my biology teacher said, that's okay, no one cares. Keep your thoughts to yourself and go pray for your sins before thinking you have the right to say what's wrong and what's not.
Roses are red violets are blue i just got clickbaited and so did you
This click bait is getting old...
No, we love the q and a’s!
BEETLEJUICE
Yes! Bring back the 2015 those vibes, love q&a videos!!!
Me: IM VLOGGING- *Oops wrong channel*
Eliza, Hamilton and Philip. For Halloween that would be adorable and that’s my guess.
Talk about a click bait title
My guess is Beetle juice
loveuuuuuuu
is it greece
The greatest showman
You guys should be Miranda and Eric and flin should be froostowes
It is cringy to watch people bite straight into anything that is supposed to be bitten into. Like a kit kat. Not hating anyone who does that was just my opinion
Wait...Im sorry but does she really think our rights as woman are gonna be taken away based on the results of the election 😭😂 Nah I don’t think so. Whether Trump or Biden wins you gotta stop acting like the candidate your not voting for is going to cause mass destruction to our country if they’re elected. I don’t understand her fixation on woman’s rights, Im guessing she means abortion or something cuz it really doesn’t make sense to me. Woman’s rights ain’t goin anywhere. Let’s focus on the rights that others don’t have right now, such as the unborn. And can we please stop pretending that Biden’s gonna magically solve all our political problems, the man can’t even SPEAK 😭😂🤦‍♀️
Hamilton for costume
Their Halloween costume is probably gonna be Waitress themed lol 😂
I don’t like the idea cutting out every single thing that isn’t vegan. I like cutting out meat because I just don’t like meat. I also like almond better than regular milk. I bet I could get rid of meat entirely, but I live with a family of meat lovers there no escaping the occasional piece of bacon😆
Wait I do the biting into string cheese too!!
Hamilton or Waitress.
MY SISTER JUST WENT IN LABOR CHILL
Sound of music
What man has a people unless they transgender.....
Heathers - costumes
Costume idea's Hamilton Colleen = Eliza Eric = Hamilton Flynn = Phillip
Nicki Minaj who? The best Rapper is Colleen B! (The baby questions answer)
who else thinks that collene should move to southern alberta instead of Vancouver?!?!
I love the Colleen corner videos and think she should do them like maybe once every month :)
My dad eats string cheese like Erik. Sometimes I wanna kick the cheese out of his hands bc it’s so annoying
Costume is colleen will be Annie Eric will be daddy war bucks and and Flynn will be the dog 😂
Anxiety sistersssss wyaaaaa?????
Hack if you don’t know put a muffin linner under the stick of the popsicle
hamolten               ?
U guys should do the schuyler sisters as a halloween group costume!
Omg guys she’s basically just had a baby🤣 leave her alone! Having a baby is very personal and that’s for her and Eric to discuss when they chose to. It’ll be a nice surprise when it does happen!!!
10:16 I feel like people also assume that being vegan=healthy, there’s vegan Mac and cheese and other un healthy stuffs
you should do a Christmas musical with flyn
I bite my string cheese 🧀 👀 LOL
I don’t blame you for the veganism
What about the plants man. Without them we wouldn’t be breathing good and fresh air. So i don’t really think it matters if your vegan or not honestly
I bite string cheese. Erik your normal don't worry.
Halloween costume ideas for the fam: Flynn is the Lion, Colleen is Dorthy, and Erik is the tin man. Or Flynn is Scooby doo, Colleen is Daphine, and Erik is Fred from scooby doo!!!  I’m sure Colleen’s idea is better but I think these would be cute too🥰
The hallowe’en costume: I think is waitress because... Flynn could be a pie!!! 😂😂😂😂
she said my one requirement is that u are in fact my husband i love her
Wait. What? Men have periods?
Your anxiety brother is right here!!✌️✌️✌️
Waitress
I don’t think this is inappropriate, but if it is, let me know. But just imagining all 3 of you in the boots from Kinky Boots would be cute/funny
If they did Heathers as their costume that would be amazing, but I bet it's Hamilton or Waitress.
Am I the only one who doesn't remember at what age I got my period? Like, I remember the day and the exact moment, but I have no idea what age I was. Is someone like this too or am I the only one? 😂😂
You are desperate to get preg but its eric who doesnt want one..
The first thing that came to my head was hamlet idk just tell me if I’m wrong
I clicked faster than Bretman can say "or whateva"
Love you
A mozzarella stick is string cheese
Theres no way she just said men also have periods.....please tell me i clearly misheard her.............
Are you doing waitress as your theme 🤨
Love what you said about making veganish choices where you can, I completely feel that, I’m personally not vegan, but I completely agree even if someone’s just trading out milk for alternative milk options they should be applauded and not condemned for not doing more. Somethings better then nothing, and starting smalls better then not starting at all.
You should dress us as part of the cast of Waitress and have Flynn be a pie
Idea: WAITRESS
I totally agree with you with what you said on being vegan, I’m trying myself to not eat meat and dairy products, but I noticed when I tried to cut everything out at once I just craved it. So as a family we’ve been doing small changes, like I don’t drink cows milk, I have lactose free and oat milk, I rarely eat meat with my meals ect I just wanted to comment because I think what you said is totally understandable and I don’t see why you feeling that way as many of us do is wrong ❤️
#anxietysister
I hope Erik will be Hamilton, Colleen- Eliza, and Flynn- Phillip. lol
I bite my string cheese too😬
Love you and the vids😁🤩❤ Everyone who reads this, have a nice day and stay safe!😊  (Sorry if my grammar is wrong,i'm Dutch)
Waitress
People ask about another baby because you always bring it up lol...
I really wanted to go vegetarian when I graduated but unfortunately a cheeseburger from mcds is currently cheaper than making a salad, which for a college student cheap is basically the only way to go
Okay Colleen, yay snaps for trying to be woke. Vegan is a great diet lifestyle ..... but has anyone asked what would happen to the cows that don’t make it to the table? There are a few options.... they will continue to multiply and fart but in greater numbers since they aren’t good. they will become useless and cows will go extinct because everyone is vegan.... no more cows.... so somewhere in between? Then what’s the point? Lots of questions to consider with Veganism.... also, lions aren’t vegan.... so it’s not natural
ANOUTHER BABY  aHHhh😱🤩
my reaction when i saw the tittle - yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssss yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
⛔ SOS from Armenia ⛔  Dear Colleen  I am writing this to you as you have a large audience in the international arena. The Azerbaijani side together with Turkey launched open missile attacks along the entire line of the Republic of Artsakh and on villages of Armenia, targeting also the peaceful settlements. All this can have very serious consequences.  Please use your resources to inform the international community about it. We are Armenians and we want peace. Now we are writing this message to all famous people in the world. We hope you do not ignore our request.  The joint call of all of you will definitely weaken the current aggression, otherwise it may become dangerous not only for the Caucasus but also for the whole of Europe.  We believe that you will help us to stop this inhuman evil. Thank you ❤
Is she actually pregnant 🤰
Is the family costume Hamilton related perhaps??? Eliza, Alexander, and Philip? 🤷🏻‍♀️
wtf is she on about “men get periods” she’s so annoying
I didn't know you were moving😟 and when did you get home.🤔
2 was easy, 6.... yeah that’s hard
OMG YESSSSS
Colleen, i am with you! My brother eats string cheese without stringing it! Also i think that you Halloween costume will me Waitress. Love you!!
What you came for 6:50
IS YOUR HALLOWEEN COSTUME GONNA BE THE HAMILTONS?!
wizard of ozz!
I feel like the costume is Hamilton related. Like Alex, Eliza, and Phillip?
I don't know if they told you in the hospital when you rip And tare you get you a heat lamp and you lay on your bed and put that light on your painfully girl bits and oh what a relief yeaaa
8:19 That sounds like the kind person I need in my school, I’m always excluded along with 3 other kids in my class. We all need a “Flynn” in our lives ❤️
Little Shop of Horrors? A baby Audrey II costume would be adorable lol
Waitress
Omg what if you did a Hamilton theme where your Eliza and Erik is Alexander and Flynn  is baby Philip
I'm so annoyed about the baby questions, almost every women has to deal with this. WHY do you care, like it's none of our business what a women wants to do or not. Also it's a sensitive topic, why aren't people being more respectful about it. AHH I could go on about this all day
Your family Halloween costume is Tracy Turnblad and her parents from hairspray except Flynn will be Tracy.
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
YASSS COLLEN'S CORNER IS BACK!!!!! I MISSED IT SO MUCH
Colleen - Eliza Hamilton  Eric - Alexander Hamilton  Flynn - Philip Hamilton
Tip , when switching to vegan get a meal kit for a few weeks, helped me sooooo much
Thatveganteacher is quaking
Bruh just be vegetarian. Chickens naturally produce eggs so why not eat them?
Costume idea Flynn being a car Colleen and Eric traffic lights
what abt waitress on Halloween
The title was such ~click bait~ lol
Beign vegan isn’t making people kill animals less. It just means ur not eating it but I do respect all people that are vegan ❤️
I really want to be vegan but it’s so so hard
I accidentally said "Ok, love you, bye" when I ordered pizza. The guy laughed but then I got free mozzarella sticks so... worth the embarrassment.
Men don't have periods
You should see if Finn would like dirt bikes and see if he’s older he would want to race them or work on bikes
Ummm what...men have periods? What.....🙃
My family sells beef from the grass fed cows in our pasture. I haven’t had to buy meat from a store in years! Reach out to your local farmer because if they aren’t selling meat they know someone who is
Your husband should be Alexander Hamilton and you should be Eliza Schuyler and Flynn should be Philip
You do realize that the president of the United States doesn't have enough power to just take rights away from women, right? Even if he wanted to, which he doesn't, Trump would never be able to take away women's rights. Ever.
Waitress for Halloween
Oh my godddddd I hope they are Alexander, Eliza, and Phillip Hamilton from Hamilton
How many times is she gonna tease a second baby and complain about that we are prying into her life too much
tbh vegan people are scary
Costume idea Colleen is Eliza Hamilton Eric is Aleksandar in Flynn is Philip?
Hm, is the costume theme Hamilton?
Do these everyday
I know the Halloween costumes it’s gonna be the schuyler sisters. Flynn and Peggy, Eric as Eliza and Colleen as Angelica.
Colleen when the travel ban is over, you should totally come to Ottawa!!!! I've always wanted to meet you and there are so many fun things to do here!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ILYMMMM- Emma :3
I think your view and articulation of veganism was beautiful any and all help counts as HELP ❤ missed Colleen's corner
🔥🔥🔥😚😚
We are moving to Canada too!!
Im guessing LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS
I miss colleens corner sooooooooooooo much. #petitiontobringbackcolleenscorner
Are u doing little shop of horrors, where Flynn is Audrey 2 haahaa. Lol!!!
There are so many little baby toys with gears and stuff. Flynn would love it!
I have a feeling they’re all dressing up as waitress characters 😂
At 6:45 she talks about Baby 2, you're welcome
Lmfao i bite into string cheese lmfao
Clit bait ....again
YAY1 vegan!
I love your video so much
Wow again 1 more the trouble
I am a vegetarian so I don't eat meat.
was anyone genuinely  concerned that she was going to pass out when she was imitating people. Like girl BREATHE
You should get Flynn some gears! Learning Resources makes some great ones .... it’s on sale on amazon right now
doctor: “you have 12 minutes and 32 seconds left to live”   me:
I bite string cheese!! 😆
"Our family costumes is misical theater" me ANGLEICA PEGGY ELIIIIIIZA WERK
I think the costume is Angelica Peggy and Eliza  from Hamilton hahah 😂
Halloween Costume Idea 🎃 Colleen - Velma  Erik- Fred  Flynn - Scooby Doo
I too, bite the string cheese 🤣
Vegan is SO good for the planet and your health I recommend ANYONE who wants to be one start out as a vegetarian instead of going cold turkey and just going vegan because it’s gonna stress and make it so hard. I’m vegetarian and don’t plan on going vegan until I’m older bc im still a teen in my house. ❤️
Sounds like Flynn and Jacob are going to be best friends (they both seem into mechanics so far)
reading the title i was so happy
Your Halloween Costume for the Fam is Waitress
dude i’m thirteen and everyone around me has started their period and i’ve had all the symptoms for like 2 years 😭😭😭 edit: DUDE IM WANTING TO BE DAWN FOR HALLOWEEN
I screwed and I’m in the car😂
Threenagers and Fournagers are WAY worse than two years olds!!! Lol
I want you to move to London ontario bc I live there lol
I watch daily vlogs i heard you discuss this SEVERAL times why do I fall for ckickbate ALL the time 😭😭😭🤣
*Sees the words “baby #2”   *Automatically clicks*
I think it’s going to be a musical that she likes so I’m probably already right 😂
OMG YOU GUYS NEED TO BE HAMILTON ELIZA AND PHILIP PLEAASE FDBKKBF
How does some men have periods? Explain please.
hamilton
I also bite my string cheese......
Daisy in the background 😑
Being a vegan is good for the animals not so sure about the planet thou, cause plantations means deforestation and destroy habitats but anyone can do what ever they want
3:14 omg simplynailogical and Colleen colab!!!!!!!!!!
Wow wow wait?!!! can men actually have period?!!🤔🤨😂
My Papa was the same way with cheese sticks He bit them instead of stringing it
They have to be Erik Stocklin.....cutest answer!💜
She said she write every day bro I'm on Pt. 10 of a fan fiction
Hamilton musical?!?! It’s my ALL TIME favorite musical ❤️
Men?! Men have periods?!
I love q&a videos! So glad you got a CC posted :)
Oh my god, Colleen, you can’t just ask people why they’re not Erik Stocklin...
But God the cows chickens and other animals on world to eat
You can start vegetarian than slowly go to vegan
Omg are you going as the cast of wicked - you glinda  , eric - the good witch and flynn as the flying monkey
I think your family costume is gonna be little shop of horrors, mostly cuz Flynn would be an ADORABLE Audrey 2!!!!!!!!!
Woahhhhhh really 💗🌸🦋👍🏼👍🏼🤣
My mam does the same thing as Eric!!😂😭
OMG PLS SAY UR DRESSING AS THE SKYLAR SISTERS LOL
Little shop of horrors and Flynn is the plant 😂
I think you guys will be Hamilton inspired because the Ballingers love Hamilton
OMG on your party wedding when it happens eventually you should invite like 1 or 2 fans to come
Honestly I never thought i would ever hear Colleen consider going vegan!
I had literally just finished re-watching the video of her reacting to her wedding footage when I  saw her upload this video 🤯
I have a book for Flynn and it's called my little excavator or something like that and I have know clue how to give it to u
Woah it’s actually Tuesday for once haha
I couldn't click fast enough
Do you think Flynn when gets older he will be a bully
So fun to have Coleen's corner again. I found you more recently but I've watched most of your older videos and love Coleen's corner. Also, have you tried seeing if flynn likes the types of toys that are basically gears that toddlers can put together? I'm guessing you have, your answer just made me think of it. Also, I very much respect what you said about veganism. It makes sense to me
The costume is defiantly little shop Audrey Seamour and Audrey 2 how cuteeeeee!!!!!
To the kids learning about the body in school, don't listen to Colleen. Guys don't have periods, if they are having periods its because they are a female.  My baby cousin is learning about the body and is 8 years old and told his mom he has a uterus because his teacher said he did. Thats soooooo messed up teaching a young boy that.
You are so beautiful Colleen! The screen froze on my phone and it was you semi laughing and it was the prettiest picture of you!
If you go vegan I don’t care but you do realise that the chickens lay eggs anyway they can’t stop that and also is cows don’t get there milk out there udders will explode (I wrote that egg thing and forgot that chickens laying eggs is harsh in America oops)
The Schuyler sisters -  Colleen- Angelica Eric - Eliza Flynn- And Peggy
that title did me an alarm. I does a concern. I support whatever, so I hope it works out for you and you're gifted a second love burrito from mother nature.
Liked for your vegan ideals
It is tuesday!
For halloween you should be: Idea1 You and eric - bakers Flynn- bread Idea 2 You and eric - farmers Flynn - pumpkin
You should do a 30 day vegan challenge! :) My last day is tomorrow! I’ve been a vegetarian for a year and I’m trying to slowly transition into a more vegan life style.
Halloween costume guess: Erik as Seymour, Colleen as Audrey, and Flynn as The Plant (Audrey II)
I would never even try vegan butter and or cheese. Sounds horrid. Meat all the way.
well at least we know if she gets pregnant I was an accident?
The Von Traps!
You and your family should do Hamilton, Eliza, and Philip for Halloween.
WHAT IF THE COSTUME IS ELIZA AS COLLEEN, ERIC AS HAMILTON AND FLYNN AS PHILIP
Beetle juice ♥️. Is that your Halloween idea???  If not?  Do it!  Flynn as Beetle Juice!
I can’t wait and I thought of a name for it girl: Chloe boy:kory
Trick or treating was banned in California
Imagine flynn being a protective big brother
At about 3:00 pm I’m coming out with my first vlog! Come check it out!✌️❤️😁 Also Flynn is TOO CUTE😍
MOVE TO TORONTOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
It’s your choice to have another baby!! I hope you do tho because your create the cutest sweetest kids!! Don’t let everyone get to you!! You’re thinking very responsible
I hope your family costume is Alexander, Eliza, and Philip Hamilton!!!! IF IT IS THAT WOULD BE SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!!!!!
PLEASE MOVE TO TORONTO NOT VANCOUVER YOU ARE MY IDOL AND I LIVE IN TORONTO
Biting into string cheese is everything, nibble fast little bits
First thing I thought of what the family costume could be was Eliza, Hamilton, and Philip 👁👄👁
Sustainable and cruelty free is one thing. Veganism is another you can do as you choose and eat what you want, but The human body is made to be an omnivore and removing meat and hunting from you’re diet is not environmentally conscious. The environment has a max carrying capacity that we help limit by eating meat (as do other animals) and depending where you live the transportation used to get vegan food is worse than eating the meat.
Why does colleen always say that some men have periods like what men have periods
greaseeeeee costumes
imm a guess that their dressing up as watrise
No don’t  be a vegetarian your go to eat some animal eat all of the animals food
You should def do a harry potter themed outfit!! Imagine Flynn as a mandrake, in a pot, and Colleen and Eric as the students.  does anyone know what i mean?? Cuz that would be adorbs
Super pregnant and your Flynn reminds me of my Richard and watching you talk about why your proud of him I'm bawling!!
Does Colleen read the comments
I'm thinking Hamilton where Colleen is Angelica, Eric is Eliza and Flynn is Peggie lol
Can you just get married in your house in the US? In the UK it has to be a licensed venue, with an authorised person, you have to ‘give notice’ at least 29 days before... otherwise none of it is legal
Me 13: *no period*  Colleen: “I was 14”   Me: OMG thank you lord!!
You NEED NEED to do a house tour! we never see your room or Flyns room on the vlogs
Get Lego or wen flin is older meccano :)
I instantly thought of heathers for some reason
Colleen: where my anxiety brothas and sistas at? Me: HERE.  COLLEEN. HERE. IM RIGHT HERE
comment back☺️ I also have a YouTube channel you can comment on too.  Ps I love your videos they make my day.💜
I know it´s 2020 but I still liking your Q&A videos, I miss Colleen´s  corner  : ´(
you could get flyn a toy transformer because some of them can turn into cars when you like play with them  my brother really likes them (maybe give it a try)
Yes!! Love your response to the vegan question!! I’ve been vegan for 9 years but I agree with you. Being vegan in this very non/vegan world isn’t easy especially for people who’ve eaten meat and dairy their whole lives. But switching from dairy milk to plant milk, trying to make at least 1 meal a day plant based, participate in meatless Monday, etc are all wonderful steps towards a healthier planet and better for the animals and your health. Any steps no matter how big or small towards veganism should be applauded! :)
Me and my family went vegan and there is  literally have everything in the wold that is vegan so I totally support you going vegan.
The blanket in the background looks like ground beef lmao
i looooove your hair in this video
I've never clicked so fast❤️👶
The theme for your Halloween costume is probably Hamilton or Waitress
"I'm kind of afraid all my rights are gonna be taken away as a woman." MOOD.
Excuse me... WHO THE HECK BITES STRING CHEESE?!?!
My first thought for the family costume was Little Shop of Horrors. Erik as Seymour, Colleen as Audrey, and Flynn and Audrey II.
Im one of ur anxiety sista's (BTW i have panic anxiety)
How much do you want to smack people when the baby question comes up 😂💜  and I feel the same way about string cheese it's called string cheese not bite cheese  😂
We love these videos!!
There Halloween costume is Hamilton!! What else will it be!!
I think you and your family will be Alexander Hamilton, Eliza, and Phillip Hamilton. That would be so cute
𝒐𝒌, 𝑪𝒐𝒍𝒍𝒆𝒆𝒏 𝒂𝒍𝒘𝒂𝒚𝒔 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌 𝑺𝑻𝑼𝑵𝑵𝑰𝑵𝑮 𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒔𝒉𝒆 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝑺𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶 𝑷𝑹𝑬𝑻𝑻𝒀 𝑹𝑵!!!!!
YES to all vegan comments you made!
Spoiler alert: their not planning for a second baby
Some men have periods!?
Wait... Men have period???
Seymour, Audrey, and Audrey II from Little Shop?! Because that would be perfect.
Cartoons
Hey Colleen! I think moving to Canada is an awesome idea! I've lived here my whole life and I wouldn't want to live any where else. It's way safer than America by a LOT, plus, we get free healthcare :) I live in the Ontario Tri-cities (Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo) and I love it here.
Great video xxxxxx    love always xxxxxx
Have you showed Flynn the movie Cars from pixar? And do you think he’ll lose his mind?
I bite into string cheese as well lol...
Would you be vampires or is that too basic because Eric was a vampire right?
Yesss go vegan and move to Vancouver :) 🍌🥦🥥🍋
if your not Eliza eric isn't hamilton and Flynn isn't Phillip I'm suing
Y’all the next time she asks us to ask her questions we all need to ask when she is going to make another sassy dance. I always ask her but I feel like she never sees it.
Idk about people being vegan but you saying men have periods? Um no. The one thing many woman can relate on it having a period and you’re gonna say men have one too? Women with vaginas have periods.
Colleen: "Where my anxiety brothers and sisters at?😊✌🏻" Me: 😊✌🏻✨
Everyone's guessing Waitress and Hamilton for the Halloween costumes. I'm going with Little Shop of Horrors. I think Erik would make a good Seymour.
I just stared at her cat throughout this whole video lol
R u going to be Eliza Hamilton and Philip
Either waitress or Hamilton
the only people who disliked this Video are people who are jealous of her
Hamilton???
hamilton or waitress
Am I the only one who loves her Q&A's
I feel like their family Halloween costume should be the Wizard of Oz. I just feel like that would be so cute!! I can see Flynn as the Lion. SO CUTE!!!
Eliza Alexander and Phillip Hamilton
Hi
If u move u won’t be close to your family friends though
“And even some men have periods” COLEEN SAID TRANS RIGHTS
HAHA, here's a idea: Find a Canadian surrogate and maybe that will expedite your move to Canada! Lol
I have a theory that shes preggers already. She keeps saying how bad her allergies are, and using the word "craving" they say when you look to the left you are telling the truth and when you look to the right its a lie. She looks to the right when saying they don't want a baby right now and arent trying to for a while and looks to the left when saying it will probably be on accident....a loosely strung rediculous theory, probably yes. Puzzle pieces to the truth shes been hiding??! Maybe. 😂😂😂
You are the best and so I Flynn and Erik
2:52 yeahhhhhh anxiety isn't a trend Colleen
i think the theme is Haters back off
Imagine a little shop of horrors them with Flinn as a crazy cute killer plant 😂
Thanx for sharing that Colleen. I also feel our rights could be taken away.
I could never go vegan because I developed eating disorders and depression/anxiety when I went
For Halloween costume it is definitely going to be Hamilton cuz girl I already know you and I know that you love Hamilton 💞 love you Colleen
i miss the day when not everything revolves around politics, when everyone kept their political opinions to themselves like they should be.
Audrey and Seymour from Little shop of Horrors, and Flynn will be Audrey 2
IT IS TUESDAY TODAY AKA EARLY
“Even some men have periods” You’re a fkin idiot
You literally have no idea how fast I clicked on this.....
I literally cried when I saw the title and the. Realized it’s just a colleens corner
i loveeee colleen's corner
Literally almost started crying
newsies? katherine, jack, les?
for halloween costumes this year i think you are doing Hamilton.
I love theses keep doing them please
I'm gonna guess Hamilton because that what what my family is doing
Me when I saw the title: OMG OMG OMG AHHHHH IM WATCHING THIS NOWWWW!!AHHHH
To answer one question, they did extend the travel ban to and from canada until October 21st, however, they've kept extending it monthly and I don't see it being lifted any time soon
Making little choices and efforts to better the world is incredibly impactful! We love that ❤️ completely agree and support that
And if flynn grows up to be in the lgbtq community how would you react?
I like Colleen's corners! Please do them every week again!!!
I LOVE YOU COLLEN!!!!
She’s scared to get pregnant because her right to abortion might be taken away? WTF
Anxiety and OCD sista ❤️ Edit: Why do people get triggered about people being vegans? Cry about it, it’s food/moral choices. Doesn’t hurt you any.
Hamilton costume!!!
annie the musical for your halloween costume
Almond milk is also bad for the environment😉
Northern Vancouver 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤❤
Waitress
"but it's not 2015, it's 2020 and not many people want Q&A's anymore"  Me: always loving Q&A's :)))))))))
My birthday is this month 🎉🎉
Hamilton
well Q&As are my favourite kind of video so...
Love this
Scientifically men or males don’t have periods.
I think the costume would be wicked, waitress, or Hamilton
You make my day so much better
Things her Halloween costume could be  -Hamilton  -Waitress  - (comment and I’ll add to the list) - Miranda, Patrick, Froze toes! - - - - - -
Halloween costume idea: Little Shop of Horrors!
miss these videos not gonna lie xoxo
You’re Halloween Costume it’s gonna be based on the Musical Greece
WAIT.... how do the mens has the periods O.o
Can u tell me why I try my best to be happy in front of my mum and she still says I am being grumpy no matter what I do 😓I feel like giving up
Does Flynn have a wooden train set? My 7 yr old has always been fascinated by mechanics and how things work... he’s been train obsessed since he was about Flynn’s age.
i saw the title and thumbnail and i instantly clicked.
can you please talk about your ex marriage I know it's kind of a touchy subject but it just be interesting to see how you would reflect
Can I ask what rights of yours as a woman you’re afraid of getting taken away & from who????
People need to stop asking other people when they are having a baby. It's rude. Just stop. If she decides to get pregnant again, she'll tell us. If they decide to adopt, she'll tell us. Colleen shares a lot of her life online, so she won't hide this information.
colleen being so excited for halloween is a whole mood
Hamilton or waitress
colleen having her period at 14: "it's a wonderful life" me getting mine at 9: oops..
Making vegan efforts day-to-day, helps. Any amount of actions to try to be better for the planet and animals is impactful. So thank you for bringing that up, Colleen
Hi
How fast did u clicked?
Btw you look gorgeous
me when i saw this title: oOop
I mean Katy Perry got pregnant during the pandemic.    I wonder who she's voting for in the election.
Hamilton Hamilton HAMILTON Erick will be Hamilton Colleen with be Eliza and fin will be Philip maybe😘😘😘
Loving the content you slowly became my favourite YouTuber I keep gravitating towards your videos more and more
the blankte in the bg looks like it's made of earthworms
Im a vegetarian and I totally agree with what u said!
North Vancouver? We'd be neighbours!! And in my opinion, it is the best part of Vancouver, especially for kids (although obviously I am biased)
Hamilton!
I think it's about waitress cause u were in it or the sound of music
here at 99K views
Just to let you know coz a lot of people get this confused but veganism is for animal liberation and isn’t to do with environmental/health reasons, youd class that as plant based, cruelty free etc
Yo don’t ask people with uteruses about their reproduction. WTH.
I got the notification in my subscription box when i went into youtube but I didn't get an actual notification which is weird usually its the opposite
What do you mean some men have periods
I like cheese to much and seafood I eat string cheese every day
You are so brave and I’m always thinking of your family and sending good vibes ❤️
I feel like Flyn and Jacob would end up building lots of stuff together
The Halloween costume theme I think is either Hamilton or waitress
Who still watches this old gross lady?
Love your song I’m becoming Colleen 😃
PLEASE DO FAVORITES AGAIN PLEASE
PLEASE DO MONTLY FAVORITES AGAIN I MISS THEM SO MUCH PLEASE
thank you for your videos, ive been watching you everyday during quarantine to help me with my loneliness/depression

When you suddenly get an Instagram comment that Colleen answered you in her video and you’re like wait what 😂🤯
You ask her your questions and she replays her answers are strange??? But atleast she try’s  COLLEENS CORNER  Soz I don’t rly remember it might be lame 😂
I literally saw the title and immediately clicked.
Omg
She was 14???!!!  I was 11😱
Speaking from experience being pregnant during a pandemic is both scary and horrid roll on February 2021 🌈👶🏻💙
Ok but are you legally married? If so, there’s an anniversary date....
I can’t wait for the day when Flynn is like “...my mom and dad were on a Netflix show together??!”
YES MOVE TO CANADA! Don’t fear nothing here 💁‍♀️   Also I am moving to Vancouver next year and my bf is going to school for script writing! Maybe he’ll end up writing with you and Christopher one day 🤪
Me sees the title : OMG YASSSSSS    Teacher on zoom call: exuse me?
ERIK STOCKLIN😂😂😂😂
costum~adams family
You should move to Ottawa
I want string cheese now 😂😂😂
OMD!! You could be Christine Daée, Eric is Eric (aka the Phantom of the Opera) and Flynn is the monkey from the music box!!!! 😱😱😱  At least that's what I will do with my future bae and baby. lol
If you want to be vegan take little steps maybe become vegetarian first or peskiraran
Phantom of the opera? For the Halloween costume.
Hamilton?
I read the title and legit said “EXCUSE ME” out loud
Love you
I love when Flynn says  dars I cracked  me up 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am with you on womens rights being in jeopardy.
I love youuu

OMG I FORGOT TO ASK MY QUESTION!!!! Idk how I missed it BUT... do you know yet if you will be homeschooling Flynn?
I think its Hamilton!
Do beetlejuice the musical costumes
2:26 wait...WHAT?? She said "almost every single girl has a period and even some men have periods"....what??
I love Colleen's Corner! I know it isn't popular anymore but I love it!
Canada loves you!! 🇨🇦
Colleen: Were are my anxiety brothers and sisters at✨✌✨✌ Me:✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌🙃😔😵😖😩✨✨✨✨✨✨✨😂😂
costume idea! Colleen and Erik: race car drivers Flynn: a car
The family costume is high school musical!!!!
Maybe for the costume like Eliza Schuyler, Alexander Hamilton, and Philip
you look like you are 20 how old are you
SO proud of your effort to make incredible choices to help the planet and animals <3 I believe in you, go at your own pace. I am a vegetarian and have been for 8 years, and I make as many conscious vegan decisions as possible. You got this <3 Together we will all make the world better for not only us, but for animals as well.
My two year old brother will run around and say “I FAST BOY!”  I love him so much
Also Veganish over here!
Colleen..I bite my string cheese 😬
Litterly they make me soo happy 🤩🥰
who wants colleen to get pregnant again thumbs up if yes
When I saw this I clicked this video so fast like you’re having another baby on baby number two like what
I love the endings of her vids i start dancing to IM BECOMING COLLEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNN 😌💖💖
Men get periods?
You’re costume should be heathers
Men do not have periods! What’s that about? Please do r spread false information.
Men have periods 🤔?
Bruh... Flynn is smarter than I will ever be. 💕😂
anxiety sista🙋🏼‍♀️
I also bite into string cheese 🙈. I don’t want to put my fingers all over it. I just want to eat it..🤷🏻‍♀️
What do you mean "men have periods?" 😂😂
my best friend lives in north van 🇨🇦❤️🤩
wait...some men have periods?!?
Wizard of oz!
I think they are doing a Hamilton theme costume 🎃🎃🎃🎃
I can relate with Erik, I sometimes bite into the string cheese too 😅 😋 🤪
The fact that Americans are fearing for their rights :(
This sucks I can’t watch he video without ads popping up...guess I won’t watch it.
I have postpartum anxiety. Except I was never pregnant. So it’s just anxiety
Yeah....alomond milk in coffee doesn't work!
I pressed this video faster than jojo Siwa can say her intro...and that says a lot
Heeeyyyy girl I’m ur angsiaty SISTOW!!!!
While I can respect and understand all different opinions and ideas when it comes to politics I am curious to know what rights you think are potentially being taken away
Flynn is so caring, and is always making sure everyone is included because he picked it up from you, and people who are close to him.
5:28 are you guys doing the 3 bears like mama bear papa bear and baby bear? (as your family costume for halloween)
I think their costume will be wattriess
I’ve always bitten into string cheese! I don’t like to touch my food with my hands so if you bite into it, you can hold it with the wrapper
Cats! Your husband could be rum tum tugger
Girl, I love you and your whole family.  SO yeah
I justt lovee youuu!!!!!!
Justin Trudeau is idiotic and he is planning on putting quarantine on longer until at least probably after Christmas
It's weird to have complete strangers begging you to have a baby...that's messed up. I'm having a pandemic pregnancy and it's actually been amazing! But, I also live in Canada where my basic healthcare is free and my doctor is open.
All of your rights are going to be taken away as a woman? That’s a bit dramatic.
I love Colleen corners!
Seriously, I absolutely love the so effortless and subtle ways that you are inclusive! Like, just simply saying "almost every single girl has periods, and even some men have periods" is such a small gesture, but still speaks volumes, and it's something that most people wouldn't even remember to add!
You ask her your questions, and she replyyys, her answers are lame but at least she tries     Colleens corner
If you have baby number 2 I hope for  a girl 👧 😘
Hey! It's actually Tuesday!!!!
I'm sorry but Eric needs to seek help because WHY WOULD YOU BITE DOWN ONTO STRING CHEESE its called STRING CHEESE for a reason
Ok but who has the patience to peel the string cheese??? I’m with Eric on this one 😂
I think Flynn is an engineer in the making 🤪
Colleen it's cold in Canada you shouldn't move it's always cold
Hamilton  Alexander, Eliza and Phillip
Hamilton
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK ABT IS HOW THE PINK BLANKET LOOKS LIKE UNCOOKED GROUND BEEF
i eat string cheese both those ways lol
YES
Colleen the click bait queen 👏 I’m not mad at it tho
Wait.. I’m really excited, adopted or not!! 🤍 I’m excited for Flynn to have a little baby brother or sister 🥺
i don’t understand why people dont enjoy q and a’s anymore. i love them!
I’m vegan, and agree that every little bit helps. Millions of imperfect vegans will do more good than a few perfect vegans 😊❤️
I think their costume will either be waitress, Hamilton or Miranda
Love you❤️
um whoever doesn't agree w her about the veganism.. why lol ILYY COLLEEN
You could be the flintstones
Hamilton
I really enjoyed this video
I think there costume will be Hamilton. Colleen will be Eliza, Eric will be Alex, and Flyin will be philip
rocky horror or phantom of the opera
Colleen and Erik are relationship goals
When I saw the title I was like WAIT WHAT I really thought she was pregnant lol but I know she would not tell us like this she would make a video about it love you colleen
Hi
No more baby
Hamilton!! Lol
Your comment about you not wanting anyone but your husband is so cute and exactly how I feel about my bf/future hubby💗😁
i love you colleen💗💗💗💗
So excited to see the new vlogs pollen posts this week!!!
Heres the time stamp when she talks about baby #2: 6:42 Ur welcome
What about a children’s album
a CRYING I LOVE THISSSS
Colleen’s reaction to moving to Canada is deadass me. I wanna live there so bad😭
YAYYYYY
the blanket on the bed reminded me of ground beef
YAYYYYYY
I think it’s high school musical
I bite into my string cheese
Girl, we'd love to have you and the fam here in Canada!  Love from Prince Edward Island, Canada!
@9:21 This makes me so happy since I’m a vegan myself :)) Baby steps is all that matters...I’m happy that you’re choosing to make baby steps and have alternatives for foods to better this world
You know what will be so interesting Miranda and Jet ( Liza Koshy's character) having an online date
Flynn's got a great mum and dad. Honestly there was a point in my life where I was away from my mother for 4 years (not my own choice because I'd never separate myself from her) and watching you're videos growing during those years, your personality reminded me so much of my mom. So with that said, I know Flynn is seriously lucky to have a mama like you.
Honestly I think you would like Vancouver. I’ve lived here my whole life and it’s a pretty nice place.
My grandma died a few days ago and your videos make my day so much better ❤
I think the musical theme is Waitress REASON:     It's pretty obvious 😁
omg yes Colleen, small choices makes a different
HAMILTON COSTUME??
my birthday is tomorrow
Would u consider adopting?
Show Flynn Formula 1 or Nascars
Pls be Hamilton, Eliza and Phillip!!!!!
Heyy
you should do some mukbangs with kory, erik, and flynn.
I bite into string cheese😢😳

Colleen said ‘where’s my anxiety Sisters and brothers at?’  Answer- I’m right here.

For the cars and flynn question my cousin does the exact same thing 😂

37 minutes early yay I can't wait
Is it hamilton??
You know what will be so interesting Miranda and Jet ( Liza Koshy's character) having an online date
Ur worried about all ur rights taken away if trump is elected? Really? So u actually plan on havin an abortion?

That's so crazy how the first video I watched was about your speeding ticket
You know what will be so interesting Miranda and Jet ( Liza Koshy's character) having an online date
The cat in the back!!!! I love that cat! So cute!
Colleen*
HAMILTON
Daisy in the background lmao
Anyone who isn’t Erik stocklin: 👁👄👁
my thumb never moved so fast as soon as i seen this i clicked
Flynn will be the next Elon Musk and make cars
I feel like everyone doesn't need to be full on vegan in order to help our planet out! I really like the idea of reductionism--if everyone just reduced the amount of animal products they used, they'd be helping the environment a lot! I don't think I could ever be fully vegan, and I don't believe in food-shaming. Hopefully we can get away from practices like factory farming, so being nonvegan is a more viable option for our planet.
I haven’t watched this BUT FRICKIN HOPE THIS IS TRUE
If you do have baby number 2 whether you adopt or naturally get pregnant or IVF and literally if you don't have a mini eric or mini collen what would you name her/him?
Who else clicked on this so fast. My heart dropped.
I think this year their costumes are gonna be on the musical theatre Hamilton
Yay !!! I listen while I clean to Colleen hahaha
I think Colleen may be Eliza, Eric Alexander Hamilton, and Flynn maybe philip. Idk but it is from Hamilton and Colleen said the costume is Theater themed and Hamilton is theater.
pleeaassseee let this be true!!!!
I think for Halloween you will be characters from Hamilton!
Love these videos
"My one relationship condition is that they be Erik Stocklin." 😂😂😂😂
Unsubscribe from you?😧 I would never!
I love you Colleen just so you know! ❤️  I agree that anything you can do to help is good, BUT the thing with veganism is that you aren’t doing what you can to help it you’re just cutting out animal products here and there but continue to eat it most of the time, you are just lessening the bad you’re doing but the thing is that you’re still contributing to the bad. Once you are vegan THEN you can say that you can do your best to help to not contribute. But being vegan is really just the middle ground, you’re not contributing to the cruelty but you’re also not doing anything to help for example sharing veganism with others and protesting and so on. It is the same concept as back then when people had slaves, would having less slaves then everyone else be considered helping? I don’t think it would, having no slaves would mean you’re not contributing but you’re also not actively helping. That’s when people who protested and freed slaves came in and that is really what was helping.
I- calm down😔  Jk lol
I’ve never clicked a video faster, I’m ready for the clickbate tho (sorry if I spelt that wrong)
I think that the family-themed costume this year will he HAMILTON! (I hope)
I LIVE IN VANCOVERRRRRRRRR
💖💖💖 love you Colleen! You’re amazing!
omg my dad bites his string cheese also and it drives me crazy every time!
i never clicked faster
I play with a couple guys online who live on Victoria Island in Vancouver. From what I know it's a beautiful place, but I don't know how you feel about taking a ferry back and forth depending on what you're doing.
Who else can’t wait for baby #2 whenever it does happen 😍
The three bears 🐻???
To figure out the day of your wedding, you could go to the photos in your camera roll of that day, sail up on the photo, and it will tell you what day it was...you should tell us too when you find out:))))❤️❤️
Did she said man have periods?!?!
Hamilton?
This was like 30 mins ago and the amount of likes and comments she has I would have in like a 20 years 🤣😂😲
WAITRESS.
me: in class turning off my camera to watch her video,        me: realizing i'm unmuted while colleen is talking abt her first period
NOOOOOO WHY DOES HE BITE INTO THE CHEESE
I’m dairy free from a dairy allergy and girl lemme tell you, IT IS SO HARD!!!! Especially when you go to restaurants, or when your entire family in your house buys dairy and you can’t have any and you feel left out. 😢 😂 (Edit: especially since I haven’t been dairy free my entire life I just developed this allergy two years ago)
Are you being eliza=colleenn philip=flynn and alexander=eric for halloween?
Y'all should be Angelica, Eliza and Peggy 😂
Isn’t almond milk bad for the environment too? Lol
Never been so early lol 😂
Wizard of oz
OMG YESSSSSSSSS IM SO EXCITED
Take your time Colleen, we will respect any decision you make ❤️❤️
I’ve literally never clicked so fast...
“Even some men have periods” UHM NOOOO they don’t. Why the hell would u put out false information?
🔥🔥
Little changes in your lifestyle towards veganism are awesome, and will make it easier for everyone to go vegan in future! Even 5 years ago there were WAY less vegan options than there are now because demand has picked up so much. The more demand there is, the more accessible vegan food will be for everyone!
Colleen can u be my virtual mom     👉👈
I see you’re joining the quarantine trend...
Hi Colleen
Lol once i saw the title of the video I IMEDIANTLY pressed on it
I BITE INTO STRING CHEESE
Hamilton
If it’s not Hamilton, Eliza, and Phillip..... NEED
God bless this family amen
Flynn used to be EXACTLY like me lol. I used to look at the cars wheels.
You really got me with the Title. I’m honestly a little disappointed even though I totally understand.
I clicked as fast as I could  IDK what to expect
Boooo
I think it might be greese because I want to be a pink lady for this year
Can't wait to watch this 😍
I would love an autobiography from Colleen. I know we know a lot about her but I’d love reading her childhood stories and how she got where she is
look for toys with  interchangable gears and magnetic gears because he will love that...my nephew was like that...
Little Shop of Horrors!  That’s gotta be the Halloween costume.
I love colleen corners! Please never stop..... <3
Slight background I am a geologist and took several environment and environmental geologist classes. While going vegan can help with some carbon emissions it won't really put a dent. What is really contributing to global pollution is fossil fuel burning. And not just like everyone driving their cars it's mostly large factories. So buying fast fashion, that vegan leather purse and jacket are actually plastic and we're probably made in a factory in india or china that is burning coal. Most of the carbon emissions that are polluting our planet are made just by a few companies. So going vegan isn't going to save the planet voting in global leaders that will influence the rest of the world will. Also, most of the pollution is not made by American or Europe.
I clicked this so fast you don't even know 😳
YESSS COLLEENS CORNER! I’ve been watching since the very first one!
I’m calling it: Hamilton, Eliza and Philip are their costume this year!
Hiiiiiii hope ur having an amazing day if ur reading missed Colleen's Corner ❤️💙💜💗💖💓💞💕
Aren't you supposed to be on a camping trip
OMG PLZZZZZZ TELL ME UR FAMILY COSTUME IS GOING TO BE WAITRESS INSPIRED
Thays not true you can go up to Canada as long as you quarantine for 2 weeks before you go and after you get there
Just a quick Daisy Mae appreciation comment because she's a cutie. Also it would be really cute if you, Erik, and Flynn were Jenna, Dr. Pomatter, and a pie from Waitress for Halloween.
Is it Eliza, Alexander and Philip? 😏
Microwave
If you move to Canada how will you handle being that far from family?
I love you queen!!!
Hamilton  is my guess
At school one girl asked, "Does anyone have a pad I can borrow?" And another said, "Yes, I do, but you can keep it because I don't want it back" XD
My idea for y’all’s costumes: 1. Waitress-at the end of the musical dawn WAS pregnant so maybe they do that??? 2. Schuyler Sisters-Flynn would be Peggy, Colleen would be Eliza, and Erik would be Angelica 3. Alexander Hamilton, Eliza, and Phillip- we obviously know who would be who  The first one I haven’t seen in the comments but the other two I did and thought they were amazing ideas!! ❤️  {edit} if y’all wanna have a friendly conversations about Hamilton.... here you are! looking at these replies makes me so happy!! 💕✨
OK BEFORE WATCHING IMA SCREAM EXITED HEREEEE
I SCREAMED
I think Finn is very much like Jacob when it comes to mechanical/how things work things.
It took me 0.1 seconds to click on this
My baby sister is so annoying right now. She will be 3 in October and she cries over anything. I am helping watch her while doing schoolwork and it’s very stressful. Any moms have any advice for me? Also that’s my dog in the picture
I wish I was 14 when I started I was 10 and the first girl in my grade, not to mention I was at my dads house and he was very concerned and I still feel so bad for him.
I audibly said “wat?” when I read the title
Petition for Colleen's corner to make a comeback, even if it's only 1 per month 💖
I love you so much
5:36 hethers / Hamilton
Ngl that throw on the bed looks like beef mince. It’s lush.....but looks like beef mince.
I grew up eating meat and animal products and became vegetarian 5 years ago and vegan a year ago and can I just say anyway u are trying to help the earth is great. It can be hard because it is being vegan is EXPENSIVEE. Honestly at the end of the day, if you are satisfied in your diet than do you girl
My guess is: Eric is Alexander Hamilton Colleen is Eliza And flynn is Phillip  ORRR The schuyler sisters
I'm waiting for the "I'm pregnant... AGAIN!" video.
I clicked INCREDIBLY fast. I don’t think I ever clicked faster in my life. AND IM STILL LATE!!! HOW? literally... HOW?!  As soon as it appeared in my screen I touched it.  IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE!!!!😂😂😂😂
I CLICKED YOUTUBE WITH A VIDEO IN MIND BUT THIS IS VERY MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
my sister bites into kit kat’s like erik with the string cheese. she doesn’t snap the two apart she just bites into both of them and it drives me crazy
Wait, what men have periods?!
Omgg I gotta ask where is that pink blanket from!!! So beautiful!! Love you Colleen ❤️
First
Will you get married again to Eric
Oh. It’s click bait. That’s how she gets her views. 😂😂
I don’t think I’ve ever clicked a video so fast 😨
6:50 is what you clicked on this video for Your welcome❤️
DO NOT be mistaken honey, Flynn is so sweet because of you and Erik. You might think you taught that to him but you have. Maybe unintentionally.  😍
All the comments be like-  aLl ThE cOmMeNtS- DoNt LiE wHoS bEeN a FaN oF cOlLeEn FoReVer?   *Plot twist*
Collen " he bites into string cheese"    Me: *can't breathe* 😳
omg imagine the schuyler sisters
Hiii
Flynn isn’t bringing her enough views 😂
when its actully tuesday......
Thought Halloween was banned there? I string my cheese too. I’m getting them.
Me casually looking through YouTube Me: Clicks Colleens Icon.  Me: *SEE'S* PLANNING BABY #2 Me: Has Heart Attack!!!
My husband bites string cheese
Maybe Angelica Eliza and Peggy?
watching this instead of class oops (it’s fine it’s just pe)
Waitress family costume
To the early squad reading this I am sending VIRTUAL HUGS... Stay safe <3
High school musicall????
Lmao no matter who gets elected nobody’s rights are gonna be taken away. 🙄 People don’t realize that presidents really don’t have that much power over the American people.
TELL ME Y'ALL GONNA DRESS AS THE WAITRESS MUSICAL, PLEASEEE
You know what makes me really sad and kinda disgusted?  Since things are tough here, Colleen and Erik wanna move to Canada.  But so many people will be left behind.  Moving across the boarder is incredibly expensive not to mention a logistical nightmare.  Colleen and Erik are privileged that they could up and leave after the pandemic, but there are so many people that they would be giving up on.  I gave up on our president four years ago, but you know who I haven’t given up on?  The kids in cages.  Teachers being underpaid.  Victims of sexual assault.  The black man who’s shot for nothing.  The woman who can’t get an abortion.  Those are who I stay for.
What rights are you talking about that could be taken away? The right to abort your baby? What else?
I bought Miranda's book My Diarrhe
I highly recommend Unnatural Vegan, shes pro transition foods and trying to be vegan as much as you can. Also Abby Sharp is a dietion with some vegan and non vegan recipes.
I appreciate your sentiment of making vegan-ish choices whenever and wherever you can, but if I'm being honest, judging by your vlogs you're not doing that. I'm not trying to attack you, I'm just trying to hold you accountable. You literally live in a vegan Metropolis. Not many groups of people have it easier being vegan than wealthy Los Angeles residents. I still love you, but that's how I see it. I encourage you to try a little harder. Especially since you already know it's what's best for the Earth.
Hamilton
you inspire so many ppl colleen💕💕💕we love youuu
Elphaba, Fiyero, the cub🥰 (wicked family Halloween costume)
I can tell you are so much happier! You are fighting your demons and winning 🥰
Ooh will your Halloween outfit be sugar butter and flour because of waitress?
Excuse me I bite into string cheese it’s the only way to eat it why take an extra 10 minutes to peel cheese into my mouth
I (Not lieing) said “ 🎶no wayyyay! No way , no way, no wayyayyayyy! 🎶 “

Hey Colleen ❤️💜🧡
Does Colleen reply ? ...
Omg coleens corner I missed it so much
hamilton
Girl I clicked on this way to fast 🤠
I love your last answer 😂 #relationshipgoals lol Luv U Colleen! 🥰💕❤
I've never clicked so fast
Nobody cares about villas, ferraris, houses with glitter because we cannot relate, whereas with Colleen's Corner and a simple QnA about simple stuff in life, we can connect and relate more! I think you need to stop apologizing every time you make a Colleen's Corner video, it is not outdated, it will never be outdated and we will always enjoy it and support you even if you do it every day, you know this ;) so just chill and have fun with us <3
i miss Colleens corner it brings me back to the days when i first subscribed
MEN GET PERIOD 😼😸yes I’m a bruh girl 😸😸
i love you colleen but i just wanted to let you know that almond milk has some really bad environmental impacts and i wouldn’t necessarily recommend it if you’re trying to help in any way you can! oat milk is the best option :)
I think Flynn would be a great big brother
I've always wondered how you would react if you had a daughter
that oz movie i think
who else wants colleen to have another baby 🥺
at minute 6:43 she is talking about baby #2 :D
Colleen, we love Colleen's Corner!
Please do the update video of the My Family song!!!!!
Just saying they go through a crying phase again
Oh my-
i’ve been eating vegan for 2 years but officially 1 year strictly only vegan. it takes a long time to get into it, go for it and do what you can :)
Whether  you get pregnant or adopt Flynn is going to be a great big brother, when ever you decide for that to happen
Costume ideas:  Flynn, pumpkin  Colleen and Erik, farmers  Flynn, race car driver with his car  Colleen and Erik, pit stop crew!!  Who else thinks this would be so cute!!
Becoming vegan or vegetarian is a great thing, it’s a healthier lifestyle and plus on top it saves the planet and animals, I only was a vegan for a  year. But it’s very hard when someone in my family disagrees with me and always talks bad about me because I want a healthier lifestyle. On top of that my daughter and husband doesn’t care about all of this so it’s much harder to cook for me and a whole other meal all the time.!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hopefully the ban doesn't end anytime soon
Daisy on the bed the whole time is so cute
I kinda want a haters back off movie. Just me? Okay lol
I was LITERALLY biting into a string cheese when you said that's what Eric does 🙃 😂
All of the comments are people saying "all of the comments...."
I think the costume could be Hamilton?
hahahahahahahahahahaha
I feel ur gonna dress as the Hamilton family , with Flynn and philip
Yay I’m pretty early
Hi Colleen
HAMILTON!!! I think..
The way you pronounced ~absolutely~ sounded soooo German
Don't worry Colleen, you can eat whatever you want and however you eat, I will still be a fan. As a vegetarian myself, I get the struggle, especially because dairy is essential in my culture and in my life in general. I've always thought about going vegan, but I just can't. I understand. Plus, you are really inspirational to me, and  keep doing what you are doing. Love you!
In the heights!!! I think..
Our family absolutely loves you!
no one: all the comments: no one:
I think it’s Cats ?
Some men get periods?? What!? Does she mean trans men or are there actual biological men (not intersex) that have periods?
The burping is so annoying, I'm trying to eat here 😂
I bite into string cheese 😬
When I tell you I squealed       I squealed hard so hard
That woman’s rights thing gets me more scared and angry than anything else right now. I swear that if I get discriminated against because I have the wrong body parts I will move to Canada myself. I’m 13. That’s not right.
I CLICKED THIS SO FRICKING FAST
Ummmmm so the reason people are unsure is because you got married during dinner 😂 are you legally married with the state of California????
I don’t know why but I think it’s Hamilton themed. Eric’s Alexander Hamilton. Collens Eliza Hamilton, and Flynn’s Phillip Hamilton.
I don’t realize it was a colleens corner I dyed
Im leaving a comment cuz she said to at the end hahahahahaaaa
i love you ❤️
I know the costume is probably not Waitress inspired (that would be too easy), but it would so cute if they were Dawn, Ogie, and a (pumpkin) pie for halloween! 🥧🎃
Early
We want Flynn to be a big brudder!
Men have periods? Whaaat? 🤣🤣🤣
What if you just watched the video instead of spamming the comments?
Yay!
Ok i like vegans but I do think it’s ok to have milk because some cows have to be milked to keep form them form Hurting
can we act like i dint say COLLEN CONTROLL URSELF IK WE R ALL GOING CRAZY RN BUT UR STRONG when i read the title ._.
i think the group  halloween costumes will be waitress for obvious reasons or hamilton because parker and bailey seem a little obsessed
Wizard of oz??  U as  Dorothy   Flynn as the lion   corry as the tin man and Erik as scare crow??
Yes
Love you!
Colleen- "Nobody eats string cheese like that, it's not right."   Me- I'll eat my cheese however I like lol
I’ve never hated a pre video ad more than right now
wHeN bOtS tYpE lIkE tHiS iT lOoKs LiKe ThErE hAvInG a SeIzUre It doesn’t look cool or catch anyone’s attention
me waiting for her to be pregnant “ on accident “
I agree with the whole being pregnant during a global pandemic and a scary political time is TERRIFYING! I have become an introvert... to the point that my mom is concerned!
I think your Halloween costume will be the Hamilton’s so Eliza Alexander and Phillip
flynn in the cousins theatre productions will 100% be the director
this is not fair doing this title misleading us all to think you're actually going to get pregnant🙁
When she posted it on a Tuesday
I AM SO EXCITEDDDDD TO WATCH THIS VIDEOOOO!!!!💕💕💕
"almost every single girl has periods and some men have periods" colleen said trans👏 rights👏
Flynn snack idea: freeze gogurt yogurt tubes to make yummy and healthier popsicles!!
I saw the title and I got super excited !!!!!😁😄😄
I haven't clicked fast..
I think I broke my finger from clicking so fast 👁👄👁
The biggest clickbaiter ever!
Early Early Early!
halloween costume : waitress themed and flynn is a pie
I thought she said she wasn’t gonna have another baby I always hoped she would cause I want flin to have a little buddy
Being vegan is a journey even though, I myself, is not vegan but it's the effort you put into our planet Earth. It's better to have our imperfections and effort on being vegan instead of strictly sticking to other people's path. Yea, we do things differently but it's small steps we can take. :)
I think the family Halloween costume will be based on Hamilton  Like if you agree
CALM DOWN! lol girl yes people are sooooo obsessed with others reproductiveness... the second I got married... when are you have a baby... iv been doing fertility treatments for years and have never gotten pregnant and soooo many people in my life know this is a touchy subject yet they continue to ask me if im pregnant or when i will have a baby! people just keep your noses on your face! K thanks!
Move to Ontario!
Hamilton for ur costume
Colleen’s corner strikes again. It gets me every time.
oh i clicked fast i thought it was the vlog for the day 😅
I feel like this was a click bate kind of..
I have zero issues or concerns about being vegan but just for educational purposes, almond milk (and some other milk alternatives) aren't great for the environment either because the amount of water is takes to grow the plant and how much of the plant it takes to make the milk. Oat, hemp and coconut milk are the best alternatives for sustainability :) I had no idea either
Going vegan actually doesn’t help the earth, it actually makes it worse, at least if you stop eating meat. You see, cattle have to have a certain amount of grass and if it gets overpopulated, they won’t have enough grass to eat and will die on their own. It also helps with the methane in the air, less cattle=less methane. As a member of 4H and FFA, I would advise you to not go vegan unless you absolutely have to.
Hi
i love you colleen. youre my anxiety remedy
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💚💚💚💚💕💕💚👍💕💕💚
Cute cat
I love your hair in this video it looks so good !
You should get him some cog/gear toys. He might like those
Who else has been watching Colleen everyday to deal with their anxiety?
MY HEART IS POUNDING 💓
When i saw this i clicked SO FAST 💨
Wow I’m early :)
Colleen's Corner has always been my favourite thing Colleen's done
Who else thought the Schyuler sisters as soon as she said musical theatre costume??
I’m too early to look at the comments.. someone let me know when y’all figure out their family Halloween costume 😂 🎃👻
Pls be waitress for halloween
I'm guessing Hamilton?
Q and A?
Your videos are amazing
When I saw the title I was like oh yes
Daisy just sitting in the back
I literally love Colleens Corner like this is the content I signed up for
OMFG I LIVE IN VANCOUVER COLLEEN IF YOU MOVE HERE I WILL LEGIT BE SO HAPPY!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Korys holding it down with the uploads!
Colleen thank you making this colleens corner
I loved that ‘dealbreaker’ response 😁
Flynn is more extroverted than me 🤣
Colleen! I have something to say about becoming vegan! I know that some people instead of being vegan they eat vegan. -i am vegetarian myself-
I clicked faster than Miss Piggy could say OINK 🐷
I was so confused when I saw the title and it is a Colleen’s corner yay also I can’t wait to figure out what your family costume will be but as always stay safe wash your hands and I love you!!!!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜
Wizard of Oz!?! Is that the costume ?
When I read the title I started crying my mum asked what was wrong I said Colleen is getting another baby
Never click so fast
If you do move to Canada you should move to Vancouver island its really really nice there. you should visit when this is all over.
😘
Ok but I was not expecting this to be a Colleens corner
Did she say men get their periods?! 🤔
I clicked faster than jojo could say her intro!
hello!! it’s me your ✨a n x i e t y ✨ sister 😇
wHeN aRe gOnnA bE pregnaNT aGaIn?? *colleen suddenly turns in james charles*
The question: What is a weird thing that Erik does that he thinks is normal?  Colleen: STrIng chEEsE
If you guys dressed up as the three heathers, that would be ICONIC!
YES! Every little action counts! I was a vegetarian for 2 years before I fully transitioned to a vegan lifestyle. I did become a vegetarian overnight because I've never really been that much of a fan of meat, but my transition to a vegan lifestyle was more gradual because I've always loved dairy a lot. Every little thing that you do towards veganism helps out so much! Thank you for talking about it.
I GASPED WHEN I SAW THIS AND CLICKED FASTER THEN EVER
I love you so much 💕I watch every video you post on every channel you have and i love it! Big fan from Macedonia ❤
5:50 ohhh you will not like the terrible 2s
I also bite string cheese and people don't like it. I'm going to continue to do it.
Phantom of the opera
omg you would love it in Vancouver, please come!
i love colleens corner bring them back to every tuesday pls
I love you 😘
I love yoy
I've been vegan for 4 years but I agree with you - whenever you can make a vegan choice, it makes a difference!! it doesn't always have to be all or nothing. i have lots of videos on my channel with recipes and tips on veganism because i want to share my experience and help teach people about making more cruelty free choices!! 💖 love you colleen!
Love you girl
I think her costumes are waitress themed
I mean this in the nicest way possible but... that comforter really looks like ground beef i'm screaming
weird, I have that same petty dealbreaker.
6:45
I love you, Colleen! You always make me smile and laugh and I look up to you so much ❤❤
luv you!👍💕🎶
Aww flynn is so kind omg
I would scream for any more children to be Flynn’s best friend 🥺
I could never unsubscribe girl
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love how Flynn says KoKo when he has the spoon 😂
are you going to be jenna, dr. pomatter, and lulu? <3
Flynn would having a sliding omg
I can’t wait until you have another baby then Flynn can I have a little sibling that will be so cute
yayyyyy baby number 2!!!
Halloween costume: Hamilton? Legally blonde? Six? Heathers?
Does anybody else just bit string cheese? Like this comment it you of the same.
I love Colleen Corner ❤️❤️❤️
I swear Colleen is keeping us alive
Honestly tho Eliza , alexander,and philip would be good 🙈
Thank you for saying that Flynn is one and not 21 months or even worse 88 weeks. Ain’t nobody got time for that kind of math!
I LOVE COLLEEN CORNERS
I love you
Coleen if youre upset about ppl asking you about a second baby stop making videos  called "I want another baby" "planning for baby two" you know exactly what response thats gonna result in, it isnt gonna stop just because you ask them to relax 7 minutes into the video.
omg i really wanna know what the halloween costume is ahhh
5:39 HAMILTON!!!!!!!
If you guys aren’t Alexander Hamilton,Eliza, and Phillip for Halloween girlllllll
string cheese is better when it's stringed 😤
Daisy just chilling on the bed and not moving for ages is so funny to me 😂
This better not be click bait🥺
5:45 wizard of oz
i think the theme is waitress or wicked
“That they’re not Erik Stocklin” 🥺🥺 that’s so cute
Let's claim your here before trending card 🤠
7:30 i laughed and then cried :(
Honestly, I think their family costume is either Alexander, Eliza, and Phillip Hamilton or they’re doing something from Waitress👀
can you please do the ‘answering questions i’ve always avoided’ video!!
anxiety sisterrr🙋🏽‍♀️
ok I think veganism is ok as long as u don't tell people to be vegan when they don't want to.....basically don't push ur lifestyle onto other people and it's the same for religion and sexuality(and I'm talking about the straight people trying to make gay people believe they are straight)
the last question is so funny hahahahaha
One thing I love is vegan recipes because they incredibly inventive, can be so full of color, and have such interesting flavors! I don't always eat vegan but I looooove to cook and try new recipes!
OMG OMG OMG COLLEENS CORNER !!!!  ive missed it sooo much!  i love you colleen i am always here for you and your brothers channel early and everyday! Been here since the first colleens cornerrrrr👏🏼👏🏼 i love your videos and your work ethic👏🏼👏🏼🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰💞💞💞💞
FLYNN LIKES TO INCLUDE EVERYONE IN EVERYTHING. GO GET HIM A LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER 😂😂
I think your costume will/should be either..... Work work! Angelica!! Work work! Eliza!! AND PEGGY!!!! Or.... Alexander Hamilton, Eliza Hamilton, and baby Phillip Hamilton. Awww that would be so cute!! 🥰🥺
What if the family costume is hamilton themed, Colleen is Eliza, Erik is Hamilton, and Flynn is Philip! That would he so cute lol!
Ok i am nervous/excited 😌💓
Just a guess at the Halloween costume thing  I think it is the phantom of the opera...
I think they will probably do a hamilton theme maybe....Idk
I wish I could be a vegan but it’s really hard while still living with my parents
😂😂😂 I LOVE Colleen's corner
Colleen, I’ll be your babysitter, take me with you!  I try to write also. I’m writing a novel.  I am bad about writing but, I think I’m actually good.
I live in Vancouver I definitely recommend comming!! You feel safe!! And Flynn will love all the dar dar 🥰💗🥺
Ugh I literally love her so much ❤
what?? my notifs were on, but i didn't get a notif for this video. :(
“my requirement is that they are erik stocklin” 🥺❤️
6:45 you’re welcome
IM SO EARLY!! Love u Colleen!!🥰🥰
shes wearing the same color as when she found out she was pregnant the first time...nice click bait
Hey girl ive been watching you for the longest luv your videos hope you see this k byeee colleen
Wooooo!! Go Colleen!! The vegans are proud of you!!!
10:03 ThatVeganTeacher is typing....
Hmm, musical theatre with a mom dad and baby. I am thinking Jenna and Dr. Pomatter maybe?
I clicked faster than Miranda sings could cancel someone
Maybe Flynn would like dolls with the bendy arms. The ones with joints. Those were the best anyway.
Hamilton that’s the family costume that’s my guess
Angelica, Eliza.... and Peggy
I think it’s Hamilton!!
clickbated
I think the costume thing will be waitress
More colleen. We love you and your baby. Tuesdays just got so much better.        I want more mini colleen and eric babays
Girl if trump gets re-elected pack those bags and move to Canada!👏🏼😂
How crazy is it that I remember that first colleges corner and where I watched it when I was in like 6th grade
What do you mean by accident ?!?!?
OMGOSH, IM A VEGETARIAN!! *I don’t know if i spelled that right* lol
i clicked faster than trump can say maga
Family Halloween costume: mummy pig, daddy pig and george
when she said on accident 😏😳 😂😂😂😂😂
Wizards of Oz
I love that Flynn also wants to include the animals! He is so sweet! Maybe He’s got that builder brain like Jacob! ❤️
is it hamilton imagine angelica eliza and peggy
Are you guys going to be Hamilton Eliza, and Philip?!🥰🥰🥰
I bite string cheese too...
Same lol
Loving the inclusion from Colleen "some women have periods, even some men have periods" stan an inclusive queen
I think it will be Hamilton theme
Bite in to string cheese i do that hahahaha
#AnxietyCrew
Unless you’re planning on having an abortion, which of your rights as a woman are you worried about having taken?
Wwwoooooowwww
I personally don't think I could ever be vegan, but I really respect anyone who can choose a certain way of eating and stick to it.
Oh my God!😂
You guys will be the Hamilton family Erik=Alexander Hamilton  Colleen=Eliza Schuyler Hamilton  Flynn=Philip Hamilton
I am one of ur anxiety sisters!!
My son LOVES Hot wheels car and the little garage that comes with them. I TOTALLY recommend I think flynn would love them!
I feel like I’m back in 2012 omg can we go back when times were easier 🥺
Hamilton
The way she read mum 😹😹😹😹
I think y'all are doing Heathers or Shrek!
I think it is Hamilton
QUESTION...  Is it trendy to write "read my name" comment? Did I miss something
10 min!!! I am at work but can’t wait to get home and watch it💕🥰!!! ( 790) 😂😂
String Cheese LOL
Hi colleen it’s my birthday so pls pin this and I have a question do you like trump???
Me: yey, finally bed time. I'm so tired  My brain: 6:53
6:54 OML how dose she talk so fast for so long lol
Lol did she just say that men can have periods? She is a nice person but it's sad how she is being brainwashed by radical, far left ideology... "Men can have periods" people are on the same level as flat earthers in my book...
Omg I just realized I’m faster than the speed of light-
U should move to burnaby
It's still weird to see colleen film in the guest room.
halloween costume ideas: the baker, bakers wife, and baby from into the woods! hamilton, eliza and Philip?! idk i thought these would be cuteeee🥰
I want her to have another baby!  Especially a little baby girl version of Colleen!!! <3
I bet that there Halloween costume is , Colleen is going to be Eliza , Eric is Alexander Hamilton, and Flynn is there son
lol..My husband had me tattoo our wedding anniversary date on him because we both kept forgetting! All we could remember was November...we couldnt remember the day or year. I still cant remember unless I look at it
you ask her your questions and she replies. her answers are lame but at least she tries. ✨colleen’s corner✨
Costume idea. Colleen as Eliza, Eric as Alexander, and Flynn as Philip?
if your halloween costumes are alexander, eliza, and phillip i will die.
Hiiiiii
I stopped my class just to watch thisssss
Well your family costume had better not be Hamilton. I thought that it was good, but will be so overdone this Halloween
i hope you guys are doing hamilton costumes.... hahaha flynn is philip you are eliza and erik is alexander
omg what if their family costume is little shop as horrors with colleen as audrey erik as seymour and flynn as audrey 2
I guessing your musical theatre themed costume is the,  Baker, Baker's wife and their baby.
You and james charles always post at the same time.....♡︎
I think the musical theater costume will be the Hamilton fam  !!😁
Clicked so fast 🙌🏻😊❤️
Hamilton or High school musical????
ily
The OGs stan Colleen’s Corner
Having a baby is solely Colleen and Eric’s choice. If they want to then go for it. If they don’t then we should respect that. ❤️❤️❤️
I'VE NEVER CLICKED THIS FAST
just saying— vancouver island is GORGEOUS
OMG BE THE MOM DAD AND SON FROM SUESICAL
this makes me want a baby i- flynn is so precious
I didn’t even see this posted and I just saw it and clicked so fast
I read the title and teared up
Colleen is going to be Angelica Schuyler Eric is going to be Hamilton and Flint is going to be Philip, i think.
I don’t even care for the title, I care about Colleen and a chitchat
Why does the red blanket thing in the background look like organs
Where is your shirt from i Think i have the same one
omg my brother did the same exact thing with his face after hugging us wtf
How many people have been true fans forever and had a heart attack when reading the title my sister is having baby number two due in april 2021 and her first son turns two in july 2021 ☺
When I saw this I went crazy!I haven't even watch this video yet but I am going to and I am mine one like the title!
I havnt watched it yet but my first thought is how many times is she gonna click bait about having another baby so hopefully it’s not click bait this time Hahaha  After watching the video oh wait it was click bait againnnn
I don’t know if this is what you thought, but  y’all should be waitress characters and Flinn can be a pie
"it might happen on accident"
colleen, colleens corner could save 2020 PLEASE start doing them again 😀
I the costume is clue
800th

IS THE COSTUME GERTRUDE AND HORTON AND THE ELEPHANT BIRD FROM SEUSSICAL
I love this length of hair on Colleen, just a good medium length but it’s super cute on her
Normal People: Our anniversary is January 10! Colleen and Erik: Wait when is our anniversary again?
I hope that they’re doing the Wizard Of Oz for halloween, that would be so cool!
And I thought I spoke fast 😂
I can see Flynn when he is an adult he we’ll be so successful and have a lot of expensive cars lol
I LOVE Colleen’s corner and idk why but the conversations she has were interesting
who else feels like colleen is their mom because youre more into her and her well being and life than you are your bio moms? love you colleen/mom
30 people can’t be first :/
I think it is waitress as the family halloween costume
You will be Eliza and Alexander hamilton and Flynn will be Phillip

OMGGGG I SQUEALED WHEN I SAW THE TITLEEEEE
#earlysquad
I have a period story. Happened last night. I was at work, my period was hurting me. I laid down on a stack of boxes, my (attractive) boss comes in unexpectedly because he needed some boxes for another store. He said “Katie why are you laying on those boxes?” because he knows I’m the type to be working 100% of the time. I panicked and said “period” and he looked a little confused, thought about it for a second, then looked disgusted and said “Okay....” then I hid in the back of the store because I didn’t wanna see him anymore  He’s 28. Sure, he’s single, got no kids, but men shouldn’t be uncomfortable about periods. It’s a thing that happens. I talk openly about it with people I know, but not my hot boss 😂
Watching Colleen since I was 10. Seven years and counting :))
Little shop???
the second i read the title i was like IM WATCHING THIS NOW
Hey yall😏
